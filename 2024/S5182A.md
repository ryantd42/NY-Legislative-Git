 AN ACT to authorize members of the New York  state  and  New  York  city
  teachers'  retirement systems and the New York state and local employ-
  ees' retirement system to claim retirement credit for certain  private
  school teaching service
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a member of the
 New York state teachers' retirement system or the New York  city  teach-
 ers'  retirement  system,  or any member of the New York state and local
 employees' retirement system who is employed by  a  school  district,  a
 board  of  cooperative  educational services, a vocational education and
 extension board, an institution for the  instruction  of  the  deaf  and
 blind  as  enumerated  in  section 4201 of the education law or a school
 district as enumerated in section 1 of chapter 566 of the laws of  1967,
 or  who is employed by the state of New York as an institutional teacher
 as defined by section 136 of the civil service law, shall be entitled to
 obtain credit for up to five years of  service  rendered  as  a  teacher
 employed by a private elementary or secondary school within the state of
 New  York  chartered by or registered with the board of regents, or in a
 private college within the state of New York authorized by the board  of
 regents  to  grant degrees, which would constitute service as a teacher,
 had it been performed within New York state for an employer  subject  to
 the applicable provisions of law governing such retirement system.
  § 2. The crediting of service pursuant to this act shall be in accord-
 ance  with such rules and regulations as shall be adopted by the retire-
 ment board of the  New  York  state  teachers'  retirement  system,  the
 retirement board of the New York city teachers' retirement system or the
 state  comptroller,  as  appropriate, provided that such rules and regu-

 lations shall be substantially equivalent to the rules  and  regulations
 otherwise applicable for the crediting of service pursuant to applicable
 provisions  of  law  governing each such retirement system, and provided
 further  that  if such provisions have not expired such member makes the
 applicable payments required pursuant to the provisions of sections  517
 and  613, and paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 609 of the retire-
 ment and social security law.
  § 3. The service credit granted pursuant to this act shall  constitute
 service  for  the  purpose  of  both  computing the pension payable upon
 retirement for service and in determining the total  length  of  service
 credited  for  the purpose of eligibility for a service retirement bene-
 fit, but shall not be used in computing final average  salary.  Provided
 further,  no  such credit shall be allowed for any service for which the
 person is receiving a benefit or will be entitled to receive  a  benefit
 at any future time from any other public or private retirement system or
 plan in this state, any other state or from the federal government.
  §  4. This act shall take effect June 30, 2023. Effective immediately,
 the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or  regulation  neces-
 sary  for  the  implementation  of  this  act  on its effective date are
 authorized to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow members of the New York State and Local  Employ-
 ees'  Retirement System (NYSLERS) who are currently employed by a school
 district, a board of  cooperative  educational  services,  a  vocational
 education  and extension board, an institution for the deaf and blind or
 as an institutional teacher to receive up to five years of service cred-
 it in the NYSLERS for employment as a teacher in private schools in  New
 York  State.  However,  credit  will not be provided for any service for
 which the member is receiving a benefit or will be entitled to receive a
 benefit at any future time from any other public or  private  retirement
 system  or  plan  in New York State, any other state or from the federal
 government.
  The additional service credit granted  pursuant  to  this  bill  shall
 constitute service credit for the purpose of computing the pension paya-
 ble  upon  retirement  and  shall be used to determine eligibility for a
 service benefit. For certain members, contributions will be required  to
 obtain such additional service credit. Each such member will be required
 to make a payment of 3% (6% for Tier 6) of current compensation per year
 of additional service credit granted pursuant to this bill.
  Insofar  as  this  bill affects the NYSLERS, pursuant to Section 25 of
 the Retirement and Social Security Law, the  increased  costs  would  be
 borne  entirely  by  the State of New York and would require an itemized
 appropriation sufficient to pay the cost of the provision. If this  bill
 were  enacted  during the 2023 legislative session, it is estimated that
 the past service cost will average approximately 18% (15% for Tier 6) of
 an affected member's compensation for each year  of  additional  service
 credit that is purchased.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  plan  qualification  issues:  granting
 service  credit  for  employment  rendered  to any organization that may
 potentially be considered a non-governmental or private  employer,  such
 as  certain  types  of  educational institutions described in this bill,
 could jeopardize the Retirement System's governmental  plan  status  and
 its  exemption  from ERISA. This development could result in the loss of
 qualified status, which would mean the loss of tax benefits. This result
 S. 5182  3
 
 would substantially impair the Retirement System's  value  to  our  more
 than one million participants.
  Prior to the enactment of this legislation, we recommend that a favor-
 able ruling be obtained from the IRS stating that these provisions would
 not  harm the qualification status of the Retirement System. It is esti-
 mated that the costs to obtain such a ruling would be  $38,000  for  the
 services of the IRS, and $1,000 per hour for legal consultants.
