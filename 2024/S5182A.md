 AN  ACT  to  authorize  members  of the New York state and New York city
  teachers' retirement systems and the New York state and local  employ-
  ees'  retirement system to claim retirement credit for certain private
  school teaching service
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a member of the
 New  York  state teachers' retirement system or the New York city teach-
 ers' retirement system, or any member of the New York  state  and  local
 employees'  retirement  system  who  is employed by a school district, a
 board of cooperative educational services, a  vocational  education  and
 extension  board,  an  institution  for  the instruction of the deaf and
 blind as enumerated in section 4201 of the education  law  or  a  school
 district  as enumerated in section 1 of chapter 566 of the laws of 1967,
 or who is employed by the state of New York as an institutional  teacher
 as defined by section 136 of the civil service law, shall be entitled to
 obtain  credit  for  up  to  five years of service rendered as a teacher
 employed by a private elementary or secondary school within the state of
 New York chartered by or registered with the board of regents, or  in  a
 private  college within the state of New York authorized by the board of
 regents to grant degrees, which would constitute service as  a  teacher,
 had  it  been performed within New York state for an employer subject to
 the applicable provisions of law governing such retirement system.
  § 2. The crediting of service pursuant to this act shall be in accord-
 ance with such rules and regulations as shall be adopted by the  retire-

 ment  board  of  the  New  York  state  teachers' retirement system, the
 retirement board of the New York city teachers' retirement system or the
 state comptroller, as appropriate, provided that such  rules  and  regu-
 lations  shall  be substantially equivalent to the rules and regulations
 otherwise applicable for the crediting of service pursuant to applicable
 provisions of law governing each such retirement  system,  and  provided
 further  that  if such provisions have not expired such member makes the
 applicable payments required pursuant to the provisions of sections  517
 and  613, and paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 609 of the retire-
 ment and social security law.
  § 3. The service credit granted pursuant to this act shall  constitute
 service  for  the  purpose  of  both  computing the pension payable upon
 retirement for service and in determining the total  length  of  service
 credited  for  the purpose of eligibility for a service retirement bene-
 fit, but shall not be used in computing final average  salary.  Provided
 further,  no  such credit shall be allowed for any service for which the
 person is receiving a benefit or will be entitled to receive  a  benefit
 at any future time from any other public or private retirement system or
 plan in this state, any other state or from the federal government.
  §  4. This act shall take effect June 30, 2024. Effective immediately,
 the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or  regulation  neces-
 sary  for  the  implementation  of  this  act  on its effective date are
 authorized to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow members of the New York State and Local  Employ-
 ees'  Retirement  System  (NYSLERS)  currently  employed  by  a  school
 district, a board of  cooperative  educational  services,  a  vocational
 education  and extension board, or an institution for the deaf and blind
 or as an institutional teacher to receive up to five  years  of  service
 credit  in the NYSLERS for employment as a teacher in private schools in
 New York State. No credit shall be provided for any service for which  a
 member  is receiving, or will be entitled to receive at any future time,
 a benefit from any other public or private retirement system or plan  in
 New York State, any other state or from the federal government.
  The  additional  service  credit  granted  pursuant to this bill shall
 constitute service credit for the purpose of computing the pension paya-
 ble upon retirement and shall be used to  determine  eligibility  for  a
 service  benefit. For certain members, contributions will be required to
 receive such  additional  service  credit.  Each  such  member  will  be
 required  to  make  a  payment  of 3% (6% for Tier 6 members) of current
 compensation per year of additional service credit granted  pursuant  to
 this bill.
  Insofar  as  this  bill affects the NYSLERS, pursuant to Section 25 of
 the Retirement and Social Security Law, the  increased  costs  would  be
 borne  entirely  by  the State of New York and would require an itemized
 appropriation sufficient to pay the cost of the provision. If this  bill
 were  enacted  during the 2024 Legislative Session, it is estimated that
 the past service cost will average approximately 18%  (15%  for  Tier  6
 members)  of an affected member's current compensation per year of addi-
 tional service credit granted.
  Further, we anticipate some  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.

 potentially be considered a non-governmental or private  employer  could
 jeopardize  the  governmental plan status of the Retirement System ("the
 System") and its exemption from the Employees Retirement Income Security
 Act.  This  development  could  result  in the loss of qualified status,
 which would mean the loss of tax benefits. This  result  would  substan-
 tially  impair  the  System's value to our more than one million partic-
 ipants.
  Prior to the enactment of this legislation, we recommend that a favor-
 able ruling be obtained from the IRS stating that these provisions would
 not harm the qualification status of the System. It  is  estimated  that
 the  costs  to obtain such a ruling would be $38,000 for the services of
 the IRS, and $1,000 per hour for legal consultants.
