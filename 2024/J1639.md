  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 2024, as Human Trafficking Prevention  Month
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim January 2024, as Human
Trafficking Prevention Month in the State of New  York,  in  conjunction
with the observance of National Human Trafficking Prevention Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  First  established  in  2010,  National  Human Trafficking
Prevention Month aims to elevate the issue and highlight the  impact  it
has  domestically  and  internationally; designating a time and space to
acknowledge the importance of this issue allows for more visibility  and
prevention efforts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Trafficking  is  the  use  of force, fraud, or coercion to
control  an  individual  into  commercial  sex  or  labor;  victims  of
trafficking  can  be children or adults, of any gender identity, and can
live in any neighborhood; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to the complexity and grooming involved in this  crime,
there  are  many  times  when  individuals  don't  recognize  their  own
situation as trafficking; prevention efforts are  focused  on  educating
the  community and those who may be more vulnerable and at a higher risk
for trafficking; and
 
  WHEREAS, Passed in 2000,  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Act
(TVAP),  along  with  other  State  legislation have expanded prevention
efforts, extended legal protections for trafficked children and  adults,
and  made  notable  changes to criminal law; these changes in government
policies improved  opportunities  for  programs  that  are  involved  in
investigating trafficking and providing services to victims; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Service providers have created networks that support those
who have experienced trafficking to find safety and  healing;  the  Safe
Center  is  Nassau County's service provider for children and adults who
have been victims of or are at risk to experience trafficking; and
 
  WHEREAS, The number of sexual and labor trafficking  cases  reported
each  year  continues  to  grow  as  more light is given to the issue by
various actors in New York, across the United  States,  and  around  the
globe; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  scope and magnitude of the issue of human trafficking
is yet to be known, both domestically and abroad; and
 
  WHEREAS, Human Trafficking Awareness Month was implemented to  raise
awareness among Americans that human trafficking does not just happen in
 
other countries, but in states and communities across the United States;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be done to eradicate human trafficking
at the local, state and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim January 2024, as Human
Trafficking Prevention Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
