BY: M. of A. Rosenthal L
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  8:30pm-9:30pm on Saturday, March 25, 2023, as  Earth
  Hour in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to increase public
awareness  of, and appreciation for, the natural resources of this great
Empire State, as well  as  recognize  the  role  all  citizens  have  in
protecting the environment and the quality of life within New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On Earth Hour, cities across the world ask their residents
and businesses to turn off all non-essential  lights  for  one  hour  in
collective  reflection  of  the  importance of our natural world and the
challenges it faces; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2022, millions of  people  at  home,  as  well  as  many
landmarks  and monuments across more than 190 countries and territories,
switched  off  their  light  to  promote  awareness  and  conversation
concerning  issues  of climate change, habitat loss and natural resource
conservation; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State should once again take its place among these
world sites in  2023,  and  demonstrate  the  commitment  of  our  staid
institutions,  both  public  and private, by going dark in reflection of
the environmental impacts to which our built world and daily  activities
unwittingly contribute; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having iconic sites such as the Empire State Building, The
Capitol, and Niagara Falls go dark  will  have  a  deep  and  meaningful
impact  on  people  around  the  world,  show  support  for students who
recently participated in demonstrations for climate change  action,  and
catalyze  new  ways  of  thinking  about how we can prosper as a society
without depleting our planet's vitality; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim 8:30pm-9:30pm on Saturday,
March  25,  2023,  as  Earth  Hour  in  the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
