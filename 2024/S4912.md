  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  commissioner  of  motor vehicles shall enter into an
 agreement with the Dominican Republic through the National Institute  of
 Transit and Land Transportation (Instituto Nacional de Transito y Trans-
 porte  Terrestre)  (INTRANT) represented by the Consulate General of the
 Dominican Republic  in  New  York  for  reciprocity  in  issuing  driver
 licenses  to citizens from the state of New York residing in the Domini-
 can Republic and to the Dominican citizens residing in the state of  New
 York.  The  parties  shall agree that reciprocal provisions for issuance
 and skills to acquire a driver license shall be applicable in  New  York
 and in the Dominican Republic.
  §  2.  The parties shall agree that a holder of a valid driver license
 of the state of New York residing in the Dominican  Republic,  shall  be
 able to exchange such license for a Dominican Republic driver license at
 the nominal conversion fee, without being required to pass the knowledge
 and  road  test. Correspondingly, a holder of a valid Dominican Republic
 driver license lawfully residing in the state of New York,  who  is  not
 exempt  from  licensing  requirements under the vehicle and traffic law,
 shall be able to exchange a Dominican Republic license  for  a  standard
 license  in the state of New York at the nominal conversion fee, without
 being required to pass the knowledge and road test.
  § 3. The state of New York, through the commissioner  of  motor  vehi-
 cles,  and  the  Dominican  Republic,  through the National Institute of
 Transit and Land Transportation (Instituto Nacional de Transito y Trans-
 porte Terrestre) (INTRANT), shall agree on the following:
