 PERMITTED TO DISSOLVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND FOR  SUCH
 COVERED  SITE.  IF AFTER SUCH INSPECTION THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES ENVI-
 RONMENTAL MAINTENANCE IS REQUIRED AT SUCH  COVERED  SITE,  THE  ENVIRON-

 MENTAL MAINTENANCE. IF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND  IS  NOT
 SUFFICIENT  TO  COMPLETE  THE ENVIRONMENTAL MAINTENANCE, THE OWNER SHALL
 COMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL MAINTENANCE USING OTHER FUNDS.
  (C) IF THE OWNER OF A COVERED  SITE  DOES  NOT  PERFORM  ENVIRONMENTAL

 THE  ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND TO ENSURE THE ENVI-
 RONMENTAL MAINTENANCE IS COMPLETED. UPON  COMPLETION  OF  SUCH  ENVIRON-
 MENTAL  MAINTENANCE, IF THE SITE IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED A COVERED SITE,
 THE ENVIRONMENTAL MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND  SHALL  BE  DISSOLVED  AND  ANY
 REMAINING FUNDS SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE OWNER.

 ENVIRONMENTAL  MAINTENANCE  TRUST FUNDS INCLUDING THE SIZE OF SUCH TRUST
 FUNDS, THE MECHANISM FOR ENSURING FUNDS IN SUCH TRUST FUNDS ARE NOT ABLE
 TO BE USED UNTIL PERMITTED UNDER THIS SECTION,  AND  WHEN  ENVIRONMENTAL
 MAINTENANCE IS REQUIRED.
  4. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL PREVENT THE DEPARTMENT, THE STATE, OR
 ANY  POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF FROM RECOVERING THE COSTS OF ENVIRON-
 MENTAL MAINTENANCE UNDER ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW.
  § 2. This act shall take effect one year after it shall have become  a
 law.
