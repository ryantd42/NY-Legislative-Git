Assembly Resolution No. 2004
 
BY: M. of A. Magnarelli
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary of Syracuse
  University's  Maxwell  School  of  Citizenship  and
  Public Affairs on October 3, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend those institutions of true purpose and  high  achievement  whose
exemplary  programs  and accomplishments clearly demonstrate an enduring
pursuit of excellence in the education of the youth of this noble Empire
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the  100th  Anniversary  of  Syracuse  University's  Maxwell
School of Citizenship and Public Affairs on October 3, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Maxwell  School  is  an  interdisciplinary school for
public service and the social sciences; its 100th Anniversary  theme  is
"Ever  Strive,"  which  is reflective of its ambitions to live up to the
portion of the Athenian Oath inscribed on its walls: "We  will  transmit
this city not only not less, but greater, better and more beautiful than
it was transmitted to us"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Maxwell  School was dedicated on October 3, 1924, and
was the first program to offer a graduate professional degree in  public
administration;  that  Master  of  Public  Administration program is the
oldest  continuously  operating,  university-based  MPA  in  the  United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Part of Syracuse University, a private research university
in Syracuse, New York, the Maxwell School is organized  in  11  academic
departments,  15  affiliated  research centers, and offers coursework in
the fields of public administration,  international  relations,  foreign
policy,  political  science,  science  and  technology  policy,  social
sciences, and economics through its undergraduate (BA and  BS)  degrees,
graduate Master of Public Administration (MPA), Master of Arts (MA), and
PhD degrees; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recognized as one of the world's best graduate schools for
public affairs, the Maxwell  School,  formerly  known  as  the  Training
School  for  Public  Service,  was  founded by New York City's Bureau of
Municipal Research, and was later transferred to Syracuse University  in
1924; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  school is named for George Holmes Maxwell, a Syracuse
alumnus and Boston patent attorney, who in 1924 donated $500,000 to  the
university  to  establish  a  school which would aim "to cull from every
source those principles, facts, and elements which,  combined,  make  up
our rights and duties and our value and distinctiveness as United States
citizens"; Maxwell's initial interest was in training all undergraduates
for  their  roles  as  informed  citizens  in the American democracy and
University officials  convinced  him  the  school  should  also  provide
professional  training  for future government officials and other public
servants; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1937, the University took its full name and moved into
Maxwell Hall, a purpose-built building  on  the  west  end  of  Syracuse
University's  main  campus;  in  1994,  the  Maxwell School expanded and
Eggers Hall was designed; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2013, the Maxwell School and the  Center  for  Strategic
and  International  Studies  entered into a collaborative agreement that
included headquartering all Maxwell operations at  CSIS  in  Washington,
D.C.; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1995, the Maxwell School has been consistently ranked
one  of  the nation's top schools of public affairs by U.S. News & World
Report; in 2022, the school  ranked  no.  1  in  Public  Management  and
Leadership,  no.  2  in  Nonprofit  Management  and  Public  Finance and
Budgeting, no. 6 in the Environmental Policy  and  Management,  and  has
received a myriad of other rankings; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Maxwell  School  has  had  many prestigious visitors,
including Herbert Hoover, who was there for the  dedication  of  Maxwell
Hall,  and  in 1960, Harry Truman, amid his personal campaign to bolster
appreciation for American government by the nation's young; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  steadfast  and  unyielding  commitment  of  parents,
educators  and  administrators  to provide the highest quality education
for students has become the  hallmark  and  tradition  of  the  Syracuse
University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the  Syracuse  University's  Maxwell  School  of
Citizenship and Public Affairs stands prepared to reach out, in  earnest
and  enthusiastic quest of its mission, to promote the maximum growth of
every student, establishing standards and  building  skills  which  will
carry  its  students  and the citizens of its community into the future;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and
Public Affairs is proudly aware of  its  distinguished  past,  eager  to
fulfill  its  present commitment to parents, students and the community,
and planning with vision and purpose for the ebb and swell of growth and
change it will encounter in the years to come; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of  Syracuse  University's Maxwell
School of Citizenship and Public Affairs on October 3, 2024; and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Syracuse University's Maxwell School  of  Citizenship
and Public Affairs.
