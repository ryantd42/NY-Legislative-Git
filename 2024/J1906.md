  COMMEMORATING  the 35th Anniversary of Cooperative
  Magnetic Imaging (CMI) in 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and businesses which substantially
contribute to the economic vitality of their communities and the  entire
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  35th Anniversary of Cooperative Magnetic Imaging (CMI)
in 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a motto of "The right magnet, for the  right  patient,
at the right time," Cooperative Magnetic Imaging, is an American College
of Radiology Accredited MRI facility based in Utica, New York with three
locations;  CMI has assembled a reputable team of radiologists from high
quality programs such as Harvard, Yale, Duke, Tufts, and Upstate Medical
Centers to provide  professional  expertise  including  musculoskeletal,
neuro, breast and vascular imaging; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dedicated  to  providing  the most advanced MRI imaging to
Utica, New York, Cooperative Magnetic Imaging offers patients  a  unique
combination  of  open  and conventional system MRI diagnostic tests with
the  best  equipment  available;  CMI  has  the  capability  to  perform
neurological, breast, vascular and musculoskeletal specialty exams; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Delivering  accurate  and  compassionate  care  to  the
community, CMI invested in MRI in 1989 to fulfill  the  need  for  these
services  in  the  Utica  area;  the  MRI  is  continually  evolving  as
technology advances in the field of science,  and  CMI  prioritizes  the
latest  technology  and  the  highest  quality  of radiologist expertise
available; and
 
  WHEREAS, With many  esteemed  physicians  and  healthcare  providers
having  chosen  CMI  as  their  MRI  facility  over the past almost four
decades, CMI continues to put their customer service first as they serve
the Utica community; and
 
  WHEREAS, In April of 1989, CMI installed the first MRI unit  at  the
Utica Business Park, their main headquarters to this day; as a result of
a collaborative effort of several local radiologists in Oneida County, a
$2.9  million  seven-ton  magnet that gives physicians three-dimensional
"slices" was installed; and
 
  WHEREAS, In October of 1996, the first Open  MRI  was  performed  at
CMI,  which  benefited patients who were unable to tolerate conventional
MRI scanners due to claustrophobia or their size; then, CMI  implemented
MRI  3D  Angiography,  which  is  primarily  used  to  diagnose vascular
abnormalities such as aneurysms, in June of 1994; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rising from their humble  beginnings,  CMI  opened  an  MRI
Campus  at  St. Luke's Hospital in November of 2001, where CMI Diffusion
 
Imaging Scans of the brain are performed; expanding their services,  CMI
also  opened  an  MRI  Campus  at  St.  Elizabeth's  Medical Center that
performs cardiac scans in February of 2003, as well as an MRI Campus  at
Slocum Dickson and an Open MRI in Ilion, New York in 2006; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  March of 2007, CMI implemented advanced breast MRIs at
St.  Luke's Hospital to answer the call of the American Cancer  Society,
which  recommends annual breast cancer screening with magnetic resonance
imaging in addition to a mammogram for women  at  high  risk  of  breast
cancer;  that same year, CMI radiologists performed the first breast MRI
guided  core  biopsy,  an  extremely  accurate  way  of  localizing  the
suspicious area of breast tissue in high risk individuals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Reaching a remarkable milestone, CMI performed over 200,000
MRI  exams  by  2009;  today,  the company continues to provide a unique
combination of open and conventional system MRI  diagnostic  tests  with
state-of-the-art  medical  equipment  and  a  high level of professional
services, their latest innovation being the installation of the  Siemens
3  Tesla  Magnetom  Skyra  MRI, the most powerful MRI that is clinically
available in the Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Cooperative Magnetic  Imaging  (CMI)  is  in
direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its  President  and  CEO, its
stakeholders, and its dedicated staff, whose involvement is, and  always
has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the company and the population it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business  and  its  contributions  to  the
local  and  State  economies,  fully  confident that it will continue to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 35th Anniversary of Cooperative Magnetic  Imaging  (CMI)
in 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Cooperative Magnetic Imaging (CMI).
