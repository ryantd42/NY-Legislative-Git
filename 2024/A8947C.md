 Introduced  by M. of A. REYES -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Labor
 
 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to  requiring  retail  worker
  employers  to  develop  and  implement  programs  to prevent workplace
  violence
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  This  act  shall be known and may be cited as the "retail
 worker safety act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature  finds  and  declares  that
 violence  against  retail workers is a growing problem in New York. From
 verbal harassment that often leads to physical violence, all the way  to
 racially  motivated  mass  shootings  of  retail  workers and customers,
 retail workers are on the front lines of violence in our society.  Given
 that  these  stores  offer  essential  necessities  to  the public, this
 violence is also a threat to public health and safety.  The  legislature
 also finds and declares that many employers have not done enough to take
 responsibility for the health and safety of their employees. Few employ-
 ers  have  conducted risk assessments of their workplace, and even fewer
 have adequately trained their employees in how to respond to  harassment
 and potentially violent situations.
  §  3. The labor law is amended by adding a new section 27-e to read as
 follows:
  § 27-E. DUTY OF RETAIL  WORKER  EMPLOYERS  TO  DEVELOP  AND  IMPLEMENT
 PROGRAMS TO PREVENT WORKPLACE VIOLENCE. 1. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES
 OF THIS SECTION:
  A.  "EMPLOYER"  MEANS ANY PERSON, ENTITY, BUSINESS, CORPORATION, PART-
 NERSHIP, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, OR AN ASSOCIATION EMPLOYING AT LEAST
 TEN RETAIL WORKERS. THE TERM SHALL NOT INCLUDE THE STATE, ANY  POLITICAL
 SUBDIVISION  OF THE STATE, A PUBLIC AUTHORITY, OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL
 AGENCY OR INSTRUMENTALITY.
  B. "EMPLOYEE" MEANS A RETAIL WORKER WORKING FOR AN EMPLOYER.

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
