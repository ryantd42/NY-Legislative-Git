  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 3, 2023, as Navy Reserve Day in the  State  of
  New  York, in conjunction with the 108th Anniversary
  of the establishment of the Navy Reserve
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to  commemorate
special  days  in  honor  of the people, organizations, and institutions
that represent the best of New York State and of our Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March  3,  2023,  as  Navy
Reserve  Day  in  the  State  of New York, in conjunction with the 108th
Anniversary of the establishment of the Navy Reserve; and
 
  WHEREAS, Navy Reserve Day  commemorates  the  establishment  of  the
United  States  Navy Reserve in 1915, and is celebrated annually by Navy
Reservists, military families, and veterans  of  the  Navy  Reserves  on
March 3rd of each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Legislation  was  passed  by the United States Congress to
establish the United States Navy Reserve, originally known as the United
States Federal Naval Reserve  and  later  as  the  United  States  Naval
Reserve  Force  (USNRF),  on  March  3rd  of 1915 in anticipation of the
United States' entry into World War I; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  2,000,000  United  States  service  members  were
transported  to the European theatre of World War I with the help of the
United States Naval Reserve Force, with USNRF personnel making  up  over
half  of the overall United States Naval Force by the end of World War I
and nearly 85 percent of the United States Naval Force  by  the  end  of
World War II; and
 
  WHEREAS,  What  is today known as the United States Navy Reserve has
its roots in the American Revolution, when citizens of the seaside  town
of  Machias,  Maine  and  the  surrounding  countryside commandeered the
loyalist ship Unity to engage the HMS Margaretta of  the  British  Navy,
defeating  her  in  the  first  naval battle of the American Revolution,
capturing the vessel, and sailing her under the name Machias Liberty for
future engagements in the American Revolution; and
 
  WHEREAS, Citizen-sailors  have  answered  their  Nation's  call  and
fought valiantly on behalf of the United States and her people in nearly
every armed conflict in American history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Five  presidents  of  the United States, 15 Medal of Honor
recipients, and countless patriots have served their Nation with dignity
and distinction in the United States Navy Reserve; and
 
  WHEREAS, The strength and stability of the United States of  America
relies upon a disciplined and committed citizenry to stand in the breach
when our Nation and her interests are imperiled; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United States Navy Reserve is one of the primary ways
our Nation cultivates a body of  well-prepared  patriots  to  call  upon
during her time of need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body encourages all New Yorkers to serve
their community and their Nation in some capacity,  and  should  commend
all who have sworn an oath to do so; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March  3,  2023,  as  Navy
Reserve Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York,  and  the  Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United
States of America and Commander in Chief  of  the  United  States  Armed
Forces.
