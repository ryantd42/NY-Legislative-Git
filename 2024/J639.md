their lives for the independence of their country and for the betterment
of the lives of their families, friends, and peers; and

  WHEREAS,  Indian  Independence  Day is a momentous occasion which is
celebrated extravagantly throughout the  world,  including  with  events
such  as flag raising ceremonies in each of the state capitals in India,
kite flying, national color displays, singings of  the  Indian  national
anthem, and exquisite parades that display Indian patriotism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is important to honor and cherish the ancestral history
of the citizens of the State of New York, and to educate the citizens of
this state of the richness thereof; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
