  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 9, 2023, as Yellow Ribbon Day in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to pay the highest
tribute to the members of the United States Armed Forces during times of
crisis who have so faithfully served their community  and  country  with
courage  and commitment contributing to the safety and welfare of others
and the preservation of the  freedoms  and  democratic  principles  upon
which this State and Nation are founded; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  dedication  and  sacrifices of our military personnel
ensure our continued role as a  Nation  which  embodies  the  ideals  of
democracy, and which is a defender of liberty for peoples throughout the
world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 9, 2023, as Yellow Ribbon Day in
the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many  have  devoted  countless  hours  distributing  yellow
ribbons  around  the State of New York to heighten awareness and support
of our service men and women who are serving our country, in addition to
promoting unity and respect for those brave individuals who protect  our
freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, The banner of freedom will always wave over our beloved New
York and all of America, the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with  which these men and women served their country, and must recognize
that no greater debt is owed than that owed  to  those  who  gave  their
lives  for  their beloved Nation and to those who continue to be missing
in action; and
 
  WHEREAS, American former Prisoners of War are heroes  whose  service
to our country will never be forgotten; these brave men and women fought
for  their  country and endured cruelties and deprivation as they helped
to protect our Nation, and to liberate  millions  from  the  threats  of
tyranny and terror, advancing the cause of freedom worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, The freedoms and security we cherish as Americans come at a
very  high price for those serving in the military in times of conflict;
it is fitting and proper that we who are the beneficiaries of those  who
risk  their  lives,  leaving  their  families  behind,  express  our
appreciation and eternal gratitude for their sacrifices  and  courageous
acts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 9, 2023,  as  Yellow
Ribbon Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
