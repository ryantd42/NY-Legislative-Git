 SECTION.
  § 741. GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE; PROCEDURE.  1.
 A  LICENSE  GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MAY BE REVOKED OR SUSPENDED
 BY THE SUPERINTENDENT UPON A FINDING THAT:
  (A) THE LICENSEE HAS VIOLATED ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION;
  (B) ANY FACT OR CONDITION EXISTS WHICH, IF IT HAD EXISTED AT THE  TIME
 OF  THE  ORIGINAL  APPLICATION  FOR  SUCH  LICENSE,  CLEARLY  WOULD HAVE
 WARRANTED THE SUPERINTENDENT'S REFUSAL TO ISSUE SUCH LICENSE; OR
  (C) THE LICENSEE HAS FAILED TO PAY ANY SUM OF MONEY LAWFULLY  DEMANDED
 BY  THE  SUPERINTENDENT OR TO COMPLY WITH ANY DEMAND, RULING OR REQUIRE-
 MENT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

 INTENDENT  WRITTEN  NOTICE  THAT  THE  LICENSEE  THEREBY SURRENDERS SUCH

 SUPERINTENDENT,  AND  SHALL NOT AFFECT SUCH LICENSEE'S CIVIL OR CRIMINAL
 LIABILITY FOR ACTS COMMITTED PRIOR TO SUCH SURRENDER.
  3. EVERY LICENSE ISSUED HEREUNDER SHALL REMAIN  IN  FORCE  AND  EFFECT
 UNTIL  THE  SAME  SHALL  HAVE BEEN SURRENDERED, REVOKED OR SUSPENDED, IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE, BUT  THE  SUPERINTENDENT
 SHALL  HAVE  AUTHORITY TO REINSTATE SUSPENDED LICENSES OR TO ISSUE A NEW
 LICENSE TO A LICENSEE WHOSE LICENSE HAS  BEEN  REVOKED  IF  NO  FACT  OR
 CONDITION THEN EXISTS WHICH CLEARLY WOULD HAVE WARRANTED THE SUPERINTEN-
 DENT'S REFUSAL TO ISSUE SUCH LICENSE.
  4.  WHENEVER  THE  SUPERINTENDENT  SHALL  REVOKE  OR SUSPEND A LICENSE
 ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS  ARTICLE,  THE  SUPERINTENDENT  SHALL  FORTHWITH

  5. THE SUPERINTENDENT MAY, FOR GOOD CAUSE, WITHOUT NOTICE AND A  HEAR-
 ING,  SUSPEND  ANY  LICENSE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE FOR A PERIOD
 NOT EXCEEDING THIRTY DAYS, PENDING INVESTIGATION. "GOOD CAUSE," AS  USED
 IN  THIS  SUBDIVISION, SHALL EXIST ONLY WHEN THE LICENSEE HAS ENGAGED IN
 OR  IS  LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN A PRACTICE PROHIBITED BY THIS ARTICLE OR THE
 REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER OR ENGAGES IN DISHONEST OR  INEQUITA-
 BLE PRACTICES WHICH MAY CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL HARM TO THE PUBLIC.

 OR ANY OTHER PERSON HAS VIOLATED ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF  THIS  ARTICLE
 OR  ANY  OTHER  APPLICABLE  LAW,  OR  WHETHER ANY LICENSEE HAS CONDUCTED
 ITSELF IN SUCH MANNER AS WOULD JUSTIFY THE REVOCATION  OF  ITS  LICENSE,
 AND TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY THEREFOR, THE SUPERINTENDENT MAY REQUIRE THE

 POWER TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF ALL RELEVANT BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTS,
 AND DOCUMENTS.

 OF  THE  BOOKS,  RECORDS, ACCOUNTS AND DOCUMENTS USED IN THE BUSINESS OF

 CLE  AND WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS LAWFULLY MADE BY THE SUPERINTEN-
 DENT HEREUNDER.  EVERY  BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER  LENDER  SHALL  PRESERVE  SUCH

 FINAL ENTRY IN RESPECT TO ANY BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LOAN  RECORDED  THEREIN;

 ANNUALLY  FILE  A REPORT WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT GIVING SUCH INFORMATION
 AS THE SUPERINTENDENT MAY REQUIRE CONCERNING THE LICENSEE'S BUSINESS AND
 OPERATIONS DURING THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR WITHIN THE STATE UNDER THE
 AUTHORITY OF THIS ARTICLE. SUCH REPORT SHALL BE SUBSCRIBED AND  AFFIRMED
 AS  TRUE  BY  THE  LICENSEE UNDER THE PENALTIES OF PERJURY AND BE IN THE
 FORM PRESCRIBED BY  THE  SUPERINTENDENT.  IN  ADDITION  TO  SUCH  ANNUAL
 REPORTS,  THE  SUPERINTENDENT  MAY  REQUIRE OF LICENSEES SUCH ADDITIONAL
 REGULAR OR SPECIAL REPORTS AS THE SUPERINTENDENT MAY DEEM  NECESSARY  TO
 THE  PROPER SUPERVISION OF LICENSEES UNDER THIS ARTICLE. SUCH ADDITIONAL
 REPORTS SHALL BE IN THE FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT AND  SHALL
 BE SUBSCRIBED AND AFFIRMED AS TRUE UNDER THE PENALTIES OF PERJURY.

 ATION IN CONNECTION TO A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER  LOAN,  WHETHER  DIRECTLY  OR
 INDIRECTLY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION.
  2.  THE SUPERINTENDENT SHALL ESTABLISH A STANDARD AMOUNT OR PERCENTAGE
 FOR TOTAL MAXIMUM CHARGE OR FEE IN CONNECTION WITH LATE PAYMENT, DEFAULT

  3. CREDIT REPORTING.  A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER SHALL NOT REPORT  ANY
 CONSUMER  DATA  OBTAINED  THROUGH A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LOAN TO ANY CREDIT

 SUPERINTENDENT AND IN THE FORM AND MANNER PRESCRIBED THEREIN. THE SUPER-
 INTENDENT, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF CONSUMER
 PROTECTION, SHALL ESTABLISH PROVISIONS REGARDING THE USE OF SUCH DATA BY
 THE  CREDIT  REPORTING  AGENCIES.  NO  LICENSEE SHALL COLLECT, EVALUATE,
 REPORT, OR MAINTAIN IN THE FILE ON A  BORROWER  THE  CREDIT  WORTHINESS,
 CREDIT  STANDING, OR CREDIT CAPACITY OF MEMBERS OF THE BORROWER'S SOCIAL
 NETWORK FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF THE BORROW-
 ER; THE AVERAGE CREDIT WORTHINESS, CREDIT STANDING, OR  CREDIT  CAPACITY

 CIES AND PROCEDURES.
  5. CONSUMER DISPUTES. A  BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER  LENDER  SHALL  RESOLVE  OR
 CAUSE  TO  BE RESOLVED DISPUTES IN A MANNER THAT IS FAIR AND TRANSPARENT

 CREATED A READILY AVAILABLE AND PROMINENTLY DISCLOSED METHOD FOR CONSUM-
 ERS  TO  BRING A DISPUTE TO THE BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER. A BUY-NOW-PAY-
 LATER LENDER SHALL MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING CONSUM-
 ER DISPUTES.
  6. USE OF CONSUMER DATA. A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER SHALL CLEARLY  AND
 CONSPICUOUSLY  DISCLOSE  OR CAUSE TO BE DISCLOSED TO A CONSUMER TO WHICH
 IT PROVIDES A LOAN HOW SUCH CONSUMER'S DATA MAY BE USED, SHARED OR  SOLD
 BY  THE  BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER.  IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER CONSENT OR
 PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS IN LAW, THE BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER SHALL  PROVIDE
 THE  CONSUMER  THE  OPPORTUNITY  TO  PROVIDE AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT TO SUCH
 COLLECTION, SALE, SHARING, AND USE OF CONSUMER DATA, PROVIDED THAT WITH-
