 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on  Energy  and  Telecommuni-
  cations
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the public service law and the public authorities law,
  in relation to creating a resilient electric vehicle  charging  system
  pilot program
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The public service law is amended by adding a  new  section
 66-x to read as follows:
  §  66-X. RESILIENT ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM.  1.
 FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION:
  (A) "RESILIENT CARBON FREE POWER GENERATION"  SHALL  MEAN  ONLY  THOSE
 GENERATING STATIONS WHICH ARE:
  (I)  MANUFACTURED, INSTALLED, AND OPERATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICA-
 BLE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS;
  (II) CONNECTED TO THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND OPERATED IN CONJUNCTION WITH
 AN ELECTRIC CORPORATION'S TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM;
  (III) OPERATED IN  COMPLIANCE  WITH  ANY  STANDARDS  AND  REQUIREMENTS
 ESTABLISHED UNDER THIS SECTION;
  (IV)  UTILIZE  A  SYNCHRONOUS  GENERATOR  WITH BLACK START CAPABILITY,
 FREQUENCY CONTROL, AND DISCONNECT CAPABILITY; AND
  (V) DO NOT INCLUDE THE ACTIVE USE OF FOSSIL  FUELS  AND  HAVE  A  NAME
 PLATE CAPACITY OF 1.5 MEGAWATTS OR LESS.
  (B)  "RESILIENT  ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SYSTEM" SHALL MEAN AN ELEC-
 TRIC VEHICLE (EV) MICROGRID DESIGNED TO PROVIDE  UNINTERRUPTED  ELECTRIC
 SERVICE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING THROUGHOUT AN EXTENDED OUTAGE.
  (C)  "EXTENDED  OUTAGE"  SHALL MEAN AN OUTAGE OF THE ELECTRIC DISTRIB-
 UTION SYSTEM THAT CONTINUES FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OR LONGER.
  (D) "UNINTERRUPTED" SHALL MEAN THAT  THE  RESILIENT  ELECTRIC  VEHICLE
 CHARGING  SYSTEM  GENERATES  ELECTRICITY  THROUGHOUT AN EXTENDED OUTAGE,
 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MOMENTARY INTERRUPTIONS  ASSOCIATED  WITH  TRANSI-
 TIONS TO AND FROM GRID PARALLEL AND GRID-ISLANDED OPERATIONS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 9086  2
 
  (E)  "EV  MICROGRID" IS A GROUP OF ENERGY GENERATING RESOURCES WITH AT
 LEAST ONE SOURCE OF RESILIENT CARBON FREE POWER  GENERATION  AND  ENERGY
 STORAGE  WITHIN  CLEARLY  DEFINED  ELECTRICAL  BOUNDARIES THAT ACTS AS A
 SINGLE CONTROLLABLE ENTITY WITH RESPECT TO THE GRID FOR THE  PURPOSE  OF
 ELECTRIC  VEHICLE  CHARGING AND OTHER EMERGENCY RESPONSE NEEDS DURING AN
 EXTENDED OUTAGE. AN EV MICROGRID CAN CONNECT  AND  DISCONNECT  FROM  THE
 GRID TO ENABLE IT TO OPERATE IN BOTH GRID-CONNECTED OR ISLAND-MODE.
  2.  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PROMULGATE SUCH RULES, POLICIES, AND PROCE-
 DURES NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE NO LATER THAN ONE  HUNDRED  EIGHTY  DAYS
 FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION FOR:
  (A)  CREATING  A  RESILIENT  ELECTRIC  VEHICLE  CHARGING  SYSTEM PILOT
 PROGRAM AT THE COMMERCIAL RETAIL RATE WITH A  MONTHLY  CASH  OUT  OPTION
 PROGRAM AND A TOTAL PROGRAM CAP OF 50 MEGAWATTS;
  (B)  ESTABLISHING  A  VALUE STACK ADDER FOR VALUATION OF UNINTERRUPTED
 RESILIENT CARBON FREE POWER GENERATION GENERATED WITHIN AN EV  MICROGRID
 THAT  IS  PARTICIPATING  IN  THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS A RESILIENT
 ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SYSTEM AT THE COMMERCIAL RETAIL RATE; AND
  (C) CREATING A TIMELY INTERCONNECTION  PROCESS  FOR  RESILIENT  CARBON
 FREE POWER GENERATION COMPRISING AN EV MICROGRID.
  § 2. Section 1005 of the public authorities law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 31 to read as follows:
  31.  THE  AUTHORITY IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH SECTION SIXTY-SIX-X OF
 THE PUBLIC SERVICE LAW,  SHALL  PROMULGATE  SUCH  RULES,  POLICIES,  AND
 PROCEDURES  NECESSARY  AND  APPROPRIATE NO LATER THAN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY
 DAYS FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION FOR:
  (A) CREATING A RESILIENT  ELECTRIC  VEHICLE  CHARGING  SYSTEM  AT  THE
 COMMERCIAL  RETAIL  RATE  WITH  A  MONTHLY CASH OUT OPTION PROGRAM AND A
 TOTAL PROGRAM CAP OF 50 MEGAWATTS;
  (B) ESTABLISHING A VALUE STACK ADDER FOR  VALUATION  OF  UNINTERRUPTED
 RESILIENT  CARBON FREE POWER GENERATION GENERATED WITHIN AN EV MICROGRID
 THAT IS ALSO A PARTICIPANT OF THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS  A  RESIL-
 IENT ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SYSTEM AT THE COMMERCIAL RETAIL RATE; AND
  (C)  CREATING  A  TIMELY  INTERCONNECTION PROCESS FOR RESILIENT CARBON
 FREE POWER GENERATION COMPRISING AN EV MICROGRID.
  § 3. Section 1020-f of the public authorities law, as added by chapter
 517 of the laws of 1986, is amended by adding a new subdivision (ll)  to
 read as follows:
  (LL)  THE AUTHORITY IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH SECTION SIXTY-SIX-X OF
 THE PUBLIC SERVICE LAW,  SHALL  PROMULGATE  SUCH  RULES,  POLICIES,  AND
 PROCEDURES  NECESSARY  AND  APPROPRIATE NO LATER THAN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY
 DAYS FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION FOR:
  1. CREATING A  RESILIENT  ELECTRIC  VEHICLE  CHARGING  SYSTEM  AT  THE
 COMMERCIAL  RETAIL  RATE  WITH A MONTHLY CASH OUT OPTION PROGRAM AND THE
 TOTAL PROGRAM CAP OF 50 MEGAWATTS;
  2. ESTABLISHING A VALUE STACK ADDER  FOR  VALUATION  OF  UNINTERRUPTED
 RESILIENT  CARBON FREE POWER GENERATION GENERATED WITHIN AN EV MICROGRID
 THAT IS ALSO A PARTICIPANT OF THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS  A  RESIL-
 IENT ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SYSTEM AT THE COMMERCIAL RETAIL RATE; AND
  3. CREATING A TIMELY INTERCONNECTION PROCESS FOR RESILIENT CARBON FREE
 POWER GENERATION COMPRISING AN EV MICROGRID.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
