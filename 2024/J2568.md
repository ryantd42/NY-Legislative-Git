BY: Senator RAMOS
 
  RECOGNIZING  the  New York Chapter of the National
  Domestic Workers Alliance
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time, this  Legislative  Body  takes  note  of
certain  organizations  whom  it  wishes  to  recognize for their valued
contributions and to publicly acknowledge  their  endeavors  which  have
enhanced the basic humanity among us all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize  the  New  York  Chapter  of  the  National  Domestic  Workers
Alliance; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on October 13, 1924, Dorothy Bolden began working as a
domestic worker at the age of nine and continued for 50  years;  in  the
early  1960s,  she  started  educating  and advocating for the rights of
domestic workers such as nannies, caregivers of the elderly,  and  house
cleaners; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1968, on the advice and encouragement of her neighbor,
Dr.  Martin Luther King,  Jr.,  Dorothy  Bolden  founded  the  National
Domestic  Workers  Union  of  America  (NDWUA);  the  NDWUA  eventually
represented more than 30,000 domestic workers across 10 cities  and  was
the  longest-surviving union of domestic workers in U.S. cities; Dorothy
Bolden helped legitimize and organize domestic workers on  a  scale  the
country  had  never  seen  before  and as a result, deserves the highest
praise and recognition for her unrelenting and admirable efforts; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, the National Domestic Workers  Alliance  and  We
Dream  in  Black  celebrate Dorothy Bolden's birthday and the legacy she
left for domestic workers; this year  marks  what  would  be  her  100th
birthday; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2010, New York became the first state to win a Domestic
Workers Bill of Rights, a benefit that undoubtedly was able to  come  to
fruition as a result of the lifelong efforts of Dorothy Bolden and other
pioneers alike; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Domestic  workers  in  New York play a pivotal role in the
country's electoral landscape, mirroring a national  trend  of  systemic
inequities that are limiting many voters to thrive in their communities,
ranging  from healthcare access to rising cost of living and a worsening
care crisis; despite New York's  pioneering  efforts,  being  the  first
state  to pass a Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, the struggle continues
for fair pay, adequate benefits, and robust legal protections; and
 
  WHEREAS, In June 2007, over 50  domestic  workers  from  across  the
country  met  in  Atlanta,  Georgia  as  part of the first United States
Social Forum (USSF) for a national domestic worker gathering; they  came
together  to  support  their  organizing  through  exchanges  and
capacity-building  and  represented  thousands  of  childcare,  house
cleaning,  and  home care workers who were organizing across the country
for dignity and justice; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  On  the  final day of the gathering these domestic workers
made a groundbreaking decision to form a  national  organization  -  the
National Domestic Worker Alliance; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York Chapter lifts up the voices and experiences of
New  York  domestic  workers through organizing, storytelling, workforce
development, and leadership development; the New York  Chapter  of  NDWA
offer  know  your  rights  trainings;  support  for  domestic workers to
recover stolen wages; leadership  trainings  and  workforce  development
trainings; and
 
  WHEREAS, Powered by a proud tradition of domestic workers tirelessly
organizing  against  long-standing  exclusion from fundamental labor law
protections,  NDWA  is  both  a  national  federation  of  70  affiliate
grassroots  organizations,  7  local chapters, and a national membership
organization where domestic workers can  connect  with  each  other  and
participate in creating social change; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National Domestic Workers Alliance's New York Chapter
members stand in the strong and proud legacy of  Dorothy  Bolden's  work
and resistance; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York Chapter of the NDWA has won a Division of Paid
Care  in  New  York City's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection;
added protections for domestic workers against sexual harassment at  the
New  York  City  and  New  York  State  level; the inclusion of domestic
workers in the first-of-its-kind Paid Safe and Sick Leave  in  NYC,  and
then extending sick days for domestic workers for a total of 5 sick days
in New York City; inclusion in the State's Paid Family Leave law so that
domestic  workers  may take maternity leave or leave to care for a loved
one; and since 2016, the organization has  recovered  over  $500,000  in
stolen  wages  for domestic workers through our domestic worker specific
legal clinic; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize  the  New  York  Chapter  of  the  National  Domestic  Workers
Alliance; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the New York Chapter of  the  National  Domestic  Workers
Alliance.
