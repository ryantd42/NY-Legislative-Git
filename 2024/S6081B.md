 offense and either:
  (a)  intentionally  selects  the  person  against  whom the offense is

 gious practice, age, disability, HOMELESSNESS, or sexual orientation  of
 a person, regardless of whether the belief or perception is correct, or

 ly  sufficient  evidence  satisfying the people's burden under paragraph
