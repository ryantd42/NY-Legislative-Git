 S. 9954  3
 
 the laws of 1977, subdivision (i) as amended by chapter 847 of the  laws
 of 1987, are amended to read as follows:
  Involuntary admission on [medical] CLINICAL certification.

 care  and  treatment,  [he] THE PHYSICIAN OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 shall consider alternative forms of care and  treatment  that  might  be
 adequate to provide for the person's needs without requiring involuntary

 care  and  treatment  has  been  under prior treatment, [he] THEY shall,
 insofar  as  [possible]  REASONABLE,  consult  with  the  physician  or

 tion,  and[,]  if such person is found to be in need of involuntary care
 and treatment, [he] THEY may be admitted thereto as a patient as  herein
 provided.

 completed and both physicians OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINERS have exam-
 ined such person and separately certified that [he or she is]  THEY  ARE
 mentally  ill  and in need of involuntary care and treatment in a hospi-
 tal, either physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER  is  authorized  to
 request peace officers, when acting pursuant to their special duties, or
 police officers[,] who are members of an authorized police department or
 force  or  of a sheriff's department, to take into custody and transport
 such person to a hospital for determination by the director whether such
 person qualifies for  admission  pursuant  to  this  section.  Upon  the
 request of either physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, an ambulance
 service,  as defined by subdivision two of section three thousand one of
 the public health law, is authorized  to  transport  such  person  to  a
 hospital for determination by the director whether such person qualifies
 for admission pursuant to this section.

 holidays, after such admission to the following:
  1.  the  nearest  relative  of  the person alleged to be mentally ill,
 other than the applicant, if there be  any  such  person  known  to  the
 director.
  2.  as  many  as three additional persons, if designated in writing to
 receive such notice by the person so admitted.
  § 6. The section heading and subdivision (a) of section  9.31  of  the
 mental hygiene law, as renumbered by chapter 978 of the laws of 1977 and
 subdivision  (a)  as  amended  by  chapter  789 of the laws of 1985, are
 amended to read as follows:
  Involuntary admission on [medical] CLINICAL  certification;  patient's
  right to a hearing.
  (a)  If,  at  any  time prior to the expiration of sixty days from the
 date of involuntary admission of a patient on an  application  supported
 by  [medical]  CLINICAL certification, [he] SUCH PATIENT or any relative
 or friend or the mental hygiene legal service gives notice in writing to
 the director of request for hearing on the question of need for involun-
 tary care and treatment, a hearing shall be held as herein provided. The
 patient or person requesting a hearing on  behalf  of  the  patient  may
 designate  the  county  where  the hearing shall be held, which shall be
 either in the county where the hospital is located, the  county  of  the
 patient's  residence,  or  the county in which the hospital to which the
 patient was first admitted is located. Such hearing shall be held in the
 county so designated, subject to application by  any  interested  party,
 including  the director, for change of venue to any other county because
 of the convenience of parties or  witnesses  or  the  condition  of  the
 patient  upon notice to the persons required to be served with notice of
 the patient's initial admission.
  § 7. Subdivision (a) of section 9.33 of the  mental  hygiene  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  789  of  the  laws  of 1985, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (a) If the director shall determine that a patient  admitted  upon  an
 application  supported  by  [medical]  CLINICAL  certification, for whom
 there is no court order authorizing retention for a specified period, is
 in need of retention and if such patient does not  agree  to  remain  in
 such  hospital  as  a voluntary patient, the director shall apply to the
 supreme court or the county court in the county where  the  hospital  is
 located  for  an order authorizing continued retention. Such application
 shall be made no later than sixty days  from  the  date  of  involuntary
 admission  on  application supported by [medical] CLINICAL certification
 or thirty days from the date of an  order  denying  an  application  for
 patient's release pursuant to section 9.31 OF THIS ARTICLE, whichever is
 later;  and  the  hospital  is authorized to retain the patient for such
 further period during which the hospital  is  authorized  to  make  such
 application or during which the application may be pending. The director
 shall  cause  written notice of such application to be given the patient
 and a copy thereof shall be given personally or by mail to  the  persons
 required  by  this  article  to  be served with notice of such patient's
 initial admission and to the mental hygiene legal service.  Such  notice
 shall  state  that  a  hearing may be requested and that failure to make
 such a request within five days, excluding Sunday and holidays, from the
 date that the notice was given to the  patient  will  permit  the  entry
 without a hearing of an order authorizing retention.

 § 9.37 Involuntary admission on certificate of a director  of  community
  services or [his] THE DIRECTOR'S designee.
  (a)  The  director  of  a  hospital, upon application by a director of
 community services or an examining physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAM-
 INER duly designated by [him or her] SUCH DIRECTOR, may receive and care
 for in such hospital as a patient any person who, in the opinion of  the
 director  of community services or the director's designee, has a mental
 illness for which immediate inpatient care and treatment in  a  hospital
 is  appropriate  and  which,  WITHOUT  TREATMENT, is likely to result in
 serious harm to [himself or herself] SELF or others.
  The need for immediate hospitalization shall be confirmed by a [staff]
 physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER ON THE STAFF  of  the  hospital
 prior to admission. Within seventy-two hours, excluding Sunday and holi-
 days,  after  such admission, if such patient is to be retained for care
 and treatment beyond such time and [he or  she]  THE  PATIENT  does  not
 agree to remain in such hospital as a voluntary patient, the certificate
 of  another  examining physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER who is a
 member of the psychiatric staff of the hospital that the patient  is  in
 need of involuntary care and treatment shall be filed with the hospital.
 From the time of [his or her] THE PATIENT'S admission under this section
 the retention of such patient for care and treatment shall be subject to
 the  provisions  for  notice,  hearing, review, and judicial approval of
 continued retention or transfer and continued retention provided by this
 article  for  the  admission  and  retention  of  involuntary  patients,
 provided  that,  for the purposes of such provisions, the date of admis-
 sion of the patient shall be deemed to be the date when the patient  was
 first received in the hospital under this section.
  (b)  The  application  for  admission  of  a  patient pursuant to this
 section shall be based upon a personal  examination  by  a  director  of
 community  services  or  [his]  THE  DIRECTOR'S designee. It shall be in
 writing and shall be filed with the director of  such  hospital  at  the
 time  of  the  patient's  reception, together with a statement in a form
 prescribed by the commissioner  giving  such  information  as  [he]  THE
 COMMISSIONER may deem appropriate.
  (c)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  (b)  of [this]
 section 41.09 OF THIS CHAPTER, in counties with  a  population  of  less
 than  two  hundred  thousand, a director of community services [who is a
 licensed psychologist pursuant to article one hundred fifty-three of the
 education law or a licensed clinical social worker pursuant  to  article
 one  hundred fifty-four of the education law but] who is not a physician
 OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER may apply for the admission of a  patient
 pursuant  to this section without [a medical] AN examination by a desig-
 nated physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, if a  hospital  approved
 by  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  section 9.39 of this article is not
 located within thirty miles of the patient, and the director of communi-
 ty services has made a reasonable effort to  locate  [a  designated]  AN
 examining  physician  OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER DESIGNATED PURSUANT
 TO SECTION 41.09 OF THIS CHAPTER but such [a] designee is not immediate-
 S. 9954  6
 
 ly available and the director  of  community  services,  after  personal
 observation of the person, reasonably believes that [he] SUCH PERSON may
 have  a  mental illness [which] THAT is likely to result in serious harm
 to  [himself]  SELF  or  others and inpatient care and treatment of such
 person in a hospital may be appropriate. In the event of an  application
 pursuant to this subdivision, a physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 of  the receiving hospital shall examine the patient and shall not admit
 the patient unless [he  or  she  determines]  THEY  DETERMINE  that  the
 patient  has  a  mental  illness  for which immediate inpatient care and
 treatment in a hospital is appropriate and [which]  THAT  is  likely  to
 result  in  serious  harm to [himself] SELF or others. If the patient is
 admitted, the need for hospitalization shall  be  confirmed  by  another
 [staff]  physician  OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL EXAMINER ON THE STAFF OF THE
 HOSPITAL within twenty-four  hours.  An  application  pursuant  to  this
 subdivision  shall be in writing and shall be filed with the director of
 such hospital at the time of the patient's reception,  together  with  a
 statement  in a form prescribed by the commissioner giving such informa-
 tion as [he] THE COMMISSIONER may deem appropriate, including  a  state-
 ment of the efforts made by the director of community services to locate
 a designated examining physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER prior to
 making an application pursuant to this subdivision.
  (d)  After signing the application, the director of community services
 or the director's designee shall be authorized  and  empowered  to  take
 into custody, detain, transport, and provide temporary care for any such
 person.  Upon  the  written  [request] DIRECTIVE of such director or the
 director's designee it shall be the duty of peace officers, when  acting
 pursuant  to their special duties, or police officers who are members of
 the state police or of an authorized police department or force or of  a
 sheriff's  department to take into custody and transport any such person
 as requested and directed by such director or designee. Upon the written
 [request] DIRECTIVE of such director or designee, an ambulance  service,
 as  defined  in  subdivision  two  of  section three thousand one of the
 public health law, is authorized to transport any such person.
  (e) Reasonable expenses incurred by the director of  community  mental
 hygiene  services  or  [his] THE DIRECTOR'S designee for the examination
 and temporary care of the patient and [his] SUCH  PATIENT'S  transporta-
 tion  to  and  from  the hospital shall be a charge upon the county from
 which the patient was admitted and shall be paid from any  funds  avail-
 able for such purposes.
  (f) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to continue
 any  patient in a hospital who has already been admitted to the hospital
 under this or any other section of this article.
  (g) If a person is examined and determined to be mentally ill the fact
 that such person suffers from  alcohol  or  substance  abuse  shall  not
 preclude commitment under this section.
  §  8-a.  Subdivision (a) of section 9.37 of the mental hygiene law, as
 renumbered by chapter 978 of the laws of 1977, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (a)  The  director  of  a  hospital, upon application by a director of
 community services or an examining physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAM-
 INER duly designated by [him] THE DIRECTOR, may receive and care for  in
 such  hospital as a patient any person who, in the opinion of the direc-
 tor of community services or [his] THE DIRECTOR'S designee, has a mental
 illness for which immediate inpatient care and treatment in  a  hospital
 is  appropriate  and  which,  WITHOUT  TREATMENT, is likely to result in
 S. 9954  7
 
 serious harm to [himself] SELF or others; "likelihood of  serious  harm"
 shall mean:
  1.  substantial  risk of physical harm to [himself] SELF as manifested
 by threats of or attempts at suicide or serious  bodily  harm  or  other
 conduct demonstrating that [he is] THEY ARE dangerous to [himself] THEM-
 SELF, or
  2.  a substantial risk of physical harm to other persons as manifested
 by homicidal or other violent behavior by which  others  are  placed  in
 reasonable fear or serious physical harm.
  The need for immediate hospitalization shall be confirmed by a [staff]
 physician  OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL EXAMINER ON THE STAFF of the hospital
 prior to admission. Within seventy-two hours, excluding Sunday and holi-
 days, after such admission, if such patient is to be retained  for  care
 and  treatment  beyond  such time and [he] THE PATIENT does not agree to
 remain in such hospital as  a  voluntary  patient,  the  certificate  of
 another  examining  physician  OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL EXAMINER who is a
 member of the psychiatric staff of the hospital that the patient  is  in
 need of involuntary care and treatment shall be filed with the hospital.
 From  the  time of [his] THE  PATIENT'S admission under this section the
 retention of such patient for care and treatment shall be subject to the
 provisions for notice, hearing, review, and judicial approval of contin-
 ued retention or transfer and continued retention provided by this arti-
 cle for the admission and retention of  involuntary  patients,  provided
 that,  for the purposes of such provisions, the date of admission of the
 patient shall be deemed to be  the  date  when  the  patient  was  first
 received in the hospital under this section.
  §  9.  Section  9.39  of  the mental hygiene law, as renumbered by and
 subdivision (c) as added by chapter 978 of the laws of 1977, and  subdi-
 vision  (a) as amended by chapter 789 of the laws of 1985, is amended to
 read as follows:
 § 9.39 Emergency admissions for immediate observation, care, and  treat-
  ment.
  (a) The director of any hospital maintaining adequate staff and facil-
 ities  for  the observation, examination, care, and treatment of persons
 alleged to be mentally ill and approved by the commissioner  to  receive
 and  retain  patients  pursuant  to  this section may receive and retain
 therein as a patient for a period of fifteen days any person alleged  to
 have  a mental illness for which immediate observation, care, and treat-
 ment in a hospital is appropriate and which is likely to result in seri-
 ous harm to [himself] SELF or others. "Likelihood to result  in  serious
 harm" as used in this article shall mean:
  1.  substantial  risk of physical harm to [himself] SELF as manifested
 by threats of or attempts at suicide or serious  bodily  harm  or  other
 conduct demonstrating that [he is] THEY ARE dangerous to [himself] THEM-
 SELF, or
  2.  a substantial risk of physical harm to other persons as manifested
 by homicidal or other violent behavior by which  others  are  placed  in
 reasonable fear of serious physical harm.
  The  director  shall cause to be entered upon the hospital records the
 name of the person or persons, if any, who have brought such  person  to
 the  hospital and the details of the circumstances leading to the hospi-
 talization of such person.
  The director shall admit such person pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 this  section only if a [staff] physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 ON THE STAFF of the hospital upon examination of such person finds  that
 such  person  qualifies  under  the  requirements  of this section. Such
 S. 9954  8
 
 person shall not be retained for a period of more than forty-eight hours
 unless within such period such finding is confirmed after examination by
 another physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER who shall be  a  member
 of  the  psychiatric staff of the hospital. Such person shall be served,
 at the time of admission, with written notice  of  [his]  SUCH  PERSON'S
 status  and  rights  as  a patient under this section. Such notice shall
 contain the patient's name. At the same time, such notice shall also  be
 given  to  the mental hygiene legal service and personally or by mail to
 such person or persons, not to exceed three in number, as may be  desig-
 nated  in  writing  to  receive  such notice by the person alleged to be
 mentally ill. If at any time after admission, the patient, any relative,
 friend, or the mental hygiene legal service gives notice to the director
 in writing of request for court hearing on  the  question  of  need  for
 immediate  observation,  care, and treatment, a hearing shall be held as
 herein provided as soon as practicable but in any event  not  more  than
 five  days  after such request is received, except that the commencement
 of such hearing may be adjourned at the request of the patient. It shall
 be the duty of the director upon receiving notice of  such  request  for
 hearing  to forward forthwith a copy of such notice with a record of the
 patient to the supreme court or county court in the  county  where  such
 hospital  is  located.  A  copy  of such notice and record shall also be
 given the mental hygiene legal service. The court [which] THAT  receives
 such  notice shall fix the date of such hearing and cause the patient or
 other person requesting the hearing, the director,  the  mental  hygiene
 legal  service  and  such other persons as the court may determine to be
 advised of such date. Upon such date, or upon such other date  to  which
 the  proceeding  may  be  adjourned,  the court shall hear testimony and
 examine the person alleged to be mentally ill, if it be deemed advisable
 in or out of court, and shall render a decision in writing that there is
 reasonable cause to believe that the patient has a  mental  illness  for
 which  immediate inpatient care and treatment in a hospital is appropri-
 ate and [which] THAT is likely to result in serious  harm  to  [himself]
 SELF or others. If it be determined that there is such reasonable cause,
 the  court  shall  forthwith issue an order authorizing the retention of
 such patient for any such purpose or purposes  in  the  hospital  for  a
 period  not  to exceed fifteen days from the date of admission. Any such
 order entered by the court shall not be deemed  to  be  an  adjudication
 that the patient is mentally ill, but only a determination that there is
 reasonable cause to retain the patient for the purposes of this section.
  (b) Within fifteen days of arrival at the hospital, if a determination
 is  made  that  the person is not in need of involuntary care and treat-
 ment, [he] SUCH PERSON shall  be  discharged  unless  [he]  SUCH  PERSON
 agrees to remain as a voluntary or informal patient. If [he] SUCH PERSON
 is  in  need  of  involuntary  care  and treatment and does not agree to
 remain as a voluntary or informal  patient,  [he]  SUCH  PERSON  may  be
 retained beyond such fifteen day period only by admission to such hospi-
 tal or another appropriate hospital pursuant to the provisions governing
 involuntary  admission  on  application  supported by [medical] CLINICAL
 certification and subject to the provisions for notice, hearing, review,
 and judicial approval of retention or transfer and  retention  governing
 such admissions, provided that, for the purposes of such provisions, the
 date of admission of the patient shall be deemed to be the date when the
 patient  was  first  received  under this section. If a hearing has been
 requested pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a) OF THIS SECTION,
 the filing of an application  for  involuntary  admission  on  [medical]
 S. 9954  9
 
 CLINICAL  certification  shall  not  delay or prevent the holding of the
 hearing.
  (c) If a person is examined and determined to be mentally ill the fact
 that  such  person  suffers  from  alcohol  or substance abuse shall not
 preclude commitment under this section.
  § 10. Subdivisions (a-1), (b) and (c) of section 9.40  of  the  mental
 hygiene  law,  subdivision (a-1) as added and subdivision (b) as amended
 by section 2 of part PPP of chapter 58 of the laws of  2020, and  subdi-
 vision  (c)  as added by chapter 723 of the laws of 1989, are amended to
 read as follows:
  (a-1) The director shall cause triage  and  referral  services  to  be
 provided by a psychiatric nurse practitioner or physician of the program

 cause shown. In granting adjournments, the court shall consider the need

 ly. The court shall cause the subject of the petition, any other  person
 receiving  notice pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, the peti-
 tioner, the physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER  whose  affirmation
 or  affidavit  accompanied  the  petition, and such other persons as the

 physician  OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL  EXAMINER,  the court may request the
 subject to consent to an examination by a physician OR  QUALIFIED  CLIN-
 ICAL  EXAMINER  appointed  by  the court. If the subject of the petition
 does not consent and the court finds reasonable cause  to  believe  that
 the  allegations  in  the  petition  are true, the court may order peace
 S. 9954  15
 
 officers, acting pursuant to their special duties,  or  police  officers
 who  are  members of an authorized police department or force[,] or of a

 IFIED  CLINICAL  EXAMINER  may  consult  with the physician OR QUALIFIED
 CLINICAL EXAMINER whose affirmation or affidavit accompanied  the  peti-
 tion  as  to  whether the subject meets the criteria for assisted outpa-
 tient treatment.

 recommended  assisted  outpatient  treatment  includes  medication, such
 physician's testimony shall describe the types or classes of  medication
 which  should  be  authorized,  shall describe the beneficial and detri-
 mental physical and mental effects of such medication, and shall  recom-
 mend whether such medication should be self-administered or administered
 by authorized personnel].

 clinical judgment of a physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, (i) the

 outpatient  treatment, (ii) efforts were made to solicit compliance, and
 (iii) such assisted outpatient may be in need of  involuntary  admission
 to  a  hospital  pursuant  to  section 9.27 of this article or immediate
 observation, care and treatment pursuant to section 9.39 or 9.40 of this
 article, such physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER may  request  the
 appropriate  director of community services, the director's designee, or
 any physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER designated by the  director
 of  community  services  pursuant  to  section  9.37 of this article, to
 direct the removal of such assisted outpatient to an appropriate  hospi-
 tal  for an examination to determine if such person has a mental illness
 for which hospitalization is necessary pursuant to section 9.27, 9.39 or
 9.40 of this article. Furthermore, if such assisted  outpatient  refuses
 to  take medications as required by the court order, or [he or she] SUCH
 OUTPATIENT refuses to take, or fails a blood test, urinalysis, or  alco-
 hol or drug test as required by the court order, such physician OR QUAL-
 IFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER may consider such refusal or failure when deter-
 mining  whether  the assisted outpatient is in need of an examination to
 determine whether [he or she] SUCH OUTPATIENT has a mental  illness  for
 S. 9954  16
 
 which  hospitalization  is necessary. Upon the request of such physician
 OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, the appropriate director, the director's
 designee, or any physician OR  QUALIFIED  CLINICAL  EXAMINER  designated
 pursuant  to  section  9.37  of this article, may direct peace officers,
 acting pursuant to their special duties,  or  police  officers  who  are
 members  of  an  authorized police department or force or of a sheriff's
 department to take the assisted outpatient into  custody  and  transport
 [him  or  her]  SUCH  OUTPATIENT  to the hospital operating the assisted
 outpatient treatment program or to any hospital authorized by the direc-
 tor of community services to receive such persons. Such law  enforcement
 officials  shall  carry  out  such  directive.  Upon the request of such
 physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER, the appropriate director,  the
 director's  designee,  or  any  physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER
 designated pursuant to  section  9.37  of  this  article,  an  ambulance
 service,  as defined by subdivision two of section three thousand one of
 the public health law, or an approved mobile  crisis  outreach  team  as
 defined in section 9.58 of this article shall be authorized to take into
 custody  and  transport  any  such  person to the hospital operating the
 assisted outpatient treatment program, or to any other hospital  author-
 ized  by  the appropriate director of community services to receive such
 persons. Any director of  community  services,  or  designee,  shall  be
 authorized  to direct the removal of an assisted outpatient who is pres-
 ent in [his or her] SUCH DIRECTOR'S county to an  appropriate  hospital,
 in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of this subdivision, based upon a
 determination of the appropriate director of community services  direct-
 ing  the  removal  of such assisted outpatient pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion. Such person may be retained for observation,  care  and  treatment
 and  further  examination in the hospital for up to seventy-two hours to
 permit a physician OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER to  determine  whether
 such  person has a mental illness and is in need of involuntary care and
 treatment in a hospital pursuant to the provisions of this article.  Any
 continued  involuntary  retention  in  such  hospital beyond the initial
 seventy-two hour period shall be in accordance with  the  provisions  of
 this  article  relating  to the involuntary admission and retention of a
 person. If at any time during the seventy-two hour period the person  is
 determined  not  to  meet  the  involuntary  admission  and  retention
 provisions of this article, and does not agree to stay in  the  hospital
 as  a voluntary or informal patient, [he or she] SUCH OUTPATIENT must be
 released. Failure to comply with an order of assisted outpatient  treat-
 ment  shall not be grounds for involuntary civil commitment or a finding
 of contempt of court.
  § 19. The mental hygiene law is amended by adding a new  section  9.64
 to read as follows:
 § 9.64 NOTICE OF ADMISSION DETERMINATION TO COMMUNITY PROVIDER.
  UPON  A  DETERMINATION  BY  A PHYSICIAN OR QUALIFIED CLINICAL EXAMINER

 COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY PROGRAM, THE DIRECTOR OF SUCH HOSPI-
 TAL OR PROGRAM SHALL ENSURE THAT REASONABLE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO IDENTIFY
 AND  PROMPTLY  NOTIFY  OF  SUCH  DETERMINATION ANY COMMUNITY PROVIDER OF
 MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT MAINTAINS SUCH PERSON ON ITS CASELOAD.

 was authorized, if, in the director's judgment, the patient needs in-pa-
 tient care and treatment and the conditional release is no longer appro-
 priate;  provided,  however,  that  in any such case, the director shall
 cause written notice of such patient's return to be given to the  mental
 hygiene  legal  service.  The  director  shall  cause  the patient to be
 retained for observation, care and treatment and further examination  in
 a hospital for up to seventy-two hours if a physician OR QUALIFIED CLIN-
 ICAL  EXAMINER  on the staff of the hospital determines that such person
 may have a mental illness and may be in need  of  involuntary  care  and
 treatment  in  a  hospital pursuant to the provisions of article nine of
 this chapter. Any  continued  retention  in  such  hospital  beyond  the
