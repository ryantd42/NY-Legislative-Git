  CONGRATULATING  Theresa  M.  Pristera  upon  the
  occasion of celebrating her 100th Birthday
 
  WHEREAS, Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and  knowledge
to  the  increasingly  active  roles they play in today's society; their
past contributions and future participation are a  vital  part  of,  and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the custom of this Legislative Body to commemorate
and recognize certain milestones celebrated by citizens  of  this  great
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
congratulate Theresa M. Pristera upon the occasion of her 100th Birthday
to be celebrated Saturday, March 2, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Theresa  "Tree"  Froio,  of  Rome,  New  York, was born to
Bernard Froio and Theresa Tallerino on March 2, 1924; she grew  up  with
nine  siblings:  six  brothers,  Tony,  Patsy, Ralph, Joseph, Tubby, and
Benny; and three sisters, Mary, Catherine, and Connie; and
 
  WHEREAS, At a young age, Theresa M. Froio realized that  she  needed
to work to financially contribute to the household and obtain goods that
she and her family needed; her first job was in the bean lots, succeeded
by working in the local mills; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Shortly  after  graduating from Rome Free Academy in 1942,
Theresa M. Froio took a train trip with her  sisters,  Connie  and  Kay,
from  Rome  to Utica; at Utica's train station, she met a sailor, Carmen
T. Pristera; they were married on October 23, 1947, in Rome; and
 
  WHEREAS, The following year the couple started their family, blessed
with their first son, Carmen J., followed by Anthony's arrival two years
later; Theresa M. Pristera became homesick so they moved from  Utica  to
Rome where Bernice was born in 1952, followed by David in 1957; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Working for 20 years at Carl's Drug Store made it possible
for Theresa M. Pristera to monetarily contribute toward the purchase  of
a  ranch  home  on  four  acres  of land; some time later, her husband's
health forced him to retire which prompted her to retire  so  she  could
care for him; she also tirelessly helped care for her grandchildren; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  43  years  of  marriage, Carmen T. Pristera died on
October 28, 1990, at the age of 64; and
 
  WHEREAS, Theresa  M.  Pristera  has  witnessed  many  pandemics  and
plagues  as  well as their medical cures; she credits taking care of her
health as the reason she has lived such a long and fulfilled  life;  she
has  had  the opportunity to enjoy time with her 11 grandchildren and 17
great-grandchildren; she remains independent, still shopping for her own
groceries; and
 
  WHEREAS, Theresa M. Pristera, with her zest for life,  has  inspired
and enhanced the lives of her family and friends; and
 
  WHEREAS, This exceptional centenarian has experienced the incredible
joys  and  sorrows  characteristic  of  and  reserved for those with the
stamina and courage to savor a full life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Theresa M. Pristera has enriched the lives of those  around
her  through  her  joyous  and  sincere  love for others and through the
vibrant charm and infinite wisdom which come only  from  a  fullness  of
years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of  this Legislative Body to publicly
recognize those who have reached such a  remarkable  age  and  who  have
witnessed  and  celebrated  the  innovations, cultural developments, and
outstanding achievements of this Nation during the last  century,  while
themselves  contributing  to  the  growth  and  excellence of this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  Theresa  M.  Pristera upon the occasion of celebrating her
100th Birthday; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Theresa M. Pristera.
