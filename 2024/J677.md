  COMMEMORATING  the  observance  of Portugal Day in
  the State of New York, on June 10, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions,  to  recognize  and  pay tribute to those
events which foster ethnic pride and enhance  the  profile  of  cultural
diversity  which  strengthens  the fabric of the communities of New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the observance of Portugal Day in the State of New York,  on
June 10, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every 10th day of June, the Portuguese diaspora around the
world observes Portugal Day, their national  holiday  known  as  Dia  de
Portugal which celebrates the history and heritage of Portugal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Portuguese American community in New York has been an
integral part of our great state since its inception with long  standing
community centers in Mineola, Yonkers, Farmingdale, Brooklyn, Manhattan,
New Rochelle, Tarrytown, Ossining, and Mount Vernon among others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This date also commemorates the death of Luis de Camoes, a
significant figure in the history of Portugal; he is best known for  his
work  on  Lusiadas,  the national epic poem of Portugal which celebrates
the nation's successes and rich history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since then, the country's national day was established  and
subsequently  celebrated on June 10th; it is because of uncertainties on
Camoes' birth date that Portugal Day was established to commemorate  the
hero's death; and
 
  WHEREAS, The borders of the Nation of Portugal were defined in 1143,
making  it  one  of  the oldest nations in the world; in fact, Lisbon is
actually four centuries older than Rome; and
 
  WHEREAS, Portuguese is one of the 10 most spoken  languages  in  the
world,  with  over 250 million Portuguese speakers around the globe, and
is the official language in nine countries, Brazil, Mozambique,  Angola,
Portugal,  Guinea-Bissau,  East  Timor,  Equatorial  Guinea, Macau, Cape
Verde, Sao Tome, and Principle; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2021, Portugal came in 4th place  on  the  Global  Peace
Index  (GPI), making it one of the most peaceful countries in the world;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Portugal is a European leader  in  sustainable  energy;  in
March  of  2018,  Portugal  generated  100 percent of its energy through
renewable sources such as hydro, wind, and solar power; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2020, Portugal ranked as the 4th green  country  in  the
European  Union  across  six  categories,  including  waste,  energy,
 
greenhouse gases, air quality, fresh water, and natural  land;  Portugal
was  also  among  the  first  countries  in the world to set 2050 carbon
neutrality goals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  July 1, 2001, Portugal became the first country in the
world to decriminalize all drugs; today, the country  has  some  of  the
lowest drug usage rates in the European Union, where most countries hold
criminalization models; and
 
  WHEREAS, Portugal is home to the world's largest cork forest, making
up  34  percent  of  the world's area of cork forests and producing more
than 50 percent of the world's cork supply; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to its many achievements and low cost of living and tax
incentives, retirees  from  all  over  the  world  settle  in  Portugal;
retirees  can  make  use of the NHR regime, a quality healthcare system,
and an all-around high standard of living; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, tourists also travel to Portugal,  approximately
eight  million of which visit the site of the Fatima apparitions and the
Miracle of the Sun; in  1917,  three  shepherd  children  witnessed  the
apparition  of  Mary,  the  Mother  of Jesus, six times over six months;
these three apparitions and the spread of the  messages  throughout  the
city  culminated  in the Miracle of the Sun, allegedly witnessed by over
70,000 people; and now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the observance of Portugal Day in the State of New York, on
June 10, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Luisa  Pais Lowe, the Consul General of Portugal in New
York.
