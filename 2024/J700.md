  COMMEMORATING  the  80th  Anniversary  of the Port
  Chester Carver Center
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  organizations that contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  80th Anniversary of the Port Chester Carver Center, to
be celebrated on Saturday, April 22, 2023, at their "A  Lasting  Legacy"
Benefit; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Port  Chester  Carver  Center  has  been  serving the
community's children and  families  since  1943,  starting  as  a  small
storefront  after  school  program  for children whose parents worked in
wartime defense plants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  founders  were  African  American  parents  who  were
grassroots  organizers  and advocates for the minority community in Port
Chester; they named the organization after the renowned African American
scientist George Washington Carver, who passed away in 1943; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the organization's distinguished history, spanning  80
years,  The  Carver  Center  grew  to a small food pantry and child care
program that operated out of a rented synagogue  basement  for  over  50
years;  today  their  programs  serve  a  wide  range  of  Port  Chester
residents, including children, teens, adults, and senior citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of The Carver Center is in  direct  correlation
to  the  efforts of its hardworking and dedicated staff, all of whom are
considered  integral  parts  of  the  success  of  the  Center;  their
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in all endeavors on behalf of the business and the community
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and state economies, and its vibrant role in improving  the  quality  of
life  in  its  community, fully confident that it will continue to enjoy
the sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 80th Anniversary of the Port Chester Carver Center;  and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Port Chester Carver Center.
