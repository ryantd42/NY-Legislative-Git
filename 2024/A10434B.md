 AN ACT authorizing Kolel Rachmistrivka to receive retroactive real prop-
  erty tax exempt status

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor  of the town of Ramapo is hereby authorized to accept from
 Kolel Rachmistrivka an application  for  exemption  from  real  property
 taxes  pursuant  to  section  420-a  of  the  real property tax law with
 respect to the 2023-2024 assessment rolls for  a  portion  of  the  2023
 school  taxes  and all of the 2024 general taxes for the parcel conveyed
 to such organization located at 2 Hopal Lane, hamlet of Monsey, town  of
 Ramapo, county of Rockland, otherwise known as Rockland county parcel ID
 section  56.07  block  4  lot  38. If accepted, the application shall be
 reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxable status date
 established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval by the town board of Ramapo, may make appropriate correction to
 the  subject  rolls. If such exemption is granted and such organization,
 therefore, shall have paid any tax with respect to  the  subject  rolls,
 the  applicable  governing  body  or  tax  department  may,  in its sole
 discretion, provide for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel  those
 taxes, fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
