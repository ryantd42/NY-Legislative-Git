 Introduced  by COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. McGowan) --

 AN ACT authorizing Kolel Rachmistrivka to receive retroactive real prop-
  erty tax exempt status
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor  of the town of Ramapo is hereby authorized to accept from
 Kolel Rachmistrivka an application  for  exemption  from  real  property
 taxes  pursuant  to  section  420-a  of  the  real property tax law with
 respect to the 2024-2025 assessment rolls all of  the  2024-2025  school
 taxes  and all of the 2025 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such
 organization located at 2 Hopal Lane, hamlet of Monsey, town of  Ramapo,
 county of Rockland, otherwise known as Rockland county parcel ID section
 56.07  block 4 lot 38. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as
 if it had been received on or before the taxable status date established
 for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval by the town board of Ramapo, may make appropriate correction to
 the  subject  rolls. If such exemption is granted and such organization,
 therefore, shall have paid any tax with respect to  the  subject  rolls,
 the  applicable  governing  body  or  tax  department  may,  in its sole
 discretion, provide for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel  those
 taxes, fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
