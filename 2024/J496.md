  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 10, 2023, as Dragonfly Day in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
official days established to increase awareness of serious issues; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 10, 2023, as Dragonfly Day in the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dragonflies  are  a  sentinel  species; their presence (or
absence) is indicative of the health  of  our  wetland  ecosystems,  and
whether  harmful  chemicals  such  as pesticides, nitrogen, or bacterial
contamination and pathogens, are present; and
 
  WHEREAS, Efforts to control mosquito populations with pesticides and
wetland modifications disrupt marine and terrestrial food webs;  certain
forms of wetland modifications may compromise the ability of wetlands to
remain  resilient  to  the impacts of climate change; more science-based
studies are needed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ecosystem services include: flood and storm water  control,
surface  and  ground  water  protection,  carbon  sequestration, erosion
control, water and air  filtration,  flood  and  extreme  weather  event
buffers,  habitat  for  a  range of plant and animal species, as well as
providing food and spawning; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wetlands  are  compromised  when  infrastructure  is  built
directly adjacent to wetland areas; coastal wetlands need room to expand
and  migrate  inland  as  the  sea level rises and severe weather events
increase; and
 
  WHEREAS, Developments on tidal wetlands, dredging and  hardening  of
the  shoreline  prevent  important  tidal flows that are part of dynamic
sediment systems needed to sustain wetland areas;  reduced  tidal  flows
mean  reductions  in  ecosystem  services  such  as  sediment retention,
nutrient and organic matter recycling, storm, flood and sea  level  rise
buffers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Healthy  tidal  and  freshwater  wetlands not only provide
ecosystem  services,  habitat  and  sources  of  food  for  marine  and
terrestrial  animals,  but  provide  resiliency  to our coastal areas by
absorbing  wave  energy,  storm  surges  and  floodwater  protecting
infrastructure and saving lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Freshwater wetland areas that are polluted by storm runoff,
mowed  or  modified  will  have  diminished  ecosystem  services  and
biodiversity loss and may become breeding grounds of  new  vector  borne
diseases that flourish as temperatures increase in the years ahead; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Scientific nature-based solutions offer powerful tools for
addressing climate change related  hazards  including  biodiversity  and
 
ecosystem  loss;  dragonflies  like  damselflies,  birds  and  bats  are
voracious predators but they are diminishing in numbers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be done to protect wetland  ecosystems
and  dragonfly  habitat  at  the  local, State and national levels; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  10,  2023,  as
Dragonfly Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
