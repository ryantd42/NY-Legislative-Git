  HONORING  Carl  Wheat  upon  the  occasion  of his
  designation for special recognition after  50  years
  of  dedicated  service  to  the  West  Winfield Fire
  Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are inspired  by,  and
indebted  to,  our  noble  firefighters  who exhibit courage and bravery
every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Carl Wheat
upon the occasion of his designation for special  recognition  after  50
years of dedicated service to the West Winfield Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Carl  Wheat  has  consistently  demonstrated  a  level  of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity,  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the firefighting service; and
 
  WHEREAS, A member of the West Winfield Fire Department since January
of 1974, Carl Wheat has served to protect his community from the hazards
to life and property as an EMT, ambulance driver, and fire policeman; he
has  also  fulfilled  his role as Secretary on the department's Board of
Directors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Active in his community, Carl  Wheat  is  a  West  Winfield
Village  Board  Member;  he  gives  his  time, energy, and dedication to
churches and the Rotary Club; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected men and women are often the  first
to  respond  to  an  emergency,  whether  the  emergency  is  a  fire,
transportation accident, natural disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others, and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Carl Wheat is such a firefighter; throughout his  50  years  of  devoted
service,  he  heroically  performed,  above and beyond the call of duty,
those responsibilities which define the task of  fire  protection;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Carl Wheat upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition  after  50  years  of dedicated service to the West Winfield
Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Carl Wheat.
