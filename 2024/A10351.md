 inal  action  on  the ground that the defendant is financially unable to
 retain counsel, the court may in its discretion at the time of  sentenc-
 ing entertain an application to grant the defendant [poor person relief]
 WAIVER OF COSTS, FEES, AND EXPENSES on appeal. As part of an application
 for  such  relief,  assigned  counsel  must represent that the defendant
 continues to be eligible for assignment of counsel and that granting the
 application will expedite the appeal. If the court grants  the  applica-
 tion,  it  shall  file  a  written order and shall provide a copy of the
 order to the appropriate appellate court. The denial of  an  application
 shall  not  preclude the defendant from making a de novo application for
 [poor person relief] WAIVER OF COSTS, FEES, AND EXPENSES to  the  appro-
 priate appellate court.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
