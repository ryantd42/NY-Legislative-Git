orientation, age, religious identities, and more; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born in Manila, Philippines, Michael Gamilla moved  to  the
United  States  as  an  adult;  upon  settling  in Upstate New York, his
passion for arts and culture, and his desire to be active in the  LGBTQ+
community led him to ImageOut, the Rochester LGBT Film Festival where he
has  been  a  loyal volunteer for 20 years and served as its Programming
Director for the past 19 years; and

the Western New York and Rochester Region; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, he also created the ImageOut There! Series as
a sidebar to introduce the festival audience  to  content  that  may  be
hard-hitting,  challenging,  edgy,  and  perhaps,  even  innovative,  as
opposed to the usual festival fare; and
 
  WHEREAS, Michael Gamilla also renewed the festival's  dedication  to
