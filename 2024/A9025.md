 AN  ACT  to  amend the general municipal law, in relation to authorizing
  matching funding  for  savings  achieved  for  actions  between  local
  governments that are later included as part of an approved county-wide
  shared services plan

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 8 of section 239-bb of  the  general  municipal
 law,  as  amended by chapter 717 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read
 as follows:
  8. For each county, new shared services actions  in  an  approved  and
 submitted  plan  pursuant  to this section or part BBB of chapter fifty-
 nine of the laws of two thousand seventeen, may be eligible for  funding
 to  match  savings from such action, subject to available appropriation.
 Savings that are actually and demonstrably realized by the participating
 local governments are eligible for matching funding.  For actions  that
 are  part  of  an approved plan transmitted to the secretary of state in
 accordance with paragraph  b  of  subdivision  seven  of  this  section,
 savings achieved during either: (i) January first through December thir-
 ty-first  from new actions implemented on or after January first through
 December thirty-first of the year immediately following an approved  and
 transmitted  plan,  or (ii) July first of the year immediately following
 an approved and transmitted plan through June thirtieth  of  the  subse-
 quent  year  from  new  actions implemented July first of the year imme-
 diately following an approved plan through June thirtieth of the  subse-
 quent  year  may  be eligible for matching funding. SAVINGS ACHIEVED FOR
 ACTIONS BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE LATER INCLUDED AS A  PART  OF
 AN APPROVED PLAN TRANSMITTED TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHALL BE ELIGIBLE
 FOR  MATCHING  FUNDING.  Only  net savings between local governments for
 each action would be eligible for matching funding. Savings from  inter-
 nal efficiencies or any other action taken by a local government without
 the  participation  of  another  local  government  are not eligible for
 matching funding. Each county and all of the  local  governments  within

 approved plan must collectively apply for the matching funding and agree
