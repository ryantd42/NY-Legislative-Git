Senate Resolution No. 1683
 
BY: Senator KENNEDY
 
  RECOGNIZING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the
  establishment of diplomatic  relations  between  the
  United States of America and Ireland
 
  WHEREAS,  A century ago, on October 7, 1924, Ireland formally opened
diplomatic relations with the United States of America  when  Ambassador
Timothy  Smiddy  presented his credentials to President Calvin Coolidge;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Following the Irish people's long and painful struggle  for
independence,  the  United  States  was  one  of  the  first  nations to
recognize  the  fledgling  Irish  state  earlier  that  year,  and  when
Ambassador  Smiddy emerged from the White House, he had become Ireland's
first ambassador to any country in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, It was very appropriate that Ireland's first representative
overseas should be dispatched to Washington, D.C.; while 1924 marked the
beginning  of  formal  diplomatic  relations,  the  deep  Irish-American
connection already dated back centuries at that time; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  nearly one-tenth of Americans identify as being of
Irish ancestry; Irish immigrants helped build the America we know  today
from  the  skyscrapers of Manhattan and the transcontinental railroad to
our modern political system; and
 
  WHEREAS, Irish people have made an enormous contribution  to  public
debate  and  politics  in  America,  from their local communities to the
White House; more than twenty American  Presidents  claimed  some  Irish
ancestry;  the  influence  of Irish America extends well beyond the Oval
Office and the United States Capitol to every state of the nation,  most
evident  by  the  significant  number  of  state  legislators within the
American Ireland State Legislators Caucus; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since Timothy  Smiddy's  momentous  audience  in  the  Oval
Office  100  years  ago,  a  further  eighteen  Irish  Ambassadors  have
presented credentials to  United  States  presidents;  over  this  time,
Ireland's  relations  with the United States have evolved significantly;
from an impoverished and  internationally  isolated  state,  scarred  by
years  of  conflict,  Ireland has transformed over the past century into
the economically prosperous and culturally vibrant  peaceful  nation  of
today; and
 
  WHEREAS, This transformation is due to the support of friends in the
United  States,  from the crucial role America played in brokering peace
in Northern Ireland, culminating with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, to
the substantial American  economic  investment  in  Ireland;  there  are
almost 1,000 American companies in Ireland employing over 200,000 people
directly;  our  economic  relationship  is truly two-way as some 100,000
people are employed  in  the  United  States  by  over  650  Irish-owned
companies  across  every state; indeed, Ireland is now the ninth largest
source of foreign direct investment in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American-Irish relationship is a shining example of how
ancestral ties, historical connections, cultural affinities, and  shared
values  can  create  a  foundation  for  enduring partnership and mutual
prosperity; Irish American state legislators across  the  United  States
are  playing  a vitally important role in fostering this partnership and
ensuring that it continues and flourishes for another century  to  come;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize the 100th  Anniversary  of  the  establishment  of  diplomatic
relations  between  the  United States of America and Ireland; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the members of the Irish-American caucus.
