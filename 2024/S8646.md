 released  on  his or her own recognizance or under appropriate non-mone-
 tary conditions; [or]

 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a
 firearm  as  defined  in  section  265.01-b  of the penal law where such
 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned  after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a separate

 or property, provided, however, that the prosecutor must show reasonable
 cause  to believe that the defendant committed the instant crime and any
 underlying crime. For the purposes of  this  subparagraph,  any  of  the
 underlying  crimes  need  not be a qualifying offense as defined in this
 subdivision. For the purposes of this paragraph, "harm to  an  identifi-
 able person or property" shall include but not be limited to theft of or

 activity, the principal shall be released on his or her own recognizance
 or under appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]
  (xxi)  criminal  possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined
 in subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale
