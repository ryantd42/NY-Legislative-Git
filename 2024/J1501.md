  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of Chuckery
  Tire & Equipment/Warner Sales &  Service,  Inc.,  of
  Clinton and Rome, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially  to  the  economic  vitality of their communities, thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of  Chuckery  Tire  &  Equipment/Warner
Sales & Service, Inc.; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1974,  Dick Warner opened Chuckery Tire & Equipment in
Clinton,  New  York;  at  its  inception,  the  company  predominantly
concentrated on farm equipment and tire needs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bobcat  Skid  Steer  Loaders  was added to Chuckery Tire's
product line in 1976; through the years, Dick Warner's  son,  Eric,  and
daughter, Lynne, joined the family business; in 1985, the three partners
were  successful  enough to open a second location, named Warner Sales &
Service, in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1988, a fire destroyed Chuckery Tire, resulting  in  the
closure  of  that  component  of  the establishment; all operations were
moved to join Warner Sales & Service at its site in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Carrying on the tradition  of  hard  work  and  persistence
learned from their father's example, Eric and Lynne have assisted in the
growth  of  this  pillar  of  the  community;  their  strong work ethic,
honesty, and courteous service resulted in a strong and enduring  legacy
that has lasted half a century; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over time, focusing on customers' needs and endeavoring to
meet those demands produced  a  successful  business  in  a  competitive
market; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pride that Eric and Lynne, along with
their hard-working and dedicated staff members, celebrate this milestone
50th  Anniversary  and  anticipate  many  more  years  of  success  for
generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS, The progression of Chuckery Tire & Equipment/Warner Sales &
Service, Inc., is in direct correlation to the efforts of its owners and
employees,  whose  involvement is, and always has been, characterized by
an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of  the  business  and
the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business, its contributions to  the  local
and  state  economies,  and its vibrant role in improving the quality of
 
life in its community, fully confident that it will  continue  to  enjoy
the  sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of  Chuckery  Tire  &  Equipment/Warner
Sales & Service, Inc.; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Dick and Eric Warner and Lynne Stocker.
