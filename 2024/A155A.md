 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to establishing  applica-
  tion  processing  and  review requirements for reprieves, commutations
  and pardons
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Clemency Justice Act of 2023".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds
 that  families  and  communities  are  frequently  torn apart due to the
 United States' overzealous legal system and immigration system, and that
 one of the predominant tools to mitigate this issue, executive clemency,
 is grossly underused. Between 2017-2020, the governor's office  received
 6,405 clemency applications while only granting 81 pardons and 14 commu-
 tations.  The  legislature  further  finds  that the clemency process is
 convoluted, unequal, and difficult to navigate with no  way  for  appli-
 cants to check the status of their application or expedite it in case of
 an  emergency.  Meanwhile, an estimated 9,000 people, of which the over-
 whelming majority are people of color, are serving life sentences  while
 an  unprecedented  pandemic  ravages  prisons  and  detention centers. A
 simpler, more holistic approach to  granting  clemency  would  begin  to
 address  the  systemic  injustices of the immigration and criminal legal
 systems.
  § 3. The executive law is amended by adding a new section 15-a to read
 as follows:
  § 15-A. PROCESS AND  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  CONSIDERING  APPLICATIONS  AND
 REQUESTS  FOR REPRIEVES, COMMUTATIONS AND PARDONS. 1. UPON RECEIPT OF AN

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 PROVIDE TO THE APPLICANT:
  A. A WRITTEN NOTIFICATION THAT THE APPLICATION HAS BEEN RECEIVED;
  B. A RECEIPT NUMBER THAT THE APPLICANT CAN THEN USE TO CHECK ON HIS OR
 HER APPLICATION STATUS;
  C.  GUIDELINES  FOR  SUPPLEMENTING  THE APPLICATION WITH ADDITIONAL OR
 UPDATED INFORMATION; AND
  D. AN ELECTRONIC OR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION WHEN A DECISION  IS  MADE  ON
 THE APPLICATION.
  2.  A.  THE  APPLICATION FOR A REPRIEVE, COMMUTATION OR PARDON SHALL
 INCLUDE A SECTION ALLOWING APPLICANTS TO DESCRIBE AN URGENT NEED FOR THE
 REPRIEVE, COMMUTATION OR PARDON. FOR THE PURPOSES OF  THIS  SECTION,  AN
 "URGENT  NEED"  SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, A PENDING DEPORTA-
 TION PROCEEDING  OR  FINAL  DEPORTATION  ORDER,  HUMANITARIAN  CONCERNS,
 HEALTH ISSUES AND THE AGING STATUS OF THE APPLICANT.
  B.  APPLICANTS  ARE  PERMITTED  TO  UPDATE  AN APPLICATION TO INDICATE
 URGENT  NEED  DUE  TO  CHANGED  CIRCUMSTANCES  FOLLOWING  THE  INITIAL
 SUBMISSION OF THE APPLICATION.
  3.  THE  GOVERNOR  SHALL  ISSUE  A DECISION ON APPLICATIONS INDICATING
 URGENT NEED  WITHIN  NINETY  DAYS  FROM  THE  DATE  THE  APPLICATION  IS
 RECEIVED.  ALL OTHER APPLICATIONS SHALL BE GRANTED OR DENIED, OR CONTIN-
 UED WITHIN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE THAT THE APPLICATION IS RECEIVED.  ALL
 APPLICANTS  SHALL  RECEIVE WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OF ANY SUCH ACTION TAKEN

 laws of 1971, is amended to read as follows:
  § 17. Governor  to  [communicate  annually  to legislature, reprieves,
 commutations and pardons. He must annually communicate to  the  legisla-
 ture,  each case of reprieve, commutation or pardon; stating the name of
 the convict, the crime of which he was convicted, the sentence  and  its
 date,  and  the  date  of  the  commutation,  pardon or reprieve] SUBMIT

 tations and pardons received before, on or after the effective  date  of
