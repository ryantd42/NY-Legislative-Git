  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 4, 2023, as Marching Music Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of  this  Legislative  Body  to  set  aside
official days to recognize and pay tribute to those who seek to preserve
and  celebrate  marching music and the musical heritage of our State and
Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 4, 2023, as Marching
Music Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Marching Music Day celebrates marching music as an engaging
and ever-expanding art form around the world; the day also  is  observed
during Music in Our Schools Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  centuries,  the  beat  of  the  drum has been used in
military units to encourage  the  soldiers  to  march  in  unison;  now,
marching  music  ignites  excitement  in  crowds  from  small parades to
impressive spectacles; and
 
  WHEREAS, Honoring the dedicated musicians  and  performers  of  many
diverse  styles  and  backgrounds,  Drum  Corps  International  founded
Marching Music  Day  to  celebrate  all  varieties  of  art  forms  that
encompass marching music; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are many styles of marching music, ranging in tone,
to either move an audience during somber memorials, or  thrill  a  crowd
with delightful music and intricate routines with exact precision; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Different  styles  of marching music include drill squads,
marching bands, drum lines, and drum corps,  with  performances  ranging
from traditional, standard marches to rock and roll, jazz, contemporary,
and electronic dance music; and
 
  WHEREAS, Marching music is forever evolving and finding new forms of
sound  expression;  for  example,  technology  has  produced  lighter,
electronic and digital instruments, making it possible for musicians  to
march with violins, cellos, basses, and synthesizers to entertain crowds
in unique and creative new ways; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ensembles  that  perform  marching  music  are in schools,
military units,  community  celebrations,  and  local  auxiliaries;  the
ensemble contains brass instruments in some settings, others may include
woodwinds,  electric  guitars,  percussion,  dance  teams, twirlers, and
color guards,  all  while  incorporating  their  own  unique  sound  and
elaborate costuming; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Marching  Music  Day  may  be  observed  by  attending
performances  and  bringing  new  supporters  along,  contributing  to
 
fundraisings  for  ensembles  to compete, joining a marching band, or by
teaching others about marching music; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Events  which  provide  a  means  of  preserving a part of
America's rich past and contribute to  the  musical  enrichment  of  our
great  State  and  Nation,  are  held  in  the  highest  regard  by this
Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 4, 2023, as Marching
Music Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
