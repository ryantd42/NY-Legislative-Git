 AN  ACT  to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to removing
  labor market attachment requirements for certain disability cases
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  opening paragraph of paragraph w of subdivision 3 of
 section 15 of the workers' compensation law, as amended by section 1  of
 subpart  A  of part NNN of chapter 59 of the laws of 2017, is amended to
 read as follows:
  In all other cases of permanent partial disability,  the  compensation
 shall  be sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between the
 injured employee's average weekly wages  and  his  or  her  wage-earning
 capacity  thereafter  in the same employment or otherwise.  Compensation
 under this paragraph shall be payable during  the  continuance  of  such
 permanent  partial  disability,  without  the necessity for the claimant
 [who is entitled to benefits at the time of  classification]  to  demon-
 strate  [ongoing]  attachment to the labor market, but subject to recon-
 sideration of the degree of such impairment by  the  board  on  its  own
 motion or upon application of any party in interest however, all compen-
 sation  payable  under  this paragraph shall not exceed (i) five hundred
 twenty-five weeks in cases in which the loss of wage-earning capacity is
 greater than ninety-five percent; (ii) five hundred weeks  in  cases  in
 which  the  loss of wage-earning capacity is greater than ninety percent
 but not more than ninety-five percent; (iii) four  hundred  seventy-five
 weeks  in  cases  in  which the loss of wage-earning capacity is greater
 than eighty-five percent but not more than  ninety  percent;  (iv)  four
 hundred  fifty weeks in cases in which the loss of wage-earning capacity
 is greater than eighty percent but not more  than  eighty-five  percent;
 (v)  four  hundred twenty-five weeks in cases in which the loss of wage-
 earning capacity is greater than seventy-five percent but not more  than
 eighty  percent;  (vi)  four hundred weeks in cases in which the loss of

 wage-earning capacity is greater than seventy percent but not more  than
 seventy-five percent; (vii) three hundred seventy-five weeks in cases in
 which  the  loss  of wage-earning capacity is greater than sixty percent
 but  not  more than seventy percent; (viii) three hundred fifty weeks in
 cases in which the loss of wage-earning capacity is greater  than  fifty
 percent  but  not  more  than sixty percent; (ix) three hundred weeks in
 cases in which the loss of wage-earning capacity is greater  than  forty
 percent  but  not  more than fifty percent; (x) two hundred seventy-five
 weeks in cases in which the loss of  wage-earning  capacity  is  greater
 than  thirty  percent  but not more than forty percent; (xi) two hundred
 fifty weeks in cases in which  the  loss  of  wage-earning  capacity  is
 greater than fifteen percent but not more than thirty percent; and (xii)
 two hundred twenty-five weeks in cases in which the loss of wage-earning
 capacity is fifteen percent or less. For a claimant with a date of acci-
 dent  or disablement after the effective date of the chapter of the laws
 of two thousand seventeen  that  amended  this  subdivision,  where  the
 carrier  or  employer  has provided compensation pursuant to subdivision
 five of this section beyond one hundred thirty weeks from  the  date  of
 accident  or disablement, all subsequent weeks in which compensation was
 paid shall be considered to  be  benefit  weeks  for  purposes  of  this
 section,  with  the  carrier  or  employer receiving credit for all such
 subsequent weeks against the amount of maximum benefit weeks when perma-
 nent partial disability under this section is determined. In  the  event
 of  payment for intermittent temporary partial disability paid after one
 hundred thirty weeks from the date of accident or disablement, such time
 shall be reduced to a number  of  weeks,  for  which  the  carrier  will
 receive  a credit against the maximum benefit weeks. For a claimant with
 a date of accident or disablement after  the  effective  date  of  [the]
 SUBPART  A OF PART NNN OF chapter FIFTY-NINE of the laws of two thousand
 seventeen [that amended this subdivision], when permanency is at  issue,
 and  a  claimant has submitted medical evidence that he or she is not at
 maximum medical improvement, and the carrier has produced or has  had  a
 reasonable  opportunity  to  produce  an independent medical examination
 concerning maximum medical improvement, and  the  board  has  determined
 that the claimant is not yet at maximum medical improvement, the carrier
 shall not receive a credit for benefit weeks prior to a finding that the
 claimant  has  reached  maximum  medical  improvement, at which time the
 carrier shall receive credit for any weeks of temporary disability  paid
 to claimant after such finding against the maximum benefit weeks awarded
 under  this  subdivision.  For those claimants classified as permanently
 partially disabled who no longer receive indemnity payments because they
 have surpassed their number of  maximum  benefit  weeks,  the  following
 provisions will apply:
  §  2. Subdivision 5 of section 15 of the workers' compensation law, as
 amended by chapter 161 of the laws  of  1966,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  5. Temporary partial disability. In case of temporary partial disabil-
 ity resulting in decrease of earning capacity, the compensation shall be
 two-thirds  of  the  difference  between  the injured employee's average
 weekly wages before the accident and [his] SUCH INJURED EMPLOYEE'S  wage
 earning capacity after the accident in the same or other employment, AND
 COMPENSATION  UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE PAYABLE WITHOUT THE NECES-
 SITY FOR THE INJURED EMPLOYEE TO DEMONSTRATE LABOR MARKET ATTACHMENT.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
