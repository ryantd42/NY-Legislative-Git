BY: M. of A. Magnarelli
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 21-27, 2024 as Abusive Head Trauma/Shaken Baby
  Syndrome Awareness Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  most  recent  statistics  compiled  by  the  federal
government  estimate  that  558,900  children  were victims of abuse and
neglect in the United States in 2022, of whom 27.3  percent  were  under
three years of age; and
 
  WHEREAS,  That statistic includes 50,056 children in New York State,
of whom 10,564 (21 percent) were under three years of age; and
 
  WHEREAS, On an average day in  the  United  States,  at  least  five
children  will  die  as a consequence of abuse or neglect by a parent or
other person entrusted with their care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Children younger than one year of age  accounted  for  44.7
percent  of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2022, and children
four years of age or younger accounted  for  two-thirds  (67.7)  of  all
child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  leading  cause  of death of abused children under age
five is Abusive Head Trauma, including  the  inflicted  trauma  commonly
known as Shaken Baby Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS, On average 1,200 to 1,400 children in the United States are
diagnosed  with  AHT/SBS  every  year,  and medical experts believe many
additional cases are likely misdiagnosed or undetected; and
 
  WHEREAS, Inflicted head trauma occurs when a caregiver loses control
and shakes a baby or young child, most frequently less than one year  of
age  but in some cases as old as five years of age, resulting in loss of
vision, brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death; and
 
  WHEREAS, Shaken Baby Syndrome often  causes  permanent,  irreparable
brain  damage  or  death  to  an  infant,  and  may  result in more than
$1,000,000 in medical and rehabilitation costs for the care of a  single
disabled child during the first years of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, A growing body of medical evidence indicates that even mild
trauma  to  the  brain  caused  by  AHT/SBS  is likely to cause learning
disabilities  in  children  and  substantially  increase  the  risk  of
substance abuse; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in
2011  that  the  average cost of child maltreatment is $210,012 over the
course of a victim's lifetime, including the  costs  of  child  welfare,
special  education,  criminal  justice  expenses,  medical care and lost
productivity as an adult; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is estimated that the taxpayers of the State of New York
may, though the State Medicaid program,  pay  as  much  as  41%  of  the
medical and rehabilitation costs of inflicted head injuries; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, The Centers for Disease Control estimates child abuse costs
our nation more than $124 billion a year, and the cost of child abuse in
New York State is estimated to exceed $13 billion a year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  most  effective  way  to  end AHT/SBS is by educating
parents  and  caregivers  about  the  danger  of  shaking  children  and
providing  the skills needed to cope with frustration and anger, and the
minimal  costs  of  educational  and  preventative  programs  may  avert
enormous  medical  and  disability  costs  and  untold  grief  for  many
families; and
 
  WHEREAS, Evidence-based education and awareness  programs,  such  as
the  nationally recognized New York SBS Prevention Project, developed by
Dr.  Mark Dias with the support of the NYS Children and  Families  Trust
Fund,  and  implemented  in  collaboration with Kalieda Health Women and
Children's Hospital of Buffalo and the Maria Fareri Children's  Hospital
of  Westchester,  are  shown  to  raise awareness and provide critically
important information about SBS to parents, caregivers, daycare workers,
and health care professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS, The NYS Office of Children and Family Services supports the
work of hospital-based education programs through  the  efforts  of  the
Safe  Babies  New York program, bringing this and other important safety
information to the families of 210,000 babies born last year in New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Home visiting programs, such as Healthy Families New  York,
the  Nurse  Family  Partnership, and other programs for new parents show
great promise for preventing maltreatment; and
 
  WHEREAS, These prevention efforts are supported by  national  groups
such  as the American Academy of Pediatrics, Prevent Child Abuse America
and the National Center for Shaken Baby Syndrome, as well as individuals
and organizations in New York State, such as  Prevent  Child  Abuse  New
York, the Cynthia Gibbs Foundation, and the SKIPPER Initiative, who work
to  educate  new  parents  and  caregivers, increase awareness among the
general public and professionals, and encourage  increased  support  for
victims  and  their  families  in  the  health care and criminal justice
systems; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Legislature has enacted  legislation  to
help  increase  awareness  of AHT/SBS by requiring that: hospitals offer
written information about Shaken Baby Syndrome (2001);  new  child  care
providers  be educated about the causes, consequences, and prevention of
SBS before they are licensed to care for children (2003);  hospitals  to
offer  new  parents  the  opportunity to watch a video about the causes,
consequences and prevention of SBS so that they can help  protect  their
child  from  shaking injuries (2004); the Health Department coordinate a
statewide campaign to educate the public about the causes,  consequences
and  prevention  of  SBS  (2006);  the  Education  Department  provide a
curriculum on SBS to schools so that  students,  who  not  only  may  be
parents  someday, but who may be babysitting for young children now, are
educated about the importance of coping skills (2006); and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body wishes to  commend  those  advocates,
organizations  and agencies of State, county and local governments which
continue  work  continuously  and  tirelessly  to  educate  parents  and
 
caregivers  about  the  causes,  consequences  and prevention of SBS and
other inflicted injuries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body particularly wishes to recognize the
nurse educators who provide education  to  new  parents  at  New  York's
maternity  hospitals  so  that  every  new parent has the opportunity to
learn how they can help protect their child from shaking injuries;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  April  21-27,  2024  as
Abusive  Head Trauma Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week in the State of
New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
