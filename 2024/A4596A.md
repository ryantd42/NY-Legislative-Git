 AN ACT to amend the penal law and the civil rights law, in  relation  to
  enacting the reproductive health care facilities and religious worship
  access act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "reproduc-
 tive health care facilities and religious worship access act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  finds that the right to
 obtain reproductive health services and the right to  religious  worship
 are essential personal rights protected by state and federal law. Equal-
 ly,  the right to peaceably protest and express one's views is protected
 by state and federal law. Such actions include, but are not limited  to,
 the  right  to  speak,  march,  demonstrate, or engage in other activity
 protected by the First Amendment.
  The legislature finds that current law  does  not  adequately  protect
 reproductive  health  care facilities or places of religious worship and
 those who work in or seek services from or access  to  such  facilities.
 Therefore, the legislature has determined that it is appropriate for the
 protection  of  the  public  health, safety and welfare, to enact legis-
 lation to prohibit interference with access to reproductive health  care
 services  or places of religious worship, so that persons harmed by such
 conduct can seek redress in the courts and the state can obtain  injunc-
 tive  relief  and  damages.  Furthermore, the legislature has determined
 that it is appropriate to enact this legislation to: ensure public safe-

 ty and order; protect freedom to receive reproductive  health  services;
 advance medical privacy and the well-being of patients seeking reproduc-
 tive  health  care services at facilities; protect the exercise of reli-
 gious freedom at places of religious worship and the well-being of those
 exercising their freedom of religion at places of religious worship; and
 safeguard private property.
  §  3.  Section 240.70 of the penal law, as added by chapter 635 of the
 laws of 1999, is amended to read as follows:

  worship in the second degree.
