  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of New Castle, county of Westchester, is hereby
 authorized to accept from the Ethical Society of Northern Westchester an
 application for exemption from real property taxes pursuant  to  section
 462  of  the  real  property tax law with respect to the 2023 assessment
 rolls, for all applicable taxes during the 2022-2023 tax year,  for  the
 parcel  owned by such organization located at 108 Pinesbridge Road, town
 of New Castle, county of Westchester,  otherwise  known  as  Westchester
 county  tax  map  number 553600 80 19-1-11. If accepted, the application
 shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or  before  the  taxable
 status date established for such assessment roll.
  §  2.  If satisfied that such organization would otherwise be entitled
 to such exemption if such organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  town  board  of  New  Castle,  may  make  appropriate
 corrections  to  the subject roll. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  roll,  the  applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
