 to adopt and amend a local law or ordinance establishing a demonstration
 program imposing monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for  fail-
 ure  of an operator thereof to comply with section eleven hundred seven-

 equipped  as provided in subdivisions twenty and twenty-one-c of section
 three hundred seventy-five of this chapter and operated in such  county,
 city,  town  or  village,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of this
 section. Such demonstration program shall  empower  such  county,  city,
 town  or village to install and operate school bus photo violation moni-
 toring systems which may be stationary  or  mobile,  and  which  may  be
 installed,  pursuant  to an agreement with a school district within such
 county, city, town or village, on school buses  owned  and  operated  by
 such  school  district  or privately owned and operated for compensation
 under contract with  such  district.  Provided,  however,  that  (a)  no
 stationary  school  bus  photo  violation  monitoring  system  shall  be
 installed or operated by a county, city, town or village except on road-
 ways under the jurisdiction of such county, city, town or  village,  and
 (b)  no  mobile  school  bus  photo violation monitoring system shall be

 town or village and such district  enter  into  an  agreement  for  such
 installation and operation.
  1-a.  Any  county,  city,  town  or  village, [located within a school
 district,] that has adopted a local law or ordinance  pursuant  to  this
 section  establishing  a demonstration program imposing liability on the
 owner of a vehicle for failure of an operator  thereof  to  comply  with
 section eleven hundred seventy-four of this [chapter] ARTICLE when meet-
 ing  a school bus marked and equipped as provided in subdivisions twenty
 and twenty-one-c of section three hundred seventy-five of  this  chapter
 and  operated  in  such  county, city, town or village may enter into an
 agreement with [the applicable] A school district THAT  OPERATES  SCHOOL
 BUSES  WITHIN  THE  COUNTY,  CITY, TOWN OR VILLAGE for the installation,
 maintenance and use of school bus photo violation monitoring systems  on
 school  buses  pursuant  to this section and section twenty-two of [the]
 chapter ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE of the  laws  of  two  thousand  nineteen

 data  produced  by  such  systems, and for the forwarding of such photo-
 graphs, microphotographs, videotapes, other recorded images and data  to
 the applicable county, city, town or village. Any agreement entered into

 four, section seventeen hundred nine, section twenty-five hundred three,
 section twenty-five hundred fifty-four or  section  twenty-five  hundred
 ninety-h  of  the  education law, as applicable. Provided, however, that
 where a district has entered an agreement as provided hereunder  with  a
 county,  no  cities,  towns or villages within the same county may enter
 into, or be a party to, any agreement with  such  district  pursuant  to
 this section. Provided further, however, that no county shall enter INTO
 an  agreement  with  any city school district [wholly contained within a
 city] IN A CITY WITH A POPULATION OVER  ONE  MILLION.  Nothing  in  this
 section  shall  be construed to prevent a county, city, town, village or
 district at any time to withdraw from or terminate an agreement  entered
 pursuant  to  this  section  and section twenty-two of [the] chapter ONE
 HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE of the laws of 2019 [which added this section].
  1-b. A COUNTY, CITY, TOWN OR VILLAGE THAT HAS ADOPTED A LOCAL  LAW  OR
 ORDINANCE  PURSUANT  TO  THIS SECTION THAT HAS ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT
 WITH A SCHOOL  DISTRICT  LOCATED  WITHIN  SUCH  COUNTY,  CITY,  TOWN  OR
 VILLAGE, MAY ENFORCE SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-FOUR OF THIS ARTICLE
 PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION  WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES WITHOUT NECESSITATING
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH OVERLAPPING JURISDICTIONS.
  1-C. The total cost to the district of the  installation,  maintenance
 and  use  of  school  bus photo violation monitoring systems pursuant to
 this section shall be borne  entirely  by  the  county,  city,  town  or
 village  within  the  district which is a party to such agreement. On or
 before September first of each year, the district  shall  determine  and
 certify  to each county, city, town or village with which it has entered
 into an agreement pursuant  to  this  section  the  total  cost  to  the
 district  for  the  school  year  ending the preceding June thirtieth of

 A. 9322  3
 
 December first of each year, each such county,  city,  town  or  village
 shall  pay to the district such cost so certified to it on or before the
 preceding September first. Not later than twenty days  after  each  such
 payment  is  submitted  or  is due, whichever occurs first, the district
 shall submit to the director of the budget and the chairpersons  of  the
 fiscal  committees  of  the  legislature  a report for each such county,
 city, town and village showing the amount of costs so certified and  the
 amount  of  payments  so  received  or  due.  If a county, city, town or
 village fails to make the payment required to the district by the  twen-
 tieth  day  after  the date such payment was due, (i) the district shall
 notify the director of the budget and the  chairpersons  of  the  fiscal
 committees  of  the  legislature  of  such occurrence within twenty-four
 hours of such day; and (ii) the demonstration program shall be suspended
 within such county, city, town, or village until such time as such coun-
 ty, city, town, or village makes the payment required to  the  district.
 The  district  shall  notify  the  director of the budget and the chair-
 persons of the fiscal committees of  the  legislature  of  such  payment
 within  seven  business days of its receipt. Provided, however, that any
 notice of liability issued prior to such date shall not be voided.
  2. Any image or images captured by school bus photo violation monitor-
 ing  systems  shall  be  inadmissible  in  any  disciplinary  proceeding
 convened  by  any  school district or any school bus contractor thereof,
 and any proceeding initiated by the department involving licensure priv-
 ileges of school bus operators. Any school bus photo violation  monitor-
 ing device mounted on a school bus shall be directed outwardly from such
 school  bus  to  capture  images  of  vehicles  operated in violation of
 section eleven hundred  seventy-four  of  this  [chapter]  ARTICLE,  and
 images produced by such device shall not be used for any other purpose.
  3.  (i)  Any  participating  school  district shall be prohibited from
 accessing any photographs, microphotographs, videotapes, other  recorded
 images  or  data  from school bus photo violation monitoring systems but
 shall provide, pursuant to an agreement with a  county,  city,  town  or
 village as provided in this section, for the proper handling and custody
 of such photographs, microphotographs, videotapes, other recorded images
 and data produced by such systems, and for the forwarding of such photo-
 graphs,  microphotographs, videotapes, other recorded images and data to
 the applicable county, city, town or village for the purpose  of  deter-
 mining  whether a motor vehicle was operated in violation of subdivision
 (a) of section eleven hundred seventy-four of this [title]  ARTICLE  and
 imposing monetary liability on the owner of such motor vehicle therefor.
  (ii)  Photographs, microphotographs, videotapes, other recorded images
 and data produced by school bus photo violation monitoring systems shall
 be destroyed (A) ninety days after the date of the alleged imposition of
 liability if a notice of liability is not issued for such alleged  impo-
 sition  of liability pursuant to this section or (B) upon final disposi-
 tion of a notice of liability issued pursuant to this section.
  4. A county,  city,  town  or  village  establishing  a  demonstration
 program  pursuant  to  this  section shall adopt and enforce measures to
 protect the privacy of drivers,  passengers,  pedestrians  and  cyclists
 whose  identity  and identifying information may be captured by a school
 bus photo violation monitoring device. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO NOTICE
 OF LIABILITY ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE  DISMISSED  SOLELY
 BECAUSE  A PHOTOGRAPH OR PHOTOGRAPHS ALLOW FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE
 CONTENTS OF A VEHICLE, PROVIDED THAT SUCH COUNTY, CITY, TOWN OR  VILLAGE
 HAS MADE A REASONABLE EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARA-
 GRAPH. Such measures shall include:
 A. 9322  4
 
  (i)  utilization  of  necessary  technologies to ensure, to the extent
 practicable,  that  photographs  produced  by  such  school  bus  photo
 violation  monitoring systems shall not include images that identify the
 driver, the passengers, the contents of  the  vehicle,  pedestrians  and
 cyclists[.  Provided, however, that no notice of liability issued pursu-
 ant to this section shall be dismissed solely because  a  photograph  or
 photographs  allow  for the identification of the contents of a vehicle,
 provided that such county, city, town or village has made  a  reasonable
 effort to comply with the provisions of this paragraph];
  (ii)  a  prohibition  on the use or dissemination of vehicles' license
 plate information and other information and images  captured  by  school
 bus photo violation monitoring systems except: (A) as required to estab-
 lish  liability  under this section or collect payment of penalties; (B)
 as required by court order; or (C) as otherwise required by law; AND
  (iii) [the installation  of  signage  in  conformance  with  standards
 established  in the MUTCD at each roadway entrance of the jurisdictional
 boundaries of such county, city, town  or  village  giving  notice  that
 school  bus  photo  violation  monitoring  systems  are  used to enforce
 restrictions on vehicles violating section eleven  hundred  seventy-four
 of  this chapter. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "roadway"
 shall not include state expressway routes or state interstate routes but
 shall include controlled-access highway exit ramps that enter the juris-
 dictional boundaries of a county, city, town or village; and
  (iv)] oversight procedures to ensure  compliance  with  the  aforemen-
 tioned privacy protection measures.
  5.  A  COUNTY,  CITY,  TOWN  OR  VILLAGE  ESTABLISHING A DEMONSTRATION
 PROGRAM PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL INSTALL  SIGNAGE  IN  CONFORMANCE
 WITH  STANDARDS ESTABLISHED IN THE MUTCD AT EACH ROADWAY ENTRANCE OF THE
 JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES OF SUCH COUNTY, CITY, TOWN OR  VILLAGE  GIVING
 NOTICE  THAT  SCHOOL  BUS PHOTO VIOLATION MONITORING SYSTEMS ARE USED TO
 ENFORCE RESTRICTIONS ON VEHICLES VIOLATING SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN-
 TY-FOUR OF THIS ARTICLE. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS  PARAGRAPH,  THE  TERM
 "ROADWAY"  SHALL NOT INCLUDE STATE EXPRESSWAY ROUTES OR STATE INTERSTATE
 ROUTES BUT SHALL INCLUDE CONTROLLED-ACCESS HIGHWAY EXIT RAMPS THAT ENTER
 THE JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES  OF  A  COUNTY,  CITY,  TOWN  OR  VILLAGE.
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT NO NOTICE OF LIABILITY ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS
 SECTION SHALL BE DISMISSED IF SUCH COUNTY, CITY,  TOWN  OR  VILLAGE  HAS
 MADE  A  REASONABLE  EFFORT  TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARA-
 GRAPH.
  (b) In any such county, city, town or  village  which  has  adopted  a
 local  law or ordinance pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, the
 owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a  penalty  imposed  pursuant  to
 this section if such vehicle was used or operated with the permission of
 the  owner,  express  or  implied,  in  violation  of subdivision (a) of
 section eleven hundred seventy-four of this article, and such  violation
 is  evidenced  by information obtained from a school bus photo violation
 monitoring system; provided however that no owner of a vehicle shall  be
 liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section where the operator
 of such vehicle has been convicted of the underlying violation of subdi-
 vision (a) of section eleven hundred seventy-four of this article.
  (c)  For  purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the

 school  bus stop-arm and which automatically produces two or more photo-
 graphs, two or more microphotographs,  a  videotape  or  other  recorded
 images  of  a vehicle at the time it is used or operated in violation of
 subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred seventy-four of this article.
  (d) 1. A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed by
 the county, city,  town  or  village  in  which  the  charged  violation
 occurred,  or a facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs,
 microphotographs, videotape or  other  recorded  images  produced  by  a
 school  bus  photo  violation  monitoring  system,  shall be prima facie
 evidence of the facts contained therein.  Any  photographs,  microphoto-
 graphs,  videotape  or other recorded images evidencing such a violation
 shall be available for inspection in any proceeding  to  adjudicate  the
 liability  for  such  violation  pursuant  to  a  local law or ordinance
 adopted pursuant to this section.
  2. THERE SHALL BE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT (I) ANY  BUS  THAT  IS
 THE COLOR KNOWN AS NATIONAL SCHOOL BUS CHROME AND EQUIPPED WITH A SCHOOL
 BUS  PHOTO  VIOLATION  MONITORING  SYSTEM  IS  A  SCHOOL  BUS MARKED AND
 EQUIPPED AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISIONS TWENTY AND TWENTY-ONE-C OF  SECTION

 ANT  SHOWS  BY  CLEAR  AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT (I) THE BUS IS NOT A
 SCHOOL BUS MARKED AND EQUIPPED AS PROVIDED IN  SUBDIVISIONS  TWENTY  AND
 TWENTY-ONE-C OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE OF THIS CHAPTER; (II)
 THE  SCHOOL BUS WAS NOT STOPPED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING PASSENGERS;
 AND (III) THE SCHOOL BUS' RED SIGNAL LIGHTS WERE NOT FLASHING AND OPERA-

  (e) An owner liable for a violation  of  subdivision  (a)  of  section
 eleven  hundred  seventy-four of this article pursuant to a local law or
 ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall be liable for  monetary
 penalties in accordance with a schedule of fines and penalties to be set
 forth in such local law or ordinance, except that if a city by local law
 has  authorized  the  adjudication  of such owner liability by a parking
 violations bureau, such schedule shall be promulgated  by  such  bureau.
 The liability of the owner pursuant to this section shall be two hundred
 fifty  dollars  for  a first violation, two hundred seventy-five dollars
 for a second violation both of which were committed within a  period  of
 eighteen  months,  and  three  hundred dollars for a third or subsequent
 violation all of which  were  committed  within  a  period  of  eighteen
 months;  provided, however, that such local law or ordinance may provide
 for an additional penalty not in excess of twenty-five dollars for  each
 violation for the failure to respond to a notice of liability within the
 prescribed time period.
  (f)  An imposition of liability under a local law or ordinance adopted
 pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction as an operator
 and shall not be made part of the operating record of  the  person  upon
 A. 9322  6
 
 whom  such  liability  is  imposed  nor  shall  it be used for insurance
 purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.
  (g) 1. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each
 person  alleged  to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision
 (a) of section eleven hundred seventy-four of this article  pursuant  to
 this  section.  Personal  delivery on the owner shall not be required. A
 manual or automatic record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of
 business shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
  2. A notice of liability shall contain the name  and  address  of  the
 person  alleged  to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision
 (a) of section eleven hundred seventy-four of this article  pursuant  to
 this  section,  the  registration number of the vehicle involved in such

 time of such violation and the identification number of the camera which
 recorded the violation or other document locator number.
  3.  The  notice  of  liability  shall contain information advising the
 person charged of the manner and the time in which [he or she] THEY  may
 contest  the  liability  alleged in the notice. Such notice of liability
 shall also contain a warning to advise the persons charged that  failure
 to  contest in the manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission
 of liability and that a default judgment may be entered thereon.
  4. The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by the county,
 city, town or village in which the violation occurred, or by  any  other
 entity  authorized  by such county, city, town or village to prepare and
 mail such notification of violation.
  (h) [Adjudication] 1. A  COUNTY,  CITY,  TOWN  OR  VILLAGE  IS  HEREBY
 AUTHORIZED TO ADOPT A LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE TO INSTITUTE AN ADMINISTRA-
 TIVE  ADJUDICATION  HEARING  PROCESS  FOR  IMPARTIAL  ADMINISTRATION AND
 CONDUCT OF ADJUDICATORY PROCEEDINGS FOR DISPUTED NOTICES  OF  VIOLATIONS
 UNDER  THIS SECTION. A COUNTY, CITY, TOWN, VILLAGE OR ANY ENTITY AUTHOR-
 IZED BY SUCH COUNTY, CITY, TOWN OR VILLAGE MAY ADMINISTER  THE  HEARING.
 THE  RULES  OF EVIDENCE DO NOT APPLY, AND THE DECISION OF THE PROCEEDING
 SHALL BE MADE BASED ON THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE STANDARD.  THE  DECISION
 SHALL  BE  PREPARED  AND  SENT  BY FIRST CLASS MAIL BY THE COUNTY, CITY,
 TOWN, VILLAGE OR ANOTHER ENTITY AUTHORIZED BY SUCH COUNTY, CITY, TOWN OR
 VILLAGE WITHIN FOURTEEN BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE  HEARING.  THE  DECISION
 SHALL  ALSO  PROVIDE  INSTRUCTIONS  FOR HOW THE OWNER MAY, WITHIN THIRTY
 DAYS OF THE DECISION MAILING DATE, REQUEST ADJUDICATION OF THE NOTICE OF
 VIOLATION BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. A  MANUAL  OR  AUTOMATIC
 RECORD  OF  MAILING PREPARED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS SHALL BE
 PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE OF THE FACTS CONTAINED THEREIN.
  2. UPON REQUEST BY AN OWNER, IF A COUNTY, CITY, TOWN  OR  VILLAGE  HAS
 NOT  INSTITUTED  AN  ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION HEARING PROCESS TO HEAR
 DISPUTED NOTICES OF VIOLATION UNDER THIS SECTION, OR UPON THIRTY DAYS OF
 THE ISSUANCE OF A DECISION OF AN  ADMINISTRATIVE  ADJUDICATION  HEARING,
 ADJUDICATION  of the liability imposed upon owners by this section shall
 be by a traffic violations bureau established pursuant to section  three
 hundred  seventy  of  the  general  municipal  law  where  the violation
 occurred or, if there be none, by the  court  having  jurisdiction  over
 traffic  infractions where the violation occurred, except that if a city
 has  established  an  administrative  tribunal  to  hear  and  determine
 complaints  of  traffic  infractions  constituting  parking, standing or
 stopping violations such city may, by local law, authorize such  adjudi-
 cation by such tribunal.
  (i)  If  an  owner  receives  a  notice  of liability pursuant to this
 section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to the
 A. 9322  7
 
 police as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense to an  allega-
 tion  of  liability for a violation of subdivision (a) of section eleven
 hundred seventy-four of this article pursuant to this section  that  the
 vehicle  had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time the
 violation occurred and had not been recovered by such time. For purposes
 of asserting the defense provided by this subdivision it shall be suffi-
 cient that a certified copy of the police report on the  stolen  vehicle
 be  sent  by  first  class  mail to the traffic violations bureau, court
 having jurisdiction or parking violations bureau.
  (j) 1. In such county, city, town or village where the adjudication of
 liability imposed upon owners pursuant to this section is by  a  traffic
 violations  bureau  or  a  court  having jurisdiction, an owner who is a
 lessor of a vehicle to which a notice of liability was  issued  pursuant
 to subdivision (g) of this section shall not be liable for the violation
 of  subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred seventy-four of this arti-
 cle, provided that he or she sends to the traffic violations  bureau  or
 court  having  jurisdiction  a  copy  of the rental, lease or other such
 contract document covering such vehicle on the date  of  the  violation,
 with  the name and address of the lessee clearly legible, within thirty-
 seven days after receiving notice from the bureau or court of  the  date
 and  time  of  such  violation,  together  with  the  other  information
 contained in the original notice of  liability.  Failure  to  send  such
 information  within  such  thirty-seven day time period shall render the
 owner liable for the penalty  prescribed  by  this  section.  Where  the
 lessor  complies  with  the  provisions of this paragraph, the lessee of
 such vehicle on the date of such violation shall be  deemed  to  be  the
 owner  of such vehicle for purposes of this section, shall be subject to
 liability for the violation of subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred
 seventy-four of this article pursuant to this section and shall be  sent
 a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section.
  2.  (i) In a city which, by local law, has authorized the adjudication
 of liability imposed upon owners by this section by a parking violations
 bureau, an owner who is a lessor of a  vehicle  to  which  a  notice  of
 liability  was  issued pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section shall
 not be liable for the violation of subdivision  (a)  of  section  eleven
 hundred seventy-four of this article, provided that:
  (A)  prior  to  the violation, the lessor has filed with the bureau in
 accordance with the provisions of section  two  hundred  thirty-nine  of
 this chapter; and
  (B) within thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the bureau of
 the  date  and  time of a liability, together with the other information
 contained in the original notice of liability, the lessor submits to the
 bureau the correct name and address of the lessee of the vehicle identi-
 fied in the notice of liability at the time of such violation,  together
 with such other additional information contained in the rental, lease or
 other  contract  document,  as  may be reasonably required by the bureau
 pursuant to regulations that may be promulgated for such purpose.
  (ii) Failure to comply with clause (B) of  subparagraph  (i)  of  this
 paragraph  shall  render  the owner liable for the penalty prescribed in
 this section.
  (iii) Where the lessor complies with the provisions of this paragraph,
 the lessee of such vehicle on the date of such violation shall be deemed
 to be the owner of such vehicle for purposes of this section,  shall  be
 subject  to  liability  for  such violation pursuant to this section and
 shall be sent a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision (g) of  this
 section.
 A. 9322  8
 
  (k)  1.  If  the  owner  liable  for a violation of subdivision (a) of
 section eleven hundred seventy-four of this  article  pursuant  to  this
 section  was  not  the  operator  of  the  vehicle  at  the  time of the
 violation, the owner may maintain an action for indemnification  against
 the operator.
  2.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of a
 vehicle shall be subject to a monetary fine  imposed  pursuant  to  this
 section if the operator of such vehicle was operating such vehicle with-
 out  the consent of the owner at the time such operator failed to comply
 with section eleven hundred seventy-four of this [chapter] ARTICLE.  For
 purposes of this subdivision there shall be a presumption that the oper-
 ator  of such vehicle was operating such vehicle with the consent of the
 owner at the time such operator failed to  comply  with  section  eleven
 hundred seventy-four of this [chapter] ARTICLE.
  (l) IT SHALL BE A DEFENSE TO ANY PROSECUTION FOR A VIOLATION OF SUBDI-
 VISION (A) OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-FOUR OF THIS ARTICLE PURSU-
 ANT  TO  A  LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION THAT
 SUCH SCHOOL BUS STOP-ARMS WERE MALFUNCTIONING AT THE TIME OF THE ALLEGED
 VIOLATION.
  (M) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the  liability
 of  an  operator  of  a  vehicle for any violation of subdivision (a) of
 section eleven hundred seventy-four of this article.

 demonstration  program pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, such
 county, city, town or village shall  submit  an  annual  report  on  the
 results  of the use of a school bus photo violation monitoring system to
 the governor, the temporary president of the senate and the  speaker  of
 the  assembly  on or before June first, two thousand nineteen and on the
