 OR LEGAL SETTLEMENTS, INCOME-SHARING AGREEMENTS AND FINANCING FOR EDUCA-
 TION.
  2.  [No]  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER  NEW YORK STATUTE, REGULATION OR
 RULE, NO person or corporation shall, directly  or  indirectly,  charge,
 take or receive any money, goods or things in action as interest [on the
 loan  or  forbearance  of  any  money,  goods  or  things  in action] IN
 CONNECTION WITH A FINANCING ARRANGEMENT at a  rate  exceeding  the  rate
 above  prescribed.  The  amount  charged,  taken or received as interest
 shall include any and all amounts paid or payable, directly or indirect-
 ly, VOLUNTARY OR OTHERWISE, by any person, to or for the account of  the
 lender,  INCLUDING  ANY  DISCOUNT  APPLIED  TO  ANY AMOUNTS ADVANCED, in
 [consideration for making the loan or forbearance] CONNECTION  WITH  THE
 FINANCING  ARRANGEMENT  as  defined  by  the superintendent of financial
 services pursuant to subdivision three  of  section  fourteen-a  of  the
 banking  law,  INCLUDING  FEES,  CHARGES,  TIPS, RENEWAL CHARGES, CREDIT
 INSURANCE PREMIUMS, DEBT SUSPENSION OR SIMILAR PRODUCTS,  ANY  ANCILLARY
 PRODUCT SOLD WITH ANY EXTENSION OF CONSUMER CREDIT, AND ANY OTHER AMOUNT
 PAID  OR PAYABLE, except such fee as may be fixed by the commissioner of
 taxation and finance as the cost of servicing loans made by the property
 and liability insurance security fund.
  4. Except as otherwise provided by law, interest shall not be charged,
 taken or received on any [loan or forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT  at
 a  rate  exceeding  such rate of interest as may be authorized by law at
 the time the [loan or forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT is made, wheth-
 er or not the [loan or forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT is made pursu-
 ant to a prior contract or commitment providing for a  greater  rate  of
 interest,  provided,  however,  that  no  change in the rate of interest
 prescribed in section fourteen-a of the banking law shall affect (a) the
 validity of a [loan or forbearance] FINANCING  ARRANGEMENT  made  before
 the  date such rate becomes effective, or (b) the enforceability of such
 [loan or forbearance]  FINANCING  ARRANGEMENT  in  accordance  with  its
 terms,  except  that  if any [loan or forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT
 provides for an increase in the rate of interest during the term of such
 [loan or forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, the  increased  rate  shall
 not  exceed  such rate of interest as may have been authorized by law at
 the time such [loan or forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT was made.
  4-a. Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  four  of  this
 section,  a  [loan  or  forbearance]  FINANCING ARRANGEMENT repayable on
 demand may provide for changes, reflecting variations in lending  rates,
 from  time  to  time  in  the  rate of interest payable on such [loan or
 forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT up to the rate of interest authorized
 by law at the time of such change and in such case the rate of  interest
 may  be  so changed in accordance with the terms of the contract or loan
 commitment relating thereto; provided, however, that the rate of  inter-
 est charged, taken or received on such a [loan or forbearance] FINANCING
 ARRANGEMENT  shall  not exceed the rate of interest authorized by law as
 it may subsequently be reduced from time to time; and further  provided,
 however,  that in no event shall such a [loan or forbearance by] FINANC-
 ING ARRANGEMENT BE subject to an authorized rate of interest  less  than
 that  applicable  at  the  time  such  [loan  or  forbearance] FINANCING
 ARRANGEMENT was made. The provisions of  this  subdivision  shall  apply
 only  to  a  [loan  or  forbearance]  FINANCING ARRANGEMENT repayable on
 demand which has an initial principal of more than five thousand dollars
 and which the borrower has the right to repay at any time in whole or in
 part, together with accrued interest on the principal so repaid, without
 any penalty. With respect to a [loan or forbearance] FINANCING  ARRANGE-
 S. 9275  3
 
 MENT  covered  by  this  subdivision,  the  lender shall disclose to the
 borrower in writing not less often than annually the amount of  interest
 accrued  or  payable as of the date of such disclosure and the manner by
 which such amount was computed.
  6.  a.  No  law  regulating  the maximum rate of interest which may be
 charged, taken or received, except section 190.40 and section 190.42  of
 the  penal  law,  shall  apply  to  any  [loan or forbearance] FINANCING
 ARRANGEMENT in the amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or more,
 other than a [loan  or  a  forbearance]  FINANCING  ARRANGEMENT  secured
 primarily by an interest in real property improved by a one or two fami-
 ly  residence. A [loan] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT of two hundred fifty thou-
 sand dollars or more which is to be advanced in installments pursuant to
 a written agreement by a lender shall be deemed to be  a  single  [loan]
 FINANCING  ARRANGEMENT  for the total amount which the lender has agreed
 to advance pursuant to  such  agreement  on  the  terms  and  conditions
 provided therein.
  b.  No  law  regulating  the  maximum  rate  of  interest which may be
 charged, taken or received, including section 190.40 and section  190.42
 of  the  penal  law,  shall apply to any [loan or forbearance] FINANCING
 ARRANGEMENT in the amount of two million five hundred  thousand  dollars
 or  more. [Loans or forbearances] FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS aggregating two
 million five hundred thousand dollars or more which are to  be  made  or
 advanced  to  any one borrower in one or more installments pursuant to a
 written agreement by one or more lenders shall be deemed to be a  single
 [loan  or  forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT for the total amount which
 the lender or lenders have agreed to advance or make  pursuant  to  such
 agreement on the terms and conditions provided therein.
  7.  Except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided by law, in the event of
 prepayment in full of a [loan]  FINANCING  ARRANGEMENT,  any  refund  of
 unearned  interest  to  which  the  borrower  may be entitled may not be
 computed by a sum of the balances or similar method but must  be  deter-
 mined according to a generally accepted actuarial method.
  8.  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL IS  HEREBY EMPOWERED TO ADOPT, PROMULGATE,
 AMEND, AND REPEAL RULES, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED  IN  PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF
 SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWO OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE
 PROCEDURE ACT, AND ISSUE GUIDANCE  AS  MAY  BE  NECESSARY  TO  INTERPRET
 FINANCING  ARRANGEMENTS  AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION ONE-A OF
 THIS SECTION AND TO EFFECTUATE AND ENFORCE THAT PROVISION.
  § 2.  Subdivision 1 of section 5-511 of the general  obligations  law,
 as  amended  by  chapter 1072 of the laws of 1968, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1.  All  bonds,  bills,  notes,  assurances,  conveyances,  all  other
 contracts  or  securities  whatsoever,  except bottomry and respondentia
 bonds and contracts, and all deposits of goods or other things whatsoev-
 er, whereupon or whereby there shall be reserved or taken, or secured or
 agreed to be reserved or taken, any greater sum, or greater  value,  for
 the  [loan or forbearance of any money, goods or other things in action]
 FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, than is prescribed in  section  5-501,  shall  be
 void, except that the knowingly taking, receiving, reserving or charging
 such  a  greater  sum  or greater value by a savings bank, a savings and
 loan association or a federal savings and loan association shall only be
 held and adjudged a forfeiture of the entire interest which the [loan or
 obligation] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT carries with  it  or  which  has  been
 agreed  to  be  paid thereon. If a greater sum or greater value has been
 paid, the person paying the same or his legal representative may recover
 from the savings bank, the savings and loan association or  the  federal
 S. 9275  4
 
 savings  and  loan  association  twice the entire amount of the interest
 thus paid.
  § 3. Section 5-513 of the general obligations law, as amended by chap-
 ter 1072 of the laws of 1968, is amended to read as follows:

 or value than is allowed to be received pursuant to section  5-501,  and
 his  personal  representatives,  may  recover  in  an action against the
 person who shall have taken or  received  the  same,  and  his  personal
 representatives,  the  amount  of  the money so paid or value delivered,
 above the rate aforesaid.
  § 4. Section 5-517 of the general obligations law is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  § 5-517. Transfer  of  cause of action for usury. A cause of action to
 cancel, or otherwise affect, an instrument executed, or an act done,  as
 security for a usurious [loan or forbearance] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, can
 be  transferred,  where  the instrument or act creates a specific charge
 upon property, which is also transferred in disaffirmance  thereof,  and
 not otherwise; but, in that case, the transferee does not succeed to the
 right,  conferred by statute upon the borrower, to procure relief, with-
 out paying, or offering to pay, any part of the sum or thing loaned.
  § 5. Section 5-524 of the general obligations law, as amended by chap-
 ter 349 of the laws of 1968 and as further amended  by  section  104  of

 ance of money] FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, or for the  use  or  sale  of  his
 personal credit, conditioned upon the payment of a greater rate than the
 rate  prescribed by the superintendent of financial services pursuant to
 section fourteen-a of the banking law,  or,  if  no  rate  has  been  so
 prescribed, six per centum per annum, or who as security for such [loan]
 FINANCING  ARRANGEMENT,  use  or  sale  of personal credit as aforesaid,
 makes a pretended purchase of such property from any  person,  upon  the
 like condition, and permits the pledgor to retain the possession thereof
 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
  §  6.  Subdivision 2 of section 14-a of the banking law, as amended by
 chapter 155 of the laws of 2012, is amended and a new subdivision 2-a is
 added to read as follows:
  2. The rate of interest as so  prescribed  under  this  section  shall
 include  as  interest  any  and all amounts paid or payable, directly or
 indirectly, VOLUNTARY OR OTHERWISE, by any person, to or for the account
 of the lender, INCLUDING ANY DISCOUNT APPLIED TO ANY  AMOUNTS  ADVANCED,
 in  [consideration  for  the making of a loan or forbearance] CONNECTION
 WITH A FINANCING ARRANGEMENT as defined by the  superintendent  pursuant
 to  subdivision  three of this section, INCLUDING FEES, SERVICE CHARGES,
