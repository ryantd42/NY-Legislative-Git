  HONORING  Chief  Digin  Patel  for  14  years  of
  dedicated  service  to  the  New  Hyde  Park  Fire
  Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Chief Digin
Patel for 14 years of dedicated  service  to  the  New  Hyde  Park  Fire
Department,  to  be  celebrated its 114th Annual Installation-Inspection
Dinner on Saturday, June 8, 2024, at Russo's on the Bay in Howard Beach,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, Digin Patel joined the New Hyde  Park  Fire  Department  on
March  2,  2010,  and has been an active member of Rescue Company No. 4,
having served as Captain, 1st Lieutenant, and 2nd Lieutenant; and
 
  WHEREAS, This esteemed firefighter was elected as Deputy  Chief  and
Chief  of  the  Department  from  2019-2023, esteemed positions which he
unfalteringly fulfilled with dignity, compassion, and grace; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Chief  Digin  Patel  is  one  such  firefighter; throughout his years of
devoted service, this volunteer heroically performed, above  and  beyond
the  call  of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Chief  Digin  Patel  for 14 years of dedicated service to the New
Hyde Park Fire Department, and to wish him success  in  all  his  future
endeavors; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Chief Digin Patel.
