  COMMEMORATING  the 70th Season of Friends of Music
  Concerts of Westchester County, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute  to
those  organizations  of  artistic  significance  whose  creative
contributions  have  helped  further  the  cultural  enrichment  of  our
communities and our Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the 70th Season of Friends of Music Concerts of Westchester
County, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Friends of Music Concerts, Inc. is a volunteer,  non-profit
organization  which  brings  the  finest  chamber  music  to Westchester
audiences; until the COVID-19 pandemic, it offered a six-concert  series
each  year,  showcasing  both world-renowned ensembles and distinguished
younger artists who illustrate the diversity and fine quality of chamber
music today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1954, Friends of Music's first concert  featured
the  young  Juilliard  String Quartet, and, since then, Friends of Music
Concerts,  Inc.  has  brought  to  Westchester  chamber  music  groups,
soloists,  and  developing  artists  of  world  renown;  this  esteemed
organization's mission has always maintained a special focus on  keeping
musical  experiences  affordable  and  supporting  the future of chamber
music; and
 
  WHEREAS, Friends of Music  Concerts  also  supports  the  future  of
classical  music  through  its  Partnerships program, which brings young
professional ensembles to Westchester public schools, working with local
music students  and  helping  to  create  the  audiences  and  classical
musicians of tomorrow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  residencies  include  both  performances  and  master
classes for the district's students, and are intended to supplement  the
district's  own music curriculum, with the residencies being provided at
no cost to the district; and
 
  WHEREAS, Friends of Music  Concerts'  scholarship  program  supports
music  students  from  underserved communities in need of financial aid;
the program also addresses the challenges faced presently by local music
schools  in  providing  a  superior  level  of  musical  education;
participating  schools are Hoff-Barthetson Music School in Scarsdale and
the Music Conservatory of Westchester in White Plains; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Friends  of  Music  Concerts'  annual  Performance  Award
nurtures artists newly emerging on the chamber music scene; the award is
given  to  a  winner  of  the annual Young Concert Artists International
Auditions which are held in New York City; the Performance Award  winner
is granted a coveted concert in the organization's season; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Friends  of  Music  Concerts,  supported  by  dedicated
volunteers, has brought to Westchester County the world's finest chamber
music performed by  supremely  gifted  artists;  in  its  seven-concert,
fall-to-spring  season,  the  organization  presents  world-renowned
classical  music  groups  in a convenient setting for Westchester County
audiences; and
 
  WHEREAS, As Friends of Music Concerts, Inc. heads  into  the  second
half  of  their 70th anniversary season, they will be welcoming dynamic,
award-winning artists; some of the featured artists and groups are  just
starting  their  careers  and  will  provide  a variety of fresh musical
voices for the community to look  forward  to;  others  are  established
artists  who  are  highly  praised for their adventurous programming and
virtuosic interpretations; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is most fitting that  we  take  time  to  celebrate  the
musical arts of our Nation, to honor our musical artists, and to express
our  appreciation  to  everyone who patronizes the arts; as we celebrate
the arts, we celebrate and give thanks to our American freedom, the only
atmosphere in which artists can truly create and in which  musical  arts
are truly the expression of the soul; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 70th Season of Friends of Music Concerts of  Westchester
County, New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Friends of Music Concerts of Westchester County.
