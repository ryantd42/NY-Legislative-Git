official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to

Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Gun Violence Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the Centers for Disease Control  (CDC),  there
were  approximately  42,967 people killed by gun-related injuries in the
United States in 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, According  to  Gun  Violence  Archive  (GVA),  a  nonprofit
organization that tracks media and law enforcement reports of shootings,
at least 18,854 people were killed by guns in the United States in 2023,
not including suicides; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Gun-related  deaths  are  the  leading  cause of death for
American children; firearm deaths among children  and  adolescents  rose
from 1,301 in 2012, to 2,543 in 2022, according to the CDC; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Department of Criminal Justice Services
reports that in 2019, of the nearly 70,000 violent crimes  committed  in
New York State, nearly 8,000 involved a firearm; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Gun  violence  continues  to  be  a  devastating  crisis
throughout the state with an increase of shootings and murders typically
occurring in the summer months; and
 
  WHEREAS, The damage caused by gun violence is not limited by gender,
race, sexual orientation or ethnicity; and
 
  WHEREAS, The effects of gun violence extend far beyond those  struck
by a bullet; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  June,  2024,  coinciding  with National Gun Violence
Awareness Month, is the month in which the 20 first-grade  students  who
were  killed  in  the  infamous Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in
Newtown, Connecticut would have graduated high  school  alongside  their
peers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  citizens  of  this State and Nation shall continue to
honor and uphold the memories and legacies of the countless  lives  lost
to  senseless  gun violence over the years, continuing to advocate for a
world where such tragedy does not ensue; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this  serious  issue  including  prevention, intervention, education and
outreach; and
 
  WHEREAS, Increased awareness and coordination among all stakeholders
is  critical  to the prevention of gun violence, the equal protection of
our citizens, and to ensure our  state's  safety  for  our  youth;  now,
therefore, be it
