  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 3 of  article
 4 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  3.  The  governor  shall  be commander-in-chief of the military and
 naval forces of the state. The governor shall have power to convene  the
 legislature, or the senate only, on extraordinary occasions. At extraor-
 dinary  sessions  convened pursuant to the provisions of this section no
 subject shall be acted upon, except such as the governor  may  recommend
 for  consideration.  The  governor  shall  communicate by message to the
 legislature at every session the condition of the state,  and  recommend
 such matters to it as he or she shall judge expedient. THE MESSAGE SHALL
 BE  DELIVERED  ORALLY  IN THE ASSEMBLY CHAMBER, DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF
 LEGISLATIVE SESSION, WITH A QUORUM OF THE ASSEMBLY AND A QUORUM  OF  THE
 SENATE  PRESENT. The governor shall expedite all such measures as may be
 resolved upon by the legislature, and shall take care that the laws  are
 faithfully executed.  The governor shall receive for his or her services
 an  annual  salary  to  be  fixed  by joint resolution of the senate and
 assembly, and there shall be provided for his or her use a suitable  and
 furnished executive residence.
  §  2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendment be
 referred to the first regular legislative session  convening  after  the
 next  succeeding  general  election  of members of the assembly, and, in
 conformity with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution,  be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
