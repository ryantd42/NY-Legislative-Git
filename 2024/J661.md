  COMMENDING  the  sisters  from  various  New  York
  unions and community organizations upon the occasion
  of hosting its Red Carpet for Social Justice  event,
  in  conjunction with the observance of International

  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend  the  sisters  from  various  New  York  unions  and  community
organizations  upon  the  occasion  of hosting its Red Carpet for Social
Justice event, in conjunction with the  observance  of  Women's  History
Month on Friday, March 31, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Red  Carpet  for  Social Justice event will celebrate
women's  strength,  diversity,  and  shared  experiences  and  includes
speakers, dinner, music, printed programs, and more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  of  the highlights of this auspicious occasion is the
"Red Carpet", where sisters represent their ethnic or cultural  heritage
or a historic persona while conveying social justice messages; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Red  Carpet for Social Justice event was started more
than a decade ago as a project of 1199 SEIU but has  since  expanded  to
include  women  from  nearly  40  unions,  community  and social justice
groups; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  those  who
enhance  the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown a
long and sustained commitment to excellence certainly  have  earned  the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend  the  sisters  from  various  New  York  unions  and  community
organizations  upon  the  occasion  of hosting its Red Carpet for Social
Justice event, in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of  International
Women's Month on March 31, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the various New York Unions and community organizations.
