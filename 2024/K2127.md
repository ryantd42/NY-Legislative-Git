  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
long-standing traditions, it is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to
commemorate  the  199th  Anniversary  of Bolivian Independence Day to be
celebrated on August 6, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bolivian Independence Day is celebrated annually on  August
6th,  commemorating  the  signing  of a Declaration of Independence from
Spain on August 6, 1825, after approximately 300 years of Spanish  rule;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Bolivian  War  of Independence lasted from 1809-1825,
involving the regions of Peru, Upper Peru, the Colonies, and  Spain;  in
1817, the Viceroyalty of Peru retained power over these regions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  General Simon Bolivar began to free Colombia and Venezuela
from Spain's power; in 1822, he commissioned Antonio Jose  de  Sucre  to
aid  in the Battle of Pichincha in the region of Ecuador; together, they
defeated  Spanish  forces  in  various  battles,  victoriously  securing
independence for Peru; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nearly one year later, in tribute to General Simon Bolivar,
the Republic of Bolivia was founded on August 6, 1825; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  honor  the  triumphs of both General Simon Bolivar and
Antonio Jose de Sucre, a new Constitutional  Congress  was  established,
and both courageous men served as Bolivia's first and second Presidents,
respectively; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Some  of  these  traditions  include El Grito de Libertad,
known as the Cry of Freedom, commencing with the  ringing  of  bells  at
midnight and congregations of Bolivians chanting, "Viva Bolivia!" ("Long
live Bolivia!") throughout the towns; and
 
  WHEREAS, Customary folk dances, which display reverence to Bolivia's
roots,  European  influences,  and  African heritage, are performed; the
mixture of customs, languages, and societies of many cultures, including
the Aymara, Quechua, Afro-Bolivian, and Mestizo peoples, are honored  by
the Bolivian population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bolivian  Independence  Day  affords the Bolivian-American
community  an  opportunity  to  honor  and  celebrate  the  culture  and
traditions  which  have  been  introduced  to  New  York  State; through
numerous  festivities,  these  proud  people  share  their  celebratory
practices with other communities within the State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  New  York  State, Bolivians express their folklore and
traditions through carnivals, fireworks, and the  Hispanic  Day  Parade;
dance  groups  demonstrate  ancient  tales  and  legends  through  their
performances; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Additionally,  food,  art,  clothing,  and  music  portray
Bolivia's rich  heritage;  the  Bombin  hat,  Caporales  dance,  Mestizo
Baroque  art,  Saltenas  empanadas, and Zampona flute are represented at
numerous events and celebrations in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bolivia's contributions to our great State of New York  are
invaluable  and  should  be  cherished  and  extolled;  it  is  the
conglomeration of many different cultures that makes this State and this
Nation so unique and exceptional; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is pleased to have  this  opportunity
to  recognize  such events of significance which foster ethnic pride and
exemplify the cultural diversity that  represents  and  strengthens  the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 199th Anniversary of Bolivian  Independence  Day  to  be
celebrated on August 6, 2024; and be it further
