  million or more and owned by certain veterans or their family members
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  2  of subdivision 1 of section 458 of the real
 property tax law, as amended by chapter 425 of  the  laws  of  2014,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (2)  Except  as  provided in subdivision five of this section, no such
 exemption on account of eligible funds paid on account  of  military  or
 naval  services  rendered by an individual shall be allowed in excess of
 seven thousand five hundred dollars; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IN A CITY WITH A
 POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE, AN EXEMPTION ON ACCOUNT  OF  ELIGIBLE
 FUNDS PAID ON ACCOUNT OF MILITARY OR NAVAL SERVICES RENDERED BY AN INDI-
 VIDUAL SHALL EQUAL FORTY PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE FUNDS, BUT IN NO CASE SHALL
 SUCH  EXEMPTION  BE  ALLOWED  IN EXCESS OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. For the
 purposes of this subdivision any established exemption, or newly claimed
 exemption, or an aggregate thereof, as the case may be, in excess of any
 multiple of fifty dollars shall be regarded as being the nearest  multi-
 ple  of  fifty dollars and allowed in such amount. If the amount of such
 exemption has no nearest multiple of fifty dollars, it shall be regarded
 as being the next higher multiple of fifty dollars and allowed  in  such
 amount.  The  mingling  of such eligible funds with other funds or their
 retention by the United States for insurance premiums shall not bar  the
 granting of a claim for such exemption.
  §  2.  Subdivision  2  of section 458 of the real property tax law, as
 amended by section 82 of part PP of chapter 56 of the laws of  2022,  is

  2.  Real  property  purchased  with  moneys  collected  by  popular
 subscription in partial recognition of extraordinary  services  rendered
 by  any  veteran  of world war one, world war two, or of the hostilities
 which commenced June twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred fifty, who (a) was
 honorably  discharged  from such service, or (b) has a qualifying condi-
 tion, as defined in section one of the veterans' services law,  and  has
 received  a  discharge  other than bad conduct or dishonorable from such
 service, or (c) is a discharged LGBT veteran, as defined in section  one
 of  the  veterans' services law, and has received a discharge other than

 owned by the person who sustained such injuries, or by his or her spouse
 or unremarried surviving spouse,  or  dependent  father  or  mother,  is
 subject  to taxation as herein provided. Such property shall be assessed
 in the same manner as other real property in the tax  district.  At  the
 meeting  of the assessors to hear complaints concerning the assessments,
 a verified application for the exemption  of  such  real  property  from
 taxation  may be presented to them by or on behalf of the owner thereof,
 which application must show the facts on which the exemption is claimed,
 including the amount of moneys so raised  and  used  in  or  toward  the
 purchase  of  such  property.  No  exemption on account of any such gift
 shall be allowed in excess of five thousand dollars; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
 IN  ANY  CITY  WITH A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE, NO EXEMPTION ON
 ACCOUNT OF ANY GIFT SHALL BE ALLOWED IN EXCESS OF TWO THOUSAND  DOLLARS.
 The  application  for  exemption  shall  be presented and action thereon
 taken in the manner provided by subdivision one of this section.  If  no
 application  for  exemption be granted, the property shall be subject to
 taxation for all  purposes.  The  provisions  herein,  relating  to  the
 assessment  and  exemption  of  property purchased with moneys raised by
 popular subscription, apply and shall  be  enforced  in  each  municipal
 corporation authorized to levy taxes.
