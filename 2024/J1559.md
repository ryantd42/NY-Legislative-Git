  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 14, 2024, as  World  Diabetes  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
serious diseases by proclaiming official days  dedicated  to  increasing
awareness of such concerns impacting citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim November 14, 2024, as
World Diabetes Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Diabetes Day (WDD) was created in 1991 by IDF and the
World Health Organization in response  to  growing  concerns  about  the
escalating health threat posed by diabetes; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Diabetes Day became an official United Nations Day in
2006  with  the passage of United Nation Resolution 61/225; it is marked
every year on November 14th, the birthday of Sir Frederick Banting,  who
co-discovered insulin along with Charles Best in 1922; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Diabetes  is considered to have been around since 1550 BC;
the successful extraction and  injection  of  insulin  into  humans  was
discovered  in 1922; so, comparatively, our understanding of diabetes is
quite new compared to its long, arduous march through history; and
 
  WHEREAS, The difference between type II and type  I  started  around
1850,  where medical professionals at the time believed they knew enough
of the difference between the two to warrant two categories; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since then, type II diabetes has ballooned to 90 percent of
those affected, with an  estimated  $425  million  individuals  affected
worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This alarming rise in such a preventable disease is one of
the reasons the WHO and IDF wanted to create World Diabetes Day, to help
spread awareness of how to prevent contracting the illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Having to manage blood sugar levels on a daily basis  is  a
time-consuming  and  costly  endeavor,  as the economic cost of diabetes
globally is around $727 billion (USD) and  in  the  US  alone  it  costs
almost a third of that, at $245 billion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  costliness and its prevention create even more reason
for us to spread awareness of diabetes, and also celebrate the birth  of
the  man  who helped bring insulin into the modern world as an effective
treatment against this disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  disease,  and  more  must  be  done to increase activity at the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim November 14, 2024, as
World Diabetes Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
