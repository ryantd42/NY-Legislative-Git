  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 28, 2024, as Data Privacy Day in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 28, 2024, as  Data
Privacy Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National Data Privacy Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Data  Privacy Day began in the United States in January of
2008, and commemorates the January 28, 1981, signing of Convention  108,
the  first legally binding international treaty dealing with privacy and
data protection; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Data Privacy Day is observed in the  United  States,
Canada, Israel and 47 European countries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Cyber  Security  Alliance (NCSA) officially
leads the Data Privacy Day campaign and is advised  by  a  distinguished
advisory  committee  of privacy professionals to help the campaign align
with the most current privacy issues in a thoughtful and meaningful way;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Data  Privacy  Day's  educational  initiative  originally
focused on raising awareness among businesses as well as users about the
importance  of  protecting  the  privacy  of  their personal information
online, particularly in the context of social networking; and
 
  WHEREAS, The educational focus has expanded over the past  15  years
to include families, consumers and businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to its educational initiative, Data Privacy Day
promotes  events  and  activities  that  stimulate  the  development  of
technology  tools  that  promote  individual  control  over  personally
identifiable  information;  encourages  compliance with privacy laws and
regulations; and  creates  dialogue  among  stakeholders  interested  in
advancing data protection and privacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many examples abound of the perils of poor data management;
lives  and  livelihoods  can  be  destroyed by theft of identity, credit
information, and the like, including the denial of a loan or new  credit
card,  removal  from one's hard-earned state of financial stability, and
the mental duress of loss of privacy  and  security  of  one's  personal
information and data; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  threat  of  data breaches and data theft continues to
loom large and continues  to  grow  and  plague  more  New  Yorkers  and
Americans each day; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  As  more commerce, communication, and other aspects of the
daily lives of New Yorkers occur digitally, it is  more  important  than
ever  to  be  educated on the safe practices of data privacy and safety,
and to take steps whenever possible to increase data security; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be  greater  awareness  of  the
importance  of  data privacy, and more must be done to increase activity
at the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 28, 2024, as Data
Privacy Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
