 AN ACT to amend the alcoholic  beverage  control  law,  in  relation  to
  changing the duration of certain licenses
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 57-a of the  alcoholic  beverage  control  law,  as
 added by chapter 504 of the laws of 1975, is amended to read as follows:
  §  57-a.  Change  in  duration  of  licenses.  The liquor authority is
 authorized to change the periods during which the licenses authorized by
 sections FIFTY-ONE, FIFTY-ONE-A, fifty-three-a,  fifty-four,  fifty-five
 and  fifty-five-a  shall  be effective and to establish the commencement
 dates, duration and expiration dates  thereof,  provided  that  no  such
 license  shall  be effective for a period in excess of three years. When
 any change or changes are made in the duration of any such license,  the
 license  fee  shall be equal to the annual license fee specified in this
 article multiplied by the number of years  for  which  such  license  is
 issued.  The liquor authority may make such rules as shall be appropri-
 ate to carry out the purpose of this section.
  § 2. Section 67 of the alcoholic beverage control law, as  amended  by
 chapter 703 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  §  67.  License  fees,  duration  of  licenses;  fee for part of year.
 Effective April first, nineteen hundred  eighty-three,  licenses  issued
 pursuant  to  sections  sixty-one,  sixty-two,  sixty-three, sixty-four,
 sixty-four-a, sixty-four-b, SIXTY-FOUR-C and sixty-four-e of this  arti-
 cle  shall  be effective for three years at three times that annual fee,
 except that, in implementing the purposes of this  section,  the  liquor
 authority shall schedule the commencement dates, duration and expiration
 dates  thereof  to provide for an equal cycle of license renewals issued
 under each such section through the course of the fiscal year. Effective
 December first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, licenses issued  pursuant

 to  sections  sixty-four,  sixty-four-a and sixty-four-b of this article
 shall be effective for two years at two times that  annual  fee,  except
 that, in implementing the purposes of this section, the liquor authority
 shall  schedule  the  commencement  dates, duration and expiration dates
 thereof to provide for an equal cycle of license renewals  issued  under
 each such section through the course of the fiscal year. Notwithstanding
 the  foregoing,  commencing  on December first, nineteen hundred ninety-
 eight and concluding on July thirty-first, two thousand two, a  licensee
 issued  a license pursuant to section sixty-four, sixty-four-a or sixty-
 four-b of this article may elect to remit the fee for  such  license  in
 equal  annual  installments.  Such  installments  shall  be due on dates
 established by the liquor authority and the failure  of  a  licensee  to
 have  remitted  such  annual  installments  after  a due date shall be a
 violation of this chapter. For licenses issued for less than the  three-
 year  licensing  period,  the license fee shall be levied on a pro-rated
 basis. The entire license fee shall be due and payable at  the  time  of
 application. The liquor authority may make such rules as shall be appro-
 priate to carry out the purpose of this section.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.  Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation  of  this act on its effective date are authorized to be made and
 completed on or before such effective date.
