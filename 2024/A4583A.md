 actions.
  Home health care has [only recently] LONG  been  recognized  [legisla-
 tively]  as  an integral part of the health care delivery system and has

 DEPARTMENTS  AND  MENTAL  HEALTH  PROVIDERS IN THE PROVISION OF PRIMARY,
 PREVENTIVE, PUBLIC HEALTH, PRE-ACUTE,  POST-ACUTE  AND  LONG-TERM  CARE,
 thereby  avoiding prolonged institutionalization, concomitant high costs
 and associated adverse social and medical implications.
  The legislature intends that there  be  a  public  commitment  to  the
 appropriate provision and [expansion] ACCESSIBILITY of services rendered
 to the residents of the state by [certified] home [health] CARE SERVICES
 agencies,  [to]  INCLUDING  FINANCIAL  AND PROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT FOR: the

 ERATION THE ELEMENTS OF COST, GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENTIALS IN THE ELEMENTS
 OF  COST  CONSIDERED, ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE AREA IN WHICH THE SERVICES
 ARE TO BE DELIVERED.
  3. Prior to the approval of [such] THE rates, the  commissioner  shall
 determine  and  certify  to  the  state  director of the budget that the
 proposed rate schedules for payments for certified  home  health  agency
 services  or services provided by long term home health care programs or
 AIDS home care programs [are reasonably related  to  the  costs  of  the
 efficient production of such services. In making such certification, the
 commissioner  shall  take  into  consideration  the  elements  of  cost,
 geographical differentials in the elements of cost considered,  economic
 factors  in the area in which the certified home health agency, provider
 of a long term home health care program or provider of an AIDS home care
 program is located, costs of certified home health  agencies,  providers
 of  long  term  home health care programs or providers of AIDS home care
 programs of comparable size, and the  need  for  incentives  to  improve
 services and institute economies] MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION.
  (a)  [Demonstration  rates]  RATES  of payment or fees shall be estab-
 lished IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SECTION for telehealth services  provided
 by  a certified home health agency, a long term home health care program

 services to patients with conditions or clinical  circumstances  associ-
 ated  with  the  need  for  frequent  monitoring,  [and/or] the need for
 frequent  physician, skilled nursing or acute care services, [and] where

 for  on-site  or  in-office  visits  or acute or long term care facility
 admissions, OR WHERE THE TELEHEALTH SERVICES APPROPRIATELY ALLOW  FOR  A
 HOME  CARE  SERVICE  BY  MEANS  OF  TELEHEALTH  TECHNOLOGY INSTEAD OF AN
 IN-PERSON VISIT BY THE HOME CARE SERVICES AGENCY. [Such] THE  conditions
 and clinical circumstances shall include, but not be limited to, conges-
 tive  heart  failure,  diabetes,  chronic pulmonary obstructive disease,

  § 6. Subdivision 8 of section 4403-f of  the  public  health  law,  as
 amended  by  section  21 of part B of chapter 59 of the laws of 2016, is
 amended to read as follows:
  8.  Payment  rates  for managed long term care plan enrollees eligible
 for medical assistance. The commissioner shall establish  payment  rates
 for  services  provided  to  enrollees  eligible  under title XIX of the
 federal social security act. Such payment  rates  shall  be  subject  to
 approval by the director of the division of the budget and shall reflect
 savings to both state and local governments when compared to costs which
 would  be incurred by such program if enrollees were to receive compara-
 ble health and long term care services on a fee-for-service basis in the
 geographic region in which such services are proposed  to  be  provided.
 Payment rates shall be risk-adjusted to take into account the character-
 istics  of  enrollees, or proposed enrollees, including, but not limited
 to:  frailty, disability level,  health  and  functional  status,  age,
 gender,  the  nature  of  services provided to such enrollees, and other
 factors as determined by the commissioner. The  risk  adjusted  premiums
 may  also  be  combined  with  disincentives or requirements designed to
 mitigate any incentives to obtain higher payment categories. In  setting
 such  payment  rates, the commissioner shall consider costs borne by the
 managed care program to ensure actuarially sound and adequate  rates  of
 payment  to ensure quality of care shall comply with all applicable laws
 and regulations, state and federal, including [regulations as  to],  BUT
 NOT  LIMITED  TO, THOSE RELATING TO WAGES, LABOR AND actuarial soundness
 [for medicaid managed care]. FOR PREMIUMS EFFECTIVE ON AND  AFTER  APRIL
 FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL FURTHER CONSID-
 ER  INCREASES  TO PREMIUMS TO ADDRESS COST AND REIMBURSEMENT ADJUSTMENTS
 REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE
 THIRTY-SIX OF THIS CHAPTER AND SECTION THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE-A OF THE
 SOCIAL SERVICES LAW MADE BY THE CHAPTER OF  THE  LAWS  OF  TWO  THOUSAND
 TWENTY-THREE THAT AMENDED THIS SUBDIVISION.
  §  7.  The  superintendent of financial services, in consultation with
 the commissioner of health, and representatives of state-licensed health
 insurers, home care service agencies  and  consumers  (including  family
 members  of  consumers),  labor  organizations  representing  home  care
 service workers, and respective statewide associations or organizations,
 shall examine the terms of coverage for home care services as  specified
 in articles 32 and 43 of the insurance law and, on or before December 1,
 2023, report to the legislature and governor on the following:
  a. The extent to which these coverage terms, including coverage exclu-
 sions  as  well as riders that permit the purchase of expanded coverage,
 are aligned with state of the art medical and health system practice for
 providing in-home care;
  b. The extent to which state incentives  for  purchase  of  home  care
 service coverage, including expanded coverage, may be cost-beneficial to
 recipients,  to  the  health  care  system, and state medical assistance
 program specifically; and
  c. Recommendations for modifications of articles  32  and  43  of  the
 insurance  law,  and  such  other laws, including the public health law,
 workers' compensation law, social services law, mental hygiene  law  and
 elder  law, as would align the terms of home care coverage with state of
 the art medical and health system practices.
  § 8. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 the  amendments  to subdivision 8 of section 4403-f of the public health
 law made by section six of this act shall be subject to  the  repeal  of
 such section and shall be deemed repealed therewith.
