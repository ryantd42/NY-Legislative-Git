  COMMEMORATING the 50th Anniversary of the New York
  Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements of those  individuals  and  organizations  that  contribute
substantially  to their communities, thereby enhancing the well-being of
the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of New York Thoroughbred  Breeding  and
Development Fund and its promotional partner New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  New  York  Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund
Corporation, now located in Saratoga Springs,  has  helped  support  New
York-bred  racehorses  for  more  than five decades, shaping our state's
Thoroughbred industry since it was established by New York lawmakers  in
1973 and became operational in 1974; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  half-century  later,  the  mission  of  the  New  York
Thoroughbred  Breeding  and  Development  Fund  remains  to  promote  by
monetary  incentives  the  responsible  breeding of quality Thoroughbred
racehorses, in keeping with the founding  legislation  to  preserve  New
York's irreplaceable farmland; and
 
  WHEREAS, The NY-bred program has grown and adapted over the years to
become the benchmark of Thoroughbred programs around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund is
a public benefit corporation that oversees the registration process  for
foals  and  stallions, and distributes incentives in the form of awards;
and
 
  WHEREAS, New York's Thoroughbred breeding industry has a $53 billion
annual economic impact on New  York's  economy,  and  benefits  counties
across  the  State  by generating hundreds of millions of dollars in tax
revenue; and
 
  WHEREAS, Awards  paid  to  breeders  and  owners  of  New  York-bred
Thoroughbreds  are gleaned from on-track and off-track wagers to provide
incentives to breed and race horses on New York racetracks; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  this  Golden  Anniversary  year,  the  "New  York-bred
Showcase  Day" will be conducted the day after the Belmont Stakes, which
will be run for the first time at  historic  Saratoga  Race  Track  this
June; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  the Showcase, NY-breds will compete only against their
fellow state-breds for more than a million dollars in purse money; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York  State  Breeding  and  Development  Fund  also
administers  a  dedicated  aftercare fund in support of Thoroughbreds at
every stage of life, from newborn foal to retired  racehorse,  and  will
 
host  a "Salute to Aftercare" event at the National Museum of Racing and
Hall of Fame in September; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  fitting  and  proper  for this Legislative Body to
celebrate the milestone 50th Anniversary of the New York State  Breeding
and  Development  Fund  and  its contribution to our state's rich racing
tradition, vital  economy,  vast  agricultural  resources  and  thriving
tourism  industry  on  an  international, national, statewide, and local
scale; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  50th Anniversary of the New York Thoroughbred Breeding
and Development Fund; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  Executive  Director  of  the New York Thoroughbred
Breeding And Development Fund, Tracy Egan.
