 prevention  shall  conduct a study on the differential health impacts of
 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on transgender and non-binary racial
 and ethnic minorities in New York state. The purpose of the study  shall
 be to:
  (a)  identify  COVID-19  statewide  and  regional  rates of infection,
 hospitalization, recovery and mortality rates for transgender  and  non-
 binary  racial  and  ethnic  minorities and identify disparities in such
 rates, and the  potential  medical,  environmental,  and  system-related
 factors that may have contributed to such disparities;
  (b)  review  the  extent  to  which disparities in COVID-19 infection,
 hospitalization, recovery and mortality rates for transgender  and  non-
 binary  racial and ethnic minorities in any geographic area indicate the
 need to increase access to health  care  services  and  availability  of
 disparity mitigation and prevention strategies in that area;
  (c)  identify  ways  to reduce or eliminate transgender and non-binary
 racial and  ethnic  health  care  discrimination  and  disparities  that
 contributed  to  disparities  in  COVID-19  infection,  hospitalization,
 recovery and mortality rates; and
  (d)  identify  the  extent  to  which  COVID-19  regulations  and/or
 restrictions  led to any disparities in health care treatment for trans-
 gender and non-binary racial and ethnic minorities.
  2. Within one year after the effective date of this act, the office of
 minority health and disparities prevention shall prepare and  submit  to
 the  governor, the temporary president of the senate, the speaker of the
