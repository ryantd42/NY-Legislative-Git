  COMMEMORATING  the  220th  Anniversary  of  the
  Independence of Haiti from France
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored traditions, it is the intent of this  Legislative  Body  to
commemorate  the  220th  Anniversary  of  the Independence of Haiti from
France; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January 1,  1804,  after  a  prolonged  struggle,  Haiti
proclaimed its independence from France, becoming the second independent
state in the Western Hemisphere and the first free black republic in the
world; and
 
  WHEREAS, After gaining its independence, Haiti was charged by France
what  would  have been $20 billion U.S. dollars today as reparations for
its independence; this debt was not fulfilled until 1922; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States did not  acknowledge  Haiti  until  1862,
when Frederick Douglass visited to establish diplomatic relations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration  of  Haitian  independence  affirms  the
culture, identity and self-esteem of a people; it honors a rich heritage
and illuminates Haitian history and tradition, as well as the spirit  of
an indomitable people; and
 
  WHEREAS, The people of this great State and Nation and Haiti enjoy a
deep  and  abiding  relationship rooted in kinship and culture, and many
New Yorkers proudly trace their own roots to Haiti; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Anniversary of the Independence of Haiti from France is
a time to celebrate the aspirations and values  that  have  been  shared
with  Haitians  for  generations  and  to  recognize  the  countless
contributions of Americans and New Yorkers of Haitian descent  to  every
aspect of society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York is greatly enriched by its large
population of citizens of Haitian ancestry; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 220th Anniversary of Haiti's independence  provides  an
opportunity  to recognize the significance of their contributions to the
quality and character of life, and, through events and  activities,  for
all  people  to  gain  a  greater  appreciation  of  Haitian history and
traditions, and of the role Haitian  Americans  have  played,  and  will
continue to play, in our society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
 
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 220th Anniversary of  the  Independence  of  Haiti  from
France.
