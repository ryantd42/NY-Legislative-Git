  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to honor and
recognize those dedicated  professionals,  who  strive  to  enhance  the
quality  of  education  for  our  students,  and  whose  character,
accomplishments and community contributions inspire all citizens of this
great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is  justly  proud  to  honor  Heather
O'Connell  upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation as recipient of the
Manilow Music Project Teacher Award by music icon Barry  Manilow  to  be
presented on Saturday, August 19, at a special backstage ceremony on the
night of his concert at Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona, New York;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year's  esteemed Manilow Music Project Teacher Award
recognizes an outstanding music teacher who helps bring  music  to  life
for their students; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  2002 Songwriters Hall of Fame Inductee, Barry Manilow's
incredible career featuring Grammy, Emmy, and TONY Award wins has  given
him  the  opportunity  to  give back to the community; the Manilow Music
Project has given away over ten million  dollars'  worth  of  funds  and
music instrument donations to deserving music programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With many school music programs becoming severely depleted
and even terminated, the Manilow Music Project aims  to  keep  music  in
schools; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  Oneida  High  School  music teacher, Heather O'Connell
surpassed nine other finalists to win the $10,000 award from the singer;
the prize comes with a $5,000 cash award and another $5,000 in  "Manilow
bucks"  to  allow  her to buy musical instruments for her school's music
program; and
 
  WHEREAS, Located in the city of Oneida  in  Madison  County,  Oneida
High  School  has  about  600 students; undoubtedly a caring individual,
Heather O'Connell plans to purchase instruments  for  the  students  and
support  the  community  outreach  program  in the school with the prize
money; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Oneida City School District  is  indeed  fortunate  and
blessed  to have such a dedicated and respected educator; her wisdom and
contributions reach into every classroom, truly making a  difference  in
the lives of those lucky enough to work with her; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  significant contributor to education in New York State,
Heather O'Connell has continually demonstrated an impressive dedication,
an unparalleled devotion, and an unremitting enthusiasm for the  quality
of  the  educational  programs  and opportunities offered at Oneida High
 
School for the benefit of its faculty and students, as well as  for  the
entire community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  arts, in whatever form depicted, are central to human
expression; they are truly a universal language and  their  contribution
to  the  development  of  friendship and understanding among all peoples
cannot be underestimated; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Heather  O'Connell  upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation  as
recipient of the Manilow Music Project Teacher Award by music icon Barry
Manilow; and be it further
