 AN  ACT  to establish a study committee on the housing aspect of tourism
  in the state of New York; and to amend chapter  225  of  the  laws  of
  2010,  amending  the multiple dwelling law and the administrative code
  of the city of New York  relating  to  clarifying  certain  provisions
  relating  to  occupancy  of class A multiple dwellings, in relation to
  postponing the effective date thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. The legislature finds and declares that tourism, including
 tourism in the city of New York, is a vital and important  part  of  the
 economy  of the state of New York creating thousands of jobs and produc-
 ing needed tax revenues both in sales tax receipts, occupancy taxes  and
 income tax revenue. It further finds and declares that an important part
 of  the  tourism  industry  in  the city of New York have been rooms and
 affordable housing accommodations made available in mixed use  buildings
 serving  as  an  alternative  to higher end, more expensive hotels which
 some tourists, such as students, simply cannot afford. Furthermore,  the
 legislature  also finds and declares that unless alternative, affordable
 rooms and affordable housing accommodations  remain  available,  tourism
 will  decline,  jobs will be lost and the state during a perilous fiscal
 condition will lose revenue and jobs. The legislature finds and declares
 that it is important to avoid any change in the current choice of accom-
 modations available to visitors of our state until there is  a  thorough
 economic  impact study undertaken regarding the role of affordable tour-
 ism units and the negative effect that the elimination  of  these  units
 could  have  on the economy of the state of New York and the city of New
 York.
  § 2. There is hereby established a  study  committee  on  the  housing
 aspect  of the tourism industry in the state of New York. Such committee

 modations play in the tourism industry in the state of New York, and the
 potential  economic  impact  that  could  result from the elimination or
 substantial elimination of consumer choices in the market place.
  The department of  economic  development  shall  make  its  staff  and
 resources  available  to  the committee to compile the report as well as
