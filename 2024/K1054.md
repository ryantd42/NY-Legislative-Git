  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to inform key audiences about the role
and value of those workers who are helping to make a difference in  food
service delivery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim February 5-9, 2024, as
Pride in Foodservice Week in the State of New York, in conjunction  with
the observance of National Foodservice Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Observed annually from the first Monday in February, Pride
in Foodservice Week recognizes  food  and  nutrition  professionals  and
other  members  of  nutrition  services  teams  for  their hard work and
dedication to their job; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pride in Foodservice Week was initiated by the  Association
of  Nutrition  &  Foodservice Professionals (ANFP), a nationwide body of
over  30  years  that  started  first  as  Hospital,  Institution,  and
Educational  Food  Service  Society  in  1960,  then  Dietary  Managers
Association in the 1980s, and finally its current name in 2012; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the ANFP includes  more  than  14,000  professionals
dedicated  to the practice of providing optimum nutritional care through
foodservice management; and
 
  WHEREAS, ANFP members work in hospitals,  long-term  care,  schools,
correctional  facilities, and other non-commercial foodservice settings;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  association  provides  foodservice  reference,
publications  and resources, employment services for members, continuing
education and professional development, and certification  programs;  it
also  monitors industry trends and legislative issues, and publishes one
of the industry's most respected magazines; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  take  note  of
and  publicly  acknowledge  individuals  such as foodservice workers who
distinguish themselves through their exemplary careers, accomplishments,
and purposeful lives of service to their community and their profession;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim February 5-9, 2024, as
Pride in Foodservice Week in the State of New York; and be it further
