  §  3.  The tenth undesignated paragraph of section 1005 of the public
 authorities law, as added by chapter 55 of the laws of 1992, is  amended
 to read as follows:
  The  authority is further authorized, as deemed feasible and advisable
 by the trustees, to acquire,  maintain,  manage,  operate,  improve  and
 reconstruct as a project or projects of the authority one or both of the
 steam  generation  facilities  owned  by the state known as the Sheridan
 [avenue] AVENUE steam [generating] plant [on Sheridan avenue in the city
 of Albany and used to supply steam to state facilities],  together  with
 any  properties,  buildings and equipment at the sites thereof or ancil-
 lary thereto, for the generation and sale  of  thermal  energy  and  the
 cogeneration  and sale of electricity for use by facilities of the state
 within the county of Albany. All the authority's  costs,  including  its
 acquisition,  capital,  operating and maintenance costs, shall be recov-
 ered fully from the customers receiving service  from  such  project  or
 projects.  Thermal  energy and electricity not required by the state may
 be sold by the authority to others. The authority is not  authorized  to
 use  refuse or refuse-derived fuel in operating the project or projects.
 AS OF THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF
 SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  FOUR  OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW, ALL OF THE ENERGY,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO HEAT, COOLING AND ELECTRICITY, PRODUCED  AT
 THE  SHERIDAN AVENUE STEAM PLANT SHALL UTILIZE RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS.
 Any agreement for such acquisition shall insure that  the  authority  is
 not  liable  or otherwise responsible for circumstances arising from the
 prior operation of such facilities. The acquisition and purchase of such
 land, buildings and equipment by the authority, and any actions taken to
 effect such  acquisition  and  purchase,  are  hereby  exempt  from  the
 provisions  of  article eight of the environmental conservation law. The
 application of such exemption shall be strictly limited to the  acquisi-
 tion and purchase of such land, buildings and equipment by the authority
 and  such  agreements  with  the  state. Nothing herein shall exempt the
 authority from  otherwise  applicable  laws  respecting  the  expansion,
 conversion, operation and maintenance of such land, buildings and equip-
 ment.  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE TERMS "RENEWABLE ENERGY
 SYSTEMS" AND "SHERIDAN AVENUE STEAM PLANT" SHALL HAVE THE SAME  MEANINGS
 AS IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED FOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
