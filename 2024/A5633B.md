 to read as follows:
  The authority is further authorized, as deemed feasible and  advisable
 by  the  trustees,  to  acquire,  maintain, manage, operate, improve and
 reconstruct as a project or projects of the authority one or both of the
 steam generation facilities owned by the state  known  as  the  Sheridan
 [avenue] AVENUE steam [generating] plant [on Sheridan avenue in the city
 of  Albany  and used to supply steam to state facilities], together with
 any properties, buildings and equipment at the sites thereof  or  ancil-
 lary  thereto,  for  the  generation  and sale of thermal energy and the
 cogeneration and sale of electricity for use by facilities of the  state
 within  the  county  of Albany. All the authority's costs, including its
 acquisition, capital, operating and maintenance costs, shall  be  recov-
 ered  fully  from  the  customers receiving service from such project or
 projects. Thermal energy and electricity not required by the  state  may
 be  sold  by the authority to others. The authority is not authorized to
 use refuse or refuse-derived fuel in operating the project or  projects.
 AS  OF  THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF
 SECTION TWO HUNDRED FOUR OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW,  ALL  OF  THE  ENERGY,
 INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED TO HEAT, COOLING AND ELECTRICITY, PRODUCED AT
 THE SHERIDAN AVENUE STEAM PLANT SHALL UTILIZE RENEWABLE ENERGY  SYSTEMS.
 Any  agreement  for  such acquisition shall insure that the authority is
 not liable or otherwise responsible for circumstances arising  from  the
 prior operation of such facilities. The acquisition and purchase of such
 land, buildings and equipment by the authority, and any actions taken to
 effect  such  acquisition  and  purchase,  are  hereby  exempt  from the

 application  of such exemption shall be strictly limited to the acquisi-
 tion and purchase of such land, buildings and equipment by the authority
 and such agreements with the state.  Nothing  herein  shall  exempt  the
 authority  from  otherwise  applicable  laws  respecting  the expansion,
 conversion, operation and maintenance of such land, buildings and equip-
 ment. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE TERMS "RENEWABLE  ENERGY
 SYSTEMS"  AND "SHERIDAN AVENUE STEAM PLANT" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANINGS
 AS IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED FOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  § 4. Subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 90 of the public  buildings  law,
 as  added by section 5 of part RR of chapter 56 of the laws of 2023, are

 combustion  of fossil-fuels and associated co-pollutants with the excep-
 tion of back-up emergency generators and  redundant  systems  needed  to
 address  public health, safety and security, providing heating and cool-
 ing through thermal energy, and thermal energy networks,  from  non-com-
 A. 5633--A  6
 
 bustion  sources,  and to the greatest extent feasible producing on-site
 electricity that is one hundred percent renewable.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION, FOR PURPOSES OF THE EMPIRE STATE PLAZA
 COMPLEX,  SUCH  TERM SHALL MEAN MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUBDIVISIONS

 SECTION  NINETY-ONE OF THIS ARTICLE, AS SUCH REQUIREMENTS ARE APPLICABLE
 TO THE EMPIRE STATE PLAZA COMPLEX.
  3. "Highest-emitting facilities" means state-owned facilities that are
 among the highest producers of greenhouse gas emissions and collectively
 account for at least thirty percent of the greenhouse gas  emissions  as
 recorded  by the authority's Build Smart NY program established pursuant
 to Executive Order 88 of 2012.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS  OF  THIS
 SUBDIVISION,  ONE  OF  SUCH FACILITIES SHALL BE  THE EMPIRE STATE PLAZA
 COMPLEX. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE, THE "EMPIRE STATE PLAZA  COMPLEX"
 SHALL  HAVE  THE SAME MEANING AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH (E) OF SUBDIVISION
 ONE OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED FOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  § 5. The opening paragraph and paragraph  (g)  of  subdivision  1  and
 subdivision  2  of  section  91 of the public buildings law, as added by
 section 5 of part RR of chapter 56 of the laws of 2023, are amended  and
 a new paragraph (l) is added to subdivision 1 to read as follows:
  The authority is hereby authorized and directed to establish decarbon-
 ization action plans for fifteen of the highest-emitting facilities that
 will  serve  as  a basis for decarbonizing the facilities to the maximum
 extent practicable, and subject to  any  needed  redundant  systems  and
 back-up  systems  needed  for public safety and security.  [Decarboniza-
 tion] EXCEPT AS PROVIDED  IN  PARAGRAPH  (H)  OF  SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF
 SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  FOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW, DECARBONIZATION action
 plans shall address the following matters at a minimum:
  (g) [Identification] EXCEPT FOR THE EMPIRE STATE PLAZA DECARBONIZATION
 PLAN, IDENTIFICATION of any parts  of  the  facilities  that  cannot  be
 decarbonized, with explanations.
  (L)  IN  THE  CASE  OF  THE EMPIRE STATE PLAZA COMPLEX DECARBONIZATION
 ACTION PLAN, THE ITEMS LISTED IN PARAGRAPH (F) OF SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF
 SECTION TWO HUNDRED FOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  2.  [The]  EXCEPT  FOR  THE  DECARBONIZATION PLAN FOR THE EMPIRE STATE
 PLAZA COMPLEX, THE authority shall complete the  decarbonization  action
 plans  no  later  than  January  thirty-first,  two thousand twenty-six,
 provided that such date shall be extended for justifiable delay  outside
 the  control of the authority, including, but not limited to, previously
 planned or current major renovations or replacements to the  facilities,
 delayed permitting or approval by building owners, local authorities, or
 other essential parties, external resource bottlenecks, pending or unre-
 solved  investigations  into  utility  grid  capacity or similar circum-
 stances where crucial information is not yet  available  or  determined.
 Such  extension  shall  be  limited to the time necessary to address the
 factors causing such delay.  THE EMPIRE STATE DECARBONIZATION PLAN SHALL
 BE COMPLETED BY JANUARY THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND  TWENTY-SIX,  AND  NO
 EXCLUSIONS FOR JUSTIFIABLE DELAYS SHALL BE PERMITTED.
  § 6. Subdivisions 5, 6 and 7 of section 91 of the public buildings law
 are renumbered subdivisions 6, 7 and 8, and a new subdivision 5 is added
 to read as follows:
  5.  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO USE THE FUNDING PROVIDED IN
 SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION TO PREPARE THE  DECARBONIZATION  ACTION
 PLAN  FOR  THE EMPIRE STATE PLAZA COMPLEX, TO UPDATE OR MODIFY ANY STUDY
 OR PLAN UNDERTAKEN, WITH THE GOAL, IN  WHOLE  OR  IN  PART  OF  REDUCING
 GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSIONS APPLICABLE TO SUCH COMPLEX, OR TO PERFORM THE
 A. 5633--A  7

 ENGINEERING STUDY MANDATED BY PARAGRAPH  (D)  OF  SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF
 SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED FOUR OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW, PROVIDED THAT SUCH PLAN
 OR STUDY IN THE VIEW OF THE AUTHORITY WOULD PROVIDE  INFORMATION  USEFUL
 FOR ACHIEVING THE PURPOSES OF SUCH SECTION.
  § 7. This act shall take effect immediately.
