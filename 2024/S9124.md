 ROBUST PROTECTIONS FOR SAFEGUARDING THE PRIVACY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMA-
 TION  THAT  INDIVIDUALS  HAVE  ENTRUSTED TO THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHILE
 ALSO ENABLING ITS AGENCIES TO RESPONSIBLY SHARE  SUCH  INFORMATION  WITH
 EACH  OTHER  IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER BENEFITS, SERVICES AND CARE
 COORDINATION TO ITS POPULACE. STATE AUTHORITY FOR COOPERATIVE DATA-SHAR-
