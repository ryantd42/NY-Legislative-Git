  HONORING  Jane "The Fleetwood Assassin" Couch upon
  the occasion of her induction into the International
  Boxing Hall of Fame and Museum
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  acknowledge
outstanding  professionals  in  the  boxing  industry  who distinguished
themselves  through  their  exceptional  performance,  attaining
unprecedented  success  and  the  highest level of personal achievement;
Jane Couch is one such individual and her life of achievements  inspired
others  and  contributed  to  the respect and admiration of the sport of
boxing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Jane  "The  Fleetwood Assassin" Couch upon the occasion of her induction
into the International Boxing Hall of  Fame  and  Museum;  she  will  be
honored  within  the  Women's  Modern  category  of  boxers  at the 35th
Anniversary celebration from June 6-9, 2024, in Canastota, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on August 14, 1968 in Fleetwood, Lancashire,  England,
Jane Couch decided to start boxing after seeing a documentary on women's
boxing and becoming intrigued; based out of the Fleetwood Amateur Boxing
Club, she began boxing in 1994 at the age of 26; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  boxing  was  illegal  for women in the United Kingdom,
while fights were taking place, they were unlicensed; in  The  Fleetwood
Assassin's  fifth  contest,  she  traveled to Denmark to outpoint Sandra
Geiger to capture the WIBF light welterweight  title  in  1996  and  was
denied a license by the British Boxing Board of Control; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Unwilling  to  stand down to adversity, Jane Couch filed a
lawsuit to overturn the decision on the basis of sexual  discrimination;
in  a  landmark  ruling,  a tribunal overturned the decision in March of
1998 and Couch had won the right for women to box professionally; and
 
  WHEREAS, On November 25, 1998, Jane Couch made history as the  first
female  boxer  to legally enter a UK boxing ring when she stopped Simona
Lukic in two rounds; she would go on to win multiple world titles in the
light welterweight (WIBF, WBF, NABA, IWBF) and lightweight  (WIBF,  WBF)
divisions  and  score wins over Jaime Clampitt (W 10), Carla Witherspoon
(W 4) and Sharon Anyos (W 10); and
 
  WHEREAS, Following a loss to Anne Sophie Mathis  (TKO  by  2),  Jane
Couch  retired  in  December  2008  with  a record of 28-11 (9 KOs); she
remained in the sport  as  a  promoter  and,  in  2007,  "The  Fleetwood
Assassin" was awarded an MBE for services to the sport; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jane "The Fleetwood Assassin" Couch clearly contributed to
the spirit of excellence which  is  a  tradition  of  the  International
Boxing Hall of Fame; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals of such  outstanding  accomplishments  are  brought  to  our
 
attention,  they  should be recognized by all the citizens of this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Jane "The Fleetwood Assassin"  Couch  upon  the  occasion  of  her
induction  into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and Museum; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Jane "The Fleetwood Assassin" Couch.
