  COMMEMORATING  the 40th Anniversary of The Friends
  of the Outlet on April 21, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations which are dedicated to increasing
public awareness of, and appreciation for, the natural resources of  New
York,  recognizing  the  role  all  citizens  have  in  protecting  the
environment and the quality of life in this Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 40th Anniversary of The Friends of the Outlet on Sunday,
April 21, 2024; the organization will mark this  momentous  occasion  by
hosting  a  myriad of community events, starting with a painting project
at Cascade Falls; and
 
  WHEREAS, This initiative is part of a broader  effort  to  transform
the  historic  mill  site  into a vibrant picnic area along the 7.2-mile
Keuka Outlet Trail; and
 
  WHEREAS, The painting day aims to refresh the remaining buildings at
Cascade, now  a  hub  for  The  Friends  of  the  Outlet  organization's
activities,  including equipment storage, event organization, and summer
meetings; the project, which may  include  a  community  mural,  invites
volunteers  to contribute to the site's beautification, giving community
members a sense of contribution and pride  in  beautifying  their  local
natural landscapes and structures for the benefit of all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Friends of the Outlet's commitment to the Keuka Outlet
Trail and surrounding community is evident in the range of activities it
hosts and its enduring presence, growth, and the  sparkling  success  it
has experienced thus far; and
 
  WHEREAS, The work of this benevolent organization not only preserves
the  area's  natural  and historical beauty, but also fosters a sense of
community involvement and outdoor appreciation which undoubtedly  has  a
tremendous  positive impact on the local community, and as a result, the
State and Nation at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the welfare of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched
and reliably served by the purposeful endeavors of  organizations  which
are  committed  to  the  preservation of our natural environment and the
enhancement of the appreciation  of  the  distinctive  features  of  our
surroundings,  and to the economic well-being of the areas in which they
exist; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  40th Anniversary of The Friends of the Outlet on April
21, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to The Friends of the Outlet.
