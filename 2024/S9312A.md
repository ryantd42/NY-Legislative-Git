 follows:

 juvenile  jurisdiction  above fifteen years of age.  Notwithstanding any
 other provision of law to the contrary, counties and  the  city  of  New
 York  shall  not  be  required  to  contribute a local share of eligible
 expenditures that would not have been incurred absent the provisions  of
 [a] PART WWW OF chapter FIFTY-NINE of the laws of two thousand seventeen
 [that  added  this  section  unless  the most recent budget adopted by a
 county that is subject to the  provisions  of  section  three-c  of  the
 general  municipal  law  exceeded  the tax levy limit prescribed in such
 section or the local government is not  subject  to  the  provisions  of
 section  three-c  of  the general municipal law; provided, however, that
 the state budget director shall be authorized to waive any  local  share
 of  expenditures  associated  with a chapter of the laws of two thousand

 hardship waiver, the budget director shall consider the incremental cost
 to  the locality related to increasing the age of juvenile jurisdiction,
 changes in state or federal aid payments, and other extraordinary costs,
 including the occurrence of a disaster as  defined  in  paragraph  a  of
 subdivision two of section twenty of the executive law, repair and main-
 tenance  of  infrastructure,  annual  growth  in tax receipts, including
