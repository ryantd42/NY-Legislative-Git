  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 21, 2023, as Forest Day in the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to  promote  and  appreciate  New  York
State's natural resources which benefit the lives of its citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 21, 2023, as Forest
Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
International Day of Forests; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  2023  theme,  "Forests and health", was chosen by the
Collaborative Partnership on Forests; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2012, the United  Nations  General  Assembly  proclaimed
March  21st  as  the International Day of Forests (IDF) to celebrate and
raise awareness of the importance of all types of forests; each year  on
this  day,  countries  are  encouraged  to undertake local, national and
international efforts  to  organize  activities  involving  forests  and
trees, such as tree planting campaigns; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  1906,  Empire  State  Forest  Products  Association
(ESFPA) has been the forest products industry's source  for  information
and public affairs in New York State; this vital non-profit organization
for  businesses  and  individuals is dedicated to improving the business
climate for the forest products industry while promoting  management  of
New  York's  Forests  to meet the resource needs of today and for future
generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Forests purify the air we  breathe,  filter  the  water  we
drink,  prevent  erosion, and act as an important buffer against climate
change; they also offer a home to much of the world's diverse  array  of
plants  and  animals and provide essential natural resources from timber
and food to medicinal plants; and
 
  WHEREAS, Known as the lungs of the Earth, forests  are  like  giant,
green  sponges  all  over  the  globe, through which our Earth breathes;
trees and plants take in carbon dioxide and give us oxygen, cleaning our
air; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Forests  also  give  us  wood  for  construction,  paper,
furniture,  energy  and  so  much  more;  currently,  wood  accounts for
approximately 45% of the world's renewable energy supply; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Healthy  forests  mean  a  healthy  environment;  forests
stabilize  the  climate,  control  atmospheric  temperatures,  protect
watershed areas, regulate the water cycle, and enrich the soil; and
 
  WHEREAS, Forests also play an  important  role  in  preventing  soil
erosion, as well as stabilizing and maintaining its quality, and provide
 
a  home  to millions of species, sheltering and providing food for their
sustenance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition, forests are natural aqueducts, absorbing and
redistributing an estimated 95% of water; and
 
  WHEREAS, Forests, their sustainable management and use of resources,
including in fragile ecosystems, are key to  combating  climate  change,
and  to  contributing  to  the  prosperity and well-being of current and
future generations; forests  are  truly  one  of  our  greatest  natural
treasures that must be preserved and protected; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional natural resource and its contributions  to
the local and State economies; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 21, 2023, as  Forest
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and to the Empire State Forest Products Association.
