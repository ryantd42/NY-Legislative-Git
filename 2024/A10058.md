 Introduced  by M. of A. SHIMSKY -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Transportation
 
 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to  a  residen-
  tial  parking  system in the village of Sleepy Hollow in the county of
  Westchester
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 many residential areas in the village of Sleepy Hollow, including Sleepy
 Hollow  Manor,  Philipse Manor, Downtown Sleepy Hollow, and Webber Park,
 lack sufficient parking for residents of the village. Sleepy Hollow is a
 densely populated village, with a  population  of  4,452.1  persons  per
 square  mile, and the residential areas named lack sufficient off-street
 parking to accommodate residents' needs. This issue is  further  exacer-
 bated  by the proximity of these residential areas to the Philipse Manor
 train station and the Tarrytown train station, where many  non-residents
 find parking in order to take public transportation to and from work. In
 addition,  Sleepy  Hollow has a historical connection to Halloween, with
 it being a critical aspect of the milieu set by Washington Irving in his
 ubiquitous novel "The Legend of Sleepy  Hollow",  and  the  village  has
 become  a tourist destination with an estimated 100,000 visitors annual-
 ly, most of whom take up parking spots needed by residents. This lack of
 residential parking has resulted in traffic hazards, congestion, and air
 and noise pollution posing a hazard to residents and  other  pedestrians
 in these areas.
  The  legislature  further finds that a residential parking system will
 reduce such hazards and will reduce pollution levels.  The  legislature,
 therefore,  declares  the necessity of this act to authorize the village
 of Sleepy Hollow to adopt a residential  parking  system  in  accordance
 with the provisions of this act.
  §  2.  The  vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a new section
 1640-s to read as follows:
  § 1640-S. RESIDENTIAL PARKING SYSTEM IN THE VILLAGE OF  SLEEPY  HOLLOW
 IN  THE  COUNTY OF WESTCHESTER. 1. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ANY
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
