  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  grant  Michael V. Layman, a retiree of the New York
 State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System and  former  New  York
 State Police officer, additional service creditable for time worked as a
 university police officer. Such service is only creditable under a State
 Police  plan  upon  the  completion  of  20  years  and  the  successful
 completion of a course of law enforcement training within  one  year  of
 the date of appointment.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of approximately  $122,000  which
 will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This esti-
 mate assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
