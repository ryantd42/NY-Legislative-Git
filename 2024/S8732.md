 Introduced  by  Sen.  MYRIE  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive  law,  in  relation  to  establishing  the
  commission  for  the  modernization  and  revitalization  of downstate
  medical center
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The executive law is amended by adding a new article 49-C
 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 49-C
  COMMISSION FOR THE MODERNIZATION AND REVITALIZATION
  OF DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER
 SECTION 996. COMMISSION FOR  THE  MODERNIZATION  AND  REVITALIZATION  OF
  DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER.
  § 996. COMMISSION  FOR  THE  MODERNIZATION AND REVITALIZATION OF DOWN-
 STATE MEDICAL CENTER. 1.  LEGISLATIVE  INTENT.  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY
 FINDS  AND  DECLARES  THAT THE STATE UNIVERSITY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER
 ("DOWNSTATE") AS ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO
 OF THE EDUCATION LAW, IS A VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR  STATE'S  HEALTH  CARE
 SYSTEM.  AS  ONE OF THREE STATE HOSPITALS AND THE ONLY STATE HOSPITAL IN
 THE CITY OF NEW YORK, IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THIS
 HOSPITAL REMAINS FISCALLY VIABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE HEALTH  CARE
 SERVICES  THAT  THE RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL BROOKLYN DESERVE AND DEPEND ON.
 THE STATE UNIVERSITY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER  IS  ONE  OF  THE  STATE'S
 LARGEST  SAFETY-NET  HOSPITALS, WHICH CARES FOR ALL PATIENTS, REGARDLESS
 OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. IT PREDOMINANTLY SERVES PEOPLE  OF  COLOR,  LOW
 INCOME,  UNINSURED,  UNDERINSURED,  UNDOCUMENTED AND AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS
 WHO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND WHO ARE MORE PRONE
 TO SUFFER FROM SERIOUS DISEASE AND  FACE  HIGHER  MORBIDITY  RATES  THAN
 OTHER  PATIENTS  ACROSS  OUR CITY AND STATE. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-TWO,
 THE HOSPITAL HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUTPATIENT VISITS  AND  HAS
 AN  AVERAGE  OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND INPATIENTS EACH YEAR. IT ALSO PROVIDES
 SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS A YEAR  AND  SPONSORS
 OVER ONE HUNDRED COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECTS ANNUALLY.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 8732  2
 
  PROVIDED  FURTHER,  DOWNSTATE  IS IN THE HEART OF CENTRAL BROOKLYN AND
 HAS THE LARGEST MEDICAL SCHOOL IN NEW YORK CITY, WHICH  OFFERS  TRAINING
 IN  FIFTY-SIX  SPECIALTIES ACROSS FIVE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND ANNUALLY
 EDUCATES AND TRAINS NEARLY  ONE  THOUSAND  NINE  HUNDRED  STUDENTS.  THE
 MEDICAL  SCHOOL  STUDENT  POPULATION  IS MADE UP OF NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT
 STUDENTS OF COLOR, PRODUCES THE MOST PHYSICIANS OF COLOR IN THE STATE OF
 NEW YORK, AND NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF TWO THOUSAND  TWENTY-TWO  GRADU-
 ATES  REMAINED IN NEW YORK FOR THEIR RESIDENCY. HAVING A HOSPITAL AFFIL-
 IATED WITH THE MEDICAL SCHOOL IS  BOTH  CRITICAL  FOR  THE  TRAINING  OF
 MEDICAL  STUDENTS  AND IS AN ESSENTIAL PART IN PRODUCING THE NEXT GENER-
 ATION OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS,  WHICH  ARE  DESPERATELY  NEEDED  TO
 ENHANCE THE ACCESS TO VITAL HEALTH CARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER  FINDS  THAT THE ENTIRE BROOKLYN HEALTH CARE
 DELIVERY SYSTEM REMAINS IN  NEED  OF  A  CONTINUED  GLOBAL  EXAMINATION,
 ASSESSING  THE  NEEDS  OF EACH OF ITS DIVERSE COMMUNITIES, THE ACCESS TO
 HIGH QUALITY OF CARE THROUGHOUT BROOKLYN, THE DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH  CARE
 EQUITIES AND DISPARITIES OF EACH COMMUNITY, THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIAL-
 TY  SERVICES  FOR  LOW  INCOME  POPULATIONS,  AND  THE INTERCONNECTIVITY
 BETWEEN THE VARIOUS HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE LONG  TERM  FINAN-
 CIAL  SUSTAINABILITY  OF  EACH  OF  THE  VARIOUS DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN THE
 BOROUGH. SUCH FURTHER EXAMINATION CAN BEGIN WITH THE  MODERNIZATION  AND
 REVITALIZATION  OF  DOWNSTATE CONTINUING AS A HOSPITAL OFFERING CRITICAL
 HOSPITAL SPECIALTY SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY, BECOMING A CORE SPECIALTY
 HOSPITAL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THOSE CRITICAL SPECIALTY SERVICES, BUT
 SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDERTAKING AN  EXAMINATION  OF  THE  APPROPRIATENESS  OF
 CONVERTING  CERTAIN  DESIGNATED INPATIENT BEDS THAT ARE NOT UTILIZED FOR
 THE  SPECIALTY  HOSPITAL  CENTER  OF  EXCELLENCE  (PROVIDING  SPECIALTY
 SERVICES  PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION), TO AN OUTPA-
 TIENT SETTING, EXPANDING SERVICES TO INCLUDE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE THRU
 CLINICS, URGENT CARE OR OTHER HOSPITAL AFFILIATED MEDICAL PRACTICES.
  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT  THE  CONTINUED  OPERATION  OF  THE
 STATE UNIVERSITY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER AS A FREE-STANDING STATE-OPER-
 ATED  PUBLIC  HOSPITAL,  STAFFED  WITH  PUBLIC EMPLOYEES, AT ITS CURRENT
 LOCATION, WITHIN AND UNDER THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY OF THE STATE UNIVER-
 SITY OF NEW YORK IN A MODERNIZED AND  REVITALIZED  FORM,  IS  VITAL  AND
 NECESSARY,  AND  THE  STATE  SHOULD  DEVELOP A PLAN TO ENSURE ITS FUTURE
 SUSTAINABILITY AND SHALL  PROVIDE  STATE  FUNDING  AND  OTHER  RESOURCES
 NECESSARY  TO  IMPLEMENT AND EXECUTE SUCH PLAN. SUCH PLAN SHALL BE BASED
 ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION FOR THE MODERNIZATION AND REVI-
 TALIZATION OF DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER. THE COMMISSION FOR  THE  MODERN-
 IZATION  AND  REVITALIZATION  OF  DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER SHALL EXAMINE
 THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BE PROVIDED AT DOWNSTATE,  ALTERNA-
 TIVE SERVICES WHICH ARE MORE SUITABLE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WHICH ARE IN
 ADDITION TO THE CORE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE SPECIALTY SERVICES WHICH SHALL
 CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED AT DOWNSTATE.
