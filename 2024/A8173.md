  C. NOTWITHSTANDING SUBSECTION B OF THIS ARTICLE,  THE  COMMISSION  MAY
 DENY  A  STATE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPACT OR, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
 REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE 11.B, TERMINATE A MEMBER  STATE'S  PARTICIPATION
 IN  THE COMPACT, IF IT DETERMINES THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT OF A
 MEMBER STATE IS A MATERIAL DEPARTURE FROM  THE  COMPACT.  OTHERWISE,  IF
 THIS  COMPACT  SHALL  BE  HELD TO BE CONTRARY TO THE CONSTITUTION OF ANY
 MEMBER STATE, THE COMPACT SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND  EFFECT  AS  TO
 THE  REMAINING  MEMBER  STATES  AND  IN  FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AS TO THE
 MEMBER STATE AFFECTED AS TO ALL SEVERABLE MATTERS.
 ARTICLE 14. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL PREVENT OR INHIBIT THE ENFORCEMENT OF  ANY  OTHER
 LAW  OF  A  MEMBER  STATE THAT IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE COMPACT. ANY
 LAWS, STATUTES, REGULATIONS, OR OTHER LEGAL  REQUIREMENTS  IN  A  MEMBER
 STATE  IN  CONFLICT WITH THE COMPACT ARE SUPERSEDED TO THE EXTENT OF THE
 CONFLICT. ALL PERMISSIBLE AGREEMENTS  BETWEEN  THE  COMMISSION  AND  THE
 MEMBER STATES ARE BINDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR TERMS.
  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate  the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in
 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 section  one  of this act shall take effect as specifically set forth in
 such section.
