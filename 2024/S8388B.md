 AN ACT in relation to protecting the health insurance benefits of  reti-
  rees  of  public  employers  and  contributions  of retirees of public
  employers
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. This act shall be known as the "Health Equity for Retirees
 Act" or "(HERA)".
  § 2. 1. On and after the effective date of this act, a public employer
 shall not diminish the health insurance benefits  provided  to  retirees
 and  their  dependents or the contributions such employer makes for such
 health insurance coverage below the level of such benefits  or  contrib-
 utions  made  on  behalf  of  such retirees and their dependents by such
 public employer as of December 31, 2021.
  2. For the purposes of this act:
  (a) "diminish" shall mean any change in health care offered that could
 potentially make it harder for retirees  residing  anywhere  within  the
 United  States,  including  its  territories  and possessions, to access
 their health care than before such change was made. These changes  shall
 include,  but  are  not  limited  to, increasing the cost of such health
 care, reducing contributions made by a public employer, forcing retirees
 into Medicare Advantage Plans, forcing them to use health care providers
 only from pre-designated panels, or forcing them to wait for pre-author-
 ization for medical procedures that are recommended by their health care
 providers;

 care coverage offered to retirees and their dependents by public employ-
 ers,  including, but not limited to: (i) costs: this includes the amount
 of money (on either an absolute  or  proportional  basis)  retirees  and
 their dependents are charged for premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and
 copayments associated with any health care coverage; (ii) coverage: this
 encompasses  the  specific  services  and benefits covered by the health
 care  plan,  including  inpatient  and  outpatient  care,  preventative

 includes  the  ability  of  retirees  and their dependents to access any
 health care provider who accepts Medicare or participates in the offered
 plan's network, without restriction;
  (c) "public employer" shall mean the following: (i)  the  state  or  a
 civil  division  thereof;  (ii) a county, city, town or village; (iii) a

 education  and  extension  board  or  a school district as enumerated in
