BY: Senator MAYER
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  First
  Baptist Church of Mamaroneck, New York
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions and the many spiritual, social,  and
educational benefits they confer play a vital role in the development of
the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the tradition of this State and this Nation to pay
tribute to those institutions and individuals who  have  contributed  to
the ethical and spiritual values of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body takes pleasure in commemorating the
100th Anniversary of the First Baptist Church of Mamaroneck,  New  York;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  First Baptist Church had been heavily damaged by Hurricane
Ida in September of 2021; the horrific storm devastated Washingtonville,
the  125-acre  neighborhood  within  Mamaroneck,  known  as  the  Flats,
predominantly lower income people of color; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to planning documents for Washingtonville, dating
back  several  decades,  the  area  was  prone to flooding; however, the
intensity and magnitude of  Hurricane  Ida's  deluge  on  the  night  of
September 1, 2021, was unprecedented; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hurricane  Ida  caused  the  most  devastating flooding in
Washingtonville's recent history with a cost of $100 million,  affecting
more than 500 homes and destroying 310 vehicles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  First Baptist Church, which was built in 1938, is situated
only a few feet from the Mamaroneck  River;  since  its  inception,  the
church has endured many storms but none as destructive as Hurricane Ida;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  river  overflowed  its  banks  during the hurricane,
tearing a hole into the back of the church  and  filling  the  sanctuary
with  murky  water;  a  wall  outside  the  church was demolished by the
strength of the floodwaters; although the stained glass windows survived
the torrents, the interior of  the  building  required  the  removal  of
rotting pews and carpeting; and
 
  WHEREAS, Donations from the community aided in the rebuilding of the
church  which  cost $250,000; the renovation was completed in only seven
months, allowing the church to reopen its doors on Easter Sunday,  April
17, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  flood  risk  management  plan by the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with actions taken  by  officials  in
Mamaroneck,  could  mitigate  future  devastation;  however, there is no
clear timeline presently, perpetuating the uncertainty of  the  citizens
of the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, The residents of Mamaroneck have exemplified the resilience
and  determination  necessary  for rebuilding and moving forward; defeat
was not an option; compassion, kindness, and benevolence triumphed  over
loss, despair, and hopelessness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Reverend  James  E. Taylor, Pastor of First Baptist Church
for 35 years, led the  Easter  service  for  the  excited  and  grateful
worshipers who convened in celebration of new life and a new church; the
faithful  members  of  this  pillar  of  the  community  would  feel the
fellowship they had desired and greatly missed; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to take  note  of
enduring  religious  institutions  and to bring such institutions to the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of First Baptist Church of Mamaroneck,
New York, fully confident that this commemoration reflects the belief in
those  values  which  enhance the dignity and purpose of life; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to First Baptist Church.
