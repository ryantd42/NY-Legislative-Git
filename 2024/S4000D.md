  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

 authorized  to be paid as hereinafter provided, to the respective public

  b) Where applicable, appropriations made by this chapter for  expendi-
 tures from federal grants for state operations may be allocated for
 spending  from federal grants for any grant period beginning, during, or
 prior to, the state fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2023.
  c) The several amounts named herein, or so much thereof  as  shall  be
 sufficient  to  accomplish the purpose designated, being the undisbursed
 and/or unexpended balances of the prior year's appropriations, are here-
 by reappropriated from the same funds and made available  for  the  same
 purposes  as the prior year's appropriations, unless herein amended, for
 the fiscal year beginning April 1,  2023.  Certain  reappropriations  in
 this  chapter  are  shown using abbreviated text, with three leader dots

 underscores for additions, the purposes, amounts, funding source and all
 other aspects pertinent to each item of appropriation shall be  as  last
 appropriated.
  For  the  purpose  of  complying with the state finance law, the year,
 chapter and section of the last act reappropriating  a  former  original
 appropriation  or any part thereof is, unless otherwise indicated, chap-
 ter 50, section 1, of the laws of 2022.
  d) No moneys appropriated by  this  chapter  shall  be  available  for
 payment  until a certificate of approval has been issued by the director
 of the budget, who shall file such certificate with  the  department  of
 audit  and  control, the chairperson of the senate finance committee and
 the chairperson of the assembly ways and means committee.
  e) Notwithstanding any law to the  contrary,  because  the  funds  for
 certain  appropriations  specified in this chapter are to be used by the
 state education department, department of health, office of children and
 family services, office of temporary and disability  assistance,  office
 of  addiction services and supports, office of mental health, office for
 people with developmental disabilities, and the department  of  environ-
 mental  conservation  for  the  administration, oversight or alternative
 delivery of those programs within those agencies' budgets set  forth  in
 the  aid to localities budget bill submitted by the governor on February
 1, 2023 pursuant to article VII of the New York constitution,  no  funds
 under  those specified appropriations in this chapter shall be available
 for certification or payment until (i) the legislature has finally acted
 upon the appropriations for the aforementioned agencies contained in the
 aforementioned aid to localities budget bill, and (ii) the  director  of
 the budget has determined that those aid to localities appropriations as
 finally  acted  on  by  the  legislature  are sufficient for the ensuing
 fiscal year.
  f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any  of
 the  amounts appropriated herein may be increased or decreased by inter-
 change or transfer without limit, with any appropriation  of  any  other
 department,  agency  or public authority or by transfer or suballocation
 to any department, agency or public authority with the approval  of  the
 director of the budget.
  g)  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, for purposes
 of any appropriation made by this chapter which authorizes  spending  in
 an  amount net of refunds, rebates, reimbursements, credits, repayments,
 and/or disallowances, "refunds" shall mean funds received to  the  state
 resulting  from  the  overpayment  of monies, "rebates" shall mean funds
 received to the state resulting from a  return  of  a  full  or  partial
 amount  previously  paid,  as  for  goods  or  services,  serving  as  a
 reduction,  discount  or  rebate  to  the  original  payment  amount,
 "reimbursements"  shall mean funds received to the state as repayment in
 an equivalent amount for goods or services, including but not limited to
 personal service costs, incurred by the  state  in  the  first  instance
 being  provided  to  a third party for their benefit and partially or in
 full financed by such third  party,  "credit"  shall  mean  monies  made
 available  to  the  state  that reduce the amount owed to a third party,
 including but not limited to billing errors, rebates, and prior overpay-
 ments, "repayment" shall mean the return  of  monies  as  pay  back  for
 expenses  incurred,  and "disallowance" shall mean monies made available
 to the state that  were  not  allowed  or  accepted  officially  by  the
 intended recipient, based on a determination the payment is not accepta-
 ble  and/or valid. When the office of the state comptroller receives any
 such  refunds,  rebates,  reimbursements,  credits,  repayments,  and/or
  3  12550-02-3
 
 disallowances, he or she shall credit the refunded, rebated, reimbursed,
 credited,  repaid,  and disallowed amount back to the original appropri-
 ation and reduce expenditures in the year which such credit is  received
 regardless of the timing of the initial expenditure.
  h)  Notwithstanding  any provision of law to the contrary, upon enact-
 ment of this chapter of the laws of 2023 containing the state operations
 budget bill for the state fiscal year 2023-2024, all appropriations  and

  or expedited department  of  health  state

  a  natural  or  other  type  of  disaster,
  including a  governmental  declaration  of
  emergency.
 The  director of the budget, in consultation
  with the  commissioner  of  health,  shall
  assess  on  a  quarterly  basis  known and
  projected medicaid expenditures by catego-
  ry of service and by geographic region, as
  determined by the commissioner of  health,
  incurred  both  prior to and subsequent to
  such assessment for each such period,  and
  if  the  director of the budget determines
  that such  expenditures  are  expected  to
  cause medicaid spending for such period to
  exceed the aggregate limit specified here-
  in  for  such  period,  the state medicaid
  director, in consultation with the  direc-
  tor  of the budget and the commissioner of
  health, shall develop a  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment to limit such spend-
  ing to the aggregate limit specified here-
  in for such period.
 Such  medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  shall be designed, to reduce the  expendi-
  tures  authorized  by  the  appropriations
  herein in compliance  with  the  following
  guidelines:  (1)  reductions shall be made
  in compliance with applicable federal law,
  including the provisions  of  the  Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public

  Public  Law  No.  111-152  (collectively
  "Affordable  Care Act") and any subsequent
  amendments thereto or regulations  promul-
  gated  thereunder; (2) reductions shall be
  made in a manner that  complies  with  the
  state medicaid plan approved by the feder-
  al  centers  for  medicare  and  medicaid
  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner  of  health  is authorized to
  submit any state plan  amendment  or  seek
  other  federal  approval, including waiver
  authority, to implement the provisions  of
  the medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  that  meets  the  other criteria set forth
  herein; (3) reductions shall be made in  a
  manner  that  maximizes  federal financial
  participation, to the extent  practicable,
  including  any  federal  financial partic-
  ipation that is available or is reasonably
  expected  to  become  available,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, under the
  Affordable Care Act; (4) reductions  shall
  be  made  uniformly  among  categories  of
  services and  geographic  regions  of  the
  state,  to  the  extent  practicable,  and
  shall be made uniformly within a  category
  of  service,  to  the  extent practicable,
  except where the  commissioner  determines
  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for
  non-uniformity, including but not  limited
  to:  the  extent to which specific catego-
  ries of services contributed to department
  of health medicaid state funds spending in
  excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need to maintain safety  net  services  in
  underserved  communities; or the potential
  benefits of  pursuing  innovative  payment
  models contemplated by the Affordable Care
  Act,  in  which case such grounds shall be
  set forth in the  medicaid  savings  allo-
  cation  adjustment;  and  (5)  reductions
  shall be made in a manner  that  does  not
  unnecessarily  create  administrative
  burdens to medicaid applicants and recipi-
  ents or providers.
 The commissioner shall seek the input of the
  legislature,  as  well  as  organizations
  representing  health  care  providers,
  consumers,  businesses,  workers,  health
  insurers,  and others with relevant exper-

  tise, in developing such medicaid  savings
  allocation  adjustment, to the extent that
  all or part of  such  adjustment,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, is likely
  to have a material impact on  the  overall
  medicaid program, particular categories of
  service  or  particular geographic regions
  of the state.
 (a) The commissioner shall post the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  on  the
  department  of  health's website and shall
  provide written copies of such  adjustment
  to  the  chairs  of the senate finance and
  the assembly ways and means committees  at
  least  30  days  before  the date on which
  implementation is expected to begin.
 (b) The commissioner may revise the medicaid
  savings allocation  adjustment  subsequent
  to  the  provisions of notice and prior to
  implementation  but  need  provide  a  new
  notice  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i) of
  this paragraph only  if  the  commissioner
  determines, in his or her discretion, that
  such  revisions  materially  alter  the
  adjustment.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  the
  commissioner  need  not  seek  the  input
  described in paragraph (a) of this  subdi-
  vision or provide notice pursuant to para-
  graph  (b)  of this subdivision if, in the
  discretion of the commissioner,  expedited
  development  and implementation of a medi-
  caid  savings  allocation  adjustment  is
  necessary  due to a public health emergen-
  cy.
 For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  public
  health  emergency  is  defined  as:  (i) a
  disaster,  natural  or  otherwise,  that
  significantly increases the immediate need
  for  health  care  personnel in an area of
  the state; (ii) an event or condition that
  creates a widespread risk of exposure to a
  serious  communicable  disease,  or  the
  potential  for  such  widespread  risk  of
  exposure; or  (iii)  any  other  event  or
  condition  determined  by the commissioner
  to constitute an imminent threat to public
  health.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
  prevent  all  or  part  of  such  medicaid
  savings  allocation adjustment from taking

  ted by the federal  centers  for  medicare
  and medicaid services.
 In  accordance  with  the  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment, the commissioner of

  spending by the amount  of  the  projected
  overspending  through,  actions including,
  but not limited to modifying or suspending
  reimbursement methods, including  but  not
  limited  to  all  fees, premium levels and
  rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding  any
  provision  of  law  that  sets  a specific
  amount  or  methodology  for  any  such
  payments  or  rates  of payment; modifying
  medicaid  program  benefits;  seeking  all
  necessary  federal  approvals,  including,
  but not limited  to  waivers,  and  waiver
  amendments; and suspending time frames for

  provision  of  law,  rule or regulation to
  the contrary, including but not limited to

  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the
  laws of 1988, and 18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
 The  department  of  health  shall prepare a
  quarterly  report  that  sets  forth:  (a)
  known  and  projected department of health
  medicaid  expenditures  as  described  in
  subdivision 1 of this section, and factors
  that  could  result  in medicaid disburse-
  ments for the relevant state  fiscal  year
  to  exceed  the  projected  department  of
  health state funds  disbursements  in  the
  enacted  budget financial plan pursuant to
  subdivision 3 of section 23 of  the  state
  finance  law, including spending increases
  or decreases due  to:  enrollment  fluctu-
  ations, rate changes, utilization changes,
  MRT  investments,  and  shift of benefici-
  aries to managed care; and  variations  in
  offline  medicaid  payments;  and  (b) the
  actions taken to  implement  any  medicaid
  savings  allocation adjustment implemented
  pursuant to subdivision 4 of this section,
  including  information  concerning  the
  impact of such actions on each category of
  service  and each geographic region of the
  state. Each such quarterly report shall be

  tional costs of the New York state medical
  indemnity  fund, pursuant to chapter 59 of
  the laws  of  2011,  and  state  costs  or
  savings  from  the  essential  plan.  Such
  projections may be adjusted by the  direc-
  tor of the budget to account for increased
  or  expedited  department  of health state
  funds medicaid expenditures as a result of
  a  natural  or  other  type  of  disaster,
  including  a  governmental  declaration of
  emergency.
 The director of the budget, in  consultation
  with  the  commissioner  of  health, shall
  assess on  a  quarterly  basis  known  and
  projected medicaid expenditures by catego-
  ry of service and by geographic region, as
  determined  by the commissioner of health,
  incurred both prior to and  subsequent  to
  such  assessment for each such period, and
  if the director of the  budget  determines
  that  such  expenditures  are  expected to
  cause medicaid spending for such period to
  exceed the aggregate limit specified here-
  in for such  period,  the  state  medicaid
  director,  in consultation with the direc-
  tor of the budget and the commissioner  of
  health,  shall  develop a medicaid savings
  allocation adjustment to limit such spend-
  ing to the aggregate limit specified here-
  in for such period.
 Such medicaid savings allocation  adjustment
  shall  be designed, to reduce the expendi-
  tures  authorized  by  the  appropriations
  herein  in  compliance  with the following
  guidelines: (1) reductions shall  be  made
  in compliance with applicable federal law,
  including  the  provisions  of the Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law No. 111-148, and the Health  Care  and
  Education  Reconciliation  Act  of  2010,
  Public  Law  No.  111-152  (collectively
  "Affordable  Care Act") and any subsequent
  amendments thereto or regulations  promul-
  gated  thereunder; (2) reductions shall be
  made in a manner that  complies  with  the
  state medicaid plan approved by the feder-
  al  centers  for  medicare  and  medicaid
  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner  of  health  is authorized to
  submit any state plan  amendment  or  seek
  other  federal  approval, including waiver
  authority, to implement the provisions  of
  430  12550-02-3
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  STATE OPERATIONS  2023-24

  the medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  that  meets  the  other criteria set forth
  herein; (3) reductions shall be made in  a
  manner  that  maximizes  federal financial
  participation, to the extent  practicable,
  including  any  federal  financial partic-
  ipation that is available or is reasonably
  expected  to  become  available,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, under the
  Affordable Care Act; (4) reductions  shall
  be  made  uniformly  among  categories  of
  services and  geographic  regions  of  the
  state,  to  the  extent  practicable,  and
  shall be made uniformly within a  category
  of  service,  to  the  extent practicable,
  except where the  commissioner  determines
  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for
  non-uniformity, including but not  limited
  to:  the  extent to which specific catego-
  ries of services contributed to department
  of health medicaid state funds spending in
  excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need to maintain safety  net  services  in
  underserved  communities; or the potential
  benefits of  pursuing  innovative  payment
  models contemplated by the Affordable Care
  Act,  in  which case such grounds shall be
  set forth in the  medicaid  savings  allo-
  cation  adjustment;  and  (5)  reductions
  shall be made in a manner  that  does  not
  unnecessarily  create  administrative
  burdens to medicaid applicants and recipi-
  ents or providers.
 The commissioner shall seek the input of the
  legislature,  as  well  as  organizations
  representing  health  care  providers,
  consumers,  businesses,  workers,  health
  insurers,  and others with relevant exper-
  tise, in developing such medicaid  savings
  allocation  adjustment, to the extent that
  all or part of  such  adjustment,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, is likely
  to have a material impact on  the  overall
  medicaid program, particular categories of
  service  or  particular geographic regions
  of the state.
 (a) The commissioner shall post the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  on  the
  department  of  health's website and shall
  provide written copies of such  adjustment
  to  the  chairs  of the senate finance and
  the assembly ways and means committees  at
  431  12550-02-3
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

  STATE OPERATIONS  2023-24
 
  least  30  days  before  the date on which
  implementation is expected to begin.
 (b) The commissioner may revise the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment subsequent
  to the provisions of notice and  prior  to
  implementation  but  need  provide  a  new
  notice pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  of
  this  paragraph  only  if the commissioner
  determines, in his or her discretion, that
  such  revisions  materially  alter  the
  adjustment.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  the
  commissioner  need  not  seek  the  input
  described  in paragraph (a) of this subdi-
  vision or provide notice pursuant to para-
  graph (b) of this subdivision if,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, expedited
  development and implementation of a  medi-
  caid  savings  allocation  adjustment  is
  necessary due to a public health  emergen-
  cy.
 For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  public
  health emergency  is  defined  as:  (i)  a
  disaster,  natural  or  otherwise,  that
  significantly increases the immediate need
  for health care personnel in  an  area  of
  the state; (ii) an event or condition that
  creates a widespread risk of exposure to a
  serious  communicable  disease,  or  the
  potential  for  such  widespread  risk  of
  exposure;  or  (iii)  any  other  event or
  condition determined by  the  commissioner
  to constitute an imminent threat to public
  health.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
  prevent  all  or  part  of  such  medicaid
  savings allocation adjustment from  taking
  effect retroactively to the extent permit-
  ted  by  the  federal centers for medicare
  and medicaid services.
 In  accordance  with  the  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment, the commissioner of
  the  department  of  health  shall  reduce
  department of health state funds  medicaid
  spending  by  the  amount of the projected
  overspending through,  actions  including,
  but not limited to modifying or suspending
  reimbursement  methods,  including but not
  limited to all fees,  premium  levels  and
  rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding  any
  provision of  law  that  sets  a  specific

  amount  or  methodology  for  any  such
  payments or rates  of  payment;  modifying
  medicaid  program  benefits;  seeking  all
  necessary  federal  approvals,  including,
  but not limited  to  waivers,  and  waiver
  amendments; and suspending time frames for
  notice,  approval or certification of rate
  requirements,  notwithstanding  any
  provision  of  law,  rule or regulation to
  the contrary, including but not limited to
  sections  2807  and  3614  of  the  public
  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the
  laws of 1988, and 18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
 The  department  of  health  shall prepare a
  quarterly report that sets forth:(a) known
  and projected department of  health  medi-
  caid expenditures as described in subdivi-
  sion  1  of this section, and factors that
  could result in medicaid disbursements for
  the relevant state fiscal year  to  exceed
  the  projected  department of health state
  funds disbursements in the enacted  budget
  financial  plan  pursuant to subdivision 3
  of section 23 of the  state  finance  law,
  including  spending increases or decreases
  due  to:  enrollment  fluctuations,  rate
  changes,  utilization changes, MRT invest-
  ments,  and  shift  of  beneficiaries  to
  managed  care;  and  variations in offline
  medicaid payments;  and  (b)  the  actions
  taken  to  implement  any medicaid savings
  allocation plan  implemented  pursuant  to
  subdivision  4  of this section, including
  information concerning the impact of  such
  actions  on  each  category of service and
  each geographic region of the state.  Each
  such quarterly report shall be provided to
  the  chairs  of the senate finance and the
  assembly ways  and  means  committees  and
  shall  be  posted  on  the  department  of
  health's website in a timely manner.
