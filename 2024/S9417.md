 AN  ACT  to  amend  the local finance law and chapter 419 of the laws of

  providing  relief  to  local governments for certain mandated programs
  and services, in relation to local government borrowing practices  and

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph b of section 21.00 of the local finance  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  121  of  the  laws  of 2021, is amended to read as
 follows:
  b. Serial  bonds  shall  mature  in  annual  installments.  The  first
 installment  shall  mature not later than eighteen months after the date
 of such bonds or two years after the date of the first bond anticipation
 note or notes issued in anticipation of such  bonds,  whichever  is  the
 earlier,  provided,  however,  that  until  July fifteenth, two thousand
 [twenty-four] TWENTY-SEVEN, the first installment shall mature not later
 than two years after the date of such bonds or two years after the  date
 of  the  first bond anticipation note or notes issued in anticipation of
 such bonds, whichever is the  earlier.  However,  if  bond  anticipation
 notes are issued in anticipation of bonds and if a portion of such notes
 or  the  renewals  thereof  are  redeemed  from  a source other than the
 proceeds of such bonds within two years from the date of the first  such
 note  or  notes and a further portion thereof shall be so redeemed prior
 to the termination of each twelve months'  period  succeeding  the  date
 such  original  portion  was  so redeemed, the first installment of such
 bonds may, in the alternative, be made to mature  not  later  than  five
 years from the date of the first such note or notes.
  § 2. Paragraph b of section 53.00 of the local finance law, as amended
 by chapter 121 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  b.  If  such  bonds or notes are payable in installments, the install-
 ments remaining unpaid may be called for  redemption  only  (i)  in  the

 municipality, school district or district corporation at the time of the
 issuance thereof.  Whenever any bonds or notes are called for redemption
 prior  to  the  date  of their maturity, interest shall cease to be paid
 thereon after the date for redemption set forth in such call for redemp-
 tion. The sum to be paid to redeem any unpaid installment prior  to  its

 value, or (ii) the par value of such installment plus the total  of  all

 not been redeemed prior to maturity, except that bonds sold to the state
 of  New  York  municipal  bond bank agency, which are subject to call as
 hereinbefore authorized, may provide for the  payment  of  a  redemption
 premium  not  to exceed five per centum of the par value of the bonds to
 be called, payable on the date  of  the  redemption  thereof;  provided,
 however,  that  for  bonds  issued during the one-year period commencing
