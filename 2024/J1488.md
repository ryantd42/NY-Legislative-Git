within the Town of Taberg, New  York  under  the  direction  of  Alanson
White; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originally  formed  to  play  at  political  rallies  and
patriotic celebrations,  the  Camden  Continentals  Fife  &  Drum  Corps
adheres  to the mission statement to entertain the people of Central New
York, while promoting patriotism and a general sense of esprit de  corps
within the community; the Corps now appears in around 15 events per year
at parades and musters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sue  Waterman  joined  the Camden Continentals Fife & Drum
Corps in 1963 as a fifer, becoming the first female fifer in  the  Corps
history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dedicated to the mission of the oldest fife and drum corps
in New York State, Sue Waterman is a very active member and participates
in all fundraising activities for the Camden Continentals  Fife  &  Drum

individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments  to
preserve  American Heritage are brought to our attention, they should be
celebrated and recognized by all  the  citizens  of  this  great  Empire
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Sue Waterman for her 60 years of  dedication  and  participation
