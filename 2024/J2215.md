  HONORING  Frank  Munoff  upon  the occasion of his
  designation as recipient of the 2024  Warren  County
  Bar Association Liberty Bell Award
 
  WHEREAS, Within every community, there exist certain individuals who
have  played an important role in helping the people and families of New
York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative  Body  to  acknowledge
those  individuals,  in  Warren  County  and  New  York  State, who have
demonstrated great selflessness and care for their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Frank  Munoff  upon  the occasion of his designation as recipient of the
2024 Warren County Bar Association Liberty Bell Award; and
 
  WHEREAS, Frank Munoff, one of the original  founders  of  Adirondack
Operation  Santa Claus, was a middle school teacher in Hudson Falls, New
York, at the organization's inception  in  1974;  the  mission  was  the
creation  of  a  fund  for  financially disadvantaged local children and
their families, primarily during the Christmas holiday season; and
 
  WHEREAS, Challenging community sponsors to pledge donations over the
Thanksgiving  holiday,  Frank  Munoff  pledged  to  complete  a  50-mile
run/walk;  the  community's  financial  support  would  fund  the  first
Adirondack Operation Santa Claus Run  and  Walk  event;  this  dedicated
humanitarian  completed  the  challenge, running and walking continually
throughout the day and night; and
 
  WHEREAS, The modest proceeds in the Adirondack Operation Santa Claus
program's inaugural year were  just  the  beginning  of  the  successful
organization  it  is  presently; today, it serves the needs of more than
2,500 underprivileged students and their families in 30 school districts
within Warren, Washington, Saratoga, Essex, and Hamilton  counties;  the
most  recent  event collected more than $278,000 which provided food and
clothing for those who are less fortunate; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through his service to his community, Frank Munoff has made
a lasting, positive impact on  our  region  and  our  nation,  making  a
difference  in the lives of countless individuals; now President, he has
remained with  the  program  from  its  founding,  witnessing  the  50th
Anniversary of Adirondack Operation Santa Claus in 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Numerous volunteers, who have made this program the success
it is today, receive no monetary compensation for their tireless efforts
but  are  rewarded  by  the joy that comes from doing good work in their
community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Frank Munoff upon the occasion of his designation as recipient of
the 2024 Warren County Bar Association Liberty Bell  Award,  recognizing
 
his  contributions  as  a  dedicated  member of his community; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Frank Munoff.
