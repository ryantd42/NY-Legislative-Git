  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2024 as American Heart Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long- standing traditions, it is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2024, as American
Heart Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National American Heart Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Heart  Association  truly wants to help the
citizens of this great nation to live longer, healthier  lives  so  they
can  enjoy  all  of  life's  precious  moments;  American Heart Month, a
federally designated event, is a perfect  way  to  remind  Americans  to
focus  on their hearts and encourage them to get their families, friends
and communities involved; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year the  American  Heart  Association,  the  National
Heart,  Lung and Blood institute and other health-oriented organizations
celebrate American Heart Month to raise awareness of the seriousness  of
heart disease and to promote healthy lifestyles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States;
one in every four deaths is attributed to it, ahead of cancer, diabetes,
and Alzheimer's disease; one person dies every  37  seconds  from  heart
disease  (also  known  as  cardiovascular  disease),  and  one  in three
American adults (85  million  people)  live  with  some  form  of  heart
disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Research  states  that more than 350,000 people experience
cardiac arrest outside of a hospital each year and only about  1  in  10
survive;  more  than  23,000  children  under  the  age of 18 experience
cardiac arrest outside of a hospital each year in the United States  and
almost 40 percent of these are sports related; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  performance  of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
increases survival rates of cardiac arrests by two to three times,  only
46%  of  people  experiencing  this  health  emergency  receive  this
life-saving intervention practice while  awaiting  first-responders  and
emergency medical professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Heart Association and this Legislative Body
call upon the citizenry of this State and Nation to respond  to  cardiac
emergencies  more  effectively  by  calling 911 when someone is in need,
learning how to properly perform CPR, and utilizing  automated  external
defibrillators  (AEDs) when available to drastically decrease the number
of casualties related to cardiac arrest and heart disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Heart disease cost the  United  States  approximately  $219
billion  each  year  from 2014 to 2015; this includes the cost of health
care services and medicines, and this figure is growing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Coronary  Artery  Disease is the most common type of heart
disease, with two in 10 deaths resulting from heart  disease  in  people
under 65 years old; and
 
  WHEREAS, In New York, heart disease incidence is highest in Chenango
County, followed by Cattaraugus, Niagara, Orleans, Richmond, Montgomery,
and Chautauqua counties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Heart  disease  is  significantly  influenced  by  one's
environment, specifically by factors like  maternal  and  child  health,
access  to  educational  opportunities,  availability  of healthy foods,
physical  education,  extracurricular  activities  in  schools,  and
opportunities  for  physical  activity,  such  as  safe  and  walkable
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition,  it  is  vital  to  maintain  quality  working
conditions  and  worksite  health,  as well as availability of community
support and resources and access to affordable, quality health care; and
 
  WHEREAS, As reported by The National  Institutes  of  Health,  heart
disease  is  particularly  prevalent  among  the  African  American  and
Hispanic/Latino populations,  with  African  Americans  being  30%  more
likely  to  develop  heart  disease  than  non-Hispanic  whites; risk is
particularly high for African American women; and
 
  WHEREAS, Heart disease is preventable by targeting risk factors such
as smoking,  high  cholesterol  levels,  and  maintaining  normal  blood
pressure; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this health issue and more must be done  to  increase  activity  at  the
local,  state,  and  national  levels  to  promote screening and support
patients and their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2024, as American
Heart Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul Governor of the State  of  New
York.
