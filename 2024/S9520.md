 probable usefulness provided in paragraph [a.] A  of  section  11.00  of
 this  chapter,  to the extent to which the commissioner of education, or

 shall  estimate  based  upon facts existing on the date of such estimate
 that moneys receivable by the school  district  from  the  state  as  an

 existing on the date of such estimate, shall meet the  interest  on  and
 the  annual  requirements for the payment of such indebtedness. Any such
 estimate shall describe the indebtedness to which it relates.  An  esti-
 mate  shall  be  effective only until the June thirtieth next succeeding
 the date thereof.
