 of  age.  This program shall include, but not be limited to, support for
 enforcement of this article. AN ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, OR  THE  DEPARTMENT
 WHERE  NO  ENFORCEMENT OFFICER HAS BEEN DESIGNATED, SHALL CONDUCT RANDOM
 INSPECTIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OF EACH RETAIL DEALER LICENSED TO  SELL
 CIGARETTES,  TOBACCO  PRODUCTS,  OR  VAPOR  PRODUCTS AT ESTABLISHMENTS
 LOCATED WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH ENFORCEMENT OFFICER  OR  OFFICE,
 TO  DETERMINE  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE AND ANY
 OTHER LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE  SALE  OF  TOBACCO  AND

 minimum  of  [one]  TWO  thousand  dollars, but not to exceed [two] FIVE
 thousand [five hundred] dollars for each subsequent violation, unless  a
 different penalty is otherwise provided in this article. The enforcement
 officer  shall  advise  the  retail dealer that upon the accumulation of
 three or more points pursuant to this section the department of taxation
 and finance shall suspend the dealer's registration. If the  enforcement
 officer  determines  after  a  hearing  that a retail dealer was selling
 tobacco products while their registration was suspended  or  permanently
 revoked pursuant to subdivision three or four of this section, he or she
 shall  impose  a  civil  penalty  of  [twenty-five hundred] TEN THOUSAND
 dollars.
  3. (a) Imposition of points. If the  enforcement  officer  determines,

 a  prohibited  sale to a minor, he or she shall, in addition to imposing
 any other penalty required or permitted pursuant to this section, assign
 two points to the  retail  dealer's  record  where  the  individual  who
 committed  the violation did not hold a certificate of completion from a
 state certified tobacco sales training program and one point  where  the
 retail  dealer  demonstrates that the person who committed the violation
 held a certificate of completion from a state  certified  tobacco  sales
 training program.
  (b)  Revocation.  If the enforcement officer determines, after a hear-
 ing, that a retail dealer has violated this article four times within  a
 three year time frame he or she shall, in addition to imposing any other
 penalty  required  or permitted by this section, direct the commissioner
 of taxation and finance to revoke the  dealer's  registration  for  [one
 year] THREE YEARS.
  (c)  Duration  of  points. Points assigned to a retail dealer's record
 shall be assessed for a period of thirty-six  months  beginning  on  the
 first day of the month following the assignment of points.
  (d) Reinspection. Any retail dealer who is assigned points pursuant to
 paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision shall be reinspected at [least two
 times a] RANDOM ON A QUARTERLY BASIS EACH year by the enforcement  offi-
 cer until points assessed are removed from the retail dealer's record.
  (e)  Suspension. If the department determines that a retail dealer has
 accumulated three points  or  more,  the  department  shall  direct  the
 commissioner  of taxation and finance to suspend such dealer's registra-
 tion for one year. The three points serving as the basis for  a  suspen-
 sion shall be erased upon the completion of the one year penalty.
  (f)  Surcharge.  A  [two  hundred  fifty  dollar] FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
 surcharge to be assessed for every violation will be made  available  to
 enforcement  officers  and shall be used solely for compliance checks to
 be conducted to determine compliance with this section.
