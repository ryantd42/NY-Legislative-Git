  COMMEMORATING  the  50th Anniversary of the Beagle
  School of Saratoga Springs, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  those  institutions  of  commitment  and high achievement whose
purpose and endeavor have been dedicated to the pursuit of excellence in
the education of the youth of this noble Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th  Anniversary  of  the  Beagle  School  of  Saratoga
Springs, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Beagle School, established in 1972 as a pre-school, has
remained  unwavering  in  its  commitment  to  educating  young children
through the art of creative play for over five decades; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Beagle School is aptly named after  renowned  scientist
Charles  Darwin's  famous ship, The HMS Beagle, in which he famously set
out from Holland to discover the natural world; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than 50 years, the Beagle School's instructors and
volunteers have fostered a sense of wonder  and  curiosity  in  children
along with a lifetime love of learning; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since its inception, multiple generations of families have
come to the Beagle School to embark on their educational journeys; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, this vital early childhood institution  educates
approximately 100 students, aged two to five, during the school year and
another 100 students in its summer camp, culminating in the education of
thousands of students throughout its five decade history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Beagle  School  teaches  students  from  Saratoga and
beyond, some traveling as far  as  25  miles  to  come  to  this  highly
reputable  pre-school nestled in the historical neighborhood of Saratoga
Springs; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Beagle School's summer camp is fortunate to extend  its
radius  even  further as families from around the country visit Saratoga
for the summer and enroll their children  in  this  well-respected  camp
known for the fun, educational and safe experience; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  able  leadership  of  its  Director,  Jessica
Todtenhagen, the Beagle School imparts the importance  of  community  by
building  one  within the school, while also aiming to be a valuable and
contributing community member locally; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  school's  curriculum  includes  exploration  of  the
outdoors,  dramatic arts, math and language skills, as well as enriching
a  child's  education  with  life-skills,  self-help  skills  and
problem-solving skills in preparation for kindergarten and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  Beagle  School  teaches  students about
kindness and how being a kind friend can truly make a difference in this
world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Steeped  in  a proud and distinguished history, the Beagle
School may look back with pride upon its humble  beginnings,  find  just
satisfaction  in  its  purposeful growth and hold true of purpose in its
commitment to serving the educational needs of the citizens of  Saratoga
County and beyond; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th  Anniversary  of  the  Beagle  School,  noting  the
propriety  of  its  goals,  the  constancy  of  its  commitment, and the
significance of its accomplishments in preparing the youth of today  and
leaders of tomorrow; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Jessica Todtenhagen, Director of the Beagle School.
