 Introduced by M. of A. CONRAD -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Energy
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  public service law, in relation to enacting the
  "home utility weatherization jobs act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "home utility weatherization jobs act".
  § 2. Legislative  findings  and  intent.  The  legislature  finds  and
 declares that:
  (a)  The  Climate  Leadership  and  Community  Protection  Act (CLCPA)
 requires significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, including a
 40% reduction in statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and  an  85%
 reduction in statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050;
  (b)  The  Climate  Action  Council  Final Scoping Plan (Plan) deems it
 essential that buildings make significant investments  in  energy  effi-
 ciency, and the Plan's integration analysis demonstrates that widespread
 improvements  to  building  envelope  will reduce energy demand from the
 building sector by 30% to 50% by 2050;
  (c) Energy efficiency is and will continue to be a key  and  necessary
 component  of achieving the CLCPA's greenhouse gas emissions targets and
 has proven to be one of the most cost-effective strategies available;
  (d) Weatherization efforts that prioritize a  whole-building  approach
 to  reducing  energy  needs,  such as through building envelope enhance-
 ments, are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while  at
 the  same time facilitating further emissions reduction measures such as
 full electrification or hybrid heating systems by reducing heating load;
  (e) Improving the integrity of the building envelope through  upgrades
 or retrofits may result in deep energy savings;
  (f)  While existing energy efficiency programs administered by the New
 York state energy research and development authority are  available  for
 low-  to  moderate-income (LMI) customers, there are some gaps in cover-
 age, including LMI tenants who do  not  live  in  buildings  covered  by
 existing  LMI programs, individuals who do not qualify as LMI customers,

 rental properties, and where existing programs do not remove or mitigate
 up-front financial burdens for customers;
  (g)  Weatherization efforts can provide significant benefits to disad-
 vantaged and other communities through the reduction of energy usage and
 decreases in greenhouse gas emissions;
  (h) Weatherization and energy efficiency projects can  promote  strong
 economic  development and good jobs for local residents, including resi-
 dents in disadvantaged communities;
  (i) Utilities' access to capital and to a trusted  workforce  able  to
 effectively  execute  projects,  and experience with implementing energy
 efficiency programs specifically, positions them  well  to  develop  and
 implement programs to weatherize residential buildings; and
  (j)  It  is  therefore  the  intent of the legislature to remove legal
 barriers to utility development of weatherization programs  and  require
 the  public  service  commission  to  authorize utilities to immediately
 commence piloting the development and implementation of targeted utility
 weatherization programs to further the goals of the CLCPA.
  § 3. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 66-x to
 read as follows:
  § 66-X. ENERGY EFFICIENCY WEATHERIZATION IMPROVEMENTS. 1. AS  USED  IN
 THIS SECTION:
  (A) "BUILDING ENVELOPE" MEANS THE ASSEMBLIES, COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS
 OF  A  BUILDING THAT FORM THE THERMAL BARRIER BETWEEN THE INTERIOR SPACE
 OF THE BUILDING AND THE EXTERIOR ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT  LIMITED
 TO WALLS, FLOORS, ROOFING, FOUNDATION, WINDOWS AND DOORS;
  (B)  "WEATHERIZATION  IMPROVEMENT PROJECT" MEANS A PROJECT IMPLEMENTED
 BY A GAS CORPORATION, ELECTRIC CORPORATION OR COMBINATION GAS AND  ELEC-
 TRIC CORPORATION THAT IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF A BUILDING
 ENVELOPE,  INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOCATING AND SEALING AIR LEAKS,
 INCREASING INSULATION, AND WEATHERSTRIPPING WINDOWS AND DOORS; AND
  (C) "WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM" MEANS A PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY A GAS CORPO-
 RATION, ELECTRIC CORPORATION OR COMBINATION GAS AND ELECTRIC CORPORATION
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING WEATHERIZATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.
  2. THE COMMISSION SHALL INITIATE A PROCEEDING WITHIN THREE  MONTHS  OF
 THE  EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF WEATH-
 ERIZATION PROGRAMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING THE GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMIS-
 SIONS  AND  EQUITY  GOALS  OF  THE  CLIMATE  LEADERSHIP  AND  COMMUNITY
 PROTECTION ACT (CLCPA).
  3. WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION,  EACH  GAS
 CORPORATION,  ELECTRIC  CORPORATION,  OR  COMBINATION  GAS  AND ELECTRIC
 CORPORATION SHALL SUBMIT TO THE COMMISSION FOR  REVIEW  AND  APPROVAL  A
 PILOT WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM PLAN. THE WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM PLAN SHALL
 INCLUDE,  BUT  NOT  BE  LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: (A) THE BUILDINGS AND
 CUSTOMERS ELIGIBLE FOR THE  PROPOSED  PROGRAM,  WHICH  SHALL  INCLUDE  A
 DESCRIPTION  OF  HOW THE PROPOSED PROGRAM FILLS EXISTING GAPS RELATED TO
 LOW- TO MODERATE-INCOME (LMI) CUSTOMERS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS,  PRIORITIZ-
 ING  HOMES BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY AND LOCATED IN DISADVAN-
 TAGED COMMUNITIES AS IDENTIFIED BY THE CLIMATE  JUSTICE  WORKING  GROUP;
 (B)  A  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  WEATHERIZATION  IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS TO BE
 INCLUDED  IN  THE  PROPOSED  PROGRAM;  (C)  WHETHER  THE  WEATHERIZATION
 IMPROVEMENT  PROJECTS  WILL  BE  COMPLETED BY INTERNAL LABOR, CONTRACTED
