 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  JEAN-PIERRE -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Election Law
 
 AN ACT to amend the election law, in  relation  to  the  use  of  school
  buildings as polling sites
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 3 of section 4-104  of  the  election  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  694  of  the  laws  of 1989, is amended to read as
 follows:
  3. A building exempt from taxation shall be used whenever possible  as
 a  polling  place if it is situated in the same or a contiguous election
 district, and may contain as many distinctly separate polling places  as
 public  convenience  may require. The expense, if any, incidental to its
 use, shall be paid like the expense of other places of registration  and
 voting. If a board or body empowered to designate polling places chooses
 a  public  school  building  for such purpose, the board or agency which
 controls such building must make available  a  room  or  rooms  in  such
 building which are suitable for registration and voting and which are as
 close  as  possible  to  a convenient entrance to such building and must
 make available any such room or rooms which the board or body  designat-
 ing  such  building  determines  are  accessible  to physically disabled
 voters as provided in subdivision one-a AND SHALL PROVIDE A  SPACE  THAT
 IS  NOT  EASILY  ACCESSIBLE TO AREAS OF THE BUILDING WHERE INSTRUCTIONAL
 ACTIVITIES ARE TAKING PLACE, IF SUCH A SPACE  CANNOT  BE  PROVIDED  THAT
 MEETS  SUCH  CRITERIA,  THE BOARD OR AGENCY WHICH CONTROLS SUCH BUILDING
 SHALL CANCEL IN-PERSON INSTRUCTIONAL  ACTIVITIES  DURING  THE  OPERATING
 HOURS OF SUCH POLL SITE.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any general,
 special  or local law, if a board or body empowered to designate polling
 places chooses a publicly owned or leased building, other than a  public
 school building, for such purposes the board or body which controls such
 building  must make available a room or rooms in such building which are

 suitable for registration and voting and which are as close as  possible
 to  a  convenient entrance to such building, and must make available any
 such room or rooms which the board or  body  designating  such  building
 determines  are  accessible  to  physically  disabled voters unless, not
 later than thirty days after notice of  its  designation  as  a  polling
 place,  the  board  or  body  controlling such building, files a written
 request for a cancellation of such designation with the  board  or  body
 empowered  to designate polling places on such form as shall be provided
 by the board  or  body  making  such  designation.  The  board  or  body
 empowered  to  so designate shall, within twenty days after such request
 is filed, determine whether the use of such building as a polling  place
 would unreasonably interfere with the usual activities conducted in such
 building and upon such determination, may cancel such designation.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
