 AN ACT authorizing the Praise Tabernacle Church of God to receive retro-

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor of the city of Albany, county of Albany, is hereby author-
 ized to accept from Praise Tabernacle Church of God, also known as Alba-
 ny Church of God, a religious not-for-profit corporation, an application
 for exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of  the
 real  property  tax  law  with  respect  to  the  2014-2015,  2015-2016,
 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022,  2022-
 2023,  and  2023-2024  assessment rolls, for all of the school taxes and
 all of the general taxes of such rolls for  the  parcel  owned  by  such
 organization,  with  such  parcel  being  located in the city of Albany,
 county of Albany, at 453 Delaware  Avenue,  otherwise  known  as  Albany
 county  tax  map  district 75 section 68 block 2 lot 1. If accepted, the
 application shall be reviewed as if it had been received  on  or  before
 the taxable status dates established for such rolls.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate taxable status dates, the assessor, upon
 approval of the  common  council  of  the  city  of  Albany,  may  grant
 exemption  from  all  taxation  and  make appropriate corrections to the
 subject rolls. If such  exemption  is  granted  and  such  organization,
 therefor, shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the
 applicable governing body or tax department may, in its sole discretion,
 provide  for  the  refund  of  those  taxes paid and cancel those taxes,
 fines, penalties, liens, interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
