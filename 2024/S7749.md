 acknowledge, support and encourage the life-long health  and  well-being
 needs of persons who have been and will be adopted, DONOR-CONCEIVED, AND
 SURROGATE-BORN  in  this  state. The legislature further recognizes that
 the denial of access to accurate and complete medical and self-identify-
 ing data of any  adopted  person,  DONOR-CONCEIVED,  AND  SURROGATE-BORN
 PERSON, known and wilfully withheld by others, may result in such person
 succumbing  to  preventable  disease,  premature  death  or  otherwise
 unhealthy life, is a violation of that  person's  human  rights  and  is
 contrary  to  the  tenets of government. As such, the provisions of this
 section seek to establish  considerations  under  the  law  for  adopted
 DONOR-CONCEIVED, AND SURROGATE-BORN persons equal to such considerations
 permitted  by law to all non-adopted NON-DONOR CONCEIVED, AND NON-SURRO-
 GATE BORN persons; this section does so while providing for the  privacy
 of  an  adopted  DONOR-CONCEIVED,  AND SURROGATE-BORN person and [his or
 her] THEIR birth.
  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner or  a
 local  registrar or any person authorized by the commissioner or a local
 S. 7749  52
 
 registrar, upon application, proof of identity and payment of a  nominal
 fee,  shall  issue  certified copies of original long form line by line,
 vault copy birth certificates, including any  change  attached  to  that
 certificate  by  a birth parent or parents, and any information provided
 to the commissioner or a local registrar pursuant to subdivision one  of
 section  one  hundred  fourteen of the domestic relations law, to (i) an
 adopted DONOR-CONCEIVED OR SURROGATE-BORN person, if eighteen  years  of
 age  or  more,  or (ii) if the adopted DONOR-CONCEIVED OR SURROGATE-BORN
 person is deceased, the adopted person's  direct  line  descendants,  or
 (iii)  the  lawful  representatives  of  such  adopted person, or lawful
 representatives of such deceased adopted person's direct  line  descend-
 ants, as the case may be.
  §  31.  Items  (v)  and  (vii)  of  subparagraph (C) of paragraph 6 of
 subsection (k) of section 3221 of  the  insurance  law,  as  amended  by
