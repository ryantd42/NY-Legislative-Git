  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its

organizations in the world, with a mission to provide service to others,
promote  integrity, and advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace
through the fellowship of business, professional, and community leaders;
the non-political and non-religious organization has 46,000-plus  member
clubs that work together to promote peace, fight illiteracy and poverty,
help people get access to clean water and sanitation, fight disease, and

  WHEREAS,  Since  1949,  the Cazenovia Rotary Club has adhered to the
motto, "Service Above  Self";  over  the  past  decades,  the  club  has

community every two years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the  Cazenovia
Rotary  Club has been unable to produce a phone book since their 2018-19

phone book covers the towns of  Cazenovia,  Nelson,  and  parts  of  the
hamlet  of  Perryville,  containing both white and yellow pages; with no
charge to be added to the white pages, the 2018-19 white pages had 3,706
phone numbers, including listings for clubs,  local  organizations,  and
churches; and
 
  WHEREAS, 96 ads were sold for the 2018-19 phone book and those vital
businesses  of the surrounding Cazenovia community have all been invited
to advertise again in the upcoming  edition;  new  businesses  can  also
purchase ad space and there are also some ads provided for free; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  money  raised  through the phone books created by the
Cazenovia Rotary Club are donated to  support  local  organizations  and
initiatives,  as  well as used for the starting funds for the next phone
book publication; the club has  contributed  funds  to  support  Lamplit

to South Africa in shipping containers capable of being converted into a

all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
