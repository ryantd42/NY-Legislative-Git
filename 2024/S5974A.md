 AN  ACT to amend the general municipal law, in relation to the municipal
  sustainable energy loan program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  119-ee of the general municipal law, as added by
 chapter 497 of the laws of 2009, is amended to read as follows:
  § 119-ee. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature  finds
 and declares, AND AS REAFFIRMED IN THE NEW YORK STATE CLIMATE LEADERSHIP
 AND  COMMUNITY  PROTECTION  ACT,  that  it is the policy of the state to
 achieve statewide energy efficiency and renewable energy  goals,  reduce
 ECONOMY-WIDE  greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effect of global
 climate change, and advance a clean energy economy; and that to  achieve
 such policy and goals the state must promote the deployment of renewable
 energy systems [and], energy efficiency measures, WATER EFFICIENCY MEAS-
 URES, AND RESILIENCY IMPROVEMENTS throughout the state; THAT MEASURES TO
 ACHIEVE  REDUCTIONS  IN ENERGY USE, REDUCE EMISSIONS, AND SCALE DISTRIB-
 UTED SOLAR ENERGY AND BENEFICIAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT IN RESIDENTIAL AND
 COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, SPECIFICALLY  HAVE  BEEN  IDENTIFIED  AS  CRITICAL
 AREAS  FOR  INVESTMENT  TO  ACHIEVE THESE GOALS; and that municipalities
 would fulfill an important public purpose  by  [providing]  FACILITATING
 MARKET-BASED  FINANCING loans to property owners for the installation of
 renewable energy systems [and], energy efficiency measures, WATER  EFFI-
 CIENCY MEASURES, AND RESILIENCY IMPROVEMENTS.
  §  2. Section 119-ff of the general municipal law, as amended by chap-
 ter 184 of the laws of 2020, is amended to read as follows:
  § 119-ff. Definitions. For purposes of this article:

 No municipal corporation shall make such a loan to an owner of  property
 that  has received a loan from another municipal corporation pursuant to
 this article.
  3. Each such  local  law  establishing  the  sustainable  energy  loan
 program  shall  provide  for  the criteria for making such loans and the

  7.  No  such  loan  shall  be  made for energy efficiency improvements
 unless determined to be appropriate through an energy  audit,  [and]  no
 such  loan shall be made for a renewable energy system unless determined

 ES, OR ANY OTHER MUNICIPAL LIENS.
  9. The municipal corporation may  require  the  loan  made  under  the
 sustainable  energy  loan  program  to  be  repaid by the property owner
 through a charge on the real property  benefitted  by  such  loan.  Such
 charge  shall  be on the real property and shall be levied and collected
 at the same time and in the same manner  as  municipal  taxes,  provided
 that  such  charge  shall  be  separately  listed  on  the tax bill, and
 provided further that in the event such charge should not be paid  in  a
 timely manner, no other municipal corporation shall be required to cred-
 it or otherwise guarantee the amount of such unpaid charge to the munic-
 ipal  corporation  which  authorized  the  loan,  notwithstanding  any
 provision of law to the contrary. TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH CHARGE  IS  NOT
 PAID  WHEN  DUE,  THE DELINQUENT CHARGE MAY BE ENFORCED OR FORECLOSED TO
 S. 5974--A  6

 ENFORCE  AN UNPAID OR DELINQUENT CHARGE SHALL BE PAID FIRST TO OUTSTAND-
 ING REAL PROPERTY TAXES, MUNICIPAL CHARGES, OR OTHER MUNICIPAL LIENS.
  § 4. The New York state  energy  research  and  development  authority
 shall  publish revised guidelines for energy efficiency improvements and
 renewable energy systems in accordance with this act within 120 days  of
 the  effective  date of this act, and shall publish guidelines for water
 efficiency and resiliency improvements within 360 days of the  effective
 date  of this act. Such revised guidelines shall be effective as soon as
 adopted, however each sustainable energy loan program may process appli-
 cations received prior to the adoption date pursuant to existing  guide-
 lines  published  by  the authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
 sustainable energy loan program may  apply  the  revised  guidelines  to
 energy  efficiency  improvements,  renewable energy systems, water effi-
 ciency improvements, and resiliency improvements placed  in  service  on
 the  subject  real  property  within  three  years  of  the  date of the
 execution of a loan made under  the  sustainable  energy  loan  program.
 Prior to publishing guidelines, the authority shall conduct public meet-
 ings to provide opportunities for public comment.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
