 behalf of the plaintiff that notice of  such  mailing  and  refusal  was
 forthwith  sent  to the defendant by ordinary mail. Where the summons is
 mailed to a foreign country, other official proof of the delivery of the
 mail may be filed in case the post-office department is unable to obtain
 such a return receipt. The foregoing papers shall be filed within thirty
 days after the return receipt or other official proof of delivery or the
 original envelope bearing a notation of refusal, as the case may be,  is
 received  by  the  plaintiff.  Service of process shall be complete when
 such papers are filed. The return receipt or  other  official  proof  of
 delivery  shall  constitute presumptive evidence that the summons mailed
 was received by the defendant or  a  person  qualified  to  receive  his
 registered  mail;  and the notation of refusal shall constitute presump-
 tive evidence that the refusal  was  by  the  defendant  or  his  agent.
 Service  of  such  summons also may be made by mailing a copy thereof to
 the OFFICE OF THE secretary of state [at his office] in EITHER the  city
 of Albany OR NEW YORK, or by personally delivering a copy thereof to one
 of his regularly established offices, with a fee of five dollars, and by
 delivering a duplicate copy thereof, with the complaint annexed thereto,
 to  the  defendant personally without the state by a resident or citizen
 of the state of New York or a sheriff, under-sheriff, deputy-sheriff  or
 constable  of  the  county  or  other political subdivision in which the
 personal service is made, or an officer authorized by the laws  of  this
 state, to take acknowledgments of deeds to be recorded in this state, or
 an  attorney  and/or  counselor at law, solicitor, advocate or barrister
 duly qualified to practice in the state or country where such service is
 made, or by a United States marshal or  deputy  United  States  marshal.
 Proof  of  personal  service  without  the state shall be filed with the
 clerk of the court in which the action is  pending  within  thirty  days
 after  such service. Personal service without the state is complete when
 proof thereof is filed. The court in which the  action  is  pending  may
 order such extension as may be necessary to afford the defendant reason-
 able opportunity to defend the action.
  §  30. Subdivision 2 of section 253 of the vehicle and traffic law, as
 amended by chapter 166 of the laws  of  1991,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  2.  A  summons in an action described in this section may issue in any

 office] EITHER in the city of Albany  OR  NEW  YORK,  or  by  personally
 delivering  a  copy thereof to one of his regularly established offices,

 upon  such  non-resident provided that notice of such service and a copy
 of the summons and complaint are forthwith sent by or on behalf  of  the
 plaintiff  to  the  defendant  by certified mail or registered mail with
 return receipt requested. The plaintiff shall file with the clerk of the
 court  in  which  the action is pending, or with the judge or justice of
 such court in case there be no clerk, an affidavit of  compliance  here-
 with,  a  copy of the summons and complaint, and either a return receipt
 purporting to be signed by  the  defendant  or  a  person  qualified  to
 receive  his  certified  mail or registered mail, in accordance with the
 rules and customs of the post-office department; or, if  acceptance  was
 refused  by  the defendant or his agent, the original envelope bearing a
 notation by the postal authorities that  receipt  was  refused,  and  an
 affidavit  by  or on behalf of the plaintiff that notice of such mailing
 and refusal was forthwith sent to the defendant by ordinary mail; or, if
 the registered or certified letter  was  returned  to  the  post  office
 unclaimed,  the  original  envelope  bearing  a  notation  by the postal
 authorities of such mailing and return, an affidavit by or on behalf  of
 the  plaintiff  that  the  summons was posted again by ordinary mail and
 proof of mailing certificate of ordinary  mail.  Where  the  summons  is
 mailed to a foreign country, other official proof of the delivery of the
 mail may be filed in case the post-office department is unable to obtain
 such a return receipt. The foregoing papers shall be filed within thirty
 days after the return receipt or other official proof of delivery or the
 original  envelope bearing a notation of refusal, as the case may be, is
 received by the plaintiff. Service of process  shall  be  complete  when
 such  papers  are  filed.  The return receipt or other official proof of
 delivery shall constitute presumptive evidence that the  summons  mailed
 was  received  by  the  defendant  or  a person qualified to receive his
 certified mail or registered mail; and the  notation  of  refusal  shall
 constitute presumptive evidence that the refusal was by the defendant or
 his  agent.  Service of such summons also may be made by mailing a copy
 thereof to the OFFICE OF THE secretary  of  state  [at  his  office]  in
 EITHER  the  city  of  Albany OR NEW YORK, or by personally delivering a
 copy thereof to one of his regularly established offices, with a fee  of
 ten  dollars,  and  by  delivering  a  duplicate  copy  thereof with the
 complaint annexed thereto, to the defendant personally without the state
 by a resident or citizen of the state of New York or a  sheriff,  under-
 sheriff,  deputy-sheriff  or  constable of the county or other political
 subdivision in which the personal service is made, or an officer author-
 ized by the laws of this state, to take acknowledgements of deeds to  be
 recorded  in this state, or an attorney and/or counselor at law, solici-
 tor, advocate or barrister duly qualified to practice in  the  state  or
 country  where  such  service  is made, or by a United States [marshall]
 MARSHAL or deputy United States [marshall] MARSHAL.  Proof  of  personal
 service  without the state shall be filed with the clerk of the court in
 which the action is pending  within  thirty  days  after  such  service.
 Personal  service  without  the  state is complete when proof thereof is
 filed. The court in which the action is pending may  order  such  exten-
 sions as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity
 to defend the action.
  §  31.  This  act  shall  take effect on the one hundred eightieth day
 after it shall have become a law.
