  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 4, 2024, as Bring Your Parents to Work  Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness  of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 4, 2024, as Bring
Your Parents to Work Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2013,  LinkedIn,  the  career-focused  social network,
designated November 4th of each year as Bring Your Parents to  Work  Day
to  introduce  moms  and  dads  to what their daughters or sons do for a
living; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  a  study,  one  in  three  parents  do  not
understand  what their grown children do at work, and that is especially
true if their kids hold job titles that did not exist when  the  parents
were younger; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  Linkedin  research found that 35% of parents
are not familiar with their children's job responsibilities, 59% want to
know more about their child's career, and 50% believe they would benefit
from a better understanding of their child's job; and
 
  WHEREAS, A Business Insider article also speculated that the holiday
can lead to higher rates of retention; testimonials from  employees  who
have  participated  in  the  holiday have mentioned it has helped foster
better parental relationships and  provide  social  interaction  between
parents of coworkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since the inception of Bring Your Parents to Work Day more
than a decade ago, other companies have caught on; this  past  November,
organizations  including  HubSpot,  British Airways and the Virgin Group
asked workers to invite their parents to the workplace; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this time, some companies set up photo  booths,  put
out buffets, offered wine, and coordinated introductions between parents
and  staff;  others had department heads talk about their teams and what
work they do at the company and conduct Q&A sessions; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  and  events  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 4, 2024, as Bring
Your Parents to Work Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
