 tice of the profession of pharmacy  is  defined  as  the  administering,
 preparing,  compounding,  preserving,  or the dispensing of drugs, medi-
 cines and therapeutic devices on the basis  of  prescriptions  or  other
 legal authority, and collaborative drug therapy management in accordance

 cle.
  2. A licensed pharmacist may execute a  non-patient  specific  regimen
 prescribed  or  ordered  by  a physician licensed in this state or nurse
 practitioner certified in this state, pursuant to rules and  regulations
 promulgated  by the commissioner. When a licensed pharmacist administers
 an immunizing agent, he or she shall:
  (a) report such administration by electronic transmission or facsimile
 to the patient's attending primary health care practitioner  or  practi-
 tioners, if any, and, to the extent practicable, make himself or herself
 available  to  discuss  the  outcome of such immunization, including any
 adverse reactions, with the attending primary health care  practitioner,
 and  to the statewide immunization registry or the citywide immunization

 registry, as established pursuant to and  to  the  extent  permitted  by
 section twenty-one hundred sixty-eight of the public health law; and
  (b)  provide  information  to  the  patient  or, where applicable, the
 person legally responsible for the patient, on the importance of  having
 a  primary  health  care  practitioner, developed by the commissioner of
 health; and
  (c) report such administration, absent of any  individually  identifi-
 able  health  information,  to  the  department  of  health  in a manner
 required by the commissioner of health; and
  (d) prior to administering the immunization, inform  the  patient  or,
 where applicable, the person legally responsible for the patient, of the
 total  cost of the immunization or immunizations, subtracting any health
 insurance subsidization, if applicable. In the case the immunization  is
 not  covered,  the pharmacist must inform the patient or, where applica-
 ble, the person legally responsible for the patient, of the  possibility
 that the immunization may be covered when administered by a primary care
 physician or practitioner; and
  (e) administer the immunization or immunizations according to the most
 current recommendations by the advisory committee for immunization prac-
 tices  (ACIP),  provided  however,  that a pharmacist may administer any
 immunization authorized under this section when specified by  a  patient
 specific order.

 training satisfactory to the commissioner and the commissioner of health
 which shall include, but not be limited  to,  techniques  for  screening
 individuals  and  obtaining  informed  consent;  techniques  of adminis-
 tration; indications, precautions and contraindications in  the  use  of
 agent  or  agents;  record  keeping of immunization and information; and
 handling emergencies, including anaphylaxis and needlesticks.
  4. When administering an immunization  in  a  pharmacy,  the  licensed

 Immunization Schedule" published by the advisory committee for immuniza-
 tion practices (ACIP); and
  (b)  education  materials  on  influenza  vaccinations for children as
 determined by the commissioner and the commissioner of health.
  5. A licensed pharmacist may execute a non-patient specific order, for
 dispensing up to a seven day starter pack of HIV  post-exposure  prophy-
 laxis  medications  for the purpose of preventing human immunodeficiency
 virus infection, by a physician licensed in this state or nurse  practi-
 tioner  certified  in  this  state,  pursuant  to  rules and regulations
 promulgated by the commissioner in consultation with the commissioner of
 health following a potential human immunodeficiency virus exposure.
  6. A licensed pharmacist may execute a non-patient-specific regimen of
 insulin  and  related  supplies  to  an  individual  who  has  a  valid
 prescription  for  insulin  and related supplies which has since expired
 within the last twelve months. The valid  prescription  must  have  been
 prescribed  or  ordered  by  a physician licensed in this state or nurse
 practitioner certified in this state. Execution of a non-patient-specif-
 ic regimen shall be on an emergency basis provided the pharmacist:
  (a) first attempts to obtain an authorization from the  prescriber  of
 the  patient-specific  prescription and cannot obtain the authorization,
 and the prescriber does not object to dispensing to  the  patient  under
 the non-patient-specific regimen;

  (b)  provides  a  refill  of the patient-specific prescription and the
 quantity of that refill is in conformity with  the  directions  for  use
 under the patient-specific prescription, but limited to an amount not to
 exceed a thirty-day emergency supply; and
  (c)  notifies,  within  seventy-two  hours of dispensing the refill or
 refills, the  prescriber  of  the  patient-specific  prescription  whose
 authorization  could  not be obtained, that an emergency prescription of
 insulin has been dispensed.
  7. A licensed pharmacist is a qualified health care professional under
 section five hundred seventy-one  of  the  public  health  law  for  the
 purposes  of  directing  a  limited  service laboratory and ordering and
 administering COVID-19 and influenza tests authorized by  the  Food  and
 Drug Administration (FDA), subject to certificate of waiver requirements
 established  pursuant to the federal clinical laboratory improvement act
 of nineteen hundred eighty-eight.
  8. A licensed pharmacist within their lawful  scope  of  practice  may
 administer  injectable  medications into the deltoid muscle, pursuant to
 section six thousand eight hundred two of this article, for  the  treat-
 ment  of  mental  health  and  substance  use disorder, as prescribed or
 ordered by a licensed prescriber, acting within their scope of  practice
 in  this  state  and  in  accordance with regulations, including but not
