 AN ACT to amend the real property law, in relation to prohibiting  mort-
  gagees  from requiring mortgagors of certain real property to purchase
  flood insurance exceeding certain limits
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  real property law is amended by adding a new section
 283 to read as follows:
  § 283. LIMITS ON AMOUNT OF FLOOD INSURANCE REQUIRED BY MORTGAGEE.  NO
 MORTGAGEE  SHALL  REQUIRE  A  MORTGAGOR  TO  WHOM  THE  MORTGAGEE MAKES,
 INCREASES, EXTENDS, OR RENEWS ANY LOAN OR  LINE  OF  CREDIT  SECURED  BY
 IMPROVED  RESIDENTIAL  REAL PROPERTY TO PURCHASE OR PAY FOR FLOOD INSUR-
 ANCE ON SUCH RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY:  (1) AT A COVERAGE  AMOUNT  THAT
 EXCEEDS  THE  OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL MORTGAGE BALANCE AS OF THE BEGINNING
 OF THE YEAR FOR WHICH THE  POLICY  SHALL  BE  IN  EFFECT;  OR  (2)  THAT
 INCLUDES  COVERAGE  FOR  CONTENTS.  IN  EACH  INSTANCE WHERE A MORTGAGEE
 REQUIRES A MORTGAGOR TO PURCHASE OR PAY  FOR  FLOOD  INSURANCE  ON  SUCH
 RESIDENTIAL  REAL  PROPERTY,  THE  MORTGAGEE SHALL PROVIDE NOTICE TO THE
 MORTGAGOR AT THE TIME THE MORTGAGEE IS NOTIFIED OF THE NEED TO  PURCHASE
 OR  PAY  FOR  FLOOD  INSURANCE  THAT  STATES  THE FOLLOWING IN CLEAR AND
 CONSPICUOUS PRINT: 'PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FLOOD INSURANCE WE ARE  REQUIR-
 ING YOU TO PURCHASE WILL ONLY PROTECT YOUR CREDITOR OR LENDER'S INTEREST
 IN  YOUR  PROPERTY.  THE INSURANCE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR MANY
 NEEDED REPAIRS AFTER A FLOOD AND MAY NOT COMPENSATE YOU FOR YOUR  LOSSES
 IN  THE  PROPERTY  DUE TO THE FLOOD. IF YOU WISH TO PROTECT YOUR HOME OR
 INVESTMENT, YOU MAY WISH TO  PURCHASE  MORE  FLOOD  INSURANCE  THAN  THE
 AMOUNT WE ARE REQUIRING YOU TO BUY.'
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
