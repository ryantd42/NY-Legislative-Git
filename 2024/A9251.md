 tered  pharmacy  technician  has received appropriate training to ensure
 competence before he or she begins assisting a  licensed  pharmacist  in
 compounding,  preparing,  labeling,  ADMINISTERING  IMMUNIZATIONS  or
 dispensing of drugs, in accordance with this  article  and  article  one
 hundred  thirty-seven  of  this title. For the purposes of this article,
