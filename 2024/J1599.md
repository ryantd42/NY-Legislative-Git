  HONORING  Bartolo  Colon  upon the occasion of his
  retirement from Major League Baseball
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York honors individuals whose  exceptional
talents  and dedication significantly contribute to the state's cultural
and sports heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  acknowledge
those  individuals whose professional lives and civic endeavors serve to
enhance the stature of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Bartolo  Colon  upon  the  occasion  of his retirement from Major League
Baseball on Sunday, September 17, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bartolo  Colon,  a  distinguished  Major  League  Baseball
pitcher  and  proud  Dominican  immigrant,  has officially announced his
retirement, marking the end of a storied and impactful career; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on May 24,  1973,  in  Altamira,  Dominican  Republic,
Bartolo  Colon's  journey to Major League Baseball is a testament to his
perseverance, skill, and the dreams of countless immigrants  who  aspire
to achieve greatness in their chosen fields; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Known  affectionately as "Big Sexy" during his tenure with
the New York Mets from 2014 to 2016, Colon became a  beloved  figure  in
New  York,  both  for  his exceptional performances on the mound and his
charismatic presence, endearing him to fans across the state; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bartolo Colon's time  with  the  Mets  was  highlighted  by
memorable moments including a behind-the-back flip and hitting his first
Major  League home run at the age of 42, making him the oldest player to
achieve this feat, a moment that brought immense pride and  joy  to  New
Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With a record of 247 victories, Colon is celebrated as the
pitcher with the most wins by a Dominican player, a four-time  All-Star,
the  2005  American  League  Cy  Young  Award  winner,  and  a symbol of
excellence for the Dominican community in New York and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS, His transformation from a hard-throwing power pitcher to  a
finesse  pitcher  showcases  his  adaptability and deep understanding of
baseball, attributes that endeared him to his  teammates,  coaches,  and
the baseball community at large; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pauses in its deliberations to
honor Bartolo Colon upon the  occasion  of  his  retirement  from  Major
League  Baseball,  recognizing  his  outstanding  career,  significant
contributions to the state  of  New  York,  and  his  role  as  a  proud
Dominican  immigrant  who brought glory and excitement to the sport; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Bartolo Colon.
