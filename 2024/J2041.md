  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as Distracted Driving Awareness Month in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as  Distracted
Driving  Awareness  Month  in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of National Distracted Driving Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Distracted Driving Awareness Month in  April  is  a  united
effort to recognize the dangers of and eliminate preventable deaths from
distracted driving; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every day, at least nine Americans die and 100 are injured
in distracted driving  crashes;  cell  phones,  dashboard  touchscreens,
voice commands and other in-vehicle technologies pose a threat to public
safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Distracted  driving  includes  not  only  technological
distractions, but also eating, talking to passengers, smoking, adjusting
dashboard or other vehicle controls; and
 
  WHEREAS, The best way to end distracted driving is  to  educate  all
Americans  on  the  danger it poses; each and every death is 100 percent
preventable; just one second of your attention is all it takes to change
a life forever; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety
Administration  (NHTSA), in the United States in 2021, 3,522 people were
killed as a result  of  distracted  driving,  and  362,415  people  were
injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the  NHTSA, in 2021, eight percent of fatal
crashes,  14  percent  of  injury  crashes,  and  13  percent  of  all
police-reported  motor  vehicle  crashes  were  reported  as
distraction-affected crashes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration
estimated  that  crashes  caused  by  distracted  driving in 2019, had a
societal harm cost of $395 billion when factoring  in  quality  of  life
valuations in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness on
the dangers of distracted driving, and more must  be  done  to  increase
activity at the local, state and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as  Distracted
Driving Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
