  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 19-25, 2024, as Eosinophil Awareness Week in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help  increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  19-25, 2024, as
Eosinophil Awareness Week in the State of New York, in conjunction  with
National Eosinophil Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eosinophils are normal cellular components of the blood and
certain  tissues,  including  the  spleen,  lymph  nodes,  thymus,  and
submucosal areas of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary
tracts; disorders occur when eosinophils are found in  high  numbers  in
various parts of the body; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eosinophilia is the presence of too many eosinophils in the
body;  an  eosinophil  is  part  of  a group of cells called white blood
cells; the complete blood count (CBC) test is utilized to  indicate  the
presence  of  this  disorder  and often detects parasites, allergies, or
even cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, Blood eosinophilia occurs when the  eosinophil  levels  are
high in the blood and is found in blood testing, and tissue eosinophilia
is the result of high levels in inflamed tissues which may be discovered
through  a  biopsy  since  the eosinophil level may not always produce a
high count in a blood test; and
 
  WHEREAS, When the body is fighting a foreign substance, such  as  an
allergen,  eosinophils converge on the affected area and release toxins;
however,  an  overabundance  of  these  defenders  can  cause  chronic
inflammation and tissue damage; and
 
  WHEREAS, General categories of disease as a result of high levels of
eosinophils range from allergic disorders to endocrine disorders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2007,  the  American  Partnership  for  Eosinophilic
Disorders (APFED) drafted language to establish  a  National  Eosinophil
Awareness  Week  (NEAW);  on  May  15,  2007, the United States House of
Representatives passed House Bill No. 296, permanently  designating  the
third week of May as NEAW; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  objective  of  this  specific  week  is awareness and
education for both the general public and the medical community;  it  is
imperative  that  information,  understanding,  and  mindfulness  are
bolstered; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  19-25, 2024, as
Eosinophil Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
