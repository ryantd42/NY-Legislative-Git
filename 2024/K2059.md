  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 22-26, 2024, as Student Leadership Week in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York recognizes that  celebrating  student
leaders  is  a  powerful expression of gratitude and acknowledgement for
their unwavering dedication, passion, and drive in making  a  difference
within their school, community, State, and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 22-26, 2024, as
Student Leadership Week in the State of New York,  in  conjunction  with
the observance of National Student Leadership Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1972,  it  was  declared  nationally  that the 26th of
September would be National Student Government  Day;  in  1979,  it  was
renamed  National Student Leadership Day in order to include all student
leaders in student government, honors societies, clubs, and  much  more;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Student  Leadership  Day  was  extended  to be a
week-long celebration of student leaders across the country in 1983; and
 
  WHEREAS, Organizations such  as  National  Honor  Society,  National
Junior  Honor  Society,  National  Association  of Student Councils, and
National  Association  of  Secondary  School  Principals  sponsor  this
celebration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One-in-five  adults  in the Nation report that they took a
student leadership position while growing up, and 55 percent  of  adults
under  30 say they were encouraged to be leaders throughout their youth;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Benefits of being a student leader include developing  soft
skills,  networking,  and  advocating  for  issues one may be passionate
about; and
 
  WHEREAS, A 2017 survey states that 91 percent of  Americans  believe
that students are more successful in school when they can practice their
leadership  skills  outside the classroom in extracurricular activities;
creating opportunities for students  to  take  on  leadership  roles  is
vital, because it helps them gain experience and additional knowledge in
their respective field; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Student  leaders  in  institutions of higher education are
exposed  to  skills  like  hiring  a  team,  writing  legislation,
communications,  and  much more; communities in the State are encouraged
to show their student leaders that their efforts and impact  are  valued
by  celebrating  their accomplishments and elevating their stories; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 22-26, 2024, as
Student Leadership Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
