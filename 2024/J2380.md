  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  enduring  organizations  which  devote  their

Rockaway Parkway, in Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Resilient Young Minds is a nonprofit  organization  founded
by Juanita Tom, an emotion regulation coach specializing in working with
kids and teens, which aims to teach at-risk youth between the ages of 10
and  17,  as  well  as  their  parents and young adults, how to overcome
trauma with strength and resilience to reach their full potential; and

Young  Minds  introduces  the  youth  and adults to new environments and

Young  Minds, selects 10-30 at-risk youth who have experienced traumatic
experiences and offers the experience of a one-week sleepaway camp; this
camp  teaches  social-emotional  learning,  hosts  self-esteem  building

their goals; and

potential  of  its  youth  and positioning them for long-term success as
