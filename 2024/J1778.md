  HONORING  Firefighter  Robin  Johnson  upon  the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  55 years of dedicated service to the Oriskany
  Falls Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
Robin  Johnson  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition after 55 years of dedicated service to  the  Oriskany  Falls
Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Robin  Johnson  has  consistently  demonstrated a level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Oriskany Falls Fire Department proudly serves the Town
of Augusta, Village of Oriskany Falls, and its neighboring  communities;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighters  such as Robin Johnson unwaveringly serve our
great State with pride, valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers
are often the first to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is
a fire, transportation accident, natural  disaster,  act  of  terrorism,
medical crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Robin Johnson is such a firefighter;  throughout  55  years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Firefighter Robin Johnson upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition after 55 years of dedicated service to the  Oriskany
Falls Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter Robin Johnson.
