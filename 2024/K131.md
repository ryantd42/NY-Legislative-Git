  COMMEMORATING  the  200th Anniversary of the First
  Presbyterian Church in Lockport, New York
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social  and
educational  benefits  they confer, play a vital role in the development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the tradition of this State and this  Nation  to  pay
tribute  to  those  institutions and individuals who have contributed to
the ethical and spiritual values of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body takes pleasure in  commemorating  the
200th  Anniversary  of  the  First  Presbyterian Church in Lockport, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, In January of 1823, 30 men and women signed the charter  of
the  First  Presbyterian  Society  of  the  Villages of Lockport; Pastor
Aratus Kent was the first to lead the church,  and  through  the  years,
many more were to follow; currently, it is led by Reverend William James
Hardy who has served the congregation since 2009; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through the years, the Church has moved to three buildings
on two locations and gone through international wars and numerous  local
changes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition  to  being  a  sanctuary  for  all, the First
Presbyterian  Church  is  known  for  its  music,  peanut  brittle,
community-out-reach  programs,  reformed  worship  and its stained-glass
windows; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Tiffany glass windows were added throughout a period of
years, beginning with "They Came to the Master," in 1900, and concluding
with "Isiah" in 1953; and
 
  WHEREAS, Donated in 1950, the chancel window depicts Jesus with  his
right  hand  raised in the traditional gesture of a teacher; surrounding
him are scenes of the life, work, and recreation in and around Lockport;
designed by Stephen Palmer and a committee of church members, the images
including Fort Niagara (History), Main  Street  (Business),  Erie  Canal
(Waterways),  Farm  (Agriculture),  Factory  (Industry),  Niagara  Falls
(Nature), The Union School (Education),  a  local  house  (Home),  Court
House (Law), and a stagecoach (Transportation); and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  the  bottom  of the window is the log school where the
congregation was formed in 1823, and the words, "In Him all  things  are
held together."; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  First  Presbyterian Church stands on the threshold of
tomorrow, prepared to meet the challenges of the  coming  decades  while
retaining that spiritual resolve which characterizes its past; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the custom of this Legislative Body to take note of
enduring religious institutions and to bring such  institutions  to  the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 200th Anniversary  of  the  First  Presbyterian  Church,
fully  confident  that  this  commemoration reflects the belief in those
values which enhance the dignity and purpose of life; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  The  Reverend  William  James Hardy, First Presbyterian
Church in Lockport, New York.
