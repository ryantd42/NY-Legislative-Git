 AN ACT in relation to enacting the "New York Business  Emergency  Relief
  Act of 2023"

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York Business Emergency Relief Act of 2023".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent. The legislature recognizes that New York's
 businesses are instrumental to the state's economy and  to  the  state's
 recovery  from  the  COVID-19 pandemic. New York state's policies during
 the pandemic have already harmed  businesses  enough  and  the  interest
 assessment surcharge being levied on New York businesses at this time is
 an unnecessary and burdensome tax that New York state can end. It is the
 state's  obligation  to  remove this burden from New York businesses and
 pay its debts owed to the federal government for the  federal  unemploy-
 ment  insurance  trust  fund and not shift this obligation to businesses
 already struggling to recover from the pandemic.
  § 3. Funds. Notwithstanding any other law, rule and regulation to  the
 contrary,  the  governor  shall immediately direct all unallocated funds
 that are reserved in the "economic uncertainties" fund and  any  further
 settlement  money  that  may  be  received by the state or state surplus
 funds to small business relief purposes consistent with  the  intent  of
 repaying any outstanding debt owed to the federal unemployment insurance
 trust fund.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
