  WHEREAS, Saint Patrick's Day is a time for all to celebrate the rich
heritage of the Irish people, unlimited in their contributions  to  this
greatly diverse State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  Saint  Patrick's  Day  parade  reflects and records the
ongoing history of the  United  States  and  Ireland,  and  provides  an
opportunity  for  people  of all generations to assemble in ethnic pride
and pageantry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the Utica St. Patrick's Day  Parade
on Saturday, March 16, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  tradition  of  the  Utica St. Patrick's Day Parade is
steeped in 200 years of history, with John C. Devereux leading the first
march down the Historic Brewery and Arts District of Utica;  today,  the
Utica Parade draws around 30,000 spectators, as over 5,000 marchers from
across  the  state step off from Oneida Square and head north to Genesee
Street; this parade is notably the third  largest  parade  in  New  York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  annual  Passing  of  the Shillelagh to the 2024 grand
marshal will be held Saturday, March 9,  2024,  at  the  Irish  Cultural
Center of the Mohawk Valley located on Columbia Street in Utica; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  newly-named  grand marshal will help paint the iconic
green line down Genesee Street in Downtown  Utica,  marking  the  parade
route the day prior to the parade; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally, a Mass honoring St. Patrick, the patron saint
of  Ireland, will be held at 7:00 p.m. on Friday, March 15, 2024, at St.
Joseph St. Patrick Church on Columbia Street; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through this heartfelt  and  compassionate  expression,  as
well  as  through their sustained commitment to the cultural vitality of
their Irish heritage, the Irish-American people of the  Utica  area  and
the  State  of  New  York  bear  witness  to  the deep faith and love of
humanity which is their rich tradition; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 200th Anniversary of the Utica St. Patrick's Day Parade
on March 16, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
