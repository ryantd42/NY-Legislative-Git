  § 200.  Escheated lands.  All lands the title of which shall fail from
 a  defect  of  heirs,  shall  revert, or escheat, to the [people] INDIAN
 NATION OR TRIBE WHO HISTORICALLY OCCUPIED THE PROPERTY  OR  IF  NO  SUCH
 TRIBE OR NATION CURRENTLY EXISTS, TO THE NEAREST EXTANT INDIAN NATION OR
 TRIBE.  SUCH LAND SHALL BE TRIBAL LAND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE.
  §  2. Section 201 of the abandoned property law, as amended by chapter
 310 of the laws of 1962, is amended to read as follows:
  § 201. Action for recovery of property.  Whenever the attorney-general

 any real property has vested in [the people  of  the  state]  AN  INDIAN
 NATION  OR  TRIBE  by  escheat whether from defect of heirs, alienage or
 otherwise, [or by conviction or outlawry  for  treason  as  provided  in
 section eight hundred nineteen of the code of criminal procedure,] he OR
 SHE may commence an action to recover the property.
  §  3. Section 202 of the abandoned property law, as amended by chapter

  § 202.  Parties to action.  There may be made parties to such  action,
 all persons who would have, might have or might claim to have any inter-
 est  in or lien upon the premises so escheated or forfeited, at the time
 of such escheat or forfeiture, and all persons  in  possession  of  such
 real  property.  Where the names of the defendants are unknown, they may
 be designated as "unknown defendants."  The provisions of law applicable
 to actions to recover real property shall apply to such actions,  except
 that  service  of  the summons shall not be deemed to be complete until,
