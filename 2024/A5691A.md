 SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, OTHER  GOVERNING  BODY,  super-
 intendent  OF  SCHOOLS  OR DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS may accept
 all or any part thereof. [An appeal will lie from the  decision  of  the
 superintendent  to  the  board  of education who shall make its decision
 solely upon the record before it. The board may adopt  in  whole  or  in
 part  the decision of the superintendent of schools] THE BOARD OF EDUCA-
 TION OR TRUSTEES, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE CASE
 OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF  NEW  YORK,  OTHER  GOVERNING
 BODY,  SUPERINTENDENT  OF SCHOOLS, OR DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS
 SHALL ISSUE A WRITTEN DECISION TO THE SCHOOL AND  PARENT  OR  PERSON  IN
 PARENTAL  RELATION  TO THE STUDENT WITHIN THREE DAYS OF THE HEARING. THE
 WRITTEN DECISION SHALL STATE THE LENGTH OF SUSPENSION, IF ANY,  FINDINGS
 OF FACT, REASONS FOR DETERMINATION, LENGTH OF SUSPENSION, IF ANY, PROCE-
 DURES  FOR  APPEAL,  AND  THE  DATE  BY WHICH THE APPEAL SHALL BE FILED.
 Where the basis for  the  suspension  is,  in  whole  or  in  part,  the
 possession  on  school  grounds or school property by the student of any
 firearm, rifle, shotgun, dagger, dangerous knife, dirk, razor,  stiletto
 or  any  of the weapons, instruments or appliances specified in subdivi-
 sion one of section 265.01 of the penal  law,  the  hearing  officer  or
 superintendent shall not be barred from considering the admissibility of
 such  weapon,  instrument  or  appliance  as evidence, notwithstanding a
 determination by a court in a criminal or juvenile delinquency  proceed-
 ing  that  the  recovery of such weapon, instrument or appliance was the
 result of an unlawful search or seizure.
  [(2)] Where a [pupil] STUDENT has been suspended  in  accordance  with
 this  section  by  a board of education, the board may in its discretion
 hear and determine the proceeding or appoint a hearing officer who shall
 have the same powers and duties with respect to the board that a hearing
 officer has with respect to a superintendent where  the  suspension  was
 ordered by [him] THE SUPERINTENDENT. The findings and recommendations of
 the  hearing  officer  conducting  the  proceeding shall be advisory and
 subject to final action by the board of education, each member of  which
 shall  before  voting  review the testimony and acquaint [himself] THEM-
 SELVES with the evidence in the case. The board may reject,  confirm  or
 modify the conclusions of the hearing officer.
  [d.]  E.  (1)  Consistent  with  the federal gun-free schools act, any
 public school [pupil] STUDENT who is determined under  this  subdivision
 to  have  brought a firearm to or possessed a firearm at a public school
 shall be suspended for a period of not less than one calendar  year  and
 any  nonpublic  school  pupil  participating  in a program operated by a
 public school district using funds from  the  elementary  and  secondary
 education  act  of  nineteen  hundred sixty-five who is determined under
 this subdivision to have brought a firearm to or possessed a firearm  at
 a public school or other premises used by the school district to provide
 such  programs  shall  be  suspended  for  a period of not less than one
 calendar year from participation in such program. The procedures of this
 subdivision shall apply to such  a  suspension  of  a  nonpublic  school
 [pupil] STUDENT. A superintendent of schools, district superintendent of
 schools  or  community superintendent shall have the authority to modify
 this suspension requirement for each student on  a  case-by-case  basis.
 The  determination of a superintendent shall be subject to review by the
 board of education OR TRUSTEES, OTHER GOVERNING BODY, OR THE  CHANCELLOR
 OF  THE  CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE CASE OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT OF
 THE CITY OF NEW YORK, pursuant to paragraph [c] D  of  this  subdivision
 and the commissioner pursuant to section three hundred ten of this chap-
 ter.  Nothing  in  this  subdivision  shall  be  deemed to authorize the
 A. 5691  10
 
 suspension of a student with a disability in violation of  the  individ-
 uals  with  disabilities  education  act  or article eighty-nine of this
 chapter. A superintendent shall refer the [pupil] STUDENT under the  age
 of  sixteen  who has been determined to have brought a weapon or firearm
 to school in violation of this subdivision to a presentment agency for a
 juvenile delinquency proceeding consistent with  article  three  of  the
 family  court  act except a student fourteen or fifteen years of age who
 qualifies for juvenile offender status under  subdivision  forty-two  of
 section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law. A superintendent shall refer
 any  [pupil] STUDENT sixteen years of age or older or a student fourteen
 or fifteen years of age who qualifies for juvenile offender status under
 subdivision forty-two of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law, who
 has been determined to have brought a weapon or  firearm  to  school  in
 violation  of  this subdivision to the appropriate law enforcement offi-
 cials.
  (2) Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to mandate  such  action
 by  a  school district pursuant to subdivision one of this section where
 such weapon or firearm is possessed or brought to school with the  writ-
 ten authorization of such educational institution in a manner authorized
 by  article  two  hundred  sixty-five  of  the  penal law for activities
 approved and authorized by the trustees or board of education  or  other
 governing  body  of  the  public  school  and such governing body adopts
 appropriate safeguards to ensure student safety.

  (i) "firearm" shall mean a firearm  as  defined  in  subsection  a  of
 section  nine  hundred twenty-one of title eighteen of the United States
 Code; and
  (ii) "weapon" shall be as defined in paragraph 2 of  subsection  g  of
 section nine hundred thirty of title eighteen of the United States Code.
  [e.]  F.  Procedure after suspension. Where a [pupil] STUDENT has been
 suspended pursuant to this subdivision and said [pupil is of  compulsory
 attendance  age] STUDENT HAS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ATTEND SCHOOL, immediate
 steps shall be taken for [his or her] THEIR attendance upon  instruction
 elsewhere [or for supervision or detention of said pupil pursuant to the
 provisions  of  article seven of the family court act].  Where a [pupil]
 STUDENT has been suspended for cause, the suspension may be  revoked  by
 the  board  of education OR TRUSTEES, OTHER GOVERNING BODY, OR THE CHAN-
 CELLOR OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT  IN  THE  CASE  OF  THE  CITY  SCHOOL
 DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, whenever it appears to be for the best
 interest  of  the  school and the [pupil] STUDENT to do so. The board of
 education may OR TRUSTEES, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN
 THE CASE OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE CITY OF NEW YORK, OR  OTHER
 GOVERNING  BODY,  also  condition a student's early return to school and
 suspension revocation on the [pupil's] STUDENT'S voluntary participation
 in counseling or specialized  classes,  including  anger  management  or
 dispute resolution, where applicable.
  [f.]  G.  Whenever  the  term "board of education or superintendent of
 schools" is used in this subdivision, it  shall  be  deemed  to  include
 BOARD  OF  TRUSTEES,  OTHER  GOVERNING  BODY, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CITY
 SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE CASE OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE CITY  OF
 NEW  YORK,  community  boards of education and community superintendents

 cle fifty-two-A of this chapter.
  [g.] H. Discipline of students with disabilities and students presumed

 disability as such term is defined in section forty-four hundred one  of
 this  chapter and a student presumed to have a disability for discipline
 purposes, may be suspended or removed from [his or  her]  THEIR  current

 conferred  under applicable federal law and regulations, or to limit the
 ability of a school district to change the educational  placement  of  a
 student  with  a disability in accordance with the procedures in article
 eighty-nine of this chapter.
  (2) As used in this paragraph:
  [(1)] (I) a "student presumed to  have  a  disability  for  discipline

  (iii) the superintendent of  schools  of  a  school  district,  either
 directly or upon recommendation of a hearing officer designated pursuant
 to paragraph c of this subdivision, may order the placement of a student
 with  a  disability  into  an  interim  alternative educational setting,

 setting  for up to forty-five school days under the circumstances speci-
 fied in subsection (k)(1)(G) of  section  fourteen  hundred  fifteen  of
 title  twenty  of  the  United  States  code and the federal regulations
 implementing such statute or a longer period where authorized by federal
 law under the circumstances specified in subsection (k)(1)(C) of section
 fourteen hundred fifteen of title twenty of the United States  code  and
 the  federal  regulations implementing such statute, but in neither case

 the  same  manner  and  for  the same duration as a nondisabled student,
 except that such student shall  continue  to  receive  services  to  the

 TY-EIGHT HUNDRED ONE OF THIS CHAPTER.
  (viii)  nothing  in  this  section shall be construed to authorize the
 suspension or removal of a student with a disability from [his  or  her]
 THEIR  current  educational  placement  for  violation  of  school rules
 following a determination by a manifestation team that the behavior is a

  [3-a.]  I.  WHEN  A STUDENT IS SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL CONSISTENT WITH
 THIS SECTION AND SECTION TWENTY-EIGHT HUNDRED ONE OF THIS  CHAPTER,  THE
 PRINCIPAL,  OR  THE  PRINCIPAL'S  DESIGNEE,  IN  CONSULTATION  WITH  THE
 STUDENT'S TEACHERS, SHALL WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS CREATE  AN  EDUCATION
 PLAN  FOR  THE  STUDENT FOR EACH CLASS IN WHICH THE STUDENT IS ENROLLED,
 PROVIDED THAT IF SUCH TWENTY-FOUR HOUR PERIOD DOES NOT END ON  A  SCHOOL
 DAY,  IT  SHALL BE EXTENDED TO THE CORRESPONDING TIME ON THE NEXT SCHOOL
 DAY. THE EDUCATION PLAN SHALL MAKE PROVISIONS FOR A  STUDENT'S  ON-GOING
 ACADEMIC  INSTRUCTION  DURING THE SUSPENSION AND SHALL INCLUDE THE STEPS
 THE SCHOOL WILL TAKE TO PROVIDE THE STUDENT WITH A  SUCCESSFUL  RE-ENTRY
 TO  SCHOOL.  THE STUDENT SHALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN ALL ACADEMIC
 CREDIT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE TO EARN HAD  THE  STUDENT  BEEN  IN
 CLASS,  INCLUDING  THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE ANY MISSED ASSIGNMENTS OR
 TAKE ANY MISSED EXAMINATION OR ASSESSMENTS DURING THE STUDENT'S  SUSPEN-
 SION. IF AN EXAMINATION OR ASSESSMENT CANNOT BE RESCHEDULED, THE STUDENT
 SHALL  BE ALLOWED ON SCHOOL PROPERTY TO TAKE SUCH ASSESSMENT OR EXAMINA-
 TION ON THE DAY AND TIME THAT THE ASSESSMENT OR EXAMINATION IS GIVEN.
  3. Teacher removal of a [disruptive pupil] STUDENT.  In addition,  any
 teacher shall have the power and authority to remove a [disruptive pupil
 as  defined  in  subdivision  two-a  of this section,] STUDENT from such
 teacher's classroom consistent with discipline measures contained in the
 code of conduct adopted by the board pursuant  to  section  twenty-eight
 hundred  one  of  this  chapter. SUCH CLASSROOM REMOVAL SHALL NOT EXCEED
 ONE-HALF SCHOOL DAY ON THE SAME SCHOOL DAY. The  school  authorities  of
 any school district, BOARD OF COOPERATIVE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, OR CHAR-
 TER  SCHOOL  shall  establish  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure the
 provision  of  continued  educational  programming  and  activities  for
 students  removed  from  the classroom pursuant to this subdivision [and
 provided further that nothing]. WHEN  A  STUDENT  IS  REMOVED  FROM  THE
 CLASSROOM,  THE  STUDENT SHALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN ALL ACADEMIC
 CREDIT INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE ANY MISSED  ASSIGNMENTS  OR
 TAKE  ANY  MISSED  EXAMINATIONS  OR  ASSESSMENTS  DURING  THE  STUDENT'S
 REMOVAL. IF AN EXAMINATION OR  ASSESSMENT  CANNOT  BE  RESCHEDULED,  THE
 STUDENT  SHALL  BE ALLOWED ON SCHOOL PROPERTY TO TAKE SUCH ASSESSMENT OR
 EXAMINATION ON THE DAY AND TIME THAT THE ASSESSMENT  OR  EXAMINATION  IS
 GIVEN.  NOTHING  in  this  subdivision  shall authorize the removal of a
 [pupil] STUDENT in violation of any state or federal law or  regulation.
 No  [pupil]  STUDENT  shall  return to the classroom until the principal
 makes a final determination pursuant to paragraph c of this subdivision,
 or the period of removal expires, whichever is less.
  a. Such teacher shall inform the [pupil] STUDENT and the school  prin-
 cipal  of  the  reasons  for  the removal. If the teacher finds that the
 [pupil's] STUDENT'S continued presence in the classroom does not pose  a
 continuing danger to persons or property and does not present an ongoing
 threat  of  disruption to the academic process, the teacher shall, prior
 to removing the student from the classroom, provide the student with  an
 explanation  of  the basis for the removal and allow the [pupil] STUDENT
 to informally  present  the  [pupil's]  STUDENT'S  version  of  relevant
 events.  In  all  other  cases,  the  teacher  shall provide the [pupil]
 STUDENT with an explanation of the basis for the removal and an informal
 opportunity to be  heard  within  twenty-four  hours  of  the  [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S  removal,  provided  that if such twenty-four hour period does
 not end on a school day, it shall be extended to the corresponding  time
 on the next school day.
 A. 5691  14
 
  b.  The  principal  shall  inform  the  PARENT  OR  person in parental
 relation to such [pupil] STUDENT of the removal and the reasons therefor
 within twenty-four hours of the [pupil's]  STUDENT'S  removal,  provided
 that  if  such  twenty-four hour period does not end on a school day, it
 shall  be extended to the corresponding time on the next school day. The
 [pupil] STUDENT and the PARENT OR person  in  parental  relation  shall,
 upon  request,  be  given an opportunity for an informal conference with
 the principal to discuss the reasons for the  removal.  If  the  [pupil]
 STUDENT  denies  the charges, the principal shall provide an explanation
 of the basis for the removal and allow the [pupil] STUDENT and/or person
 in parental relation to the [pupil] STUDENT an  opportunity  to  present
 the [pupil's] STUDENT'S version of relevant events. Such informal [hear-
 ing]  CONFERENCE shall be held within forty-eight hours of the [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S removal, provided that if such forty-eight  hour  period  does
 not  end on a school day, it shall be extended to the corresponding time
 on the second school day next following the [pupil's] STUDENT'S removal.
 For purposes of this subdivision, "school day" shall mean a  school  day
 as  defined  pursuant to clause (v) of subparagraph three of paragraph g
 of subdivision three of this section.
  c. The principal shall not set aside the  discipline  imposed  by  the
 teacher  unless the principal finds that the charges against the [pupil]
 STUDENT are not supported by substantial evidence or that the  [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S  removal  is otherwise in violation of law or that the conduct
 warrants suspension from school pursuant to this section and  a  suspen-
 sion  will  be imposed.  The principal's determination made pursuant to
 this paragraph shall be made  by  the  close  of  business  on  the  day
 succeeding the forty-eight hour period for an informal hearing contained
 in paragraph b of this subdivision.
  d.  The  principal  may, in [his or her] THEIR discretion, designate a
 school district administrator, to carry out the  functions  required  of
 the principal under this subdivision.
  4.  Expense.  [a.]  The  expense attending the commitment and costs of
 maintenance of any [school delinquent] STUDENT PLACED AS A RESULT  OF  A
 FINDING  RELATED  TO  SCHOOL  OR  EDUCATIONAL  ISSUES  shall be a charge
 against the city or district where [he] THE  STUDENT  resides,  if  such
 city or district employs a superintendent of schools; otherwise it shall
 be a county charge.
  [b.  The  school  authorities may institute proceedings before a court
 having jurisdiction to determine the liability of a person  in  parental
 relation  to  contribute  towards the maintenance of a school delinquent
 under sixteen years of age ordered  to  attend  upon  instruction  under
 confinement.  If  the  court  shall find the person in parental relation
 able to contribute towards the maintenance of such a minor, it may issue
 an order fixing the amount to be paid weekly.]
  5. Involuntary transfers of [pupils] STUDENTS who have not been deter-
 mined to be a student with a disability or a student presumed to have  a
 disability for discipline purposes.
  a.  The board of education[, board of] OR trustees [or sole trustee,],
 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT  IN  THE  CASE  OF  THE  CITY
 SCHOOL DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, OTHER GOVERNING BODY, the superintendent of
 schools,  or  district  superintendent of schools may transfer a [pupil]
 STUDENT who has not been determined to be a student with a disability as
 defined in section forty-four hundred one of this chapter, or a  student
 presumed  to  have  a  disability  for discipline purposes as defined in
 paragraph [g] H of subdivision [three] TWO of this section from  regular
 classroom  instruction  to an appropriate educational setting in another
 A. 5691  15
 
 school upon the written  recommendation  of  the  school  principal  and
 following  independent  review  thereof. For purposes of this section of
 the law, "involuntary transfer" does not include a transfer  made  by  a
 school  district as part of a plan to reduce racial imbalance within the
 schools or as a change in school attendance zones or geographical bound-
 aries.
  b. A school principal may initiate a non-requested transfer  where  it
 is believed that such a [pupil] STUDENT would benefit from the transfer,
 or  when  the  [pupil] STUDENT would receive an adequate and appropriate
 education in another school program or facility.
  No recommendation for [pupil] STUDENT transfer shall be  initiated  by
 the  principal  until  such  [pupil]  STUDENT  and a PARENT OR person in
 parental relation has been sent written notification  of  the  consider-
 ation of transfer recommendation. Such notice shall set a time and place
 of  an  informal  conference  with  the  principal and shall inform such
 PARENT OR person in parental relation and such [pupil] STUDENT of  their
 right to be accompanied by counsel or an individual of their choice.
  c.  After  the  conference  and  if  the  principal concludes that the
 [pupil] STUDENT would benefit  from  a  transfer  or  that  the  [pupil]
 STUDENT  would  receive an adequate and appropriate education in another
 school program or facility, the principal may issue a recommendation  of
 transfer  to  the  superintendent.  Such  recommendation shall include a
 description of behavior and/or academic problems indicative of the  need
 for  transfer;  a  description of alternatives explored and prior action
 taken to resolve the problem. A copy of that letter shall be sent to the
 PARENT OR person in parental relation and to the [pupil] STUDENT.
  d. Upon receipt of the principal's recommendation for transfer  and  a
 determination  to consider that recommendation, the superintendent shall
 notify the PARENT OR person in parental relation and the [pupil] STUDENT
 of the proposed transfer and  of  their  right  to  a  fair  hearing  as
 provided  in  paragraph c of subdivision three of this section and shall
 list community agencies and  free  legal  assistance  which  may  be  of
 assistance.  The  written  notice  shall  include  a  statement that the
 [pupil] STUDENT or PARENT OR person in parental relation has ten days to
 request a hearing and that the proposed transfer shall not take  effect,
 except  upon  written  parental  consent,  until  the ten day period has
 elapsed, or, if a fair hearing is requested, until after a formal  deci-
 sion following the hearing is rendered, whichever is later.
  Parental  consent  to  a transfer shall not constitute a waiver of the
 right to a fair hearing.
  6. Transfer of a [pupil] STUDENT.  Where a suspended  [pupil]  STUDENT
 is  to  be transferred pursuant to subdivision five of this section, [he
 or she] THE STUDENT shall remain on the register of the original  school
 for  two school days following transmittal of [his or her] THEIR records
 to the school to which [he or she] THE STUDENT is to be transferred. The
 receiving school shall immediately upon receiving those  records  trans-
 mitted by the original school, review them to insure proper placement of
 the  [pupil]  STUDENT.  Staff members who are involved in the [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S education must be provided with pertinent records and informa-
 tion relating to the background and  problems  of  the  [pupil]  STUDENT
 before the [pupil] STUDENT is placed in a classroom.
  7.  Transfer  of  disciplinary  records.  Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision of law to the contrary, each local educational agency, as such
 term is defined in subsection thirty of section eighty-one  hundred  one
 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, shall
 establish  procedures  in  accordance  with  section eighty-five hundred
 A. 5691  16
 
 thirty-seven of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  1965,  as
 amended,  and  the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, to
 facilitate the transfer of disciplinary records relating to the  suspen-
 sion  or expulsion of a student to any public or nonpublic elementary or
 secondary school in which such student enrolls or seeks, intends  or  is
 instructed to enroll, on a full-time or part-time basis.
  § 5. Subparagraph 1 of paragraph c of subdivision 3 of section 3214 of
 the  education  law,  as  amended by chapter 380 of the laws of 2001, is
 amended to read as follows:

 ALLEGED INCIDENT SHALL BE PROVIDED TO THE STUDENT AND PARENT  OR  PERSON
 IN PARENTAL RELATION TO THE STUDENT. THE HEARING SHALL BE CONVENED WITH-
 IN  FIVE  DAYS  OF  THE  WRITTEN  NOTICE, UNLESS THE PARENT OR PERSON IN
 PARENTAL RELATION TO THE STUDENT OR STUDENT REQUESTS A  LATER  DATE.  AT
 THE HEARING, such [pupil] STUDENT shall have the right of representation

 ing  [officer] shall make WRITTEN findings of fact BASED ON A PREPONDER-
 ANCE OF THE EVIDENCE and SHALL MAKE recommendations as to the  appropri-
 ate measure of discipline [to the superintendent] IF ANY.  The report of

 OR TRUSTEES, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE  CASE  OF
 THE  CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, OTHER GOVERNING BODY,
 superintendent OF SCHOOLS OR  DISTRICT  SUPERINTENDENT  OF  SCHOOLS  may
 accept all or any part thereof. [An appeal will lie from the decision of

 under federal law and regulations, PROVIDED THAT THE SUSPENSION OF  SUCH
 STUDENT  IS  NOT  PROHIBITED BY SECTION TWENTY-EIGHT HUNDRED ONE OF THIS

 hundred fifteen of title twenty of the United States code and the feder-
 al regulations implementing such statute, with  the  general  procedures
 for student discipline under this section.

  a.  Such teacher shall inform the [pupil] STUDENT and the school prin-
 cipal of the reasons for the removal. If  the  teacher  finds  that  the
 [pupil's]  STUDENT'S continued presence in the classroom does not pose a
 continuing danger to persons or property and does not present an ongoing
 threat of disruption to the academic process, the teacher  shall,  prior
 to  removing the student from the classroom, provide the student with an
 explanation of the basis for the removal and allow the  [pupil]  STUDENT
 to  informally  present  the  [pupil's]  STUDENT'S  version  of relevant
 events. In all other  cases,  the  teacher  shall  provide  the  [pupil]
 STUDENT with an explanation of the basis for the removal and an informal
 opportunity  to  be  heard  within  twenty-four  hours  of the [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S removal.
  b. The principal  shall  inform  the  PARENT  OR  person  in  parental
 relation to such [pupil] STUDENT of the removal and the reasons therefor
 within twenty-four hours of the [pupil's] STUDENT'S removal. The [pupil]
 STUDENT  and  the  PARENT  OR  person  in  parental relation shall, upon
 request, be given an opportunity for an  informal  conference  with  the
 principal to discuss the reasons for the removal. If the [pupil] STUDENT
 denies  the  charges,  the principal shall provide an explanation of the
 basis for the removal and allow the [pupil]  STUDENT  and/or  PARENT  OR
 person  in  parental  relation  to the [pupil] STUDENT an opportunity to
 present  the  [pupil's]  STUDENT'S  version  of  relevant  events.  Such
 informal  [hearing] CONFERENCE shall be held within forty-eight hours of
 the [pupil's] STUDENT'S removal.
  c. The principal shall not set aside the  discipline  imposed  by  the
 teacher  unless the principal finds that the charges against the [pupil]
 STUDENT are not supported by substantial evidence or that the  [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S  removal  is otherwise in violation of law or that the conduct
 warrants suspension from school pursuant to this section and  a  suspen-
 sion  will  be imposed.  The principal's determination made pursuant to
 this paragraph shall be made  by  the  close  of  business  on  the  day
 succeeding the forty-eight hour period for an informal hearing contained
