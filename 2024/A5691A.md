 misconduct, the suspending authority shall provide an explanation of the
 basis  for the suspension. The pupil and the person in parental relation
 to the pupil shall, on request, be given an opportunity for an  informal
 conference  with  the  principal  at  which  the  pupil and/or person in
 parental relation shall be authorized to present the pupil's version  of
 the  event and to ask questions of the complaining witnesses. The afore-
 said notice and opportunity for an informal conference shall take  place

 counsel,  with the right to question witnesses against such pupil and to
 present witnesses and other evidence on his or  her  behalf.  Where  the
 pupil  is  a  student  with a disability or a student presumed to have a
 disability, the provisions of paragraph g of this subdivision shall also
 apply. Where a pupil has been suspended in accordance with this subpara-
 graph  by  a  superintendent  of  schools,  district  superintendent  of
 schools,  or  community  superintendent,  the  superintendent  shall
 personally hear and determine the proceeding  or  may,  in  his  or  her
 discretion,  designate  a  hearing  officer  to conduct the hearing. The
 hearing officer shall be authorized to administer  oaths  and  to  issue
 subpoenas  in  conjunction  with  the  proceeding before him or her.  A
 record of the hearing shall be maintained,  but  no  stenographic  tran-
 script  shall  be required and a tape recording shall be deemed a satis-

 dent  of schools.  Where the basis for the suspension is, in whole or in
 part, the possession on school grounds or school property by the student
 of  any  firearm,  rifle, shotgun, dagger, dangerous knife, dirk, razor,
 stiletto or any of the weapons, instruments or appliances  specified  in
 subdivision  one of section 265.01 of the penal law, the hearing officer
 or superintendent shall not be barred from considering the admissibility

 determination  by a court in a criminal or juvenile delinquency proceed-
 ing that the recovery of such weapon, instrument or  appliance  was  the
 result of an unlawful search or seizure.
  (2)  Where  a pupil has been suspended in accordance with this section
 by a board of education, the board may in its discretion hear and deter-
 mine the proceeding or appoint a hearing officer who shall have the same
 powers and duties with respect to the board that a hearing  officer  has
 with  respect  to  a  superintendent where the suspension was ordered by
 him. The findings and recommendations of the hearing officer  conducting
 the  proceeding  shall  be  advisory  and subject to final action by the
 board of education, each member of which shall before voting review  the
 testimony  and acquaint himself with the evidence in the case. The board
 may reject, confirm or modify the conclusions of the hearing officer.

 student  on  a case-by-case basis. The determination of a superintendent
 shall be subject to review by the board of education pursuant  to  para-
 graph  c  of  this  subdivision and the commissioner pursuant to section
 three hundred ten of this chapter. Nothing in this subdivision shall  be
 deemed  to  authorize  the  suspension of a student with a disability in

 eighty-nine  of  this  chapter.  A  superintendent shall refer the pupil
 under the age of sixteen who has been determined to have brought a weap-
 on or firearm to school in violation of this subdivision to  a  present-
 ment  agency for a juvenile delinquency proceeding consistent with arti-
 cle three of the family court act except a student fourteen  or  fifteen
 years  of  age who qualifies for juvenile offender status under subdivi-
 sion forty-two of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law.  A  super-
 intendent  shall  refer  any  pupil  sixteen  years of age or older or a

 offender status under subdivision forty-two of section 1.20 of the crim-
 inal  procedure law, who has been determined to have brought a weapon or
 firearm to school in violation of this subdivision  to  the  appropriate
 law enforcement officials.

 ten authorization of such educational institution in a manner authorized
 by  article  two  hundred  sixty-five  of  the  penal law for activities

 NOTHING in this subdivision shall authorize the  removal  of  a  [pupil]
 STUDENT  in  violation  of  any  state  or federal law or regulation. No
 [pupil] STUDENT shall return to the classroom until the principal  makes
 a  final determination pursuant to [paragraph c of] this subdivision, or
 the period of removal expires, whichever is less.
  a. Such teacher shall inform the [pupil] STUDENT and the school  prin-
 cipal  of  the  reasons  for  the removal. If the teacher finds that the
 [pupil's] STUDENT'S continued presence in the classroom does not pose  a
 continuing danger to persons or property and does not present an ongoing
 threat  of  disruption to the academic process, the teacher shall, prior
 to removing the student from the classroom, provide the student with  an
 explanation  of  the basis for the removal and allow the [pupil] STUDENT
 to informally  present  the  [pupil's]  STUDENT'S  version  of  relevant
 A. 5691--A  18
 
 events.  In  all  other  cases,  the  teacher  shall provide the [pupil]
 STUDENT with an explanation of the basis for the removal and an informal
 opportunity to be  heard  within  twenty-four  hours  of  the  [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S  removal,  provided  that if such twenty-four hour period does
 not end on a school day, it shall be extended to the corresponding  time
 on the next school day.
  b.  The  principal  shall  inform  the  PARENT  OR  person in parental
 relation to such [pupil] STUDENT of the removal and the reasons therefor
 within twenty-four hours of the [pupil's]  STUDENT'S  removal,  provided
 that  if  such  twenty-four hour period does not end on a school day, it
 shall be extended to the corresponding time on the next school day.  The
 [pupil]  STUDENT  and  the  PARENT OR person in parental relation shall,
 upon request, be given an opportunity for an  informal  conference  with
 the  principal  to  discuss  the reasons for the removal. If the [pupil]
 STUDENT denies the charges, the principal shall provide  an  explanation
 of the basis for the removal and allow the [pupil] STUDENT and/or person
 in  parental  relation  to the [pupil] STUDENT an opportunity to present
 the [pupil's] STUDENT'S version of relevant events. Such informal [hear-
 ing] CONFERENCE shall be held within forty-eight hours of the  [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S  removal,  provided  that if such forty-eight hour period does
 not end on a school day, it shall be extended to the corresponding  time
 on the second school day next following the [pupil's] STUDENT'S removal.
 For  purposes  of this subdivision, "school day" shall mean a school day
 as defined pursuant to [clause (v)  of]  subparagraph  [three]  FIVE  of
 paragraph [g] C of subdivision [three] SIX of this section.
  c.  The  principal  shall  not set aside the discipline imposed by the
 teacher unless the principal finds that the charges against the  [pupil]
 STUDENT  are not supported by substantial evidence or that the [pupil's]
 STUDENT'S removal is otherwise in violation of law or that  the  conduct
 warrants  suspension  from school pursuant to this section and a suspen-
 sion will be imposed.  The principal's determination  made  pursuant  to
 this  paragraph  shall  be  made  by  the  close  of business on the day
 succeeding the forty-eight hour period for an informal hearing contained
 in paragraph b of this subdivision.
  d. The principal may, in [his or her] THEIR  discretion,  designate  a
 school  district  administrator,  to carry out the functions required of
 the principal under this subdivision.

 of  maintenance of any [school delinquent] STUDENT PLACED AS A RESULT OF
 A FINDING RELATED TO SCHOOL OR EDUCATIONAL  ISSUES  shall  be  a  charge
 against  the  city  or  district where [he] THE STUDENT resides, if such
 city or district employs a superintendent of schools; otherwise it shall
 be a county charge.
  [b. The school authorities may institute proceedings  before  a  court
 having  jurisdiction  to determine the liability of a person in parental
 relation to contribute towards the maintenance of  a  school  delinquent
 under  sixteen  years  of  age  ordered to attend upon instruction under
 confinement. If the court shall find the  person  in  parental  relation
 able to contribute towards the maintenance of such a minor, it may issue
 an order fixing the amount to be paid weekly.

 presumed  to  have  a  disability  for discipline purposes as defined in
 [paragraph g of] subdivision [three] SIX of this  section  from  regular
 classroom  instruction  to an appropriate educational setting in another
 school upon the written  recommendation  of  the  school  principal  and
 following  independent  review  thereof. For purposes of this section of
 the law, "involuntary transfer" does not include a transfer  made  by  a
 school  district as part of a plan to reduce racial imbalance within the
 schools or as a change in school attendance zones or geographical bound-
 aries.
  b. A school principal may initiate a non-requested transfer  where  it
 is believed that such a [pupil] STUDENT would benefit from the transfer,
 or  when  the  [pupil] STUDENT would receive an adequate and appropriate
 education in another school program or facility.
  No recommendation for [pupil] STUDENT transfer shall be  initiated  by
 the  principal  until  such  [pupil]  STUDENT  and a PARENT OR person in
 parental relation has been sent written notification  of  the  consider-
 ation of transfer recommendation. Such notice shall set a time and place
 of  an  informal  conference  with  the  principal and shall inform such
 PARENT OR person in parental relation and such [pupil] STUDENT of  their
 right to be accompanied by counsel or an individual of their choice.
  c.  After  the  conference  and  if  the  principal concludes that the
 [pupil] STUDENT would benefit  from  a  transfer  or  that  the  [pupil]
 STUDENT  would  receive an adequate and appropriate education in another
 school program or facility, the principal may issue a recommendation  of
 transfer  to  the  superintendent.  Such  recommendation shall include a
 description of behavior and/or academic problems indicative of the  need
 for  transfer;  a  description of alternatives explored and prior action
 taken to resolve the problem. A copy of that letter shall be sent to the
 PARENT OR person in parental relation and to the [pupil] STUDENT.
  d. Upon receipt of the principal's recommendation for transfer  and  a
 determination  to consider that recommendation, the superintendent shall
 notify the PARENT OR person in parental relation and the [pupil] STUDENT
 of the proposed transfer and  of  their  right  to  a  fair  hearing  as
 provided in [paragraph c of] subdivision [three] TWO of this section and
 shall  list community agencies and free legal assistance which may be of
 assistance. The written  notice  shall  include  a  statement  that  the
 [pupil] STUDENT or PARENT OR person in parental relation has ten days to
 request  a hearing and that the proposed transfer shall not take effect,
 except upon written parental consent,  until  the  ten  day  period  has
 elapsed,  or, if a fair hearing is requested, until after a formal deci-
 sion following the hearing is rendered, whichever is later.
  E. Parental consent to a transfer shall not constitute a waiver of the
 right to a fair hearing.
  [6.] 11. Transfer of a [pupil] STUDENT.  Where  a  suspended  [pupil]
 STUDENT  is to be transferred pursuant to subdivision [five] TEN of this
 section, [he or she] THE STUDENT shall remain on  the  register  of  the
 original  school  for  two  school days following transmittal of [his or
 her] THEIR records to the school to which [he or she] THE STUDENT is  to
 be  transferred.  The  receiving school shall immediately upon receiving
 those records  transmitted  by  the  original  school,  review  them  to
 [insure]  ENSURE proper placement of the [pupil] STUDENT.  Staff members
 who are involved in the [pupil's] STUDENT'S education must  be  provided
 with  pertinent  records  and information relating to the background and
 A. 5691--A  20

 problems of the [pupil] STUDENT before the [pupil] STUDENT is placed  in
 a classroom.

 provision of law to the contrary, each local educational agency, as such
 term is defined in subsection thirty of section eighty-one  hundred  one
 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, shall
 establish  procedures  in  accordance  with  section eighty-five hundred
 thirty-seven of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  1965,  as
 amended,  and  the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, to
 facilitate the transfer of disciplinary records relating to the  suspen-
 sion  or expulsion of a student to any public or nonpublic elementary or
 secondary school in which such student enrolls or seeks, intends  or  is
 instructed to enroll, on a full-time or part-time basis.
