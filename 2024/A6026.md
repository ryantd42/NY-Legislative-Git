 respondent would not be criminally responsible by reason of age pursuant
 to section 30.00 of the penal law, then  the  family  court  shall  have
 exclusive  jurisdiction  over  such  proceeding.  Notwithstanding  a
 complainant's  election  to  proceed in family court, the criminal court
 shall not be divested of jurisdiction to hear a family offense  proceed-
 ing  pursuant  to this section. In any proceeding pursuant to this arti-
 cle, a court shall not deny an order of protection, or dismiss  a  peti-
 tion,  solely  on  the  basis  that  the  acts or events alleged are not
 relatively contemporaneous with the date of the petition, the conclusion
 of the fact-finding or the conclusion of the dispositional hearing.  For
 purposes  of  this  article,  "disorderly  conduct"  includes disorderly
 conduct not in a public place. For purposes of this article, "members of
 the same family or household" shall mean the following:
  (a) persons related by consanguinity or affinity;
  (b) persons legally married to one another;
  (c) persons formerly married to one another regardless of whether they
 still reside in the same household;
  (d) persons who have a child in  common  regardless  of  whether  such
 persons have been married or have lived together at any time; [and]
  (e)  persons  who are not related by consanguinity or affinity and who
 are or have been in an intimate relationship regardless of whether  such
 persons  have lived together at any time. Factors the court may consider
 in determining whether a  relationship  is  an  "intimate  relationship"
 include  but  are  not  limited  to: the nature or type of relationship,
 regardless of whether the relationship is sexual in nature; the frequen-
 cy of interaction between the persons; and the duration of the relation-
 ship. Neither a casual acquaintance nor ordinary fraternization  between
 two  individuals  in  business  or  social  contexts  shall be deemed to
 constitute an "intimate relationship"; AND
  (F) PERSONS WHO ARE RELATED BY CONSANGUINITY OR  AFFINITY  TO  PARTIES
 WHO ARE OR HAVE BEEN IN AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH
 (E) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 530.11 of the criminal procedure law, as
 amended  by  chapter  326  of the laws of 2008, the opening paragraph as
 amended by chapter 109 of the laws  of  2019,  is  amended  to  read  as

 second  degree,  aggravated  harassment  in  the  second  degree, sexual
 misconduct, forcible touching, sexual abuse in the third degree,  sexual
 abuse  in  the  second degree as set forth in subdivision one of section
 130.60 of the penal law, stalking in the first degree, stalking  in  the
 second  degree,  stalking  in  the  third degree, stalking in the fourth
 degree, criminal mischief, menacing in the second  degree,  menacing  in
 the  third  degree,  reckless  endangerment,  strangulation in the first
 degree, strangulation in the  second  degree,  criminal  obstruction  of
 breathing or blood circulation, assault in the second degree, assault in
 the  third  degree,  an  attempted  assault, identity theft in the first
 degree, identity theft in the second degree, identity theft in the third
 degree, grand larceny in the fourth degree, grand larceny in  the  third
 degree, coercion in the second degree or coercion in the third degree as
 set  forth  in  subdivisions one, two and three of section 135.60 of the
 penal law between spouses or former spouses, or between parent and child
