BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  HONORING Colleen Robinson upon the occasion of her
  designation for special recognition after five years
  of dedicated service to the Cazenovia Area Volunteer
  Ambulance Corps
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
give outstanding service to the people of the  Empire  State  and  whose
extraordinary  achievements  save  the  lives  of  their fellow citizens
should be recognized because their efforts so profoundly strengthen  our
shared commitment to family and community life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Colleen Robinson upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation  for  special
recognition  after five years of dedicated service to the Cazenovia Area
Volunteer Ambulance Corps which was celebrated at its  50th  Anniversary
Banquet at the Hampton Inn & Suites in Cazenovia, New York, on Saturday,
March 2, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  unity  of  our  State  and  Nation  is built upon the
compassion of those individuals within the State of New York who, in the
course of their jobs, perform acts of heroic dimension and who epitomize
the best of humanity; Colleen Robinson is one such individual; and
 
  WHEREAS, Volunteer ambulance corps members are an important part  of
the  safety  net of America's healthcare system; they provide lifesaving
care to those in need, 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Access to quality emergency care dramatically improves  the
survival  and  recovery  rate  of those who experience sudden illness or
injury; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 1974  and  currently  based  at  106  Nelson
Street,  Cazenovia  Area  Volunteer Ambulance Corps has been serving the
greater Cazenovia community, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and  365
days a year, for five decades; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital  ambulance  corps  would  not  exist  without
individuals such as Colleen  Robinson  who  sacrifice  time  spent  with
family  and friends to put in countless hours to help a neighbor in need
as well as those passing through; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by  an
individual  for  the  benefit  of  others  which  Colleen  Robinson  has
displayed throughout her life; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the performance of  her  duties,  Colleen  Robinson  has
demonstrated her character and her compassion for the welfare of others;
she  is  a tremendous asset to her Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Unit
and a distinguished citizen of the State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our unending  gratitude  and  respect  are  owed  to  these
devoted individuals whose responsibility is the preservation of life and
 
who  make that responsibility their own by serving their local ambulance
corps; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Colleen Robinson upon the occasion of her designation for  special
recognition  after five years of dedicated service to the Cazenovia Area
Volunteer Ambulance Corps; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Colleen Robinson.
