 PROVIDED THE HOLDER OF SUCH LICENSE IS  OTHERWISE  ELIGIBLE  TO  RECEIVE
 SUCH CONDITIONAL LICENSE. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PRESCRIBE BY REGULATION

 THE  COMPLETION  OF THE EDUCATIONAL DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. THE BURDEN OF
 PROVING EXTREME HARDSHIP SHALL BE ON THE LICENSEE WHO MAY PRESENT  MATE-
 RIAL  AND  RELEVANT  EVIDENCE.  A FINDING OF EXTREME HARDSHIP MAY NOT BE
 BASED SOLELY UPON THE TESTIMONY OF  THE  LICENSEE.  IN  NO  EVENT  SHALL
 ARRAIGNMENT  BE  ADJOURNED OR OTHERWISE DELAYED MORE THAN THREE BUSINESS
 DAYS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ALLOWING THE LICENSEE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE
 OF EXTREME HARDSHIP. THE COURT SHALL  SET  FORTH  UPON  THE  RECORD,  OR
 OTHERWISE  SET FORTH IN WRITING, THE FACTUAL BASIS FOR SUCH FINDING. THE
 HARDSHIP PRIVILEGE SHALL PERMIT THE OPERATION  OF  A  VEHICLE  ONLY  FOR
 TRAVEL  TO  OR  FROM  THE LICENSEE'S EMPLOYMENT, OR TO OR FROM NECESSARY
 MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR THE LICENSEE OR A MEMBER OF THE LICENSEE'S  HOUSE-
