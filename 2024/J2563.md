  COMMEMORATING the 50th Anniversary of F.X. Caprara
  Car Companies
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially  to  the  economic  vitality of their communities, thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of F.X. Caprara Car Companies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  F.X.  Caprara  Car  Companies'  namesake  was  Francis  X.
Caprara, a butcher in his family's grocery store in Bronx, New York; the
family  was  forced  to sell the store after a chain store moved nearby,
ending 23 years of operation; a  promising  and  successful  future  was
ahead for the people who valued relationships with customers, laying the
foundation for their business philosophy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1974, Francis X. Caprara purchased 90 acres of land in
Watertown, New  York,  and  founded  F.X.  Caprara  Car  Companies;  the
emphasis  on  personal  relationships,  customer  care,  and  community
involvement bolstered the company's growth and  expansion;  the  Caprara
business  philosophy  states  that  success  is  built on relationships,
customer satisfaction, and treating everyone equally; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  burgeoning  dealership  started  with  only  three
automobiles for sale in Pamelia, New York; today, under the ownership of
Charles  and  William  Caprara  and  their  children's  involvement  in
operation of the business, numerous dealerships, including  Kia,  Honda,
Chrysler,  Dodge,  Jeep,  Ram,  and  Ford  locations,  employ  180 staff
members; there are plans to open another location in Phoenix, New  York;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Exceptional  customer service provided by long-term, loyal
employees has significantly contributed to the success of  F.X.  Caprara
Car  Companies;  the  emphasis  on  community  and the well-being of the
employees has taken precedence to sales of vehicles and profit; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is with great pride that Charles  and  William  Caprara,
their  families,  and  the  staff  of  dedicated  workers celebrate this
milestone 50th Anniversary and anticipate many more years of success for
generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS, The progression of F.X. Caprara Car Companies is in  direct
correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its  owners  and  employees,  whose
involvement is, and always has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive
commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard of
excellence in all endeavors on behalf of the business and the  community
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business, its contributions to  the  local
 
and  State  economies,  and its vibrant role in improving the quality of
life in its community, fully confident that it will  continue  to  enjoy
the sparkling success it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of F.X. Caprara Car Companies;  and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to F.X. Caprara Car Companies.
