 AN  ACT  to  amend the public health law, in relation to designating the
  department of health as the lead agency in governing watersheds of the
  eleven Finger Lakes that serve as  a  source  of  drinking  water  for
  surrounding communities

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  top Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited
 as the "Finger Lakes watershed stewardship act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  It  is  the  intent of the legislature to
 protect and preserve the Finger  Lakes  region's  natural  heritage  and
 clean, cool waters for generations to come. The Finger Lakes is a unique
 area  of  our  state,  made up of 11 lakes and many communities that are
 home to its local tourism, wine, agricultural,  and  educational  insti-
 tutions.  These glacially carved lakes are especially sensitive to envi-
 ronmental pressures.  As  a  thriving  agriculture-tourism  region,  the
 Finger  Lakes  are  a  major  economic  engine for the state, generating
 millions of dollars every year in tax revenue  and  creating  more  than
 25,000  jobs annually.  Home to more than 1.2 million people, nearly 21%
 of the state's agricultural land, and holding upwards  of  4.2  trillion
 gallons of fresh water that serve more than 2 million residents stretch-
 ing  from  Rochester  to Syracuse, it is vital that we keep these waters
 clean and pristine long into the future.
  § 3. Section 1100 of the public health law is amended by adding a  new
 subdivision 6 to read as follows:
  6.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS NECESSARY TO
 GOVERN ALL WATERSHEDS OF THE ELEVEN FINGER LAKES THAT SERVE AS A  SOURCE
 OF  DRINKING WATER FOR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ACT
 AS LEAD AGENCY IN THE DEVELOPMENT, APPROVAL, IMPLEMENTATION, AND  UPDAT-
 ING OF SUCH RULES AND REGULATIONS, AND SHALL CONSULT WITH THE DEPARTMENT
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 OF  AGRICULTURE  AND  MARKETS, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVA-
 TION, AND ANY OTHER STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY OR GOVERNMENT  THE  DEPARTMENT
 SHALL  DEEM NECESSARY IN DEVELOPING, APPROVING, IMPLEMENTING, AND UPDAT-
 ING  SUCH  RULES  AND  REGULATIONS.  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF AGRICULTURE AND
 MARKETS, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL  CONSERVATION,  AND  ANY  OTHER
 STATE  AGENCY  SHALL  BE AUTHORIZED TO ENTER INTO MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT
 AND/OR PROMULGATE ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS TO GOVERN WATERSHEDS  OF  THE
 ELEVEN  FINGER  LAKES  THAT  SERVE  AS  A  SOURCE  OF DRINKING WATER FOR
 SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT INCONSISTENT  WITH  THE  RULES  AND
 REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
