  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow members of the New York State and Local  Employ-
 ees'  Retirement System employed as airport firefighters by the Division
 of Military and Naval Affairs to become covered by the provisions  of  a
 special  25-year  retirement  plan. This plan would provide a benefit of
 one-half of final average salary upon retirement for all  tiers  and  an
 additional benefit of one-sixtieth of final average salary for each year
 of service, including non-firefighter service, in excess of 25 years for
 Tiers 1 and 2 only.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $180,000 in the
 annual contributions of the State of New York for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost  will  vary  as  the  billing
 rates and salaries of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $1.98 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
  These estimated costs are based on 63 affected members employed by the
 Division of Military and Naval Affairs, with annual salary  of  approxi-
 mately  $5.0  million  as  of  March 31, 2022. The affected members were
 identified using job title codes provided by the Civil Service Employees
 Association.
