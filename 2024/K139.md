Confederacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wayne County's creeks, rivers, bays,  and  the  Great  Lake
Ontario were major factors in the first early settlers staying here; and

development,  leading  to a blossoming fruit belt, contributing to Wayne
County being the number one producer of apples in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  opening  of  the  Erie  Canal  led  to  expansion  of
communities  along  the  County's  banks and the development of industry
during the 19th Century, making Wayne County an  early  leader  in  many
commercial and agricultural endeavors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  waters and rich soil led to agricultural development,
commercial enterprises, and communities centered on rural living  across
the  varied  terrain  of drumlins, mucklands, creeks, and open bodies of
water; and
 
  WHEREAS, The population, now grown to over 90,000 people, supports a
wide array of  educational,  recreational,  commercial,  and  employment
opportunities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wayne County has had times of great economic prosperity and
great  economic  strife, but remains committed to its larger industries,
agriculture, and  tourism,  while  supporting  the  efforts  of  smaller
businesses,  not-for-profits,  and  other groups within its borders that
create a diverse network of employers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wayne County celebrates its Bicentennial year of 2023  with
many projects, events, and programs, providing numerous opportunities to
 
explore,  discover,  visit,  and  celebrate  the  wealth  of  historic,
cultural, and artistic opportunities throughout the County; and
 
  WHEREAS, This momentous occasion welcomes people to come together to
share  stories,  honor history, celebrate local heritage, and appreciate
this unique county, its 15 towns, seven villages, and countless hamlets;
this celebration is an opportunity to instill a sense of  community  and
county-wide  pride, develop a richer understanding of the County's past,
recognize the present, and envision the  future  of  the  beloved  Wayne
