 retirement and social security law.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow certain members of the New York State and  Local
 Employees'  Retirement System (NYSLERS) employed as correction officers,
 correction supervisors, deputy sheriff patrol, or deputy sheriff  patrol
 supervisors to receive an accidental disability benefit if the member is
 impaired  due to a condition of the heart as a result of an accident, in
 the performance of their duties, unless the contrary be proven by compe-
 tent evidence. For members in Tiers 1 and 2, the annual benefit would be
 3/4 of final average salary  (FAS)  less  workers'  compensation.  For
 members  in  Tiers  3-6  who are covered under the provisions of Article
 14-B of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL), the annual  bene-
 fit  would  be  2/3  of  FAS  less  workers' compensation. For all other
 affected members in Tiers 3-6, the annual benefit would be 1/3  of  FAS.
 The provisions of Section 25 of the RSSL will not apply.
  Insofar  as  this  bill  affects  the  NYSLERS, if this legislation is
 enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it would lead to more disa-
 bilities being classified as "accidental". The cost of the revised bene-
 fit will depend upon the applicant's age, service, salary, plan, and any
 benefit type otherwise payable.
  However, we  anticipate  that  few  additional  accidental  disability
 retirements  will be granted, and thus, the resulting costs are expected
 to be negligible.
  All costs arising from this bill would be shared by the State  of  New
 York and all the participating employers in the NYSLERS.
