 AN ACT in relation to requiring the commissioner of taxation and finance
  to  study  the  frequency  of residents who are being assessed library
  taxes for more than one library and to make recommendations to prevent
  the double taxation of residents; and providing for the repeal of such
  provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The commissioner of taxation and finance, in consultation
 with the commissioner of education,  public  libraries,  public  library
 systems,  and  association libraries, shall study the frequency of resi-
 dents who are being assessed library taxes  for  more  than  one  public
 library  or  association library, provided that such study shall exclude
 any public library or association library that is wholly contained with-
 in another public library or association  library  district,  and  shall
 make  recommendations  to address the double taxation of residents. Such
 study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
  (a) the estimated number of residents who are being  assessed  library
 taxes  for  more  than one public library or association library and the
 amount of money such residents are  paying  in  library  taxes  to  each
 public library and association library;
  (b)  the estimated economic impact on public libraries and association
 libraries that  would  result  from  prohibiting  residents  from  being
 assessed  library  taxes for more than one public library or association
 library; and
  (c) minimizing the economic impact on public libraries and association
 libraries of reduced revenue resulting from the prohibition of residents
 from being assessed library taxes for more than one  public  library  or
 association library.
