 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to requiring cardiopulmo-
  nary  resuscitation  instruction  as  a  part  of the health education
  curriculum in all senior high schools

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 804-c of the education law, as added by chapter 269
 of the laws of 1999, is amended to read as follows:
  §  804-c.  Cardiopulmonary  resuscitation instruction. 1. Instructions
 regarding cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  [may]  SHALL  be  offered  for
 voluntary  admission as a part of the health education curriculum in all
 senior high schools. In addition to the requirement that all teachers of
 health education shall be certified to teach health, persons instructing
 pupils in cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  shall  possess  valid  certif-
 ication  by  an agency offering such certification in the performance of
 cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in its instruction.
  2. The commissioner may prescribe regulations  governing  such  health
 education  courses  which  shall  include instruction in cardiopulmonary
 resuscitation. Such regulations shall in no event prescribe a course  of
 study  in  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation which sets forth standards for
 instruction of a lesser quality than the requirements  of  the  programs
 adopted by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross.
  3. School authorities [that choose to offer such course] shall provide
 the  needed  facilities,  time  and  place for the instruction set forth
 herein and shall provide learning aids and curriculum resource materials
 to support such course of study.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first of July  next  succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the
 addition,  amendment  and/or  repeal of any rule or regulation necessary
 for the implementation of this act on its effective date are  authorized
 to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
