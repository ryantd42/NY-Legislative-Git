BY: Senator SEPULVEDA
 
  CELEBRATING  March 26, 2023, as Bangladesh Day and
  commemorating the  birth  centenary  of  Bangabandhu
  Sheikh  Mujibur  Rahman,  the  founding  father  of
  Bangladesh, and the  Golden  Jubilee  of  Bangladesh
  independence
 
  WHEREAS,  March 26th is the national independence day of Bangladesh;
this day is celebrated in Bangladesh and also all around  the  world  in
honor  of its country's Declaration of Independence from Pakistan in the
late hours of March 25, 1971, and the start of the Bangladesh Liberation
War; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  day  also  commemorates  the  103rd  birthday  of
Bangabandhu  Sheikh  Mujibur  Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh,
and is a memorial to the deaths of  thousands  of  students,  civilians,
political leaders, and unarmed Bengali people; the Bangladesh Liberation
War started between West and East Pakistan; and
 
  WHEREAS,  West  Pakistan believed they were far superior to those in
East Pakistan; they gave East Pakistan no privileges;  they  had  a  bad
economy, and no rights; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first election in the history of Pakistan was held on
December 7, 1970; there were 300 seats in the parliament; East  Pakistan
won  160  seats  and West Pakistan won 81 seats; instead of handing over
the power to the  winning  party,  they  imposed  martial  law  on  East
Pakistan; and
 
  WHEREAS,  East  Pakistani  leader  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
urged the Bengali people to turn their homes into  resisting  forts;  he
said,  "Our  struggle  is  for  our  freedom.  Our  struggle  is for our
independence"; this speech is what mainly inspired the nation  to  fight
for freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  West  Pakistani  army  sent  a military plan known as
Operation Searchlight; it was planned to curb the Bengalis' movement  by
taking  control  of  major  cities,  and  eliminating  all  opposition,
political or military; and
 
  WHEREAS, At this point, March 26, 1971,  the  Bangladesh  Liberation
War  had  broken  out in the whole country; this was the day the Bengali
people stood up to the Pakistani Army; and
 
  WHEREAS, After a nine month long war,  the  Pakistani  army  finally
surrendered  unconditionally;  many lives were lost but Bangladesh, as a
country, gained its freedom, its independence; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
great  contributions  which the Bangladesh community have brought to our
State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many Bangladesh people have made New York their  home,  and
this Legislative Body, representing the people of the State of New York,
 
is  pleased  to  thank  the Bangladesh people for their contributions to
this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the custom of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown  a
long  and  sustained  commitment to excellence certainly have earned the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
celebrate  March  26,  2023, as Bangladesh Day and commemorate the 103rd
birthday of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the  founding  father  of
Bangladesh,  and the 52nd Anniversary of Bangladesh independence; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of  this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed  be
transmitted  to various Bangladesh organizations throughout the State of
New York.
