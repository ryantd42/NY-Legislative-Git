 often of significant concern to the affected community.

 through the use of existing community boards and their established abil-
 ity to effectively notify members of the community and to conduct public
 hearings on the proposal, the within provisions are enacted.

 209-ggg to read as follows:

 POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE  SHALL  NOT  SUBSTANTIALLY  ALTER  THE
 BOUNDARIES  OF  POLICE PRECINCTS, ONCE FIXED, OR CLOSE, REMOVE, OR RELO-
 CATE A POLICE STATIONHOUSE UNLESS AT LEAST  THIRTY  DAYS  PRIOR  TO  THE
 TAKING  EFFECT  OF  SUCH ACTION WRITTEN NOTICE THEREOF HAS BEEN GIVEN TO
 EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY BOARD OR BOARDS HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THAT  PART
 OF  THE  CITY  DIRECTLY  AFFECTED  BY  SUCH  PROPOSED  ACTION OR SERVICE
 REDUCTION.
