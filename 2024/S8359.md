 Introduced  by  Sen.  BROUK  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Mental Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to establishing a  state-
  wide youth mental health advisory board
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  poor mental health outcomes for youth is a public health
 crisis that poses a threat to the health, wellbeing, and quality of life
 for youth now and in the future. The legislature acknowledges  the  need
 for  youth  voice  and youth leadership in advocating for themselves and
 others regarding mental and behavioral needs. Amongst  the  shortage  of
 behavioral  and mental specialists, lack of representation within margi-
 nalized communities, and insufficient funding infrastructure and  oppor-
 tunities  for  appropriate school-based services, the legislature hereby
 finds the importance in establishing a dedicated board to support  youth
 in  their  mental and behavioral needs by increasing youth participation
 in state government. A dedicated  board  would  provide  advancement  in
 creating  policies  that aid in improving youth outcomes in an effort to
 address and resolve the youth mental health crisis in New York.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a new article 19-E to read
 as follows:
  ARTICLE 19-E
  NEW YORK YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH ADVISORY BOARD
 SECTION 461. NEW YORK YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH ADVISORY BOARD.
