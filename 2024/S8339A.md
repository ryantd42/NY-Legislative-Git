  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  The  family  court act is amended by adding a new section

  § 161-A. ACCESS TO FAMILY COURT PROCEEDINGS. 1. THE FAMILY COURT SHALL
 BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, INCLUDING THE NEWS  MEDIA,

 OTHER COMMON AREAS OF THE FAMILY COURT  OTHERWISE  OPEN  TO  INDIVIDUALS
 WITH BUSINESS BEFORE THE COURT.
  2. THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY PERSON SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM A COURTROOM
 ONLY  IF THE JUDGE PRESIDING IN SUCH COURTROOM DETERMINES, ON A CASE-BY-
 CASE  BASIS  THAT  SUCH  EXCLUSION  IS  WARRANTED.  IN  EXERCISING  THIS
 DISCRETION, SUCH JUDGE MAY CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE FOLLOWING:
  (A)  WHETHER SUCH PERSON IS CAUSING OR LIKELY TO CAUSE A DISRUPTION IN
 THE PROCEEDINGS;
  (B) WHETHER SUCH PERSON'S PRESENCE  IS  OBJECTED  TO  BY  ONE  OF  THE
 PARTIES BEFORE THE COURT;
  (C)  THE  ORDERLY  AND  SOUND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, INCLUDING THE
 NATURE OF SUCH PROCEEDING, THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF  INDIVIDUALS  BEFORE
 THE  COURT,  AND  THE  NEED  FOR PROTECTION OF LITIGANTS, IN PARTICULAR,
 CHILDREN, FROM HARM; AND
  (D) WHETHER LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO EXCLUSION ARE UNAVAILABLE
 OR INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CASE.
  3. WHERE A JUDGE EXERCISES THEIR DISCRETION IN EXCLUDING  ANY  PERSON,
 THE  GENERAL  PUBLIC,  OR  NEWS  MEDIA  FROM A PROCEEDING OR A PART OF A
 PROCEEDING IN FAMILY COURT, SUCH JUDGE  SHALL  MAKE  A  FINDING  ON  THE
 RECORD PRIOR TO ORDERING SUCH EXCLUSION.
  4.  WHEN  NECESSARY  TO  PRESERVE THE DECORUM OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, THE
 JUDGE SHALL INSTRUCT  REPRESENTATIVES  OF  THE  NEWS  MEDIA  AND  OTHERS
 REGARDING PERMISSIBLE USE OF SUCH COURTROOM AND OTHER FACILITIES OF SUCH
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
