  6. multi-jurisdictional account wagering providers shall pay a  market
 origin  fee  equal  to five percent on each wager accepted from New York
 residents. Multi-jurisdictional account wagering  providers  shall  make
 the  required  payments  to  the  market origin account on or before the
 fifth  business day of each month and such required payments shall cover
 payments due for the period of the preceding calendar  month;  provided,
 however, that such payments required to be made on April fifteenth shall
 be  accompanied  by  a  report under oath, showing the total of all such
 payments, together with such other information  as  the  commission  may
 require.  A  penalty  of  five  percent  and interest at the rate of one
 percent per month from the date the report is required to  be  filed  to
 the  date  the payment shall be payable in case any payments required by
 this subdivision are not paid when due.  If  the  commission  determines
 that  any moneys received under this subdivision were paid in error, the
 commission may cause the same to be refunded without interest out of any
 moneys collected thereunder, provided an application therefor  is  filed
 with  the commission within one year from the time the erroneous payment
 was made. The commission shall pay into the racing  regulation  account,
 under the joint custody of the comptroller and the commission, the total
 amount of the fee collected pursuant to this section[.]; AND
