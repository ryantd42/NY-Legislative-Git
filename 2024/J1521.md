  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 2024, as Pulmonary  Hypertension  Awareness
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  November  2024,  as
Pulmonary Hypertension Awareness Month in the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National  Pulmonary Hypertension
Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each November, the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA)
launches  a  national  campaign  to  raise  awareness  about  pulmonary
hypertension  (PH);  this  progressive  rare  disease is defined by high
blood pressure in the lungs and can cause right-heart failure and death;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Although it is  not  known  exactly  how  many  people  are
affected,  PH  is a contributing factor to more than 18,000 adult deaths
in the United States every year; it affects people of any age,  and  can
occur among those with left-heart disease, associated conditions such as
sleep  apnea,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  or
scleroderma, or from congenital heart disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  disease  is  significantly  underdiagnosed  and
misunderstood,  even  among  health  care providers; symptoms, including
shortness of  breath,  fatigue  and  chest  pain,  are  not  necessarily
specific  to PH and can lead to dangerous delays in a correct diagnosis;
and
 
  WHEREAS, While PH is incurable, early diagnosis and proper treatment
can extend and improve an individual's quality of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  November  2024,  as
Pulmonary Hypertension Awareness Month in the State of New York; and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
