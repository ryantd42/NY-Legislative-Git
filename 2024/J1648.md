BY: Senator PARKER
 
  RECOGNIZING  February 1, 2024, as National Freedom
  Day
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
important events which remind us of the rich and diverse heritage of our
great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize February 1, 2024, as National Freedom Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, February 1st has been designated as National Freedom Day in
the  United  States to celebrate and recognize the abolition of slavery;
this joyful celebration is held across New York  State  and  America  to
fittingly note the contributions of African Americans throughout history
and in all fields of endeavor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Freedom Day is a time to reflect on the struggles
and victories of African Americans throughout our country's history  and
to  recognize their numerous valuable contributions to the protection of
our democratic society in times of war and in peace; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to freedom from slavery, National  Freedom  Day
recognizes  America  as a true symbol for freedom; it honors the signing
of a joint House and Senate Resolution by Abraham  Lincoln  which  later
became the 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution; and
 
  WHEREAS,  President  Abraham  Lincoln signed the Amendment outlawing
slavery on February 1, 1865, however, it was not ratified by the  states
until December 18, 1865; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  former  slave  and great leader in the community by the
name of Major Richard Robert Wright, Sr. created National  Freedom  Day;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  June  30,  1948,  President Harry Truman signed a bill
proclaiming February 1st as the first official National Freedom  Day  in
the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  this  day  throughout our great State and Nation, many
towns have festivals and celebrations, reflecting on  the  freedoms  the
United  States  honors,  as  well  as reflecting on and appreciating the
goodwill of the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Events which celebrate diversity and  peace  contribute  to
fulfilling  our  Nation's  great  legacy of equality and opportunity for
all, and do so profoundly enhance our shared commitment to  freedom  and
justice; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize February 1, 2024, as National Freedom Day.
