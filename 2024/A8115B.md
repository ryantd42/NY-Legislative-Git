 twenty-eight  of the public health law, or a pharmacy owned and operated
 by such a facility,] under the direct personal supervision of a licensed
 pharmacist employed in such a [facility or]  pharmacy.  Such  [facility]

 technician has received appropriate training to ensure competence before
 he or she begins assisting a licensed pharmacist in compounding, prepar-
 ing, labeling, or dispensing of drugs, in accordance with  this  article
 and  article one hundred thirty-seven of this title. For the purposes of
 this article, direct personal supervision means  supervision  of  proce-
 dures  based  on  instructions  given directly by a supervising licensed

 being  performed, authorizes the procedures and evaluates the procedures
