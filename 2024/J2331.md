  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April  2024,  as  Co-Occurring  Disorders  Awareness
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health  issues  that  affect  the  lives of families in the State of New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  2024,  as
Co-Occurring Disorders Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  A  co-occurring disorder, also known as dual diagnosis, is
the condition of having a mental illness and a  comorbid  substance  use
disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration's  2022  National  Survey  on  Drug  Use  and  Health,
approximately 21,500,000 adults in the United States have a co-occurring
disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS, People with mental illness are more likely to experience  a
substance use disorder than those not affected by a mental illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  No  specific  combinations  of  mental  and  substance use
disorders are defined uniquely as co-occurring disorders; and
 
  WHEREAS, The presence  of  two  or  more  disorders  can  complicate
diagnosis and treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Integrating  both  screening  and treatment for mental and
substance use disorders leads to a better quality  of  care  and  health
outcomes  for  those  living with co-occurring disorders by treating the
whole person; and
 
  WHEREAS, Increased awareness leads  to  earlier  detection  and  can
ultimately save lives as timing is critical; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Early  detection  and  integrated  treatment  can together
improve outcomes and  quality  of  life  for  people  with  co-occurring
disorders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State, and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  2024,  as
Co-Occurring  Disorders Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
