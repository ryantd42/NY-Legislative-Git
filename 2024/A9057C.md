 AN  ACT to amend the banking law, in relation to mandating acceptance of
  the New York city identity card as a primary form of identification at
  all covered entities
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "pro-bank-
 ing act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds  and  declares
 that:
  (a) Local law no. 35 for the year 2014 amended subchapter 1 of chapter
 1  of  title  3  of  the  administrative code of the city of New York by
 adding a section  3-115,  creating  the  New  York  city  identity  card
 program.  One of the main objectives of the program was to expand access
 to bank-approved identification cards, thereby reducing  the  number  of
 unbanked residents across the city. In 2015, federal regulatory authori-
 ties  notified  the city agencies in charge of administering the program
 that banks could use the New York city  identity  card  to  satisfy  the
 minimum requirements of federal anti-money laundering laws. In 2016, the
 New  York  State  Department of Financial Services further "encourage[d]
 New York state-chartered and licensed financial institutions  to  accept
 the Municipal ID as a form of acceptable identification card."
  (b) Despite authorization by federal and state regulatory authorities,
 only  approximately  one-third  of  city  banks accept the New York city
 identity card, leaving many city residents on the margins of the  finan-

 cial system. As of 2017, 11.2 percent of households in New York city had
 no bank account and ten neighborhoods accounted for nearly 35 percent of
 those  households. Residents of color, undocumented residents, and resi-
 dents  living below the poverty line are disproportionately impacted and
 are at greater risk of falling victim to predatory  financial  services,
 imperiling  their  financial futures and aggravating economic inequality
 across the state.
  (c) The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that our most vulner-
 able residents are  not  cut  off  from  traditional  banking  services.
 Mandating  acceptance  of the New York city identity card at state-char-
 tered financial institutions will allow all  residents  to  build  their
 financial  futures  and advance the state's goal of facilitating broader
 financial inclusion.
  § 3. The banking law is amended by adding a new section 13 to read  as
 follows:
  §  13.  ACCEPTANCE  OF NEW YORK CITY IDENTITY CARD. 1. DEFINITIONS. AS
 USED IN THIS SECTION:
  (A) "NEW YORK CITY IDENTITY CARD" REFERS TO THE IDENTITY  CARD  ISSUED
 BY  THE  CITY  OF NEW YORK PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION C OF SECTION 3-115 OF
 THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
  (B) "COVERED ENTITY" MEANS ALL BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, FOREIGN  BANKING
 CORPORATIONS  LICENSED  BY  THE  SUPERINTENDENT, AND INTERSTATE BRANCHES
 ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE FIVE-C OF THIS CHAPTER.
  2. COVERED ENTITIES SHALL ACCEPT THE NEW YORK CITY IDENTITY CARD AS  A
 PRIMARY  SOURCE  OF  IDENTIFICATION FOR ACCOUNT-OPENING PURPOSES. IN THE
 EVENT A CUSTOMER'S NEW YORK CITY IDENTITY CARD DOES NOT CONTAIN A  RESI-
 DENTIAL  OR  BUSINESS  STREET ADDRESS, A COVERED ENTITY SHALL NOT DENY A

 RESIDENTIAL  OR  BUSINESS STREET ADDRESS OF THEIR NEXT OF KIN OR ANOTHER
 CONTACT  INDIVIDUAL  CONSISTENT  WITH  FEDERAL  LAWS  AND  REGULATIONS.

 CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS  OF  ALL  COVERED  ENTITIES
 CONSISTENT  WITH  LAWS,  RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 NOTHING IN SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION TWELVE-A OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL  BE
 DEEMED TO ANNUL THIS SECTION.
  3.  THE  SUPERINTENDENT  IS  EMPOWERED  TO  EXEMPT  ANY COVERED ENTITY
 SUBJECT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION UPON A DEMONSTRATION THAT  IT
 WOULD  BE  UNABLE  TO  COMPLY WITH RELEVANT FEDERAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS,
 INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAMS REGARDING
 ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS, OR UPON A DEMONSTRATION OF OTHER REASONS FOR
 INABILITY TO COMPLY THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT FINDS SUFFICIENT.
  § 4. Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part
 of this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction  to
 be  invalid  and  after  exhaustion  of all further judicial review, the
 judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the  remainder  thereof,
 but  shall  be  confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, para-
 graph, section or part of this act directly involved in the  controversy
 in which the judgment shall have been rendered.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.  Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation  of  this act on its effective date are authorized to be made and
 completed on or before such effective date.
