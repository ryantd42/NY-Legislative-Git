 Introduced by M. of A. LEE -- read once and referred to the Committee on
  Banks
 
 AN  ACT to amend the banking law, in relation to mandating acceptance of
  the New York city identity card as a primary form of identification at
  state-chartered banks, savings banks, savings and  loan  associations,
  and credit unions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares that:
  (a) Local law no. 35 for the year 2014 amended subchapter 1 of chapter
 1  of  title  3  of  the  administrative code of the city of New York by
 adding a section  3-115,  creating  the  New  York  city  identity  card
 program.  One of the main objectives of the program was to expand access
 to bank-approved identification cards, thereby reducing  the  number  of
 unbanked residents across the city. In 2015, federal regulatory authori-
 ties  notified  the city agencies in charge of administering the program
 that banks could use the New York city  identity  card  to  satisfy  the
 minimum requirements of federal anti-money laundering laws. In 2016, the
 New  York  State  Department of Financial Services further "encourage[d]
 New York state-chartered and licensed financial institutions  to  accept
 the Municipal ID as a form of acceptable identification card."
  (b) Despite authorization by federal and state regulatory authorities,
 only  approximately  one-third  of  city  banks accept the New York city
 identity card, leaving many city residents on the margins of the  finan-
 cial system. As of 2017, 11.2 percent of households in New York city had
 no bank account and ten neighborhoods accounted for nearly 35 percent of
 those  households. Residents of color, undocumented residents, and resi-
 dents living below the poverty line are disproportionately impacted  and
 are  at  greater risk of falling victim to predatory financial services,
 imperiling their financial futures and aggravating  economic  inequality
 across the state.
  (c) The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that our most vulner-
 able  residents  are  not  cut  off  from  traditional banking services.
