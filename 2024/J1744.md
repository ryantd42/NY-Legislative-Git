  COMMEMORATING  the  140th  Anniversary of the Fort
  Schuyler Club of Utica, New York
 
  WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding organizations  in  the  State
which,  through their selfless commitment and dedication, have served to
better the  quality  of  life  in  their  communities  and  have  had  a
measurable  positive  impact  on  the  lives  of its residents; the Fort
Schuyler Club is one such organization; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud  to  commemorate  the
140th Anniversary of the Fort Schuyler Club of Utica, New York which was
celebrated October of 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  1883, the Fort Schuyler Club has stood as
the area's exclusive private city club, fostering a  legacy  steeped  in
prestige and tradition; offering a unique ambiance for events, meetings,
and  leisure activities, the Club has consistently provided its esteemed
members and their guests with the highest levels of service and culinary
excellence; and
 
  WHEREAS, Renowned for its exquisite chef-prepared  cuisine  rivaling
major  city  clubs,  the Fort Schuyler Club promises a dining experience
that caters to the most discerning palates;  members  and  their  guests
enjoy  numerous  benefits,  including regular events, parties, lectures,
personalized  service,  networking  opportunities,  professional  growth
avenues,  and  an  ideal  venue  for  corporate  events,  philanthropic
gatherings, and special occasions; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Fort Schuyler Club offers various membership categories
to individuals over the age of 21;  categories  are  based  on  age  and
residence,  ensuring  a  tailored  experience  for  each member; with an
abundance of amenities, multiple meeting and dining rooms,  a  billiards
and  cardroom,  and  a  grand  ballroom,  the  club  provides  abundant
opportunities for personal and professional endeavors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the course of its many years, there have been  a  host
of  prominent  guest visitors and members, while some held distinguished
leadership roles; the first President of  the  Fort  Schuyler  Club  was
Horatio  Seymour,  former Governor of New York State; following him came
Senator Francis Kernan, and  then  former  Assistant  Treasurer  of  the
United States, Ellis H. Roberts; a guest of note was the renowned Amelia
Earhart  who  made  a  stop on a trip from New York City to Buffalo, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a rich and full history spanning well over a  century,
the  Fort  Schuyler  Club  has  undergone  many updates and changes; the
limited capacity of membership  has  fluctuated,  presidents  and  board
management have changed, women were allowed membership in later years of
the  club,  along with which came the addition of a cocktail lounge, and
the advents of war, prohibition, and economic fluctuations have also had
varying effects on the club; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite the inevitable adversities which  this  institution
has faced over its expanse of years in operation, the Fort Schuyler Club
stands  strong as a cornerstone and historical landmark of its community
and beyond, and undoubtedly will serve the residents  of  the  area  for
many more years to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  the  Fort  Schuyler  Club  celebrates  its  remarkable
140-year legacy, the launch of its new website stands as a testament  to
its  commitment to progress, excellence, tradition, and hospitality; the
website will enable members and non-members to access club  information,
explore  its history, tour the club and rooms, view upcoming events, and
more; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud  and  distinguished  history,  the  Fort
Schuyler  Club may take just pride in its purposeful growth, as it looks
forward to continuing to  serve  the  business,  social,  cultural,  and
intellectual needs of the community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the members of  the  Board  of  Management  and  to  Club
Manager, Darcy Stevenson.
