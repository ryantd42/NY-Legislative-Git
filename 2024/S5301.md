 Introduced by Sen. FERNANDEZ -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to direct the office of general services to conduct a feasibility
  study  on  installing  solar  panels on all public buildings under the
  jurisdiction of the office of general services; and providing for  the
  repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The office of general services, in  consultation  with  the
 department  of  environmental  conservation,  shall  study  the cost and
 viability of installing solar panels on all public buildings  under  the
 jurisdiction  of  the  office of general services. Such study shall also
 identify buildings that have a historic design that  the  office  deter-
 mines  shall  be unduly burdened by solar panels; and buildings that the
 office determines do not receive adequate sunlight to justify  the  cost
 of installation of solar panels.
  §  2. No later than one year after the effective date of this act, the
 office of general services shall report its findings of  such  study  to
 the governor and the legislature, as described under section one of this
 act.
  §  3.  This act shall take effect immediately, and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed one year after such effective date.
