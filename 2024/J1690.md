  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 15, 2024, as  Cholangiocarcinoma  Awareness
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 15, 2024, as
Cholangiocarcinoma  Awareness  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction with the observance of World Cholangiocarcinoma Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of cancer that develops in the
bile  ducts,  small  tubes that carry digestive fluids in and around the
liver,  including  the  gallbladder;  approximately  12,000  cases  of
cholangiocarcinoma  are diagnosed each year in the United States, making
it a rare type of cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, The mortality rate  for  cholangiocarcinoma  is  alarmingly
high  and  steadily  increasing;  unfortunately, most cases of bile duct
cancer are diagnosed  at  a  late  stage,  when  treatment  options  are
somewhat  limited  and  surgery  is often not possible; when found at an
advanced stage, the five-year survival rate is less than 20%; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in  October  of  2005,  the  Cholangiocarcinoma
Foundation  remains  true  to its mission to find a cure and improve the
quality of life for those affected by cholangiocarcinoma, also known  as
bile duct cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kelly  Green  is  the  color  which  represents
cholangiocarcinoma; citizens of the State of New York are encouraged  to
wear  this bright shade of green in an effort to bring attention to this
horrific disease which to date, has no cure; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 15, 2024, as
Cholangiocarcinoma Awareness Day in the State of New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
