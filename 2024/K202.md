  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Developmental Disabilities  Awareness
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside to increase awareness  of  conditions
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2023,  as
Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month in the State of New York,  in
conjunction  with  the observance of National Developmental Disabilities
Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals with developmental disabilities live, work, and
volunteer in every neighborhood of this great  Empire  State;  they  are
family  members,  friends,  neighbors,  co-workers,  teammates  and
classmates; and
 
  WHEREAS, The communities of New York State are strongest when  every
resident is fully able to share his or her gifts and talents; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1987, President Ronald Reagan first proclaimed the month
of  March  as Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month and called upon
Americans everywhere to  provide  the  encouragement  and  opportunities
necessary so that people with developmental disabilities can reach their
highest potential; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Despite  the  many  positive changes in societal attitude,
workplace and educational culture, health care, available resources, and
knowledge  concerning  people  with  developmental  disabilities,  much
remains  to  be  done to address the prevalence of negative stereotypes,
lingering misinformation, and  subsequent  discrimination  and  barriers
some of these vulnerable citizens face; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  Developmental  Disabilities  Awareness  Month, New
Yorkers are encouraged to recognize the abilities of all people, and  to
take  time  to  get  to  know  some  of  the  300,000  New  Yorkers with
developmental disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  crucial  that  individuals  with  developmental
disabilities  have  access  to  the  resources  which allow them to live
secure, fulfilling lives, including education, housing, employment,  and
recreational activities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Opportunities for citizens with developmental disabilities
to live as independently and productively as possible must  be  fostered
throughout New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2023,  as
 
Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
