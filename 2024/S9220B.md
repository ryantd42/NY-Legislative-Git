  THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY DECLARES IT TO BE IN  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST  TO
 PROTECT  AND  MANAGE  THE  GREAT  SWAMP, IN THE COUNTIES OF DUTCHESS AND
 PUTNAM, BY ESTABLISHING THE GREAT SWAMP RESERVE. IT IS  FURTHER  IN  THE
 PUBLIC  INTEREST TO ESTABLISH A COMMISSION MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
 STATE, COUNTY, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PREPARE A GREAT SWAMP PROTECTION
 LAND  USE  AND  MANAGEMENT  PLAN  AND  MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRESERVE,
 PROTECT AND ENHANCE THE NATURAL, RECREATIONAL, ECONOMIC AND  EDUCATIONAL
 VALUES OF THE REGION, WHICH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT.
 § 59-0105. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  THE  LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS THAT THE COUNTIES OF DUTCHESS AND PUTNAM
 CONTAIN A WETLAND ECOSYSTEM OF STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE KNOWN AS  THE  GREAT
 SWAMP.
  THE  LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT WITHIN THE GREAT SWAMP THE FEDERAL, STATE,
 COUNTY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OWN AND MANAGE  SIGNIFICANT  PROPERTIES  IN
 THE  FORM  OF PARKS, PRESERVES, HISTORIC SITES AND PROTECTED OPEN SPACE,
 WHERE THERE IS AN INTERDEPENDENT  AND  RECIPROCAL  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN
 HUMAN  ACTIVITIES  AND NATURAL PROCESSES, AND WHERE FISHING, AGRICULTURE
 AND TOURISM HAVE BEEN  THE  DOMINANT  INDUSTRIES  FOR  MORE  THAN  THREE
 HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS.
  THE  LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE GREAT SWAMP, AN AREA ENCOMPASSING OVER
 SIX THOUSAND ACRES IN THE COUNTIES OF DUTCHESS AND PUTNAM, IS  OF  CRIT-
 ICAL  IMPORTANCE  TO  THE STATE BECAUSE IT IS A WETLAND COMPRISED OF TWO
 CRITICAL WATERSHEDS.  THE GREAT SWAMP IS  INTERCONNECTED  BY  THE  SWAMP
 RIVER  AND THE EAST BRANCH CROTON RIVER, AND THE ECOLOGIC AND HYDROLOGIC
 INTEGRITY OF THIS SYSTEM MUST BE PROTECTED.
  THE LEGISLATURE ALSO FINDS THAT THE GREAT SWAMP CONTAINS  ONE  OF  THE
 GREATEST  CONCENTRATIONS  AND  DIVERSITIES OF ENDANGERED, THREATENED AND
 SPECIAL CONCERN SPECIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO BE FOUND IN THE  STATE,
 AND  THAT  PROTECTION  OF  THEIR HABITATS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE
 PEOPLE OF NEW YORK. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT THE  GREAT  SWAMP
 CONTAINS  MANY  OTHER UNIQUE NATURAL, AGRICULTURAL, HISTORICAL, CULTURAL
 AND RECREATIONAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE  AND  ULTIMATELY
 DEPENDENT  UPON  MAINTENANCE OF THE HYDROLOGIC AND ECOLOGIC INTEGRITY OF
 THIS REGION.
  THEREFORE, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS  ARTICLE  IS
 TO  AUTHORIZE  AND  DIRECT  THE  STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT,
 PRESERVE AND PROPERLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE NATURAL RESOURCES OF  THE  GREAT
 SWAMP  AND  TO  ENCOURAGE  COORDINATION OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND STUDIES
 AFFECTING LAND AND WATER RESOURCES IN THE  REGION  AND  TO  PROTECT  THE
 VALUE  OF  THE  EXISTING  PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT HAS ALREADY
 BEEN MADE TO ACQUIRE LAND IN THE REGION.
  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT A PORTION OF THE  SYSTEM  KNOWN  AS
 THE  GREAT  SWAMP  AREA REQUIRES THE PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A
 STATE SUPPORTED GREAT SWAP PROTECTION LAND USE AND MANAGEMENT PLAN  THAT
 WILL  ASSIST  IN  THE  PRESERVATION  OF  THE  CORE  PRESERVATION  AREA,
 PROTECTION OF THE GREAT SWAMP AREA AND FOR THE DESIGNATION OF COMPATIBLE
 GROWTH AREAS TO ACCOMMODATE APPROPRIATE PATTERNS OF REGIONAL GROWTH WITH
 RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHTS OF PRIVATE LAND  OWNERS  AND  THE  PURPOSE  OF
 PRESERVATION OF THE CORE AREA.
