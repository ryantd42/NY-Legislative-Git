 PUTNAM, BY ESTABLISHING THE GREAT SWAMP RESERVE. IT IS  FURTHER  IN  THE
 PUBLIC  INTEREST TO ESTABLISH A COMMISSION MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
 STATE, COUNTY, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PREPARE A COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE
 AND  MANAGEMENT  PLAN  AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRESERVE, PROTECT AND

 THE REGION, WHICH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT.
 § 59-0105. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  THE  LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS THAT THE COUNTIES OF DUTCHESS AND PUTNAM
 CONTAIN A WETLAND ECOSYSTEM OF STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE KNOWN AS  THE  GREAT
 SWAMP.
  THE  LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT WITHIN THE GREAT SWAMP THE FEDERAL, STATE,
 COUNTY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OWN AND MANAGE  SIGNIFICANT  PROPERTIES  IN
 THE  FORM  OF PARKS, PRESERVES, HISTORIC SITES AND PROTECTED OPEN SPACE,
 WHERE THERE IS AN INTERDEPENDENT  AND  RECIPROCAL  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN
 HUMAN  ACTIVITIES  AND NATURAL PROCESSES, AND WHERE FISHING, AGRICULTURE
 AND TOURISM HAVE BEEN  THE  DOMINANT  INDUSTRIES  FOR  MORE  THAN  THREE
 HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS.
  THE  LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE GREAT SWAMP, AN AREA ENCOMPASSING OVER
 SIX THOUSAND ACRES IN THE COUNTIES OF DUTCHESS AND PUTNAM, IS  OF  CRIT-
 ICAL  IMPORTANCE  TO  THE STATE BECAUSE IT IS A WETLAND COMPRISED OF TWO
 CRITICAL WATERSHEDS.  THE GREAT SWAMP IS  INTERCONNECTED  BY  THE  SWAMP
 RIVER  AND THE EAST BRANCH CROTON RIVER, AND THE ECOLOGIC AND HYDROLOGIC
 INTEGRITY OF THIS SYSTEM MUST BE PROTECTED.
  THE LEGISLATURE ALSO FINDS THAT THE GREAT SWAMP CONTAINS  ONE  OF  THE
 GREATEST  CONCENTRATIONS  AND  DIVERSITIES OF ENDANGERED, THREATENED AND
 SPECIAL CONCERN SPECIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO BE FOUND IN THE  STATE,
 AND  THAT  PROTECTION  OF  THEIR HABITATS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE
 PEOPLE OF NEW YORK. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT THE  GREAT  SWAMP
 CONTAINS  MANY  OTHER UNIQUE NATURAL, AGRICULTURAL, HISTORICAL, CULTURAL
 AND RECREATIONAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE  AND  ULTIMATELY
 DEPENDENT  UPON  MAINTENANCE OF THE HYDROLOGIC AND ECOLOGIC INTEGRITY OF
 THIS REGION.
  THEREFORE, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS  ARTICLE  IS
 TO  ALLOW THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT, PRESERVE AND PROP-
 ERLY MANAGE THE UNIQUE NATURAL RESOURCES  OF  THE  GREAT  SWAMP  AND  TO
 ENCOURAGE  COORDINATION  OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND STUDIES AFFECTING LAND
 AND WATER RESOURCES IN THE REGION AND TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF THE EXIST-
 ING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE TO  ACQUIRE
 LAND IN THE REGION.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER  FINDS THAT A PORTION OF THE SYSTEM KNOWN AS
 THE GREAT SWAMP AREA REQUIRES THE PREPARATION AND  IMPLEMENTATION  OF  A
 STATE  SUPPORTED  COMPREHENSIVE  LAND  USE AND MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT WILL
 ASSIST IN THE PRESERVATION OF THE CORE PRESERVATION AREA, PROTECTION  OF
 THE  GREAT SWAMP AREA AND FOR THE DESIGNATION OF COMPATIBLE GROWTH AREAS
 TO ACCOMMODATE APPROPRIATE PATTERNS OF REGIONAL GROWTH WITH  RECOGNITION
 OF  THE RIGHTS OF PRIVATE LAND OWNERS AND THE PURPOSE OF PRESERVATION OF
 THE CORE AREA.
