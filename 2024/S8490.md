 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law and the  adminis-
  trative  code  of the city of New York, in relation to the calculation
  of the final average salary for  purposes  of  the  calculation  of  a
  pension benefit

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivisions a and b of section 512 of the  retirement  and

 of 2016, and subdivision b as amended by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012,
 are amended to read as follows:
  a.  A  member's final average salary shall be the average wages earned
 by such a member during any three consecutive years  which  provide  the
 highest  average wage; provided, however, if the wages earned during any
 year included in the period  used  to  determine  final  average  salary
 exceeds  that  of the average of the previous two years by more than ten
 percent, the amount in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from  the
 computation  of  final  average salary.  [Notwithstanding the preceding
 provisions of this subdivision to the contrary, for a member  who  first
 becomes  a  member of the New York state and local employees' retirement
 system on or after April first, two thousand twelve, or for a  New  York
 city  police/fire  revised  plan  member,  a New York city enhanced plan
 member who receives the ordinary  disability  benefit  provided  for  in

 dental disability benefit provided for in paragraph three of subdivision
 c  of  section  five  hundred  seven  of  this  article, a New York city
 uniformed correction/sanitation revised plan member or  an  investigator
 revised  plan member, a member's final average salary shall be the aver-
 age wages earned by such a member  during  any  five  consecutive  years
 which  provide the highest average wage; provided, however, if the wages
 earned during any year included in the period used  to  determine  final
 average salary exceeds that of the average of the previous four years by
 more  than  ten  percent,  the  amount in excess of ten percent shall be

 excluded from the computation of final average salary.]  In  determining
 final  average  salary  pursuant  to  any provision of this subdivision,
 where the period used to determine final average salary  is  the  period
 which  immediately  precedes the date of retirement, any month or months
 (not in excess of twelve) which would otherwise be included in computing
 final average salary but during which the member was on authorized leave
 of absence at partial pay or without pay  shall  be  excluded  from  the
 computation  of final average salary and the month or an equal number of
 months immediately preceding such period shall be  substituted  in  lieu
 thereof.
  b.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision a of this section,
 with respect to members of the  New  York  state  employees'  retirement
 system [who first become members of the New York state and local employ-
 ees' retirement system before April first, two thousand twelve], the New
 York  state and local police and fire retirement system and the New York
 city teachers' retirement system, a member's final average salary  shall
 be  equal  to  one-third  of  the  highest total wages earned during any
 continuous period of employment for which the member was  credited  with
 three  years  of  service credit; provided, however, if the wages earned
 during any year of credited service included the period used  to  deter-
 mine final average salary exceeds the average of the wages of the previ-
 ous  two  years of credited service by more than ten percent, the amount
 in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from the computation of final
 average salary. [For members who first become a member of the  New  York
 state  and  local  employees' retirement system on or after April first,
 two thousand twelve, with respect to members of the New York  state  and
 local  employees'  retirement  system,  a  member's final average salary
 shall be equal to one-fifth of the highest total wages earned during any
 continuous period of employment for which the member was  credited  with
 five  years  of  service  credit; provided, however, if the wages earned
 during any year of credited service included the period used  to  deter-
 mine final average salary exceeds the average of the wages of the previ-
 ous  four years of credited service by more than ten percent, the amount
 in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from the computation of final
 average salary.]
  § 2. Subdivisions a and b of section 608 of the retirement and  social
 security  law, as amended by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, are amended
 to read as follows:
  a. [For members who first become members of a public retirement system
 of the state before April first, two  thousand  twelve,  a]  A  member's
 final  average salary shall be the average wages earned by such a member
 during any three consecutive years which  provide  the  highest  average
 wage; provided, however, if the wages earned during any year included in
 the  period  used  to determine final average salary exceeds that of the
 average of the previous two years by more than ten percent,  the  amount
 in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from the computation of final
 average  salary.  [For  members who first become members of the New York
 state and local employees' retirement  system  or  the  New  York  state
 teachers'  retirement  system  on  or  after  April  first, two thousand
 twelve, a member's final average  salary  shall  be  the  average  wages
 earned  by  such  member during any five consecutive years which provide
 the highest average wage; provided, however, if the wages earned  during
 any  year  included in the period used to determine final average salary
 exceeds that of the average of the previous four years by more than  ten
 percent,  the amount in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from the
 computation of final average salary.] Where the period used to determine
 S. 8490  3
 
 final average salary is the period which immediately precedes  the  date
 of retirement, any month or months (not in excess of twelve) which would
 otherwise be included in computing final average salary but during which
 the  member was on authorized leave of absence at partial pay or without
 pay shall be excluded from the computation of final average  salary  and
 the month or an equal number of months immediately preceding such period
 shall be substituted in lieu thereof.
  b.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision a of this section,

 and local employees' retirement system and the New York  city  teachers'
 retirement  system [before April first, two thousand twelve], a member's

 service included in the period used to determine  final  average  salary
 exceeds  the  average of the wages of the previous two years of credited
 service by more than ten percent, the amount in excess  of  ten  percent
 shall  be  excluded  from the computation of final average salary. [With
 respect to members who first become members of the New  York  state  and
 local  employees'  retirement  system  and  the  New York city teachers'
 retirement system on or  after  April  first,  two  thousand  twelve,  a
 member's final average salary shall be equal to one-fifth of the highest
 total  wages  earned  by  such  member  during  any continuous period of
 employment for which the member was credited with five years of  service
 credit;  provided, however, if the wages earned during any year of cred-
 ited service included in the period  used  to  determine  final  average
 salary  exceeds  the  average of the wages of the previous four years of
 credited service by more than ten percent, the amount in excess  of  ten
 percent shall be excluded from the computation of final average salary.]
  §  3.  Subparagraph  (ii)  of paragraph 14 of subdivision e of section
 13-638.4 of the administrative code of the city of New York, as  amended
 by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, is amended to read as follows:
  (ii)  Subject to the provisions of subdivision f of this section where
 those provisions are applicable, and notwithstanding the  provisions  of
 subdivisions  a  and  c  of section six hundred eight of the RSSL, for a
 tier IV member of NYCERS who is a New York city revised plan member  (as
 defined  in  subdivision  m of section six hundred one of the RSSL) or a
 tier IV member of BERS who is a New York city revised plan  member,  the
 term  "final  average  salary",  as used in article fifteen of the RSSL,
 shall be equal to [one-fifth]  ONE-THIRD  of  the  highest  total  wages
 earned  by  such  member  during any continuous period of employment for
 which the member was credited with [five] THREE years of service credit;
 provided that if the wages earned during any year  of  credited  service
 included  in  the  period used to determine final average salary exceeds
 the average of the wages of the previous four years of credited  service
 by  more  than ten percent, the amount in excess of ten percent shall be
 excluded from the computation of final average salary, provided  further
 that  "wages",  as  used  in  this  paragraph, shall mean the applicable
 provisions and limitations of the term "wages", as defined  in  subdivi-
 sion l of section six hundred one of the RSSL.
  §  4. Subdivision a of section 1209 of the retirement and social secu-
 rity law, as amended by chapter 705 of the laws of 2023, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  a.  For  members  who  first  become members of the New York state and
 local police and fire retirement system on or  after  April  first,  two
 S. 8490  4
 
 thousand  twelve, a member's final average salary shall be equal to one-
 fifth of the highest total  wages  earned  by  such  member  during  any
 continuous  period  of employment for which the member was credited with
 five  years  of  service  credit; provided, however, if the wages earned
 during any year of credited service  included  in  the  period  used  to
 determine  final  average salary exceeds the average of the wages of the
 previous four years of credited service by more than  ten  percent,  the
 amount  in  excess of ten percent shall be excluded from the computation
 of final average salary.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, BEGINNING ON OR AFTER APRIL
 FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, A MEMBER'S FINAL AVERAGE  SALARY  SHALL
 BE  EQUAL  TO ONE-THIRD OF THE HIGHEST TOTAL WAGES EARNED BY SUCH MEMBER
 DURING ANY CONTINUOUS PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT  FOR  WHICH  THE  MEMBER  WAS
 CREDITED  WITH  THREE YEARS OF SERVICE CREDIT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IF THE
 WAGES EARNED DURING ANY YEAR OF CREDITED SERVICE INCLUDED IN THE  PERIOD
 USED  TO DETERMINE FINAL AVERAGE SALARY EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE OF THE WAGES
 OF THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE BY MORE THAN TEN  PERCENT,
 THE  AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF TEN PERCENT SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTA-
 TION OF FINAL AVERAGE SALARY. Wages in excess of the annual salary  paid
 to  the  governor pursuant to section three of article four of the state
 constitution shall be excluded from the  computation  of  final  average
 salary  for  members  who first become members of the New York state and
 local police and fire retirement system on or  after  April  first,  two
 thousand twelve.
  § 5.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to section 25 of the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide Tier 6 members in the New York State and Local
 Retirement System a final average salary based on their  highest  salary
 earned over three consecutive years, where the salary earned in any year
 cannot  exceed  the  average of the previous two years by more than 10%.
 Currently, final average salary for these  members  is  based  on  their
 highest  salary  earned  over  five  consecutive years, where the salary
 earned in any year cannot exceed the average of the previous four  years
 by  more  than  10%.  The provisions of Section 25 of the Retirement and
 Social Security Law shall not apply.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be shared by the
 State of New York and the local participating employers in the  NYSLERS.
 If  this  bill  were  enacted  during  the 2024 Legislative Session, the
 increase in the present value of benefits would be  approximately  $1.17
 billion.
  NYSLERS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $0  $220 million
  Tier 6  $1.17 billion  $950 million
  Total  $1.17 billion  $1.17 billion
 
  In  the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in  NYSLERS  is  0.4%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately $51 million to the State of New York and approximately $76
 million to the local participating employers. THIS PERMANENT ANNUAL COST
 S. 8490  5
 
 WILL  INCREASE  as  Tier  6 salary grows and will vary by employer based
 upon the plan coverage and salary reported in Tier 6.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would  be  shared
 by  the  State  of New York and the local participating employers in the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the increase in the present value of  benefits  would  be  approximately
 $341 million.
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $0  $33 million
  Tier 6  $341 million  $308 million
  Total  $341 million  $341 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating  employers in the NYSLPFRS is 0.70% of billable salary, or
 approximately $6.0 million to the State of New  York  and  approximately
 $25  million to the local participating employers.  THE PERMANENT ANNUAL
 COST WILL INCREASE as Tier 6 salary grows  and  will  vary  by  employer
 based upon the plan coverage and salary reported in Tier 6.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based  on  265,533 Tier 6 members in the
 NYSLERS and 16,599 Tier 6 members in the NYSLPFRS, with annual salary of
 approximately $12 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively,  as  of  March
 31, 2023.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2023 actuari-
 al valuation.  Distributions and other statistics can be  found  in  the
 2023  Report  of the Actuary and the 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.
  The actuarial assumptions and methods used are described in  the  2023
 Annual  Report  to  the  Comptroller  on  Actuarial Assumptions, and the
 Codes, Rules and Regulations  of  the  State  of  New  York:  Audit  and
 Control.

 fication Standards to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated February 2,  2024,  and  intended  for  use  only
 during  the  2024  Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note No. 2024-118,
 prepared by the Actuary for the New  York  State  and  Local  Retirement
 System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As  it relates to the New York State Teacher's Retirement System, this
 bill would amend subdivisions a and b of Section 608 of  the  Retirement
 and Social Security Law to change the definition of final average salary
 for  Tier  6 members to be the same as that for Tier 3, 4 and 5 members.
 The final average salary for Tier 6 members would be based on any  three
 consecutive  years  which produce the highest average salary. Currently,
 the final average salary for Tier 6 members is  based  on  the  salaries
 S. 8490  6

 earned during any five consecutive years which provide the highest aver-
 age  salary. Additionally, under the bill, as in Tier 3, 4 and 5, if the
 salary for any year used in the period exceeds that of  the  average  of
 the  prior two years by more than 10%, the amount in excess of 10% shall
 be excluded from the computation. Currently, under Tier 6, if the salary
 for any year used in the period exceeds that of the average of the prior
 four years by more than 10%, the amount in excess  of  10%  is  excluded
 from the computation.
  The  annual  cost  to  the  employers of members of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System for this benefit is estimated  to  be  $23.1
 million or 0.12% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The  System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer contribution
 rate that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without  any
 assets, is equal to 5.31% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture.  This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost of
 Tier 6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed  change
 to  the  Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new entrant rate
 is estimated to increase to 5.55% of pay, an increase of 0.24% of pay.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System.  The most recent data  distributions  and  statistics
 can  be  found  in the System's Annual Report for fiscal year ended June
 30, 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial state-
 ments and can also be found in the  System's  Annual  Report.  Actuarial
 assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.
  The  source  of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2024-17 dated February 2,
 2024 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State  Teach-
 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2024
 Legislative Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary  for  the
 New  York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the Ameri-
 can Academy of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards  of  the
 American  Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation, as it relates to the New York City
 Retirement Systems and Pension Funds (NYCRS), would increase  the  Final
 Average Salary used to calculate pension benefits for certain Tier 3 and
 Tier  6 members of NYCRS by reducing the number of years included in the
 average from five years to three years.

  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS: Currently, Final Average Salary (FAS) is
 based on a five-year average, with each year's salary limited to 110% of
 the average of the prior four year's salaries for the following groups:
  * Tier 3 and Tier 6 members who joined NYCRS  on  or  after  April  1,
 2012, and
  *  Tier 3 enhanced members of POLICE and FIRE who retire for disabili-
 ty.
  Under the proposed legislation, the FAS  for  such  members  would  be
 based  on  a three-year average, with each year's salary limited to 110%
 of the average of the prior two year's salaries (prior four year's sala-
 ries for NYCERS and BERS).
  The five-year FAS for enhanced disability benefits for Corrections and
 Sanitation members of NYCERS is provided as part of an  agreement  under
 Retirement  and  Social Security Law Article 25 and is assumed to remain
 unchanged by this proposed legislation.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
