  CONGRATULATING  Timbuk  Tu  upon  the  occasion of
  achieving over 30 years in business
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
congratulate  Timbuk  Tu upon the occasion of achieving over 30 years in
business; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kwasi Owusu came to Syracuse from Ghana  in  the  1970s  to
play  soccer  and study agriculture at the SUNY College of Environmental
Science and Forestry; he initially became a state  employee  working  in
agriculture,  but eventually left to help his cousin run a furniture and
appliance business; and
 
  WHEREAS, The owner of Timbuk Tu, Kwasi Owusu, has  a  storied  past,
having  owned  multiple  of  his  own  businesses  throughout  his life,
including a leather handbag and jewelry  street  vendor  operation,  his
record store called Global Records, and later, Timbuk Tu; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Timbuk  Tu  has been located in the Southside of Syracuse,
New York, for the last 32 years, standing as a pillar of  the  community
for a great length of time; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kwasi  Owusu's  store, Timbuk Tu, specializes in authentic
African imported goods, and first opened his shop in  1992  after  seven
years  of  running  a  record  store; in working at the record store, he
identified an interest from customers regarding African products; and
 
  WHEREAS, Timbuk Tu  carries  skincare  products,  an  assortment  of
apparel,  fabrics,  jewelry, furniture, cultural books, music, painting,
body essentials, and handmade leather bags; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kwasi Owusu has been successful at  building  community  in
his  city  of  Syracuse;  he  was  among the first residents and vendors
involved in the early 2000s who pioneered the Pan-African Village at the
New York State Fair; for three years, he also served as a  board  member
for the Juneteenth celebration; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthering his community impact, Kwasi Owusu, alongside his
neighbor  in  business,  Irvin  Hanslip,  started  a  dance and drumming
troupe, and played on the International Stars, a semi-pro soccer team in
Syracuse; and
 
  WHEREAS, Connecting his New York  business  with  his  former  home,
Kwasi  Owusu bought many of his products, including leather handbags and
baskets, from the village of Atwima Asamang, where he lived in  Northern
Ghana,  undoubtedly  helping the families that make the products abroad;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  In early February of 2024, Timbuk Tu will officially close
its doors; Kwasi Owusu hopes to travel and spend more quality time  with
his  beloved  wife,  Gwendolyn, in the time that comes after closing the
business; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kwasi Owusu, in forever dedication to his community,  hopes
to  ensure  that whichever business assumes the location of Timbuk Tu is
beneficial to the Southside Syracuse residents and community  at  large;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of Timbuk Tu is in direct correlation to the
efforts of its hardworking and dedicated owner, Kwasi  Owusu,  who  will
stand  as  a  role  model  to all great business owners in the State and
beyond; his involvement is, and always has  been,  characterized  by  an
impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard of excellence in all undertakings; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and state economies, and its vibrant and purposeful  role  in  improving
the quality of life in its community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Timbuk Tu upon the occasion of achieving over 30  years  in
business,  and  to wish Kwasi Owusu joy in his retirement and success in
all future undertakings; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Kwasi Owusu, owner of Timbuk Tu.
