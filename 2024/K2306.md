  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 29,  2024,  as  Furniture  and  TV  Tip-Over
  Prevention Awareness Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 29, 2024, as Furniture and  TV
Tip-Over Prevention Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  purpose  of  Furniture  and  TV  Tip-Over  Prevention
Awareness Day is to bring awareness and help educate New  Yorkers  about
the  potential  dangers  of  unsecured  furniture, TVs and appliances in
homes where children live,  visit  often,  or  are  cared  for,  and  to
encourage  parents  and caregivers to take proper precautions to prevent
tip-over accidents; and
 
  WHEREAS, October 29 is being designated as Furniture and TV Tip-Over
Prevention Awareness Day in loving memory  of  the  birthday  of  Harper
Fried,  a  3-year-old Hudson Valley girl who tragically died as a result
of a tip-over accident; and
 
  WHEREAS,  HarperSmiles  Inc.  was  created  following  this  tragic
accident;  the mission of this noble organization is to educate, inspire
and motivate parents to secure furniture and prevent tip-over accidents;
and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the U.S. Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission
("CPSC"),  an  estimated  25,500  people  were  treated annually in U.S.
hospital emergency  departments  for  product  instability  or  tip-over
injuries  related  to  televisions,  furniture, and appliances from 2017
through 2019; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 2000,  there  were  581  deaths  related  to  product
instability or television, furniture, and appliance tip-overs, according
to the CPSC; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According to a CPSC study, when a television falls from an
average size dresser, it can fall with the force of thousands of pounds,
or a force 10 times more powerful than an NFL lineman; and
 
  WHEREAS, Families can eliminate furniture, TV and appliance tip-over
accidents by using sturdy furniture designed to hold TVs;  mounting  TVs
on  walls; securing furniture, particularly top-heavy furniture, TVs and
appliances to walls using simple  safety  devices  such  as  braces  and
straps;  and  by  removing tempting objects for children from the top of
TVs and furniture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  encourages  all  New  Yorkers,
particularly  parents  and caregivers with young children, to take these
simple, low cost steps to prevent tip-over-related injuries and  deaths;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  October  29,  2024,  as
 
Furniture  and  TV Tip-Over Prevention Awareness Day in the State of New
York, and to express its most sincere condolences to  the  families  who
have lost children as a result of tip-over accidents; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
