  COMMENDING  The  Dad  Gang  and  its  nonprofit
  organization,  Random  Acts  of  Dadness,  upon  the
  occasion of hosting its Annual March of Dads
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those individuals who have inspired and brought pride  to
our  majestic  Empire  State  with  their  character  and  outstanding
achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend The Dad Gang and its  nonprofit  organization,  Random  Acts  of
Dadness, upon the occasion of hosting its Annual March of Dads; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  March  of  Dads  will  take  place:  June 16th in Los
Angeles, California; June 29th, in the Bronx, New York;  August  4th  in
Washington, D.C.; and September 19th in Atlanta, Georgia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Dad  Gang  is  a  global organization founded by Sean
Williams, committed to changing negative stereotypes  of  Black  fathers
and shaping the Black fathers of tomorrow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Dad  Gang  is  an  organization committed to building
community among Black fathers globally through the creation  of  a  safe
space for Black men to find camaraderie and support; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dad Gang was created in 2016 initially through an Instagram
page that displayed positive and real examples of Black fathers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Dad  Gang  has  evolved  into  a  community  of
socially-conscious allies whose motto is "we are dad goals"  which  sums
up  the  purpose  of  the  group's events: to enjoy their time together,
while setting the new standard  of  what  black  fatherhood  looks  like
worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the  CDC, African-American fathers who live
with their children are more  active  than  other  groups  in  terms  of
changing diapers and bathing and dressing their kids; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Dad Gang began its nonprofit organization, Random Acts
of Dadness, to solidify its support system with dads alongside Dad Gang;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend The Dad Gang and its  nonprofit  organization,  Random  Acts  of
Dadness,  upon  the occasion of hosting its Annual March of Dads; and be
it further
