  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The public service law is amended by adding a new section
 66-w to read as follows:
  § 66-W. ADVANCING GRID ENHANCEMENT TECHNOLOGIES. 1. FOR  THE  PURPOSES
 OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A)  "GRID  ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY" MEANS ANY HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE TECH-
 NOLOGY THAT ENABLES ENHANCED OR  MORE  EFFICIENT  PERFORMANCE  FROM  THE
 ELECTRIC  TRANSMISSION  SYSTEM,  INCLUDING,  BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DYNAMIC
 LINE RATING, ADVANCED POWER FLOW CONTROL TECHNOLOGY, TOPOLOGY  OPTIMIZA-
 TION,  ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING, AND ENERGY STORAGE WHEN USED AS A TRANS-
 MISSION RESOURCE.
  (B) "ADVANCED RECONDUCTORS" MEANS HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN CONDUCT
 ELECTRICITY ACROSS TRANSMISSION LINES AND DEMONSTRATE ENHANCED  PERFORM-
 ANCE OVER TRADITIONAL CONDUCTOR PRODUCTS.
  (C)  "DYNAMIC LINE RATING" MEANS HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES
 USED TO APPROPRIATELY UPDATE THE CALCULATED THERMAL LIMITS  OF  EXISTING
 TRANSMISSION LINES BASED ON REAL-TIME AND FORECASTED WEATHER CONDITIONS.
  (D) "ADVANCED POWER FLOW CONTROL" MEANS HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE TECH-
 NOLOGIES  USED  TO PUSH OR PULL ELECTRIC POWER IN A MANNER THAT BALANCES
 OVERLOADED LINES AND UNDERUTILIZED  CORRIDORS  WITHIN  THE  TRANSMISSION
 NETWORK.
  (E)  "TOPOLOGY  OPTIMIZATION" MEANS HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE TECHNOLO-
 GIES THAT IDENTIFY RECONFIGURATIONS OF THE  TRANSMISSION  GRID  AND  CAN
 ENABLE  THE ROUTING OF POWER FLOWS AROUND CONGESTED OR OVERLOADED TRANS-
 MISSION ELEMENTS.
  (F) "DISTRIBUTION COMPANY" MEANS A COMPANY ENGAGING  IN  THE  DISTRIB-
 UTION  OF  ELECTRICITY  OR OWNING, OPERATING OR CONTROLLING DISTRIBUTION
 FACILITIES; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT A  DISTRIBUTION  COMPANY  SHALL  NOT
 INCLUDE  ANY  ENTITY  WHICH  OWNS OR OPERATES PLANT OR EQUIPMENT USED TO

 A. 9105  2
 
 PRODUCE ELECTRICITY, STEAM AND CHILLED WATER, OR  AN  AFFILIATE  ENGAGED
 SOLELY  IN  THE  PROVISION OF SUCH ELECTRICITY, STEAM AND CHILLED WATER,
 WHERE THE ELECTRICITY PRODUCED BY SUCH ENTITY OR ITS AFFILIATE IS PRIMA-
 RILY  FOR  THE  BENEFIT  OF  HOSPITALS AND NON-PROFIT EDUCATIONAL INSTI-
 TUTIONS.
  (G) "TRANSMISSION" MEANS THE DELIVERY OF POWER OVER LINES THAT OPERATE
 AT A VOLTAGE LEVEL TYPICALLY EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN  SIXTY-NINE  THOU-
 SAND VOLTS FROM GENERATING FACILITIES ACROSS INTERCONNECTED HIGH VOLTAGE
 LINES TO WHERE IT ENTERS A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
  2. FOR RATE CASE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH A DISTRIB-
 UTION  COMPANY  PROPOSES CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OR ADDITIONS TO THE TRANS-
 MISSION SYSTEM, SUCH DISTRIBUTION COMPANY SHALL  CONDUCT  A  COST-EFFEC-
 TIVENESS  AND  TIMETABLE ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE STRATEGIES, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, THE DEPLOYMENT OF GRID ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES,  ADVANCED
 RECONDUCTORING,  AND  ENERGY  STORAGE  USED  AS A TRANSMISSION RESOURCE.
 WHERE GRID ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES, ADVANCED  RECONDUCTORING,  OR  ENERGY
 STORAGE  USED  AS A TRANSMISSION RESOURCE WHETHER IN COMBINATION WITH OR
 INSTEAD OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, OFFER A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE STRATEGY  TO
 ACHIEVE  TRANSMISSION  GOALS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DISTRIBUTED
 ENERGY RESOURCE INTERCONNECTION, THE DEPARTMENT MAY APPROVE THE  DEPLOY-
 MENT  OF GRID ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES, ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING, OR ENERGY
 STORAGE USED AS A TRANSMISSION RESOURCE AS PART OF THE OVERALL SOLUTIONS
 STRATEGY.
  3. AS PART OF A RATE CASE FILING OR OTHER FILING IN WHICH IT  PROPOSES
 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OR ADDITIONS TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, A DISTRIB-
 UTION  COMPANY  MAY  PROPOSE  A  PERFORMANCE  INCENTIVE  MECHANISM  THAT
 PROVIDES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THE COST-EFFECTIVE DEPLOYMENT OF GRID
 ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES, ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING, OR ENERGY STORAGE  USED
 AS A TRANSMISSION RESOURCE.
  4.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  PROMULGATE ANY RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS IT
 SHALL DEEM NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  5. BEGINNING FIVE YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION,  AND
 EVERY  FIVE  YEARS  THEREAFTER,  EACH  DISTRIBUTION COMPANY SHALL MAKE A
 COMPLIANCE FILING WITH THE DEPARTMENT, NEW YORK INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPER-
 ATOR (NEW YORK ISO), AND THE COMMISSION ON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER FIRST  ON
 THE  DEPLOYMENT OF GRID ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES, ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING,
 OR ENERGY STORAGE USED AS A TRANSMISSION RESOURCE IN A FORMAT DETERMINED
 BY THE DEPARTMENT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal  of  any  rule  or regulation necessary for the implementation of
