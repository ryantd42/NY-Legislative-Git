  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 6, 2024, as Danish American Heritage Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it is the intent of this Legislative Body to
applaud and commemorate events which foster ethnic pride  and  exemplify
the cultural diversity that represents and strengthens the spirit of the
people and the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud to memorialize Governor
Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 6, 2023, as  Danish  American  Heritage
Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State is home to more than 27,000 people of Danish
ancestry,  making  up  nearly  one-tenth  of  one percent of the state's
population, with  approximately  1.1  million  individuals  with  Danish
heritage nationwide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States  and the Kingdom of Denmark share, and
enjoy, a close relationship that is built upon a  mutual  commitment  to
democracy,  freedom,  trade, rule of law, security, and prosperity, with
the cooperation of both nation's military, economy and politics  serving
as the basis of an enduring partnership; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first Danes in New York were aboard the Halve Maen, the
ship  of Henry Hudson, which sailed into New York Harbor in 1609; later,
the majority of Danish immigrants originally settled in  New  York  City
and  other  port  cities to work as shipping agents, suppliers, and ship
builders before settling towards Midwestern farmland; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York serves as the home of one of  the  most  prominent
Danish  American  heritage organizations, the Danish American Chamber of
Commerce,  which  seeks  to  provide  their  members  with  networking
opportunities,  mentoring,  and  serve as the preferred business network
for the Danish American business community; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York is home to the Danish Seamen's Church in Brooklyn,
which serves as the spiritual outpost for  Danes  living  in  New  York,
providing  religious,  social, and cultural opportunities for all people
with relations with Denmark; and
 
  WHEREAS, One of the most  prominent  Danish-New  Yorkers  was  Jacob
Riis,  who  as a social reformer and pioneer of investigatory journalism
helped to expose the living  conditions  in  New  York  City's  tenement
housing  at the turn of the 20th century in his book, How the Other Half
Lives, leading to the first significant state legislation  reducing  the
evils of tenement houses; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration  of  Danish  American  Heritage  Day will
contribute to the Danish-American experience in the State  of  New  York
and  help further the preservation and enhancement of the Danish culture
and heritage, adding so much to the rich mosaic of which our great State
and Nation are comprised; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 6, 2024, as Danish
American Heritage Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
