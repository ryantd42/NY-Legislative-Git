  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 502 of the vehicle and traffic law  is  amended  by
 adding a new subdivision 2-a to read as follows:
  2-A.  DEFINITIONS.  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM "FIT" SHALL
 MEAN DEEMED BY A LICENSED PHYSICIAN TO  HAVE  THE  PHYSICAL  AND  MENTAL
 CAPACITY TO OPERATE A MOTOR VEHICLE.
  § 2.  Paragraph (a) of subdivision 6 of section 502 of the vehicle and
 traffic law, as amended by chapter 37 of the laws of 2019, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (a)  A  license  issued  pursuant  to subdivision five of this section
 shall be valid until the expiration date contained thereon, unless  such
 license  is suspended, revoked or cancelled. Such license may be renewed
 by submission of an application for renewal, the fee prescribed by  law,
 proofs  of  prior licensing, fitness and acceptable vision prescribed by
 the commissioner, the applicant's social security  number  or,  in  lieu
 thereof,  with  respect  to an application for a non-commercial driver's
 license or learner's permit which does not meet  federal  standards  for
 identification, an affidavit signed by such applicant that they have not
 been issued a social security number, and if required by the commission-
 er,  a  photo  image  of  the  applicant in such numbers and form as the
 commissioner shall prescribe.  UPON THE SEVENTH APPLICATION  SUBMISSION,
 AND  THEREAFTER  FOR  A  RENEWAL  OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE, APPLICANTS MUST
 SUBMIT PROOF OF A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, CONDUCTED BY A  LICENSED  PHYSI-

 VEHICLE. In addition, an applicant for renewal of a license containing a
 hazardous material endorsement shall pass an examination to retain  such
 endorsement.  The  commissioner  shall, with respect to the renewal of a
 hazardous  materials  endorsement,  comply with the requirements imposed
 upon states by sections 383.141 and 1572.13 of title 49 of the  code  of
 federal  regulations.  A  renewal of such license shall be issued by the
 commissioner upon approval of such  application,  except  that  no  such
 license  shall  be issued if its issuance would be inconsistent with the
 provisions of section five hundred sixteen of  this  title,  and  except
 that  the commissioner may refuse to renew such license if the applicant
 is the holder of a currently valid or renewable license to drive  issued
 by another state or foreign country unless the applicant surrenders such
 license.
  §  3.  a.  The  "New  York state task force on the effects of aging on
 driving ability" is hereby established (hereinafter referred to  as  the
 "task  force"). The task force shall study the effects of aging on driv-
 ing ability and develop a comprehensive approach to licensing drivers.
  b. Such study shall include:
  (i) Effective and efficient identification of drivers at risk of being
 involved in a motor vehicle accident because of  functional  limitations
 that affect their driving ability;
  (ii) Prevalence and effect of degenerative processes affecting vision,
 hearing, mobility, cognitive functions, and reaction time;
  (iii)  Implementation  and effect of the department's vision screening
 requirements and examination of new technologies;
  (iv) Availability and  effectiveness  of  remedial  measures  such  as
 skills training, adaptive equipment, physical therapy, and adjustment of
 driving  practices that will allow people to drive safely for as long as
 possible;
  (v) Availability of alternative forms of transportation for people who
 can no longer safely drive; and
  (vi) Effectiveness of existing public education  initiatives  relating
 to at-risk drivers.
  §  4.  Such  task  force shall consist of the following members, which
 shall each serve for a term of two years:
  a. one member appointed by the governor;
  b. one member appointed by the temporary president of the senate;
  c. one member appointed by the minority leader of the senate;
  d. one member appointed by the speaker of the assembly;
  e. one member appointed by the minority leader of the assembly; and
  f. two members appointed by the  commissioner  of  the  department  of
 motor vehicles.
  §  5. Such members of the task force shall receive no compensation for
 their services, but shall be reimbursed for all  expenses  actually  and
 necessarily incurred by them in the performance of their duties.  Vacan-
 cies  in  office  shall  be  filled  in  the same manner as the original
 appointment.
  § 6. The task force shall report its findings from such study and make
 recommendations with supporting legislation  to  the  governor  and  the
 legislature within one year of the effective date of this act.
  § 7. This act shall take effect immediately.
