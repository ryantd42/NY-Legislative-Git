 HOURS OF RECEIVING NOTICE OF SUCH INJURY OR DAMAGE, OR THE CLAIM OF SUCH
 INJURY OR DAMAGE.

 LIABILITY  INSURANCE  COVERAGE  REQUIRED  BY THIS SECTION, AND NO PERSON
 SHALL OPERATE A MOTORIZED SCOOTER ANYWHERE IN THIS STATE OTHER  THAN  ON
 LANDS OF THE OWNER OF THE MOTORIZED SCOOTER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH
