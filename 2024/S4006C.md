  b. Aid for career education. There shall be apportioned to  such  city
 school districts and other school districts which were not components of
 a  board of cooperative educational services in the base year for pupils
 in grades [ten] NINE through twelve in attendance  in  career  education
 programs  as  such programs are defined by the commissioner, subject for
 the purposes of this paragraph to the approval of the  director  of  the
 budget,  an amount for each such pupil to be computed by multiplying the
 career education aid ratio by three thousand nine hundred dollars.  Such
 aid  will  be  payable  for  weighted  pupils attending career education
 S. 4006--B  31
 
 programs operated by the school district and  for  weighted  pupils  for
 whom  such  school  district contracts with boards of cooperative educa-
 tional services to attend career education programs operated by a  board
 of cooperative educational services. Weighted pupils for the purposes of
 this  paragraph  shall  mean  the  sum  of the attendance of students in
 grades [ten] NINE through twelve in career education sequences in trade,
 industrial, technical, agricultural or health programs plus the  product
 of sixteen hundredths multiplied by the attendance of students in grades
 [ten]  NINE through twelve in career education sequences in business and
 marketing as defined by the  commissioner  in  regulations.  The  career
 education  aid ratio shall be computed by subtracting from one the prod-
 uct obtained by multiplying fifty-nine percent by  the  combined  wealth
 ratio.  This  aid ratio shall be expressed as a decimal carried to three
 places without rounding, but not less than thirty-six percent.
  Any school district that receives aid pursuant to this paragraph shall
 be required to use such amount to support career education  programs  in
 the current year.
  A board of education which spends less than its local funds as defined
 by regulations of the commissioner for career education in the base year
 during the current year shall have its apportionment under this subdivi-
 sion  reduced  in an amount equal to such deficiency in the current or a
 succeeding school year, provided however that the commissioner may waive
 such reduction upon determination that overall expenditures per pupil in
 support of career education programs were continued at a level equal  to
 or  greater than the level of such overall expenditures per pupil in the
 preceding school year.
  § 13. Subdivision 6-a of section 3641 of the education law,  as  added
 by section 16 of part A of chapter 57 of the laws of 2013, is amended to

  (2)  In  assessing  proposal quality, the commissioner shall take into
 account factors including, but not limited to:
  (i) The extent to which the school district's proposal  would  provide
 such  community services through partnerships with local governments and
 non-profit organizations;
  (ii) The extent to which the proposal would provide  for  delivery  of
 such services directly in school buildings;
  (iii)  The  extent to which the proposal articulates how such services
 would facilitate measurable improvement in student and family outcomes;
  (iv) The extent to which the proposal articulates and  identifies  how
 existing  funding  streams  and  programs  would be used to provide such
 community services; and
  (v) the extent to  which  the  proposal  ensures  the  safety  of  all
 students, staff and community members in school buildings used as commu-
 nity hubs.
  b.  A  response  to  a  request  for proposals issued pursuant to this
 subdivision may be submitted by a single school district or jointly by a
 consortium of two or more school districts, or in a city  with  a  popu-
 lation of one million or more, an eligible entity.

 than forty percent of the total amount of grant awards made pursuant  to
 this  subdivision;  and  provided  further that the maximum award to any
 individual community school site shall be five hundred thousand dollars;
 and provided further that the amount awarded will be  paid  out  in  set
 percentages  over time upon successful implementation of each phase of a
 school district's approved proposal set forth pursuant to paragraph a of
 this subdivision; and provided further that none of the  grants  awarded
 pursuant  to this subdivision may be used to supplant existing funding.]

 § 1509. Disqualification  of  shareholders,  directors,  officers  and
  employees.
  If  any  shareholder,  director, officer or employee of a professional
 service corporation, including  a  design  professional  service  corpo-
 ration,  who  has  been  rendering  professional  service  to the public
 becomes legally disqualified to practice his OR  HER  profession  within
 this  state,  he  OR  SHE shall sever all employment with, and financial
 interests (other than interests as  a  creditor)  in,  such  corporation
 forthwith  or as otherwise provided in section 1510 of this article. All
 provisions of law regulating the rendering of professional services by a
 person elected or appointed to a public office shall be applicable to  a
 shareholder,  director,  officer and employee of such corporation in the
 same manner and to the same extent as if fully set  forth  herein.  Such
 legal  disqualification  to  practice  his OR HER profession within this
 state shall be deemed to constitute an irrevocable offer by the disqual-
 ified shareholder to sell his OR HER shares to the corporation, pursuant
 to the provisions of section 1510 of this article or of the  certificate
 of  incorporation,  by-laws  or  agreement among the corporation and all
 shareholders, whichever is applicable. Compliance with the terms of such
 offer shall be specifically enforceable in the courts of this  state.  A

 this provision shall constitute a ground for forfeiture of  its  certif-
 icate of incorporation and its dissolution.
  § 5. Paragraph (a) of section 1511 of the business corporation law, as

 ING a design professional service corporation, may sell or transfer  his
 OR  HER  shares  in such corporation except to another individual who is
 eligible to have shares issued to him OR  HER  by  such  corporation  or
 except  in  trust to another individual who would be eligible to receive
 shares if he OR SHE were employed by  the  corporation.  Nothing  herein
 contained shall be construed to prohibit the transfer of shares by oper-
 ation  of  law or by court decree.  No transferee of shares by operation
 of law or court decree may vote the shares for  any  purpose  whatsoever
 except  with  respect to corporate action under sections 909 and 1001 of
 this chapter. The restriction in the preceding sentence shall not apply,
 however, where such transferee would be eligible to have  shares  issued
 to  him  OR HER if he OR SHE were an employee of the corporation and, if
 there are other shareholders, a  majority  of  such  other  shareholders
 shall fail to redeem the shares so transferred, pursuant to section 1510
 of  this  article, within sixty days of receiving written notice of such
 transfer. Any sale or transfer, except by  operation  of  law  or  court
 decree  or  except for a corporation having only one shareholder, may be
 made only after the same shall have been approved by the board of direc-
 tors, or at a shareholders' meeting specially called for such purpose by
 such proportion, not less than a majority, of the outstanding shares  as
 may be provided in the certificate of incorporation or in the by-laws of
 such professional service corporation. At such shareholders' meeting the
 shares  held by the shareholder proposing to sell or transfer his OR HER
 shares may not be voted or counted for any purpose,  unless  all  share-
 holders consent that such shares be voted or counted. The certificate of
 incorporation or the by-laws of the professional service corporation, or
 the  professional  service  corporation  and the shareholders by private
 agreement, may provide, in lieu of  or  in  addition  to  the  foregoing
 provisions,  for the alienation of shares and may require the redemption
 S. 4006--B  38

 or purchase of such shares by such corporation at prices and in a manner
 specifically set forth therein. The existence of the restrictions on the
 sale or transfer of shares, as contained in this article and, if  appli-
 cable,  in  the certificate of incorporation, by-laws, stock purchase or
 stock redemption agreement, shall be noted conspicuously on the face  or
 back  of  every  certificate for shares issued by a professional service
 corporation. Any sale or transfer  in  violation  of  such  restrictions
 shall be void.
  (C)  A FIRM ESTABLISHED FOR THE BUSINESS PURPOSE OF INCORPORATING AS A
 PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CORPORATION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH  (H)  OF  SECTION
 1503  OF  THIS ARTICLE, SHALL PURCHASE OR REDEEM THE SHARES OF A NON-LI-
 CENSED PROFESSIONAL SHAREHOLDER IN THE CASE OF HIS OR HER TERMINATION OF
 EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER SUCH TERMINATION.  A  FIRM  ESTAB-
 LISHED  FOR  THE  BUSINESS  PURPOSE  OF  INCORPORATING AS A PROFESSIONAL
 SERVICE CORPORATION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (H) OF SECTION  1503  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE,  SHALL  NOT  BE  REQUIRED TO PURCHASE OR REDEEM THE SHARES OF A

  2. HOUSING IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE
 NATION.  THE  EXCESSIVE  COST OF THE STATE'S HOUSING SUPPLY IS PARTIALLY
 CAUSED BY A LACK OF NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION  DUE  TO  THE  PREVALENCE  OF
 LOCAL  GOVERNMENTAL  LAND  USE POLICIES THAT LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
 AND PLACE PROCEDURAL IMPEDIMENTS ON THE APPROVAL OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS
 AND THEREBY INCREASE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND RESTRICT THE HOUSING SUPPLY.
  3. LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL LIMITATIONS ON AND BARRIERS TO HOUSING  DEVELOP-
 MENT  ARE  ESPECIALLY COMMON FOR MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, WHICH
 CONSTRAINS THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE  HOUSING  THAT  OFTEN
 REQUIRE MULTI-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT TO BE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE.
  4.  AMONG  THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PREVALENCE OF LOCAL RESTRICTIONS ON
 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ARE  THE  LACK  OF  HOUSING  TO  SUPPORT  EMPLOYMENT
 GROWTH;  IMBALANCE IN NUMBER OF JOBS AND HOUSING SUPPLY, WITH THE FORMER
 OUTSTRIPPING THE LATTER; SPRAWL; EXCESSIVE COMMUTING; AND THE  POTENTIAL
 FOR  DISCRIMINATION  AGAINST  LOW-INCOME  AND  MINORITY  HOUSEHOLDS  WHO
 DISPROPORTIONATELY REQUIRE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES.
  5. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT GIVE ADEQUATE ATTENTION TO THE  LOCAL
 AND  BROADER REGIONAL ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL COSTS OF LOCAL
 POLICIES AND ACTIONS THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF STAGNATING OR REDUCING  THE
 SUPPLY  OF  HOUSING, INCLUDING AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, OR HOW
 SUCH POLICIES AND ACTIONS THEREBY PRODUCE THREATS TO THE PUBLIC  HEALTH,
 SAFETY, AND GENERAL WELFARE.
  6. ADDITIONALLY, MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT GIVE ADEQUATE ATTENTION
 TO  THE  LOCAL  AND BROADER REGIONAL ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL
 COSTS OF LOCAL POLICIES AND ACTIONS THAT RESULT IN DISAPPROVALS OR INHI-
 BITION OF PROPOSALS FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WOULD  BENEFIT
 THE  PUBLIC  HEALTH, SAFETY, AND GENERAL WELFARE; A REDUCTION IN DENSITY
 OF SUCH HOUSING PROJECTS; AND CREATION OF EXCESSIVE LAND USE  AND  OTHER
 BARRIERS FOR SUCH HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO BE BUILT.
  7.  LEGISLATION  IS  NECESSARY TO FORESTALL RESTRICTIVE LAND USE PRAC-
 TICES THAT INHIBIT AND LIMIT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, AND TO FORESTALL UNDUE
 LOCAL DISAPPROVALS OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY  AFFORDA-
 BLE  AND  SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, GIVEN THAT SUCH PRACTICES AND DISAPPROVALS
 PRODUCE THREATS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY, AND GENERAL WELFARE.
  8. THE STATE OF NEW YORK  MUST  ENSURE  THAT  LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS  GIVE
 ADEQUATE  ATTENTION TO THE LOCAL AND BROADER REGIONAL ECONOMIC, ENVIRON-
 MENTAL, AND SOCIAL COSTS OF LAND USE ZONING AND  PLANNING  POLICIES  AND
 ACTIONS,  AS  WELL  AS  THE DENIAL OF APPLICATIONS TO BUILD NEW HOUSING,
 WHICH COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY MAY RESULT IN A DEARTH OF  APPROPRI-
 ATE  HOUSING  TO  MEET  THE  NEEDS  OF ALL RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY OR
 REGION.
  9. IN FURTHERANCE OF OVERALL HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS AND  TO  PROMOTE
 THE  GREATEST  EFFICIENCY AND COORDINATED DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OF LOCALI-
 TIES WITHIN THE STATE, IT IS BOTH A MATTER  OF  STATE  CONCERN  AND  THE
 POLICY  OF THE STATE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ADDRESS THEIR LAND USE POLI-
 CIES, PRACTICES, AND DECISIONS THAT MAKE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS, AND ESPE-
 CIALLY MULTI-FAMILY, AFFORDABLE, AND  SUPPORTIVE  HOUSING  DEVELOPMENTS,
 IMPOSSIBLE OR INFEASIBLE.

  G.  ANY HEALTH OR SAFETY REQUIREMENTS ON ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS THAT
 ARE NOT  NECESSARY  TO  PROTECT  HEALTH  AND  SAFETY.  NOTHING  IN  THIS
 PROVISION  SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO PREVENT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM REQUIR-
 ING THAT ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ARE, WHERE  APPLICABLE,  SUPPORTED  BY
 SEPTIC  CAPACITY  NECESSARY  TO  MEET  STATE HEALTH, SAFETY AND SANITARY
 STANDARDS, THAT THE CREATION OF SUCH ACCESSORY DWELLING  UNITS  COMPORTS
 WITH  FLOOD  RESILIENCY  POLICIES  OR  EFFORTS,  AND THAT SUCH ACCESSORY
 DWELLING UNITS ARE  CONSISTENT  WITH  THE  PROTECTION  OF  WETLANDS  AND
 WATERSHEDS; OR
  H. ANY REQUIREMENT FOR OWNER OCCUPANCY IN EITHER THE PRIMARY OR ACCES-

  (IV)  NO PARKING REQUIREMENT SHALL BE IMPOSED ON AN ACCESSORY DWELLING
 UNIT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WHERE NO ADJACENT  PUBLIC  STREET  PERMITS
 YEAR-ROUND  ON-STREET PARKING AND THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT IS GREATER
 THAN ONE-HALF MILE FROM ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, A LOCAL GOVERN-
 MENT MAY REQUIRE UP TO ONE OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE PER ACCESSORY UNIT.
  (V) A LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT REQUIRE THAT OFF-STREET PARKING SPAC-
 ES BE REPLACED IF A GARAGE, CARPORT, OR  COVERED  PARKING  STRUCTURE  IS
 DEMOLISHED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ACCESSORY DWELLING
 UNIT OR CONVERTED TO AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT.
  (VI)  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  LOCAL LAW, ORDINANCE, RESOLUTION, OR REGU-
 LATIONS, A PERMIT APPLICATION TO CREATE AN ACCESSORY  DWELLING  UNIT  IN
 CONFORMANCE WITH A LOCAL LAW ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE
 CONSIDERED  MINISTERIALLY, WITHOUT DISCRETIONARY REVIEW OR A HEARING. IF
 THERE IS AN EXISTING SINGLE-FAMILY OR MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL  DWELLING
 UNIT ON THE LOT, THE PERMITTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL ACT ON THE APPLI-
 CATION  TO CREATE AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT WITHIN NINETY DAYS FROM THE
 DATE THE LOCAL AGENCY RECEIVES A COMPLETED APPLICATION OR,  IN  A  LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT  HAVING  A  POPULATION  OF  ONE MILLION OR MORE, WITHIN SIXTY
 DAYS. IF THE PERMIT APPLICATION TO CREATE AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT  IS
 SUBMITTED  WITH A PERMIT APPLICATION TO CREATE A NEW PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL
 DWELLING UNIT ON THE LOT, THE  PERMITTING  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  MAY  DELAY
 ACTING  ON  THE PERMIT APPLICATION FOR THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT UNTIL
 THE PERMITTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTS ON THE PERMIT APPLICATION TO CREATE
 THE NEW PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL DWELLING UNIT, BUT THE APPLICATION TO CREATE
 THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT SHALL BE  CONSIDERED  WITHOUT  DISCRETIONARY
 REVIEW  OR  HEARING.  IF THE APPLICANT REQUESTS A DELAY, THE TIME PERIOD
 FOR REVIEW SHALL BE TOLLED FOR THE PERIOD  OF  THE  DELAY.  SUCH  REVIEW
 SHALL  INCLUDE  ALL  NECESSARY  PERMITS AND APPROVALS INCLUDING, WITHOUT

 TION, OR DETERMINATION ISSUED UNDER THE LOCAL LAW  ADOPTED  PURSUANT  TO
 THIS  PARAGRAPH  AND  DECIDING THE MATTER FROM WHICH ANY SUCH APPEAL WAS
 TAKEN. WHEN A PERMIT TO CREATE AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT PURSUANT TO  A
 LOCAL LAW ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH IS DENIED, THE LOCAL AGENCY
 THAT  DENIED  THE  PERMIT  SHALL  ISSUE  A  NOTICE OF DENIAL WHICH SHALL
 CONTAIN THE REASON OR REASONS SUCH PERMIT  APPLICATION  WAS  DENIED  AND
 INSTRUCTIONS  ON  HOW  THE APPLICANT MAY APPEAL SUCH DENIAL. SUCH NOTICE
 S. 4006--B  52
 
 SHALL BE MADE PART OF THE  RECORD  OF  APPEALS.  ALL  APPEALS  SHALL  BE

 TERIAL APPROVAL OF A PERMIT APPLICATION FOR THE CREATION OF AN ACCESSORY
 DWELLING  UNIT,  THE  CORRECTION  OF  NONCONFORMING  ZONING  CONDITIONS,
 NONCOMPLYING  ZONING  CONDITIONS, OR OTHER MINOR VIOLATIONS OF ANY LOCAL
 LAW.
  (X) WHERE AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT REQUIRES A NEW OR SEPARATE UTILI-
 TY CONNECTION DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT AND THE UTIL-
 ITY, THE CONNECTION MAY BE SUBJECT  TO  A  CONNECTION  FEE  OR  CAPACITY
 CHARGE  THAT SHALL BE PROPORTIONATE TO THE BURDEN OF THE PROPOSED ACCES-
 SORY DWELLING UNIT, BASED UPON EITHER ITS SIZE  OR  THE  NUMBER  OF  ITS
 PLUMBING  FIXTURES  UPON  THE  WATER OR SEWER SYSTEM. SUCH FEE OR CHARGE
 SHALL  NOT  EXCEED  THE  REASONABLE  COST  OF  PROVIDING  SUCH  UTILITY
 CONNECTION.  A  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  SHALL  NOT  IMPOSE  ANY  OTHER FEE IN
 CONNECTION WITH AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT.

 as  amended  by  chapter  806 of the laws of 1972, is amended to read as
 follows:
  11. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following
 enumerated articles, sections and subdivisions of sections of this chap-
 ter shall not apply to the construction or alteration of multiple dwell-
 ings for which an application for a permit is  made  to  the  department
 after  December  sixth,  nineteen  hundred sixty-nine in a city having a

 laws,  ordinances,  resolutions or regulations providing protection from
 fire  hazards  and  making  provision  for  escape  from  fire  in  the
 construction  and alteration of multiple dwellings and in other respects
 as protective as local law seventy-six of the laws of the  city  of  New
 York  for  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight  and covering the same subject
 matter as the following]: subdivisions twenty-five, twenty-seven,  twen-
 ty-eight,  thirty-five-c,  thirty-six  and  thirty-nine of section four,
 subdivision three of section twenty-eight, sections thirty-six,  thirty-
 seven,  fifty,  fifty-one,  fifty-two,  fifty-three,  fifty-five, sixty,
 sixty-one, sixty-seven, subdivisions one, two, four and five of  section
 seventy-five,  article four, article five, article five-A[,] AND article
 six [and article seven-B]; except that after  December  sixth,  nineteen
 hundred  sixty-nine  where a multiple dwelling erected prior to December
 sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine is altered,  or  a  building  erected
 prior  to  December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine is converted to a
 multiple dwelling pursuant to a permit applied  for  to  the  department
 having  jurisdiction,  the foregoing articles, sections and subdivisions
 of sections shall remain applicable where  a  local  law  of  such  city
 authorizes  such  alteration  or conversion to be made, at the option of
 the owner, either in accordance with the requirements  of  the  building
 law  and  regulations  in  effect  in such city prior to December sixth,
 nineteen hundred sixty-eight or the requirements of the building law and
 regulations in effect after such date, and the owner  elects  to  comply

  § 2. Section 275 of the multiple dwelling law, as added by chapter 734
 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  § 275. Legislative findings. It is hereby declared and found  that  in
 cities  with  a  population  in  excess of one million, large numbers of
 loft, manufacturing, commercial,  institutional,  public  and  community
 facility  buildings  have  lost,  and continue to lose, their tenants to
 more modern premises; and that the untenanted portions of such buildings
 constitute a potential housing stock within such cities which  is  capa-
 S. 4006--B  69
 
 ble,  when  appropriately  altered, of accommodating general residential
 use, thereby contributing to an alleviation of the housing shortage most
 severely affecting moderate and middle income families, and of  accommo-
 dating  joint  living-work quarters for artists by making readily avail-
 able space which is physically and  economically  suitable  for  use  by
 persons regularly engaged in the arts.
  There is a public purpose to be served by making accommodations readi-
 ly  available for joint living-work quarters for artists for the follow-
 ing reasons:  persons regularly engaged  in  the  arts  require  larger
 amounts of space for the pursuit of their artistic endeavors and for the
 storage  of  the materials therefor and of the products thereof than are
 regularly to be found in dwellings subject to  this  article;  that  the
 financial  remunerations  to be obtained from pursuit of a career in the
 arts are generally small; that as a result  of  such  limited  financial
 remuneration  persons  regularly  engaged  in the arts generally find it
 financially impossible to maintain quarters for  the  pursuit  of  their
 artistic  endeavors  separate  and apart from their places of residence;
 that the cultural life of cities of more than one million persons within
 this state and of the state as a whole is enhanced by the  residence  in
 such  cities  of large numbers of persons regularly engaged in the arts;
 that the high cost of land within  such  cities  makes  it  particularly
 difficult for persons regularly engaged in the arts to obtain the use of
 the  amounts of space required for their work as aforesaid; and that the
 residential use of the space is secondary or accessory  to  the  primary
 use as a place of work.
  It  is  further declared that the legislation governing the alteration
 of such buildings to accommodate general residential use must of  neces-
 sity  be  more  restrictive  than  statutes  heretofore in effect, which
 affected only joint living-work quarters for artists.
  It is the intention of this legislation to promulgate statewide  mini-
 mum  standards for all alterations of non-residential buildings to resi-
 dential use, but the legislature is  cognizant  that  the  use  of  such
 buildings  for residential purposes must be consistent with local zoning
 ordinances. The legislature further recognizes that it is  the  role  of
 localities  to adopt regulations which will define in further detail the
 manner in which alterations should be carried out where  building  types
 and  conditions  are  peculiar  to their local environment. IT IS HEREBY
 ADDITIONALLY DECLARED AND FOUND THAT IN  CITIES  WITH  A  POPULATION  IN
 EXCESS  OF ONE MILLION, LARGE NUMBERS OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS HAVE LOST,
 AND CONTINUE TO LOSE, THEIR TENANTS TO MORE MODERN PREMISES AND  TO  THE
 CHANGING  NATURE  OF  REMOTE  OFFICE  WORK  IN  THE WAKE OF THE COVID-19
 PANDEMIC; AND THAT THE UNTENANTED PORTIONS OF SUCH BUILDINGS  CONSTITUTE
 A  POTENTIAL  HOUSING  STOCK  WITHIN  SUCH CITIES WHICH IS CAPABLE, WHEN
 APPROPRIATELY ALTERED, OF ACCOMMODATING GENERAL RESIDENTIAL USE, THEREBY
 CONTRIBUTING TO AN ALLEVIATION OF THE HOUSING SHORTAGE.
  § 3. Section 276 of the multiple dwelling law, as amended  by  chapter
 420 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:

 department  of  cultural  affairs  and/or state council on the arts. For
 joint living-work quarters for artists limited to artists' occupancy  by

 tial purposes, as such term is defined in article 7-B  of  the  multiple
 dwelling law, permitted prior to such repeal.
 
  SUBPART B

 REASONABLE  IN  COMPARISON  WITH  RENTS  CHARGED FOR COMPARABLE DWELLING
 UNITS IN THE PRIVATE, UNASSISTED LOCAL MARKET.

 PROVIDED IN SECTION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE) MAY,  AT  THE
 REQUEST OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS ARTI-
 CLE,  ASSIST  THAT INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY IN NEGOTIATING A REASONABLE RENT

 (OR OTHER SUCH ENTITY) SHALL REVIEW THE RENT FOR A UNIT UNDER  CONSIDER-
 ATION  BY  THE  INDIVIDUAL  OR  FAMILY (AND ALL RENT INCREASES FOR UNITS
 UNDER LEASE BY THE INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY) TO DETERMINE WHETHER  THE  RENT
 (OR  RENT  INCREASE)  REQUESTED BY THE OWNER IS REASONABLE. IF A HOUSING
 ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR (OR  OTHER  SUCH  ENTITY)  DETERMINES
 THAT  THE RENT (OR RENT INCREASE) FOR A DWELLING UNIT IS NOT REASONABLE,

 FOR  WHICH  RENTAL  ASSISTANCE  IS  PROVIDED  UNDER A HOUSING ASSISTANCE
 PAYMENT CONTRACT BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF THE LEASE FOR  THE
 UNIT,  RENTAL  ASSISTANCE  PURSUANT TO SUCH CONTRACT MAY NOT BE PROVIDED
 FOR THE UNIT AFTER THE MONTH DURING WHICH THE UNIT WAS VACATED.
  § 617. LEASING OF UNITS OWNED BY A HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMIN-
 ISTRATOR. 1. IF AN ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL OR  FAMILY  ASSISTED  UNDER  THIS
 ARTICLE  LEASES  A  DWELLING  UNIT (OTHER THAN A PUBLIC HOUSING DWELLING
 UNIT) THAT IS OWNED BY A  HOUSING  ACCESS  VOUCHER  LOCAL  ADMINISTRATOR
 ADMINISTERING  ASSISTANCE  TO  THAT  INDIVIDUAL  OR  FAMILY  UNDER  THIS

 GOVERNMENT  OR  ANOTHER  ENTITY  APPROVED  BY  THE COMMISSIONER, TO MAKE
 INSPECTIONS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION SIX HUNDRED FOURTEEN OF THIS  ARTICLE
 AND  RENT  DETERMINATIONS  REQUIRED UNDER SECTION SIX HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF

 RESPONSIBLE  FOR  ANY  EXPENSES  OF SUCH INSPECTIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,
 SUBJECT TO THE APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE.
  2. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM "OWNED BY A  HOUSING  ACCESS

 TOR, BY AN ENTITY WHOLLY CONTROLLED  BY  SUCH  ADMINISTRATOR,  OR  BY  A
 LIMITED  LIABILITY COMPANY OR LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH SUCH ADMINIS-
 TRATOR (OR AN ENTITY WHOLLY CONTROLLED BY SUCH  ADMINISTRATOR)  HOLDS  A
 CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE MANAGING MEMBER OR GENERAL PARTNER. A DWELL-
 ING  UNIT  SHALL  NOT  BE DEEMED TO BE OWNED BY A HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER
 LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION BECAUSE  SUCH  ADMINIS-
 TRATOR  HOLDS  A  FEE INTEREST AS GROUND LESSOR IN THE PROPERTY ON WHICH
 THE UNIT IS SITUATED, HOLDS A SECURITY INTEREST UNDER A MORTGAGE OR DEED
 OF TRUST ON THE UNIT, OR HOLDS A NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN  AN  ENTITY
 S. 4006--B  102
 
 WHICH  OWNS  THE UNIT OR IN THE MANAGING MEMBER OR GENERAL PARTNER OF AN
 ENTITY WHICH OWNS THE UNIT.
  § 618. VERIFICATION OF INCOME. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH PROCE-
 DURES  WHICH  ARE  APPROPRIATE  AND NECESSARY TO ASSURE THAT INCOME DATA
 PROVIDED TO THE HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR AND OWNERS BY
 INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES APPLYING FOR OR RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS
 ARTICLE IS COMPLETE AND ACCURATE. IN ESTABLISHING SUCH  PROCEDURES,  THE
 COMMISSIONER SHALL RANDOMLY, REGULARLY, AND PERIODICALLY SELECT A SAMPLE
 OF FAMILIES TO AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSIONER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THESE
 FAMILIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCOME VERIFICATION, OR TO ALLOW THOSE FAMI-
 LIES  TO  PROVIDE  SUCH  INFORMATION  THEMSELVES.  SUCH  INFORMATION MAY
 INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO,  DATA  CONCERNING  UNEMPLOYMENT  COMPEN-
 SATION  AND  FEDERAL  INCOME TAXATION AND DATA RELATING TO BENEFITS MADE
 AVAILABLE UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, 42 U.S.C. 301 ET SEQ., THE FOOD
 AND NUTRITION ACT OF 2008, 7 U.S.C. 2011 ET SEQ., OR  TITLE  38  OF  THE

 AND  FAMILIES  FOR  BENEFITS  (AND  THE AMOUNT OF SUCH BENEFITS, IF ANY)
 UNDER THIS ARTICLE.
  § 619. DIVISION OF AN ASSISTED FAMILY. 1. IN THOSE INSTANCES  WHERE  A
 FAMILY  ASSISTED  UNDER  THIS ARTICLE BECOMES DIVIDED INTO TWO OTHERWISE
 ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES DUE TO DIVORCE, LEGAL SEPARATION OR THE
 DIVISION OF THE FAMILY, WHERE SUCH INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES CANNOT  AGREE
 AS  TO  WHICH  SUCH  INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY SHOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE
 ASSISTANCE, AND WHERE THERE IS NO DETERMINATION BY A COURT, THE  HOUSING
 ACCESS  VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR SHALL CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS
 TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES WILL  CONTINUE  TO  BE
 ASSISTED:
  (A)  WHICH  OF  SUCH  INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES HAS CUSTODY OF DEPENDENT
 CHILDREN;
  (B) WHICH SUCH INDIVIDUAL WAS THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD WHEN  THE  VOUCHER
 WAS INITIALLY ISSUED AS LISTED ON THE INITIAL APPLICATION;
  (C)  THE  COMPOSITION  OF SUCH INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AND WHICH SUCH
 FAMILY INCLUDES ELDERLY OR DISABLED MEMBERS;
  (D) WHETHER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS INVOLVED  IN  THE  BREAKUP  OF  SUCH
 FAMILY;
  (E) WHICH FAMILY MEMBERS REMAIN IN THE UNIT; AND
  (F) RECOMMENDATIONS OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROFESSIONALS.
  2.  DOCUMENTATION  OF  THESE FACTORS WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
 REQUESTING PARTIES. IF DOCUMENTATION IS NOT PROVIDED, THE HOUSING ACCESS
 VOUCHER LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR WILL TERMINATE ASSISTANCE ON  THE  BASIS  OF
 FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR A RECERTIFICATION.
  § 620. MAINTENANCE  OF  EFFORT.  ANY  FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO
 THIS ARTICLE SHALL NOT BE USED TO OFFSET OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT  OF  FUNDS
 PREVIOUSLY  EXPENDED FOR THE SAME OR SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN A PRIOR YEAR IN
 ANY COUNTY OR IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, BUT SHALL BE USED  TO  SUPPLEMENT
 ANY  PRIOR  YEAR'S EXPENDITURES. THE COMMISSIONER MAY GRANT AN EXCEPTION
 TO THIS REQUIREMENT IF ANY COUNTY, MUNICIPALITY, OR  OTHER  GOVERNMENTAL
 ENTITY  OR  PUBLIC BODY CAN AFFIRMATIVELY SHOW THAT SUCH AMOUNT OF FUNDS
 PREVIOUSLY EXPENDED IS IN EXCESS OF  THE  AMOUNT  NECESSARY  TO  PROVIDE
 ASSISTANCE  TO ALL INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITHIN THE AREA IN WHICH THE
 FUNDS WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPENDED WHO ARE HOMELESS OR  FACING  AN  IMMINENT
 LOSS OF HOUSING.
  § 621. VOUCHERS  STATEWIDE. NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION SIX HUNDRED ELEVEN

 S. 4006--B  103
 
 FOR HOUSING ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL INFORM VOUCHER
 HOLDERS THAT A VOUCHER MAY BE USED ANYWHERE IN THE  STATE  AND,  TO  THE
 EXTENT  PRACTICABLE,  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL ASSIST VOUCHER HOLDERS IN
 FINDING HOUSING IN THE AREA OF THEIR CHOICE.  PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER,
 THAT  A  VOUCHER  MUST  BE USED IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH IT WAS ISSUED, OR
 WITHIN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, IF THE VOUCHER WAS ISSUED WITHIN  THE  CITY
 OF  NEW  YORK,  FOR  NO  LESS  THAN  ONE YEAR BEFORE IT CAN BE USED IN A
 DIFFERENT JURISDICTION, UNLESS THE ISSUING HOUSING ACCESS VOUCHER  LOCAL
 ADMINISTRATOR GRANTS A WAIVER, OR THE VOUCHER HOLDER, OR A FAMILY MEMBER
 THEREOF,  IS  OR  HAS  BEEN  THE  VICTIM  OF  DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE, DATING
 VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, OR STALKING.

  PART PP
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  State  University  of New York
 ("SUNY") has committed to becoming the most inclusive university  system
 in  the country, where all students, faculty, and staff feel welcome and
 supported. To meet this goal, SUNY must employ, in addition  to  faculty
 and  staff,  leaders  at the highest levels who share common experiences
 and culture with those who comprise the fastest-growing segment  of  its
 student  population:  diverse students who will become the nation's next
 generation of leaders.
  SUNY has seen a steady increase of Black  students  in  recent  years,
 reaching  nearly  11  percent, or over 42,000 students, in the 2019-2020
 academic year. While SUNY continues its efforts to  ensure  that  campus
 leadership and faculty reflect the students they serve by hiring faculty
 S. 4006--B  116
 
 who  are  more  representative of the diverse student population at SUNY
 campuses, the  diversity  within  executive  leadership  teams  on  many
 campuses can be expanded further with support from the legislature.
  It  is,  therefore, the intention of the legislature to create a Black
 Leadership Institute ("the Institute") as an initiative for Black  lead-
 ers  in  higher  education with a mission to retain and grow from within
 SUNY a greater proportion of Black professionals at SUNY  campuses.  The
 Institute  shall  offer  support and foster professional development for
 candidates for senior leadership roles on SUNY campuses, which will,  in
 turn,  create a more diverse SUNY culture that represents New York state
 and the SUNY student population.
  The legislature further intends that the Institute would  be  designed
 to  open doors to executive-level positions and strengthen the Universi-
 ty's pool of Black leaders. The Institute will  identify,  develop,  and
 recruit, and ultimately support, retain, and foster the success of Black
 leaders across the SUNY system.
  §  2. The education law is amended by adding a new section 362 to read
 as follows:
  § 362. BLACK LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE. 1.  SUBJECT TO AN APPROPRIATION FOR
 THIS PURPOSE, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY  OF  NEW  YORK,  IN
 CONSULTATION  WITH  THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW
 YORK, SHALL CREATE A BLACK LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE WITHIN THE STATE UNIVER-
 SITY OF NEW YORK TO FOSTER THE SUCCESS OF BLACK LEADERS AT THE UNIVERSI-
 TY PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT'S CABINET LEVEL. SUCH INSTITUTE SHALL DEVELOP
 CANDIDATE  IDENTIFICATION  AND  RECRUITMENT  EFFORTS,  SEARCH  COMMITTEE
 TRAINING,  PROFESSIONAL  DEVELOPMENT AND INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT MEASURES
 FOR  INSTITUTE  PARTICIPANTS,  PROFESSIONAL  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAMMING,
 SERVICES, RESEARCH AND RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION ACTIVITIES, AND ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS DEEMED NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS INSTITUTE.
  2.  THE  CHANCELLOR  SHALL  APPOINT AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND AN EIGHT
 MEMBER ADVISORY COUNCIL, TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND ADVICE TO  FURTHER  THE
 DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF THE INSTITUTE. THE DIRECTOR AND THE MEMBERS OF
 THE ADVISORY COUNCIL SHALL SERVE FOR THREE-YEAR TERMS, WITH THE DIRECTOR
 AND  THREE  ADVISORY  COUNCIL MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE
 INSTITUTE'S EXISTENCE, THREE OTHER MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE SECOND YEAR,
 AND TWO MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE THIRD YEAR. THE DIRECTOR  AND  ADVISORY
 COUNCIL MEMBERS MAY BE REAPPOINTED AT THE END OF EACH TERM IN THE MANNER
 OF  THE  ORIGINAL  APPOINTMENT.  THE DIRECTOR AND ADVISORY COUNCIL SHALL
 RECEIVE NO COMPENSATION FOR THEIR WORK IN CONJUNCTION  WITH  THE  INSTI-
 TUTE.
  3.  IN  CONSIDERING  MEASURES  AND  PROGRAMMING  FOR  EFFECTUATING THE
 PURPOSE OF THE INSTITUTE, THE INSTITUTE SHALL CONSIDER SUCH  FACTORS  AS
 PROGRAM  COST-EFFECTIVENESS;  THE  ABILITY  OF  SUCH  PROGRAMS  TO OFFER
 PROGRAMMATICALLY APPROPRIATE, LONG-TERM, TRAINING, AND SUPPORT SERVICES;
 THE ABILITY OF SUCH PROGRAMS TO ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
 INSTITUTE TO RECEIVE REWARDING TRAINING,  SERVICES,  AND  SUPPORTS;  AND
 CURRENT  AND  PROJECTED  EMPLOYMENT  DATA  AT  CAMPUSES WITHIN THE STATE
 UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.
  4. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHALL PREPARE AND PRESENT TO  THE  GOVERNOR,
 THE  SPEAKER  OF  THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE AT
 THE BEGINNING OF EACH REGULAR SESSION  OF  THE  LEGISLATURE  A  SEPARATE
 REPORT  COVERING,  IN  SUMMARY, AND IN DETAIL, ALL PHASES OF ACTIVITY OF
 THE INSTITUTE FOR THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR.

 aid  or assistance received which]. MARITIME ADMISSIONS SCHOLARSHIPS may
 be used towards EDUCATIONAL costs other than that of tuition  [shall  be
 applied toward the cost of tuition].
