 in  a  city with a population in excess of 125,000 inhabitants, with the
 approval of the mayor of such city.
  2. The claim for an apportionment to be  paid  to  a  school  district

 law,  on  the  audit  and  warrant  of the state comptroller on vouchers
 certified or approved by the commissioner of  education  in  the  manner
 prescribed  by  law  from  moneys in the state lottery fund and from the
 general fund to the extent that the amount paid  to  a  school  district
 pursuant  to  this  section  exceeds the amount, if any, due such school
 district pursuant to subparagraph 2 of paragraph a of subdivision  1  of
 section  3609-a  of  the  education law in the school year following the
 year in which application was made.
  3. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3609-a of  the  education
 law, an amount equal to the amount paid to a school district pursuant to
 subdivisions  1  and  2 of this section shall first be deducted from the
 following payments due  the  school  district  during  the  school  year
 following  the  year  in which application was made pursuant to subpara-
 graphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of paragraph  a  of  subdivision  1  of  section

 with this subdivision, notwithstanding any inconsistency with a  request
 for  proposals issued by such commissioner for the purpose of attendance
 improvement and dropout prevention for the 2023--2024 school  year,  and
 for  any city school district in a city having a population of more than
 one million,  the  set-aside  for  attendance  improvement  and  dropout

 2023--2024 school year, it is further  provided  that  any  city  school
 district  in  a  city having a population of more than one million shall
 allocate at least one-third of any increase from  base  year  levels  in

 provided to community-based organizations in the base year.

 including  prekindergarten teachers and teachers of adult vocational and
 academic subjects in accordance with this section and shall be in  addi-
 tion  to  salaries heretofore or hereafter negotiated or made available;
 provided, however, that all funds distributed pursuant to  this  section
 for  the  current year shall be deemed to incorporate all funds distrib-
 uted pursuant to former subdivision 27 of section 3602 of the  education
 law  for prior years. In school districts where the teachers are repres-
 ented by certified or  recognized  employee  organizations,  all  salary
 increases  funded  pursuant to this section shall be determined by sepa-
 rate collective negotiations conducted pursuant to  the  provisions  and
 procedures  of  article 14 of the civil service law, notwithstanding the
 existence of a negotiated agreement between  a  school  district  and  a
 certified or recognized employee organization.

 appropriations for support of public libraries.
  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law to the contrary the moneys
 appropriated for the support of public libraries for the year  2023-2024
 by  a  chapter of the laws of 2023 enacting the aid to localities budget
 shall fulfill the state's obligation to provide such aid  and,  pursuant
 to a plan developed by the commissioner of education and approved by the
 director of the budget, the aid payable to libraries and library systems
 pursuant  to  such  appropriations  shall  be reduced proportionately to
 ensure that the total amount of aid payable does not  exceed  the  total
 appropriations for such purpose.

 § 1509. Disqualification  of  shareholders,  directors,  officers  and

  If  any  shareholder,  director, officer or employee of a professional
 service corporation, including  a  design  professional  service  corpo-
 ration,  who  has  been  rendering  professional  service  to the public
 becomes legally disqualified to practice his OR  HER  profession  within
 this  state,  he  OR  SHE shall sever all employment with, and financial
 interests (other than interests as  a  creditor)  in,  such  corporation
 forthwith  or as otherwise provided in section 1510 of this article. All
 provisions of law regulating the rendering of professional services by a
 person elected or appointed to a public office shall be applicable to  a
 shareholder,  director,  officer and employee of such corporation in the
 same manner and to the same extent as if fully set  forth  herein.  Such
 legal  disqualification  to  practice  his OR HER profession within this
 state shall be deemed to constitute an irrevocable offer by the disqual-
 ified shareholder to sell his OR HER shares to the corporation, pursuant
 to the provisions of section 1510 of this article or of the  certificate
 of  incorporation,  by-laws  or  agreement among the corporation and all
 shareholders, whichever is applicable. Compliance with the terms of such
 offer shall be specifically enforceable in the courts of this  state.  A
 professional  service  corporation's  failure to enforce compliance with
 this provision shall constitute a ground for forfeiture of  its  certif-
 icate of incorporation and its dissolution.

  (a) No shareholder of a professional service corporation [or], INCLUD-
 ING a design professional service corporation, may sell or transfer  his
 OR  HER  shares  in such corporation except to another individual who is
 eligible to have shares issued to him OR  HER  by  such  corporation  or
 except  in  trust to another individual who would be eligible to receive
 shares if he OR SHE were employed by  the  corporation.  Nothing  herein
 contained shall be construed to prohibit the transfer of shares by oper-
 ation  of  law or by court decree.  No transferee of shares by operation
 of law or court decree may vote the shares for  any  purpose  whatsoever
 except  with  respect to corporate action under sections 909 and 1001 of
 this chapter. The restriction in the preceding sentence shall not apply,
 however, where such transferee would be eligible to have  shares  issued
 to  him  OR HER if he OR SHE were an employee of the corporation and, if
 there are other shareholders, a  majority  of  such  other  shareholders
 shall fail to redeem the shares so transferred, pursuant to section 1510
 of  this  article, within sixty days of receiving written notice of such
 transfer. Any sale or transfer, except by  operation  of  law  or  court
 S. 4006  32  A. 3006
 
 decree  or  except for a corporation having only one shareholder, may be
 made only after the same shall have been approved by the board of direc-
 tors, or at a shareholders' meeting specially called for such purpose by
 such  proportion, not less than a majority, of the outstanding shares as
 may be provided in the certificate of incorporation or in the by-laws of
 such professional service corporation. At such shareholders' meeting the
 shares held by the shareholder proposing to sell or transfer his OR  HER
 shares  may  not  be voted or counted for any purpose, unless all share-
 holders consent that such shares be voted or counted. The certificate of
 incorporation or the by-laws of the professional service corporation, or
 the professional service corporation and  the  shareholders  by  private
 agreement,  may  provide,  in  lieu  of  or in addition to the foregoing
 provisions, for the alienation of shares and may require the  redemption
 or purchase of such shares by such corporation at prices and in a manner
 specifically set forth therein. The existence of the restrictions on the
 sale  or transfer of shares, as contained in this article and, if appli-
 cable, in the certificate of incorporation, by-laws, stock  purchase  or
 stock  redemption agreement, shall be noted conspicuously on the face or
 back of every certificate for shares issued by  a  professional  service
 corporation.  Any  sale  or  transfer  in violation of such restrictions
 shall be void.

  ARTICLE 20
  NEW HOMES TARGETS AND FAST TRACK APPROVAL

 SECTION 1000. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.
  1001. DEFINITIONS.
  1002. APPLICABILITY.
  1003. SAFE HARBOR.
  1004. LOCAL  PROCEDURES  OUTSIDE  OF  SAFE HARBOR/GENERAL APPEAL
  PROCESS.
  1005. HOUSING REVIEW BOARD.
  1006. LAND USE APPEALS BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.
  § 1000. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS. THE LEGISLATURE  HEREBY
 FINDS, DETERMINES, AND DECLARES THAT:
  1.  THE LACK OF HOUSING, ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING,
 IS A CRITICAL PROBLEM THAT THREATENS THE  ECONOMIC,  ENVIRONMENTAL,  AND
 SOCIAL  QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT NEW YORK STATE AND DISPROPORTIONATELY
 BURDENS VARIOUS VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY NEED MORE
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO,  LOW-  AND
 MODERATE-INCOME, RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY, AND ELDERLY HOUSEHOLDS.
  2. HOUSING IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE
 NATION.  THE  EXCESSIVE  COST OF THE STATE'S HOUSING SUPPLY IS PARTIALLY
 CAUSED BY A LACK OF NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION  DUE  TO  THE  PREVALENCE  OF
 LOCAL  GOVERNMENTAL  LAND  USE POLICIES THAT LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
 AND PLACE PROCEDURAL IMPEDIMENTS ON THE APPROVAL OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS
 AND THEREBY INCREASE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND RESTRICT THE HOUSING SUPPLY.
  3. LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL LIMITATIONS ON AND BARRIERS TO HOUSING  DEVELOP-
 MENT  ARE  ESPECIALLY COMMON FOR MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, WHICH
 CONSTRAINS THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE  HOUSING  THAT  OFTEN
 REQUIRE MULTI-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT TO BE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE.
  4.  AMONG  THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PREVALENCE OF LOCAL RESTRICTIONS ON
 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ARE  THE  LACK  OF  HOUSING  TO  SUPPORT  EMPLOYMENT
 GROWTH;  IMBALANCE IN NUMBER OF JOBS AND HOUSING SUPPLY, WITH THE FORMER
 OUTSTRIPPING THE LATTER; SPRAWL; EXCESSIVE COMMUTING; AND THE  POTENTIAL
 FOR  DISCRIMINATION  AGAINST  LOW-INCOME  AND  MINORITY  HOUSEHOLDS  WHO
 DISPROPORTIONATELY REQUIRE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES.
  5. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT GIVE ADEQUATE ATTENTION TO THE  LOCAL
 AND  BROADER REGIONAL ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL COSTS OF LOCAL
 POLICIES AND ACTIONS THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF STAGNATING OR REDUCING  THE
 SUPPLY  OF  HOUSING, INCLUDING AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, OR HOW
 SUCH POLICIES AND ACTIONS THEREBY PRODUCE THREATS TO THE PUBLIC  HEALTH,
 SAFETY, AND GENERAL WELFARE.
  6. ADDITIONALLY, MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT GIVE ADEQUATE ATTENTION
 TO  THE  LOCAL  AND BROADER REGIONAL ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL
 COSTS OF LOCAL POLICIES AND ACTIONS THAT RESULT IN DISAPPROVALS OR INHI-
 BITION OF PROPOSALS FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WOULD  BENEFIT
 THE  PUBLIC  HEALTH, SAFETY, AND GENERAL WELFARE; A REDUCTION IN DENSITY
 OF SUCH HOUSING PROJECTS; AND CREATION OF EXCESSIVE LAND USE  AND  OTHER
 BARRIERS FOR SUCH HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO BE BUILT.
  7.  LEGISLATION  IS  NECESSARY TO FORESTALL RESTRICTIVE LAND USE PRAC-
 TICES THAT INHIBIT AND LIMIT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, AND TO FORESTALL UNDUE
 LOCAL DISAPPROVALS OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY  AFFORDA-
 S. 4006  41  A. 3006
 
 BLE  AND  SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, GIVEN THAT SUCH PRACTICES AND DISAPPROVALS
 PRODUCE THREATS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY, AND GENERAL WELFARE.
  8.  THE  STATE  OF  NEW  YORK  MUST ENSURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GIVE
 ADEQUATE ATTENTION TO THE LOCAL AND BROADER REGIONAL ECONOMIC,  ENVIRON-
 MENTAL,  AND  SOCIAL  COSTS OF LAND USE ZONING AND PLANNING POLICIES AND
 ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE DENIAL OF APPLICATIONS  TO  BUILD  NEW  HOUSING,
 WHICH  COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY MAY RESULT IN A DEARTH OF APPROPRI-
 ATE HOUSING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF  ALL  RESIDENTS  IN  THE  COMMUNITY  OR
 REGION.
  9.  IN  FURTHERANCE OF OVERALL HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS AND TO PROMOTE
 THE GREATEST EFFICIENCY AND COORDINATED DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS  OF  LOCALI-
 TIES  WITHIN  THE  STATE,  IT  IS BOTH A MATTER OF STATE CONCERN AND THE
 POLICY OF THE STATE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ADDRESS THEIR LAND USE  POLI-
 CIES, PRACTICES, AND DECISIONS THAT MAKE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS, AND ESPE-
 CIALLY  MULTI-FAMILY,  AFFORDABLE,  AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS,
 IMPOSSIBLE OR INFEASIBLE.
  10. TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORTIVE HOUS-
 ING IN NEW YORK AND ENCOURAGE REDUCTION OF LAND USE RESTRICTIONS AND THE
 PRODUCTION OF MUCH NEEDED HOUSING, THIS  ARTICLE  CREATES  AN  IMPARTIAL
 FORUM  AND  A  PROCESS  FOR  SPECIALLY  DESIGNATING  JUDGES  TO  RESOLVE
 CONFLICTS ARISING FROM LOCAL DECISIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF  AFFORDABLE
 AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.
  11. IN ORDER TO PREVENT HOUSING INSECURITY, HARDSHIP, AND DISLOCATION,
 THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  ACT ARE NECESSARY AND DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY, AND GENERAL WELFARE OF THE RESIDENTS OF NEW  YORK
 STATE.

 CATION TO CREATE AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT WITHIN NINETY DAYS FROM  THE
 DATE  THE  LOCAL  AGENCY RECEIVES A COMPLETED APPLICATION OR, IN A LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT HAVING A POPULATION OF ONE  MILLION  OR  MORE,  WITHIN  SIXTY
 DAYS.  IF THE PERMIT APPLICATION TO CREATE AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT IS
 SUBMITTED WITH A PERMIT APPLICATION TO CREATE A NEW PRIMARY  RESIDENTIAL
 DWELLING  UNIT  ON  THE  LOT,  THE PERMITTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY DELAY

 cle.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART G
 S. 4006  59  A. 3006
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "transit-oriented development act of 2023".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings and statement of purpose. The legislature
 hereby finds, determines and declares:
  New York State has a vital interest in reducing harmful greenhouse gas
 emissions. New York State further recognizes that encouraging and facil-
 itating use of rail-based mass transit is a valuable method for reducing
 greenhouse gas emissions. New York State further recognizes that  creat-
 ing  walkable living environments with a variety of housing options near
 rail-based mass transit not only advances the goal  of  encouraging  the
 use  of  rail-based  mass  transit, but also promotes local and regional
 economic development.
  Housing in the state of New York is among the most  expensive  in  the
 nation and housing insecurity remains a problem for many low- and moder-
 ate-income families. The excessive cost of the state's housing supply is
 partially caused by a lack of housing near public transit access points.
 This  lack  of  available  housing  is especially pronounced in well-re-
 sourced municipalities and neighborhoods with  access  to  jobs,  educa-
 tional  resources,  and  health  infrastructure that engender social and
 economic mobility.
  Many local governments do not give adequate attention to  or  planning
 for  the  local and broader regional economic, environmental, and social
 costs of local policies and actions that have the effect  of  stagnating
 or  reducing  the supply of housing, including affordable and supportive
 housing, or how such policies and actions thereby produce threats to the
 public health, safety, and general welfare.
  Increasing the supply of housing in close proximity to  rail  stations
 is  a matter of state concern and critical to promoting housing afforda-
 bility, reducing housing insecurity, driving economic growth,  encourag-
 ing  social  and  economic  mobility,  and  actualizing the goals of the
 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.
  A public policy purpose would be  served  and  the  interests  of  the
 people  of  the  state would be advanced by requiring local planning and
 zoning changes that will facilitate the production of multifamily  hous-
 ing in areas near rail stations.
  §  3.  The general city law is amended by adding a new section 20-h to
 read as follows:
  § 20-H. DENSITY OF RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS  NEAR  TRANSIT  STATIONS.  1.

 having jurisdiction, the foregoing articles, sections  and  subdivisions
 of  sections  shall  remain  applicable  where  a local law of such city
 authorizes such alteration or conversion to be made, at  the  option  of
 the  owner,  either  in accordance with the requirements of the building
 law and regulations in effect in such  city  prior  to  December  sixth,
 nineteen hundred sixty-eight or the requirements of the building law and

  § 2. Section 275 of the multiple dwelling law, as added by chapter 734
 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  §  275.  Legislative findings. It is hereby declared and found that in
 cities with a population in excess of  one  million,  large  numbers  of
 loft,  manufacturing,  commercial,  institutional,  public and community
 facility buildings have lost, and continue to  lose,  their  tenants  to
 more modern premises; and that the untenanted portions of such buildings
 constitute  a  potential housing stock within such cities which is capa-
 ble, when appropriately altered, of  accommodating  general  residential
 use, thereby contributing to an alleviation of the housing shortage most
 severely  affecting moderate and middle income families, and of accommo-
 dating joint living-work quarters for artists by making  readily  avail-
 able  space  which  is  physically  and economically suitable for use by
 persons regularly engaged in the arts.
  There is a public purpose to be served by making accommodations readi-
 ly available for joint living-work quarters for artists for the  follow-
 ing  reasons:  persons  regularly  engaged  in the arts require larger
 amounts of space for the pursuit of their artistic endeavors and for the
 storage of the materials therefor and of the products thereof  than  are
 regularly  to  be  found  in dwellings subject to this article; that the
 financial remunerations to be obtained from pursuit of a career  in  the
 arts  are  generally  small;  that as a result of such limited financial
 remuneration persons regularly engaged in the  arts  generally  find  it
 financially  impossible  to  maintain  quarters for the pursuit of their
 artistic endeavors separate and apart from their  places  of  residence;
 that the cultural life of cities of more than one million persons within
 this  state  and of the state as a whole is enhanced by the residence in
 such cities of large numbers of persons regularly engaged in  the  arts;
 that  the  high  cost  of  land within such cities makes it particularly
 difficult for persons regularly engaged in the arts to obtain the use of
 the amounts of space required for their work as aforesaid; and that  the
 residential  use  of  the space is secondary or accessory to the primary
 use as a place of work.
  It is further declared that the legislation governing  the  alteration
 of  such buildings to accommodate general residential use must of neces-
 sity be more restrictive  than  statutes  heretofore  in  effect,  which
 affected only joint living-work quarters for artists.
  It  is the intention of this legislation to promulgate statewide mini-
 mum standards for all alterations of non-residential buildings to  resi-
 dential  use,  but  the  legislature  is  cognizant that the use of such
 buildings for residential purposes must be consistent with local  zoning
 S. 4006  82  A. 3006
 
 ordinances.  The  legislature  further recognizes that it is the role of
 localities to adopt regulations which will define in further detail  the
 manner  in  which alterations should be carried out where building types
 and  conditions  are  peculiar  to their local environment. IT IS HEREBY
 ADDITIONALLY DECLARED AND FOUND THAT IN  CITIES  WITH  A  POPULATION  IN
 EXCESS  OF ONE MILLION, LARGE NUMBERS OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS HAVE LOST,
 AND CONTINUE TO LOSE, THEIR TENANTS TO MORE MODERN PREMISES AND  TO  THE
 CHANGING  NATURE  OF  REMOTE  OFFICE  WORK  IN  THE WAKE OF THE COVID-19
 PANDEMIC; AND THAT THE UNTENANTED PORTIONS OF SUCH BUILDINGS  CONSTITUTE
 A  POTENTIAL  HOUSING  STOCK  WITHIN  SUCH CITIES WHICH IS CAPABLE, WHEN
 APPROPRIATELY ALTERED, OF ACCOMMODATING GENERAL RESIDENTIAL USE, THEREBY
 CONTRIBUTING TO AN ALLEVIATION OF THE HOUSING SHORTAGE.
  § 3. Section 276 of the multiple dwelling law, as amended  by  chapter
 420 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  § 276. [Definition of an artist] DEFINITIONS. As used in this article,
 the FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  1.  THE  word  "artist" means a person who is regularly engaged in the
 fine arts, such as painting and sculpture or in the performing or  crea-
 tive  arts, including choreography and filmmaking, or in the composition
 of music on a professional basis,  and  is  so  certified  by  the  city
 department  of  cultural  affairs  and/or state council on the arts. For
 joint living-work quarters for artists limited to artists' occupancy  by
 local  zoning resolution, any permanent occupant whose residence therein
 began on or before December fifteenth, two thousand twenty-one shall  be
 deemed  to  meet such occupancy requirements under the same rights as an
 artist so certified in accordance with applicable law.
  2. THE TERM "GENERAL RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES" MEANS USE OF A BUILDING  AS
 A  CLASS  A MULTIPLE DWELLING, EXCEPT THAT SUCH TERM SHALL NOT INCLUDE A
 ROOMING UNIT AS DEFINED IN SECTION 27-2004 OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE OF
 THE CITY OF NEW YORK OTHER THAN A ROOMING UNIT IN A CLASS A OR  CLASS  B
 MULTIPLE DWELLING THAT IS AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO SECTION 27-2077 OF SUCH

 LOFT, COMMERCIAL, INSTITUTIONAL, PUBLIC, COMMUNITY FACILITY OR  MANUFAC-
 TURING  PURPOSES  AT  ANY  TIME PRIOR TO DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, NINETEEN
 HUNDRED NINETY, MAY BE OCCUPIED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FOR GENERAL  RESI-
 DENTIAL  PURPOSES  IF SUCH OCCUPANCY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE,
 NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER ARTICLE OF THIS CHAPTER, OR ANY  PROVISION  OF
 LAW  COVERING  THE  SAME SUBJECT MATTER, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY
 THE ZONING RESOLUTION OF SUCH CITY.
  2. OCCUPANCY PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE PERMITTED ONLY  IF  THE
 CONDITIONS  IN  SUBDIVISIONS  ONE THROUGH SIXTEEN OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED
 SEVENTY-SEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE ARE COMPLIED WITH, EXCEPT THAT THE CONVER-
 SION SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE  JOINT  LIVING-WORK  QUARTERS  FOR
 ARTISTS,  AND  PROVIDED  FURTHER THAT CONVERSIONS UNDERTAKEN PURSUANT TO
 THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION  TWEN-
 TY-SIX OF THIS CHAPTER.
  3.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  STATE  OR  LOCAL  LAW,  RULE, OR REGULATION,
 INCLUDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS SECTION OR ARTICLE TO THE  CONTRA-
 RY,  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY BUILDING LOCATED
 IN A DISTRICT THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO  THE  PROVISIONS
 OF SECTION 15-01 OF THE ZONING RESOLUTION OF A CITY WITH A POPULATION OF
 ONE MILLION OR MORE PERSONS.
 S. 4006  83  A. 3006
 
  §  5.  An  application  for  conversion  of a building pursuant to the
 provisions of this  act,  which  application  for  a  permit  containing
 complete  plans  and specifications is filed prior to December 31, 2030,
 shall be permitted to proceed as if subdivision 3 of section 279 of  the
 multiple dwelling law, as added by section four of this act, remained in
 effect, so long as construction of such project begins within the earli-
 er to occur of three years from December 31, 2030 or such time which the
 permit otherwise expires.
  §  6.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 subdivision 3 of section 279 of the multiple dwelling law  as  added  by
 section four of this act shall expire and be deemed repealed on December
 31, 2030; provided further, however, that the repeal of subdivision 3 of
 section  279  of  the  multiple dwelling law as added by section four of
 this act shall not affect the use of any building for  general  residen-
 tial  purposes,  as  such term is defined in article 7-B of the multiple
 dwelling law, permitted prior to such repeal.

 THE  TAXES  OF  SUCH  COUNTY, CITY, TOWN, VILLAGE OR SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE

 S. 4006  97  A. 3006
 
  2. (A) SUCH BUILDINGS SHALL BE EXEMPT FOR A PERIOD OF  FIVE  YEARS  TO
 THE  EXTENT  OF ONE HUNDRED PER CENTUM OF THE INCREASE IN ASSESSED VALUE
 THEREOF ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH RECONSTRUCTION, ALTERATION, IMPROVEMENT, OR
 NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR SUCH ADDITIONAL  RESIDENTIAL  UNIT  OR  UNITS  THAT
 PROVIDE  INDEPENDENT  LIVING FACILITIES FOR ONE OR MORE PERSONS, AND FOR
 AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING:
  (I) THE EXTENT OF SUCH EXEMPTION SHALL BE DECREASED BY TWENTY-FIVE PER
 CENTUM OF THE "EXEMPTION BASE" FOR EACH OF THE FIRST THREE YEARS  DURING
 SUCH  ADDITIONAL  PERIOD  AND  SHALL  BE  DECREASED BY A FURTHER TEN PER
 CENTUM OF THE "EXEMPTION BASE" DURING EACH OF THE  FINAL  TWO  YEARS  OF

 VALUE AS DETERMINED IN THE INITIAL YEAR OF THE TERM  OF  THE  EXEMPTION,
 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
  (II)  IN  ANY YEAR IN WHICH A CHANGE IN LEVEL OF ASSESSMENT OF FIFTEEN
 PERCENT OR MORE IS CERTIFIED FOR A FINAL ASSESSMENT ROLL PURSUANT TO THE
 RULES OF THE COMMISSIONER, THE EXEMPTION BASE SHALL BE MULTIPLIED  BY  A
 FRACTION,  THE  NUMERATOR  OF WHICH SHALL BE THE TOTAL ASSESSED VALUE OF
 THE PARCEL ON SUCH FINAL ASSESSMENT ROLL (AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR ANY PHYS-
 ICAL OR QUANTITY CHANGES TO THE PARCEL SINCE THE  IMMEDIATELY  PRECEDING
 ASSESSMENT  ROLL),  AND  THE  DENOMINATOR  OF  WHICH  SHALL BE THE TOTAL
 ASSESSED VALUE OF THE PARCEL ON THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FINAL  ASSESS-
 MENT  ROLL.  THE  RESULT  SHALL BE THE NEW EXEMPTION BASE. THE EXEMPTION

 NOT HAVE CUSTODY OF THE ROLL WHEN SUCH CERTIFICATION  IS  RECEIVED,  THE
 ASSESSOR  SHALL  CERTIFY  THE RECOMPUTED EXEMPTION TO THE LOCAL OFFICERS
 HAVING CUSTODY AND CONTROL OF THE ROLL,  AND  SUCH  LOCAL  OFFICERS  ARE
 HEREBY  DIRECTED AND AUTHORIZED TO ENTER THE RECOMPUTED EXEMPTION CERTI-
 FIED BY THE ASSESSOR ON THE ROLL. THE ASSESSOR SHALL GIVE WRITTEN NOTICE
 OF SUCH RECOMPUTED EXEMPTION TO THE PROPERTY OWNER, WHO MAY,  IF  HE  OR
 SHE  BELIEVES THAT THE EXEMPTION WAS RECOMPUTED INCORRECTLY, APPLY FOR A
 CORRECTION IN THE MANNER PROVIDED BY TITLE THREE OF ARTICLE FIVE OF THIS
 CHAPTER FOR THE CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERRORS.
  (III) SUCH EXEMPTION SHALL BE LIMITED TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND  DOLLARS
 IN  INCREASED  MARKET  VALUE OF THE PROPERTY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH RECON-
 STRUCTION, ALTERATION, IMPROVEMENT, OR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ANY INCREASE
 IN MARKET VALUE GREATER THAN SUCH AMOUNT SHALL NOT BE ELIGIBLE  FOR  THE
 EXEMPTION  PURSUANT  TO  THIS SECTION. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION,
 THE MARKET VALUE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION, ALTERATION, IMPROVEMENT, OR  NEW
 CONSTRUCTION  AS  AUTHORIZED BY SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE
 EQUAL TO THE  INCREASED  ASSESSED  VALUE  ATTRIBUTABLE  TO  SUCH  RECON-
 STRUCTION,  ALTERATION,  IMPROVEMENT  OR NEW CONSTRUCTION DIVIDED BY THE
 CLASS ONE RATIO IN A SPECIAL ASSESSING UNIT OR THE MOST RECENTLY  ESTAB-
 LISHED  STATE  EQUALIZATION  RATE  OR  SPECIAL  EQUALIZATION RATE IN THE
 REMAINDER OF THE STATE, EXCEPT WHERE  THE  STATE  EQUALIZATION  RATE  OR
 SPECIAL  EQUALIZATION  RATE  EQUALS  OR  EXCEEDS NINETY-FIVE PERCENT, IN
 WHICH CASE THE INCREASE IN ASSESSED VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE  TO  SUCH  RECON-
 STRUCTION,  ALTERATION,  IMPROVEMENT OR NEW CONSTRUCTION SHALL BE DEEMED
 TO EQUAL THE MARKET VALUE OF SUCH RECONSTRUCTION,  ALTERATION,  IMPROVE-
 MENT, OR NEW CONSTRUCTION.
  (B)  NO  SUCH  EXEMPTION  SHALL  BE GRANTED FOR RECONSTRUCTION, ALTER-
 ATIONS, IMPROVEMENTS, OR NEW CONSTRUCTION UNLESS:

 CONSTRUCTION EXCEEDS THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS; AND

 INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES FOR ONE OR MORE PERSONS.
  (C) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION THE TERMS RECONSTRUCTION, ALTERATION,
 IMPROVEMENT, AND NEW CONSTRUCTION SHALL NOT INCLUDE ORDINARY MAINTENANCE
 AND REPAIRS.
  3. SUCH EXEMPTION SHALL BE GRANTED ONLY UPON APPLICATION BY THE  OWNER
 OF  SUCH BUILDING ON A FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE COMMISSIONER. THE APPLICA-
 TION SHALL BE FILED WITH THE ASSESSOR OF  THE  CITY,  TOWN,  VILLAGE  OR
 COUNTY HAVING THE POWER TO ASSESS PROPERTY FOR TAXATION ON OR BEFORE THE
 APPROPRIATE TAXABLE STATUS DATE OF SUCH CITY, TOWN, VILLAGE OR COUNTY.
  4.  IF SATISFIED THAT THE APPLICANT IS ENTITLED TO AN EXEMPTION PURSU-
 ANT TO THIS SECTION, THE ASSESSOR SHALL APPROVE THE APPLICATION AND SUCH
 BUILDING SHALL THEREAFTER BE EXEMPT FROM TAXATION AND SPECIAL AD VALOREM
 LEVIES AS HEREIN PROVIDED COMMENCING WITH THE ASSESSMENT  ROLL  PREPARED
 ON THE BASIS OF THE TAXABLE STATUS DATE REFERRED TO IN SUBDIVISION THREE
 OF THIS SECTION. THE ASSESSED VALUE OF ANY EXEMPTION GRANTED PURSUANT TO
 THIS  SECTION  SHALL  BE  ENTERED BY THE ASSESSOR ON THE ASSESSMENT ROLL
 WITH THE TAXABLE PROPERTY, WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE EXEMPTION SHOWN  IN  A
 SEPARATE COLUMN.

 SECTION CEASES TO BE USED PRIMARILY FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES,  OR  TITLE
 THERETO  IS  TRANSFERRED  TO OTHER THAN THE HEIRS OR DISTRIBUTEES OF THE
 OWNER, THE EXEMPTION GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL CEASE.
  7. (A) A COUNTY, CITY, TOWN OR VILLAGE  MAY,  BY  ITS  LOCAL  LAW,  OR
 SCHOOL DISTRICT, BY ITS RESOLUTION:
  (I)  REDUCE  THE PER CENTUM OF EXEMPTION OTHERWISE ALLOWED PURSUANT TO
 THIS SECTION;
  (II) LIMIT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE EXEMPTION  TO  THOSE  FORMS  OF  RECON-
 STRUCTION,  ALTERATIONS,  IMPROVEMENTS,  OR  NEW  CONSTRUCTION  AS  ARE
 PRESCRIBED IN SUCH LOCAL LAW OR RESOLUTION.
  (B) NO SUCH LOCAL LAW OR RESOLUTION SHALL REPEAL AN EXEMPTION  GRANTED
 PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH
 SUCH EXEMPTION WAS GRANTED.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to assess-
 ment rolls based on taxable status dates  occurring  on  or  after  such
 effective date.

 in  the  city  of  New  York and across the United States, over the past
 several decades, income inequality has  expanded  and  that  poverty  is
 frequently  concentrated  in  economically  disadvantaged  regions.  The

 New York, the city school district of the city of New York, the New York
 city school construction authority, the New York city health and  hospi-
 tals  corporation,  the New York city industrial development agency, and
 other city-affiliated not-for-profit corporations to  use  the  economic
 power of their transactions to implement programs by administrative rule
 requiring  contractors  and  subcontractors benefitting from such trans-
 actions to make best efforts to employ qualified economically  disadvan-
