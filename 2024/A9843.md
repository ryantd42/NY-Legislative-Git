 AN  ACT granting Michael Quatrocci a presumption of disability regarding
  accidental disability retirement
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the retirement and
 social security law or of any general,  special  or  local  law  to  the
 contrary,  Michael  Quatrocci,  a police officer for the city of Yonkers
 who contracted COVID-19 in March 2020 while so employed  and  has  since
 had  impaired  health  due  to  contracting COVID-19 which resulted in a
 disability, shall have such impaired health be presumptive evidence that
 such disability was incurred in the performance and  discharge  of  duty
 and  the  natural and proximate result of such discharge of duty, unless
 the contrary be proved by competent evidence, for the purposes of apply-
 ing for accidental  disability  retirement  under  section  363  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  grant  Michael  Quatrocci, a member of the New York
 State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), a COVID-19
 related presumption which is expected to result in an  accidental  disa-
 bility  benefit  under section 363 of the Retirement and Social Security
 Law (RSSL). The disability benefit will be 75 percent of  final  average
 salary,  less  workers'  compensation. Michael Quatrocci is currently an
 active member employed full-time with the City of Yonkers  as  a  police
 officer. They will be required to complete and submit an application for
 accidental disability retirement prior to receiving any disability bene-
 fit.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted  during  the 2024 Legislative Session, and
 Michael Quatrocci  is  subsequently  approved  for  disability  benefits
 pursuant  to  section  363  of the RSSL, there will be an immediate past
 service cost of approximately $832,000 which will be borne by the  State
 of New York and all local participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
