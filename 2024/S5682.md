 house  of  the  legislature  of  a bill, concurrent resolution proposing
 amendments to the state constitution, or concurrent resolution proposing
 or ratifying amendments to the constitution of the  United  States,  the
 presiding  or  other officer designated by the rules of such house shall
 append to such bill or resolution a certificate, to be  signed  by  him,
 which  shall disclose the date of its passage in such house, and whether
 passed by the votes of a majority of all the  members  elected  to  such
 house or of two-thirds thereof, or of a majority of such members, three-
 fifths  thereof  being  present.  In addition, if any such bill has been
 passed on a message required by the constitution, that fact  also  shall
 be  stated,  and  if the message so specifies, the applicable portion of
 the constitution shall be identified. Upon the passage of a bill  as  to
 which  a part becomes law immediately and a part requires further action
 by the governor, two copies shall be certified as above provided, one of
 which, upon final passage by both houses, shall be  transmitted  to  the
 governor  and  the  other  to  the secretary of state. No bills shall be
 deemed to have so passed unless certified in the manner provided by this
