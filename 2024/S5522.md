 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation  to  increasing
  the  retention  percentage collected for certain motor vehicle service
  fees

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivisions  3 and 3-a of section 205 of the vehicle and
 traffic law, subdivision 3 as amended by section 3 of part G of  chapter
 59 of the laws of 2008 and subdivision 3-a as added by section 1 of part
 F of chapter 58 of the laws of 2012, are amended to read as follows:
  3.  Each  such  county  clerk shall retain from fees collected for any
 motor vehicle related service  described  in  subdivision  one  of  this
 section  processed  by such county clerk an amount based on a percentage
 of gross receipts collected. For purposes  of  this  section,  the  term
 "gross  receipts"  shall include all fines, fees and penalties collected
 pursuant to this chapter by a  county  clerk  acting  as  agent  of  the
 commissioner,  but shall not include any state or local sales or compen-
 sating use taxes imposed under or pursuant to the authority of  articles
 twenty-eight  and twenty-nine of the tax law and collected by such clerk
 on behalf of the commissioner of taxation  and  finance.  The  retention
 percentage  shall  be  [12.7]  TWENTY-FIVE percent and shall take effect
 [April] JANUARY first, [nineteen hundred ninety-nine] TWO THOUSAND TWEN-
 TY-FOUR; provided, however, the retention percentage shall  be  [thirty]
 SIXTY  percent  of the thirty dollar fee established in paragraph (e) of
 subdivision two of section four hundred ninety-one and  paragraph  f-one
 of subdivision two of section five hundred three of this chapter.
  3-a. In addition to the fees retained pursuant to subdivision three of
 this  section, each county clerk acting as the agent of the commissioner
 pursuant to subdivision one of this section shall  retain  [four]  EIGHT
 percent  of "enhanced internet and electronic partner revenue" collected

 by the commissioner. For the purposes  of  this  subdivision,  "enhanced
 internet  and electronic partner revenue" shall mean the amount of gross
 receipts attributable to all transactions conducted on the  internet  by
 residents of such county and by designated partners of the department on
 behalf  of such residents for the current calendar year that exceeds the
 amount of such revenue collected by  the  commissioner  during  calendar
 year  two thousand eleven. The commissioner shall certify the amounts to
 be  retained  by  each  county  clerk  pursuant  to  this  subdivision.
 [Provided,  however,  that  if  the aggregate amount of fees retained by
 county clerks pursuant to this subdivision in calendar years  two  thou-
 sand  twelve  and  two  thousand  thirteen combined exceeds eighty-eight
 million five hundred thousand dollars, then the percentage of fees to be
 retained thereafter shall be reduced to a percentage that, if applied to
 the fees collected during calendar years two  thousand  twelve  and  two
 thousand  thirteen  combined,  would  have  resulted  in  an  aggregate
 retention of eighty-eight million five hundred thousand dollars  or  2.5
 percent  of  enhanced internet and electronic partner revenue, whichever
 is higher. If the aggregate amount of fees  retained  by  county  clerks
 pursuant  to  this subdivision in calendar years two thousand twelve and
 two thousand thirteen combined is less than  eighty-eight  million  five
 hundred  thousand  dollars,  then  the percentage of fees to be retained
 thereafter shall be increased to a percentage that, if  applied  to  the
 fees  collected  during calendar years two thousand twelve and two thou-
 sand thirteen combined, would have resulted in an aggregate retention of
 eighty-eight million five hundred thousand dollars, or  six  percent  of
 enhanced  internet and electronic partner revenue, whichever is less. On
 and after April first, two thousand sixteen,  the  percent  of  enhanced
 internet  and electronic partner revenue to be retained by county clerks
 shall be the average of the  annual  percentages  that  were  in  effect
 between  April  first,  two  thousand twelve and March thirty-first, two
 thousand sixteen.]
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next  succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
