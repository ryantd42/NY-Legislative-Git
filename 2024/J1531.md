  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September  2024,  as  Gynecologic  Cancer  Awareness
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long- standing traditions, this Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2024,  as
Gynecologic Cancer  Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction with the observance of National Gynecologic Cancer Awareness
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Gynecological Cancer Awareness Month provides an important
opportunity to draw attention to this important women's health issue and
offer vital information on risk cancers, warning signs,  and  prevention
strategies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated
that this year  more  than  113,500  women  will  be  diagnosed  with  a
gynecologic cancer and more than 33,000 will die from the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Gynecological  cancers are those that develop in a woman's
reproductive tract and include cervical cancer, ovarian cancer,  uterine
cancer, vaginal cancer and vulvar cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are different risk factors for each of these cancers,
including,  in  some  cases, heredity; however, there are many women who
develop cancer without being considered high risk; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each type of gynecological cancer has  different  symptoms,
some  of  which  may  be  difficult  to recognize; while women should be
familiar with the symptoms associated with gynecological cancer,  it  is
just  as  important  for  women to pay attention to their own bodies and
take note when something is "off" or not normal; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention  (CDC)  has
developed  a  symptoms  diary women can use to keep track of any unusual
symptoms they may experience so they can share this  in  detail  with  a
healthcare provider; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  important  for  women  to be aware of the types of
gynecological cancer, symptoms and potential warning signs to watch  out
for,  and  screening  and  prevention  strategies; it is imperative that
there be greater awareness of this serious health  condition,  and  more
must  be  done to increase activity at local, State and National levels;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2024,  as
Gynecologic Cancer Awareness Month; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
