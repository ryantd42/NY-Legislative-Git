 of  its  facilities  [through,  and cause any one or more of its powers,
 duties, functions or activities to be exercised or performed by, no more
 than one wholly-owned subsidiary corporation of the authority]  for  the
 [sole]  purposes  of  operating  an  animal shelter and providing animal
 management services on behalf of one or more municipalities  located  in
 the  county  of  Rockland  pursuant to the agriculture and markets law[.
 Such subsidiary corporation shall be deemed an animal  shelter  for  the
 purposes of registration, inspection or any oversight required by law or
 regulation  by  the department of agriculture and markets. The authority
 may transfer to or from any such corporation,  or  between  such  corpo-

 and  activities.  Such  subsidiary  corporation  shall be subject to the
 restrictions and limitations to which the authority may be subject. Such
 subsidiary corporation shall be  subject  to  suit  in  accordance  with
 section two thousand fifty-three-u this title. The employees of any such
 subsidiary  corporation,  except  those  who  are  also employees of the
 authority, shall not be deemed employees of the authority] AND  WILL  BE

  § 4. Subdivision 1 of section 2053-g of the public authorities law, as
 amended  by  chapter  553  of  the  laws  of 2022, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. The authority may fix and collect, on any equitable  basis,  rates,
 rentals, fees and other charges for the use of facilities of or services
 or  commodities provided by the authority [or any subsidiary], including
 the availability of any of the foregoing from the authority. Such rates,
 rentals, fees and other charges may be  fixed  and  collected  from  any
 person  to whom such facilities, services or commodities are provided by
 or made available from the  authority,  including  generators  of  solid
 waste  and  owners of real property upon which solid waste is generated.
 Such rates, rentals, fees and other charges may be the same or different
 for each classification of user or service recipient and may, by way  of
 example,  reflect  the  source  and  composition  of solid waste and may
 provide for fee reductions to the users or service recipients in propor-
 tion to waste generated or to reflect participation in source separation
 programs. In any instance where the county is or would  be  required  by
 law, with respect to solid waste management, to conduct a public hearing
 in  connection  with  a  user  or rate, rental, fee or other charge, the
 authority shall not establish, fix, or revise any classification of user
 or service recipient, rate, rental, fee or other charge unless and until
 the authority has held a public hearing at which interested persons have
 had an opportunity to be heard concerning the  same;  provided  however,
 that  if  the  county  has conducted a public hearing in connection with
 such rate, rental, fee or other  charge,  the  authority  shall  not  be
 required  to  hold  a  public hearing. Notice of any such public hearing
 shall be published at least ten days before the date set therefor, in at
 least one newspaper of general circulation in the  county.  Such  notice
 shall  set  forth  the  date,  time  and place of such hearing and shall
 include a brief description of the matters  to  be  considered  at  such

 meeting.  A  copy of the notice shall be available for inspection by the
 public. At any such hearing, any interested persons shall have an oppor-
 tunity to be heard concerning the matters under consideration. Any deci-
 sion  by the authority at such public hearing shall be in writing and be
 made available in the office of  the  authority  for  public  inspection
 during regular office hours.

 as amended by chapter 553 of the laws of 2022, is  amended  to  read  as
