  Section 1. Subdivision 5-b of section 2852 of the  education  law,  as

  5-b. If the board of regents returns a proposed charter to the charter
 entity pursuant to the provisions of subdivision five-a of this section,
 such  charter  entity shall reconsider the proposed charter, taking into
 consideration the comments and recommendation of the board  of  regents.
 Thereafter,  the  charter  entity shall resubmit the proposed charter to
 the board of regents with modifications,  provided  that  the  applicant
 consents  in writing to such modifications, [resubmit the proposed char-
 ter to the board of  regents  without  modifications,]  or  abandon  the
 proposed  charter. The board of regents shall review each such resubmit-
 ted proposed charter in accordance with the  provisions  of  subdivision
 five-a of this section[; provided, however, that it shall be the duty of
 the board of regents to approve and issue a proposed charter resubmitted
 by the charter entity described in paragraph (b) of subdivision three of
 section  twenty-eight  hundred  fifty-one  of this article within thirty
 days of the resubmission of such proposed charter or such proposed char-
 ter shall be deemed approved and issued at the expiration of such  peri-
 od].  NO  RESUBMITTED  PROPOSED CHARTER SHALL BE APPROVED BY THE CHARTER
 ENTITY UNLESS ALL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS  ARE  MADE  TO
 THE  SATISFACTION  OF  THE  BOARD OF REGENTS IN SUCH RESUBMISSION.  SUCH
 CHARTER SHALL NOT BE APPROVED IF THE BOARD OF  REGENTS  RECOMMENDS  THAT
 THE CHARTER BE ABANDONED.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
