  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 17, 2024, as Prematurity Day in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The March of Dimes Foundation is a pioneer in improving the
health  of  infants  and  women  of childbearing age by preventing birth
defects, premature birth and infant mortality; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  November  17,  2024,  as
Prematurity  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of World Prematurity Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Prematurity Day was created on November 17, 2011,  to
raise  awareness  for  the  millions of children every year who are born
prematurely; while technologies and medical procedures in  America  have
increased  over  the  years,  preterm  babies  still  carry  a  huge
vulnerability to develop cerebral palsy, delays in development,  hearing
problems, and sight problems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Additionally, while neonatal death in the United States is
low in comparison to most of the world, premature births account  for  a
quarter of all neonatal deaths; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Prematurity Day was created to shine a light on the
risk and hardships  created  by  premature  births,  cost-effective  and
proven  solutions,  and  spreading  compassion  for  families  who  have
experienced premature births; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  premature  babies  grow  up  to  completely  healthy
individuals,  with  some  even  becoming  notable public figures such as
Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein; and
 
  WHEREAS, On November 17th, take a  moment  to  show  compassion  and
support  for  families  who  are  experiencing  the anxiety of premature
births by observing World Prematurity  Day,  created  by  the  March  of
Dimes; and
 
  WHEREAS, We all love our babies from the moment they are born; World
Prematurity  Day  reminds  us  of  babies  born too early and the health
challenges they can face as they grow up; and
 
  WHEREAS, These little ones need loads of love and support and  World
Prematurity Day is a chance to show it; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  November  17,  2024,  as
Prematurity Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
