 AN  ACT  in  relation  to  authorizing  the county of Nassau assessor to
  accept an application for a  real  property  tax  exemption  from  786
  Muhammadi Masjid, Inc.
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 786 Muhammadi Masjid, Inc.  an application for exemption from real prop-
 erty taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax  law  with
 respect  to  the assessment roll for the 2022-2023 school taxes, and the
 2022 and 2023 general taxes for the parcel owned by such  not-for-profit
 corporation  located  at  704  Doblin  Street, hamlet of Elmont, town of
 Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau  county  tax  map
 district section 37 block 653 lot 23. If accepted, the application shall
 be  reviewed  as if it had been received on or before the taxable status
 date established for such assessment rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
