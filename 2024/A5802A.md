 AN ACT in relation to authorizing  the  county  of  Nassau  assessor  to
  accept  an  application  for  a  real  property tax exemption from 786
  Muhammadi Masjid, Inc.

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 786 Muhammadi Masjid, Inc.  an application for exemption from real prop-
 erty  taxes  pursuant to sections 420-a and 462 of the real property tax
 law with respect to the 2019-2020 assessment roll for a portion  of  the
 2020  general taxes and the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 assessment rolls for
 a portion of the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school taxes  and  all  of  the
 2022  and 2023 general taxes for the parcel owned by such not-for-profit
 corporation located at 704 Doblin Street,  hamlet  of  Elmont,  town  of
 Hempstead,  county  of  Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county tax map
 district section 37 block 653 lot 23. If accepted, the application shall
 be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the  taxable  status
 date established for such assessment rolls.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  rolls,  the applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
