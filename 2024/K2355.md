  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 20, 2024, as POW/MIA Day in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of the Armed Services from the State of New York,
who have served so  valiantly  and  honorably  in  wars  in  which  this
country's  freedom  was  at  stake  deserve  a  special salute from this
Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 20, 2024, as POW/MIA Day in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  National
POW/MIA Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  the third Friday in September is set aside to
honor the commitment and the sacrifices made by this nation's  Prisoners
of War (POW) and those who are still Missing in Action (MIA), as well as
their families; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first POW/MIA Recognition Day commemoration was held at
the  National  Cathedral  in  Washington,  D.C.,  while the 1st Tactical
Squadron from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia flew  the  missing  man
formation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  there  are  approximately  73,515  persons
unaccounted for from World War II; 7,841 from the Korean War;  126  from
the  Cold  War;  1,626 from the Vietnam War; and 6 from recent conflicts
since 1991, for a  total  of  83,114  soldiers;  75%  are  somewhere  in
Asia-Pacific,  either  held as Prisoners of War or classified as Missing
in Action, and more than 41,000 presumed lost at sea; and
 
  WHEREAS, The point of POW/MIA Recognition Day is to ensure  that  we
remember  to  stand  behind  those  who  serve  and  to  make sure we do
everything we can to account for those who never returned; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New  York  wishes  to  honor  these  soldiers,
sailors, airmen and their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative Body pause in its deliberation to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  20,  2024,  as
POW/MIA Day in the State of New York, to ensure all New Yorkers remember
to  stand  behind  those who served and to make sure we do everything we
can to account for those who have never returned; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and American Legion Posts throughout the State of New York.
