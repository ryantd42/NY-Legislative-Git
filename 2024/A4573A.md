 AN  ACT  directing the department of public service to prepare a written
  report on the affordability of utility services

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings and declaration. In response to the
 COVID-19 pandemic, chapters 108 and 126 of the laws of 2020 were adopted
 to ensure that New Yorkers would not be deprived of gas, electric, water
 service, helping households follow the vital state policy of "sheltering
 in place."  The moratorium prohibited termination of utility services at
 a pivotal moment when it became evident that  sanitary  conditions  were
 required  to  combat  the  COVID-19  virus and keep New Yorkers safe and
 healthy, especially seniors and the medically vulnerable.  The  legisla-
 ture  finds  and  declares that it is unknown to the state the number of
 New Yorkers who had their services terminated or disconnected during the
 pandemic. The legislature finds that  many  utility  customers  rely  on
 continuous  service  for heat, water, and electricity to power necessary
 equipment, such as life-saving health care devices and other New Yorkers
 require cooling during extreme heat conditions and heat  during  extreme
 cold  conditions,  particularly when congregate care cooling and heating
 facilities are not safe for use by medically vulnerable households.  The
 legislature finds that the state requires comprehensive data  concerning
 New  Yorkers' ability to afford utility service, including the number of
 New Yorkers who had their services terminated or who  are  currently  at
 risk of termination during the pandemic. The legislature finds that this
 data  is  critical  to ascertain the effectiveness of the moratorium and
 other COVID-19 consumer protections, as well as the  disruptive  effects
 that  the  pandemic  has had on utility customers' finances, and utility
 finances and services, and the public  health,  safety  and  welfare  of

 millions  of medically and financially vulnerable citizens. The legisla-
 ture also finds that the permanent collection and reporting  of  utility
 data  is  imperative  to  gain  regular  updates  on and evaluate trends
 concerning  the scale and extent of terminations and utility debt across
 the state, so that evidence-based policy can be properly crafted  there-
 after.
  § 2. 1. As used in this act:
  a.  "Assistance  program"  shall  mean any program offered to eligible
 low-income customers to assist with the costs of electricity,  gas,  and
 water,  including  but not limited to the low-income home energy assist-
 ance program, any low-income affordability plans as provided  by  public
 service  commission  case  number  14-M-0565, and/or any other financial
 assistance program provided through or by New York state  or  individual
 utilities, counties or municipalities.
  b.  "COVID-19  state of emergency" shall mean the state disaster emer-
 gency declared pursuant to executive order 202 of 2020.

 the  commission,  to  allow such utility or municipality to provide such
 data in an alternative format if the specificity set forth in  this  act
 cannot  be  obtained  from  an  existing  utility information technology
 system and such data would result in the increase  of  customer  utility
 bills;

 to  bill  non-payment  but  were not disconnected because of any legally
 mandated or voluntary suspension of disconnections due to  the  COVID-19

 emergency as may follow the end of the COVID-19 emergency;

 nection  fees,  interest,  and  any  other  charge  associated with late
 payment of a bill;
  (12) the total dollar amount of late fees, penalties, interest, recon-
 nection fees and any other  charge  associated  with  late  payment  per
 customer,  the  average  and  median  dollar  amount  billed to customer

  (13) the methods and contents of general communications  by  utilities
 to  customer  accounts  concerning their rights and available assistance
 programs, excluding any customer-specific communications; and

 may be unable to pay bills for current service.

 submission  of the initial report, the commission shall conduct at least
 five public  hearings in different regions of the state,  as  defined
 by  the  empire  state development corporation, and provide meaningful
 opportunity for comment. The public hearings may be held virtually.

 act,  submit  to  the commission, in a form and manner determined by the
 commission, the information required pursuant to  paragraph  b  of  this
 subdivision.  Six months after the submission of the initial report to
 the governor and legislature, each utility shall submit to  the  commis-
 sion, in a form and manner determined by the commission, the information
 required pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivision. Each utility shall
 publish  on  its website the data it reports pursuant to this paragraph,
 simultaneously with submission of the data to the commission.
  3. If the data required by this act cannot reasonably be obtained from
 an existing utility information technology system without an increase in
 customer utility bills, a  utility  or  municipality  may  petition  the
 commission,  in a form and manner to be determined by the commission, to
 provide the required data in an alternative format.
  4. The commission shall publish on its website  the  reports  required
 pursuant  to  subdivision  two  of this section, simultaneously with the
 submission of each report.  The reports shall  include  the  information
 required pursuant to this section in a spreadsheet format.
  § 3. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate  the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in
 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
