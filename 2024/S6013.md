  3.  AN ORDER OR AMENDED ORDER ISSUED UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION AND SUBDI-
 VISION ONE OF THIS SECTION MAY IMPOSE A CONDITION THAT THE DEFENDANT NOT
 PURCHASE OR POSSESS A FIREARM. HOWEVER, IF THE COURT ORDERS THE  DEFEND-
 ANT  TO  CARRY OR WEAR A GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM DEVICE AS A CONDITION
 OF RELEASE AS DESCRIBED IN SUBDIVISION SIX OF THIS  SECTION,  THE  COURT
 SHALL ALSO IMPOSE A CONDITION THAT THE DEFENDANT NOT PURCHASE OR POSSESS
 A FIREARM.
  4.  THE JUDGE SHALL IMMEDIATELY DIRECT A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WITHIN
 THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT, IN WRITING, TO ENTER AN ORDER OR  AMENDED
 ORDER  ISSUED  UNDER SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION OR SUBDIVISIONS ONE
 AND THREE OF THIS SECTION INTO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM TO CARRY  INFORMATION
 OF  ORDERS  OF  PROTECTION AND WARRANTS OF ARREST AS PROVIDED BY SECTION
 TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE-A OF THIS CHAPTER. IF THE ORDER OR AMENDED  ORDER
 IS  RESCINDED,  THE  JUDGE  SHALL  IMMEDIATELY ORDER THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
 AGENCY TO REMOVE THE ORDER OR AMENDED ORDER FROM THE COMPUTER SYSTEM  TO
 CARRY INFORMATION OF ORDERS OF PROTECTION AND WARRANTS OF ARREST.
  5. A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT SHALL
 IMMEDIATELY  ENTER AN ORDER OR AMENDED ORDER INTO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM TO
 CARRY INFORMATION OF ORDERS OF PROTECTION  AND  WARRANTS  OF  ARREST  AS
 PROVIDED  BY  SECTION TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE-A OF THIS CHAPTER, OR SHALL
 REMOVE THE ORDER OR AMENDED ORDER FROM  THE  COMPUTER  SYSTEM  TO  CARRY
 INFORMATION  OF ORDERS OF PROTECTION AND WARRANTS OF ARREST UPON EXPIRA-
 TION OF THE ORDER OR AS DIRECTED BY THE COURT UNDER SUBDIVISION FOUR  OF

 VIOLENCE IS RELEASED UNDER THIS SECTION, THE JUDGE MAY ORDER THE DEFEND-
 ANT TO CARRY OR WEAR A GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM DEVICE AS  A  CONDITION
 OF  RELEASE. WITH THE INFORMED CONSENT OF THE VICTIM, THE COURT MAY ALSO
 ORDER THE DEFENDANT TO PROVIDE THE VICTIM OF THE CHARGED CRIME  WITH  AN
 ELECTRONIC  RECEPTOR  DEVICE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING THE GLOBAL POSITIONING
 SYSTEM INFORMATION FROM THE DEVICE CARRIED OR WORN BY THE DEFENDANT THAT
 NOTIFIES THE VICTIM IF THE DEFENDANT IS LOCATED WITHIN  A  PROXIMITY  TO
 THE  VICTIM  AS DETERMINED BY THE JUDGE IN CONSULTATION WITH THE VICTIM.
 THE VICTIM SHALL ALSO BE FURNISHED WITH A  TELEPHONE  CONTACT  WITH  THE
 LOCAL  LAW  ENFORCEMENT  AGENCY  TO  REQUEST IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE IF THE
 DEFENDANT IS LOCATED WITHIN THAT PROXIMITY TO THE VICTIM.  IN  ADDITION,

 SHE WOULD LIKE THE DEFENDANT EXCLUDED.  THE  COURT  SHALL  CONSIDER  THE
 VICTIM'S  REQUEST AND SHALL DETERMINE WHICH AREAS THE DEFENDANT SHALL BE
 PROHIBITED FROM ACCESSING. THE COURT SHALL INSTRUCT THE GLOBAL POSITION-
 ING SYSTEM TO NOTIFY THE PROPER AUTHORITIES IF  THE  DEFENDANT  VIOLATES
 THE ORDER. IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ORDER A DEFENDANT TO PARTICIPATE IN
 GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM MONITORING, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER THE LIKE-
 LIHOOD  THAT  THE DEFENDANT'S PARTICIPATION IN GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
 MONITORING WILL DETER THE DEFENDANT FROM  SEEKING  TO  KILL,  PHYSICALLY
 INJURE,  STALK,  OR  OTHERWISE  THREATEN  THE VICTIM PRIOR TO TRIAL. THE
 VICTIM MAY REQUEST THE COURT TO TERMINATE THE VICTIM'S PARTICIPATION  IN
 GLOBAL  POSITIONING  SYSTEM MONITORING OF THE DEFENDANT AT ANY TIME. THE
 COURT SHALL NOT IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THE VICTIM FOR REFUSING  TO  PARTIC-
 IPATE  IN  GLOBAL  POSITIONING  SYSTEM  MONITORING UNDER THIS SECTION. A
