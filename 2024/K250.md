  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 29, 2023, as Vietnam Veterans Day in the State
  of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of
  National Vietnam Veterans Day
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is custom of this Legislative Body that those who give
positive definition to the profile and disposition of the American Armed
Forces so profoundly strengthen our shared commitment in conjunction  to
the exercise of freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 29, 2023, as Vietnam
Veterans  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with the
observance of National Vietnam Veterans Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the Armed Forces from the State of New York, who
have so honorably served this State and Nation deserve a special  salute
from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of the men and women who served with dignity
and  honor  during  this  historic time-period, let us remember them and
thank them for their service; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than three million servicemen  and  women  left  their
families to bravely serve a world away in places such as La Drang to Khe
Sanh  from Hue to Saigon, and countless villages in between; they pushed
through jungles and  rice  paddies,  heat,  and  monsoons,  fighting  to
protect the ideals we hold dear as Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  more than a decade of combat, over air, land, and
sea, these proud Americans upheld the highest traditions of  the  United
States Armed Forces; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Vietnam War was fought in the Republic of South Vietnam
from  1955  to  1975,  and  involved North Vietnamese regular forces and
Vietnam Cong guerrilla forces in armed conflict with the  United  States
Armed Forces and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United States Armed Forces became involved in Vietnam
because the United States Government wanted to provide  direct  military
support  to  the  Government  of  Vietnam  to  defend itself against the
growing Communist threat from North Vietnam; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the United States Armed Forces began serving  in
an  advisory  role to the Government of the Republic of South Vietnam in
1955; and
 
  WHEREAS, As a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on  August  2nd
and 4th, 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law
88-408) on August 7, 1964, which provided the authority to the President
of the United States to prosecute the war against North Vietnam; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United States troops
in Vietnam, and by 1969, a peak  of  approximately  543,000  troops  was
reached; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which
required the release of all United States prisoners-of-war held in North
Vietnam and the withdrawal of all United States forces in South Vietnam;
and
 
  WHEREAS, On May 7, 1975, the last 2,500 troops were  withdrawn  from
South Vietnam, ending military involvement in the Vietnam War; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1984, the New York State Vietnam Veterans Memorial was
dedicated in Albany to commemorate those members of  the  United  States
Armed Forces who died or were declared missing-in-action in Vietnam, the
first state in the nation to dedicate a Vietnam Memorial; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chapter 90 of the Laws of 2008, designated March 29 of each
year  as  Vietnam  Veteran's  Day  in  the  State  of New York, a day of
commemoration to  honor  those  individuals  who  sacrificed  for  their
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Beginning  on  Memorial  Day  2012, the federal government
began a partnership with local governments, private  organizations,  and
communities  across  the  country to participate in the commemoration of
the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War, a 13-year program to honor  and
give thanks to a generation of proud Americans who saw a country through
one of the most challenging times; and
 
  WHEREAS,  May  28,  2012, through November 11, 2025, is known as the
Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War as declared  by
President Barack Obama, by Presidential Proclamation dated May 25, 2012;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  March  28, 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Vietnam
War Recognition Act of 2017; the measure amended Title 4 of  the  United
States  Code  to  encourage  the flying of the American Flag on National
Vietnam War Veterans Day every year on March 29th; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Blue Water Navy (BWN)  Vietnam  Veterans  Act  of  2019
(P.L.  116-23) was signed by President Trump on June 25, 2019, and took
effect on January 1, 2020; this  measure  extended  the  presumption  of
herbicide  exposure, such as Agent Orange, to veterans who served in the
offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962,  and
May 7, 1975; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pursuant  to Public Law 116-283 signed on January 1, 2021,
the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal  Year  2021,  Vietnam
veterans  exposed  to  Agent  Orange  who  have  been  diagnosed  with
Parkinson's,  Bladder  cancer,  and  Hypothyroidism,  will  be  deemed
service-connected and eligible for health care and compensation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  President  Joe Biden signed the Sergeant First Class Heath
Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act on  August  10,  2022,  (Public  Law  No.
117-168)  that  expanded the VA healthcare benefits for veterans exposed
to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances; and
 
  WHEREAS, The citizens of this great State and Nation, benefactors of
the sacrifices and courageous acts of the men and women who  served  and
continue to serve in the United States Armed Forces, remain indebted and
are  justly  proud  of  the Vietnam veterans from the State of New York,
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 29, 2023, as Vietnam
Veterans Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Vietnam Veterans Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pause further to encourage the
people of the State of New York to observe  Vietnam  Veterans  Day  with
appropriate  ceremonies  and  activities  that  provide the appreciation
Vietnam War veterans deserve but did not  receive  upon  returning  home
from  the  war;  to  demonstrate  the resolve that never again shall the
Nation disregard and denigrate a  generation  of  veterans;  to  promote
awareness  of  the  faithful  service and contributions of such veterans
during their  military  service  as  well  as  their  communities  since
returning  home;  to  promote  awareness of all the importance of entire
communities empowering veterans and the families of veterans to readjust
to civilian life after military service; and  to  promote  opportunities
for  such veterans to assist younger veterans returning from the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan  in  rehabilitation  from  wounds,  both  seen  and
unseen,  and  to  support  the  reintegration  of  younger veterans into
civilian life; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of  the  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; Ned Foote, President of the Vietnam Veterans of American New  York
State  Council;  and  Joseph  Pollicino, President of Tri County Council
