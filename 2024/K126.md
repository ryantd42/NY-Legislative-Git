  WHEREAS,  It is the practice of this Legislative Body to commemorate
historical events which exemplify the spirit  and  struggle  of  peoples
throughout  the  world  to  achieve  independence  and live in peace and
freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  February  2023,  as
Dominican  Heritage  Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the commemoration of the 179th Anniversary  of  Dominican  Independence;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The year 2023 marks the 179th Anniversary of an independent
Dominican state; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Dominican  people  proudly  trace their heritage back
hundreds  of  years  on  the  island  of  Hispaniola  as  indigenous
Quisqueyanos; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dominicans first arrived in the United States in 1613, with
the  arrival of Juan Rodriguez, who was also the very first immigrant to
New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS, Five thousand Dominicans arrived in New York  City  through
Ellis Island at the turn of the 20th Century; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dominicans are now the largest immigrant group in New York
City and  represent  approximately  30  percent  of  the  entire  Latino
population in the City of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  over two million Dominicans in the country and
over one million live in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dominicans  represent  the  largest  group  of  naturalized
citizens of all immigrant populations in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  we  recognize  the  numerous  contributions  of
Dominicans and Dominican Americans to our  great  State  adding  to  the
cultural and economic vibrancy of New York; Dominican leaders contribute
through  music,  literature,  cuisine,  fashion  and  design,  film  and
television, stage work, sports, education, and government and  politics;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout history and up to today, the Dominican people on
the  mainland  and abroad have exhibited an everlasting sense of bravery
in rising up against oppressors, with their national  anthem  exclaiming
Quisqueyanos as "brave and indomitable"; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
New Yorkers of Dominican descent for their enduring contributions to the
educational,  social,  moral  and economic principles that are so deeply
ingrained in the fabric of our country and State; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 179th Anniversary of the Independence of the  Dominican
Republic  provides an opportunity to recognize the significance of their
contributions to the quality and character of life, and, through  events
and  activities,  for  all  people  to  gain  a  greater appreciation of
Dominican history and  traditions,  and  of  the  role  Dominicans  have
played, and will continue to play, in our society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2023 as Dominican
Heritage  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
commemoration of the 179th Anniversary of Dominican Independence, and to
publicly encourage the citizens of New York to celebrate the history and
trajectory of Dominicans in the State, and to seek that New  Yorkers  of
Dominican  descent  see  themselves  represented  by  government,  their
influence reflected  on  our  streets,  and  their  ties  to  the  State
strengthened; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and various Dominican organizations in New York State.
