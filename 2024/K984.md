  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March  15,  2024,  as  Long  COVID  Education  and
  Awareness Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this Legislative Body to increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic,  New  Yorkers
have  shown  resilience,  strength, and a commitment to community health
and well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many individuals who have recovered from the acute phase of
COVID-19 continue to  suffer  from  lingering  and  debilitating  health
issues  known  as  "long  COVID"  or  post-acute  sequelae of SARS-CoV-2
infection (PASC); and
 
  WHEREAS, Long COVID is characterized by a  wide  range  of  symptoms
such  as  fatigue,  difficulty  breathing,  chest  pain,  cognitive
disruptions, and neurological  symptoms,  which  persist  for  weeks  or
months beyond the initial illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York  acknowledges  the necessity for
widespread education and awareness about long COVID and  the  importance
of  vaccinations  to  better  understand  and  combat the impact of this
condition; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dedicated education and awareness efforts are essential  to
inform  healthcare  providers,  educators,  employers,  and  the general
public about the realities of long COVID, the benefits  of  vaccination,
and to destigmatize the condition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  COVID-19  vaccines  have  played  a  critical role in
reducing the spread of the virus, preventing severe illness, and  saving
countless lives across our state and nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Vaccination  against  COVID-19 is an essential tool in our
public health arsenal to protect not only individuals  but  also  reduce
the  burden  on our healthcare system and mitigate the risk of long-term
complications associated with the virus, including long COVID; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that we support ongoing research into  the
long-term  effects of COVID-19, the development of effective treatments,
and the dissemination of resources to  assist  those  living  with  long
COVID,  while  also  emphasizing  the  importance  of  vaccinations  in
preventing the disease and its complications; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED That this Legislative Body  pause  in  its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim March 15, 2024, as Long
COVID Education and Awareness Day in the State of New  York  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
