 AN ACT in relation to authorizing Christine  Hasseler  to  apply  for  a
  recalculation of her retirement benefits
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any  provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,
 Christine  Hasseler,  who joined the New York state teachers' retirement
 system as a Tier 1 member on September 1, 1970, who  retired  from  such
 system on August 12, 2004, and who for reasons not ascribable to her own
 negligence,  did  not receive her retirement incentive payments from her
 employer by the deadline,  shall  have  her  final  average  salary  and
 pension benefit recalculated to include such payments, without regard to
 the  actual date of the receipt of such payments.  The increase in bene-
 fit will be payable retroactive to her date of retirement.
  § 2. All costs of implementing the provisions of  this  act  shall  be
 borne  by  the  employers  of  members  of  the New York state teachers'
 retirement system.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow Christine Hasseler, a retired Tier 1  member  of
 the  New  York  State  Teachers' Retirement System (NYSTRS), to have her
 pension benefit recalculated to include  retirement  incentive  payments
 she received regardless of when those retirement incentive payments were
 made.  Ms.  Hasseler's  pension  would  be recalculated with retroactive
 adjustment to payments made since her date of retirement of  August  12,
 2004.
  The cost of this benefit is equal to the increase in the present value
 of  liabilities  which  is  estimated  to be $65,000. This cost is to be
 borne by the employers of members of NYSTRS.
