  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 3-9, 2024, as Animal  Shelter  Appreciation
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Animal  shelters across New York and throughout the United
States care for and serve countless pets,  providing  aid  to  companion
animals and serving as vital resources to their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 3-9, 2024, as Animal  Shelter
Appreciation  Week  in  the  State  of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Animal Shelter Appreciation Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, In observance of November 3-9,  2024,  as  National  Animal
Shelter  Appreciation  Week,  animal  shelters  should be recognized for
serving as safe havens for pets who need to find new homes and providing
critical services while working to prevent cruelty to animals,  as  well
as caring for the health and well-being of the animals under their care;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition  to their direct care work of animals, animal
shelters  partner  closely  with  community  organizations  and  local
governments  to  manage  and ensure that lost pets, and pets that can no
longer remain in their first homes, are able to be placed  in  safe  and
supportive environments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Animal  shelters  in  New  York partner with animal rescue
groups and citizens who selflessly donate their own time  and  resources
to  assist  them  in their important work of caring for these vulnerable
pets; and
 
  WHEREAS, Helpless companion animals depend on  humans  to  intervene
when  their  conditions  are untenable, and to find them permanent homes
and veterinary care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Together we can support the work of animal shelters  across
New  York State as they work to improve the quality of life of companion
animals that need new homes or that are unable to stay in their  current
conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Spreading  awareness  and  showing our appreciation of the
efforts of the important and impactful work  of  animal  shelters  is  a
noble effort by this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
the important role  that  animal  shelters  play  in  keeping  companion
animals in our communities safe and cared-for, and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  must be done to increase support for animal shelters
at the local, State and national levels; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  express
appreciation  for  organizations and the people working within them that
 
serve to bring people  together  for  the  united  purpose  of  actively
pursuing improvements in their communities; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  November  3-9,  2024,  as
Animal  Shelter  Appreciation  Week  in the State of New York; and be it
