 Such standards and procedures may thereafter be changed or added  to  by
 the  council  only  upon the recommendation of the commissioner. For the
 purposes of ensuring that the health and  safety  of  the  residents  of
 hospitals  are not endangered, the council may promulgate changes in the
 minimum acceptable standards and  procedures  referred  to  herein  upon
 recommendation of the commissioner.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE COMMISSIONER
 SHALL  PROMULGATE  REGULATIONS REQUIRING THAT THE ADDITION OF, DECERTIF-
