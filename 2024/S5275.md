 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Investigations and Govern-
  ment Operations
 
 AN ACT to amend the tax law and the education law, in relation to educa-
  tion tax surcharge
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares that an omnibus education financing plan is essential to effec-
 tively and comprehensively provide a sound  basic  education  to  public
 school  students  in  the city of New York. The "emergency in education"
 surcharge tax, grounded in  the  need  to  provide  immediate,  adequate
 support  for  public  education in the city of New York, is such a plan.
 The plan recognizes and addresses several factors:  (1)  that  increased
 operating aid is necessary to ensure New York city students are prepared
 to  achieve the higher standards implemented by the New York state board
 of regents, (2) that the city of New York is  committed  to  shouldering
 its  "fair  share"  of  the  cost  of  educating  students in its public
 schools, and (3) that students currently attending public schools in the
 city of New York cannot afford to  wait  as  litigation  concerning  the
 state of New York's education financing system is decided by the courts.
 The  mayor  and  the city council have agreed that the financing program
 provided for in this act will provide the funds necessary  to  implement
 the  "emergency  in  education"  plan.  The state must authorize the new
 revenue sources requested by the city of New York to enable the city  to
 effectively educate public school students.
  §  2. The tax law is amended by adding a new section 1304-e to read as
 follows:
  § 1304-E. EMERGENCY IN EDUCATION TAX SURCHARGE. (A) IN ADDITION TO THE
 TAXES AUTHORIZED BY ANY OTHER SECTION OF THIS ARTICLE, ANY CITY IMPOSING
 SUCH TAXES IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED TO ADOPT AND  AMEND  LOCAL
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
