 AN ACT to amend the social services law, in relation to establishing the
  mothers and infants lasting change allowance
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as the "mothers
 and infants lasting change ("MILC") allowance".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares that child poverty in New York city and cities across New  York
 state  is  shamefully  high  and  will likely worsen if current economic
 trends continue. Half of the top six cities in the  United  States  with
 the highest child poverty rates are in New York state, disproportionate-
 ly affecting communities and children of color. In New York city, nearly
 1  in  4 children live in poverty. In Rochester and Buffalo, that number
 is even higher: 1 in 2 children live in poverty.
  The legislature hereby finds and declares that New Yorkers are  unable
 to cover their basic necessities and support their families, particular-
 ly in the face of rising interest rates and inflation. Most notably, the
 cost  of  childcare,  which already consumes a massive portion of family
 income, rose 41% during the pandemic, and the total cost  of  raising  a
 child  through  high  school has risen to more than $300,000, which is a
 $26,000 increase from five years ago and is likely to present a  heavier
 burden  for  low-income  parents  and families for whom expenses such as
 food, housing, and gas comprise an even larger portion of their income.
  The legislature  hereby  finds  and  declares  there  is  overwhelming
 evidence  that  the  prenatal-to-three  and  early childhood development

 period are critical for a child's future  prospects  and  affects  their
 physical,  mental,  emotional  and  social  outcomes  over a lifetime. A
 program targeting infants in this formative phase would help  break  the
 intergenerational cycle of poverty rather than attempting to mitigate it
 later  on,  creating  a  positive  impact on children's lives and saving
 government funds down the road.
  The legislature hereby finds and declares  it  is  proven  that  unre-
 stricted  cash is a direct and effective solution to alleviating poverty
 and meeting needs for families. This was shown on a national level  with
 the  overwhelming success of the expanded Child Tax Credit, which lifted
 millions of children out of poverty with its monthly payments and led to
 a 41% spike in child poverty the  first  month  it  expired.  The  unre-
 stricted  cash  intervention  further  proved  how  an investment in the
 earliest days of life can have multiplying effects: studies  have  found
 that  a  permanent expansion of the expanded Child Tax Credit would have
 generated 10 times as much revenue as it  cost.  New  York  state  has
 recently  made  a  commitment through the Child Poverty Reduction Act in
 December 2021 to reduce child poverty by 50%  over  the  course  of  ten
 years, with the support of the Child Poverty Reduction Advisory Council,
 and  there  is an opportunity for unrestricted cash to support this goal
 and help the state reach its target.
  Therefore, the legislature hereby finds and  declares  that  New  York
 state has an opportunity and obligation to invest in its most vulnerable
 residents  by leading the fight against childhood poverty, and toward an
 equitable economy for all,  through  a  guaranteed  income  program  for
 infants.
