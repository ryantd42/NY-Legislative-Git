 AMOUNT FOR A JOINT FILER AND  INFLATION  ADJUSTMENT  SPECIFIED  IN  SUCH
 SECTION  OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING IN TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE AND THEREAFTER.
  The  applicable percentage shall be (i) seven and one-half percent for
 taxable years  beginning  in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four,  (ii)  ten
 percent  for  taxable  years  beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-five,
 (iii) twenty percent for taxable years beginning after nineteen  hundred
 ninety-five  and  before  two  thousand,  (iv)  twenty-two  and one-half
 percent for taxable years beginning in  two  thousand,  (v)  twenty-five

 two, [and] (vii) thirty percent for taxable years beginning in two thou-
 sand  three,  (VIII)  THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING IN
 TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE, AND  (IX)  FORTY  PERCENT  FOR  TAXABLE  YEARS
 BEGINNING  IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX and thereafter.  FOR TAXABLE YEARS
 BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE AND THEREAFTER, IN THE CASE OF  AN
 ELIGIBLE  INDIVIDUAL  WITH NO QUALIFYING CHILDREN, THE CREDIT PERCENTAGE
 SHALL BE FIFTEEN AND THREE-TENTHS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE  EARNED
 INCOME TAX CREDIT REFERENCED IN SECTION 32(B)(1) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE
 CODE  AND THE EARNED INCOME AMOUNT AND THE PHASEOUT AMOUNT OF SUCH INDI-
 VIDUAL SHALL BE DETERMINED AS IF SUCH EARNED INCOME AMOUNT AND  PHASEOUT
 AMOUNT AS REFERENCED IN SECTION 32(B)(2)(A) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
 ARE  EQUAL  TO  THE  AMOUNT  ALLOWED FOR AN ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL WITH ONE
 QUALIFYING CHILD AS SUCH  AMOUNTS  ARE  REFERENCED  IN  SUCH  PARAGRAPH.
 PROVIDED  FURTHER, FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS SUBSECTION, AN ELIGIBLE INDI-
 VIDUAL SHALL BE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS ATTAINED NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE  AS
 OPPOSED  TO  TWENTY-FIVE  YEARS  OF AGE, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ELIGIBILITY
 REFERENCED IN SECTION 32(C)(1)(A)(II)(II) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE  CODE.
 FURTHERMORE,  AN  INDIVIDUAL  OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE BUT FOR THE REQUIREMENT
 UNDER SECTION 32(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SHALL BE  ELIGIBLE  FOR
 THIS  CREDIT. Provided, however, that if the reversion event, as defined
 in this paragraph, occurs, the applicable  percentage  shall  be  twenty
 percent  for  taxable  years  ending  on  or after the date on which the
 reversion event occurred. The reversion event shall be  deemed  to  have
 occurred  on the date on which federal action, including but not limited
 to, administrative, statutory or regulatory changes, materially  reduces
 or  eliminates  New  York  state's  allocation  of the federal temporary
 assistance for needy families block grant,  or  materially  reduces  the
 ability  of  the  state  to spend federal temporary assistance for needy
 families block grant funds for the earned  income  credit  or  to  apply
 state  general  fund  spending  on  the  earned income credit toward the
 temporary assistance for  needy  families  block  grant  maintenance  of
 effort  requirement, and the commissioner of the office of temporary and
 disability assistance shall certify  the  date  of  such  event  to  the

 the budget, the speaker of the assembly and the temporary  president  of
 the senate.

 SECTION 32(C)(1)(A)(II)(III) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AN INDIVIDUAL
 WHO IS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE EARNED INCOME CREDIT UNDER THIS
 SUBSECTION  SHALL  NOT  BE DEEMED INELIGIBLE DUE SOLELY TO THE FACT THAT
 SUCH INDIVIDUAL HAS ATTAINED THE AGE OF SIXTY-FIVE.
