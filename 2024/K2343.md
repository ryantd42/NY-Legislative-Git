  COMMEMORATING  the  40th  Anniversary  of  The
  Discovery Center of the Southern Tier
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  commend  those
illustrious  organizations  of  the  State  of  New York whose focus and
intent have made a substantial impact on the quality of  life  in  their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 40th Anniversary of The Discovery Center of the Southern
Tier; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Creating  the  first  hands-on  children's  museum  in the
Southern Tier,  the  Imagination  Builders  and  the  Junior  League  of
Binghamton  worked to fill a need in the community; The Discovery Center
of the Southern Tier was chartered  by  the  New  York  State  Education
Department in 1984 and officially opened its doors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Finding great success in the area, The Discovery Center of
the Southern Tier saw 10,000 guests by the end of the first  year  visit
the  museum; growing out of its space, the museum relocated to Ross Park
in Binghamton, New York from an urban school in 1987; and
 
  WHEREAS, Designed  to  capture  the  imagination  of  children,  The
Discovery  Center of the Southern Tier aims to create playful narratives
with caregivers and build safe spaces for children to play;  the  museum
plans  events,  celebrations,  field  trips, and performances to provide
in-depth opportunities for children to be inspired, enriched,  educated,
and to explore their world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Expanding  in  2008,  The Discovery Center of the Southern
Tier created Story Garden, an award-winning outdoor  exhibit  space;  it
was  designed  by  hundreds of volunteers alongside landscape architects
and features 15 storybook-themed  exhibit  spaces  that  are  individual
works  of art, over 20 sculptures crafted by local and regional artists,
an amphitheater for educational programming and theatrical  productions,
and hand-painted cultivated gardens to beautify the space; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Discovery Center of the Southern Tier has many hands-on
exhibits  that  are tastefully drawn and hand-painted with references to
local objects  and  educational  topics;  collections  focus  on  ethnic
materials, childhood memorabilia, and natural specimens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Serving  the  community  and known as the premier location
"where children play," The Discovery Center of the Southern Tier  serves
as  home  to  preschool,  afterschool,  and summer camp programming; the
arts-integrated curriculum focuses on social and  emotional  health  and
allows  for  the  full  development  of  children  to build their unique
talents and interests,  which  often  cannot  be  found  in  a  standard
classroom setting; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  its  distinguished  40-year  history,  The Discovery
Center of the Southern Tier has demonstrated continuous service  to  the
residents and communities which it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of The Discovery Center of the Southern Tier is
in  direct  correlation  to  the  efforts of its Executive Director, Dr.
Brenda Myers, and its dedicated staff, whose involvement are, and always
have been, characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate the 40th Anniversary of The Discovery Center of the Southern
Tier; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Discovery Center of the Southern Tier.
