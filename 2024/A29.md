 SECTION 100.40 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW AND THERE EXISTS REASONABLE
 CAUSE  TO  BELIEVE  THAT  THE  HOLDER  OPERATED A VESSEL IN VIOLATION OF
 SUBDIVISION THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX OR SEVEN OF SECTION SEVENTY-NINE-D OF

 VIOLATION  UNDER  SUCH SECTION SEVENTY-NINE-D OF THIS ARTICLE WITHIN THE
 PRECEDING FIVE YEARS; OR (2) THAT THE HOLDER COMMITTED A VIOLATION OF  A
 FELONY  UNDER  ARTICLE  ONE HUNDRED TWENTY OR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE OF
 THE PENAL LAW. AT SUCH TIME THE HOLDER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO AN  OPPORTU-
 NITY  TO MAKE A STATEMENT REGARDING THE ENUMERATED ISSUES AND TO PRESENT
 EVIDENCE TENDING TO REBUT THE COURT'S FINDINGS. WHERE SUCH SUSPENSION IS
 IMPOSED UPON A PENDING CHARGE OF A VIOLATION OF A FELONY  UNDER  ARTICLE

  (D)  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  CONTRARY  PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER, IF ANY
 SUSPENSION OCCURRING UNDER THIS SUBPARAGRAPH HAS BEEN IN  EFFECT  FOR  A
 PERIOD  OF THIRTY DAYS, THE HOLDER MAY BE ISSUED A CONDITIONAL PRIVILEGE
 TO OPERATE A VESSEL, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION SEVENTY-NINE-J  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE,  PROVIDED THE HOLDER OF SUCH PRIVILEGE IS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE TO
 RECEIVE SUCH  CONDITIONAL  PRIVILEGE.  A  CONDITIONAL  PRIVILEGE  ISSUED

 A FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE COMMISSIONER. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS  CLAUSE,
 "EXTREME  HARDSHIP" SHALL MEAN THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE MEANS
 OF TRAVEL TO OR FROM THE HOLDER'S EMPLOYMENT, OR TO  OR  FROM  NECESSARY
 MEDICAL  TREATMENT FOR THE HOLDER OR A MEMBER OF THE HOLDER'S HOUSEHOLD.
 THE BURDEN OF PROVING EXTREME HARDSHIP SHALL BE ON THE  HOLDER  WHO  MAY
 PRESENT  MATERIAL  AND RELEVANT EVIDENCE.  A FINDING OF EXTREME HARDSHIP
 MAY NOT BE BASED SOLELY UPON THE TESTIMONY OF THE HOLDER.  IN  NO  EVENT
 SHALL  ARRAIGNMENT  BE  ADJOURNED  OR  OTHERWISE DELAYED MORE THAN THREE
 BUSINESS DAYS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ALLOWING THE HOLDER  TO  PRESENT
 EVIDENCE  OF  EXTREME  HARDSHIP.  THE  COURT  SHALL SET FORTH UPON THE
 RECORD, OR OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN WRITING, THE FACTUAL  BASIS  FOR  SUCH
 FINDING.  THE  HARDSHIP PRIVILEGE SHALL PERMIT THE OPERATION OF A VESSEL
 ONLY FOR TRAVEL TO OR FROM THE HOLDER'S EMPLOYMENT, OR TO OR FROM NECES-
 SARY MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR THE HOLDER OR A MEMBER OF THE HOLDER'S HOUSE-

 APPEARANCE OF ANY PERSON UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE WHO RESIDES  WITHIN
 THE  HOUSEHOLD  OF  HIS  OR  HER  PARENT  OR GUARDIAN UPON A CHARGE OF A
 VIOLATION  OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO,  THREE  AND/OR  FIVE  OF  SECTION
 SEVENTY-NINE-D  OF  THIS  ARTICLE, THE LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT BEFORE WHICH
 SUCH FIRST APPEARANCE IS  SCHEDULED  SHALL  FORTHWITH  TRANSMIT  WRITTEN
 NOTICE  OF  SUCH  APPEARANCE  OR  FAILURE TO MAKE SUCH APPEARANCE TO THE
 PARENT OR GUARDIAN OF SUCH MINOR PERSON; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT  IF  AN
 ARRAIGNMENT  AND  CONVICTION OF SUCH PERSON FOLLOWS SUCH APPEARANCE UPON
 THE SAME DAY, OR IN CASE SUCH PERSON WAIVES  ARRAIGNMENT  AND  ENTERS  A
 PLEA  OF  GUILTY  TO  THE  OFFENSE  AS  CHARGED  IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE
 PROVISIONS OF SECTION EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FIVE OF THE VEHICLE  AND  TRAFFIC
 LAW,  TRANSMITTAL  OF  NOTICE  OF  HIS  OR HER CONVICTION AS PROVIDED IN
 SECTION FIVE HUNDRED FOURTEEN OF THE VEHICLE AND TRAFFIC  LAW  SHALL  BE
 SUFFICIENT  AND THE NOTICE REQUIRED BY THIS PARAGRAPH NEED NOT BE GIVEN;
 PROVIDED FURTHER THAT THE FAILURE OF A LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT TO  TRANSMIT
 THE  NOTICE  REQUIRED  BY  THIS  PARAGRAPH SHALL IN NO MANNER AFFECT THE
 VALIDITY OF A CONVICTION SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAINED.
  § 79-G. ARREST AND TESTING. 1. ARREST AND FIELD TESTING.  (A)  ARREST.
 NOTWITHSTANDING  THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 140.10 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCE-
 DURE LAW, A POLICE OFFICER MAY, WITHOUT A WARRANT, ARREST A  PERSON,  IN
 CASE OF A VIOLATION OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION SEVENTY-NINE-D OF THIS
 ARTICLE,  IF  SUCH VIOLATION IS COUPLED WITH AN ACCIDENT OR COLLISION IN
 WHICH SUCH PERSON IS INVOLVED, WHICH IN FACT HAS BEEN COMMITTED,  THOUGH
 NOT  IN  THE  POLICE OFFICER'S PRESENCE, WHEN THE OFFICER HAS REASONABLE
 CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE VIOLATION WAS COMMITTED BY SUCH PERSON.
  (B) FIELD TESTING. EVERY PERSON OPERATING  A  VESSEL  WHICH  HAS  BEEN
 INVOLVED  IN AN ACCIDENT OR WHICH IS OPERATED IN VIOLATION OF ANY OF THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS CHAPTER SHALL, AT THE REQUEST OF  A  POLICE  OFFICER,
 SUBMIT  TO  A  BREATH  TEST TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE POLICE OFFICER. IF
 SUCH TEST INDICATES THAT SUCH OPERATOR HAS CONSUMED ALCOHOL, THE  POLICE
 OFFICER  MAY  REQUEST  SUCH OPERATOR TO SUBMIT TO A CHEMICAL TEST IN THE
 MANNER SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION.
  2. CHEMICAL TESTS. (A) WHEN AUTHORIZED.  ANY  PERSON  WHO  OPERATES  A
 VESSEL IN THIS STATE SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE GIVEN CONSENT TO A CHEMICAL
 TEST  OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:  BREATH, BLOOD, URINE, OR SALIVA,
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE ALCOHOLIC AND/OR DRUG CONTENT OF  THE
 BLOOD  PROVIDED THAT SUCH TEST IS ADMINISTERED BY OR AT THE DIRECTION OF
 A POLICE OFFICER WITH RESPECT TO A CHEMICAL TEST  OF  BREATH,  URINE  OR
 SALIVA OR, WITH RESPECT TO A CHEMICAL TEST OF BLOOD, AT THE DIRECTION OF
 A POLICE OFFICER:
  (1)  HAVING  REASONABLE  GROUNDS  TO  BELIEVE SUCH PERSON TO HAVE BEEN
 OPERATING IN VIOLATION OF ANY SUBDIVISION OF SECTION  SEVENTY-NINE-D  OF
 THIS  ARTICLE  AND  WITHIN  TWO  HOURS AFTER SUCH PERSON HAS BEEN PLACED
 UNDER ARREST FOR ANY SUCH VIOLATION; OR  HAVING  REASONABLE  GROUNDS  TO
 BELIEVE  SUCH  PERSON  TO  HAVE  BEEN  OPERATING IN VIOLATION OF SECTION
 SEVENTY-NINE-E OF THIS ARTICLE AND WITHIN TWO HOURS AFTER  THE  STOP  OF
 SUCH PERSON FOR ANY SUCH VIOLATION;
  (2) WITHIN TWO HOURS AFTER A BREATH TEST, AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (B)
 OF  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION, INDICATES THAT ALCOHOL HAS BEEN
 CONSUMED BY SUCH PERSON AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
 ESTABLISHED BY THE POLICE FORCE OF WHICH THE OFFICER IS A MEMBER;
  (3) FOR THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  PARAGRAPH,  "REASONABLE  GROUNDS"  TO
 BELIEVE  THAT A PERSON HAS BEEN OPERATING A VESSEL AFTER HAVING CONSUMED
 A. 29  21
 
 ALCOHOL IN VIOLATION OF SECTION SEVENTY-NINE-E OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL  BE
 DETERMINED  BY  VIEWING  THE  TOTALITY  OF CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE
 INCIDENT WHICH, WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER,  INDICATE  THAT  THE  OPERATOR  WAS
 OPERATING  A VESSEL IN VIOLATION OF SUCH SUBDIVISION. SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
 MAY INCLUDE ANY VISIBLE OR BEHAVIORAL INDICATION OF ALCOHOL  CONSUMPTION
 BY THE OPERATOR, THE EXISTENCE OF AN OPEN CONTAINER CONTAINING OR HAVING
 CONTAINED  AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE IN OR AROUND THE VESSEL OPERATED BY THE
 OPERATOR, OR ANY OTHER EVIDENCE SURROUNDING  THE  CIRCUMSTANCES  OF  THE
 INCIDENT  WHICH  INDICATES THAT THE OPERATOR HAS BEEN OPERATING A VESSEL
 AFTER HAVING CONSUMED ALCOHOL AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; OR
  (4) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,  NO
 PERSON  UNDER  THE  AGE  OF  TWENTY-ONE SHALL BE ARRESTED FOR AN ALLEGED
 VIOLATION OF SECTION SEVENTY-NINE-E OF THIS ARTICLE. HOWEVER,  A  PERSON
 UNDER  THE  AGE  OF  TWENTY-ONE  FOR  WHOM A CHEMICAL TEST IS AUTHORIZED
 PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE TEMPORARILY  DETAINED  BY  THE  POLICE
 SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF REQUESTING OR ADMINISTERING SUCH CHEMICAL TEST
 WHENEVER  ARREST  WITHOUT A WARRANT FOR A PETTY OFFENSE WOULD BE AUTHOR-
 IZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 140.10 OF THE CRIMINAL
 PROCEDURE LAW OR PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION.
  (B) REPORT OF REFUSAL. (1) IF: (A)  SUCH  PERSON  HAVING  BEEN  PLACED
 UNDER ARREST; OR (B) AFTER A BREATH TEST INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF ALCO-
 HOL IN THE PERSON'S SYSTEM; OR (C) WITH REGARD TO A PERSON UNDER THE AGE
 OF  TWENTY-ONE, THERE ARE REASONABLE GROUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH PERSON
 HAS BEEN OPERATING A VESSEL AFTER HAVING CONSUMED ALCOHOL  IN  VIOLATION
 OF  SECTION  SEVENTY-NINE-E  OF THIS ARTICLE; AND HAVING THEREAFTER BEEN
 REQUESTED TO SUBMIT TO SUCH CHEMICAL TEST AND HAVING BEEN INFORMED  THAT
 THE  PERSON'S PRIVILEGE TO OPERATE A VESSEL AND ANY NON-RESIDENT OPERAT-
 ING PRIVILEGE SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED AND  SUBSEQUENTLY  REVOKED,
 OR, FOR OPERATORS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY-ONE FOR WHOM THERE ARE REASON-
 ABLE  GROUNDS  TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH OPERATOR HAS BEEN OPERATING A VESSEL
 AFTER HAVING CONSUMED ALCOHOL IN VIOLATION OF SECTION SEVENTY-NINE-E  OF

 THE  SCHEDULED  HEARING  SHALL  CONSTITUTE  A  WAIVER  OF  SUCH HEARING,
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH PERSON MAY  PETITION  THE  COMMISSIONER  OF
 MOTOR  VEHICLES FOR A NEW HEARING WHICH SHALL BE HELD AS SOON AS PRACTI-
 CABLE.  THE RESULTS OF ALL HEARINGS SHALL BE REFERRED TO THE COMMISSION-
