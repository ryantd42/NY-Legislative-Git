 tain such a memorial may apply for funding under section  99-rr  of  the
 state  finance  law  as  well  as from other public and private sources,
 including but not limited to grants, donations,  and  partnerships.  The
 final  designs and locations of such memorials shall be selected through
 a community-driven process overseen by municipal parks departments, with
 specific guidance from the office of  parks,  recreation,  and  historic
 preservation,  and  with  financial  oversight  from  the  comptroller's
 office.  The final designs and locations of such memorials shall  prior-
 itize input from those most impacted, including but not limited to fami-
 ly members and loved ones of victims of COVID-19.
