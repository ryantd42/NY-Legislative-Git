long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of  Blind  Brook  High  School  of  Rye

  WHEREAS,  The  steadfast  and  unyielding  commitment  of  parents,
educators, and administrators to provide the highest  quality  education
for  students  has  become the hallmark and tradition of the Blind Brook
School District; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within the 21st century, Blind  Brook  High  School  stands
prepared to reach out, in earnest and enthusiastic quest of its mission,
to  promote  the maximum growth of every student, establishing standards
and building skills which will carry its students and  the  citizens  of
its community into the future; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1973, Blind Brook Jr./Sr. High School opened its doors
as a Grade 7-10 school, adding 11th grade in  1974  and  12th  grade  in
1975;  the  school  graduated  its  first  full class in 1976, with four
students graduating early in 1975; and
 
  WHEREAS, Truly a pioneer in progressive education, Blind Brook  High
School  was  formed with the ideals of democracy, community, commitment,
and collaboration at the forefront of all its endeavors; and
 
  WHEREAS, These guiding principles manifest themselves in the  nature
of  the  building's  original  open floor plan, in the local community's
involvement in the establishing of  the  school's  colors,  mascot,  and
traditions,  as  well as in the way students participate in a variety of
extracurricular activities and athletics; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the early 2000s, Blind Brook High School was defined  as
a grades 9-12 school, with the middle school serving grades 6-8; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  school  proudly  growing  in number of students
enrolled, there have been significant physical upgrades  and  expansions
at  Blind  Brook High School; additional classrooms and a cafeteria were
added in the early 2000s, and more recently, the school's Fab Lab  space
was  created  with  the  intention  of providing space for ingenuity and
design, allowing synergy between technology and other content areas; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success  of  Blind  Brook  High  School  is  in  direct
correlation  to the efforts of its esteemed educators and staff members,
whose  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an
impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
 
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf  of  the  institution,
students, and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Blind  Brook  High  School  is  proudly  aware of its
distinguished past, eager to fulfill its present commitment to  parents,
students,  and  the  community, and planning with vision and purpose for
the ebb and flow of growth and change it will encounter in the years  to
come; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of  Blind  Brook  High  School  of  Rye
