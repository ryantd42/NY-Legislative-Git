 sions,  and  deaths. According to the New York City Office of the Mayor,
 each year there are an estimated 450 heat-related ED visits,  150  heat-
 related hospital admissions, 10 heat-stroke deaths, and 350 heat-exacer-
 bated deaths, caused by heat worsening existing chronic conditions.
  The legislature hereby finds and declares that the government is obli-
 gated to ensure that employers provide safe conditions for their employ-
 ees.
