  WHEREAS, The adoration Josephine and  Leonard  Spano  had  for  each

married for 67 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Josephine  Spano,  the  matriarch  of  the  Spano  family,

Heart,  supporter  of  special  needs  children and a volunteer for many
charitable causes; and
 
  WHEREAS, The unity of  our  State  and  Nation  is  built  upon  the
