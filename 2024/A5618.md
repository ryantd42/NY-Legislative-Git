 gated  pursuant  to  subdivision  one of this section. At least ten days

  4.  If  the secretary determines that a local government has failed to

 accordance  with  the minimum standards promulgated pursuant to subdivi-
 sion one of this section, the secretary shall take any of the  following

 of  the  secretary  an action or proceeding seeking appropriate legal or
 equitable relief to require such  local  government  to  administer  and
 enforce the uniform code.
  c.  [the]  THE  secretary may designate the county in which such local

 local government. In the case of such  designation,  the  provisions  of
 subdivision five of this section shall apply.

 administer and enforce the uniform code in accordance with  the  minimum
 standards  promulgated  pursuant  to subdivision one of this section. In
 such event, the provisions of subdivision five  of  this  section  shall
 apply.

 UNWILLING  TO  ADMINISTER  AND  ENFORCE THE UNIFORM CODE PURSUANT TO THE
 MINIMUM STANDARDS  AND  THE  SECRETARY'S  INVESTIGATION  OF  SUCH  LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT  WAS INITIATED BY AN OFFICIAL NOTICE FROM THE COUNTY IN WHICH
 SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS LOCATED, AND IF THE COUNTY HAS  REQUESTED  THAT
 THE SECRETARY DESIGNATE THE COUNTY TO ADMINISTER AND ENFORCE THE UNIFORM
 CODE  IN SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE SECRETARY SHALL DESIGNATE THE COUNTY
 IN WHICH SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS LOCATED TO ADMINISTER AND ENFORCE  THE
 UNIFORM  CODE  IN  SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNLESS THE SECRETARY FINDS THAT
 THE COUNTY WOULD BE INCAPABLE OF ASSUMING THE RESPONSIBILITIES.
  § 2. Subdivision 5 of section 381 of the executive law is  amended  by
 adding a new paragraph e to read as follows:
  E.  AFTER  AT  LEAST  EIGHTEEN MONTHS FROM SUCH DESIGNATION, THE LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT MAY PETITION THE SECRETARY TO REASSUME AUTHORITY FOR  UNIFORM
 FIRE PREVENTION AND BUILDING CODE ENFORCEMENT. TO REASSUME AUTHORITY FOR
 UNIFORM FIRE PREVENTION AND BUILDING CODE ENFORCEMENT, THE LOCAL GOVERN-
 MENT  SHALL  DEMONSTRATE  TO  THE SATISFACTION OF THE SECRETARY THAT THE
 CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO ITS PRIOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATION  AND
 ENFORCEMENT  OF  THE  UNIFORM  FIRE  PREVENTION  AND  BUILDING CODE THAT
 COMPLIES WITH THE MINIMUM STANDARDS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO  SUBDIVISION
 ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION ARE NO LONGER PRESENT AND THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO
 PROPERLY ADMINISTER AND ENFORCE THE CODE.
