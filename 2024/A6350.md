 Introduced by M. of A. WEPRIN -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Insurance
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  insurance  law, in relation to establishing the
  interstate insurance product regulation compact  to  regulate  certain
  insurance products
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent.  An interstate compact  is
 a  contract  between  the states that allows them to cooperate on multi-
 state or national issues while still retaining state control. Interstate
 compacts are specifically mentioned in the U.S.  Constitution  and  have
 been  historically used to address border disputes and water rights. The
 use of interstate compacts has expanded significantly in recent  decades
 to  cover tax, motor vehicle licensing, environmental, emergency manage-
 ment and other issues. Over 200 interstate compacts currently exist, and
 on average every state belongs to at least 25 compacts.  The  Interstate
 Insurance  Product Regulation Compact, which to date has been adopted by
 44 member states, representing approximately two-thirds of  the  premium
 volume  in  the  nation,  created the Interstate Insurance Product Regu-
 lation Commission (IIPRC). The IIPRC provides the States with a  vehicle
 to  (1)  develop  uniform  national product standards that will afford a
 high level of protection to  consumers  of  life  insurance,  annuities,
 disability income and long-term care insurance products; (2) establish a
 central point of filing for these insurance products; and (3) thoroughly
 review  product  filings  and make regulatory decisions according to the
 uniform product standards.  The  IIPRC  is  an  important  modernization
 initiative  that benefits state insurance regulators, consumers, and the
 insurance industry. The Compact enhances the efficiency  and  effective-
 ness  of  the  way  insurance products are filed, reviewed, and approved
 allowing insurance customers to have faster access to competitive insur-
 ance products  in  an  ever-changing  global  marketplace.  The  Compact

 promotes  uniformity  through  application  of uniform product standards
 embedded with strong consumer protections.  The state of New York  seeks
 to  join with other states as a member of the Interstate Insurance Prod-
 uct Regulation Compact and Commission.

  (B) RULES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES SHALL BE MADE PURSUANT  TO  A  RULE
 MAKING  PROCESS  THAT CONFORMS TO THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT
 OF 1981 AS AMENDED, AS MAY BE  APPROPRIATE  TO  THE  OPERATIONS  OF  THE
 COMMISSION. BEFORE THE COMMISSION ADOPTS A UNIFORM STANDARD, THE COMMIS-
 SION SHALL GIVE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE RELEVANT STATE LEGISLATIVE COMMIT-
 TEE  IN  EACH  COMPACTING  STATE RESPONSIBLE FOR INSURANCE ISSUES OF ITS
 INTENTION TO ADOPT SUCH UNIFORM STANDARD. THE COMMISSION IN  ADOPTING  A
 UNIFORM  STANDARD SHALL CONSIDER FULLY ALL SUBMITTED MATERIALS AND ISSUE
 A CONCISE EXPLANATION OF ITS DECISION.
  (C) A UNIFORM STANDARD SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE NINETY  DAYS  AFTER  ITS
 PROMULGATION  BY THE COMMISSION OR SUCH LATER DATE AS THE COMMISSION MAY
 DETERMINE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT A COMPACTING STATE MAY OPT OUT  OF  A
 UNIFORM STANDARD AS PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE. "OPT OUT" SHALL BE DEFINED
 AS  ANY  ACTION BY A COMPACTING STATE TO DECLINE TO ADOPT OR PARTICIPATE
 IN A PROMULGATED UNIFORM STANDARD. ALL OTHER RULES AND OPERATING  PROCE-
 DURES,  AND  AMENDMENTS  THERETO,  SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE AS OF THE DATE
 SPECIFIED IN EACH RULE, OPERATING PROCEDURE OR AMENDMENT.
  (D) A COMPACTING STATE MAY OPT OUT OF A UNIFORM  STANDARD,  EITHER  BY
 LEGISLATION  OR  REGULATION DULY PROMULGATED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT UNDER
 THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT. IF A COMPACTING STATE ELECTS  TO
 OPT OUT OF A UNIFORM STANDARD BY REGULATION, IT MUST GIVE WRITTEN NOTICE
 TO  THE  COMMISSION  NO  LATER  THAN TEN BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE UNIFORM
 STANDARD IS PROMULGATED OR AT THE TIME THE STATE  BECOMES  A  COMPACTING
 STATE,  AND  FIND  THAT THE UNIFORM STANDARD DOES NOT PROVIDE REASONABLE
 PROTECTIONS TO THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE GIVEN  THE  CONDITIONS  IN  THE
 STATE.  THE  SUPERINTENDENT  SHALL  MAKE  SPECIFIC  FINDINGS OF FACT AND
 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, BASED ON A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE,  DETAILING
 THE  CONDITIONS  IN THE STATE WHICH WARRANT A DEPARTURE FROM THE UNIFORM
 STANDARD AND DETERMINING THAT THE UNIFORM STANDARD WOULD NOT  REASONABLY
 PROTECT  THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE. THE SUPERINTENDENT MUST CONSIDER AND
 BALANCE THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AND FIND THAT THE CONDITIONS IN THE  STATE
 AND NEEDS OF THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OUTWEIGH:
  (1)  THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PARTICIPATE IN, AND THE BENEFITS
 OF, AN INTERSTATE  AGREEMENT  TO  ESTABLISH  NATIONAL  UNIFORM  CONSUMER
 PROTECTIONS FOR THE PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO THIS ARTICLE; AND
  (2)  THE PRESUMPTION THAT A UNIFORM STANDARD ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION
 PROVIDES REASONABLE PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS OF THE RELEVANT PRODUCT.
  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, A COMPACTING STATE MAY, AT THE TIME  OF
 ITS ENACTMENT OF THE COMPACT, PROSPECTIVELY OPT OUT OF ALL UNIFORM STAN-
 DARDS  INVOLVING  THE  LONG-TERM  CARE  INSURANCE  PRODUCTS BY EXPRESSLY
 PROVIDING FOR SUCH OPT OUT IN THE ENACTED  COMPACT,  AND  SUCH  OPT  OUT
 SHALL  NOT  BE TREATED AS A MATERIAL VARIANCE IN THE OFFER OR ACCEPTANCE
 OF ANY STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPACT. SUCH AN  OPT  OUT  SHALL  BE
 EFFECTIVE  AT  THE  TIME  OF  ENACTMENT OF THE COMPACT BY THE COMPACTING
 A. 6350  10

 STATE AND SHALL APPLY TO ALL EXISTING UNIFORM STANDARDS INVOLVING  LONG-
 TERM CARE INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THOSE SUBSEQUENTLY PROMULGATED.
  (E) IF A COMPACTING STATE ELECTS TO OPT OUT OF A UNIFORM STANDARD, THE
 UNIFORM  STANDARD SHALL REMAIN APPLICABLE IN THE COMPACTING STATE ELECT-
 ING TO OPT OUT UNTIL SUCH TIME THE OPT OUT LEGISLATION IS  ENACTED  INTO
 LAW OR THE REGULATION IS PROMULGATED.
  (F)  ONCE  THE  OPT  OUT  OF  A UNIFORM STANDARD BY A COMPACTING STATE
 BECOMES EFFECTIVE AS PROVIDED UNDER THE LAWS OF THAT STATE, THE  UNIFORM
 STANDARD SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER FORCE AND EFFECT IN THAT STATE UNLESS AND
 UNTIL THE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION IMPLEMENTING THE OPT OUT IS REPEALED
 OR  OTHERWISE  BECOMES  INEFFECTIVE  UNDER  THE  LAWS OF THE STATE. IF A
 COMPACTING STATE OPTS OUT OF A UNIFORM STANDARD AFTER THE UNIFORM STAND-
 ARD HAS BEEN MADE EFFECTIVE IN THAT STATE, THE OPT OUT  SHALL  HAVE  THE
 SAME  PROSPECTIVE  EFFECT  AS  PROVIDED UNDER SECTION EIGHT THOUSAND TWO
 HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE FOR WITHDRAWALS.
  (G) IF A COMPACTING STATE HAS FORMALLY INITIATED THE PROCESS OF OPTING
 OUT OF A UNIFORM STANDARD BY REGULATION, AND WHILE  THE  REGULATORY  OPT
 OUT  IS  PENDING,  THE  COMPACTING STATE MAY PETITION THE COMMISSION, AT
 LEAST FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE UNIFORM STANDARD, TO
 STAY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF  THE  UNIFORM  STANDARD  IN  THAT  STATE.  THE
 COMMISSION  MAY  GRANT A STAY IF IT DETERMINES THE REGULATORY OPT OUT IS
 BEING PURSUED IN A REASONABLE  MANNER  AND  THERE  IS  A  LIKELIHOOD  OF
 SUCCESS. IF A STAY IS GRANTED OR EXTENDED BY THE COMMISSION, THE STAY OR
 EXTENSION  THEREOF MAY POSTPONE THE EFFECTIVE DATE BY UP TO NINETY DAYS,
 UNLESS AFFIRMATIVELY EXTENDED BY THE  COMMISSION;  PROVIDED  HOWEVER,  A
 STAY  MAY  NOT  BE  PERMITTED TO REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR
 UNLESS THE COMPACTING STATE CAN SHOW EXTRAORDINARY  CIRCUMSTANCES  WHICH
 WARRANT  A  CONTINUANCE  OF  THE STAY INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL CHALLENGE WHICH PREVENTS THE COMPACTING STATE  FROM
 OPTING  OUT. A STAY MAY BE TERMINATED BY THE COMMISSION UPON NOTICE THAT
 THE RULE MAKING PROCESS HAS BEEN TERMINATED.
  (H) NOT LATER THAN THIRTY DAYS AFTER A RULE OR OPERATING PROCEDURE  IS
 PROMULGATED,  ANY  PERSON MAY FILE A PETITION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE
 RULE OR OPERATING PROCEDURE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FILING OF  SUCH
 A  PETITION  SHALL  NOT  STAY OR OTHERWISE PREVENT THE RULE OR OPERATING
 PROCEDURE FROM BECOMING EFFECTIVE UNLESS THE COURT FINDS THAT THE  PETI-
 TIONER  HAS  A  SUBSTANTIAL  LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS. THE COURT SHALL GIVE
 DEFERENCE TO THE ACTIONS OF THE COMMISSION  CONSISTENT  WITH  APPLICABLE
 LAW AND SHALL NOT FIND THE RULE OR OPERATING PROCEDURE TO BE UNLAWFUL IF
 THE  RULE OR OPERATING PROCEDURE REPRESENTS A REASONABLE EXERCISE OF THE
 COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY.
  § 8209. COMMISSION RECORDS AND ENFORCEMENT. (A) THE  COMMISSION  SHALL
 PROMULGATE  RULES  ESTABLISHING  CONDITIONS  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR PUBLIC
 INSPECTION AND COPYING OF ITS INFORMATION AND OFFICIAL  RECORDS,  EXCEPT
 SUCH  INFORMATION  AND  RECORDS INVOLVING THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS AND
 INSURERS' TRADE SECRETS. THE COMMISSION MAY PROMULGATE ADDITIONAL  RULES
 UNDER WHICH IT MAY MAKE AVAILABLE TO FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, INCLUD-
 ING  LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, RECORDS AND INFORMATION OTHERWISE EXEMPT
 FROM DISCLOSURE, AND MAY ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS  WITH  SUCH  AGENCIES  TO
 RECEIVE  OR EXCHANGE INFORMATION OR RECORDS SUBJECT TO NONDISCLOSURE AND
 CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS.
  (B) EXCEPT AS TO PRIVILEGED RECORDS, DATA AND INFORMATION, THE LAWS OF
 ANY COMPACTING STATE  PERTAINING  TO  CONFIDENTIALITY  OR  NONDISCLOSURE
 SHALL  NOT  RELIEVE  ANY  COMPACTING  STATE  COMMISSIONER OF THE DUTY TO
 DISCLOSE ANY RELEVANT RECORDS, DATA OR INFORMATION  TO  THE  COMMISSION;
 PROVIDED  HOWEVER, THAT DISCLOSURE TO THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED
 A. 6350  11
 
 TO WAIVE  OR  OTHERWISE  AFFECT  ANY  CONFIDENTIALITY  REQUIREMENT;  AND
 PROVIDED  FURTHER  THAT,  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS
 ARTICLE, THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF ANY COMPACT-
 ING  STATE  PERTAINING TO CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE WITH RESPECT
 TO RECORDS, DATA AND INFORMATION IN ITS POSSESSION. CONFIDENTIAL  INFOR-
 MATION  OF  THE COMMISSION SHALL REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL AFTER SUCH INFORMA-
 TION IS PROVIDED TO ANY COMMISSIONER.
  (C) THE COMMISSION SHALL MONITOR COMPACTING STATES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH
 DULY ADOPTED BY-LAWS, RULES, INCLUDING UNIFORM STANDARDS, AND  OPERATING
 PROCEDURES.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  NOTIFY SUCH NONCOMPLYING COMPACTING
 STATE IN WRITING OF ITS NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COMMISSION BY-LAWS, RULES  OR
 OPERATING  PROCEDURES.  IF  THE  NONCOMPLYING  COMPACTING STATE FAILS TO
 REMEDY SUCH NONCOMPLIANCE WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED  IN  THE  NOTICE  OF
 NONCOMPLIANCE,  THE COMPACTING STATE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE IN DEFAULT AS
 SET FORTH IN SECTION EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE.
  (D) THE COMMISSIONER OF ANY STATE IN WHICH AN INSURER IS AUTHORIZED TO
 DO BUSINESS, OR IS CONDUCTING THE BUSINESS OF INSURANCE, SHALL  CONTINUE
 TO EXERCISE HIS OR HER AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE THE MARKET REGULATION OF THE
 ACTIVITIES  OF  THE  INSURER  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE
 STATE'S LAW. THE  COMMISSIONER'S  ENFORCEMENT  OF  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE
 COMPACT IS GOVERNED BY THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS:
  (1)  WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMISSIONER'S MARKET REGULATION OF A PRODUCT
 OR ADVERTISEMENT THAT IS APPROVED OR CERTIFIED BY  THE  COMMISSION,  THE
 CONTENT OF THE PRODUCT OR ADVERTISEMENT SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION
 OF  THE PROVISIONS, STANDARDS OR REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPACT EXCEPT UPON
 A FINAL ORDER OF THE COMMISSION, ISSUED AT THE REQUEST OF A COMMISSIONER
 AFTER PRIOR NOTICE TO THE INSURER AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING  BEFORE
 THE COMMISSION.
  (2)  BEFORE  A  COMMISSIONER  MAY BRING AN ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF ANY
 PROVISION, STANDARD OR  REQUIREMENT  OF  THE  COMPACT  RELATING  TO  THE
 CONTENT OF AN ADVERTISEMENT NOT APPROVED OR CERTIFIED BY THE COMMISSION,
 THE  COMMISSION  OR  AN  AUTHORIZED COMMISSION OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE, MUST
 AUTHORIZE THE ACTION. HOWEVER, AUTHORIZATION PURSUANT TO THIS  PARAGRAPH
 DOES  NOT  REQUIRE  NOTICE  TO  THE  INSURER, OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING OR
 DISCLOSURE OF REQUESTS FOR AUTHORIZATION OR RECORDS OF THE  COMMISSION'S
 ACTION ON SUCH REQUESTS.
  §  8210.  DISPUTE  RESOLUTION.  THE COMMISSION SHALL ATTEMPT, UPON THE
 REQUEST OF A MEMBER, TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES OR OTHER  ISSUES  THAT  ARE
 SUBJECT TO THIS COMPACT AND WHICH MAY ARISE BETWEEN TWO OR MORE COMPACT-
 ING  STATES, OR BETWEEN COMPACTING STATES AND NON-COMPACTING STATES, AND
 THE COMMISSION SHALL PROMULGATE AN  OPERATING  PROCEDURE  PROVIDING  FOR
 RESOLUTION OF SUCH DISPUTES.
  §  8211.  PRODUCT  FILING  AND  APPROVAL. (A) INSURERS AND THIRD-PARTY
 FILERS SEEKING TO HAVE A PRODUCT APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION  SHALL  FILE
 SUCH  PRODUCT  WITH,  AND PAY APPLICABLE FILING FEES TO, THE COMMISSION.
 NOTHING IN THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE  CONSTRUED  TO  RESTRICT  OR  OTHERWISE
 PREVENT AN INSURER FROM FILING ITS PRODUCT WITH THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT
 IN ANY STATE WHEREIN SUCH INSURER IS LICENSED TO CONDUCT THE BUSINESS OF
 INSURANCE,  AND  SUCH  FILING SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE STATES
 WHERE FILED.
  (B) THE COMMISSION SHALL ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE FILING AND REVIEW PROC-
 ESSES AND PROCEDURES PURSUANT TO COMMISSION RULES AND  OPERATING  PROCE-
 DURES.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  PROVISION IN THIS SECTION TO THE CONTRARY,
 THE COMMISSION SHALL PROMULGATE RULES TO ESTABLISH CONDITIONS AND PROCE-
 DURES UNDER WHICH THE COMMISSION WILL PROVIDE PUBLIC ACCESS  TO  PRODUCT
 FILING  INFORMATION.  IN  ESTABLISHING  SUCH RULES, THE COMMISSION SHALL
 A. 6350  12

 CONSIDER THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC IN HAVING ACCESS TO  SUCH  INFORMA-
 TION,  AS  WELL AS PROTECTION OF PERSONAL MEDICAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMA-
 TION AND TRADE SECRETS, THAT MAY BE CONTAINED IN  A  PRODUCT  FILING  OR
 SUPPORTING INFORMATION.
  (C)  ANY  PRODUCT  APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION MAY BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE
 ISSUED IN THOSE COMPACTING  STATES  IN  WHICH  THE  INSURER  IS  LEGALLY
 AUTHORIZED TO DO BUSINESS.
  §  8212.  REVIEW  OF  COMMISSION  DECISIONS REGARDING FILINGS. (A) NOT
 LATER THAN THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE COMMISSION HAS GIVEN NOTICE OF A DISAP-
 PROVED PRODUCT OR ADVERTISEMENT FILED WITH THE COMMISSION,  THE  INSURER
 OR  THIRD PARTY FILER WHOSE FILING WAS DISAPPROVED MAY APPEAL THE DETER-
 MINATION TO A REVIEW PANEL APPOINTED BY THE COMMISSION.  THE  COMMISSION
 SHALL  PROMULGATE  RULES  TO  ESTABLISH  PROCEDURES  FOR APPOINTING SUCH
 REVIEW PANEL AND PROVIDE FOR NOTICE AND HEARING. AN ALLEGATION THAT  THE
 COMMISSION,  IN  DISAPPROVING  A PRODUCT OR ADVERTISEMENT FILED WITH THE
 COMMISSION, ACTED ARBITRARILY, CAPRICIOUSLY OR IN A MANNER  THAT  IS  AN
 ABUSE  OF DISCRETION OR OTHERWISE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW, IS SUBJECT
 TO JUDICIAL REVIEW IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSECTION (E)  OF  SECTION  EIGHT
 THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FOUR OF THIS ARTICLE.
  (B)  THE COMMISSION SHALL HAVE AUTHORITY TO MONITOR, REVIEW AND RECON-
 SIDER PRODUCTS AND ADVERTISEMENT SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR FILING OR  APPROVAL
 UPON A FINDING THAT THE PRODUCT DOES NOT MEET THE RELEVANT UNIFORM STAN-
 DARD.  WHERE  APPROPRIATE,  THE  COMMISSION  MAY  WITHDRAW OR MODIFY ITS
 APPROVAL AFTER PROPER NOTICE AND HEARING, SUBJECT TO THE APPEAL  PROCESS
 SET FORTH IN SUBSECTION (A) OF THIS SECTION.
  §  8213.  FINANCE.  (A)  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL PAY OR PROVIDE FOR THE
 PAYMENT OF THE REASONABLE EXPENSES OF ITS  ESTABLISHMENT  AND  ORGANIZA-
 TION.  TO  FUND  THE  COST OF ITS INITIAL OPERATIONS, THE COMMISSION MAY
 ACCEPT CONTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER FORMS OF FUNDING FROM THE NAIC,  COMPACT-
 ING  STATES  AND OTHER SOURCES. CONTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER FORMS OF FUNDING
 FROM OTHER SOURCES SHALL BE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT  THE  INDEPENDENCE  OF
 THE  COMMISSION  CONCERNING  THE  PERFORMANCE OF ITS DUTIES SHALL NOT BE
 COMPROMISED.
  (B) THE COMMISSION SHALL COLLECT A FILING FEE FROM  EACH  INSURER  AND
 THIRD PARTY FILER FILING A PRODUCT WITH THE COMMISSION TO COVER THE COST
 OF  THE  OPERATIONS  AND ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION AND ITS STAFF IN A
 TOTAL AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COMMISSION'S ANNUAL BUDGET.

 UNTIL  IT HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO NOTICE AND COMMENT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION
 EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHT OF THIS ARTICLE.
  (D) THE COMMISSION SHALL BE EXEMPT FROM ALL TAXATION  IN  AND  BY  THE
 COMPACTING STATES.

 STATE, EXCEPT BY AND  WITH  THE  APPROPRIATE  LEGAL  AUTHORITY  OF  THAT
 COMPACTING STATE.
  (F)  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL KEEP COMPLETE AND ACCURATE ACCOUNTS OF ALL
 ITS INTERNAL RECEIPTS, INCLUDING GRANTS AND DONATIONS AND  DISBURSEMENTS
 OF  ALL  FUNDS UNDER ITS CONTROL. THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS OF THE
 COMMISSION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO  THE  ACCOUNTING  PROCEDURES  ESTABLISHED
 UNDER  ITS  BY-LAWS.  THE  FINANCIAL  ACCOUNTS AND REPORTS INCLUDING THE
 SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OF THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  BE
 AUDITED ANNUALLY BY AN INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT. UPON THE
 DETERMINATION OF THE COMMISSION, BUT NO LESS FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY THREE
 YEARS, THE REVIEW OF SUCH INDEPENDENT AUDITOR SHALL INCLUDE A MANAGEMENT
 AND  PERFORMANCE  AUDIT  OF THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION SHALL MAKE AN
 ANNUAL REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE OF THE COMPACTING  STATES,
 A. 6350  13
 
 WHICH SHALL INCLUDE A REPORT OF SUCH INDEPENDENT AUDIT. THE COMMISSION'S
 INTERNAL  ACCOUNTS  SHALL  NOT BE CONFIDENTIAL AND SUCH MATERIALS MAY BE
 SHARED WITH THE COMMISSIONER  OF  ANY  COMPACTING  STATE  UPON  REQUEST,
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY WORK PAPERS RELATED TO ANY INTERNAL OR INDE-
 PENDENT  AUDIT  AND ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS
 AND INSURERS' PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING  TRADE  SECRETS,  SHALL
 REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL.
  (G)  NO  COMPACTING  STATE SHALL HAVE ANY CLAIM TO OR OWNERSHIP OF ANY
 PROPERTY HELD BY OR VESTED IN THE COMMISSION OR TO ANY COMMISSION  FUNDS
 HELD PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS COMPACT.
  § 8214. COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT. (A) ANY STATE
 IS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME A COMPACTING STATE.
  (B)  THE  COMPACT  SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE AND BINDING UPON LEGISLATIVE
 ENACTMENT OF THE COMPACT INTO LAW BY  TWO  COMPACTING  STATES;  PROVIDED
 HOWEVER,  THAT  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR PURPOSES OF
 ADOPTING UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR REVIEWING, AND GIVING APPROVAL OR  DISAP-
 PROVAL  OF,  PRODUCTS  FILED WITH THE COMMISSION THAT SATISFY APPLICABLE
 UNIFORM STANDARDS ONLY AFTER TWENTY-SIX STATES ARE COMPACTING STATES OR,
 ALTERNATIVELY, BY STATES REPRESENTING GREATER THAN FORTY PERCENT OF  THE
 PREMIUM  VOLUME FOR LIFE INSURANCE, ANNUITY, DISABILITY INCOME AND LONG-

 YEAR. THEREAFTER, IT SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE AND BINDING AS TO ANY  OTHER
 COMPACTING STATE UPON ENACTMENT OF THE COMPACT INTO LAW BY THAT STATE.
  (C)  AMENDMENTS  TO  THE COMPACT MAY BE PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION FOR
 ENACTMENT BY THE COMPACTING STATES. NO AMENDMENT SHALL BECOME  EFFECTIVE
 AND  BINDING  UPON  THE  COMMISSION AND THE COMPACTING STATES UNLESS AND
 UNTIL ALL COMPACTING STATES ENACT THE AMENDMENT INTO LAW.
  § 8215. WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT AND TERMINATION.  (A)(1)  ONCE  EFFECTIVE,
 THE  COMPACT  SHALL  CONTINUE  IN FORCE AND REMAIN BINDING UPON EACH AND
 EVERY COMPACTING STATE; PROVIDED THAT A COMPACTING  STATE  MAY  WITHDRAW
 FROM  THE  COMPACT  ("WITHDRAWING  STATE") BY ENACTING A STATUTE SPECIF-
 ICALLY REPEALING THE STATUTE WHICH ENACTED THE COMPACT INTO LAW.
  (2) THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF WITHDRAWAL IS  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THE
 REPEALING STATUTE.  HOWEVER, THE WITHDRAWAL SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY PROD-
 UCT  FILINGS  APPROVED  OR  SELF-CERTIFIED, OR ANY ADVERTISEMENT OF SUCH

 MUTUAL AGREEMENT OF THE COMMISSION AND THE WITHDRAWING STATE UNLESS  THE
 APPROVAL  IS RESCINDED BY THE WITHDRAWING STATE AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH
 FIVE OF THIS SUBSECTION.

 HAVE BEEN RELEASED OR RELINQUISHED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT OF THE COMMISSION
 AND  THE  WITHDRAWING  STATE.  THE COMMISSION'S APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS AND
 ADVERTISEMENT PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF WITHDRAWAL  SHALL  CONTINUE
 TO  BE  EFFECTIVE  AND BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT IN THE WITHDRAWING
 STATE, UNLESS FORMALLY RESCINDED BY THE WITHDRAWING STATE  IN  THE  SAME

  (6)  REINSTATEMENT  FOLLOWING WITHDRAWAL OF ANY COMPACTING STATE SHALL
 OCCUR UPON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THE  WITHDRAWING  STATE'S  LEGISLATION
 REENACTING THE COMPACT.
  (B)  (1) IF THE COMMISSION DETERMINES THAT ANY COMPACTING STATE HAS AT
 ANY TIME DEFAULTED ("DEFAULTING STATE") IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF ITS
 OBLIGATIONS OR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THIS COMPACT, THE BY-LAWS OR  DULY
 PROMULGATED  RULES OR OPERATING PROCEDURES, THEN, AFTER NOTICE AND HEAR-
 ING AS SET FORTH IN THE BY-LAWS, ALL  RIGHTS,  PRIVILEGES  AND  BENEFITS
 CONFERRED BY THE COMPACT ON THE DEFAULTING STATE SHALL BE SUSPENDED FROM
 THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF DEFAULT AS FIXED BY THE COMMISSION. THE GROUNDS
 FOR DEFAULT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,  FAILURE  OF  A  COMPACTING
 STATE  TO  PERFORM  ITS  OBLIGATIONS  OR RESPONSIBILITIES, AND ANY OTHER
 GROUNDS DESIGNATED IN COMMISSION RULES. THE COMMISSION SHALL IMMEDIATELY
 NOTIFY THE DEFAULTING STATE IN WRITING OF THE DEFAULTING STATE'S SUSPEN-
 SION PENDING A CURE OF THE DEFAULT. THE COMMISSION SHALL  STIPULATE  THE
 CONDITIONS  AND  THE  TIME PERIOD WITHIN WHICH THE DEFAULTING STATE MUST
 CURE ITS DEFAULT. IF THE DEFAULTING STATE  FAILS  TO  CURE  THE  DEFAULT
 WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED BY THE COMMISSION, THE DEFAULTING STATE

 BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THE COMPACT SHALL BE TERMINATED FROM THE EFFECTIVE
 DATE OF TERMINATION.

 TIONS, OR ANY ADVERTISEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH PRODUCT, THAT ARE IN

 DEFAULTING STATE IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF THE DEFAULTING STATE HAD WITH-
 DRAWN VOLUNTARILY UNDER THIS SECTION.

 EFFECTUATE ITS PURPOSES.
  §  8217. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS. (A) NOTHING IN THIS
 SECTION PREVENTS THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OTHER LAW OF A COMPACTING STATE,
 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (B) OF THIS SECTION.
  (B) FOR ANY PRODUCT APPROVED  OR  CERTIFIED  TO  THE  COMMISSION,  THE
 RULES,  UNIFORM  STANDARDS  AND ANY OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMISSION
 SHALL CONSTITUTE THE EXCLUSIVE PROVISIONS  APPLICABLE  TO  THE  CONTENT,
 APPROVAL  AND  CERTIFICATION OF SUCH PRODUCTS. FOR ADVERTISEMENT THAT IS
 SUBJECT TO THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY, ANY  RULE,  UNIFORM  STANDARD  OR
 OTHER  REQUIREMENT  OF  THE  COMMISSION WHICH GOVERNS THE CONTENT OF THE
 ADVERTISEMENT SHALL CONSTITUTE THE EXCLUSIVE PROVISION  THAT  A  COMMIS-
 SIONER  MAY  APPLY  TO THE CONTENT OF THE ADVERTISEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING

 COMPACTING  STATES, THE COMMISSION MAY ISSUE ADVISORY OPINIONS REGARDING
 THE DISPUTED MEANING OR INTERPRETATION.
  (G) IN THE EVENT ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE EXCEEDS  THE  CONSTITU-
 TIONAL  LIMITS  IMPOSED  ON THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY COMPACTING STATE, THE
 OBLIGATIONS, DUTIES, POWERS OR JURISDICTION SOUGHT TO  BE  CONFERRED  BY
 THAT  PROVISION  UPON  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  BE INEFFECTIVE AS TO SUCH
 COMPACTING STATE, AND SUCH OBLIGATIONS, DUTIES, POWERS  OR  JURISDICTION
 SHALL REMAIN IN THE COMPACTING STATE AND SHALL BE EXERCISED BY THE AGEN-
 CY THEREOF TO WHICH SUCH OBLIGATIONS, DUTIES, POWERS OR JURISDICTION ARE
 DELEGATED BY LAW IN EFFECT AT THE TIME THE COMPACT BECOMES EFFECTIVE.
