  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 5-11, 2024, as Tardive Dyskinesia Awareness Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help  increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 5-11, 2024, as Tardive
Dyskinesia Awareness Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many people with serious mental health conditions, such as
bipolar  disorder,  major  depressive  disorders,  schizophrenia,  and
schizoaffective  disorder,  or  gastrointestinal  disorders,  including
gastroparesis, nausea, and vomiting, may  be  treated  with  medications
that  work  as  dopamine  receptor  blocking  agents  (DRBAs), including
antipsychotics and antiemetics; and
 
  WHEREAS, While ongoing  treatment  with  these  medications  can  be
necessary,  prolonged  use of the medications is associated with tardive
dyskinesia (TD), an involuntary movement disorder that is  characterized
by uncontrollable, abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso,
and/or other body parts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Even  mild  symptoms  of  TD can impact people physically,
socially and emotionally; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  estimated  that  TD  affects  approximately  600,000
people  in  the  U.S.,  and approximately 65% of people with TD have not
been diagnosed,  making  it  important  to  raise  awareness  about  the
symptoms  and  impact  of  TD  because even mild symptoms of TD can have
physical, social and emotional consequences; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is important that people  taking  these  medications  be
monitored  for  TD;  regular  screening  for  TD  in  these  patients is
recommended by the American Psychiatric Association (APA); and
 
  WHEREAS, Recognition and treatment of TD can make a positive  impact
in  the  lives of many people experiencing psychotic and mood disorders;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Clinical research  has  led  to  the  availability  of  two
treatments  for  adults  with  TD  by  the  United  States Food and Drug
Administration; and
 
  WHEREAS, Anyone experiencing symptoms of  TD  should  consult  their
physician for support; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to  increase  and  raise
 
awareness  of  TD  among  the  public  and  the  medical community; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 5-11, 2024, as Tardive
Dyskinesia Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
