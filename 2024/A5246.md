 amended to read as follows:
  1. (A) When an application for assistance or care is  received,  or  a
 social  services official is informed that a person is in need of public
 assistance and care, an investigation and record shall be  made  of  the
 circumstances of such person. The object of such investigations shall be
 to  secure  the  facts  necessary to determine whether such person is in
 need of public assistance or care and what form thereof and  service  he
 or  she  should receive AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH PERSON IS A WANTED
 FELON  AS  DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  SECTION  EIGHT  HUNDRED
 FORTY-FIVE-E  OF  THE EXECUTIVE LAW OR A PROBATION OR PAROLE VIOLATOR AS
 DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE-E OF  THE

 PERSON WAS AWARE OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF SUCH WARRANT OR VIOLATION.
 Information shall be sought as to the  residence  of  such  person,  the
 name,  age,  religious  faith,  physical  condition,  earnings  or other
 income, and ability to work of all members of the family, the  cause  of
 the person's condition, the ability and willingness of the family, rela-
 tives,  friends  and  church  to  assist, and such other facts as may be
 useful in determining the  treatment  which  will  be  helpful  to  such
 person.  However, nothing in this subdivision or elsewhere in this chap-
 ter contained shall be construed to require a social  services  official
 to  communicate  with  or  require assistance from any person or persons
 liable by law to contribute to the support of a woman pregnant with,  or
 the  mother  of, an out of wedlock child, in need of care away from home
 during pregnancy and during and after delivery, in the  case  where  the
 surrender  of the child to the social services official is under consid-
 eration, for such period as may be necessary for such mother  and  offi-

 cial  to  decide  whether  the child will be surrendered for adoption to
 such official, which period shall not extend beyond  ninety  days  after
 birth  of  the child. Except where the welfare official is in possession
 of  positive  proof  that  the  applicant is receiving or is eligible to
 receive unemployment insurance benefits  and  the  amount  thereof  such
 investigations  shall  include  written  request  to the commissioner of
 labor or his or her duly authorized officer charged with  administration
 of  the  unemployment  insurance law for information as to the status of
 such person in respect to unemployment insurance benefits.
  (B) THE COMMISSIONER OF A SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT OR  ANY  AUTHORIZED
 PERSON,  AS  DEFINED IN SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE-E OF THE EXECU-

 EXECUTIVE LAW, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL INVESTIGATE TO  DETERMINE  WHETHER
 THE  APPLICANT  IS  AWARE OF HIS OR HER STATUS AND TO DETERMINE WHEN THE
 APPLICANT BECAME, OR SHOULD HAVE BECOME AWARE OF HIS OR HER STATUS.
  (D) WHERE AN APPLICANT HAS NOT INITIALLY BEEN DETERMINED TO BE  INELI-
 GIBLE  FOR  PUBLIC  ASSISTANCE BENEFITS BECAUSE OF A RELIANCE ON A FALSE
 STATEMENT PROVIDED IN THE APPLICATION, HOWEVER  IS  SUBSEQUENTLY  DETER-
 MINED  TO BE INELIGIBLE FOR SUCH ASSISTANCE, THE COMMISSIONER, ON BEHALF
 OF THE STATE AND THE LOCAL  SOCIAL  SERVICES  DISTRICT  SHALL  HAVE  THE
 AUTHORITY  TO  RECOUP  FROM  THE  INDIVIDUAL  THE SUMS EXPENDED FOR SUCH
 ASSISTANCE DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT SUCH PERSON RECEIVED  BENEFITS
 AND  KNEW  OR  SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THEIR STATEMENT CLAIMING THAT THEY
 ARE NEITHER A WANTED FELON OR PROBATION OR PAROLE  VIOLATOR  STATUS  WAS
 FALSE.
  (E) AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IDENTIFIED, AND KNOWS SO OR IS NOTIFIED THER-
 EOF,  AS BEING A PROBATION OR PAROLE VIOLATOR, AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION
 ONE OF SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE-E OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW,  IS  NOT
