 such facility is entirely located within  the  geographic  area  in  the
 borough  of  Staten  Island[,  or in an area not defined as an exclusion

 80  percent  of  the  total  square footage of the building to which the
 lease applies. Such agreements do not include  agreements  between  not-
 for-profit organizations and a contracting agency.
  § 7. Subdivision 1 of section 11-239 of the administrative code of the
 city  of  New York, as amended by local law number 40 of the city of New
 York for the year 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  1. For fiscal years beginning the first of July,  two  thousand  three
 and  ending  the  thirtieth  of June, two thousand nine, a rebate in the
 amount of the lesser of four hundred dollars or the annual tax liability
 imposed on the property shall be paid to an owner or  tenant-stockholder
 who,  as of the date the application provided for in subdivision four of
 this section is due, owns a one, two or  three  family  residence  or  a
 dwelling unit in residential property held in the condominium or cooper-
 ative form of ownership that is the owner or tenant-stockholder's prima-
 ry  residence  and  meets  all  other  eligibility  requirements of this
 section. If, with respect to the fiscal year beginning on the  first  of
 July,  two thousand eight and ending on the thirtieth of June, two thou-
 sand nine, an increase in average real property tax rates  would  other-
 wise  be  necessary  in  the  resolution of the city council fixing real
 property tax rates for such fiscal year pursuant to  the  charter,  then
 the  rebate  to  be paid for such fiscal year shall be reduced or elimi-
 nated as follows: where the sum to be raised by such  increase  is  less
 than  seven  hundred  fifty  million  dollars, then such rebate shall be
 reduced by fifty cents for each dollar of increase, and where the sum to
 be raised by such increase is seven hundred  fifty  million  dollars  or
 more,  then such rebate shall be eliminated. Notwithstanding anything to
 the contrary in sections [four hundred twenty-one-a,] four hundred twen-
 ty-one-b or four hundred twenty-one-g of the real property tax  law,  an
 owner  or tenant-stockholder whose property is receiving benefits pursu-
 ant to such sections shall not be prohibited  from  receiving  a  rebate
 pursuant  to  this section if such owner or tenant-stockholder is other-
 wise eligible to receive such rebate.  Tenant-stockholders  of  dwelling
 units  in  a  cooperative apartment corporation incorporated as a mutual
 company pursuant to article two, four, five or  eleven  of  the  private
 housing  finance  law  shall not be entitled to the rebate authorized by
 this section. Such rebate shall be paid by the commissioner  of  finance
 to  eligible  owners  or  tenant-stockholders  in  accordance with rules
 promulgated by the commissioner of finance.
  § 8. Subdivision h of section 26-901 of the administrative code of the
 city of New York, as added by local law number 44 of  the  city  of  New

 alteration of any residential building, residential facility or residen-
 tial  structure  by  a developer (1) which creates or preserves at least

 financial  assistance  other  than  non-discretionary  tax abatements or
 benefits approved or administered in accordance with [sections 421-a  or
 489] SECTION FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE of the [New York state] real prop-
 erty  tax  law  or other similar programs and (3) where the developer of
 such project was not selected more than five years prior to  the  effec-
 tive  date of this chapter. The term "housing development project" shall
 not include emergency repairs performed by or on behalf of  the  depart-

 actions and proceedings law.
  §  9.  Subdivision  18 of section 654-d of the private housing finance
 law, as amended by chapter 703 of the laws of 1992, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  18.  Rentals.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of, or any regulation
 promulgated pursuant to, the emergency housing  rent  control  law,  the
 local  emergency  housing rent control act or local law enacted pursuant
 thereto, all dwelling units in a multiple dwelling the rehabilitation of
 which commenced after July first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-seven  and
 which  is  financed  by a mortgage loan insured by the subsidiary corpo-
 ration (including, but not limited to, mortgage loans  insured  pursuant
 to mortgage insurance contracts and housing insurance contracts), except
 for dwelling units occupied by reason of ownership of stock in a cooper-
 ative  and except for dwelling units that constitute condominiums, shall
 be subject to the rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine,
 beginning immediately after initial rents, as established under applica-
 ble provisions of this chapter, [section four  hundred  twenty-one-a  of
 the real property tax law,] section four hundred eighty-nine of the real
 property tax law and/or subparagraph (m) of paragraph one of subdivision
 g  of  section 26-405 of the administrative code of the city of New York
 for such dwelling units to become effective on the basis of  such  reha-
 bilitation,  provided that any occupant in possession of a dwelling unit
 that first becomes subject to the rent  stabilization  law  of  nineteen
 hundred  sixty-nine pursuant to this section shall be offered a two-year
 lease notwithstanding any contrary provisions of, or regulations adopted
 pursuant to, such rent stabilization law, at  the  initial  rent  estab-
 lished  for  such  dwelling unit and provided further that such dwelling
 units, other than those dwelling units, the initial rents of  which  are
 established  under subparagraph (m) of paragraph one of subdivision g of
 section 26-405 of the administrative code of the city of New York, shall
 remain subject to the rent stabilization  law  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions  of  this  chapter[, section four hundred twenty-one-a of the
 real property tax law] and/or section four hundred  eighty-nine  of  the
 real  property tax law as the case may be. Except to the extent to which
 dwelling units, which are controlled  under  other  provisions  of  law,
 become  subject to the rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-
 nine pursuant to the preceding sentence, no dwelling unit  shall  become
 subject to the rent stabilization law solely by reason of insurance of a
 mortgage loan by the subsidiary corporation.
  §  10. Subdivision 6 of section 421-m of the real property tax law, as
 added by section 43 of part B of chapter 97 of  the  laws  of  2011,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  6.  The exemption authorized by this section shall not be available in
 a jurisdiction to which the provisions of section [four hundred  twenty-
 one-a or] four hundred twenty-one-c of this article are applicable.
  §  11. Subdivision 1 of section 467-e of the real property tax law, as
 amended by chapter 483 of the laws  of  2007,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1. Generally. Notwithstanding any provision of any general, special or
 local  law  to the contrary, any city having a population of one million
 S. 216  4
 
 or more is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and amend local laws
 in accordance with this section to grant a rebate of real property taxes
 for fiscal years beginning on the first of July, two thousand three  and
 ending  on the thirtieth of June, two thousand nine in the amount of the
 lesser of four hundred dollars or the annual tax  liability  imposed  on
 the  property.  No  such  local law may be adopted unless, as originally
 adopted, it authorizes such rebate to be granted in accordance with this
 section for three consecutive fiscal years  beginning  with  the  fiscal
 year  beginning on the first of July, two thousand three. No such rebate
 shall be granted by local law for any fiscal year beginning on or  after
 the  first  of July, two thousand nine, unless the council of such city,
 in fixing the annual tax rates for any  such  fiscal  year,  shall  have
 uniformly  reduced  such  rates  for all classes of property in order to
 produce real property tax relief among such classes of  property  in  an
 amount  not  less than, in the aggregate, the aggregate amount of rebate
 paid in such fiscal year. No such local law implementing the  provisions
 of  this  section, as amended by [the] chapter FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY-THREE
 of the laws of two thousand seven [which added this  sentence],  may  be
 adopted  unless,  as  originally adopted, such local law authorizes such
 rebate to be granted in accordance with this section for  three  consec-
 utive fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year beginning on the first
 of July, two thousand six. Any rebate authorized by local law in accord-
 ance  with  this  section shall be paid in the fiscal year following the
 fiscal year for which the rebate is granted. If,  with  respect  to  the
 fiscal  year  of  such city beginning on the first of July, two thousand
 eight and ending on  the  thirtieth  of  June,  two  thousand  nine,  an
 increase in average real property tax rates would otherwise be necessary
 in  the  resolution  of such city council fixing real property tax rates
 for such fiscal year pursuant to the charter  of  such  city,  then  the
 rebate to be paid for such fiscal year shall be reduced or eliminated as
 follows:  where the sum to be raised by such increase is less than seven
 hundred fifty million dollars, then such  rebate  shall  be  reduced  by
 fifty  cents for each dollar of increase, and where the sum to be raised
 by such increase is seven hundred fifty million dollars  or  more,  then
 such  rebate  shall be eliminated. The determination of the reduction or
 elimination of such rebate shall be set forth in such  resolution  after
 consultation  with the department of finance of such city and shall take
 effect upon the final adoption of such resolution. Such rebate shall  be
 paid  to an owner or tenant-stockholder who, as of the date the applica-
 tion provided for in subdivision four of this section  is  due,  owns  a
 one,  two  or  three  family residence or a dwelling unit in residential
 property held in the condominium or cooperative form of  ownership  that
 is  the  owner  or  tenant-stockholder's primary residence and meets all
 other  eligibility  requirements  of  this  section.  Notwithstanding
 anything  to  the contrary in sections [four hundred twenty-one-a,] four
 hundred twenty-one-b or four hundred  twenty-one-g  of  this  title,  an
 owner  or tenant-stockholder whose property is receiving benefits pursu-
 ant to such sections shall not be prohibited  from  receiving  a  rebate
 pursuant  to  this section if such owner or tenant-stockholder is other-
 wise eligible to receive such rebate.  Tenant-stockholders of  dwelling
 units  in  a  cooperative apartment corporation incorporated as a mutual
 company pursuant to article two, four, five or  eleven  of  the  private
 housing  finance  law  shall not be entitled to the rebate authorized by
 this section. Such rebate shall be paid by the commissioner  of  finance
 to  eligible  owners  or  tenant-stockholders  in  accordance with rules
 promulgated by the commissioner of finance.
