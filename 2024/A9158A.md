 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 MOBILE  OR  MANUFACTURED  HOME  UNITS  WITH RUSTED, LEAKING METAL ROOFS,

 THE  LEGISLATURE  THEREFORE  FINDS  THAT  THE  STATE  SHOULD ESTABLISH A
 PROGRAM TO FUND THE REPLACEMENT OF MOBILE OR MANUFACTURED HOMES WITH NEW
 AFFORDABLE AND ENERGY  EFFICIENT  MANUFACTURED,  MODULAR  OR  SITE-BUILT
 HOMES.

 TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:

 LISHED IN SECTION FORTY-FIVE-A OF THIS CHAPTER.
  2.  "DILAPIDATED" SHALL MEAN A HOUSING UNIT THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE SAFE
