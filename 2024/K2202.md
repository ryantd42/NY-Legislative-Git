  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body that the children
of today are the citizens and leaders of tomorrow; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the further sense of this Legislative Body  that  the
children  of  the  State  of New York are our most precious resource and

foster parents, family members, volunteers, mentors, policymakers, child
welfare professionals, and other  members  of  the  community  who  help
children  and youth in foster care find permanent homes and connections;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The proclamation of May as Foster Care  Month  also  renews
the  commitment  to  ensuring  a bright future for the more than 400,000

contribute to lifting the quality of life of the  youth  of  this  noble
Empire  State,  while advancing that spirit of united purpose and shared
concern  which  is  the  unalterable  manifestation  of  our  American
experience; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as  Foster  Care
Month in the State of New York, recognizing the significance of the role
the  children  of  New York State will play in shaping the future of our
State, our society, and our government; and be it further
