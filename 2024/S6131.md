  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section 259-r of the executive law, as amended by section
 38-l of subpart A of part C of chapter 62  of  the  laws  of  2011,  the
 section  heading  and subdivisions 1, 2, paragraph (b) of subdivision 4,

 the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  § 259-r.  Release  on  medical  parole for terminally ill incarcerated
 individuals. 1. (a) The [board] COMMISSIONER shall  have  the  power  to
 release  on  medical parole any incarcerated individual serving an inde-
 terminate or determinate  sentence  of  imprisonment  who,  pursuant  to
 subdivision two of this section, has been certified to be suffering from
 a  terminal  condition,  disease or syndrome and to be so debilitated or
 incapacitated as to create a reasonable probability that he  or  she  is
 physically or cognitively incapable of presenting any danger to society,
 provided,  however,  that  no incarcerated individual serving a sentence
 imposed upon a conviction for [murder in the first degree or an  attempt
 or conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree shall be eligible for
 such release, and provided further that no incarcerated individual serv-
 ing  a  sentence  imposed  upon  a  conviction  for any of the following
 offenses shall be eligible for such release unless in  the  case  of  an
 indeterminate  sentence  he  or  she has served at least one-half of the
 minimum period of the sentence and in the case of a determinate sentence
 he or she has served at least one-half of the term of his or her  deter-
 minate sentence:  murder in the second degree, manslaughter in the first
 degree,  any  offense defined in article one hundred thirty of the penal

 law or an attempt to commit  any  of  these  offenses.  Solely  for  the
 purpose  of  determining  medical  parole  eligibility  pursuant to this
 section, such one-half  of  the  minimum  period  of  the  indeterminate
 sentence  and one-half of the term of the determinate sentence shall not
 be credited with any time served under the jurisdiction of  the  depart-
 ment  prior to the commencement of such sentence pursuant to the opening
 paragraph of subdivision one of section 70.30 of the penal law or subdi-
 vision two-a of section 70.30 of the penal law,  except  to  the  extent
 authorized  by  subdivision  three of section 70.30 of the penal law] AN
 ACT OF TERRORISM AS DEFINED IN SECTION 490.05 OF THE PENAL LAW, SHALL BE
 ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE.
  (b) Such release shall be granted only after the [board]  COMMISSIONER
 considers  whether,  in  light  of the incarcerated individual's medical
 condition, there is a reasonable probability that the incarcerated indi-
 vidual, if released, will live and remain at liberty  without  violating
 the  law,  and that such release is not incompatible with the welfare of
 society and will not so deprecate the seriousness of  the  crime  as  to
 undermine  respect  for  the law, and shall be subject to the limits and
 conditions specified in subdivision four of this section. Except as  set
 forth  in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, such release may be granted
 at any time during the term of an  incarcerated  individual's  sentence,
 notwithstanding any other provision of law.
  [(c)  The  board  shall  afford  notice  to  the sentencing court, the
 district attorney and the attorney for the incarcerated individual  that
 the  incarcerated individual is being considered for release pursuant to
 this section and the parties receiving notice shall have fifteen days to
 comment on the  release  of  the  incarcerated  individual.  Release  on
 medical  parole shall not be granted until the expiration of the comment
 period provided for in this paragraph.]
  2. (a) The commissioner, on the commissioner's own  initiative  or  at
 the  request  of an incarcerated individual, or an incarcerated individ-
 ual's spouse, relative or attorney, may, in the exercise of the  commis-
 sioner's  discretion,  direct  that  an  investigation  be undertaken to
 determine whether a diagnosis should be made of an incarcerated individ-
 ual who appears to be suffering from a terminal  condition,  disease  or
 syndrome.  Any  such  medical  diagnosis  shall be made by a physician
 licensed to practice medicine in this state pursuant to  section  sixty-
 five  hundred  twenty-four  of  the  education law. Such physician shall
 either be employed by the department, shall render professional services
 at the request of the department, or shall be employed by a hospital  or
 medical  facility  used  by  the department for the medical treatment of
 incarcerated individuals. The diagnosis shall be reported to the commis-
 sioner and shall include but shall not be limited to  a  description  of
 the terminal condition, disease or syndrome suffered by the incarcerated
 individual,  a prognosis concerning the likelihood that the incarcerated
 individual will not recover from such  terminal  condition,  disease  or
 syndrome,  a  description  of  the incarcerated individual's physical or
 cognitive incapacity which shall include  a  prediction  respecting  the
 likely  duration  of the incapacity, and a statement by the physician of
 whether the incarcerated individual is so debilitated  or  incapacitated
 as  to  be severely restricted in his or her ability to self-ambulate or
 to perform significant normal activities of daily  living.  This  report
 also  shall  include  a recommendation of the type and level of services
 and treatment the  incarcerated  individual  would  require  if  granted
 medical  parole  and a recommendation for the types of settings in which
 the services and treatment should be given.
 S. 6131  3
 
  (b) The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall review the
 diagnosis and may certify that the incarcerated individual is  suffering
 from such terminal condition, disease or syndrome and that the incarcer-
 ated  individual  is  so  debilitated  or  incapacitated  as to create a
 reasonable probability that he or she is physically or cognitively inca-
 pable of presenting [any] A danger to society. [If the commissioner does
 not so certify then the incarcerated individual shall not be referred to
 the  board  for  consideration  for  release  on medical parole.] If the
 commissioner does so certify, then the commissioner shall, within  seven
 working  days of receipt of such diagnosis, refer the incarcerated indi-
 vidual [to the board for consideration] for release on  medical  parole.
 However,  no  such [referral of an incarcerated individual to the board]
 RELEASE shall be made unless the incarcerated individual has been  exam-
 ined  by  a  physician  and  diagnosed  as  having a terminal condition,
 disease or syndrome as previously described herein at some  time  subse-
 quent to such incarcerated individual's admission to a facility operated
 by the department of correctional services.
  (c)  [When  the  commissioner refers an incarcerated individual to the
 board, the]  THE  commissioner  shall  provide  an  appropriate  medical
 discharge  plan established by the department. The department is author-
 ized to request assistance from the department of health  and  from  the
 county in which the incarcerated individual resided and committed his or
 her  crime,  which shall provide assistance with respect to the develop-
 ment and implementation of a discharge plan, including potential  place-
 ments  of  a releasee. The department and the department of health shall
 jointly develop standards for the medical discharge plan that are appro-
 priately adapted to the criminal justice  setting,  based  on  standards
 established  by  the department of health for hospital medical discharge
 planning. The [board] COMMISSIONER may  postpone  its  decision  pending
 completion  of  an adequate discharge plan, or may deny release based on
 inadequacy of the discharge plan.
  3. Any certification by the commissioner or the commissioner's  desig-
 nee  pursuant  to  this  section shall be deemed a judicial function and
 shall not be reviewable if done in accordance with law.
  4. (a) Medical parole granted pursuant to this section shall be for  a
 period of six months.
  (b)  The  [board] COMMISSIONER shall require as a condition of release
 on medical parole that the releasee agree to remain under the care of  a
 physician while on medical parole and in a hospital established pursuant
 to  article twenty-eight of the public health law, a hospice established
 pursuant to article forty of the public health law or any  other  place-
 ment  that  can  provide  appropriate  medical  care as specified in the
 medical discharge plan required by subdivision two of this section.  The
 medical  discharge  plan shall state that the availability of the place-
 ment  has  been  confirmed,  and  by  whom.  Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision  of  law,  when  an  incarcerated individual who qualifies for
 release under this section  is  cognitively  incapable  of  signing  the
 requisite  documentation  to  effectuate the medical discharge plan and,
 after a diligent search no person has been identified who  could  other-
 wise  be  appointed as the incarcerated individual's guardian by a court
 of competent jurisdiction, then, solely for the purpose of  implementing
 the medical discharge plan, the facility health services director at the
 facility  where  the  incarcerated  individual is currently incarcerated
 shall be lawfully empowered to  act  as  the  incarcerated  individual's
 guardian for the purpose of effectuating the medical discharge.
 S. 6131  4
 
  (c)  Where  appropriate,  the  [board] COMMISSIONER shall require as a
 condition of release that medical parolees be  supervised  on  intensive
 caseloads at reduced supervision ratios.
  (d)  The  [board] COMMISSIONER shall require as a condition of release
 on medical parole that the releasee undergo  periodic  medical  examina-
 tions  and a medical examination at least one month prior to the expira-
 tion of the period of medical parole and, for the purposes of  making  a
 decision pursuant to paragraph (e) of this subdivision, that the releas-
 ee  provide the board with a report, prepared by the treating physician,
 of the results of such examination. Such report shall specifically state
 whether or not the parolee continues to suffer from  a  terminal  condi-
 tion, disease, or syndrome, and to be so debilitated or incapacitated as
 to  be  severely restricted in his or her ability to self-ambulate or to
 perform significant normal activities of daily living.
  (e) Prior to the expiration  of  the  period  of  medical  parole  the
 [board]  COMMISSIONER  shall  review  the  medical  examination  report
 required by paragraph (d)  of  this  subdivision  and  may  again  grant
 medical  parole  pursuant  to  this section; provided, however, that the
 provisions of [paragraph (c) of subdivision one and] subdivision two  of
 this section shall not apply.
  (f) If the updated medical report presented to the [board] COMMISSION-
 ER  states that a parolee released pursuant to this section is no longer
 so debilitated or incapacitated as to create  a  reasonable  probability
 that  he or she is physically or cognitively incapable of presenting any
 danger to society or if the releasee fails to submit the updated medical
 report then the board may not make a new grant of medical parole  pursu-
 ant to paragraph (e) of this subdivision. Where the [board] COMMISSIONER
 has  not  granted  medical  parole  pursuant  to  such paragraph (e) the
 [board]  COMMISSIONER  shall  promptly  conduct  [through  one  of  its
 members,]  or  cause to be conducted by a hearing officer [designated by
 the board,] a hearing to determine whether  the  releasee  is  suffering
 from  a terminal condition, disease or syndrome and is so debilitated or
 incapacitated as to create a reasonable probability that he  or  she  is
 physically  or cognitively incapable of presenting any danger to society
 and does not present a danger to society. If  the  [board]  COMMISSIONER
 makes  such  a  determination  then  it  may make a new grant of medical
 parole pursuant to the standards of paragraph (b) of subdivision one  of
 this  section.  At  the  hearing,  the  releasee shall have the right to
 representation by counsel, including  the  right,  if  the  releasee  is
 financially  unable  to  retain  counsel,  to have the appropriate court
 assign counsel in accordance with the county or city plan for  represen-
 tation  placed in operation pursuant to article eighteen-B of the county
 law.
  (g) The hearing and determination provided for  by  paragraph  (f)  of
 this  subdivision  shall  be  concluded  within  the six month period of
 medical parole. If the [board] COMMISSIONER does not renew the grant  of
 medical parole, it shall order that the releasee be returned immediately
 to the custody of the department.
  (h)  In  addition to the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this
 subdivision, medical parole may be revoked at any time upon any  of  the
 grounds  specified  in paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section two
 hundred fifty-nine-i of this article, and in accordance with the  proce-
 dures specified in subdivision three of section two hundred fifty-nine-i
 of this article.
  (i)  A  releasee who is on medical parole and who becomes eligible for
 parole pursuant to the provisions of  subdivision  two  of  section  two
 S. 6131  5
 
 hundred  fifty-nine-i  of  this  article  shall  be  eligible for parole
 consideration pursuant to such subdivision.
  5.  A  denial  of  release  on medical parole or expiration of medical
 parole in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of subdivision
 four of this section shall not preclude the incarcerated individual from
 reapplying for medical parole or otherwise affect an incarcerated  indi-
 vidual's eligibility for any other form of release provided for by law.
  6.  To  the extent that any provision of this section requires disclo-
 sure of medical information for the purpose of processing an application
 or making a decision, regarding release on medical parole or renewal  of
 medical parole, or for the purpose of appropriately supervising a person
 released  on medical parole, and that such disclosure would otherwise be
 prohibited by article twenty-seven-F  of  the  public  health  law,  the
 provisions of this section shall be controlling.
  7.  The  commissioner [and the chairman of the board] shall be author-
 ized to promulgate rules and regulations for their  respective  agencies
 to implement the provisions of this section.
  8.  Any  decision  made  by  the [board] COMMISSIONER pursuant to this
 section may be appealed pursuant to  subdivision  four  of  section  two
 hundred fifty-nine-i of this article.
  9.  The [chairman] COMMISSIONER shall report annually to the governor,
 the temporary president of the senate and the speaker of  the  assembly,
 the chairpersons of the assembly and senate codes committees, the chair-
 person  of  the  senate  crime and corrections committee, and the chair-
 person of the assembly corrections committee the number of  incarcerated
 individuals  who  have  applied  for medical parole; the number who have
 been granted medical parole; the nature of the  illness  of  the  appli-
 cants,  the  counties to which they have been released and the nature of
 the placement pursuant to the medical discharge plan; the categories  of
 reasons  for  denial  for  those  who  have  been  denied; the number of
 releases who have been  granted  an  additional  period  or  periods  of
 medical  parole and the number of such grants; the number of releases on
 medical parole who have been returned to imprisonment in the custody  of
 the department and the reasons for return.
  [10.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law, in the case of an
 incarcerated individual whose terminal condition,  disease  or  syndrome
 meets  the  criteria for medical parole as set forth in paragraph (a) of
 subdivision one of this section, and who is not serving a  sentence  for
 one  or  more  offenses set forth in paragraph (i) of subdivision one of
 section eight hundred six of the correction law which would render  such
 incarcerated individual ineligible for presumptive release, the granting
 of  medical parole shall be determined by the commissioner provided that
 a release of such incarcerated individual shall be  in  accordance  with
 subdivision  eleven  of  this section. In such case, the provisions that
 would have applied to and the procedures that would have  been  followed
 by  the  board  of parole pursuant to this section shall apply to and be
 followed by the commissioner.
  11. (a) After the commissioner  has  made  a  determination  to  grant
 medical  parole pursuant to subdivision ten of this section, the commis-
 sioner shall notify the chairperson of the board  of  parole,  or  their
 designee  who  shall be a member of the board of parole, and provide him
 or her with all relevant records, files, information and  documentation,
 which includes but is not limited to the criminal history, medical diag-
 nosis  and treatment pertaining to the terminally ill incarcerated indi-
 vidual no more than five days from the date of  the  determination.  (b)
 The  chairperson  or his or her designee shall either accept the commis-
 S. 6131  6

 sioner's grant of medical parole, in which case the  incarcerated  indi-
 vidual  may  be released by the commissioner, or conduct further review.
 This decision or review shall be made within five days of the receipt of
 the  relevant  records,  files,  information  and documentation from the
 commissioner. The chairperson's further review may include, but  not  be
 limited  to, an appearance by the terminally ill incarcerated individual
 before the chairperson or his or her designee. (c)  After  this  further
 review,  the chairperson shall either accept the commissioner's grant of
 medical parole,  in  which  case  the  incarcerated  individual  may  be
 released  by  the  commissioner,  or  the  chairperson shall schedule an
 appearance for the terminally ill  incarcerated  individual  before  the
 board of parole.
  In  the  event the terminally ill incarcerated individual is scheduled
 to make an appearance before the board of parole pursuant to this subdi-
 vision, the matter shall be heard by a panel that does not  include  the
 chairperson or any member of the board of parole who was involved in the
 review of the commissioner's determination.]
  §  2. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 259-r of the executive
 law, as amended by section 14-a of the chapter 322 of the laws of  2021,
 is amended to read as follows,
  (a)  The  [board]  COMMISSIONER  shall  have  the  power to release on
 medical parole any incarcerated individual serving an  indeterminate  or
 determinate sentence of imprisonment who, pursuant to subdivision two of
 this  section, has been certified to be suffering from a terminal condi-
 tion, disease or syndrome and to be so debilitated or  incapacitated  as
 to  create  a  reasonable  probability  that  he or she is physically or
 cognitively incapable of presenting any  danger  to  society,  provided,
 however, that no incarcerated individual serving a sentence imposed upon
 a conviction for [murder in the first degree or an attempt or conspiracy
 to commit murder in the first degree shall be eligible for such release,
 and  provided further that no incarcerated individual serving a sentence
 imposed upon a conviction for any of the  following  offenses  shall  be
 eligible  for  such  release  unless  in  the  case  of an indeterminate
 sentence he or she has served at least one-half of the minimum period of
 the sentence and in the case of a determinate sentence  he  or  she  has
 served at least one-half of the term of his or her determinate sentence:
 murder  in  the  second  degree,  manslaughter  in the first degree, any
 offense defined in article one hundred thirty of the  penal  law  or  an
 attempt  to  commit  any  of  these  offenses. Solely for the purpose of
 determining medical parole eligibility pursuant to  this  section,  such
 one-half  of  the  minimum period of the indeterminate sentence and one-
 half of the term of the determinate sentence shall not be credited  with
 any  time  served  under the jurisdiction of the department prior to the
 commencement of such sentence  pursuant  to  the  opening  paragraph  of
 subdivision  one  of section 70.30 of the penal law or subdivision two-a
 of section 70.30 of the penal law, except to the  extent  authorized  by

 ed individual serving an indeterminate or determinate sentence of impri-
 sonment who, pursuant to subdivision  two  of  this  section,  has  been
 S. 6131  7
 
 certified  to be suffering from a significant and permanent non-terminal
 condition, disease or syndrome that has rendered the incarcerated  indi-
 vidual  so  physically or cognitively debilitated or incapacitated as to
 create  a  reasonable  probability  that  he or she does not present any
 danger to society, provided, however, that  no  incarcerated  individual
 serving  a  sentence  imposed upon a conviction for [murder in the first
 degree or an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder in the first  degree
 shall  be eligible for such release, and provided further that no incar-
 cerated individual serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for  any
 of  the  following offenses shall be eligible for such release unless in
 the case of an indeterminate sentence he or  she  has  served  at  least
 one-half  of  the  minimum  period  of the sentence and in the case of a

 of  his  or  her  determinate  sentence:  murder  in  the second degree,
 manslaughter in the first degree, any offense  defined  in  article  one
 hundred  thirty  of  the  penal law or an attempt to commit any of these
 offenses. Solely for the purpose of determining medical parole eligibil-
 ity pursuant to this section, such one-half of the minimum period of the
 indeterminate sentence and one-half  of  the  term  of  the  determinate

 ant to the opening paragraph of subdivision one of section 70.30 of  the
 penal law or subdivision two-a of section 70.30 of the penal law, except

 penal law] AN ACT OF TERRORISM AS DEFINED IN SECTION 490.05 OF THE PENAL
 LAW, SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH RELEASE.
  (b) Such release shall be granted only after the [board]  COMMISSIONER
 considers  whether,  in  light  of the incarcerated individual's medical
 condition, there is a reasonable probability that the incarcerated indi-
 vidual, if released, will live and remain at liberty  without  violating
 the  law,  and that such release is not incompatible with the welfare of
 society and will not so deprecate the seriousness of  the  crime  as  to
 undermine  respect  for  the law, and shall be subject to the limits and
 conditions specified in subdivision four of this section. In making this
 determination, the [board] COMMISSIONER shall consider: (i)  the  nature
 and  seriousness of the incarcerated individual's crime; (ii) the incar-
 cerated individual's prior criminal record; (iii) the incarcerated indi-
 vidual's disciplinary, behavioral and rehabilitative record  during  the
 term of his or her incarceration; (iv) [the amount of time the incarcer-
 ated individual must serve before becoming eligible for release pursuant
 to  section  two  hundred fifty-nine-i of this article; (v)] the current

 forth in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, such release may be  granted
 at  any  time  during the term of an incarcerated individual's sentence,
 notwithstanding any other provision of law.
  [(c) The board shall  afford  notice  to  the  sentencing  court,  the
 district  attorney,  the  attorney  for the incarcerated individual and,
 where necessary pursuant to  subdivision  two  of  section  two  hundred
 fifty-nine-i  of  this  article, the crime victim, that the incarcerated
 individual is being considered for release pursuant to this section  and
 S. 6131  8

 the  parties  receiving  notice shall have thirty days to comment on the
 release of the incarcerated individual. Release on medical parole  shall
 not  be  granted until the expiration of the comment period provided for
 in this paragraph.]
  2.  (a)  The  commissioner, on the commissioner's own initiative or at
 the request of an incarcerated individual, or an  incarcerated  individ-
 ual's  spouse, relative or attorney, may, in the exercise of the commis-
 sioner's discretion, direct  that  an  investigation  be  undertaken  to
 determine whether a diagnosis should be made of an incarcerated individ-
 ual  who  appears  to be suffering from a significant and permanent non-
 terminal and incapacitating condition, disease  or  syndrome.  Any  such
 medical  diagnosis  shall  be  made  by a physician licensed to practice
 medicine in this state pursuant to section  sixty-five  hundred  twenty-
 four  of  the  education law. Such physician shall either be employed by
 the department, shall render professional services at the request of the
 department, or shall be employed by a hospital or medical facility  used
 by the department for the medical treatment of incarcerated individuals.
 The  diagnosis  shall  be reported to the commissioner and shall include
 but shall not be limited to a description of the condition,  disease  or
 syndrome suffered by the incarcerated individual, a prognosis concerning
 the  likelihood  that  the incarcerated individual will not recover from
 such condition, disease or syndrome, a description of  the  incarcerated
 individual's  physical  or  cognitive  incapacity  which shall include a
 prediction respecting the likely  duration  of  the  incapacity,  and  a
 statement  by the physician of whether the incarcerated individual is so
 debilitated or incapacitated as to be severely restricted in his or  her
 ability  to self-ambulate or to perform significant normal activities of
 daily living. This report also shall include  a  recommendation  of  the
 type  and  level  of  services and treatment the incarcerated individual
 would require if granted medical parole and  a  recommendation  for  the
 types of settings in which the services and treatment should be given.
  (b) The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall review the
 diagnosis  and may certify that the incarcerated individual is suffering
 from such condition, disease or syndrome and that the incarcerated indi-
 vidual is so debilitated or incapacitated  as  to  create  a  reasonable
 probability  that  he  or  she is physically or cognitively incapable of
 presenting any danger to society. If the commissioner does not so certi-
 fy then the incarcerated individual shall not be referred to  the  board
 for  consideration  for  release  on medical parole. If the commissioner
 does so certify, then the commissioner shall, within seven working  days
 of  receipt of such diagnosis, [refer the incarcerated individual to the
 board for consideration for]  release  THE  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL  on
 medical parole.  However, no such referral of an incarcerated individual
 to the [board of parole] COMMISSIONER shall be made unless the incarcer-
 ated individual has been examined by a physician and diagnosed as having
 a  condition, disease or syndrome as previously described herein at some
 time subsequent to such incarcerated individual's admission to a facili-
 ty operated by the department.
  (c) [When the commissioner refers an incarcerated  individual  to  the
 board,  the]  THE  commissioner  shall  provide  an  appropriate medical
 discharge plan established by the department. The department is  author-
 ized  to  request  assistance from the department of health and from the
 county in which the incarcerated individual resided and committed his or
 her crime, which shall provide assistance with respect to  the  develop-
 ment  and implementation of a discharge plan, including potential place-
 ments of a releasee. The department and the department of  health  shall
 S. 6131  9
 
 jointly develop standards for the medical discharge plan that are appro-
 priately  adapted  to  the  criminal justice setting, based on standards
 established by the department of health for hospital  medical  discharge
 planning.  [The board may postpone its decision pending completion of an
 adequate discharge plan, or may deny release based on inadequacy of  the
 discharge plan.]
  3.  Any certification by the commissioner or the commissioner's desig-
 nee pursuant to this section shall be deemed  a  judicial  function  and
 shall not be reviewable if done in accordance with law.
  4.  (a) Medical parole granted pursuant to this section shall be for a
 period of six months.
  (b) The [board] COMMISSIONER shall require as a condition  of  release
 on  medical parole that the releasee agree to remain under the care of a
 physician while on medical parole and in a hospital established pursuant
 to article twenty-eight of the public health law, a hospice  established
 pursuant  to  article forty of the public health law or any other place-
 ment, including a residence with family  or  others,  that  can  provide
 appropriate  medical  care  as  specified  in the medical discharge plan
 required by subdivision two of this section. The medical discharge  plan
 shall  state  that the availability of the placement has been confirmed,
 and by whom.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when an incar-
 cerated individual who qualifies  for  release  under  this  section  is
 cognitively incapable of signing the requisite documentation to effectu-
 ate  the  medical  discharge plan and, after a diligent search no person
 has been identified who could otherwise be appointed as the incarcerated
 individual's guardian by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, solely
 for the purpose of implementing the medical discharge plan, the facility
 health services director at the facility where the incarcerated individ-
 ual is currently incarcerated shall be lawfully empowered to act as  the
 incarcerated  individual's  guardian for the purpose of effectuating the
 medical discharge.
  (c) Where appropriate, the [board] COMMISSIONER  shall  require  as  a
 condition  of  release  that medical parolees be supervised on intensive
 caseloads at reduced supervision ratios.
  (d) The [board] COMMISSIONER shall require as a condition  of  release
 on  medical  parole  that the releasee undergo periodic medical examina-
 tions and a medical examination at least one month prior to the  expira-
 tion  of  the period of medical parole and, for the purposes of making a
 decision pursuant to paragraph (e) of this subdivision, that the releas-
 ee provide the [board] COMMISSIONER  with  a  report,  prepared  by  the
 treating  physician,  of  the  results  of such examination. Such report
 shall specifically state whether or not the parolee continues to  suffer
 from  a  significant  and permanent non-terminal and debilitating condi-
 tion, disease, or syndrome, and to be so debilitated or incapacitated as
 to be severely restricted in his or her ability to self-ambulate  or  to
 perform significant normal activities of daily living.
  (e)  Prior  to  the  expiration  of  the  period of medical parole the
 [board]  COMMISSIONER  shall  review  the  medical  examination  report
 required  by  paragraph  (d)  of  this  subdivision  and may again grant
 medical parole pursuant to this section;  provided,  however,  that  the
 provisions  of  paragraph  (c) of subdivision one and subdivision two of
 this section shall not apply.
  (f) If the updated medical report presented to the [board] COMMISSION-
 ER states that a parolee released pursuant to this section is no  longer
 so  debilitated  or  incapacitated as to create a reasonable probability
 that he or she is physically  or  cognitively  incapable  of  presenting
 S. 6131  10
 
 [any] A danger to society or if the releasee fails to submit the updated
 medical report then the [board] COMMISSIONER may not make a new grant of
 medical  parole pursuant to paragraph (e) of this subdivision. Where the
 [board]  COMMISSIONER  has  not  granted medical parole pursuant to such
 paragraph (e) the [board] COMMISSIONER shall promptly  conduct  [through
 one  of  its  members,]  or  cause  to be conducted by a hearing officer
 [designated by the board,] a hearing to determine whether  the  releasee
 is suffering from a significant and permanent non-terminal and incapaci-
 tating condition, disease or syndrome and is so debilitated or incapaci-
 tated as to create a reasonable probability that he or she is physically
 or  cognitively  incapable  of presenting any danger to society and does
 not present a danger to society. If the [board] COMMISSIONER makes  such
 a  determination  then  [it]  HE  OR SHE may make a new grant of medical
 parole pursuant to the standards of paragraph (b) of subdivision one  of
 this  section.  At  the  hearing,  the  releasee shall have the right to
 representation by counsel, including  the  right,  if  the  releasee  is
 financially  unable  to  retain  counsel,  to have the appropriate court
 assign counsel in accordance with the county or city plan for  represen-
 tation  placed in operation pursuant to article eighteen-B of the county
 law.
  (g) The hearing and determination provided for  by  paragraph  (f)  of
 this  subdivision  shall  be  concluded  within  the six month period of
 medical parole. If the [board] COMMISSIONER does not renew the grant  of
 medical parole, [it] HE OR SHE shall order that the releasee be returned
 immediately to the custody of the department of correctional services.
  (h)  In  addition to the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this
 subdivision, medical parole may be revoked at any time upon any  of  the
 grounds  specified  in paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section two
 hundred fifty-nine-i of this article, and in accordance with the  proce-
 dures specified in subdivision three of section two hundred fifty-nine-i
 of this article.
  (i)  A  releasee who is on medical parole and who becomes eligible for
 parole pursuant to the provisions of  subdivision  two  of  section  two
 hundred  fifty-nine-i  of  this  article  shall  be  eligible for parole
 consideration pursuant to such subdivision.
  5. A denial of release on medical  parole  or  expiration  of  medical
 parole in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of subdivision
 four of this section shall not preclude the incarcerated individual from
 reapplying  for medical parole or otherwise affect an incarcerated indi-
 vidual's eligibility for any other form of release provided for by law.
  6. To the extent that any provision of this section  requires  disclo-
 sure of medical information for the purpose of processing an application
 or  making a decision, regarding release on medical parole or renewal of
 medical parole, or for the purpose of appropriately supervising a person
 released on medical parole, and that such disclosure would otherwise  be
 prohibited  by  article  twenty-seven-F  of  the  public health law, the
 provisions of this section shall be controlling.
  7. The commissioner [and the chair of the board] shall  be  authorized
 to  promulgate  rules  and regulations for [their] HIS OR HER respective
 [agencies] AGENCY to implement the provisions of this section.

 section  may  be  appealed  pursuant  to subdivision four of section two
 hundred fifty-nine-i of this article.
