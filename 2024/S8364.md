  The superintendent or the attorney-general may bring an action for the

 HOLDS  AMOUNTS  IN  RESERVE FOR AN ASSET-BACKED TOKEN, INCLUDING STABLE-
 COIN, BEFORE MAKING A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER SUCH  AMOUNTS  ARE  SAFE-
 GUARDED  FROM FRAUD, WASTE, OR ABUSE. IF SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT DETERMINED
 TO BE AT RISK, SUCH AMOUNTS MAY CONTINUE TO BE HELD IN THE NAME  OF  THE
 SUPERINTENDENT,  OR  A RECEIVER DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE SUPERINTENDENT
 TO ADMINISTER SUCH AMOUNTS, AND SUCH FUNDS SHALL NOT BE MADE A  PART  OF
 ANY  ESTATE  IN  BANKRUPTCY.  ANY CUSTOMER OF SUCH LIMITED PURPOSE TRUST

 bailment or of deposit for hire, or lease of safe, vault or box, if any,
 between the person to whom such notice is mailed and such banking organ-
 ization shall cease and determine upon the date  for  removal  fixed  in
 such  notice. Such person shall have a claim against such banking organ-
 ization for the amount of the unearned rent or charges, if any, paid  by
 such  person  from  the  date  fixed  in such notice, if the property or
 contents is removed on or before such date, or from the date  of  actual
 removal, if the property or contents is removed after such date.

 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
