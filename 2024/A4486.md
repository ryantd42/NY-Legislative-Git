 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in  relation  to  requiring
  the court to provide a range of dates for a person pleading not guilty
  to a traffic infraction to appear
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 1806 of the vehicle and traffic law, as amended  by
 section  1  of  part  C of chapter 55 of the laws of 2012, is amended to
 read as follows:
  § 1806. Plea of not guilty by  a  defendant  charged  with  a  traffic
 infraction.  In  addition to appearing personally to enter a plea of not
 guilty to a violation of any provision of the tax law or the transporta-
 tion law  regulating  traffic,  or  to  a  traffic  infraction  for  the
 violation  of any of the provisions of the vehicle and traffic law or of
 any local law, ordinance, order, rule  or  regulation  relating  to  the
 operation of motor vehicles or motorcycles, a defendant may enter a plea
 of  not  guilty  by mailing to the court of appropriate jurisdiction the
 ticket making the charge and a signed statement  indicating  such  plea.
 Such  plea  must  be  sent:  (a) by registered or certified mail, return
 receipt requested or by first class mail;  and  (b)  within  forty-eight
 hours  after  receiving  such  ticket.  Upon  receipt of such ticket and
 statement, the court shall advise the violator, by first class mail,  of
 an  appearance  at  which  no  testimony shall be taken. THE COURT SHALL
 PROVIDE THE VIOLATOR WITH A RANGE OF DATES TO APPEAR WHICH SHALL INCLUDE
 AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT DATES AND  TIMES  AT  WHICH  THE  VIOLATOR  MAY
 APPEAR.  If  the  motorist requests a trial, the court shall set a trial
 date on a date subsequent to the date  of  the  initial  appearance  and
 shall  notify  the  defendant  of  the  date  by first class mail but no
 warrant of arrest for failure to appear can be issued until the violator
 is notified of a new court appearance date by  registered  or  certified
 mail, return receipt requested, and fails to appear.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
