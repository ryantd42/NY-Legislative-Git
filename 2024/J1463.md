  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 27, 2024, as Holocaust  Remembrance  Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious events
that affect the lives of the citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  tradition,  it  is  the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  27,  2024,  as
Holocaust  Remembrance Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of International Holocaust Remembrance Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, From 1933 to 1945, 5.8 million Jews were  murdered  in  the
Nazi Holocaust as part of a systematic program of genocide, and millions
of other people also perished as victims of Nazism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jews  who fell under German control in Eastern and Central
Europe were quickly and cruelly stripped of their rights  and  property;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Jews who perished at Nazi hands comprised two-thirds of
all  European  Jewry,  and in countries such as Poland, which before the
second World War included parts of Ukraine and Belarus, the Jewish death
toll surpassed 90 percent; and
 
  WHEREAS, The year 2024 marks the 91st Anniversary of  the  beginning
of  the genocide of European Jews, which is the bleakest, most murderous
moment in history; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Holocaust represents the darkest period in the  history
of  civilization  of  mankind  and must always be remembered in order to
prevent its reoccurrence and promote respect and common humanity; and
 
  WHEREAS, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is  observed
on  January  27th  each  year,  is  a  day set aside for remembering the
millions of victims of the Holocaust; this date was  designated  by  the
United  Nations  General  Assembly  on November 1, 2005, as it marks the
date when Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi death camp, which in  its
operation murdered over one million Jews, was liberated by Soviet troops
in 1945, freeing over 7,000 prisoners; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The year 2024 marks the 79th Anniversary of the liberation
of Auschwitz-Birkenau; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remembrance  ceremonies  are  held  throughout  the  United
States  and around the world to remember the tragedy of the Holocaust on
January 27th, including at Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and  in
the halls of the United Nations in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  critically important to remember the events of the
Holocaust to ensure that the events shall never  again  happen,  as  has
been the rallying cry among the Jewish people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  the  recent acts of hatred and violence against
the Jewish Community, it is critical that we stand together to decry all
forms of hate and bigotry in our communities and across this  State,  so
we  ensure that suffering on the scale of the Holocaust truly never does
happen again; and
 
  WHEREAS, Knowing that the events and root causes  of  the  Holocaust
must  not  be  forgotten and that, particularly as survivors diminish in
number, links  must  be  forged  to  educate  future  generations;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  27,  2024,  as
Holocaust Remembrance Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
