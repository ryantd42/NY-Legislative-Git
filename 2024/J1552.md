  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as Sarcoidosis Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as Sarcoidosis
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory  disease  which  can  affect
almost any organ in the body; it causes heightened immunity, which means
that  a  person's  immune  system, which normally protects the body from
infection and disease, overreacts, resulting in damage to the body's own
tissues; and
 
  WHEREAS, The classic feature of  sarcoidosis  is  the  formation  of
granulomas,  microscopic  clumps  of  inflammatory  cells  which  group
together, and look like granules; when too many of these clumps form  in
an organ, they can interfere with how that organ functions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sarcoidosis  can  affect  almost  any  organ  in  the body
including  the  heart,  skin,  liver,  kidneys,  brain,  sinuses,  eyes,
muscles,  bones,  and other areas but it most commonly targets the lungs
and lymph nodes which are an important part of the immune system; and
 
  WHEREAS, When sarcoidosis affects the lungs, it is called  pulmonary
sarcoidosis;  90% or more of people diagnosed with the disease have lung
involvement; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sarcoidosis can be tricky to diagnose and is often confused
with other diseases; many people with sarcoidosis think  they  have  the
flu or a respiratory infection before they are properly diagnosed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Common symptoms of sarcoidosis include: cough, shortness of
breath,  chest  pain,  night  sweats,  fatigue, and wheezing or abnormal
breathing, as well as feeling congested; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sarcoidosis also can cause the following:  skin  rashes  or
raised  bumps  on  the  skin,  joint  pain or stiffness, eye irritation,
dryness of the eyes and sometimes blurry  vision,  fast  heart  rate  or
lightheadedness,  kidney  stones,  increased  levels  of  calcium in the
bloodstream, and abnormal liver function; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  exact  cause  of  sarcoidosis  is  unknown;  while  no
specific gene mutation has been shown to cause sarcoidosis, it sometimes
runs  in  families,  and  there  may  be  a  genetic tendency to develop
sarcoidosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Some research suggests that an  infection  or  exposure  to
something in the environment can trigger the immune system to overreact;
unfortunately,  many  of our heroic First Responders to the 9/11 tragedy
in New York City, have sarcoidosis due to breathing in the  heavy  dust;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  has been found that people of African and Scandinavian
descent are slightly more likely to develop sarcoidosis than Caucasians;
women are more likely to develop the disease than men; some exposures to
dusty  or  moldy  environments  have  increased  risk  of  developing
sarcoidosis, and people between 20 to 40 years of age are more likely to
develop sarcoidosis than others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Legislature continues its commitment to
educate the public in the importance of early detection and  prevention,
to  support  institutions  that  further  research  and knowledge in the
treatment of sarcoidosis, and to  promote  an  environment  in  which  a
healthy  lifestyle  will  result  in  healthy  minds  and  bodies;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as Sarcoidosis
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
