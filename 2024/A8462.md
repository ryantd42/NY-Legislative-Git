 Introduced by M. of A. DINOWITZ -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil practice law and rules, in relation to prohib-
  iting  the enforcement of mandatory arbitration agreements clauses and
  joint-action waivers with respect to workplace disputes

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Workers'
 Rights Enforceability Act".
  § 2.  Legislative findings. 1. The legislature finds and declares that
 the use and enforcement of mandatory arbitration clauses  and  joint-ac-
 tion waivers in cases alleging workplace violations has been and contin-
 ues  to be contrary to New York public policy. Accordingly, when federal
 law does not require enforcement of mandatory  arbitration  clauses  and
 joint-action waivers, New York law does not permit their enforcement.
  2. The legislature further finds and declares that courts have miscon-
 strued previous amendments to section 7515 of the civil practice law and
 rules and that such amendments were intended and remain intended to have
 retroactive  effect and to nullify mandatory arbitration clauses entered
 into prior to the original enactment of section 7515 of the civil  prac-
 tice law and rules.
  §  3.  Section  7515  of the civil practice law and rules, as added by
 section 1 of subpart B of part KK of chapter 57 of  the  laws  of  2018,
 paragraphs  2  and 3 of subdivision (a) as amended by chapter 160 of the
 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  § 7515. Mandatory arbitration clauses; prohibited. (a) Definitions. As
 used in this section:
  1. The term "employer" shall have the  same  meaning  as  provided  in
 subdivision five of section two hundred ninety-two of the executive law.
  2.  The  term  "prohibited clause" shall mean any MANDATORY PREDISPUTE
 ARBITRATION clause [or provision] OR  ANY  MANDATORY  POSTDISPUTE  ARBI-

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF A PROHIBITED CLAUSE TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER
 APPLIES, SHALL BE DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, IRRE-
 SPECTIVE  OF  WHETHER  THE  PARTY  RESISTING  ARBITRATION CHALLENGES THE
 PROHIBITED CLAUSE SPECIFICALLY OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER TERMS OF THE
 CONTRACT  CONTAINING SUCH PROHIBITED CLAUSE, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER
 THE PROHIBITED CLAUSE, OR THE  CONTRACT,  HANDBOOK,  OR  OTHER  DOCUMENT
 ADOPTED AS THE POLICY OF A COVERED ENTITY IN WHICH THE PROHIBITED CLAUSE
 IS  FOUND,  PURPORTS  TO  DELEGATE SUCH DETERMINATIONS TO AN ARBITRATOR.
 EXCEPT WHERE INCONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW, AN ISSUE AS TO WHETHER  THIS
 SECTION  APPLIES WITH RESPECT TO A PROHIBITED CLAUSE SHALL BE DETERMINED
 UNDER STATE LAW.
  (F) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CHOICE OF LAW CLAUSE IN A CONTRACT,  HANDBOOK,
 OR OTHER DOCUMENT ADOPTED AS THE POLICY OF A COVERED ENTITY IN WHICH THE
 PROHIBITED  CLAUSE  IS  FOUND, OR ANY OTHER CONTRACTUAL PROVISION TO THE
 CONTRARY, NEW YORK LAW GOVERNS THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS  SECTION  TO  A
 PROHIBITED CLAUSE FOR A WORKER WHO, FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR
 SERVICES FOR A COVERED ENTITY, PERFORMED SERVICES IN NEW YORK.
  §  4.  Severability and construction.  If any clause, sentence, para-
 graph, subdivision, section or part of this act shall be adjudged by any
 court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, or its  applicability  to
 any  person or circumstance is declared invalid, such judgment shall not
 affect, impair, or  invalidate  the  remainder  thereof,  but  shall  be
 confined  in  its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion, section or part thereof directly involved in  the  controversy  in
 which  such  judgment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to
 be the intent of the legislature that this act would have  been  enacted
 even  if  such  invalid  provisions  had not been included herein.  The
 provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to  give  effect  to
 the purposes hereof.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
