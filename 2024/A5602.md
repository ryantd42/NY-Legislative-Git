 liability  for  defects  in bridges over which the state has no control.
 Within the limits of incorporated villages the state  shall  maintain  a
 width of pavement equal to the width of pavement constructed or improved
 at  the  expense  of  the state, if a state highway, the location of the
 state's portion of such roadway within said incorporated  limits  to  be
 determined  by  the  center line of the roadway as shown on the plans on
 file with the department of transportation and the state shall be liable
 for damages to persons or property only when such damage shall occur  as
