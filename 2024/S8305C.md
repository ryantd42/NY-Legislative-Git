 S. 8305--B  10
 
  2. Preliminary injunction. (a) Pending a proceeding  for  a  permanent
 injunction  pursuant  to  this section the court may grant a preliminary
 injunction enjoining the unlicensed activity and the person  or  persons
 conducting,  maintaining,  or  permitting  the  unlicensed activity from
 further  conducting, maintaining, or permitting the unlicensed activity,
 where the public health, safety  or  welfare  immediately  requires  the
 granting  of  such  injunction. A temporary closing order may be granted
 pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction where it appears by clear
 and convincing evidence that unlicensed activity  within  the  scope  of
 this  section  is being conducted, maintained, or permitted and that the
 public health, safety or welfare immediately requires the granting of  a
 temporary  closing  order.  A temporary restraining order may be granted
 pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction.
  (b) A preliminary injunction shall be enforced by the  office  or,  at
 the  request  of the office, the attorney general. At the request of the
 office, a police officer or peace officer  with  jurisdiction  may  also
 enforce the preliminary injunction.
  (c)  The  office  or the attorney general shall show, by affidavit and
 such other evidence as may be submitted, that there is a cause of action
 for a permanent injunction abating unlicensed activity.
  3. Temporary closing order. (a) If, on  a  motion  for  a  preliminary
 injunction  alleging unlicensed activity as described in this section in
 a building or premises used for commercial purposes only, the office  or
 the  attorney general demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that
 such unlicensed activity is being conducted,  maintained,  or  permitted
 and  that  the  public health, safety, or welfare immediately requires a
 temporary closing order, a temporary order  closing  such  part  of  the
 building  or  premises  wherein  such  unlicensed  activity  is  being
 conducted, maintained, or permitted may be granted without notice, pend-
 ing order of the court granting or refusing the  preliminary  injunction
 and  until further order of the court. Upon granting a temporary closing
 order, the court shall direct the holding of a hearing for the  prelimi-
 nary  injunction at the earliest possible time but no later than [three]
 TEN business days from the granting of such order;  a  decision  on  the
 motion for a preliminary injunction shall be rendered by the court with-
 in  [three  business]  THIRTY  CALENDAR days after the conclusion of the
 hearing.
  (b) Unless the court  orders  otherwise,  a  temporary  closing  order
 together with the papers upon which it was based and a notice of hearing
 for  the  preliminary injunction shall be personally served, in the same
 manner as a summons as provided in the civil practice law and rules.
  (c) [A temporary closing order shall only be issued prior to a hearing
 on a preliminary injunction if the building  or  premises  is  used  for
 commercial purposes only.
  (d)]  No  temporary closing order shall be issued against any building
 or premises where, in addition  to  the  unlicensed  activity  which  is
 alleged,  activity that is licensed or otherwise lawful remains in place
 AND THE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IS MERELY A DE MINIMIS PART OF THE BUSINESS.
 IN ASSESSING WHETHER UNLICENSED ACTIVITY WITHIN A BUILDING  OR  PREMISES
 IS  MORE  THAN DE MINIMIS, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS: (I)
 THE PRESENCE OF SIGNS OR SYMBOLS, INDOORS OR OUT, ADVERTISING UNLICENSED
 ACTIVITY OR OTHERWISE INDICATING THAT CANNABIS IS SOLD ON THE  PREMISES;
 (II)  INFORMATION  SHARED  IN  ANY  ADVERTISEMENTS  OR  OTHER  MARKETING
 CONTENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SOCIAL MEDIA, IN  CONNECTION  WITH
 THE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY; (III) THE LAYOUT OF THE BUSINESS WITH REGARD TO
 LAWFUL  AND UNLICENSED ACTIVITIES OCCURRING ON THE PREMISES; AND (IV) AN
 S. 8305--B  11
 
 ASSESSMENT OF THE VOLUME OF  CANNABIS,  CANNABIS  PRODUCTS,  CANNABINOID
 HEMP,  HEMP  EXTRACT PRODUCT, OR ANY PRODUCT MARKETED OR LABELED AS SUCH
 AT SUCH PLACE OF BUSINESS. In addition, no temporary closing order shall
 be  issued  against  any  building  or premises which is used in part as
 residence and pursuant to local law or ordinance is zoned  and  lawfully
 occupied as a residence.
  4.  Temporary restraining order. (a) If, on a motion for a preliminary
 injunction alleging unlicensed activity as described in this section  in
 a  building  or premises used for commercial purposes, the office or the
 attorney general demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that such
 unlicensed activity is being conducted,  maintained,  or  permitted  and
 that the public health, safety, or welfare immediately requires a tempo-
 rary  restraining  order,  a  temporary restraining order may be granted
 without notice restraining the defendants and all persons from  removing
 or  in  any  manner interfering with the furniture, fixtures and movable
 property used in conducting, maintaining or permitting  such  unlicensed
 activity,  including [adult-use] cannabis, CANNABIS PRODUCT, CANNABINOID
 HEMP OR HEMP EXTRACT PRODUCT, OR ANY PRODUCT MARKETED OR LABELED AS SUCH
 and from further conducting, maintaining or permitting  such  unlicensed
 activity,  pending  order of the court granting or refusing the prelimi-
 nary injunction and until further order of the court.  Upon  granting  a
 temporary  restraining  order,  the  court shall direct the holding of a
 hearing for the preliminary injunction at the earliest possible time but
 no later than three business days from the granting  of  such  order;  a
 decision on the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be rendered by
 the court within [three business] THIRTY CALENDAR days after the conclu-
 sion of the hearing.
  (b)  Unless  the court orders otherwise, a temporary restraining order
 and the papers upon which it was based and a notice of hearing  for  the
 preliminary injunction shall be personally served, in the same manner as
 a  summons  as  provided  in  the civil practice law and rules, UPON ANY
 AGENT, EMPLOYEE, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEFENDANT BUSINESS PRES-
 ENT AT THE TIME THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER IS EFFECTUATED.
  5. Temporary closing order; temporary  restraining  order;  additional
 enforcement procedures. (a) If on a motion for a preliminary injunction,
 the  office  of  cannabis  management  or  the  attorney general submits
 evidence warranting both a  temporary  closing  order  and  a  temporary
 restraining order, the court shall grant both orders.
  (b)  Upon the request of the office, any police officer or peace offi-
 cer with jurisdiction may assist in the enforcement of a temporary clos-
 ing order and temporary restraining order. ANY REFERENCE TO POLICE OFFI-
 CER OR PEACE OFFICER IN THIS SUBDIVISION AND SUBDIVISIONS SIX AND  SEVEN
 OF  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  ALSO  INCLUDE ANY INVESTIGATOR EMPLOYED BY THE
 OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
  (c) The police officer or peace officer serving  a  temporary  closing
 order  or  a temporary restraining order shall forthwith make and return
 to the court an inventory of personal property situated in and  used  in
 conducting,  maintaining,  or  permitting the unlicensed activity within
 the scope of this chapter and shall enter upon the building or  premises
 for  such  purpose. Such inventory shall be taken in any manner which is
 deemed likely to evidence a true  and  accurate  representation  of  the
 personal  property  subject to such inventory including, but not limited
 to photographing such personal property, EXCEPT THAT ANY CASH  FOUND  ON
 THE  PREMISES  DURING  SUCH  INVENTORY SHALL BE INVENTORIED, SEIZED, AND
 SECURED OFF PREMISES PENDING FURTHER ORDER  OF  THE  COURT.  ANY  POLICE
 OFFICER  OR PEACE OFFICER, OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OFFICE, SHALL BE
 S. 8305--B  12
 
 PERMITTED TO REVIEW  AND  COPY  RECORDS,  INCLUDING  ELECTRONIC  RECORDS
 STORED ON CLOUD PLATFORMS.
  (d)  The  police  officer or peace officer serving a temporary closing
 order shall, upon service of the order, command all persons  present  in
 the  building  or  premises  to  vacate the premises forthwith. Upon the
 building or premises being  vacated,  the  premises  shall  be  securely
 locked and all keys delivered to the officer serving the order who ther-
 eafter  [shall] MAY deliver the keys to the fee owner, lessor, or lessee
 of the building or premises involved.  If  the  fee  owner,  lessor,  or
 lessee  is  not  at  the  building  or  premises when the order is being
 executed, the officer shall securely padlock the premises and retain the
 keys until the fee owner, lessor, or lessee of the  building  is  ascer-
 tained, in which event, the officer [shall] MAY deliver the keys to such
 owner,  lessor,  or  lessee  OR RETAIN THEM PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE
 COURT.
  (e) Upon service of a temporary closing order or a temporary restrain-
 ing order, the police officer or peace officer shall post a copy thereof
 in a conspicuous place or upon one or more of  the  principal  doors  at
 entrances  of  such  premises  where  the  unlicensed  activity is being
 conducted, maintained, or permitted.  In  addition,  where  a  temporary
 closing  order has been granted, the officer shall affix, in a conspicu-
 ous place or upon one or more of the principal  doors  at  entrances  of
 such  premises,  a  printed notice that the premises have been closed by
 court order, which notice shall contain  the  legend  "closed  by  court
 order"  in  block  lettering of sufficient size to be observed by anyone
 intending or likely to enter the premises, the date of  the  order,  the
 court  from  which issued, and the name of the officer or agency posting
 the notice. In addition, where a temporary restraining  order  has  been
 granted,  the  police  officer or peace officer shall affix, in the same
 manner, a notice similar to the notice provided for  in  relation  to  a
 temporary  closing order except that the notice shall state that certain
 described activity is prohibited by court  order  and  that  removal  of
 property  is  prohibited by court order. Mutilation or removal of such a
 posted order or such a posted notice while it remains in force, in addi-
 tion to any other punishment prescribed by law, shall be punishable,  on
 conviction,  by  a  fine  of  not  more than five thousand dollars or by
 imprisonment not exceeding ninety days, or by both, provided such  order
 or  notice contains therein a notice of such penalty. Any police officer
 or peace officer with jurisdiction may, upon the request of the  office,
 assist in the enforcement of this section.

 MAINTAIN  THE  PROCEEDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN
 THIS SECTION, if [the] A defendant WHO IS  THE  FEE  OWNER,  LESSOR,  OR
 LESSEE  OF  THE  BUILDING  OR PREMISES shows by affidavit and such other
 proof as may be submitted that the unlicensed activity within the  scope
 of  this  chapter  has been abated AND THAT THEY ARE ALSO NOT AFFILIATED
 WITH THE PERSON WHO IS CONDUCTING  THE  UNLICENSED  ACTIVITY.  An  order
 vacating  a  temporary  closing  order  or a temporary restraining order
 shall include a provision authorizing the office, OR ANY  COUNTY  ATTOR-
 NEY, CORPORATION COUNSEL, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AS APPLICABLE, to inspect
 the  building  or premises which is the subject of a proceeding pursuant
 to this subdivision, periodically without notice, during the pendency of
 S. 8305--B  13
 
 the proceeding for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the  unli-
 censed  activity  has  been resumed. Any police officer or peace officer
 with jurisdiction may, upon the request of the  office,  assist  in  the
 enforcement  of an inspection provision of an order vacating a temporary
 closing order or temporary restraining order.
  (b) A temporary closing order or a temporary restraining order may  be
 vacated by the court, upon notice to the office, OR ANY COUNTY ATTORNEY,
 CORPORATION  COUNSEL,  OR  LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AS APPLICABLE, when [the] A

 SUBDIVISION  gives  an  undertaking  and the court is satisfied that the
 public health, safety, or welfare will be  protected  adequately  during
 the  pendency  of  the proceeding. The undertaking shall be in an amount
 equal to the assessed valuation of the building or  premises  where  the
 unlicensed  activity  is being conducted, maintained, or permitted or in
 such other amount as may be fixed by the court. The defendant shall  pay
 to  the  office  and  the  attorney  general, in the event a judgment of
 permanent injunction is  obtained,  their  actual  costs,  expenses  and
 disbursements  in  bringing and maintaining the proceeding. In addition,

 UCT  MARKETED  OR  LABELED  AS  SUCH  seized shall be turned over to the
 office of cannabis management or their  authorized  representative.  The
 judgment  may  further  direct  any police officer or peace officer with
 jurisdiction to seize and remove from the building or premises all mate-
 rial, equipment, and instrumentalities used in the creation and  mainte-
 nance  of the unlicensed activity and shall direct the sale by the sher-
 iff of any such property in the manner provided for the sale of personal
 property under execution pursuant to the provisions of the  civil  prac-
 tice  law  and rules, IF THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PROPERTY EXCEEDS THE
 ESTIMATED LAWFUL EXPENSES OF SUCH SALE, OR THE DISPOSAL OF THE  PROPERTY

 LAWFUL EXPENSES OF SUCH SALE. The net proceeds of any such  sale,  after
 deduction  of the lawful expenses involved, shall be paid to the general
 fund of the state.
  (b) A judgment awarding a permanent injunction pursuant to this  chap-
 ter  may  direct  the  closing of the building or premises by any police
 officer or peace officer with jurisdiction to the  extent  necessary  to
 abate  the  unlicensed  activity  and shall direct any police officer or
 peace officer with jurisdiction to post a copy of  the  judgment  and  a
 printed  notice  of  such closing conforming to the requirements of this
 chapter. The closing directed by the judgment shall be for  such  period
 as the court may direct but in no event shall the closing be for a peri-
 od  of  more than one year from the posting of the judgment provided for
 in this section.  If the owner shall file a bond in  the  value  of  the
 property  ordered  to  be closed and submits proof to the court that the
 unlicensed activity has been abated and will not be created, maintained,
 or permitted for such period of time as the  building  or  premises  has

 CENSED ACTIVITY, the court may vacate the  provisions  of  the  judgment
 S. 8305--B  14
 
 that  direct  the  closing  of  the building or premises. A closing by a
 police officer or  peace  officer  with  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of  this  section shall not constitute an act of possession,
 ownership,  or  control  by  such police officer or peace officer of the
 closed premises.
  (c) Upon the request of the  office  of  cannabis  management  or  its
 authorized  representative, OR ANY COUNTY ATTORNEY, CORPORATION COUNSEL,

 named in the petition in such proceeding, such lien  to  date  from  the
 time of filing a notice of lis pendens in the office of the clerk of the
 county  wherein  the  building  or  premises is located. Every such lien
 shall have priority before any mortgage or other lien that exists  prior
 to such filing except tax and assessment liens.

 ter shall provide, in addition to the costs and disbursements allowed by
 the civil practice law and rules, upon satisfactory proof  by  affidavit
 or  such  other evidence as may be submitted, the actual costs, expenses
 and disbursements of the office and the  attorney  general,  OR  OF  ANY

 ING ANY HEARINGS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH PENAL-
 TIES; AND
 S. 8305--B  17
 
  (B)  ESTABLISH  A  PROCESS BY WHICH THE COUNTY, TOWN, CITY, OR VILLAGE
 SHALL EXECUTE ANY CLOSURE ORDERS, AND A PROCESS BY WHICH  THE  ENFORCING
 ENTITY  SHALL  BE REQUIRED TO SEIZE ALL CANNABIS, CANNABIS PRODUCTS, AND

  §  10.  Subdivisions  1  and  1-a  of section 132 of the cannabis law,
 subdivision 1 as amended and subdivision 1-a as added by section  17  of
 part  UU  of  chapter  56  of  the  laws of 2023, are amended to read as

  1.(a) Any person who cultivates for sale, OFFERS  TO  SELL,  or  sells
 cannabis,  cannabis  products, medical cannabis, or any product marketed
 or labeled as such, without having an appropriate registration,  license
 or  permit  therefor, including a person whose registration, license, or
 permit has been revoked, surrendered or cancelled, where such person  is
 engaging  in  activity  for which a license would be required under this
 chapter, may be subject to a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand
 dollars for each day during which such violation continues and an  addi-
 tional civil penalty in an amount of no more than five times the revenue
 from  such prohibited sales or, in an amount of no more than three times
 the projected revenue for any such product found in  the  possession  of
 such  person  based on the retail list price of such products; provided,
 however, that any such person who engages in such activity from a  resi-
 dence  or  other  real  property  not  otherwise held out as open to the
 public or otherwise being utilized in a business or commercial manner or
 any private vehicle on or about same such property, and the quantity  of
 such  product  on such premises or vehicle does not exceed the limits of
 personal use under article two hundred twenty-two of the penal law,  may
 be subject to a civil penalty of no more than five thousand dollars.
  Provided,  further,  that  where such person has been ordered to cease
 such conduct pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred  thirty-
 eight-a  of  this [chapter] ARTICLE, such person may be assessed a civil
 penalty of no more than twenty thousand dollars per  day  for  each  day
 during  which  such  violation  continues  after receiving such order in
 addition to the additional civil penalties set  forth  above;  provided,
 however,  that any such person who engages in such activity from a resi-
 dence or other real property not otherwise  held  out  as  open  to  the
 public or otherwise being utilized in a business or commercial manner or
 any  private vehicle on or about same such property, and the quantity of
 such product on such premises or vehicle does not exceed the  limits  of
 personal  use under article two hundred twenty-two of the penal law, may
 be subject to a civil penalty of no more than ten thousand dollars.
  (b) If a person engaging in the conduct described in paragraph (a)  of
 this  subdivision[,]  or  subdivision  one-a  of this section refuses to
 permit the office or the board from performing a regulatory  inspection,
 such person may be assessed a civil penalty of up to [four] TWENTY thou-
 sand  dollars  for  a  first  refusal  and  up to [eight] FORTY thousand
 dollars for a second or subsequent refusal within three years of a prior
 refusal. If the office or board is not permitted access for a regulatory
 inspection pursuant to section ten or section eleven of this chapter, as
 applicable, by such person, the attorney general, upon  the  request  of
 the office or the board, shall be authorized to apply, without notice to
 such  person,  to  the supreme court in the county in which the place of
 business is located for an order granting the office or board access  to
 such  place  of business. The court may grant such an order if it deter-
 mines, based on evidence presented by the attorney general,  that  there
 is reasonable cause to believe that such place of business is a place of
 S. 8305--B  18
 
 business which does not possess a valid registration, license, or permit
 issued by the office or board.
  (c)  In assessing the civil penalties under this subdivision OR SUBDI-
 VISION ONE-A OF THIS SECTION,  the  board  or  office  shall  take  into
 consideration  the  nature  of such violation and shall assess a penalty
 that is proportionate to the violation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT AN AFFI-
 DAVIT FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OFFICE, THE OFFICE  OF  THE  ATTORNEY
 GENERAL, OR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT, OR A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER CONFIRMING THE
 PRESENCE  OF  CONDUCT DESCRIBED IN THIS SUBDIVISION OR SUBDIVISION ONE-A
 FOLLOWING AN INSPECTION BY THE OFFICE AFTER THE OFFICE HAS ORDERED  SUCH
 CONDUCT  TO  CEASE  SHALL  BE SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE
 THAT SUCH CONDUCT HAD BEEN CONTINUING FOR EACH BUSINESS DAY BETWEEN  THE
 INITIAL  INSPECTION  AND  THE  LAST  OBSERVED  OR  OTHERWISE  DOCUMENTED
 CONDUCT, AND SHALL REQUIRE THE IMPOSITION OF THE MAXIMUM PER DAY PENALTY
 PERMITTED UNDER PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION,  AND  THE  DOCUMENTED
 PRESENCE  OF SUCH CONDUCT UPON OR AT THE COMPLETION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE
 INSPECTION OR INVESTIGATION SHALL REQUIRE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE  MAXIMUM
 PENALTY PERMITTED UNDER PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  1-a. Any person [found to have] WHO engaged in indirect retail sale in
 violation  of  subdivision  one-a  of section one hundred twenty-five of
 this [chapter] ARTICLE, shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount
 equaling the lesser of three times the revenue for such indirect  retail
 sales  or  up  to  two thousand five hundred dollars for each such sale,
 provided, however, that where such conduct also constitutes a  violation
 of  subdivision  one of this section, such person may only be subject to
 the civil penalties under one such subdivision, and  provided,  further,
 that  where  such person has been ordered to cease such conduct pursuant
 to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-a of  this  arti-
 cle,  such person may be assessed a civil penalty of up to five thousand
 dollars for each day during which such violation continues  in  addition
 to any civil penalties set forth above.

  1. Any duly authorized enforcement agency of the state or of a  subdi-
 vision  thereof, under a duty to enforce the provisions of the penal law
 or of any state or local law, ordinance, code, rule or regulation relat-
 ing to buildings, or the cannabis  control  board,  office  of  cannabis
 management or the attorney general pursuant to section one hundred thir-
 ty-eight-a  of  the cannabis law, may serve personally upon the owner or
 landlord of real property authorized or  otherwise  intended  or  adver-
 tised, in whole or part, for use to buy, sell or otherwise provide goods

 manufacturing  activities, or upon their agent, a written notice requir-
 ing the owner or landlord to make an application for the  removal  of  a
 commercial  tenant  so  using  or  occupying the same for a violation of
 article two hundred twenty-two of the penal law or article  six  of  the
 cannabis  law  involving  the  unlicensed  sale  of cannabis OR PRODUCTS
 MARKETED AS SUCH, where such property, or the portion thereof being used
 for such unlicensed activity, is not occupied for any other licensed  or
 lawful  purpose.  If  the owner or landlord or their agent does not make
 such application within five days thereafter; or, having made  it,  does
 not in good faith diligently prosecute it, the enforcement agency giving
 the notice may bring a proceeding under this article for such removal as
 though  the  petitioner  were the owner or landlord of the premises, and
 shall have precedence over any similar proceeding thereafter brought  by
 such  owner  or  landlord  or to one theretofore brought by them and not

 ized  to bring a petition hereunder may do so on their own initiative or
 upon a referral from an agency of the state or  a  subdivision  thereof.

 proceeding.

 ING hours of any place of business, including a vehicle  used  for  such

 "place  of business" shall not include a residence or other real proper-
 ty, or any personal vehicle on or about such property, not held  out  as
 open  to the public or otherwise being utilized in a business or commer-
 cial manner, unless probable cause exists to  believe  that  such  resi-
 dence,  real  property  or  vehicle  is being used in such a business or
 commercial manner for  the  buying  or  selling  of  adult-use  cannabis
 products.
  §  15.  This  act  shall  take  effect  immediately and shall apply to
 offenses committed on or after the date this act  shall  have  become  a
 law; provided, however that the amendments to section 16-a of the canna-
 bis  law made by section four of this act shall not affect the repeal of
 such section and shall be deemed repealed therewith.

  2. (a) The weekly benefit for family leave that occurs (i) on or after
 January first, two thousand eighteen shall not exceed eight weeks during
 any  fifty-two  week  calendar  period and shall be fifty percent of the
 employee's average weekly wage but shall not exceed fifty percent of the
 state  average weekly wage, (ii) on or after January first, two thousand
 nineteen shall not exceed ten weeks during any fifty-two  week  calendar
 period  and shall be fifty-five percent of the employee's average weekly
 wage but shall not exceed fifty-five percent of the state average weekly

 The superintendent of financial services shall have discretion to  delay
 the  increases  in  the  family leave benefit level provided in subpara-
 graphs (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this paragraph by one or  more  calendar
 years.  In determining whether to delay the increase in the family leave
 benefit for any year, the superintendent  of  financial  services  shall
 consider:  (1) the current cost to employees of the family leave benefit
 and any expected change in the cost after the benefit increase; (2)  the
 current  number  of  insurers  issuing  insurance policies with a family
 leave benefit and any expected change in the number of insurers  issuing
 such  policies after the benefit increase; (3) the impact of the benefit
 increase on employers' business and the overall stability of the program
 to the extent that information is readily available; (4) the  impact  of
 the  benefit  increase  on the financial stability of the disability and
 family leave insurance market  and  carriers;  and  (5)  any  additional
 factors that the superintendent of financial services deems relevant. If
 the  superintendent  of  financial  services  delays the increase in the
 family leave benefit level for one or more calendar  years,  the  family
 leave  benefit  level  that  shall take effect immediately following the
 delay shall be the same benefit level that would have taken  effect  but
 for  the  delay.  The weekly benefits for family leave that occurs on or
 after January first, two thousand eighteen shall not be  less  than  one
 hundred dollars per week except that if the employee's wages at the time
 of family leave are less than one hundred dollars per week, the employee
 shall  receive  [his  or her] THE EMPLOYEE'S full wages. Benefits may be
 payable to employees for paid family leave taken intermittently  or  for
 less than a full work week in increments of one full day or one fifth of
 the weekly benefit.

 WEEKLY  WAGE. The weekly benefit which the disabled employee is entitled
 to receive for disability commencing on or  after  May  first,  nineteen
 hundred  eighty-nine AND PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX
 shall be one-half of the employee's weekly wage, but in  no  case  shall
 such  benefit  exceed  one  hundred  seventy dollars; except that if the
 employee's average weekly wage is less than twenty dollars, the  benefit

 less than twenty dollars, the benefit shall be such average weekly wage.
 The weekly benefit which the disabled employee is  entitled  to  receive

 seventy and prior to July first, nineteen hundred seventy-four shall  be
 one-half  of  the  employee's  average weekly wage, but in no case shall
 such benefit  exceed  seventy-five  dollars  nor  be  less  than  twenty
 dollars;  except that if the employee's average weekly wage is less than
 twenty dollars the benefit shall be such average weekly  wage.  For  any
 period  of  disability less than a full week, the benefits payable shall
 be calculated by dividing the  weekly  benefit  by  the  number  of  the
 employee's normal work days per week and multiplying the quotient by the
 number  of  normal  work  days  in such period of disability. The weekly
 benefit for a disabled employee who is concurrently eligible  for  bene-
 fits  in  the employment of more than one covered employer shall, within
 the maximum and minimum herein provided, be one-half of the total of the
 employee's average weekly wages received from all such  covered  employ-

 county. The chief executive officer of each town, city and village shall
 be the representative to a panel and shall be the mayor, if a city or  a
 village,  or  shall  be  the supervisor, if a town. The county CEO shall
 serve as chair. [All panels established in each county pursuant to  part
 BBB  of  chapter  fifty-nine  of the laws of two thousand seventeen, and
 prior to the enactment of this article, shall continue  in  satisfaction
 of this section in such form as they were established, provided that the
 county  CEO  may alter the membership of the panel consistent with para-
 graph b of this subdivision.]
  b. The county CEO may invite any school district, board of cooperative
 educational  services,  fire  district,  fire  protection  district,  or
 special  improvement  district  in the county to join a panel. Upon such
 invitation, the governing body of such school district, board of cooper-
 ative educational services, fire district, fire protection district,  or
 other  special district may accept such invitation by selecting a repre-
 sentative of such governing body, by majority vote, to serve as a member
 S. 8305--B  48
 
 of the panel. [Such school district, board  of  cooperative  educational
 services,  fire  district,  fire  protection  district  or other special
 district shall maintain  such  representation  until  the  panel  either
 approves  a  plan  or transmits a statement to the secretary of state on
 the reason the panel did not approve a plan, pursuant to paragraph d  of
 subdivision  seven  of this section. Upon approval of a plan or a trans-
 mission of a statement to the secretary of state that a  panel  did  not
 approve  a  plan in any calendar year, the county CEO may, but need not,
 invite any school district, board of cooperative  educational  services,
 fire  district, fire protection district or special improvement district
 in the county to join a panel thereafter convened.]
  3. [a.] Each county CEO [shall, after satisfying the  requirements  of
 part  BBB  of  chapter fifty-nine of the laws of two thousand seventeen,
 annually] MAY convene the panel and  [shall]  undertake  to  revise  and
 update  a  previously  approved plan or alternatively develop a new plan
 [through December thirty-first, two  thousand  twenty-one].  Such  plans
 shall contain new, recurring property tax savings resulting from actions
 such  as,  but  not limited to, the elimination of duplicative services;
 shared services arrangements including, joint purchasing, shared highway
 equipment, shared storage facilities, shared plowing services and energy
 and insurance purchasing cooperatives; reducing back office and adminis-
 trative overhead; and better coordinating  services.  The  secretary  of
 state  may  provide advice and/or recommendations on the form and struc-
 ture of such plans.
  [b. After having convened at least two meetings in a calendar year,  a
 panel may, by majority vote, determine that it is not in the best inter-
 est  of the taxpayers to revise and update a previously approved plan or
 to develop a new plan in such year. The county CEO of such  panel  shall
 then comply with the provisions of paragraph (d) of subdivision seven of
 this section.
  4.  While  revising  or  updating a previously approved plan, or while
 developing a new plan, the county CEO shall regularly consult with,  and
 take  recommendations  from,  the representatives: on the panel; of each
 collective bargaining unit of the county  and  the  cities,  towns,  and
 villages;  and  of  each collective bargaining unit of any participating
 school  district,  board  of  cooperative  educational  services,  fire
 district, fire protection district, or special improvement district.
  5.  The  county  CEO,  the  county  legislative body and a panel shall
 accept input from the public, civic, business, labor and community lead-
 ers on any proposed plan. The county CEO shall cause to be  conducted  a
 minimum of three public hearings prior to submission of a plan to a vote
 of a panel. All such public hearings shall be conducted within the coun-
 ty,  and  public  notice of all such hearings shall be provided at least
 one week prior in the manner prescribed in subdivision  one  of  section
 one hundred four of the public officers law. Civic, business, labor, and
 community  leaders, as well as members of the public, shall be permitted
 to provide public testimony at any such hearings.
  6. a. The county CEO shall submit each plan, accompanied by a  certif-
 ication  as  to  the  accuracy  of the savings contained therein, to the
 county legislative body at least forty-five days prior to a vote by  the
 panel.
  b.  The  county  legislative  body shall review and consider each plan
 submitted in accordance with paragraph a of this subdivision. A majority
 of the members of such body may issue an advisory report on  each  plan,
 making  recommendations as deemed necessary. The county CEO may modify a
 S. 8305--B  49

 plan based on such  recommendations,  which  shall  include  an  updated
 certification as to the accuracy of the savings contained therein.
  7.  a.  A panel shall duly consider any plan properly submitted to the
 panel by the county CEO and may approve such plan by a majority vote  of
 the  panel.  Each  member  of a panel may, prior to the panel-wide vote,
 cause to be removed from a plan any proposed action affecting  the  unit
 of  government  represented  by the respective member. Written notice of
 such removal shall be provided to the county CEO prior to  a  panel-wide
 vote on a plan.
  b.  Plans approved by a panel shall be transmitted to the secretary of
 state no later than thirty days from the date of  approval  by  a  panel
 accompanied  by a certification as to the accuracy of the savings accom-
 panied therein, and shall be publicly disseminated to residents  of  the
 county  in a concise, clear, and coherent manner using words with common
 and everyday meaning.
  c. The county CEO shall conduct a public presentation of any  approved
 plan  no  later  than  thirty days from the date of approval by a panel.
 Public notice of such presentation shall be provided at least  one  week
 prior in the manner prescribed in subdivision one of section one hundred
 four of the public officers law.
  d.  Beginning  in  two thousand twenty, by January fifteenth following
 any calendar year during which a panel did not approve a plan and trans-
 mit such plan to the secretary of state pursuant to paragraph b of  this
 subdivision,  the  county  CEO of such panel shall release to the public
 and transmit to the secretary of state a statement  explaining  why  the
 panel  did  not  approve a plan that year, including, for each vote on a
 plan, the vote taken by each panel member and  an  explanation  by  each
 panel member of their vote.
  8.  For  each  county,  new shared services actions in an approved and
 submitted plan pursuant to this section or part BBB  of  chapter  fifty-
 nine  of the laws of two thousand seventeen, may be eligible for funding
 to match savings from such action, subject to  available  appropriation.
 Savings that are actually and demonstrably realized by the participating
 local  governments  are eligible for matching funding.  For actions that
 are part of an approved plan transmitted to the secretary  of  state  in
 accordance  with  paragraph  b  of  subdivision  seven  of this section,
 savings achieved during either: (i) January first through December thir-
 ty-first from new actions implemented on or after January first  through
 December  thirty-first of the year immediately following an approved and
 transmitted plan, or (ii) July first of the year  immediately  following
 an  approved  and  transmitted plan through June thirtieth of the subse-
 quent year from new actions implemented July first  of  the  year  imme-
 diately  following an approved plan through June thirtieth of the subse-
 quent year may be eligible for  matching  funding.  Only  net  savings
 between local governments for each action would be eligible for matching
 funding. Savings from internal efficiencies or any other action taken by
 a local government without the participation of another local government
 are  not eligible for matching funding. Each county and all of the local
 governments within the county that are part of any action to  be  imple-
 mented  as  part  of  an  approved  plan must collectively apply for the
 matching funding and agree on the distribution and use of  any  matching
 funding in order to qualify for matching funding.
  9.] 4. The department of state shall prepare a report to the governor,
 the temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assembly on

 services  panels  created  pursuant to part BBB of chapter fifty-nine of
 S. 8305--B  50
 
 the laws of two thousand seventeen and this article and shall  post  the

 related to the operations  of  local  governments  and  shared  services
 initiatives,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  making recommendations
 regarding grant proposals incorporating  elements  of  shared  services,
 government dissolutions, government and service consolidations, or prop-
 erty  taxes and such other grants where the secretary deems the input of
 the panels to be in the best interest of the  public.  The  panel  shall
 advance  such advice or recommendations by a vote of the majority of the
 members present at such meeting.

 panel for the purpose of revising  or  updating  a  previously  approved
 plan,  or  developing  a  new plan, or to provide the secretary of state
 information pursuant to subdivision ten of this section, shall cease  on
 December thirty-first, two thousand twenty-four.
  12.]  5.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law to the contrary,
 monies constituting the funds of the  village  incorporation  commission
 established  pursuant  to section [2-259] 2-260 of the village law shall

  1.  The  dormitory  authority  is  authorized  to  issue bonds, at the
 request of the commissioner of education, to  finance  eligible  library

 exceed a total principal amount of [three  hundred  sixty-seven  million

  § 33. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 19 of section 1680  of  the  public
 authorities  law,  as  amended by section 31 of part PP of chapter 56 of
 the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  (c) Subject to the provisions of chapter fifty-nine of the laws of two
 thousand, the dormitory authority shall not issue any  bonds  for  state
 university  educational  facilities  purposes if the principal amount of
 bonds to be issued when added to the aggregate principal amount of bonds
 issued by the dormitory authority on  and  after  July  first,  nineteen

 exceed [eighteen billion one hundred ten million nine hundred sixty-four
 thousand dollars $18,110,964,000] NINETEEN BILLION SIX  HUNDRED  MILLION
 DOLLARS  $19,600,000,000;  provided, however, that bonds issued or to be
 issued shall be excluded from such limitation if:  (1)  such  bonds  are
 issued to refund state university construction bonds and state universi-
 ty  construction  notes previously issued by the housing finance agency;
 or (2) such bonds are issued to refund bonds of the authority  or  other
 obligations  issued for state university educational facilities purposes

 obligations  issued between April first, nineteen hundred ninety-two and
 March thirty-first, nineteen hundred  ninety-three  will  generate  long
 term  economic  benefits  to  the  state, as assessed on a present value
 basis, such issuance will be deemed to have met the present  value  test
 noted  above. For purposes of this subdivision, the present value of the
 aggregate debt service of the refunding bonds  and  the  aggregate  debt
 service of the bonds refunded, shall be calculated by utilizing the true
 interest  cost  of the refunding bonds, which shall be that rate arrived
 at by doubling the semi-annual interest rate (compounded  semi-annually)
 necessary  to  discount the debt service payments on the refunding bonds
 from the payment dates thereof to the date of  issue  of  the  refunding
 bonds  to  the purchase price of the refunding bonds, including interest
 accrued thereon prior to the issuance  thereof.  The  maturity  of  such
 bonds,  other  than  bonds issued to refund outstanding bonds, shall not
 exceed the weighted average economic life, as  certified  by  the  state
 university construction fund, of the facilities in connection with which
 the  bonds  are  issued,  and  in any case not later than the earlier of
 thirty years or the expiration of the term of  any  lease,  sublease  or
 other  agreement  relating  thereto;  provided  that  no note, including
 renewals thereof, shall mature later than five years after the  date  of

 repeal such limit, and the state of New York, the  dormitory  authority,
 the  state university of New York, and the state university construction
 fund are prohibited from covenanting or making any other agreements with
 S. 8305--B  74

 right.

  PART AA
 S. 8305--B  93
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent.  As the official record of
 all eligible voters in a state, a state's voter registration  rolls  are
 the  foundation of free, fair, and accurate elections. Illegal voting is
 exceedingly rare but maintaining accurate voter rolls reduces the oppor-
 tunity  for  such  behavior  and  it  helps build confidence in election
 outcomes. However, keeping  voter  rolls  up  to  date  is  a  challenge
 because, every day, voters move or die. Voters do not always remember to
 update their registration when they move. These challenges are especial-
 ly  acute  in  states  with large and highly mobile populations. Partic-
 ipation in a multistate voter list maintenance organization can  improve
 the  accuracy of New York's voter registration rolls. A multistate voter
 list maintenance organization is a coordinating  entity  between  states
 that  aids  them  in identifying voters who may no longer be eligible to
 vote, who have moved, or who have died. A voter list maintenance  organ-
 ization  may  also  offer  other  information  useful to improving voter
 registration or enhancing the integrity of election administration.

  PART BB
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York privacy act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  1.  Privacy is a fundamental right and an
 essential element of freedom. Advances in technology have produced ramp-
 ant growth in the amount and categories of personal  data  being  gener-
 ated,  collected,  stored,  analyzed,  and  potentially  shared,  which
 presents both promise and peril. Companies collect, use  and  share  our
 personal  data  in  ways that can be difficult for ordinary consumers to
 understand. Opaque data processing policies make it impossible to evalu-
 ate risks  and  compare  privacy-related  protections  across  services,
 stifling  competition.  Algorithms  quietly make decisions with critical
 S. 8305--B  95
 
 consequences for New York consumers, often with no human accountability.
 Behavioral advertising generates profits by turning people into products
 and their activity into assets. New York consumers deserve  more  notice
 and more control over their data and their digital privacy.
  2. This act seeks to help New York consumers regain their privacy.  It
 gives New York consumers the ability to exercise more control over their
 personal data and requires businesses to be responsible, thoughtful, and
 accountable  managers  of  that  information.  To achieve this, this act
 provides New York consumers a number  of  new  rights,  including  clear
 notice of how their data is being used, processed and shared; the abili-
 ty  to  access  and obtain a copy of their data in a commonly used elec-
 tronic format, with the ability to transfer  it  between  services;  the
 ability  to  correct inaccurate data and to delete their data.  This act
 also imposes obligations upon businesses  to  maintain  reasonable  data
 security  for personal data, to notify New York consumers of foreseeable
 harms arising from use of their data and to obtain specific consent  for
 that  use, and to conduct regular assessments to ensure that data is not
 being used for unacceptable purposes.  These  data  assessments  can  be
 obtained  and  evaluated  by the New York State Attorney General, who is
 empowered to obtain penalties for violations of  this  act  and  prevent
 future violations.
  § 3. The general business law is amended by adding a new article 42 to

 IN  FURTHERANCE OF DECISIONS THAT PRODUCE LEGAL OR SIMILARLY SIGNIFICANT
 EFFECTS CONCERNING THE CONSUMER AS AN OPT OUT UNDER THIS ARTICLE. TO THE
 EXTENT THAT THE PRIVACY CONTROL CONFLICTS WITH A CONSUMER'S CONSENT, THE
 CONTROLLER SHALL COMPLY WITH THE PRIVACY  CONTROL  BUT  MAY  NOTIFY  THE
 S. 8305--B  102
 
 CONSUMER  OF  SUCH  CONFLICT  AND PROVIDE TO SUCH CONSUMER THE CHOICE TO
 GIVE CONTROLLER SPECIFIC CONSENT TO SUCH PROCESSING.
  3.  SENSITIVE DATA. (A) A CONTROLLER MUST OBTAIN FREELY GIVEN, SPECIF-
 IC, INFORMED, AND UNAMBIGUOUS OPT-IN CONSENT FROM A CONSUMER TO:
  (I) PROCESS THE CONSUMER'S SENSITIVE DATA RELATED TO THAT CONSUMER FOR
 ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN  THOSE  IN  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  SECTION  ELEVEN
 HUNDRED FIVE OF THIS ARTICLE; OR
  (II)  MAKE  ANY  CHANGES  TO  THE  EXISTING  PROCESSING  OR PROCESSING
 PURPOSE, INCLUDING THOSE REGARDING THE METHOD AND SCOPE  OF  COLLECTION,
 OF  THE  CONSUMER'S  SENSITIVE  DATA  THAT MAY BE LESS PROTECTIVE OF THE
 CONSUMER'S SENSITIVE DATA THAN THE PROCESSING TO WHICH THE CONSUMER  HAS
 PREVIOUSLY GIVEN THEIR FREELY GIVEN, SPECIFIC, INFORMED, AND UNAMBIGUOUS
 OPT-IN CONSENT.
  (B) ANY REQUEST FOR CONSENT TO PROCESS SENSITIVE DATA MUST BE PROVIDED
 TO  THE  CONSUMER, PRIOR TO PROCESSING THEIR SENSITIVE DATA, IN A STAND-
 ALONE DISCLOSURE THAT IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM ANY CONTRACT OR PRIVACY
 POLICY. THE REQUEST FOR CONSENT MUST:
  (I) BE WRITTEN IN A TWELVE POINT FONT OR GREATER AND INCLUDE  A  CLEAR
 AND  CONSPICUOUS  DESCRIPTION  OF  EACH  CATEGORY OF DATA AND PROCESSING
 PURPOSE FOR WHICH CONSENT IS SOUGHT;
  (II) CLEARLY IDENTIFY AND DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF  DATA  AND
 PROCESSING  PURPOSES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS
 REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER AND CATEGORIES OF DATA AND PROCESSING PURPOSES
 THAT ARE NOT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS REQUESTED BY THE
 CONSUMER;
  (III) ENABLE A REASONABLE CONSUMER TO EASILY IDENTIFY  THE  CATEGORIES
 OF DATA AND PROCESSING PURPOSES FOR WHICH CONSENT IS SOUGHT;
  (IV)  CLEARLY  PRESENT  AS  THE  MOST  CONSPICUOUS CHOICE AN OPTION TO
 PROVIDE ONLY THE CONSENT NECESSARY TO  PROVIDE  THE  SERVICES  OR  GOODS
 REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER;
  (V) CLEARLY PRESENT AN OPTION TO DENY CONSENT; AND
  (VI) WHERE THE REQUEST SEEKS CONSENT TO SHARING, DISCLOSURE, TRANSFER,
 OR  SALE  OF SENSITIVE DATA TO THIRD PARTIES, IDENTIFY THE CATEGORIES OF
 SUCH THIRD PARTIES, THE CATEGORIES OF DATA SOLD OR SHARED WITH THEM, THE
 PROCESSING PURPOSES, THE RETENTION PERIOD, OR IF THAT IS  NOT  POSSIBLE,
 THE  CRITERIA  USED  TO DETERMINE THE PERIOD, AND STATE IF SUCH SHARING,
 DISCLOSURE, TRANSFER, OR SALE ENABLES OR INVOLVES TARGETED  ADVERTISING.
 THE  DETAILS OF THE CATEGORIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES, AND THE CATEGORIES
 OF DATA, PROCESSING PURPOSES, AND THE RETENTION PERIOD, MAY BE SET FORTH
 IN A  DIFFERENT  DISCLOSURE,  PROVIDED  THAT  THE  REQUEST  FOR  CONSENT
 CONTAINS A CONSPICUOUS AND DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE LINK TO THAT DISCLOSURE.
  (C)  TARGETED  ADVERTISING  AND  SALE  OF  PERSONAL  DATA SHALL NOT BE
 CONSIDERED PROCESSING PURPOSES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SERVICES OR
 GOODS REQUESTED BY A CONSUMER.
  (D) ONCE A CONSUMER HAS PROVIDED FREELY GIVEN, SPECIFIC, INFORMED, AND
 UNAMBIGUOUS OPT-IN CONSENT TO PROCESS THEIR SENSITIVE DATA FOR  A  PROC-
 ESSING  PURPOSE, A CONTROLLER MAY RELY ON SUCH CONSENT UNTIL IT IS WITH-
 DRAWN.
  (E) A CONTROLLER MUST PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR A CONSUMER  TO  WITHDRAW
 PREVIOUSLY  GIVEN  CONSENT  AT ANY TIME. SUCH MECHANISM SHALL MAKE IT AS
 EASY FOR A CONSUMER TO WITHDRAW THEIR CONSENT AS IT IS FOR SUCH CONSUMER
 TO PROVIDE CONSENT.
  (F) A CONTROLLER MUST NOT INFER THAT A CONSUMER  HAS  PROVIDED  FREELY
 GIVEN,  SPECIFIC,  INFORMED,  AND  UNAMBIGUOUS  OPT-IN  CONSENT FROM THE
 CONSUMER'S INACTION OR THE CONSUMER'S CONTINUED  USE  OF  A  SERVICE  OR
 PRODUCT PROVIDED BY THE CONTROLLER.
 S. 8305--B  103

  (G)  CONTROLLERS  MUST  NOT  REQUEST  CONSENT  FROM A CONSUMER WHO HAS
 PREVIOUSLY WITHHELD OR DENIED CONSENT TO PROCESS SENSITIVE  DATA,  UNTIL
 AT  LEAST  TWELVE  MONTHS AFTER A DENIAL, UNLESS CONSENT IS NECESSARY TO
 PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER.
  (H) CONTROLLERS MUST TREAT USER-ENABLED PRIVACY CONTROLLERS IN A BROW-
 SER,  BROWSER  PLUG-IN, SMARTPHONE APPLICATION, OPERATING SYSTEM, DEVICE
 SETTING, OR OTHER MECHANISM THAT COMMUNICATES OR SIGNALS THE  CONSUMER'S
 CHOICES  TO OPT OUT OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA IN FURTHERANCE OF
 TARGETED ADVERTISING, THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA, OR  PROFILING  IN
 FURTHERANCE  OF  DECISIONS  THAT  PRODUCE LEGAL OR SIMILARLY SIGNIFICANT
 EFFECTS CONCERNING THE CONSUMER AS A DENIAL OF CONSENT TO PROCESS SENSI-
 TIVE DATA UNDER THIS ARTICLE. TO THE EXTENT  THAT  THE  PRIVACY  CONTROL
 CONFLICTS  WITH  A  CONSUMER'S  CONSENT,  THE  PRIVACY  CONTROL SETTINGS
 GOVERN, UNLESS THE CONSUMER PROVIDES FREELY GIVEN,  SPECIFIC,  INFORMED,
 AND UNAMBIGUOUS OPT-IN CONSENT TO OVERRIDE THE PRIVACY CONTROL, HOWEVER,
 THE  CONTROLLER MAY NOTIFY SUCH CONSUMER OF SUCH CONFLICT AND PROVIDE TO
 THE  CONSUMER THE CHOICE TO GIVE  CONTROLLER-SPECIFIC  CONSENT  TO  SUCH
 PROCESSING.
  (I)  (I)  A  CONTROLLER  MUST  NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A CONSUMER FOR
 WITHHOLDING OR DENYING CONSENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BY:
  (A) DENYING SERVICES OR GOODS TO THE  CONSUMER,  UNLESS  THE  CONSUMER
 DOES  NOT  CONSENT  TO  PROCESSING  NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR
 GOODS REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER;
  (B) CHARGING DIFFERENT PRICES FOR GOODS OR SERVICES, INCLUDING THROUGH
 THE USE OF DISCOUNTS OR OTHER BENEFITS, IMPOSING PENALTIES, OR PROVIDING
 A DIFFERENT LEVEL OR QUALITY OF SERVICES OR GOODS TO THE CONSUMER; OR
  (C) SUGGESTING THAT THE CONSUMER WILL RECEIVE  A  DIFFERENT  PRICE  OR
 RATE  FOR  GOODS OR SERVICES OR A DIFFERENT LEVEL OR QUALITY OF SERVICES
 OR GOODS.
  (II) A CONTROLLER SHALL NOT BE PROHIBITED FROM  OFFERING  A  DIFFERENT
 PRICE,  RATE,  LEVEL,  QUALITY,  OR  SELECTION OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO A
 CONSUMER, INCLUDING OFFERING GOODS OR SERVICES FOR NO FEE, IF THE OFFER-
 ING IS IN CONNECTION WITH A CONSUMER'S VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION  IN  BONA
 FIDE  LOYALTY,  REWARDS,  PREMIUM  FEATURES,  DISCOUNTS,  OR  CLUB  CARD
 PROGRAM. IF A CONSUMER EXERCISES THEIR RIGHT PURSUANT TO  PARAGRAPH  (A)
 OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO OF THIS SECTION, A CONTROLLER MAY NOT SELL PERSONAL
 DATA TO A THIRD PARTY CONTROLLER AS PART OF SUCH A PROGRAM  UNLESS:  (A)
 THE  SALE IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE THIRD PARTY TO PROVIDE A
 BENEFIT TO WHICH THE CONSUMER IS ENTITLED; (B) THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA
 TO THIRD PARTIES IS CLEARLY DISCLOSED IN THE TERMS OF THE  PROGRAM;  AND
 (C)  THE THIRD PARTY USES THE PERSONAL DATA ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF FACILI-
 TATING SUCH A BENEFIT TO WHICH THE CONSUMER IS  ENTITLED  AND  DOES  NOT
 RETAIN  OR  OTHERWISE  USE  OR  DISCLOSE THE PERSONAL DATA FOR ANY OTHER
 PURPOSE.
  (J) A CONTROLLER MAY, WITH  THE  CONSUMER'S  FREELY  GIVEN,  SPECIFIC,
 INFORMED, AND UNAMBIGUOUS OPT-IN CONSENT GIVEN PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION,
 OPERATE  A  PROGRAM  IN WHICH INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES SOLD TO
 THE CONSUMER ARE  DISCOUNTED  BASED  SOLELY  ON  SUCH  CONSUMER'S  PRIOR
 PURCHASES  FROM THE CONTROLLER, PROVIDED THAT ANY SENSITIVE DATA USED TO
 OPERATE SUCH PROGRAM IS PROCESSED SOLELY FOR THE  PURPOSE  OF  OPERATING
 SUCH PROGRAM.
  (K) IN THE EVENT OF A MERGER, ACQUISITION, BANKRUPTCY, OR OTHER TRANS-
 ACTION  IN  WHICH  ANOTHER ENTITY ASSUMES CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP OF ALL OR
 MAJORITY OF  THE  CONTROLLER'S  ASSETS,  ANY  CONSENT  PROVIDED  TO  THE
 CONTROLLER BY A CONSUMER RELATING TO SENSITIVE DATA PRIOR TO SUCH TRANS-
 S. 8305--B  104
 
 ACTION OTHER THAN CONSENT TO PROCESSING NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SERVICES OR
 GOODS REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER, SHALL BE DEEMED WITHDRAWN.

 CONTROLLER SHALL:
  (A) CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THE CONTROLLER IS PROCESSING OR  HAS  PROC-

 ANY SUCH PERSONAL DATA  IN  A  MANNER  UNDERSTANDABLE  TO  A  REASONABLE
 CONSUMER WHEN REQUESTED; AND
  (B)  PROVIDE THE CATEGORY OF EACH PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY TO WHOM THE
 CONTROLLER DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD THE CONSUMER'S PERSONAL  DATA
 AND,  FOR  EACH CATEGORY OF PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY, (I) THE CATEGORIES

 PROCESSOR  OR  THIRD PARTY AND (II) THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH EACH CATEGORY
 OF THE CONSUMER'S PERSONAL DATA WAS DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR  SOLD  TO
 EACH PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY.
  5. RIGHT TO PORTABLE DATA.  UPON A VERIFIED REQUEST, AND TO THE EXTENT
 TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE, THE CONTROLLER MUST: (A) PROVIDE TO THE CONSUMER A
 COPY  OF  ALL  OF, OR A PORTION OF, AS DESIGNATED IN A VERIFIED REQUEST,
 THE  CONSUMER'S  PERSONAL  DATA  IN  A  STRUCTURED,  COMMONLY  USED  AND
 MACHINE-READABLE  FORMAT  AND (B) TRANSMIT THE DATA TO ANOTHER PERSON OF
 THE CONSUMER'S OR THEIR AGENT'S DESIGNATION WITHOUT HINDRANCE.
  6. RIGHT TO CORRECT. (A) UPON THE VERIFIED REQUEST OF  A  CONSUMER  OR
 THEIR  AGENT,  A  CONTROLLER  MUST CONDUCT A REASONABLE INVESTIGATION TO
 DETERMINE WHETHER PERSONAL DATA, THE ACCURACY OF WHICH  IS  DISPUTED  BY
 THE  CONSUMER,  IS  INACCURATE,  WITH SUCH INVESTIGATION TO BE CONCLUDED
 WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF  SUBDIVISION  EIGHT
 OF THIS SECTION.
  (B)  NOTWITHSTANDING  PARAGRAPH  (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, A CONTROLLER
 MAY TERMINATE AN INVESTIGATION INITIATED PURSUANT TO SUCH  PARAGRAPH  IF
 THE  CONTROLLER REASONABLY AND IN GOOD FAITH DETERMINES THAT THE DISPUTE
 BY THE CONSUMER IS WHOLLY WITHOUT MERIT, INCLUDING BY REASON OF A  FAIL-
 URE  BY  A CONSUMER TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO INVESTIGATE THE
 DISPUTED PERSONAL DATA. UPON MAKING ANY DETERMINATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THIS PARAGRAPH THAT A DISPUTE IS  WHOLLY  WITHOUT  MERIT,  A  CONTROLLER
 MUST,  WITHIN  THE TIME PERIOD SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION
 EIGHT OF THIS SECTION, PROVIDE THE  AFFECTED  CONSUMER  A  STATEMENT  IN
 WRITING THAT INCLUDES, AT A MINIMUM, THE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR THE DETER-
 MINATION,  AND IDENTIFICATION OF ANY INFORMATION REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE
 THE DISPUTED PERSONAL DATA, WHICH MAY CONSIST  OF  A  STANDARDIZED  FORM
 DESCRIBING THE GENERAL NATURE OF SUCH INFORMATION.
  (C)  IF,  AFTER ANY INVESTIGATION UNDER PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION OF ANY PERSONAL DATA  DISPUTED  BY  A  CONSUMER,  AN  ITEM  OF  THE
 PERSONAL  DATA  IS  FOUND  TO  BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE, OR CANNOT BE
 VERIFIED, THE CONTROLLER MUST:
  (I) CORRECT THE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE PERSONAL DATA OF THE  CONSUM-
 ER; AND
  (II)  UNLESS IT PROVES IMPOSSIBLE OR INVOLVES DISPROPORTIONATE EFFORT,
 COMMUNICATE SUCH REQUEST TO EACH PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY  TO  WHOM  THE
 CONTROLLER  DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA WITHIN ONE
 YEAR PRECEDING THE CONSUMER'S REQUEST, AND TO REQUIRE  THOSE  PROCESSORS
 OR  THIRD  PARTIES  TO  DO  THE SAME FOR ANY FURTHER PROCESSORS OR THIRD
 PARTIES THEY DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA TO.
  (D) IF THE INVESTIGATION DOES NOT RESOLVE THE  DISPUTE,  THE  CONSUMER
 MAY  FILE WITH THE CONTROLLER A BRIEF STATEMENT SETTING FORTH THE NATURE
 OF THE DISPUTE. WHENEVER A STATEMENT OF A DISPUTE IS FILED, UNLESS THERE
 EXISTS REASONABLE GROUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS  WHOLLY  WITHOUT  MERIT,
 S. 8305--B  105
 
 THE CONTROLLER MUST NOTE THAT IT IS DISPUTED BY THE CONSUMER AND INCLUDE
 EITHER  THE CONSUMER'S STATEMENT OR A CLEAR AND ACCURATE CODIFICATION OR
 SUMMARY  THEREOF  WITH  THE  DISPUTED  PERSONAL  DATA  WHENEVER  IT  IS
 DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD TO ANY PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY.
  7.  RIGHT  TO  DELETE.  (A) UPON THE VERIFIED REQUEST OF A CONSUMER, A
 CONTROLLER MUST:
  (I) WITHIN FORTY-FIVE  DAYS  AFTER  RECEIVING  THE  VERIFIED  REQUEST,
 DELETE  ANY  OR  ALL OF THE CONSUMER'S PERSONAL DATA, AS DIRECTED BY THE
 CONSUMER OR THEIR AGENT,  THAT THE CONTROLLER POSSESSES OR CONTROLS; AND
  (II) UNLESS IT PROVES IMPOSSIBLE OR INVOLVES  DISPROPORTIONATE  EFFORT
 THAT  IS  DOCUMENTED  IN  WRITING  BY  THE  CONTROLLER, COMMUNICATE SUCH
 REQUEST TO  EACH  PROCESSOR  OR  THIRD  PARTY  TO  WHOM  THE  CONTROLLER
 DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA WITHIN ONE YEAR PRECED-
 ING  THE  CONSUMER'S  REQUEST  AND  TO REQUIRE THOSE PROCESSORS OR THIRD
 PARTIES TO DO THE SAME FOR ANY FURTHER PROCESSORS OR THIRD PARTIES  THEY
 DISCLOSED, TRANSFERRED, OR SOLD THE PERSONAL DATA TO.
  (B) FOR PERSONAL DATA THAT IS NOT POSSESSED BY THE CONTROLLER BUT BY A
 PROCESSOR  OF  THE CONTROLLER, THE CONTROLLER MAY CHOOSE TO (I) COMMUNI-
 CATE THE CONSUMER'S REQUEST FOR  DELETION  TO  THE  PROCESSOR,  OR  (II)
 REQUEST  THAT  THE  PROCESSOR RETURN TO THE CONTROLLER THE PERSONAL DATA
 THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CONSUMER'S REQUEST AND DELETE  SUCH  PERSONAL
 DATA UPON RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST.
  (C) A CONSUMER'S DELETION OF THEIR ONLINE ACCOUNT MUST BE TREATED AS A
 REQUEST TO THE CONTROLLER TO DELETE ALL OF THAT CONSUMER'S PERSONAL DATA
 DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT ACCOUNT.
  (D)  A  CONTROLLER  MUST  MAINTAIN  REASONABLE  PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO
 PREVENT THE REAPPEARANCE IN ITS SYSTEMS, AND IN ANY DATA  IT  DISCLOSES,
 TRANSFERS,  OR  SELLS TO ANY PROCESSOR OR THIRD PARTY, THE PERSONAL DATA
 THAT IS DELETED PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (E) A CONTROLLER IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A  CONSUMER'S  REQUEST
 TO DELETE PERSONAL DATA IF:
  (I)  COMPLYING  WITH  THE  REQUEST  WOULD  PREVENT THE CONTROLLER FROM
 PERFORMING ACCOUNTING  FUNCTIONS,  PROCESSING  REFUNDS,  EFFECTUATING  A
 PRODUCT  RECALL PURSUANT TO FEDERAL OR STATE LAW, OR FULFILLING WARRANTY
 CLAIMS, PROVIDED THAT THE PERSONAL DATA  THAT  IS  THE  SUBJECT  OF  THE
 REQUEST IS NOT PROCESSED FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN SUCH SPECIFIC ACTIV-
 ITIES; OR
  (II)  IT  IS  NECESSARY  FOR THE CONTROLLER TO MAINTAIN THE CONSUMER'S
 PERSONAL DATA TO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC OR PEER-REVIEWED  SCIENTIFIC,  HISTOR-
 ICAL, OR STATISTICAL RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT ADHERES TO ALL
 OTHER APPLICABLE ETHICS AND PRIVACY LAWS, WHEN THE CONTROLLER'S DELETION
 OF  THE  INFORMATION  IS LIKELY TO RENDER IMPOSSIBLE OR SERIOUSLY IMPAIR
 THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCH RESEARCH, PROVIDED THAT THE CONSUMER  HAS  GIVEN
 INFORMED  CONSENT AND THE PERSONAL DATA IS NOT PROCESSED FOR ANY PURPOSE
 OTHER THAN SUCH RESEARCH.
  (F) WHERE A CONSUMER'S REQUEST FOR DELETION IS DENIED, THE  CONTROLLER
 SHALL PROVIDE THE CONSUMER WITH A WRITTEN JUSTIFICATION FOR SUCH DENIAL.
  8.  RESPONDING  TO REQUESTS. (A) A CONTROLLER MUST TAKE ACTION UNDER
 SUBDIVISIONS FOUR THROUGH SEVEN OF THIS SECTION AND INFORM THE  CONSUMER
 OF  ANY ACTIONS TAKEN WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY AND IN ANY EVENT WITHIN FORTY-
 FIVE DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST. THAT PERIOD MAY BE EXTENDED ONCE BY
 FORTY-FIVE ADDITIONAL  DAYS  WHERE  REASONABLY  NECESSARY,  TAKING  INTO
 ACCOUNT  THE  COMPLEXITY AND NUMBER OF THE REQUESTS. THE CONTROLLER MUST
 INFORM THE CONSUMER OF ANY SUCH  EXTENSION  WITHIN  FORTY-FIVE  DAYS  OF
 RECEIPT  OF THE REQUEST, TOGETHER WITH THE REASONS FOR THE DELAY. WHEN A
 CONTROLLER DENIES ANY SUCH REQUEST, IT MUST WITHIN THIS PERIOD  DISCLOSE
 S. 8305--B  106

 TO  THE  CONSUMER A STATEMENT IN WRITING OF THE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR THE
 DENIAL AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO APPEAL THE DECISION.
  (B) A CONTROLLER SHALL PERMIT THE EXERCISE OF RIGHTS AND CARRY OUT ITS
 OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISIONS FOUR THROUGH SEVEN OF THIS SECTION
 FREE  OF CHARGE, AT LEAST TWICE ANNUALLY TO THE CONSUMER. WHERE REQUESTS
 FROM A CONSUMER ARE MANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED  OR  EXCESSIVE,  IN  PARTICULAR
 BECAUSE  OF  THEIR  REPETITIVE  CHARACTER, THE CONTROLLER MAY EITHER (I)
 CHARGE A REASONABLE FEE TO COVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS  OF  COMPLYING
 WITH  THE  REQUEST  OR  (II) REFUSE TO ACT ON THE REQUEST AND NOTIFY THE
 CONSUMER OF THE REASON FOR REFUSING THE REQUEST.  THE  CONTROLLER  BEARS
 THE  BURDEN OF DEMONSTRATING THE MANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED OR EXCESSIVE CHAR-
 ACTER OF THE REQUEST.
  (C) (I)  A  CONTROLLER  SHALL  PROMPTLY  ATTEMPT,  USING  COMMERCIALLY
 REASONABLE  EFFORTS,  TO VERIFY THAT ALL REQUESTS TO EXERCISE ANY RIGHTS
 SET FORTH IN ANY SECTION OF THIS ARTICLE REQUIRING  A  VERIFIED  REQUEST
 WERE MADE BY THE CONSUMER WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THE DATA, OR BY A PERSON
 LAWFULLY  EXERCISING  THE  RIGHT  ON  BEHALF  OF THE CONSUMER WHO IS THE
 SUBJECT OF THE DATA. COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS SHALL BE DETERMINED
 BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE NATURE OF  THE
 DATA IMPLICATED BY THE REQUEST.
  (II)  A  CONTROLLER  MAY  REQUIRE  THE  CONSUMER TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION ONLY IF THE REQUEST CANNOT REASONABLY  BE  VERIFIED  WITHOUT
 THE  PROVISION  OF  SUCH  ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION. A CONTROLLER MUST NOT
 TRANSFER OR PROCESS ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED PURSUANT TO
 THIS SECTION FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE AND MUST DELETE ANY  SUCH  ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION  WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY AND IN ANY EVENT WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS
 AFTER THE CONTROLLER HAS NOTIFIED THE CONSUMER THAT IT HAS TAKEN  ACTION
 ON  A  REQUEST  UNDER SUBDIVISIONS FOUR THROUGH SEVEN OF THIS SECTION AS
 DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (III) IF A CONTROLLER DISCLOSES THIS  ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION  TO  ANY
 PROCESSOR  OR  THIRD  PARTY  FOR  THE  PURPOSE  OF  VERIFYING A CONSUMER
 REQUEST, IT MUST NOTIFY THE RECEIVING PROCESSOR OR THIRD  PARTY  AT  THE
 TIME  OF  SUCH  DISCLOSURE,  OR AS CLOSE IN TIME TO THE DISCLOSURE AS IS
 REASONABLY PRACTICABLE,  THAT  SUCH  INFORMATION  WAS  PROVIDED  BY  THE
 CONSUMER  FOR  THE  SOLE PURPOSE OF VERIFICATION AND CANNOT BE PROCESSED
 FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN VERIFICATION.
  9. IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS. CONTROLLERS MUST PROVIDE EASILY  ACCESSI-
 BLE  AND  CONVENIENT  MEANS FOR CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER
 THIS ARTICLE.
  10. NON-WAIVER OF RIGHTS. ANY PROVISION OF A CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT  OF
 ANY  KIND THAT PURPORTS TO WAIVE OR LIMIT IN ANY WAY A CONSUMER'S RIGHTS
 UNDER THIS ARTICLE IS CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND IS  VOID  AND  UNEN-
 FORCEABLE.
  §  1103.  CONTROLLER, PROCESSOR, AND THIRD PARTY RESPONSIBILITIES. 1.
 CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES. (A)  DATA  PROTECTION  ASSESSMENTS.  (I)  A
 CONTROLLER  SHALL  REGULARLY  CONDUCT  AND  DOCUMENT  A  DATA PROTECTION

 THIS SECTION, PROCESSING THAT PRESENTS A HEIGHTENED RISK OF  HARM  TO  A
 CONSUMER  INCLUDES: (A) THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES
 OF TARGETING ADVERTISING, (B) THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA, (C)  THE  PROC-
 ESSING  OF  PERSONAL  DATA  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF PROFILING, WHERE SUCH
 PROFILING PRESENTS A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RISK OF (I) UNFAIR OR DECEP-
 TIVE TREATMENT OF, OR  UNLAWFUL  DISPARATE  IMPACT  ON  CONSUMERS,  (II)
 FINANCIAL,  PHYSICAL  OR REPUTATIONAL INJURY TO CONSUMERS, (III) A PHYS-
 ICAL OR OTHER INTRUSION UPON THE SOLITUDE OR SECLUSION, OR  THE  PRIVATE
 S. 8305--B  107
 
 AFFAIRS OR CONCERNS OF CONSUMERS WHERE SUCH INTRUSION WOULD BE OFFENSIVE
 TO  A  REASONABLE PERSON, OR (IV) OTHER SUBSTANTIAL INJURY TO CONSUMERS;
 AND (D) THE PROCESSING OF SENSITIVE DATA.
  (II)  DATA  PROTECTION  ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH
 (I) OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL IDENTIFY AND WEIGH  THE  BENEFITS  THAT  MAY
 FLOW,  DIRECTLY  AND  INDIRECTLY, FROM THE PROCESSING TO THE CONTROLLER,
 THE CONSUMER, OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC  AGAINST  THE  POTENTIAL
 RISKS  TO THE RIGHTS OF THE CONSUMER ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH PROCESSING, AS
 MITIGATED BY SAFEGUARDS THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED BY THE CONTROLLER TO REDUCE
 SUCH RISKS. THE CONTROLLER SHALL FACTOR INTO ANY  SUCH  DATA  PROTECTION
 ASSESSMENT THAT USE OF DEIDENTIFIED DATA AND THE REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS
 OF CONSUMERS, AS WELL AS THE CONTEXT OF THE PROCESSING AND THE RELATION-
 SHIP BETWEEN THE CONTROLLER AND THE CONSUMER WHOSE PERSONAL DATA WILL BE
 PROCESSED.
  (III)  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY REQUIRE THAT A CONTROLLER DISCLOSE ANY
 DATA  PROTECTION  ASSESSMENT  THAT  IS  RELEVANT  TO  AN  INVESTIGATION
 CONDUCTED  BY  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL, AND THE CONTROLLER SHALL MAKE THE
 DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT AVAILABLE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE ATTOR-
 NEY GENERAL MAY  EVALUATE  THE  DATA  PROTECTION  ASSESSMENT  TO  ASSESS
 COMPLIANCE  WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE. DATA PROTECTION ASSESS-
 MENTS SHALL BE CONFIDENTIAL AND SHALL BE EXEMPT  FROM  DISCLOSURE  UNDER
 THE  FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW. TO THE EXTENT ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED
 IN A DATA PROTECTION  ASSESSMENT  DISCLOSURE  TO  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL
 INCLUDES  INFORMATION SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE OR WORK PROD-
 UCT PROTECTION, SUCH DISCLOSURE SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A  WAIVER  OF  SUCH
 PRIVILEGE OR PROTECTION.
  (IV)  A SINGLE DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT MAY ADDRESS A COMPARABLE SET
 OF PROCESSING OPERATIONS THAT INCLUDE SIMILAR ACTIVITIES.
  (V) IF A CONTROLLER CONDUCTS A  DATA  PROTECTION  ASSESSMENT  FOR  THE
 PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH ANOTHER APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION, THE DATA
 PROTECTION ASSESSMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS ESTAB-
 LISHED  IN THIS SECTION IF SUCH DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT IS REASONABLY
 SIMILAR IN SCOPE AND EFFECT TO THE DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT THAT WOULD
 OTHERWISE BE CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.
  (VI) DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS SHALL APPLY TO PROCESSING
 ACTIVITIES CREATED OR GENERATED AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THIS  ARTI-
 CLE.
  (B)  CONTROLLERS MUST NOT ENGAGE IN UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE, OR ABUSIVE ACTS
 OR PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO OBTAINING CONSUMER CONSENT, THE  PROCESSING
 OF  PERSONAL  DATA,  AND  A CONSUMER'S EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS
 ARTICLE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION:
  (I) DESIGNING A USER INTERFACE WITH THE PURPOSE OR SUBSTANTIAL  EFFECT
 OF  DECEIVING CONSUMERS, OBSCURING CONSUMERS' RIGHTS UNDER THIS ARTICLE,
 OR SUBVERTING OR IMPAIRING USER AUTONOMY, DECISION-MAKING, OR CHOICE; OR
  (II) OBTAINING CONSENT IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO OVERPOWER A  CONSUMER'S
 RESISTANCE; FOR EXAMPLE, BY MAKING EXCESSIVE REQUESTS FOR CONSENT.
  (C) CONTROLLERS MUST DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, AND MAINTAIN REASONABLE SAFE-
 GUARDS  TO  PROTECT  THE  SECURITY, CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE
 PERSONAL DATA OF CONSUMERS INCLUDING ADOPTING REASONABLE ADMINISTRATIVE,
 TECHNICAL AND PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS APPROPRIATE TO THE VOLUME  AND  NATURE
 OF THE PERSONAL DATA AT ISSUE.
  (D) (I) A CONTROLLER SHALL LIMIT THE USE AND RETENTION OF A CONSUMER'S
 PERSONAL  DATA TO WHAT IS (A) NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS
 REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER, (B) NECESSARY FOR THE INTERNAL BUSINESS OPER-
 ATIONS OF THE CONTROLLER AND CONSISTENT WITH THE DISCLOSURES MADE TO THE
 S. 8305--B  108
 
 CONSUMER PURSUANT TO SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE, OR  (C)
 NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE CONTROLLER.
  (II)  AT LEAST ANNUALLY, A CONTROLLER SHALL REVIEW ITS RETENTION PRAC-
 TICES FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENSURING THAT IT  IS  MAINTAINING  THE  MINIMUM
 AMOUNT  OF  PERSONAL DATA AS IS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSI-
 NESS. A CONTROLLER MUST SECURELY DISPOSE OF ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT IS NO
 LONGER (A) NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS REQUESTED  BY  THE
 CONSUMER,  (B)  NECESSARY  FOR  THE  INTERNAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE
 CONTROLLER AND CONSISTENT WITH THE  DISCLOSURES  MADE  TO  THE  CONSUMER

 RATE  FOR  SERVICES OR GOODS OR A DIFFERENT LEVEL OR QUALITY OF SERVICES
 OR GOODS.
  (B) A CONTROLLER SHALL NOT BE PROHIBITED  FROM  OFFERING  A  DIFFERENT

 ING IS IN CONNECTION WITH A CONSUMER'S VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION  IN  BONA
 FIDE  LOYALTY,  REWARDS,  PREMIUM  FEATURES,  DISCOUNTS,  OR  CLUB  CARD
 PROGRAM. IF A CONSUMER EXERCISES THEIR RIGHT PURSUANT TO  PARAGRAPH  (A)
 OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  SECTION  ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE, A
 CONTROLLER MAY NOT SELL PERSONAL DATA TO A  THIRD  PARTY  CONTROLLER  AS
 PART  OF  SUCH A PROGRAM UNLESS: (I) THE SALE IS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO
 ENABLE THE THIRD PARTY TO PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO  WHICH  THE  CONSUMER  IS
 ENTITLED;  (II)  THE  SALE  OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTIES IS CLEARLY
 DISCLOSED IN THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM; AND (III) THE  THIRD  PARTY  USES
 THE  PERSONAL  DATA  ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF FACILITATING SUCH A BENEFIT TO

  (F)  AGREEMENTS  WITH  PROCESSORS.  (I)  BEFORE MAKING ANY DISCLOSURE,
 TRANSFER, OR SALE OF PERSONAL DATA TO ANY PROCESSOR, THE CONTROLLER MUST
 ENTER INTO A WRITTEN, SIGNED CONTRACT WITH THAT PROCESSOR. SUCH CONTRACT
 MUST BE BINDING AND CLEARLY SET FORTH INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROCESSING  DATA,

 OR LIABILITY  ARISING  FROM  THE  PROCESSOR'S  BREACH  OF  THE  CONTRACT
 REQUIRED  BY  CLAUSE  (A)  OF  SUBPARAGRAPH  (I)  OF THIS PARAGRAPH OR A

 DATA.
  (II) A CONTROLLER MUST NOT SHARE, DISCLOSE, TRANSFER, OR SELL PERSONAL
 DATA, OR FACILITATE OR ENABLE THE PROCESSING, DISCLOSURE,  TRANSFER,  OR
 SALE  TO  A THIRD PARTY OF PERSONAL DATA IF IT CAN REASONABLY EXPECT THE
 PERSONAL DATA OF A CONSUMER TO BE USED FOR PURPOSES FOR WHICH A CONSUMER
 HAS EXERCISED THEIR  OPT-OUT  RIGHTS  PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF
 SECTION  ELEVEN  HUNDRED  TWO OF THIS ARTICLE, OR FOR WHICH THE CONSUMER

 THROUGH  (J)  OF SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OF PARAGRAPH (F) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 THIS SECTION.
  (B) A PROCESSOR IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLY  WITH  A  REQUEST  SUBMITTED
 PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE IF (I) THE CONSUMER SUBMITS THE REQUEST DIRECT-
 LY TO THE PROCESSOR; AND (II) THE PROCESSOR HAS PROCESSED THE CONSUMER'S

  (B)  EACH  INSTANCE  OF  UNLAWFUL  PROCESSING  COUNTS  AS  A  SEPARATE

 PROVISION OF  THIS  ARTICLE  THAT  IS  VIOLATED  COUNTS  AS  A  SEPARATE
 VIOLATION.
  (C)  IN ASSESSING THE AMOUNT OF PENALTIES, THE COURT MUST CONSIDER ANY
 ONE OR MORE OF THE  RELEVANT  CIRCUMSTANCES  PRESENTED  BY  ANY  OF  THE

 TATIONS IN ANY ACTION OR SPECIAL  PROCEEDING  BROUGHT  BY  THE  ATTORNEY
 GENERAL  AGAINST THE NONCOMPLIANT PERSON THAT ARISES OUT OF THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL'S INVESTIGATION.
  (B) IF A PERSON FAILS TO COMPLY WITH A  SUBPOENA  ISSUED  PURSUANT  TO

  PART CC
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "secure our
 data act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  The legislature finds that ransomware and
 other malware attacks have affected the electronically  stored  personal
 information  relating  to  thousands of people statewide and millions of
 people nationwide.  The  legislature  also  finds  that  state  entities
 receive  such  personal  information from various sources, including the
 data subjects themselves, other state entities, and the federal  govern-
 ment.  In addition, the legislature finds that state entities use such
 personal information to make determinations regarding the data subjects.
 The legislature further finds that New Yorkers  deserve  to  have  their
 personal  information that is in the possession of a state entity stored
 in a manner that will withstand any  attempt  by  ransomware  and  other
 malware to alter, change, or encrypt such information.
  Therefore,  the  legislature enacts the secure our data act which will
 guarantee that state entities  will  employ  the  proper  technology  to
 protect  the  personal information stored as backup information from any
 unauthorized alteration or change.
  § 3. The state technology law is amended by adding a new  section  210
 to read as follows:

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would modify the in-service  death  benefit  for  retirement
 eligible  members  of the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement
 System who are employed by New York State  as  correction  officers  and
 security  hospital  treatment  assistants.  The in-service death benefit
 will be the value of the pension reserve as if the member had retired on
 their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $1.7  million  in
 the  annual  contributions  of the State of New York for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future  years  this  cost  will  vary  but  is
 expected to average 0.1% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $10.4 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
  These estimated costs are based on 17,000 affected members employed by
 the State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $1.6  billion
 as of March 31, 2023.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the impact

 are amended to read as follows:
 S. 8305--B  132
 
  a. A member's final average salary shall be the average  wages  earned
 by  such  a  member during any three consecutive years which provide the
 highest average wage; provided, however, if the wages earned during  any
 year  included  in  the  period  used  to determine final average salary
 exceeds  that  of the average of the previous two years by more than ten
 percent, the amount in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from  the
 computation  of  final  average salary.  [Notwithstanding the preceding
 provisions of this subdivision to the contrary, for a member  who  first
 becomes  a  member of the New York state and local employees' retirement
 system on or after April first, two thousand twelve, or for a  New  York
 city  police/fire  revised  plan  member,  a New York city enhanced plan
 member who receives the ordinary  disability  benefit  provided  for  in
 subdivision c-1 of section five hundred six of this article or the acci-

 revised  plan member, a member's final average salary shall be the aver-
 age wages earned by such a member  during  any  five  consecutive  years
 which  provide the highest average wage; provided, however, if the wages
 earned during any year included in the period used  to  determine  final
 average salary exceeds that of the average of the previous four years by
 more  than  ten  percent,  the  amount in excess of ten percent shall be
 excluded from the computation of final average salary.]  In  determining
 final  average  salary  pursuant  to  any provision of this subdivision,
 where the period used to determine final average salary  is  the  period
 which  immediately  precedes the date of retirement, any month or months
 (not in excess of twelve) which would otherwise be included in computing
 final average salary but during which the member was on authorized leave
 of absence at partial pay or without pay  shall  be  excluded  from  the
 computation  of final average salary and the month or an equal number of
 months immediately preceding such period shall be  substituted  in  lieu
 thereof.
  b.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision a of this section,
 with respect to members of the  New  York  state  employees'  retirement
 system [who first become members of the New York state and local employ-
 ees' retirement system before April first, two thousand twelve], the New
 York  state and local police and fire retirement system and the New York
 city teachers' retirement system, a member's final average salary  shall
 be  equal  to  one-third  of  the  highest total wages earned during any
 continuous period of employment for which the member was  credited  with
 three  years  of  service credit; provided, however, if the wages earned
 during any year of credited service included the period used  to  deter-
 mine final average salary exceeds the average of the wages of the previ-
 ous  two  years of credited service by more than ten percent, the amount
 in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from the computation of final
 average salary. [For members who first become a member of the  New  York
 state  and  local  employees' retirement system on or after April first,
 two thousand twelve, with respect to members of the New York  state  and
 local  employees'  retirement  system,  a  member's final average salary
 shall be equal to one-fifth of the highest total wages earned during any
 continuous period of employment for which the member was  credited  with

 during any year of credited service included the period used  to  deter-
 mine final average salary exceeds the average of the wages of the previ-
 ous  four years of credited service by more than ten percent, the amount
 S. 8305--B  133

 in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from the computation of final
 average salary.]
  §  2. Subdivisions a and b of section 608 of the retirement and social
 security law, as amended by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, are  amended
 to read as follows:
  a. [For members who first become members of a public retirement system
 of  the  state  before  April  first, two thousand twelve, a] A member's
 final average salary shall be the average wages earned by such a  member
 during  any  three  consecutive  years which provide the highest average
 wage; provided, however, if the wages earned during any year included in
 the period used to determine final average salary exceeds  that  of  the
 average  of  the previous two years by more than ten percent, the amount
 in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from the computation of final
 average salary. [For members who first become members of  the  New  York
 state  and  local  employees'  retirement  system  or the New York state
 teachers' retirement system  on  or  after  April  first,  two  thousand
 twelve,  a  member's  final  average  salary  shall be the average wages
 earned by such member during any five consecutive  years  which  provide
 the  highest average wage; provided, however, if the wages earned during
 any year included in the period used to determine final  average  salary
 exceeds  that of the average of the previous four years by more than ten
 percent, the amount in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from  the
 computation of final average salary.] Where the period used to determine
 final  average  salary is the period which immediately precedes the date
 of retirement, any month or months (not in excess of twelve) which would
 otherwise be included in computing final average salary but during which
 the member was on authorized leave of absence at partial pay or  without
 pay  shall  be excluded from the computation of final average salary and
 the month or an equal number of months immediately preceding such period
 shall be substituted in lieu thereof.
  b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a  of  this  section,
 with respect to members [who first became members] of the New York state
 and  local  employees' retirement system and the New York city teachers'
 retirement system [before April first, two thousand twelve], a  member's
 final  average  salary  shall be equal to one-third of the highest total
 wages earned by such member during any continuous period  of  employment
 for  which  the  member was credited with three years of service credit;
 provided, however, if the wages  earned  during  any  year  of  credited
 service  included  in  the period used to determine final average salary
 exceeds the average of the wages of the previous two years  of  credited
 service  by  more  than ten percent, the amount in excess of ten percent
 shall be excluded from the computation of final  average  salary.  [With
 respect  to  members  who first become members of the New York state and
 local employees' retirement system  and  the  New  York  city  teachers'
 retirement  system  on  or  after  April  first,  two thousand twelve, a
 member's final average salary shall be equal to one-fifth of the highest
 total wages earned by  such  member  during  any  continuous  period  of
 employment  for which the member was credited with five years of service
 credit; provided, however, if the wages earned during any year of  cred-
 ited  service  included  in  the  period used to determine final average
 salary exceeds the average of the wages of the previous  four  years  of
 credited  service  by more than ten percent, the amount in excess of ten
 percent shall be excluded from the computation of final average salary.]
  § 3. Subparagraph (ii) of paragraph 14 of  subdivision  e  of  section
 13-638.4  of the administrative code of the city of New York, as amended
 by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, is amended to read as follows:
 S. 8305--B  134
 
  (ii) Subject to the provisions of subdivision f of this section  where
 those  provisions  are applicable, and notwithstanding the provisions of
 subdivisions a and c of section six hundred eight of  the  RSSL,  for  a
 tier  IV member of NYCERS who is a New York city revised plan member (as
 defined  in  subdivision  m of section six hundred one of the RSSL) or a
 tier IV member of BERS who is a New York city revised plan  member,  the
 term  "final  average  salary",  as used in article fifteen of the RSSL,
 shall be equal to [one-fifth]  ONE-THIRD  of  the  highest  total  wages
 earned  by  such  member  during any continuous period of employment for
 which the member was credited with [five] THREE years of service credit;
 provided that if the wages earned during any year  of  credited  service
 included  in  the  period used to determine final average salary exceeds
 the average of the wages of the previous four years of credited  service
 by  more  than ten percent, the amount in excess of ten percent shall be
 excluded from the computation of final average salary, provided  further
 that  "wages",  as  used  in  this  paragraph, shall mean the applicable
 provisions and limitations of the term "wages", as defined  in  subdivi-
 sion l of section six hundred one of the RSSL.
  §  4. Subdivision a of section 1209 of the retirement and social secu-
 rity law, as amended by chapter 705 of the laws of 2023, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  a.  For  members  who  first  become members of the New York state and
 local police and fire retirement system on or  after  April  first,  two
 thousand  twelve, a member's final average salary shall be equal to one-
 fifth of the highest total  wages  earned  by  such  member  during  any
 continuous  period  of employment for which the member was credited with
 five years of service credit; provided, however,  if  the  wages  earned
 during  any  year  of  credited  service  included in the period used to
 determine final average salary exceeds the average of the wages  of  the
 previous  four  years  of credited service by more than ten percent, the
 amount in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from  the  computation
 of final average salary.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, BEGINNING ON OR AFTER APRIL
 FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, A MEMBER'S FINAL AVERAGE SALARY SHALL
 BE EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF THE HIGHEST TOTAL WAGES EARNED BY  SUCH  MEMBER
 DURING  ANY  CONTINUOUS  PERIOD  OF  EMPLOYMENT FOR WHICH THE MEMBER WAS
 CREDITED WITH THREE YEARS OF SERVICE CREDIT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,  IF  THE
 WAGES  EARNED DURING ANY YEAR OF CREDITED SERVICE INCLUDED IN THE PERIOD
 USED TO DETERMINE FINAL AVERAGE SALARY EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE OF THE  WAGES
 OF  THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE BY MORE THAN TEN PERCENT,
 THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF TEN PERCENT SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE  COMPUTA-
 TION  OF FINAL AVERAGE SALARY. Wages in excess of the annual salary paid
 to the governor pursuant to section three of article four of  the  state
 constitution  shall  be  excluded  from the computation of final average
 salary for members who first become members of the New  York  state  and
 local  police  and  fire  retirement system on or after April first, two
 thousand twelve.
  § 5.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall be subject  to  section  25  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide Tier 6 members in the New York State and Local
 Retirement  System  a final average salary based on their highest salary
 earned over three consecutive years, where the salary earned in any year
 cannot exceed the average of the previous two years by  more  than  10%.
 Currently,  final  average  salary  for  these members is based on their
 S. 8305--B  135
 
 highest salary earned over five  consecutive  years,  where  the  salary
 earned  in any year cannot exceed the average of the previous four years
 by more than 10%. The provisions of Section 25  of  the  Retirement  and
 Social Security Law shall not apply.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be shared by  the
 State  of New York and the local participating employers in the NYSLERS.
 If this bill were enacted  during  the  2024  Legislative  Session,  the
 increase  in  the present value of benefits would be approximately $1.17
 billion.
  NYSLERS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $0  $220 million
  Tier 6  $1.17 billion  $950 million
  Total  $1.17 billion  $1.17 billion

  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by  increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating  employers  in  NYSLERS  is  0.4%  of  billable salary, or
 approximately $51 million to the State of New York and approximately $76
 million to the local participating employers. THIS PERMANENT ANNUAL COST
 WILL INCREASE as Tier 6 salary grows and will  vary  by  employer  based
 upon the plan coverage and salary reported in Tier 6.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would  be  shared
 by  the  State  of New York and the local participating employers in the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the increase in the present value of  benefits  would  be  approximately
 $341 million.
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $0  $33 million
  Tier 6  $341 million  $308 million
  Total  $341 million  $341 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating  employers in the NYSLPFRS is 0.70% of billable salary, or
 approximately $6.0 million to the State of New  York  and  approximately
 $25  million to the local participating employers.  THE PERMANENT ANNUAL
 COST WILL INCREASE as Tier 6 salary grows  and  will  vary  by  employer
 based upon the plan coverage and salary reported in Tier 6.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based  on  265,533 Tier 6 members in the
 NYSLERS and 16,599 Tier 6 members in the NYSLPFRS, with annual salary of
 approximately $12 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively,  as  of  March
 31, 2023.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2023 actuari-
 al valuation.  Distributions and other statistics can be  found  in  the
 2023  Report  of the Actuary and the 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.

 fication Standards to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated February 2,  2024,  and  intended  for  use  only
 during  the  2024  Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note No. 2024-118,
 prepared by the Actuary for the New  York  State  and  Local  Retirement
 System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As  it relates to the New York State Teacher's Retirement System, this
 bill would amend subdivisions a and b of Section 608 of  the  Retirement
 and Social Security Law to change the definition of final average salary
 for  Tier  6 members to be the same as that for Tier 3, 4 and 5 members.
 The final average salary for Tier 6 members would be based on any  three
 consecutive  years  which produce the highest average salary. Currently,
 the final average salary for Tier 6 members is  based  on  the  salaries
 earned during any five consecutive years which provide the highest aver-
 age  salary. Additionally, under the bill, as in Tier 3, 4 and 5, if the
 salary for any year used in the period exceeds that of  the  average  of
 the  prior two years by more than 10%, the amount in excess of 10% shall
 be excluded from the computation. Currently, under Tier 6, if the salary
 for any year used in the period exceeds that of the average of the prior
 four years by more than 10%, the amount in excess  of  10%  is  excluded
 from the computation.
  The  annual  cost  to  the  employers of members of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System for this benefit is estimated  to  be  $23.1
 million or 0.12% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The  System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer contribution
 rate that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without  any
 assets, is equal to 5.31% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture.  This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost of
 Tier 6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed  change
 to  the  Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new entrant rate
 is estimated to increase to 5.55% of pay, an increase of 0.24% of pay.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System.  The most recent data  distributions  and  statistics
 can  be  found  in the System's Annual Report for fiscal year ended June
 30, 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial state-
 ments and can also be found in the  System's  Annual  Report.  Actuarial
 assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.
  The  source  of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2024-17 dated February 2,
 2024 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State  Teach-
 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2024
 Legislative Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary  for  the
 New  York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the Ameri-
 can Academy of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards  of  the

 Tier 6 members of NYCRS by reducing the number of years included in  the
 average from five years to three years.

  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS: Currently, Final Average Salary (FAS) is
 based on a five-year average, with each year's salary limited to 110% of
 the average of the prior four year's salaries for the following groups:
  * Tier 3 and Tier 6 members who joined NYCRS  on  or  after  April  1,
 2012, and
  *  Tier 3 enhanced members of POLICE and FIRE who retire for disabili-
 ty.
  Under the proposed legislation, the FAS  for  such  members  would  be
 based  on  a three-year average, with each year's salary limited to 110%
 of the average of the prior two year's salaries (prior four year's sala-
 ries for NYCERS and BERS).
  The five-year FAS for enhanced disability benefits for Corrections and
 Sanitation members of NYCERS is provided as part of an  agreement  under
 Retirement  and  Social Security Law Article 25 and is assumed to remain
 unchanged by this proposed legislation.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

  Section 1. Subdivision 3 of section 363-a of the retirement and social
 security law, as amended by chapter 437 of the laws of 2016, is  amended
 to read as follows:
  3.  As used in this section, the terms "firefighter" and "police offi-
 cer" mean any member who is performing police or fire  service,  as  the
 phrase police or fire service is defined in paragraphs a, b, c, d, f (as
 added by chapter six hundred seventy-four of the laws of nineteen eight-
 y-six),  f (as added by chapter six hundred seventy-seven of the laws of
 S. 8305--B  147
 
 nineteen eighty-six), g, h, I and j of  subdivision  eleven  of  section
 three  hundred two of this article, and who, prior to entry into service

 ty law) for any member of a public retirement  system  or  pension  plan
 funded  by the state or one of its political subdivisions, nor shall any

 by the provisions of section 480 of the retirement and  social  security
 law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.-- Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  is  a  technical  correction to Chapter 561 of the Laws of
 2015.  It would add a  "heart  bill"  performance  of  duty  disability
 provision  for  police  officers of the State University of New York who
 are members of the New York State and Local Police and  Fire  Retirement
 System (NYSLPFRS).
  If this legislation is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, it
 would  lead  to more disabilities being classified as "in performance of
 duty".
  However, we anticipate that few additional performance of  duty  disa-
 bility  retirements  will  be granted, and thus, the resulting costs are
 expected to be negligible.
  These estimated costs are based on 557 affected  members  employed  by
 the State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $53.8 million
 as of March 31, 2023.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2023 actuari-
 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the
 2023  Report  of the Actuary and the 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.
  The actuarial assumptions and methods used are described in  the  2023
 Annual  Report  to  the  Comptroller  on  Actuarial Assumptions, and the
 Codes, Rules and Regulations  of  the  State  of  New  York:  Audit  and
 Control.
  The Market Assets and GASB Disclosures are found in the March 31, 2023
 New  York  State  and  Local  Retirement System Financial Statements and
 Supplementary Information.
  I am a member of the American Academy of Actuaries and meet the Quali-
 fication Standards to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated March 5, 2024, and intended for use  only  during
 the  2024  Legislative  Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2024-91, prepared by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.

  FISCAL NOTE.-- Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 S. 8305--B  150
 
  This bill would allow any Tier 6 member who is a uniformed court offi-
 cer  or  peace  officer  employed  by the unified court system to retire
 without early age  reduction  upon  attaining  30  years  of  creditable
 service  and age 55. It would also reduce the normal retirement age from
 63  to  62  and  lessen  the reductions in benefits for those who retire
 prior to normal retirement age.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be borne entirely
 by  the  State  of  New  York. If this bill were enacted during the 2024
 Legislative Session, the increase in the present value of benefits would
 be approximately $34.2 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a past service cost to cover retrospective  benefit  increases  and  (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New York will be
 required to pay $18.9 million as of March 1, 2025.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of the
 State of New York will include a separate itemized charge equal to  1.0%
 of  billable salary reported to the NYSLERS for the affected members, or
 approximately $2.2 million beginning in fiscal  year  ending  March  31,
 2025.  This  PERMANENT  ANNUAL COST WILL INCREASE as Tier 6 salary grows
 and will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in  the  billing
 rate.
  These  estimated costs are based on 2,207 affected members employed by
 New York State, with annual salary of approximately $166 million  as  of
 March 31, 2023.

  § 3. Subdivision a of section 603 of the retirement and social securi-
 ty law, as amended by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, is amended to read
 as follows:
  a.  The  service  retirement  benefit specified in section six hundred
 four of this article shall be payable to members who have met the  mini-
 mum  service  requirements  upon retirement and attainment of age sixty-
 two, other than members who are eligible for  early  service  retirement
 pursuant to subdivision c of section six hundred four-b of this article,
 subdivision c of section six hundred four-c of this article, subdivision
 d  of  section  six  hundred  four-d  of  this article, subdivision c of
 section six hundred four-e of this article, subdivision c of section six
 hundred four-f of this article, subdivision c  of  section  six  hundred
 four-g  of  this article, subdivision c of section six hundred four-h of

 provided,  however, a member of a teachers' retirement system or the New
 York state and local employees' retirement system who first  joins  such
 system  before  January  first,  two  thousand  ten or a member who is a
 uniformed court officer or peace officer employed by the  unified  court

 system  who  first  becomes  a  member  of  the New York state and local
 employees' retirement system before April first, two thousand twelve may
 retire without reduction of [his or her] THEIR retirement  benefit  upon
 attainment  of at least fifty-five years of age and completion of thirty
 or more years of service, provided,  however,  that  a  uniformed  court
 officer  or peace officer employed by the unified court system who first
 becomes a member of the New York state and local  employees'  retirement
 system  on  or after January first, two thousand ten and retires without
 reduction of [his or her] THEIR retirement benefit upon attainment of at

 made available to the member; provided that the New York city employees'
 retirement  system shall notify the legislative bill drafting commission
 upon the occurrence of such a change in federal law ruling affecting the
 provisions of this act in order that  the  commission  may  maintain  an
 accurate and timely effective data base of the official text of the laws

 of section 44 of the legislative law and  section  70-b  of  the  public
 officers law;
  (b)  The  amendments to subdivision a of section 603 of the retirement
 and social security law made by section three  of  this  act  shall  not
 affect  the expiration of such subdivision and shall be deemed to expire
 therewith.
 
  PART PP
 
  Section 1. Section 212 of the retirement and social  security  law  is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 2-a to read as follows:
  2-A.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  THIS
 SECTION, THE EARNING LIMITATIONS FOR RETIRED  PERSONS  IN  POSITIONS  OF
 PUBLIC  SERVICE  SHALL  BE  INCREASED TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE
 YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR AND THEREAFTER.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow a retired person of the New York State and Local
 Retirement System who returns to public employment with an annual salary
 of $50,000 or less to continue to receive their full retirement benefit.
 Currently, the salary limit is $35,000.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  (NYSLERS), if this bill were enacted during the 2024
 Legislative Session, the direct cost incurred  would  be  the  retiree's
 S. 8305--B  159
 
 pension  benefit paid while post-retirement earnings are between $35,000
 and $50,000 each calendar year. The pension benefit expected to be  paid
 by  the  NYSLERS  during that 2.5-month period is estimated to be $9,000
 per person.
  In addition to the direct cost quoted above, there would be additional
 costs  in  the  form  of lost employer contributions due to non-billable
 post-retirement earnings, which is estimated to be $2,250 per person.
  In the NYSLERS, pursuant to Section 25 of the  Retirement  and  Social
 Security  Law,  the increased costs would be borne entirely by the State
 of New York and would require an itemized  appropriation  sufficient  to
 pay the cost of the provision. For each retiree rehired pursuant to this
 proposal, an annual cost of $11,250 is expected.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), if this bill were enacted during  the
 2024  Legislative  Session,  the  direct  cost  incurred  would  be  the
 retiree's  pension  benefit  paid  while  post-retirement  earnings  are
 between  $35,000  and  $50,000  each  calendar year. The pension benefit
 expected to be paid by the NYSLPFRS during that 1-month period is  esti-
 mated to be $7,500 per person.
  In addition to the direct cost quoted above, there would be additional
 costs  in  the  form  of lost employer contributions due to non-billable
 post-retirement earnings, which is estimated to be $4,500 per person.
  In the NYSLPFRS, all costs will be shared by the State of New York and
 all participating employers in the NYSLPFRS and spread over future bill-
 ing cycles. For each retiree rehired pursuant to this proposal, an annu-
 al cost of $12,000 is expected.
  In addition to the direct costs quoted above, insofar as this proposal
 disrupts the usual pattern and timing of employee turnover (that is,  if
 members  retire  earlier than assumed and participating employers hire a
 retiree instead of a new billable member),  shifts  in  member  behavior
 could  generate losses that increase the average billing rate in 20-year
 and 25-year service-based plans from 31.2% to 40.8%. In age-based plans,
 average billing rates could increase from 15.2%  to  18.7%.  The  actual
 increase  in billing rates will depend upon member and employer utiliza-
 tion, with the rates above representing an upper maximum.
  Since this proposal exclusively benefits retirees, the increased costs
 are primarily attributable to retirees from Tiers 1 -- 3.  Approximately
 half  the contributions required to fund this proposal will be collected
 on salary reported for current members of Tier 6.

  PART QQ
 
  Section  1.  Section  3  of  part HH of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022
 amending the retirement and social  security  law  relating  to  waiving
 approval and income limitations on retirees employed in school districts
 and  board  of cooperative educational services, as amended by section 1
 of part V of chapter 55 of the laws of  2023,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed June 30, [2024] 2025.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow retirees employed by a  New  York  State  school
 district  or by the board of cooperative educational services (BOCES) to
 collect a salary without suspension or diminution of their pension bene-
 fit through June 30, 2025.
  Pursuant to Section 25 of the Retirement and Social Security Law,  the
 increased  costs  would  be  borne entirely by the State of New York and
 would require an itemized appropriation sufficient to pay  the  cost  of
 the provision.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), if this bill were enacted during  the  2024
 Legislative  Session,  the  direct  cost incurred would be the retiree's
 pension benefit paid while post-retirement earnings  are  above  $35,000
 each  calendar  year.  The  pension  benefit  expected to be paid by the
 NYSLERS during that 6-month  period  is  estimated  to  be  $22,000  per
 person.
  In addition to the direct cost quoted above, there would be additional
 costs  in  the  form  of lost employer contributions due to non-billable
 post-retirement earnings, which is estimated to be $5,500 per person.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by including a
 separate itemized charge on the New York State annual invoice, equal  to
 the costs quoted above, plus interest.
  The  number  of  members  and  retirees  who could be affected by this
 legislation cannot be readily determined. For each retiree hired  pursu-
 ant to this proposal, an annual cost of $27,500 is expected.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  allow  any non-seasonally appointed sworn member or
 officer of the division of law enforcement, police  officer,  or  forest
 ranger  in  the  department  of environmental conservation; any regional
 state park police officer; or any university police  officer  to  become
 covered  by  the  provisions of a special 20-year retirement plan, which
 will provide a benefit of one-half of final average salary upon  retire-
 ment  and  an additional benefit of one-sixtieth of final average salary
 for each year of creditable service in excess of 20 years, not to exceed
 12 years.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $6.6  million  in
 the  annual  contributions  of the State of New York for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future  years  this  cost  will  vary  but  is
 expected to average 3.9% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $70.3 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025. If the State of  New
 York  elects  to  amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for
 each year including interest would be $8.98 million.
  These estimated costs are based on 1,228 affected members employed  by
 the  State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $131 million
 as of March 31, 2023.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the  impact

 al  valuation.  Distributions and other statistics can be found in the

 § 440.10 Motion to vacate judgment.
  1. At any time after the entry of a judgment OBTAINED AT TRIAL  OR  BY
 PLEA, the court in which it was entered may, upon motion of the [defend-
 ant] APPLICANT, vacate such judgment upon the ground that:
  (a) The court did not have jurisdiction of the action or of the person
 of the [defendant] APPLICANT; or
  (b) The judgment was procured by duress, misrepresentation or fraud on
 the  part  of  the  court  or  a prosecutor or a person acting for or in
 behalf of a court or a prosecutor; or
  (c) [Material evidence adduced at a trial] EVIDENCE  THAT  WAS  LIKELY
 RELIED  UPON BY A FACT FINDER resulting in the judgment AT TRIAL OR THAT
 WAS LIKELY RELIED UPON BY ANY PARTY AS A BASIS FOR A PLEA AGREEMENT  was
 false  [and was, prior to the entry of the judgment, known by the prose-
 cutor or by the court to be false]; or
  (d) [Material evidence adduced by the people at a trial] EVIDENCE THAT
 WAS LIKELY RELIED UPON BY A FACT FINDER resulting  in  the  judgment  AT
 S. 8305--B  175
 
 TRIAL  OR THAT WAS LIKELY RELIED UPON BY ANY PARTY AS A BASIS FOR A PLEA
 AGREEMENT was procured in violation  of  the  [defendant's]  APPLICANT'S
 rights under the constitution of this state or of the United States; or
  (e)  During the proceedings resulting in the judgment, the [defendant]
 APPLICANT, by reason of mental  disease  or  defect,  was  incapable  of
 understanding or participating in such proceedings; or
  (f)  Improper  [and  prejudicial]  conduct not appearing in the record
 occurred during a trial resulting in the judgment which conduct,  if  it
 had  appeared  in  the  record,  would  have  [required] MADE POSSIBLE a
 reversal of the judgment upon an appeal therefrom; or
  (g) New evidence has been discovered [since the entry  of  a  judgment
 based  upon  a  verdict of guilty after trial, which could not have been
 produced by the defendant at the trial even with due  diligence  on  his
 part  and  which]  OR  BECOME  AVAILABLE THAT, WHEN VIEWED ALONE OR WITH
 OTHER EVIDENCE, is of such character as to create a REASONABLE probabil-
 ity that had such evidence been received  at  the  trial  OR  DISCOVERED
 PRIOR  TO  TRIAL  OR  PLEA AGREEMENT THAT the verdict OR PLEA would have
 been more favorable to the [defendant; provided that a motion based upon
 such ground must be made with due diligence after the discovery of  such
 alleged  new  evidence]  APPLICANT. TYPES OF NEW EVIDENCE SHALL INCLUDE,
 BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO NEWLY AVAILABLE FORENSIC EVIDENCE OR EVIDENCE THAT
 HAS EITHER BEEN REPUDIATED BY THE EXPERT  WHO  ORIGINALLY  PROVIDED  THE
 OPINION  AT  A  HEARING  OR  TRIAL  OR THAT HAS BEEN UNDERMINED BY LATER
 SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES; or
  (g-1) [Forensic DNA]  IN  CASES  INVOLVING  THE  FORENSIC  testing  of
 evidence  performed since the entry of a judgment, [(1) in the case of a
 defendant convicted after a guilty plea, the court has  determined  that
 the  defendant  has  demonstrated  a  substantial  probability  that the
 defendant was actually innocent of the offense of which he  or  she  was
 convicted,  or  (2) in the case of a defendant convicted after a trial,]
 the court has determined that there exists a reasonable probability that
 the verdict OR PLEA OFFER would have been more favorable to the [defend-
 ant] APPLICANT, OR THE APPLICANT WOULD HAVE REJECTED THE PLEA OFFER.
  (h) The judgment was obtained in violation of a right of the  [defend-
 ant]  APPLICANT  under  the  constitution of this state or of the United
 States, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A JUDGMENT ENTERED, WHETHER  UPON
 TRIAL OR GUILTY PLEA, AGAINST AN APPLICANT WHO IS ACTUALLY INNOCENT.  AN
 APPLICANT  IS  ACTUALLY INNOCENT WHERE THE APPLICANT PROVES BY A PREPON-
 DERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT NO REASONABLE JURY OF THE APPLICANT'S PEERS
 WOULD HAVE FOUND THE APPLICANT GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT; or
  (i) The judgment is a conviction where the  [defendant's]  APPLICANT'S
 participation in the offense was a result of having been a victim of sex
 trafficking  under section 230.34 of the penal law, sex trafficking of a
 child under section 230.34-a of the penal law, labor  trafficking  under
 section  135.35  of  the  penal  law, aggravated labor trafficking under
 section 135.37 of the penal law, compelling prostitution  under  section
 230.33 of the penal law, or trafficking in persons under the Trafficking
 Victims  Protection  Act  (United  States  Code,  title 22, chapter 78);
 provided that
  (i) official documentation of the [defendant's] APPLICANT'S status  as
 a  victim  of sex trafficking, labor trafficking, aggravated labor traf-
 ficking, compelling prostitution, or trafficking in persons at the  time
 of  the  offense  from a federal, state or local government agency shall
 create a presumption that the [defendant's] APPLICANT'S participation in
 the offense was a result of having been a  victim  of  sex  trafficking,
 labor trafficking, aggravated labor trafficking, compelling prostitution
 S. 8305--B  176
 
 or  trafficking  in  persons,  but  shall not be required for granting a
 motion under this paragraph;
  (ii) a motion under this paragraph, and all pertinent papers and docu-
 ments, shall be confidential and may not be made available to any person
 or  public  or  private [entity] AGENCY except [where] WHEN specifically
 authorized by the court; and
  (iii) when a motion is filed under this paragraph, the court may, upon
 the consent of the petitioner and all of the  INVOLVED  state  [and]  OR
 local  prosecutorial agencies [that prosecuted each matter], consolidate
 into one proceeding a motion to vacate judgments imposed by distinct  or
 multiple criminal courts; or
  (j)  The  judgment is a conviction for [a class A or unclassified] ANY
 misdemeanor entered prior to the effective date of  this  paragraph  and
 satisfies  the  ground  prescribed in paragraph (h) of this subdivision.
 There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a  conviction  by  plea  to
 such  an  offense  was  not knowing, voluntary and intelligent, based on
 ongoing collateral consequences, including  potential  or  actual  immi-
 gration consequences, and there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a
 conviction  by  verdict  constitutes  cruel and unusual punishment under
 section five of article one of the  state  constitution  based  on  such
 consequences; or
  (k)  The  judgment occurred prior to the effective date of the laws of
 two thousand [twenty-one] TWENTY-THREE that amended this  paragraph  and
 is  a  conviction  for an offense as defined in [subparagraphs] SUBPARA-
 GRAPH (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of paragraph (k) of subdivision three  of
 section  160.50  of this part, OR A MISDEMEANOR UNDER THE FORMER ARTICLE
 TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE OF THE PENAL LAW, in which case the  court  shall
 presume  that  a  conviction by plea for the aforementioned offenses was
 not knowing, voluntary and intelligent  if  it  has  severe  or  ongoing
 consequences,  including  but  not  limited to potential or actual immi-
 gration consequences, and shall presume that a conviction by verdict for
 the aforementioned offenses constitutes  cruel  and  unusual  punishment
 under  section  five  of article one of the state constitution, based on
 those consequences. The people may rebut these presumptions[.]; OR
  (L) ANY OFFENSE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK THAT AN  INTERMEDIATE  APPEL-
 LATE COURT, COURT OF APPEALS, OR UNITED STATES FEDERAL COURT WITH JURIS-
 DICTION  OVER  NEW  YORK STATE LAW ISSUES HAS DEEMED IN VIOLATION OF THE
 CONSTITUTION OF THIS STATE OR OF THE UNITED STATES, OR ANY  OTHER  RIGHT
 UNDER STATE OR FEDERAL LAW.
  2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one, the court [must]
 MAY deny a motion to vacate a judgment when:
  (a)  The  ground or issue raised upon the motion was previously deter-
 mined on the merits upon an appeal from the judgment, unless  since  the
 time  of  such  appellate  determination  there has been a retroactively
 effective change in the law controlling such issue. HOWEVER, IF  ALL  OF
 THE  EVIDENCE  CURRENTLY BEFORE THE COURT WAS NOT DULY CONSIDERED PREVI-
 OUSLY BY THE COURT, THE COURT SHALL GRANT THE MOTION OR ORDER THE  HEAR-
 ING; or
  (b)  The judgment is, at the time of the motion, appealable or pending
 on appeal, and sufficient facts appear on the record with respect to the
 ground or issue raised upon the motion to permit adequate review thereof
 upon such an appeal unless the issue raised upon such motion is ineffec-
 tive assistance of counsel. This paragraph shall not apply to  a  motion
 under paragraph (i), (J), (K) OR (L) of subdivision one of this section;
 or
 S. 8305--B  177
 
  (c) [Although sufficient facts appear on the record of the proceedings
 underlying  the  judgment to have permitted, upon appeal from such judg-
 ment, adequate review of the ground or issue raised upon the motion,  no
 such appellate review or determination occurred owing to the defendant's
 unjustifiable failure to take or perfect an appeal during the prescribed
 period  or  to  his or her unjustifiable failure to raise such ground or
 issue upon an appeal actually perfected by him or her unless  the  issue
 raised upon such motion is ineffective assistance of counsel; or
  (d)]  The ground or issue raised relates solely to the validity of the
 sentence and not to the validity of the conviction. IN  SUCH  CASE,  THE
 COURT SHALL DEEM THE MOTION TO HAVE BEEN MADE PURSUANT TO SECTION 440.20
 OF THIS ARTICLE.
  [3.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subdivision one, the court may
 deny a motion to vacate a judgment when:
  (a) Although facts in support of the ground or issue raised  upon  the
 motion  could with due diligence by the defendant have readily been made
 to appear on the record in a manner providing adequate basis for  review
 of  such ground or issue upon an appeal from the judgment, the defendant
 unjustifiably failed to adduce such matter prior  to  sentence  and  the
 ground or issue in question was not subsequently determined upon appeal.
 This  paragraph does not apply to a motion based upon deprivation of the
 right to counsel at the trial or upon failure  of  the  trial  court  to
 advise  the  defendant of such right, or to a motion under paragraph (i)
 of subdivision one of this section; or
  (b) The ground or issue raised upon the motion was  previously  deter-
 mined on the merits upon a prior motion or proceeding in a court of this
 state,  other  than  an  appeal  from  the judgment, or upon a motion or
 proceeding in a federal court; unless since the time  of  such  determi-
 nation  there  has  been  a  retroactively  effective  change in the law
 controlling such issue; or
  (c) Upon a previous motion made pursuant to this section, the  defend-
 ant was in a position adequately to raise the ground or issue underlying
 the present motion but did not do so.]
  (D)  Although  the  court may deny the motion under any of the circum-
 stances specified in this subdivision, in the interest  of  justice  and
 for  good cause shown it may in its discretion grant the motion if it is
 otherwise meritorious and vacate the judgment.
  [4.] 3. If the court grants the motion, it must, except as provided in
 subdivision [five] FOUR or [six] FIVE of this section, vacate the  judg-
 ment, and must EITHER:
  (A) dismiss AND SEAL the accusatory instrument, or
  (B) order a new trial, or
  (C) take such other action as is appropriate in the circumstances.
  [5.]  4.  Upon  granting  the motion upon the ground, as prescribed in
 paragraph (g) of subdivision one, that newly discovered evidence creates
 a probability that had such evidence been  received  at  the  trial  the
 verdict  would  have been more favorable to the [defendant] APPLICANT in
 that the conviction would have been for a lesser offense  than  the  one
 contained in the verdict, the court may either:
  (a) Vacate the judgment and order a new trial; or
  (b) With the consent of the people, modify the judgment by reducing it
 to  one  of  conviction for such lesser offense. In such case, the court
 must re-sentence the [defendant] APPLICANT accordingly.
  [6.] 5. If the court grants a motion under [paragraph  (i)  or]  para-
 graph  [(k)]  (H),  (I),  (J),  (K)  OR  (L)  of subdivision one of this
 section, it must vacate the judgment [and] ON THE  MERITS,  dismiss  the
 S. 8305--B  178
 
 accusatory  instrument,  SEAL THE JUDGMENT, and may take such additional
 action as is appropriate in the circumstances. [In the case of a  motion
 granted  under  paragraph  (i)  of  subdivision one of this section, the
 court  must  vacate  the  judgment on the merits because the defendant's
 participation in the offense was a result of having  been  a  victim  of
 trafficking.
  7.]  6.  Upon  a new trial resulting from an order vacating a judgment
 pursuant to this section, the indictment is deemed to  contain  all  the
 counts  and to charge all the offenses which it contained and charged at
 the time the previous trial was commenced,  regardless  of  whether  any
 count was dismissed by the court in the course of such trial, except (a)
 those upon or of which the [defendant] APPLICANT was acquitted or deemed
 to  have  been  acquitted, and (b) those dismissed by the order vacating
 the judgment, and (c) those previously dismissed by an  appellate  court
 upon  an appeal from the judgment, or by any court upon a previous post-
 judgment motion.
  [8.] 7. Upon an order which vacates a judgment based upon  a  plea  of
 guilty to an accusatory instrument or a part thereof, but which does not
 dismiss the entire accusatory instrument, the criminal action is, in the
 absence  of  an  express  direction  to  the  contrary,  restored to its
 [prepleading] PRE-PLEADING  status  and  the  accusatory  instrument  is
 deemed to contain all the counts and to charge all the offenses which it
 contained and charged at the time of the entry of the plea, except those
 subsequently  dismissed  under circumstances specified in paragraphs (b)
 and (c) of subdivision six.  Where the plea of guilty  was  entered  and
 accepted,  pursuant  to  subdivision  three  of section 220.30, upon the
 condition that it constituted a complete disposition  not  only  of  the
 accusatory instrument underlying the judgment vacated but also of one or
 more other accusatory instruments against the [defendant] APPLICANT then
 pending  in  the  same  court, the order of vacation completely restores
 such other accusatory instruments; and such is the case even though such
 order dismisses the main accusatory instrument underlying the judgment.
  [9.] 8. Upon granting of a motion pursuant to paragraph (j) of  subdi-
 vision one of this section, the court may either:
  (a)  With the consent of the people, vacate the judgment or modify the
 judgment by reducing it to one of conviction for a lesser offense; or
  (b) Vacate the judgment and order a new trial wherein the  [defendant]
 APPLICANT enters a plea to the same offense in order to permit the court
 to resentence the [defendant] APPLICANT in accordance with the amendato-
 ry provisions of subdivision one-a of section 70.15 of the penal law.
  §  3.  Section  440.20 of the criminal procedure law, subdivision 1 as
 amended by chapter 1 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:
 § 440.20 Motion to set aside sentence; by [defendant] APPLICANT.
  1. At any time after the entry of a judgment, the court in  which  the
 judgment  was entered may, upon motion of the [defendant] APPLICANT, set
 aside the sentence upon the ground that it was  unauthorized,  illegally
 imposed,  EXCEEDED  THE  MAXIMUM  ALLOWED BY LAW, OBTAINED OR IMPOSED IN
 VIOLATION OF THE DEFENDANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS,  or  WAS  otherwise
 invalid  as  a matter of law.  Where the judgment includes a sentence of
 death, the court may also set aside the sentence upon any of the grounds
 set forth in paragraph (b), (c), (f), (g) or (h) of subdivision  one  of
 section  440.10  as  applied  to  a separate sentencing proceeding under
 section 400.27, provided, however, that to  the  extent  the  ground  or
 grounds  asserted  include  one  or  more of the aforesaid paragraphs of
 subdivision one of section 440.10, the court must also  apply  [subdivi-
 sions]  SUBDIVISION  two [and three] of section 440.10, other than para-
 S. 8305--B  179

 graph [(d)] (C) of [subdivision two of] such [section]  SUBDIVISION,  in
 determining  the motion. In the event the court enters an order granting
 a motion to set aside a sentence of death under this section, the  court
 must  either  direct  a  new  sentencing  proceeding  in accordance with
 section 400.27 or, to the extent that the  defendant  cannot  be  resen-
 tenced  to death consistent with the laws of this state or the constitu-
 tion of this state or of the United States, resentence the defendant  to
 life  imprisonment  without  parole or to a sentence of imprisonment for
 the class A-I felony of murder in the first degree other than a sentence
 of life imprisonment without parole. Upon granting the motion  upon  any
 of  the grounds set forth in the aforesaid paragraphs of subdivision one
 of section 440.10 and setting aside the sentence, the court must  afford
 the people a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than ten
 days,  to  determine  whether  to  take an appeal from the order setting
 aside the sentence of death. The taking of an appeal by the people stays
 the effectiveness of that portion of the court's order  that  directs  a
 new sentencing proceeding.
  2.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision one, the court
 [must] MAY deny such a motion when the ground or issue raised  thereupon
 was previously determined on the merits upon an appeal from the judgment
 or sentence, unless since the time of such appellate determination there
 has  been  a  retroactively effective change in the law controlling such
 issue.  HOWEVER, IF ALL OF THE EVIDENCE CURRENTLY BEFORE THE  COURT  WAS
 NOT  DULY  CONSIDERED  PREVIOUSLY BY THE COURT, THE COURT SHALL NOT DENY
 THE MOTION TO VACATE AND INSTEAD SHALL ORDER  A  HEARING  OR  GRANT  THE
 MOTION.  EVEN  IF  THE  COURT HAS ALREADY CONSIDERED ALL OF THE EVIDENCE
 CURRENTLY BEFORE THE COURT, THE COURT IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND FOR
 GOOD CAUSE SHOWN MAY GRANT THE MOTION IF IT IS OTHERWISE MERITORIOUS.
  3.  [Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one, the court  may
 deny  such a motion when the ground or issue raised thereupon was previ-
 ously determined on the merits upon a prior motion or  proceeding  in  a
 court  of  this state, other than an appeal from the judgment, or upon a
 prior motion or proceeding in a federal court, unless since the time  of
 such  determination  there  has been a retroactively effective change in
 the law controlling such issue.  Despite such  determination,  however,
 the  court  in  the interest of justice and for good cause shown, may in
 its discretion grant the motion if it is otherwise meritorious.
  4.]  An order setting aside a sentence pursuant to this  section  does
 not  affect  the  validity  or  status of the underlying conviction, and
 after entering such an order the court must resentence  the  [defendant]
 APPLICANT in accordance with the law.
  §  4. Section 440.30 of the criminal procedure law, subdivisions 1 and
 1-a as amended by chapter 19 of the laws of 2012 and the  opening  para-
 graph of paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 as amended by section 10 of part
 LLL of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
 § 440.30 Motion to vacate judgment and to set aside sentence; procedure.
  1.  [(a)  A]  AN APPLICATION FOR ASSIGNMENT OF COUNSEL FOR A motion to
 vacate a judgment pursuant to section 440.10 OR 440.11 of  this  article
 and  a motion to set aside a sentence pursuant to section 440.20 of this
 article must be made in writing BY A PRO SE APPLICANT TO  THE  JUDGE  OR
 JUSTICE  WHO IMPOSED THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE and upon reasonable notice to
 the people. [Upon the motion, a defendant]
  (A) THE COURT SHALL ASSIGN DEFENSE COUNSEL IN CASES WHERE THERE  IS  A
 COLORABLE  CLAIM OF RELIEF ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO OF THE COUNTY LAW. FOR THE  PURPOSE  OF
 THIS  SECTION,  A  COLORABLE  CLAIM  IS  A  CLAIM THAT, TAKING THE FACTS
 S. 8305--B  180
 
 ALLEGED IN THE APPLICATION AS TRUE AND VIEWED IN A LIGHT MOST  FAVORABLE
 TO THE APPLICANT, WOULD ENTITLE THE APPLICANT TO RELIEF.
  (B)  IF  THE JUDGE DECIDES NOT TO ASSIGN COUNSEL, THEY SHALL STATE THE
 REASONS FOR DENYING THE REQUEST FOR ASSIGNMENT OF COUNSEL IN WRITING.
  (C) IF, AT THE TIME OF SUCH  APPLICANT'S  REQUEST  FOR  ASSIGNMENT  OF
 COUNSEL, THE ORIGINAL SENTENCING JUDGE OR JUSTICE NO LONGER WORKS IN THE
 COURT IN WHICH THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE WAS IMPOSED, THEN THE REQUEST SHALL
 BE  RANDOMLY  ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER JUDGE OR JUSTICE OF THE COURT IN WHICH
 THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE WAS IMPOSED.
  (D) APPLICANTS ALREADY REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, EITHER APPOINTED PURSU-
 ANT TO SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO OF THE COUNTY LAW  OR  OTHERWISE
 RETAINED,  ARE  NOT  REQUIRED  TO  FILE AN APPLICATION FOR ASSIGNMENT OF
 COUNSEL.
  2. UPON THE REQUEST OF THE APPLICANT OR THE APPLICANT'S DEFENSE  COUN-
 SEL, THE COURT SHALL ORDER:
  (A)  THE  PEOPLE  TO  MAKE  AVAILABLE  A COPY OF ITS FILE OF THE CASE,
 INCLUDING ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE IN THE  PEOPLE'S  POSSESSION  AND  GRAND
 JURY MINUTES;
  (B)  THE APPLICANT'S PRIOR TRIAL AND APPELLATE DEFENSE COUNSEL TO MAKE
 AVAILABLE THEIR COMPLETE FILES RELATING TO THE CASE;
  (C) COURT CLERKS AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE COURT
 FILES OR PROBATION RECORDS RELATING TO THE CASE; AND
  (D) ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INVOLVED WITH THE CASE TO TURN OVER ITS
 FILES  OF  THE  CASE,  INCLUDING  POLICE  REPORTS,  WITNESS  STATEMENTS,
 EVIDENCE  VOUCHERS,  OR  ANY  OTHER  RELEVANT RECORDS OR EVIDENCE AT ITS
 DISPOSAL.
  (E) THE COURT SHALL FURTHER ENSURE THAT ANY DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE  OR
 PROPERTY  ORDERED  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SUBDIVISION  MAY  BE SUBJECT TO A
 PROTECTIVE ORDER AS DEFINED IN SECTION 245.70 OF THIS PART, WHERE APPRO-
 PRIATE.
  (F) NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL PRECLUDE THE COURT  FROM  CONDUCTING
 AN  IN  CAMERA  INSPECTION  OF  EVIDENCE  AND ISSUING A PROTECTIVE ORDER
 PURSUANT TO SECTION 245.70 OF THIS PART AT THE  REQUEST  OF  THE  PROSE-
 CUTION OR DEFENSE.
  3. (A) AN APPLICANT who is in a position adequately to raise more than
 one  ground  should  raise  every such ground upon which [he or she] THE
 APPLICANT intends to challenge the judgment or sentence. If  the  motion
 is  based  upon  the existence or occurrence of facts, the motion papers
 [must] MAY contain sworn allegations thereof, whether by the [defendant]
 APPLICANT or by another person or persons. Such sworn allegations may be
 based upon personal knowledge of the affiant  or  upon  information  and
 belief,  provided  that  in  the latter event the affiant must state the
 sources of such information and the grounds of such belief. The [defend-
 ant] APPLICANT may further submit documentary  evidence  or  information
 supporting or tending to support the allegations of the moving papers.
  (B)  The people may file with the court, and in such case must serve a
 copy thereof upon the [defendant] APPLICANT or [his or her]  THE  APPLI-
 CANT'S counsel, if any, an answer denying or admitting any or all of the
 allegations  of  the  motion  papers, and may further submit documentary
 evidence or information refuting or tending to refute such allegations.
  (C) After all papers of both parties have been filed,  and  after  all
 documentary  evidence  or  information,  if any, has been submitted, the
 court must consider the same for the purpose of ascertaining whether the
 motion is determinable without a hearing to resolve questions of fact.
  [(b) In conjunction with the filing or consideration of  a  motion  to
 vacate  a  judgment  pursuant  to  section  440.10  of this article by a
 S. 8305--B  181

 defendant convicted after a trial, in cases where the court has  ordered
 an  evidentiary  hearing  upon such motion, the court may order that the
 people  produce  or  make  available  for  inspection  property  in  its
 possession,  custody, or control that was secured in connection with the
 investigation or prosecution of the defendant upon credible  allegations
 by  the  defendant  and  a  finding  by the court that such property, if
 obtained, would be probative to the determination of defendant's  actual
 innocence,  and  that the request is reasonable. The court shall deny or
 limit such a request upon a finding that such  a  request,  if  granted,
 would  threaten  the  integrity  or  chain of custody of property or the
 integrity of the processes or functions of a laboratory  conducting  DNA
 testing,  pose a risk of harm, intimidation, embarrassment, reprisal, or
 other substantially negative consequences to any person,  undermine  the
 proper  functions  of  law  enforcement including the confidentiality of
 informants, or on the basis of any other factor identified by the  court
 in  the  interests  of justice or public safety. The court shall further
 ensure that any property produced pursuant to this paragraph is  subject
 to  a  protective  order,  where  appropriate.  The court shall deny any
 request made pursuant to this paragraph where:
  (i) (1) the defendant's motion pursuant  to  section  440.10  of  this
 article  does not seek to demonstrate his or her actual innocence of the
 offense or offenses of which he  or  she  was  convicted  that  are  the
 subject  of  the motion, or (2) the defendant has not presented credible
 allegations and the court has not found that such property, if obtained,
 would be probative to the determination of the defendant's actual  inno-
 cence and that the request is reasonable;
  (ii)  the  defendant  has made his or her motion after five years from
 the date of the judgment of conviction;  provided,  however,  that  this
 limitation  period shall be tolled for five years if the defendant is in
 custody in connection with the conviction that is the subject of his  or
 her  motion,  and provided further that, notwithstanding such limitation
 periods, the court may consider the motion if the defendant  has  shown:
 (A)  that  he  or she has been pursuing his or her rights diligently and
 that some extraordinary circumstance prevented the timely filing of  the
 motion;  (B)  that  the  facts  upon which the motion is predicated were
 unknown to the defendant or his or her attorney and could not have  been
 ascertained  by the exercise of due diligence prior to the expiration of
 the statute of limitations; or (C) considering all circumstances of  the
 case including but not limited to evidence of the defendant's guilt, the
 impact  of granting or denying such motion upon public confidence in the
 criminal justice system, or upon the safety or welfare of the community,
 and the defendant's diligence in seeking to obtain the requested proper-
 ty or related relief, the  interests  of  justice  would  be  served  by
 considering the motion;
  (iii) the defendant is challenging a judgment convicting him or her of
 an  offense  that  is not a felony defined in section 10.00 of the penal
 law; or
  (iv) upon a finding by the court that the property requested  in  this
 motion would be available through other means through reasonable efforts
 by the defendant to obtain such property.
  1-a.] 4. (a) [(1)] Where the [defendant's] APPLICANT'S motion requests
 the  performance  of a forensic DNA test on specified evidence, and upon
 the court's determination that any evidence containing  deoxyribonucleic
 acid  ("DNA")  was  secured  in  connection  with  the trial OR THE PLEA
 resulting in the judgment, the court shall  grant  the  application  for
 forensic DNA testing of such evidence upon its determination that [if a]
 S. 8305--B  182
 
 HAD  THE DNA test [had] RESULTS been [conducted on such evidence, and if
 the results had been admitted in the trial resulting in  the  judgment,]
 AVAILABLE  AT  THE TIME OF TRIAL OR PLEA, there [exists] IS a reasonable
 probability  that  the  verdict  would  have  been more favorable to the
 [defendant] APPLICANT.
  [(2) Where the defendant's motion for forensic DNA testing  of  speci-
 fied  evidence  is made following a plea of guilty and entry of judgment
 thereon convicting him or her of: (A)  a  homicide  offense  defined  in
 article one hundred twenty-five of the penal law, any felony sex offense
 defined in article one hundred thirty of the penal law, a violent felony
 offense  as defined in paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 70.02
 of the penal law, or (B) any other felony offense to  which  he  or  she
 pled guilty after being charged in an indictment or information in supe-
 rior court with one or more of the offenses listed in clause (A) of this
 subparagraph, then the court shall grant such a motion upon its determi-
 nation  that  evidence containing DNA was secured in connection with the
 investigation or prosecution of the defendant, and if  a  DNA  test  had
 been  conducted  on  such evidence and the results had been known to the
 parties prior to the entry of the defendant's plea and judgment thereon,
 there exists a substantial probability  that  the  evidence  would  have
 established  the defendant's actual innocence of the offense or offenses
 that are the subject of the defendant's motion; provided, however, that:
  (i) the court shall consider whether the defendant had the opportunity
 to request such testing prior to entering a guilty plea, and,  where  it
 finds  that  the defendant had such opportunity and unjustifiably failed
 to do so, the court may deny such motion; and
  (ii) a court shall deny the defendant's motion for forensic DNA  test-
 ing  where the defendant has made his or her motion more than five years
 after entry of the judgment of conviction; except  that  the  limitation
 period  may be tolled if the defendant has shown: (A) that he or she has
 been pursuing his or her rights diligently and that  some  extraordinary
 circumstance  prevented the timely filing of the motion for forensic DNA
 testing; (B) that the facts upon which the  motion  is  predicated  were
 unknown  to the defendant or his or her attorney and could not have been
 ascertained by the exercise of due diligence prior to the expiration  of
 this statute of limitations; or (C) considering all circumstances of the
 case including but not limited to evidence of the defendant's guilt, the
 impact  of granting or denying such motion upon public confidence in the
 criminal justice system, or upon the safety or welfare of the community,
 and the defendant's diligence in seeking to obtain the requested proper-
 ty or related relief, the interests of justice would be served by  toll-
 ing such limitation period.]
  (b)  WHERE  THE APPLICANT'S MOTION FOR RELIEF REQUESTS THE PERFORMANCE
 OF ANY OTHER TESTING OF  FORENSIC  EVIDENCE  OR  ANY  PHYSICAL  EVIDENCE
 SECURED  IN  THE CASE, THE COURT SHALL GRANT THE APPLICATION FOR TESTING
 OF SUCH EVIDENCE, UPON ITS DETERMINATION THAT HAD THE RESULTS OF TESTING
 OF FORENSIC OR OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE BEEN AVAILABLE  AT  THE  TIME  OF
 TRIAL  OR PLEA, THERE IS A REASONABLE PROBABILITY THAT THE VERDICT WOULD
 HAVE BEEN MORE FAVORABLE TO THE APPLICANT.
  (C) (I) In conjunction with the filing of a motion under this subdivi-
 sion, the court may direct the people to provide the [defendant]  APPLI-
 CANT  AND  THE APPLICANT'S COUNSEL with information in the possession of
 the people concerning the current physical  location  of  the  specified
 evidence  and if the specified evidence no longer exists or the physical
 location of the specified evidence is unknown, a representation to  that
 effect and information and documentary evidence in the possession of the
 S. 8305--B  183
 
 people  concerning  the  last  known physical location of such specified
 evidence.
  (II) If there is a finding by the court that the specified evidence no
 longer  exists  or  the  physical location of such specified evidence is
 unknown, [such information in and of itself shall not be a  factor  from
 which  any inference unfavorable to the people may be drawn by the court
 in deciding a motion under this section] THE COURT MAY GRANT THE  APPLI-
 CANT'S  MOTION  AND VACATE THE JUDGMENT UPON A FINDING BY THE COURT THAT
 SUCH EVIDENCE IS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO MALFEASANCE OR NEGLECT.
  (III) The court, on motion of  the  [defendant]  APPLICANT,  may  also
 issue  a  subpoena  duces  tecum directing a public or private hospital,
 laboratory or other entity to produce such  specified  evidence  in  its
 possession and/or information and documentary evidence in its possession
 concerning the location and status of such specified evidence.
  [(c)] (D) In response to a motion under this paragraph, upon notice to
 the  parties  and to the entity required to perform the search the court
 may order an entity that has access to the  combined  DNA  index  system
 ("CODIS") or its successor system to compare a DNA profile obtained from
 probative  biological  material gathered in connection with the investi-
 gation or prosecution of the [defendant] APPLICANT against DNA databanks
 by keyboard searches, or a similar method that does not involve  upload-
 ing,  upon  a  court's determination that (1) such profile complies with
 federal bureau of investigation or  state  requirements,  whichever  are
 applicable and as such requirements are applied to law enforcement agen-
 cies  seeking  such a comparison, and that the data meet state DNA index
 system and/or national DNA index system criteria as  such  criteria  are
 applied to law enforcement agencies seeking such a comparison and (2) if
 such  comparison had been conducted, [and if the results had been admit-
 ted in the trial resulting in the judgment,]  a  reasonable  probability
 exists  that  the verdict would have been more favorable to the [defend-
 ant, or in a case involving a plea of guilty, if the  results  had  been
 available  to  the defendant prior to the plea, a reasonable probability
 exists that the conviction would not  have  resulted]  APPLICANT.  For
 purposes of this subdivision, a "keyboard search" shall mean a search of
 a DNA profile against the databank in which the profile that is searched
 is not uploaded to or maintained in the databank.
  [2.  If  it  appears  by conceded or uncontradicted allegations of the
 moving papers or of the answer, or by unquestionable documentary  proof,
 that  there  are  circumstances which require denial thereof pursuant to
 subdivision two of section 440.10 or subdivision two of section  440.20,
 the  court  must summarily deny the motion. If it appears that there are
 circumstances authorizing, though not requiring, denial thereof pursuant
 to subdivision three of section 440.10 or subdivision three  of  section
 440.20,  the  court  may in its discretion either (a) summarily deny the
 motion, or (b) proceed to consider the merits thereof.]
  [3.] 5. Upon considering the merits of  the  motion,  the  court  must
 grant  it  without  conducting  a hearing and vacate the judgment or set
 aside the sentence, as the case may be, if:
  (a) The moving papers allege a ground constituting legal basis for the
 motion; and
  (b) Such ground, if based upon the existence or occurrence  of  facts,
 is supported by sworn allegations thereof; and
  (c)  The sworn allegations of fact essential to support the motion are
 either conceded by the people to be true or are conclusively  substanti-
 ated by unquestionable documentary proof.
 S. 8305--B  184
 
  [4.]  6. Upon considering the merits of the motion, the court may deny
 it without conducting a hearing if:
  (a)  The  moving  papers  do  not allege any ground constituting legal
 basis for the motion; or
  (b) [The motion is based upon the existence or occurrence of facts and
 the moving papers do not contain  sworn  allegations  substantiating  or
 tending to substantiate all the essential facts, as required by subdivi-
 sion one; or
  (c)]  An allegation of fact essential to support the motion is conclu-
 sively refuted by unquestionable documentary proof; or
  [(d)] (C) An allegation of fact essential to support the motion (i) is
 contradicted by a court record or other official document[, or  is  made
 solely  by  the  defendant  and is unsupported by any other affidavit or
 evidence,] and (ii) under these and all the other circumstances  attend-
 ing the case, there is no reasonable possibility that such allegation is
 true.
  [5.] 7. If the court does not determine the motion pursuant to [subdi-
 visions  two,  three or four] SUBDIVISION FIVE OR SIX, it must conduct a
 hearing and make findings of fact essential to the determination  there-
 of.  The [defendant] APPLICANT has a right to be present at such hearing
 but may waive such right in writing. If [he] THE APPLICANT does  not  so
 waive  it  and  if  [he]  THE APPLICANT is confined in a prison or other
 institution of this state, the court must cause [him] THE  APPLICANT  to
 be produced at such hearing.
  [6.] 8. At such a hearing, the [defendant] APPLICANT has the burden of
 proving  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence every fact essential to
 support the motion. AT THE HEARING, EITHER PARTY SHALL RECEIVE  A  DAILY
 COPY OF THE HEARING MINUTES, UPON REQUEST.
  [7.]  9. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS SECTION, WHEN THE
 APPLICANT RAISES A COLORABLE CLAIM OF RELIEF PURSUANT TO  THIS  ARTICLE,
 THE  COURT  SHALL  NOT  SUMMARILY DENY THE MOTION ON THE GROUND THAT THE
 APPLICANT PREVIOUSLY MOVED FOR RELIEF UNDER THIS ARTICLE.
  10. Regardless of whether a hearing was  conducted,  the  court,  upon
 determining  the  motion,  must  set forth on the record its findings of
 fact, its conclusions of law and the reasons for its determination.

 other jurisdiction, of a decedent [who is survived by distributees]  may
 maintain  an  action  to  recover damages for a wrongful act, neglect or
 default which caused the decedent's death against  a  person  who  would
 have  been  liable to the decedent by reason of such wrongful conduct if
 death had not ensued. Such an action  must  be  commenced  within  [two]
 THREE  years  after  the  decedent's  death[; provided, however, that an
 action on behalf of a decedent whose death was caused by  the  terrorist

 S. 8305--B  190

 identified by the attorney general of the United States as a participant
 or conspirator in such attacks, must be commenced within two  years  and
 six  months after the decedent's death]. When the [distributees] PERSONS
 FOR  WHOSE BENEFIT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO THIS PART MAY BE BROUGHT do not
 participate in the administration of the decedent's estate under a  will
 appointing  an executor who refuses to bring such action, the [distribu-
 tees] PERSONS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO THIS PART  MAY  BE
 BROUGHT are entitled to have an administrator appointed to prosecute the
 action for their benefit.
  §  2. Paragraph (a) of section 5-4.3 of the estates, powers and trusts
 law, as amended by chapter 100 of the laws of 1982, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  (a)  The  damages awarded to the plaintiff may be such sum as the jury
 or, where issues of fact are tried without a jury, the court or  referee
 deems  to  be  fair  and  just compensation for the [pecuniary] injuries
 resulting from the decedent's death to the persons for whose benefit the
 action is brought. In every such action, in addition to any other lawful
 element of recoverable damages, [the reasonable expenses of medical aid,
 nursing and attention incident to  the  injury  causing  death  and  the
 reasonable funeral expenses of the decedent paid by the distributees, or
 for  the  payment of which any distributee is responsible, shall also be
 proper elements of damage]  COMPENSATION FOR THE FOLLOWING  DAMAGES  MAY
 BE  RECOVERED:  (I) REASONABLE FUNERAL EXPENSES OF THE DECEDENT PAID BY
 THE PERSONS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT THE ACTION IS BROUGHT, OR FOR THE  PAYMENT
 OF  WHICH ANY PERSONS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT THE ACTION IS BROUGHT IS RESPON-
 SIBLE; (II) REASONABLE EXPENSES FOR MEDICAL CARE INCIDENT TO THE  INJURY
 CAUSING  DEATH, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DOCTORS, NURSING, ATTENDANT
 CARE, TREATMENT, HOSPITALIZATION OF THE DECEDENT, AND  MEDICINES;  (III)
 GRIEF  OR  ANGUISH  CAUSED  BY  THE DECEDENT'S DEATH; (IV) LOSS OF LOVE,
 SOCIETY, PROTECTION, COMFORT, COMPANIONSHIP,  AND  CONSORTIUM  RESULTING
 FROM  THE  DECEDENT'S  DEATH;  (V) PECUNIARY INJURIES, INCLUDING LOSS OF
 SERVICES, SUPPORT, ASSISTANCE, AND LOSS OR DIMINISHMENT OF  INHERITANCE,
 RESULTING FROM THE DECEDENT'S DEATH; AND (VI) LOSS OF NURTURE, GUIDANCE,

 DEATH.  Interest upon the principal sum recovered by the plaintiff  from
 the  date of the decedent's death shall be added to and be a part of the
 total sum awarded.

 (a) as amended by chapter 357 of the laws of 1975, and the opening para-
 graph of paragraph (a) as amended by chapter 595 of the laws of 1992, is
 amended to read as follows:
 § 5-4.4 Distribution of damages recovered
  (a)  The  damages,  as  prescribed  by  5-4.3, whether recovered in an
 action or by settlement without an action, are exclusively for the bene-
 fit of the  decedent's  [distributees  and,  when  collected,  shall  be
 distributed  to  the  persons  entitled  thereto  under 4-1.1 and 5-4.5,
 except that where the decedent is survived by a parent or parents and  a
 spouse  and no issue, the parent or parents will be deemed to be distri-
 butees for purposes of this section]  SURVIVING  CLOSE  FAMILY  MEMBERS,
 WHICH  SHALL BE LIMITED TO DECEDENT'S SPOUSE OR DOMESTIC PARTNER, ISSUE,
 FOSTER-CHILDREN, STEP-CHILDREN, AND STEP-GRANDCHILDREN, PARENTS,  GRAND-
 PARENTS,  STEP-PARENTS, STEP-GRANDPARENTS, SIBLINGS OR ANY PERSON STAND-
 ING IN LOCO PARENTIS TO THE DECEDENT. THE FINDER OF FACT SHALL DETERMINE
 WHICH PERSONS ARE ENTITLED TO DAMAGES AS CLOSE  FAMILY  MEMBERS  OF  THE
 DECEDENT UNDER THIS SECTION BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES RELAT-
 S. 8305--B  191
 
 ING  TO  THE PERSON'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DECEDENT.  The damages shall
 be distributed subject to the following:
  (1)  Such damages shall be distributed by the personal representative
 to the persons entitled thereto in proportion to the  [pecuniary]  inju-
 ries  suffered  by them, such proportions to be determined after a hear-
 ing, on application of the personal representative or any  [distributee]
 PERSONS  FOR  WHOSE  BENEFIT  THE ACTION IS BROUGHT, at such time and on
 notice to all interested persons in such manner as the court may direct.
 If no action is brought, such determination shall be made by the  surro-
 gate  of the county in which letters were issued to the plaintiff; if an
 action is brought, by the court having jurisdiction of the action or  by
 the surrogate of the county in which letters were issued.
  (2)  The  court  which determines the proportions of the [pecuniary]
 injuries suffered by the [distributees] PERSONS FOR  WHOSE  BENEFIT  THE
 ACTION  IS  BROUGHT,  as provided in subparagraph (1) OF THIS PARAGRAPH,
 shall also decide any question  concerning  the  disqualification  of  a
 parent,  under 4-1.4 OF THIS CHAPTER, or a surviving spouse, under 5-1.2
 OF THIS ARTICLE, to share in the damages recovered.
  (b)  The reasonable expenses of the  action  or  settlement  and,  if
 included  in  the  damages recovered, the reasonable expenses of medical
 aid, nursing and attention incident to the injury causing death and  the
 reasonable  funeral  expenses  of the decedent may be fixed by the court
 which determines the proportions of the [pecuniary] injuries suffered by
 the [distributees] PERSONS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT THE ACTION IS  BROUGHT,  as
 provided  in  subparagraph  (1)  OF THIS PARAGRAPH, upon notice given in
 such manner and to such persons  as  the  court  may  direct,  and  such
 expenses may be deducted from the damages recovered.  The commissions of
 the  personal representative upon the residue may be fixed by the surro-
 gate, upon notice given in such manner and to such persons as the surro-
 gate may direct or upon the judicial settlement of the  account  of  the
 personal  representative,  and such commissions may be deducted from the
 damages recovered.
  (c)  In the event that an action is brought,  as  authorized  in  this
 part, and there is no recovery or settlement, the reasonable expenses of
 such  unsuccessful  action, excluding counsel fees, shall be payable out
 of the assets of the decedent's estate.
  (D) FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS  SECTION,  THE  TERM  "DOMESTIC  PARTNER"
 SHALL  HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS DEFINED PURSUANT TO SECTION TWO THOUSAND
 NINE HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW.
  § 4. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 5-4.6 of  the  estates,  powers
 and  trusts  law, paragraph (a) as amended and paragraph (b) as added by
 chapter 719 of the laws of 2005, are amended to read as follows:
  (a) Within sixty days of the application of an administrator appointed
 under SECTION 5-4.1 OF THIS PART or a  personal  representative  to  the
 court  in  which  an action for wrongful act, neglect or default causing
 the death of a decedent is pending, the court shall, after inquiry  into
 the merits of the action and the amount of damages proposed as a compro-
 mise  either  disapprove the application or approve in writing a compro-
 mise for such amount as it shall  determine  to  be  adequate  including
 approval  of  attorneys  fees  and  other  payable expenses as set forth
 below, and shall order the defendant to pay all sums payable  under  the
 order  of  compromise,  within the time frames set forth in section five
 thousand three-a of the civil practice law and rules,  to  the  attorney
 for  the  administrator  or  personal representative for placement in an
 interest bearing escrow account for the benefit  of  the  [distributees]
 S. 8305--B  192

 PERSONS  FOR  WHOSE BENEFIT THE ACTION IS BROUGHT.  The order shall also
 provide for the following:
  (1)  Upon collection of the settlement funds and creation of an inter-
 est bearing escrow  account,  the  attorney  for  the  administrator  or
 personal  representative  shall pay from the account all due and payable

 disbursements, shall be immediately payable from the escrow account upon
 submission  to  the  trial court proof of filing of a petition for allo-
 cation and distribution in  the  surrogate's  court  on  behalf  of  the

 the action for wrongful act, neglect or  default  who  receives  payment

 until the entry of a final decree in the surrogate's court.
  (b) If any of the [distributees] PERSONS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT THE  ACTION
 IS  BROUGHT  is  an  infant,  incompetent, person who is incarcerated or
 person under disability, the court shall determine whether a guardian ad
 litem is required before any payments are made, in which case the  court
 will  seek an immediate appointment of a guardian ad litem by the surro-
 gate's court or, if the surrogate's court defers, the court  shall  make
 such appointment. Any guardian appointed for this purpose shall continue
 to  serve as the guardian ad litem for the person requiring same for all
 other purposes.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  apply  to  all
 causes  of  action  that  accrue on or after July 1, 2018, regardless of
 when filed.

 the  amount  of  mandatory  surcharge,  crime victim assistance fee, and
 supplemental sex offender victim fee collected and, if it is an adminis-
 trative tribunal, or a town or village justice court, it shall then  pay
 such  money to the state comptroller who shall deposit such money in the

 based upon a conviction that is subsequently  reversed  or  who  paid  a
 mandatory  surcharge, sex offender registration fee, DNA databank fee, a
 crime  victim  assistance  fee  or  supplemental sex offender victim fee

 to  be  required  by  this section shall be entitled to a refund of such
 mandatory surcharge, sex offender registration fee,  DNA  databank  fee,
 crime victim assistance fee or supplemental sex offender victim fee upon
 application,  in the case of a town or village court, to the state comp-
 troller. The state comptroller shall require such proof as is  necessary
 in  order to determine whether a refund is required by law. In all other
 cases, such application shall be made to the department, agency or court
 that collected such surcharge or fee. Such department, agency  or  court
 shall  initiate  the  refund process and the state comptroller shall pay
 the refund pursuant to subdivision fifteen of section eight of the state

 victim assistance fee or supplemental sex offender victim  fee  required
 by  this  section,  the  clerk of the court that rendered the conviction
 shall notify the superintendent or the municipal official of the facili-
 ty where the person is confined. The  superintendent  or  the  municipal
 official  shall  cause any amount owing to be collected from such person
 during his or her term of imprisonment from moneys to the credit  of  an
 incarcerated  individuals'  fund  or  such  moneys as may be earned by a
 person in a work release program pursuant to section eight hundred sixty
 of the correction law. Such moneys attributable to the mandatory  FELONY
 surcharge or crime victim assistance fee shall be paid over to the state
 comptroller  to  the  credit of the criminal justice improvement account
 established by section ninety-seven-bb of the state finance law and such
 moneys attributable to the sex offender registration fee or DNA databank
 fee shall be paid over to the state comptroller to  the  credit  of  the
 general  fund,  except  that  any  such  moneys  collected  which  are
 surcharges, sex offender registration fees,  DNA  databank  fees,  crime
 victim  assistance  fees or supplemental sex offender victim fees levied
 in relation to convictions obtained in a town or village  justice  court
 shall be paid within thirty days after the receipt thereof by the super-
 intendent  or  municipal  official of the facility to the justice of the
 court in which the conviction was obtained. For the purposes of collect-
 ing such mandatory FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee,  DNA
 databank  fee, crime victim assistance fee and supplemental sex offender
 victim fee, the state shall be legally entitled  to  the  money  to  the
 credit  of an incarcerated individuals' fund or money which is earned by
 an incarcerated individual in a work release program.  For  purposes  of
 this  subdivision,  the term "incarcerated individuals' fund" shall mean
 moneys in the possession of an incarcerated individual at  the  time  of
 his  or  her admission into such facility, funds earned by him or her as
 provided for in section one hundred eighty-seven of the  correction  law
 and  any  other funds received by him or her or on his or her behalf and
 deposited with such superintendent or municipal official.
  6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where a person
 has made restitution or reparation pursuant to  section  60.27  of  this
 article,  such  person  shall  not be required to pay a mandatory FELONY
 surcharge or a crime victim assistance fee.
 S. 8305--B  196
 
  7. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of section  60.00
 of this article, the provisions of subdivision one of this section shall
 not apply to a violation under any law other than this chapter.

 notwithstanding, at the time that [the] A  mandatory  FELONY  surcharge,
 sex  offender registration fee or DNA databank fee, crime victim assist-
 ance fee or supplemental sex offender victim fee is imposed  a  town  or
 village  court  may,  and  all other courts shall, issue and cause to be

 victim assistance fee or supplemental sex offender victim fee, a summons
 directing that such person appear before the court regarding the payment
 of [the] A mandatory FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee  or
 DNA databank fee, crime victim assistance fee or supplemental sex offen-
 der  victim  fee,  if  after  sixty days from the date it was imposed it
 remains unpaid. The designated date of appearance on the  summons  shall
 be  set for the first day court is in session falling after the sixtieth
 day from the imposition of  [the]  A  mandatory  FELONY  surcharge,  sex
 offender  registration  fee or DNA databank fee, crime victim assistance
 fee or supplemental sex offender victim fee. The summons  shall  contain
 the  information  required  by  subdivision two of section 130.10 of the
 criminal procedure law except that in substitution for  the  requirement
 of  paragraph  (c)  of such subdivision the summons shall state that the
 person served must appear at a date, time and specific  location  speci-

 agraph (i) of this paragraph as soon thereafter as is practicable.

 determine  whether  he or she should be paroled at the expiration of the
 minimum period or periods in  accordance  with  the  procedures  adopted
 pursuant to subdivision four of section two hundred fifty-nine-c of this
 article.  If  parole  is  not granted upon such review, the incarcerated
 individual shall be informed in writing within two weeks of such appear-
 ance of the factors and reasons for such denial of parole. Such  reasons
 shall  be  given  in detail and not in conclusory terms. The board shall
 specify a date not more than twenty-four months from such  determination

 tions shall where appropriate, include a requirement  that  the  parolee
 comply  with any restitution order and mandatory FELONY surcharge previ-
 ously imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction that applies  to  the
 parolee.  The  conditions  shall  indicate  which restitution collection
 agency established under subdivision eight  of  section  420.10  of  the
 criminal  procedure law, shall be responsible for collection of restitu-
 tion and mandatory FELONY surcharge as provided for in section 60.35  of
 the penal law and section eighteen hundred nine of the vehicle and traf-
 fic  law.  If  the  incarcerated individual is released, he or she shall

 law, as amended by chapter 491 of the laws of 2021, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
 S. 8305--B  201
 
  (a)  A  merit termination granted by the department under this section
 shall constitute a termination of the sentence with respect to which  it
 was  granted.  No  such  merit  termination  shall be granted unless the
 department is satisfied that termination of  sentence  from  presumptive
 release,  parole,  conditional release or post-release supervision is in
 the best interest of society, and that the parolee or  releasee,  other-
 wise  financially  able  to  comply with an order of restitution and the
 payment of any mandatory FELONY surcharge previously imposed by a  court
 of competent jurisdiction, has made a good faith effort to comply there-
 with.
  §  7.  Subdivisions  1 and 3 of section 259-j of the executive law, as
 amended by section 38-g of subpart A of part C of chapter 62 of the laws
 of 2011, are amended to read as follows:
  1. Except where a determinate sentence was imposed for a felony  other
 than  a  felony  defined  in  article two hundred twenty [or article two
 hundred twenty-one] of the penal law, if the board of parole  is  satis-
 fied that an absolute discharge from presumptive release, parole, condi-
 tional  release or release to a period of post-release supervision is in
 the best interests of society, the board  may  grant  such  a  discharge
 prior  to  the expiration of the full term or maximum term to any person
 who has been on unrevoked  community  supervision  for  at  least  three
 consecutive  years. A discharge granted under this section shall consti-
 tute a termination of the sentence with respect to which it was granted.
 No such discharge shall be granted unless the board  is  satisfied  that
 the  parolee  or  releasee, otherwise financially able to comply with an
 order of restitution and the payment of any mandatory FELONY  surcharge,
 sex  offender registration fee or DNA databank fee previously imposed by
 a court of competent jurisdiction, has  made  a  good  faith  effort  to
 comply therewith.
  3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contra-
 ry, where a term of post-release supervision in excess of five years has
 been imposed on a person convicted of a crime  defined  in  article  one
 hundred  thirty of the penal law, including a sexually motivated felony,
 the board of parole may grant a discharge from post-release  supervision
 prior to the expiration of the maximum term of post-release supervision.
 Such  a  discharge  may  be  granted only after the person has served at
 least five years of post-release supervision, and only to a  person  who
 has  been  on  unrevoked  post-release  supervision  for  at least three
 consecutive years. No such discharge shall be granted unless  the  board
 of  parole or the department acting pursuant to its responsibility under
 subdivision one of  section  two  hundred  one  of  the  correction  law
 consults  with  any  licensed  psychologist,  qualified psychiatrist, or
 other mental health professional who is providing care or  treatment  to
 the  supervisee;  and  the  board:  (a) determines that a discharge from
 post-release supervision is in the best interests of society; and (b) is
 satisfied that the supervisee, otherwise financially able to comply with
 an order  of  restitution  and  the  payment  of  any  mandatory  FELONY
 surcharge, sex offender registration fee, or DNA data bank fee previous-
 ly  imposed  by a court of competent jurisdiction, has made a good faith
 effort to comply therewith. Before making a determination to discharge a
 person from a period of post-release supervision, the  board  of  parole
 may request that the commissioner of the office of mental health arrange
 a  psychiatric  evaluation  of the supervisee. A discharge granted under
 this section shall constitute a termination of the sentence with respect
 to which it was granted.

  (i)  When a license issued pursuant to this article, or a privilege of

 privilege. In no event may the aggregate of the fees imposed by an indi-
 vidual court pursuant to this  paragraph  for  the  termination  of  all
 suspensions  that  may  be terminated as a result of a person's answers,
 appearances or payments made in such cases pending before such  individ-

 form and manner prescribed by the commissioner including, but not limit-
 ed  to, the parking tickets issued, the dispositions of such tickets and
 the  amount  of  fines,  penalties  and  mandatory  FELONY  surcharges

 each  such  county  or  city, by April first, two thousand[, which shall
 consist of moneys granted to such county or  city  pursuant  to  section
 eighteen  hundred  nine-b of this chapter]. No provision of law shall be
 deemed to preclude a county or the city of New York from receiving funds
 from other sources to be deposited in the handicapped parking  education
 fund, provided such funds are used in a manner and for purposes consist-
 ent  with  this  section.  The moneys of such fund shall be disbursed to
 provide education, advocacy and increased awareness of handicapped park-
 ing laws and may be used to execute contracts with private organizations
 for such purposes. Such contracts shall be awarded upon competitive bids

 as amended by chapter 696 of the laws of 1990, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  20-a. If a vehicle or combination of vehicles is operated in violation
 of  this  section,  an appearance ticket or summons may be issued to the
 registrant of the vehicle, or if  a  combination  of  vehicles,  to  the
 registrant of the hauling vehicle rather than the operator. In the event
 the  vehicle  is  operated  by  a  person other than the registrant, any
 appearance ticket or summons issued to the registrant  shall  be  served
 upon  the  operator, who shall be deemed the agent of the registrant for
 the purpose of receiving such appearance ticket or summons. Such  opera-
 tor-agent shall transmit such ticket or summons to the registrant of the
 vehicle or the hauling vehicle. If the registrant does not appear on the
 return date, a notice establishing a new return date and either contain-
 ing  all pertinent information relating to the charge which is contained
 on the summons or appearance ticket or accompanied  by  a  copy  of  the
 information or complaint shall also be mailed by certified or registered
 mail by or on behalf of the court or administrative tribunal before whom
 the  appearance ticket or summons is returnable to the registrant at the
 address given on the registration certificate for the vehicle, or if  no
 registration  certificate  is produced at the time the appearance ticket
 or summons is issued, to the address of the registrant on file with  the
 department  or  given  to  the  person  issuing the appearance ticket or
 summons. [Whenever proceedings in a court or administrative tribunal  of
 this  state  result in a conviction for a violation of this section, and
 S. 8305--B  204

 the court or administrative tribunal  has  made  the  mailing  specified
 herein,  the  court  or  administrative  tribunal shall levy a mandatory
 surcharge, in addition to any sentence or other  surcharge  required  or
 permitted  by  law,  in  the  amount of thirty dollars.  This mandatory
 surcharge shall be paid to the clerk  of  the  court  or  administrative
 tribunal  that rendered the conviction. Within the first ten days of the
 month following collection of the  mandatory  surcharge  by  a  town  or
 village  court,  the court shall pay such money to the state comptroller
 who shall, pursuant to subdivision two of section ninety-nine-a  of  the
 state  finance  law,  credit  such  money  to the account of the town or
 village which sent the mandatory surcharge. If such collecting authority
 is any other court of the unified system or administrative  tribunal  it
 shall,  within  such period, pay such money to the state comptroller who
 shall deposit such money into the state  treasury.]  The  provisions  of
 this subdivision shall not apply to owner-operators of any motor vehicle
 or  to any motor vehicle or trailer which is registered in the name of a
 person whose principal business is the lease or rental of motor vehicles
 or trailers unless the motor vehicle or trailer is being operated by  an
 employee of the registrant or for a community of interest other than the

  § 15. Subdivision 19-a of section 401 of the vehicle and traffic  law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  696 of the laws of 1990, is amended to read as
 follows:
  19-a. If a vehicle or combination of vehicles is operated in violation
 of this section, an appearance ticket or summons may be  issued  to  the
 registrant  of  the  vehicle,  or  if  a combination of vehicles, to the
 registrant of the hauling vehicle rather than the operator. In the event
 the vehicle is operated by a  person  other  than  the  registrant,  any
 appearance  ticket  or  summons issued to the registrant shall be served
 upon the operator, who shall be deemed the agent of the  registrant  for
 the  purpose of receiving such appearance ticket or summons. Such opera-
 tor-agent shall transmit such ticket or summons to the registrant of the
 vehicle or the hauling vehicle. If the registrant does not appear on the
 return date, a notice establishing a new return date and either contain-
 ing all pertinent information relating to the charge which is  contained
 on  the  summons  or  appearance  ticket or accompanied by a copy of the
 information or complaint shall also be mailed by certified or registered
 mail by or on behalf of the court or administrative tribunal before whom
 the appearance ticket or summons is returnable to the registrant at  the
 address  given on the registration certificate for the vehicle, or if no
 registration certificate is produced at the time the  appearance  ticket
 or  summons is issued, to the address of the registrant on file with the
 department or given to the  person  issuing  the  appearance  ticket  or
 summons.  [Whenever proceedings in a court or administrative tribunal of
 this state result in a conviction for a violation of this  section,  and
 the  court  or  administrative  tribunal  has made the mailing specified
 herein, the court or administrative  tribunal  shall  levy  a  mandatory
 surcharge,  in  addition  to any sentence or other surcharge required or
 permitted by law, in the amount  of  thirty  dollars.  This  mandatory
 surcharge  shall  be  paid  to  the clerk of the court or administrative
 tribunal that rendered the conviction. Within the first ten days of  the
 month  following  collection  of  the  mandatory  surcharge by a town or
 village court, the court shall pay such money to the  state  comptroller
 who  shall,  pursuant to subdivision two of section ninety-nine-a of the
 state finance law, credit such money to  the  account  of  the  town  or
 S. 8305--B  205

 village which sent the mandatory surcharge. If such collecting authority
 is  any  other court of the unified system or administrative tribunal it
 shall, within such period, pay such money to the state  comptroller  who
 shall  deposit  such  money  into the state treasury.] The provisions of
 this subdivision shall not apply to owner-operators of any motor vehicle
 or to any motor vehicle or trailer which is registered in the name of  a
 person whose principal business is the lease or rental of motor vehicles
 or  trailers unless the motor vehicle or trailer is being operated by an
 employee of the registrant or for a community of interest other than the
 lease or rental agreement between the parties to  the  lease  or  rental
 agreement.

  § 18. Subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of section 420.35 of the criminal proce-
 dure  law,  subdivisions  1  and  3 as amended by section 7 of part F of
 chapter 62 of the laws of 2003 and subdivision 2 as amended  by  chapter
 23 of the laws of 2021, are amended to read as follows:
  1.  The  provisions  of  section  420.10 of this article governing the
 collection of fines and the provisions of section 420.40 of this article
 governing deferral of mandatory FELONY surcharges, sex  offender  regis-
 tration  fees, DNA databank fees and financial hardship hearings and the
 provisions of section 430.20 of this chapter governing the commitment of
 a defendant for failure to pay a fine shall be applicable to a mandatory
 FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee, DNA databank fee and  a
 crime  victim  assistance  fee  imposed  pursuant  to subdivision one of
 section 60.35 of the penal law, subdivision twenty-a  of  section  three
 hundred  eighty-five  of  the vehicle and traffic law, subdivision nine-
 teen-a of section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law, or  a
 mandatory  FELONY surcharge imposed pursuant to section eighteen hundred
 nine of the vehicle and traffic law  or  section  27.12  of  the  parks,
 recreation  and  historic  preservation law. When the court directs that
 the defendant be imprisoned until the mandatory  FELONY  surcharge,  sex
 offender  registration  fee  or  DNA  databank fee is satisfied, it must
 specify a maximum period of imprisonment not  to  exceed  fifteen  days;
 provided, however, a court may not direct that a defendant be imprisoned
 until  the mandatory FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee, or
 DNA databank fee is satisfied or otherwise for failure to pay the manda-
 tory FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee or DNA databank fee
 unless the court makes a contemporaneous finding on  the  record,  after
 according  defendant  notice  and  an  opportunity to be heard, that the
 payment of the mandatory FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee
 or DNA databank fee upon defendant will not work an  unreasonable  hard-
 ship upon him or her or his or her immediate family.
  2. Except as provided in this subdivision or subdivision two-a of this
 section,  under  no  circumstances shall the mandatory FELONY surcharge,
 sex offender registration fee, DNA databank  fee  or  the  crime  victim
 assistance  fee  be  waived.  A  court  shall waive any mandatory FELONY
 surcharge, DNA databank fee and crime victim assistance  fee  when:  (i)
 the  defendant  is convicted of prostitution under section 230.00 of the
 penal law; (ii) the defendant is convicted of a violation in  the  event
 such  conviction  is in lieu of a plea to or conviction for prostitution
 under section 230.00 of the penal law; (iii)  the  court  finds  that  a
 defendant  is  a  victim  of sex trafficking under section 230.34 of the
 penal law or a victim of trafficking in persons  under  the  trafficking
 victims  protection  act  (United States Code, Title 22, Chapter 78); or

 nal to report to the division of criminal justice services on the dispo-
 sition and collection  of  mandatory  FELONY  surcharges,  sex  offender
 registration fees or DNA databank fees and crime victim assistance fees.
 Such  report  shall include, for all cases, whether the MANDATORY FELONY
 surcharge, sex offender registration fee,  DNA  databank  fee  or  crime
 victim  assistance  fee  levied  pursuant  to subdivision one of section
 60.35 of the penal law or section eighteen hundred nine of  the  vehicle
 and traffic law has been imposed pursuant to law, collected, or is to be
 collected  by  probation  or  corrections  or other officials. The form,
 manner and frequency of such reports shall be determined by the  commis-
 sioner  of  the division of criminal justice services after consultation
 with the chief administrator of the courts and the commissioner  of  the
 department of motor vehicles.
  §  19.  Subdivisions  1,  2, 4 and 5 of section 420.40 of the criminal
 procedure law, as amended by section 8 of part F of chapter  62  of  the
 laws of 2003, are amended to read as follows:
  1.  Applicability. The procedure specified in this section governs the
 deferral of the obligation to pay all or  part  of  a  mandatory  FELONY
 surcharge,  sex  offender  registration  fee or DNA databank fee imposed
 pursuant to subdivision one of section 60.35 of the penal law and finan-
 cial hardship hearings relating to mandatory FELONY surcharges.
  2. On an appearance date set forth in a  summons  issued  pursuant  to
 subdivision  three  of  section 60.35 of the penal law, section eighteen
 hundred nine of the vehicle and traffic law  or  section  27.12  of  the
 parks,  recreation  and  historic preservation law, a person upon whom a
 mandatory FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee or  DNA  data-
 bank  fee  was levied shall have an opportunity to present on the record
 credible and verifiable  information  establishing  that  the  mandatory
 FELONY  surcharge,  sex  offender  registration  fee or DNA databank fee
 should be deferred, in whole or in part, because, due to  the  indigence
 of  such person the payment of said surcharge, sex offender registration
 fee or DNA databank fee would  work  an  unreasonable  hardship  on  the
 person or his or her immediate family.
  4. Where a court determines that it will defer part or all of a manda-
 tory FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee or DNA databank fee
 imposed pursuant to subdivision one of section 60.35 of the penal law, a
 statement  of such finding and of the facts upon which it is based shall
 be made part of the record.
  5. A court which defers a person's obligation to pay a mandatory FELO-
 NY surcharge, sex offender registration fee or DNA databank fee  imposed
 pursuant  to  subdivision one of section 60.35 of the penal law shall do
 so in a written order. Such order shall not excuse the person  from  the
 obligation  to  pay  the surcharge, sex offender registration fee or DNA
 databank fee. Rather, the court's order shall direct  the  filing  of  a
 certified copy of the order with the county clerk of the county in which
 the  court  is situate except where the court which issues such order is
 the supreme court in which case the order itself shall be filed  by  the
 clerk  of the court acting in his or her capacity as the county clerk of
 the county in which the court is situate. Such order shall be entered by
 the county clerk in the same manner as a judgment in a civil  action  in
 accordance  with  subdivision  (a)  of rule five thousand sixteen of the
 civil practice law and rules. The order shall  direct  that  any  unpaid
 balance of the mandatory FELONY surcharge, sex offender registration fee
 S. 8305--B  208
 
 or DNA databank fee may be collected in the same manner as a civil judg-
 ment.  The entered order shall be deemed to constitute a judgment-roll
 as defined in [section] RULE five thousand seventeen of the civil  prac-
 tice  law and rules and immediately after entry of the order, the county
 clerk shall docket the entered order as a  money  judgment  pursuant  to
 section five thousand eighteen of such law and rules.
  §  20.  Section 26 of the correction law, as amended by chapter 322 of
 the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  § 26. Establishment of commissaries or canteens in correctional insti-
 tutions. 1. The commissioner may authorize the head of  any  institution
 in  the department to establish a commissary or a canteen in such insti-
 tution for the use and benefit of incarcerated individuals.  The  moneys
 received by the head of the institution as profits from the sales of the

 as the commissary or canteen fund and such funds shall be used  for  the
 general purposes of the institution subject to the provisions of section
 fifty-three of the state finance law.
  2.  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL NOT IMPOSE OR COLLECT ANY FEES RELATED TO
 COMMISSARY TRANSACTIONS FROM INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING,  TRANS-

 SERVICE CHARGES OR HANDLING FEES FOR THE  DELIVERY  OF  GOODS  FROM  THE
 COMMISSARY.
  §  22.  Paragraph  (a) of subdivision 1 of section 1197 of the vehicle

 cer of each county participating in the program.
