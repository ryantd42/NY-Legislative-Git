 and security, and in that of their family members, will enable the judi-
 ciary  to perform its duties fairly without fear of personal reprisal by
 litigants and others affected by the decisions of judges.
  This objective will be accomplished by providing a means by which  (i)
 private  information concerning active and former judges and their imme-
 diate families can be kept from public display; and (ii) persons,  busi-
 nesses, associations, and public and private agencies having such infor-
 mation  can  be forbidden from posting it, or sharing or trading it with
 others.
  This act shall be  broadly  construed  to  favor  protections  of  the
 private  information  of those persons designated hereunder as "eligible
 individuals".

  2. Preliminary injunction. (a) Pending a proceeding  for  a  permanent
 injunction  pursuant  to  this section the court may grant a preliminary
 injunction enjoining the unlicensed activity and the person  or  persons
 conducting,  maintaining,  or  permitting  the  unlicensed activity from
 further conducting, maintaining, or permitting the unlicensed  activity,
 where  the  public  health,  safety  or welfare immediately requires the
 granting of such injunction. A temporary closing order  may  be  granted
 pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction where it appears by clear
 and  convincing  evidence  that  unlicensed activity within the scope of
 this section is being conducted, maintained, or permitted and  that  the
 public  health, safety or welfare immediately requires the granting of a
 temporary closing order. A temporary restraining order  may  be  granted
 pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction.
  (b)  A  preliminary  injunction shall be enforced by the office or, at
 the request of the office, the attorney general. At the request  of  the
 office,  a  police  officer  or peace officer with jurisdiction may also
 enforce the preliminary injunction.
  (c) The office or the attorney general shall show,  by  affidavit  and
 such other evidence as may be submitted, that there is a cause of action
 for a permanent injunction abating unlicensed activity.
  3.  Temporary  closing  order.  (a)  If, on a motion for a preliminary
 injunction alleging unlicensed activity as described in this section  in
 a  building or premises used for commercial purposes only, the office or
 the attorney general demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence  that
 such  unlicensed  activity  is being conducted, maintained, or permitted
 and that the public health, safety, or welfare  immediately  requires  a
 S. 8305--C  18  A. 8805--C
 
 temporary  closing  order,  a  temporary  order closing such part of the
 building  or  premises  wherein  such  unlicensed  activity  is  being
 conducted, maintained, or permitted may be granted without notice, pend-
 ing  order  of the court granting or refusing the preliminary injunction
 and until further order of the court.  ANY SUCH CLOSING ORDER  MAY  ALSO
 INCLUDE  A PRESERVATION ORDER AUTHORIZING ISSUANCE OF SUBPOENAS TO THIRD
 PARTIES TO PRESERVE ALL  OFF  SITE  ELECTRONIC  BUSINESS  RECORDS.  Upon
 granting  a  temporary closing order, the court shall direct the holding
 of a hearing for the preliminary injunction  at  the  earliest  possible
 time  but  no  later  than three business days from the granting of such
 order; a decision on the motion for a preliminary  injunction  shall  be
 rendered  by  the  court  within  [three]  FOUR  business days after the
 conclusion of the hearing.
  (b) Unless the court  orders  otherwise,  a  temporary  closing  order
 together with the papers upon which it was based and a notice of hearing
 for  the  preliminary injunction shall be personally served, in the same
 manner as a summons as provided in the civil practice law and rules.
  (c) A temporary closing order shall only be issued prior to a  hearing
 on  a  preliminary  injunction if the [building or] premises THAT IS THE
 SUBJECT OF THE CLOSURE ORDER is used for commercial purposes only.
  (d) No temporary closing order shall be issued against any building or
 premises where, in addition to the unlicensed activity which is alleged,
 activity that is licensed or otherwise lawful remains in  place,  UNLESS
 THE  LICENSED  OR  OTHERWISE LAWFUL ACTIVITY IS A DE MINIMIS PART OF THE
 BUSINESS.  In addition, no temporary  closing  order  shall  be  issued
 against  any building or premises which is used in part as residence and
 pursuant to local law or ordinance is zoned and lawfully occupied  as  a
 residence.
  4.  Temporary restraining order. (a) If, on a motion for a preliminary
 injunction alleging unlicensed activity as described in this section  in
 a  building  or premises used for commercial purposes, the office or the
 attorney general demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that such
 unlicensed activity is being conducted,  maintained,  or  permitted  and
 that the public health, safety, or welfare immediately requires a tempo-
 rary  restraining  order,  a  temporary restraining order may be granted
 without notice restraining the defendants and all persons from  removing
 or  in  any  manner interfering with the furniture, fixtures and movable
 property used in conducting, maintaining or permitting  such  unlicensed
 activity,  including [adult-use] cannabis, CANNABIS PRODUCT, CANNABINOID
 HEMP OR HEMP EXTRACT PRODUCT, OR ANY PRODUCT MARKETED OR LABELED AS SUCH
 and from further conducting, maintaining or permitting  such  unlicensed
 activity,  pending  order of the court granting or refusing the prelimi-
 nary injunction and until further order of the court.  ANY SUCH  TEMPO-
 RARY RESTRAINING ORDER MAY ALSO INCLUDE A PRESERVATION ORDER AUTHORIZING
 ISSUANCE  OF  SUBPOENAS  TO THIRD PARTIES TO PRESERVE ALL OFF SITE ELEC-
 TRONIC BUSINESS RECORDS. Upon granting a  temporary  restraining  order,
 the  court  shall  direct  the  holding of a hearing for the preliminary
 injunction at the earliest possible time but no later than  three  busi-
 ness  days from the granting of such order; a decision on the motion for
 a preliminary injunction shall be rendered by the  court  within  [three
 business] THIRTY CALENDAR days after the conclusion of the hearing.
  (b)  Unless  the court orders otherwise, a temporary restraining order
 and the papers upon which it was based and a notice of hearing  for  the
 preliminary injunction shall be personally served, in the same manner as
 a  summons  as  provided  in  the civil practice law and rules, UPON ANY
 S. 8305--C  19  A. 8805--C

 AGENT, EMPLOYEE, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEFENDANT BUSINESS PRES-
 ENT AT THE TIME THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER IS EFFECTUATED.
  5.  Temporary  closing  order; temporary restraining order; additional
 enforcement procedures. (a) If on a motion for a preliminary injunction,
 the office of  cannabis  management  or  the  attorney  general  submits
 evidence  warranting  both  a  temporary  closing  order and a temporary
 restraining order, the court shall grant both orders.
  (b) Upon the request of the office, any police officer or peace  offi-
 cer with jurisdiction may assist in the enforcement of a temporary clos-
 ing order and temporary restraining order. ANY REFERENCE TO POLICE OFFI-
 CER  OR PEACE OFFICER IN THIS SUBDIVISION AND SUBDIVISIONS SIX AND SEVEN
 OF THIS SECTION SHALL ALSO INCLUDE  ANY  INVESTIGATOR  EMPLOYED  BY  THE
 OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
  (c)  The  police  officer or peace officer serving a temporary closing
 order or a temporary restraining order shall forthwith make  and  return
 to  the  court an inventory of personal property situated in and used in
 conducting, maintaining, or permitting the  unlicensed  activity  within
 the  scope of this chapter and shall enter upon the building or premises
 for such purpose. Such inventory shall be taken in any manner  which  is
 deemed  likely  to  evidence  a  true and accurate representation of the
 personal property subject to such inventory including, but  not  limited
 to  photographing  such personal property, EXCEPT THAT ANY CASH FOUND ON
 THE PREMISES DURING SUCH INVENTORY SHALL  BE  INVENTORIED,  SEIZED,  AND
 SECURED  OFF  PREMISES  PENDING  FURTHER  ORDER OF THE COURT. ANY POLICE
 OFFICER OR PEACE OFFICER, OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OFFICE, SHALL  BE
 PERMITTED TO REVIEW AND COPY RECORDS.
  (d)  The  police  officer or peace officer serving a temporary closing
 order shall, upon service of the order, command all persons  present  in
 the  building  or  premises  to  vacate the premises forthwith. Upon the
 building or premises being  vacated,  the  premises  shall  be  securely
 locked and all keys delivered to the officer serving the order who ther-
 eafter  [shall] MAY deliver the keys to the fee owner, lessor, or lessee
 of the building or premises involved.  If  the  fee  owner,  lessor,  or
 lessee  is  not  at  the  building  or  premises when the order is being
 executed, the officer shall securely padlock the premises and retain the
 keys until the fee owner, lessor, or lessee of the  building  is  ascer-
 tained, in which event, the officer [shall] MAY deliver the keys to such
 owner,  lessor,  or  lessee  OR RETAIN THEM PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE
 COURT.
  (e) Upon service of a temporary closing order or a temporary restrain-
 ing order, the police officer or peace officer shall post a copy thereof
 in a conspicuous place or upon one or more of  the  principal  doors  at
 entrances  of  such  premises  where  the  unlicensed  activity is being
 conducted, maintained, or permitted.  In  addition,  where  a  temporary
 closing  order has been granted, the officer shall affix, in a conspicu-
 ous place or upon one or more of the principal  doors  at  entrances  of
 such  premises,  a  printed notice that the premises have been closed by
 court order, which notice shall contain  the  legend  "closed  by  court
 order"  in  block  lettering of sufficient size to be observed by anyone
 intending or likely to enter the premises, the date of  the  order,  the
 court  from  which issued, and the name of the officer or agency posting
 the notice. In addition, where a temporary restraining  order  has  been
 granted,  the  police  officer or peace officer shall affix, in the same
 manner, a notice similar to the notice provided for  in  relation  to  a
 temporary  closing order except that the notice shall state that certain
 described activity is prohibited by court  order  and  that  removal  of
 S. 8305--C  20  A. 8805--C

 posted order or such a posted notice while it remains in force, in addi-
 tion to any other punishment prescribed by law, shall be punishable,  on
 conviction,  by  a  fine  of  not  more than five thousand dollars or by
 imprisonment not exceeding ninety days, or by both, provided such  order
 or  notice contains therein a notice of such penalty. Any police officer

 THIS SECTION, if [the] A defendant WHO IS  THE  FEE  OWNER,  LESSOR,  OR
 LESSEE  OF  THE  BUILDING  OR PREMISES shows by affidavit and such other
 proof as may be submitted that the unlicensed activity within the  scope
 of  this  chapter  has been abated AND THAT THEY ARE ALSO NOT AFFILIATED

 NEY, CORPORATION COUNSEL, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AS APPLICABLE, to inspect
 the  building  or premises which is the subject of a proceeding pursuant
 to this subdivision, periodically without notice, during the pendency of
 the proceeding for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the  unli-
 censed  activity  has  been resumed. Any police officer or peace officer
 with jurisdiction may, upon the request of the  office,  assist  in  the
 enforcement  of an inspection provision of an order vacating a temporary
 closing order or temporary restraining order.
  (b) A temporary closing order or a temporary restraining order may  be
 vacated by the court, upon notice to the office, OR ANY COUNTY ATTORNEY,
 CORPORATION  COUNSEL,  OR  LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AS APPLICABLE, when [the] A
 defendant ENTITLED TO REQUEST VACATUR PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (A) OF  THIS
 SUBDIVISION  gives  an  undertaking  and the court is satisfied that the
 public health, safety, or welfare will be  protected  adequately  during
 the  pendency  of  the proceeding. The undertaking shall be in an amount
 equal to the assessed valuation of the building or  premises  where  the
 unlicensed  activity  is being conducted, maintained, or permitted or in
 such other amount as may be fixed by the court. The defendant shall  pay
 to  the  office  and  the  attorney  general, in the event a judgment of
 permanent injunction is  obtained,  their  actual  costs,  expenses  and
 disbursements  in  bringing and maintaining the proceeding. In addition,
 the defendant shall pay to the local government or law enforcement agen-
 cy that provided assistance in enforcing any order of the  court  issued

 tion pursuant to this chapter shall direct that  any  illicit  cannabis,
 CANNABIS PRODUCT, CANNABINOID HEMP OR HEMP EXTRACT PRODUCT, OR ANY PROD-
 UCT  MARKETED  OR  LABELED  AS  SUCH  seized shall be turned over to the
 office of cannabis management or their  authorized  representative.  The
 judgment  may  further  direct  any police officer or peace officer with
 jurisdiction to seize and remove from the building or premises all mate-
 rial, equipment, and instrumentalities used in the creation and  mainte-
 nance  of the unlicensed activity and shall direct the sale by the sher-
 S. 8305--C  21  A. 8805--C

 iff of any such property in the manner provided for the sale of personal
 property under execution pursuant to the provisions of the  civil  prac-
 tice  law  and rules, IF THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PROPERTY EXCEEDS THE
 ESTIMATED  LAWFUL EXPENSES OF SUCH SALE, OR THE DISPOSAL OF THE PROPERTY
 IF THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PROPERTY DOES  NOT  EXCEED  THE  ESTIMATED
 LAWFUL  EXPENSES  OF SUCH SALE. The net proceeds of any such sale, after
 deduction of the lawful expenses involved, shall be paid to the  general
 fund of the state.
  (b)  A judgment awarding a permanent injunction pursuant to this chap-
 ter may direct the closing of the building or  premises  by  any  police
 officer  or  peace  officer with jurisdiction to the extent necessary to
 abate the unlicensed activity and shall direct  any  police  officer  or
 peace  officer  with  jurisdiction  to post a copy of the judgment and a
 printed notice of such closing conforming to the  requirements  of  this
 chapter.  The  closing directed by the judgment shall be for such period
 as the court may direct but in no event shall the closing be for a peri-
 od of more than one year from the posting of the judgment  provided  for
 in  this  section.  If the owner shall file a bond in the value of the
 property ordered to be closed and submits proof to the  court  that  the
 unlicensed activity has been abated and will not be created, maintained,
 or  permitted  for  such  period of time as the building or premises has
 been directed to be closed in the judgment, AND ALSO SUBMITS PROOF  THAT
 THEY ARE ALSO NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE PERSON WHO IS CONDUCTING THE UNLI-
 CENSED  ACTIVITY,  the  court  may vacate the provisions of the judgment
 that direct the closing of the building or  premises.  A  closing  by  a
 police  officer  or  peace  officer  with  jurisdiction  pursuant to the
 provisions of this section shall not constitute an  act  of  possession,
 ownership,  or  control  by  such police officer or peace officer of the
 closed premises.
  (c) Upon the request of the  office  of  cannabis  management  or  its
 authorized  representative, OR ANY COUNTY ATTORNEY, CORPORATION COUNSEL,

 named in the petition in such proceeding, such lien  to  date  from  the
 time of filing a notice of lis pendens in the office of the clerk of the
 county  wherein  the  building  or  premises is located. Every such lien
 shall have priority before any mortgage or other lien that exists  prior
 to such filing except tax and assessment liens.
  (e)  A judgment awarding a permanent injunction pursuant to this chap-
 ter shall provide, in addition to the costs and disbursements allowed by
 the civil practice law and rules, upon satisfactory proof  by  affidavit
 or  such  other evidence as may be submitted, the actual costs, expenses
 and disbursements of the office and the  attorney  general,  OR  OF  ANY
 COUNTY  ATTORNEY,  CORPORATION  COUNSEL,  OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZED

 follows:
  1.(a)  Any  person  who  cultivates for sale, OFFERS TO SELL, or sells
 cannabis, cannabis products, medical cannabis, or any  product  marketed
 or  labeled as such, without having an appropriate registration, license
 or permit therefor, including a person whose registration,  license,  or

 tional civil penalty in an amount of no more than five times the revenue

 dence or other real property not otherwise  held  out  as  open  to  the
 public or otherwise being utilized in a business or commercial manner or
 S. 8305--C  32  A. 8805--C

 such product on such premises or vehicle does not exceed the  limits  of
 personal  use under article two hundred twenty-two of the penal law, may
 be subject to a civil penalty of no more than five thousand dollars.
  Provided,  further,  that  where such person has been ordered to cease

 eight-a  of  this [chapter] ARTICLE, such person may be assessed a civil
 penalty of no more than twenty thousand dollars per  day  for  each  day
 during  which  such  violation  continues  after receiving such order in
 addition to the additional civil penalties set  forth  above;  provided,
 however,  that any such person who engages in such activity from a resi-

 the office or the board, shall be authorized to apply, without notice to
 such person, to the supreme court in the county in which  the  place  of
 business  is located for an order granting the office or board access to

 business which does not possess a valid registration, license, or permit
 issued by the office or board.
  (c) In assessing the civil penalties under this subdivision OR  SUBDI-

 sales  or  up  to  two thousand five hundred dollars for each such sale,
 provided, however, that where such conduct also constitutes a  violation
 of  subdivision  one of this section, such person may only be subject to
 the civil penalties under one such subdivision, and  provided,  further,
 that  where  such person has been ordered to cease such conduct pursuant
 to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-a of  this  arti-

 cle,  such person may be assessed a civil penalty of up to five thousand

 of  section  715-a  of the real property actions and proceedings law, as
 added by section 21 of part UU of chapter 56 of the laws  of  2023,  are

  1.  Any duly authorized enforcement agency of the state or of a subdi-
 vision thereof, under a duty to enforce the provisions of the penal  law
 or of any state or local law, ordinance, code, rule or regulation relat-
 ing  to  buildings,  or  the  cannabis control board, office of cannabis
 management or the attorney general pursuant to section one hundred thir-
 ty-eight-a of the cannabis law, may serve personally upon the  owner  or
 landlord  of  real  property  authorized or otherwise intended or adver-
 tised, in whole or part, for use to buy, sell or otherwise provide goods
 or services, or for other business, commercial, professional services or
 manufacturing activities, or upon their agent, a written notice  requir-
 ing  the  owner  or landlord to make an application for the removal of a
 commercial tenant so using or occupying the  same  for  a  violation  of
 article  two  hundred  twenty-two of the penal law or article six of the
 cannabis law involving the unlicensed  sale  of  cannabis[,  where  such
 property,  or  the portion thereof being used for such unlicensed activ-
 ity, is not occupied for  any  other  licensed  or  lawful  purpose]  OR
 PRODUCTS  MARKETED OR LABELED AS SUCH. If the owner or landlord or their
 agent does not make such application within five  days  thereafter;  or,
 having  made  it,  does  not  in good faith diligently prosecute it, the
 enforcement agency giving the notice may bring a proceeding  under  this
 article  for  such  removal  as  though the petitioner were the owner or
 landlord of the premises, and shall have  precedence  over  any  similar
 proceeding thereafter brought by such owner or landlord or to one there-
 S. 8305--C  38  A. 8805--C
 
 tofore  brought by them and not prosecuted diligently and in good faith.
 An enforcement agency authorized to bring a petition hereunder may do so
 on their own initiative or upon a referral from an agency of  the  state
 or  a  subdivision thereof. The person in possession of the property, as
 well as any lessee or sublessee and the owner or landlord shall be  made
 respondents in the proceeding.
  (b)  impose  and  require  the payment by any respondent not otherwise
 subject to a civil penalty under section sixteen or one hundred  twenty-
 five of the cannabis law, who has been found to have knowingly permitted
 such  a violation, a civil penalty not exceeding [three]  FIVE times the
 amount of rent charged, OWED, OR PAID, AS THE CASE MAY BE, for the dura-
 tion of the violation, WHICH MAY BE CALCULATED FROM THE DATE  THE  OWNER
 OR  LANDLORD RESPONDENT RECEIVED NOTICE OF THE VIOLATION TO THE DATE THE
 UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IS ABATED, FOR WHICH A RESPONDENT SHALL BE  REQUIRED
 TO  PROVIDE  SUFFICIENT  PROOF  THEREOF,  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A
 SWORN STATEMENT BY A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL  ENTITY
 THAT THE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY HAS BEEN ABATED; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN
 A  CITY WITH A POPULATION OF OVER ONE MILLION THE CIVIL PENALTY SHALL BE
 FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.  THE  LANDLORD  OR  PROPERTY  OWNER  SHALL  ALSO
 PROVIDE A COPY OF ANY EXECUTED LEASE WITH SUCH TENANT;
  4.  The use or occupancy of premises [solely or primarily] CUSTOMARILY
 OR HABITUALLY for the unlicensed retail sale  of  cannabis  OR  PRODUCTS
 MARKETED  OR LABELED AS SUCH shall constitute an illegal trade, manufac-
 ture, or other business for the purposes of section two hundred  thirty-
 one of the real property law.
  §  18.  This  act  shall  take  effect  immediately and shall apply to
 offenses committed on or after the date this act  shall  have  become  a
 law;  provided,  however,  evidence of past violations of sections 138-a
 and 125 of the cannabis law may be considered  when  imposing  penalties
 under  the  cannabis  law  or issuing orders to seal pursuant to section
 138-b of the cannabis law established pursuant  to  section  fifteen  of
 this  act;  and provided, however that the amendments to section 16-a of
 the cannabis law made by section five of this act shall not  affect  the
 repeal of such section and shall be deemed repealed therewith.

  § 239-bb. County-wide shared  services  panels.  1.  Definitions.  The
 following  terms  shall  have the following meanings for the purposes of
 this article:
  a. "County" shall mean any county not wholly contained within a city.
  b. "County CEO" shall mean the county  executive,  county  manager  or
 other  chief  executive  of the county, or, where none, the chair of the
 county legislative body.
  c. "Panel" shall mean a county-wide shared services panel  established
 pursuant to subdivision two of this section.
  d.  "Plan"  shall  mean  a  county-wide  shared  services property tax

 ty-wide shared services panel in each county consisting  of  the  county
 CEO,  and  one  representative  from  each city, town and village in the
 county. The chief executive officer of each town, city and village shall
 be the representative to a panel and shall be the mayor, if a city or  a
 village,  or  shall  be  the supervisor, if a town. The county CEO shall
 serve as chair. [All panels established in each county pursuant to  part
 BBB  of  chapter  fifty-nine  of the laws of two thousand seventeen, and
 S. 8305--C  45  A. 8805--C

 prior to the enactment of this article, shall continue  in  satisfaction
 of this section in such form as they were established, provided that the
 county  CEO  may alter the membership of the panel consistent with para-
 graph b of this subdivision.]
  b. The county CEO may invite any school district, board of cooperative
 educational  services,  fire  district,  fire  protection  district,  or
 special improvement district in the county to join a  panel.  Upon  such
 invitation, the governing body of such school district, board of cooper-
 ative  educational services, fire district, fire protection district, or
 other special district may accept such invitation by selecting a  repre-
 sentative of such governing body, by majority vote, to serve as a member
 of  the  panel.  [Such school district, board of cooperative educational
 services, fire district,  fire  protection  district  or  other  special
 district  shall  maintain  such  representation  until  the panel either
 approves a plan or transmits a statement to the secretary  of  state  on
 the  reason the panel did not approve a plan, pursuant to paragraph d of
 subdivision seven of this section. Upon approval of a plan or  a  trans-
 mission  of  a  statement to the secretary of state that a panel did not
 approve a plan in any calendar year, the county CEO may, but  need  not,
 invite  any  school district, board of cooperative educational services,
 fire district, fire protection district or special improvement  district
 in the county to join a panel thereafter convened.]

 part BBB of chapter fifty-nine of the laws of  two  thousand  seventeen,
 annually]  MAY  convene  the  panel  and  [shall undertake to revise and
 update a previously approved plan or alternatively] develop a [new] plan
 [through December thirty-first, two  thousand  twenty-one].  Such  plans
 shall contain new, recurring property tax savings resulting from actions
 such  as,  but  not limited to, the elimination of duplicative services;
 shared services arrangements including, joint purchasing, shared highway
 equipment, shared storage facilities, shared plowing services and energy
 and insurance purchasing cooperatives; reducing back office and adminis-
 trative overhead; and better coordinating  services.  The  secretary  of
 state  may  provide advice and/or recommendations on the form and struc-
 ture of such plans.
  [b. After having convened at least two meetings in a calendar year,  a
 panel may, by majority vote, determine that it is not in the best inter-
 est  of the taxpayers to revise and update a previously approved plan or
 to develop a new plan in such year. The county CEO of such  panel  shall
 then comply with the provisions of paragraph (d) of subdivision seven of
 this section.]
  4.  While  [revising or updating a previously approved plan, or while]
 developing a [new] plan, the county CEO shall  regularly  consult  with,
 and  take  recommendations  from,  the representatives: on the panel; of
 each collective bargaining unit of the county and the cities, towns, and
 villages; and of each collective bargaining unit  of  any  participating
 school  district,  board  of  cooperative  educational  services,  fire

 SUBTRACTED SHALL BE EITHER (A) THE FULL VALUE OF THE PROPERTY  AS  SHOWN
 ON  THE MOST RECENT TAX ROLL, (B) IF AVAILABLE, AN APPRAISAL PREPARED BY
 A LICENSED NEW YORK STATE APPRAISER THAT ESTABLISHES THE FULL  VALUE  OF
 THE  PROPERTY  AS  OF THE DATE OF THE TRANSFER OF TITLE, OR (C) THE FULL
 VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AS OF THE DATE OF THE TRANSFER OF TITLE AS  DETER-
 MINED BY SUCH OTHER VALUATION METHOD AS THE ENFORCING OFFICER REASONABLY
 DETERMINES  WILL  RESULT  IN  JUST  COMPENSATION TO THE FORMER OWNER AND
 OTHER PARTIES WHOSE INTERESTS WERE EXTINGUISHED BY THE FORECLOSURE.
  (B) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, WHERE THE ENFORCING OFFICER  HAS
 BEEN  NOTIFIED  THAT  THE  TAX DISTRICT INTENDS TO RETAIN TAX-FORECLOSED
 PROPERTY FOR A PUBLIC USE, THE PROPERTY SHALL BE  DEEMED  TO  HAVE  BEEN
 SOLD  ON  THE  DATE  THAT THE ENFORCING OFFICER WAS SO NOTIFIED, AND THE
 ENFORCING OFFICER SHALL DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE AND AMOUNT OF A  SURPLUS
 RELATIVE TO SUCH PROPERTY IN THE MANNER PROVIDED BY SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF
 PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  2.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION,
 WHEN A TAX DISTRICT HAS SOLD OR CONVEYED TAX-FORECLOSED  PROPERTY  TO  A
 LAND  BANK,  A  HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AGENCY OR ANOTHER PUBLIC ENTITY, AND
 SUCH SALE OR CONVEYANCE WAS NOT THE RESULT OF A PUBLIC SALE, OR  WHEN  A
 TAX  DISTRICT  HAS  DETERMINED  TO  RETAIN TAX-FORECLOSED PROPERTY FOR A
 S. 8305--C  62  A. 8805--C
 
 PUBLIC USE, NO SURPLUS SHALL BE PAYABLE IF ALL OF THE  FOLLOWING  CONDI-
 TIONS ARE SATISFIED:
  (A)  PRIOR TO SUCH SALE, CONVEYANCE OR DETERMINATION, THE PROPERTY HAD
 BEEN OFFERED FOR SALE AT TWO SEPARATE PUBLIC AUCTIONS CONDUCTED AT LEAST
 THREE MONTHS APART FROM ONE ANOTHER,
  (B) BOTH AUCTIONS HAD BEEN  CONDUCTED  IN  FULL  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  THIRTY-ONE  OF  THE REAL PROPERTY
 ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS LAW,
  (C) THE MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE BID AT EACH AUCTION  HAD  BEEN  SET  AT  AN
 AMOUNT NO GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE TAXES DUE PLUS INTEREST, PENALTIES
 AND OTHER CHARGES, AND
  (D)  NO  QUALIFYING  BIDS  WERE  RECEIVED  FOR  THE PROPERTY AT EITHER
 AUCTION.
  3. (A) IF THE ENFORCING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT NO SURPLUS IS  ATTRIB-
 UTABLE  TO THE SALE, SUCH ENFORCING OFFICER SHALL SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE
 COURT DESCRIBING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SALE, STATING THAT NO  SURPLUS
 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SALE AND DEMONSTRATING HOW THE ENFORCING OFFICER
 REACHED THAT CONCLUSION.
  (B) IF THE ENFORCING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT A SURPLUS IS ATTRIBUTABLE
 TO  THE  SALE, SUCH ENFORCING OFFICER SHALL SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE COURT
 DESCRIBING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SALE, STATING  THAT  A  SURPLUS  WAS
 ATTRIBUTABLE  TO  THE  SALE,  AND  DEMONSTRATING  HOW  THE AMOUNT OF THE
 SURPLUS WAS DETERMINED.  SUCH SURPLUS SHALL BE PAID TO THE COURT  THERE-
 WITH.  WITHIN TEN DAYS OF SUBMITTING SUCH REPORT, THE ENFORCING OFFICER
 SHALL NOTIFY THE FORMER PROPERTY OWNER THAT A SURPLUS  WAS  ATTRIBUTABLE
 TO  THE  SALE  OF  SUCH  PROPERTY,  THAT SUCH SURPLUS HAS BEEN PAID INTO
 COURT, AND THAT THE COURT WILL NOTIFY  THE  INTERESTED  PARTIES  OF  THE
 PROCEDURE  TO  BE  FOLLOWED  IN ORDER TO MAKE A CLAIM FOR A SHARE OF THE
 SURPLUS.
  (C) WHERE THE ENFORCING OFFICER'S DETERMINATION OF  SURPLUS  IS  BASED
 UPON  SUCH  ENFORCING  OFFICER'S  ESTIMATE  OF THE PROPERTY'S VALUE, THE
 ENFORCING OFFICER'S REPORT TO THE COURT SHALL SET FORTH  AN  EXPLANATION
 OF  HOW THIS ESTIMATE WAS MADE, INCLUDING THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH IT WAS
 BASED.
  4. UPON APPROVAL BY THE COURT OF THE ENFORCING OFFICER'S  REPORT,  THE
 TAX  DISTRICT  SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE
 PARCEL OR ANY SURPLUS ATTRIBUTABLE THERETO, EXCEPT  TO  THE  EXTENT  THE
 COURT  DIRECTS OTHERWISE PURSUANT TO SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-SEVEN
 OF THIS TITLE.
  § 1197.  CLAIMS FOR SURPLUS. 1. ANY PERSON WHO HAD ANY  RIGHT,  TITLE,
 INTEREST,  CLAIM, LIEN OR EQUITY OF REDEMPTION IN OR UPON A PARCEL IMME-
 DIATELY PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE JUDGMENT OF FORECLOSURE MAY FILE  A
 CLAIM  WITH  THE  COURT  HAVING  JURISDICTION FOR A SHARE OF ANY SURPLUS
 RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF SUCH PROPERTY.  SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE ADMINIS-
 TERED AND ADJUDICATED, AND SUCH SURPLUS SHALL  BE  DISTRIBUTED,  IN  THE
 SAME  MANNER AS IN AN ACTION TO FORECLOSE A MORTGAGE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE
 THIRTEEN OF THE REAL PROPERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS  LAW,  SUBJECT  TO
 THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  2.  (A)  WHERE THE PROPERTY WAS SOLD BY A PUBLIC SALE, THE AMOUNT PAID
 FOR THE PROPERTY SHALL BE ACCEPTED AS THE FULL VALUE  OF  THE  PROPERTY.
 NO  PARTY  MAY MAINTAIN A CLAIM FOR SURPLUS OR ANY OTHER CLAIM OR ACTION
 AGAINST THE TAX DISTRICT ON THE BASIS THAT THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE PROP-
 ERTY DID NOT FAIRLY REPRESENT THE PROPERTY'S VALUE.
  (B) WHERE THE PROPERTY WAS SOLD BY OTHER THAN A PUBLIC SALE, A  CLAIM-
 ANT  MAY  MAKE  A  MOTION, UPON NOTICE TO THE ENFORCING OFFICER, FOR THE
 SURPLUS TO BE RECALCULATED ON THE BASIS THAT THE PROPERTY'S  FULL  VALUE
 S. 8305--C  63  A. 8805--C
 
 ON  THE DATE OF THE SALE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE VALUE USED TO
 MEASURE THE SURPLUS PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF  PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF
 SUBDIVISION  ONE OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-SIX OF THIS TITLE.  IF
 THE  COURT  OR  ITS  REFEREE  FINDS THAT A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE
 SUPPORTS THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION, THE COURT  MAY  DIRECT  THE  ENFORCING
 OFFICER  TO  RECALCULATE  THE SURPLUS BASED UPON THE PROPERTY'S VALUE AS
 DETERMINED BY THE COURT OR REFEREE.  THE COURT MAY  FURTHER  DIRECT  THE
 ENFORCING  OFFICER TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE INTO COURT TO BE DISTRIBUTED AS
 REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION.
  3. WHERE THE COURT  HAS  APPOINTED  A  REFEREE  TO  PRESIDE  OVER  THE
 PROCEEDINGS  PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF SECTION THIRTEEN HUNDRED
 SIXTY-ONE OF THE REAL PROPERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS LAW, IT SHALL NOT
 BE NECESSARY FOR SUCH REFEREE TO MAKE A REPORT OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS;  NOR
 SHALL  IT  BE  NECESSARY  FOR THE COURT TO CONFIRM BY ORDER OR OTHERWISE
 SUCH PROCEEDINGS.
  4. IN THE CASE OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY, IF AT THE TIME OF THE  CONFIR-
 MATION  OF THE REPORT OF SALE, NO FORMER HOMEOWNER HAS FILED A CLAIM FOR
 SURPLUS, AND THERE ARE SURPLUS PROCEEDS THAT REMAIN TO  BE  DISTRIBUTED,
 THE  PROCEEDING  SHALL  REMAIN  OPEN  FOR  AT LEAST THREE YEARS FROM THE
 CONFIRMATION OF THE REPORT OF SALE, OR FOR SUCH  LONGER  PERIOD  AS  THE
 COURT  MAY DIRECT. IF A FORMER HOMEOWNER SHOULD FILE A CLAIM FOR SURPLUS
 DURING SUCH PERIOD, THE COURT SHALL PROCEED AS IF  IT  HAD  BEEN  TIMELY
 FILED.
  5.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, ANY SURPLUS FUNDS THAT HAVE
 NOT BEEN CLAIMED SHALL BE DEEMED ABANDONED BUT SHALL BE PAID TO THE  TAX
 DISTRICT,  NOT  TO  THE  STATE COMPTROLLER, AND SHALL BE USED BY THE TAX
 DISTRICT TO REDUCE ITS TAX LEVY.
  6. TO THE EXTENT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN OF THE REAL  PROP-
 ERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS LAW ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
 THIS ARTICLE, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL GOVERN.
  §  16.  Subparagraph (B) of paragraph 7 of subsection (eee) of section
 606 of the tax law, as amended by section 1 of subpart D of  part  Z  of
 chapter 59 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  (B)  Notwithstanding  any  provision of law to the contrary, the names

 collecting  officers  AND  ENFORCING  OFFICERS within New York state. In
 addition, such information may be exchanged with assessors and tax offi-
 cials from jurisdictions outside New York state if the laws of the other
 jurisdiction allow it to provide similar information to this state. Such
 information shall be considered confidential and shall not be subject to
 further disclosure pursuant to the freedom of information law or  other-
 wise.
  §  17. Subdivision (c) of section 6 of chapter 602 of the laws of 1993
 amending the real property tax law relating to the  enforcement  of  the
 collection  of  delinquent  real property taxes and to the collection of
 taxes by banks, as amended by chapter  562  of  the  laws  of  2021,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (c)  A  village which conducted a tax sale in 1993 pursuant to section
 1454 of the real property tax law is hereby authorized to adopt a  local
 law  without referendum, no later than September 1, 1994, providing that
 the collection of taxes that shall become liens on or after  January  1,
 1995  and on or before December 31, [2024] 2027 shall be enforced pursu-
 ant to title 3 of article 14 of the real property tax law, as  the  same
 shall  have  been in effect on the last day preceding the effective date
 S. 8305--C  64  A. 8805--C
 
 of this act. A copy of such local law shall  be  filed  with  the  state
 board  of  equalization  and  assessment  no later than October 1, 1994.
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ON AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THE  CHAPTER
 OF  THE  LAWS  OF 2024 THAT AMENDED THIS SUBDIVISION, THE ENFORCEMENT OF
 DELINQUENT TAXES IN A VILLAGE THAT HAS ADOPTED SUCH A  LOCAL  LAW  SHALL
 ALSO BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 1194-A OF THE REAL PROPERTY
 TAX LAW.
  §  18. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdi-
 vision, section or subpart contained in any part of this  act  shall  be
 adjudged  by  any  court  of  competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
 judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder  thereof,
 but  shall  be  confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, para-
 graph, subdivision, section or subpart contained  in  any  part  thereof
 directly  involved  in the controversy in which such judgment shall have
 been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of the legislature
 that this act would have been enacted even if  such  invalid  provisions
 had not been included herein.
  §  19.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to
 have been in full force and effect on and after May 25,  2023,  provided
 that:
  1.  (a) In a taxing jurisdiction that enforces delinquent taxes pursu-
 ant to article 11 of the real property tax law, where  a  tax-foreclosed
 property  has been sold on or after May 25, 2023 and prior to the effec-
 tive date of this act, the enforcing officer of the tax  district  shall
 have  six  months  from  the effective date of this act to submit to the
 court the report required by section 1194-a of the real property tax law
 as added by section fourteen of this act  regarding  the  existence  and
 amount of surplus and to pay such surplus to the court.
  (b)  In  a taxing jurisdiction that enforces delinquent taxes pursuant
 to a county charter, city charter, administrative code or  special  law,
 as  authorized  by  a  local law adopted pursuant to section 1104 of the
 real property tax law, the provisions of such county charter, city char-
 ter, administrative code or special law shall continue to apply  therein
 without  regard to the provisions of this act, provided that such county
 charter, city charter, administrative code or  special  law  provides  a
 mechanism  for  former  owners  and  other  parties whose interests were
 extinguished by the foreclosure  of  a  delinquent  tax  lien  to  claim
 surplus.  If  the county charter, city charter, administrative code or
 special law applicable to the taxing jurisdiction  does  not  provide  a
 mechanism  for  claiming  surplus,  the  taxing  jurisdiction  is hereby
 authorized to adopt a local law providing that surplus shall be adminis-
 tered therein in the manner provided by title 6 of  article  11  of  the
 real  property tax law, as added by section fifteen of this act.  Such a
 local law shall remain in effect until repealed or until the  applicable
 county  charter,  city  charter,  administrative  code or special law is
 amended to provide a mechanism for claiming surplus, whichever is  soon-
 er.  As used in this paragraph, the term "surplus" shall have substan-
 tially the same meaning as set forth in section 1195 of the real proper-
 ty tax law, as added by section fifteen of this act, provided,  however,
 that in a city with a population of one million or more, such term shall
 mean  the  difference,  if  any,  after  subtracting: (A) the sum of the
 amount of the delinquent tax lien on  a  property  and  any  foreclosure
 costs  from  (B) the proceeds of the sale of such property pursuant to a
 foreclosure by the taxing jurisdiction; and provided  further,  that  in
 such a city, the term "foreclosure costs" means the sum of the "charges"
 as  defined  by section 1102 of the real property tax law, as amended by
 S. 8305--C  65  A. 8805--C

 section four of this act, and any other amounts specifically  identified
 in  such  charter,  code or special law as due and payable upon foreclo-
 sure.
  (c)  In  any  taxing jurisdiction, where a tax-foreclosed property was
 sold prior to May 25, 2023, a claim for  surplus  attributable  to  such
 sale  may  be  maintained if and only if a proceeding to compel such tax
 district to distribute such surplus to the petitioner or petitioners had
 been initiated pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 7803  of  the  civil
 practice law and rules, such proceeding was commenced in a timely manner
 as  provided  by  section  217  of such chapter, and such proceeding was
 still active on the effective date of this act.
  (d) For purposes of this paragraph,  the  term  "taxing  jurisdiction"
 means  a municipal corporation with the power to enforce delinquent real
 property tax liens.
  2. Section seventeen of this act shall  take  effect  immediately  and
 shall  be deemed to have been in full force and effect on and after July
 26, 1994.

 ages at retail for consumption on the premises or (b) the operation of a
 legitimate theatre, INCLUDING A MOTION PICTURE THEATRE THAT IS A  BUILD-
 ING  OR FACILITY WHICH IS REGULARLY USED AND KEPT OPEN PRIMARILY FOR THE
 EXHIBITION OF MOTION PICTURES FOR AT LEAST FIVE  OUT  OF  SEVEN  DAYS  A

 NON-ALCOHOLIC  BEVERAGES,  or  such  other lawful adult entertainment or
 recreational facility as the liquor authority, giving due regard to  the
 convenience  of  the public and the strict avoidance of sales prohibited
 by this chapter, shall by regulation classify for eligibility.  [Nothing

 of a license to a motion picture theatre, except those meeting the defi-
 nition of restaurant and meals, and where all seating is at tables where

 able  for  sale  to  its  customers for consumption on the premises. The
 availability of sandwiches, soups or other foods, whether  fresh,  proc-
 essed,  pre-cooked  or  frozen,  shall  be  deemed  compliance with this
 requirement.  FOR MOTION PICTURE THEATRES LICENSED UNDER  PARAGRAPH  (B)

 MOTION PICTURE THEATRE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO:  POPCORN,  CANDY,
 AND LIGHT SNACKS, SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REQUIRE-
 MENT. The licensed premises shall comply at all times with all the regu-
 lations  of  the  local  department of health. Nothing contained in this

 sold  or  purchased  with  any liquor, nor shall any rule, regulation or
 standard be promulgated or enforced requiring that the sale of  food  be
 substantial  or  that  the  receipts of the business other than from the
 sale of liquor equal any set percentage of  total  receipts  from  sales
 made therein.

 law, as added by chapter 531 of the laws of 1964, is amended to read  as

 S. 8305--C  67  A. 8805--C

 city  of  Buffalo as if the council had not already created a city debt.
 In the event a successful petition is filed with  the  city  clerk,  the

 unless such resolution is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority
 of the qualified electors.
  § 4. Separability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part

 internal  revenue  code,  and  the  effectiveness  and existence of such
 sections and benefits they confer are completely contingent thereon.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately, provided, however that:
  (a) The provisions of sections two and three of this act shall  remain
 in  full  force  and  effect  only  so long as, pursuant to federal law,
 contributions picked up under such sections are not includable as  gross
 income  of a member for federal income tax purposes until distributed or
 made available to the member; provided that the New York city employees'
 retirement system shall notify the legislative bill drafting  commission
 upon the occurrence of such a change in federal law ruling affecting the
 provisions  of  this  act  in  order that the commission may maintain an
 accurate and timely effective data base of the official text of the laws
 of the state of New York in furtherance of effectuating  the  provisions
 of  section  44  of  the  legislative law and section 70-b of the public
 officers law;
  (b) The amendments to subdivision a of section 603 of  the  retirement
 and  social  security  law  made  by section three of this act shall not
 affect the expiration of such subdivision and shall be deemed to  expire
 therewith.

  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census data for the fire
 protection inspectors assumed to elect an FPI 25-Year Plan is summarized
 below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  82
  - Average Age:  41.6
  - Average Service:  13.6
  - Average Salary:  88,200
 
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: The proposed  legislation
 would  provide  fire  protection inspectors a service retirement benefit
 under the FPI 25-Year Plans equal to 50% of Final Average  Salary  (FAS)
 for  the  first  25  years of Allowable Service, plus 2% of FAS for each
 additional year of Allowable Service exceeding 25 years up to a  maximum
 of 30 years. The FAS is based on a three-year average for Tier 4 members
 and a five-year average for Tier 6 members. The vested benefit under the
 FPI 25-Year Plans would be 2% of FAS for each year of Allowable Service.
  Members of the FPI 25-Year Plans would be required to pay Basic Member
 Contributions (BMC), which vary by tier, plus Additional Member Contrib-
 utions  (AMC)  equal  to 6.25% of compensation for all service as a Plan
 participant on and after the starting date of the Plan until  the  later
 of  the  one-year  anniversary  of the effective date of the Plans or 30
 years of Allowable Service. In no event shall BMC plus AMC exceed  9.25%
 of compensation.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
 S. 8305--C  79  A. 8805--C
 
  *  The  rates  of  retirement  for the FPI 25-Year Plans were assigned
 based on members' eligibility to elect or opt out of the plan.  The  FPI
 25-year  plan  will  be optional for current fire protection inspectors.
 Future members will be mandated into the FPI 25-year  plan  unless  they
 are over age 25 when hired as a fire protection inspector.
  *  New  entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so that total
 payroll for fire protection inspectors increases by 3%  each  year.  New
 entrant  demographics  were developed based on data for recent new hires
 and actuarial judgement. Future members, who are not over  age  25  when
 hired  as  a  fire  protection inspector, would be mandated into the FPI
 25-year plan.
  To determine the impact of the elective nature of the proposed  legis-
 lation,  a  subgroup  of NYCERS Fire Protection Inspectors was developed
 based on who is assumed to benefit  actuarially  by  comparing  the  net
 present  value  of  future employer costs of each member's benefit under
 their current plan and under the applicable FPI 25-Year Plan.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

  PART GG
 
  Section  1.  Section  3  of  part HH of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022
 amending the retirement and social  security  law  relating  to  waiving
 approval and income limitations on retirees employed in school districts
 and  board  of cooperative educational services, as amended by section 1
 of part V of chapter 55 of the laws of  2023,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed June 30, [2024] 2025.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow retirees employed by a  New  York  State  school
 district  or by the board of cooperative educational services (BOCES) to
 collect a salary without suspension or diminution of their pension bene-
 fit through June 30, 2025.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  (NYSLERS), if this bill were enacted during the 2024
 Legislative Session, the direct cost incurred  would  be  the  retiree's
 pension  benefit  paid  while post-retirement earnings are above $35,000
 each calendar year. The pension benefit  expected  to  be  paid  by  the
 NYSLERS  during  that  6-month  period  is  estimated  to be $22,000 per
 person.
 S. 8305--C  82  A. 8805--C
 
  In addition to the direct cost quoted above, there would be additional
 costs in the form of lost employer  contributions  due  to  non-billable
 post-retirement earnings, which is estimated to be $5,500 per person.
  The  number  of  members  and  retirees  who could be affected by this
 legislation cannot be readily determined. For each retiree hired  pursu-
 ant to this proposal, an annual cost of $27,500 is expected.
  Summary of relevant resources:

 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the
 2023  Report  of the Actuary and the 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.
  The actuarial assumptions and methods used are described in  the  2023

  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated March 27, 2024, and intended for use only  during
 the  2024  Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note No. 2024-140 Revised,
 prepared by the Actuary for the New  York  State  and  Local  Retirement
 System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend  Part HH of Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2022 to
 extend the waiver of the earnings-after-retirement limit  for  one  more
 year  to  June  30,  2025  for retired members who return to work with a
 school district or a board of cooperative educational services  (BOCES).
 The  current  expiration  date  is  June 30, 2024 for the waiver of this
 limit.  This act shall take effect  immediately  and  shall  be  deemed
 repealed on June 30, 2025.
  It  is  estimated  that there will be no additional annual cost to the
 employers of members of the New York State Teachers'  Retirement  System
 if  this  bill is enacted. There could be additional annual costs in the
 future if this waiver is continually extended such that  it  becomes  an
 expectation,  as  this  could lead to some members retiring earlier than
 they otherwise would have. Earlier retirement generally  increases  plan
 costs  since members will be receiving their benefits for a longer peri-
 od.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can
 be found in the System's Annual Report for fiscal year  ended  June  30,
 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial statements
 and  can  also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuarial assump-
 tions and methods are  provided  in  the  System's  Actuarial  Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.

  PART HH
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 3 of section 363-a of the retirement and social
 security  law, as amended by chapter 437 of the laws of 2016, is amended
 to read as follows:
  3. As used in this section, the terms "firefighter" and "police  offi-
 cer"  mean  any  member who is performing police or fire service, as the
 phrase police or fire service is defined in paragraphs a, b, c, d, f (as
 added by chapter six hundred seventy-four of the laws of nineteen eight-
 y-six), f (as added by chapter six hundred seventy-seven of the laws  of
 nineteen  eighty-six),  g,  h,  I and j of subdivision eleven of section
 three hundred two of this article, and who, prior to entry into  service
 as a firefighter or police officer, successfully passed a physical exam-
 ination  which  failed  to  disclose  evidence  of  any disease or other
 impairment of the heart.
  § 2. The amendments to section 363-a  of  the  retirement  and  social
 security  law  made by section one of this act shall not affect, impair,
 or invalidate any  temporary  right,  privilege,  or  benefit  conferred
 pursuant  to  the  provisions  of a general, special or local law (other
 than pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the retirement and social securi-
 ty law) for any member of a public retirement  system  or  pension  plan
 funded  by the state or one of its political subdivisions, nor shall any
 amendments thereto affect the application of such provisions as extended
 by the provisions of section 480 of the retirement and  social  security
 law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.-- Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  is  a  technical  correction to Chapter 561 of the Laws of
 2015.  It would add a  "heart  bill"  performance  of  duty  disability
 provision  for  police  officers of the State University of New York who
 are members of the New York State and Local Police and  Fire  Retirement
 System (NYSLPFRS).
  If this legislation is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, it
 would  lead  to more disabilities being classified as "in performance of
 duty".
  However, we anticipate that few additional performance of  duty  disa-
 bility  retirements  will  be granted, and thus, the resulting costs are
 expected to be negligible.
  These estimated costs are based on 557 affected  members  employed  by
 the State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $53.8 million
 as of March 31, 2023.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the impact

  PART II
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature here-
 by  finds  and  declares  that  an adjustment to pensionable earnings of
 first grade police officers is necessary to enhance  public  safety  and
 prevent the loss of vital public services in this state. The legislature
 hereby  finds and declares that such adjustment is necessary to address,
 inter alia,  the  historic  police  officer  recruitment  and  retention
 crisis, the increase in police overtime, and the rise in crime impacting
 New  Yorkers.  Therefore, the legislature declares the necessity for the
 enactment of this act to  enhance  public  safety  and  protect  against
 disruption of vital public services in this state.
  § 2. Section 14-111 of the administrative code of the city of New York
 is amended by adding two new subdivisions c and d to read as follows:
  C.  WHEN  A  FIRST  GRADE POLICE OFFICER OF THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL HAVE SERVED IN THE RANK OF POLICE OFFICER FOR A  PERIOD
 OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, SUCH OFFICER SHALL HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS IN RESPECT
 TO THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR THE
 NEW  YORK CITY POLICE PENSION FUND AS A POLICE OFFICER DESIGNATED TO ACT
 AS DETECTIVE OF THE THIRD GRADE WHO SHALL HAVE  SERVED  AS  SUCH  FOR  A
 PERIOD  OF  TIME  AGGREGATING TWO YEARS AT THE HIGHEST SALARY RATE FOR A
 DETECTIVE OF THE THIRD GRADE.
  D. WHEN A FIRST GRADE POLICE OFFICER  OF  THE  NEW  YORK  CITY  POLICE
 DEPARTMENT  SHALL HAVE SERVED IN THE RANK OF POLICE OFFICER FOR A PERIOD
 OF THIRTY YEARS, SUCH OFFICER SHALL HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS IN  RESPECT  TO
 THE  NEW  YORK  STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR THE
 NEW YORK CITY POLICE PENSION FUND AS A SERGEANT WHO SHALL HAVE SERVED AS
 SUCH FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AGGREGATING TWO YEARS AT  THE  HIGHEST  SALARY
 RATE FOR A SERGEANT.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation, as it relates to the New York City
 Police  Pension Fund (POLICE), would increase the salary used for deter-
 mining pension benefits for first grade NYPD officers who have served in
 such rank for 25 or 30 years, to salaries equivalent  to  detective  3rd
 grade or sergeant, respectively.

  Projected  contributions are based on historical experience for Tier 2
 members. Future retirement patterns may differ due to a  larger  Tier  3
 population  (e.g.,  Tier 2 is expected to retire at 20 years of service,
 and Tier 3 is expected to retire at 25 years of service).
  The entire increase in employer contributions will be allocated to New
 York City.
  EXPECTED INCREASE (DECREASE) IN ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES
  The enactment of this proposed legislation is expected to increase the
 Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) by approximately $8.2 million in
 the first year and every year thereafter. Each year's PVFB increase will
 depend on the actual experience  of  benefiting  retirees  and  will  be
 recognized in the year benefits are first payable.

  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census  data  for  POLICE
 active members is summarized below.
 
  POLICE
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  33,800
  - Average Age:  37.6
  - Average Service:  11.3
  - Average Salary:  128,600
 S. 8305--C  86  A. 8805--C
 
  The salaries used in this analysis were provided by the Police Benevo-
 lent Association of the City of New York and reflect the latest contract
 negotiations. Below is a summary of the salary data provided:
  * Police Officer 1st Grade - $105,146
  * Detective 3rd Grade - $111,999
  * Sergeant - $125,852
  Data  from  prior actuarial valuations was used to estimate the number
 of retirees who could potentially benefit from this proposed legislation
 and is summarized below.
  * Police Officer 1st Grade who retired with 25-29 years in rank -  930
 retired over the past 10 years.
  *  Police  Officer  1st Grade who retired with 30+ years in rank - 218
 retired over the past 10 years.
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: The proposed legislation would permit first
 grade police officers, who have met  certain  service  requirements,  to
 have their pension calculations based on a higher assumed salary.
  For  example,  under this proposed legislation a Tier 2 Police Officer
 1st Grade who holds such position for at least 25, or  30,  years  would
 receive  an  increase  in  their annual pension benefit of approximately
 $4,300 or $12,200 per year, respectively,  due  to  the  higher  assumed
 pensionable salary.
  Based  on an estimate of the number of POLICE members who are expected
 to be impacted by the increased pensionable salary, it is estimated that
 if this proposed legislation is enacted, the annual increase  in  POLICE
 pension  benefits  paid  will be approximately $0.7 million in the first
 year and increase in every year thereafter.
  With respect to an individual member, the impact on  benefits  due  to
 this  proposed  legislation could vary greatly depending on the member's
 age, years of service, retirement cause, and Tier.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods to be used for
 the  Preliminary Fiscal Year 2025 employer contributions of the impacted
 retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  * Future contribution impacts have been developed assuming a homogene-
 ous population and consistent retirement pattern.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

  Section 1. Section 343 of the retirement and social  security  law  is
 amended by adding a new subdivision i to read as follows:
  I. 1. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO THE CONTRA-
 RY,  FOR  ANY POLICE OFFICER EMPLOYED BY THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
 IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE CITY  OF  NEW  YORK
 TRANSFERRING  FROM THE NEW YORK CITY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM TO THE
 NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE  RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  AFTER  THE
 EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  AND  ANY POLICE OFFICER FORMERLY
 EMPLOYED BY THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT  OF  ENVI-
 RONMENTAL  PROTECTION IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK HAVING MADE SUCH TRANSFER,
 SUCH POLICE OFFICER'S DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE  DEPARTMENT  OF
 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK SERVICE CREDIT SHALL BE
 DEEMED CREDITABLE SERVICE, IN SUCH POLICE OFFICER'S TWENTY YEAR OR TWEN-
 TY-FIVE  YEAR  RETIREMENT PLAN, IF SUCH POLICE OFFICER HAS SERVED FOR AT
 LEAST TWO YEARS IN SUCH EMPLOYMENT AND IF, WITHIN ONE YEAR OF  THE  DATE
 ON WHICH HE OR SHE FIRST BECAME A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL
 POLICE  AND  FIRE  RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE
 DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION, SUCH MEMBER ELECTS TO DO SO.
  2. THE AMOUNT OF SUCH SERVICE CREDITED TO THE MEMBER IN THE  NEW  YORK
 STATE  AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN SHALL NOT EXCEED
 THE AMOUNT OF SERVICE CREDITED TO  THE  MEMBER  IN  THE  NEW  YORK  CITY
 EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN.
  3.  IF THE MEMBER SUBSEQUENTLY RETIRES ON AN AGE-BASED RETIREMENT PLAN
 IN THE NEW YORK STATE  AND  LOCAL  POLICE  AND  FIRE  RETIREMENT  SYSTEM
 INSTEAD  OF  A  TWENTY YEAR OR TWENTY-FIVE YEAR PLAN, THE FULL AMOUNT OF
 SERVICE CREDIT EARNED, AS A POLICE OFFICER EMPLOYED BY THE  DIVISION  OF
 LAW  ENFORCEMENT  IN  THE  DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE
 CITY OF NEW YORK SHALL BE GRANTED.
  4. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT
 OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK SERVICE CREDITED  TO
 A  MEMBER  OF  THE  NEW  YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT
 SYSTEM PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION EXCEED A TOTAL OF TEN YEARS.
  5. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW IN THIS SECTION  TO  THE
 CONTRARY,  THE  RESERVE  ON  SUCH MEMBER'S BENEFITS SHALL BE TRANSFERRED
 FROM THE NEW YORK CITY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  TO  THE  NEW  YORK
 STATE  AND  LOCAL  POLICE  AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 SUBDIVISIONS C AND D OF THIS SECTION.
  6. NO MEMBER WHO RECEIVES SERVICE CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS  SUBDIVISION
 SHALL  BE  ELIGIBLE  TO  RECEIVE  ADDITIONAL  SERVICE CREDIT PURSUANT TO
 SUBDIVISION B OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FOUR-E OF THIS ARTICLE  IF
 HIS OR HER EMPLOYER HAS ELECTED TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICE CREDIT.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would expand the  definition  of  service  creditable  under
 20-year  and  25-year  plans  in the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS) to include service transferred by  any
 S. 8305--C  88  A. 8805--C
 
 police  officer  employed  or  formerly  employed by the Division of Law
 Enforcement in the Department of Environmental Protection in the City of
 New York, provided that such police officer has at least  two  years  of
 such  employment.  The  member  must  elect to obtain the service credit
 within one year of the date on which they first became a member  of  the
 NYSLPFRS or within one year of the effective date of this bill, whichev-
 er  occurs  later. The amount of service credit received in the NYSLPFRS
 shall not exceed the minimum of the amount of service  credited  to  the
 member  in  the New York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) plan
 or 10 years.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024  Legislative  Session,  it  is
 estimated  that  the past service cost will average approximately 25% of
 an affected member's salary for each year of additional service that  is
 credited  on  a 20-year or 25-year plan. This cost will be offset by any
 reserves transferred from the NYCERS. The remaining cost will be  shared
 by  the  State  of  New  York  and  the  participating  employers in the
 NYSLPFRS.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.

 System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY:  This  proposed  legislation  would  allow  current or former
 NYCERS members employed as New York  City  Department  of  Environmental
 Protection  (DEP) police officers who transfer or transferred to the New
 York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS) to receive
 up to 10 years of service credit in the 20 or 25-year State Plans.

  CENSUS DATA: The number of members who have transferred or will trans-
 fer  to  PFRS  is  unknown.  The estimates presented herein are based on
 preliminary census data collected as of June 30, 2023. The  census  data
 for  the  potentially  impacted  population  used to develop the average
 costs in this Fiscal Note is based on DEP police officers  currently  in
 NYCERS  who  have  between two and 15 years of service and is summarized
 below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members

  - Average Age:  35.9
  - Average Service:  8.6
  - Average Salary:  79,400

  - Number Count:  23
  - Average Age:  39.8
  Term. Non-Vested Members
  - Number Count:  41
  - Average Age:  35.6
 
  BACKGROUND:  Currently, NYCERS members employed as DEP police officers
 who subsequently become employed by the State are eligible  to  transfer
 their  NYCERS  membership and receive service credit in the State plans,
 but generally do not receive service credit in the 20-year  and  25-year
 PFRS Plans.
  Under the proposed legislation, DEP police officers who served in such
 title  for a minimum of two years and then transfer their NYCERS member-
 ship to PFRS within one year of becoming a PFRS member (or one  year  of
 the  effective date, if later) would receive up to 10 years of credit in
 the 20-year and 25-year PFRS Plans for such equal DEP service.
  Currently, member accumulated contributions (with  accrued  interest),
 and  employer  paid  reserves  if  the  member  has at least 10 years of
 service, are transferred. Under the proposed legislation,  NYCERS  would
 be  required  to calculate and pay such member's pension reserve, net of
 any accumulated salary deductions otherwise transferred, to  PFRS,  even
 if the member has less than 10 years of service.
  It  should be noted that the proposed legislation does not provide for
 a reciprocal transfer of reserves should a member transfer from PFRS  to
 NYCERS with less than 10 years of service.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  For  purposes  of  this  Fiscal  Note,  it  has  been assumed that the
 impacted NYCERS members  would  generally  not  have  transferred  their
 membership to PFRS absent this proposed legislation. It has been further
 assumed that members with more than 15 years of service would not trans-
 fer their membership even under the proposed legislation.
  The  number of members who will benefit in the future from this fiscal
 note is unknown. The cost of this proposed legislation could vary great-
 ly depending on the number of future members who benefit and,  on  their
 plan, length of service, age, and salary history.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

  PART KK
 
  Section  1.  The  second  undesignated  paragraph  of subdivision a of
 section 517 of the retirement and social security  law,  as  amended  by
 section  1  of  part SS of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, is amended to
 read as follows:
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, during each of  the  first  three  plan
 years  (April  first  to  March  thirty-first)  in which such member has
 established membership in  the  New  York  state  and  local  employees'
 retirement  system,  such member shall contribute a percentage of annual
 wages in accordance with the preceding schedule based upon a  projection
 of annual wages provided by the employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 when  determining the rate at which each such member who became a member
 of the New York state and local employees' retirement system on or after
 April first, two thousand twelve shall  contribute  for  any  plan  year
 (April  first  to  March thirty-first) between April first, two thousand
 twenty-two and April first, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SIX,  such
 rate  shall be determined by reference to employees annual base wages of
 such member in the second plan year (April first to March  thirty-first)
 preceding  such current plan year. Base wages shall include regular pay,
 shift differential pay, location pay, and any increased hiring rate pay,
 but shall not include any overtime payments.
  § 2. The second undesignated paragraph of paragraph 1 and  the  second
 undesignated  paragraph  of  paragraph  2  of  subdivision a, the second
 undesignated paragraph of subdivision  f  and  the  second  undesignated
 paragraph  of  subdivision g of section 613 of the retirement and social
 security law, as amended by section 2 of part SS of chapter  56  of  the
 laws of 2022, are amended to read as follows:
  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  during  each of the first three plan
 years (April first to March thirty-first, except for members of New York
 city employees' retirement system, New York  city  teachers'  retirement
 system and New York city board of education retirement system, plan year
 shall  mean  January first through December thirty-first commencing with
 the January first next succeeding the effective  date  of  chapter  five
 hundred  ten  of  the laws of two thousand fifteen) in which such member
 has established membership in a public retirement system of  the  state,
 such  member shall contribute a percentage of annual wages in accordance
 with the preceding schedule based upon  a  projection  of  annual  wages
 provided  by the employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when determin-
 ing the rate at which each such member who became a member  of  the  New
 York state and local employees' retirement system, New York city employ-
 ees'  retirement  system,  New York city teachers' retirement system and
 New York city board of education retirement system, on  or  after  April
 first,  two  thousand  twelve  shall contribute for any plan year (April
 first to March thirty-first, except for members of  the  New  York  city
 employees'  retirement system, New York city teachers' retirement system
 and New York city board of education retirement system, plan year  shall
 mean January first through December thirty-first commencing with January
 first  next succeeding the effective date of chapter five hundred ten of
 the laws of two thousand fifteen)  between  April  first,  two  thousand
 twenty-two  and April first, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SIX, such
 S. 8305--C  92  A. 8805--C
 
 rate shall be determined by reference to employees annual base wages  of
 such  member in the second plan year (April first to March thirty-first)
 preceding such current plan year. Base wages shall include regular  pay,
 shift differential pay, location pay, and any increased hiring rate pay,
 but  shall  not include any overtime payments or compensation earned for
 extracurricular programs or any other pensionable earnings paid in addi-
 tion to the annual base wages.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, during each of  the  first  three  plan
 years  (April  first to March thirty-first, provided, however, that plan
 year shall mean January first through December  thirty-first  commencing
 with  the  January  first  next succeeding the effective date of chapter
 five hundred ten of the laws of two  thousand  fifteen)  in  which  such
 member  has  established  membership  in  the  New  York city employees'
 retirement system, such member shall contribute a percentage  of  annual
 wages  in accordance with the preceding schedule based upon a projection
 of annual wages provided by the employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 when determining the rate at which each such member who became a  member
 of, New York city employees' retirement system, on or after April first,
 two  thousand  twelve shall contribute for any plan year (April first to
 March thirty-first, provided, however, that plan year shall mean January
 first through December thirty-first commencing with  the  January  first
 next  succeeding  the  effective date of chapter five hundred ten of the
 laws of two thousand fifteen) between April first, two thousand  twenty-
 two  and  April  first, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SIX, such rate
 shall be determined by reference to employees annual base wages of  such
 member  in  the  second  plan  year  (April first to March thirty-first)
 preceding such current plan year. Base wages shall include regular  pay,
 shift differential pay, location pay, and any increased hiring rate pay,
 but shall not include any overtime payments.
  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  during  each of the first three plan
 years (April first to March  thirty-first)  in  which  such  member  has
 established  membership  in  the  New  York  state  and local employees'
 retirement system, such member shall contribute a percentage  of  annual
 wages  in accordance with the preceding schedule based upon a projection
 of annual wages provided by the employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 when determining the rate at which each such member who became a  member
 of the New York state and local employees' retirement system on or after
 April  first,  two  thousand  twelve  shall contribute for any plan year
 (April first to March thirty-first) between April  first,  two  thousand
 twenty-two  and April first, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SIX, such
 rate shall be determined by reference to employees annual base wages  of
 such  member in the second plan year (April first to March thirty-first)
 preceding such current plan year. Base wages shall include regular  pay,
 shift differential pay, location pay, and any increased hiring rate pay,
 but shall not include any overtime payments.
  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  during  each of the first three plan
 years (July first to June thirtieth) in which  such  member  has  estab-
 lished  membership  in  the  New York state teachers' retirement system,
 such member shall contribute a percentage of annual wages in  accordance
 with  the  preceding  schedule  based  upon a projection of annual wages
 provided by the employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when  determin-
 ing the contribution rate at which a member of the New York state teach-
 ers'  retirement  system  with  a  date  of membership on or after April
 first, two thousand twelve shall contribute for plan years  (July  first
 to  June thirtieth) between July first, two thousand twenty-two and July
 first, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SIX, such rate shall be  deter-
 S. 8305--C  93  A. 8805--C
 
 mined  by reference to the member's annual base wages in the second plan
 year (July first to June thirtieth) preceding such  current  plan  year.
 Annual base wages shall not include compensation earned for extracurric-
 ular  programs or any other pensionable earnings paid in addition to the
 annual base wages.
  § 3. The second undesignated paragraph of section 1204 of the  retire-
 ment  and  social  security  law,  as amended by section 3 of part SS of
 chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, during each of  the  first  three  plan
 years  (April  first  to  March  thirty-first)  in which such member has
 established membership in the New York state and local police  and  fire
 retirement  system,  such member shall contribute a percentage of annual
 wages in accordance with the preceding schedule based upon a  projection
 of annual wages provided by the employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 when  determining the rate at which each such member who became a member
 of the New York state and local police and fire retirement system on  or
 after  April  first,  two  thousand twelve shall contribute for any plan
 year (April first to March thirty-first) between April first, two  thou-
 sand  twenty-two and April first, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SIX,
 such rate shall be determined by  reference  to  employees  annual  base
 wages of such member in the second plan year (April first to March thir-
 ty-first)  preceding  such  current plan year.  Base wages shall include
 regular pay, shift differential pay, location  pay,  and  any  increased
 hiring  rate pay, but shall not include any overtime payments. Effective
 April first, two thousand twelve, all members subject to the  provisions
 of  this  article  shall not be required to make member contributions on
 annual wages excluded from  the  calculation  of  final  average  salary
 pursuant  to  section  twelve  hundred three of this article. Nothing in
 this section, however, shall be construed or deemed to allow members  to
 receive a refund of any member contributions on such wages paid prior to
 April first, two thousand twelve.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  exclude  overtime pay from the annual wages used to
 determine the variable member contribution rate for Tier  6  members  of
 the  New  York  State  and  Local Retirement System during the period of
 April 1, 2024 to April 1, 2026.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  (NYSLERS),  if  this bill is enacted during the 2024
 Legislative Session, we anticipate that there will be an increase in the
 present value of benefits of approximately $36 million  which  would  be
 shared  by  the State of New York and all participating employers in the
 NYSLERS. The annual contribution required would  be  approximately  $1.3
 million  to  the State of New York and approximately $1.9 million to the
 local participating employers. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will  vary  in
 subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of
 the affected members.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), if this bill is  enacted  during  the
 2024  Legislative  Session, we anticipate that there will be an increase
 in the present value of benefits of approximately $7 million which would
 be shared by the State of New York and all  participating  employers  in
 the  NYSLPFRS.  The  annual contribution required would be approximately
 $0.1 million to the State of New York and approximately $0.4 million  to
 the  local participating employers. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary
 S. 8305--C  94  A. 8805--C
 
 in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary
 of the affected members.
  In  addition to the costs discussed above, implementing the provisions
 of this legislation would generate administrative costs.
  The exact number of current members who  could  be  affected  by  this
 legislation cannot be readily determined.

 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated March 1, 2024, and intended for use  only  during
 the  2024 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No.  2024-111, prepared by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As it relates to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System,  this
 bill  would  amend Section 613 of the Retirement and Social Security Law
 to extend the period  during  which  the  calculation  of  the  employee
 contribution  rate  for  Tier 6 members is to be determined using only a
 member's annual base wages and would not include compensation earned for
 extracurricular programs or any other pensionable earnings paid in addi-
 tion to the annual base wages. This provision would be extended for  two
 additional  fiscal  years, those ending June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2026.
 The current expiration date of this provision is the fiscal year  ending
 June 20, 2024.
  The  estimated  cost for using only annual base wages to determine the
 employee contribution rate for Tier 6 members during 2025  and  2026  is
 projected  to be $9.2 million, over the two-year period, if this bill is
 enacted. This is not a recurring annual cost,  but  rather  a  temporary
 cost  due to the projected decrease in employee contributions to be made
 during the two fiscal years ending June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2026.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the

 tions and methods are  provided  in  the  System's  Actuarial  Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.

 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2024

 Basic Member Contribution Rates for two additional years.

  BACKGROUND:  Tier  6  members of NYCERS, TRS, and BERS are required to
 make Basic Member Contributions (BMC) ranging from 3% to 6% depending on
 the members' respective annual wages two calendar  years  prior.  Annual
 wages  include  overtime  up  to a certain limit that increases annually
 based on inflation ($19,729 for calendar year 2023).
  Part SS of Chapter 56 of  the  Laws  of  2022  excluded  overtime  and
 compensation  earned for supplemental work for determining future Tier 6
 BMC rates for the period of April 1, 2022 through April 1, 2024 (NYCERS,
 TRS, and BERS are subject to a calendar plan year).
  The proposed legislation would extend the exclusion  of  overtime  and
 compensation  earned  for  supplemental  work for determining Tier 6 BMC
 rates through April 1, 2026.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
