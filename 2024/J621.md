  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 7, 2023, as Purple Heart Day in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of the Armed Services from the State of New York,
who have served so  valiantly  and  honorably  in  wars  in  which  this
country's  freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation of peace
in peacetime, deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body  is  moved  to  memorialize  Governor
Kathy  Hochul to proclaim Monday, August 7, 2023, as Purple Heart Day in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  National
Purple Heart Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Purple Heart Medal is the oldest military decoration in
the world in present use, and is awarded in the name of the President of
the United States to members of the United States military who have been
wounded or killed in action; it was created by General George Washington
as  a  way  to  honor  and thank the brave soldiers who fought under his
command for the independence of our great Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the Military Order of  the  Purple  Heart,  an
organization  for  combat-wounded  veterans,  the  medal  is "the oldest
military decoration in the world in present use and the first award made
available to a common soldier"; and
 
  WHEREAS, On August 7, 1782, during the  Revolutionary  War,  General
George  Washington  issued  an order establishing a badge of distinction
for meritorious action; the badge, which consisted of a  heart  made  of
purple  cloth,  is  known  to  have been awarded to three sergeants from
Connecticut regiments; and
 
  WHEREAS, Known as  the  Badge  of  Military  Merit,  the  award  was
distinctive  because  it was available to the lower ranks at a time when
only officers were  eligible  for  decoration  in  European  armies;  in
creating  this appropriately exalted honor General Washington wrote "The
road to glory in a patriot army is thus open to all."; and
 
  WHEREAS, Although not continued after  the  Revolutionary  War,  the
decoration was reinstated by the U.S. War Department, now the Department
of  Defense,  on  February  22,  1932,  the  200th anniversary of George
Washington's birth; and
 
  WHEREAS, From the days of General George  Washington,  our  nation's
military  leaders  have  awarded  the  Purple  Heart  in the name of the
President of the United States to honor almost two million Americans who
have been wounded in battle or killed in action; and
 
  WHEREAS, As Americans, it is our responsibility to ensure  that  our
history  is  documented  and  reverence  is  given to our war heroes who
served this great Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The freedoms and security we cherish as Americans come at a
very high price for those serving in the military;  it  is  fitting  and
proper  that  we,  who are the beneficiaries of the courage of those who
risk  their  lives,  leaving  their  families  behind,  express  our
appreciation  and  eternal gratitude for their sacrifices and courageous
acts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim August 7, 2023, as Purple
Heart Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
