 Section  1.  Subdivision  7  of section 163 of the state finance law, as

  7. Method of procurement. Consistent with the requirements of subdivi-
 sions  three and four of this section, state agencies shall select among
 permissible methods of procurement including, but  not  limited  to,  an
 invitation for bid, request for proposals or other means of solicitation
 pursuant  to  guidelines  issued by the state procurement council. State
 agencies may accept bids  electronically  including  submission  of  the
 statement of non-collusion required by section one hundred thirty-nine-d
 of  this chapter, and the statement of certification required by section
 one hundred thirty-nine-l of this chapter[, and, starting  April  first,
 two  thousand  twelve,  and  ending  March  thirty-first,  two  thousand
 fifteen, may, for commodity, service and  technology  contracts  require
 electronic  submission as the sole method for the submission of bids for
 the solicitation.  State agencies shall undertake no more  than  eighty-
 five  such  electronic bid solicitations, none of which shall be reverse
 auctions, prior to April first, two thousand fifteen. In addition, state
 agencies may conduct up to twenty reverse  auctions  through  electronic
 means,  prior  to  April first, two thousand fifteen. Prior to requiring
 S. 4005--C  20  A. 3005--C

 the electronic submission of bids, the  agency  shall  make  a  determi-
 nation,  which shall be documented in the procurement record, that elec-
 tronic submission affords a fair and equal opportunity for  offerers  to
 submit  responsive offers.  Within thirty days of the completion of the
 eighty-fifth electronic bid solicitation, or by April first,  two  thou-
 sand  fifteen,  whichever  is  earlier, the commissioner shall prepare a
 report assessing the use of electronic submissions and make  recommenda-
 tions  regarding  future  use  of  this procurement method. In addition,
 within thirty days of the completion of the  twentieth  reverse  auction
 through  electronic  means,  or  by  April  first, two thousand fifteen,
 whichever is earlier, the commissioner shall prepare a report  assessing
 the  use of reverse auctions through electronic means and make recommen-
 dations regarding future use of this procurement  method.  Such  reports
 shall  be  published  on the website of the office of general services].
 Except where otherwise provided by law, procurements  shall  be  compet-
 itive,  and state agencies shall conduct formal competitive procurements
 to the maximum extent practicable. State  agencies  shall  document  the
 determination of the method of procurement and the basis of award in the
 procurement  record.  Where the basis for award is the best value offer,
 the state agency shall  document,  in  the  procurement  record  and  in
 advance of the initial receipt of offers, the determination of the eval-
 uation criteria, which whenever possible, shall be quantifiable, and the
 process  to be used in the determination of best value and the manner in
 which the evaluation process and selection shall be conducted.
  § 2. Subdivision 7-a of section  163  of  the  state  finance  law  is

 CHAPTER, AND MAY REQUIRE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES ON ALL DOCUMENTS REQUIRED
 FOR  SUBMISSION  OF  A  BID,  ANY  RESULTING  CONTRACTS,  AND  REQUIRED
 SUBMISSIONS  DURING  THE  TERM  OF  ANY CONTRACT. PRIOR TO REQUIRING THE
 ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF BIDS, THE AGENCY SHALL  MAKE  A  DETERMINATION,
 WHICH  SHALL  BE  DOCUMENTED  IN THE PROCUREMENT RECORD, THAT ELECTRONIC
 SUBMISSION AFFORDS A FAIR AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR OFFERERS  TO  SUBMIT
 RESPONSIVE  OFFERS,  AND THAT THE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE COMPLIES WITH THE
 PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE THREE OF THE STATE TECHNOLOGY LAW.
  7-B. ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX, THE COMMIS-

  PART S
 
  Section  1.  Section 57 of the civil service law, as added by chapter
 83 of the laws of 1963, is amended to read as follows:
  § 57. Continuous recruitment for  certain  positions.  Notwithstanding
 any other provisions of this chapter or any other law, the civil service
 department or a municipal commission may establish a continuing eligible
 list  for  any class of positions for which it finds [inadequate numbers
 of well qualified persons available for recruitment] SUCH  LISTS  APPRO-
 PRIATE.  THE  CIVIL  SERVICE  DEPARTMENT MAY ONLY ESTABLISH CONTINUING
 ELIGIBLE LISTS FOR ANY CLASS OF POSITIONS FILLED  THROUGH  OPEN  COMPET-
 ITIVE  EXAMINATION.  Names  of  eligibles shall be inserted in such list
 from time to time as applicants are tested and found qualified in  exam-
 inations  held  at  such  intervals  as  may  be prescribed by the civil
 service department or municipal  commission  having  jurisdiction.  Such
 successive examinations shall, so far as practicable, be constructed and
 rated  so  as  to be equivalent tests of the merit and fitness of candi-
 dates. The name of any candidate who passes any such examination and who
 is otherwise qualified shall be placed on the continuing  eligible  list
 in  the  rank  corresponding to his OR HER final rating on such examina-
 tion. The period of eligibility of  successful  candidates  for  certif-
 ication  and appointment from such continuing eligible list, as a result
 of any such examination, shall be fixed by the civil service  department
 or  municipal  commission  but,  except as a list may reach an announced
 terminal date, such period shall not be less than one  year;  nor  shall
 such period of eligibility exceed four years. Subject to such conditions
 and  limitations as the civil service department or municipal commission
 S. 4005--C  22  A. 3005--C
 
 may prescribe, a candidate may take  more  than  one  such  examination;
 provided,  however, that no such candidate shall be certified simultane-
 ously with more than one rank on  the  continuing  eligible  list.  With
 respect to any candidate who applies for and is granted additional cred-
 it  in  any  such examination as a disabled or non-disabled veteran, and
 for the limited purpose of granting such additional credit, the eligible
 list shall be deemed to be established on the date on which his  OR  HER
 name is added thereto.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART T
 
  Section  1. Subdivision 1 of section 55-b of the civil service law, as
 amended by chapter 603 of the laws  of  1995,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1. The commission may determine up to [twelve] SEVENTEEN hundred posi-
 tions with duties such as can be performed by persons with a physical or
 mental disability who are found otherwise qualified to perform satisfac-
 torily the duties of any such position. Upon such determination the said
 positions  shall  be  classified in the noncompetitive class, and may be
 filled only by persons who shall have been  certified  by  the  employee
 health  service  of the department as being a person with either a phys-
 ical or mental disability.  The number of persons appointed pursuant  to
 this section shall not exceed [twelve] SEVENTEEN hundred.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  Section  1.  Section  2  of  part HH of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022
 amending the retirement and social  security  law  relating  to  waiving
 approval and income limitations on retirees employed in school districts
 and  board  of  cooperative  educational services, is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY,  NONE
 OF  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  ACT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO SECTION 25 OF THE
 RETIREMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY LAW.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed June 30, [2023] 2024.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Retirement
 System (NYSLRS), this bill would allow retirees employed by a  New  York
 State  school  district  or  by  the  board  of  cooperative educational
 services (BOCES) to collect a salary without suspension or diminution of
 their pension benefit through June 30, 2024. Currently, the post-retire-
 ment earnings limit is $35,000. Waivers to that post-retirement earnings
 limitation are only provided after the employer engages  in  a  rigorous
 application  process,  including failed efforts to locate qualified non-
 retired individuals, requiring approval by the  Commissioner  of  Educa-
 tion,  and  the retiree so hired did not work with the employer prior to
 retirement.
 S. 4005--C  23  A. 3005--C
 
  If this bill were enacted during the  2023  legislative  session,  the
 direct cost incurred would be the retiree's post-retirement earnings for
 the  period  July  1, 2023 through June 30, 2024, not to exceed the full
 pension benefit paid by the NYSLRS during that period.
  The  number  of  members  and  retirees  who could be affected by this
 legislation cannot be readily determined. For each retiree hired  pursu-
 ant  to  this  proposal, an annual cost of $35,000 is expected. If large
 numbers of retirees are hired into such  positions,  significant  annual
 costs would result.
  All  costs will be shared by the State of New York and all participat-
 ing employers in the NYSLRS and spread over future billing cycles. Since
 this proposal exclusively benefits retirees,  the  increased  costs  are
 primarily  attributable to retirees from Tiers 1 - 4. Approximately half
 the contributions required to fund this proposal will  be  collected  on
 salary reported for current members of Tier 6.
  Summary of relevant resources:

 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the

  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated March 30, 2023, and intended for use only  during
 the  2023  Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2023-128, prepared by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend section 2 of Part HH of Chapter 56 of  the  Laws
 of  2022 to extend the waiver of the earnings-after-retirement limit for
 one year for retirees of the New York State Teachers' Retirement  System
 to  June  30, 2024. The current expiration date is June 30, 2023 for the
 waiver of this limit. This act shall take effect immediately  and  shall
 be  deemed  repealed  on June 30, 2024. Retirees must be employed with a
 school district or a board of cooperative educational services  (BOCES).
 There  is  no  earnings-after-retirement  limit for retirees aged 65 and
 older.
  It is estimated that there will be no additional annual  cost  to  the
 employers  of  members of the New York State Teachers' Retirement System
 if this bill is enacted.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System. Data distributions and statistics can be found in  the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would revise the terms of  participation  in  the  New  York
 State  and  Local Retirement Systems (NYSLRS) Contribution Stabilization
 Program (CSP). Participating employers in the NYSLRS may enter  the  CSP
 to  reduce  volatility  in  average  annual  contribution  rates. Should
 employer billing rates increase rapidly, the CSP allows a portion of the
 increase to be amortized over 10 years for the regular CSP or  12  years
 for  the alternative CSP.  Should employer billing rates decrease rapid-
 ly, the CSP requires  employers  to  make  an  additional  contribution,
 called  a graded payment. The graded payment is deposited into an inter-
 est-bearing reserve fund held within the NYSLRS for the exclusive use by
 the employer to reduce future amortizations.
  This bill revises the CSP in the following ways:
  1) Limits the value of the reserve fund assets. Graded payments  would
 cease  when  the  employer's  reserve  fund assets exceed the employer's
 actuarial contribution in the prior fiscal year. Currently, the  reserve
 fund is capped at 100% of the employer's payroll.
  2)  Creates  provisions  for  termination  from  the  CSP,  subject to
 approval by the Comptroller, provided all prior year  amortizations  are
 paid  in  full,  including interest. Beginning the fiscal year following
 termination, the employer would not be required (or allowed) to  make  a
 graded payment. Any existing reserve fund assets would be used to reduce
 future  annual  bills up to the amount the employer would have been able
 to amortize if still in the program.  The employer would be permitted to
 re-enter the regular CSP only if  eligible  to  amortize,  provided  all
 reserve fund assets are depleted.
  3)  Allows  an  employer  to  utilize its reserve fund assets to pay a
 portion of  its  annual  bill  when  the  employer's  average  actuarial
 contribution  rate  exceeds  the employer's graded rate.  Currently, the
 employer's average actuarial rate must exceed the System graded rate.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate some administrative costs to  implement  the  provisions  of  this
 legislation.

 such owner or lessee, may apply to such  department  of  small  business
 services  for certification that such building or structure is an eligi-
 ble building or targeted  eligible  building  meeting  the  criteria  of

 issued  for the construction or renovation required by such subdivisions
 and before the first day of July, two  thousand  [twenty-three]  TWENTY-

 an  applicant  shall  supplement such application to provide information
 (i) establishing that the criteria of such subdivision (a) or  (q)  have
 been  met;  (ii)  establishing  a  basis  for  determining the amount of
 special rebates, including a basis for  an  allocation  of  the  special

 receipt  and  review  of  such information and upon a determination that
 such information establishes that the building or structure qualifies as
 an eligible building or  targeted  eligible  building.  Such  department
 shall  mail  such  certification or notice thereof to the applicant upon
 issuance. Such certification shall remain in effect provided the  eligi-
 ble redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of ener-
 gy  reports any changes that materially affect the amount of the special
 rebates to which it is entitled or the amount of reduction  required  by
 subdivision  (c) of this section in an energy services bill of an eligi-
 ble revitalization area energy user  and  otherwise  complies  with  the
 requirements  of  this article. Such department shall notify the private
 utility or public utility service required to make a special  rebate  to
 such  redistributor  of the amount of such special rebate established at
 the time of certification and any changes in such amount and any suspen-
 sion or termination by  such  department  of  certification  under  this
 subdivision.  Such department may require some or all of the information
 required as part of an application or other  report  be  provided  by  a
 licensed engineer.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would modify the in-service death  benefit  for  Westchester
 County  correction  officers  in Tiers 2 through 6. The in-service death
 benefit will be the value of the pension reserve as if  the  member  had
 retired on their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $110,000 in the
 annual contributions of Westchester County for the  fiscal  year  ending
 March  31,  2024.  In  future  years, this cost will vary as the billing
 rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $812,000 which  will  be
 borne by Westchester County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes
 that  payment  will  be  made on February 1, 2024. If Westchester County
 elects to amortize this cost over a 10-year period,  the  cost  for  the
 first year including interest would be $104,000.
  These  estimated  costs  are based on 821 affected members employed by
 Westchester County, with annual salary of approximately $103 million  as
 of March 31, 2022.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2022 actuari-
 al valuation.  Distributions and other statistics can be  found  in  the
 2022  Report  of the Actuary and the 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.

 THIRTEEN OF THIS CHAPTER OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend  subdivision  c
 of section 513 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to allow
 New  York  City  Fire  Pension Fund (FIRE) members subject to Article 14
 (Tier 3, Tier 3 Modified, and Tier 3 Enhanced) to obtain service  credit
 for  service  rendered as an emergency medical technician (EMT) with the
 New York City Employee's Retirement System (NYCERS).
  The EMT service credit with NYCERS must immediately precede service in
 FIRE. If properly transferred or purchased, such service shall be deemed
 S. 4005--C  40  A. 3005--C
 
 as pensionable service for purposes of determining the  eligibility  for
 benefits and benefit amounts in FIRE.
  Upon  attaining  eligible  service  credit with FIRE, the member would
 relinquish prior membership and applicable benefits with NYCERS.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS/PAYABILITY: Currently, the purchase or transfer  of
 service  rendered  as a NYCERS EMT member does not provide an additional
 service retirement benefit for FIRE members subject to Article 14.
  Under the proposed legislation, EMT service transferred  or  purchased
 would  count for purposes of determining benefit amounts and eligibility
 in FIRE and would increase and/or  accelerate  the  payability  date  of
 benefits.
  MEMBER  CONTRIBUTIONS:  Member contributions as defined in Article 14,
 plus 5.0% annual interest, for  EMT  service  purchased  or  transferred
 would apply.
  Member  contributions  made  as  a  NYCERS EMT member in excess of the
 amount required would, if not otherwise utilized for a  separate  vested
 benefit, be refunded with 5.0% annual interest.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census data and the
 actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of
 this  proposed  legislation  would  result in an increase in the present
 value of future employer contributions of approximately $19.3 million.
  This net increase is a result of an increase in the Present  Value  of
 Future  Benefits (PVFB) of approximately $16.7 million and a decrease in
 the present value of member contributions of approximately $2.6 million.
  Under the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the  employer
 contributions  to  FIRE,  there  would  be  an  increase in the Unfunded
 Accrued Liability (UAL) of  approximately  $40.6  million  offset  by  a
 decrease in the present value of future employer Normal Cost of approxi-
 mately $21.3 million.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer contributions of approximately $3.9 million which is the result
 of  a decrease in the Normal Cost offset by the UAL payment. The average
 annual employer cost per member included in this fiscal note is approxi-
 mately $3,100.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 19 years
 and the increase in UAL was therefore amortized over  a  19-year  period
 (18  payments  under  the  One-Year  Lag Methodology) using level dollar
 payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of FIRE to determine
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  There are an estimated 1,261 active FIRE Tier 3 members as of June 30,
 2022 who could potentially benefit  from  the  proposed  legislation  by
 purchasing or transferring service earned as an EMT member. These active
 members  had an average age of approximately 32.3 years, average service
 of approximately 5.3 years (before purchasing any  additional  service),
 and an average salary of approximately $98,500.
  On  average,  the  1,261  active  FIRE Tier 3 members would be able to
 purchase 3.0 years of service earned as an EMT member with an  estimated
 purchase cost of $7,400 per former EMT member as of June 30, 2022.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated  based  on  the actuarial assumptions and methods to be
 S. 4005--C  41  A. 3005--C
 
 used for the Preliminary Fiscal  Year  2024  employer  contributions  of
 FIRE.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of  FIRE  used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  * The employer costs for service  purchased  by  future  FIRE  Tier  3
 members  for  service  earned as an EMT member. However, as noted above,
 the average annual employer cost per member included in this Fiscal Note
 is approximately $3,100.
  * The  initial,  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  *  The  impact  of  this  proposed legislation on Other Postemployment
 Benefit costs.

 Actuary  for,  and  independent of, the New York City Retirement Systems
 and Pension Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries  and  a

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  modify  the in-service death benefit for retirement
 eligible members of the New York State and Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System  who  are  employed  by Nassau County in certain fire marshal job
 titles. The in-service death benefit will be the value  of  the  pension
 reserve as if the member had retired on their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $5,400 in the
 annual contributions of Nassau County for the fiscal year  ending  March
 31,  2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $48,700  which  will  be
 borne by Nassau County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment  will  be  made  on February 1, 2024. If Nassau County elects to
 S. 4005--C  47  A. 3005--C

 amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for  the  first  year
 including interest would be $6,220.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based on 44 affected members employed by
 Nassau County, with annual salary of approximately $5.0  million  as  of
 March 31, 2022.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2022 actuari-
 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend the Retirement
 and Social Security Law (RSSL) to permit Tier 3,  Tier  3  Revised,  and
 Tier  3 Enhanced members (who are subject to Article 14) of the New York
 S. 4005--C  49  A. 3005--C
 
 City Police Pension Fund (POLICE) to take loans  against  their  accumu-
 lated total member contributions with interest.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  BACKGROUND:  Tier 1 and Tier 2 members of POLICE are generally permit-
 ted, subject to certain restrictions, to borrow from  their  accumulated
 Basic  Member Contributions (BMC) with interest. However, Tier 3, Tier 3
 Revised, and Tier 3 Enhanced members are currently not permitted to take
 loans on their contributions.
  The proposed legislation would permit Tier 3, Tier 3 Revised, and Tier
 3 Enhanced members of POLICE to  borrow  from  their  accumulated  total
 member  contributions,  which  include  Enhanced  Plan Additional Member
 Contributions (AMC). Loans may be taken no more than once  a  year,  and
 the  dollar  amount  is subject to minimum and maximum restrictions. For
 members with a date of membership before January 1,  2018,  the  members
 may  take out a loan up to 75% of their total contributions plus accumu-
 lated interest. For members with a date of membership on and after Janu-
 ary 1, 2018, the loan is limited to 50% of their total  member  contrib-
 utions plus accumulated interest or $50,000, whichever is less.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT:  In the event an outstanding loan exists at retire-
 ment, the balance of the unpaid loan is converted to an annuity based on
 the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury  securities  and  deducted  from  the
 annual  retirement  allowance otherwise payable. This conversion is made
 on an actuarial basis that is different than the basis used to determine
 the employer contribution to POLICE. As a result of this  difference  in
 actuarial  bases  and based on the census data and actuarial assumptions
 and methods described herein, the enactment of this proposed legislation
 would increase the Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB)  by  approxi-
 mately $43.7 million.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to POLICE, there would be  an  increase  in  the  Unfunded
 Accrued  Liability  (UAL) of approximately $11.3 million and an increase
 in the Present Value of Future Employer  Normal  Cost  of  approximately
 $32.4 million.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer  contributions  of  approximately  $3.4  million. This increase
 consists of an increase in the  Normal  Cost  in  addition  to  the  UAL
 payment.
  Future  costs  will  vary  based on the amount of member contributions
 eligible for loans. Individual member balances are expected to increase,
 however in the future, a larger portion  of  the  membership  will  have
 membership  dates  on or after January 1, 2018, and therefore be limited
 to a maximum loan percentage  of  50%  and  a  maximum  loan  amount  of
 $50,000.
  New  UAL  attributable to benefit changes are generally amortized over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 18  years
 and  the  increase in UAL was therefore amortized over an 18-year period
 (17 payments under the One-Year  Lag  Methodology)  using  level  dollar
 payments.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of POLICE  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The  19,375  Tier  3,  Tier  3 Revised, and Tier 3 Enhanced members in
 POLICE as of June 30, 2022 had an  average  age  of  approximately  32.2
 S. 4005--C  50  A. 3005--C
 
 years, average service of approximately 5.7 years, and an average salary
 of approximately $101,600.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of POLICE.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of POLICE used to determine employer contributions for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  It  has  been  further assumed that the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury
 securities, on a long-term basis would equal 3.5% per year and that  25%
 of  member  balances  available for borrowing would be taken as loans at
 retirement.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.

 Actuary for, and independent of, the New York  City  Retirement  Systems
 and  Pension  Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries and a
 Member of the American Academy of Actuaries. I am a member of NYCERS but

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would permit members of the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees'  Retirement  System  (NYSLERS) who are employed by Monroe County in
 the title of deputy sheriff-civil,  as  certified  by  the  sheriff,  to
 retire  upon  completion of twenty-five (25) years of creditable service
 with a benefit of one-half (50%) final average salary,  provided  Monroe
 County  has  filed  a  resolution with the New York State Comptroller to
 provide such benefits on or before December 31, 2024. Additionally,  for
 those  members  covered  under  the  provisions of Article 14, this bill
 would permit an irrevocable election to forfeit the benefits of  Article
 14  in  favor  of  the  25-year  plan benefit, when elected on or before
 December 31, 2024 or within one year of entering  service  as  a  deputy
 sheriff-civil with Monroe County.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $24,000 in the
 annual contributions of Monroe County for the fiscal year  ending  March
 31,  2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $147,000 which  will  be
 borne by Monroe County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based  on 9 affected members employed by
 Monroe County, with annual salary of approximately $688,000 as of  March
 S. 4005--C  54  A. 3005--C
 
 31,  2022.  The  affected  members  were  identified  using  information
 provided by Andrew Toranzo of the New York State Minority Ways and Means
 Committee.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2022 actuari-
 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the

 special,  or  local  law to the contrary, any condition of impairment of
 health caused by diseases of the heart, resulting in disability or death
 to a police officer, presently employed, and who  shall  have  sustained
 such disability while so employed, shall be presumptive evidence that it

 CATIONS  FOR  DISABILITY RETIREMENT ALLOWANCES MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF A
 MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  OR

 DISEASE OF THE HEART, RESULTING  IN  DISABILITY,  SHALL  BE  PRESUMPTIVE
 EVIDENCE  THAT  SUCH  DISABILITY  WAS  INCURRED  IN  THE PERFORMANCE AND
 DISCHARGE OF DUTY AND THE NATURAL AND PROXIMATE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT.

 REBUTTED  ONLY  BY  COMPETENT  EVIDENCE  THAT  THE DISABILITY IS NOT THE
 NATURAL AND PROXIMATE RESULT OF THE PERFORMANCE AND DISCHARGE OF DUTY.
  § 3. The amendment made to subdivision  2  of  section  363-a  of  the

 (other than pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the retirement and  social
 security  law)  for  any member of a public retirement system or pension
 plan funded by the state or one of its political subdivisions, nor shall
 any amendment thereto affect  the  application  of  such  provisions  as
 extended  by  the provisions of section 480 of the retirement and social

  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to
  1. Eliminate certain eligibility requirements for awarding  accidental
 disability  benefits,  when the disability is related to diseases of the
 heart, for members in the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement
 System (NYSLERS) and the New  York  State  and  Local  Police  and  Fire
 Retirement  System  (NYSLPFRS).  Accidental disability benefits would be
 granted even where
  a. the member did not sustain an accident,
  b. the member's incapacitation is unrelated to any accident, or
  c. the member failed to provide notice thereof.
  The heart presumption could  continue  to  be  rebutted  by  competent
 evidence  that  the  disability is not the result of the performance and
 discharge of duty.
  2. Increase disability benefits payable  to  police  officers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS,  who  become  incapacitated  due  to diseases of the heart, by
 providing an accidental disability benefit equal to 75% of  salary  less
 workers'  compensation.  Currently,  police  officers are eligible for a
 performance-of-duty disability benefit equal to 50% of salary less work-
 ers' compensation.
  3. Increase the death benefits payable on behalf of a deceased  police
 officer in the NYSLPFRS, whose death results from diseases of the heart,
 by  providing  the  special  accidental death benefit equal to more than
 100% of salary less workers' compensation and social  security  benefits
 payable  to  an  eligible  beneficiary or beneficiaries.  Currently the
 death benefit would be the continuance afforded under  the  performance-
 of-duty disability retirement
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Retirement
 System (NYSLRS), more  accidental  disability  benefits  and  accidental
 death  benefits  would  be granted. The cost of the revised benefit will
 depend upon the applicant's age, service, salary, plan and  any  benefit
 type  otherwise  payable. Further, we anticipate that the administrative
 costs to the NYSLRS,  required  to  process  applications  and  litigate
 anticipated disputes, will increase.
  The  number  of  members  and  retirees  who could be affected by this
 legislation cannot be readily determined. However, every  active  member
 of  the  NYSLPFRS  will  be  covered,  as well as members of the NYSLERS
 S. 4005--C  56  A. 3005--C
 
 including uniformed court officers and peace officers  employed  by  the
 Unified Court System and fire marshals employed by Nassau County.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be increases of approximately $1.2 million and
 $4.3 million in the annual contributions  to  the  NYSLERS  and  to  the
 NYSLPFRS,  respectively,  for  the  fiscal  year  ending March 31, 2024.
 These costs will be shared by the State of New York (the State),  Nassau
 County,  and  other  local  participating  employers  in the NYSLPFRS as
 follows:
 
 Employer  payment to the  payment to the
  NYSLERS  NYSLPFRS
 the State  $1.2 million  $900,000
 Nassau County  $11,000
 all local participating
 employers in the NYSLPFRS  $3.4 million
 
  In future years, these annual costs will vary as  the  salary  of  the
 affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 immediate past service costs of approximately $12.5 million and $111,000
 which  will  be  borne  by the State and Nassau County, respectively, as
 one-time payments. This estimate assumes that payment will  be  made  by
 the  State  and  Nassau  County  on  March 1, 2024 and February 1, 2024,
 respectively.
  Estimated costs arising in the NYSLERS are  based  on  6,287  affected
 members with annual salary of approximately $573 million as of March 31,
 2022.
  Estimated  costs  arising in the NYSLPFRS are based on 32,169 affected
 members with annual salary of approximately $3.88 billion  as  of  March
 31, 2022.

 DESCENDANTS  OR  CULTURALLY-AFFILIATED  GROUP.  THE  COMMITTEE  OR STATE
 ARCHAEOLOGIST MAY USE A MEDIATOR, AT  NO  COST  TO  THE  PROPERTY  OWNER
