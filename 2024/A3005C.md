  Section 1. Section 2 of the volunteer firefighters'  benefit  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  476  of  the  laws  of 2018, is amended to read as
 follows:
 S. 4005  23  A. 3005
 
  § 2. Purpose.  One of the finest traditions of American community life
 is the service which people render  to  others  [without  remuneration].
 Volunteer firefighters have long been in the forefront of this group. In
 recognition of the unselfish service by these volunteers, government has
 undertaken  to  provide  for  them  and  their  families some measure of
 protection against loss from death or injuries in line of duty. Over the
 years there has developed a dual system of benefits when volunteer fire-
 fighters are killed or injured. The dual system has  caused  uncertainty
 and  confusion. This law establishes a new single system of benefits for
 volunteer firefighters and  provides  for  the  administration  of  such
 system  by  the  workers'  compensation  board  and the chairman of such
 board.
  It is hereby declared that this chapter is intended to effectuate  the
 objects  and  purposes  of  section eighteen of article one of the state
 constitution and that the relationship between the political subdivision
 liable for benefits under this chapter and a volunteer firefighter enti-
 tled to such benefits is that of employer and employee within the  mean-
 ing of such provision of the state constitution.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 3 of the volunteer firefighters' benefit
 law,  as  amended by chapter 458 of the laws of 1996, is amended to read
 as follows:
  3. "Line of duty" means the performance by a volunteer firefighter  as
 a volunteer firefighter of the duties and activities described in subdi-
 vision  one of section five of this chapter and the same such duties and
 activities performed for a specialized team established pursuant to  the
 provisions  of  section two hundred nine-bb of the general municipal law
 for which the volunteer firefighter does not receive any remuneration or
 a gratuity and shall be deemed to include any date of injury  as  deter-
 mined  by  the workers' compensation board pursuant to the provisions of
 section forty-one of this chapter. The following shall not be deemed  to
 be  remuneration  or a gratuity: PAYMENT OF A NOMINAL FEE AS OUTLINED IN
 SECTION TWO HUNDRED-AA OF THE GENERAL MUNICIPAL  LAW;  reimbursement  of
 expenses for meals, lodging and actual and necessary travel; the receipt
 of  a  mileage  allowance  in  lieu  of travel expense; reimbursement of
 expenses for registration and tuition fees payable under section  seven-
 ty-two-g of the general municipal law, and the acceptance of transporta-
 tion,  food, drink, shelter, clothing and similar items while on duty or
 engaged in such activities.
  § 3. The general municipal law is amended  by  adding  a  new  section
 200-aa to read as follows:
  §  200-AA.  NOMINAL FEE FOR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS. 1. FOR PURPOSES OF
 THIS SECTION:
  (A) "FIRE COMPANY" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS DEFINED  IN  SECTION
 THREE OF THE VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS' BENEFIT LAW.
  (B)  "NOMINAL  FEE"  MEANS  PAYMENT  TO  A  VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER OF A
 STIPEND OR A FEE FOR A PER CALL OR ON CALL BASIS.  THE  PAYMENT  OF  THE
 NOMINAL FEE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR COMPENSATION AND MUST NOT BE TIED TO
 PRODUCTIVITY.
  (C)  "VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS DEFINED IN
 SECTION THREE OF THE VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS' BENEFIT LAW.
  2. THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A CITY, TOWN, VILLAGE OR FIRE DISTRICT  MAY,
 BY  LOCAL  LAW,  ORDINANCE  OR  RESOLUTION,  AUTHORIZE A FIRE COMPANY TO
 PROVIDE NOMINAL FEES TO VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS FOR: (A)  RESPONSE  TO  A
 FIRE,  ALARM  OF FIRE, HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENT OR OTHER EMERGENCY TO
 WHICH THEIR FIRE DEPARTMENT, FIRE COMPANY, OR ANY UNIT  THEREOF,  EITHER
 HAS RESPONDED OR WOULD BE REQUIRED OR AUTHORIZED TO RESPOND; AND (B) FOR
 S. 4005  24  A. 3005

 COMPLETION  OF  CERTAIN  TRAINING,  AS  IDENTIFIED  AND PUBLISHED BY THE
 OFFICE OF FIRE PREVENTION AND CONTROL.
  3.  THE OFFICE OF FIRE PREVENTION AND CONTROL MAY MAKE AVAILABLE STATE

 FOR PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE.
  §  8.  Paragraph  (c) of subdivision 1 of section 205-g of the general
 municipal law, as added by chapter 559 of the laws of 2006,  is  amended

 and  shall  be deemed to include any date of injury as determined by the

 ment or company consents thereto. Any such contract may provide for  the
 S. 4005  25  A. 3005
 
 payment  of  a  portion  of  the consideration expressed therein to such
 volunteer fire department or company to be expended for fire  department

 of  the  fire  apparatus  to  be  used in carrying out the contract, the
 portion of the consideration which may be paid to  such  volunteer  fire
 department  or company shall not exceed thirty-five per centum, unless a
 greater portion was being so paid on March fifteenth,  nineteen  hundred
 forty-one,  under  a  contract  entered  into on or before that date, in
 which event a not greater portion than was being paid on said  date  may
 be  paid  to such volunteer fire department or company in respect to any

  PART K
 
  Section  1.  New  York's alcoholic beverage control law was enacted in
 1934. Since that time, the law has grown organically to meet the  chang-
 ing needs of the industry.  However, through that growth over the course
 of  nearly  a  century, the structure of the law has become unwieldy and
 S. 4005  28  A. 3005
 
 inconsistent.  Consequently, it is difficult for the industry and  regu-
 lators to understand, implement, enforce, and comply with the law.
  The  State  believes that with an open, transparent legislative review
 process, the alcoholic beverage control law can be  properly  rewritten.
 To  begin  the  process  of  modernizing  the state's alcoholic beverage
 control laws, the New York State  Liquor  Authority  ("SLA")  is  hereby
 directed to undertake a review of those laws and recommend changes. Such
 recommended  changes  shall  focus on clearly and rationally delineating
 policies, procedures, criteria, and legal standards that are in  current
 law  but  not  in an intelligible form. The SLA shall prepare an amended
 version of the law containing the proposed changes and post it on  their
 website for public review.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART L
 
  Section  1.  The alcoholic beverage control law is amended by adding a
 new section 97-d to read as follows:

 LIQUOR  AUTHORITY FOR A TEMPORARY PERMIT TO OPERATE ANY ALCOHOLIC BEVER-
 AGE WHOLESALE BUSINESS AS MAY  BE  LICENSED  UNDER  THIS  CHAPTER.  SUCH
 APPLICATION  SHALL BE IN WRITING AND VERIFIED AND SHALL CONTAIN INFORMA-
 TION AS THE LIQUOR AUTHORITY SHALL REQUIRE. SUCH  APPLICATION  SHALL  BE
 ACCOMPANIED BY A CHECK OR DRAFT IN THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE
 DOLLARS FOR SUCH PERMIT.
  2.  UPON  APPLICATION,  THE  LIQUOR AUTHORITY MAY ISSUE SUCH TEMPORARY

  (A) THE APPLICANT HAS A WHOLESALE  LICENSE  APPLICATION  AT  THE  SAME
 PREMISES PENDING BEFORE THE LIQUOR AUTHORITY, TOGETHER WITH ALL REQUIRED
 FILING AND LICENSE FEES;
  (B)  THE  APPLICANT HAS OBTAINED AND PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF ALL PERMITS,
 LICENSES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS NECESSARY FOR THE OPERATION OF SUCH A BUSI-
 NESS; AND
  (C) ANY CURRENT LICENSE IN EFFECT AT THE PREMISES THAT MAY  NOT  UNDER
 LAW  OPERATE CONCURRENTLY HAS BEEN SURRENDERED OR PLACED IN SAFEKEEPING,
 OR HAS BEEN DEEMED ABANDONED BY THE AUTHORITY.
  3. THE LIQUOR AUTHORITY IN GRANTING SUCH PERMIT SHALL ENSURE THAT:
  (A) ISSUANCE OF THE PERMIT WILL NOT INORDINATELY HINDER THE  OPERATION
 OR EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS CHAPTER;
  (B) THE APPLICANT WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY OBTAIN
 THE MANUFACTURING LICENSE BEING APPLIED FOR; AND
  (C)  THE  APPLICANT  HAS  SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS
 NECESSARY TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSE.
  4. THE APPLICATION FOR A PERMIT SHALL BE APPROVED  OR  DENIED  BY  THE
 LIQUOR AUTHORITY WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF SUCH APPLI-
 CATION.
  5. A TEMPORARY PERMIT SHALL AUTHORIZE THE PERMITTEE TO OPERATE A MANU-
 FACTURING  FACILITY  FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES

  6.  SUCH  TEMPORARY  PERMIT  SHALL  REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR SIX MONTHS OR
 UNTIL THE WHOLESALE LICENSE  BEING  APPLIED  FOR  IS  APPROVED  AND  THE
 LICENSE  GRANTED,  WHICHEVER  IS SHORTER. SUCH PERMIT MAY BE EXTENDED AT
 THE DISCRETION OF THE LIQUOR AUTHORITY FOR ADDITIONAL THREE-MONTH  PERI-
 ODS  OF TIME UPON PAYMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL FEE OF FIFTY DOLLARS FOR EACH

 S. 4005  29  A. 3005
 
  7. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY,  A  TEMPORARY
 PERMIT MAY BE SUMMARILY CANCELLED OR SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME IF THE LIQUOR
 AUTHORITY  DETERMINES  THAT  GOOD  CAUSE  FOR CANCELLATION OR SUSPENSION
 EXISTS. THE LIQUOR AUTHORITY SHALL  PROMPTLY  NOTIFY  THE  PERMITTEE  IN
 WRITING  OF  SUCH  CANCELLATION  OR  SUSPENSION  AND SHALL SET FORTH THE
 REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION.
  8. THE LIQUOR AUTHORITY IN REVIEWING SUCH APPLICATION SHALL REVIEW THE
 ENTIRE RECORD AND GRANT THE TEMPORARY PERMIT UNLESS GOOD CAUSE IS OTHER-
 WISE SHOWN. A DECISION ON AN APPLICATION SHALL BE BASED  ON  SUBSTANTIAL
 EVIDENCE  IN THE RECORD AND SUPPORTED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE
 IN FAVOR OF THE APPLICANT.

 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2023.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 S. 4005  39  A. 3005
 
  This  bill  would  revise  the  terms of participation in the New York
 State and Local Retirement Systems (NYSLRS)  Contribution  Stabilization
 Program  (CSP).  Participating employers in the NYSLRS may enter the CSP
 to reduce  volatility  in  average  annual  contribution  rates.  Should
 employer billing rates increase rapidly, the CSP allows a portion of the
 increase  to  be amortized over 10 years for the regular CSP or 12 years
 for the alternative CSP.  Should employer billing rates decrease  rapid-
 ly,  the  CSP  requires  employers  to  make an additional contribution,
 called a graded payment. The graded payment is deposited into an  inter-
 est-bearing reserve fund held within the NYSLRS for the exclusive use by
 the employer to reduce future amortizations.
  This bill revises the CSP in the following ways:
  1)  Limits the value of the reserve fund assets. Graded payments would
 cease when the employer's reserve  fund  assets  exceed  the  employer's
 actuarial  contribution in the prior fiscal year. Currently, the reserve
 fund is capped at 100% of the employer's payroll.
  2) Creates  provisions  for  termination  from  the  CSP,  subject  to
 approval  by  the Comptroller, provided all prior year amortizations are
 paid in full, including interest. Beginning the  fiscal  year  following
 termination,  the  employer would not be required (or allowed) to make a
 graded payment. Any existing reserve fund assets would be used to reduce
 future annual bills up to the amount the employer would have  been  able
 to amortize if still in the program.  The employer would be permitted to
 re-enter  the  regular  CSP  only  if eligible to amortize, provided all
 reserve fund assets are depleted.
  3) Allows an employer to utilize its reserve  fund  assets  to  pay  a
 portion  of  its  annual  bill  when  the  employer's  average actuarial
 contribution rate exceeds the employer's graded rate.  Currently,  the
 employer's average actuarial rate must exceed the System graded rate.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  some  administrative  costs  to  implement the provisions of this
 legislation.
