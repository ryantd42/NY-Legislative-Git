  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Bleeding Disorders Awareness Month in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York  takes  great  pride  in  recognizing
serious  disorders  by proclaiming official months to increase awareness
of such concerns, which affect thousands of New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March 2023, as Bleeding Disorders
Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Bleeding Disorders Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bleeding  disorders  encompass  a  variety  of  genetic
conditions  including  hemophilia,  Von  Willebrand  disease,  platelet
disorders, and non-malignant blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia;
these  conditions  cause  an affected person's blood to clot slower than
normal, leading to prolonged bleeding  which  can  result  from  trauma,
medical procedures, child birth, or occur spontaneously; and
 
  WHEREAS, Symptoms vary, and may include pain, disabling joint/muscle
damage,  organ  failure  and  in  severe  cases  death;  while  there is
treatment for these conditions, there is no cure; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bleeding disorders may affect more  than  one  in  100  New
Yorkers, both male and female; while many patients have a family history
of bleeding disorders, one in three do not; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  history  of  bleeding disorders is one of tragedy and
hope; before 1965 there  was  no  treatment  for  people  with  bleeding
disorders;  those with serious symptoms often became physically disabled
and often had a life expectancy of 40 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the 1980s, treatment finally became available for  those
suffering  with these disorders; unfortunately, the treatments gave rise
to the scourge of HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C from contaminated blood; as a
result, over 10,000 people with bleeding disorders died, and  those  who
survived lived profoundly altered lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  advances in medical research and growing access to
care offer people with bleeding disorders the opportunity to lead  full,
productive  lives to the same age as unaffected people; however, the key
to realizing this bright future is early  diagnosis,  proper  treatment,
and  continuing  access  to  the different medications and care services
patients need to stay healthy as they grow and age; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is appropriate to recognize March as Bleeding  Disorders
Month  in  order  to  foster public awareness and understanding of these
bleeding  disorders  and  to  encourage  early  detection  and  prompt
treatment; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March  2023,  as  Bleeding
Disorders Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
