  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March  20,  2024,  as  Small  Business  Development
  Centers Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
entrepreneurs and small businesses that contribute substantially to  the
economic  and  social  vitality  of their communities, thereby enhancing
economic and social well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Wednesday, March 20, 2024,
as Small Business Development Centers Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Small  Business  Development  Centers  (SBDCs)  Day  is  a
national, collective observation of the impact that America's SBDCs have
on  the  success  of  our  nation's  dreamers, innovators, and doers who
embody such small businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, First observed in 2017, SBDCs Day unites the  nearly  1,000
SBDC centers across the country and the hundreds of thousands of clients
they  serve every year by sharing, in real time, the success stories and
significant impacts SBDCs and their business advisors have  had  on  the
small business community at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Small Business Administration (SBA) was created in 1953
by an act of Congress, reflecting federal awareness of the importance of
small  businesses  to  the  nation's  economy  and  the need for federal
government involvement in fostering a climate in which small  businesses
could flourish; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Association of Small Business Development Centers was
officially  formed  in  1979  with  a  focus  on  one-on-one  business
advisement,  business  education, and data-driven specialty programming;
proving  lastingly  significant,  the  SBDC  program  is  the  federal
government's  largest  and  most  successful  management  and  technical
assistance program for small businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York SBDC has  20  regional  centers  and  over  70
satellite locations across New York State; in 2023, it provided services
to  over 23,000 small businesses, hosted over 550 educational workshops,
and had a financial impact of over $300 million; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2024, the New York SBDC celebrates its 40th anniversary;
as one of the nation's first small business development networks,  small
business  advisors  within  the New York SBDC have, since its inception,
assisted over 580,000 businesses, created, or saved  more  than  260,000
jobs, and generated a financial impact of over $8.7 billion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  SBDC advisory services include assistance at all stages of
the business cycle, covering items such  as  business  plans,  financial
projections,  market  research,  marketing  support, certifications, and
assistance with identifying funding opportunities; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Small Business Development Centers and their advisors also
function as first responders for small businesses in  the  aftermath  of
disasters;  these  centers  worked  with  New York's small businesses on
recovery and support in the aftermath of  events  like  9/11,  Hurricane
Sandy, and the COVID-19 pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  All  SBDCs are associated with host academic institutions,
linking higher education institutions with  small  businesses  in  their
communities  and  providing  a  connection between academic and business
pathways across New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State  SBDCs  are  currently  hosted  at  13  SUNY
campuses, 5 CUNY campuses, Columbia University, and Pace University; the
program  is  administered  by  the  State  University  of New York and a
resource  partner,  receiving  funding  from  the  U.S.  Small  Business
Administration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to honor those
small  businesses  within  the  State  of  New  York  which  distinguish
themselves  through  outstanding  professional  behavior,  corporate
innovation, and enduring commitment to the community, and  to  recognize
their  contributions  to  the  economic  health  and  vitality  of  the
communities they serve; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 20, 2024, as Small
Business Development Centers Day in the State of New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
