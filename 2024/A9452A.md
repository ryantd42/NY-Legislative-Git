 grated and tiered system of care for holistic health and wellness.

 officio  members,  and  twenty-eight  regional  representative  members,
 appointed as follows:

 the  local  mental hygiene directors, or their designees, shall serve as
 ex officio members of the work group.
  (c)  Regional  membership  and  appointments. (i) For purposes of this
 act, there shall be nine regions,  consisting  of  the  same  geographic
 areas  and counties as the social care networks described in the January
 2024 New York State Department of Health Request for  Applications:  New
 York Health Equity Reform: Social Care Networks:
  (1) Region 1: Capital;
  (2) Region 2: Western;
  (3) Region 3: Hudson Valley;
  (4) Region 4: New York City;
  (5) Region 5: Finger Lakes;
  (6) Region 6: Southern Tier;
  (7) Region 7: Central;
  (8) Region 8: Long Island;
  (9) Region 9: North Country.
  (ii)  There  shall  be three members from each region, except New York
 City, which shall have four.
  (iii) Regional member candidates shall be selected through a  nominat-
 ing process conducted by ex officio members of the work group in collab-
 oration  with a statewide advocacy group with knowledge and expertise in
 public policy related to enhancing treatment mental health services  and
 promoting recovery, rehabilitation, individual rights and full community
 inclusion.  Regional member candidates must have lived experience as a
 person who is currently or was previously in the shelter system, used or
 using public housing vouchers,  court-involved,  and/or  in  the  public
 health, substance use and mental health systems.
  3.  Appointments  shall  be made within one hundred twenty days of the
 effective date of this act. Vacancies in the work group shall be  filled
 in the same manner provided for original appointments.
  4.  The  work  group  membership shall accurately reflect the race and
 ethnicity of people who use public health and  mental  health  services.
 Following  the  nominating process and if necessary, the nominating body
 under subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (c) of  subdivision  two  of  this
 section  shall select alternative members that will ensure the inclusion
 and equity targets described herein.
  5. Participation by non-voting members  encourages  the  inclusion  of
 diverse  viewpoints but does not dilute the decision-making authority of
 the work group  members  who  use  mental  health  services.  Non-voting
 members may participate in all actions afforded members but may not vote
 on any resolutions. If not otherwise selected to be a member of the work
 group, the following shall be non-voting members:
  (a)  the director of recipient affairs from any local or state govern-
 mental unit;
  (b) representatives of trade  associations  representing  housing  and
 service  providers,  hospital  associations, and health insurance compa-
 nies;
  (c) representatives of social justice and legal advocacy organizations
 with an established track  record  of  public  testimony  and/or  policy
 research related to the provision of mental health service; and
  (d)  additional  non-voting  members may be added at the discretion of
 the work group.
  6. Work group members shall receive no compensation for their  efforts
 and  services  as members for the actual and necessary expenses incurred
 in the performance of their duties.

  7. A quorum shall consist of a majority of members of the  work  group
 entitled  to  vote  on  the  matter under consideration. Approval of any
 matter shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of  the  members
 voting  thereon.  The  quorum  must  include  a  proportionate number of
 members  with  lived  experiences  that  is equal to or greater than the
 proportion of the work group as a whole.
  8. The work group shall be authorized to adopt by-laws for the manage-
 ment and regulation of its affairs.
  9. The statewide person-centered mental  health  services  work  group
 shall develop the recommendations for:
  (a) A regional and statewide mental health planning system to:
  (i) Establish regional short and long-range strategic goals and strat-
 egies that integrate behavioral health and physical health;
  (ii) Ensure that persons with lived experiences have a leadership role
 in the development of these goals;
  (iii) Ensure adoption through a community consensus process;
  (iv) Identify measurable outcomes, accountability, and funding for the
 strategic goals; and
  (v)  Ensure  there  is  a  transparent  annual  evaluation and quality
 improvement process that is consistent across all regions.
  (b) Establishing a statewide clearinghouse of  best  practices  to  be
 posted  publicly, regularly updated, and on the office of mental health,
 the office of addiction services and supports, the department of health,
 and the New York city department of health and mental  hygiene  websites
 to  ensure  the implementation of programs that have proved effective in
 one region could be scaled up across the entire system.
  (c) Establishing an annual budgeting system to ensure regional-identi-
 fied priorities are adequately funded.
  10. In carrying  out  its  functions,  the  work  group  shall  foster
 discussions  among,  and  conduct  formal public hearings with requisite
 public notice to solicit input from, local stakeholders'  interests.  It
 will  conduct  research  and evaluate strategic planning tools and tech-
 niques used in the public sphere that have proven  to  be  effective  in
 soliciting  and incorporating meaningful community input into comparable
 regional plans and meet the requirements described in paragraph  (a)  of
 subdivision nine of this section.
  11.  (a)  The commissioners of the office of mental health, the office
 of addiction services and supports, the department of  health,  and  the
 New  York city department of health and mental hygiene shall designate a
 sufficient number of employees of their offices as are reasonably neces-
 sary to provide support services to the statewide  work  group  and  its
 efforts.
  (b)  The  commissioners  of the office of mental health, the office of
 addiction services and supports, the department  of  health,  and  local
 county  health  care  agencies  shall  appoint  representatives of their
 respective offices to serve as a liaison between their offices  and  the
 work  group.  All  state agencies, public authorities and public benefit
 corporations  shall  provide  such  assistance  as  may  be  reasonably
 requested.
  12.  Deliberations,  meetings and other proceedings of the work group,
 and any committees thereof, shall be governed by article 7 of the public
 officers law. Any one or more members of the work group may  participate
 in  a  meeting  by  means of a conference telephone, conference video or
 similar communications equipment allowing all persons  participating  in
 the  meeting  to hear each other at the same time. Participation by such
 means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. At any  meetings
 A. 9452--A  4
 
 of  the work group conducted by means of a conference telephone, confer-
 ence video or similar communications  equipment,  other  than  executive
 sessions,  the  public  shall  be  given an opportunity to listen.  If a
 meeting other than an executive session is to be conducted by means of a
 conference  telephone, conference video or similar communications equip-
 ment, the public notice for the meeting shall  inform  the  public  that
 such  equipment  will be used and identify the means by which the public
 may listen to such meeting.
  13. (a) Upon consideration of factors identified in  subdivision  nine
 of this section, the work group shall develop recommendations for reform
 of  the  state's  local  mental  health planning process to ensure it is
 informed by consumers and reflective of local needs.
  (b) The work group shall transmit a report containing  these  specific
 recommendations  to the governor and the legislature on or before Novem-
 ber 1, 2025. The report  and  recommendations  shall  simultaneously  be
 posted  on  the  websites  of the office of mental health, the office of
 addiction services and supports, and the department of health,  as  well
 as  distributed  to  the  public  via  the  same  media channels used to
 announce major program or policy changes, or procurement opportunities.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
