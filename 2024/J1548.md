  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 22, 2024, as Doula Day in  the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 22, 2024, as Doula  Day  in  the
State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the observance of World Doula
Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Doula Week begins with World Doula Day on March  22nd
which  was chosen because it is the spring equinox, which represents the
return of fertility in countless cultures; and
 
  WHEREAS, The purpose of World Doula Day and World Doula Week  is  to
empower  doulas all over the world to improve the physiological, social,
emotional, and psychological health of women, newborns and  families  in
birth and in the postpartum period; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Doula Day events will take place all over the world
on the same day, stating the benefits of the presence of doulas in birth
and in  the  postpartum  period  including  reducing  the  incidence  of
c-sections; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  presence  of  doulas  during labor and the postpartum
period are beneficial to the entire family by reducing the incidence  of
postpartum mood; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  doula  may shorten the length of labor; reduce epidural
and  analgesic  requests;  increase  breastfeeding  initiation  and
continuation;  increase  mother's  satisfaction of birth experience; and
increase new parents' confidence in the care of their newborn; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals,  such as doulas, of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 22, 2024,  as  Doula
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
