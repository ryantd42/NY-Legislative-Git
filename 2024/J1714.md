  HONORING  Police Chief David J. Collins, the first
  Black  chief  in  the  department  and  the  city's
  history,  upon  the  occasion of his retirement from
  Rome Police Department
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
honor  those  distinguished  officers  and  citizens  who  would  devote
themselves to public service, demonstrating great courage and  diligence
in  providing  for  the  care  and  welfare  of  the  citizens  of their
communities and this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within every community of the State of New York  there  are
certain  individuals  who, by virtue of their commitment and dedication,
command  the  respect  and  admiration  of  their  community  for  their
exemplary contributions and service on behalf of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Police Chief
David J. Collins, the first Black chief in the department and the city's
history,  upon  the  occasion  of  his  retirement  from  Rome  Police
Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Moving to Rome, New York at the age of 16 with his  father,
who  was  based  at Griffiss Air Force Base as a Master Sergeant for the
United States Air Force, David  J.  Collins  graduated  from  Rome  Free
Academy and joined the United States Army; and
 
  WHEREAS,  David  J.  Collins  served  over  22 years in the military
between active duty and the reserves before retiring in 2018; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prior to his hire as a Rome police officer in  2005,  David
J.  Collins  was a licensed practical nurse at St. Elizabeth Campus of
the Mohawk Valley Health System in Utica; however, from a young  age  he
was  inspired  by  his father's role in the Air Force and by the role of
policemen; and
 
  WHEREAS, When David J. Collins was sworn in as the new deputy  chief
for  the  Rome  Police Department 2 years ago, it was the first time the
Department had a full change in leadership in almost 14 years; he was  a
17-year  veteran  of  the  department,  having  previously  served  as a
patrolman, sergeant, lieutenant and  captain;  and  Collins  served  two
years as chief.
 
  WHEREAS,  Striving  to  do  his  best  for  the  City  of  Rome, the
community, and the Rome Police Department, Police Chief David J. Collins
said his primary goal as chief was maintaining a  positive  relationship
with  the  community,  including  continuing  the  Community  Advisory
Committee; and
 
  WHEREAS, With him throughout have been his wife, Jeany, and his five
children, all of whom feel privileged to be  a  part  of  his  life  and
rejoice in his achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
dedicated public servants who unselfishly  devote  their  lives  to  the
preservation  of  order  and the protection of others are worthy and due
full praise for their commitment and noble endeavors; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Police Chief David J.  Collins,  the  first  Black  chief  in  the
department  and  the city's history, upon the occasion of his retirement
from Rome Police Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Police Chief David J. Collins.
