BY: M. of A. Alvarez
 
  COMMENDING  the  Bronx  Zoo  upon  the occasion of
  kicking off its  125th  Anniversary  celebration  on
  April 18, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  the
continuing welfare of the citizens of the State of New York  is  greatly
enriched  and  reliably  served  by  the  purposeful  endeavors of those
organizations within our midst that strive to  enhance  the  quality  of
life  in  their communities by promoting wildlife conservation, science,
and community engagement; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the Bronx Zoo  upon  the  occasion  of  kicking  off  its  125th
Anniversary celebration on Thursday, April 18, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Planned  festivities  to celebrate this momentous occasion
include the opening of "Animal Chronicles,"  an  immersive  new  exhibit
which leads visitors through a quarter-mile ADA-accessible walking trail
that  includes  68 eco-sculptures displayed across 13 scenes; each scene
tells the tale of how the zoo became a leader  in  caring  for  animals,
saving  endangered  species,  designing  exhibits that connect people to
nature, and protecting wildlife around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, This opening event will feature an exclusive preview of the
new exhibit and unveil a series of themed weekend activities celebrating
the Zoo's success stories in saving species over the past 125 years; all
will get a preview of weekend entertainment  elements  including  music,
dance performances, and wildlife puppetry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Bronx Zoo, located on 265 acres of hardwood forest in
the Bronx, New York, opened on November 8, 1899;  it  is  world-renowned
for its leadership in the areas of animal welfare, husbandry, veterinary
care, education, science, and conservation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  zoo  is  accredited  by  the  Association of Zoos and
Aquariums (AZA) and is the flagship park of  the  Wildlife  Conservation
Society  (WCS)  which  manages  the  world's  largest  network  of urban
wildlife parks including the Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Prospect  Park
Zoo, Queens Zoo, and New York Aquarium; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  curators  and animal care staff at the Bronx Zoo work
passionately  and  unrelentingly  to  save,  propagate,  and  sustain
populations of threatened and endangered species; this work is paramount
to  maintaining  biodiversity  as  these species often have an effect on
soil formation, decomposition, water filtration and  flow,  pollination,
pest  control,  climate  regulation,  and  various  other  environmental
factors; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Bronx Zoo has  educated  and  inspired  more  than  400
million  visitors  at  its  zoos and aquarium since its opening and host
approximately 4 million guests at its parks each year, including about a
half-million students annually; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The Bronx Zoo is the largest youth employer in the borough
of the Bronx, providing opportunities and help to transform lives in one
of the most under-served communities in the nation; the Bronx Zoo is the
subject of "THE ZOO," a docuseries aired world-wide  on  Animal  Planet;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Bronx  Zoo,  with over 125 years of proud history and
purposeful endeavors, remains today  as  a  preeminent  example  of  our
understanding  of,  and  appreciation  for,  the precious wildlife which
comprise the bounty of nature and the beauty of  our  environment;  this
zoo  has  brought  untold  delight  and  useful knowledge to millions of
citizens and visitors from abroad; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  Bronx  Zoo  upon  the  occasion  of  kicking off its 125th
Anniversary celebration on April 18, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Bronx Zoo.
