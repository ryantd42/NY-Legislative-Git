  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March as Triple  Negative  Breast  Cancer  Awareness
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Breast  cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed cancer
and the second leading cause of cancer death among women in  the  United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately  287,850 women will be diagnosed with breast
cancer and over 43,000 will die with this malignancy in 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Triple Negative Breast Cancer  is  one  of  many  forms  of
breast  cancer  and  accounts for about 15-20% of all diagnosed invasive
breast cancer cases in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 53,700 new breast cancer cases  in  2019  in  the
United States were Triple Negative Breast Cancer, with higher prevalence
among  younger  women,  Black  and  Hispanic  women,  women  with type 2
diabetes or carrying excess weight in the abdomen area, and  those  with
BRCA1 mutations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  its  aggressive  behavior, Triple Negative Breast
Cancer grows quickly and is more likely to have spread at the time it is
found and is more likely to come back after treatment than  other  types
of breast cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People  diagnosed  with  metastatic Triple Negative Breast
Cancer have a less than 30% chance of surviving past five years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells  do  not  contain  (are
"negative  for")  three key receptors that medicines typically target in
other types of breast cancers; therefore, there  are  limited  treatment
options that can be used to treat the cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Patients with an early diagnosis can often be treated with
chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery;  however,  the  limited  therapies
available  specifically  addressing  the  management  of Triple Negative
Breast Cancer has made treating this disease a challenge for clinicians;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recent  innovation  in  targeted  therapies  have  fueled
advances in the fight against Triple Negative Breast Cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Studies  have  shown  that  Triple  Negative Breast Cancer
disease-specific mortality rates  are  often  higher  if  patients  have
Medicaid  or  Medicare or are lower socio-economic status; compared with
non-Hispanic white women, Black women are 48%  less  likely  to  receive
guideline adherent care and have an approximate twofold higher mortality
rate, resulting in a disproportionately higher risk of death from Triple
Negative Breast Cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Advances in breast cancer screening and treatment over the
last few decades have reduced the overall breast cancer mortality  rate,
 
yet  the  disproportionate  impact  of  Triple Negative Breast Cancer on
racial and ethnic minority communities raises considerations  about  the
underlying determinants driving the disparities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  necessary to promote Triple Negative Breast Cancer
education, raise awareness about the  disease-related  disparities,  and
tackle  inequities  within  the  health care delivery such as inadequate
access to screening, diagnostic testing,  and  care,  to  improve  early
detection and survival; now, therefore be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March as  Triple  Negative
Breast  Cancer  Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
