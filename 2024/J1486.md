  HONORING Volunteer Firefighter Ray Daviau upon the
  occasion  of his designation for special recognition
  after  60  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
  Whitesboro Volunteer Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to honor Volunteer
Firefighter Ray Daviau upon the occasion of his designation for  special
recognition  after  60  years  of  dedicated  service  to the Whitesboro
Volunteer Fire Department, celebrated with a salute from his  colleagues
and  the  presentation of a special plaque from the Whitesboro Mayor and
members of the village board; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ray Daviau became a member of the Whitesboro Volunteer Fire
Department on July 3, 1963; he joined at the age  of  20  to  serve  the
community and has found passion in his service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Truly  dedicated  to  his  duties,  Ray  Daviau  tells his
colleagues that as long as he is able, he will continue to  serve  as  a
Volunteer Firefighter; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State
with pride, valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers  are  often
the  first  to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire,
transportation accident, natural disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Volunteer Firefighter Ray Daviau is one such firefighter; throughout  60
years of devoted service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
fire protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor  Volunteer  Firefighter  Ray  Daviau  upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation  for special recognition after 60 years of dedicated service
to the Whitesboro Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Ray Daviau.
