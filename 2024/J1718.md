  WELCOMING Richard Martin Lloyd Walters, also known
  as  "Slick  Rick,"  upon  the  occasion of his first
  visit to the New York State Capitol on  January  23,
  2024,  and  recognizing  his  40  years of community
  service and  contributions  to  hip  hop  music  and
  culture
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor and pay
tribute to those musical geniuses whose commitment and creative  talents
have  contributed  to the entertainment and cultural enrichment of their
community, the State of New York, the Nation, and the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
welcome Richard Martin Lloyd Walters, also known as "Slick  Rick,"  upon
the  occasion  of  his  first  visit  to  the  New York State Capitol on
Tuesday, January 23, 2024, and to recognize his 40  years  of  community
service and contributions to hip hop music and culture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  humble  beginnings to global recognition, Slick Rick
was born Richard Martin Lloyd Walters  in  South  Wimbledon,  London  on
January 14, 1965; he migrated to the Bronx, New York, with his family as
a  child  where he encountered Hip Hop culture first-hand and soon found
his voice in Rap; and
 
  WHEREAS, Richard Walters attended the  La  Guardia  High  School  of
Music and Art, where he became friends with future rapper Dana Dane; the
two  formed  the  Kangol  Crew,  and began performing in hip-hop battles
around the city; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the early 1980s, Rick's talent caught the  attention  of
Doug E. Fresh, and soon, he was featured in Doug E.'s "The Show" and "La
Di  Da  Di," two tracks that would signal the advent of the "Slick Rick"
persona; his cadence and flamboyant style set him apart, and  his  knack
for  weaving  intricate narratives laid the foundation for Rick becoming
the storyteller we know and respect today; and
 
  WHEREAS, His debut album, "The  Great  Adventures  of  Slick  Rick,"
truly  cemented  his  place  in  Hip Hop; from the hilarious exploits in
"Children's Story," to the poignant  social  commentary  in  "Hey  Young
World," each song was an intricate narrative; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Additionally,  Slick  Rick  was  among  artists  bringing
light-hearted fun to the Rap scene; his  signature  eye  patch  set  him
apart,  and  his  vivid  storytelling  brought characters to life, using
music as a canvas to depict real-life issues; he was no ordinary rapper;
he was a raconteur; each album became a new chapter, a fresh saga in the
ever-evolving story of Slick Rick; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  impact  of  Slick  Rick  is  far-reaching;  his
narrative-centric  style  revolutionized  Hip Hop, influencing countless
artists; names  like  Snoop  Dogg,  Biggie  Smalls,  and  Eminem  openly
attribute  their  storytelling abilities to Rick's influence; his peers'
 
response was  overwhelmingly  positive,  affirming  his  status  in  the
industry,  and  his  rhymes  were  not  just  entertaining,  they  were
groundbreaking; he pushed the boundaries of what Rap could be,  changing
the landscape forever; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Slick  Rick's  success wasn't confined to acclaim from his
peers;  he  enjoyed  remarkable  commercial  success  with  "The  Great
Adventures  of  Slick  Rick" going platinum; his subsequent albums, "The
Ruler's Back," "Behind Bars," and "The Art of Storytelling," also  found
chart success, a testament to his enduring appeal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Slick  Rick's  music  continues  to  be  sampled
extensively, his stories told and retold by generations of rappers;  his
legacy is a beacon guiding hip hop's next generation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to his monumental success as an artist, Slick
Rick continues to give back to the greater  global  community  with  his
organization, the Victory Patch Foundation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cofounded  in 2020 alongside his wife, Mandy Aragones, the
Victory Patch Foundation uplifts underserved and overlooked  communities
through  making active positive outreach, administering social programs,
and unlocking access to resources; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pushing for equality in the face of injustice,  this  vital
non-profit  organization  enables those who need it most, amplifying the
voices of individuals of all  ages  often  overlooked;  under  the  able
leadership  of Slick Rick, the Victory Patch Foundation leads with love,
not just encouraging victory, but placing victory within reach; and
 
  WHEREAS, A man of colossal talent, Slick Rick's dedication  to  both
his  music  and his community should be celebrated and recognized by all
the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
welcome  Richard  Martin Lloyd Walters, also known as "Slick Rick," upon
the occasion of his first visit to the New York State Capitol on January
23, 2024,  and  recognizing  his  40  years  of  community  service  and
contributions to hip hop music and culture; and be it further
