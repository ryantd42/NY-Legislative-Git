BY: Senator HOYLMAN-SIGAL
 
  COMMEMORATING the 40th Anniversary of The Lesbian,
  Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Community Center
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  institutions  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  40th  Anniversary  of  The  Lesbian,  Gay, Bisexual, &
Transgender Community Center, commonly known  as  "The  Center,"  to  be
celebrated on Thursday, April 13, 2023, at the Center Dinner; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Center  Dinner,  is the organization's largest annual
gala, which brings together  almost  1,000  supporters  of  The  Center,
making  the  event one of the largest gatherings of the LGBTQ+ community
and allies in the New York City area; the evening raises critical  funds
to  support  the  life-saving and life-enhancing programs offered, while
bringing together influential LGBTQ+ community  members  and  allies  to
celebrate  those who are doing this work, and whose efforts are ushering
in a more just and equitable world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Community Center,
then known as the "Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center Inc.,"  was
incorporated on July 6th, 1983; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Center  has steadily expanded the services it offers,
becoming a fixture of Greenwich Village  through  its  work  to  connect
clients  with  individual,  couple, and family counseling, substance use
services, youth and young adult  services,  HIV  services  and  testing,
assistance  with  health  insurance,  and  social  supports services and
groups; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Center  has  a  long  history  of  promoting  LGBTQ+
representation  in  civic  life,  first  through  its  Promote  the Vote
initiative,  which  at  the  time  of  its  founding,  was  the  largest
nonpartisan lesbian and gay voter registration and mobilization program,
and today through its RiseOut People's Platform; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Center  serves  as a safe space, hub of activism, and
resource for the LGBTQ+ community, NYC  residents,  visitors,  and  more
than 400 community groups; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Center's  dedicated and compassionate staff use their
expertise and  lived  experience  to  serve  as  social  workers,  event
coordinators,  crisis  counselors,  therapists, counselors, friends, and
mentors in service of this mission; and
 
  WHEREAS, At  a  time  when  hate  crimes  and  hate-fueled  rhetoric
directed  toward  the  LGBTQ+  community  have  risen  meteorically,
particularly towards trans, nonbinary, and two-spirit  individuals,  The
Center's work has never been more important; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate The Center's 40th Anniversary, recognizing the  significance
of  the  role  it  continues to play in providing a place to connect and
engage, find camaraderie and support, and  celebrate  the  vibrancy  and
growth of the LGBTQ+ community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The  Lesbian,  Gay,  Bisexual,  &  Transgender  Community
Center.
