 Provided,  however,  that  the  fiscal  control  board shall have fiscal
 control over the district in accordance with the provisions of this act.
 The fiscal control board shall have all the powers and duties of a board

 such  powers  and  duties  relate  to fiscal policies and decisions. The
 fiscal control board's authority over the fiscal policies and  decisions
 of  the district shall ensure the district maintains or improves current
 educational programs and facilities.  In carrying out their  powers  and
 duties, the fiscal control board shall, to the greatest extent practica-
 ble,  account for the unique needs of any racial, ethnic, linguistic, or

  2. The fiscal control board shall have the following additional powers
 and duties:
  (a) to exercise fiscal control over the district  in  accordance  with

  (b)  to  act  as the finance board of the district for purposes of the
 local finance law including, but not limited to, the power to  authorize
 the issuance of bonds and notes;
  (c)  to  establish  fiscal  benchmarks for the district in relation to
 district revenues and expenditures to stabilize  the  district's  fiscal
 condition  by eliminating the district's fiscal deficit and enabling the
 maintenance of a balanced budget while maintaining or improving  current
 educational programs and addressing facility needs;
  (d)  to review and revise all current fiscal policies and practices of
 the district including, but  not  limited  to,  policies  and  practices
 related  to  pupil  transportation  services, use of the district's fund

 A. 10407  4
 
  (e) to review, authorize, and approve all contracts of  the  district.
 Prior to entering into any contract, the district shall submit a copy of
 such contract to the fiscal control board, accompanied by an analysis of
 the  projected costs of such agreement. Such submission shall be in such
 form  and shall include such additional information as the control board
 may prescribe. The fiscal control board shall promptly review the  terms
 of such contract and the supporting information and shall disapprove any
 contract  which,  in  its  judgment,  would  have a significant negative
 impact on the fiscal health of the district;
  (f) to conduct, or contract with an entity to conduct forensic  audits
 of  the  district  and  report any in which there is reason to believe a
 violation of a law, abuse or waste has occurred to the  state  inspector
 general. The cost of any such contract shall be paid by the district;
  (g)  to  direct  the  board of education, superintendent, and/or other
 school district staff to undergo any training as  deemed  necessary  and
 pursuant  to  timelines  established  by the fiscal control board. In no
 event shall the total number of training hours  exceed  15  hours  in  a
 single  calendar  year.  Provided, however, the fiscal control board may
 recommend additional training as deemed necessary;
  (h) to obtain independent counsel to serve as counsel  to  the  fiscal
 control board. The cost of such counsel shall be borne by the district;
  (i)  to  utilize district staff to the same extent the board of educa-
 tion utilizes such staff to aid in the performance of their duties;
  (j) to approve or disapprove all fiscal  reports  including,  but  not
 limited  to, treasure's reports, payroll reports, claims audits reports,
 internal and external audit reports, fund transfer reports; and
  (k) to do all things necessary to carry out its purposes and  exercise
 powers expressly given and granted in this act.
  § 5. Board of education meetings. 1. The fiscal control board shall be
 entitled  to  attend  all  meetings of the board of education, including
 executive sessions; provided however,  that  the  fiscal  control  board
 shall  not  be  considered  for purposes of establishing a quorum of the
 board of education, provided further that the fiscal control  board  may
 be  excused  from  executive  session  when proposed, pending or current
 litigation involving the fiscal control board and any of its  individual
 members, or the department, are being discussed.
  2.  (a)  The board of education clerk shall provide the fiscal control
 board with copies of the board of education agenda and  all  resolutions
 and motions on such agenda for each board meeting no later than 72 hours
 prior  to  such board meeting. If a proposed resolution or motion is for
 the purpose of approving a contract or to comply with state law or regu-
 lation and the date to comply with such law or regulation is  within  21
 days  of  the  board  meeting,  the board clerk shall provide the fiscal
 control board with  copies  of  the  proposed  resolution  and  proposed
 contract language at least 7 days prior to such meeting.
  (b)  In the event the fiscal control board is not provided with copies
 of proposed resolutions or motions 72 hours or 7 days prior to  a  board
 meeting,  as  applicable,  the  fiscal  control  board  may,  at  their
 discretion, remove an item including board resolutions or  motions  from
 consideration  by  the  board  at  such meeting. Upon the failure of the
 board clerk to provide proposed resolutions or motions  as  required  by
 this  section,  the  fiscal  control  board shall provide notice of such
 failure to the board of education. An item removed from consideration by
 the fiscal control board may not be reconsidered by the board of  educa-
 tion  for  a  period  of 10 days or the next board of education meeting,
 A. 10407  5

 whichever is later, unless the fiscal control board expressly authorizes
 consideration at an earlier date.
  3.  In  the  event that the fiscal control board finds that an adopted
 resolution or motion, a proposed resolution or motion, or the  board  of
 education's  failure to act: violates state law, rule, or regulation; is
 inconsistent with the terms of the  long  term  strategic  academic  and
 fiscal improvement plan adopted pursuant to section nine of this act; or
 is  fiscal  matter  that is under the jurisdiction of the fiscal control
 board, the fiscal control board may:
  (a) Override adopted or proposed resolutions or motions by  the  board
 of education through the issuance of a directive which shall contain the
 specific findings as to the necessity of such override and any potential
 corrective action by the board of education that would address the defi-
 ciency  in  such  adopted  or  proposed resolution or motion. The fiscal
 control board shall provide written notice to the  board  of  education,
 superintendent  and  commissioner  of  their  intention  to override the
 adopted or proposed resolution or motion at any time  but  in  no  event
 later  than  48 hours after such resolution or motion was adopted by the
 board of education unless the commissioner has extended  the  period  to
 override  due  to  extenuating circumstances that necessitate additional
 time. The override notice shall stay the proceedings  of  the  board  of
 education  on  such  adopted  resolution  or motion or, if the notice is
 provided prior to action by the board of education, it shall remove such
 proposed resolution or motion from consideration by the board of  educa-
 tion  pending  the  issuance of a directive by the fiscal control board.
 The fiscal control board must submit  the  directive  to  the  board  of
 education,  superintendent  and  the  commissioner no later than 10 days
 following notice of such override. Upon the issuance of a directive, the
 override of the board of education's adopted or proposed  resolution  or
 motion  shall  be  final  and conclusive unless the fiscal control board
 fails to issue such directive within  10  days  or  within  such  period
 established  by  the  fiscal  control  board if the period was extended,
 withdraws such  override,  or  the  commissioner  overrules  the  fiscal
 control boards override within 10 days of the issuance of the directive.
 The fiscal control board may extend the period to submit such directive,
 at  intervals  of 10 additional days for each extension, if the board of
 education, superintendent or school district employees fail  to  provide
 all  relevant  information requested by the fiscal control board related
 to the adopted or proposed resolution or motion subject to such override
 within 48 hours of such request.
  (b) Submit a resolution for adoption by the board  of  education.  The
 resolution  shall  be  submitted  to the district clerk no later than 48
 hours prior to the next scheduled board of education meeting  who  shall
 cause the resolution to be placed on the next board meeting agenda and a
 copy  to be issued to the board of education, superintendent and commis-
 sioner accompanied by specific findings as  to  the  necessity  of  such
 resolution.  The  monitor  or monitors may direct the board to meet at a
 date prior to their next scheduled board meeting to take up such  resol-
 ution. The fiscal control board may withdraw the resolution prior to, or
 during,  the  next board meeting, if the board of education takes suffi-
 cient action to resolve the issues contained in the resolution.  If  the
 resolution  is  not  withdrawn,  it shall be deemed to be adopted at the
 next board meeting through its submission and shall have the full  force
 and effect as any other resolution adopted by the board of education.

 amended,  and shall annually revise such plan by September first of each
 year.

 plan  that  will  describe how any funds appropriated to the district in
 addition to those appropriated pursuant to sections 3602 and  3602-e  of
 the  education  law  will  be  spent  in the applicable school year. The

 improvement plan. Within  20  days,  the  commissioner  shall  determine
 whether  the district is in violation of any of the elements of the plan
 highlighted by the monitors and shall order the district to comply imme-
 diately with the plan and remedy any such violation. The school district
 shall suspend all actions related to the  potential  violations  of  the
 plan until the commissioner issues a determination.
  §  10. District budget development and approval. 1. The fiscal control
