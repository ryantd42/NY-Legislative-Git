  HONORING  the contributions made by Black Baseball
  to the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is with great pride that this Legislative Body  commends
those  exceptional  Black athletes who represented the State of New York
and brought honor to the game of professional  baseball,  distinguishing
themselves  through  notable  achievement  and thereby representing this
great Empire State with exceptional dignity and determination; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the contributions made by Black Baseball to the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  contributions of Black athletes have helped the sport
of baseball grow into a globally loved phenomenon;  the  first  recorded
game between two organized Black baseball clubs, pre-dating the official
formation of leagues, was between the Unknown Club of Weeksville and the
Henson Baseball Club of Jamaica, Queens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Black  baseball  served  as  an immense point of pride for
Black New Yorkers and provided opportunities  for  community  gathering,
entertainment, and economic success; and
 
  WHEREAS, The City of New York and the State has hosted several Negro
League  teams  in  the  past, such as Unknown Club of Weekfield, Monitor
Club, Unique Club, and many more remarkable teams; and
 
  WHEREAS, Moses Fleetwood Walker was the first Black man  to  join  a
Major  League  Baseball  (MLB)  team  in  1884,  joining the Toledo Blue
Stockings and playing with them for 42 games; and
 
  WHEREAS, Black baseball players have been rightfully established  by
the  MLB  into "Major League Status"; teams that set a precedent for the
history of baseball are: New York Black Yankees (1931 - 1948);  Brooklyn
Eagles  (1935);  Brooklyn  Royal  Giants (1904 - 1927); New York Lincoln
Giants (1911 - 1929); Cuban Stars (1907 - 1930); New York Cubans (1930 -
1950); and the Brooklyn Brown Dodgers (1945 - 1946), a team  established
by Branch Rickey who would famously go on to sign Jackie Robinson to the
Brooklyn Dodgers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New York-based Black baseball teams hosted games featuring
Toni Stone, Connie Morgan, and Maime Johnson, groundbreaking  women  who
played  alongside  their  male  colleagues  and  where,  according  to
contemporaneous reports, "(took) a backseat to no one on  the  field"  ;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals of such outstanding athletic accomplishments are brought  to
our  attention,  they  should  be recognized by all the citizens of this
great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor the contributions made by Black Baseball to the State of New York.
