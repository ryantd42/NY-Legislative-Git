 covered by the provisions of sections 384-d and 384-e of the  retirement
 and  social  security  law and full credit shall be granted in such plan
 for such service upon election of the town of  Southold  to  assume  the
 additional cost of such service.
  §  3.  Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, the town
 of Southold, in the county of Suffolk, a participating employer  in  the
 New  York state and local police and fire retirement system which previ-
 ously elected to offer the optional twenty year retirement plan pursuant
 to section 384-d of the retirement and social  security  law  to  police
 officers  employed  by  such  town, is hereby authorized to make partic-
 ipation in such plan available to Alex U. Chenche and Tara Tandy, police
 officers employed by the town of Southold with a starting date of Decem-
 ber 15, 2014, who, for reasons not ascribable to their  own  negligence,
 were  enrolled in the general retirement plan contained in section 375-i
 of the retirement and social security law.  Alex U.  Chenche  and  Tara
 Tandy  may  elect  to be covered by the provisions of sections 384-d and
 384-e of the retirement and social security law and full credit shall be
 granted in such plan for such service upon election of the town of Sout-

  § 4. The town of Southold may so elect by filing with the state  comp-
 troller  within  six  months of the effective date of this act, a resol-
 ution of its legislative body, together  with  certification  that  such
 police  officers  did  not  bar  themselves  from  participation in such
 retirement plan as a result of their own  negligence.  Thereafter,  such
 police  officers  may  elect to be covered by the provisions of sections
 384-d and 384-e of the retirement and social security law, and shall  be
 entitled to full rights and benefits associated with coverage under such
 sections,  by filing a request to this effect with the state comptroller
 within one year of the effective date of this act.
  § 5. All costs associated with implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the town of Southold and may be amortized over a peri-
 od of five years.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow the Town of Southold to reopen the provisions of
 Section 384-d, together with 384-e, of the Retirement and Social Securi-
 ty Law for police officers Frank Lyburd III, Brian  McNamara,  Peter  J.
 Jacobs,  Roman  S.  Wilinski,  Alex U. Chenche, and Tara Tandy. All past
 service costs will be borne by the Town of Southold and may be amortized
 over a period of five years.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $110,000  in  the
 annual  contributions of the Town of Southold for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary but is  expected  to
 average 11.0% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $1.30 million which will
 be  borne  by  the Town of Southold as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025. If  the  Town  of
 Southold  elects to amortize this cost over a five-year period, the cost
 for each year including interest would be $291,000.
  These estimated costs are based on the six affected members  named  in
 the  bill  and  employed  by the Town of Southold, with annual salary of
 approximately $915,000 as of March 31, 2023.
