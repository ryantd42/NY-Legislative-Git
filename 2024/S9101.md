  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

 BOARD'S FAILURE TO ACT VIOLATES STATE LAW, THE RULES  OF  THE  BOARD  OF
 REGENTS,  THE  REGULATIONS  OF THE COMMISSIONER, OR IS INCONSISTENT WITH
 THE TERMS OF THE LONG TERM STRATEGIC  ACADEMIC  AND  FISCAL  IMPROVEMENT
 PLAN, THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MAY:

 MOTION WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD UNLESS THE COMMISSIONER HAS EXTENDED THE
 PERIOD  TO  OVERRIDE  DUE  TO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NECESSITATE

 NO LATER THAN 10 DAYS FOLLOWING NOTICE OF SUCH OVERRIDE.  UPON THE ISSU-
 ANCE  OF  A  DIRECTIVE,  THE OVERRIDE OF THE BOARD'S ADOPTED OR PROPOSED
 RESOLUTION OR MOTION SHALL BE FINAL AND CONCLUSIVE UNLESS THE MONITOR OR
 MONITORS  FAIL  TO  ISSUE  SUCH  DIRECTIVE WITHIN 10 DAYS OR WITHIN SUCH

 DIRECTIVE.  THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MAY EXTEND THE PERIOD TO SUBMIT SUCH
 DIRECTIVE, AT INTERVALS OF 10 ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR EACH EXTENSION, IF THE

 RELEVANT INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THE MONITOR OR MONITORS RELATED TO THE
 ADOPTED OR PROPOSED RESOLUTION OR MOTION SUBJECT TO SUCH OVERRIDE WITHIN
 48 HOURS OF SUCH REQUEST.
  (B)  THE  RESOLUTION  SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE CLERK NO LATER THAN 48

 MONITORS MAY DIRECT THE BOARD TO MEET AT A DATE PRIOR TO THE NEXT SCHED-
 ULED  BOARD  MEETING TO TAKE UP SUCH RESOLUTION. THE MONITOR OR MONITORS
 MAY WITHDRAW THE RESOLUTION PRIOR TO, OR DURING, THE NEXT BOARD MEETING,
 IF THE BOARD TAKES SUFFICIENT ACTION TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES CONTAINED  IN
 THE  RESOLUTION.  IF THE RESOLUTION IS NOT WITHDRAWN, IT SHALL BE DEEMED
 TO BE ADOPTED AT THE NEXT BOARD MEETING THROUGH ITS SUBMISSION AND SHALL
 HAVE THE FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AS ANY OTHER RESOLUTION  ADOPTED  BY  THE
 BOARD.
  (C)  THE MONITOR OR MONITORS SHALL NOT OVERRIDE AN ADOPTED OR PROPOSED
