 SION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION,  AND THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF ANY PERSON
 OBLIGATED TO SUPPORT SUCH CHILD OR  CHILDREN,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT
 THIS  FACTOR  MAY  APPLY ONLY IF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT SUCH
 CHILD OR CHILDREN ARE LESS THAN THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO  SUPPORT  THE
 CHILD OR CHILDREN WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE INSTANT ACTION;

 BY A VEHICULAR ASSAILANT TO A SURVIVING PARENT OR GUARDIAN.
  4. THE COURT SHALL GIVE STRONG CONSIDERATION TO THE  FINANCIAL  STATUS
 OF  THE  VEHICULAR ASSAILANT UPON RELEASE FROM INCARCERATION, ACCOUNTING
 FOR COURT FINES AND FEES AND OTHER DEBTS TO THE STATE PREVIOUSLY PAID OR
 TO BE PAID BY SUCH ASSAILANT. IN NO CASE SHALL THE COURT ORDER AN AMOUNT
 A. 9724  4

 OF BASIC CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION WHICH WOULD PLACE AN UNDUE  OR  EXCES-
 SIVE  FINANCIAL  BURDEN  UPON  A VEHICULAR ASSAILANT AND/OR SEVERELY AND

 TION,  GIVING FULL CONSIDERATION TO THE STATE OF SUCH ASSAILANT'S FINAN-
 CIAL RESOURCES AND BARRIERS HE OR SHE MAY FACE IN FUTURE EMPLOYMENT.
  5.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF  THIS
 SECTION,  WHERE  THE ANNUAL AMOUNT OF THE CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION WOULD
 REDUCE THE VEHICULAR ASSAILANT'S INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY INCOME  GUIDE-
 LINES  AMOUNT  FOR A SINGLE PERSON AS REPORTED BY THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT
 OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, THE BASIC CHILD SUPPORT  OBLIGATION  SHALL
 BE  TWENTY-FIVE  DOLLARS  PER  MONTH.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF

 HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, THE CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION SHALL  BE  FIFTY
 DOLLARS  PER  MONTH  OR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VEHICULAR ASSAILANT'S
 INCOME AND THE SELF-SUPPORT RESERVE, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
  6. WHERE A VEHICULAR ASSAILANT IS OR MAY BE ENTITLED TO  RECEIVE  NON-
 RECURRING  PAYMENTS  FROM EXTRAORDINARY SOURCES NOT OTHERWISE CONSIDERED
 AS INCOME PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

 THE COURT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBDIVISION THREE  OF  THIS  SECTION,  MAY
 ALLOCATE  A  PROPORTION  OF  THE  SAME TO CHILD SUPPORT, AND SUCH AMOUNT
 SHALL BE PAID IN A MANNER DETERMINED BY THE COURT.
  7. A VALIDLY EXECUTED AGREEMENT  OR  STIPULATION  VOLUNTARILY  ENTERED
 INTO  BETWEEN  THE  PARTIES  AFTER  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE OF THIS SECTION
 PRESENTED TO THE COURT FOR INCORPORATION IN AN ORDER OR  JUDGMENT  SHALL
 INCLUDE  A  PROVISION  STATING THAT THE PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION  SHALL  BE
 CONSTRUED  TO  ALTER THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES TO VOLUNTARILY ENTER INTO
 VALIDLY EXECUTED AGREEMENTS OR STIPULATIONS WHICH DEVIATE FROM THE CHILD
 SUPPORT OBLIGATION PROVIDED HEREIN  PROVIDED  THAT  SUCH  AGREEMENTS  OR
 STIPULATIONS COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  8.  IN  ADDITION  TO  FINANCIAL  DISCLOSURE  REQUIRED  IN SECTION FOUR
 HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR-A OF THIS ARTICLE, THE COURT MAY  REQUIRE  THAT  THE
 INCOME  AND/OR  EXPENSES  OF  ANY  PARTY  BE VERIFIED WITH DOCUMENTATION
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PAST  AND  PRESENT  INCOME  TAX  RETURNS,
 EMPLOYER  STATEMENTS,  PAY  STUBS,  CORPORATE,  BUSINESS, OR PARTNERSHIP
 BOOKS AND RECORDS, CORPORATE AND BUSINESS TAX RETURNS, AND RECEIPTS  FOR
 EXPENSES  OR  SUCH  OTHER  MEANS OF VERIFICATION AS THE COURT DETERMINES
 APPROPRIATE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT ANY  PARTY'S  RIGHT  TO  PURSUE
 DISCOVERY PURSUANT TO THIS CHAPTER OR THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES.
  9.  THE  COURT  SHALL RETAIN DISCRETION IN DETERMINING (A) THE DATE BY
 WHICH A VEHICULAR ASSAILANT SHALL BE REQUIRED TO BEGIN THE CHILD SUPPORT
 PAYMENTS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND (B) THE DURATION OF TIME OF SUCH PAYMENTS,
 GIVING DUE ACCOUNT TO THE AGE OF THE SURVIVING CHILD AND THE  LENGTH  OF
 THE  VEHICULAR  ASSAILANT'S  INCARCERATION,  PROVIDED THAT CHILD SUPPORT
 PAYMENTS SHALL ONLY BE ORDERED FOR SURVIVING CHILDREN WHO ARE UNDER  THE
 AGE  OF  TWENTY-ONE  AT  THE  TIME OF THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME BY THE
 VEHICULAR ASSAILANT WHICH CAUSED THE DEATH  OF  SUCH  SURVIVING  CHILD'S
 DECEASED PARENT OR GUARDIAN.

  10.  IF A SURVIVING CHILD ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CHILD SUPPORT UNDER THIS
 SECTION  HAS  BEEN  PLACED  IN  THE  CUSTODY  OF A LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES
 DISTRICT IN EITHER FOSTER CARE  OR  A  RESIDENTIAL  FACILITY,  THEN  ANY
 SUPPORT  ORDERED  UNDER  THIS  SECTION SHALL BE PAID TO THE LOCAL SOCIAL
 SERVICES DISTRICT RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH PLACEMENT OR FACILITY.
  11.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER  PROVISION  OF  THIS SECTION TO THE
 CONTRARY, THE AMOUNT OF THE CHILD SUPPORT  OBLIGATION  DESCRIBED  HEREIN
 SHALL  BE  REDUCED  BY THE AMOUNT OF ANY CIVIL AWARD PAID BY A VEHICULAR
 ASSAILANT TO A SURVIVING CHILD OR SURVIVING PARENT OR GUARDIAN  PURSUANT
 TO  AN  ACTION BROUGHT AGAINST SUCH ASSAILANT BY SUCH CHILD OR PARENT OR
 GUARDIAN.
