  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph a of subdivision 2 of section 235 of the  vehicle
 and  traffic  law, as separately amended by chapters 421, 460 and 773 of
 the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  a. Notice. (1) Whenever a city issues a  notice  of  violation  for  a
 parking violation, it shall be served in the manner prescribed by subdi-
 vision two of section two hundred thirty-eight of this article.
  (2)  Whenever  a  person  has  been issued a notice of violation for a
 parking violation and has not responded in the manner described  in  the
 notice,  a city shall give the owner a second notice of the violation by
 regular first class mail: (i) within forty days of issuance of the first
 notice of violation for a parking violation where the vehicle is a vehi-
 cle registered in this state; or (ii) within forty days of  the  receipt
 by  such  city of the name and address of the owner of the vehicle where
 the vehicle is a vehicle registered in  any  other  state.  Such  second
 notice shall include, but not be limited to, the following information:
  (A)  that  the  owner has a period of twenty days from issuance of the

  (C) [that failure to respond to the notice of violation for a  parking
 violation  may  subject the owner to additional penalties as provided in
 paragraph b of this subdivision;

 paragraph [c] B  of  this  subdivision  [and  the  additional  penalties
 imposed upon parking violations pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivi-
 sion]; and
  [(E)] (D) that submission of a plea of guilty to the parking violation
 makes  the  owner  liable for payment of the stated fine [and additional
 penalties imposed pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivision]  and  the
 mandatory  surcharge  of fifteen dollars imposed upon parking violations
 pursuant to section eighteen hundred nine-a of this chapter.
  § 2. Paragraphs b, b-1 and b-2 of subdivision 2 of section 235 of  the
 vehicle and traffic law are REPEALED and paragraph c of subdivision 2 is
 relettered paragraph b.
  § 3. Subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (c) of subdivision 2-a of section
 238  of the vehicle and traffic law, as added by chapter 409 of the laws
 of 2001, is amended to read as follows:
  (iii) Upon a finding by a hearing examiner that  the  dismissal  of  a
 charged  parking  violation  has been procured due to the knowing fraud,
 false testimony, misrepresentation, or other misconduct, or the  knowing
 alteration of a notice of parking violation, by the person so charged or
 his  or  her  agent, employee, or representative, the dismissal shall be
 set aside and a determination may be rendered against the owner  on  the
 charged  parking  violation.  The  hearing  examiner may impose monetary
 penalties for the charged parking violation of up  to  three  times  the
 scheduled  fine for the violation [and three times the additional penal-
 ties that may be imposed for failure to respond to a notice of violation
 pursuant to section two  hundred  thirty-five  of  this  article.  For
 purposes  of  determining  the  amount of such additional penalties, the
 hearing examiner shall disregard the plea that  procured  the  dismissal
 that  has  been set aside and shall calculate such penalties as if there
 had been no plea or appearance in the  proceeding].  In  any  proceeding
 under  this  paragraph to set aside a determination and to impose penal-
 ties for the violation, it shall not be necessary for the hearing  exam-
 iner  to find that the owner personally committed the unlawful acts that
 procured the dismissal of the violation.
  § 4. The vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 238-a to read as follows:
  §  238-A. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN LATE FEES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY INCON-
 SISTENT PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE, OR ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, OR LOCAL LAW
 OR ADMINISTRATIVE CODE TO THE CONTRARY, AN OWNER SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO
 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A NOTICE OF VIOLATION BUT
 ONLY, IN THE EVENT SUCH OWNER IS FOUND LIABLE FOR SUCH VIOLATION,  FAIL-
 URE TO PAY THE IMPOSED FINE IN A TIMELY FASHION.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
