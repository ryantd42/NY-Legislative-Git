 AN  ACT  to  amend  the public authorities law, in relation to exempting
  ambulances and emergency medical services vehicles from  paying  tolls
  on the New York state thruway when engaged in an emergency operation

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 378-a of the public authorities law,  as  added  by
 chapter 23 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  § 378-a. Emergency service permits. 1. The authority is hereby author-
 ized  and directed to [issue refunds for tolls incurred by ambulances or
 fire vehicles engaged in an emergency operation, or, at  the  option  of
 the  authority,  to]  issue  emergency services permits for use by ambu-
 lances, EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES VEHICLES,  and  fire  vehicles  which
 shall  provide for travel at no charge between interchanges and barriers
 while such vehicles are engaged in an emergency operation. For  purposes
 of  this  section,  the  term "ambulance" shall have the same meaning as
 such term is defined by section one hundred-b of the vehicle and traffic
 law, the term "fire vehicle" shall have the same meaning as such term is
 defined by section one hundred fifteen-a of the vehicle and traffic law,
 and the term "emergency operation" shall have the same meaning  as  such
 term  is  defined  by  section one hundred fourteen-b of the vehicle and
 traffic law. FOR THE PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION,  THE  TERM  "EMERGENCY
 MEDICAL  SERVICES  VEHICLE"  SHALL  MEAN AN APPROPRIATELY EQUIPPED MOTOR
 VEHICLE OWNED OR OPERATED BY AN EMERGENCY  MEDICAL  SERVICES  AGENCY  AS
 DEFINED  IN SECTION THREE THOUSAND ONE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW AND USED
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSPORTING EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL  AND  EQUIP-
 MENT TO SICK OR INJURED PERSONS. In any rules and regulations promulgat-
 ed  for  the implementation of this section, the authority may establish
 the type of documentation or other proof satisfactory to  the  authority

 that  an ambulance or fire vehicle was engaged in an emergency operation
 at the time a toll was incurred.
  2. If, upon the completion of an audit conducted by a certified public
 accountant selected by the authority, the authority can demonstrate that
 the issuance of [refunds or] permits as authorized in subdivision one of
 this  section causes a significant loss of revenue to the authority, the
 authority is authorized, pursuant to a resolution of the board, to offer
 such [refunds or] permits at a discount  of  the  cash  cost  per  mile;
 provided,  however,  that, prior to such board resolution, the authority
 shall hold at least two public hearings, at a time  and  location  which
 will,  to  the  extent  practicable,  maximize  the participation of the
 general public.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
