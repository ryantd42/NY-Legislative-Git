 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to the  issuance
  of permits to exempt ambulances and fire vehicles from paying tolls on
  the New York state thruway when engaged in an emergency operation
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 378-a of the public authorities law,  as  added  by
 chapter 23 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  § 378-a. Emergency service permits. 1. The authority is hereby author-
 ized  and directed to [issue refunds for tolls incurred by ambulances or
 fire vehicles engaged in an emergency operation, or, at  the  option  of
 the  authority,  to]  issue  emergency services permits for use by ambu-
 lances and fire vehicles which shall provide for  travel  at  no  charge
 between  interchanges and barriers while such vehicles are engaged in an
 emergency operation. For purposes of this section, the term  "ambulance"
 shall  have  the  same  meaning  as  such term is defined by section one
 hundred-b of the vehicle and traffic law, the term "fire vehicle"  shall
 have  the  same  meaning  as such term is defined by section one hundred
 fifteen-a of the vehicle and traffic law, and the term "emergency opera-
 tion" shall have the same meaning as such term is defined by section one

 hundred fourteen-b of the vehicle and traffic  law.  In  any  rules  and
 regulations  promulgated  for  the  implementation  of this section, the
 authority may establish the type of documentation or other proof  satis-
 factory  to  the authority that an ambulance or fire vehicle was engaged
 in an emergency operation at the time a toll was incurred.
  2. If, upon the completion of an audit conducted by a certified public
 accountant selected by the authority, the authority can demonstrate that
 the issuance of [refunds or] permits as authorized in subdivision one of
 this section causes a significant loss of revenue to the authority,  the
 authority is authorized, pursuant to a resolution of the board, to offer
 such  [refunds  or]  permits  at  a  discount of the cash cost per mile;
 provided, however, that, prior to such board resolution,  the  authority
 shall  hold  at  least two public hearings, at a time and location which
 will, to the extent  practicable,  maximize  the  participation  of  the
 general public.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
