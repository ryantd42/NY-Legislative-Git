  2.  Except as may be provided in regulations of the secretary pursuant
 to subdivision one of this section, every local government shall  admin-
 ister  and enforce the uniform fire prevention and building code and the

 of  January,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-four,  provided, however, that a
 local government may enact a local law prior to the first day of July in
 any year providing that it will not enforce such codes on and after  the
 first  day  of [January] APRIL next succeeding. In such event the county
 in which said local government is situated shall administer and  enforce
 such  codes within such local government from and after the first day of
 [January] APRIL next succeeding the effective date of such local law, in
 accordance with the provisions of paragraph b  of  subdivision  five  of
 this  section unless the county shall have enacted a local law providing
 that it will not enforce such codes within that county.  In  such  event
 the  secretary  in  the  place  and stead of the local government shall,
 directly or by contract, administer and enforce the uniform code and the
 state energy conservation construction code IN SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT  ON
 AND  AFTER  THE  FIRST DAY OF APRIL NEXT SUCCEEDING. IN THE EVENT THAT A

 NEXT  SUCCEEDING.  A local government or a county may repeal a local law
 which provides that it will not enforce such codes and shall  thereafter

 governments may provide for joint administration and enforcement of  the
 uniform  code, the state energy conservation construction code, or both,
 by agreement pursuant to article five-G of the  general  municipal  law.
 Any  local  government may enter into agreement with the county in which
 such local government is situated to administer and enforce the  uniform
 code,  the  state energy conservation construction code, or both, within
 such local government.  Local governments or counties may charge fees to
 defray the costs of administration and enforcement.

 chapter 707 of the laws of 1981, is amended to read as follows:
  4.  If  the secretary determines that a local government has failed to
 administer and enforce the uniform fire prevention and building code  in
 accordance  with  the minimum standards promulgated pursuant to subdivi-
 sion one of this section, the secretary shall take any of the  following
 actions, either individually or in combination in any sequence:
  a.  The  secretary  may  issue  an order compelling compliance by such
 local government with the standards for administration  and  enforcement
 of the uniform code.
  b.  THE  SECRETARY MAY APPOINT, AND AT HIS OR HER PLEASURE REMOVE, ANY

 BY  THE  OVERSIGHT OFFICER TO BE NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO ENSURE THAT
