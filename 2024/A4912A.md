 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  arts  and  cultural affairs law, in relation to

  organizations that  advocate  for  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion,
  racial and social justice, and cultural preservation
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 3.01 of  the  arts  and  cultural  affairs  law  is
 amended to read as follows:
  § 3.01. Legislative  findings  and declaration of policy. It is hereby
 found that many of our citizens lack the opportunity to view,  enjoy  or
 participate  in  living  CULTURAL  AND  theatrical performances, musical
 concerts, operas, dance and  ballet  recitals,  art  exhibits,  CULTURAL
 EXHIBITS,  examples  of  fine  architecture, and the performing and fine
 arts generally, AND THAT SUCH LACK IS EXACERBATED BY RACIAL  AND  SOCIAL
 INEQUITIES.  It  is hereby further found that, with increasing leisure
 time, the practice and enjoyment of the arts AND CULTURE are of increas-
 ing importance and that the general welfare of the people of  the  state
 will  be  promoted by giving further recognition to the arts AND CULTURE
 as a vital aspect of our culture and heritage and as a valued  means  of
 expanding  the  scope of our educational programs AND FUNDING TO REFLECT
 CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND EQUITY.
  It is hereby declared to be the policy  of  the  state  to  join  with
 private patrons and with institutions [and], professional organizations,
 AND CULTURE-BASED ORGANIZATIONS concerned with [the] arts AND CULTURE to
 insure  that  CULTURAL  PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND the role of the
 arts in the life of our communities will continue to grow and will  play

 an  ever more significant part in the welfare and educational experience
 of our citizens and in maintaining the paramount position of this  state
 in the nation and in the world as a cultural center.
  It  is further declared that all activities undertaken by the state in
 carrying out this  policy  shall  be  directed  toward  encouraging  and
 assisting  rather  than in any ways limiting the freedom of artistic AND
 CULTURAL expression that is essential for the well-being of the arts AND
 CULTURE. IN FURTHERANCE THEREOF, IT IS HEREBY DECLARED TO BE THE  POLICY
