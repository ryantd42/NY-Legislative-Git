 SYMPTOMS  DIRECTLY  RELATED  TO THE CONDITION FOR WHICH A CLAIM IS BEING
 MADE.
  A CONDITION FOR WHICH COVERAGE IS AFFORDED ON A POLICY  SHALL  NOT  BE
 CONSIDERED A PREEXISTING CONDITION ON ANY RENEWAL OF THE POLICY.
  (7)  "RENEWAL"  MEANS  TO ISSUE AND DELIVER AT THE END OF AN INSURANCE
 POLICY PERIOD A POLICY WHICH SUPERSEDES A POLICY PREVIOUSLY  ISSUED  AND

 THE POLICY BEING SUPERSEDED.

 AFFECTED  BY THE HAPPENING OF SUCH EVENT, IT IS TRANSACTING IN THE BUSI-
 NESS OF INSURANCE AND IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CHAPTER. THIS

 BEING THE BUSINESS OF INSURANCE, UNLESS OTHER INDICATIONS  OF  INSURANCE
 ALSO EXIST.
