 NURSING HOME SHALL:
  (A)  NOT DENY IN-PERSON ACCESS TO A RESIDENT BY AN ESSENTIAL CAREGIVER
 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION;
  (B) ALLOW AT LEAST ONE ESSENTIAL  CAREGIVER  TO  HAVE  ACCESS  TO  AND
 PROVIDE  ASSISTANCE  TO  SUCH RESIDENT AT SUCH FACILITY EVERY DAY AND AT

 ESSENTIAL CAREGIVER AND THE RESIDENT, IN WRITING, CITING SPECIFIC ISSUES
 OF NON-COMPLIANCE AND PROVIDING CLEAR GUIDANCE FOR CORRECTIVE MEASURES.
  (D) IF AN ESSENTIAL CAREGIVER OR RESIDENT, AFTER RECEIVING A NOTIFICA-

 FAILS TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION, THE ESSENTIAL CAREGIVER MAY SUBSEQUENT-
 LY BE DENIED ACCESS TO THE RESIDENT. IN SUCH CASES, THE  FACILITY  SHALL
 PROVIDE  TO  SUCH  CAREGIVER  AND SUCH RESIDENT (OR HEALTH CARE PROXY OF

 ACCESS OCCURS, A WRITTEN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY SUCH CAREGIVER WAS DENIED

  (C) UPON APPEAL OF A DENIAL OF ACCESS, THE NURSING HOME SHALL HAVE THE
 BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING THAT THE ESSENTIAL CAREGIVER VIOLATED ANY  PROTO-
 COLS APPLICABLE TO AN ESSENTIAL CAREGIVER.
  (D)  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A NURSING
 HOME VIOLATED A REQUIREMENT OR PROHIBITION OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  WITHIN
 FORTY-EIGHT  HOURS OF COMMENCING ITS INVESTIGATION. IF THE AGENCY DETER-
 MINES THAT A FACILITY HAS VIOLATED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS  SECTION,  THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL:
  (I)  REQUIRE  THE  FACILITY TO ALLOW IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO THE ESSENTIAL
 CAREGIVER IN QUESTION;
  (II) REQUIRE THE FACILITY TO ESTABLISH A  CORRECTIVE  ACTION  PLAN  TO
 PREVENT  THE  RECURRENCE  OF SUCH VIOLATION WITHIN A SEVEN-DAY PERIOD OF
 RECEIVING NOTICE FROM THE AGENCY; AND
