  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 5-11, 2023, as School Social Work Week in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to inform key audiences about the role
and value of school social workers  in  caring  for  our  most  precious
resource, our youth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March 5-11, 2023, as
School Social Work Week in the State of New York,  in  conjunction  with
the observance of National School Social Work Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The theme for National School Social Work Week 2023 is "We
Rise."; School Social Workers  rise  up  -  supporting  their  students,
families, and school communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The importance of school social work through the inclusion
of school social work programs and services has been recognized  in  the
Elementary  and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.)
and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C.  1400  et
seq.); and
 
  WHEREAS,  School social workers serve as vital members of a school's
education team, playing a central role in creating partnerships  between
the home, school, and community to ensure student academic success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  social workers are especially skilled in providing
services to students who face  serious  challenges  to  school  success,
including  disability,  poverty,  discrimination, abuse, neglect, mental
illness, homelessness, bullying, familial stressors, and other  barriers
to learning; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School social workers are more necessary now than any time
in recent memory, as  more  students  are  struggling  with  mental  and
behavioral  health  disorders,  with  nearly one in six children, two to
eight years old (17.4%),  having  a  diagnosed  mental,  behavioral,  or
developmental disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Those  who wish to access community mental health services
often find them unavailable, inaccessible, or inadequate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  mental  health  programs  are  critical  to  early
identification of and early intervention for mental health problems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  social  workers,  being  licensed  mental  health
professionals  in  our  schools,  provide  necessary  assessment,
interventions, counseling, family outreach, and community referrals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fewer  than  one in five children in need of mental health
services actually receive these services, and  research  indicates  that
 
school mental health programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing
absences,  dropout  rates,  and  discipline  referrals,  while improving
academic achievement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration of School Social Work Week highlights the
vital role school social workers play in the lives of  students  in  New
York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  March  5-11,  2023,  as
School  Social  Work  Week  in  the  State of New York, and to honor and
recognize the contributions of school social workers to the  success  of
students in schools across the State, as well as encourage the people of
New  York  State  to  observe  School  Social Work Week with appropriate
activities that promote awareness of the vital  role  of  school  social
workers,  in  schools  and in the community helping students prepare for
their futures as productive, engaged citizens; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York and to the School Social Work Association of America.
