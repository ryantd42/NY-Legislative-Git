 tion of New York state upon decision after due hearing that the individ-
 ual is guilty of the following misconduct:
  (d)  aiding  and  abetting  in the practice of radiologic technology a

 PERSON'S application for a license  refused,  revoked  or  suspended  or
 having  voluntarily  or otherwise surrendered [his or her] SUCH PERSON'S
 license after a disciplinary action was instituted by a duly  authorized
 professional  disciplinary  agency  of  another state, where the conduct
 resulting in the revocation, suspension  or  other  disciplinary  action
 involving  the license or refusal, revocation or suspension of an appli-
 cation for a license or the surrender of the license would, if committed

 licensed in New York state who is also licensed or seeking licensure  in
 another  state must immediately report to the department any revocation,
 suspension or  other  disciplinary  action  involving  the  out-of-state
 license  or  refusal,  revocation or suspension of an application for an
 out-of-state license or the surrender of the out-of-state license.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
