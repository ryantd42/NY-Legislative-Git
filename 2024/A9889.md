  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Joanne De Vito, who was employed as a camp counselor with  the  Town  of
 Poestenkill  with  a  start date of July 1, 1985, and who is currently a
 member of the New York state and local employees' retirement system with
 the department of transportation, who through no fault of  her  own  did
 not  become  a member of the New York state and local employees' retire-
 ment system on July 1, 1985 when first employed by the Town of  Poesten-
 kill  shall  be  deemed  to have been a member of the New York state and
 local employees' retirement  system  on  such  date  she  commenced  her
 employment  and shall be granted Tier IV status, provided that an appli-
 cation is filed with the head of the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system within one year from the effective date of  this  act.
 Upon  the  granting of such retroactive membership, Joanne De Vito shall
 not be granted a refund of any employee contributions made by her to the
 New York state and local employees' retirement system.
  § 2. All past services costs associated  with  the  implementation  of
 this act shall be borne by the Town of Poestenkill.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  grant Tier 4 status in the New York State and Local
 Employees' Retirement System to Joanne De Vito, a current Tier 6  member
 employed by the New York State Department of Transportation, by changing
 their date of membership to July 1, 1985, their first date of employment
 with the Town of Poestenkill. There will be no refund of member contrib-
 utions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $5,300 in the
 annual contributions of the State of New York for the fiscal year ending

 March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the billing rates
 and salary of Joanne De Vito change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $15,100 which will be
 borne by the Town of Poestenkill as a one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
