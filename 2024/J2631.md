  COMMEMORATING  the  52nd Annual Madison-Bouckville
  Antique Show, hosted August 12-18, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute  to
those  events of historical, artistic, social, and cultural significance
whose contributions further the enrichment of our communities,  as  well
as  provide a positive effect on the local and State economies at large;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 52nd Annual Madison-Bouckville Antique Show  of  Madison
County,  New  York, taking place during Madison Bouckville Antique Week,
August 12-18, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Madison-Bouckville Antique Show encompasses a  two-mile
stretch  of  historic  Route  20  through  the  towns  of  Madison  and
Bouckville, New York, allowing for over  2,000  vendors  to  sell  their
antiques and collectibles from the past; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State's  largest  antique  show,  the
Madison-Bouckville  Antique  Show,  prides  itself  in  offering  free
admission  to  all  attendees,  an  abundance of accessible parking, and
eclectic food trucks, drawing in countless  attendees  from  across  the
State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  occasion  such as this revered event is vital to local
businesses and vendors and the local and State  economy  at  large;  the
opportunity  to  sell  one's goods, meet people of similar interests and
professions, and learn about the history of the region at this scale and
its importance to  the  residents  of  this  great  State  must  not  be
undermined nor overlooked; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the past 52 years, the Madison-Bouckville Antique Show
has  demonstrated  an  unrelenting  commitment  to providing historical,
artistic, social, and cultural enrichment, and as a result, has  brought
pride  and  recognition  to  its local community and to our great Empire
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  52nd  Annual  Madison-Bouckville  Antique Show, hosted
August 12-18, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the organizers of the Madison-Bouckville Antique Show.
