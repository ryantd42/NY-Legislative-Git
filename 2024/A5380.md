  §  2.  Legislative  findings  and intent. The legislature finds that a
 tragically large number of children have  been  accidentally  killed  or
 seriously  injured  by  negligently stored weapons; that placing weapons
 within reach or easy access of  children  is  irresponsible,  encourages
 such  accidents and should be prohibited; and that legislative action is
 necessary to protect the safety of our children.
  § 3. Section 265.00 of the penal law is amended  by  adding  five  new
 subdivisions 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40 to read as follows:

 AMMUNITION CONTAINED THEREIN. THE DIVISION OF STATE POLICE SHALL DEVELOP
 AND  PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS SETTING FORTH THE SPECIFIC DEVICES
 OR THE MINIMUM STANDARDS  AND  CRITERIA  THEREFOR  WHICH  CONSTITUTE  AN
 EFFECTIVE LOCKED BOX.
  38.  "GUN  LOCKING  DEVICE"  MEANS  AN INTEGRATED DESIGN FEATURE OR AN
