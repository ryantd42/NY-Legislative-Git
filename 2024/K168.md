  WHEREAS, Around 10 a.m., Jason  D.  Arno,  a  three-year  member  of
Buffalo  Fire  Department  Engine  2,  stationed  at  Elmwood Avenue and
Virginia Street  in  the  neighborhood  of  Allentown,  was  fighting  a
four-alarm blaze at DC Theatricks on Main Street when work being done on
the  structure with blowtorches appeared to cause a backdraft which sent
flames shooting out  of  the  three-story  building  in  what  at  first
appeared to be an explosion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighter  Jason  D.  Arno  was  caught  in  the partial
building collapse and trapped about 30-40 feet  inside;  the  department
lost  contact  with  him  shortly  after  a mayday call came through the
radio, and unfortunately, due to the ferocity of the  fire,  his  fellow
firefighters  could  not reach him and he succumbed to the deadly blaze;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon the recovery of his body, Firefighter  Jason  D.  Arno
was  solemnly  greeted  by  his  comrades  who  gave him a stoic salute,
honoring his bravery and memorializing the loss of a young man who lived
a meritorious life of service to his beloved Buffalo community; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, Mayor Byron W. Brown has asked  for  buildings
and  other  structures  and  landmarks, including Buffalo City Hall, the
Peace Bridge and Niagara Falls, to be lit up in red through  Sunday  and
directed all City of Buffalo flags to be flown at half-mast; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  on  August  27,  1985,  Jason D. Arno graduated from
Canisius High School in 2003; during high school, he played football for
the Crusaders, winning postseason accolades during his junior year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Predeceased by his stepfather, John, Firefighter  Jason  D.
Arno  is  survived  by his wife, the former Sarah-Elizabeth Tierney; one

  WHEREAS,  Jason  D.  Arno's  greatest  joy  in  life was his family,
everything in his life came second to his daughter, who  was  his  pride
and joy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jason  D.  Arno  was known for his strong work ethic, warm
smile, and for being an all-around good guy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Armed with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a  sense  of
compassion,  Firefighter Jason D. Arno leaves behind a legacy which will
long endure the passage of time and will remain as a  comforting  memory
to all who were privileged to have known and loved such an amazing young
man;  he  will be deeply missed and truly merits the grateful tribute of
