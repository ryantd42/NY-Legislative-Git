 within the political subdivision of such board for  whom  a  designation
 has been filed with the state board; the title of the office or position
 for  which the candidate is designated; the name of the party upon whose
 primary ballot his or her name is to be placed; and the order  in  which
 the names of the candidates are to be printed as determined by the state
