 Oneida imposes sales and compensating use taxes at a rate which  is  one
 percent  additional  to  the  three  percent  rate authorized by section

 where  a  city  in  such county imposes tax pursuant to the authority of

 utilizing figures from the latest decennial federal  census  or  special

 such  allocation  is  made, which special census must include the entire
 area of such county, to be allocated and distributed among the towns  of
 Oneida  county  by  appropriation of its board of legislators; provided,
 further, that nothing herein shall require such board of legislators  to
