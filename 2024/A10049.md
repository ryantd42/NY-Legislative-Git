 DISCOVERABLE  INFORMATION  UNDER PARAGRAPH (F) OR (O) OF SUBDIVISION ONE
 OF THIS SECTION IS UNAVAILABLE FOR DISCLOSURE  WITHIN  THE  TIME  PERIOD
 SPECIFIED  IN  SUBDIVISION  TWO OF SECTION 331.2 OF THIS PART, SUCH TIME

 COMPLIANCE  WITH A COURT ORDER UNDER SECTION 331.12 OF THIS PART. HOWEV-
 ER, IF IN THE JUDGMENT OF EITHER PARTY, GOOD CAUSE EXISTS FOR  DECLINING

 A  PROTECTIVE  ORDER  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  331.11  OF  THIS  PART  AND
 PRODUCTION  OF  THE  ITEM SHALL BE STAYED PENDING A RULING BY THE COURT.
 THE OPPOSING PARTY SHALL BE NOTIFIED IN WRITING THAT INFORMATION HAS NOT

  § 331.4. DISCLOSURE PRIOR TO AN ADMISSION BY THE RESPONDENT; WAIVER OF
 DISCOVERY BY RESPONDENT.  1. DISCLOSURE OF CRIME. WHERE THE  PRESENTMENT
 AGENCY  HAS  MADE  AN  OFFER  TO ACCEPT AN ADMISSION PURSUANT TO SECTION
 321.3 OF THIS ARTICLE TO AN ACT THAT, IF COMMITTED BY AN ADULT, WOULD BE
 A CRIME, THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY SHALL DISCLOSE TO  THE  RESPONDENT,  AND
 PERMIT  THE  RESPONDENT TO DISCOVER, INSPECT, COPY, PHOTOGRAPH AND TEST,
 ALL ITEMS AND INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE DISCOVERABLE PRIOR TO THE  FACT-
 FINDING  HEARING UNDER SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 331.3 OF THIS PART AND

 PRESENTMENT AGENCY SHALL DISCLOSE THE DISCOVERABLE ITEMS AND INFORMATION

 OFFER  BY THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY FOR THE RESPONDENT TO MAKE AN ADMISSION
 OR ANY DEADLINE IMPOSED BY THE COURT FOR ACCEPTANCE OF THE OFFER  OF  AN
 ADMISSION.
  2.  TIMING  OF  DISCLOSURE.  IF THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY DOES NOT COMPLY
 WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS  SUBDIVISION,  THEN,  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY
 OTHER  PROVISION  OF  LAW,  SUCH  OFFER SHALL BE DEEMED AVAILABLE TO THE
 RESPONDENT UNTIL THREE CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE  PRESENTMENT  AGENCY  HAS
 COMPLIED,  ABSENT  EXTRAORDINARY  CIRCUMSTANCES  INVOLVING  NEW  ADVERSE
 INFORMATION BEARING ON THE RESPONDENT OCCURRING  OR  DISCOVERED  IN  THE
 INTERIM THAT, AFTER APPROPRIATE NOTICE AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING,
 ARE  SHOWN  BY  THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY AND FOUND BY THE COURT. WHERE THE
 OFFER OF AN ADMISSION HAS LAPSED OR BEEN WITHDRAWN IN LIGHT OF  NON-COM-
 PLIANCE  BY THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY WITH THIS SUBDIVISION, THE RESPONDENT
 MAY MAKE A MOTION ALLEGING  SUCH  NON-COMPLIANCE  AND  THE  COURT  SHALL
 CONSIDER  THE  IMPACT OF ANY NON-COMPLIANCE ON THE RESPONDENT'S DECISION
 TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE OFFER OF AN ADMISSION. IF THE COURT  FINDS  THAT
 THE  NON-COMPLIANCE MATERIALLY AFFECTED THE RESPONDENT'S DECISION AND IF
 THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY DECLINES TO REINSTATE  THE  LAPSED  OR  WITHDRAWN
 PLEA OFFER, THE COURT, AS A PRESUMPTIVE MINIMUM SANCTION, SHALL PRECLUDE
 THE  ADMISSION  AT TRIAL OF ANY EVIDENCE NOT DISCLOSED AS REQUIRED UNDER
 THIS SUBDIVISION.  THE COURT  MAY  TAKE  OTHER  ADDITIONAL  APPROPRIATE
 ACTION AS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE NON-COMPLIANCE.
  3.  EXCEPTION. THE RIGHTS UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION DO NOT APPLY TO ITEMS
 OR INFORMATION THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER UNDER  SECTION
 331.11  OF  THIS  PART; BUT IF SUCH INFORMATION TENDS TO BE EXCULPATORY,
 THE COURT SHALL RECONSIDER THE PROTECTIVE ORDER.
  4. WAIVER. A RESPONDENT MAY PROVIDE A VOLUNTARY, KNOWING AND  INTELLI-
 GENT  WAIVER  IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS OR HER COUNSEL OF HIS OR HER RIGHTS
 UNDER THIS SECTION; BUT AN OFFER OF AN ADMISSION MAY NOT BE  CONDITIONED
 ON SUCH WAIVER.
  § 331.5. COURT ORDERS FOR PRESERVATION, ACCESS OR DISCOVERY. 1.  ORDER
 TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE. AT ANY TIME, A PARTY MAY MOVE FOR A COURT ORDER TO
 ANY INDIVIDUAL, AGENCY OR OTHER ENTITY IN POSSESSION, CUSTODY OR CONTROL
 OF ITEMS WHICH RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CASE OR ARE OTHERWISE
 RELEVANT,  REQUIRING THAT SUCH ITEMS BE PRESERVED FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD
 OF TIME.  THE COURT SHALL HEAR AND RULE UPON SUCH MOTIONS EXPEDITIOUSLY.
 THE COURT MAY MODIFY OR VACATE SUCH AN ORDER UPON A SHOWING THAT PRESER-
 VATION OF PARTICULAR EVIDENCE WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP  TO  SUCH
 A. 10049  10
 
 INDIVIDUAL,  AGENCY  OR ENTITY, ON CONDITION THAT THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF
 THAT EVIDENCE IS PRESERVED BY A SPECIFIED ALTERNATIVE MEANS.
  2.  ORDER TO GRANT ACCESS TO PREMISES. AT ANY TIME, THE RESPONDENT MAY
 MOVE FOR A COURT ORDER TO ANY INDIVIDUAL,  AGENCY  OR  OTHER  ENTITY  IN
 POSSESSION,  CUSTODY  OR CONTROL OF A CRIME SCENE OR OTHER PREMISES THAT
 RELATES TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE  CASE  OR  IS  OTHERWISE  RELEVANT,
 REQUIRING  THAT COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENT BE GRANTED PROMPT AND REASON-
 ABLE ACCESS TO INSPECT, PHOTOGRAPH OR MEASURE SUCH CRIME SCENE OR  PREM-
 ISES,  AND  THAT  THE  CONDITION  OF  THE CRIME SCENE OR PREMISES REMAIN
 UNCHANGED IN THE INTERIM. THE  COURT  SHALL  CONSIDER  THE  RESPONDENT'S
 EXPRESSED  NEED  FOR  ACCESS TO THE PREMISES INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THE
 RESPONDENT WILL BE DEPRIVED OF EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION RELEVANT  TO  THE
 CASE, THE POSITION OF ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY WITH POSSESSORY OR OWNER-
 SHIP  RIGHTS TO THE PREMISES, THE NATURE OF THE PRIVACY INTEREST AND ANY
 PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL HARDSHIP OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY WITH POSSESSORY
 OR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS, AND THE POSITION OF  THE  PRESENTMENT  AGENCY  WITH
 RESPECT  TO  ANY  APPLICATION  FOR ACCESS TO THE PREMISES. THE COURT MAY
 DENY ACCESS TO THE PREMISES WHEN THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF ACCESS  TO  SUCH
 LOCATION  HAS  BEEN OR WILL BE PRESERVED BY SPECIFIED ALTERNATIVE MEANS.
 IF THE COURT GRANTS ACCESS TO THE PREMISES,  THE  INDIVIDUAL  OR  ENTITY
 WITH  OWNERSHIP  OR  POSSESSORY  RIGHTS  TO THE PREMISES MAY REQUEST LAW
 ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE AT THE PREMISES WHILE THE RESPONDENT'S COUNSEL OR A
 REPRESENTATIVE THEREOF IS PRESENT.
  3. DISCRETIONARY DISCOVERY BY ORDER OF THE COURT.  THE  COURT  IN  ITS
 DISCRETION  MAY,  UPON  A  SHOWING BY THE RESPONDENT THAT THE REQUEST IS
 REASONABLE AND THAT THE RESPONDENT IS UNABLE WITHOUT UNDUE  HARDSHIP  TO
 OBTAIN  THE SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENT BY OTHER MEANS, ORDER THE PRESENTMENT
 AGENCY, OR ANY INDIVIDUAL, AGENCY OR OTHER ENTITY SUBJECT TO THE  JURIS-
 DICTION OF THE COURT, TO MAKE AVAILABLE FOR DISCLOSURE TO THE RESPONDENT
 ANY  MATERIAL  OR  INFORMATION  WHICH POTENTIALLY RELATES TO THE SUBJECT
 MATTER OF THE CASE AND IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE MATERIAL.
  4. PROCEDURE. A MOTION UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE ON  NOTICE  TO  ANY
 INDIVIDUAL, AGENCY OR ENTITY AFFECTED BY THE ORDER. A MOTION MAY BE MADE
 ORALLY ON THE RECORD SO LONG AS SUCH NOTICE IS PROVIDED.  THE COURT MAY,
 ON  ITS OWN OR UPON REQUEST OF ANY INDIVIDUAL, AGENCY OR ENTITY AFFECTED
 BY THE ORDER, MODIFY OR VACATE THE ORDER IF COMPLIANCE WOULD  BE  UNREA-
 SONABLE  OR  WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP TO SUCH INDIVIDUAL, AGENCY
 OR ENTITY. FOR GOOD CAUSE SHOWN, THE COURT MAY PERMIT A PARTY SEEKING OR
 OPPOSING A DISCRETIONARY ORDER OF DISCOVERY UNDER THIS  SUBDIVISION,  OR
 ANOTHER  AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL, AGENCY OR ENTITY, TO SUBMIT PAPERS OR, FOR
 GOOD CAUSE SHOWN, TESTIFY ON THE RECORD EX PARTE OR IN CAMERA.  FOR GOOD
 CAUSE SHOWN, ANY SUCH PAPERS AND A TRANSCRIPT OF SUCH TESTIMONY  MAY  BE
 SEALED AND SHALL CONSTITUTE A PART OF THE RECORD ON APPEAL.
  §  331.6.  COURT  ORDERED PROCEDURES TO FACILITATE COMPLIANCE; CERTIF-
 ICATES OF COMPLIANCE. 1.  DISCRETION OF COURTS. TO FACILITATE COMPLIANCE
 WITH THIS PART, AND TO REDUCE OR STREAMLINE LITIGATION OF  ANY  DISPUTES
 ABOUT DISCOVERY, THE COURT IN ITS DISCRETION MAY ISSUE AN ORDER:

 PROVIDED  THE  DISCOVERY REQUIRED BY SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 331.3 OF
 THIS PART, EXCEPT FOR ANY ITEMS OR INFORMATION THAT ARE THE  SUBJECT  OF
 AN  ORDER  PURSUANT  TO SECTION 331.11 OF THIS PART, IT SHALL SERVE UPON
 THE RESPONDENT AND FILE WITH THE COURT A CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.  THE
 CERTIFICATE  OF  COMPLIANCE SHALL STATE THAT, AFTER EXERCISING DUE DILI-
 GENCE AND MAKING REASONABLE INQUIRIES  TO  ASCERTAIN  THE  EXISTENCE  OF
 MATERIAL  AND  INFORMATION  SUBJECT TO DISCOVERY, THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY
 HAS DISCLOSED AND MADE AVAILABLE  ALL  KNOWN  MATERIAL  AND  INFORMATION
 SUBJECT  TO  DISCOVERY.  IT  SHALL  ALSO IDENTIFY THE ITEMS PROVIDED. IF
 ADDITIONAL DISCOVERY IS SUBSEQUENTLY PROVIDED PRIOR TO THE  FACT-FINDING
 HEARING  PURSUANT  TO SECTION 331.9 OF THIS PART, A SUPPLEMENTAL CERTIF-
 ICATE SHALL BE SERVED UPON THE RESPONDENT AND FILED WITH THE COURT IDEN-
 TIFYING THE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL AND INFORMATION PROVIDED.  NO  ADVERSE
 CONSEQUENCE  TO  THE  PRESENTMENT  AGENCY OR THE PROSECUTOR SHALL RESULT
 FROM THE FILING OF A CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE IN GOOD  FAITH;  BUT  THE
 COURT  MAY  GRANT  A  REMEDY  OR  SANCTION  FOR A DISCOVERY VIOLATION AS
 PROVIDED IN SECTION 331.12 OF THIS PART.
  (B) WHEN THE RESPONDENT HAS PROVIDED ALL DISCOVERY REQUIRED BY  SUBDI-
 VISION  FOUR  OF  SECTION  331.3  OF  THIS PART, EXCEPT FOR ANY ITEMS OR
 INFORMATION THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF AN ORDER PURSUANT TO SECTION  331.11

 PART, A SUPPLEMENTAL CERTIFICATE SHALL BE SERVED  UPON  THE  PRESENTMENT
 AGENCY  AND FILED WITH THE COURT IDENTIFYING THE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL AND
 INFORMATION PROVIDED. NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCE TO THE RESPONDENT OR  COUN-
 SEL  FOR THE RESPONDENT SHALL RESULT FROM THE FILING OF A CERTIFICATE OF
 COMPLIANCE IN GOOD FAITH; BUT THE COURT MAY GRANT A REMEDY  OR  SANCTION

 TO  CONSTITUTIONAL  LIMITATIONS,  THE  COURT  MAY,  UPON  MOTION  OF THE
 PRESENTMENT AGENCY SHOWING PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THE RESPONDENT  HAS
 COMMITTED  THE  ACT  THAT  IF  COMMITTED  BY AN ADULT WOULD CONSTITUTE A
 CRIME, A CLEAR INDICATION THAT RELEVANT MATERIAL EVIDENCE WILL BE FOUND,
 AND THAT THE METHOD USED TO SECURE SUCH EVIDENCE IS SAFE  AND  RELIABLE,
 REQUIRE A RESPONDENT TO PROVIDE NON-TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING TO:
  (A) APPEAR IN A LINEUP;
  (B) SPEAK FOR IDENTIFICATION BY A WITNESS OR POTENTIAL WITNESS;

  (G)  SUBMIT  TO  A  REASONABLE  PHYSICAL  OR MEDICAL INSPECTION OF THE
 RESPONDENT'S BODY.
  2. LIMITATIONS. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO ALTER OR IN ANY
 WAY AFFECT THE ISSUANCE OF A SIMILAR COURT ORDER, AS MAY  BE  AUTHORIZED
 BY  LAW,  BEFORE THE FILING OF THE PETITION, CONSISTENT WITH SUCH RIGHTS
 AS THE RESPONDENT MAY DERIVE FROM THIS ARTICLE, THE  STATE  CONSTITUTION
 OR  THE  UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED
 TO ALTER OR IN ANY WAY AFFECT THE  ADMINISTRATION  OF  A  CHEMICAL  TEST
 WHERE  OTHERWISE  AUTHORIZED.  AN  ORDER PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MAY BE
 DENIED, LIMITED OR CONDITIONED AS PROVIDED IN  SECTION  331.11  OF  THIS
 PART.
  3.  DNA  COMPARISON  ORDER. WHERE PROPERTY IN THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY'S
 POSSESSION, CUSTODY, OR CONTROL CONSISTS OF A DNA PROFILE OBTAINED  FROM
 PROBATIVE  BIOLOGICAL  MATERIAL GATHERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTI-
 GATION OF THE CRIME, AND THE RESPONDENT  ESTABLISHES:  (A)  THAT  SUCH
 PROFILE  COMPLIES WITH FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION OR STATE REQUIRE-
 MENTS, WHICHEVER ARE APPLICABLE AND AS SUCH REQUIREMENTS ARE APPLIED  TO
 LAW  ENFORCEMENT  AGENCIES  SEEKING A KEYBOARD SEARCH OR SIMILAR COMPAR-
 ISON, AND (B) THAT THE DATA MEETS STATE DNA INDEX SYSTEM OR NATIONAL DNA
 INDEX SYSTEM CRITERIA AS SUCH CRITERIA ARE APPLIED  TO  LAW  ENFORCEMENT
 AGENCIES SEEKING SUCH A KEYBOARD SEARCH OR SIMILAR COMPARISON, THE COURT
 MAY,  UPON  MOTION  OF  A RESPONDENT AGAINST WHOM A PETITION IS PENDING,
 ORDER AN ENTITY THAT HAS ACCESS TO THE COMBINED DNA INDEX SYSTEM OR  ITS
 SUCCESSOR  SYSTEM  TO  COMPARE SUCH DNA PROFILE AGAINST DNA DATABANKS BY
 KEYBOARD SEARCHES, OR A SIMILAR METHOD THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE  UPLOADING,
 UPON  NOTICE  TO  BOTH  PARTIES  AND  THE ENTITY REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE
 SEARCH, UPON A SHOWING BY THE RESPONDENT THAT SUCH A COMPARISON IS MATE-
 RIAL TO THE PRESENTATION OF HIS OR HER DEFENSE AND THAT THE  REQUEST  IS
 REASONABLE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, A "KEYBOARD SEARCH" SHALL MEAN
 A SEARCH OF A DNA PROFILE AGAINST THE DATABANK IN WHICH THE PROFILE THAT
 IS SEARCHED IS NOT UPLOADED TO OR MAINTAINED IN THE DATABANK. NOTHING IN
 THIS SECTION AUTHORIZES THE TAKING OF A DNA PROFILE FROM THE RESPONDENT,
 WHETHER  TAKEN  FROM  THEIR  PERSON  OR  OTHERWISE,  UNLESS SPECIFICALLY
 AUTHORIZED BY LAW.

 RESPONDENT  AND  THE  OFFENSE  OR  OFFENSES  CHARGED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO, ANY EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION DISCOVERABLE UNDER PARAGRAPH (K)
 OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 331.3 OF THIS PART.
  2. PROVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY FILES. ABSENT A COURT ORDER  OR
 A  REQUIREMENT THAT THE RESPONDENT'S COUNSEL OBTAIN A SECURITY CLEARANCE
 MANDATED BY LAW OR AUTHORIZED GOVERNMENT REGULATION, UPON REQUEST BY THE
 PRESENTMENT AGENCY, EACH NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY
 SHALL MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY A COMPLETE  COPY  OF  ITS
 COMPLETE  RECORDS  AND FILES RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CASE OR
 RELATED TO THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PART.
 A. 10049  13

 RECORDINGS,  POLICE-WORN  BODY  CAMERA  RECORDINGS  AND  OTHER  POLICE
 RECORDINGS. (A) WHENEVER AN ELECTRONIC RECORDING OF A 911 TELEPHONE CALL
 OR A POLICE RADIO TRANSMISSION OR VIDEO OR AUDIO FOOTAGE FROM A  POLICE-
 WORN  BODY  CAMERA  OR  OTHER  POLICE  RECORDING WAS MADE OR RECEIVED IN
 CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF AN APPARENT CRIMINAL INCIDENT,  THE
 ARRESTING  OFFICER  OR  LEAD  DETECTIVE  SHALL  EXPEDITIOUSLY NOTIFY THE
 PRESENTMENT AGENCY IN WRITING UPON THE FILING OF  THE  PETITION  OF  THE
 EXISTENCE  OF  ALL  SUCH  KNOWN RECORDINGS. THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY SHALL
 EXPEDITIOUSLY TAKE WHATEVER REASONABLE STEPS  ARE  NECESSARY  TO  ENSURE
 THAT  ALL  KNOWN  ELECTRONIC  RECORDINGS  OF 911 TELEPHONE CALLS, POLICE
 RADIO TRANSMISSIONS  AND  VIDEO  AND  AUDIO  FOOTAGE  AND  OTHER  POLICE
 RECORDINGS  MADE OR AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE CASE ARE PRESERVED.
 UPON THE RESPONDENT'S TIMELY REQUEST AND DESIGNATION OF A SPECIFIC ELEC-
 TRONIC RECORDING OF A 911 TELEPHONE CALL, THE PRESENTMENT  AGENCY  SHALL
 ALSO  EXPEDITIOUSLY  TAKE  WHATEVER  REASONABLE  STEPS  ARE NECESSARY TO
 ENSURE THAT IT IS PRESERVED.
  (B) IF THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY FAILS TO  DISCLOSE  SUCH  AN  ELECTRONIC
 RECORDING  TO  THE  RESPONDENT  PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (E), (G) OR (K) OF
 SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 331.3 OF THIS PART DUE TO A FAILURE TO COMPLY
 WITH THIS OBLIGATION BY POLICE OFFICERS  OR  OTHER  LAW  ENFORCEMENT  OR
 PROSECUTION  PERSONNEL,  THE  COURT  UPON MOTION OF THE RESPONDENT SHALL
 IMPOSE AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY OR SANCTION PURSUANT TO SECTION  331.12  OF
 THIS PART.
  § 331.9. CONTINUING DUTY TO DISCLOSE. IF EITHER THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY
 OR THE RESPONDENT SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNS OF ADDITIONAL MATERIAL OR INFORMA-
 TION  WHICH  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER A DUTY TO DISCLOSE PURSUANT TO ANY
 PROVISIONS OF THIS PART HAD IT KNOWN OF IT AT THE  TIME  OF  A  PREVIOUS
 DISCOVERY  OBLIGATION  OR DISCOVERY ORDER, IT SHALL EXPEDITIOUSLY NOTIFY
 THE OTHER PARTY AND DISCLOSE THE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL AND INFORMATION  AS
 REQUIRED  FOR  AUTOMATIC  DISCOVERY  UNDER  THIS PART. THIS SECTION ALSO
 REQUIRES EXPEDITIOUS DISCLOSURE BY THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY OF MATERIAL OR
 INFORMATION THAT BECAME RELEVANT TO THE CASE OR  DISCOVERABLE  BASED  ON
 RECIPROCAL  DISCOVERY  RECEIVED FROM THE RESPONDENT PURSUANT TO SUBDIVI-
 SION FOUR OF SECTION 331.3 OF THIS PART.
  § 331.10. WORK PRODUCT. THIS PART DOES NOT AUTHORIZE  DISCOVERY  BY  A
 PARTY  OF THOSE PORTIONS OF RECORDS, REPORTS, CORRESPONDENCE, MEMORANDA,

 RESEARCH,  OPINIONS, THEORIES OR CONCLUSIONS OF THE ADVERSE PARTY OR ITS
 ATTORNEY OR THE ATTORNEY'S AGENTS, OR OF  STATEMENTS  OF  A  RESPONDENT,
 WRITTEN  OR  RECORDED OR SUMMARIZED IN ANY WRITING OR RECORDING, MADE TO
 THE ATTORNEY FOR THE RESPONDENT OR THE ATTORNEY'S AGENTS.
  § 331.11. PROTECTIVE ORDERS. 1. ANY DISCOVERY  SUBJECT  TO  PROTECTIVE
 ORDER.  UPON  A  SHOWING OF GOOD CAUSE BY EITHER PARTY, THE COURT MAY AT
 ANY TIME ORDER THAT DISCOVERY OR INSPECTION OF ANY KIND OF  MATERIAL  OR
 INFORMATION  UNDER  THIS  PART  BE  DENIED,  RESTRICTED,  CONDITIONED OR
 DEFERRED, OR MAKE SUCH OTHER ORDER AS  IS  APPROPRIATE.  THE  COURT  MAY
 IMPOSE  AS A CONDITION ON DISCOVERY TO A RESPONDENT THAT THE MATERIAL OR
 INFORMATION TO BE DISCOVERED  BE  AVAILABLE  ONLY  TO  COUNSEL  FOR  THE
 RESPONDENT;  OR,  ALTERNATIVELY,  THAT  COUNSEL  FOR THE RESPONDENT, AND
 PERSONS EMPLOYED BY THE ATTORNEY OR APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO ASSIST  IN
 THE PREPARATION OF A RESPONDENT'S CASE, MAY NOT DISCLOSE PHYSICAL COPIES
 OF  THE  DISCOVERABLE  DOCUMENTS  TO  A  RESPONDENT  OR  TO ANYONE ELSE,
 PROVIDED THAT THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY AFFORDS THE  RESPONDENT  ACCESS  TO
 INSPECT  REDACTED  COPIES  OF THE DISCOVERABLE DOCUMENTS AT A SUPERVISED
 LOCATION THAT PROVIDES REGULAR AND REASONABLE  HOURS  FOR  SUCH  ACCESS,
 A. 10049  14
 
 SUCH  AS  A  PRESENTMENT  AGENCY'S  OFFICE,  POLICE STATION, FACILITY OF
 DETENTION, OR COURT.  SHOULD THE COURT IMPOSE AS A CONDITION  THAT  SOME
 MATERIAL OR INFORMATION BE AVAILABLE ONLY TO COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENT,
 THE  COURT  SHALL  INFORM  THE  RESPONDENT ON THE RECORD THAT HIS OR HER
 ATTORNEY IS NOT PERMITTED BY LAW TO DISCLOSE SUCH MATERIAL  OR  INFORMA-
 TION TO THE RESPONDENT. THE COURT MAY PERMIT A PARTY SEEKING OR OPPOSING
 A  PROTECTIVE  ORDER  UNDER THIS SECTION, OR ANOTHER AFFECTED PERSON, TO
 SUBMIT PAPERS OR TESTIFY ON THE RECORD EX PARTE OR IN CAMERA.  ANY  SUCH
 PAPERS  AND  A  TRANSCRIPT  OF  SUCH  TESTIMONY  MAY BE SEALED AND SHALL
 CONSTITUTE A PART OF THE RECORD ON APPEAL. THIS SECTION DOES  NOT  ALTER
 THE  ALLOCATION  OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF WITH REGARD TO MATTERS AT ISSUE,
 INCLUDING PRIVILEGE.

 IN  AN INDIVIDUAL CASE, THE COURT MAY ALTER THE TIME PERIODS FOR DISCOV-
 ERY IMPOSED BY THIS PART UPON A SHOWING OF GOOD CAUSE.
  3. PROMPT HEARING. UPON REQUEST FOR  A  PROTECTIVE  ORDER,  THE  COURT
 SHALL  CONDUCT  AN  APPROPRIATE  HEARING  WITHIN  THREE BUSINESS DAYS TO
 DETERMINE WHETHER GOOD CAUSE HAS BEEN SHOWN AND WHEN  PRACTICABLE  SHALL
 RENDER  DECISION EXPEDITIOUSLY. ANY MATERIALS SUBMITTED AND A TRANSCRIPT
 OF THE PROCEEDING MAY BE SEALED AND  SHALL  CONSTITUTE  A  PART  OF  THE
 RECORD ON APPEAL.
  4. SHOWING OF GOOD CAUSE. IN DETERMINING GOOD CAUSE UNDER THIS SECTION
 THE COURT MAY CONSIDER:  CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OR LIMITATIONS; DANGER TO
 THE  INTEGRITY  OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OR THE SAFETY OF A WITNESS; RISK OF
 INTIMIDATION, ECONOMIC  REPRISAL,  BRIBERY,  HARASSMENT  OR  UNJUSTIFIED
 ANNOYANCE  OR  EMBARRASSMENT TO ANY PERSON, AND THE NATURE, SEVERITY AND
 LIKELIHOOD OF THAT RISK; A RISK OF AN ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE LEGITIMATE
 NEEDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, INCLUDING THE PROTECTION OF THE CONFIDENTIALI-
 TY OF INFORMANTS, AND THE NATURE, SEVERITY AND LIKELIHOOD OF THAT  RISK;
 THE  NATURE  AND  CIRCUMSTANCES  OF THE FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS IN THE CASE;
 WHETHER THE RESPONDENT HAS A HISTORY OF WITNESS INTIMIDATION OR  TAMPER-
 ING  AND THE NATURE OF THAT HISTORY; THE NATURE OF THE STATED REASONS IN
 SUPPORT OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER; THE NATURE  OF  THE  WITNESS  IDENTIFYING
 INFORMATION  THAT  IS  SOUGHT  TO  BE  ADDRESSED  BY A PROTECTIVE ORDER,
 INCLUDING THE OPTION OF EMPLOYING ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE CONTACT  INFORMA-
 TION;  DANGER TO ANY PERSON STEMMING FROM FACTORS SUCH AS A RESPONDENT'S
 SUBSTANTIATED AFFILIATION WITH  A  CRIMINAL  ENTERPRISE  AS  DEFINED  IN
 SUBDIVISION  THREE OF SECTION 460.10 OF THE PENAL LAW; AND OTHER SIMILAR
 FACTORS FOUND TO OUTWEIGH THE USEFULNESS OF THE DISCOVERY.
  5. SUCCESSOR COUNSEL. IN CASES IN WHICH THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT  RELATION-
 SHIP IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO TRIAL FOR ANY REASON, ANY MATERIAL OR INFOR-
 MATION  DISCLOSED  SUBJECT  TO  A CONDITION THAT IT BE AVAILABLE ONLY TO
 COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENT, OR LIMITED IN  DISSEMINATION  BY  PROTECTIVE
 ORDER  OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE PROVIDED ONLY TO SUCCESSOR COUNSEL FOR THE
 RESPONDENT UNDER THE SAME CONDITION OR CONDITIONS OR BE RETURNED TO  THE
 PRESENTMENT  AGENCY,  UNLESS  THE  COURT  RULES OTHERWISE FOR GOOD CAUSE
 SHOWN OR THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY GIVES WRITTEN CONSENT. ANY WORK  PRODUCT
 DERIVED  FROM  SUCH MATERIAL OR INFORMATION SHALL NOT BE PROVIDED TO THE
 RESPONDENT, UNLESS THE COURT RULES OTHERWISE OR THE  PRESENTMENT  AGENCY
 GIVES  WRITTEN  CONSENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, ANY SUCH WORK PRODUCT MAY BE
 PROVIDED TO THE SUCCESSOR COUNSEL.
  6. COMPLIANCE WITH PROTECTIVE ORDER. ANY PROTECTIVE ORDER ISSUED UNDER
 THIS PART IS A MANDATE OF THE COURT FOR PURPOSES OF THE OFFENSE OF CRIM-
 INAL CONTEMPT IN SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION 215.50 OF THE PENAL LAW.
  § 331.12. REMEDIES OR SANCTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. 1. NEED FOR REMEDY
 OR SANCTION. (A) WHEN MATERIAL OR INFORMATION IS DISCOVERABLE UNDER THIS
 A. 10049  15

 PART BUT IS DISCLOSED BELATEDLY, THE COURT SHALL IMPOSE  AN  APPROPRIATE
 REMEDY OR SANCTION IF THE PARTY ENTITLED TO DISCLOSURE SHOWS THAT IT WAS
 PREJUDICED.  REGARDLESS  OF A SHOWING OF PREJUDICE THE PARTY ENTITLED TO
 DISCLOSURE  SHALL BE GIVEN REASONABLE TIME TO PREPARE AND RESPOND TO THE
 NEW MATERIAL.
  (B) WHEN MATERIAL OR INFORMATION IS DISCOVERABLE UNDER THIS  PART  BUT
 CANNOT  BE  DISCLOSED  BECAUSE  IT HAS BEEN LOST OR DESTROYED, THE COURT
 SHALL IMPOSE AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY OR SANCTION IF THE PARTY ENTITLED  TO
 DISCLOSURE  SHOWS THAT THE LOST OR DESTROYED MATERIAL MAY HAVE CONTAINED
 SOME INFORMATION RELEVANT TO A CONTESTED ISSUE. THE  APPROPRIATE  REMEDY
 OR  SANCTION  IS  THAT  WHICH  IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE POTENTIAL WAYS IN
 WHICH THE LOST OR DESTROYED MATERIAL REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN  HELPFUL
 TO THE PARTY ENTITLED TO DISCLOSURE.
  2.  AVAILABLE  REMEDIES  OR  SANCTIONS. FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY
 DISCOVERY ORDER IMPOSED OR ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS PART, THE  COURT  MAY
 MAKE  A  FURTHER  ORDER FOR DISCOVERY, GRANT A CONTINUANCE, ORDER THAT A
 HEARING BE REOPENED, ORDER THAT A WITNESS BE CALLED OR RECALLED, DRAW AN
 ADVERSE INFERENCE REGARDING THE NON-COMPLIANCE,  PRECLUDE  OR  STRIKE  A
 WITNESS'S  TESTIMONY  OR  A  PORTION  OF A WITNESS'S TESTIMONY, ADMIT OR
 EXCLUDE EVIDENCE, ORDER A MISTRIAL, ORDER THE DISMISSAL OF ALL  OR  SOME
 OF  THE  CHARGES,  OR  MAKE  SUCH OTHER ORDER AS IT DEEMS JUST UNDER THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES; EXCEPT THAT ANY SANCTION  AGAINST  THE  RESPONDENT  SHALL
 COMPORT WITH THE RESPONDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE,
 AND  PRECLUDING  A  WITNESS  FROM TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 SHALL BE PERMISSIBLE ONLY UPON A FINDING THAT THE  RESPONDENT'S  FAILURE

 VATED BY A DESIRE TO OBTAIN A TACTICAL ADVANTAGE.
  3. CONSEQUENCES OF NON-DISCLOSURE OF STATEMENT OF  WITNESS  TESTIFYING
 FOR  THE  PRESENTMENT  AGENCY.  THE FAILURE OF THE PRESENTMENT AGENCY TO
 DISCLOSE ANY WRITTEN OR RECORDED STATEMENT MADE BY A WITNESS  TESTIFYING
 ON  THE  AGENCY'S  BEHALF,  WHICH  RELATES  TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE
 WITNESS'S TESTIMONY, SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE GROUNDS FOR ANY COURT TO ORDER
 A NEW PRE-TRIAL HEARING OR SET ASIDE AN ADJUDICATION, OR REVERSE, MODIFY
 OR VACATE AN ADJUDICATION, IN THE ABSENCE OF A SHOWING BY THE RESPONDENT
 THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY  THAT  THE  NON-DISCLOSURE  MATE-
 RIALLY  CONTRIBUTED  TO  THE  RESULT  OF  THE TRIAL OR OTHER PROCEEDING;
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL  AFFECT  OR  LIMIT
 ANY  RIGHT  THE RESPONDENT MAY HAVE TO A REOPENED PRE-TRIAL HEARING WHEN
 SUCH STATEMENTS WERE DISCLOSED BEFORE THE CLOSE OF EVIDENCE AT THE FACT-
 FINDING HEARING.
  § 331.13. ADMISSIBILITY OF DISCOVERY. THE FACT THAT A PARTY HAS  INDI-
 CATED  DURING  THE  DISCOVERY  PROCESS  AN  INTENTION TO OFFER SPECIFIED
 EVIDENCE OR TO CALL A SPECIFIED WITNESS IS NOT ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE OR
 GROUNDS FOR ADVERSE COMMENT AT A PRE-TRIAL OR FACT-FINDING HEARING.

 vision [two] ONE of section [331.2 or paragraph (a) of  subdivision  one
 of  section  331.4] 331.3 of the family court act the presentment agency

 nity to be heard.
  § 4. Subdivision 5 of section 330.1 of the family court act, as  added

  5.  Court  ordered bill of particulars. Where a presentment agency has
 timely served a written refusal pursuant to  subdivision  four  of  this
 A. 10049  16
 
 section  and upon motion, made in writing, of a respondent, who has made
 a request for a bill of particulars  and  whose  request  has  not  been
 complied  with  in  whole  or  in  part, the court must, to the extent a
 protective  order  is  not  warranted,  order  the presentment agency to
 comply with the request if it is satisfied that  the  items  of  factual
 information requested are authorized to be included in a bill of partic-
 ulars,  and  that such information is necessary to enable the respondent
 adequately to prepare or conduct his defense and,  if  the  request  was
 untimely,  a  finding  of  good cause for the delay. Where a presentment
 agency has not timely served a written refusal pursuant  to  subdivision
 four  of  this  section  the court must, unless it is satisfied that the
 presentment agency has shown good cause why such an order should not  be
 issued,  issue  an  order  requiring the presentment agency to comply or
 providing for any other order authorized by subdivision one  of  section
 [331.6] 331.12 OF THIS PART.
  § 5. This act shall take effect January 1, 2025.
