  COMMEMORATING  the  60th Anniversary of the Oneida
  County Dairy Promotion
 
  WHEREAS, The agricultural industry is part of  the  foundation  upon
which  our  distinct  American heritage is built; New York State and the
entire Nation are dependent on our agricultural industry for  a  variety
of food products; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
60th Anniversary of the Oneida County Dairy Promotion, to be  celebrated
at  the organization's annual Dairy Promotion Banquet on May 11, 2024 at
Delta Lake Inn in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Oneida County crowned its first  Dairy  Princess  in  1964;
since  its  inception, the program has continued to evolve with the help
of many dedicated volunteers and has now allowed  the  participation  of
boys  and  girls,  with the title now being Dairy Ambassador since 2022;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Designed to help bring awareness to the dairy  industry  to
promote  sales  and  consumption,  the  Oneida  County Dairy Promotion's
mission is to foster better relations between  urban  and  rural  people
through one-on-one contact at the local level; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Dairy Ambassador and team were chosen to represent the
county's dairy  industry  and  dairy  farmers  in  local  promotion  and
advocacy  to  consumers;  they give school presentations, participate in
special events like supermarket  promotions,  ag-business  open  houses,
parades  and  the  county  fair,  give  speeches  to  agricultural  and
non-agricultural groups, record PSA's,  do  media  interviews,  and  may
write  articles  for  farm  press, consumers press, and website/Facebook
messages; and
 
  WHEREAS, Given crowns and sashes to  signify  the  distinction,  the
Dairy  Ambassador's  main  talking  points are around milk's nutritional
value, on-farm practices/animal care and well-being,  and  environmental
stewardship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1977,  Oneida County started giving several awards for
outstanding service to the dairy industry:  the Silver Cow  Award,  the
Dairy  Farmer  of the Year Award, the Agribusiness of the Year Award, in
1993, a Media Award and in 1995, a Special Service  Award  was  created,
lastly,  in 1999, a Pioneer Award was created and presented to Ida Reed;
Ida Reed was a trailblazer in the Oneida County Dairy Promotion; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Oneida  County  Dairy  Promotion  is  in
direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of its staff, and many volunteers
whose  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an
impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of the market and  the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The dairy industry and promotion helps to develop local and
regional food systems that support family farms, revitalize communities,
provide  opportunities  for  farmers  and consumers to interact, promote
environmental sustainability, and support our economy in New York State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Oneida County  Dairy  Promotion;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Oneida County Dairy Promotion.
