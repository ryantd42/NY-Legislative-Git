 may bring any legal action necessary, including  administrative  action,
 to  collect  such claim and as part of such legal action, in addition to
 any other remedies and penalties otherwise available under this article,
 the commissioner shall assess against the employer the  full  amount  of
 any  such  underpayment, and an additional amount as liquidated damages,
 unless the employer proves a good faith basis  for  believing  that  its
 underpayment of wages was in compliance with the law, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
