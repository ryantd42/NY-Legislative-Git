  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  POLICE  FIRE
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  19,938  5,028
 S. 9634  3
 
  - Average Age:  32.7  33.5
  - Average Service:  6.1  5.5
  - Average Salary:  107,200  112,400
 
  IMPACT  ON  ELIGIBILITY:  Currently,  active  Tier  3  POLICE and FIRE
 enhanced plan members with at least five years of credited  service  are
 only eligible for an ODR benefit if they are approved for primary Social
 Security disability benefits (SSDI).
  Under  the  proposed legislation, Tier 3 POLICE and FIRE enhanced plan
 members with at least five years of credited service would  be  eligible
 for an ODR benefit, irrespective of SSDI eligibility.
  The  formula  for  calculating Enhanced Plan ODR benefits would remain
 unchanged.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  *  For  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it has been assumed that 100% of
 members exiting for ODR under current ODR rates would be ineligible  for
 SSDI.
  *  It is assumed that the Medical Board will be responsible for deter-
 mining the eligibility for ODR benefits in place of  the  SSDI  require-
 ment.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
