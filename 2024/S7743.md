 services or the commissioner's designee, in his or her  discretion,  may
 allow the child day care center operator or provider to attempt to prove
 by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  any  matter not included in the
 answer. Where the child day care  provider  satisfactorily  demonstrates
 that  it  has  rectified  the CRITICAL violations in accordance with the
 requirements of paragraph (c) of this subdivision, no penalty  shall  be
 imposed except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subdivision.
