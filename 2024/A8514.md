 AN ACT to amend the civil service  law,  in  relation  to  crediting  of
  probationary service upon permanent appointment
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 63 of the civil  service  law,  as
 amended  by a chapter of the laws of 2023 amending the civil service law
 relating to crediting of probationary service, as proposed  in  legisla-
 tive bills numbers S. 5494 and A. 7155, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  Every  original appointment to a position in the competitive class
 and every interdepartmental promotion from a position in one  department
 or  agency  to a position in another department or agency shall be for a
 probationary  term;  provided,  however,  that  upon  interdepartmental
 promotion  the appointing officer may waive the requirement of satisfac-
 tory completion of  the  probationary  term.  The  state  civil  service
 commission and municipal civil service commissions may provide, by rule,
 for  probationary  service upon intradepartmental promotion to positions
 in the competitive class  and  upon  appointment  to  positions  in  the
 exempt, non-competitive or labor classes.
  When  probationary  service  is  required upon promotion, the position
 formerly held by the person promoted shall be held open and shall not be
 filled, except on a temporary basis, pending completion  of  his  proba-
 tionary term.
  Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any other law or rule to the contra-
 ry, when a permanent appointment or  promotion  to  a  position  in  the
 competitive class is conditioned upon the completion of a term of train-
 ing  service  or  of  a period of service in a designated trainee title,
 such service and the probationary term  for  such  competitive  position
 shall run concurrently.
  Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any law or rule to the contrary, any
 person appointed provisionally in accordance with section sixty-five  of
 this  title who receives a permanent appointment to the same title IMME-
 DIATELY FOLLOWING THE PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENT shall have all time  spent

 as  a  provisional appointment credited to any probationary term that is
 required upon permanent appointment to a position.
  §  2.  This  act  shall  take  effect on the same date and in the same
 manner as a chapter of the laws of 2023 amending the civil  service  law
 relating  to  crediting of probationary service, as proposed in legisla-
 tive bills numbers S. 5494 and A. 7155, takes effect.
