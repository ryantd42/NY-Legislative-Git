 vance to the recommendation or court disposition, which shall include an
 analysis of the victim's version of the offense, the extent of PHYSICAL,
 EMOTIONAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL injury or economic loss and the  actual  out-

 defined in article one hundred thirty of such law, the district attorney
 shall,  within  sixty  days of the final disposition of the case, inform
 the victim by letter of such final disposition. If such  final  disposi-
 tion  results  in  the commitment of the defendant to the custody of the
 department of corrections and community supervision for an indeterminate
 OR COMBINED sentence, the notice provided to the crime victim shall also
 inform the victim of his or her right to submit [a written,]  AN  audio-

 The  right  of  the  victim under this subdivision to submit a [written]
 victim impact statement IN ANY FORMAT  or  to  meet  personally  with  a
 member  of  the state board of parole applies to each personal interview
 between a member or members of the board and the  incarcerated  individ-
 ual.
