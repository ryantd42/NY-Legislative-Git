 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Bedford  Hills  Fire  District  to
  file  an application for exemption from school taxes and real property
  taxes
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor  of  the town of Bedford, county of Westchester, is hereby
 authorized to accept from the Bedford Hills Fire District,  an  applica-
 tion for exemption from school taxes and real property taxes pursuant to
 section  464  of the real property tax law with respect to the 2022-2023
 assessment roll, for the parcels owned by such organization,  with  such
 parcels being located at 352 Bedford Road, in the town of Bedford, coun-
 ty  of  Westchester,  otherwise  known  as  Westchester  county tax map,
 section 60.14, block 5, lot 83.
  If accepted, the application shall be  reviewed  as  if  it  had  been
 received on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
 If  satisfied that such organization would otherwise be entitled to such
 exemption if such organization had filed an application for exemption by
 the appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon approval by  the
 town  of  Bedford governing board, may grant exemption from all taxation
 and make appropriate corrections to the subject roll. If such  exemption
 is  granted and such organization therefore shall have paid any tax with
 respect to the subject  roll,  the  applicable  governing  body  or  tax
 department  may,  in  its sole discretion, provide for the refund of the
 taxes paid, along with any fines  or  penalties  paid,  and  cancel  any
 taxes, fines, penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
