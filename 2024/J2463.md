  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 22, 2024, as International  Day  for  Biological
  Diversity in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
environmental  issues  that  affect  the  lives  of citizens of New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is a measure of  the
variation  of genetics and species in a particular habitat or ecosystem;
it commonly refers to the overall variety  of  life  in  an  area;  this
variety  of life includes animals, plants, fungi and even microorganisms
that make up  our  natural  world;  each  of  these  works  together  in
ecosystems to maintain balance and to support life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  the  planet  is  facing  an  unprecedented
biodiversity crisis, largely driven by human activity; recent scientific
studies  have  confirmed  human-driven  activities  are  significantly
damaging  the  Earth's ecosystems by: altering 75 percent of the area of
terrestrial environments and 66 percent of marine environments; directly
exploiting wildlife and  plant  species;  accelerating  climate  change,
directly  harming  nature and exacerbating other threats; polluting air,
land, and water; and introducing invasive species; and
 
  WHEREAS, These studies have shown  that  human-driven  threats  have
harmed  biodiversity  by:  threatening approximately one million species
with extinction now and in the coming decades, including over 40 percent
of amphibians; 33 percent of corals, sharks, shark relatives, and marine
mammals; over 60 percent of cycads and over 30 percent of conifer trees;
and about 10 percent of over 5 million insect species; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, human-driven threats have harmed  biodiversity
by causing population sizes of wild species to decline by: an average of
68  percent for mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles; nearly 3
billion birds in North America since 1970; about  50  percent  for  live
corals; and an average of over 20 percent overall; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Human  activity  is  accelerating the decline of important
economic  and  cultural  services,  with:  the  productivity  of  nearly
one-fourth  of  the land surface reduced; over one-third of land surface
and 75 percent of freshwater resources  devoted  to  crop  or  livestock
production;  about  half a trillion dollars of global crops at risk from
pollinator loss; one-third of marine fisheries  overfished,  60  percent
fished  at  capacity,  and  just 7 percent fished below capacity; and 25
percent of greenhouse gas emissions caused by land clearing, crops,  and
fertilization; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  decline  of  biodiversity  disproportionately impacts
indigenous and other communities  that  rely  on  nature  for  essential
services, including Native Americans and Alaska Natives who offer unique
perspectives and traditional ecological knowledge critical to preserving
biodiversity; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  decline  of  biodiversity and ecosystem
services observed worldwide is occurring in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York  possesses  an  abundance  and  great
diversity  of  species  of  fish,  wildlife,  and  plants  that  are  of
significant  value  for  many  intrinsic,  aesthetic,  ecological,
educational,  cultural,  recreational, economic, and scientific reasons;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The decline of biodiversity also presents a  direct  threat
to  the  security,  health,  and well-being of the people of New York by
causing economic harm through the loss of  valuable  ecosystem  services
such  as:  zoonotic  disease buffering, pollination, water filtration,
soil replenishment, the provision of game species,  medicinal  products,
recreational  opportunities, and others; additionally, biodiversity loss
drives pandemic risk; and
 
  WHEREAS, Federal agencies are tasked with protecting and  conserving
biodiversity  in  the  United  States and worldwide through a variety of
legal and policy channels; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  is  no  coordinating  policy  to  maximize  the
effectiveness  of  the  Federal  Government's  conservation  efforts and
collaboration  with  the  States,  local  governments,  Tribes,  private
landowners, and other nongovernmental stakeholders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Scientific research highlights essential pathways forward,
including: establishing the  effective  conservation,  restoration,  and
durable  protection  of an ecologically representative area of the State
of New York and its lands, freshwaters, and oceans by  2030  by  working
collaboratively  with  governments,  land  owners,  fishers,  indigenous
peoples,  communities,  and  others;  restoring  or  rewilding  species,
degraded  habitats, and ensuring integrity and connectivity of protected
areas; retaining  and  protecting  highly  intact  ecosystems;  reducing
pesticide  use  to  levels  no  higher  than  needed  for  sustainable,
ecologically, and safe food production; and addressing the threats posed
by invasive species; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of  New  York  should  play  a  leading  role  in
addressing  the  biodiversity  crisis, and more must be done to increase
activity at the local, state, and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  22,  2024,  as
International Day for Biological Diversity in the State of New York; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
