  Section  1.  Subparagraph  (ii)  of  paragraph  k  of subdivision 4 of

 allowable surplus percentage of the approved provider's total  allowable

 and preschool students for the school year from which the funds  are  to
 be  retained,  as  defined  in  subparagraph  (iii)  of  this paragraph;

 tuition  rates  AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT ANY INTEREST EARNED OR INVEST-
 MENTS REALIZED ON SUCH FUNDS SHALL SUPPLEMENT AND NOT SUPPLANT ANY FUNDS
 PROVIDED BY THE TUITION METHODOLOGY ONCE RETAINED. For purposes of  this
 subparagraph,  "approved  providers"  shall  mean private residential or

 programs approved pursuant to section forty-four  hundred  ten  of  this
 article that are subject to tuition rate reconciliation.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2021.
