  WHEREAS,  Matthew  Hoose was born on August 26, 1968 in Canandaigua,

hunting  with his grandfather, working at the family bakery, and playing

York State Association of County Clerks; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to his civic duties, Matthew  Hoose  maintained
his  dedication  to  being  a  supportive  and encouraging figure in his

to building sets  for  school  musicals  to  being  his  family's  eager
chauffeur through all of their adventures; and
 
  WHEREAS, In his free time, Matthew Hoose shared his love for cooking
by  sneaking  tastes  of his homemade pasta sauce and hosting the family
barbecue while he grilled  or  smoked  meat  that  even  his  vegetarian
daughter could be proud of; he also enjoyed the outdoors, whether on the
golf  course  with  his  friends  and  family,  on  the lake fishing and
boating, or appreciating the Maine coastline with  his  cherished  wife,
Amy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Matthew  Hoose  was  a  passionate  man,  happiest  when
surrounded by those he loved; he will remain in the hearts of those  who
continue to love and remember him; and

countless lives he touched; and

compassion,  Matthew Hoose leaves behind a legacy which will long endure
the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory  to  all  who
were  privileged to have known and loved such an amazing man; he will be
deeply missed and truly merits the grateful tribute of this  Legislative

deepest condolences to his family; and be it further
