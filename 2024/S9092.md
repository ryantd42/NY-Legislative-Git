 teacher and leader  education,  as  defined  by  the  commissioner.  The
 department  shall  issue  rigorous  standards for courses, programs, and

 PRACTICES DURING EACH FIVE-YEAR REGISTRATION PERIOD SHALL BE  DETERMINED
 BY THE DEPARTMENT.
  (II)  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL ENSURE, IN CONSULTATION WITH PROVIDERS OF
 CONTINUING TEACHER AND LEADER  EDUCATION,  THAT  COURSES,  PROGRAMS  AND

 MADE SUFFICIENTLY AVAILABLE FOR AN APPLICANT FOR REGISTRATION TO  COMPLY
 WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
  C.  Nothing  in  this  section shall limit the ability of local school
 districts to agree pursuant to collective bargaining to additional hours

 teacher and leader education requirements shall not be  issued  a  five-
 year  registration  certificate by the department and shall not practice
 unless and until a registration or conditional registration  certificate
 is issued as provided in subdivision three of this section. For purposes
 of  this  subdivision, "continuing teacher and leader education require-
 ments" shall mean activities designed to improve the teacher or leader's
 pedagogical and/or leadership  skills,  targeted  at  improving  student
 performance,  including but not limited to formal continuing teacher and
 leader education activities. Such activities shall promote  the  profes-
 sionalization  of  teaching and be closely aligned to district goals for
 student performance which meet the standards prescribed  by  regulations
 of the commissioner. To fulfill the continuing teacher and leader educa-
 tion  requirement,  programs must be taken from sponsors approved by the
 department, which shall include but not be limited to school  districts,
 pursuant to the regulations of the commissioner.
