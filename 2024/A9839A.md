 AN ACT in relation to authorizing  the  county  of  Nassau  assessor  to
  accept  an  application  for  a  real  property tax exemption from St.
  Gregorios Malankara Orthodox Church Queens, Inc.

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 St.  Gregorios Malankara Orthodox Church Queens, Inc. an application for
 exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section 430 of  the  real
 property  tax law with respect to the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 assessment
 rolls for a portion of the 2021-2022 and all  of  the  2022-2023  school
 taxes  and  for  a portion of the 2022 and all of the 2023 general taxes
 for the parcel owned by such organization located  at  915  North  First
 Street,  town  of  North Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as
 Nassau county tax map section 8, block 011, lot 400,  lot  group  40-41,
 43-44,  60-65, 142 and 242 and for the parcel owned by such organization
 located at 911 North First Street, town of North  Hempstead,  county  of
 Nassau  otherwise  known  as  tax  map section 8, block 11, lot 430, lot
 group 43-44-242. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it
 had been received on or before the taxable status date  established  for
 such assessment rolls.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  rolls,  the applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
