 department  of  corrections  and  community supervision, it shall be the
 duty of the commissioner to determine, and from time to time review, the
 prices of all commodities and to  approve  the  price  of  all  services
 provided  by  preferred  sources as specified in this section offered to
 state agencies, political subdivisions or  public  benefit  corporations
 having  their own purchasing office. The commissioner's price review and
 approval shall not be required for any purchases below one hundred thou-
 sand dollars.
  b. In determining and revising  the  prices  of  such  commodities  or
 services, consideration shall be given to the reasonable costs of labor,
 materials  and  overhead  necessarily incurred by such preferred sources
 under efficient methods  of  procurement,  production,  performance  and
 administration;  however, the prices of such products and services shall
 be as close to prevailing market price as practicable, but in  no  event
 greater  than fifteen percent above the prevailing market prices for the
 same or equivalent commodities or services.
  c. Such qualified charitable non-profit-making agencies for the  blind
 and other disabled PERSONS AND/OR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSONS may make

 bility for any payment due the vendor.

 tional  industries  program  administered  by  the  commissioner  of
 corrections  and  community supervision, subject to such rules as may be
 established from time to time pursuant to the correction  law;  provided
 that  the qualified charitable non-profit-making agency for the blind or
 other disabled PERSONS AND/OR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSONS shall accept
 sole responsibility for any payment due the  department  of  corrections
 and community supervision.
  e.  The  commissioner  of  the  office of children and family services
 shall appoint the New York state commission  for  the  blind,  or  other
 non-profit-making agency, other than the agency representing [the] other
 disabled PERSONS AND/OR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSONS, to facilitate the
 distribution  of  orders  among  qualified  non-profit-making charitable
 agencies for the  blind.  The  state  commissioner  of  education  shall
 appoint  a  non-profit-making agency, other than the agency representing

 non-profit-making  charitable  agencies for [the] other disabled PERSONS
 AND/OR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSONS and  the  veterans'  entities.  The
 state commissioner of mental health shall facilitate the distribution of
 orders  among qualified special employment programs operated or approved
 by the office of mental health serving mentally ill persons.

 audits and examinations to be made of all records, books and data of any
 agency  for  the  blind  or [the] other disabled PERSONS AND/OR FORMERLY
 INCARCERATED PERSONS, any special employment program  for  mentally  ill
 persons  or  any veterans' entity qualified under this section to deter-
 mine the costs of manufacture or  the  rendering  of  services  and  the
