  HONORING  Deputy  Chief Robert Dedominick upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  50  years of dedicated service to the Watkins
  Glen Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  Firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Deputy Chief
Robert Dedominick upon the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to the Watkins Glen Fire
Department  to  be  celebrated  at  this  year's  Installation Dinner on
Saturday, April 15, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Robert Dedominick, affectionately known  as  Robby,  joined
the  Watkins  Glen  Fire  Department on April 7, 1973; throughout his 50
years of service,  he  held  several  positions  within  the  Department
including:  firefighter, Chief and Deputy Chief of the department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Always  working  to  better  the  department  and  keep it
growing, Deputy Chief Robert  Dedominick  is  an  interior  firefighter,
helping  with  department  training,  as  well  as anything else that is
needed; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, Robert Dedominick works for the New York State
Office of Fire Prevention and Control at the New York State Frederick L.
Warder Academy of  Fire  Science  in  Montour  Falls,  New  York,  as  a
firefighting instructor; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Robert Dedominick is one such firefighter; throughout his  five  decades
of  devoted  service,  this  volunteer  heroically  performed, above and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
fire protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Deputy  Chief  Robert  Dedominick  upon  the  occasion  of  his
 
designation for special recognition after 50 years of dedicated  service
to the Watkins Glen Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Deputy Chief Robert Dedominick.
