  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary of BAPS Shri
  Swaminarayan Mandir in Flushing, New York, on August
  4, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social, and
educational benefits they confer, play a vital role in  the  development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the tradition of this State and this Nation to pay
tribute to those institutions and individuals who  have  contributed  to
the ethical and spiritual values of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body takes pleasure in commemorating the
50th Anniversary of BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Flushing, New York,
on Sunday, August 4, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS)
is  a  worldwide  Hindu  denomination  dedicated  to  fostering  faith,
inspiring service, and promoting better living; and
 
  WHEREAS, His Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj (1921-2016), established
the first BAPS Hindu mandir in the United States of America on August 4,
1974, in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A Mandir is a sacred Hindu place of worship; it represents
the earthly home of God, where one can  visit  to  quiet  the  mind  and
experience  spirituality;  visitors and devotees come to mandir to offer
prayers before the murtis, or  sacred  images,  as  well  as  to  attend
cultural classes and religious services known as sabhas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  BAPS Swaminarayan mandirs serve to both foster and further
personal and collective  worship;  Pramukh  Swami  Maharaj,  the  former
spiritual  leader  and  guru  of  BAPS,  supported  the establishment of
mandirs as a means to cultivate peace  within  communities  and  connect
individuals  to  Bhagwan;  mandirs  ensure that Hinduism's teachings are
shared with future generations for many years to come; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the last 50 years, BAPS has grown to over 100  mandirs
across  the United States; these mandirs offer a welcoming and spiritual
space for  thousands  of  families,  as  well  as  worship,  fellowship,
communal  meals, education, and activities for young and old, creating a
true home for the faithful; and
 
  WHEREAS, BAPS mandirs offer youth activities that encourage and mold
young people to live lives of integrity and character that  reflect  our
highest ideals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  this  vital  place  of  worship  brings  His
Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj's words- "In the joy of others  lies  our
own"-  to  life  through support for those in need, through a variety of
community efforts such as health fairs, food drives, or disaster  relief
work; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  in  the  example  of  His Holiness Mahant Swami
Maharaj, the volunteers of BAPS have, time and again, answered the  call
to serve, humbly, selflessly, and inspirationally; and
 
  WHEREAS,  BAPS  mandirs have a storied history of helping immigrants
to the United States retain their connection to their faith while  fully
embracing  and  joining in American civic life, truly adding to the rich
tapestry of diversity that makes America and Flushing, Queens, New  York
a beautiful place to call home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the BAPS mandir in Flushing, Queens, New York is a
strong example of how houses of worship contribute to the well-being  of
their congregants and local communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the custom of this Legislative Body to take note of
enduring religious institutions and to bring such  institutions  to  the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of BAPS  Shri  Swaminarayan  Mandir  in
Flushing, New York, fully confident that this commemoration reflects the
belief  in  those  values which enhance the dignity and purpose of life;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Flushing, New York.
