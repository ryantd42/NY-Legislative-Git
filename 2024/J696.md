  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2023 as Aphasia Awareness Month in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and fully  in  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  June  2023  as  Aphasia
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Aphasia Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Aphasia  is  an  impairment  of  language  affecting  the
production  or comprehension of speech and the ability to read or write;
this condition occurs when a part of a person's brain that  is  required
for  communication  abilities  is  damaged  due to a stroke, other brain
injury, or neurological condition; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals who are affected by aphasia often  struggle  to
come  up  with  words, say what they mean, read quickly or to their full
ability, know how to spell words that they used to  be  able  to  write,
understand conversations, and follow a conversation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  commonly  in  aphasia,  however, multiple aspects of
communication are impaired, while some channels remain accessible for  a
limited  exchange  of  information; it is the job of the professional to
determine the amount of function available in each of the  channels  for
the  comprehension  of  language,  and  to  assess  the possibility that
treatment might enhance the use of the channels that are available; and
 
  WHEREAS, About 40 percent of people who have had a stroke experience
aphasia; the communication problems associated with  the  condition  may
make  it  difficult  for  patients  to  understand  what the doctors are
telling them; this can lead to not asking appropriate questions  to  the
professional  and  to  signing forms without proper understanding of the
situation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Matthew Weingartner is a 35 year old from Long Island,  New
York,  who  serves  as  an  inspiration to others to remain positive and
strong in their healing journey; he had a stroke on April 18, 2018,  and
shares  his  story  to  raise awareness about aphasia and to make others
feel supported and seen; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the United States, there is  an  estimated  two  million
people  who  are  living  with  aphasia;  this  affects  not  only those
individuals, but  also  their  spouses,  family  members,  friends,  and
community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  over  a  century of studying aphasia, it has become
evident that specific components of language may  be  more  dramatically
damaged in some individuals; we have also learned to recognize different
 
types  or  patterns  of  aphasia which correspond to the location of the
brain injury in individual cases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June 2023 as Aphasia
Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction  with  National
Aphasia Awareness Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and Matthew Weingartner.
