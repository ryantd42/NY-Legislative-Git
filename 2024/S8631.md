  Section  1.  Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "New York false AI representations act (New York FAIR Act)".
  § 2.  The election law is amended by adding a new  section  16-119  to
 read as follows:
  §  16-119.  MATERIALLY  DECEPTIVE  MEDIA;  PROCEEDINGS.  1.  FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM "MATERIALLY  DECEPTIVE  MEDIA"  MEANS
 ANY  IMAGE,  AUDIO  OR  VIDEO  OF  A  CANDIDATE'S APPEARANCE, SPEECH, OR
 CONDUCT THAT HAS  BEEN  INTENTIONALLY  MANIPULATED,  USED  FOR  CAMPAIGN
 PURPOSES IN A MANNER WHICH:
  (A)  FALSELY  DEPICTS  AN  INDIVIDUAL ENGAGING IN SPEECH OR CONDUCT IN
 WHICH THE DEPICTED INDIVIDUAL DID NOT IN FACT ENGAGE;
  (B) A REASONABLE VIEWER OR LISTENER WOULD INCORRECTLY BELIEVE THAT THE
 DEPICTED INDIVIDUAL ENGAGED IN THE SPEECH OR CONDUCT DEPICTED; AND
  (C) IS CREATED BY OR WITH A MACHINE-BASED SYSTEM THAT, FOR EXPLICIT OR
 IMPLICIT OBJECTIVES, INFERS, FROM THE INPUT IT RECEIVES, HOW TO GENERATE
 OUTPUTS SUCH AS PREDICTIONS, CONTENT, RECOMMENDATIONS, OR DECISIONS THAT
 CAN INFLUENCE PHYSICAL OR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS.
  2. ANY CANDIDATE DEPICTED IN MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE MEDIA SHALL  HAVE  A
 CAUSE  OF  ACTION  AGAINST SUCH INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY WHO DISSEMINATED OR
 PUBLISHED SUCH MEDIA WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE PERSON DEPICTED AND  WHO
 KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE.
  3.  IN  ANY  ACTION  COMMENCED  PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  ONE OF THIS
 SECTION, THE FINDER OF FACT, IN ITS  DISCRETION,  MAY  AWARD  INJUNCTIVE
 RELIEF,  PUNITIVE  DAMAGES,  COMPENSATORY  DAMAGES  AND REASONABLE COURT

  5. IN ANY ACTION COMMENCED UNDER THIS SECTION, THE PLAINTIFF BEARS THE
 BURDEN  OF  ESTABLISHING  THE USE OF MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE MEDIA BY CLEAR

 IRREPARABLE  HARM  OF  HOLDING  ELECTIONS  UNDER  DECEPTIVE  CONDITIONS,
 ACTIONS  BROUGHT  PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO EXPEDITED
 PRETRIAL AND TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AND RECEIVE AN AUTOMATIC CALENDAR PREFER-
 ENCE. IN ANY ACTION ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF  THIS  SECTION  IN  WHICH  A
 PLAINTIFF  PARTY  SEEKS  PRELIMINARY  RELIEF WITH RESPECT TO AN UPCOMING
 ELECTION, THE COURT SHALL GRANT RELIEF IF IT DETERMINES THAT:
  (A) PLAINTIFFS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS; AND
  (B) IT IS POSSIBLE TO  IMPLEMENT  AN  APPROPRIATE  REMEDY  THAT  WOULD
 RESOLVE THE ALLEGED VIOLATION IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION.
