  § 305-A.  COMPLAINTS CONCERNING THE MORAL CHARACTER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO
 HOLD OR WHO ARE APPLICANTS FOR NEW YORK STATE TEACHING CERTIFICATES.  1.
 THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL MAINTAIN AN INTERNAL REGISTRY OF CERTAIN ACTIVE
 INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST CERTIFIED INDIVIDUALS PURSUANT  TO  PART  EIGHTY-
 THREE  OF TITLE EIGHT OF THE NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE
 REGISTRY SHALL EXCLUSIVELY INCLUDE ACTIVE INVESTIGATIONS FOR  WHICH  THE
 COMPLAINT AGAINST A CERTIFIED INDIVIDUAL IS A BOUNDARY VIOLATION BETWEEN
 THE  CERTIFICATE  HOLDER  AND  A STUDENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A
 SEX-RELATED OFFENSE OR A COMPLAINT THAT  IS  SEXUAL  IN  NATURE.  SUCH
 REGISTRY  SHALL  INCLUDE  INFORMATION  ABOUT SUCH CERTIFIED INDIVIDUALS,
 INCLUDING THEIR FULL NAME, POSITION OR MOST RECENT POSITION HELD,  PLACE
 OF  EMPLOYMENT OR PLACE OF MOST RECENT EMPLOYMENT, THE DATE ON WHICH THE
 DEPARTMENT RECEIVED THE PART  EIGHTY-THREE  COMPLAINT  FROM  THE  SCHOOL
 DISTRICT,  THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT, THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE INVES-
 TIGATION, AND THE DATE BY  WHICH  THE  DEPARTMENT  MUST  ISSUE  NOTICE
 WHETHER  A  SUBSTANTIAL  QUESTION EXISTS AS TO THE MORAL CHARACTER OF AN
 INDIVIDUAL.
  2. (A) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ADD AN INDIVIDUAL  TO  THE  REGISTRY  ONLY
 WHEN  THE  COMPLAINT REGARDING MORAL CHARACTER HAS BEEN MADE BY A SUPER-
 INTENDENT OR CHIEF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR IF THE TITLE  OF  SUPERINTENDENT
 IS NOT APPLICABLE.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ADD AN INDIVIDUAL TO THE INTER-
 NAL  REGISTRY  ON  THE  SAME DAY IT ASSIGNS THE COMPLAINT TO AN INVESTI-
 GATOR. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL NOT ADD AN INDIVIDUAL TO THE INTERNAL REGIS-
 TRY IF THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES THEY  DO  NOT  HAVE  THE  AUTHORITY  TO
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 CLOSED OR UPON A DETERMINATION BY A HEARING OFFICER OR THE  COMMISSIONER
 THAT  THE  INDIVIDUAL  HAS  GOOD MORAL CHARACTER. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL
 HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL MAY REMAIN ON  THE
 REGISTRY  IF  THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES A SUBSTANTIAL QUESTION EXISTS AS
 TO THE MORAL CHARACTER OF THE INDIVIDUAL. IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS  ADDED  TO

 SO.

 BACKGROUND CHECK MATERIALS, NOTIFICATION IF THE  INDIVIDUAL  IS  ON  THE
 INTERNAL  REGISTRY  AND SHALL NOTIFY SOLELY THE SUPERINTENDENT, OR CHIEF
 SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR IF THE TITLE OF SUPERINTENDENT IS  NOT  APPLICABLE,
 OF SUCH SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL IS SEEKING EMPLOYMENT, THAT
 THE INDIVIDUAL IS ON THE INTERNAL REGISTRY.  DISCLOSURE OF THE STATUS OF
 AN INVESTIGATION BY ANYONE BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT OR CHIEF SCHOOL ADMIN-
 ISTRATOR SHALL BE PROHIBITED.
  (B)  IF  THE  INDIVIDUAL  IS  ON THE INTERNAL REGISTRY, THE DEPARTMENT
 SHALL PROVIDE, ALONG WITH THE BACKGROUND CHECK MATERIALS,  THE  INDIVID-
 UAL'S FULL NAME, POSITION OR MOST RECENT POSITION HELD, PLACE OF EMPLOY-

 MENT RECEIVED THE PART EIGHTY-THREE  COMPLAINT, INFORMATION  ABOUT  THE

 ACTER HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED.
  4.  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR APPEALS.  WITHIN

 SION  IN  THE  REGISTRY,  THE  INDIVIDUAL  MAY COMMENCE AN APPEAL TO THE

 INCLUDING  ANY  SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY THE CERTIFIED INDI-
 VIDUAL. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL RENDER A DECISION ON  THE  APPEAL  WITHIN
