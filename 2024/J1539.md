  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 6-10, 2024, as Teacher Appreciation Week in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to highlight the  men  and  women  who
lend their passion and skills to educating our children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  6-10,  2024,  as  Teacher
Appreciation  Week  in  the  State  of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Teacher Appreciation Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, National  Teacher  Appreciation  Day  will  be
celebrated  on May 7, 2024; this day focuses on the teachers who work to
make public schools great places for students to  succeed  in  life,  as
well  as  to honor teachers and recognize the lasting contributions they
make in the lives of their students; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our teachers are more than purveyors of  knowledge  in  the
classroom,  they  also serve our students as role models and mentors and
positively impact the lives of students well beyond the classroom; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Few  other  professionals  touch  as  many  people  as  do
teachers;  teachers  in  the State of New York and in communities across
the Nation will be in the spotlight the  week  of  May  6-10,  2024,  as
students,  parents,  school  administrators and the general public learn
how teachers are making public schools accessible for every child; and
 
  WHEREAS, The citizens of  this  great  Empire  State  recognize  our
teachers  educate  and  nurture all students to be responsible citizens,
critical thinkers and life-long learners to successfully compete in  the
global marketplace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize the
educators of New York State who work to open the minds of their students
to new ideas, knowledge and dreams; who keep American democracy alive by
laying the foundation for good citizenship; who fill many roles such  as
listeners,  explorers,  role  models,  motivators  and  mentors; and who
continue to influence their students long after the school days are only
memories; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 6-10, 2024, as Teacher
Appreciation Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
