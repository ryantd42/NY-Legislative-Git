 in paragraph (e) of subdivision two of section four  hundred  ninety-one
 and  paragraph f-one of subdivision two of section five hundred three of
 this chapter].
  3-a. In addition to the fees retained pursuant to subdivision three of
 this section, each county clerk acting as the agent of the  commissioner
 pursuant  to subdivision one of this section shall retain [four percent]
 A PERCENTAGE of  "enhanced  internet  and  electronic  partner  revenue"
 collected  by  the  commissioner.  For the purposes of this subdivision,
 "enhanced internet and electronic partner revenue" shall mean the amount
 of gross receipts attributable to  all  transactions  conducted  on  the
 internet  by  residents of such county and by designated partners of the
 department on behalf of such residents for  the  current  calendar  year
 [that  exceeds  the amount of such revenue collected by the commissioner
 during calendar year two thousand eleven]. The commissioner shall certi-
 fy the amounts to be retained by each  county  clerk  pursuant  to  this
 subdivision.  [Provided,  however,  that if the aggregate amount of fees
 retained by county clerks pursuant to this subdivision in calendar years
 two thousand twelve and two thousand thirteen combined  exceeds  eighty-
 eight million five hundred thousand dollars, then the percentage of fees
 to  be  retained  thereafter  shall  be reduced to a percentage that, if
 applied to the fees collected during calendar years two thousand  twelve
 and  two thousand thirteen combined, would have resulted in an aggregate
 retention of eighty-eight million five hundred thousand dollars  or  2.5
 percent  of  enhanced internet and electronic partner revenue, whichever
 is higher. If the aggregate amount of fees  retained  by  county  clerks
 pursuant  to  this subdivision in calendar years two thousand twelve and
 two thousand thirteen combined is less than  eighty-eight  million  five
 hundred  thousand  dollars,  then  the percentage of fees to be retained
 thereafter shall be increased to a percentage that, if  applied  to  the
 fees  collected  during calendar years two thousand twelve and two thou-
 sand thirteen combined, would have resulted in an aggregate retention of
 eighty-eight million five hundred thousand dollars, or  six  percent  of
 enhanced  internet and electronic partner revenue, whichever is less. On
 and after April first, two thousand sixteen,  the  percent  of  enhanced
 internet  and electronic partner revenue to be retained by county clerks
 shall be the average of the  annual  percentages  that  were  in  effect
 between  April  first,  two  thousand twelve and March thirty-first, two
 thousand sixteen.] THE RETENTION PERCENTAGE SHALL BE 10.75 PERCENT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect January 1, 2024.

 together with the plate designation and the plate type as shown  by  the
 registration  plates  of  said vehicle and the expiration date, PROVIDED
 THAT THE VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER MAY BE INSERTED IN SUCH NOTICE IN
 PLACE OF OR IN ADDITION TO THE PLATE DESIGNATION  AND  PLATE  TYPE;  the
 make or model, and, PROVIDED THAT A BODY TYPE IS INDICATED ON THE REGIS-

 hours in effect are everyday and/or twenty-four hours a day;  the  meter
 number  for a meter violation, where appropriate; and the date, time and
 particular place of  occurrence  of  the  charged  violation,  shall  be
 inserted  therein.  A mere listing of a meter number in cases of charged
 meter  violations  shall  not  be  deemed  to  constitute  a  sufficient
 description  of  a  particular  place of occurrence for purposes of this
 subdivision. The notice of violation shall be served upon the  owner  of
 the  motor  vehicle  if  the  operator  is not present, by affixing such
 notice to said vehicle in a conspicuous place. Whenever such  notice  is
 so affixed, in lieu of inserting the name of the person charged with the
 violation  in  the space provided for the identification of said person,
 the words "owner of the vehicle bearing license" may be inserted  to  be
 followed  by the plate designation and plate type as shown by the regis-

 number  for  a meter violation where appropriate; and the date, time and
 particular place of occurrence of the charged violation.  Service of the
 notice of violation, or a duplicate  thereof  by  affixation  as  herein
 provided  shall  have  the same force and effect and shall be subject to
 the same  penalties  for  disregard  thereof  as  though  the  same  was
 S. 4008  33  A. 3008
 
 personally served with the name of the person charged with the violation
 inserted therein.

 due to the knowing fraud, false testimony, misrepresentation,  or  other
 misconduct,  or the knowing alteration of a notice of parking violation,
 by the person so charged or his or her  agent,  employee,  or  represen-
 tative.  Such  notice  shall  fix  a time when and place where a hearing
 shall be held before a hearing examiner  to  determine  whether  or  not
 dismissal of a charged parking violation shall be set aside. Such notice
 shall set forth the basis for setting aside the dismissal and advise the
 owner  that  failure  to  appear  at the date and time indicated in such
 notice shall be deemed an admission of liability and shall result in the
 setting aside of the dismissal and  entry  of  a  determination  on  the
 charged  parking  violation.  Such notice shall also contain a warning
 that civil penalties may be imposed for the violation pursuant  to  this
 paragraph and that a default judgment may be entered thereon.

 administrative body or officer, the party in whose favor the  appeal  is
 decided  shall  be entitled to have returned an amount equal to any fine
 or penalty imposed and collected  from  the  parking  violations  bureau
 within  thirty  days  of  the entry of the judgement; provided, however,
 S. 4008  34  A. 3008
 
 that such [court,] administrative body or officer shall have the author-
 ity to lessen from such amount any debt owed by  such  party  and  shall
 apply  this  amount  to  any outstanding fines and penalties owed by the
 same  individual.  If  payment is not made within thirty days, a penalty
 shall accrue at the same rate as that imposed for failure to make timely
 payment of a fine and shall be paid by the parking violations bureau.

  PART O
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph b of subdivision 9 of section 140 of the trans-
 portation law, as amended by chapter 9 of the laws of 2020,  is  amended
 to read as follows:
  b.  (i)  Whenever  [an altered motor vehicle commonly referred to as a
 "stretch limousine"] A PASSENGER CARRYING MOTOR VEHICLE SUBJECT  TO  THE
 JURISDICTION  OF  THE  COMMISSIONER  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION AND
 SECTION EIGHTY OF THIS CHAPTER has failed an inspection and been  placed
 out-of-service,  the  commissioner may direct a police officer or his or
 her agent to immediately secure possession of the number plates of  such
 vehicle  and  return the same to the commissioner of motor vehicles. The
 commissioner shall notify the commissioner of  motor  vehicles  to  that
 effect,  and  the commissioner of motor vehicles shall thereupon suspend
 the registration of such vehicle until such  time  as  the  commissioner
 gives  notice  that  the  out-of-service  defect has been satisfactorily
 adjusted. Provided, however, that the commissioner shall give notice and
 an opportunity to be heard within not  more  than  thirty  days  of  the
 suspension.  Failure  of  the  holder  or  of any person possessing such
 plates to deliver to the commissioner or his or her agent  who  requests
 the  same pursuant to this paragraph shall be a misdemeanor. The commis-
 sioner of motor vehicles shall have the authority to deny a registration
 or renewal application to any other person for the same vehicle where it
 has been determined that such registrant's intent has been to evade  the
 purposes  of this paragraph and where the commissioner of motor vehicles
 has reasonable grounds to believe that such registration or renewal will
 have the effect of defeating the purposes of this paragraph. The  proce-
 dure  on  any  such  suspension  shall  be  the same as in the case of a
 suspension under the vehicle and traffic law.  Operation of  such  motor
 vehicle  while  under  suspension  as provided in this subdivision shall
 constitute a class A misdemeanor.
  (ii) (a) Upon the seizure of number plates  pursuant  to  subparagraph
 (i)  of  this paragraph, if the out-of-service defect is of a type where
 pursuant to the commissioner's  regulations  no  inspection  certificate
 will  be  issued  until  the  defect  is repaired and a re-inspection is
 conducted, or is related to its horn, and  the  commissioner  determines
 that  allowing  the [altered] motor vehicle to leave the inspection area
 would be contrary to public safety, the commissioner may: (A) remove  or
 arrange  for  the removal of, or may direct any police officer to remove
 or arrange for the removal of, the [altered] motor  vehicle  to  a  non-
 public  garage or other place of safety where it shall remain impounded,
 subject to the provisions of this section; or (B) immobilize or  arrange
 for  the immobilization of the [altered] motor vehicle on premises owned
 or under the control of the  owner  of  such  [altered]  motor  vehicle,
 subject  to  the provisions of this section. The [altered] motor vehicle
 S. 4008  35  A. 3008
 
 shall be entered into the New York statewide police information  network
 as  an  impounded  or  immobilized  vehicle  and  the commissioner shall
 promptly notify the owner that the  [altered]  motor  vehicle  has  been
 impounded  or immobilized and the reason or reasons for such impoundment
 or immobilization, and give such owner an opportunity to be heard within
 not more than thirty days of the suspension imposed pursuant to subpara-
 graph (i) of this paragraph.
  (b) A motor vehicle so impounded or immobilized shall be in the custo-
 dy of the commissioner and shall not be released unless the commissioner
 is satisfied that repairs have been scheduled or been made to  satisfac-
 torily  adjust  such vehicle's out-of-service defect or defects and such
 vehicle has been re-inspected.
  (c) The commissioner shall provide written  notice  to  the  owner  or
 operator  of  the  service repair shop or impoundment lot informing them
 that such impounded vehicle shall not be released  without  the  written
 approval  of the commissioner. Release of such impounded vehicle without
 approval by the commissioner shall be punishable by a fine of up to  ten
 thousand dollars[;].

 time  it  operated in New York state but moved its operations out of New
 York state on or before June first, two thousand thirteen,  the  commis-
 sioner  shall  grant that business permission to apply to participate in
 the [START-UP NY] EPIC ZONE program if the commissioner determines  that
 the  business  has  demonstrated  that it will substantially restore the
 jobs in New York state that it previously had moved out of state.
  (g) If a business seeks to expand its current operations in  New  York
 state  into  [a tax-free NY area] AN EPIC ZONE but the business does not

 grant the business permission to apply to participate in  the  [START-UP

 benefits specified in section thirty-nine of the tax law. Subject to the
 limitations of subdivision two of this section, employees of such  busi-
 ness  satisfying the eligibility requirements specified in section thir-
 ty-nine of the tax law shall be eligible for  the  personal  income  tax
 benefits  described  in such section in a manner to be determined by the
 department of taxation and finance.
  2. The aggregate number of net new jobs approved for  personal  income
 tax  benefits  under this article shall not exceed ten thousand jobs per
 year during the period in which applications are  accepted  pursuant  to

 the personal income tax benefits described in subdivision (e) of section

 included  in the application of such business. At such time as the total
 number of net new jobs under  such  approved  applications  reaches  the
 applicable  allowable  total  of aggregate net new jobs for tax benefits
 for the year in which the  application  is  accepted,  the  commissioner
 shall stop granting eligibility for personal income tax benefits for net
 new  jobs  until  the  next year. Any business not granted such personal
 income tax benefits for net new jobs for such reason  shall  be  granted
 such  benefits in the next year prior to the consideration of new appli-
 cants. In addition, if the total number of net new jobs approved for tax
 benefits in any given year is less than the maximum allowed  under  this
 subdivision,  the  difference  shall be carried over to the next year. A
 business may amend its schedule of job creation in the same manner  that
 it  applied for participation in the [START-UP NY] EPIC program, and any
 increase in eligibility for personal income tax benefits  on  behalf  of
 additional  net  new  jobs  shall  be subject to the limitations of this
 subdivision. If the business accepted to locate in [a tax-free NY  area]
 AN  EPIC  ZONE  creates more net new jobs than for which it is allocated
 personal income tax benefits, the personal income  tax  benefits  it  is
 allocated  shall  be provided to those individuals employed in those net
 new jobs based on the employees' dates of hiring.

 amended to read as follows:
  §  436.  Businesses  locating  in [tax-free NY areas] EPIC ZONES. 1. A
 campus, university or college that has sponsored [a tax-free NY area] AN
 EPIC ZONE (including any  strategic  state  asset  affiliated  with  the
 campus,  university  or  college)  shall solicit and accept applications
 from businesses to locate in such area that are consistent with the plan
 of such campus, university or college or strategic state asset that  has
 been approved pursuant to section four hundred thirty-five of this arti-
 cle.  Any  business that wants to locate in [a tax-free NY area must] AN
 EPIC ZONE SHALL submit an  application  to  the  campus,  university  or
 S. 4008  64  A. 3008
 
 college which is sponsoring the [tax-free NY area] EPIC ZONE by December
 thirty-first, two thousand [twenty-five] THIRTY. Prior to such date, the
 commissioner  shall  prepare  an  evaluation on the effectiveness of the
 [START-UP NY] EPIC program and deliver it to the governor and the legis-
 lature to determine continued eligibility for application submissions.
  2.  (a) The sponsoring campus, university or college shall provide the
 application and all supporting documentation of any business it  decides
 to  accept into its [tax-free NY area] EPIC ZONE to the commissioner for
 review. Such application shall be in a form prescribed  by  the  commis-
 sioner  and shall contain all information the commissioner determines is
 necessary to properly evaluate the  business's  application,  including,
 but  not  limited  to,  the  name,  address, and employer identification
 number of the business; a description of the land or space the  business
 will  use,  the terms of the lease agreement, if applicable, between the
 sponsoring campus, university or college and the business,  and  whether
 or not the land or space being used by the business is being transferred
 or sublet to the business from some other business. The application must
 include  a  certification  by the business that it meets the eligibility
 criteria specified in section four hundred thirty-three of this  article
 and  will  align  with or further the academic mission of the sponsoring
 campus, college or university, and that the business's participation  in
 the [START-UP NY] EPIC program will have positive community and economic
 benefits.  The application must also describe whether or not the busi-
 ness competes with other businesses in the same  community  but  outside
 the  [tax-free  NY  area]  EPIC  ZONE. In addition, the application must
 include a description of how the business  plans  to  recruit  employees
 from the local workforce.
  (b)  The  commissioner shall review such application and documentation
 within sixty days and may reject such application upon  a  determination
 that the business does not meet the eligibility criteria in section four
 hundred thirty-three of this article, has submitted an incomplete appli-
 cation,  has failed to comply with subdivision three of this section, or
 has failed to demonstrate  that  the  business's  participation  in  the
 [START-UP  NY]  EPIC  program  will have positive community and economic
 benefits, which shall be evaluated based on factors  including  but  not
 limited to whether or not the business competes with other businesses in
 the  same  community  but  outside  the  [tax-free NY area] EPIC ZONE as
 prohibited by section four hundred forty of this article. If the commis-
 sioner rejects  such  application,  it  shall  provide  notice  of  such
 rejection  to the sponsoring campus, university or college and business.
 If the commissioner does not reject such application within sixty  days,
 such  business  is  accepted  to  locate in such [tax-free NY area] EPIC
 ZONE, and the application of such business shall constitute  a  contract
 between  such business and the sponsoring campus, university or college.
 The sponsoring campus, university or college must provide accepted busi-
 nesses  with  documentation  of  their  acceptances  in  such  form  as
 prescribed  by  the  commissioner  of taxation and finance which will be
 used to demonstrate such business's eligibility  for  the  tax  benefits
 specified in section thirty-nine of the tax law.
  (c) If a state university campus proposes to enter into a lease with a
 business  for  eligible land in [a tax-free NY area] AN EPIC ZONE with a
 term greater than forty years, including any options to  renew,  or  for
 eligible  land  in  [a  tax-free NY area] AN EPIC ZONE of one million or
 more square feet, the state university campus, at the same time  as  the
 application  is provided to the commissioner, also must submit the lease
 for review to the [START-UP NY] EPIC approval board. If the  board  does
 S. 4008  65  A. 3008
 
 not  disapprove  of  the  lease  terms  within thirty days, the lease is
 deemed approved. If the board disapproves the  lease  terms,  the  state
 university  campus  must submit modified lease terms to the commissioner
 for  review.  The  commissioner's  sixty  day review period is suspended
 while the board is reviewing the lease and during the time it takes  for
 the state university campus to modify the lease terms.
  (d) Except as otherwise provided in this article, proprietary informa-
 tion or supporting documentation submitted by a business to a sponsoring
 campus,  university or college shall only be utilized for the purpose of
 evaluating such business's application or compliance with the provisions
 of this article and shall not be otherwise  disclosed.  Any  person  who
 willfully  discloses  such  information  to  a third party for any other
 purpose whatsoever shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
  3. The business submitting the application, as part  of  the  applica-
 tion, must:
  (a) agree to allow the department of taxation and finance to share its
 tax information with the department and the sponsoring campus, universi-
 ty or college;

 jobs  that  must  be  created, the schedule for creating those jobs, and

 by  the  business  and the sponsoring campus, university or college: (i)
 suspension of such business's participation in the  [START-UP  NY]  EPIC
 program for one or more tax years as specified in such application; (ii)
 termination  of  such business's participation in the [START-UP NY] EPIC
 program; and/or (iii) proportional  recovery  of  tax  benefits  awarded
 under the [START-UP NY] EPIC program as specified in section thirty-nine

 related  persons  to  the  business, including those of any members of a
 limited liability company or partners in a partnership;
  (f) provide a clear and detailed presentation of all  related  persons
 to the business to assure the department that jobs are not being shifted
 within the state; and
  (g)  certify,  under  penalty  of  perjury,  that it is in substantial
 compliance with all environmental, worker protection, and local,  state,
 and federal tax laws, and that it satisfies all the eligibility require-
 ments to participate in the [START-UP NY] EPIC program.
  4.  (a) At the conclusion of the lease term of a lease by the sponsor-
 ing campus, university or college to a business of land or space  in  [a
 tax-free NY area] AN EPIC ZONE owned by the sponsoring campus, universi-
 ty  or  college,  the  leased land or space and any improvements thereon
 S. 4008  66  A. 3008
 
 shall revert to the sponsoring campus, university or college, unless the
 lease is renewed.
  (b)  If,  at any time, the sponsoring campus, university or college or
 the commissioner determines that a business no longer satisfies  any  of
 the  eligibility criteria specified in section four hundred thirty-three
 of this article, the sponsoring  campus,  university  or  college  shall
 recommend  to  the  commissioner  that the commissioner terminate or the
 commissioner on his or her own initiative  shall  immediately  terminate
 such  business's  participation  in the [START-UP NY] EPIC ZONE program.
 Such business shall be notified of such termination by  a  method  which
 allows for verification of receipt of such termination notice. A copy of
 such  termination  notice  shall be sent to the commissioner of taxation
 and finance. Upon such termination, such business shall not be  eligible
 for the tax benefits specified in section thirty-nine of the tax law for
 that  or any future taxable year, calendar quarter or sales tax quarter,
 although employees of such business may continue to claim the tax  bene-
 fit for their wages during the remainder of that taxable year.  Further,
 such  lease  or  contract  between  the sponsoring campus, university or
 college and such business shall be rescinded, effective on the thirtieth
 day after the commissioner mailed such termination notice to such  busi-
 ness  and the land or space and any improvements thereon shall revert to
 the sponsoring campus, university or college.
  5. The commissioner shall promulgate  regulations  to  effectuate  the
 purposes  of  this  section, including, but not limited to, establishing
 the process for the evaluation and possible rejection  of  applications,
 the eligibility criteria that will be applied in evaluating those appli-
 cations,  and  the  process for terminations from the [START-UP NY] EPIC

  § 40. The [tax-free NY area] EPIC ZONE  tax  elimination  credit.  (a)
 Allowance  of  credit. A taxpayer that is a business or owner of a busi-
 ness in the case of a business taxed as a sole proprietorship,  partner-
 ship  or New York S corporation, that is located in [a tax-free NY area]
 AN EPIC ZONE approved pursuant to article  twenty-one  of  the  economic
 development  law  and is subject to tax under article nine-A, or twenty-
 two of this chapter, shall be allowed a credit against such tax,  pursu-
 ant  to the provisions referenced in subdivision (e) of this section, to
 be computed as hereinafter provided.
  (b) Amount of credit. The amount of the credit shall  be  the  product
 of:  (1)  the [tax-free area] EPIC ZONE allocation factor; and (2) the
 tax factor.
  (c) [Tax-free area] EPIC ZONE allocation factor. The  [tax-free  area]
 EPIC  ZONE  allocation  factor  shall be the percentage representing the
 business's economic presence in the [tax-free NY area]  EPIC  ZONE  in
 which the business was approved to locate pursuant to article twenty-one
 of the economic development law. This percentage shall be computed by:
  (1)  ascertaining  the  percentage that the average value of the busi-
 ness's real and tangible personal property, whether owned or  rented  to
 it,  in  the  [tax-free  NY  area]  EPIC  ZONE in which the business was
 located during the period covered by the  taxpayer's  report  or  return
 bears  to the average value of the business's real and tangible personal
 property, whether owned or rented to it, within the  state  during  such
 period;  provided that the term "value of the business's real and tangi-
 ble personal property" shall have the same meaning as such term  has  in
 paragraph  (a)  of subdivision two of section two hundred nine-B of this
 chapter; and
  (2) ascertaining the percentage that the  total  wages,  salaries  and
 other  personal  service  compensation,  similarly computed, during such
 period of employees, except general executive officers, employed at  the
 business's  location  in  the [tax-free NY area] EPIC ZONE, bears to the
 total wages, salaries and other personal service compensation, similarly
 computed, during such period, of all the business's employees within the
 state, except general executive officers; and
 S. 4008  74  A. 3008
 
  (3) adding together the percentages so  determined  and  dividing  the
 result by two.
  For purposes of article twenty-two of this chapter, references in this
 subdivision  to  property,  wages,  salaries  and other personal service
 compensation shall be deemed to be references to  such  items  connected
 with the conduct of a business.
  (d)  Tax  factor. (1) General. The tax factor shall be, in the case of
 article nine-A of this chapter, the largest of the amounts of tax deter-
 mined for the taxable year under paragraphs (a) through (d) of  subdivi-
 sion  one of section two hundred ten of such article after the deduction
 of any other credits allowable under such article. The tax factor  shall
 be,  in  the  case of article twenty-two of this chapter, the tax deter-
 mined for the taxable year under subsections (a) through (d) of  section
 six hundred one of such article after the deduction of any other credits
 allowable under such article.
  (2)  Sole  proprietors,  partners  and S corporation shareholders. (A)
 Where the taxpayer is a sole proprietor of  a  business  located  in  [a
 tax-free  NY area] AN EPIC ZONE, the taxpayer's tax factor shall be that
 portion of the amount determined in paragraph one  of  this  subdivision
 that  is  attributable  to the income of the business at its location in
 the [tax-free NY area] EPIC ZONE. Such  attribution  shall  be  made  in
 accordance  with  the  ratio of the taxpayer's income from such business
 allocated within the  state,  entering  into  New  York  adjusted  gross
 income,  to the taxpayer's New York adjusted gross income, or in accord-
 ance with such other  methods  as  the  commissioner  may  prescribe  as
 providing  an  apportionment that reasonably reflects the portion of the
 taxpayer's tax attributable to the income of such business. In no  event
 may  the  ratio  so determined exceed 1.0. The income from such business
 allocated within the state shall be determined as if the sole proprietor
 was a non-resident.
  (B)(i) Where the taxpayer is a member of a partnership that is a busi-
 ness located in [a tax-free NY area] AN EPIC ZONE,  the  taxpayer's  tax
 factor  shall  be that portion of the amount determined in paragraph one
 of this subdivision that is attributable to the income of  the  partner-
 ship. Such attribution shall be made in accordance with the ratio of the
 partner's  income from the partnership allocated within the state to the
 partner's entire income, or in accordance with such other methods as the
 commissioner may prescribe as providing an apportionment that reasonably
 reflects the portion of the partner's tax attributable to the income  of
 the partnership. In no event may the ratio so determined exceed 1.0. The
 income  from  the partnership allocated within the state shall be deter-
 mined as if any of the partners was a non-resident.
  (ii) For purposes of article nine-A of this chapter, the  term  "part-
 ner's  income  from  the partnership" means partnership items of income,
 gain, loss and deduction, and New York modifications  thereto,  entering
 into  business income and the term "partner's entire income" means busi-
 ness income, allocated within the state. For purposes of  article  twen-
 ty-two of this chapter, the term "partner's income from the partnership"
 means  partnership  items  of  income, gain, loss and deduction, and New
 York modifications  thereto,  entering  into  New  York  adjusted  gross
 income,  and  the term "partner's entire income" means New York adjusted
 gross income.
  (C) (i) Where the taxpayer is a shareholder of a  New  York  S  corpo-
 ration  that is a business located in [a tax-free NY area] AN EPIC ZONE,
 the shareholder's tax factor shall be that portion of the amount  deter-
 mined  in  paragraph one of this subdivision that is attributable to the
 S. 4008  75  A. 3008

 income of the S corporation. Such attribution shall be made  in  accord-
 ance  with  the ratio of the shareholder's income from the S corporation
 allocated within the  state,  entering  into  New  York  adjusted  gross
 income,  to  the  shareholder's  New  York  adjusted gross income, or in
 accordance with such other methods as the commissioner may prescribe  as
 providing  an  apportionment that reasonably reflects the portion of the
 shareholder's tax attributable to  the  income  of  such  business.  The
 income  of  the S corporation allocated within the state shall be deter-
 mined by multiplying the income of the S corporation by a business allo-
 cation factor that shall be determined in clause (ii) of  this  subpara-
 graph. In no event may the ratio so determined exceed 1.0.
  (ii)  The business allocation factor for purposes of this subparagraph
 shall be computed by adding together the property  factor  specified  in
 subclause  (I)  of  this  clause, the wage factor specified in subclause
 (II) of this  clause  and  the  apportionment  factor  determined  under
 section two hundred ten-A of this chapter and dividing by three.
  (I)  The  property  factor  shall  be  determined  by ascertaining the
 percentage that the average value of the business's  real  and  tangible
 personal  property,  whether  owned  or  rented  to it, within the state
 during the period covered by the taxpayer's report or  return  bears  to
 the average value of the business's real and tangible personal property,
 whether  owned or rented to it, within and without the state during such
 period; provided that the term "value of the business's real and  tangi-
 ble  personal  property" shall have the same meaning as such term has in
 paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section two hundred nine-B  of  this
 chapter.
  (II)  The wage factor shall be determined by ascertaining the percent-
 age that the total wages, salaries and other  personal  service  compen-
 sation,  similarly  computed,  during  such  period of employees, except
 general executive officers,  employed  at  the  business's  location  or
 locations within the state, bears to the total wages, salaries and other
 personal  service  compensation, similarly computed, during such period,
 of all the business's employees within and  without  the  state,  except
 general executive officers.
  (3)  Combined returns or reports. (A) Where the taxpayer is a business
 located in [a tax-free NY area] AN EPIC ZONE and is required or  permit-
 ted  to make a return or report on a combined basis under article nine-A
 of this chapter, the taxpayer's tax factor shall be  the  amount  deter-
 mined  in  paragraph one of this subdivision that is attributable to the
 income of such business. Such attribution shall be  made  in  accordance
 with  the  ratio  of the business's income allocated within the state to
 the combined group's income, or in accordance with such other methods as
 the commissioner  may  prescribe  as  providing  an  apportionment  that
 reasonably reflects the portion of the combined group's tax attributable
 to  the income of such business. In no event may the ratio so determined
 exceed 1.0.
  (B) The term "income of the business located in [a tax-free  NY  area]
 AN  EPIC  ZONE"  means business income calculated as if the taxpayer was
 filing separately and the term "combined group's income" means  business
 income as shown on the combined report, allocated within the state.
  (4)  If  a  business  is generating or receiving income from a line of
 business or intangible property that was previously  conducted,  created
 or  developed  by  the  business  or  a  related person, as that term is
 defined in section four hundred thirty-one of the  economic  development
 law,  the  tax factor specified in this subdivision shall be adjusted to
 disregard such income.

  PART TT
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Suffolk County water quality restoration act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The county  of  Suffolk  ("county"),  with  a
 population  of  one million five hundred thousand persons, has in excess
 of three hundred eighty  thousand  existing  onsite  systems,  comprised
 mostly  of  cesspools and septic systems, with two hundred nine thousand
 of these onsite systems in environmentally sensitive areas  which  could
 benefit  from nitrogen-reducing technologies. The United States Environ-
 mental Protection Agency recognizes Long Island as having a sole  source
 aquifer  system  for  its  drinking  water supply. Suffolk county has an
 imminent need to preserve this valuable water resource by  reducing  the
 amount  of  nitrogen  discharged into the groundwater by onsite systems.
 The full water cycle is impacted by increasing quantities of  nutrients,
 pathogens,  pesticides,  volatile  organic  contaminants  and  saltwater
 intrusion, as well as a number of emerging threats such as  prescription
 drugs and sea level rise.
  The Suffolk county subwatersheds wastewater plan ("SWP"), certified by
 the  department  of  environmental  conservation  as  a  Nine  Elements
 Watershed (9E) plan, has documented  the  devastating  effects  of  high
 S. 4008  118  A. 3008
 
 levels  of  nitrogen  pollution, not only on the drinking water quality,
 but  also  on  coastal  ecosystems,  dissolved  oxygen,  water  clarity,
 eelgrass,  wetlands,  shellfish,  coastal  resilience  and in triggering
 harmful  algal  blooms. The SWP, is a long-term plan to address the need
 for wastewater treatment infrastructure throughout the county comprehen-
 sively over a period of fifty years. The SWP delineates the  source  and
 concentration  of  nitrogen  loading  in  one hundred ninety-one subwat-
 ersheds throughout the county, and establishes nitrogen reduction  goals
 for each watershed.
  For many areas of the county, installing or connecting sewers is not a
 practical  or  cost-effective  method  of  treating wastewater. For that
 reason, the SWP prescribes a hybrid approach  that  relies  on  sewering
 where feasible, and the replacement of cesspools and septic systems with
 innovative/alternative  onsite wastewater treatment systems. The consol-
 idation of any or all of the twenty-seven  county  sewer  districts,  as
 well  as  unsewered  areas  of the county, into a county-wide wastewater
 management district would allow for the implementation of a much  needed
 integrated  long-term wastewater solution for the county through compre-
 hensive planning and management to improve water quality and support new
 housing production.
  The purpose of this act is to create a water quality restoration  fund
 to finance projects for the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation
 of  groundwater  and  surface waters as recommended by the SWP. This act
 would allow the funding of projects that will mitigate wastewater pollu-
 tants utilizing the best available technology consistent  with  the  SWP
 and address barriers to housing and economic development.
  This  act  shall provide Suffolk county with the authority to create a
 county-wide wastewater management district through the consolidation  of
 existing  county special districts with currently unsewered areas of the
 county and the authority to  consolidate  existing  town  districts  and
 village sewer systems. A county-wide wastewater management district will
 provide  an  integrated  and  efficient  approach to managing wastewater
 services across the county; allow the county to enhance and  expand  its
 incentive  program to property owners to upgrade their wastewater treat-
 ment systems without risk of adverse personal income  tax  consequences;
 to  manage,  monitor  and enforce nitrogen reduction programs throughout
 the county; to complete additional sewer extension projects; improve the
 economic wellbeing of communities; make progress on barriers to  housing
 development;  and  provide  an opportunity to consolidate and streamline
 the county's existing sewer district system and normalize the  inequita-
 ble rate structure that has long existed.
  §  3.  The county law is amended by adding a new section 256-b to read
 as follows:

  § 4. Section 16-109 of the energy law, as added by chapter 374 of  the
 laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  §  16-109.  Conflicts  with other laws. [Nothing in this] THIS article
 [or in] AND any  regulation  adopted  pursuant  to  this  article  shall
 [limit,  impair,  or supersede] BE SUBJECT TO the provisions of subdivi-
 sion one of section three hundred eighty-three of the executive law [or]
 AND the provisions of subdivision three of section 11-103 of this  chap-
 ter.
  §  5. Section 371 of the executive law, as added by chapter 707 of the
 laws of 1981, is amended to read as follows:
  § 371. Statement of legislative findings and purposes. 1. The legisla-
 ture hereby finds and declares that:
  a. The present level of loss of life, injury to persons, and damage to
 property as a result of fire demonstrates that the people of  the  state
 have  yet  to  receive  the  basic level of protection to which they are
 entitled in connection with the construction and maintenance  of  build-
 ings;
  b. There does not exist for all areas of the state a single, adequate,
 enforceable  code establishing minimum standards for fire protection and
 construction, maintenance and use of materials  in  buildings.  Instead,
 there  exists a multiplicity of codes and requirements for various types
 of buildings administered at various levels of state and  local  govern-
 ment.  There  are, in addition, extensive areas of the state in which no
 code at all is in effect for the general benefit of the  people  of  the
 state;
  c.  The  present system of enforcement of fire protection and building
 construction codes is characterized by  a  lack  of  adequately  trained
 personnel,  as  well  as  inconsistent  qualifications for personnel who
 administer and enforce those codes;
  d. Whether because of the absence of applicable codes, inadequate code
 provisions or inadequate enforcement of codes, the threat to the  public
 health  and  safety  posed by fire remains a real and present danger for
 the people of the state; [and]
  e. THE FIRE PROTECTION AND  BUILDING  CONSTRUCTION  CODE  REQUIREMENTS
 SHALL  ALIGN  WITH  REGULATIONS  PROMULGATED  PURSUANT  TO  THE NEW YORK
 CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND PROTECTION  ACT  SET  FORTH  WITHIN  CHAPTER  ONE
 HUNDRED  SIX  OF  THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO AS TO SUPPORT THE
 REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS SET FORTH IN SECTION  EIGHT  OF
 SUCH ACT; AND
  F.  The multiplicity of fire protection and building construction code
 requirements poses an additional problem for the  people  of  the  state
 since it increases the cost of doing business in the state by perpetuat-
 ing  multiple  requirements, jurisdictional overlaps and business uncer-
 tainties,  and,  in  some  instances,  by  artificially  inducing  high
 construction costs.
  2.  The legislature declares that it shall be the public policy of the
 state of New York to:
  a. Immediately provide for a minimum  level  of  protection  from  the
 hazards of fire in every part of the state;
  b.  Provide for the promulgation of a uniform code addressing building
 construction and fire prevention in order to  provide  a  basic  minimum
 level  of protection to all people of the state from hazards of fire and
 inadequate building construction. In providing for such a uniform  code,
 it is declared to be the policy of the state of New York to:
  (1)  reconcile  the  myriad existing and potentially conflicting regu-
 lations which apply to different types of buildings and occupancies;
 S. 4008  129  A. 3008
 
  (2) recognize that fire  prevention  and  fire  prevention  codes  are
 closely related to the adequacy of building construction codes, that the
 greatest  portion  of  a  building  code's  requirements are fire safety
 oriented, and that fire prevention and  building  construction  concerns
 should be the subject of a single code;
  (3)  RECOGNIZE  THAT THE DECARBONIZATION OF NEW AND EXISTING BUILDINGS
 IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY  AND  CLIMATE  AGENDA  AS
 DESCRIBED  IN  THE  NEW YORK CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION
 ACT SET FORTH IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE  LAWS  OF  TWO  THOUSAND
 NINETEEN, AND THAT THE UNIFORM CODE SHALL ENABLE THE STATE'S CLEAN ENER-
 GY OBJECTIVES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE;
  (4)  place public and private buildings on an equal plane with respect
 to fire prevention and adequacy of building construction;
  [(4)] (5) require new and existing buildings alike to keep  pace  with
 advances  in  technology  concerning  fire  prevention  and  building
 construction, including, where appropriate, that provisions apply  on  a
 retroactive basis; and
  [(5)]  (6)  provide protection to both residential and non-residential
 buildings;
  c. Insure that the uniform code be in full force and effect  in  every
 area of the state;
  d. Encourage local governments to exercise their full powers to admin-
 ister and enforce the uniform code; and
  e. Provide for a uniform, statewide approach to the training and qual-
 ification  of personnel engaged in the administration and enforcement of
 the uniform code.
  § 6. Subdivision 2 of section 375 of the executive law, as amended  by
 chapter 309 of the laws of 1996, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  To study the operation of the uniform fire prevention and building
 code, the state energy conservation  construction  code  established  by
 article  eleven  of  the  energy  law,  local regulations and other laws
 relating to the construction of buildings and the protection  of  build-
 ings  from  fire  to  ascertain  their effects upon the cost of building
 construction and the effectiveness of their provisions for health, safe-
 ty  and  security,  particularly  as  such  provisions  relate  to  the
 protection of life and property from the dangers of fire, AND THE EFFEC-
 TIVENESS  OF  THEIR PROVISIONS FOR THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMIS-
 SIONS AND CO-POLLUTANTS IN FURTHERANCE OF THE STATE'S CLEAN  ENERGY  AND
 CLIMATE AGENDA PURSUANT TO THE NEW YORK CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND COMMUNITY
 PROTECTION  ACT  SET FORTH WITHIN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF

 president  in consultation with the secretary shall have and be entitled
 to exercise the following powers and duties:
  (a) To adopt regulations establishing [efficiency] PERFORMANCE  stand-
 ards  for the products listed in paragraphs (a) through (xx) of subdivi-
 sion one of section 16-104 of this article, including  but  not  limited
 to,  establishing  [efficiency] PERFORMANCE standards for power supplies
 in the active mode and no-load mode or other such products while in  the
 active mode and in the standby-passive-mode;
  (b)  To adopt regulations establishing [efficiency] PERFORMANCE stand-
 ards for products not specifically listed in paragraphs (a) through (xx)
 of subdivision one of section 16-104 of this article, provided that  the
 president  determines  that  establishing  such [efficiency] PERFORMANCE
 standards would serve to promote energy reduction,  water  conservation,
 greenhouse gas reduction, [and/or] OR increased demand flexibility asso-
 ciated with the regulated product categories in this state. To the maxi-
 mum  extent  feasible  the  president shall coordinate any such adoption
 with similar efforts by other states. Any regulation adopted pursuant to
 this paragraph may include provisions establishing procedures for  test-
 ing  the [efficiency] PERFORMANCE of the covered products and provisions
 establishing procedures for manufacturers of  such  product  to  certify
 that  such  products meet the [efficiency] PERFORMANCE standards, if the
 president determines that such manufacturer's certifications  should  be
 required;
  (c)  To review [efficiency] PERFORMANCE standards as adopted from time
 to time by other states  for  products  not  listed  in  paragraphs  (a)
 through  (xx)  of subdivision one of section 16-104 of this article, and
 S. 4008  134  A. 3008
 
 to adopt regulations  establishing  [efficiency]  PERFORMANCE  standards
 similar  to those adopted by any other state for such products, provided
 that  the  president  determines  that  establishing  such  [efficiency]
 PERFORMANCE  standards  would  serve  to promote energy reduction, water
 conservation, greenhouse gas reduction,  [and/or]  OR  increased  demand
 flexibility  associated  with  the  regulated product categories in this
 state. Any regulation adopted pursuant to  this  paragraph  may  include
 provisions establishing procedures for testing the [efficiency] PERFORM-
 ANCE  of the covered products and provisions establishing procedures for
 manufacturers of such product to certify that  such  products  meet  the
 [efficiency]  PERFORMANCE  standards,  if  the president determines that
 such manufacturer's certifications should be required;
  (d) To adopt regulations to achieve the purposes of this article. Such
 regulations shall ensure that compliance therewith will not result in  a
 net  increase  in co-pollutant emissions or otherwise disproportionately
 burden disadvantaged communities as identified by  the  climate  justice
 working  group  established  under  section 75-0111 of the environmental
 conservation law. In order to increase public participation and  improve
 the  efficacy of any [efficiency] PERFORMANCE standards adopted pursuant
 to [subdivision] PARAGRAPH (b) or (c) of this [section] SUBDIVISION, the
 president shall, before publication of a notice of proposed rule making,
 conduct public meetings to provide meaningful opportunities  for  public
 comment  from  all  segments of the population that would be impacted by
 the standards or regulations, including persons living in  disadvantaged
 communities  as  identified  by the climate justice working group estab-
 lished under section 75-0111 of the environmental conservation law;

  PART AAA
 
  Section  1. Legislative findings and declaration. 1. Pursuant to arti-
 cle 75 of the environmental conservation law, as added  by  the  Climate
 Leadership and Community Protection Act, the department of environmental
 conservation  must promulgate regulations, by January 1, 2024, to ensure
 achievement of the statewide greenhouse gas emission limits, as  defined
 and  established  therein.  Among  other requirements, the regulations
 promulgated by such department pursuant to section 75-0109 of the  envi-
 ronmental  conservation  law must ensure that the aggregate emissions of
 greenhouse gases from greenhouse gas emission sources  will  not  exceed
 the  statewide  greenhouse  gas  emissions limits established in section
 75-0107 of the environmental conservation law; include legally enforcea-
 ble emissions  limits,  performance  standards,  or  measures  or  other
 requirements  to control emissions from greenhouse gas emission sources;
 and reflect, in substantial part,  the  findings  of  the  scoping  plan
 prepared  by  the  Climate Action Council pursuant to section 75-0103 of
 the environmental conservation law.
  2. The scoping plan prepared by the Climate Action Council pursuant to
 section 75-0103 of the environmental conservation  law  recommends  that
 the  department  of  environmental  conservation  and the New York state
 energy research and development authority adopt an economy-wide cap  and
 invest  program  to,  among  other  purposes,  ensure achievement of the
 statewide greenhouse gas limits, as defined and established  in  article
 75 of the environmental conservation law.
  3.  An  economy-wide cap and invest program, established through regu-
 lation by the department of environmental conservation and the New  York
 state energy research and development authority, would meet the require-
 ments of section 75-0109 of the environmental conservation law.
  4.  While  the establishment of an economy-wide cap and invest program
 through regulation is the most cost-effective  means  of  achieving  the
 statewide  greenhouse gas emission limits, as defined and established in
 article 75 of the environmental conservation law, the state must  ensure
 that energy costs are affordable for all members of the public.
  5.  To promote affordability, a portion of the proceeds of the auction
 or sale of allowances under the economy-wide cap and invest program will
 be designated to mitigate costs through the creation of a climate action
 S. 4008  156  A. 3008
 
 fund, that will assist in reducing the costs  of  the  program  for  the
 people  of  the  state  and  for  industrial small businesses within the
 state, and which, in combination with other investments made possible by
 the  cap  and invest program, help households and industrial small busi-
 nesses reduce their energy costs by switching to clean energy.
  6. In promulgating the regulations, pursuant to section 75-0109 of the
 environmental conservation law, to establish  an  economy-wide  cap  and
 invest  program, the department of environmental conservation in consul-
 tation with the New York state energy research and development authority
 will prioritize affordability in the design of the program, including by
 considering as part of the rulemaking process the aggregate cost of  the
 program when applying the carbon dioxide equivalent and statewide green-
 house  gas emission limit, as those terms are defined in section 75-0101
 of the environmental conservation law, and, in  addition  the  aggregate
 cost  of  the  program  if  the  carbon dioxide equivalent and statewide
 greenhouse gas limit as  defined  under  internationally  accepted  best
 practices or other metrics is applied.
  7.  To  ensure  the  state maintains its role as a climate leader, the
 economy-wide cap and invest program will be designed with  the  capacity
 to  link  with  other  similar  programs in other jurisdictions to lower
 overall costs for the state to  achieve  the  statewide  greenhouse  gas
 emission  limits,  as defined and established in article 75 of the envi-
 ronmental conservation law, and catalyze additional emissions reductions
 and greater scale in the clean energy economy across multiple  jurisdic-
 tions.
  8.  The  economy-wide  cap and invest program to be established by the
 department of environmental conservation and the New York  state  energy
 research  and  development authority will be designed to create jobs and
 preserve the competitiveness of the state's existing businesses, includ-
 ing  creating well-paying, family-sustaining jobs  and  by  recognizing
 energy  intensive  and  trade  exposed  industries and designing program
 elements, such as direct allocation of allowances to  qualifying  green-
 house gas emission sources in such industries, to prevent leakage.
  9.  The  economy-wide  cap and invest program to be established by the
 department of environmental conservation and the New York  state  energy
 research and development authority will be designed to invest in and, as
 appropriate, prioritize disadvantaged communities, including by ensuring
 investments of the proceeds of allowances benefit disadvantaged communi-
 ties,  as  required by section 75-0117 of the environmental conservation
 law, and by designing other program elements to  avoid  disproportionate
 burdens on disadvantaged communities.
  10.  To invest in a sustainable future, the proceeds of the auction or
 sale of allowances under the economy-wide cap and  invest  program  will
 provide  funding to support programmatic investments designed to achieve
 the statewide greenhouse gas emission limit, as defined and  established
 in article 75 of the environmental conservation law, delivering benefits
 across  the state and enhancing livability, cutting transition costs for
 consumers, and creating a better state.
