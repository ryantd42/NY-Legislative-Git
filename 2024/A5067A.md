 York City police department, shall be entitled to a 75% accidental disa-
 bility  retirement  benefit pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision d of
 section 605 of the retirement and social security  law  based  upon  the
 determination  by  the  New  York  state and local employees' retirement

 ment benefit equal to 75% of final average salary, payable  pursuant  to
 Section 605(d)(4) of the Retirement and Social Security Law, as a result
 of  their  participation  in the World Trade Center rescue, recovery and
 cleanup  operations.  The  retirement benefit would be recalculated, and
 payment would be made retroactive to the date of retirement.

 will  be  an immediate past service cost of approximately $262,000 which
 will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This esti-
 mate assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
