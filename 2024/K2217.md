  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Cancer Research Month in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and observe the importance  of
cancer research to the residents of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant to such concern, this Legislative Body is justly
proud to memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2024,  as
Cancer  Research  Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with
National Cancer Research Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cancer is the second leading cause of death  in  New  York,
and it is estimated that 31,320 New York residents will die of cancer in
2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Research  and  new  developments  in cancer screenings and
treatment are helping patients live longer; and
 
  WHEREAS, The number of people who have lived 5 or more  years  after
their  cancer  diagnosis  is  projected  to increase by approximately 30
percent, to 16.3 million over the next decade; and
 
  WHEREAS, May is National Cancer Research Month, a time to  highlight
the  vital role of research and development in the fight against cancer;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Six of the top ten causes of cancer deaths in New York have
no recommended screening test; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cancers detected when still localized can be  treated  more
effectively  and  have  a  five-year  cancer-specific  survival  of
approximately 90 percent compared  with  approximately  20  percent  for
cancers found after metastasis has occurred; and
 
  WHEREAS, Several innovative private and academic efforts are engaged
in  research, including advanced clinical trials to develop multi-cancer
early detection blood-based tests; and
 
  WHEREAS, Published data indicates that these tests  can  screen  for
many  cancers at the same time, including rare cancers, with one example
currently able to screen for more than 50 cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Multi-cancer early detection tests can  complement  covered
early  detection  tests,  and  extend the benefits of early detection to
more cancers and more Americans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body commends  the  researchers  and
scientists  who  have  developed multi-cancer early detection tests, and
encourages increased access and coverage to these tests to reduce cancer
deaths in New York and across our nation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
