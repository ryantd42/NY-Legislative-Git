 and electric corporation to establish classifications of  service  based
 upon  the quantity used, the time when used, the purpose for which used,
 the duration of use and upon any other reasonable consideration, and  to
 establish  in  connection  therewith just and reasonable graduated rates
 and charges; and it shall have power, either upon complaint or upon  its

 language AND SHALL INDICATE THE ACCOUNT NUMBER AND/OR METER  NUMBER  FOR
 THE  ACCOUNT  FOR  WHICH  SERVICE IS BEING CHARGED.  The commission may,
 from time to time, specify the form and content of such bills to further
 the objectives of this subdivision.  FOR UTILITY CORPORATIONS, SUCH BILL
