 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to the New York state
  medical indemnity fund account payments; and to amend chapter  517  of
  the  laws of 2016, amending the public health law relating to payments
  from the New York state medical indemnity fund,  in  relation  to  the
  effectiveness  thereof;  and  providing  for  the  repeal  of  certain
  provisions of the public health law upon the expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  (d)  of subdivision 6 of section 2999-i of the
 public health law, as amended by section 2 of part K of  chapter  57  of
 the laws of 2019, is amended and a new paragraph (e) is added to read as

  (d)  The  suspension  of  enrollment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
 subdivision shall not impact payment under the fund  for  any  qualified
 plaintiffs  already enrolled in the fund FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE QUALI-
 FIED PLAINTIFF'S LIFE.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF  LAW,  RULE  OR
 REGULATION  TO  THE CONTRARY, THE FUND ACCOUNT IS AUTHORIZED TO MAINTAIN
 PAYMENTS FOR QUALIFIED PLAINTIFFS ALREADY ENROLLED IN THE FUND  FOR  THE
 ENTIRE  STATE  FISCAL  YEAR  EVEN IF TOTAL EXPENDITURES EXCEED AVAILABLE
 APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY.
  (E) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW, RULE OR  REGULATION  TO  THE
 CONTRARY, ON OR AFTER APRIL FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR AND ANNUALLY
 THEREAFTER,  THE  STATE  COMPTROLLER SHALL TRANSFER MONEY FROM THE STATE
 TREASURY INTO THE FUND ACCOUNT IN AN AMOUNT WHICH SHALL BE SUFFICIENT TO
 AVOID SUSPENSION OF NEW ENROLLMENT FOR THE  ENTIRE  STATE  FISCAL  YEAR.
 NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY PROVISION OF LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO THE CONTRA-
 RY, ANY APPROPRIATION(S) IN THE ENACTED  STATE  BUDGET  THAT  AUTHORIZES
 DISBURSEMENT  OF FUNDS FROM THE FUND ACCOUNT SHALL INCREASE BY AN AMOUNT
 THAT IS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO SUPPORT  SUCH  DISBURSEMENT  OF
 MONEY  IN  THE FUND ACCOUNT THAT WILL AVOID SUSPENSION OF NEW ENROLLMENT
 FOR THE ENTIRE STATE FISCAL YEAR.
