assisting victims of abduction and sexual exploitation as well as  their
families and the professionals who serve them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  What  began  as  a  small group of bicyclists who hoped to

beacon of hope and resilience in the face of adversity; and

support, genuine friendships, and instilling  a  sense  of  hope  within
these communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  community-affirming  event,  The Mohawk Valley Ride for
Missing Children is a time  to  remember  those  missing  and  exploited
children who have suffered what no child should have to endure; it is an
occasion  for  people to comfort and console one another, and a night to
celebrate those who have survived; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of The Mohawk Valley Ride for Missing  Children
is  in  direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its  volunteers  and
