  CENSUS DATA: The number of members who have transferred or will trans-
 fer  to  PFRS  is  unknown.  The estimates presented herein are based on
 preliminary census data collected as of June 30, 2023. The  census  data
 for  the  potentially  impacted  population  used to develop the average
 costs in this Fiscal Note is based on DEP police officers  currently  in
 NYCERS  who  have  between two and 15 years of service and is summarized
 below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  82
  - Average Age:  35.9
  - Average Service:  8.6
  - Average Salary:  79,400
  Term. Vested Members
  - Number Count:  23
  - Average Age:  39.8
  Term. Non-Vested Members
  - Number Count:  41
  - Average Age:  35.6
 
  BACKGROUND: Currently, NYCERS members employed as DEP police  officers
 who  subsequently  become employed by the State are eligible to transfer
 their NYCERS membership and receive service credit in the  State  plans,
 but  generally  do not receive service credit in the 20-year and 25-year
 PFRS Plans.
  Under the proposed legislation, DEP police officers who served in such
 title for a minimum of two years and then transfer their NYCERS  member-
 ship  to  PFRS within one year of becoming a PFRS member (or one year of
 the effective date, if later) would receive up to 10 years of credit  in
 the 20-year and 25-year PFRS Plans for such equal DEP service.
  Currently,  member  accumulated contributions (with accrued interest),
 and employer paid reserves if the  member  has  at  least  10  years  of
 service,  are  transferred. Under the proposed legislation, NYCERS would
 be required to calculate and pay such member's pension reserve,  net  of
 any  accumulated  salary deductions otherwise transferred, to PFRS, even
 if the member has less than 10 years of service.
 A. 9633  4
 
  It should be noted that the proposed legislation does not provide  for
 a  reciprocal transfer of reserves should a member transfer from PFRS to
 NYCERS with less than 10 years of service.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  For  purposes  of  this  Fiscal  Note,  it  has  been assumed that the
 impacted NYCERS members  would  generally  not  have  transferred  their
 membership to PFRS absent this proposed legislation. It has been further
 assumed that members with more than 15 years of service would not trans-
 fer their membership even under the proposed legislation.
  The  number of members who will benefit in the future from this fiscal
 note is unknown. The cost of this proposed legislation could vary great-
 ly depending on the number of future members who benefit and,  on  their
 plan, length of service, age, and salary history.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 sky  are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of
 Actuaries. We are members of NYCERS but do not believe  it  impairs  our
 objectivity  and  we  meet  the  Qualification Standards of the American
 Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained  herein.
 To  the  best  of  our knowledge, the results contained herein have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and

  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note 2024-29 dated  March  15,
 2024  was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
