BY: Senator BRESLIN
 
  COMMENDING Corporal Robert Dixon posthumously upon
  the  occasion  of  his designation as recipient of a
  Liberty Medal, the highest honor  bestowed  upon  an
  individual by the New York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of the Armed Services from the State of New York,
who have served so  valiantly  and  honorably  in  wars  in  which  this
country's  freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation of peace
in peace-time, deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to  commend  Corporal
Robert  Dixon  upon  the  occasion  of his designation as recipient of a
Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the  New
York  State  Senate;  he was nominated for this prestigious award by the
Reverend Francis A. Kelley Society which diligently works to  honor  and
care for our local everyday heroes and educate the community about their
valorous and sacrificial acts both on and off the battlefield; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Corporal Robert Dixon honorably served  his  country  as  a
member  of  the United States Army at the United States Military Academy
at West Point during World War  II;  he  was  the  last  living  Buffalo
Soldier to have taught the Equestrian Arts Course to Army Cadets; and
 
  WHEREAS, Buffalo Soldiers served their country from 1866-1947; their
duties  included  fighting  in  the  Indian  wars  of  the  late  1800s,
protecting  the  infrastructure  of  the  West,  and  fighting  in  the
Spanish-American War, World War I in France, and World War II during the
Italian Campaign; and
 
  WHEREAS, Buffalo Soldiers fought fiercely and courageously for their
country,  followed  orders  and  completed  their  military  missions
successfully in spite of enduring racism and  discrimination  throughout
their military and community careers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In honor of their meritorious service, the Buffalo Soldiers
Monument  was dedicated at West Point in 2021, and Corporal Robert Dixon
proudly attended this moving event; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon the completion of his military service,  Robert  Dixon
returned  to  New  York State, and devoted himself to the Congregational
Church  in  Salt  Point,  New  York,  (1946-1976)  followed  by  the
Congregational  Church  in  Albany,  New  York,  (1977-2013)  where  he
championed  for  human  and  civil  rights  with  the  church  and  the
community-at-large; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  a  man was killed by Albany police on July 8, 1984,
Reverend Robert Dixon was asked to join with city and community  leaders
to form the first Albany Police/Civilian Review Board to investigate the
 
shooting  and  develop  a plan to restore calm and diffuse civil unrest;
thanks to the work of the Police/Civilian Review Board and the  work  of
church  and  community  leaders,  order  was  restored,  and  unrest was
diffused; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a  result  of  Reverend  Robert  Dixon  and his fellow
leaders' tireless efforts on the  first  Police/Civilian  Review  Board,
three  major  reforms  were  put  into  place  over the years that would
improve relations between the police and the  neighborhoods  in  Albany;
these  included a mobile crisis unit to accompany the police on calls in
which mental illness was suspected or known; the formation of the Center
for Law and Justice which through the years  has  promoted  policies  to
ensure  the  promotion  of  a fair and equitable criminal justice system
devoted to public safety and social  justice;  and  the  adoption  of  a
community  policing system based on collaboration between the police and
the neighborhoods that make up Albany; and
 
  WHEREAS, Having exhibited his patriotism both at  home  and  abroad,
Corporal  Robert  Dixon demonstrated his love for his country and merits
forevermore the highest respect of his State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our Nation's veterans deserve to be  recognized,  commended
and thanked by the people of the State of New York for their service and
for their dedication to their communities, their State and their Nation;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Corporal Robert Dixon posthumously  upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation  as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed
upon an individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of Corporal Robert Dixon.
