 applicant's NEW YORK STATE driving history as a rating  or  underwriting

 annual premium due for a policy,  without  first  making  a  good  faith

 used to rate the policy and are listed by the applicant on  the  private

 third-party database. An insurer also shall verify, through a third-par-
 ty database, the NEW YORK STATE driving history of a named  driver  used
 to rate the policy when added during the policy period [and shall verify
 the  driving  history  of  all drivers used to rate the policy at policy
 renewal], unless the NEW YORK STATE driving history  is  unavailable  at
 the  time  of  the  initial  inquiry  due to a temporary website outage,
 service interruption or other circumstances beyond the  control  of  the
 insurer, producer or third-party representative.
