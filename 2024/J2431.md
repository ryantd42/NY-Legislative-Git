  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as TAR Syndrome Awareness Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
months of awareness for significant medical  conditions  with  hopes  of
increasing education as well as finding treatments and cures; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as TAR Syndrome  Awareness
Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Thrombocytopenia-absent  radius  (TAR)  syndrome is a rare
genetic condition characterized by the absence of the  radius  bones  in
the  forearms  and  low  levels  of  platelets  in  the  blood
(thrombocytopenia); and
 
  WHEREAS, Thrombocytopenia prevents normal blood clotting,  resulting
in  easy  bruising  and  frequent  nosebleeds,  with  the  potential for
life-threatening episodes of severe bleeding  in  the  brain  and  other
organs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thrombocytopenia usually appears during infancy and becomes
less  severe  over time, with platelet levels often normalizing in later
childhood and into adulthood; and
 
  WHEREAS, The physical findings and severity  of  TAR  syndrome  vary
among affected individuals and can include skeletal abnormalities of the
arms,  legs,  or  hips,  as  well  as heart defects, kidney defects, and
difficulty digesting milk; and
 
  WHEREAS, Intellectual development is usually  normal  and  long-term
prognosis  is  positive  in  children with TAR who survive the first few
years of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this month, it is important to educate others  about
TAR  syndrome  and  support  those affected with this disorder and their
families,  as  well  as  promote  continued  medical  research  and
advancements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition  of  the  financial,  physical,  and
psychological impact that TAR Syndrome has  on  those  affected,  it  is
incumbent  of  the  citizens  of  the  State  of New York to support the
courageous individuals living and coping  with  the  condition,  and  to
advocate for life-saving treatments and research; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
tireless advocates and healthcare providers who spend so much  of  their
time  and  resources  battling  this syndrome that affects so many; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  2024,  as TAR
Syndrome Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
