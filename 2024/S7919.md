 AN ACT to amend the elder law, in relation to volunteer programs
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 7 of section 203 of the elder law is amended to
 read as follows:
  7.  (A) The director is hereby authorized, within amounts appropriated
 therefor, to make grants-in-aid to retired and senior volunteer programs
 for the engagement of individuals fifty-five years of  age  or  over  to
 serve  as  volunteers  for  the  betterment of their community and them-
 selves. Such volunteer activities may include but shall not  be  limited
 to  assisting  with the preparation of meals at nutrition sites; leading
 activities at child care centers; delivering meals to homebound elderly;
 providing telephone reassurance and/or  friendly  visits  to  the  frail
 elderly;  tutoring  adults  or children; assisting with services for the
 homeless and assisting school districts which request volunteers for the
 purpose of notifying a person in parental  relation  to  any  elementary
 school  pupil  when such pupil is deemed absent from required attendance
 at his or her designated school. The services of these  volunteers  will
 be performed in the community where such individuals reside or in nearby
 communities. Up to ten percent of such grants-in-aid may be expended for
 the  administrative  purposes of such programs, with the approval of the
 office. Such grants shall be for a period  of  twelve  months  or  less,
 shall  not  be  used  to match other state funds, shall not be used as a
 substitute for federal allocations, and shall be made in a manner  which
 does not conflict with federal law, rule or regulation pursuant to title
 II  of  the  United  States  domestic volunteer services act of nineteen
 hundred seventy-three, as amended. Grants may be used to  match  federal
 funds,  but  not  as  a  substitute  for  presently required non-federal
 shares. Each grantee shall file reports at such time and containing such
 information as the office shall require. For the purpose of  administer-
 ing  such  grants-in-aid  the office may make such agreements with other
 public agencies as are deemed necessary.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
