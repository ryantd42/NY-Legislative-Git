  COMMENDING  the  White  Plains Public Library upon
  the occasion of hosting its 50-Year  Celebration  on
  May 4, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend the White Plains Public Library upon the occasion of hosting its
50-Year  Celebration  at its Foundation Gala at the Library on Saturday,
May 4, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the summer of 1974,  the  White  Plains  Public  Library
relocated  from a brick building on Grand Avenue to its current location
at 100  Martine  Avenue,  vacating  a  crowded  structure  with  limited
capacity  to accommodate its broadening number of programs and services;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The expansive facility, which included a study, a  gallery,
an  auditorium,  conference  rooms,  and  space  for displays, was large
enough to accommodate the needs of the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Adapting to continual advancements  in  the  public  sector
throughout  these  five  decades,  the  White  Plains Public Library has
served  its  visitors  competently;  the  culmination  of  generous
philanthropy,  civic  leadership,  governmental support, and exceptional
staff members has provided an unwavering cornerstone  of  the  community
that will endure for future generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the White Plains Public Library is in direct
correlation  to  the  efforts  of its members, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the White Plains Public Library upon the occasion of hosting its
50-Year Celebration on May 4, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the White Plains Public Library.
