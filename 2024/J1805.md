  COMMENDING Spectrum Health and Human Services upon
  the occasion of celebrating its 50th Anniversary
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Spectrum  Health  and  Human  Services  upon  the  occasion  of
celebrating its 50th Anniversary; and
 
  WHEREAS, The mission of Spectrum Health and  Human  Services  is  to
respectfully partner with adults, children, and families as they recover
from  behavioral,  emotional,  or  mental  health  and/or  substance
abuse-related  disorders  by  offering  individualized  and  meaningful
opportunities  of hope, empowerment, and support to achieve self-defined
improvements in their quality of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, For 50  years,  Spectrum  Health  and  Human  Services  has
assisted  individuals in their rehabilitation from mental illness and/or
addiction;  each  year,  thousands  of  people  consult  this  outreach
organization  which  equips its clients to become resilient and increase
their ability to cope with life's challenges successfully; and
 
  WHEREAS, Spectrum Health and Human Services is a Certified Community
Behavioral  Health  Center  (CCBHC)  which  provides  mental  health,
addiction, and crisis services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The assistance Spectrum Health and Human Services provides
includes  treatment  and  rehabilitation  of  psychiatric  disabilities,
psychological  issues,  substance-related  disorders;  mental  health
programs for adults, adolescents, children, and families experiencing  a
significant  disruption  in  function,  emotional  state,  or behavioral
pattern are readily accessible in numerous communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Programs for chemical dependency for adults and adolescents
who have a consequential  impact  on  their  health,  relationships,  or
functioning  are  available;  individuals  who are concerned about loved
ones' use of alcohol or drugs have access to assistance; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the process of developing strategies for their recovery,
these individuals'  need  for  public  support,  medical  care,  special
education,  and  legal  aid is lessened; personal satisfaction, stronger
family units, and a more assured and empowered community are the results
of services of the  highest  quality  that  Spectrum  Health  and  Human
Services provides to its diverse clientele; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend  Spectrum  Health  and  Human  Services  upon  the  occasion  of
celebrating  its  50th  Anniversary,  and to honor its members, past and
present, who have labored so conscientiously to secure and  improve  the
quality of life for the members of the community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Spectrum Health and Human Services.
