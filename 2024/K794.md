BY: M. of A. Levenberg
 
  CONGRATULATING  Irene  Smythe-Bullock  upon  the
  occasion of celebrating her 100th Birthday
 
  WHEREAS, Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and  knowledge
to  the  increasingly  active  roles they play in today's society; their
past contributions and future participation are a  vital  part  of,  and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the custom of this Legislative Body to commemorate
and recognize certain milestones celebrated by citizens  of  this  great
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
congratulate  Irene  Smythe-Bullock  upon  the  occasion  of  her  100th
Birthday on Thursday, January 25, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Irene Wilson, of Peekskill, New York, was born to the  late
Edward  Wilson  and  Julia Thomison in Petersburg, Tennessee, on January
25, 1924; she was the eldest, and is now the only living child,  of  her
parents' union; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When  she  was  21  years  old,  Irene Wilson married John
Buchanan Smythe, moving to Louisville, Kentucky, to start their new life
together; the couple were blessed with  seven  children:  Waymon,  Mary,
Joel  (David),  Barbara,  identical  twin  boys,  Jerry  and  Terry, and
Windell; and
 
  WHEREAS, When Windell was approximately five years old,  the  family
of  nine  moved  to  Shrub  Oak, New York, and subsequently relocated to
Peekskill; after her divorce, Irene Smythe met  Paul  Bullock  whom  she
married  on  July  4, 1965; four years later, her second husband's three
children, Paul, Jr., Evelyn, and Linda, joined the family; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the children grew older and left home to start their own
lives and  families,  Paul  and  Irene  Bullock  continued  using  their
well-honed  skills  as  parents  and embraced foster care in their home;
later, the couple decided to purchase a large parcel of land  in  nearby
Garrison,  New  York;  this  property,  lovingly  dubbed  "The  Garrison
Estate," served as the optimum  place  to  host  family  gatherings  for
birthdays, holidays, and other memorable occasions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Paul  and Irene Bullock worked hard and attended school to
obtain their commercial driver's license  (CDL)  to  drive  semi-trucks,
later  becoming  owner-operators  of  their  own trucks; this occupation
allowed the couple to travel the country together; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1980, along with other members of their family, Paul and
Irene Bullock moved to  Phoenix,  Arizona,  where  the  seasoned  foster
parents  continued  to  care  for  children and work in group homes; the
State of  Arizona  presented  them  with  an  award,  recognizing  their
contributions  and  dedication  to  the  enrichment of foster children's
lives; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  On May 13, 2015, Irene Bullock tragically lost her husband
of almost 50 years; some time after her loss, she returned to  Peekskill
where she resides with her daughter, Mary; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  this  day,  Irene  Smythe-Bullock  is  still  quite
independent; she enjoys shopping at thrift stores,  sewing,  taking  car
trips,  traveling  to  visit  her  great-granddaughter and her family in
Virginia and her grandson and his family in Florida, and  spending  time
with her son, Windell, and her daughter, Linda, who reside in Peekskill;
making  cherished  memories  with  her  great-great-grandchildren is her
favorite pastime; and
 
  WHEREAS, Known for doing all the good that she can for others, Irene
Smythe-Bullock has been dearly cherished; she  will  be  long-remembered
for the joy and happiness she has striven to share with family, friends,
and all those whom she has met during her long, full life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Irene Smythe-Bullock, with her zest for life, has inspired
and enhanced the lives of her family and friends; and
 
  WHEREAS, This exceptional centenarian has experienced the incredible
joys and sorrows characteristic of  and  reserved  for  those  with  the
stamina and courage to savor a full life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Irene Smythe-Bullock has enriched the lives of those around
her  through  her  joyous  and  sincere  love for others and through the
vibrant charm and infinite wisdom which come only  from  a  fullness  of
years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of  this Legislative Body to publicly
recognize those who have reached such a  remarkable  age  and  who  have
witnessed  and  celebrated  the  innovations, cultural developments, and
outstanding achievements of this Nation during the last  century,  while
themselves  contributing  to  the  growth  and  excellence of this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  Irene  Smythe-Bullock upon the occasion of celebrating her
100th Birthday; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Irene Smythe-Bullock.
