 STATUTE OR RULE.

 PAID BY THAT CONSUMER FOR LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GAS THAT IS REMOVED FROM A
 LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GAS TANK BY THE SELLER AND RESOLD.

 PETROLEUM  GAS  CONSUMERS  AND SHALL NOT BE ADDED TO BILLS RENDERED BY A
 COMPANY SELLING LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GAS; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  THIS
 SUBDIVISION  SHALL  NOT LIMIT THE PER-GALLON PRICE CHARGED BY SELLERS OR
