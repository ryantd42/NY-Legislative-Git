 establishing  minimum  qualifications for forensic laboratory directors,
 TECHNICAL LEADERS, AND QUALITY CONTROL MANAGERS and such other personnel
 as the commission may determine to be  necessary  and  appropriate,  and
 approval of forensic laboratories for the performance of specific foren-
 sic  methodologies.  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to preclude
 forensic laboratories from performing research and validation studies on
 new methodologies and technologies which may not yet be approved by  the
 commission at that time.
  (B)  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL EVALUATE AND UPDATE THE SYSTEM OF ACCREDI-
 TATION EVERY FIVE YEARS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN  SCIENCE,  TECHNOLOGY,  OR

 testing, are] TESTING IS performed in accordance with the highest scien-
 tific standards [practicable], INCLUDING COGNITIVE BIAS PROTECTIONS, AND

  [(c)]  (III)  promote  increased  cooperation  and  coordination among
 forensic laboratories and other agencies in the criminal justice system;
  [(d)] (IV) ensure compatibility, to the  extent  consistent  with  the
 provisions  of  this  article  and any other applicable provision of law
 pertaining to privacy  or  restricting  disclosure  or  redisclosure  of
 information,  with  other state and federal forensic laboratories to the
 extent necessary to share and exchange information, data and results  of
 forensic analyses and tests; [and
  (e)]  (V)  set  forth minimum requirements for the quality and mainte-
 nance of equipment; AND

 of the DNA subcommittee established pursuant to subdivision thirteen  of
 this  section. Such subcommittee shall have the sole authority to grant,
 deny, review or modify a DNA forensic laboratory accreditation  pursuant
 to  this  article,  provided  that  such  authority shall be effectuated
 through binding recommendations made by  the  DNA  subcommittee  to  the
 commission.  In the event the commission disagrees with any of the bind-
 ing recommendations of the DNA subcommittee made pursuant to this  arti-
 cle,  the  commission  may  so notify such subcommittee and request such
 subcommittee to reasonably review such binding recommendations. The  DNA
 subcommittee  shall conduct such review and either forward revised bind-
 ing recommendations to the commission  or  indicate,  with  the  reasons
 therefor,  that  following  such review such subcommittee has determined
 that such binding recommendations shall not be revised.
  3.]  (D)  The  program  of  forensic  laboratory  accreditation  shall
 include, at a minimum, the following requirements:
  [(a)]  (I)  an initial laboratory inspection, and routine inspections,
 as necessary, to ensure compliance with accreditation requirements.  THE
 RESULTS  OF  THE  ANNUAL  INSPECTION, AND UNDERLYING DOCUMENTS, SHALL BE
 PUBLISHED ON THE LABORATORY'S WEBSITE;
  [(b)] (II) routine internal and external proficiency  testing  of  all
 laboratory  personnel involved in forensic [analysis] TESTING, including
 blind external proficiency  testing  [if  the  commission,  or  the  DNA
 subcommittee  as  the  case  may be, determines such a blind proficiency
 testing program to be practicable and appropriate. In determining wheth-
 er a blind proficiency testing program is practicable  and  appropriate,
 the  commission,  or  the  DNA  subcommittee  as  the case may be, shall
 consider such factors as accuracy and reliability of laboratory results,
 cost-effectiveness, time, allocation of resources, and  availability]  .
 THE  PROGRAM OF PROFICIENCY TESTING INCLUDES INITIAL COMPETENCY TESTING.

 INDIVIDUAL FORENSIC ANALYST'S RESULTS, SHALL BE PUBLISHED BY THE LABORA-
 TORY;
  [(c)] (III) PUBLISHED quality control and quality assurance protocols,
 a PUBLISHED method validation procedure  and  a  corrective  action  and
 remedial program;
  [(d)]  (IV)  annual  certification  to  the commission by the forensic
 laboratories of their continued compliance with the requirements of  the
 accreditation  program  [which  certification, in the case of a forensic
 DNA laboratory, shall be forwarded to the DNA subcommittee];
  [(e)] (V) the accreditation of a forensic laboratory may  be  revoked,
 suspended  or  otherwise limited, upon a determination by the commission
 [or, in the case of a forensic DNA laboratory, upon the  binding  recom-
 mendation  of  the DNA subcommittee,] that the laboratory or one or more
 persons in its employ:
  [(i)] (1) is guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining a forensic labo-
 ratory accreditation;
  [(ii)] (2) rendered a report on laboratory work actually performed  in
 another  forensic  laboratory without disclosing the fact that the exam-
 ination or procedure was performed by such other forensic laboratory;

 WORK, TESTIFYING IN ANY CRIMINAL OR  CIVIL  PROCEEDING,  OR  FAILING  TO
 DOCUMENT AND DISCLOSE CHANGES TO CONCLUSIONS OR RESULTS; or
  [(v)] (6) violated in a material respect any provision of this article
 or the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto; and
  [(f)]  (VI)  no  forensic  laboratory  accreditation shall be revoked,
 suspended, or otherwise limited without a hearing. The commission  shall
 serve  written  notice  of  the alleged violation, together with written
 notice of the time and place of  the  hearing,  which  notice  shall  be
 mailed  by  certified  mail  to  the  holder  of the forensic laboratory
 accreditation at the address of such holder  at  least  twenty-one  days
