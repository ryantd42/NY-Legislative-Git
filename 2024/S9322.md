  a.  The corporation is authorized to promulgate regulations, developed
 in consultation with the commissioner and the director of  the  division
 of  the  budget,  for  the  purpose of carrying out its responsibilities
 under this section, including establishing criteria  and  standards  for
 determining  the amount of financial assistance to a municipality for an
 eligible project. To the extent financial assistance to  a  municipality
 for an eligible project is provided as a loan from the proceeds of bonds
 or  notes  of the corporation, the amount of an allocation applicable to
 the portion of such eligible project financed with such loan  shall  be,
 subject to such maximum financial limitations as may otherwise be neces-
 sary and prescribed by the commissioner and the director of the division
 of  the  budget,  thirty-three  and  one-third  percent of the principal
 amount of such loan outstanding at any time for such  eligible  project,
 to  the  extent reasonably practicable, and subject to such deviation as
 may be necessary, in connection with the administration  and  investment
 of  moneys  in  the  fund,  unless  allocations in differing amounts are
 necessary to preclude a determination by the commissioner or the  corpo-

 unless an allocation in a differing amount is required for an innovative
 technology demonstration project; provided, however, that in the case of
 any municipality which has, during the period commencing on June  first,

 tor  of  the  division  of  the  budget,  fifty percent of the principal
 balance outstanding on such loan at any time for such eligible  project,
