  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 22-28, 2024, as Immunization Week in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to  promote  the
health and welfare of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Vaccines  are  one  of the greatest achievements of modern
civilization, preventing the spread of life-threatening diseases and the
deaths of more than two million people each year according to the  World
Health Organization; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  discovery  of vaccines for polio and smallpox changed
the course of world history and allowed for the eradication of  diseases
long thought to be unavoidable and uncontrollable; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Immunization  protects  against  diseases  that  are
historically some of the most virulent killers of  children  under  five
years old, including pneumonia and rotavirus diarrhea; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Vaccines  also  protect  children, adolescents, and adults
against the flu, meningitis, cervical cancer caused by  human  papilloma
virus, liver cancer, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, pertussis,
rubella, tetanus, and other harmful diseases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the  World  Health  Organization, up to 1.5
million children around the world still  die  each  year  from  diseases
which could have been prevented with a simple vaccine; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  has  been a recent outbreak of measles and whooping
cough in different parts of the United States, including  New  York,  in
part due to misinformation regarding the safety and effectiveness of the
vaccinations that prevent these diseases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  should  use  every measure at its
disposal to promote the health of our children and the use  of  vaccines
to accomplish this crucial public health goal; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  22-28,  2024,  as
Immunization Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
