  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS: This proposed legislation would increase
 the annual pension for members who retire for service, ordinary disabil-
 ity, or accidental disability by 1/40th of Final Salary for  each  addi-
 tional  year  of  credited  service,  or  fraction thereof, exceeding 22
 years.  For  the  purposes  of  this  Fiscal Note, Final Salary has been
 interpreted as the member's  pensionable  earnings  in  their  final  12
 months of service.
  This benefit would be subject to the applicable Cost-of-Living Adjust-
 ment or Escalation adjustments.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * The probability of Tier 3 members working beyond 22 years of service
 was  increased  to  recognize  the impact the proposed legislation would
 have on retirement behavior.
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
  This Fiscal Note does not include cost analyses relating to provisions
 contained in Retirement and Social Security Law Section 500(c).
