BY: Senator BORRELLO
 
  COMMEMORATING the 200th Anniversary of the Town of
  Busti to be celebrated on April 16, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  200th  Anniversary  of the Town of Busti in Chautauqua
County, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, This auspicious occasion will be celebrated at a  community
event on Sunday, April 16, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  southwestern  section  of New York State is part of a
vast  section  of  land  claimed  by  Massachusetts  following  the
Revolutionary  War;  Robert  Morris  acquired  it  in  1791  and,  after
settlement with the Native Americans in 1797, sold  it  to  the  Holland
Land  Company, which was led by Paul Busti, for whom the Town was named;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on October 17, 1749, in Milan, Italy, Paul Busti  died
in July of 1824, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is known that tribes of both the Erie and Seneca Indians
were  very  early inhabitants of the area, and John L. Frank is reported
to be the first white settler  in  1808  on  lot  61,  although  records
indicate that he didn't purchase land until 1812; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first  road opened in the southern part of the county
was cut through the forest by Robert Miles between  1802  and  1804  and
started by the Conewango at Pine Grove to Shadyside (Lakewood) and ended
at a place on Chautauqua Lake known as Miles Landing; and
 
  WHEREAS, One of the first industries in Busti was a tannery built by
John  Frank around 1812 at what was called the Frank settlement, and the
first blacksmith was Patrick Cambell, who operated his shop there; and
 
  WHEREAS, A short time later, Giles Chipman and Lyman Fargo opened  a
shop  nearby  where  they  installed a trip hammer and manufactured edge
tools;  other  early  industries  were  established  by  Deacon  Samuel
Garfield,  Herman Bush, Uriah Haws, Samuel Chappel, James Startwell, and
Francis Soule; and
 
  WHEREAS, Perhaps the most well-known inhabitants of Busti  were  the
Stonemans;  George  Stoneman  came  to  Busti in 1810, married Katherine
Cheney, and had eight children; his oldest son George became one of  the
great  cavalry  leaders  of  the  Civil  War,  and  in 1871, he moved to
California and became governor of the state years later; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kate Stoneman, another one of George's  children,  was  the
first  woman  to pass the New York State bar exams and to be admitted to
law practice in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Underground Railroad had one of its most active routes
through this region and it crossed the  state  line  at  or  near  Sugar
Grove,  passed  through Busti and Jamestown and then across Lake Erie to
Buffalo and on to the "railroad's" terminal in Canada; there was also  a
station where Sunset Hill Cemetery is now located; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The first school, a one-room log cabin, was built in 1813,
and was located at Fairmount and Winch Roads; the  present  Southwestern
Central School was built and ready for use in 1954; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Baptist  Church  of Busti was organized on August 30,
1819, and the first Baptist house of worship  was  built  in  1836,  and
another  one  was  erected in 1853; the first Methodist Episcopal Church
was organized under the direction of Reverend  Alvin  Burgess  in  about
1819, with approximately 60 members; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Busti  was  also an early leader in agriculture; the first
official test conducted on cows in Chautauqua  County  and  one  of  the
first in New York State, was made on the farm of Herbert Ayres, who also
raised the first field of alfalfa in the county; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Incorporated  on  May  9,  1893, Lakewood, which is in the
northern end of the town of  Busti,  began  with  the  consolidation  of
several  farms all originally from the Holland Land Company; the village
extends along the shores of Chautauqua Lake about three miles; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  development  of  Lakewood,  however,  began  with  the
building  of  the  Cowing  House by John T. Cowing in 1870; it was later
enlarged and called the Lake  View  House;  over  time,  it  became  the
Sterlingworth Inn and later still, the Waldemere; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  fruitful  over  the  ebb and flow of decades of
growth and change, the Town of  Busti,  under  the  able  leadership  of
Supervisor  Jesse  M. Robbins, continues its commitment to enhancing the
quality  of  life  of  its  citizens,  ensuring  a  positive  business,
institutional  and  educational  climate,  and  providing  all essential
services; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 200th Anniversary of the Town of Busti, recognizing the
significance of the role it  continues  to  play  in  the  life  of  the
community of the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Jesse M. Robbins, Supervisor, Town of Busti.
