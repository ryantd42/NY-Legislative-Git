 Introduced by Sens. PARKER, MAYER -- read twice and ordered printed, and
  when printed to be committed to the Committee on Codes
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the penal law and the civil rights law, in relation to
  enacting the reproductive health care facilities access act
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "reproductive health care facilities access act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The  legislature  finds  that  the  right  to
 obtain  reproductive  health  services  is  an  essential personal right
 protected by state and federal law.  Equally,  the  right  to  peaceably
 protest  and  express one's views is protected by state and federal law.
 Such actions include, but are not limited to, the right to speak, march,
 demonstrate, or engage in other activity protected by the  First  Amend-
 ment.
  The  legislature  finds  that  current law does not adequately protect
 reproductive health care facilities  and  those  who  work  in  or  seek
 services from such facilities. Therefore, the legislature has determined
 that  it  is appropriate for the protection of the public health, safety
 and welfare, to enact legislation to prohibit interference  with  access
 to  reproductive  health  care  services, so that persons harmed by such
 conduct can seek redress in the courts and the state can obtain  injunc-
 tive  relief  and  damages.  Furthermore, the legislature has determined
 that it is appropriate to enact this legislation to: ensure public safe-
 ty and order; protect freedom to receive reproductive  health  services;
 advance medical privacy and the well-being of patients seeking reproduc-
 tive health care services at facilities; and safeguard private property.
  §  3.  Section 240.70 of the penal law, as added by chapter 635 of the
 laws of 1999, is amended to read as follows:
 § 240.70 Criminal interference with health care  services  or  religious
  worship in the second degree.
  1.  A  person  is  guilty  of  criminal  interference with health CARE
 services or religious worship in the second degree when:
