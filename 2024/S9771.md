 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic  law,  in  relation  to  special
  license plates for vehicles owned or used by people with disabilities
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 2 of section 404-a of the vehicle  and  traffic
 law,  as  amended by chapter 191 of the laws of 1991, is amended to read
 as follows:
  2. Registration  of  vehicles  owned  OR  USED  by  severely  disabled
 persons. The commissioner shall assign to such motor vehicles, including
 any van or pick-up truck used for transporting persons with disabilities
 OR  ANY  SPECIALIZED  VEHICLE,  AS DEFINED BY PARAGRAPH B OF SUBDIVISION
 SIXTEEN OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE, which is  not  used
 for commercial purposes, owned by such persons, OR THE PARENTS OR GUARD-
 IANS OF SUCH PERSONS, a distinctive number and issue and deliver in such
 manner  as  the  commissioner may select to the owner a certification of
 registration, in such form as the commissioner shall prescribe  and  two
 number  plates,  called  disabled  person  plates.  Said disabled person
 plates shall conform to the requirements of section four hundred one  of
 this  [chapter] ARTICLE, but shall bear distinctive marks to distinguish
 them from number plates to be issued to other persons, qualifying  under
 this chapter. The commissioner, in [his] SUCH COMMISSIONER'S discretion,
 may  issue,  for  any  registration  year, only one plate as a set for a
 motor vehicle, in which event a set of  disabled  person  plates  for  a
 motor  vehicle  shall  consist  of  one plate. Where a severely disabled
 person, OR BY THE PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF SUCH PERSONS, owns  more  than
 one  vehicle  and  such  vehicle  or vehicles is or are used by severely
 disabled members of the owner's family who reside with  the  owner,  the
 commissioner  shall  issue one set of plates for each additional vehicle
 OWNED OR used by such severely disabled person, OR  BY  THE  PARENTS  OR
 GUARDIANS  OF  SUCH  PERSONS,  provided  that such OWNER OR user, OR THE
 CHILD OF SUCH OWNER OR USER, qualifies as a severely disabled person  in
 the manner required by this section.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
