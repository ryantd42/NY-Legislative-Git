 firm  to  conduct  a comprehensive study analyzing the office for people
 with developmental disabilities, the number of New York state  residents

 years and who completed the office for people with  developmental  disa-

  (v) the number of persons with a developmental disability who appealed
 their  ineligibility determination and ultimately received services from
 the office for people with developmental disabilities;
  (vi) an analysis of eligibility requirements,  services  determination
 process,  and any other processes deemed necessary for review within the

 regionally to assist in targeting the areas that are most underserved.

 bilities shall promulgate rules and regulations as may be  necessary  to
 effectuate the provisions of this section.
