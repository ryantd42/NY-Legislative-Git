 S. 9860  2
 
 For the purpose of this paragraph, "home care services" shall  have  the
 same meaning as defined in subdivision one of section thirty-six hundred
 two  of  the public health law. The prospective insured, or [his or her]
 THEIR representative, shall acknowledge that the required disclosure has
 been  made by signing the disclosure statement prior to or contemporane-
 ously with the effective date of the policy or certificate[.
 Failure to provide information required  by  subparagraph  (D)  of  this
 paragraph  shall not be construed as a violation of this section if such
 information has not been made available by the department  of  health.];
 AND
  (7)  (A)  THE PLAN SHALL INCLUDE A PROVISION AUTHORIZING THE INSURED'S
 SPOUSE, IF NOT LEGALLY SEPARATED FROM THE INSURED, OR  DOMESTIC  PARTNER
 TO INVOKE INSURANCE COVERAGE BY THE PLAN WHERE THE INSURED DID NOT PROP-
 ERLY  EXECUTE  A  POWER  OF ATTORNEY ALLOWING FOR THE INVOCATION OF SUCH
 PLAN'S COVERAGE;
  (B) SUCH PROVISION SHALL PROVIDE THAT THE SPOUSE OR DOMESTIC PARTNER'S
 AUTHORITY SHALL COMMENCE UPON A DETERMINATION, MADE PURSUANT TO  SECTION
 TWENTY-NINE  HUNDRED  NINETY-FOUR-C  OF  THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW, THAT THE
 INSURED LACKS DECISION-MAKING CAPACITY. IN THE EVENT AN ATTENDING PHYSI-
 CIAN OR NURSE PRACTITIONER DETERMINES  THAT  THE  INSURED  HAS  REGAINED
 DECISION-MAKING  CAPACITY, THE AUTHORITY OF THE SPOUSE OR DOMESTIC PART-
 NER SHALL CEASE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law and shall apply to health insurance plans for
 long term care issued or renewed on or after such date.
