  WHEREAS, The Sugar maple tree was adopted as the State tree in 1956,

  WHEREAS, Pure maple syrup is a natural and nutritious sweetener  and
is  a  smart  choice as a topping or as a flavorful ingredient in baking

  WHEREAS, New York State is ranked second in maple  syrup  production
in  the  United  States,  and  is  the first crop to be harvested in the

the sap for production of maple candy and syrup; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, New York State is home to the largest resource
of  tappable  maple trees within the United States, and over 2,000 maple
sugar makers; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State's maple industry hit  a  74-year  record  in
2018  with the production of 806,000 gallons of maple syrup, compared to
760,000 in 2017, with a growth of nearly 50  percent  in  the  last  six
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, The estimated value of the maple syrup produced in New York
State is $31,320,000; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional natural resource and its contributions  to
the local and State economies; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2023,  as  Pure  New
