  2.  THE DISTINCTIVE PLATE AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE
 ISSUED UPON PROOF, SATISFACTORY TO THE COMMISSIONER, THAT THE  APPLICANT
 IS A MEMBER OF THE RED KNIGHTS INTERNATIONAL MOTORCYCLE CLUB.
  3. A DISTINCTIVE PLATE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE ISSUED

 received  prior  to  plate  design, production and issuance at least two
 hundred orders for such distinctive plate together with  the  additional
 annual  service  charge  applicable  to  each such order, which shall be
 non-refundable,  no  such  surety  bond  shall  be required. All service
 charges collected pursuant to this section shall be  deposited  pursuant
 to  the  provisions  of section 404-oo of the vehicle and traffic law to

  2.  If, upon the expiration of two years following the date upon which
 distinctive plates in the  series  are  first  available  for  sale  two
 hundred  or more sets of such plates are sold, a bond delivered pursuant
 to this section shall be discontinued. If fewer than two hundred sets of
 such plates are sold by such time,  the  department  of  motor  vehicles
 shall be entitled to recover against the bond in an amount proportionate
 to such shortfall.
  §  3.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 section one of this act shall take effect on the one  hundred  eightieth
