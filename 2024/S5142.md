  Section 1. Section 801-a of the education law, as amended  by  chapter

  § 801-a. Instruction in civility, citizenship and character education.
 The  regents  shall  ensure  that  the  course  of instruction in grades
 kindergarten through twelve includes a component on  civility,  citizen-
 ship  and character education. Such component shall instruct students on
 the principles of honesty, tolerance, personal  responsibility,  respect
 for  others, with an emphasis on discouraging acts of harassment, bully-
 ing, discrimination, observance of laws and rules, courtesy, dignity and
 other traits which will enhance the quality of their experiences in, and
 contributions to, the community. Such component shall  include  instruc-
 tion  of  safe,  responsible use of the internet and electronic communi-
 cations. The regents shall determine how to incorporate  such  component
 in  existing  curricula  and the commissioner shall promulgate any regu-
 lations needed to carry out such determination of the regents.  For  the
 purposes  of  this section FOR COURSES OF INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
 "tolerance," "respect for others" and "dignity" shall include  awareness
 and  sensitivity to harassment, bullying, discrimination and civility in
 the relations of people of different races, weights,  national  origins,
 ethnic groups, religions, religious practices, mental or physical abili-
 ties, sexual orientations, genders, and sexes.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
