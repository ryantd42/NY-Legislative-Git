 Introduced  by  Sens. COONEY, HINCHEY, MARTINEZ, SEPULVEDA -- read twice
  and ordered printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee
  on Transportation
 
 AN ACT to amend the transportation law and the vehicle and traffic  law,
  in relation to stretch limousines
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subparagraph (i) of paragraph b of subdivision 9 of section
 140 of the transportation law, as amended by section  4  of  part  K  of
 chapter 58 of the laws of 2024, is amended to read as follows:
  (i)  Whenever  an  altered  motor  vehicle  commonly  referred to as a
 "stretch limousine" has failed an inspection and been placed out-of-ser-
 vice, the commissioner may direct a police  officer  or  agent  of  such
 commissioner  to  immediately  secure possession of the number plates of
 such vehicle and return the same to the commissioner of motor  vehicles.
 The commissioner shall notify the commissioner of motor vehicles to that
 effect,  and  the commissioner of motor vehicles shall thereupon suspend
 the registration of such vehicle until such  time  as  the  commissioner
 gives  notice  that  the  out-of-service  defect has been satisfactorily
 adjusted. Provided, however, that the commissioner shall give notice and
 an opportunity to be heard within not  more  than  thirty  days  of  the
 suspension.  Failure  of  the  holder  or  of any person possessing such
 plates to deliver to the commissioner or agent of such commissioner  who
 requests the same pursuant to this paragraph shall be a misdemeanor. The
 commissioner of motor vehicles shall have the authority to deny a regis-
 tration  or renewal application to any other person for the same vehicle
 where it has been determined that such registrant's intent has  been  to
 evade the purposes of this paragraph and where the commissioner of motor
 vehicles  has  reasonable  grounds  to believe that such registration or
 renewal will have the effect of defeating the  purposes  of  this  para-
 graph.  The procedure on any such suspension shall be the same as in the
 case of a suspension under the vehicle and traffic law.  OPERATING  SUCH
 MOTOR  VEHICLE  WHILE  UNDER  SUSPENSION AS PROVIDED IN THIS SUBDIVISION
 SHALL BE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF NOT LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS  AND
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 ASSESSED  TO THE HOLDER OR OF ANY PERSON POSSESSING SUCH PLATES FOR EACH
 OFFENSE COMMITTED, IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER FINES, PENALTIES OR  ACTIONS
 TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO SUCH CONDUCT.
  §  2.  The  vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a new section
 511-e to read as follows:
  § 511-E. SEIZURE AND REDEMPTION  OF  UNLAWFULLY  OPERATED  AND  UNSAFE
 COMMERCIAL  MOTOR  VEHICLES. 1. UPON DETERMINING THAT A COMMERCIAL MOTOR
 VEHICLE IS OPERATING WITH AN OUT-OF-SERVICE DEFECT THAT  IS  OF  A  TYPE
 WHERE  PURSUANT  TO  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF TRANSPORTATION'S REGULATIONS NO
 INSPECTION WOULD BE ISSUED UNTIL THE DEFECT IS REPAIRED AND A RE-INSPEC-
 TION IS CONDUCTED, OR IS RELATED TO ITS HORN, AND AN OFFICER, IN CONSUL-
 TATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, DETERMINES  THAT  ALLOWING
 THE  COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE TO CONTINUE OPERATING WOULD BE CONTRARY TO
 PUBLIC SAFETY, SUCH OFFICER MAY REMOVE OR ARRANGE FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE
 VEHICLE TO A GARAGE, AUTOMOBILE POUND, OR OTHER PLACE OF SAFETY WHERE IT
 SHALL REMAIN IMPOUNDED, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS  SECTION.  THE
 VEHICLE  SHALL BE ENTERED INTO THE NEW YORK STATEWIDE POLICE INFORMATION
 NETWORK AS AN IMPOUNDED VEHICLE AND  THE  IMPOUNDING  POLICE  DEPARTMENT
 SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY THE OWNER AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY THAT THE VEHICLE
 HAS BEEN IMPOUNDED.
  2.  A COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE SO IMPOUNDED SHALL BE IN THE CUSTODY OF
 THE LOCAL AUTHORITY AND SHALL NOT BE RELEASED UNLESS:
  (A) THE PERSON WHO REDEEMS IT HAS FURNISHED SATISFACTORY  EVIDENCE  OF
 REGISTRATION AND FINANCIAL SECURITY;
  (B)  PAYMENT  HAS  BEEN  MADE  FOR THE REASONABLE COSTS OF REMOVAL AND
 STORAGE OF THE COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE. THE  REGISTERED  OWNER  OF  THE
 VEHICLE SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH PAYMENT PROVIDED. PAYMENT PRIOR TO
 RELEASE OF THE VEHICLE SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED IN CASES WHERE THE IMPOUND-
 ED  VEHICLE  WAS  STOLEN  OR  WAS RENTED OR LEASED PURSUANT TO A WRITTEN
 AGREEMENT FOR A PERIOD OF THIRTY DAYS OR LESS, HOWEVER THE MOTOR CARRIER
 WHO WAS OPERATING SUCH VEHICLE SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF  REMOVAL
 AND STORAGE OF THE VEHICLE TO ANY ENTITY RENDERING SUCH SERVICE.
  (C) WHERE THE COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE WAS OPERATED BY A PERSON WHO AT
 THE TIME OF THE OFFENSE WAS THE OWNER THEREOF, (I) SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE
 THAT  THE REGISTERED OWNER OR OTHER PERSON SEEKING TO REDEEM THE VEHICLE
 HAS A LICENSE OR PRIVILEGE TO OPERATE A MOTOR VEHICLE IN THIS STATE, AND
 (II)(A) SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE THAT THE OUT-OF-SERVICE DEFECT OR  DEFECTS
 FORMING  THE BASIS FOR SUCH SEIZURE OR IMPOUNDMENT HAVE BEEN REPAIRED OR
 THE REGISTERED OWNER HAS PROVIDED SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE THAT THE VEHICLE
 WILL BE PERMANENTLY TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE, OR (B) A CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY
 THE COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL IN WHICH  THE  SEIZURE  ACTION  WAS
 COMMENCED  ORDERING  RELEASE  OF  THE  VEHICLE  PRIOR TO THE JUDGMENT OR
 COMPLIANCE THEREWITH IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE, OR  (C)  A  CERTIFICATE
 ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER OFFICER AUTHORIZED
 TO  ENFORCE  COMPLIANCE WITH REMEDYING OUT-OF-SERVICE DEFECTS HAS WAIVED
 THE AUTHORIZATION TO HOLD THE VEHICLE AFTER FINDING  THAT  SUCH  RELEASE
 WOULD NOT BE CONTRARY TO PUBLIC SAFETY.
  3.  WHEN  A  COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE SEIZED AND IMPOUNDED PURSUANT TO
 THIS SECTION HAS BEEN IN THE CUSTODY OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY  FOR  THIRTY
 DAYS,  SUCH AUTHORITY SHALL MAKE INQUIRY IN THE MANNER PRESCRIBED BY THE

 TURE AND TO RECOVER TOWING AND STORAGE COSTS, IF ANY, TO THE EXTENT SUCH
 COSTS  EXCEED THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE VEHICLE MAY BE BROUGHT BY THE
 LOCAL AUTHORITY IN THE COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE  TRIBUNAL  IN  WHICH  THE
 CIVIL  OR CRIMINAL ACTION WAS COMMENCED BY PETITION FOR AN ORDER DECREE-
 ING FORFEITURE OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE, ACCOMPANIED BY AN AFFIDAVIT ATTEST-
 ING TO FACTS SHOWING THAT FORFEITURE IS WARRANTED. IF THE  IDENTITY  AND
 ADDRESS  OF THE OWNER AND/OR LIENHOLDER IS KNOWN TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITY,
 TEN DAYS' NOTICE SHALL BE GIVEN TO SUCH PARTY, WHO SHALL HAVE AN  OPPOR-
 TUNITY  TO  APPEAR  AND  BE  HEARD  PRIOR TO ENTRY OF AN ORDER DECREEING
 FORFEITURE. WHERE THE COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL IS SATISFIED THAT
