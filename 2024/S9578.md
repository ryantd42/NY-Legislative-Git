 justice services, the superintendent of state police,  the  commissioner
 of  education,  and the chair of the commission on forensic science. The
 department of  health  may  also  consult  with  qualified  professional

 successful completion  of  any  such  courses  by  [a]  THE  coroner  or
 coroner's deputy and may prescribe heightened levels of training for any
 newly elected or appointed coroner or coroner's deputy.

 ITED  PURSUANT  TO  RULES  PROMULGATED  BY  THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, IN
