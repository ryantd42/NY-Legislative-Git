  § 8. Section 265.09 of the penal law, as amended by chapter 650 of the

 2013, is amended to read as follows:
 § 265.09 Criminal use of a firearm in the first degree.
  (1) A person is guilty of criminal use  of  a  firearm  in  the  first
 degree  when [he] SUCH PERSON commits any class B violent felony offense
 as defined in paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 70.02 OF  THIS
 CHAPTER and [he] SUCH PERSON either:
  (a)  possesses  a deadly weapon, if the weapon is a loaded weapon from
 which a shot, readily capable of producing death or other serious injury
 may be discharged; or
  (b) displays what appears to be a pistol,  revolver,  rifle,  shotgun,
 machine gun or other firearm.
  Criminal use of a firearm in the first degree is a class [B] A-I felo-
 ny.
  (2)  Sentencing.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law to the
 contrary, when a person is convicted of criminal use of a firearm in the
 first degree as defined in subdivision one of this  section,  the  court
 shall  impose  an  additional  consecutive sentence of five years to the
 sentence imposed on the underlying class B violent felony offense  where
 the person convicted of such crime displays a loaded weapon from which a
 shot,  readily capable of producing death or other serious injury may be
 discharged, in furtherance of the commission of  such  crime,  provided,
 however,  that  such  additional  sentence  shall  not be imposed if the
 court, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and to
 the history and character of the defendant, finds  on  the  record  that
 such  additional consecutive sentence would be unduly harsh and that not
 imposing such sentence would be consistent with the  public  safety  and
 would  not  deprecate  the seriousness of the crime. Notwithstanding any
 other provision of law to the contrary, the aggregate of the  five  year
 consecutive  term  imposed  pursuant to this subdivision and the minimum
 term of the indeterminate sentence imposed on  the  underlying  class  B
 violent felony shall constitute the new aggregate minimum term of impri-
 sonment,  and  a  person subject to such term shall be required to serve
 the entire aggregate minimum term and shall not be eligible for  release
 on  parole  or  conditional  release  during such term. This subdivision
 shall not apply where the defendant's criminal liability for  displaying
 a loaded weapon from which a shot, readily capable of producing death or
 other serious injury may be discharged, in furtherance of the commission
 of crime is based on the conduct of another pursuant to section 20.00 of
 this chapter.
  §  9. The second undesignated paragraph of section 265.19 of the penal
 law, as added by chapter 1 of the laws of 2013, is amended  to  read  as
