BY: M. of A. Hawley
 
  RECOGNIZING  the  Jell-O  Gallery Museum in LeRoy,
  New York, upon the occasion of  its  celebration  of
  Jell-O Week on February 12-18, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body that the quality
of life of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched  by
its exceptional cultural, educational and recreational institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize  the  Jell-O  Gallery  Museum  in  LeRoy,  New  York, upon the
occasion of its celebration of Jell-O Week on February 12-18, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Officially declared in 2001, the second week of February is
National Jell-O Week and is celebrated by various communities throughout
the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jell-O, as it was  originally  called,  has  existed  as  a
product since 1897, when a carpenter from Le Roy, New York, named Pearle
Wait experimented with gelatin and came up with a fruit flavored dessert
which his wife, May, named Jell-O; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1899, Jell-O was sold to Orator Francis Woodward, whose
Genesee Pure Food Company produced the successful Grain-O health  drink;
succeeding  years  saw  Jell-O change from a hand-packaged business to a
highly  mechanized  factory,  and  one  of  Le  Roy's  most  important
industries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  December  31, 1925, the Jell-O Company was sold to the
Postum Cereal Company, Inc., thereby becoming the first subsidiary of  a
large merger that would eventually become General Foods Corporation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first  four  Jell-O  flavors  were  orange,  lemon,
strawberry and raspberry, with lime introduced in 1930; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Jell-O Company left its hometown of LeRoy in 1964,  yet
remains a vital component of the town's distinguished history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the  Jell-O  Gallery  Museum, located on East Main
Street, displays the company's original advertising art, molds,  spoons,
toys, collectibles, and recipe books; and
 
  WHEREAS, Known as America's Most Famous Dessert, the Jell-O brand is
currently  owned  by  Kraft/General  Foods in Dover, Delaware, and sells
more than 300 million boxes each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, The dedicated staff of the Jell-O Gallery Museum,  are  and
always have been characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence,  and
accordingly merit the commendation of this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
applaud  the  leaders  of  commerce  and  industry whose accomplishments
 
contribute to the economic health and prosperity of the  communities  of
the  State  of  New  York and to the quality of life of its people; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative  Body  pause in its deliberations
recognize the Jell-O  Gallery  Museum  in  LeRoy,  New  York,  upon  the
occasion  of its celebration of Jell-O Week on February 12-18, 2024; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Jell-O Gallery Museum in LeRoy, New York.
