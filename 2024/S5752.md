 AN ACT directing the commissioner of education for the state of New York
  to revamp the structure of school  districts  statewide  creating  one
  school  district  per  county; and to repeal certain provisions of the
  education law relating thereto
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and declaration. The legislature
 hereby finds and declares that New York  state  spends  more  money  per
 student  than  any  other state in the nation, but ranks thirty-ninth in
 high school graduation rates. Only seventy-three percent of  New  York's
 students  graduate  from  high  school and only thirty-seven percent are
 college ready. The legislature finds that  New  York  students  are  not
 adequately  prepared  to  compete in the global economy and that changes
 must be made to the education system in order to reverse  these  statis-
 tics and prepare students to compete in the global economy. The legisla-
 ture  also  finds  and  declares that New York has struggled for several
 decades with the ongoing process of  reorganizing  our  school  district
 system  in  a  way  that  provides a solution to the negative effects of
 declining school enrollment, broadens the scope  of  program  offerings,
 facilitates  optimum class scheduling, increases professional resources,
 and alleviates heavy tax burdens. The legislature therefore directs  the
 commissioner of education to reorganize the school districts in a manner
 that  adequately  addresses  the  shortcomings  of the current education
 system and prepares each and every student to excel  in  today's  global
 economy.
  §  2.  The  commissioner of the New York state department of education
 shall establish and implement a new  school  district  system  statewide
 consisting  of  one  school  district  per county in each of the state's
 sixty-two counties.  The  resulting  sixty-two  school  districts  shall

 service  only  the needs of students residing in such county.  Provided,
 however, that any school district located in a city with a population of
 one million or more shall be exempt from the provisions of this act.
  § 3. Within one year of the effective date of this act the commission-
 er  of  the New York state department of education shall submit a report
 proposing implementing legislation to effect and fund the  consolidation
 of  school  districts  as  proposed  in  this  act. Such report shall be
 provided to the governor, the speaker of  the  assembly,  the  temporary
 president of the senate, the assembly minority leader, the senate minor-
 ity  leader  and  the chairpersons and ranking members of the senate and
 assembly committees on education.
  § 4. Article 33 of title II of the education law is REPEALED.
  § 5. Article 35 of title II of the education law is REPEALED.
  § 6. Article 37 of title II of the education law is REPEALED.
  § 7. Article 39 of title II of the education law is REPEALED.
  § 8. Article 51 of title II of the education law is REPEALED.
  § 9. Article 52 of title II of the education law is REPEALED.
  § 10. Article 53 of title II of the education law is REPEALED.
