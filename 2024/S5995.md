 Introduced  by  Sen.  LANZA  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Insurance
 
 AN ACT  to  amend  the  insurance  law,  in  relation  to  enacting  the
  "construction insurance transparency act of 2023" requiring all insur-
  ers  which  issue  policies  of  liability  insurance insuring against
  claims made in reliance upon the duty imposed by the "scaffold law" to
  file annual financial statements and  detailed  claim  data  with  the
  superintendent of financial services
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This  act  shall  be  known  and  may  be  cited  as  the
 "construction insurance transparency act of 2023".
  §  2.  Declarations  of  legislative  findings. The legislature hereby
 finds and declares that persons,  corporations,  associations  or  other
 business  entities  which issue policies of liability insurance insuring
 an owner of real property or a contractor who  is  performing  work  and
 services  on  real  property  against  claims  made in reliance upon the
 duties imposed upon such parties  by  section  240  of  the  labor  law,
 commonly  referred  to  as  the "scaffold law", owe an obligation to the
 public, to those they insure and to those  who  may  in  the  future  be
 insured  by  them,  to fully disclose in a public and transparent manner
 all elements relating to the premiums paid for such insurance, the meth-
 od and manner in which such premiums are  determined  and  imposed  upon
 insureds,  and  claims  made  by  injured persons who rely on owners and
 contractors to provide a safe and secure worksite as  required  in  such
 section  of  such  law. It is essential that the public be made aware of
 such an insurer's responsibility  to  inform  them  of  their  financial
 condition and solvency, and the details and specifics of the factors and
 circumstances behind its financial solvency as well as the basis for the
 rates they charge to owners and contractors to obtain such coverage. The
 determination  of  premiums  for such liability insurance policy in this
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 state has, unfortunately, gone on too long in obscurity, with even those
 who bear the cost of premiums unable to learn why prices are set as they
 are. As a matter of public trust, liability insurers should be  required
 to make the public aware of the pertinent facts related to their premium
 determinations  and  financial  solvency by disclosing all the pertinent
 facts as provided for in this section. It is the further  sense  of  the
 legislature  that  this  data  should be disclosed in an open and public
 manner, and should be made available without undue cost and delay.
  § 3. The insurance law is amended by adding a new section 346 to  read
 as follows:
  §  346.  FINANCIAL  STATEMENT AND DETAILED CLAIM DATA TO BE FILED WITH
 THE SUPERINTENDENT. (A) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM "INSURER"
 SHALL MEAN ANY PERSON, CORPORATION, ASSOCIATION OR OTHER BUSINESS ENTITY
 WHICH ISSUES A POLICY OF LIABILITY INSURANCE INSURING  A  CONTRACTOR  OR
 OWNER  OF  REAL PROPERTY LOCATED IN THIS STATE AGAINST CLAIMS MADE BY AN
 INJURED WORKER, THE CLAIM FOR WHICH IS MADE IN RELIANCE  UPON  THE  DUTY
 OWED  TO  SUCH  WORKER PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED
 FORTY OF THE LABOR LAW.
  (B) ON OR BEFORE APRIL FIRST OF EACH YEAR, EVERY INSURER SHALL FOR THE
 PRIOR CALENDAR YEAR PROVIDE THE SUPERINTENDENT AND  THE  PUBLIC  WITH  A

 ER'S PROVISION OF LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO OWNERS OF REAL PROPER-
 TY OR CONTRACTORS PERFORMING SERVICES TO OWNERS  OF  REAL  PROPERTY  FOR

 INITIAL  FINANCIAL  STATEMENT SO FILED BY AN INSURER AFTER THE EFFECTIVE
 DATE OF THIS SECTION SHALL INCLUDE  THE  INFORMATION  REQUIRED  IN  THIS

 COST TO THE INSURER TO PROVIDE SUCH COVERAGE  AS  PART  OF  A  LIABILITY
 INSURANCE  POLICY;  (13) INVESTMENT INCOME REALIZED FROM THAT PORTION OF
 THE PREMIUM PAID FOR A POLICY PROVIDING SUCH COVERAGE; (14)  THE  AMOUNT
 OF EXPOSURE TO THE INSURER RESULTING FROM THE PROVISION OF SUCH COVERAGE

 INSURED  TO  PURCHASE FURTHER COVERAGE FROM AN OUT OF STATE EXCESS LINES
 PROVIDER, BASED UPON CURRENT DATA AVAILABLE TO SUCH  IN-STATE  PROVIDER,

 ESPECIALLY  WHERE  SUCH  IN-STATE  PROVIDER  OPERATES  AS AN EXCESS LINE
