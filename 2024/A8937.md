 Introduced  by M. of A. BRONSON -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Labor
 
 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to the convening of  a  human
  services employee wage board
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The labor law is amended by adding a new  article  19-E  to
 read as follows:
 
  ARTICLE 19-E
  HUMAN SERVICES EMPLOYEES
 
 SECTION 697. STATEMENT OF PUBLIC POLICY.
  697-A. DEFINITIONS.
  697-B. HUMAN SERVICES EMPLOYEE WAGE BOARD.
  §  697.  STATEMENT  OF PUBLIC POLICY. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS AND
 DECLARES THAT THERE ARE PERSONS EMPLOYED BY HUMAN SERVICES PROVIDERS  IN
 THE  STATE OF NEW YORK AT WAGES INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE MAINTE-
 NANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES.
  HUMAN SERVICES WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL  TO  THE  STATE  AND  LOCALITIES'
 ABILITY  TO ASSIST NEW YORKERS CONFRONTING A RANGE OF SOCIAL CHALLENGES.
 TO  ACHIEVE  COST  SAVINGS,  GOVERNMENT  HAS  TRANSFERRED  MOST  LEGALLY
 MANDATED  HUMAN  SERVICES FOR NEW YORKERS TO NONPROFITS AND IN TURN HAVE
 CREATED MASSIVE PAY DISPARITIES WITHIN THE FIELD. GOVERNMENT IS NOT JUST
 THE PREDOMINANT FUNDER OF HUMAN SERVICES IN NEW YORK,  IT  IS  ALSO  THE
 MAIN  DRIVER OF HUMAN SERVICES SALARIES AS IT DIRECTLY SETS SALARY RATES
 ON CONTRACTS OR DOES SO INDIRECTLY BY ESTABLISHING COSTS FOR A  UNIT  OR
 SERVICE, ALONG WITH REQUIRED STAFFING ON A CONTRACT.
  NONPROFITS  CONTRACTED TO PROVIDE HUMAN SERVICES ARE NOT ONLY PROVIDED
 INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES, BUT ARE  MET  WITH  CHRONIC
 DELAYS  IN PAYMENT, UNDERFUNDING, AND A LACK OF SINCERE COLLABORATION TO
 CREATE MEANINGFUL AND LASTING INTERVENTIONS. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND  EIGHT
 AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN, THE STATE CUT HUMAN SERVICES FUNDING BY TWEN-
 TY-SIX  PERCENT,  WITH  LOWER RATES NOW THAN IN NINETEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 THESE CONTRACTING PRACTICES HAVE CREATED EXTREME PAY  DISPARITIES  WHERE
 HUMAN  SERVICES  WORKERS  MAKE  ON  AVERAGE  SEVENTY-ONE PERCENT OF WHAT
 GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES MAKE, AND EIGHTY-TWO PERCENT OF WHAT PRIVATE SECTOR
 WORKERS RECEIVE.
  THE  PAY  DISPARITIES IN THE HUMAN SERVICES SECTOR ALSO HAVE IMPORTANT
 CONSEQUENCES FOR RACE AND GENDER EQUITY.  THE  HUMAN  SERVICES  PROVIDER
 WORKFORCE  OF  NEARLY  EIGHT  HUNDRED  THOUSAND PEOPLE IS OVERWHELMINGLY
 FEMALE (SIXTY-SIX PERCENT), OVER TWO-THIRDS  ARE  FULL-TIME  WORKERS  OF
 COLOR  (SIXTY-EIGHT  PERCENT),  AND  NEARLY HALF (FORTY-SIX PERCENT) ARE
 WOMEN OF COLOR. THE MAJORITY (SIXTY-THREE  PERCENT)  HAVE  A  FOUR  YEAR
 COLLEGE  DEGREE OR BETTER; YET THEY MAKE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A
 YEAR LESS THAN A PUBLIC SECTOR WORKER WITH A COMPARABLE EDUCATION.
  GOVERNMENT SAVINGS ARE BEING BORNE ON THE BACKS OF  LOW-INCOME  NEIGH-
 BORHOODS  AND BLACK, INDIGENOUS, AND PEOPLE OF COLOR (BIPOC) COMMUNITIES
 WHO GET REDUCED SERVICES AND A WORKFORCE THAT IS PREDOMINANTLY  MADE  UP
 OF WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE PAID POVERTY-LEVEL WAGES. THE RELA-
 TIVELY  LOW  PAY  IN  THE  CORE HUMAN SERVICES SECTOR MEANS THAT FIFTEEN
 PERCENT OF ALL WORKERS (BOTH FULL- AND  PART-TIME)  QUALIFIED  FOR  FOOD
 STAMPS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN.
  A  HUMAN  SERVICES EMPLOYEE WAGE BOARD IS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE THE
 PAY DISPARITIES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES OF CONTRACTED
 HUMAN SERVICES PROVIDERS AND DEVELOP  RECOMMENDATIONS  ON  ADEQUATE  AND
 EQUITABLE WAGES.
