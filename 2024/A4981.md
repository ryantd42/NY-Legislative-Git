  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 404 of  the  vehicle  and  traffic
 law,  as  amended  by  section 21 of part G of chapter 59 of the laws of
 2009, is amended to read as follows:
  1. The commissioner may issue  special  number  plates  to  applicants
 therefor  in  the same manner as other number plates are issued pursuant
 to this article. Such special number plates shall be  issued  only  upon
 payment  of  an  annual service charge of thirty-one dollars and twenty-
 five cents in addition to the regular fee  prescribed  by  section  four

 lieu  of the annual fee specified herein, the commissioner may establish
 specific categories of plates for which an annual fee of not  less  than
 eighteen dollars and seventy-five cents nor more than thirty-one dollars
 and  twenty-five  cents  may  be  charged subject to the approval of the
 director of the division of  the  budget.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER
 PROVISION  OF THIS SECTION, THE ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGE SHALL NOT APPLY TO
 THE ISSUANCE OF SPECIAL NUMBER PLATES TO VETERANS OF THE  ARMED  FORCES.
 Notwithstanding  any inconsistent provision of this section, the differ-
 ence collected between the special plates  fee  or  service  charge  set
 forth  in  this  subdivision in effect on and after September first, two
 thousand nine and the special plates fee or service charge set forth  in
 this  subdivision in effect prior to such date shall be deposited to the
 credit of the dedicated highway and bridge trust fund.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
