  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to highlight the vital role and  value
of  the  men  and  women  who  deliver the essential goods and resources
needed by all citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Kathy Hochul to proclaim September  16-20,  2024,  as  Truck
Driver  Appreciation  Week in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of National Truck Driver Appreciation Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nearly every aspect of daily life is made possible  because
a truck driver delivered the goods and resources people need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  3.5  million  professional  men  and women not only
deliver our goods safely, securely, and on  time,  they  also  keep  our
highways safe; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Professional  truck  drivers  actively  represent  their
industry daily on the nation's highways; they are an  untapped  resource
in spreading the trucking industry's message of safety, essentiality and
professionalism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  America's  Road  Team  participates  in  events across the
country to reinforce  the  trucking  industry's  commitment  to  safety,
sustainability and professionalism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The America's Road Team Captains also do ride-a-longs with
policy makers and members of the media to show them first-hand  what  it
takes to be safe on our highways; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Truck  Driver  Appreciation  Week  takes  on  a  special
significance considering the crucial  role  truck  drivers  have  played
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS, Truck Driver Appreciation Week is an important time for all
New  Yorkers to pay respect and thank all the professional truck drivers
for their hard work and commitment in undertaking one of  our  economy's
most demanding and important jobs; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Kathy Hochul to proclaim September  16-20,  2024,  as  Truck
Driver Appreciation Week in the State of New York; and be it further
