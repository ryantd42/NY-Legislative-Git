  WELCOMING  and  paying tribute to Sheriff Errol D.
  Toulon Jr. upon the occasion of  his  visit  to  the
  Legislative  Chambers  of the New York State Capitol
  in Albany, New York, on May 21, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, The quality and sanctity of community  life  are  cherished
values,  worthy  of  safeguarding, and this Legislative Body is moved to
honor those individuals who serve to preserve and protect  such  values,
lauding  particularly  their  unwavering  courage  and dedication in the
daily performance of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within every community of the State of New York  there  are
certain  individuals  who, by virtue of their commitment and dedication,
command  the  respect  and  admiration  of  their  community  for  their
exemplary contributions and service on behalf of others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sheriff  Errol  D.  Toulon  Jr., a 41-year law enforcement
veteran of Suffolk County, New York, has given not only of his time  and
energies,  but also of his competence, intelligence, and leadership, and
consequently,  has  been  designated  for  a  special  welcome  to  the
Legislative Chambers of the New York State Capitol; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Suffolk  Sheriff's  Office  is dedicated to improving
community safety, protecting  life  and  property,  and  reducing  crime
within  this  county  of  over  1.5  million  residents;  its  mission
encompasses not only upholding our state's civil and  criminal  statutes
and  holding  those  who  choose  to  disobey  accountable,  but  also
rehabilitation for those who have made mistakes and have  been  remanded
into its custody; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The sheriff's work requires a delicate balance of strength
and compassion, paired with dedicated leadership and a vast knowledge of
duties, to fulfill the oath each member of the office upholds on  behalf
of the residents of the county; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sheriff  Errol  D.  Toulon  Jr.  began  his  career  as  a
correction officer with the New York City Department of Corrections  and
served for 25 years with that agency before retiring as a captain; after
his  retirement,  he served in Suffolk County government as an Assistant
Deputy County Executive for Public Safety and  returned  to  the  city's
Department  of Corrections to serve as Deputy Commissioner of Operations
until becoming Suffolk County's 67th Sheriff in 2018; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sheriff Errol D. Toulon Jr.'s approach to  law  enforcement
focuses  on  the  power  of  community input in government, volunteerism
behind the bars, and how correctional institutions can change lives  for
the  better;  revisioning  the  role  of  the Sheriff's Office literally
starts with him, as he has been a steward of  the  Sheriff's  Transition
and Reentry Team (S.T.A.R.T.) which began under his leadership; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  belief  that  redemption  begins  with  mercy  is
demonstrated through Sheriff  Errol  D.  Toulon  Jr.'s  unrelenting  and
dedicated  efforts;  he  stands  constant  in  good grace and dignity in
 
proving that acting with humanity is an integral part of  rehabilitation
in Suffolk County; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is appropriate to recognize and commend such outstanding
law enforcement officers as Sheriff Errol D. Toulon Jr. for their valued
contributions to their community and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
dedicated public servants who unselfishly  devote  their  lives  to  the
preservation  of  order  and the protection of others are worthy and due
full praise for their commitment and noble endeavors; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body  welcome  and  pay  tribute  to
Sheriff  Errol  D.  Toulon  Jr.  upon  the  occasion of his visit to the
Legislative Chambers of the New York State Capitol in Albany, New  York,
on May 21, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Sheriff Errol D. Toulon Jr.
