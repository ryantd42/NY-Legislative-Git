  § 4. To ensure compliance with this minimum wage increase,  the  comp-
 troller  shall  have  the authority to review the contracts entered into
 between a managed care organization and a licensed  home  care  services
 agency,  fiscal intermediary, or any agency subject to the provisions of
 section 3614-f of the public health  law  to  ensure  that  rates  being
 offered are adequate and meet the department of health's actuarial stan-
 dards.  The comptroller, in consultation with the medicaid fraud control
 unit, may develop and promulgate a process to ensure such audits  comply
 with  state  and  federal  law  to  protect  proprietary information and
 contracts. In the event that the comptroller finds evidence that managed
 care organizations are not paying sufficient adequate rates,  they  will
 refer  such instances to the department of health and the medicaid fraud
 control unit for enforcement. If the department of health or  the  medi-
 caid  fraud  control  unit  chooses not to pursue action related to this
 referral, it shall inform, in writing, the comptroller's  office  as  to

 shall be public information and  made  available  on  the  comptroller's

 ization" shall mean an entity operating pursuant to section 364-j of the
 social services law or article 44 of the public health law.
  §  5. 1. The commissioners of the departments of taxation and finance,
 health and labor, in consultation with the office of temporary and disa-
 bility assistance, shall undertake a  study  regarding  the  use  of  an
 expanded  state  earned  income  tax credit as a strategy to improve the
 home care aide workforce. Such study  shall  include  an  evaluation  of
 issues, including but not limited to:
  a.  the range of increase needed to increase total compensation to the
 median compensation by county and/or region;
  b. implementation challenges related to  a  specific  sector  enhanced
 earned income credit;
  c. possible effects on worker recruitment and retention;
  d. fiscal impact on the state; and
  e.  any  other  issues  as determined by the commissioners and depart-
 ments.
  2. The study shall include a public hearing and/or other processes  to
 gather  information  from  all  interested  parties. The commissioner of
 taxation and finance shall report the findings of  the  study  no  later
 than  nine  months  after the effective date of this act or December 31,
 2024, whichever is sooner.
  § 6. Severability.  If any provision of this act, or  any  application
 of any provision of this act, is held to be invalid, or to violate or be
 inconsistent  with  any federal law or regulation, that shall not affect
 the validity or effectiveness of any other provision of this act, or any
 other application of any provision of this act which can be given effect
 without that provision or application; and to that end,  the  provisions
 and applications of this act are severable.
  §  7.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
