Senate Resolution No. 1610
 
BY: Senator BORRELLO
 
  RECOGNIZING  February  12-18, 2024, as Jell-O Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to  support  and
promote  the  historic  and significant observance of Jell-O Week in the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
recognize February 12-18, 2024, as Jell-O Week in the State of New York,
in conjunction with the observance of National Jell-O Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jell-O, as it was  originally  called,  has  existed  as  a
product since 1897, when a carpenter from Le Roy, New York, named Pearle
Wait experimented with gelatin and came up with a fruit flavored dessert
which his wife, May, named Jell-O; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1899, Jell-O was sold to Orator Francis Woodward, whose
Genesee Pure Food Company produced the successful Grain-O health  drink;
succeeding  years  saw  Jell-O change from a hand-packaged business to a
highly  mechanized  factory,  and  one  of  Le  Roy's  most  important
industries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  December  31, 1925, the Jell-O Company was sold to the
Postum Cereal Company, Inc., thereby becoming the first subsidiary of  a
large merger that would eventually become General Foods Corporation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first  four  Jell-O  flavors  were  orange,  lemon,
strawberry and raspberry, with lime introduced in 1930; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Jell-O Company left its hometown of Le Roy in 1964, yet
remains a vital component of the town's distinguished history; today,  a
Jell-O  Museum,  located  on  East  Main  Street, displays the company's
original advertising art, molds, spoons, toys, collectibles  and  recipe
books; and
 
  WHEREAS, Known as America's Most Famous Dessert, the Jell-O brand is
currently  owned  by  Kraft/General  Foods in Dover, Delaware, and sells
more than 300 million boxes each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Officially declared by the Utah Legislature  in  2001,  the
second  week  of  February  is National Jell-O Week and is celebrated by
various communities throughout the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
applaud  the  leaders  of  commerce  and  industry whose accomplishments
contribute to the economic health and prosperity of the  communities  of
the  State  of  New  York and to the quality of life of its people; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
recognize February 12-18, 2024, as Jell-O Week in the State of New York;
and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Greg Rogers, Mayor, Le Roy, New York.
