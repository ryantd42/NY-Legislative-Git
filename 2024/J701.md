  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 27, 2023, as Take Our Daughters  and  Sons  To
  Work Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase  awareness  of  educational
programs  designed  to  teach  our  children the importance of making an
honest living, the value of hard work, and the development of  a  strong
work ethic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim April 27, 2023, as Take
Our Daughters and Sons To  Work  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction with the observance of National Take Your Daughters and Sons
To Work Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Take  Our  Daughters And Sons To Work Foundation is a
non-profit agency established to build diversity in the workplace, raise
public awareness of children's issues and provide adults with pro-active
strategies to help girls and boys remain resilient,  especially  in  the
world of work; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  its leadership, expertise and collaborations, the
Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Foundation advocates for changes  in
social policy and public awareness on behalf of youth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  1993, on the fourth Thursday in April, more than 40
million youth and adults in over  four  million  workplaces  around  the
world  have  participated  in  the  Take  Our Daughters And Sons To Work
program; and
 
  WHEREAS, Designed to be  more  than  a  career  day,  the  Take  Our
Daughters  And  Sons To Work program goes beyond the average practice of
"shadowing" an adult; and
 
  WHEREAS, Exposing children to what a parent or  mentor  does  during
the  work  day  is  important,  but  showing  them  the  value  of their
education, helping them discover the power and possibilities of work and
family life, providing boys  and  girls  a  chance  to  share  how  they
envision the future, and allowing them to begin steps toward their goals
in  a  hands-on  and  interactive  environment is key to their achieving
success; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 2023 theme for Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work  Day
is "Working Better Together"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Participants  are  encouraged  to post videos, photos, and
stories about how they have been influenced in their professional roles,
as well as post conversations with children on topics such as  Education
Planning, Self-Discovery and Bullying Prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  bringing  children  together,  we  all  contribute  to
creating a  more  equitable  world  at  home,  at  school,  and  in  the
workplace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year, we are celebrating the opportunities kids will
discover and those  for  parents,  mentors,  and  the  community  to  be
involved in this unique educational experience; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
educational programs aimed to enhance the well-being and vitality of the
youth of our communities  certainly  have  earned  the  recognition  and
applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 27,  2023,  as  Take
Our  Daughters  and Sons To Work Day in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
