 AN ACT to amend the public officers law, in relation to the disposal  of
  certain information or data maintained by agencies of government
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 86 of the public officers law is amended by  adding
 three new subdivisions 12, 13 and 14 to read as follows:
  12.  "DATA BASE" MEANS A SET OF DATA, CONSISTING OF MORE THAN ONE DATA
 FILE, THAT IS COLLECTED AND STORED FOR A GIVEN PURPOSE.
  13. "DATA FILE" MEANS  AN  ELECTRONIC  RECORD  CONSISTING  OF  RELATED
 NUMERIC,  TEXTUAL OR GRAPHIC INFORMATION THAT IS ORGANIZED IN A STRICTLY
 PRESCRIBED FORM AND FORMAT.
  14. "ELECTRONIC RECORD" MEANS ANY RECORD THAT IS STORED, PROCESSED AND
 USED BY MEANS OF A COMPUTER.
  § 2. Subparagraph iii of paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section  87
 of  the  public  officers  law, as amended by chapter 745 of the laws of
 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  iii. the fees for copies of records which shall not exceed twenty-five
 cents per photocopy not in excess of nine inches by fourteen inches,  or
 the  actual  cost of reproducing any other record in accordance with the
 provisions of paragraph (c) of this subdivision, except when a different
 fee is otherwise prescribed by statute. In the case where  an  identical
 record  has been prepared for a previous request within the past [6] SIX
 months and an electronic copy is available, an agency shall not charge a
 fee.  If more than one request is made for an  identical  record  before
 any  such  request  has  been  fulfilled, any fees charged by the agency
 under this subparagraph shall be apportioned equally  among  the  reque-
 stors.  WITH RESPECT TO AN ELECTRONIC RECORD, THE ACTUAL COST OF REPROD-
 UCTION  SHALL  INCLUDE  THE  COST  OF  THE  STAFF TIME AND COMPUTER TIME

  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 87 of the public officers law is amended
 by adding a new paragraph (d) to read as follows:
