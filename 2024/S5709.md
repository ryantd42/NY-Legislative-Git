 Introduced  by  Sen. KENNEDY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Local Government
 
 AN ACT to amend the general municipal law, in relation  to  biodiversity
  in planting projects
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 96-b of the general  municipal  law,  as  added  by
 chapter 686 of the laws of 1978, is amended to read as follows:
  § 96-b. Tree conservation.  1. The legislature hereby finds that there
 is a direct relationship between the planting of trees, shrubs and asso-
 ciated  vegetation  in  sufficient  number  in  populated  areas and the
 health, safety, and welfare  of  communities,  and  as  related  to  the
 natural,  scenic,  and  aesthetic  values  of trees and the physical and
 visual qualities of the environment which municipalities are  authorized
 to protect. Trees and such vegetation abate noise, provide welcome shade
 to  people, preserve the balance of oxygen in the air by removing carbon
 dioxide and fostering air quality, and add color and  verdure  to  human
 construction.  They  also stabilize the soil and control water pollution
 by preventing soil erosion and flooding, yield advantageous microclimat-
 ic effects, and provide a natural habitat for wildlife.  The destructive
 and indiscriminate  removal  of  trees  and  related  vegetation  causes
 increased municipal costs for proper drainage control, impairs the bene-
 fits  of  occupancy  of  existing residential properties and impairs the
 stability and value of both improved and unimproved real property in the
 area of destruction, and  adversely  affects  the  health,  safety,  and
 general  welfare  of  the  inhabitants  of the state. HOWEVER, WHEN TREE
 REMOVAL IS NECESSARY TO STOP  THE  SPREAD  OF  INVASIVE  SPECIES  IT  IS
 CRUCIAL  THAT  MUNICIPALITIES  REPLANT  LOST TREES AND VEGETATION, WHILE
 MAINTAINING BIODIVERSITY IN PLANTING  PROJECTS  TO  AVOID  FUTURE  LOSS.
 BIODIVERSITY  ENSURES RESISTANCE AGAINST MASS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INVASIVE
 SPECIES.

  2. In addition to any power or authority of a municipal corporation to
 regulate by planning or zoning laws or regulations or by local laws  and
 regulations,  the  local  legislative  body of any county, city, town or
 village is hereby empowered to provide for the protection and  conserva-
 tion of trees and related vegetation.  Such legislative body may require
 appropriate  conditions applicable to any activity involving the removal
 or destruction of trees or the substantial  alteration  of  grade  level
 around  trees  may  include,  where  appropriate,  requirements that the
 activity be done as specified in an approved landscape plan and that the
 removed trees be replaced by the  planting  of  the  same  or  alternate
 species  of  trees,  and  may provide, in connection therewith, required
 plantings for screening purposes. Such regulations,  special  conditions
 and  restrictions, adopted in the exercise of the police power, shall be
 reasonable and appropriate to the purpose.  The municipality may require
 the posting of  a  performance  bond  to  assure  compliance  with  this
 section.  All charges and expenses incurred under this section by a town
 shall be a charge upon the taxable property of that  part  of  the  town
 outside any incorporated village.
  3. WHEN A MUNICIPALITY, PARKS DEPARTMENT, HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER
 LOCAL  ENTITY  UNDERTAKES  A  TREE PLANTING PROJECT IN PUBLIC LOCATIONS,
 THEY SHALL SELECT AND PLANT BIOLOGICALLY  DIVERSE  TYPES  OF  TREES.  TO
 SATISFY  SUFFICIENT  BIODIVERSITY,  THE  MUNICIPALITY  SHALL  FOLLOW THE
 10-20-30 PRINCIPLE WHEN  THE  MUNICIPALITY  IS  PLANTING  NEW  TREES  OR
 REPLANTING  IN  AN AREA. THE 10-20-30 PRINCIPLE STATES THAT A TREE POPU-
 LATION SHALL INCLUDE NO MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF ANY ONE SPECIES, TWENTY
 PERCENT OF ANY ONE GENUS, OR THIRTY PERCENT  OF  ANY  ONE  FAMILY.  THIS
 PERCENTAGE  SHALL  BE MEASURED BY THE TREE POPULATION AS A WHOLE, NOT BY
 ANY ONE PLANTING PROJECT SOLELY.
  § 2. This act shall take effect January 1, 2026 or on the two  hundred
 seventieth day after it shall have become a law, whichever is later.
