Senate Resolution No. 1731
 
BY: Senator MAYER
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  75th  Anniversary  of  the
  Larchmont Temple, Har Chayim on August 17, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, The quality and character of life  in  New  York  State  is
greatly  enriched  by  its  religious  institutions and the faithful and
generous service of those who devote themselves to endeavors of  family,
faith, and community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend institutions of  such  magnanimous  conduct  and  bearing  which
demonstrate  a  deep and continuing concern for others, and in so doing,
inspire others to do the same; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Larchmont Temple, Har Chayim  on
August 17, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  the time of the Temple's founding, there were very few
Jewish families in Larchmont, New York; the trauma of World War  II  led
to  many  Jewish families looking to disaffiliate, to melt into normalcy
and Americanize their names to  create  an  anonymity  of  a  non-Jewish
environment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recognizing  the  need  to  educate their children, Jewish
families in Larchmont  fostered  the  idea  to  start  a  Jewish  Reform
congregation  and religious school; the idea was first introduced by the
Larchmont Temple's  founder,  Pearl  Belchetz,  who  invited  interested
Jewish  residents  in  the  community to attend a meeting in her home on
June 8, 1948; and
 
  WHEREAS, With 60 residents responding to the initial call to action,
the first official membership meeting was held at the  Larchmont  Public
Library  on  August  17, 1948; a constitution was adopted, and officers,
and trustees were elected; and
 
  WHEREAS, Friday evening services were held at the homes of  members,
religious  school  classes in a music school, and the first High Holiday
services at the American Legion Post 347; but soon it became clear  that
a  larger  house  was  needed,  so the large house, designed by Stanford
White in 1892 and now the Blum Building, on Willow Avenue was  purchased
to  accommodate  all Temple functions including Friday evening services,
the religious school, and all meetings; and
 
  WHEREAS, The original Larchmont  Temple,  Har  Chayim  (Mountain  of
Life),  was  located  in a Victorian mansion, the Blum Building, and the
present establishment was dedicated in 1954; the current  sanctuary  for
religious  services, Social Hall and Garden Room, were dedicated in 2001
to meet the needs of an expanding membership and Temple community; and
 
  WHEREAS, From its humble beginnings with 50 families, the  Larchmont
Temple  has  grown  to  over  800 families, reaffirming covenant and our
commitment to a vibrant Jewish future; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the Larchmont Temple are involved in all aspects
of the community, maintaining strong civic and religious values; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  able  leadership  of  Senior  Rabbi Jeffrey J.
Sirkman, the Larchmont Temple, now stands on the threshold of  tomorrow,
prepared  to  meet the challenges of the coming decades, while retaining
that spiritual resolve which has so characterized its glorious past; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to take  note  of
enduring  religious  institutions  and to bring such institutions to the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 75th Anniversary of the Larchmont Temple, Har Chayim on
August 17, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Senior Rabbi Jeffrey J. Sirkman, Larchmont Temple.
