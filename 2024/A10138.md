 Introduced by COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Buttenschon)

 AN  ACT  to amend the education law, in relation to prohibiting awarding
  TAP grants to those enrolled at for-profit universities
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Paragraph c of subdivision 3 of section 667 of the educa-
 tion law, as added by chapter 83 of the laws of 1995 and  as  relettered
 by  section 2 of part J of chapter 58 of the laws of 2011, is amended to
 read as follows:
  c. Restrictions. In no [even shall] EVENT shall any award:
  (i) be made unless the annual tuition (exclusive of educational  fees)
 and,  if  applicable,  the college fee levied by the state university of
 New York pursuant  to  the  April  first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-four
 financing  agreement with the New York state dormitory authority charged
 for the program in which the student is  enrolled  total  at  least  two
 hundred dollars; or
  (ii)  exceed  the  amount  by  which such annual tuition (exclusive of
 educational fees) and, if applicable, the  college  fee  levied  by  the
 state  university  of  New  York  pursuant  to the April first, nineteen
 hundred sixty-four financing agreement with the New York state dormitory
 authority exceed the total of all other state, federal, or other  educa-
 tional  aid  that  is  received or receivable by such student during the
 school year for which such award is applicable and that, in the judgment
 of the commissioner, would duplicate the purposes of the award; or
  (iii) be made when income exceeds the maximum income set forth in this
 subdivision. The commissioner shall list in his  regulations  all  major
 state and federal financial aid available to New York state students and
 identify  any  forms  of aid that are duplicative of the purposes of the
 tuition assistance  program.  For  the  purposes  of  this  subdivision,
 neither United States war orphan educational benefits nor benefits under
 the  veterans'  readjustment  act of nineteen hundred sixty-six shall be
 considered as federal or other educational aid; OR
  (IV) BE MADE TO ANYONE MATRICULATED AT A FOR-PROFIT INSTITUTION.
