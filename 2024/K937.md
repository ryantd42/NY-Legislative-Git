BY: M. of A. Clark
 
  COMMEMORATING the 60th Anniversary of The House of
  Guitars, Inc. of Rochester, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to honor those
businesses within the State of New  York  which  distinguish  themselves
through  outstanding service to their customers and contributions to the
economies and culture of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary  of  The  House  of  Guitars,  Inc.  of
Rochester, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  House  of  Guitars, Inc. is located in Rochester, New
York, and is known as the "Largest Guitar Store in the World"; the store
was established in 1964 by Bruce  and  Armand  Schaubroeck  out  of  the
basement  of  their  mother's home in Irondequoit, New York, and quickly
became famous for being the intersection of music, art and culture; and
 
  WHEREAS, Working other jobs,  the  Schaubroeck  brothers  ran  paper
routes  and  worked  at  local  meat  markets by day and sold guitars by
night; in March of 1972, they purchased a  historical  building  at  645
Titus  Avenue in Irondequoit that was formerly known as the Grange Hall;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Grange Hall provided social activities for the  farming
community such as amateur theatrical performances, dances, meetings, and
more;  this  historical  building would prove to be a great move for the
Schaubroeck brothers and remains their current store  location  to  this
day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  April 28, 2014, The House of Guitars was inducted into
the Rochester Music Hall of Fame; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, The House of Guitars has a prodigious collection  of
new,  used,  and  vintage  guitars  housed in cases displayed throughout
multiple levels; the upstairs sells drums and keyboards and is also  the
home of the in-house repair shop, Robinson Kustom Repair; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  a  number  of back rooms which serve as retail
space for percussion, amplification, PA equipment and accessories,  with
a  large  warehouse  in the back selling CDs, vinyl, DVDs, t-shirts, and
more; the walls of the store  display  thousands  of  old  pictures  and
autographs  acquired  from  six  decades of business in the music scene,
making it akin to a museum rather than an average retail shop; and
 
  WHEREAS, The store also has its own music school  with  daily  music
lessons  on  all different types of musical instruments; a stage located
in the center of the guitar department hosts  live,  free  shows  almost
every  weekend  supporting  both  national  touring acts and local bands
alike; and
 
  WHEREAS, The House of Guitars has supported multiple generations  of
rising  young  stars  from  Earth  and the community through employment,
music lessons, and event sponsorship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recognized  as one of the top musical instrument stores in
the world by industry organizations, manufacturers, and journalists, The
House of Guitars has attracted musicians, music fans, and other visitors
from throughout the United States and the world and brought  recognition
to  the  Town of Irondequoit, City of Rochester, and Monroe County; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  60th Anniversary of The House of Guitars, Inc.; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Bruce  Schaubroeck and Armand Schaubroeck, The House of
Guitars, Inc.
