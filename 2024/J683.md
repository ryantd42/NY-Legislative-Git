BY: Senator PARKER
 
  MOURNING  the  death  of  The  Reverend  Calvin O.
  Butts, distinguished citizen, religious leader,  and
  devoted member of his community
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of this Legislative Body to bring full
recognition and just  tribute  to  those  men  and  women  of  religious
commitment  who accept the responsibility of moral leadership and render
the wisdom of human understanding; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body, representing the people of the State
of New York, is moved this day to pay  tribute  to  an  eminent  man  of
indomitable  faith  and  dedication  whose  public service and countless
accomplishments will forever stand as a  paradigm  and  inspiration  for
others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Reverend  Calvin O. Butts died on Friday, October 28,
2022, at the age of 73; and
 
  WHEREAS, The unity of  our  State  and  Nation  is  built  upon  the
compassion  of  individuals  such as Reverend Calvin O. Butts who upheld
the values of community life  and  who,  through  their  great  actions,
epitomized the best of humanity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on July 19, 1949 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Calvin O.
Butts  spent  most  of  his  lifetime  in  New  York, beginning in early
childhood where he received his primary education; he  was  a  promising
athlete and scholar at Flushing High School where he was a member of the
track team and president of his senior class, graduating in 1967; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1972, Calvin O. Butts received a Bachelor of Arts degree
from  Morehouse  College,  where  he  pledged  to  the  Kappa  Alpha Psi
fraternity and was active in civil rights; he then returned to New  York
where  he  earned  his  Master of Divinity degree in Church History from
Union Theological Seminary in 1975, and later his Doctorate of  Ministry
in Church and Public Policy from Drew University; and
 
  WHEREAS, This extraordinary man was still in graduate school when he
was  hired  to  work at Abyssinian Baptist Church, starting as an office
assistant and working his way up to assistant pastor,  eventually  being
named head pastor in 1989; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  his  three  decades  as  pastor  of Abyssinian
Baptist Church, Reverend Calvin O. Butts' work  reflected  the  dramatic
changes  in  how Americans confronted the nation's history of racism; he
took inspiration from the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther  King  Jr.  in  the
1960s,  and  by  the dawn of the 21st century, he was a partner of Mayor
Michael R.  Bloomberg in attempting to create lasting change  in  Harlem
and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  his  remarkable  tenure  as  the  church's leader,
Reverend Calvin O. Butts was a tireless advocate for affordable  housing
through  the  Abyssinian  Development  Corporation,  a  non-profit
organization he established in 1989; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Under his guidance, the corporation raised $2.8 million to
purchase and renovate property to be used as a homeless shelter; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, with a steadfast and unwavering commitment  to
his  community, Reverend Calvin O. Butts oversaw the building of a large
apartment complex for senior citizens and apartments for moderate income
households; and
 
  WHEREAS, This distinguished man of  God  always  gave  guidance  and
wisdom to the many entrusted to his care and administered abundantly and
unstintingly to the spiritual and corporal needs of all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Armed  with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a sense of
compassion, Reverend Calvin O. Butts leaves behind a legacy  which  will
long  endure  the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory
to all he served and befriended; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
mourn  the  death  of  The  Reverend Calvin O. Butts, and to express its
deepest condolences to his family; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of The Reverend Calvin O. Butts.
