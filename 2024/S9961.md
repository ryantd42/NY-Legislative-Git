  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subsection (g-1) of section 606 of the tax law, as  amended
 by  chapter  378  of  the laws of 2005, paragraphs 1 and 2 as amended by
 chapter 375 of the laws of 2012, paragraph 3 as amended, paragraph 5  as
 added,  and  paragraphs  6,  7 and 8 as renumbered by chapter 128 of the
 laws of 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  (g-1) Solar energy system equipment credit. (1) General. An individual
 taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this arti-
 cle equal to [twenty-five]  FORTY  percent  of  qualified  solar  energy
 system equipment expenditures, except as provided in subparagraph (D) of
 paragraph  two  of  this  subsection. This credit shall not exceed three
 thousand seven hundred fifty dollars for qualified solar  energy  equip-
 ment  placed  in service before September first, two thousand six, [and]
 five thousand dollars for qualified solar  energy  equipment  placed  in
 service on or after September first, two thousand six AND BEFORE JANUARY
 FIRST,  TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE, AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR QUALIFIED
 SOLAR ENERGY EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST,  TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE.
  (2) Qualified solar energy system equipment expenditures. (A) The term
 "qualified  solar  energy  system equipment expenditures" means expendi-
 tures for:
  (i) the purchase of solar energy system equipment which  is  installed
 in  connection  with  residential  property which is (I) located in this
 state and (II) which is used by the taxpayer as [his or her] THEIR prin-
 cipal residence at the time the solar energy system equipment is  placed
 in service;
  (ii) the lease of solar energy system equipment under a written agree-
 ment  that  spans  at  least  ten  years where such equipment owned by a
 person other than the taxpayer is installed in connection with  residen-
 tial  property which is (I) located in this state and (II) which is used

 by the taxpayer as [his or her] THEIR principal residence  at  the  time
 the solar energy system equipment is placed in service; or
  (iii)  the  purchase  of power under a written agreement that spans at
 least ten years whereunder the power purchased  is  generated  by  solar
 energy  system equipment owned by a person other than the taxpayer which
 is installed in  connection  with  residential  property  which  is  (I)
 located  in this state and (II) which is used by the taxpayer as [his or
 her] THEIR principal residence at  the  time  the  solar  energy  system
 equipment is placed in service.
  (B) Such qualified expenditures shall include expenditures for materi-
 als, labor costs properly allocable to on-site preparation, assembly and
 original  installation,  architectural  and  engineering  services,  and
 designs and plans directly related to the construction  or  installation
 of the solar energy system equipment.
  (C)  Such  qualified  expenditures  for  the  purchase of solar energy
 system equipment shall not include interest or other finance charges.
  (D) Such qualified expenditures for the lease of solar  energy  system
 equipment  or  the  purchase  of  power  under an agreement described in
 clauses (ii) or (iii)  of  subparagraph  (A)  of  this  paragraph  shall
 include  an  amount  equal  to all payments made during the taxable year
 under such agreement. Provided, however,  such  credits  shall  only  be
 allowed  for  fourteen  years after the first taxable year in which such
 credit is allowed. Provided further, however,  the  [twenty-five]  FORTY
 percent  limitation in paragraph one of this subsection shall only apply
 to the total aggregate amount of all payments to be made pursuant to  an
 agreement  referenced  in  clauses  (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) of
 this paragraph, and shall not apply to individual payments made during a
 taxable year under such agreement except to the extent  such  limitation
 on an aggregate basis has been reached.
  (3)  Solar  energy  system  equipment.  The  term "solar energy system
 equipment" shall  mean  an  arrangement  or  combination  of  components
 utilizing solar radiation, which, when installed in a residence, produc-
 es  AND MAY STORE energy designed to provide heating, cooling, hot water
 or electricity for use in such residence. Such arrangement or components
 MAY INCLUDE ELECTRIC ENERGY STORAGE EQUIPMENT BUT shall not include  ANY
 OTHER  equipment  connected  to  solar energy system equipment that is a
 component of part or parts of a non-solar energy system  or  which  uses
 any  sort  of  recreational  facility  or equipment as a storage medium.
 Solar energy system equipment that generates AND STORES electricity  for
 use  in a residence must conform to applicable requirements set forth in
 section sixty-six-j of the public service law. Provided, however,  where
 solar  energy system equipment is purchased and installed by a condomin-
 ium management association or a  cooperative  housing  corporation,  for
 purposes  of  this  subsection  only,  the  term "ten kilowatts" in such
 section sixty-six-j shall be read as "[fifty] TEN" kilowatts  MULTIPLIED
 BY  THE NUMBER OF OWNER-OCCUPIED UNITS IN THE COOPERATIVE OR CONDOMINIUM
 MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION.
  (4)  Multiple  taxpayers.  Where  solar  energy  system  equipment  is
 purchased  and  installed in a principal residence shared by two or more
 taxpayers, the amount of the credit allowable under this subsection  for
 each  such taxpayer shall be prorated according to the percentage of the
 total expenditure for such solar energy system equipment contributed  by
 each taxpayer.
  (5)  Proportionate  share.  Where  solar  energy  system  equipment is
 purchased and installed by a condominium  management  association  or  a
 cooperative  housing  corporation,  a  taxpayer  who  is a member of the
 S. 9961  3
 
 condominium management association or who is a tenant-stockholder in the
 cooperative housing corporation may for the purpose of  this  subsection
 claim  a proportionate share of the total expense as the expenditure for
 the  purposes  of the credit attributable to [his] THEIR principal resi-
 dence.
  (6) Grants. For purposes of determining the amount of the  expenditure
 incurred in purchasing and installing solar energy system equipment, the
 amount  of  any  federal, state or local grant received by the taxpayer,
 which was used for the purchase and/or installation  of  such  equipment
 and  which was not included in the federal gross income of the taxpayer,
 shall not be included in the amount of such expenditures.
  (7) When credit allowed. The  credit  provided  for  herein  shall  be
 allowed  with  respect  to  the  taxable year, commencing after nineteen
 hundred ninety-seven, in which the  solar  energy  system  equipment  is
 placed in service.
  (8) Carryover of credit AND REFUNDABILITY.  If the amount of the cred-
 it,  and  carryovers of such credit, allowable under this subsection for
 any taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax  for  such  year,  such
 excess amount may be carried over to the five taxable years next follow-
 ing the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed and may
 be  deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years. FOR TAXABLE
 YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE,  IF
 THE  AMOUNT  OF  THE CREDIT ALLOWABLE UNDER THIS SUBSECTION SHALL EXCEED
 THE TAXPAYER'S TAX LIABILITY FOR SUCH YEAR, THE EXCESS SHALL BE  TREATED
 AS  AN  OVERPAYMENT OF TAX TO BE CREDITED OR REFUNDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THE PROVISIONS OF  SECTION  SIX  HUNDRED  EIGHTY-SIX  OF  THIS  ARTICLE,
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO INTEREST SHALL BE PAID THEREON.
  §  2.  The  real  property  tax law is amended by adding a new section
 425-b to read as follows:

 PLATE CAPACITY.
  2. HOMEOWNERS IN MUNICIPALITIES THAT AGREE TO HOST AT LEAST TWO  MIDS-
 CALE  SOLAR  ENERGY PROJECTS, NOT INCLUDING ANY PROJECT THAT HAS ALREADY
 BEGUN SUBSTANTIAL CONSTRUCTION, SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A SOLAR STAR CRED-
 IT FOR ALL HOMEOWNERS LIVING  IN  SUCH  MUNICIPALITY.  HOMEOWNERS  SHALL
 APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE A SOLAR STAR CREDIT IN THE SAME MANNER  AND AT THE
 SAME  TIME  AS THE EXISTING STAR CREDIT UNDER SECTION FOUR HUNDRED TWEN-
 TY-FIVE OF THIS ARTICLE AND SECTION SIX HUNDRED SIX OF THE TAX LAW.  THE
 VALUE  OF  THE CREDIT SHALL BE EQUAL TO TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL
 BASIC STAR CREDIT AVAILABLE TO QUALIFIED HOMEOWNERS. THIS CREDIT WILL BE
 APPLIED ONLY AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF CONSTRUCTION AND INTERCONNECTION OF
 THE SECOND MIDSCALE SOLAR PROJECT AS DEFINED. SUCH CREDIT WILL BE AVAIL-
 ABLE TO ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNERS FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 140 of the public service law, as  added

 S. 9961  4
 
 tained, or operated except in conformity with such major renewable ener-
 gy facility siting permit and  any  terms,  limitations,  or  conditions
 contained  therein,  provided  that  nothing  in  this subdivision shall
 exempt such facility from compliance with federal laws and regulations.
  §  4. Subdivision 1 of section 141 of the public service law, as added
 by section 11 of part O of chapter 58 of the laws of 2024, is amended to
 read as follows:
  1. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of  subdivision  five  of  this
 section,  no  person  shall  commence  the preparation of a site for, or
 begin the construction of, a major electric transmission facility in the
 state without having first obtained a siting  permit  pursuant  to  this
 article  AND  ANY  PERMIT  REQUIRED BY A MUNICIPALITY IN WHICH THE MAJOR
 ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FACILITY WILL BE LOCATED. Any major electric tran-
 smission facility subject to this article with respect to which a siting
 permit is issued shall not thereafter be built, maintained, or  operated

 an  assessment  of comments received, and in the case of an adjudicatory
 hearing, the executive director or any  person  to  whom  the  executive
 director  has delegated such authority shall issue a final written hear-
 ing report. A final siting permit may only be issued  if  ORES  makes  a
 finding  that the proposed project, together with any applicable uniform
 and site-specific standards and conditions, would comply with applicable
 laws and regulations. [In making a  final  siting  permit  determination
 with respect to a major renewable energy facility, ORES may elect not to
 apply, in whole or in part, any local law or ordinance that would other-
 wise  be  applicable  if  it  makes  a  finding  that, as applied to the
 proposed facility, it is unreasonably burdensome in view  of  the  CLCPA
 targets, and the environmental benefits.]
  §6.  Subdivision  2 of section 144 of the public service law, as added
 by section 11 of part O of chapter 58 of the laws of 2024, is amended to
 read as follows:

 consent, permit, certificate, contract, agreement,  or  other  condition
 for the development, design, construction, operation, or decommissioning
 of  a  major  renewable energy facility or a major electric transmission
 facility with respect to which an application for a  siting  permit  has
 been  filed[, provided in the case of a municipality, political subdivi-
 sion or an agency thereof, such entity has received notice of the filing

 the  record, without requirement of reproduction, and upon briefs to the
 court. The findings of fact on which such decision  is  based  shall  be
 conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered
 as  a whole and matters of judicial notice set forth in the opinion. The
