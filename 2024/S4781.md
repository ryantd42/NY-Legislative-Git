  §  2.  Subdivision 4 of section 400.00 of the penal law, as amended by
 chapter 371 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  4. Investigation. Before a license is issued or renewed,  there  shall
 be an investigation of all statements required in the application by the
 duly  constituted police authorities of the locality where such applica-
 tion is made, including but not limited to such records as may be acces-
 sible to the division of state police or division  of  criminal  justice
 services  pursuant  to section 400.02 of this article. For that purpose,
 the records of the  appropriate  office  of  the  department  of  mental
 hygiene  concerning  previous or present mental illness of the applicant
 shall be available for inspection by the investigating  officer  of  the
 police  authority.  Where the applicant is domiciled in a foreign state,
 the investigation shall include inquiry of the foreign state for records
 concerning the previous or present mental illness of the applicant, and,
 to the extent necessary for inspection by the investigating officer, the
 applicant shall execute a waiver of confidentiality of  such  record  in
 such form as may be required by the foreign state. In order to ascertain
 any  previous  criminal record, the investigating officer shall take the
 fingerprints and physical descriptive  data  in  quadruplicate  of  each
 individual by whom the application is signed and verified. Two copies of
 such  fingerprints  shall  be  taken on standard fingerprint cards eight
 inches square, and one copy may be taken on a  card  supplied  for  that
 purpose  by the federal bureau of investigation; provided, however, that
 in the case of a corporate applicant that  has  already  been  issued  a
 dealer  in firearms license and seeks to operate a firearm dealership at
 a second or subsequent location, the original fingerprints on  file  may
 be  used  to  ascertain  any criminal record in the second or subsequent
 application unless any of the corporate officers have changed since  the
 prior  application, in which case the new corporate officer shall comply
 with procedures governing an initial application for such license.  When
 completed,  one  standard card shall be forwarded to and retained by the
 division of criminal justice services in the  executive  department,  at
 Albany.  A search of the files of such division and written notification
 of the results of the search shall be  forwarded  to  the  investigating
 officer  and  shall  be made without unnecessary delay. Thereafter, such
 division shall notify the licensing officer and  the  executive  depart-
 ment,  division  of  state police, Albany, of any criminal record of the
 applicant filed therein subsequent to the search of its files. A  second
 standard  card,  or  the  one supplied by the federal bureau of investi-
 gation, as the case may be, shall be forwarded to that bureau  at  Wash-
 ington  with  a  request  that  the  files of the bureau be searched and
 S. 4781  4

 notification of the results of the search be made to  the  investigating
 police  authority, INCLUDING THE NO FLY LIST MAINTAINED BY THE TERRORIST
 SCREENING CENTER. Of the remaining two fingerprint cards, one  shall  be
 filed  with  the executive department, division of state police, Albany,
 within ten days after issuance of  the  license,  and  the  other  shall
 remain  on file with the investigating police authority. No such finger-
 prints may be inspected by any person other than a peace officer, who is
 acting pursuant to his or her  special  duties,  or  a  police  officer,
 except  on  order of a judge or justice of a court of record either upon
 notice to the licensee or without notice, as the judge  or  justice  may
 deem  appropriate.  Upon  completion  of  the  investigation, the police
 authority shall report the results  to  the  licensing  officer  without
 unnecessary delay.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
