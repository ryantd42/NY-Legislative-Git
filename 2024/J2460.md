BY: Senator STEC
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  75th  Anniversary  of  the
  Franklin-Essex-Hamilton BOCES
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute to those organizations which are committed to enhancing the
quality of education in the State of New  York,  and  which  enable  our
schools  to  offer  excellent educational programs in the most efficient
manner; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the  Franklin-Essex-Hamilton  BOCES,
to be celebrated at a special event on Thursday, May 30, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  event  will  be  held  at  the  two  schools  run  by
Franklin-Essex-Hamilton (FEH) BOCES: Adirondack  Educational  Center  in
Saranac  Lake  and  North Franklin Educational Center in Malone; the two
events will be joined together through video conferencing, allowing  for
a truly unifying celebratory experience; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Boards  of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) are an
integral  component  of  New  York  State's  public  education  system,
providing  special  education  services  to  more  than  16,000 students
annually, as well as career and technical education opportunities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, the FEH BOCES  programs  and  services
have  been  unparalleled  in  meeting  the  unique  needs  of New York's
students, school districts, business, and industry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Leaders in innovation, BOCES funds  efforts  toward  equity
and  inclusion,  supporting  professional  learning  for  educators, and
developing new programs and services to meet the changing needs  of  the
state's students and businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  FEH  BOCES  got  its  start  when  Boards  of  Cooperative
Educational Services were created by New York state  law  in  1948;  the
first  FEH BOCES Board of Education meeting was held on August 18, 1948,
in Brushton, New York, and the first employees were approved to be hired
on October 18, 1948; and
 
  WHEREAS, At its start, the BOCES  served  two  school  districts  in
Bombay, two in Moira, one in Dickinson, one in Waverly, and one in Santa
Clara;  most  of the initial work the BOCES provided included nurses and
dental care, as well as teachers who split their time  between  multiple
districts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the next 75 years, the Franklin-Essex-Hamilton BOCES
would grow to cover 10 school districts that encompass all  of  Franklin
County,  as  well  as  some  districts in Hamilton and Essex counties as
well; FEH BOCES now provides a variety of cooperative services to  those
school  districts,  including  trades training and alternative education
for high school  students,  GED  preparation  for  adults,  support  and
 
training  for  teachers,  and  business,  human  resources,  and  other
operational supports; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud and distinguished history, FEH BOCES may
look  back with pride upon its humble beginnings, find just satisfaction
in its purposeful growth, and hold true of purpose in its commitment  to
serving  the educational needs of the citizens of the State of New York;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  75th Anniversary of the Franklin-Essex-Hamilton BOCES;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to FEH BOCES.
