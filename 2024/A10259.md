  §  582-104.  PROCEDURE FOR A DE FACTO PARENT TO FILE FOR A JUDGMENT OF
 PARENTAGE. (A) A PROCEEDING TO ESTABLISH PARENTAGE OF A  CHILD  PURSUANT
 TO THIS ARTICLE MAY BE COMMENCED BY A PERSON WHO:
  (1) IS ALIVE WHEN THE PROCEEDING IS COMMENCED; AND
  (2) CLAIMS TO BE A DE FACTO PARENT OF THE CHILD; OR
  (3) CLAIMS TO BE THE CHILD OF A DE FACTO PARENT.
  (B)  A  PERSON  SEEKING TO BE ADJUDICATED AS A PARENT OF A CHILD SHALL
 FILE A PETITION WITH THE COURT BEFORE THE CHILD REACHES  EIGHTEEN  YEARS
 OF  AGE.  THE CHILD IS REQUIRED TO BE ALIVE AT THE TIME OF THE FILING.
 THE PETITION SHALL  INCLUDE  A  VERIFIED  AFFIDAVIT  ALLEGING  FACTS  TO
 SUPPORT  THE EXISTENCE OF A DE FACTO PARENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHILD.
 THE PETITION AND AFFIDAVIT SHALL BE SERVED ON THE FOLLOWING: ALL PARENTS
 OF THE CHILD; THE CHILD; THE CHILD'S LEGAL  GUARDIAN  IF  THE  CHILD  IS
 UNDER  EIGHTEEN  YEARS  OF  AGE;  AND,  ANY OTHER NECESSARY PARTY TO THE
 PROCEEDING.
  (C) AN ADVERSE PARTY, PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN MAY FILE A PLEADING AND
 VERIFIED AFFIDAVIT IN RESPONSE TO THE PETITION THAT SHALL BE  SERVED  ON
 ALL PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING.
  (D)  THE COURT SHALL DETERMINE ON THE BASIS OF THE PLEADINGS AND AFFI-
 DAVITS WHETHER THE  PERSON  SEEKING  TO  BE  ADJUDICATED  A  PARENT  HAS
 PRESENTED PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE OF THE CRITERIA FOR PARENTAGE PURSUANT TO
 SUBDIVISION  (A)  OF  SECTION  582-103  OF THIS PART AND, THEREFORE, HAS
 STANDING TO PROCEED WITH A PARENTAGE ACTION.  THE  COURT,  IN  ITS  SOLE
 DISCRETION,  MAY  HOLD  A  HEARING  TO DETERMINE DISPUTED FACTS THAT ARE
 NECESSARY AND MATERIAL TO THE ISSUE OF STANDING.
  (E) IF THE CHILD FOR WHOM THE PERSON IS SEEKING TO  BE  ADJUDICATED  A
 PARENT  HAS  TWO  PARENTS AT THE TIME THE PETITION IS FILED AND THERE IS
 LITIGATION PENDING BETWEEN THE PARENTS AT THE TIME THE PETITION IS FILED
 REGARDING CUSTODY OR VISITATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CHILD, A PARENT  MAY
 INTRODUCE  EVIDENCE  THAT THE DE FACTO PARENT ACTION IS BEING BROUGHT TO
 INTERFERE IMPROPERLY IN THE PENDING LITIGATION. BASED ON SUCH  EVIDENCE,
 THE COURT MAY DETERMINE THAT ALLOWING THE DE FACTO PARENT'S PETITION FOR
 JUDGMENT  OF  PARENTAGE TO PROCEED WOULD NOT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF
 THE CHILD AND MAY DISMISS THE PETITION WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
  (F) THE COURT MAY ENTER AN INTERIM ORDER  CONCERNING  CONTACT  BETWEEN
 THE  CHILD AND A PERSON WITH STANDING SEEKING ADJUDICATION UNDER SECTION
 582-103 OF THIS PART AS A PARENT OF THE CHILD.
  (G) ANY PERSON ADJUDICATED TO BE A DE FACTO PARENT OF  A  CHILD  UNDER
 THIS  SECTION  SHALL  HAVE  ALL THE LEGAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF
 PARENTAGE UNDER NEW YORK LAW, INCLUDING THE OBLIGATION  TO  SUPPORT  THE
 CHILD.

 § 582-105. ADJUDICATING COMPETING CLAIMS OF PARENTAGE. (A) IN A PROCEED-
 ING TO ADJUDICATE COMPETING CLAIMS OF PARENTAGE OF A  CHILD  BY  TWO  OR
 MORE  INDIVIDUALS,  THE  COURT  SHALL  ADJUDICATE  PARENTAGE IN THE BEST
 INTEREST OF THE CHILD, BASED ON:

 UAL;

 AND
  (6) OTHER  EQUITABLE  FACTORS  ARISING  FROM  THE  DISRUPTION  OF  THE
 RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN THE CHILD AND EACH INDIVIDUAL OR THE LIKELIHOOD OF
 OTHER HARM TO THE CHILD.
  (B) THE INTEREST THAT A CHILD MAY HAVE IN FORMING A RELATIONSHIP  WITH
 A  GENETIC  PARENT  SHALL NOT BE GIVEN CONCLUSIVE WEIGHT IN ADJUDICATING
 COMPETING CLAIMS OF PARENTAGE, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE IS NO PREEXISTING
 SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GENETIC PARENT AND THE CHILD.
  (C) IN A PROCEEDING TO ADJUDICATE PARENTAGE OF A PERSON WHO CLAIMS  TO
 BE  A  DE  FACTO  PARENT  OF  THE CHILD, IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE OTHER
 PERSON WHO IS A PARENT OR HAS A CLAIM TO PARENTAGE OF THE CHILD AND  THE
 COURT  DETERMINES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION AND SECTION 582-
 103 OF THIS ARTICLE ARE SATISFIED, THE COURT SHALL  AWARD  PARENTAGE  TO
 THE  PERSON  CLAIMING TO BE A DE FACTO PARENT, PROVIDED THE ADJUDICATION
 OF A PERSON AS A PARENT UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL  NOT  DISESTABLISH  THE
 PARENTAGE OF ANY OTHER PARENT, NOR LIMIT ANY OTHER PARENT'S RIGHTS UNDER
 THE LAWS OF THIS STATE.
  §  582-106.  JUDGMENT  OF PARENTAGE FOR A CHILD WITH MULTIPLE PARENTS.
 THE COURT MAY ADJUDICATE A CHILD TO HAVE MORE THAN TWO  PARENTS  IF  THE
 COURT  FINDS  THAT  FAILURE  TO RECOGNIZE MORE THAN TWO PARENTS WOULD BE
 DETRIMENTAL TO THE CHILD. A FINDING OF DETRIMENT TO THE CHILD SHALL  NOT
 REQUIRE  A FINDING OF UNFITNESS OF ANY PARENT OR PERSON SEEKING AN ADJU-
 DICATION OF PARENTAGE. IN DETERMINING DETRIMENT TO THE CHILD, THE  COURT
 SHALL CONSIDER ALL RELEVANT FACTORS, INCLUDING:
  (A)  THE  HARM  IF THE CHILD IS REMOVED FROM A STABLE PLACEMENT WITH A
 PERSON WHO HAS FULFILLED THE CHILD'S PHYSICAL  NEEDS  AND  PSYCHOLOGICAL
 NEEDS  FOR CARE AND AFFECTION AND HAS ASSUMED THE ROLE SINCE THE CHILD'S
 BIRTH OR FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD;
  (B) THE HARM IF THE CHILD IS SEPARATED FROM A PERSON THE CHILD  UNDER-
 STANDS TO BE THEIR PARENT; AND
  (C)  THE INTENTION OF ALL PARENTS TO RAISE A CHILD TOGETHER, INCLUDING
 A PRE-CONCEPTION AGREEMENT TO PARENT OR AGREEMENT TO PARENT AT ANY OTHER
 POINT IN THE CHILD'S LIFE.
  § 4. Subdivision (a) of section 70 of the domestic relations  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  457  of  the  laws  of 1988, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (a) Where a minor child is residing within this  state,  [either]  ANY
 parent  may  apply  to  the supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus to
 have such minor child brought before such court; and on the return ther-
 eof, the court, on due consideration, may award  the  natural  guardian-
 ship,  charge  and custody of such child to [either] ANY parent for such
 time, under such regulations and restrictions, and with such  provisions
 and  directions, as the case may require, and may at any time thereafter
 vacate or modify such order. In all cases there shall be no prima  facie
 right  to the custody of the child in [either] ANY parent, but the court
 shall determine solely what is for the best interest of the  child,  and
 what will best promote its welfare and happiness, and make award accord-
 ingly.  WHERE A COURT DEEMS IT TO BE IN THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST, THE
 COURT MAY AWARD CUSTODY TO MORE THAN TWO PARENTS.
  § 5. Subparagraphs 2 and 4 of paragraph (a), clause (vi)  of  subpara-
 graph  5  of  paragraph  (c), subparagraphs 6 and 7 of paragraph (f) and
 paragraphs (g), (i) and (j) of subdivision 1 and  paragraph  a  and  the
 opening  paragraph and subparagraph 1 of paragraph b of subdivision 3 of
 A. 10259  7

 (a)  and  subparagraphs  6  and  7  of paragraph (f) of subdivision 1 as
 amended by chapter 567 of the laws of 1989, clause (vi) of  subparagraph
 5  of paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 as added by chapter 215 of the laws
 of 2009, paragraphs (g) and (i) of subdivision 1 as amended  by  chapter
 436  of  the  laws of 2011, paragraph (j) of subdivision 1 as amended by
 chapter 59 of the laws of 1993, and paragraph a and  the  opening  para-
 graph  and  subparagraph 1 of paragraph b of subdivision 3 as amended by
 chapter 398 of the laws of 1997, are amended to read as follows:
  (2) "Child support" shall mean a sum to  be  paid  pursuant  to  court
 order or decree by [either or both parents] ONE OR MORE PARENT or pursu-
 ant  to  a valid agreement between the parties for care, maintenance and
 education of any unemancipated child under the age of twenty-one years.
  (4) "Combined parental income" shall mean the sum  of  the  income  of
 [both] ALL parents.
  (vi) Upon proof by [either] ANY party that cash medical support pursu-
 ant  to  clause  (ii),  (iii), (iv) or (v) of this subparagraph would be
 unjust or inappropriate pursuant to paragraph (f)  of  THIS  subdivision
 [one of this section], the court shall:
  (6) The educational needs of [either] ANY parent;
  (7)  A  determination  that  the gross income of one OR MORE parent is
 substantially less than [the other] ONE  OR  MORE  OF  ANOTHER  parent's
 gross income;
  (g)  Where  the  court  finds that the non-custodial parent's pro rata
 share of the basic child support obligation is unjust or  inappropriate,
 the  court  shall  order  the non-custodial parent to pay such amount of
 child support as the court finds just and  appropriate,  and  the  court
 shall  set  forth,  in  a  written order, the factors it considered; the
 amount of each party's pro rata share of the basic child  support  obli-
 gation;  and  the  reasons  that the court did not order the basic child
 support obligation. Such written order may not be waived by [either] ANY
 party or counsel;  provided,  however,  and  notwithstanding  any  other
 provision  of  law,  including  but  not limited to section four hundred
 fifteen of this part, the court shall not find  that  the  non-custodial
 parent's pro rata share of such obligation is unjust or inappropriate on
 the  basis  that  such  share exceeds the portion of a public assistance
 grant which is attributable to a child or children. Where the non-custo-
 dial parent's income is less than or equal to the poverty income  guide-
 lines  amount  for a single person as reported by the federal department
 of health and human services, unpaid child support arrears in excess  of
 five hundred dollars shall not accrue.
  (i)  Where  [either or both] ANY OF THE parties are unrepresented, the
 court shall not enter an order or judgment other than a temporary  order
 pursuant  to  section two hundred thirty-seven of the domestic relations
 law, that includes a provision for child  support  unless  the  unrepre-
 sented party or parties have received a copy of the child support stand-
 ards  chart  promulgated  by the commissioner of the office of temporary
 and disability assistance pursuant to subdivision  two  of  section  one
 hundred eleven-i of the social services law. Where [either] ANY party is
 in  receipt  of  child  support  enforcement  services through the local
 social services district,  the  local  social  services  district  child
 support  enforcement  unit shall advise such party of the amount derived
 from application of the child support percentage and  that  such  amount
 serves  as  a  starting point for the determination of the child support
 award, and shall provide such party with a copy  of  the  child  support
 standards chart.
 A. 10259  8
 
  (j)  In  addition  to  financial  disclosure  required in section four
 hundred twenty-four-a of this article, the court may  require  that  the
 income and/or expenses of [either] ANY party be verified with documenta-
 tion including, but not limited to, past and present income tax returns,
 employer  statements,  pay  stubs,  corporate,  business, or partnership
 books and records, corporate and business tax returns, and receipts  for
 expenses  or  such  other  means of verification as the court determines
 appropriate. Nothing herein shall affect any  party's  right  to  pursue
 discovery pursuant to this chapter, the civil practice law and rules, or
 the family court act.
  a. One-time adjustment of child support orders issued prior to Septem-
 ber  fifteenth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine.  Any  party  to a child
 support order issued prior  to  September  fifteenth,  nineteen  hundred
 eighty-nine  on the behalf of a child in receipt of public assistance or
 child support services pursuant to section one hundred eleven-g  of  the
 social  services law may request that the support collection unit under-
 take one review of the order for adjustment purposes pursuant to section
 one hundred eleven-h of the  social  services  law.  A  hearing  on  the
 adjustment of such order shall be granted upon the objection of [either]
 ANY  party pursuant to the provisions of this section. An order shall be
 adjusted if as of the date of the support collection  unit's  review  of
 the  correct  amount  of  child  support  as  calculated pursuant to the
 provisions of this section would deviate by at least  ten  percent  from
 the  child  support  ordered  in the last permanent support order of the
 court. Additionally, a new support order shall be issued upon a  showing
 that  the  current order of support does not provide for the health care
 needs of the child through insurance or otherwise.  Eligibility  of  the
 child  for  medical  assistance  shall  not  relieve  any obligation the
 parties otherwise have to provide for  the  health  care  needs  of  the
 child.  The  support  collection  unit's review of a child support order
 shall be made on notice to all parties to the current support order  and
 shall be subject to the provisions of section four hundred twenty-four-a
 of  this  article.  Nothing  herein shall be deemed in any way to limit,
 restrict, expand or impair the rights of any party to file for a modifi-
 cation of a child support order as is otherwise provided by law.
  Upon receipt of an adjustment finding and where appropriate a proposed
 order in conformity with such finding filed by [either] ANY party or  by
 the  support  collection  unit, a party shall have thirty-five days from
 the date of mailing of the  adjustment  finding  and  proposed  adjusted
 order,  if any, to submit to the court identified thereon specific writ-
 ten objections to such finding and proposed order.
  (1) If specific written objections are submitted by [either] ANY party
 or by the support collection unit, a hearing shall be scheduled  by  the
 court  on  notice  to  the  parties and the support collection unit, who
 shall have the right to be heard by the court and to offer  evidence  in
 support of or in opposition to adjustment of the support order.
  §  6.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
 on or before such effective date.
