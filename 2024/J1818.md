  COMMENDING  Jean  Donald Mathieu upon the occasion
  of his designation as recipient of a Liberty  Medal,
  the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
  New York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
honor those distinguished citizens who  demonstrate  great  courage  and
diligence in providing for the care and welfare of the citizens of their
communities and this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Within every community of the State of New York, there are
certain individuals who, by virtue of their commitment  and  dedication,
command  the  respect  and  admiration  of  their  community  for  their
exemplary service on behalf of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Jean Donald Mathieu upon the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient  of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed upon an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established  by
Resolution  and  is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have merited special
commendation for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf  of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  Saturday,  February  3,  2024, Jean Donald Mathieu, of
Spring Valley, New York, was returning home after his  workday  when  he
witnessed  smoke  coming  from  a  multi-story apartment building in his
Rockland County neighborhood; and
 
  WHEREAS, Without hesitation, Jean  Donald  Mathieu  ran  toward  the
burning  residence,  climbed a tree, jumped over a metal fence, ascended
the smoking building's  narrow  fire  escape  ladder,  and  entered  the
apartment where the blaze originated; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  the  building's  residents  made their way through the
choking smoke in the hallways and descended the fire escape, Jean Donald
Mathieu rushed into the  apartment  where  he  observed  eight-month-old
Isabella  with  her  mother,  Katia, and a second woman who were trapped
inside the burning residence; as a husband and father  of  one  son,  he
immediately  responded to the crisis without concern for his own safety;
and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 75 firefighters from five  departments  responded
to the alarm that was issued and controlled the blaze within 20 minutes;
although  the  building's  tenants  escaped  the  fire,  two individuals
required medical attention for smoke inhalation, bringing  awareness  of
the potential tragedy to the residents of the neighborhood who recognize
the courage, compassion, and selflessness of Jean Donald Mathieu; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jean  Donald  Mathieu  has  been  revered  as an admirable
worker, named Employee of the Year twice during his  tenure  with  Venus
 
Laboratories,  Inc.,  since  he  was added to the company's workforce in
2012; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Featured in the corporation's "Employee Spotlight" for his
dependability, efficiency, and exemplary leadership  in  the  workplace,
Jean  Donald Mathieu has been heralded for his quality work, positivity,
productivity, and willingness to help  whenever  needed,  making  him  a
well-respected member of his community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A truly courageous man, Jean Donald Mathieu played a vital
role in this extraordinary rescue effort and should be  praised  by  the
people  of  this great Empire State for his astute actions in attempting
to preserve the lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, In his spontaneous and heroic act, Jean Donald Mathieu  has
so  aptly  demonstrated  his  character  and  compassion  for  others,
personifying, by virtue  of  his  actions,  the  collective  concern  of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond without thought of danger or reward when fellow constituents are
in need of aid; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
citizens who unselfishly assist and protect others are  worthy  and  due
full praise for their noble endeavors; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Jean Donald Mathieu upon the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient  of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed upon an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
