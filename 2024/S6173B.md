 AN  ACT  to  amend  the election law and the vehicle and traffic law, in
  relation to joining multistate voter list maintenance organizations
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent.  As the official record of
 all  eligible  voters in a state, a state's voter registration rolls are
 the foundation of free, fair, and accurate elections. Illegal voting  is
 exceedingly rare but maintaining accurate voter rolls reduces the oppor-
 tunity  for  such  behavior  and  it  helps build confidence in election
 outcomes. However, keeping  voter  rolls  up  to  date  is  a  challenge
 because, every day, voters move or die. Voters do not always remember to
 update their registration when they move. These challenges are especial-
 ly  acute  in  states  with large and highly mobile populations. Partic-
 ipation in a multistate voter list maintenance organization can  improve
 the  accuracy of New York's voter registration rolls. A multistate voter
 list maintenance organization is a coordinating  entity  between  states
 that  aids  them  in identifying voters who may no longer be eligible to
 vote, who have moved, or who have died. A voter list maintenance  organ-
 ization  may  also  offer  other  information  useful to improving voter
 registration or enhancing the integrity of election administration.
  § 2. Article 5 of the election law is amended by adding a new title 10
 to read as follows:
  TITLE X
  MULTISTATE VOTER LIST MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP AUTHORIZATION
 SECTION 5-1000. JOINING A MULTISTATE VOTER  LIST  MAINTENANCE  ORGANIZA-

  5-1002. AUTHORIZATION  TO SHARE REGISTRATION RECORDS WITH MULTI-
