 Introduced  by  Sen. SKOUFIS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Elections
 
 AN ACT to amend the election law and the vehicle  and  traffic  law,  in
  relation to joining multistate voter list maintenance organizations
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. A  multistate  voter  list
 maintenance  organization  is  a  coordinating entity between the states
 that aids them in removing ineligible voters from their voter rolls. The
 Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) is  a  public  charity
 non-profit membership organization comprising 32 states and the District
 of Columbia. ERIC's purpose is to assist states in improving the accura-
 cy  of America's voter rolls and increasing access to voter registration
 for all eligible citizens. Keeping voter rolls up to date is a challenge
 because, every day, voters move or pass away. Voters don't always remem-
 ber to update their registration. At least every 60  days,  each  member
 submits  their  voter registration data and licensing and identification
 data from departments of motor vehicles (DMV) to ERIC.  ERIC refers  to
 this data as Member Data. ERIC's technical staff uses sophisticated data
 matching  software  to compare Member Data from all member states, some-
 times with data from other sources, to create the following  four  "list
 maintenance"  reports. (1) Cross-State Movers Report:  Identifies voters
 who appear to have moved from one ERIC  state  to  another  using  voter
 registration  data and DMV data; (2) In-State Movers Report:  Identifies
 voters who appear to have moved within the state using  voter  registra-
 tion  and department of motor vehicle data; (3) Duplicate Report:  Iden-
 tifies voters with duplicate registrations in the same state using voter
 registration data; and (4) Deceased Report: Identifies voters  who  have
 died  using voter registration data and Social Security death data known
 as the Limited Access Death Master File. As the official record  of  all
 eligible  voters  in a state, a state's voter registration rolls are the

 foundation of free, fair, and  accurate  elections.  Illegal  voting  is
 exceedingly rare but maintaining accurate voter rolls reduces the oppor-
 tunity  for  such  behavior  and  it  helps build confidence in election
 outcomes.
