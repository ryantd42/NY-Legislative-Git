 FOR AT LEAST TWELVE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS  PRIOR  TO  THE  DATE  OF  MAKING

 DEATH  OF  EITHER  A HUSBAND OR WIFE IN WHOSE NAME TITLE OF THE PROPERTY
 SHALL HAVE BEEN VESTED AT THE TIME OF  DEATH  AND  THEN  BECOMES  VESTED
 SOLELY  IN  THE  SURVIVOR  BY  VIRTUE  OF  DEVISE BY OR DESCENT FROM THE
 DECEASED HUSBAND OR WIFE, THE TIME OF OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY  BY  THE
 DECEASED HUSBAND OR WIFE SHALL BE DEEMED ALSO A TIME OF OWNERSHIP BY THE
 SURVIVOR  AND SUCH OWNERSHIP SHALL BE DEEMED CONTINUOUS FOR THE PURPOSES

 SHALL BE DEEMED TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT OF THIS  PARAGRAPH  THAT  THE
 TITLE  OF THE PROPERTY SHALL HAVE BEEN VESTED IN THE OWNER OR ONE OF THE
 OWNERS FOR SUCH PERIOD OF TWELVE  CONSECUTIVE  MONTHS.  WHERE,  UPON  OR
 SUBSEQUENT  TO  THE DEATH OF AN OWNER OR OWNERS, TITLE TO PROPERTY WHICH
 AS OF THE DATE OF  SUCH  DEATH  WAS  EXEMPT  FROM  TAXATION  UNDER  SUCH
 PROVISIONS,  BECOMES  VESTED,  BY  VIRTUE  OF DEVISE OR DESCENT FROM THE
 DECEASED OWNER OR OWNERS, OR BY TRANSFER BY ANY OTHER MEANS WITHIN  NINE
 MONTHS  AFTER SUCH DEATH, SOLELY IN A PERSON OR PERSONS WHO, AT THE TIME
 OF SUCH DEATH, MAINTAINED SUCH PROPERTY  AS  A  PRIMARY  RESIDENCE,  THE
 REQUIREMENT  OF THIS PARAGRAPH THAT THE TITLE OF THE PROPERTY SHALL HAVE
 BEEN VESTED IN THE OWNER OR ONE OF THE OWNERS FOR SUCH PERIOD OF  TWELVE
 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS SHALL BE DEEMED SATISFIED;
  (B)  UNLESS THE PROPERTY IS USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES,
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE EVENT ANY PORTION OF SUCH PROPERTY IS NOT
 SO USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESIDENTIAL  PURPOSES  BUT  IS  USED  FOR  OTHER
 PURPOSES,  SUCH  PORTION  SHALL BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION AND THE REMAINING
 PORTION ONLY SHALL  BE  ENTITLED  TO  THE  EXEMPTION  PROVIDED  BY  THIS
