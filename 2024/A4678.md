 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation  to  authorizing
  the state of New York mortgage agency to purchase rehabilitation mort-
  gages
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 2402 of the public authorities law  is  amended  by
 adding two new subdivisions 18 and 19 to read as follows:
  (18) "REHABILITATION". REPAIRS, ALTERATIONS OR IMPROVEMENTS OF A HOUS-
 ING ACCOMMODATION DESIGNED TO RAISE THE HOUSING STANDARDS THEREIN.
  (19)  "REHABILITATION MORTGAGE". A LOAN EXTENDED BY A BANK, SECURED BY
 A MORTGAGE ON REAL PROPERTY IMPROVED BY A RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE FOR  THE
 FINANCING  AND REHABILITATION OF SUCH RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE WHICH OTHER-
 WISE COMPLIES WITH THE CONDITIONS  ESTABLISHED  BY  SECTION  TWENTY-FOUR
 HUNDRED FIVE-G OF THIS PART.
  §  2.  The  public  authorities law is amended by adding a new section
 2405-g to read as follows:
  § 2405-G. PURCHASE OF REHABILITATION MORTGAGES.  (1) A PURPOSE OF  THE
 AGENCY  SHALL  BE TO PURCHASE REHABILITATION MORTGAGES FROM BANKS WITHIN

 AVAILABLE  FOR  NEW RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES OR AVAILABLE FOR SUCH LOANS AT
 CARRYING CHARGES WITHIN THE FINANCIAL MEANS OF PERSONS AND  FAMILIES  OF
 LOW AND MODERATE INCOME.
  IT  IS  HEREBY  FOUND  AND DECLARED THAT SUCH ACTIVITIES BY THE AGENCY
 WILL ALLEVIATE A CONDITION IN THIS STATE WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC
 HEALTH, SAFETY AND GENERAL WELFARE AND WHICH HAS CONSTITUTED IN THE PAST
 AND FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE CAN  BE  EXPECTED  TO  CONSTITUTE  A
 PUBLIC  EMERGENCY.  IT  IS FURTHER FOUND AND DECLARED THAT SUCH PURPOSES
 ARE IN ALL RESPECTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE  STATE  OF  NEW

 MENTAL  FUNCTION  IN  CARRYING  OUT  ITS  PURPOSES AND IN EXERCISING THE
 POWERS GRANTED BY THIS TITLE.
  (2) (A) THE AGENCY SHALL REQUIRE THAT REHABILITATION MORTGAGES PROVIDE

 PERCENT OF THE MORTGAGOR'S ADJUSTED BASIS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL  PROP-
 ERTY (INCLUDING LAND).
  (B) SUCH REHABILITATION MORTGAGES SHALL ALSO PROVIDE THAT THE PURCHASE
 PRICE  PLUS  THE  ESTIMATED COST OF THE REPAIRS MUST FALL WITHIN CURRENT
 AGENCY REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO MAXIMUM PURCHASE PRICE. TO BE  ELIGIBLE
 FOR  SUCH  MORTGAGES AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS MUST HAVE ELAPSED BETWEEN THE

 GAGES, (I) AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT OF THE EXISTING EXTERNAL WALLS OF  THE
 RESIDENTIAL  STRUCTURE MUST BE RETAINED IN PLACE AS EXTERNAL WALLS, (II)

 FROM  A BANK AT ANY ONE TIME SHALL IN NO EVENT BE MORE THAN THE TOTAL OF
 THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCES THEREOF, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST THEREON.
  (4) IN CONDUCTING ITS PROGRAM OF PURCHASING REHABILITATION  MORTGAGES,
 THE  AGENCY  SHALL  BE  GOVERNED  BY  THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF
 SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION TWENTY-FOUR HUNDRED FIVE OF THIS PART.

 TATION  MORTGAGES  FROM BANKS THAT EACH SUCH BANK CERTIFY THAT EACH SUCH

 AVAILABLE MONIES, TO PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ITS BONDS AND NOTES, AND
 REHABILITATION  MORTGAGES BEARING SUCH INTEREST RATE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED
 TO VIOLATE ANY SUCH LAW OR TO BE UNENFORCEABLE IF ORIGINATED BY  A  BANK
 IN GOOD FAITH PURSUANT TO AN UNDERTAKING WITH THE AGENCY WITH RESPECT TO
 THE SALE THEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING ANY SUBSEQUENT FAILURE OF THE AGENCY TO
