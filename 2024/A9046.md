 nents of treatment that serve to promote and maintain recovery.

 A. 9046  8
 
 of  this act. Such regulations shall prohibit practices which are likely
 to prevent any person from asserting any right or remedy granted by this

 renewal leases, additional rent and such  related  matters  as  security
 deposits, advance rental payments, the use of escalator clauses in leas-
 es and provision for increase in rentals for garages and other ancillary
 facilities,  so  as to ensure that the level of rent adjustments author-
 ized under this law will not be  subverted  and  made  ineffective.  Any

 lease on grounds that the owner seeks to recover possession of a housing
 accommodation for his or her own use and occupancy or for  the  use  and
 occupancy  of  his or her immediate family shall permit recovery of only

 under  this  subdivision  shall  have  a cause of action in any court of
 competent jurisdiction for damages, declaratory, and  injunctive  relief
 against  a  landlord or purchaser of the premises who makes a fraudulent
 statement regarding a proposed use of the housing accommodation. In  any
 action  or  proceeding brought pursuant to this subdivision a prevailing
 tenant shall be entitled to recovery of actual damages,  and  reasonable
 attorneys' fees.
