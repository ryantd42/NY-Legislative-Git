  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 16, 2024, as Global Accessibility Awareness  Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  By some estimates, as many as 2.6 billion people take part
in digital gaming, a significant fraction of the global population; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the past decades, video games have become a mainstream
form of entertainment, currently eclipsing Hollywood's box office sales;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Digital games are widely recognized as a popular, enjoyable
and even beneficial activity from which players can derive  a  sense  of
well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  popularity  of  games  increases,  so  making  games
accessible becomes even more important;  software  technology  is  often
difficult to access for players with disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  total number of people in the United States estimated
to have their  ability  to  play  games  affected  by  a  disability  is
32,213,000; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  New  York  State,  about  one  in  five  of the adult,
non-institutionalized population (about three million people) report  an
activity limitation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Video  games  can  be  tools for disabled gamers to create
rich, social experiences that they would not be able to have  otherwise;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  For those who cannot leave their homes, games are a way to
explore and go on adventures without going anywhere;  video  games  also
offer  a  chance for players to be on an equal playing field, regardless
of their disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over 40% of military service members reported playing video
games on a weekly basis; and
 
  WHEREAS, One out of every 10  veterans  alive  today  was  seriously
injured  at some point while serving in the military, and three-quarters
of those injuries occurred in combat; for  many  of  these  2.2  million
wounded  warriors,  the  physical  and  emotional  consequences of their
wounds have endured long after they left the  military,  which  includes
hampering their ability to enjoy long loved hobbies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Gaming can give newly disabled people a sense of normalcy;
gaming is one of the most popular activities for soldiers  stationed  in
Iraq and Afghanistan; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Adults may make up the majority of game players, but video
games are more popular than ever among kids; 91% of U.S.  children  ages
2-17 play video games; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  5%  of  children  in  the  U.S.  aged  5-15 have a form of
disability; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thursday, May 16, 2024, marks the 13th Global Accessibility
Awareness Day (GAAD), the purpose of which is to get  everyone  talking,
thinking,  and  learning  about digital access/inclusion and people with
different disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Includification is a phrase meant to convey  the  ideas  of
including  everyone  as an ongoing movement; game accessibility is not a
topic that can be solved with one answer, or decision by one entity, but
rather of movement by one segment of the video game community,  disabled
gamers,  asking to be fairly included in regards to access of mainstream
entertainment; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body would like to shine more awareness on
how accessibility should be considered in all endeavors, including video
games; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to Proclaim May 16, 2024, as Global
Accessibility Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the AbleGamers Foundation.
