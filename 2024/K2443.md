  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 2024, as Epilepsy Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months dedicated to raising  awareness  of  serious  conditions
impacting the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long- standing traditions, this Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as Epilepsy
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Epilepsy Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Epilepsy  is  a  neurological  disorder  characterized  by
seizures  that  consist  of sudden and synchronized bursts of electrical
energy that disrupt the brain's  normal  electrical  pattern;  it  is  a
spectrum  condition  with a wide range of seizure types and control that
varies from person to person; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  seizures  may  impact  consciousness,  movement  or
sensation, and create long-term effects on the lifestyles of individuals
with epilepsy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately  one-third  of  epilepsy  patients live with
uncontrolled seizures due to a lack  of  suitable  clinically  available
treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention estimates
that epilepsy impacts roughly  3.4  million  Americans  and  50  million
people worldwide; 1 in 26 people will develop epilepsy and approximately
50,000 people will die from an epilepsy-related cause; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Epilepsy  affects  more  people  than  multiple sclerosis,
cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy  and  Parkinson's  combined;  in  the
United  States,  200,000  new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed each year;
and
 
  WHEREAS, While anyone can develop epilepsy at any age,  some  common
risk  factors  include  babies  who are born small for their age or with
abnormal areas in the brain, babies who have seizures in the first month
of their life, and people with serious brain injury or lack of oxygen to
the brain, brain tumors, infections of the brain, cerebral palsy, family
history of seizures, Alzheimer's disease (late in the  illness),  Autism
spectrum  disorder,  use  of  cocaine,  or  strokes  resulting  from the
blockage of arteries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  United  States,  epilepsy  affects  approximately
470,000 children 17 years or younger, and approximately 3 million adults
aged 18 and up have epilepsy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than  570,000  adults  aged  65  and  older have the
condition, as the number of epilepsy cases in the elderly is  increasing
with the baby boom generation reaching retirement age; and
 
  WHEREAS, It costs the United States approximately $15.5 billion each
year in caring for and treating epilepsy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While medications and other treatments help many people of
all ages who live with epilepsy, more than a million people continue  to
have  seizures  that  can  severely  limit  their  school  achievements,
employment prospects and participation in all of life's experiences; and
 
  WHEREAS, Even with the roughly 150,000 new cases of epilepsy in  the
United  States  each  year,  epilepsy  continues  to  be  one  of  least
understood major chronic medical conditions; thus, it is the hope that a
month of awareness in New York State and beyond will  make  for  greater
public  awareness  and  increase  the  activity  at the local, state and
national level; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as Epilepsy
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and the Epilepsy Foundation.
