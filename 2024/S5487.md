 reduction  of positions occurs, subject to the provisions of subdivision
 seven of section eighty-five of this chapter;  provided,  however,  that
 the  date  of  original appointment of any such incumbent who was trans-
 ferred  to  such  governmental  jurisdiction  from  another governmental
 jurisdiction upon the  transfer  of  functions  shall  be  the  date  of
 original  appointment  on a permanent basis in the classified service in
 the service of the governmental jurisdiction from  which  such  transfer
 was  made.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, however,
 upon the abolition or reduction of positions in the competitive, NONCOM-
 PETITIVE OR LABOR class, incumbents holding the same  or  similar  posi-
 tions  IN  THE  SAME  JURISDICTIONAL  CLASS who have not completed their
 probationary service shall be suspended or demoted, as the case may  be,
 before  any  permanent incumbents, and among such probationary employees
 the order of suspension or demotion  shall  be  determined  as  if  such
 employees were permanent incumbents.
  1-a.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  one  of  this
 section, the members of a police or paid fire department in the city  of
 Buffalo  shall  be subject to the following procedure. Where, because of
 economy, consolidation or abolition of functions, curtailment of  activ-
 ities  or  otherwise,  positions  in  the competitive, NONCOMPETITIVE OR
 LABOR class are abolished or reduced in rank or salary grade, suspension
 or demotion, as the case may be, among incumbents holding  the  same  or
 similar  positions IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS shall be made in the
 inverse order of original appointment on a permanent basis in the  grade
 or  title  in the service of the governmental jurisdiction in which such
 abolition or reduction of positions occurs, subject to the provisions of
 subdivision seven of section eighty-five of this chapter.  Notwithstand-
 ing the provisions of this subdivision, however, upon the  abolition  or
 reduction  of  positions  in  the  competitive,  NONCOMPETITIVE OR LABOR
 class, incumbents holding the same or  similar  positions  IN  THE  SAME
 JURISDICTIONAL  who  have not completed their probationary service shall
 be suspended or demoted, as the case may be, before any permanent incum-
 bents, and among such probationary employees the order of suspension  or
 demotion  shall be determined as if such employees were permanent incum-
 bents.
  1-b.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  one  of  this
 section,  employees  of  secure  detention facilities in the city of New
 York and of the alternatives to secure detention facilities  program  in
 such city who are performing functions which were assumed by the depart-
 ment  of  social  services  of  the city of New York on the tenth day of
 November, nineteen hundred seventy-one and  who,  upon  such  assumption
 were  transferred  to said department, shall be subject to the following
 procedure. Where, because of  economy,  consolidation  or  abolition  of
 function,  curtailment  of  activities  or  otherwise,  positions in the
 competitive, NONCOMPETITIVE OR LABOR class are abolished, or reduced  in
 rank  or salary grade, suspension or demotion, as the case may be, among
 incumbents holding the same or similar positions IN THE  SAME  JURISDIC-
 TIONAL  CLASS shall be made in the inverse order of original appointment
 on a permanent basis in the classified service in  the  service  of  the
 governmental  jurisdiction in which such abolition or reduction of posi-
 tions occurs, subject to the provisions of subdivision seven of  section
 eighty-five  of  this  chapter; provided, however, that if any person so
 employed and so transferred was employed on a permanent basis in such  a
 facility  or  such program prior to the thirtieth day of December, nine-
 teen hundred sixty-seven, for purposes  of  this  subdivision  regarding
 priority  of  retention  and  for no other purpose, the date of original
 S. 5487  3
 
 appointment of any such person shall be  deemed  to  be  the  date  such
 permanent employment commenced prior to the said thirtieth day of Decem-
 ber, nineteen hundred sixty-seven.
  1-c.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  one  of  this
 section, sworn employees of the Monroe county sheriff's department shall
 be subject to  the  following  procedure.  Where,  because  of  economy,
 consolidation  or  abolition  of  function, curtailment of activities or
 otherwise, positions in the competitive, NONCOMPETITIVE OR  LABOR  class
 are  abolished,  or  reduced  in  rank  or  salary  grade, suspension or
 demotion, as the case may be, among incumbents holding the same or simi-
 lar positions IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS  shall  be  made  in  the
 inverse  order of original appointment on a permanent basis in the grade
 or title in the service of the governmental jurisdiction in  which  such
 abolition or reduction of positions occurs, subject to the provisions of
 subdivision  seven  of  section  eighty-five  of this chapter; provided,
 however, that if any person so employed was employed  in  such  person's
 current  title prior to the first day of April, nineteen hundred ninety-
 three, for purposes of this subdivision regarding priority of  retention
 and  for  no other purpose, the date of original appointment of any such
 person shall be deemed to be the date such employment commenced prior to
 the said first day of April, nineteen hundred ninety-three.
  1-d.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  one  of  this
 section,  the  sworn members of the police force of the county of Nassau
 shall be subject to the following procedure. Where, because of  economy,
 consolidation  or  abolition  of functions, curtailment of activities or
 otherwise, positions in the competitive, NONCOMPETITIVE OR  LABOR  class
 are  abolished  or  reduced  in  rank  or  salary  grade,  suspension or
 demotion, as the case may be, among incumbents holding the same or simi-
 lar positions IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS  shall  be  made  in  the
 inverse  order of original appointment on a permanent basis in the grade
 or title in the service of the governmental jurisdiction in  which  such
 abolition or reduction of positions occurs, subject to the provisions of
 subdivision seven of section eighty-five of this chapter.  Notwithstand-
 ing  the  provisions of this subdivision, however, upon the abolition or
 reduction of positions, those employees who  have  not  completed  their
 probationary  service shall be suspended or demoted, as the case may be,
 before any permanent incumbents, and among such  probationary  employees
 the  order  of  suspension  or  demotion  shall be determined as if such
 employees were permanent incumbents.
  2. Continuous service. Except as otherwise provided  herein,  for  the
 purposes  of this section the original appointment of an incumbent shall
 mean the date of [his] THEIR first appointment on a permanent  basis  in
 the  classified service followed by continuous service in the classified
 service on a permanent  basis  up  to  the  time  of  the  abolition  or
 reduction  of  the competitive, NONCOMPETITIVE OR LABOR class positions.
 An employee who has resigned and who has been reinstated or  reappointed
 in  the  service  within  one year thereafter shall, for the purposes of
 this section, be deemed to have continuous service. An employee who  has
 been  terminated  because  of  a  disability resulting from occupational
 injury or disease as defined in the  [workmen's]  WORKERS'  compensation
 law and who has been reinstated or reappointed in the service thereafter
 shall  be deemed to have continuous service. A period of employment on a
 temporary or provisional basis, or in the  unclassified  service,  imme-
 diately  preceded  and  followed  by permanent service in the classified
 service, shall not constitute an interruption of continuous service  for
 the  purposes  of  this  section; nor shall a period of leave of absence
 S. 5487  4
 
 without pay pursuant to law or the rules of the civil service commission
 having jurisdiction, or any period during which an employee is suspended
 from [his] THEIR position pursuant to this section, constitute an inter-
 ruption of continuous service for the purposes of this section.
  4. Units for suspension or demotion in civil divisions. Upon the abol-
 ition  or  reduction  of  positions  in the service of a civil division,
 suspension or demotion shall be made from among  employees  holding  the
 same or similar positions IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS in the entire
 department  or  agency within which such abolition or reduction of posi-
 tions occurs. In a city having a population of one million or more,  the
 municipal  civil  service commission may, by rule, designate as separate
 units for suspension and demotion under the provisions of  this  section
 any  hospital or institution or any division of any department or agency
 under its jurisdiction. Upon the abolition or reduction of positions  in
 such  service, suspension or demotion, as the case may be, shall be made
 from among employees holding the same or similar positions IN  THE  SAME
 JURISDICTIONAL  CLASS  in  the  department  wherein  such  abolition  or
 reduction occurs, except that where such abolition or  reduction  occurs
 in  such  hospital or institution or division of a department designated
 as a separate unit for suspension or demotion,  suspension  or  demotion
 shall  be  made  from among incumbents holding the same or similar posi-
 tions IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS in such separate unit.
  5. Units for suspension or demotion in the state service.  The  presi-
 dent  may,  by regulation, designate as separate units for suspension or
 demotion under the provisions of this section any state hospital, insti-
 tution or facility or any division of any state department or agency  or
 specified  hospitals,  institutions  and  facilities  of  a single state
 department or agency within a particular geographic area  as  determined
 by  the  president.  Upon the abolition or reduction of positions IN THE
 SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS in the state service, suspension or  demotion,
 as  the case may be, shall be made from among employees holding the same
 or similar  positions  in  the  department  wherein  such  abolition  or
 reduction  occurs,  except that where such abolition or reduction occurs
 in a separate unit for suspension or demotion designated  by  regulation
 of the president, suspension or demotion shall be made from among incum-
 bents holding the same or similar positions in such separate unit.
  6.  Displacement  in civil divisions. A permanent incumbent of a posi-
 tion in a civil division in a specific title to which there is a  direct
 line  of  promotion  who  is  suspended  or  displaced  pursuant to this
 section, together with all other such incumbents suspended or  displaced
 at  the  same time, shall displace, in the inverse order of the order of
 suspension or demotion prescribed in subdivisions one and  two  of  this
 section,  incumbents  serving  in positions in the same [lay-off] LAYOFF
 unit in the next lower occupied title in direct line  of  promotion  who
 shall  be displaced in the order of suspension or demotion prescribed in
 subdivisions one and two of this section;  provided,  however,  that  no
 incumbent  shall  displace  any other incumbent having greater retention
 standing IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS.  If a permanent incumbent  of
 a position in a civil division is suspended or displaced from a position
 in  a  title  for  which  there are no lower level occupied positions in
 direct line of promotion, [he] THEY shall displace  the  incumbent  with
 the  least  retention right pursuant to subdivisions one and two of this
 section who is serving in a position in the title in which the  displac-
 ing  incumbent  last served on a permanent basis prior to service in one
 or more positions in the title from which [he is] THEY ARE suspended  or
 displaced, if: (1) the service of the displacing incumbent while in such
 S. 5487  5

 former  title was satisfactory and (2) the position of the junior incum-
 bent is in (a) the competitive, NONCOMPETITIVE OR LABOR class,  (b)  the
 layoff  unit  from  which  the  displacing  incumbent  was  suspended or
 displaced, and (c) a lower salary grade than the position from which the
 displacing  incumbent is suspended or displaced; provided, however, that
 no incumbent shall displace any other incumbent having greater retention
 standing IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS.  Refusal of appointment to  a
 position afforded by this subdivision constitutes waiver of rights under
 this  subdivision  with  respect  to  the  suspension or displacement on
 account of which the refused  appointment  is  afforded.  The  municipal
 civil service commission shall promulgate rules to implement this subdi-
 vision  including  rules  which may provide adjunctive opportunities for
 displacement either to positions in  direct  line  of  promotion  or  to
 formerly  held  positions;  provided,  however,  that no such rule shall
 permit an incumbent to  displace  any  other  incumbent  having  greater
 retention standing IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS.  For the purpose of
 acquiring  preferred list rights, displacement pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion is the equivalent of suspension or demotion pursuant to subdivision
 one of this section.
  7. Displacement in the state service. A permanent incumbent of a posi-
 tion in the state service in a specific title to which there is a direct
 line of promotion  who  is  suspended  or  displaced  pursuant  to  this
 section,  together with all other such incumbents suspended or displaced
 at the same time, shall displace, in the inverse order of the  order  of
 suspension  or  demotion  prescribed in subdivisions one and two of this
 section, incumbents serving in positions in the same layoff unit in  the
 next  lower  occupied  title  in  direct  line of promotion who shall be
 displaced in the order of suspension or demotion prescribed in  subdivi-
 sions  one and two of this section; provided, however, that no incumbent
 shall displace any other incumbent having greater retention standing  IN
 THE  SAME  JURISDICTIONAL CLASS.  If a permanent incumbent of a position
 in the state service is suspended or displaced  from  a  position  in  a
 title  for  which  there are no lower level occupied positions in direct
 line of promotion, [he] THEY shall displace the incumbent with the least
 retention right pursuant to subdivisions one and two of this section who
 is serving in a position in the title in which the displacing  incumbent
 last  served  on a permanent basis prior to service in one or more posi-
 tions in the title from which [he is] THEY ARE suspended  or  displaced,
 if:  (1)  the  service  of the displacing incumbent while in such former
 title was satisfactory and (2) the position of the junior  incumbent  is
 in  (a)  the  competitive, NONCOMPETITIVE OR LABOR class, (b) the layoff
 unit from which the displacing incumbent was suspended or displaced, and
 (c) a lower salary grade than the position  from  which  the  displacing
 incumbent  is  suspended or displaced; provided, however, that no incum-
 bent shall displace any other incumbent having greater retention  stand-
 ing IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS.  Refusal of appointment to a posi-
 tion  afforded  by  this  subdivision constitutes waiver of rights under
 this subdivision with respect  to  the  suspension  or  displacement  on
 account  of  which  the refused appointment is afforded. The state civil
 service commission shall promulgate rules to implement this  subdivision
 including rules which may provide adjunctive opportunities for displace-
 ment either to positions in direct line of promotion or to formerly held
 positions;  provided,  however, that no such rule shall permit an incum-
 bent to displace any other incumbent having greater  retention  standing
 IN  THE  SAME  JURISDICTIONAL  CLASS.  For  the  purpose  of acquiring
 preferred list rights, displacement pursuant to this subdivision is  the
 S. 5487  6
 
 equivalent of suspension or demotion pursuant to subdivision one of this
 section.
  (1)  Pursuant  to  such  method  of payment, such member shall pay, as
 additional member contributions  payable  besides  the  ordinary  member
 contributions due for [his] THEIR current service:
  (A)  the  ordinary member contributions which would have been done for
 such period of suspension if [he or  she]  THEY  had  actually  been  in
 service during such period; and
  (B)  (if  such  member  has elected the twenty-year retirement program
 provided for by section six hundred four-a of the retirement and  social
 security law), the additional member contributions which [he] THEY would
 have  been required to make under the provisions of that section for the
 period from the starting date of such program to the date next preceding
 the date on which such member became a participant  in  such  retirement
 program,  if  [he]  THEY  had become such a participant on such starting
 date; and
  (C) additional member contributions of two per centum of [his or  her]
 THEIR  compensation for the period beginning with the first full payroll
 period which includes the date of  enactment  of  this  subdivision  and
 ending  on  the earlier of his or her date of retirement or [his or her]
 THEIR completion of thirty years of service.
  9. Certain suspensions or demotions in  the  city  of  Niagara  Falls.
 Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision one of this section, the
 members of a paid fire department in the city of Niagara Falls shall  be
 subject  to  the following procedure. Where, because of economy, consol-
 idation or abolition of functions, curtailment of activities  or  other-
 wise,  positions  in  the competitive class are, NONCOMPETITIVE OR LABOR
 abolished or reduced in rank or salary grade, suspension or demotion, as
 the case may be, among incumbents holding the same or similar  positions
 IN  THE  SAME JURISDICTIONAL CLASS shall be made in the inverse order of
 original appointment on a permanent basis in the grade or title  in  the
 service  of  the  governmental  jurisdiction  in which such abolition or
 reduction of positions occurs, subject to the provisions of  subdivision
 seven  of  section  eighty-five  of  this chapter.  Notwithstanding the
 provisions of this subdivision, however, upon the abolition or reduction
 of positions in the competitive, NONCOMPETITIVE OR LABOR  class,  incum-
 bents  holding  the same or similar positions IN THE SAME JURISDICTIONAL
 CLASS who  have  not  completed  their  probationary  service  shall  be
 suspended  or  demoted,  as the case may be, before any permanent incum-
 bents, and among such probationary employees the order of suspension  or
 demotion  shall be determined as if such employees were permanent incum-
 bents.
  § 2. Section 80-a of the civil service law is REPEALED.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 81 of the civil service law, as  amended
 by chapter 152 of the laws of 2011, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  Establishment  of preferred lists; general provisions. The head of
 any department, office or institution in which an employee is  suspended
 or  demoted  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of [sections] SECTION
 eighty [and eighty-a] of this  title  shall,  upon  such  suspension  or
 demotion,  furnish  the  state  civil  service department or appropriate
 municipal commission, as the case may be, a statement showing his  name,
 title  or  position, date of appointment, and the date of and reason for
 suspension or demotion. It shall be  the  duty  of  such  civil  service
 department  or  commission,  as  the case may be, forthwith to place the
 name of such employee upon a preferred list, together  with  others  who
 may have been suspended or demoted from the same or similar positions in
 S. 5487  7
 
 the  same jurisdictional class, and to certify such list, as hereinafter
 provided, for filling vacancies in the same jurisdictional class; first,
 in the same or similar position; second, in  any  position  in  a  lower
 grade  in line of promotion; and third, in any comparable position. Such
 preferred list shall be certified for filling  a  vacancy  in  any  such
 position  before  certification is made from any other list, including a
 promotion eligible list, notwithstanding  the  fact  that  none  of  the
 persons  on  such  preferred  list  was suspended from or demoted in the
 department or suspension and demotion unit in which such vacancy exists.
 No other name shall be certified from any other list for any such  posi-
 tion  until  such preferred list is exhausted. The eligibility for rein-
 statement of a person whose name appears  on  any  such  preferred  list
 shall  not continue for a period longer than four years from the date of
 separation or demotion.  An  employee  whose  name  was  placed  on  the
 preferred list and at the time of such placement was on active duty with
 the  armed  forces of the United States, as pursuant to title ten, four-
 teen or thirty-two of the United States code, shall not be eligible  for
 employment  reinstatement  for a period longer than four years after the
 date of termination of military duty.
  § 4. Subdivisions 1 and 5 of section 81-a of the  civil  service  law,
 subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 140 of the laws of 1993 and subdivi-
 sion  5 as added by chapter 239 of the laws of 1992, are amended to read
 as follows:
  1. Establishment of reemployment rosters in the state service; general
 provisions. The head of any department, office or institution from which
 an employee in the state service  is  to  be  suspended  or  demoted  in
 accordance  with  the provisions of section eighty [or eighty-a] of this
 article, shall, at  least  twenty  days  prior  to  such  suspension  or
 demotion,  furnish  the  state civil service department with a statement
 showing such employee's name, title or position,  date  of  appointment,
 and the date of and reason for suspension or demotion. Upon such employ-
 ee's  suspension  or demotion, it shall be the duty of the department to
 place the name of such employee upon a reemployment roster  for  filling
 vacancies  in  any  comparable position as determined by the department,
 except that employees suspended or demoted from positions  in  the  non-
 competitive  and labor classes may not be certified to fill vacancies in
 the competitive class. Such reemployment roster shall be  certified  for
 filling a vacancy in any such position before certification is made from
 any  other list, including a promotion eligible list, but not prior to a
 preferred list. Eligibility for reinstatement of  a  person  whose  name
 appears on any such reemployment roster shall not continue for a  period
 longer than four years from the date of suspension or demotion provided,
 however,  in  no  event shall eligibility for reinstatement from a reem-
 ployment roster continue once the person is no longer eligible for rein-
 statement from a preferred list.
  5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the department
 may disqualify for reinstatement and remove from a  reemployment  roster
 the  name of any otherwise eligible person who, by reason of physical or
 mental incapacity, is found to be unable to satisfactorily  perform  the
 duties  of  the  position for which such roster has been established, or
 who has engaged in such misconduct as would warrant [his or  her]  THEIR
 dismissal  from  public  employment,  except  that  a  person who is not
 completely physically incapacitated and  who  is  suspended  or  demoted
 pursuant to section eighty [or eighty-a] of this article because [his or
 her]  THEIR position has been abolished or reduced, but who is certified
 for reinstatement to any position having the same physical  requirements
 S. 5487  8
 
 as  the  position from which such person was suspended or demoted, shall
 not be disqualified because of [his or  her]  THEIR  incapacity,  unless
 upon medical examination [his or her] THEIR incapacity has worsened to a
 degree that [he or she] THEY would not be able to satisfactorily perform
 in  such  position.  No  person  shall  be disqualified pursuant to this
 subdivision unless [he or she is] THEY ARE first given a written  state-
 ment of the reasons therefor and an opportunity to be heard at a hearing
 at  which  satisfactory  proof  of  such  reasons must be established by
 appropriate evidence, and at which such person may  present  independent
 evidence  and  be  entitled to representation by counsel. The department
 shall designate a person to hold such hearing and report thereon.
  § 5. Subdivision 1 of section  81-b  of  the  civil  service  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  140  of  the  laws  of 1993, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. Establishment of placement rosters in the  state  service;  general
 provisions.  The  head  of  any department, office or institution from

 mation  required  pursuant  to  section eighty-one-a of this article for
 purposes of establishing reemployment rosters, furnish the  state  civil
 service  department with a statement showing such employee's name, title
 or position, date of appointment, and the anticipated date of and reason
 for suspension or demotion. Upon receiving such information, it shall be
 the duty of the department forthwith to place the name of such  employee
 upon  a  placement  roster for filling vacancies in the same title or in
 any comparable position as determined by  the  department,  except  that
 employees  suspended  or demoted from positions in the [non-competitive]
 NONCOMPETITIVE and labor classes may not be certified to fill  vacancies
 in  the competitive class.  Such placement roster shall be certified for
 filling a vacancy in any such position before certification is made from
 any other list, including a promotion eligible list, but not prior to  a
 preferred  list or a reemployment roster. Eligibility for appointment of
 an employee whose name appears on any such placement roster shall termi-
 nate at such time as the employee is suspended or demoted in  accordance
 with  the  provisions  of  section eighty [or eighty-a] of this article.
 Upon such employee's suspension or demotion, the department shall  place
 the  name  of  such  employee  upon a preferred list, and a reemployment
 roster as appropriate, in accordance with  the  provisions  of  sections
 eighty-one and eighty-one-a of this article.
  §  6. Subdivision 7 of section 85 of the civil service law, as amended
 by chapter 532 of the laws of 1976, is amended to read as follows:

 any suspension, demotion or displacement shall be made  in  the  inverse
 order  of the date of original appointment in the service subject to the
 following conditions: (1) blind  employees  shall  be  granted  absolute
 preference  in  retention; (2) the date of such original appointment for
 disabled veterans shall be deemed to be sixty months  earlier  than  the
 actual date, determined in accordance with section thirty of the general
 construction law; (3) the date of such original appointment for non-dis-
 abled  veterans  shall  be  deemed  to be thirty months earlier than the
 actual date, determined in accordance with section thirty of the general
 S. 5487  9
 
 construction law; (4) no permanent competitive class employee subject to
 the jurisdiction of the civil service commission of the city of New York
 who receives an injury in the line of duty, as  defined  in  this  para-
 graph,  which  requires  immediate  hospitalization,  and  which  is not
 compensable through [workmen's] WORKERS' compensation may be  suspended,
 demoted  or  displaced pursuant to section eighty of this chapter within
 three months of the date  of  [his]  THEIR  confinement,  provided  that
 medical  authorities  approved by such commission shall certify that the
 employee is not able to perform the  duties  of  [his]  THEIR  position;
 provided  further,  that such three-month period may be extended by such
 commission for additional periods not to exceed one year each  upon  the
 certification  of  medical  authorities selected by such commission that
 the employee is, as a result of [his] THEIR injury, still  not  able  to
 perform  the  duties  of  [his] THEIR position. An injury in the line of
 duty, as used herein, shall be construed to  mean  an  injury  which  is
 incurred  as  a direct result of the lawful performance of the duties of
 the position. In determining whether an injury was received in the  line
 of  duty,  such commission shall require the head of the agency by which
 the employee is employed to certify that the injury was  received  as  a
 direct  result  of  the lawful performance of the employee's duties; and
 (5) the spouse of a veteran with one hundred percent  service  connected
 disability  shall  be  deemed to be sixty months earlier than the actual
 date, determined in  accordance  with  section  thirty  of  the  general
 construction  law,  provided,  the spouse is domiciled with the veteran-
 spouse and is the head of the  household.  This  section  shall  not  be
 construed  as conferring any additional benefit upon such employee other
 than a preference in retention. Such employee shall be subject to trans-
 fer upon the abolition of [his] THEIR function within [his] THEIR agency
 or department.

 the  name of any otherwise eligible person who, by reason of physical or
 mental incapacity, is found to be unable to satisfactorily  perform  the
 duties  of  the  position for which such roster has been established, or
 who has engaged in such misconduct as would warrant [his or  her]  THEIR
 dismissal  from  public  employment,  except  that  a  person who is not
 completely physically incapacitated and  who  is  suspended  or  demoted
 pursuant  to  section  eighty  [or  eighty-a]  of  the civil service law
 because [his or her] THEIR position has been abolished or  reduced,  but

 ical  requirements  as the position from which such person was suspended

 or demoted, shall not be disqualified because  of  [his  or  her]  THEIR
 incapacity, unless upon medical examination [his or her] THEIR incapaci-
 ty  has  worsened to a degree that [he or she] THEY would not be able to
 satisfactorily perform in such position. No person shall be disqualified
 pursuant  to this subdivision unless [he or she is] THEY ARE first given
 a written statement of the reasons therefor and  an  opportunity  to  be
 heard  at  a hearing at which satisfactory proof of such reasons must be
 established by appropriate evidence, and at which such person may  pres-
 ent  independent  evidence and be entitled to representation by counsel.
 The corporation shall designate a person to hold such hearing and report
 thereon.
  (f) Eligibility for appointment of an employee whose name appears on a
 redeployment list shall terminate at such time as the employee is  rede-
 ployed  pursuant  to the provisions of this section to a position in the
 same salary grade as the position from which [he or she has]  THEY  HAVE
 been suspended or demoted, or has exercised [his or her] THEIR reemploy-
 ment  rights pursuant to the provisions of section eighty-one or eighty-
 one-a of the civil service law, provided, however, that eligibility  for

 the name of such employee upon a  preferred  list,  and  a  reemployment
 roster, as appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision
 eight of this section.

  10-b. If a public  employer  consolidates,  abolishes,  displaces,  or

 eighty-five of the civil service law, which  is  occupied  by  a  public
 employee  currently  on  active duty with the armed forces of the United
 States, as pursuant to title ten, fourteen or thirty-two of  the  United
 States  code,  such  employer  shall comply with subdivisions eleven and
 twelve of this section and, upon the termination of the  public  employ-
 ee's active duty, as defined in title ten, fourteen or thirty-two of the
 United  States  code, such public employer shall provide full re-employ-
 ment rights warranted to  such  employee  under  the  Federal  Uniformed
 Services  Employment  and  Reemployment  Rights  Act  of 1994, provided,
 however, the right of re-employment  under  this  subdivision  does  not
 entitle such employee to displacement rights over any person with great-
 er  seniority.  Such  public  employer shall not abolish any position or
 positions solely based upon the fact that the position or positions  are
 currently  filled  by  an  individual or individuals engaged in military
 duty.

 through a bona fide collective bargaining agreement, or otherwise dimin-
 ish the integrity of existing or future collective bargaining agreements
 and other past practices.
  § 11. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after  it  shall
