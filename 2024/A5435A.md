 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to  establishing  the
  New  York  state community doula directory for doulas serving Medicaid
  patients
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and  declarations. The legislature
 hereby finds and declares that poor maternal and infant health  outcomes
 and  disparities  are  a  public health crisis that pose a threat to the
 health, welfare, and quality of life of child  bearing  people,  infants
 and  their  families. The legislature acknowledges the imbalances of how
 doula care is treated in different communities. Between the rising costs
 of reproductive care, the absence of a federal doula Medicaid framework,
 and the existing barriers to equitable prenatal, intranatal,  and  post-
 partum  care  services,  the  legislature hereby finds the importance in
 establishing a community doula directory to  increase  access  to  care.
 Having  doula services in an accessible and centralized location that is
 open to the public without an economic barrier, will help connect birth-
 ing persons with the doula care services they need.
  § 2. Article 25 of the public health law is amended by  adding  a  new
 title 6-A to read as follows:
  TITLE VI-A
  DOULAS FOR MEDICAID
 SECTION 2594-A. DEFINITIONS.
  2594-B. NEW YORK STATE COMMUNITY DOULA DIRECTORY.
  2594-C. CRITERIA FOR ADMITTANCE INTO THE NEW YORK STATE COMMUNI-
  TY DOULA DIRECTORY.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
