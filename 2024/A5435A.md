 Introduced  by M. of A. SOLAGES -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to  establishing  the
  New  York  state community doula directory for doulas serving Medicaid
  patients
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and  declarations. The legislature
 hereby  finds and declares that poor maternal and infant health outcomes
 and disparities are a public health crisis that pose  a  threat  to  the
 health,  welfare,  and  quality of life of child bearing people, infants
 and their families. The legislature acknowledges the imbalances  of  how
 doula care is treated in different communities. Between the rising costs
 of reproductive care, the absence of a federal doula Medicaid framework,
 and  the  existing barriers to equitable prenatal, intranatal, and post-
 partum care services, the legislature hereby  finds  the  importance  in
 establishing  a  community  doula  directory to increase access to care.
 Having doula services in an accessible and centralized location that  is
 open to the public without an economic barrier, will help connect birth-
 ing persons with the doula care services they need.
  §  2.  Article  25 of the public health law is amended by adding a new
 title 6-A to read as follows:
 
  TITLE VI-A
  DOULAS FOR MEDICAID
 
 SECTION 2594-A. DEFINITIONS.
  2594-B. NEW YORK STATE COMMUNITY DOULA DIRECTORY.
  2594-C. CRITERIA FOR ADMITTANCE INTO THE NEW YORK STATE COMMUNI-
  TY DOULA DIRECTORY.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
