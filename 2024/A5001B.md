  23. ESTABLISH SCRAMBLE CROSSWALKS IN CITIES OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOU-
 SAND  OR  MORE  LEADING  TO  AND  FROM  SCHOOL BUILDINGS DURING TIMES OF
 STUDENT ARRIVAL AND DISMISSAL. SUCH SCRAMBLE CROSSWALKS  SHALL  INCLUDE,
 BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:
  (I)  SCRAMBLE  CROSSWALKS  SHALL OPERATE ON WEEKDAYS BETWEEN 8:00 A.M.
 AND 4:00 P.M.;
  (II) PEDESTRIANS SHALL WAIT UNTIL A  PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL  SIGNAL  INDI-
 CATES A SIGN TO WALK;
  (III)  VEHICLES  SHALL  NOT  TURN  RIGHT AT THE INTERSECTION WHILE THE
 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATES A RED LIGHT;

 SIGNAL INDICATES A SIGN TO WALK, PROVIDED HOWEVER, SUCH BICYCLISTS SHALL
 YIELD THE RIGHT OF WAY TO ALL PEDESTRIANS IN THE INTERSECTION;

  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  PARAGRAPH,  "SCRAMBLE CROSSWALK" MEANS A
 CROSSWALK WITH A TRAFFIC SIGNAL WHICH TEMPORARILY  STOPS  ALL  VEHICULAR
 TRAFFIC WHILE A PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATES THAT ALL PEDESTRIANS
 AT THE INTERSECTION SHALL CROSS THE INTERSECTION AT THE SAME TIME.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
