  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  8:30pm - 9:30pm on March 23, 2024, as Earth Hour  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to increase public
awareness  of, and appreciation for, the natural resources of this great
Empire State, as well  as  recognize  the  role  all  citizens  have  in
protecting the environment and the quality of life within New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  8:30 PM - 9:30 PM on
Saturday, March 23, 2024, as Earth Hour in the State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction with the observance of International Earth Hour; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Created by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Sydney,
Australia, in 2007, Earth Hour is observed annually on the last Saturday
of March to encourage individuals, communities, and businesses  to  turn
off  non-essential electric lights, for one hour, from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30
p.m, as a symbol of commitment to the planet; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2020, millions of  people  at  home  and  almost  18,000
landmarks  and  monuments  across  over  190  countries  and territories
switched  off  their  lights  to  promote  awareness  and  conversation
concerning  issues  of climate change, habitat loss and natural resource
conservation; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State should once again take its place among these
world sites in  2024,  and  demonstrate  the  commitment  of  our  staid
institutions,  both  public  and private, by going dark in reflection of
the environmental impacts to which our built world and daily  activities
unwittingly contribute; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having iconic sites such as the Empire State Building, The
Capitol, and Niagara Falls go dark  will  have  a  deep  and  meaningful
impact  on  people  around  the  world,  show  support  for students who
recently participated in demonstrations for climate change  action,  and
catalyze  new  ways  of  thinking  about how we can prosper as a society
without depleting our planet's vitality; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim 8:30 PM - 9:30 PM on March
23, 2024, as Earth Hour in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
