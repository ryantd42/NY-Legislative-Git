  WHEREAS, The volunteer firefighters of New York State  are  renowned
throughout the Nation; their reputation is synonymous with excellence in
the arduous field of fire protection and prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection services in every locality of our State; during the past  150
years,  the  courageous  and  devoted  firefighters  of  Lancaster  have
valiantly responded to all types of fire emergencies and  have  won  the
praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave  volunteer  firefighters  of the Lancaster Fire
Department are prepared to risk their lives every day to help  save  the
lives  of  others and to protect homes and property from the destruction
caused by fire; and
 
  WHEREAS, The vision of the Lancaster Fire Department is committed to
excellence as they honor their past, respect the present, and  plan  for
their  future  with  the dedication of its volunteers and the support of
their community; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a membership of dedicated firefighters, for 24 hours a
day, for 365 days a year, for 150 years,  whenever  the  alarm  sounded,
these  noble  volunteers  left  their homes and went to the aid of their
neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Protecting approximately 11,000 residents of the Village of
Lancaster, New York,  and  surrounding  mutual  aid  jurisdictions,  the
Lancaster  Fire  Department  diligently  and  consistently  provides
lifesaving fire, rescue, and emergency services to those in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Lancaster Fire Department's district is comprised of  a
mixture of residential, commercial, and industrial properties, with four
active  rail  lines  dissecting  the village, along with two major state
truck routes; five elementary  schools,  one  middle  school,  one  high
school,  nine  churches,  Como  Lake Park, and Lancaster Opera House all
call Lancaster their home and rely on the dutiful and  reliable  members
of  the  Lancaster  Fire  Department  to  keep  them  safe  in  times of
emergency; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Lancaster Fire  Department's  protection  area  borders
Depew  Fire  Department to the West, Town Line Volunteer Fire Department
to the East, Twin District Volunteer Fire  Company  to  the  South,  and
Bowmansville Volunteer Fire Association to the North; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to the skill and devoted service demonstrated
by individual firefighters, the Lancaster Fire Department  reflects  the
storied  history  and  impressive  developments of firefighting over the
past 150 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as volunteer firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
good works performed by the volunteer fire  departments  of  this  great
Empire State, their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Lancaster Fire Department;  and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Lancaster Fire Department.
