 currency  and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently from
 a central bank.

 Futures Trading Commission's jurisdiction over economic transactions;
  (ii) the implications of issuing such cryptocurrency on monetary poli-
 cy and financial stability;
  (iii) how local, state, and federal  taxation  would  be  affected  by
 such; and
  (iv)  the  measures  other jurisdictions, central banks, international
 governing bodies, states, or countries, have taken to potentially  issue
 cryptocurrency.
  c.  No  later  than one year after the effective date of this act, the
 task force shall report its findings to the governor  and  the  legisla-
 ture, as described under subdivision b of this section.
  § 2. a. The task force shall be comprised of:
  (i) two members appointed by the governor;

 agencies  of  the  state or any political subdivisions thereof shall, at
