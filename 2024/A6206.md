 Introduced by M. of A. THIELE -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Health
 
 AN  ACT  to  direct  the department of health to conduct a comprehensive
  public health study; and providing for the repeal of  such  provisions
  upon expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative findings. The legislature finds that  increas-
 ingly,  synthetic  turf is being installed in many locations in New York
 state, including parks, athletic fields and other settings where natural
 grass was previously grown. In recent years, crumb rubber fill is  being
 used  as  a  component  of synthetic turf and mulch. Crumb rubber is the
 result of processing waste tires,  which  contain  numerous  components,
 some  of  which are known to be hazardous to people and the environment.
 The hazardous components include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, vana-
 dium, zinc and acetone. Health effects associated with these components,
 at dangerous levels,  include  birth  defects,  cancer,  nervous  system
 damage  and  immune  system suppression. While various options for waste
 tire use are essential to reducing the significant stockpiles  of  waste
 tires, such uses should not threaten or compromise public health.
  The  legislature  finds  that more information is necessary to make an
 informed decision on the appropriate uses of synthetic  turf  containing
 crumb  rubber.  In the interest of preventing adverse health impacts and
 contamination to natural resources, the legislature finds that a compre-
 hensive public health study on the potential threats associated with the
 use of synthetic turf is warranted.
  Therefore, the legislature finds that it  is  consistent  with  public
 policy to require such comprehensive public health study to be undertak-
 en immediately.
  §  2. Public health study of the use of synthetic turf. 1. The depart-
 ment of health, in cooperation  with  the  department  of  environmental

 conservation, shall immediately undertake a review of all available data
 relating  to  the  potential health risks and effects of synthetic turf,
 with particular attention to the crumb rubber content of such  synthetic
 turf,  including  the installation, maintenance, removal and disposal of
 synthetic  turf,  and  including  comparisons  with  other  alternatives
 including natural turf with modern drainage and other components.
  2. The commissioner of health, or his or her designee, shall:
  a. Solicit input from environmental and public health specialists, and
 other stakeholders in an open, public process;
  b. Examine various routes of exposure and the health and environmental
 impact  of  these  pathways  including,  but  not limited to, small fill
 particle inhalation, volatility, leaching to groundwater, dermal absorp-
 tion, and persistence in the environment  of  original  and  degradation
 by-products;
  c. Prepare a report to the governor and the legislature which includes
 research  and  studies conducted on synthetic turf which were the source
 of the report findings and recommendations for appropriate and  inappro-
 priate  use of synthetic turf, crumb rubber and waste tires. Such report
 shall be filed within six months of the  effective  date  of  this  act,
 unless  the  commissioner of health requests in writing, an extension of
 time; and
  d. Conduct an outreach program to inform  local  governments,  private
 organizations,  schools  and  the  public regarding the findings of such
 report. If necessary, information on safe alternatives to synthetic turf
 in settings where this material is a potential  or  actual  health  risk
 should be disseminated to the public.
  3.  All  other  departments  or  agencies of the state or subdivisions
 thereof, and local governments shall, at the request of the commissioner
 of health, provide expertise, assistance and data that will  enable  the
 commissioner to carry out his or her powers and duties.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately:
  (a)  provided,  however,  that  this  act shall, six months after such
 effective date, or when the department of health reports to the governor
 and the legislature as required by section two of  this  act,  whichever
 date is later, expire and be deemed repealed; and
  (b) provided that the commissioner of health shall notify the legisla-
 tive bill drafting commission upon filing the report required in section
 two  of  this  act in order that the commission may maintain an accurate
 and timely effective data base of the official text of the laws  of  the
 state  of  New  York  in  furtherance  of effectuating the provisions of
 section 44 of the legislative law and section 70-b of the  public  offi-
 cers law.
