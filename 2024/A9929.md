  7. Enforcement of lien. (a) An owner's lien may be enforced by  public
 or  private sale of the occupant's goods that remain in the self-storage
 facility, in block, or in parcel, at any time or place and on any  terms
 which  are  commercially reasonable after notice to all persons known to
 claim  an  interest  in  the goods. The notice shall include an itemized
 statement of the amount due, the description of the property subject  to
 the lien, the nature of the proposed sale, a demand for payment within a
 specified  time not less than thirty days from mailing of the notice and
 a conspicuous statement that unless the claimant pays within  that  time
 the goods will be advertised for sale and sold at public or private sale
 in  a  commercially  reasonable manner. The notice shall further include
 the time and place of any public or private sale and it shall state that
 any person claiming an interest in the goods  is  entitled  to  bring  a
 proceeding  hereunder within ten days of the service of the notice if he
 disputes the validity of the lien, or the  amount  claimed.  The  notice
 shall  be personally delivered to the occupant, or sent by registered or
 certified mail to the occupant's last known address, or sent by verified
 mail and electronic mail to  the  occupant's  last  known  address.  Any
 notice  made pursuant to this section and sent by verified mail shall be
 sent to the last known address provided by the occupant, pursuant to the
 occupancy agreement. Any notice made pursuant to this section  and  sent
 by  electronic mail shall only be effective if: (i) the occupancy agree-
 ment states that the occupant has consented  to  receive  late  or  lien
 notices by electronic mail; and (ii) the occupant has provided the occu-
 pant's  electronic  mail  address  in  at least two locations within the
 occupancy agreement.  THE NOTICE SHALL ALSO BE  SENT  TO  THE  EMERGENCY
 CONTACT  DESIGNATED BY THE OCCUPANT, EITHER BY PERSONAL DELIVERY OR SENT
 BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL TO THE EMERGENCY  CONTACT'S  LAST  KNOWN
 ADDRESS,  OR  SENT BY VERIFIED MAIL AND ELECTRONIC MAIL TO THE EMERGENCY
 CONTACT'S LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. ANY NOTICE MADE PURSUANT TO  THIS  SECTION
 SHALL BE SENT TO THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS PROVIDED BY THE OCCUPANT FOR THE
 EMERGENCY CONTACT, PURSUANT TO THE OCCUPANCY AGREEMENT.
  (b) Any notice given pursuant to this section is deemed delivered when
 it  is: (i) properly addressed to the last known address OF THE OCCUPANT
 AND THE EMERGENCY CONTACT, and (ii) either sent by registered, certified
 or verified mail and evidence of mailing is received, or sent  by  elec-
 tronic  mail  and either a non-automated response to the electronic mail
 is received or a receipt of delivery to the electronic mail is received.
  § 5. Owners of self-storage facilities shall obtain emergency  contact
 information  for any occupant with an occupancy agreement in place prior
 to this act taking effect.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
