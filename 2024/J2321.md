  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 19, 2024, as Juneteenth Day in the State of New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, Juneteenth (short  for  "June  nineteenth")  is  a  holiday
commemorating this day, which marked the effective end of slavery in the
United States in the year of 1865 in Galveston, Texas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  that  day,  one  of General Granger's first orders was
Order No. 3 which was read aloud to the people of Texas and stated: "The
people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from
the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.  This  involves
an  absolute equity of rights and rights of property between masters and
former slaves, and  the  connection  heretofore  existing  between  them
becomes that between employer and free laborer."; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration  of  Juneteenth  allowed freed slaves and
their descendants to recount the memories of that great day in 1865 when
freedom was proclaimed, and also served as a release from the  pressures
of settling into new territories; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  Juneteenth  is a time for celebration, it is also a
time  for  reflection,  education,  and  self-improvement;  celebration
participants  listen to elders recount the past, attend prayer services,
and learn from educational speakers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Juneteenth celebrates African American  freedom  and
achievements  while  encouraging continuous self-development and respect
for all cultures; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes on a more  national,  symbolic,  and  even  global
perspective;  the  events  of 1865 in Texas are not forgotten for all of
the roots tie back to this fertile soil from which  a  national  day  of
pride is growing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1980,  the  State  of  Texas  was  the  first state to
recognize Juneteenth as an official state holiday, through  the  efforts
of Al Edwards, an African American State Legislator; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1997,  Congress  recognized  June  19  as  "Juneteenth
Independence Day"; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, founded  and
chaired  by  the  Reverend  Ronald  Meyers,  was  committed  to  making
Juneteenth a federal holiday on par with Flag and Patriot days; on  June
17,  2021,  President  Joe  Biden  signed  the  Juneteenth  National
Independence Day Act, making Juneteenth Day a federal  holiday  for  the
first time in our Nation's history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Juneteenth looks bright as the number of cities and states
creating Juneteenth committees continues to increase; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cities in New York that have  had  Juneteenth  celebrations
include  Albany,  Binghamton,  Bronx,  Brooklyn,  Buffalo,  Rochester,
Schenectady, Syracuse, and Yonkers, with  more  celebrating  each  year;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  19,  2024,  as
Juneteenth Day in New York State; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
