 ITED BY SECTION SEVENTY-EIGHT HUNDRED TWO OF  THIS  TITLE,  SHALL  BE  A

  § 3. Subdivision 2 of section 6514 of the education law, as amended by
 chapter 257 of the laws of 1996, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  The  attorney general shall prosecute such alleged offenses in the
 name  of  the  state[,  provided,  however,  in  the  event  of  alleged
 violations  of  article one hundred fifty-five of this title, a district
 attorney may prosecute such alleged offenses in the name  of  the  state
 provided,  however,  that  any  district  attorney  may  prosecute  such
 offenses where they are incidental to a criminal prosecution  instituted
 by him under other statutes].
  §  4.  Section 6515 of the education law, as amended by chapter 615 of
 the laws of 2003, is amended to read as follows:
  § 6515. Restraint of unlawful acts. Where a violation of this title is

 this  title  occurring  in  cities having a population of one million or
 more, the corporation counsel] may apply to the supreme court within the
 judicial district in which such violation is alleged  to  have  occurred

 ordered to make restitution to any person who has  an  interest  in  any
 money  or  property, either real or personal, acquired by the respondent
 as a result of a violation. Whenever the department concludes that civil
 penalties and/or restitution may be warranted because of the  egregious-
 ness  of  the  unlawful activity, it may serve, along with the cease and
 desist order, a notice of a  hearing  on  the  allegations  of  unlawful
 activity  and the department's intention to order the respondent to make
 restitution and/or impose a civil penalty. The notice should specify the
