  WHEREAS,  In January of 1961, Westmoreland Volunteer Fire Department
held its first meeting in the new Main Street firehouse and in 1962  the

emergencies and have won the praise and respect of the  community  which

to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and

Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
