  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as Financial Literacy Month in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great  pride  in  acknowledging
months in recognition of important issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Financial  Literacy  Month  will  be celebrated during the
month of April 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Personal financial literacy ensures  that  individuals  are
prepared  to  manage  money, credit, and debt; it also helps them become
responsible workers,  heads  of  households,  investors,  entrepreneurs,
business leaders, and citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Credit  card debt is the third largest source of household
indebtedness; mortgage and student loans debt markets are larger; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sixty-two percent of all Americans are living  paycheck  to
paycheck; and
 
  WHEREAS, Expanding access to these mainstream financial institutions
will provide individuals with less expensive and more secure options for
managing their finances and building wealth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Increased  financial literacy empowers individuals to make
wise decisions and reduces the  confusion  caused  by  the  increasingly
complex economy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Because  of  the present financial crisis, there is a need
for further support through government and private partnerships that can
provide efficient use of resources to leverage  technology  advancements
to reach additional consumers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A greater understanding of, and familiarity with financial
markets and institutions will lead to increased  economic  activity  and
growth; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative Body pause in its deliberation to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024,  as  Financial
Literacy Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
