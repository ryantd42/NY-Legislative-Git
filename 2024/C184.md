BY: M. of A. Miller
 
  CONCURRENT  RESOLUTION  OF  THE  SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
  making an application to the Congress of the  United
  States  of  America  for the calling of a convention
  for the  purpose  of  proposing  amendments  to  the
  Constitution of the United States that impose fiscal
  limits  on  the  federal government, limit the power
  and jurisdiction  of  the  federal  government,  and
  limit  the  terms  of office for members of Congress
  and other federal officials
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Founders  of  our  Constitution  empowered  State
Legislators  and  State  Legislatures to be guardians of liberty against
future abuses of power by the federal government; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Tenth  Amendment  of  the  Constitution  specifically
provides  that  all  powers  not delegated to the federal government nor
prohibited by the Constitution to the states, are then reserved  to  the
states respectively, or to the people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  many  decades,  this  balance  of power was generally
respected and followed by those occupying positions of authority in  the
federal government; and
 
  WHEREAS, The federal government has gradually invaded the legitimate
roles  of  the states through the process of excessive federal mandates;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The federal government has created a mounting national debt
exceeding $17 trillion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  federal  government,  and  especially  the  executive
branch,  has ceased to abide by and respect the proper interpretation of
the Constitution of the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the solemn duty of the states to protect the  liberty
of  our  people,  particularly for the generations to come, by proposing
Amendments to the Constitution of the United States through a Convention
of the states under Article V for the purpose of restraining  these  and
related abuses of power; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Legislature of the State of New York believes it to be
in the best interest of the people of the United States that  Amendments
to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States be considered that impose
fiscal  limits  on  the  federal  government,  limit  the  power  and
jurisdiction  of  the  federal government, and limit the terms of office
for members of Congress and other federal officials; now, therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED  (if the  concur), The legislature of the State of New
York hereby applies to Congress, under the provisions of  Article  V  of
the  Constitution  of the United States, for the calling of a convention
of the states, limited to proposing amendments to  the  Constitution  of
the  United  States  that  impose  fiscal  restraints  on  the  federal
 
government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal  government,
and  limit the terms of office for members of Congress and other federal
officials; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED  (if  the  &HOUSE  concur),  This  application  constitutes a
continuing application in accordance with Article V of the  Constitution
of  the  United  States until the legislatures of at least two-thirds of
the several states have made applications on the same subject; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED (if the &HOUSE concur), The  secretary  of  state  is  hereby
directed  to  transmit  copies  of this application to the President and
Secretary of the United States Senate and to the Speaker  and  Clerk  of
the United States House of Representatives, and copies to the members of
the  said  Senate  and House of Representatives from this State; also to
transmit copies  hereof  to  the  presiding  officers  of  each  of  the
legislative houses in the several States, requesting their cooperation.
