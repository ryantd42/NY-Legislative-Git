 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend  the  environmental  conservation  law  and  the  public
  authorities  law,  in relation to establishing an economy-wide cap and
  invest program to support greenhouse gas emissions reductions  in  the
  state

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. 1. Pursuant to  arti-
 cle  75  of  the environmental conservation law, as added by the Climate
 Leadership and Community Protection Act, the department of environmental
 conservation must promulgate regulations, by January 1, 2024, to  ensure
 achievement  of the statewide greenhouse gas emission limits, as defined
 and established  therein.  Among  other  requirements,  the  regulations
 promulgated  by such department pursuant to section 75-0109 of the envi-
 ronmental conservation law must ensure that the aggregate  emissions  of
 greenhouse  gases  from  greenhouse gas emission sources will not exceed
 the statewide greenhouse gas emissions  limits  established  in  section
 75-0107 of the environmental conservation law; include legally enforcea-
 ble  emissions  limits,  performance  standards,  or  measures  or other
 requirements to control emissions from greenhouse gas emission  sources;
 prioritize emissions and co-pollutant reductions in disadvantaged commu-
 nities;  do  not  result  in a net increase in co-pollutant emissions or
 otherwise  disproportionately  burden  disadvantaged  communities;  and
 reflect,  in substantial part, the findings of the scoping plan prepared
 by the Climate Action Council pursuant to section 75-0103 of  the  envi-
 ronmental conservation law.
  2. The scoping plan prepared by the Climate Action Council pursuant to
 section  75-0103  of  the environmental conservation law recommends that
 the department of environmental conservation  and  the  New  York  state
 energy  research and development authority adopt an economy-wide cap and
 invest program to, among  other  purposes,  ensure  achievement  of  the
 statewide  greenhouse  gas limits, as defined and established in article
 75 of the environmental conservation law.

 § 75-0121. CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM; ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCES.
 S. 9228  5
 
  1.  A.  THERE IS HEREBY CREATED AN ECONOMY-WIDE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM
 PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTIONS 75-0107  AND  75-0109  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE  THROUGH EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS METHODS ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED BY
 THE DEPARTMENT AND THE AUTHORITY. THE DEPARTMENT AND THE AUTHORITY SHALL
 UNDERTAKE  SUCH  ADOPTION  AND  IMPLEMENTATION  SO AS TO PROVIDE FOR THE
 PROGRAM TO BEGIN AS OF THE START OF THE FIRST COMPLIANCE PERIOD. THE CAP
 AND INVEST PROGRAM SHALL  BE  SUBJECT  TO  PUBLIC  NOTICE  AND  COMMENT,
 INCLUDING  AT  LEAST FIVE PUBLIC HEARINGS, AND SHALL INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL
 CONSULTATION WITH THE CLIMATE  JUSTICE  WORKING  GROUP  AND  MEMBERS  OF
 DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.
  B.  THE  CAP  AND  INVEST PROGRAM SHALL PROVIDE FOR ANNUALLY DECLINING
 AGGREGATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS BY SETTING A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE
 AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM ALL COVERED SOURCES IN  A  GIVEN
 COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
  C.  A  CERTAIN NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES SHALL BE CREATED BY THE DEPARTMENT
 TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION  ACCOUNT  SO
 AS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE BY THE AUTHORITY TO THE COVERED SOURCES PURSUANT
 TO  THIS SECTION AND SUBDIVISION TWENTY-FIVE OF SECTION EIGHTEEN HUNDRED
 FIFTY-FOUR OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES LAW. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES
 CREATED AND TRANSFERRED SO AS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE BY THE AUTHORITY  FOR
 AUCTION  OR  SALE  IN A GIVEN COMPLIANCE PERIOD SHALL NOT EXCEED THE CAP
 FOR SUCH COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
  D. ALL COVERED SOURCES MUST REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN A FORM AND
 MANNER TO BE PRESCRIBED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND SHALL BE SUBJECT  TO  SUCH
 REQUIREMENTS  AS  THE  DEPARTMENT  MAY ESTABLISH BY REGULATION TO ENSURE
 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE.
  E. IN IMPLEMENTING THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM,  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL
 PRIORITIZE  GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSIONS  AND  CO-POLLUTANT  REDUCTIONS IN
 DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BY ESTABLISHING
 MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GREENHOUSE  GAS  LIMITS  FOR  ALL  INDIVIDUAL  SOURCES
 LOCATED  IN  OR PROXIMATE TO, OR OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTING TO THE POLLUTION
 BURDEN IN, A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE  GREENHOUSE  GAS
 EMISSIONS  LIMITS ON INDIVIDUAL SOURCES SHALL DECLINE AT A RATE WHICH IS
 PROPORTIONAL TO THE DECLINE OF THE CAP. SUCH EMISSIONS LIMITS  SHALL  BE
 SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE POLLUTION
 REDUCTION  AT  RATES EXCEEDING THE RATES OF POLLUTION REDUCTION IN OTHER
 COMMUNITIES AS A RESULT OF THE CAP  AND  INVEST  PROGRAM,  AND  ARE  NOT
 DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF THE CAP AND INVEST
 PROGRAM  PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH C OF SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION 75-0109
 OF THIS ARTICLE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCH  COMMU-
 NITIES  AND  SUCH  SOURCES. THE DEPARTMENT MAY SET EMISSIONS LIMITS AT A
 LOWER LEVEL FOR  SOURCES  LOCATED  IN  OR  PROXIMATE  TO,  OR  OTHERWISE
 CONTRIBUTING  TO THE POLLUTION BURDEN IN, A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY THAN
 WOULD OTHERWISE BE REQUIRED UNDER THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM.
  F. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS TO  ADDRESS
 COVERED SOURCES FOR WHICH REGULATION UNDER THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM IS
 PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW.
  G.  THE DEPARTMENT AND THE AUTHORITY SHALL COORDINATE WITH THE COMMIS-
 SION TO DETERMINE A  TIMELINE  AND  RELATED  PLANNING  PROCESS  FOR  THE
 RETIREMENT  OF  FOSSIL FUEL GENERATION FACILITIES OR THEIR CONVERSION TO
 RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES TO ENSURE THE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NECESSARY
 TO COMPLY WITH THE STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS ESTABLISHED
 BY SECTION 75-0107 OF THIS ARTICLE.
  2. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL TRANSFER ALL ALLOWANCES, AS CREATED AND ISSUED
 BY THE DEPARTMENT PURSUANT TO THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM ESTABLISHED  BY
 SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION,  TO  THE  GREENHOUSE  GAS EMISSIONS
 S. 9228  6
 
 REDUCTION ACCOUNT FOR AUCTION, SALE, OR DIRECT ALLOCATION THEREOF IN THE
 MANNER SET FORTH IN THIS  ARTICLE  AND  IN  SUBDIVISION  TWENTY-FIVE  OF
 SECTION  EIGHTEEN  HUNDRED  FIFTY-FOUR  OF  THE  PUBLIC AUTHORITIES LAW;
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL NOT ALLOCATE PERMITS FOR
 ZERO OR DE MINIMIS COST.
  3. A. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ADOPT REGULATIONS THAT  ESTABLISH  CRITERIA
 AND  METHODS FOR DETERMINING ENERGY INTENSITY AND TRADE EXPOSURE FOR THE
 PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING FACILITIES WHICH MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY
 THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM SUCH THAT THEY MAY BE DESIGNATED AS EITES  IN
 A  MANNER WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TREATMENT OF EITES IN THE SCOPING
 PLAN, INCLUDING APPENDIX C THEREOF.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL  ENSURE  THAT
 ANY  DESIGNATED  EITES ATTEMPT STRATEGIES TO PROACTIVELY REDUCE THE RISK
 OF LEAKAGE BY RELYING  ON  INCENTIVE-ORIENTED  APPROACHES  OR  TECHNICAL
 SUPPORT PRIOR TO APPROVING ANY REDUCED COST ALLOWANCES.  THE DEVELOPMENT
 OF  SUCH  REGULATIONS  SHALL  INCLUDE AT LEAST THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND
 OTHER EFFORTS TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL  OPPORTUNITIES  FOR  PUBLIC  COMMENT
 FROM ALL PERSONS WHO WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE SCOPING PLAN, INCLUDING BUT
 NOT  LIMITED  TO, PERSONS WORKING FOR EITES AND PERSONS LIVING IN DISAD-
 VANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SUCH REGULATIONS SHALL BE DEVELOPED IN  COMPLIANCE
 WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH B OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  B. SUCH REGULATIONS SHALL:
  (I)  IDENTIFY  A  PROCEDURE FOR DEMONSTRATING THAT SUCH FACILITIES ARE
 USING BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE GAS  EMISSIONS
 AND  BEST AVAILABLE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PRACTICES TO REDUCE SUCH EMISSIONS
 AND INCORPORATE CO-POLLUTANT REDUCTION MEASURES OR  MITIGATION  REQUIRE-
 MENTS  FOR  SUCH  FACILITIES  LOCATED  IN  OR PROXIMATE TO DISADVANTAGED
 COMMUNITIES; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE TERM "BEST AVAILABLE  TECHNOLO-
 GY"  SHALL  NOT  INCLUDE THE USE OF ALTERNATE FUEL COMBUSTION, OR CARBON
 CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION;
  (II) CONSIDER HOW PROGRAM DESIGN CAN  FURTHER  MITIGATE  THE  COST  OF
 REDUCING  EMISSIONS  FOR SUCH FACILITIES WHILE PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE TO
 IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE EMISSIONS;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER  THAT  SUCH
 MITIGATION  SHALL  NOT  INCLUDE THE USE OF ALTERNATE FUEL COMBUSTION, OR
 CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION;
  (III) INCORPORATE  CO-POLLUTANT  REDUCTION  MEASURES  OR  CO-POLLUTANT
 MITIGATION  REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH FACILITIES LOCATED IN OR PROXIMATE TO,
 OR OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTING TO THE POLLUTION BURDEN  IN,  A  DISADVANTAGED
 COMMUNITY;
  (IV)  ENSURE  THAT  ACTUAL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS BY EACH EMITTER ARE IN
 COMPLIANCE WITH SITE OR FACILITY SPECIFIC CAPS FOR FACILITIES LOCATED IN
 OR PROXIMATE TO, OR OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTING TO THE POLLUTION  BURDEN  IN,
 DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES; AND
  (V) PROVIDE FOR AN APPLICATION PROCESS FOR A FACILITY TO BE DESIGNATED
 BY THE DEPARTMENT AS AN EITE, WHICH SUCH APPLICATION SHALL INCLUDE:
  (A) SUCH INFORMATION AS THE DEPARTMENT MAY REQUEST TO ESTABLISH WHETH-
 ER  SUCH  FACILITY  SATISFIES  THE  ENERGY  INTENSITY AND TRADE EXPOSURE
 CRITERIA ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH A OF THIS SUBDIVISION;
  (B) A DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM
 ON SUCH FACILITY;
  (C) SUCH FACILITY'S PLANS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES  AND
 CO-POLLUTANTS; AND
  (D)  CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE FACILITY TO AVOID LEAK-
 AGE AND CONTINUE TO MEET SUCH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR  ECONOMIC  MAINTE-
 NANCE REQUIREMENTS AS DETERMINED TO BE APPROPRIATE BY THE DEPARTMENT, IN
 CONSULTATION  WITH THE AUTHORITY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOP-
 MENT.
 S. 9228  7

  C. UPON A SATISFACTORY SHOWING BY AN EITE TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT  SUCH
 EITE  WILL  BE  SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMPLIANCE WITH THE
 CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM SO AS TO RESULT IN LEAKAGE,  THE  DEPARTMENT  AND
 THE AUTHORITY MAY, IN A MANNER NOT INCONSISTENT WITH ANY OTHER PROVISION
 OF THIS ARTICLE OR THE SCOPING PLAN, PROVIDE FOR ALLOWANCES TO INITIALLY
 BE  ISSUED TO ELIGIBLE EITES AT REDUCED COST. THE AMOUNT OF SUCH REDUCED
 COST SHALL BE THAT AMOUNT WHICH IS NECESSARY  TO  PREVENT  LEAKAGE  WITH
 RESPECT  TO  THE FACILITY, AS DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT, IN CONSULTA-
 TION WITH THE AUTHORITY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT,  AS
 LONG  AS  THE EITE EMPLOYS BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE ITS EMIS-
 SIONS; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE TERM "BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY" WILL
 NOT INCLUDE THE USE OF ALTERNATE FUEL COMBUSTION, OR CARBON CAPTURE  AND
 SEQUESTRATION.  FOR THE FIRST COMPLIANCE PERIOD, ANY ALLOWANCES ISSUED
 TO AN EITE AT REDUCED COST SHALL NOT REPRESENT  MORE  THAN  THE  MINIMUM
 AMOUNT  OF ALLOWANCES NECESSARY TO AUTHORIZE SUCH EITE TO EMIT AN AMOUNT
 OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT EMISSIONS  EQUAL  TO  SUCH  EITE'S  AVERAGE
 ANNUAL CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT EMISSIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING
 THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION AS DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT. SUCH
 AMOUNT  SHALL  BE  ADJUSTED  DOWNWARD  AS  NECESSARY  TO ACCOUNT FOR THE
 REQUIREMENT THAT SUCH EITE EMPLOY BEST AVAILABLE  TECHNOLOGY  TO  REDUCE
 ITS EMISSIONS. IN SUBSEQUENT COMPLIANCE PERIODS, ANY ALLOCATION TO EITES
 OF  ALLOWANCES  AT  REDUCED  COST  SHALL  DECLINE  IN  PROPORTION TO THE
 REDUCTION IN TOTAL AVAILABLE ALLOWANCES FOR A GIVEN COMPLIANCE PERIOD IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAP FOR SUCH COMPLIANCE PERIOD.  AN EITE  SHALL  NOT
 BE  ISSUED AN ALLOWANCE AT REDUCED COST FOR AN AMOUNT WHICH IS LESS THAN
 THE AMOUNT PAID BY SUCH EITE FOR A REDUCED COST ALLOWANCE IN THE  PREVI-
 OUS COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
  D.  EITES SHALL NOT RECEIVE ALLOWANCES AT REDUCED COST AFTER THE TENTH
 COMPLIANCE PERIOD. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL CEASE THE ISSUANCE OF ALLOWANCES
 TO AN EITE AT REDUCED COST IF IT DETERMINES THAT:
  (I) ISSUANCE OF ALLOWANCES AT REDUCED COST TO SUCH EITE IS  NO  LONGER
 NECESSARY TO LIMIT LEAKAGE;
  (II)  SUCH  EITE  IS NOT EMPLOYING BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE
 EMISSIONS;
  (III) SUCH EITE IS LOCATED IN OR PROXIMATE TO, OR OTHERWISE CONTRIBUT-
 ING TO THE POLLUTING BURDEN IN,  A  DISADVANTAGED  COMMUNITY,  AND  SUCH
 EITE'S  CO-POLLUTANT  EMISSIONS  HAVE INCREASED RELATIVE TO THE PREVIOUS
 COMPLIANCE PERIOD;
  (IV) SUCH EITE NO LONGER QUALIFIES AS AN EITE PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH  B
 OF THIS SUBDIVISION; OR
  (V)  SUCH EITE MADE MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS ON ITS APPLICATION FOR EITE
 DESIGNATION, OR MATERIALLY VIOLATED (A) THE TERMS  OF  ANY  APPROVAL  OF
 SUCH  APPLICATION, (B) ANY AGREEMENT IN RESPECT THEREOF, OR (C) ANY LAW,
 RULE, OR REGULATION ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE OR ARTICLE NINETEEN
 OF THIS CHAPTER, INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION  THE  INDIVIDUAL  SOURCE
 EMISSIONS  LIMITS SET PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH E OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS
 SECTION.
  E. IF THE ACTUAL GREENHOUSE GAS EQUIVALENT EMISSIONS OF AN EITE EXCEED
 THE ALLOWANCES ISSUED TO SUCH EITE AT REDUCED COST FOR  THAT  COMPLIANCE
 PERIOD,  SUCH  EITE MUST ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES AT FULL PRICE AND
 SUBMIT SUCH ALLOWANCES AS NECESSARY TO SATISFY ITS COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION
 DURING SUCH COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
  F. IF THE DEPARTMENT ISSUES ALLOWANCES TO EITES AT REDUCED  COST,  THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL:
 S. 9228  8

  (I)  CONDUCT  REGULAR  AUDITS  OF SUCH EITES TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH
 EITES CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS EITES FOR  PURPOSES  OF  RECEIVING  REDUCED
 COST ALLOWANCES UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION; AND
  (II) REGULARLY REVIEW THE NEED TO ISSUE ALLOWANCES TO EITES AT REDUCED
 COST.
  G.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  CREATE  AN  ONLINE  PUBLIC DATABASE ON ITS
 WEBSITE AND REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE  AT  LEAST  EVERY
 COMPLIANCE  PERIOD  ON  THE EMISSIONS AND LOCATION OF ALL EITES AT LEAST
 ONCE PER COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
  H. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION TO THE  CONTRARY,  THE
 TOTAL NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES ISSUED AT REDUCED COST FOR A COMPLIANCE PERI-
 OD  SHALL  NOT  EXCEED  FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH
 COMPLIANCE PERIOD. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS PARAGRAPH LIMITS  THE  NUMBER
 OF REDUCED COST ALLOWANCES OTHERWISE ALLOCATED TO EITES PURSUANT TO THIS
 SUBDIVISION,  ALLOCATIONS OF REDUCED COST ALLOWANCES SHALL BE REDUCED AS
 NECESSARY, IN A MANNER TO BE DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY  THE  DEPARTMENT,
 IN CONSULTATION WITH THE AUTHORITY.
  4.  A. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE AUTHORITY FOR THE
 AUCTION OR SALE OF ALLOWANCES PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  TWENTY-FIVE  OF
 SECTION EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES LAW.
  B.  THE  DEPARTMENT,  IN  CONSULTATION WITH THE AUTHORITY, SHALL ADOPT
 SUCH RULES AND REGULATIONS AS IT DEEMS NECESSARY TO GOVERN  THE  AUCTION
 OR  SALE  OF  ALLOWANCES,  AND  MAY  ENTER INTO SUCH CONTRACTS AS MAY BE
 NECESSARY OR CONVENIENT FOR SUCH PURPOSE.
  C. THE DEPARTMENT, IN COORDINATION WITH  THE  AUTHORITY,  SHALL  ADOPT
 SUCH  RULES  AND REGULATIONS AS IT DEEMS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE CONFI-
 DENTIALITY OF PURCHASERS OF ALLOWANCES, GUARD AGAINST  BIDDER  COLLUSION
 AND  MINIMIZE  THE  POTENTIAL  FOR MARKET MANIPULATION OF THE AUCTION OR
 SALE OF ALLOWANCES.
  5. THE DEPARTMENT MAY RESERVE A SMALL PORTION OF ALLOWANCES UNDER  THE
 CAP FOR PURPOSES OF MARKET STABILITY AND TO INCENTIVIZE ADDITIONAL EMIS-
 SIONS  REDUCTIONS  SO LONG AS SUCH ALLOWANCES ARE NOT IN ADDITION TO THE
 TOTAL ALLOWANCES UNDER THE CAP. SUCH ALLOWANCES MAY  BE  TRANSFERRED  TO
 THE  GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSIONS  REDUCTION  ACCOUNT  UPON  NOTICE TO THE
 DEPARTMENT BY THE AUTHORITY AT SUCH TIMES AS IS DEEMED NECESSARY BY  THE
 AUTHORITY.  SUCH RESERVE ALLOWANCES MAY BE AUCTIONED OR SOLD IN A MANNER
 AND AT A TIME AS DETERMINED TO BE APPROPRIATE  BY  THE  AUTHORITY.  SUCH
 RESERVE ALLOWANCES SHALL BE AUCTIONED OR SOLD FOR A PRICE WHICH IS EQUAL
 TO  OR GREATER THAN THE MAXIMUM ALLOWANCE PRICE PROVIDED FOR IN SUBDIVI-
 SION TWO OF SECTION 75-0125 OF THIS ARTICLE. THE SALE  OF  THESE  ALLOW-
 ANCES MAY BE USED FOR COST CONTAINMENT, PROVIDED THAT SUCH SALE DOES NOT
 VIOLATE  ANY  OTHER SECTION OF THIS ARTICLE OR EXCEED THE CURRENT ANNUAL
 CAP.
 § 75-0123. USE OF ALLOWANCES.
  1. ALLOWANCES MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE FULL  AMOUNT
 OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EMITTED DURING A GIVEN COMPLIANCE PERIOD. IF

 REGIONAL  GREENHOUSE  GAS INITIATIVE. NO SOURCE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO THE
 CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM
 BECAUSE IT IS SUBJECT TO THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE.
  2. A. THE DEPARTMENT MAY LINK THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM WITH  ONE  OR
 MORE  SIMILAR  PROGRAMS  IN JURISDICTIONS OTHER THAN THE REGIONAL GREEN-
 HOUSE GAS INITIATIVE IF IT DETERMINES THAT:
  (I) SUCH LINKAGE WILL RESULT IN CAP AND INVEST  PROGRAM  MARKET  BENE-
 FITS, REDUCE COSTS, AND RESULT IN ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE
 STATE  WITHOUT  REDUCING  THE OVERALL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS OR SLOWING OR
 REDUCING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES; AND

  (D)  IF ANY ANALYSIS SUBMITTED AS PUBLIC COMMENTS SHOWS THAT THE LINK-
 AGE WILL  RAISE  EMISSIONS  OR  INCREASE  UNEQUAL  CUMULATIVE  POLLUTION
 BURDENS  IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, ANY SUCH LINKAGE SHALL BE DELAYED
 FOR AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS WHILE THE IMPACT OF  SUCH  LINKAGE  SHALL  BE
 REASSESSED.
  B.  IF  ANY  ANALYSIS  OF A PLAN FOR ANY PROPOSED LINKAGE SUBMITTED AS
 PUBLIC COMMENTS SHOWS THAT THE LINKAGE WILL RAISE EMISSIONS OR  INCREASE
 UNEQUAL  CUMULATIVE POLLUTION BURDENS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, THEN
 THE LINKAGE MUST BE DELAYED FOR AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS, AND  THE  IMPACT
 OF THE LINKAGE MUST BE REASSESSED.
  3. ANY LINKAGE SHALL PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT:
  A.  IT  DOES  NOT  COMPROMISE,  LIMIT,  OR  IMPINGE  UPON  THE STATE'S
 PROGRESS, ABILITY, OR LIKELIHOOD OF MEETING OR  EXCEEDING  THE  REQUIRE-
 MENTS OF THIS ARTICLE;
  B.  CREDIT  FOR  GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS UNDER ONE PROGRAM
 SHALL NOT REDUCE COMPLIANCE  OBLIGATIONS  IN  THE  OTHER  JURISDICTIONAL
 PROGRAM  MORE  THAN  AN  EQUIVALENT  AMOUNT  OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
 REDUCTIONS IN SUCH PROGRAM; AND
  C. SUCH LINKAGE WILL NOT RESULT IN INCREASED CO-POLLUTANT EMISSIONS IN
 DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.
  4. IF THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES  THAT  LINKAGE  WITH  ANOTHER  SIMILAR
 PROGRAM MADE PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION NO LONGER MEETS
 THE  REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH A OF SUCH SUBDIVISION AND PARA-
 GRAPHS A, B, AND C OF SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION, THE  DEPARTMENT
 SHALL  TAKE  IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH PARAGRAPHS.

 OF NON-COMPLIANCE, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL DISCONTINUE SUCH LINKAGE  WITHIN
 ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS THEREAFTER.
