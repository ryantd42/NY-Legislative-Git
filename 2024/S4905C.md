 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  calculating the  earnings  limitations  for  retired  police  officers
  employed part-time by certain municipalities
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 212 of the retirement and social  security  law  is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 4 to read as follows:
  4.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISIONS ONE AND TWO OF THIS
 SECTION, SUCH EARNINGS LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO A  RETIRED  POLICE
 OFFICER,  WHO  HAS  RETIRED  AFTER  HAVING  TWENTY-FIVE  YEARS OF VESTED
 SERVICE IN A POLICE PENSION SYSTEM THAT FULLY VESTS AT TWENTY YEARS, WHO
 IS EMPLOYED PART-TIME AS A POLICE OFFICER IN A VILLAGE OR  TOWN  WITH  A
 POPULATION  OF  LESS THAN TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AS DETERMINED BY THE MOST
 RECENT FEDERAL DECENNIAL CENSUS, WHERE AT LEAST SEVENTY PERCENT OF  SUCH
 VILLAGE  OR  TOWN'S  ACTIVE-DUTY  POLICE  FORCE,  NOT INCLUDING CIVILIAN
 STAFF, CONSISTS OF PART-TIME OFFICERS.  SUCH  PART-TIME  POLICE  OFFICER
 SHALL  BE  PERMITTED  TO  WORK  UP  TO  FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY HOURS IN ANY
 CONSECUTIVE SIX-MONTH PERIOD IN A CALENDAR YEAR BASED ON HOURS WORKED AS
 REPORTED BY THE VILLAGE OR TOWN ON A MONTHLY BASIS, WITH  NO  SUSPENSION
 OR  DIMINUTION OF RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE. ANY VILLAGE OR TOWN THAT HIRES A
 RETIRED POLICE OFFICER PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION  SHALL  REPORT  SUCH
 OFFICER'S  DAYS WORKED AND SALARY EARNED TO THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL
 POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM ON A MONTHLY BASIS.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative law, Section 50:
  Insofar  as  it  would  affect the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), this bill would allow retired  police
 officers to continue to receive their full retirement benefit when reem-
 ployed  as  a police officer on a part-time basis for up to 520 hours in
 any consecutive six-month period. Provided, however, that  such  employ-
 ment  is by a village or town where (1) the municipal population is less
 than 25,000, and (2) at least 70% of the police force is employed  on  a
 part-time  basis.  Such  retired  police officers must also have retired
 with at least twenty-five years  of  service  credit  on  a  twenty-year
 retirement plan to be eligible for this benefit. Currently, the post-re-
 tirement earnings limit is $35,000.
  If  this  bill  were  enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, the
 direct cost incurred would be the retiree's pension benefit  paid  while
 post-retirement  earnings  are  greater than $35,000 each calendar year.
 The pension benefit expected to be paid  by  the  NYSLPFRS  during  that
 7-month period is estimated to be $46,500 per person.
  In addition to the direct cost quoted above, there would be additional
 costs  in  the  form  of lost employer contributions due to non-billable
 post-retirement earnings, which is estimated to be $14,000 per person.
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  All  costs will be shared by the State of New York and all participat-
 ing employers in the NYSLPFRS and spread over future billing cycles.
  The number of members and retirees  who  could  be  affected  by  this
 legislation  cannot  be  readily  determined.  For  each retiree rehired
 pursuant to this proposal, an annual cost of  $60,500  is  expected.  If
 large  numbers  of retirees are rehired into such positions, significant
 annual costs would result.
  Based on the 2020 census, approximately 95% of towns and  villages  in
 New  York State would satisfy the population requirement associated with
 this proposal. These employers represent approximately 20% of the  total
 NYSLPFRS membership.
