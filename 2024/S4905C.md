 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  calculating  the  earnings  limitations  for  retired  police officers
  employed part-time by certain municipalities
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  212 of the retirement and social security law is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 4 to read as follows:
  4. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISIONS ONE AND TWO OF  THIS
 SECTION,  SUCH  EARNINGS LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO A RETIRED POLICE
 OFFICER, WHO HAS  RETIRED  AFTER  HAVING  TWENTY-FIVE  YEARS  OF  VESTED
 SERVICE IN A POLICE PENSION SYSTEM THAT FULLY VESTS AT TWENTY YEARS, WHO
 IS  EMPLOYED  PART-TIME  AS A POLICE OFFICER IN A VILLAGE OR TOWN WITH A
 POPULATION OF LESS THAN TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AS DETERMINED BY  THE  MOST
 RECENT  FEDERAL DECENNIAL CENSUS, WHERE AT LEAST SEVENTY PERCENT OF SUCH
 VILLAGE OR TOWN'S  ACTIVE-DUTY  POLICE  FORCE,  NOT  INCLUDING  CIVILIAN
 STAFF,  CONSISTS  OF  PART-TIME  OFFICERS. SUCH PART-TIME POLICE OFFICER
 SHALL BE PERMITTED TO WORK UP  TO  FIVE  HUNDRED  TWENTY  HOURS  IN  ANY
 CONSECUTIVE SIX-MONTH PERIOD IN A CALENDAR YEAR BASED ON HOURS WORKED AS
 REPORTED  BY  THE VILLAGE OR TOWN ON A MONTHLY BASIS, WITH NO SUSPENSION
 OR DIMINUTION OF RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE. ANY VILLAGE OR TOWN THAT HIRES  A
 RETIRED  POLICE  OFFICER  PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL REPORT SUCH
 OFFICER'S DAYS WORKED AND SALARY EARNED TO THE NEW YORK STATE AND  LOCAL
 POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM ON A MONTHLY BASIS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  Insofar  as  it  would  affect the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), this bill would allow retired  police
 officers to continue to receive their full retirement benefit when reem-
 ployed  as  a police officer on a part-time basis for up to 520 hours in
 any consecutive six-month period. Provided, however, that  such  employ-
 ment  is by a village or town where (1) the municipal population is less
 than 25,000, and (2) at least 70% of the police force is employed  on  a
 part-time  basis.  Such  retired  police officers must also have retired
 with at least twenty-five years  of  service  credit  on  a  twenty-year
 retirement plan to be eligible for this benefit. Currently, the post-re-
 tirement earnings limit is $35,000.
  If  this  bill  were  enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, the
 direct cost incurred would be the retiree's pension benefit  paid  while
 post-retirement  earnings  are  greater than $35,000 each calendar year.
 The pension benefit expected to be paid  by  the  NYSLPFRS  during  that
 7-month period is estimated to be $46,500 per person.
  In addition to the direct cost quoted above, there would be additional
 costs  in  the  form  of lost employer contributions due to non-billable
 post-retirement earnings, which is estimated to be $14,000 per person.
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  All  costs will be shared by the State of New York and all participat-
 ing employers in the NYSLPFRS and spread over future billing cycles.
  The number of members and retirees  who  could  be  affected  by  this
 legislation  cannot  be  readily  determined.  For  each retiree rehired
 pursuant to this proposal, an annual cost of  $60,500  is  expected.  If
 large  numbers  of retirees are rehired into such positions, significant
 annual costs would result.
  Based on the 2020 census, approximately 95% of towns and  villages  in
 New  York State would satisfy the population requirement associated with
 this proposal. These employers represent approximately 20% of the  total
 NYSLPFRS membership.

 Report.

 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated March 8, 2024, and intended for use  only  during
 the  2024  Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2024-113, prepared by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 S. 4905--C  3

  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation would remove the $35,000 Retirement
 and Social  Security  Law  (RSSL)  Section  212  post-retirement  public
 employment  earnings  limit for retired police officers who retired with
 at least 25 years of service and are reemployed on a part-time basis  as
 a police officer with certain villages or towns.

  $120,000  $60,000  $67,500  $73,333  $78,000
  $130,000  $65,000  $73,125  $79,444  $84,500
 
  The  entire resulting increase in employer contributions will be allo-
 cated to New York City.
  CENSUS DATA: The number of retirees who will return to public  service
 in  the  future  is  unknown  and  the  portion of the pension allowance
 currently suspended is highly dependent on salary  earned.  The  results
 above illustrate the pension amount that would be suspended without this
 legislation given a retirees post-retirement earnings and pension allow-
 ance.
  IMPACT  ON PENSION PAYMENTS: Retirees who return to public service and
 elect to be covered under the provisions of RSSL Section 212 are permit-
 ted to earn an amount not exceeding a  specific  dollar  limit  in  each
 calendar  year  without loss, suspension, or diminution of their retire-
 ment allowances. Once  this  dollar  limit  is  reached,  the  retiree's
 retirement  allowance  is  suspended  for the remainder of that calendar
 year. The total amount of RSSL Section 212 retirement allowance  suspen-
 sions  is  contingent  upon both individual post-retirement earnings and
 individual annual retirement allowances.
  The proposed legislation would  remove  the  post-retirement  earnings
 limit  for  police retirees who work part-time for (1) a town or village
 with a population less than 25,000; (2)  where  at  least  70%  of  such
 village or town's uniformed police force is part-time; and (3) the part-
 time work does not exceed 520 hours in a consecutive six-month period in
 a calendar year.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  For  illustrative purposes only, the table
 above presents  the  estimated  additional  retirement  allowances  paid
 (i.e., those benefits that would not be subject to suspension) for vari-
 ous  sample  combinations  of post-retirement annual earnings and annual
 retirement allowance amounts.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
