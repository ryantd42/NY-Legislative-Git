  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as the "genetic
 testing protection act of New York".
  § 2. Section 2615 of the insurance law is REPEALED and a  new  section
 2615 is added to read as follows:
  §  2615.  DISCRIMINATION  BECAUSE  OF GENETIC PREDISPOSITION.  (A) NO
 LIFE, ACCIDENT, HEALTH, DISABILITY, LONG TERM CARE, OR MEDICAL INDEMNITY
 INSURER SHALL CONDITION INSURANCE RATES, THE  PROVISION  OR  RENEWAL  OF
 COVERAGE  OR BENEFITS, OR ANY OTHER COVERAGE TERM ON THE AGREEMENT OF AN
 INDIVIDUAL TO UNDERGO GENETIC TESTING.  SUCH INSURERS SHALL NOT  REQUIRE
 OR SOLICIT GENETIC INFORMATION, USE GENETIC TESTING RESULTS, OR CONSIDER
 A  PERSON'S  DECISIONS  OR  ACTIONS  RELATING  TO GENETIC TESTING IN ANY
 MANNER FOR ANY INSURANCE PURPOSE.
  (B) NO LIFE, ACCIDENT, HEALTH, DISABILITY, LONG TERM CARE, OR  MEDICAL
 INDEMNITY  INSURER  SHALL  REFUSE  TO  ISSUE OR RENEW A POLICY, CANCEL A
 POLICY, OR ALTER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF COVERAGE  BASED  ON  A  GENETIC
 PREDISPOSITION OF THE INSURED INDIVIDUAL OR OF A MEMBER OF THE INSURED'S
 FAMILY.
  (C) NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS PREVENTING AN INSUR-
 ER  FROM  ACCESSING AN INDIVIDUAL'S MEDICAL RECORD, IF OTHERWISE ALLOWED
 BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION PROHIBITS AN INSURER FROM CONSIDERING  A
 MEDICAL  DIAGNOSIS INCLUDED IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S MEDICAL RECORD, EVEN IF A
 DIAGNOSIS WAS MADE BASED ON THE RESULTS OF A GENETIC TEST.
