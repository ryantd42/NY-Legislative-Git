 AN ACT to establish the "recovery ready workplace act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Short title.  This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "recovery ready workplace act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and purpose. The legislature finds that:
  1. Recovery ready workplace (RRW) programs have been initiated  around
 the  country as important interventions in the opioid use disorder (OUD)
 and substance use disorder (SUD) crisis.
  2. The goal of RRW programs is  to  provide  outreach,  training,  and
 certification  to  employers  in  cooperation with government officials,
 workers, labor unions, and communities to:
  (a) prevent initiation of new cases of misuse and addiction related to
 workplace injury and stress through primary prevention  of  exposure  to
 job hazards and stressors;
  (b)  support  employees  who  are  struggling  and retain employees by
 providing access to treatment and pathways to return to work;
  (c) provide healthy, gainful employment for people in recovery; and
  (d) reduce absenteeism,  presenteeism,  and  lost  productivity  among
 employees with substance use disorder.
  3.  Workers  with painful injuries have frequently been overprescribed
 opioids, resulting in as many as twenty-five percent of workers develop-
 ing opioid dependence and OUD or SUD.
  4. RRW programs address the prevention of addiction related  to  work-
 place injury and stress while also providing support for workers who are
 struggling and opportunities for people in recovery to reenter the work-
 force.
  5.  Between  2009  to 2015, an estimated 225,000 New York workers were
 lost from the labor market due to opioids. New  York's  economy  cumula-
 tively lost $179.4 billion dollars in real economic output, which trans-

 lates to the state's annual real GDP growth rate slowing by 0.8 percent-
 age points.
  6.  Employers  who  establish  RRW  programs  have  saved money due to
 reduced absenteeism, healthier work environment,  greater  productivity,
 lower  healthcare  costs,  greater workplace safety, employee retention,
 and reduced recruitment and hiring costs.
  7. Employees in recovery save their employers  an  average  of  $8,500
 dollars annually, with $8,175 dollars attributable to avoiding turnover,
 replacement, and healthcare costs.
  8.  There  is  an urgent need to establish resources and standards for
 RRWs in New York state as a key component of the state's response to the
 opioid crisis.
  § 3. Purpose. The purpose of this act shall be to:
  1. establish the criteria for employers to obtain certification as  an
 RRW;
  2. protect the rights of employees;
