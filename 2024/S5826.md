 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to requiring the
  court,  prior to accepting a plea, to advise the defendant of the risk
  of deportation if he or she is not a citizen
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 7 of section 220.50 of the criminal procedure
 law, as amended by chapter 738 of the laws of 2004, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  7.  (A) Prior to [accepting a defendant's plea of guilty to a count or
 counts of an indictment or a superior court information charging a felo-
 ny offense, the court must advise the defendant on the record,  that  if
 the  defendant  is  not  a citizen of the United States, the defendant's
 plea of guilty and the court's acceptance  thereof  may  result  in  the
 defendant's  deportation,  exclusion from admission to the United States
 or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the  United  States.
 Where the plea of guilty is to a count or counts of an indictment charg-
 ing  a  felony offense other than a violent felony offense as defined in
 section 70.02 of the penal law or an A-I felony offense  other  than  an
 A-I  felony  as  defined in article two hundred twenty of the penal law,
 the court must also, prior to accepting such plea, advise the  defendant
 that,  if  the defendant is not a citizen of the United States and is or
 becomes the subject of a final order of deportation issued by the United
 States Immigration and Naturalization  Service,  the  defendant  may  be
 paroled to the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service for
 deportation  purposes  at any time subsequent to the commencement of any
 indeterminate or determinate prison sentence imposed as a result of  the
 defendant's  plea.  The failure to advise the defendant pursuant to this
 subdivision shall not be deemed to affect the voluntariness of a plea of

 any  rights  in  a  subsequent  proceeding  relating to such defendant's
 deportation, exclusion or denial  of  naturalization.]  THE  DEFENDANT'S
 ENTRY  OF  A PLEA OF GUILTY TO ANY ACCUSATORY INSTRUMENT IN ANY CRIMINAL

 FOLLOWING  NOTIFICATION: "IF YOU ARE NOT A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES,
 YOU MAY BECOME DEPORTABLE, INELIGIBLE FOR NATURALIZATION OR INADMISSIBLE
 TO THE UNITED STATES BASED ON A CONVICTION BY PLEA OR VERDICT."
  (I) THE COURT SHALL NOTIFY EVERY DEFENDANT  IN  A  LANGUAGE  THAT  THE

 THE PLEA FOLLOWING THE NOTIFICATION DESCRIBED IN THIS SUBDIVISION,  WITH
 SUCH PLEA OFFER REMAINING OPEN.
  (IV)  ADVICE REGARDING IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES GIVEN BY DEFENSE COUN-
 SEL DOES NOT ABSOLVE THE COURT OF ITS INDEPENDENT OBLIGATION TO GIVE THE
 NOTICE MANDATED IN THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (V) THE NOTIFICATION DOES NOT ABSOLVE DEFENSE COUNSEL OF  HIS  OR  HER
 INDEPENDENT  OBLIGATION  TO  EXPLAIN THE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES TO THE
 DEFENDANT.
  (VI) NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL PROHIBIT A COURT OR THE  PEOPLE
 FROM  CONSIDERING THE IMMIGRATION STATUS OF DEFENDANT IN ACCEPTING ENTRY
 OF A PLEA, IMPOSING A LOWER SENTENCE ACCORDING TO LAW, CONSENTING  TO  A
 LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE, OR FILING AN ADDITIONAL ACCUSATORY INSTRUMENT.
  (B)  AT  THE  TIME  OF  DEFENDANT'S  ARRAIGNMENT, THE COURT SHALL ALSO
 COMPLY WITH PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THOUGH FAILURE TO  DO  SO
 DOES NOT REQUIRE VACATUR PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (C)  WHEN  A  CONVICTION  OR  PLEA HAS POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL IMMIGRATION
 CONSEQUENCES FOR A DEFENDANT, THE COURT'S  FAILURE  TO  STRICTLY  COMPLY
 WITH  PARAGRAPH  (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE

 COUNSEL  TO  DETERMINE,  ADVISE, AND NEGOTIATE EFFECTIVELY REGARDING THE
 IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES OF A DEFENDANT'S CHARGES, PLEA, OR CONVICTION.

 have become a law; provided, however, that the amendments to subdivision
 7 of section 220.50 of the criminal procedure law made by section one of
 this  act  shall  not affect the repeal of such subdivision and shall be
 deemed repealed therewith.
