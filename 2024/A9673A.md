 AN  ACT  to direct the department of taxation and finance to establish a
  pilot program for implementation of local land value taxation

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. 1. The department of taxation and finance shall establish a
 pilot  program  in  up  to  five municipalities under which such munici-
 palities shall develop a plan for implementation of land value  taxation
 that  (a) classifies real estate included in such municipality's assess-
 ment roll as (i) land or land exclusive of buildings, or (ii)  buildings
 on  land;  and  (b)  establishes a different local property tax rate for
 each such class, provided the higher local property tax rate shall apply
 to land or land exclusive of buildings.
  2. The department of taxation and finance shall establish an  applica-
 tion  procedure and any other criteria for the pilot program established
 under subdivision one of this section, under  which  municipalities  may
 apply  to participate in such pilot program.  If a municipality having a
 population greater than 50,000 applies for participation in  such  pilot
 program,  such  municipality  shall designate a specific neighborhood or
 area within such municipality that would participate in such program, if
 selected.  The department of taxation and finance shall send a notice of
 selection for such pilot program to the chief executive officer  of  the
 municipality and to the temporary president of the senate and the speak-
 er of the assembly.
  3.  In  order to apply to participate in the pilot program established
 under subdivision one of this  section,  the  legislative  body  of  the
 applicable  municipality  shall  pass a local law, and a school district
 shall pass  a  resolution,  affirmatively  authorizing  the  application
 established under subdivision two of this section.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
