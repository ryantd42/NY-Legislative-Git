 AN  ACT  to  direct  the department of taxation and finance to conduct a
  study on the implementation of local land value taxation
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  department  of  taxation and finance shall conduct a
 study to determine the positive and negative impacts associated with the
 implementation of land value taxation as a method of real property taxa-
 tion. "Land value taxation" shall mean a method of assessing and  taxing
 real  property in a manner that (a) classifies real estate included in a
 municipality's assessment roll as either:  (i) land or land exclusive of
 buildings, or (ii) buildings on land; and (b)  establishes  a  different
 local  property  tax rate for each such class, provided the higher local
 property tax rate shall apply to land or land  exclusive  of  buildings.
 Such  study  shall  include,  but  not be limited to, recommendations of
 municipalities that could most benefit from land value taxation and  how
 land  value  taxation might impact housing development across the state.
 The department of taxation and finance shall provide a  report  on  such
 study  to the governor and legislature no later than one year after this
 act becomes law.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
