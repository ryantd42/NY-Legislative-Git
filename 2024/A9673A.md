 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  1. The department of taxation and finance shall conduct a
 study to determine the positive and negative impacts associated with the
 implementation land value taxation as a method of  real  property  taxa-
 tion.  "Land value taxation" shall mean a method of assessing and taxing
 real property in a manner that (a) classifies real estate included in  a
 municipality's assessment roll as either:  (i) land or land exclusive of
 buildings,  or  (ii)  buildings on land; and (b) establishes a different
 local property tax rate for each such class, provided the  higher  local
 property  tax  rate  shall apply to land or land exclusive of buildings.
 Such study shall include, but not  be  limited  to,  recommendations  of
 municipalities  that could most benefit from land value taxation and how
 land value taxation might impact housing development across  the  state.
 The  department  of  taxation and finance shall provide a report on such
 study to the governor and legislature no later than one year after  this
 act becomes law.
  2.  The department of taxation and finance shall establish an applica-
 tion procedure and any other criteria for the pilot program  established
 under  subdivision  one  of this section, under which municipalities may
 apply to participate in such pilot program.  If a municipality having  a
 population  greater  than 50,000 applies for participation in such pilot
 program, such municipality shall designate a  specific  neighborhood  or
 area within such municipality that would participate in such program, if
 selected.  The department of taxation and finance shall send a notice of
 selection  for  such pilot program to the chief executive officer of the

 established under subdivision two of this section.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
