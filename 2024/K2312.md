  COMMEMORATING  the  80th  Anniversary  of  the

  WHEREAS, Museums which serve the best interests  of  the  people  of
this Empire State merit the commendation of this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
80th Anniversary of the commissioning of the USS SLATER  DE766,  and  to
celebrate  this  milestone  of  the  last Destroyer Escort that has been
restored and still afloat in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Saturday, June 15,  2024,  a  celebration  of  the  80th
Anniversary  of  the  commissioning of the U.S.S. Slater will be held at
The Hanger at 743 in Albany, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The commissioning of the U.S.S. SLATER  DE766  occurred  on
May 1, 1944, in Tampa Florida; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Commissioning is the ceremony by which a ship is placed in
active duty; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  U.S.S.  SLATER  DE766  is  now  a  Destroyer  Escort
Historical  Museum  moored  on the Hudson River in Albany, New York; the
ship arrived in Albany on October 26, 1997; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 9, 1943, the U.S.S. SLATER's keel was laid at  the
Tampa Shipbuilding Company; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  February  13, 1944, the U.S.S. SLATER was launched and
christened, sponsored by Mrs. Nora Slater, mother  of  Seaman  Frank  O.
Slater who was killed in action aboard the U.S.S. SAN FRANCISO CA-38 off
Gaudalcanal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  June 24, 1946, the U.S.S. SLATER was decommissioned at
Green Cove Springs, Florida; and
 
  WHEREAS, During World War II, 563  Destroyer  Escorts  battled  Nazi
U-boats  on the North Atlantic protecting conveys; while in the Pacific,
these ships stood in line to defend  naval  task  forces  from  Japanese
submarines and Kamikaze air attacks; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  ship  has  been  designated  as  a National Historic
Landmark; and
 
  WHEREAS, The U.S.S. SLATER has undergone an extensive restoration to
enable visitors to return to 1945 to see how sailors  walked,  hear  the
sound  of  a living ship, touch a piece of American history and walk the
decks where  hundreds  of  sailors  walked  before;  the  museum  offers
hour-long  guided  tours,  youth group overnight camping, and a historic
location to hold naval reunions; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that when  museums
of  such  noble  aims  and accomplishments are brought to our attention,
 
they should be celebrated and recognized by all  the  citizens  of  this
great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body is justly proud to commemorate
the 80th Anniversary of the commissioning of the  U.S.S.  SLATER  DE766;
