  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 of section 390 of the social

 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (a)  The  office of children and family services may make announced or
 unannounced inspections of the records and premises of  any  child  care
 provider,  whether or not such provider has a license from, or is regis-
 tered with, the office of children and family services.  The  office  of
 children  and  family services shall make unannounced inspections of the
 records and premises of any child day care provider within fifteen  days
 after  the  office  of children and family services receives a complaint
 that, if true, would indicate such provider does  not  comply  with  the
 applicable  regulations of the office of children and family services or
 with statutory requirements. If the complaint indicates that  there  may
 be  imminent  danger  to the children, the office of children and family
 services shall investigate the complaint no later than the next  day  of
 operation  of  the  provider. The office of children and family services
 may provide for inspections  through  the  purchase  of  services.  WHEN
 CONDUCTING  INSPECTIONS  PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH, THE OFFICE OF CHIL-
 DREN AND FAMILY SERVICES, OR A SERVICE CONTRACTED BY SUCH OFFICE,  SHALL
 EMPLOY  THE  USE  OF CANINES SPECIALLY TRAINED TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF

  § 2. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
