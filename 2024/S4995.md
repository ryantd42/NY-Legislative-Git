  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. 1. The New York state department of transportation is here-
 by authorized and directed, within one hundred twenty days of the enact-
 ment of this act, to study and determine which entrances to parkways  in
 the state are most frequently accessed by commercial motor vehicles and,
 within one year of making such determination, to install physical barri-
 ers  to  prevent or otherwise hinder such commercial motor vehicles from
 accessing such parkway entrances.
  2. The commissioner of transportation may request, and  is  authorized
 to  receive, from any department, division, board, bureau, commission or
 other agency of the state or any state public authority such information
 and data as will enable the department  of  transportation  to  properly
 conduct  its study and make its determination. Such information and data
 received by the department of transportation shall  be  subject  to  the
 same requirements for confidentiality and limitations on use, if any, as
 are  applicable  to  the use of such information and data by the depart-
 ment, division, board, bureau, commission or other agency of  the  state
 or state public authority which provided such information and data.
  3.  For the purposes of this act "commercial motor vehicle" shall have
 the same meaning as such term is defined in  subdivision  4  of  section
 501-a of the vehicle and traffic law, provided that such vehicle is also
 of  a  height  that  exceeds  the  clearance  of bridges located on such
 special parkways.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
