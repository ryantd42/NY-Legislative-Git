  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 16-22, 2024, as Lightning Safety Awareness Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York  takes  great  pride  in  recognizing
official weeks established to increase awareness of serious issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 16-22, 2024, as Lightning  Safety
Awareness  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
observance of National Lightning Safety Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lightning strikes the United States about 25 million  times
a  year;  although most occur in the summer, people can be struck at any
time of year; furthermore, lightning is hotter than the surface  of  the
sun  and  can  reach  temperatures  of  approximately  50,000  degrees
Fahrenheit; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lightning kills an average  of  47  people  in  the  United
States each year, and hundreds more are severely injured; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Lightning Safety Council was established to
promote lightning safety education and awareness; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Council recognizes National Lightning Safety  Awareness
Week  as  a  unique  opportunity  to  provide  the  public  with  safety
information  about  lightning,  encouraging  individuals  to  visit  the
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administrations'  comprehensive
lightning safety web site to learn more about  lightning  and  lightning
safety; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Lightning Safety Awareness Week was established in
2001 to call attention to this underrated killer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  lightning fatalities in the United
States have  dropped  tremendously;  this  reduction  in  fatalities  is
largely  due  to  greater  awareness of the lightning danger, and people
seeking safety when thunderstorms threaten; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this  serious  issue,  and  more  must  be  done to promote events which
inspire people to take necessary precautions against lightning  strikes;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  June  16-22,  2024,  as
Lightning  Safety  Awareness  Week  in  the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
