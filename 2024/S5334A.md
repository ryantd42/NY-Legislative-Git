 LOGICAL  TERROR  THAT  DEPRIVED  GROUPS OF PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT THE
 OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE MANY OF THEIR ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, RELIGIOUS, POLI-
 TICAL AND OTHER CUSTOMS; THE VESTIGES OF SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY CONTIN-
 UED  WITH  THE LEGALIZATION OF SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP STATUS FOR AFRI-
 CAN-AMERICANS THROUGH FROM THE END OF RECONSTRUCTION IN 1876  UNTIL  THE
 CIVIL RIGHTS ERA THAT SPANNED THE 1950S THROUGH 1968, INCLUDING JIM CROW
 LAWS, SEGREGATION AND OTHER SIMILAR PRACTICES; THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY HAS
 PERVADED  THE  FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY; AND IN SPITE OF THESE EVENTS THERE
 ARE ENDLESS EXAMPLES OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE HISTORY OF AFRICANS ON  THE
 CULTURAL,  ECONOMIC,  POLITICAL  AND  SOCIAL  FOUNDATION  OF  THE UNITED
 STATES, THE AMERICAS AND THE ECONOMIES, POLITICS AND SOCIETIES OF EUROPE
 AND BEYOND. THE ENDURING LEGACY OF CHATTEL SLAVERY IN THE UNITED  STATES
 AND THE AMERICAS, INCLUDING THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCT CREATED AND CEMENTED BY
 THE  BIOLOGICAL MYTH OF RACE AND THE RESULTING INEQUITIES AND INJUSTICES
 STEMMING FROM RACISM. THAT WAS CHALLENGED BY THE PERSEVERANCE,  ACTIVISM

 DESCENDANTS AND STAKEHOLDERS, THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

 ATROCITIES  COMMITTED  DURING  THE PERIOD OF THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE AND
 SLAVERY IN AMERICA AND OF THE VESTIGES OF SLAVERY IN THIS  COUNTRY;  AND

 CIPLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DIGNITY IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY.

 AMERICA, THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY ON OUR SOCIETY, THE DEPTH OF THEIR IMPACT
 IN OUR SOCIETY, AND THE TRIUMPHS OF AFRICANS AND THEIR  DESCENDANTS  AND

 THE PROPER CONCERN OF ALL PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN  THE
 SCHOOLS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

 IN  ORDER  TO MITIGATE THE DEVASTATING EFFECT OF RACISM IN EDUCATION AND
 THE COMPLETE MISEDUCATION OF OUR POPULATION AROUND BLACK HISTORY.

 SHALL OVERSEE THE BUDGET AND OPERATION OF THE AMISTAD COMMISSION  AS  IT
 SEEKS  TO  PROVIDE THE STUDENTS OF NEW YORK WITH A  MORE ADEQUATE INCLU-
 SION OF THE HISTORY OF AFRICA, CHATTEL SLAVERY,  THE  AFRICAN  DIASPORA,
