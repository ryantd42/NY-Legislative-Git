  HONORING  Not  On  My  Watch, Inc., in conjunction
  with  the  January  2024  observance  of  Human
  Trafficking Prevention Month
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to commend those
illustrious organizations of the State  of  New  York  whose  focus  and
intent  have  made  a substantial impact on the quality of life in their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Not  On  My Watch, Inc., in conjunction with the January 2024 observance
of Human Trafficking Prevention Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2013, Reverend Que English  launched  Not  On  My  Watch
(NOMW),  a  non-profit  organization  dedicated  to  strengthening
collaborations and building  strategic  partnerships  in  an  effort  to
identify the needs of at-risk and trafficked victims, and providing them
with the resources, awareness, and training that they need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  NOMW  has  evolved  into  a fierce
community advocacy organization for at-risk youth and victims  of  human
trafficking and domestic violence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a  culturally competent organization, NOMW has made it
their mission to combat human trafficking and domestic violence  through
preventive  programs  that  focus  on  education,  training,  community
engagement and providing resources and housing for  victims,  survivors,
and at-risk youth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  NOMW  has  empowered  over  450  houses  of  worship,
organizations, and education institutions with the  tools  necessary  to
combat human trafficking and domestic violence in their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  this  vital organization has hosted national
conferences with more  than  3,000  leaders  and  community  members  in
attendance  to  receive  education and training around human trafficking
and domestic violence; and
 
  WHEREAS, NOMW has worked tirelessly  alongside  national  and  local
organizations  to  pass  key  legislation to protect the most vulnerable
among us; and
 
  WHEREAS, Not On My  Watch  recognizes  that  human  trafficking  and
domestic  violence are both caused by a breakdown in key social systems,
especially when we consider the impact on young girls; and
 
  WHEREAS, For this reason, in 2021, under the guidance and leadership
of  Pamela  Damon,  NOMW  created  Club  Alternatives  G.L.A.M.  (girls,
leaders,  advocates,  mentors)  which  provides  preventive training and
programs designed to empower young girls and females; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through Club Alternatives programs,  training,  activities,
and  community  events  hundreds of girls and young adults have received
life changing resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  NOMW  movements take a holistic and systems-level approach
by engaging key governmental institutions such as  law  enforcement  and
human  services  agencies  alongside  elected officials, community-based
organizations, community advocates, and churches to generate  awareness,
encourage action and establish best practices; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2022, Reverend Dr. Que English passed leadership of Not
On My Watch, Inc. to its current Executive Director, Pamela  Damon,  and
on  Saturday,  December  10th of that same year, the organization opened
its flagship Empowerment Center located in Bronx, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Empowerment  Center  provides  a  hub  of  resources,
trainings,  activities,  and  events  designed to empower and impact the
lives of women and young girls, thus giving its  members  the  necessary
tools to live productive, safe, and empowered lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Not On My Watch,  Inc.,  in  conjunction  with  the  January  2024
observance of Human Trafficking Prevention Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Pamela Damon, Executive Director, Not On My Watch, Inc.
