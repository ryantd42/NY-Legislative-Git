  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

 "whistle" shall mean any sound producing  mechanical  appliance,  except

 a vessel operated by a police  department,  fire  department  or  public
 utility  company, and used only on emergency calls. On vessels less than
 thirty-nine feet in length, a mouth whistle capable of producing a blast
 of two seconds or more in duration, which can  be  heard  for  at  least
 one-half a mile, may be used.
