  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 18, 2023, as Gideon Day in the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, When what is now New York State was still a colony of Great
Britain,  the  common  law recognized that counsel should be assigned by
the court for the defense of persons accused of crime unable to afford a
lawyer; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Sixth Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution,
which was ratified by New York State in 1790, and is part of the Bill of
Rights,  says  that  all  accused persons in criminal prosecutions shall
have the right to assistance of counsel for their defense; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States  Constitution
says  that  States  may  not  deprive  any  person  of life, liberty, or
property without due process of law, and may not  deny  any  person  the
equal protection of the law; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Constitution provides a right to counsel
and  says  that  no  person  shall be denied the equal protection of the
State's laws; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prior to 1963, New York State did not provide  for  routine
appointment  and  payment  of counsel for all people charged with crimes
and financially unable to hire a lawyer for their cases; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States Supreme  Court  recognized  in  1963,  in
Gideon  v  Wainwright,  that  because the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of
counsel is "fundamental and essential to  a  fair  trial,"  it  must  be
enforced  by  the  States  under the Fourteenth Amendment; if people who
lack financial means and are accused of crime had to face their accusers
without legal assistance, constitutional and other rights could  not  be
realized, the decision said; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Gideon Court said that, "from the very beginning, our
state and national constitutions and laws have laid  great  emphasis  on
procedural  and  substantive  safeguards  designed to assure fair trials
before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal  before
the law"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Following the Gideon decision, New York State established a
statutory scheme mandating public defense under County Law article 18-B;
and
 
  WHEREAS, As New York's Court of Appeals said in 2010, "Gideon is not
now  controversial  either  as  an  expression  of what the Constitution
requires or as an exercise in elemental fair play"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gideon's promise of representation has been vital  for  New
Yorkers  in  their  defense and the Gideon decision continues to inspire
work to improve and perfect the right to counsel; and
 
  WHEREAS, March  18,  2023,  is  the  60th  anniversarythe  right  to
counsel; and Gideon v Wainwright decision; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 18, 2023, as  Gideon
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of New  York  State;
the  New York State Defenders Association; and the New York State Office
of Indigent Legal Services.
