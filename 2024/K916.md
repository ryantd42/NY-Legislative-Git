  COMMEMORATING  the  150th Anniversary of the Utica
  Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  commemorate  the
Anniversary  of  the  Utica  Fire  Department  and to honor its past and
present firefighting members for 150 years of  fire  protection  to  the
citizens of Utica, New York, and its surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious  occasion  will  be  celebrated  at  a
Sesquicentennial Dinner, hosted by the Utica Fire Department  Historical
Society,  at  the Doubletree Hotel in Utica, New York, on Saturday, June
1, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day  in  the course of their duties; firefighters exemplify the power of
human compassion and the strength of the American spirit through actions
of the most heroic magnitude; their sacrifices and  selfless  dedication
merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fire companies are an integral part of community protection
services  in every locality of our State; during the past 150 years, the
courageous and devoted firefighters of the Utica  Fire  Department  have
valiantly  responded  to  all types of fire emergencies and have won the
praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 1, 1874, the Utica Fire Department was  established
by  an  act  of  the  New  York  State  Legislature;  the Department was
comprised of 60  firefighters,  one  Chief  and  two  assistants,  seven
stations, four steamer companies, and one truck company; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout the decades since its inception, the Utica Fire
Department has increased its firefighting arsenal by adding stations and
truck companies, a water tower, a  salvage  company,  Emergency  Medical
Response  (EMR) which includes two firefighter/EMTs, a pickup truck, and
an ambulance service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Presently, under Chief  Scott  Ingersoll,  the  Utica  Fire
Department  boasts  134  firefighters,  six  stations,  a  regional fire
academy, four engine companies, two truck companies, a  rescue  company,
and  three  ambulances;  annually, more than 17,000 service calls in the
Utica community receive  responses  from  the  dedicated  personnel  who
selflessly  and  tirelessly  ensure  the  safety  and  welfare  of their
neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS, With its  impressive  force  of  caring  firefighters,  the
record  of  the  Utica  Fire  Department  in  public  service  and  fire
protection is one to be applauded; for 24 hours a day, 365 days a  year,
for  150  years,  whenever  the alarm sounded, these noble men and women
provided aid to their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS, The brave firefighters of the  Utica  Fire  Department  are
prepared  to risk their lives every day to help save the lives of others
 
and to protect homes and property from the destruction  caused  by  fire
and hazards to life, health, and well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to the skill and devoted service demonstrated
by individual firefighters,  the  Utica  Fire  Department  reflects  the
history and development of firefighting over the past 150 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those individuals who recognize that the  preservation  of  life  and
property  is  a  sacred  responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  we  should
give  special  recognition  to  those  who  work  so assiduously for the
betterment of their communities and publicly acknowledge the heroic good
works performed by the fire departments  of  this  great  Empire  State,
their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
proudly commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Utica Fire  Department;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the members of the Utica Fire Department.
