BY: M. of A. Miller
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  130th Anniversary of Morehouse
  Appliances on April 20, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  130th  Anniversary  of  Morehouse  Appliances,  of New
Hartford, New York, which was celebrated on Saturday,  April  20,  2024;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dan  Morehouse,  fourth-generation  owner  of  Morehouse
Appliances, takes pride in being a part of  a  five-generation  business
that  has  been successful through many tumultuous times in this Nation,
including several wars and a pandemic; the Morehouse family's  value  of
focusing  on  the customers is credited with the company's longevity and
success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1894,  Dan  Morehouse's  great-grandfather,  Henry  D.
Morehouse, opened the first store, called H. D. Morehouse, in Utica, New
York;  later,  his  son,  Leslie, worked in the company before and after
World War I took him to Europe; and
 
  WHEREAS, At its inception, the store made and sold horseshoes;  when
automobiles were introduced to the United States, the company adapted to
the lack of demand for horseshoes by constructing stovepipes and selling
stoves,  paving  the way for H. D. Morehouse to begin selling appliances
in the 1920s; today, Morehouse Appliances is one of  the  oldest  Maytag
dealerships  in  the  United States and the oldest appliance retailer in
Central New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, During World War II, people were not able to  purchase  new
appliances;  the  supply  was  not available since all manufacturing was
dedicated to the construction of armaments for the  war;  the  Morehouse
family  allowed  customers  to  trade  their  used appliances toward the
purchase of refurbished ones; the traded appliances would be refurbished
and subsequently sold to other customers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1973, Dan Morehouse's father assumed ownership; in 1992,
the company moved to the present location  in  New  Hartford;  the  next
year, brothers, Dan and Dave Morehouse, acquired the appliance business;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Dan  Morehouse's  daughter,  Ellie, is the store's
office manager and part of the fifth generation of the Morehouse  family
to continue the 130-year-old successful legacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, From its humble beginning until today, Morehouse Appliances
has  drastically  changed;  presently,  the  company  operates  from  a
 
15,000-square-foot facility, employing 11 full-time employees in  sales,
service, and delivery of appliances; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is with great pride that Dan Morehouse and his family of
dedicated  workers  celebrate  this  milestone  130th  Anniversary  and
anticipate many more years of success for generations to come; to  thank
the loyal customers, a special in-store anniversary celebration featured
refreshments, demonstrations, giveaways, and incentives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  progression  of  Morehouse  Appliances  is  in direct
correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its  owners  and  employees,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in all endeavors on behalf of the business and the community
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and State economies, and its vibrant role in improving  the  quality  of
life  in  its  community, fully confident that it will continue to enjoy
the sparkling success it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  130th  Anniversary  of Morehouse Appliances; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Morehouse Appliances.
