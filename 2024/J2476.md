  COMMENDING  Life  of  Hope  upon  the  occasion of
  hosting its Annual Haitian Culture  Day  Parade  and
  Street Festival on May 11, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize the
profound impact of those exemplary organizations within the great  State
of  New  York  which  proactively  work  for the empowerment of cultural
communities, and the importance of such work which benefits all citizens
of this State, and  indeed,  all  citizens  of  the  Nation,  should  be
rightfully commended; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Life  of  Hope upon the occasion of hosting its Haitian Culture
Day Parade and Street Festival on Saturday, May 11, 2024, at the  Hillel
Plaza in Flatbush Junction, Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Life  of  Hope  was founded in 2006, and is a multifaceted
organization that positively impacts the lives of  youth  and  immigrant
families in a manner that reflects both their identity and needs through
innovative  programs and services while fostering greater opportunities;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This illustrious organization serves over 65,000 youth  and
immigrant  families,  preparing  them  for  success  in  obtaining  and
maintaining meaningful careers, and  reflects  New  York  State's  proud
tradition of becoming stronger through the varied tapestry of community;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining true to its mission, Life of Hope is the central
hub of hope, access, critical resources, and prosperity  for  youth  and
immigrant  families  in  Central  Brooklyn,  and  is working towards the
expansion and development of the Life of Hope Community Center to better
transform the lives of residents who continue to suffer from  historical
and ongoing inequities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a champion for the legacy and contributions of Haitian
Americans in the Diaspora, Life of Hope creates a  safe  space  for  the
marginalized  immigrant  community  whose  status  is  exceptionally
vulnerable,  specifically  including  Haitian  Americans,  to  celebrate
heritage  and  culture while connecting individuals with one another and
the community at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, Life of Hope's Annual Haitian Culture Day Parade and Street
Festival celebrates the history and beauty of Haiti and  recognizes  the
economic,  cultural,  and  accessibility  barriers  experienced  but the
community in the face of their troubled history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our society is greatly benefited by the purposeful  efforts
of  individuals who unite for the cause of improving the quality of life
for others, and who proactively work toward the goal of dignity for all;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Life  of  Hope  upon the occasion of hosting its Annual Haitian
Culture Day Parade and Street Festival  on  May  11,  2024;  and  be  it
