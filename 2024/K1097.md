  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as Adolescent  and  Young  Adult  Cancer
  Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as Adolescent
and Young Adult Cancer Awareness Month in the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the observance of National Adolescent and Young Adult
Cancer Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, A local  nonprofit  that  supports  adolescents  and  young
adults  (AYAs)  with cancer, 13thirty Cancer Connect, is partnering with
Monroe County and the  City  of  Rochester,  along  with  several  local
businesses  and organizations to recognize April as AYA Cancer Awareness
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, This annual awareness month is an opportunity  to  shine  a
light on the unique challenges that teen and young adult cancer patients
and survivors face; and
 
  WHEREAS,  13thirty  understands  that  adolescents  and young adults
fighting cancer require more than medicine and treatment;  they  require
socializing  with  other  AYAs,  wellness programs, peer support groups,
music, art and more; the support system this organization has  built  to
fill the gaps in care for AYAs living with cancer is second to none; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  thanks  to  13thirty  Cancer  Connect,  the
community's future business  leaders  are  emerging  from  their  cancer
experience  stronger  and  more  confident, which will contribute to the
vitality and strength of the region; and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital month of  recognition  is  providing  teens  and
young  adults  with  cancer with opportunities to develop healthy habits
during and after treatment, helping to reduce the burden  of  healthcare
within the local community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  is  healing  power  in  connection, compassion, and
emotional safety, which 13thirty provides to address the unique needs of
young people facing cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, 13thirty is an investment that is paying dividends, because
we know that those who are treated with empathy and kindness  today  can
become the compassionate leaders of tomorrow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  organization's  mission to help adolescents and young
adults with cancer live their  very  best  lives  is  served  through  a
variety  of  wellness, expressive arts, and social programs all designed
 
to  meet  the  unique  challenges  facing  this  underserved  and  long
unrecognized group of cancer patients; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Awareness  and education are powerful tools in the race to
find a cure for adolescent and young adult cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS, The health and vitality of  the  people  of  New  York  are
significantly  enhanced  by  local efforts to increase communication and
education pertaining to cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as Adolescent
and Young Adult Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York; and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and 13thirty Cancer Connect.
