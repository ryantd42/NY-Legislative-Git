 LOCAL GOVERNMENT, WHO UNDER COLOR OF  LAW,  SUBJECTS  OR  CAUSES  TO  BE
 SUBJECTED,  INCLUDING  FAILING  TO  INTERVENE,  ANY  OTHER PERSON TO THE
 DEPRIVATION OF ANY INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS THAT CREATE BINDING OBLIGATIONS  ON

 STATE CONSTITUTION, IS LIABLE TO THE INJURED PARTY FOR LEGAL OR  EQUITA-
 BLE RELIEF OR ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF.
