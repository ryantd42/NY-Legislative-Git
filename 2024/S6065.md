 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law,  in  relation  to  immediate
  enforcement of securing orders
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 510.50 of the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 section 9 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
 § 510.50 Enforcement of securing order.
  [1.] When the attendance of a principal confined in the custody of the
 sheriff is required at the criminal action or proceeding at a particular
 time  and  place,  the court may compel such attendance by directing the
 sheriff to produce the principal at such time and place. If the  princi-
 pal  is  at  liberty on the principal's own recognizance or non-monetary
 conditions or on bail, the principal's attendance  may  be  achieved  or
 compelled by various methods, including notification and the issuance of
 a  bench warrant, prescribed by law in provisions governing such matters
 with respect to the particular kind of action or proceeding involved.
  [2. Except when the principal is charged with a  new  crime  while  at
 liberty, absent relevant, credible evidence demonstrating that a princi-
 pal's  failure  to  appear for a scheduled court appearance was willful,
 the court, prior to issuing a bench warrant for a failure to appear  for
 a  scheduled  court appearance, shall provide at least forty-eight hours
 notice to the principal or the principal's counsel that the principal is
 required to appear, in order to give the  principal  an  opportunity  to
 appear voluntarily.]
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
