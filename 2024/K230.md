  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 26, 2023, as Purple Day in the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious health
issues which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  hereby memorializes
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 26, 2023, as Purple Day  in  the
State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National Purple
Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Epilepsy  Awareness  Day has become known as Purple Day as
people are encouraged  to  wear  the  color  to  increase  awareness  of
Epilepsy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Celebrated annually on March 26th, Epilepsy Awareness Day,
or Purple Day, was created to increase  the  public's  understanding  of
this brain disorder and to eliminate the fear and stigma surrounding it;
and
 
  WHEREAS, With over 3.5 million people diagnosed with epilepsy in the
United  States  and  over  50  million  worldwide, it is likely you know
someone living with the day-to-day challenges epilepsy brings; the  good
news  is  epilepsy  can  be  easily  managed  if  diagnosed  and treated
correctly, so awareness and research are important; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cassidy Megan from Nova Scotia,  Canada,  founded  Epilepsy
Awareness  Day  with the first event held on March 26, 2008; she decided
to  use  the  color  purple  because  lavender  is  recognized  as  the
international flower of epilepsy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Motivated by her own diagnosis and struggles of living with
epilepsy,  Megan  realized the importance of everyone understanding this
common neurological disorder; she then created an avenue for  people  to
learn, engage, and support the public's education of epilepsy as well as
dispel the myths and fears surrounding it; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Epilepsy is caused by electrical disturbances in the brain
resulting in seizures of various types; it can be a scary  condition  to
people  who  do  not  understand what is going on, which has led to many
unnecessary  assumptions  and  even  laws  about  the  disease  and  the
capabilities of those who live with it; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Epilepsy  is  the fourth most common neurological disorder
after migraines, strokes, and Alzheimer's; estimates show that one in 26
Americans will develop epilepsy at some point in their life; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2009, the Anita Kaufmann Foundation partnered  with  the
Epilepsy  Association of Nova Scotia to launch Purple Day, bringing more
collective attention and structured campaigns to the purpose of the  day
 
in the United States and internationally; more than 100,000 students, 95
workplaces,  and  116 politicians participated in Purple Day events that
same year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Anita  Kaufmann  Foundation trademarked Purple Day in
2011, and it has continued to expand its reach since; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 26, 2023, as Purple
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
