BY: M. of A. Conrad
 
  HONORING Thomas Falzarano upon the occasion of his
  designation  as  a  recipient  of an Honor Flight on
  June 15, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the Armed Services from the State of  New  York,
who  have  served  so  faithfully  and courageously in wars in which our
Nation's freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation  of  peace
during  peacetime,  deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with which these men and women served their country, and must  recognize
that  no  greater  debt  is  owed than that owed to those who gave their
lives for their beloved Nation and to those who continue to  be  missing
in action; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud to honor Thomas
Falzarano upon the occasion of his designation  as  a  recipient  of  an
Honor Flight on Saturday, June 15, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Honor Flights are an opportunity to recognize and thank the
Americans  who  secured  our  freedom  by  bringing them to the Nation's
capital to see the memorials that commemorate their service, giving them
a hero's welcome every step of the way; and
 
  WHEREAS, Participation in an Honor Flight trip  gives  veterans  the
opportunity  to  share  this  momentous  occasion  with  other comrades,
remember the fallen, and share their stories and experiences with  other
veterans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  Honor Flight Network commends those who served
during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War,  and  veterans  of
any  service  era  who are critically ill; in New York State alone, more
than 5,000 members of our armed services have fulfilled  their  wish  of
visiting  our  Nation's capital and all its sites and memorials honoring
our country's great history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thomas Falzarano  is  justly  deserving  of  this  esteemed
privilege  and  opportunity  for  his  dedicated service with the United
States Navy beginning in 1967; he was stationed in San Diego, California
until his deployment to Vietnam where  he  served  as  a  communications
specialist from 1970-1971; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  his  discharge  from  the  Navy, Thomas Falzarano, a
Richmondville native, moved to Buffalo, New York, where he  enrolled  in
D'youville  College,  and later met his cherished life partner and wife,
Martha; and
 
  WHEREAS, After  graduating  from  D'youville  College  1976,  Thomas
Falzarano  went  on  to  leave  his  mark  on his community as a special
education teacher in the Buffalo Public School District and as a  father
of three daughters and grandfather of two grandchildren; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having exhibited their patriotism both at home and abroad,
these brave men and women of our military have demonstrated  their  love
for  their  country  and merit forevermore, the highest respect of their
State and Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Thomas Falzarano  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as  a
recipient of an Honor Flight on June 15, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Thomas Falzarano.
