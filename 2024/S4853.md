 as follows:
  5.  "[Oil,  gas]  SOLAR  or  wind  [exploration,]  development  [or
 extraction]  activities"  means the installation and use of fixtures and
 equipment which are necessary for  the  [exploration,]  development  [or
 extraction]  of  [oil,  natural gas] SOLAR or wind energy, including BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, access roads, [drilling apparatus,  pumping  facilities,
 pipelines,] SOLAR PANELS and wind turbines.
  §  2. Subparagraph (iv) of paragraph d of subdivision 1 of section 305
 of the agriculture and markets law, as amended by  chapter  565  of  the
 laws of 2003, is amended to read as follows:
  (iv)  If  such land or any portion thereof is converted to a use other

 [exploration,]  development,  [or extraction activity] or by virtue of a
 taking by eminent domain or other involuntary proceeding  other  than  a
 tax  sale,  the  land  or  portion  so converted shall not be subject to
 payments. If the land so converted  constitutes  only  a  portion  of  a

 the proportionate part of the agricultural  assessment  attributable  to

 tural district and eligible for an agricultural assessment shall not  be
 considered  to  have been converted to a use other than for agricultural

 and markets law, as amended by chapter 565  of  the  laws  of  2003,  is

 or by virtue of a taking by eminent domain or other involuntary proceed-
 ing other than a tax sale, the land or portion so converted shall not be
 subject to payments. If land so converted constitutes only a portion  of
 a  parcel described on the assessment roll, the assessor shall apportion
 the assessment, and adjust the agricultural assessment  attributable  to
 the  portion of the parcel not subject to such conversion by subtracting

 unique  farmland  and farmland of statewide importance as such terms are
 defined in 7 C.F.R. § 657.5, encourage the development of  solar  activ-
 ities on marginal soils, and minimize the loss of forested land.
