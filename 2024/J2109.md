  COMMEMORATING  the 90th Anniversary of the Jericho
  Fire Department on April 6, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is  proud  to  commemorate  the  90th
Anniversary  of  the  Jericho  Fire  Department, to be celebrated at its
Annual Installation Dinner on Saturday, April 6, 2024, and to honor  its
past and present firefighting members for 90 years of fire protection to
the citizens of Jericho, New York, and its surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection services in every locality of our State; during the  past  90
years,  the  courageous  and  devoted  firefighters  of the Jericho Fire
Department have valiantly responded to all types of fire emergencies and
have won the praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1933, a group of dedicated men recognized  the  need  to
protect  their  community  from  the  perils  of fire joined together to
create the Jericho Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, nine decades later, that same  spirit  of  community
service  remains  among the 85 men and women who unselfishly offer their
time and talents to serve the residents and businesses  of  the  Jericho
Fire District; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  the  Jericho  Fire  Department has
evolved  into  an  all-risks  emergency  response  agency,  currently
responding to more than 1,200 alarms each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining true to its mission, the Jericho Fire Department
provides prompt, professional, fire and emergency response to the hamlet
of Jericho  and  the  surrounding  area;  its  team  values  innovation,
education,  and  ideas  which enable them to save lives, reduce property
loss, and improve emergency services to meet the  changing  life  safety
needs of citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  able  leadership  of  its Chief of Department,
Christopher M. Foresto, MD, the Jericho Fire Department proudly provides
the following services:  Fire  Prevention  and  Safety  Education,  Fire
Suppression,  Emergency  Medical  Services (at the Advanced Life Support
level), Hazardous Materials Response, and Technical Rescue; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a membership of dedicated firefighters, the record  of
the Jericho Fire Department in public service and fire protection is one
to  be  envied;  for  24 hours a day, for 365 days a year, for 90 years,
whenever the alarm sounded, these noble volunteers left their homes  and
went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave firefighters of the Jericho Fire Department are
prepared to risk their lives every day to help save the lives of  others
and  to  protect homes and property from the destruction caused by fire;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the skill and devoted  service  demonstrated
by  individual  firefighters,  the  Jericho Fire Department reflects the
history and development of firefighting over the past 90 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  we  should
give  special  recognition  to  those  who  work  so assiduously for the
betterment of their communities, and  acknowledge  publicly  the  heroic
good  works  performed  by  the volunteer fire departments of this great
Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly commemorate the 90th Anniversary of the Jericho Fire Department;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Jericho Fire Department.
