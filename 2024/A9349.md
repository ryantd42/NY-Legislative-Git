 AN ACT to amend the civil service law, in  relation  to  updating  civil
  service examinations
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 6 of section 50 of the civil  service  law,  as
 added by chapter 790 of the laws of 1958, is amended to read as follows:
  6.  Scope  of  examinations.  Examinations shall be practical in their
 character and shall relate to those matters which will fairly  test  the
 relative  capacity  and fitness of the persons examined to discharge the
 duties of that service into which they seek to be appointed.  The  state
 civil  service  department  or  appropriate municipal commission, as the
 case may be, may establish an eligible list  on  the  basis  of  ratings
 received  by  the candidates in the competitive portions of the examina-
 tion and thereafter conduct  medical,  physical  and  other  appropriate
 non-competitive  qualifying  tests  from  time  to  time as the need for
 certifications from the eligible list  may  require.  BEGINNING  IN  TWO
 THOUSAND  TWENTY-FIVE,  THE  STATE CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT SHALL REVIEW
 AND UPDATE THE QUESTIONS CONTAINED WITHIN  THE  EXAMINATION,  AS  DEEMED
 APPROPRIATE  BY  THE DEPARTMENT, NO LESS THAN EVERY FIVE YEARS.  NOTHING
 IN THIS SECTION SHALL PROHIBIT THE STATE CIVIL SERVICE  DEPARTMENT  FROM
 REVIEWING OR UPDATING THE EXAMINATIONS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED UPDATE, AS
 THE DEPARTMENT DEEMS APPROPRIATE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
