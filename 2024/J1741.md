  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 10, 2024, as Snowmobile  Ride  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that  are  set  aside  to  promote  the  participation  of
recreational activities in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 10, 2024, as
Snowmobile Ride Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the
observance of International Snowmobile Ride Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Celebrated  annually  on  the second Saturday in February,
International Snowmobile Ride Day is a  day  to  encourage  everyone  to
bundle up for an exciting adventure outside on a snowmobile; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International  Snowmobile  Ride Day celebrates the love of
the outdoors and winter; snowfall in the  winter  provides  the  perfect
landscape for snowmobiling; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A snowmobile is a motorized vehicle designed to operate on
snow or ice, using tracks or runners on the bottom to move the  machine;
snowmobiles  do not travel on the open road, but instead on open terrain
or on trails; the design is specific for use during  the  winter  months
for travel and recreation; depending on where you live, a snowmobile can
go  by  several other names, including ski-doo, snowmachine, sled, motor
sled, and skimobile; and
 
  WHEREAS, Winter is one of the most beautiful seasons, however,  many
people miss out on that beauty because of the cold; snowmobiling a great
way  to  experience  that  beauty; riding a snowmobile can take you over
hundreds of miles of hard-to-reach landscapes; and
 
  WHEREAS, In  fact,  snowmobiling  allows  you  to  explore  gorgeous
scenery  of  snow  covered  hills,  plains, and mountain trails; imagine
traveling on a trail and you stop to overlook a canyon as the  sun  goes
down;  the  glow of the winter sun emitting off of pure white snow looks
like miles and miles of sparkling gems glowing in different hues of red,
orange, and yellow; and
 
  WHEREAS, Driving a snowmobile is easy to learn; whether  you  are  a
part  of  a  snowmobiling club or you ride as a hobby, anyone can ride a
snowmobile; the entire family, from kids to grandparents, can  learn  to
drive a snowmobile quickly by simply pushing buttons; and
 
  WHEREAS, Once you learn the basic parts of a snowmobile, you will be
on the trail in no time making winter fun again and making memories that
will last you a life time; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body, representing the people of the State
of  New  York, supports this vital day of recognition and encourages the
 
citizens of this great Empire State to participate  in  Snowmobile  Ride
Day  activities scheduled throughout the state and to bring attention to
such  activities  that  bolster  our  state's  economic  and  overall
well-being; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  February  10,  2024,  as
Snowmobile Ride Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
