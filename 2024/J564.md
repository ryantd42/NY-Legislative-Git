  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its

City  neighborhoods  meet  community  needs,  from affordable housing to
quality jobs by working hand-in-hand  with  community-based  nonprofits,
government  agencies,  technical assistance providers, and philanthropic
funders; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  vital  organization  truly  believes  New  York  City
neighborhoods  are  at their best, as places to live, do business, work,
and raise families,  when  they  are  racially  diverse  and  culturally
dynamic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  activating  impact-oriented  partnerships,  LISC  NYC
diligently works to ensure that our city is one  of  shared  prosperity;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, LISC NYC has invested over $3 billion,
leveraged  an  additional  $7.6  billion  in  support  of  low-  and
moderate-income New York City  communities,  resulting  in  over  42,000
affordable homes built and preserved, and nearly 2.5 million square feet
of  retail  and  community  space  preserved,  helping  to  stabilize
neighborhoods; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of LISC NYC is in  direct  correlation  to  the
efforts  of  its  members,  whose  involvement  is, and always has been,
characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
 
an  uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of
the institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
organizations which enhance the quality of life in their  community  and

standards in their profession, certainly have earned the recognition and
applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore,
