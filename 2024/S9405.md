  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The vehicle and traffic law is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 404-ff to read as follows:
  § 404-FF. DISTINCTIVE PLATES FOR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGISTS. 1. ANY MEDICAL
 TECHNOLOGIST  SHALL, UPON REQUEST, BE ISSUED A LICENSE PLATE BEARING THE
 EMBLEM AND WORDS "NEW YORK STATE" ON THE TOP OF THE  LICENSE  PLATE  AND
 "MEDICAL  TECHNOLOGIST"  ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LICENSE PLATE. APPLICATION
 FOR SAID LICENSE PLATE SHALL BE FILED WITH THE COMMISSIONER IN SUCH FORM
 AND DETAIL AS THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PRESCRIBE  AND  SHALL  BE  VERIFIED
 ANNUALLY BY THE APPLICANT.
  2. THE DISTINCTIVE PLATE AUTHORIZED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL  BE  ISSUED UPON PROOF, SATISFACTORY TO THE COMMISSIONER, THAT THE
 APPLICANT IS PRESENTLY A MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIST.
  3. A DISTINCTIVE PLATE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE ISSUED
 IN THE SAME MANNER AS OTHER NUMBER PLATES UPON PAYMENT  OF  THE  REGULAR
 REGISTRATION FEE PRESCRIBED BY SECTION FOUR HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE,
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT AN ADDITIONAL ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGE OF FIFTEEN
 DOLLARS SHALL BE CHARGED FOR SUCH PLATE.
  § 2. 1. A distinctive plate established pursuant to section 404-ff  of
 the  vehicle and traffic law shall only be designed, produced and issued
 upon the delivery to the department of motor vehicles of a  surety  bond
 in  the  amount  of  $6,000, which shall be executed by a surety company
 authorized by the department of financial services to transact  business
 in  this  state.  Provided,  however,  that if the commissioner of motor
 vehicles shall have received prior to plate design, production and issu-
 ance at least 200 orders for such distinctive plate  together  with  the
 additional  annual  service  charge applicable to each such order, which
 shall be non-refundable, no such surety  bond  shall  be  required.  All
 service  charges  collected  pursuant to this section shall be deposited

 ution of distinctive license plates  in  accordance  with  such  section
