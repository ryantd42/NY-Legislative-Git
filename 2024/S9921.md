 Introduced  by  Sen. SKOUFIS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation  to  permitting  unvented
  attics  and unvented enclosed rafter assemblies to be sealed with air-
  impermeable insulation in order to help attain  building  decarboniza-
  tion goals

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and  intent.  The  legislature  hereby
 finds  and  declares  it  necessary to amend the state fire and building
 code  to  better  align  with  the  Climate  Leadership  and  Community
 Protection Act.
  New  York's six million buildings are responsible for around one-third
 of statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Advancing building  energy  effi-
 ciency  and  electrification  is a cornerstone of the state's efforts to
 achieve carbon neutrality and meet emissions reduction goals.
  Modernizing and decarbonizing New York's buildings  will  also  create
 healthier living and working environments, reduce consumer energy costs,
 and add thousands of local clean energy and energy efficiency jobs.
  As New York state transitions into all-electric building construction,
 a  well-insulated and sealed home is integral for the maximum efficiency
 of a heat pump and onsite renewables. Buildings with HVAC equipment  and
 ducts  located  in  a  vented  attic  have  excessive energy consumption
 because of the inhospitable environment in which they are located.
  Unvented attics and unvented enclosed rafter  assemblies  sealed  with
 air-impermeable  insulation  provides  additional benefits as heat pumps
 and onsite renewables work best in spaces that don't waste energy due to
 low insulation levels or airflow leaks. The use of air-impermeable insu-
 lation in this manner aids the state's efforts and targets  on  building
 decarbonization and energy efficiency.
  Accordingly, the legislature finds it necessary to update the building
 and energy codes to permit the use of spray polyurethane foam insulation
 in  the  construction of unvented attics as an additional option to meet
 code requirements.

  § 2. Section 378 of the executive law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 subdivision 21 to read as follows:
  21.  UNVENTED  ATTICS  AND  UNVENTED  ENCLOSED  RAFTER  ASSEMBLIES. TO
 SUPPORT THE GOAL OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND  HELP  ACHIEVE
 THE  STATE'S  CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE AGENDA, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH  WITHIN  CHAPTER  ONE
 HUNDRED  SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, ALSO KNOWN AS THE NEW
 YORK STATE CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND  COMMUNITY  PROTECTION  ACT,  UNVENTED
 ATTIC  AND  UNVENTED ENCLOSED RAFTER ASSEMBLIES INSULATED AND AIR SEALED
 WITH AIR-IMPERMEABLE INSULATION WITH R-30, MAXIMUM  U-FACTOR  OF  0.038,
 INSULATION  SHALL  BE DEEMED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION R402 OF
 THE ENERGY CONSERVATION CONSTRUCTION CODE OF NEW YORK STATE, PROVIDED:
  1. THE HOUSE SHALL ATTAIN A BLOWER DOOR TEST RESULT LESS THAN TWO  AND
 ONE-HALF ACH50.
  2.  THE HOUSE SHALL REQUIRE A POSITIVE, BALANCED OR HYBRID WHOLE HOUSE
 MECHANICAL VENTILATION SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT RELY SOLELY  ON  A  NEGATIVE
 PRESSURE STRATEGY.
  3.  WHERE  INSULATION IS INSTALLED BELOW THE ROOF DECK AND THE EXPOSED
 PORTION OF ROOF RAFTERS ARE NOT ALREADY COVERED BY THE R-30 DEPTH OF THE
 AIR-IMPERMEABLE INSULATION, THE EXPOSED  PORTION  OF  THE  ROOF  RAFTERS
 SHALL  BE  INSULATED  BY  MINIMUM  R-3  UNLESS  DIRECTLY  COVERED  BY
 DRYWALL/FINISHED CEILING. ROOF RAFTERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE COVERED BY
 MINIMUM R-3 IF A CONTINUOUS INSULATION IS INSTALLED ABOVE THE ROOF DECK.
  4. INDOOR HEATING, COOLING, AND VENTILATION EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING DUCT-
 WORK, SHALL BE INSIDE THE BUILDING THERMAL ENVELOPE.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become  a  law.  Effective  immediately,  the  state  fire
 prevention  and  building  code  council  shall promulgate the standards
 required by this act.
