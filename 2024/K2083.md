Assembly Resolution No. 2083
 
BY: M. of A. Slater
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the
  Yorktown Grange Fair
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
organizations and  businesses  of  this  great  Empire  State  who  make
significant contributions to their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Yorktown Grange Fair, hosted by
Yorktown  Grange  No.  862 on the weekend of September 6-8, 2024, at the
Yorktown Fairgrounds; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fairs and festivals  empower  communities  to  attract  new
visitors while capitalizing on local commercial and cultural value; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Yorktown  Grange Fair has drastically progressed from
its humble  beginning,  burgeoning  from  the  agriculture  and  farming
industry, with the inaugural fair being held on October 19, 1923, at the
site of the first Grange Hall in Yorktown; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Yorktown  Grange  Fair  is  a  product  of  friendly
competition spanning back a  century;  farmers  in  the  community  were
inspired  to  create  a  way to foster friendly competition in regard to
growing and comparing their best vegetables, and, in that year of  1923,
the fair as it is loved today was born; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  early  displays  of produce, baking, and flowers were
auctioned off after being judged, creating a traditional finale  to  the
fair; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  the popularity of the fair grew, the crowds became too
large for the small Grange Hall; starting in 1946, the fair was moved to
the then Yorktown School, now the Community and Cultural Center, in  the
middle  of  Yorktown  Heights;  the  gymnasium was used for exhibits and
tents were put up outside to  accommodate  livestock  and  the  sale  of
commercial space; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  testament  to  its  ever-growing  success, the Yorktown
Grange Fair was awarded first place in a statewide competition,  winning
a plaque, and receiving a monetary prize of $200; on the national level,
the fair was awarded a $500 prize and an additional plaque; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a newfound passion to take the Yorktown Grange Fair to
new  heights,  by-laws  were  created in December of 1954, and the first
Fair Association was thereby created and officially met  for  its  first
meeting  on  February  24, 1955; the creation of this new entity allowed
for business relations and planning of the fair to be done for the first
time outside of organized Grange meetings; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Yorktown Grange Fair still provides a showcase for  the
town's residents and surrounding areas to present their goods, including
vegetables, flowers, needlework, baking, livestock, and poultry; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, This year's theme for the fair is "Centennial Celebration -
100  Years  of  Family  Fun";  generations  of families and friends will
attend this year's fair to enjoy amazing livestock exhibits, sensational
art  shows,  thrilling  rides,  delicious  food,  live  music,  and  an
atmosphere of fun and friendship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a  result of the sparkling success of this established
event, the Yorktown Grange Fair has been able to  return  donations  and
provide  financial  support  to  various  organizations  within  their
community, making a proper investment in the  future  of  the  town  and
those who reside within it; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  past  century,  the  Yorktown  Grange  Fair has
demonstrated an unrelenting commitment to provide  cultural  enrichment,
lessons  in  history  and  agriculture,  as well as entertainment to its
community, and, as a result, has brought pride and  recognition  to  its
local community and to our great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Yorktown Grange Fair; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Yorktown  Grange  No.  862,  organizers of the Yorktown
Grange Fair.
