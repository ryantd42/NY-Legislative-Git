  HONORING  Firefighter  Willard H. Streiff Jr. upon
  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition  after  55 years of dedicated service to
  the Floyd Volunteer Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are inspired  by,  and
indebted  to,  our  noble  firefighters  who exhibit courage and bravery
every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Firefighter
Willard H. Streiff Jr. upon the occasion of his designation for  special
recognition  after  55 years of dedicated service to the Floyd Volunteer
Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Willard H. Streiff  Jr.  has  consistently  demonstrated  a
level  of  commitment,  dedication, integrity, and professionalism which
truly exemplifies excellence in the firefighting service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, dedication and integrity; these respected men and women are often
the first to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is  a  fire,
transportation  accident,  natural  disaster,  act of terrorism, medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others,  and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Willard  Streiff  Jr.  is such a firefighter; throughout his 55 years of
devoted service, he heroically performed, above and beyond the  call  of
duty,  those  responsibilities which define the task of fire protection;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Firefighter  Willard  H.  Streiff  Jr.  upon  the occasion of his
designation for special recognition after 55 years of dedicated  service
to the Floyd Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter Willard H. Streiff Jr.
