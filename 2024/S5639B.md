 persons.  HEALTH  BENEFITS  SHALL INCLUDE AT  LEAST ONE OPTION FOR PLAN
 PARTICIPANTS  FOR  COVERAGE FOR AT LEAST EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE USUAL AND
 CUSTOMARY COST OF EACH OUT-OF-NETWORK HEALTH  CARE SERVICE. AS  USED  IN

 implement  the  provisions  of  such agreement consistent with the terms
 thereof and to the extent necessary shall  adopt  regulations  providing

 whole  or in part, PROVIDED THAT SUCH BENEFITS ARE NOT A DIMINISHMENT OF
 CURRENT EXISTING BENEFITS to employees not subject to the provisions  of
 such agreement.
