immediately acted; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Without  hesitation,  Christopher  Dick  secured  the fire
extinguishers he had just  purchased  that  morning,  and  his  daughter
calmed  the  homeowner,  preventing  her  from returning to the blaze to
rescue her pets; and
 
  WHEREAS, A member of the East Greenbush Fire Company  for  30  years
and experienced in EMS dispatch, Christopher Dick utilized multiple fire
extinguishers  to  knock  down  the kitchen door and control the airflow

prevention  of  the  destruction of a residence and the devastation of a
community member's life; and
 
  WHEREAS, A truly courageous man, Christopher  Dick  played  a  vital
role  in  this  extraordinary rescue effort and should be praised by the
people of this great Empire State for his astute actions  in  attempting
to preserve the lives of others; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  In his spontaneous and heroic act, Christopher Dick has so
aptly  demonstrated  his  character  and  compassion  for  others,
personifying,  by  virtue  of  his  actions,  the  collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond without thought of danger or reward when fellow constituents are
in need of aid; and

full praise for their noble endeavors; now, therefore, be it
