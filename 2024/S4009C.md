 eighty-six of this chapter, AND (II) ANY SUCH TAXPAYER THAT IS AN ELIGI-
 BLE  FARMER,  AS  DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION ELEVEN OF THIS SECTION, MAY FOR

 amended by chapter 170 of the laws  of  1994,  is  amended  to  read  as

 taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
 allowed  for  a taxable year commencing prior to January first, nineteen
 hundred eighty-seven may be carried over to the following year or  years
 and  may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years, but
 in no event shall such credit be carried over to taxable years  commenc-
 ing  on  or  after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven, and any
 amount of credit allowed for a taxable year commencing on or after Janu-
 ary first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven and not deductible in such year
 may be carried over to the ten taxable years next following such taxable

 as  an  owner  of  a  new business for purposes of paragraph ten of this
 subsection may, at [his] THE TAXPAYER'S option, receive such excess as a
 refund, AND (B) A TAXPAYER THAT IS AN  ELIGIBLE  FARMER  AS  DEFINED  IN

 graph shall be deemed to be  a  refund  of  an  overpayment  of  tax  as
 provided  in  section  six hundred eighty-six of this article, provided,

 If the total amount of allocated credits applied for  under  this  para-

  (b)  unless  the owner shall have held an exemption under this section
 for [his] THE OWNER'S previous residence or  unless  the  title  of  the
 property shall have been vested in the owner or one of the owners of the

 making application for exemption, provided, however, that in  the  event
 of  the  death  of  [either a husband or wife] A MARRIED PERSON in whose
 name title of the property shall have been vested at the time  of  death
 and then becomes vested solely in [the survivor] SUCH PERSON'S SURVIVING
 SPOUSE  by  virtue of devise by or descent from the deceased [husband or
 wife] SPOUSE, the time of ownership of  the  property  by  the  deceased
 [husband or wife] SPOUSE shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the
 [survivor]  SURVIVING  SPOUSE and such ownership shall be deemed contin-
 uous for the purposes of computing such  period  of  twelve  consecutive
 months.  In  the event of a transfer by [either a husband or wife to the
 other] A MARRIED PERSON TO SUCH PERSON'S spouse of all or  part  of  the
 title  to  the  property,  the  time of ownership of the property by the
 transferor spouse shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the trans-
 feree spouse and such ownership  shall  be  deemed  continuous  for  the
 purposes  of  computing  such period of twelve consecutive months. Where
 property of the owner or owners has been acquired  to  replace  property
 formerly  owned  by  such owner or owners and taken by eminent domain or
 other involuntary proceeding, except a tax sale, the period of ownership
 of the former property shall be combined with the period of ownership of
 the property for which application is made for exemption and such  peri-
 ods  of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for purposes of this
 section. Where a residence is sold and replaced with another within  one
 year  and  both residences are within the state, the period of ownership
 of both properties shall be  deemed  consecutive  for  purposes  of  the
 exemption from taxation by a municipality within the state granting such
 exemption. Where the owner or owners transfer title to property which as
 of  the  date  of  transfer  was exempt from taxation or PILOT under the
 provisions of this section, the reacquisition of title by such owner  or
 owners  within  nine  months  of the date of transfer shall be deemed to
 satisfy the requirement of this paragraph that the title of the property
 shall have been vested in the owner or one of the owners for such period
 of twelve consecutive months. Where, upon or subsequent to the death  of
 an owner or owners, title to property which as of the date of such death
 was exempt from taxation or PILOT under such provisions, becomes vested,
 by  virtue of devise or descent from the deceased owner or owners, or by
 transfer by any other means within nine months after such death,  solely
 in  a  person or persons who, at the time of such death, maintained such
 property as a primary residence, the requirement of this paragraph  that
 the  title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or one of
 the owners for such period of twelve consecutive months shall be  deemed
 satisfied;
  (c)  unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes,
 provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is not
 so used exclusively for residential  purposes  but  is  used  for  other
 purposes,  such  portion  shall  be subject to taxation or PILOT and the
 S. 4009  31  A. 3009

 remaining portion only shall be entitled to the  exemption  provided  by
 this section;
  (d) unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied
 in  whole or in part by the owner or by all of the owners of the proper-
 ty: except where, (i) an  owner  is  absent  from  the  residence  while
 receiving  health-related  care  as an inpatient of a residential health
 care facility, as defined in section twenty-eight  hundred  one  of  the
 public  health  law,  provided  that  any income accruing to that person
 shall only be income only to the extent that it exceeds the amount  paid
 by  such  owner,  spouse,  or  co-owner  for  care  in the facility, and
 provided further, that during such  confinement  such  property  is  not
 occupied  by  other  than the spouse or co-owner of such owner; or, (ii)
 the real property is owned by a [husband and/or wife, or  an  ex-husband
 and/or an ex-wife, and either] MARRIED PERSON OR A MARRIED COUPLE, OR BY
 A  FORMERLY  MARRIED PERSON OR A FORMERLY MARRIED COUPLE, AND ONE SPOUSE
 OR EX-SPOUSE is absent from the residence due to  divorce,  legal  sepa-
 ration  or  abandonment and all other provisions of this section are met
 provided that where  an  exemption  was  previously  granted  when  both
 resided  on the property, then the person remaining on the real property
 shall be sixty-two years of age or over.
  § 3. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3-a of section 467 of the real prop-
 erty tax law, as amended by section 1 of part B of chapter  686  of  the
 laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:

 property owned  by  a  cooperative  apartment  corporation  in  which  a
 tenant-stockholder  of such corporation resides and which is represented
 by [his] THE TENANT-STOCKHOLDER'S share  or  shares  of  stock  in  such
 corporation  as  determined by its or their proportional relationship to
 the total outstanding stock of the corporation, including that owned  by
 the  corporation, shall be deemed to be vested in such tenant-stockhold-
 er.

 such  forms,  and  shall be filed in such assessor's office on or before
 the appropriate taxable status date. Notwithstanding any other provision
 of law, at the option of the municipal corporation, any person otherwise
 qualifying under this section shall not be denied  the  exemption  under
 this  section  if [he] SUCH PERSON becomes sixty-five years of age after
 the appropriate taxable status date and on or  before  December  thirty-
 first of the same year.
  5-a.  Any  local law or ordinance adopted pursuant to paragraph (a) of
 subdivision one of this section may be amended, or a local law or  ordi-
 nance  may  be  adopted  to provide, notwithstanding subdivision five of
 this section, that an application for such exemption may be  filed  with
 the  assessor  after  the  appropriate taxable status date but not later
 than the last date on which a petition with  respect  to  complaints  of

 the exemption to be granted. The assessing authority shall, within three
 days of the completion and filing  of  the  tentative  assessment  roll,
 notify  by mail any applicant [who has included with his] WHOSE applica-
 tion INCLUDES at least one self-addressed,  pre-paid  envelope,  of  the
 approval  or  denial  of  the  application;  provided, however, that the
 assessing authority shall, upon the receipt and filing of  the  applica-
 tion,  send  by  mail  notification  of receipt to any applicant who has
 included two of such envelopes with the application. Where an  applicant
 is  entitled  to  a  notice of denial pursuant to this subdivision, such
 notice shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall state
 the reasons for such denial and shall further state that  the  applicant
 may  have  such  determination  reviewed  in the manner provided by law.
 Failure to mail any such application form or notices or the  failure  of
 such  person  to  receive  any  of  the same shall not prevent the levy,
 collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes or PILOT on prop-
 erty owned by such person.
  (b) Except in cities of one million or more, any person who  has  been
 granted  exemption  pursuant  to  this  section  on five (5) consecutive
 completed assessment rolls, including any years when the  exemption  was
 granted  to a property owned by [a husband and/or wife] A MARRIED PERSON
 OR A MARRIED COUPLE while both SPOUSES resided in such  property,  shall
 not  be  subject  to the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this
 subdivision provided the governing board of the  municipality  in  which
 said property is situated after public hearing adopts a local law, ordi-
 nance  or  resolution  providing  therefor  however said person shall be
 mailed an application form and a notice [informing him of  his]  SETTING
 FORTH SUCH PERSON'S rights. Such exemption shall be automatically grant-
 ed  on each subsequent assessment roll. Provided, however, that when tax
 payment is made by such person a sworn affidavit must be  included  with
 such payment which shall state that such person continues to be eligible
 for  such exemption. Such affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by the
 commissioner. If such affidavit is not included with  the  tax  payment,
 the  collecting  officer  shall proceed pursuant to section five hundred
 fifty-one-a of this chapter.
  (c) In cities of one million or more, any person who has been  granted
 exemption  pursuant to this section shall file the completed application
 with the appropriate assessing authority every twenty-four  months  from
 the date such exemption was granted without the necessity of having been
 granted  exemption  pursuant  to  this  section  on five (5) consecutive
 completed assessment rolls including any years when  the  exemption  was
 granted  to a property owned by [a husband and/or wife] A MARRIED PERSON
 OR A MARRIED COUPLE while both SPOUSES resided in such property.
  § 6. Subdivision 8-a of section 467 of the real property tax  law,  as

 amended to read as follows:
 S. 4009  33  A. 3009
 
  8-a. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,  the  local
 governing  body of a municipal corporation that is authorized to adopt a
 local law pursuant to subdivision  eight  of  this  section  is  further
 authorized  to adopt a local law providing that where a renewal applica-
 tion  for the exemption authorized by this section has not been filed on
 or before the taxable status date, and  the  owner  believes  that  good
 cause  existed  for  the failure to file the renewal application by that
 date, the owner may, no later than the last  day  for  paying  taxes  or
 PILOT without incurring interest or penalty, submit a written request to
 the assessor asking [him or her] THE ASSESSOR to extend the filing dead-
 line  and grant the exemption. Such request shall contain an explanation
 of why the deadline was missed, and shall be accompanied  by  a  renewal
 application,  reflecting  the facts and circumstances as they existed on
 the taxable status date. The assessor may extend the filing deadline and
 grant the exemption if [he or she] THE ASSESSOR is  satisfied  that  (i)
 good  cause  existed  for the failure to file the renewal application by
 the taxable status date, and that (ii) the applicant is otherwise  enti-
 tled  to the exemption. The assessor shall MAKE A DETERMINATION AND mail
 notice [of his or her determination] THEREOF to the owner. If the deter-
 mination states that the assessor has granted the exemption, [he or she]
 THE ASSESSOR shall thereupon be authorized and directed to  correct  the
 assessment  roll  accordingly,  or,  if  another  person  has custody or
 control of the assessment roll, to direct that person to make the appro-
 priate corrections. If the correction  is  not  made  before  taxes  are
 levied,  the  failure to take the exemption into account in the computa-
 tion of the tax shall be deemed a "clerical error" for purposes of title
 three of article five of this chapter, and shall be corrected according-
 ly.
  § 7. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  apply  to  all
 applications for exemptions pursuant to section 467 of the real property
 tax  law  on  assessment  rolls  that  are based on taxable status dates
 occurring on and after October 1, 2023.

 ans for their own use and consumption on their nations' or tribes' qual-
 ified reservation, or sold to the United States  or  sold  to  or  by  a
 voluntary  unincorporated organization of the armed forces of the United
 States operating a place for the sale of goods pursuant  to  regulations
 promulgated by the appropriate executive agency of the United States, to
 the extent provided in such regulations and policy statements of such an
 agency  applicable  to  such  sales.  The tax imposed by this section is
 imposed on all cigarettes sold on an Indian reservation  to  non-members
 of  the  Indian  nation or tribe and to non-Indians and evidence of such
 tax shall be by means of an affixed cigarette tax stamp. Indian  nations
 or  tribes  may  elect to participate in the Indian tax exemption coupon
 system established in section four hundred seventy-one-e of this article
 which provides a mechanism for the collection of the tax imposed by this
 section on cigarette sales on qualified reservations to such non-members
 and non-Indians and for the delivery of quantities of  tax-exempt  ciga-
 rettes  to Indian nations or tribes for the personal use and consumption
 of qualified members of the Indian nation or tribe. If an Indian  nation
 or  tribe  does  not  elect  to  participate in the Indian tax exemption

 contains more than twenty cigarettes, the rate of tax on the  cigarettes
 in  such  package  in  excess  of twenty shall be one dollar and [eight]
 THIRTY-THREE and three-quarters cents for each five cigarettes or  frac-
 tion  thereof.  Such tax is intended to be imposed upon only one sale of
 the same package of cigarettes. It shall be presumed that all cigarettes
 within the state are subject to tax until the contrary  is  established,

 shall be upon the person in possession thereof.

 rettes  which are exempt from the tax imposed by said section, or (3) on

 or  in the possession of, any person. Such tax on cigarettes shall be at
 the rate of [four] FIVE dollars and thirty-five cents  for  each  twenty
 cigarettes  or fraction thereof, provided, however, that if a package of
 cigarettes contains more than twenty cigarettes, the rate of tax on  the
 cigarettes  in  such package in excess of twenty shall be one dollar and

 or  fraction  thereof.  Within twenty-four hours after liability for the
 tax accrues, each such person shall file with the commissioner a  return
 in  such  form  as the commissioner may prescribe together with a remit-
 tance of the tax shown to be due thereon. For purposes of this  article,

 constructive and shall include but is not limited to the receipt,  stor-
 age  or  any  keeping or retention for any length of time, but shall not
 include possession for sale. All other provisions of this article if not
 inconsistent shall apply to the administration and  enforcement  of  the
 tax  imposed  by  this  section in the same manner as if the language of
 said provisions had been incorporated in full into this section.
  § 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary,  the
 tax  due  on  cigarettes  possessed in New York state as of the close of
 business on August 31, 2023, by any person for sale solely  attributable
 to the increase imposed by the amendments to section 471 of the tax law,
 as  amended  by  section  one of this act, shall be paid by November 20,
 2023, subject to such terms and conditions as the commissioner of  taxa-
 tion and finance shall prescribe.

  Section  1.  Legislative findings. The legislature finds that it is in
 the interests of the state to assist The New  York  Racing  Association,
 Inc.,  which  is  the  franchised  corporation  pursuant  to section two
 hundred six of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering  and  breeding  law,  to
 renovate  Belmont  Park  racetrack  and repurpose the Aqueduct property.
 The legislature further finds and determines that the  anticipated  cost
 of  renovating Belmont Park racetrack is four hundred fifty-five million
 dollars and that the renovation of Belmont Park racetrack shall initial-
 ly be financed by the state subject to the provisions of  the  repayment
 agreement  of the franchised corporation required by section two of this
 act. The franchised corporation will be responsible for repayment of the
 state funds in accordance with the terms of such repayment agreement.
  § 2. Prior to, and as a condition to  the  state  initially  providing
 funds  for  the  renovation  of  Belmont  Park racetrack, the franchised
 corporation shall enter  into  a  repayment  agreement  with  the  state
 authorizing  and directing that a portion of the funds of the franchised
 corporation dedicated for capital expenditures of the franchised  corpo-
 ration  pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  subdivision f and paragraph 3 of
 subdivision f-1 of section 1612 of the tax law shall be  used  to  repay
 the  state  for  the  funds  provided by the state for the renovation of
 Belmont Park racetrack,  in  accordance  with  the  repayment  agreement
 between  the  state and the franchised corporation. Such agreement shall
 further provide that in the event the  franchised  corporation  receives
 future  statutory  payments  enacted for the specific purpose of holding
 the franchised corporation harmless for any loss of payments pursuant to
 paragraph 3 of subdivision f and  paragraph  3  of  subdivision  f-1  of
 section  1612 of the tax law, such statutory payments shall also be used
 to repay the state for the funds provided by the  state  for  the  reno-
 vation  of  Belmont  Park  racetrack. Such agreement may also be amended
 from time to time as agreed to by the state and  the  franchised  corpo-
 ration.  At any time prior to the repayment of the state funds for the
 renovation of Belmont Park racetrack, the state may issue state personal
 income tax revenue bonds or state sales tax revenue bonds. In the  event
 of  the issuance of such bonds, the repayment agreement shall be revised
 to reflect the obligation of the franchised corporation to  fully  repay
 the debt service costs associated with such bonds.
  §  3.  Prior  to, and as a condition of, the state initially providing
 funds for the renovation  of  Belmont  Park  racetrack,  the  franchised
 corporation  shall  also  enter  into an agreement with the state relin-
 quishing to the state its leasehold interest in real property located in
 S. 4009  58  A. 3009
 
 South Ozone Park, commonly known as Aqueduct Racetrack, upon substantial
 completion of the renovation of Belmont Park racetrack.
  §  4.  The  New  York State Gaming Commission shall ensure that to the
 extent that the law allows for a franchise agreement for  the  operation
 of  Belmont  Park  racetrack with a franchisee other than the franchised
 corporation, the term of any  such  franchise  agreement  awarded  after
 funding  provided  by the state for the renovation of Belmont Park race-
 track described by section one of this act  shall  include  a  provision
 obligating  such  franchisee  to  assume  the payments of the franchised
 corporation required by section two of this act.

 prevent a track from televising its races on an irregular basis primari-
 ly for promotional or marketing purposes as found by the commission. For
 purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of section one thousand thir-
 teen of this article shall  not  apply.  Any  agreement  authorizing  an
 in-home simulcasting experiment commencing prior to May fifteenth, nine-
 teen hundred ninety-five, may, and all its terms, be extended until June

 section is not in effect for the current taxable year, the  shareholders
 of  an  eligible  S  corporation  are  deemed to have made that election
 effective for the eligible S corporation's entire current taxable  year,

 ble year is more than fifty percent of its federal gross income for such
 year. In determining whether an eligible S corporation is deemed to have
 made that election, the income of a qualified  subchapter  S  subsidiary
 owned  directly  or  indirectly  by  the eligible S corporation shall be

 BECOMES A NEW YORK S CORPORATION SHALL BE HELD IN ABEYANCE AND BE AVAIL-
 ABLE TO SUCH TAXPAYER IF SUCH TAXPAYER IS TREATED AS A NEW YORK C CORPO-
 RATION BECAUSE ITS ELECTION TO BE A FEDERAL S CORPORATION IS  TERMINATED
 OR  BY OPERATION OF SUBSECTION (B) OF THIS SECTION. HOWEVER, THE TAXPAY-
 ER'S YEARS AS A NEW YORK S CORPORATION SHALL BE COUNTED FOR PURPOSES  OF
 COMPUTING ANY TIME PERIOD APPLICABLE TO THE ALLOWANCE OF ANY NET OPERAT-

 CORPORATION BECAUSE ITS ELECTION TO BE A FEDERAL S CORPORATION IS TERMI-
 NATED  OR  BY  OPERATION OF SUBSECTION (B) OF THIS SECTION. HOWEVER, THE
 TAXPAYER'S YEARS AS A NEW  YORK  S  CORPORATION  SHALL  BE  COUNTED  FOR
 PURPOSES OF COMPUTING ANY TIME PERIOD APPLICABLE TO THE ALLOWANCE OF ANY

 required to be made under this chapter in  the  current  tax  year,  the
 eligible  S  corporation and its shareholders may rely on the eligible S
 corporation's filing status for the prior year. If the eligible S corpo-
 ration's filing status changes from the prior tax year  the  corporation
 or  the  shareholders, as the case may be, which made the payments shall
 be entitled to a refund of such estimated tax payments.  No additions to
 tax with respect to any required declarations or payments  of  estimated
 S. 4009  77  A. 3009
 
 tax  imposed  under  this chapter shall be imposed on the corporation or
 shareholders, whichever is the taxpayer for the current taxable year, if
 the corporation or the shareholders file such declarations and make such
 estimated  tax  payments  by January fifteenth of the following calendar
 year, regardless of whether the taxpayer's tax year is a calendar  or  a
 fiscal year.

 CORPORATION SHALL BE AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH (K) OF SUBDIVISION NINE  OF

  §  16.  Transition  rules.  Any  prior  net  operating loss conversion
 subtraction that otherwise would have been  allowed  under  subparagraph
 (viii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section two hundred ten of
 the tax law for the taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2024,
 to  any  taxpayer  that  was a New York C corporation for a taxable year
 beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and before January 1,  2024,  and
 that becomes a New York S corporation for a taxable year beginning on or
 after  January  1, 2024, as a result of the amendments made by this act,

 taxpayer  is treated as a New York C corporation because its election to
 be a federal S corporation is terminated or by operation  of  subsection
 (b)  of  section six hundred sixty of the  tax law. However, the taxpay-
 er's years as a New York S corporation shall be counted for purposes  of
 computing  the  twenty-year  time  period specified in subclause four of

 section two hundred ten of the tax law applicable to  the  allowance  of
 the prior net operating loss conversion subtraction.

 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the legislature that this act would  have  been  enacted  even  if  such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect immediately provided, however, that
 the applicable effective date of Parts A through CC of this act shall be
