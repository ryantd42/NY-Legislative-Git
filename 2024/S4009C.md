 S. 4009--B  43

 a license so to do. Applications for licenses shall be in such  form  as
 may  be  prescribed by the commission and shall contain such information
 or other material or evidence as the commission may require. No  license
 shall be issued by the commission authorizing the simulcast transmission
 of  thoroughbred  races  from a track located in Suffolk county. The fee

 approve any application to conduct simulcasting into individual or group
 residences,  homes  or  other areas for the purposes of or in connection

 residences,  homes or other areas to be conducted jointly by one or more
 regional off-track betting corporations and one or more of  the  follow-
 ing:  a  franchised  corporation,  thoroughbred  racing corporation or a

 by  this  chapter  at  one  or more simulcast facilities for each of the
 contracting off-track betting corporations which  shall  include  wagers
 made  in  accordance  with  section  one  thousand fifteen, one thousand

 January  first,  two  thousand  five;  (ii)  that each off-track betting
 corporation having within its  geographic  boundaries  such  residences,
 homes  or  other  areas  technically  capable of receiving the simulcast
 signal shall be a contracting party; (iii) the distribution of  revenues
 shall  be  subject  to  contractual agreement of the parties except that
 statutory payments to  non-contracting  parties,  if  any,  may  not  be
 reduced;  provided,  however,  that nothing herein to the contrary shall
 prevent a track from televising its races on an irregular basis primari-
 ly for promotional or marketing purposes as found by the commission. For
 purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of section one thousand thir-
 teen of this article shall  not  apply.  Any  agreement  authorizing  an
 in-home simulcasting experiment commencing prior to May fifteenth, nine-
 teen hundred ninety-five, may, and all its terms, be extended until June

 an intent to terminate, may request the commission  to  mediate  between

 in-home simulcasting in the thoroughbred special betting district  shall

 commissions  determined  by  comparing  the  total commissions available
 after July twenty-first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  to  the  total
 commissions  that  would have been available to such track prior to July

 percent of the breaks. Payment to the New York state thoroughbred breed-
 ing and development fund by such franchised corporation  shall  be  one-
 half  of one percent of total daily on-track pari-mutuel pools resulting

 tures for:
  (i) the purchase of solar energy system equipment which  is  installed
 in  connection  with  residential  property which is (I) located in this
 state and (II) which is used by the taxpayer as  his  or  her  principal
 residence  at  the  time  the solar energy system equipment is placed in

 ment that spans at least ten years  where  such  equipment  owned  by  a
 person  other than the taxpayer is installed in connection with residen-
 tial property which is (I) located in this state and (II) which is  used

 als, labor costs properly allocable to on-site preparation, assembly and
 original  installation,  architectural  and  engineering  services,  and
 designs and plans directly related to the construction  or  installation

  (C)  Such  qualified  expenditures  for  the  purchase of solar energy
 system equipment shall not include interest or other finance charges.
  (D) Such qualified expenditures for the lease of solar  energy  system
 equipment  or  the  purchase  of  power  under an agreement described in

 ment  referenced  in  clauses  (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) of this
 paragraph, and shall not apply to  individual  payments  made  during  a
 taxable  year  under such agreement except to the extent such limitation

 condominium management association or who is a tenant-stockholder in the
 cooperative  housing  corporation may for the purpose of this subsection

 the  purposes  of the credit attributable to [his] THEIR principal resi-

 shall be read as a reference to this subsection.
