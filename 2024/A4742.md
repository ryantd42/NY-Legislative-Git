 AN ACT to amend the general municipal law, in relation  to  apportioning
  the  expenses  of  police department members attending police training
  schools
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  72-c of the general municipal law, as amended by
 section 1 of subpart C of part C of chapter 97 of the laws of  2011,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  §  72-c.  Expenses of members of the police department and other peace
 officers in attending police training schools. The board or  body  of  a
 county,  city,  town  or  village authorized to appropriate and to raise
 money by taxation and to make payments therefrom, is hereby  authorized,
 in  its discretion, to appropriate and to raise money by taxation and to
 make payments from such moneys, for the annual expenses of  the  members
 of  the  police  department of such municipal corporation in attending a
 police training school, as provided by the regulations  of  the  depart-
 ment,  either  within such municipal corporation or elsewhere within the
 state; and for the payment of reasonable expenses of  such  members  and
 other  police officers or peace officers of the municipality while going
 to, attending, and returning from any training school  conducted  by  or
 under the auspices of the federal bureau of investigation, whether with-
 in  or  without the state. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of
 any general, special or local law to the contrary, whenever a member  of
 the  police department of a municipal corporation HAVING A POPULATION OF
 TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS has attended a police training school,  the
 expense  of  which  was  borne by such municipal corporation, terminates
 employment with such municipal corporation and commences employment with
 any other municipal corporation or employer county sheriff, such employ-
 er municipal corporation or employer county sheriff shall reimburse  the

 prior employer municipal corporation for such expenses, including, sala-
 ry,  tuition,  enrollment fees, books, and the cost of transportation to
 and from training school, as follows: on a pro rata basis, to be  calcu-
 lated  by subtracting from the number of days in the three years follow-
 ing the date of the member's graduation from police training school, the
 number of days between the date of the member's graduation from training
 school and the date of the termination of employment with the  municipal
 corporation which paid for such training, and multiplying the difference
 by  the per diem cost of such expenses, to be calculated by dividing the
 total cost of such expenses by the number of days  in  the  three  years
 following the date of the member's graduation, if such change in employ-
 ment  occurs  within three years of such member's graduation from police
 training school. Provided, however, the employer  municipal  corporation
 or  employer county sheriff shall not be required to reimburse the prior
 employer municipal corporation for that portion of such  expenses  which
 is  reimbursable  by  the  member to the prior employer municipal corpo-
 ration under the terms of an employment or  labor  agreement.  Provided,
 further,  however, the employer municipal corporation or employer county
 sheriff shall not be required to reimburse the prior employer  municipal
 corporation  for such basic training if such change in employment occurs
 after the expiration of the validity of the member's certificate attest-
 ing to the satisfactory completion of an approved municipal police basic
 training program.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to persons
 who have successfully completed police training courses on or after such
 effective date.
