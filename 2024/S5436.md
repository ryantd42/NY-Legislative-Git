 If more than one phalange of a digit shall be lost, the period shall  be
 the same as for the loss of the entire digit. If only the first phalange
 shall  be  lost, the period shall be one-half the period for loss of the
 entire digit. The period for loss or loss of use of two or more  digits,
 or  one  or more phalanges of two or more digits, of a hand or foot, may
 be proportioned to the period for the loss of use of the  hand  or  foot
 occasioned  thereby,  but  shall not exceed the period for the loss of a
 hand or foot. If an arm or leg shall be amputated at or above the  wrist
 or  ankle, the period for such loss shall be in proportion to the period
 for the loss of the arm or leg. In the case of loss of binocular  vision
 or  of  eighty  per  centum  or more of the vision of an eye, the period
 shall be the same as for the loss of the eye.
  b. Loss of hearing. In the case of the complete loss of the hearing of
 one ear, sixty weeks; for the loss of hearing of both ears, one  hundred
 fifty weeks.
  c.  Total loss of use. In the case of permanent total loss of use of a
 member, the compensation shall be the  same  as  for  the  loss  of  the
 member.
  d.  Partial  loss  or partial loss of use. Except as above provided in
 this subdivision, in the case of permanent partial loss or loss  of  use
 of  a  member, the period shall be for the proportionate loss or loss of
 use of the member. Compensation for permanent partial loss of use of  an
 eye  shall  be  awarded  on  the  basis of uncorrected loss of vision or
 corrected loss of vision resulting from an injury which ever is greater.
  e. Disfigurement. In the case of serious facial or head disfigurement,
 including a disfigurement continuous in length which is  partly  in  the
 facial  area  and also extends into the neck region as described in this
 paragraph, the volunteer ambulance worker shall be paid in a lump sum  a
 proper  and  equitable amount, which shall be determined by the workers'
 compensation board. If the earning capacity of the  volunteer  ambulance
 S. 5436  10
 
 worker  shall  have  been impaired, or may in the future be impaired, by
 any serious disfigurement in the  region  above  the  sterno  clavicular
 articulations  anterior to and including the region of the sterno cleido
 mastoid  muscles on either side, the volunteer ambulance worker shall be
 paid in a lump sum a proper and equitable amount which shall  be  deter-
 mined  by such board. Two or more serious disfigurements, not continuous
 in length, resulting from the same injury, if partially  in  the  facial
 area  and  partially in such neck region, shall be deemed to be a facial
 disfigurement. An award, or the aggregate of the awards, to a  volunteer
 ambulance  worker  under  this paragraph shall not exceed [twenty] FORTY
 thousand dollars.
  f. Total or partial loss or loss of use of more than  one  member.  In
 any  case in which there shall be a loss or loss of use of more than one
 member or parts of more than one member set forth above in paragraphs  a
