International,  one  of  the largest service organizations in the world,
and is deeply committed to meeting the challenges of public service; and
 
  WHEREAS, The goal of the Larchmont Mamaroneck  Lions  Club  and  the
entire  Lions  organization  is  to  empower  volunteers  to serve their
communities,  meet  humanitarian  needs,  encourage  peace  and  promote
international understanding; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  Lions  are  recognized  worldwide  for their

Convention; and
 
  WHEREAS, Staying true to the  Lion's  motto  "We  Serve",  Larchmont
Mamaroneck Lions Club supports existing non-profit and community service

needs, solutions and resources; the Lions signature cause is vision  and
blindness,  along  with  hunger,  the  environment,  diabetes, childhood
cancer and the future of our youth; and
 
  WHEREAS, Larchmont Mamaroneck Lions  Club  is  a  signatory  of  the
United  Nations  resolutions on women's and refugee rights; in addition,
affordable housing is a local Lions priority; and

to  the  world, Larchmont Mamaroneck Lions Club continues to demonstrate
its profound commitment through providing connections and  resources  to
community  members,  such  as  vision  screenings, Peace Poster Contest,
eyeglass recycling, town cleanups, scholarships, food  pantry,  hands-on
help  and  funds  for  local  needs,  while  also  contributing to wider
humanitarian goals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its  distinguished  100-year  history,  the  Larchmont
Mamaroneck  Lions  Club  has  demonstrated  continuous  service  to  the
residents and communities which it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Larchmont Mamaroneck Lions  Club  is  in
direct  correlation to the efforts of its members, whose involvement is,
and always has been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and

individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary  of  the  Larchmont  Mamaroneck  Lions
Club,  and to commend its members, past and present, who have labored so
conscientiously to secure  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  in  the
community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Larchmont Mamaroneck Lions Club.
