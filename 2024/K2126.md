  COMMEMORATING  the 215th Anniversary of Ecuadorian
  Independence Day on August 10, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions,  to  recognize and pay tribute to all who
foster ethnic pride and enhance the profile of cultural diversity  which
thereby strengthens the fabric of the communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  215th  Anniversary  of  Ecuadorian Independence Day on
Thursday, August 10, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ecuadorian Independence  Day  celebrates  the  independence
from  nearly  three hundred years of Spanish rule on August 10, 1809; on
this day Rebels in Quito declared "El Primer  Grito  de  Independencia,"
the First Cry of Independence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  Ecuador  had  not gotten their full independence
from Spain this day, it marked the first step and gave courage to  other
towns and villages to fight for their independence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ecuador  was the first country in South America to declare
their independence from Spanish rule, and reflects the  start  of  other
countries  in  South  America beginning their fight toward independence;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Ecuadorian Independence Day is celebrated each year  during
the  weekend  following  August  10;  Ecuadorians  show  their  pride by
celebrating  with  the  parades,  concerts,  and  festivals  across  the
country,  with a heavy concentration of festivities around the "Plaza de
Independencia," or Independence Plaza, in the capital of Quito; and
 
  WHEREAS, Another location of celebration includes  the  "Palacio  de
Gobierno,"  Government Palace, where bands play Pasillo music as dancers
perform in traditional costumes; a parade for  the  military  forces  is
held  and  followed by an additional parade with bands, dance groups and
pageant Queens and Princesses of  Quito;  after  the  parade,  concerts,
cultural  performances  and  exhibits,  games,  food  vendors,  poultry,
artisan and agricultural fairs are also part of the festivities; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the smaller towns and provinces of Ecuador,  festivities
also  take  place  by celebrating with their traditional music, parades,
dancing, festivals, and by sharing communal meals with one another; and
 
  WHEREAS, On August 10, 2021, Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of  State,
recognized  Ecuador's  National  Day  on behalf of the Government of the
Unites States and the American people as Ecuador  had  celebrated  their
212th Anniversary of Independence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to acknowledge various
cultures of people who add to the overall diversity of our  State,  and,
on this occasion, we take the opportunity to recognize the contributions
 
made  by the Ecuadorian American community and extend best wishes to all
of its members as they hold appropriate ceremonies to  commemorate  this
historic milestone; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 215th Anniversary  of  Ecuadorian  Independence  Day  on
August 10, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Foreign Minister of Ecuador, Gustavo Manrique M., and
various Ecuadorian organizations in New York.
