  COMMEMORATING the 100th Anniversary of the Knights

  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute to those fraternal organizations of high purpose and worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of  the  Knights  of  Columbus  Corpus
Christi  Council  No.  2502  of  Mineola,  New York, to be celebrated on
Saturday, November 11, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 1882, the Knights of Columbus is a  Catholic
men's  fraternal  benefit  society  with  more  than 1.9 million members
located in over 15,900 Councils throughout the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The original chapel of Corpus Christi Church was  built  in
1895, and the first church dedication was held in 1906; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  November  of  1921,  Corpus Christi Pastor James Burke
purchased the old Graves Estate on Searing  Avenue  where  he  opened  a
school on September 11, 1922, which remains today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Father Edward A. McGowan was sent to assist Father Burke in
1923,  and  under  Father  McGowan's  direction,  Corpus Christi Council
received its official Charter and Council No. 2502 on November 11, 1923;
during this time, there were 101 Charter members, led  by  Grand  Knight
John Shade; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Corpus Christi Council held its first meetings in the
American Legion building  in  Mineola,  and  in  the  late  1920s,  they
purchased  a  building  located  at  the  northwest corner of Willis and
Jefferson; in 1940, the Council left this site and thereafter  held  its
meetings in a store on Jericho Turnpike just east of Marcellus Road; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After relocating to 146 Lincoln Avenue in 1945, the Corpus
Christi Council moved to its present location in  the  late  1960s  when
they purchased a building which was previously an A&P supermarket; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1945, the Council sponsored a lecture delivered by then
Monsignor FJ Sheen at Chaminade High School's Athletic Field; more  than
2,000  people  attended;  the Monsignor's popularity raised to worldwide
acclaim when he hosted a television program in the 1950s  and  was  then
known as Bishop Fulton J. Sheen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  the late 1970s, under the able direction of Past Grand
Knight Jerry Hughes, excavation began on the half of the  building  that
rested  on  the ground; with the assistance of brother John Donahue, who
placed all of the bricks, and many other brothers, the Father Tully room
was dedicated in 1985; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, The Corpus Christi Council saw fit to transfer ownership of
the  building  to  a  management  company  and  remains  as a tenant for
meetings and events through present day; furthermore, with the  help  of
David  P.  Redmond, the Council went online with its website in July of
2005; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  its  distinguished  history,  the  Knights  of
Columbus  Corpus  Christi  Council  have supported four ideals: Charity,
Unity, Fraternity and Patriotism; its  members  have  exemplified  these
principles through their support of countless worthy causes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  so  effectively  carrying  out its mission, the Corpus
Christi Knights of Columbus have demonstrated  the  value  of  fostering
camaraderie  in  a  shared  vision of community service; this mission is
indicative of a noble organization which epitomizes the heart  and  soul
of what it means to be an American; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Organizations  of singular distinction such as the Knights
of Columbus Corpus Christi Council provide a  model  for  enhancing  the
quality of life in the community and, as such, merit the grateful praise
of the community of the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of  the  Knights  of  Columbus  Corpus
Christi Council No. 2502 of Mineola, New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Knights of Columbus Corpus Christi Council  No.  2502
of Mineola, New York.
