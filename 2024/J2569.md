  COMMENDING  the  Charlton  Historical Society upon
  the occasion of hosting its Annual Charlton Founders
  Day Weekend and Parade on June 2, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions,  to  recognize  and  pay tribute to those
organizations that embrace the historical significance and contributions
of their localities which strengthen the fabric of  the  communities  of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to commend the
Charlton Historical Society upon the  occasion  of  hosting  its  Annual
Charlton Founders Day Weekend and Parade on Sunday, June 2, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year  marks  the  54th  Anniversary  of the Charlton
Founders Day Weekend and Parade; the centerpiece of the weekend  is  the
extraordinary,  colorful  Parade  which  serves  as  the  staple  of the
weekend's various celebrations in  addition  to  enjoying  the  exciting
activities;  food  vendors  offer  their  specialty treats, tempting the
palettes of visitors from the surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Charlton Historical Society is a community organization
dedicated to promoting, developing, and paying homage  to  the  Town  of
Charlton,  New York, always adding new members and providing a mock tour
on their website along with  a  guide  to  historic  markers  and  other
resources to educate the public about Charlton's rich history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1792,  the year after Saratoga County was founded, the
New York State Legislature divided "Balls Town" into four parts, forming
three new towns, Galway, Milton, and, in the  southwest  corner  of  the
county,  Charlton,  which  was  previously  called "New Freehold" by its
settlers who were mostly immigrants from Freehold, New Jersey; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  reason  the  name  Charlton  was  chosen,  or  its
origination,  is  unknown;  however,  speculation  suggests the name was
possibly inspired by John Charlton, a squatter  already  living  in  the
area  when  early  settlers  arrived; today, Charlton is a vibrant rural
community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within the town lines of Charlton, one can find the hamlets
of Blue Corners, Charlton Harmony Corners, Holbrook Corners, Komar Park,
Tucker Heights, and West Charlton; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Town of Charlton was home to John W. Taylor, who served
in the United States House of Representatives for 20 years, from 1813 to
1833, and was elected as Speaker of the House in 1820 and 1825; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the years,  the  Charlton  Founders  Day  Weekend  and
Parade  has  grown  tremendously,  with  attendees  enjoying  multiple
festivities, including a 5K race, a spectacular display of fireworks,  a
two-day local farmers market, and an artisans fair; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Staying  true  to  tradition,  and  to  honor  the Town of
Charlton's local businesses, the  theme  of  this  year's  Founders  Day
Weekend  is an homage to West Charlton, celebrating the rich history and
the historic buildings and storefronts in the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This year, David and Connie Wood have been selected as the
2024 Charlton Founders Day Parade co-Grand  Marshals  for  their  active
roles in Charlton's agricultural community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend cultural events which  symbolize  the  historical,  social,  and
cultural  development  of  this great State and embody the spirit of the
principles upon which this Nation was founded; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend the Charlton Historical Society upon the occasion of hosting its
Annual  Charlton Founders Day Weekend and Parade on June 2, 2024; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  Town of Charlton, the Charlton Historical Society,
and Grand Marshals, David and Connie Wood.
