  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  is  one  of the fastest growing cancer
diagnoses in the United States, increasing more than 400% in the past 20
years; the cancer kills 1 American every 36 minutes each and every  day;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer is among the deadliest of cancers, with
about 1 in 5 patients surviving 5 years,  and  has  low  survival  rates
because  it  is  usually  discovered  at  advanced stages when treatment
outcomes are poor; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer is 3 to 4 times  more  common  among  men
than  among  women,  and  the  lifetime risk of esophageal cancer in the
United States is about 1 in 127 in men and about 1 in 434 in women; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2024, the American Cancer Society estimates  17,690  men
and  4,680 women will be diagnosed with esophageal cancer and 12,880 men
and 3,250 women will die from the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  makes  up  about  1%  of  all  cancers
diagnosed  in  the  United  States,  yet  it is the cause of 2.6% of the
cancer deaths in the U.S.; it is much more common in some other parts of
the world, such as Iran, northern China, India, and southern Africa; and
 
  WHEREAS, Although many people with esophageal cancer will go  on  to
die  from  this  disease,  treatment has improved and survival rates are
getting better; during the 1960s and 1970s, only about  5%  of  patients
survived  at  least  5  years after being diagnosed; today, about 22% of
patients survive at least 5 years after diagnosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer in the United States is most often caused
by persistent heartburn or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease  (GERD),  yet
many  who  are  at  risk  are  unaware  of the potential danger GERD can
present when it occurs over several weeks or months; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer can be  a  silent  killer  with  patients
often  unaware  that  the cough, hoarse voice, sore throat or chest pain
they suffer can be signs of GERD and are reasons  to  discuss  screening
for esophageal cancer with their health care professional; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  can develop from GERD when fluids from
the stomach splash  up  to  create  cellular  change  in  the  esophagus
resulting in a precancerous condition known as Barrett's Esophagus which
can  lead  to  a  125-fold  increase  in  a patient's risk of developing
esophageal cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer can be prevented through early  detection
of  its  precursor,  Barrett's Esophagus, which can be treated with new,
curative outpatient techniques; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal Cancer  Action  Network  (ECAN)  is  working  to
improve  public  awareness  of the link between heartburn and cancer and
supports progress in early detection and treatment of esophageal cancer;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  awareness,  along with improvements in
prevention, early detection and treatment strategies, will  enhance  the
health and well-being of all Americans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as  Esophageal
Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
