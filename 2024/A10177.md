 Introduced  by COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Carroll) --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Election Law
 
 AN ACT to amend the election law, in relation to changing  the  date  of
  designation for election inspectors and poll clerks
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 3-404  of  the  election  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  263  of  the  laws  of 1991, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. The board of elections of  each  county  shall  on  or  before  the
 [fifteenth  day  of  July]  FIRST DAY OF JANUARY of each year select and
 appoint election inspectors and poll clerks for each  election  district
 therein, and such number of election coordinators as it determines to be
 necessary,  and may thereafter select and designate election inspectors,
 poll clerks and election coordinators to fill any vacancy for  an  unex-
 pired  term.  The term of such designation shall be for a term ending on
 the [fourteenth day of July of the following year] THIRTY-FIRST  DAY  OF
 DECEMBER  OF  THE  SAME YEAR. If the election districts for a general or
 special village election conducted by the board of elections are  coter-
 minous  with  the  election districts established for general elections,
 such election inspectors and  poll  clerks  shall  also  serve  at  such
 village elections. If the election districts for such a village election
 are  not so coterminous, the board of elections shall select the inspec-
 tors and poll clerks to serve in each  such  village  election  district
 from  among  the  inspectors  and poll clerks appointed, pursuant to the
 provisions of this section, for any election district wholly  or  partly
 in such village.
  §  2. Subdivision 2 of section 3-404 of the election law is amended to
 read as follows:
  2. Each political party entitled to representation  on  any  board  of
 elections  may,  not  later than the [first day of May] FIFTEENTH DAY OF
 NOVEMBER in each year, file with the appropriate board of elections,  an
 original  list  of persons recommended to serve.  Supplemental lists may
 be filed at the same time and at any time before the designation is made

 and certified or when a vacancy exists. All designations shall  be  made
 first  from  those  named in the original list filed if those designated
 are found qualified.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
