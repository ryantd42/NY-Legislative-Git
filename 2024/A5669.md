  § 2. Section 2-202 of the village law, subparagraph 2 of  paragraph  f
 of  subdivision  1  as  amended  by  chapter 181 of the laws of 2004, is
 amended to read as follows:
  §  2-202  Petition for incorporation. 1. A proceeding for the incorpo-
 ration of such territory as a village shall commence  with  a  petition.
 The requirements for such petition are as follows:
  a.  Petitioners.  [Either  one  or both of the following two groups of
 persons may petition for such incorporation:
  (1)] At least twenty [per cent]  PERCENT  of  the  residents  of  such
 territory  qualified to vote for town officers in a town in which all or
 part of such territory is located SHALL SIGN SUCH PETITION.
  [(2) The owners of more than fifty percent in  assessed  valuation  of
 the  real  property  in  such territory assessed upon the last completed
 assessment roll of the town in which such territory is located. However,
 if such territory is located in more than one town it shall be  required
 in  computing  such  percentage  to equalize the assessed valuations for
 each town; furthermore, in such case, the petition must be signed by the
 owners of more than fifty percent in full valuation of the real property
 in each part of each town in such territory and computed separately  for
 each such part, and assessed upon the last completed assessment rolls of
 the towns in which any part of such territory is located. Full valuation
 shall  be  determined  by  applying the appropriate equalization rate to
 such assessed valuations. If real property in such territory is owned by
 tenants in common, joint tenants or tenants by the entirety,  each  such
 tenant,  as  a  signer of such petition shall, for the purpose of ascer-
 taining the percentage of the assessed valuation upon which the petition
 is based, be considered as the owner of an interest in such real proper-
 ty equal to the result reached by dividing the assessed valuation by the
 number of owners thereof and shall be credited to that extent with  part
 of the total assessed valuation thereof. In the event such real property
 is  part  of  a parcel of land partially situated within such territory,
 the town assessor or assessors shall, for the purposes of  this  section
 make  an  apportionment of the assessed value of such part as is in such
 territory. In such a case, only the apportioned value attributed to such
 part shall be considered.]
  b. Contents of petition. The  petition  shall  contain  the  following
 information:
  (1)  An allegation [of the basis on which the petition is signed] THAT
 AT LEAST TWENTY PERCENT OF THE RESIDENTS  QUALIFIED  TO  VOTE  FOR  TOWN

 article are satisfied.
  (5) A designation of at least one but  no  more  than  three  persons,
 giving  full  names  and  addresses,  on whom and at which addresses all
 papers required to be served  in  connection  with  the  proceeding  for
 incorporation, shall be served. A majority of such designees must reside
 in such territory.
  (6)  Each  page  of  the  petition and all exhibits and certifications
 shall be securely fastened together.
  c. Exhibits and certifications. Each copy of the petition  shall  have
 attached thereto prior to the signature pages:

 ON THE TERRITORY TO BE INCORPORATED AND THE REMAINING AREA OF  THE  TOWN
 OR TOWNS.

 fifty per cent in assessed or full valuation, as the case may be, of the
 real property in such territory, there shall be attached to the petition
 following  the  signatures of the petitioners an affidavit or affidavits
 certifying as follows:
  (1) If such territory is located entirely in one town, a certification
 by an assessor thereof certifying to the  total  assessed  valuation  of
 such territory and the correct total amount thereof owned by the signers
 of the petition, or
