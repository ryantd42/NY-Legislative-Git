Assembly Resolution No. 217
 
BY: M. of A. Barclay
 
  amending section 7 of Rule III of the Assembly
  Rules, in relation to the reading of bills
 
  RESOLVED, That section 7 of  Rule  III  of  the  Assembly  Rules  is
amended to read as follows:
 
  §  7.  Reading  of  bills.  a. Every bill shall receive three separate
readings, and on three different days, previous to its  passage,  except
when ordered to a third reading pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision
f  of  section  two  of  this  Rule, by unanimous consent or when made a
special order, or when accompanied by a message of necessity pursuant to
section [14] fourteen of Article III of the Constitution. No message  of
necessity shall be accepted from the Governor unless at least two-thirds
of the members of the House have approved the message.
 
  b.  Bills  placed  on  the order of second reading, as provided for in
subdivision g of section six of Rule IV,  shall  be  subject  to  debate
before  the  motion  to  order  them  to a third reading is entertained.
One-half hour shall be allowed for such  debate,  but  no  person  shall
speak  more  than  fifteen  minutes, except by consent of the House. The
main question, however, if ordered, shall be on the advancement  of  the
bill;  but when amendments are pending the question shall first be taken
upon such amendments in their inverse order.
 
  c.  All bills on the order of second reading shall be ordered to third
reading unless otherwise ordered  pursuant  to  subdivision  b  of  this
section  or pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision b of section ten of
Rule IV.
 
  d.  A
 
  bill shall be considered automatically advanced to third reading  once
it  has  been on the printed Calendar on the order of second reading for
at least one legislative day on that order, except where made a  special
order  by  report  of  the  Committee  on Rules, in which case it may be
considered on second and third reading on the same day.
 
  e. In all cases where unanimous consent is asked for advancing a  bill
or entertaining a motion or resolution out of its order, it shall be the
duty  of  the  Speaker  to  proclaim  such request and determine if such
consent will be granted.
 
  f. A bill appearing on the Calendar may be  "starred"  by  or  at  the
request  of  the  introducer,  whereupon all further action on such bill
shall be suspended, although it retains its place on the Calendar. Other
than for the purpose of amendment or recommittal,  a  star  may  not  be
removed from a bill until one day after the request therefor.  A bill on
any  order  of  third  reading  which  has  been laid aside by or at the
request of the introducer on three separate days shall be  automatically
starred.
 
  g.  Substitution  of Bills. Where there is a Senate bill in a standing
committee and the identical Assembly bill is on the order of  second  or
 
any  order  of third reading, the Senate bill may be substituted for the
Assembly bill upon a motion by, or on behalf of, the  introducer  and  a
vote  of  a  majority  of the members present and voting.  The motion to
substitute may also be made on an identical Assembly bill which has been
passed, recalled, vote reconsidered and restored to third reading.
