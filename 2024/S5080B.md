 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 enumerated articles, sections and subdivisions of sections of this chap-
 ter shall not apply to the construction or alteration of multiple dwell-

 population of one million or more [which adopts  or  has  adopted  local
 laws,  ordinances,  resolutions or regulations providing protection from
 fire  hazards  and  making  provision  for  escape  from  fire  in  the
 construction  and alteration of multiple dwellings and in other respects
 as protective as local law seventy-six of the laws of the  city  of  New
 York  for  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight  and covering the same subject
 matter as the following]: subdivisions twenty-five, twenty-seven,  twen-
 ty-eight,  thirty-five-c,  thirty-six  and  thirty-nine of section four,
 subdivision three of section twenty-eight, sections thirty-six,  thirty-
 seven,  fifty,  fifty-one,  fifty-two,  fifty-three,  fifty-five, sixty,
 sixty-one, sixty-seven, subdivisions one, two, four and five of  section
 seventy-five,  article four, article five, article five-A[,] AND article

 hundred  sixty-nine  where a multiple dwelling erected prior to December
 sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine is altered,  or  a  building  erected
 prior  to  December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine is converted to a
 multiple dwelling pursuant to a permit applied  for  to  the  department
 having  jurisdiction,  the foregoing articles, sections and subdivisions
 of sections shall remain applicable where  a  local  law  of  such  city
 authorizes  such  alteration  or conversion to be made, at the option of
 the owner, either in accordance with the requirements  of  the  building
 law  and  regulations  in  effect  in such city prior to December sixth,
 nineteen hundred sixty-eight or the requirements of the building law and
 regulations in effect after such date, and the owner  elects  to  comply
 with  the  requirements  of  the  building law and regulations in effect
 prior to December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-eight.
  § 2. Section 275 of the multiple dwelling law, as added by chapter 734
 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  § 275. Legislative findings. It is hereby declared and found  that  in
 cities  with  a  population  in  excess of one million, large numbers of
 loft, manufacturing, commercial,  institutional,  public  and  community
 facility  buildings  have  lost,  and continue to lose, their tenants to
 more modern premises; and that the untenanted portions of such buildings
 constitute a potential housing stock within such cities which  is  capa-
 ble,  when  appropriately  altered, of accommodating general residential
 use, thereby contributing to an alleviation of the housing shortage most
 severely affecting moderate and middle income families, and of  accommo-
 dating  joint  living-work quarters for artists by making readily avail-
 able space which is physically and  economically  suitable  for  use  by
 persons regularly engaged in the arts.
  There is a public purpose to be served by making accommodations readi-
 ly  available for joint living-work quarters for artists for the follow-
 ing reasons:  persons regularly engaged  in  the  arts  require  larger
 amounts of space for the pursuit of their artistic endeavors and for the
 storage  of  the materials therefor and of the products thereof than are
 regularly to be found in dwellings subject to  this  article;  that  the
 financial  remunerations  to be obtained from pursuit of a career in the
 arts are generally small; that as a result  of  such  limited  financial
 remuneration  persons  regularly  engaged  in the arts generally find it
 financially impossible to maintain quarters for  the  pursuit  of  their
 artistic  endeavors  separate  and apart from their places of residence;
 S. 5080  3
 
 that the cultural life of cities of more than one million persons within
 this state and of the state as a whole is enhanced by the  residence  in
 such  cities  of large numbers of persons regularly engaged in the arts;
 that  the  high  cost  of  land within such cities makes it particularly
 difficult for persons regularly engaged in the arts to obtain the use of
 the amounts of space required for their work as aforesaid; and that  the
 residential  use  of  the space is secondary or accessory to the primary
 use as a place of work.
  It is further declared that the legislation governing  the  alteration
 of  such buildings to accommodate general residential use must of neces-
 sity be more restrictive  than  statutes  heretofore  in  effect,  which
 affected only joint living-work quarters for artists.
  It  is the intention of this legislation to promulgate statewide mini-
 mum standards for all alterations of non-residential buildings to  resi-
 dential  use,  but  the  legislature  is  cognizant that the use of such
 buildings for residential purposes must be consistent with local  zoning
 ordinances.  The  legislature  further recognizes that it is the role of
 localities to adopt regulations which will define in further detail  the
 manner  in  which alterations should be carried out where building types
 and conditions are peculiar to their local  environment.  IT  IS  HEREBY
 ADDITIONALLY  DECLARED  AND  FOUND  THAT  IN CITIES WITH A POPULATION IN
 EXCESS OF ONE MILLION, LARGE NUMBERS OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS HAVE  LOST,
 AND  CONTINUE  TO LOSE, THEIR TENANTS TO MORE MODERN PREMISES AND TO THE
 CHANGING NATURE OF REMOTE OFFICE  WORK  IN  THE  WAKE  OF  THE  COVID-19
 PANDEMIC;  AND THAT THE UNTENANTED PORTIONS OF SUCH BUILDINGS CONSTITUTE
 A POTENTIAL HOUSING STOCK WITHIN SUCH  CITIES  WHICH  IS  CAPABLE,  WHEN
 APPROPRIATELY ALTERED, OF ACCOMMODATING GENERAL RESIDENTIAL USE, THEREBY
 CONTRIBUTING TO AN ALLEVIATION OF THE HOUSING SHORTAGE.
  §  3.  Section 276 of the multiple dwelling law, as amended by chapter
 420 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  § 276. [Definition of an artist] DEFINITIONS. As used in this article,

 tive arts, including choreography and filmmaking, or in the  composition
 of  music  on  a  professional  basis,  and  is so certified by the city
 department of cultural affairs and/or state council  on  the  arts.  For
 joint  living-work quarters for artists limited to artists' occupancy by
 local zoning resolution, any permanent occupant whose residence  therein
 began  on or before December fifteenth, two thousand twenty-one shall be
 deemed to meet such occupancy requirements under the same rights  as  an
 artist so certified in accordance with applicable law.
  2.  THE TERM "GENERAL RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES" MEANS USE OF A BUILDING AS

 THIS  SECTION SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION TWEN-
 TY-SIX OF THIS CHAPTER.
  3. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY  STATE  OR  LOCAL  LAW,  RULE,  OR  REGULATION,

 OF SECTION 15-01 OF THE ZONING RESOLUTION OF A CITY WITH A POPULATION OF
 ONE MILLION OR MORE PERSONS.
  § 5. An application for conversion  of  a  building  pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of  this  act,  which  application  for  a permit containing
 complete plans and specifications is filed prior to December  31,  2030,
 shall  be permitted to proceed as if subdivision 3 of section 279 of the
 multiple dwelling law, as added by section four of this act, remained in
 effect, so long as construction of such project begins within the earli-
 er to occur of three years from December 31, 2030 or such time which the

  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 subdivision  3  of  section 279 of the multiple dwelling law as added by
 section four of this act shall expire and be deemed repealed on December
 31, 2030; provided further, however, that the repeal of subdivision 3 of
 section 279 of the multiple dwelling law as added  by  section  four  of
 this  act  shall not affect the use of any building for general residen-
 tial purposes, as such term is defined in article 7-B  of  the  multiple
 dwelling law, permitted prior to such repeal.
