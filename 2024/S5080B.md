  PART A
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 11 of section 3 of the multiple dwelling law,
 as amended by chapter 806 of the laws of 1972, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  11. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following
 enumerated articles, sections and subdivisions of sections of this chap-
 ter shall not apply to the construction or alteration of multiple dwell-
 ings  for  which  an  application for a permit is made to the department
 after December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine in  a  city  having  a
 population  of  one  million  or more [which adopts or has adopted local
 laws, ordinances, resolutions or regulations providing  protection  from
 fire  hazards  and  making  provision  for  escape  from  fire  in  the
 construction and alteration of multiple dwellings and in other  respects
 as  protective  as  local law seventy-six of the laws of the city of New
 York for nineteen hundred sixty-eight  and  covering  the  same  subject
 matter  as the following]: subdivisions twenty-five, twenty-seven, twen-
 ty-eight, thirty-five-c, thirty-six and  thirty-nine  of  section  four,
 subdivision  three of section twenty-eight, sections thirty-six, thirty-
 seven, fifty,  fifty-one,  fifty-two,  fifty-three,  fifty-five,  sixty,
 sixty-one,  sixty-seven, subdivisions one, two, four and five of section
 seventy-five, article four, article five, article five-A[,] AND  article
 six  [and  article  seven-B]; except that after December sixth, nineteen
 hundred sixty-nine where a multiple dwelling erected prior  to  December
 sixth,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-nine  is altered, or a building erected
 prior to December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-nine is converted  to  a
 multiple  dwelling  pursuant  to  a permit applied for to the department
 having jurisdiction, the foregoing articles, sections  and  subdivisions
 of  sections  shall  remain  applicable  where  a local law of such city
 authorizes such alteration or conversion to be made, at  the  option  of
 the  owner,  either  in accordance with the requirements of the building
 law and regulations in effect in such  city  prior  to  December  sixth,
 nineteen hundred sixty-eight or the requirements of the building law and
 regulations  in  effect  after such date, and the owner elects to comply
 with the requirements of the building  law  and  regulations  in  effect
 prior to December sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-eight.
  § 2. Section 275 of the multiple dwelling law, as added by chapter 734
 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  §  275.  Legislative findings. 1. It is hereby declared and found that
 in cities with a population in excess of one million, large  numbers  of
 loft,  manufacturing,  commercial,  institutional,  public and community
 facility buildings have lost, and continue to  lose,  their  tenants  to
 more modern premises; and that the untenanted portions of such buildings
 constitute  a  potential housing stock within such cities which is capa-
 ble, when appropriately altered, of  accommodating  general  residential
 use, thereby contributing to an alleviation of the housing shortage most
 severely affecting LOW, moderate and middle income families AND INDIVID-
 UALS,  and  of  accommodating  joint living-work quarters for artists by
 making readily available space  which  is  physically  and  economically
 suitable for use by persons regularly engaged in the arts.
  There is a public purpose to be served by making accommodations readi-
 ly  available for joint living-work quarters for artists for the follow-
 ing reasons:  persons regularly engaged  in  the  arts  require  larger
 amounts of space for the pursuit of their artistic endeavors and for the
 storage  of  the materials therefor and of the products thereof than are
 regularly to be found in dwellings subject to  this  article;  that  the
 S. 5080--A  3
 
 financial  remunerations  to be obtained from pursuit of a career in the
 arts are generally small; that as a result  of  such  limited  financial
 remuneration  persons  regularly  engaged  in the arts generally find it
 financially  impossible  to  maintain  quarters for the pursuit of their
 artistic endeavors separate and apart from their  places  of  residence;
 that the cultural life of cities of more than one million persons within
 this  state  and of the state as a whole is enhanced by the residence in
 such cities of large numbers of persons regularly engaged in  the  arts;
 that  the  high  cost  of  land within such cities makes it particularly
 difficult for persons regularly engaged in the arts to obtain the use of
 the amounts of space required for their work as aforesaid; and that  the
 residential  use  of  the space is secondary or accessory to the primary
 use as a place of work.
  It is further declared that the legislation governing  the  alteration
 of  such buildings to accommodate general residential use must of neces-
 sity be more restrictive  than  statutes  heretofore  in  effect,  which
 affected only joint living-work quarters for artists.
  It  is the intention of this legislation to promulgate statewide mini-
 mum standards for all alterations of non-residential buildings to  resi-
 dential  use,  but  the  legislature  is  cognizant that the use of such
 buildings for residential purposes must be consistent with local  zoning
 ordinances.  The  legislature  further recognizes that it is the role of
 localities to adopt regulations which will define in further detail  the
 manner  in  which alterations should be carried out where building types
 and conditions are peculiar to their local environment.
  2.  IT IS HEREBY ADDITIONALLY DECLARED AND FOUND THAT IN CITIES WITH A
 POPULATION IN EXCESS OF ONE MILLION, LARGE NUMBERS OF COMMERCIAL  BUILD-
 INGS HAVE LOST, AND CONTINUE TO LOSE, THEIR TENANTS TO MORE MODERN PREM-
 ISES  AND  TO  THE  CHANGING  NATURE  AND INCREASED PREVALENCE OF REMOTE
 OFFICE WORK IN THE WAKE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC;  THAT  THE  UNTENANTED
 PORTIONS  OF  SUCH BUILDINGS CONSTITUTE A POTENTIAL HOUSING STOCK WITHIN
 SUCH CITIES WHICH IS CAPABLE, WHEN APPROPRIATELY ALTERED, OF ACCOMMODAT-
 ING GENERAL RESIDENTIAL USE, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO AN  ALLEVIATION  OF
 THE  HOUSING SHORTAGE, ESPECIALLY THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IS
 A CRITICAL PROBLEM  THAT  THREATENS  THE  ECONOMIC,  ENVIRONMENTAL,  AND
 SOCIAL  QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT NEW YORK STATE AND DISPROPORTIONATELY
 BURDENS CERTAIN NEW YORKERS INCLUDING, BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO,  LOW-  AND
 MODERATE-INCOME,  RACIAL  AND  ETHNIC  MINORITY, AND ELDERLY HOUSEHOLDS;
 THAT THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL  BUILD-
 INGS  MOST  SUITABLE  FOR CONVERSION TO RESIDENTIAL USE ARE AREAS WITH A
 PARTICULARLY ACUTE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING; THAT  IN  FURTHERANCE
 OF  OVERALL  HOUSING  PRODUCTION GOALS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION
 GOALS, AND TO PROMOTE THE GREATEST EFFICIENCY, IT IS BOTH  A  MATTER  OF
 STATE  CONCERN  AND  THE  POLICY  OF  THE STATE TO PERMIT CONVERSIONS OF
 COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS TO RESIDENTIAL USES UNDER THE TERMS OF  THIS  ARTI-
 CLE,  INCLUDING THE TERMS THAT REQUIRE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO BE INCLUDED
 IN SUCH BUILDINGS; AND THAT IN  ORDER  TO  PREVENT  HOUSING  INSECURITY,
 HARDSHIP,  AND  DISLOCATION, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE ARE DESIGNED
 TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY, AND GENERAL WELFARE OF  THE  RESI-
 DENTS OF NEW YORK STATE.
  §  3.  Section 276 of the multiple dwelling law, as amended by chapter

 department of cultural affairs and/or state council  on  the  arts.  For
 joint  living-work quarters for artists limited to artists' occupancy by
