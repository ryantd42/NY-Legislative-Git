 79-r to read as follows:
  § 79-R. PENALTIES AND REMEDIES. 1. EVERY PERSON WHO,  UNDER  COLOR  OF
 ANY  STATUTE,  ORDINANCE,  REGULATION,  CUSTOM, OR USAGE, OF THIS STATE,
 SUBJECTS, OR CAUSES TO BE SUBJECTED, ANY CITIZEN OF THIS STATE OR  OTHER
 PERSON WITHIN THE JURISDICTION THEREOF TO THE DEPRIVATION OF ANY RIGHTS,
 PRIVILEGES,  OR  IMMUNITIES SECURED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THIS
 STATE, SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE PARTY INJURED IN AN ACTION AT LAW, SUIT IN
 EQUITY, OR OTHER PROPER PROCEEDING  FOR  REDRESS,  EXCEPT  THAT  IN  ANY
 ACTION  BROUGHT  AGAINST A JUDICIAL OFFICER FOR AN ACT OR OMISSION TAKEN
 IN SUCH OFFICER'S JUDICIAL CAPACITY,  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF  SHALL  NOT  BE
 GRANTED  UNLESS  A DECLARATORY DECREE WAS VIOLATED OR DECLARATORY RELIEF
 WAS UNAVAILABLE.
  2. THE SUPREME COURT SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION OVER  ALL  SUITS  BROUGHT
 FOR  THE  VINDICATION  OF CIVIL RIGHTS AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 THIS SECTION. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF THE STATE FURNISH A  REMEDY
 FOR  THE  VINDICATION  OF SUCH CIVIL RIGHTS, SUCH LAWS SHALL BE APPLIED;
 BUT IN ALL CASES WHERE SUCH LAWS ARE DEFICIENT IN THE PROVISIONS  NECES-
 SARY  TO  FURNISH SUITABLE REMEDIES, THE COMMON LAW SHALL BE EXTENDED TO
 AND GOVERN THE SAID COURTS IN THE TRIAL AND DISPOSITION OF  THE  MATTER.
 THE PARTIES IN AN ACTION BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL HAVE THE
 RIGHT  TO  A JURY TRIAL.  A REMEDY THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO A
 JURY TRIAL OR RECOVERY OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPERT  FEES  AS  PROVIDED

 IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT AGAINST A JUDICIAL OFFICER FOR AN ACT OR  OMISSION
 TAKEN IN SUCH OFFICER'S JUDICIAL CAPACITY SUCH OFFICER SHALL NOT BE HELD
