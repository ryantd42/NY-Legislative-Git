  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 14, 2024, as Donor Day in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of  New  York  State  and  across  the
Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 14, 2024, as
Donor Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance
of National Donor Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Donor  Day  was  started  in  1998  by  the U.S.
Department of Health  and  Human  Services  and  many  nonprofit  health
organizations  to  raise  awareness  for  organ,  eye,  tissue,  marrow,
platelet, and blood donation; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Donor Day is a time to focus  on  five  points  of
life:  organs, tissues, marrow, platelets, and blood by participating in
blood/marrow drives or donor registration events; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is also a day to recognize our loved ones who have given
the  gift  of donation, have received a donation, are currently waiting,
or did not receive an organ in time; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is a tremendous need for organ donations in New  York
State  with more than 9,000 New Yorkers on waiting lists as the need for
organ, tissue and blood donations far exceed the supply; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 400 New Yorkers died last year because  an  organ
did not become available in time to save their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  person who donates their organs (heart, lungs, liver,
kidneys, pancreas and intestines) can save up to eight lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, A tissue donor (corneas, bone, skin, heart valves, tendons,
veins, etc.) can improve 12 or more lives by restoring eyesight, helping
fight infections in burn patients and preventing the  loss  of  mobility
and disability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is possible to donate a kidney, partial liver, lung or
pancreas as a living donor, and in fact, approximately 40% of organ  and
tissue donations are from living donors; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness and
educational  initiatives  offered regarding the decision to donate one's
organs, eyes, tissues, marrow, platelet, and/or blood and more  must  be
done  to increase activity at the local, State and national levels; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 14, 2024, as
Donor Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
