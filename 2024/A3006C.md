 programs as such programs are defined by the commissioner,  subject  for
 the  purposes  of  this paragraph to the approval of the director of the

 whom such school district contracts with boards  of  cooperative  educa-
 tional  services to attend career education programs operated by a board

 this paragraph shall mean the sum of (I) THE PRODUCT OF  the  attendance
 of  STUDENTS  IN  GRADE NINE MULTIPLIED BY THE SPECIAL SERVICES PHASE-IN
 FACTOR PLUS (II) THE ATTENDANCE OF students in grades ten through twelve
 in career education sequences in trade, industrial, technical,  agricul-

 tion aid ratio shall be computed by subtracting  from  one  the  product
 obtained by multiplying fifty-nine percent by the combined wealth ratio.
 This  aid  ratio shall be expressed as a decimal carried to three places
 without rounding, but not less than thirty-six percent.
  Any school district that receives aid pursuant to this paragraph shall
 be required to use such amount to support career education  programs  in
 the current year.
  A board of education which spends less than its local funds as defined
 by regulations of the commissioner for career education in the base year
 during the current year shall have its apportionment under this subdivi-
 sion  reduced  in an amount equal to such deficiency in the current or a
 succeeding school year, provided however that the commissioner may waive

 36 of the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  1.  The  tenant continues in possession of any portion of the premises
 after the expiration of his term, without the permission of the landlord
 or, in a case where a new lessee is entitled to possession, without  the
 permission  of  the new lessee. Acceptance of rent after commencement of
 the special  proceeding  upon  this  ground  shall  not  terminate  such
 proceeding  nor effect any award of possession to the landlord or to the
 new lessee, as  the  case  may  be.  A  proceeding  seeking  to  recover
 possession  of  real  property  by reason of the termination of the term
 fixed in the lease pursuant to a provision contained therein giving  the
 landlord  the right to terminate the time fixed for occupancy under such
 agreement if he deem the tenant objectionable, shall not be maintainable
 unless the landlord shall by competent evidence establish to the  satis-
 faction  of  the  court that the tenant is objectionable.  NO PROCEEDING
 SHALL BE MAINTAINED UNLESS THE COURT HAS NOTIFIED  AN INDIVIDUAL OF  THE
 ABILITY  TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL CONSULTATION, AS APPLI-
 CABLE, PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  2. The tenant has defaulted in the payment of rent,  pursuant  to  the
 agreement under which the premises are held, and a written demand of the
 rent has been made with at least fourteen days' notice requiring, in the
 alternative, the payment of the rent, or the possession of the premises,
 has  been served upon him as prescribed in section seven hundred thirty-
 five of this article. NO PROCEEDING SHALL BE MAINTAINED UNLESS THE COURT
 HAS NOTIFIED AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION
 OR LEGAL CONSULTATION, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT  HUNDRED
 THIRTY  OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW. Any person succeeding to the landlord's
 interest in the premises may proceed under this subdivision for rent due
 his predecessor in interest if he has a right thereto.  Where  a  tenant
 dies during the term of the lease and rent due has not been paid and the
 apartment is occupied by a person with a claim to possession, a proceed-
 ing  may  be  commenced  naming the occupants of the apartment seeking a
 possessory judgment only as against the estate. Entry of such a judgment
 shall be without prejudice to the possessory claims  of  the  occupants,
 and any warrant issued shall not be effective as against the occupants.
 A. 3006--B  54
 
  §  4.  Section 713 of the real property actions and proceedings law is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 12 to read as follows:
  12.  NO  PROCEEDING SHALL BE MAINTAINED, UNLESS THE COURT HAS PROVIDED

 LAW, APPEARS IN COURT WITHOUT  COUNSEL,  THE  COURT  SHALL  NOTIFY  SUCH
 RESPONDENT ORALLY OF THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION PURSUANT
 TO  SECTION  EIGHT  HUNDRED  THIRTY  OF  THE  EXECUTIVE LAW, AND IF SUCH
 RESPONDENT WOULD LIKE COUNSEL, THE COURT SHALL  ADJOURN  THE  TRIAL  AND
 PROVIDE  SUFFICIENT TIME, NOT LESS THAN FOURTEEN DAYS, FOR SUCH RESPOND-
 ENT TO RETAIN AND CONSULT COUNSEL AND SHALL GRANT SUCH FURTHER  ADJOURN-
 MENTS AS THE COURT DEEMS NECESSARY FOR SUCH COVERED INDIVIDUAL TO OBTAIN
 COUNSEL.
  §  6. Subdivisions 1 and 3 of section 749 of the real property actions
 and proceedings law, as amended by section 19 of part M of chapter 36 of
 the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  1. Upon rendering a final judgment for  petitioner,  the  court  shall
 issue  a warrant directed to the sheriff of the county or to any consta-
 ble or marshal of the city in which the property, or a portion  thereof,
 is  situated,  or,  if it is not situated in a city, to any constable of
 any town in the county, describing the property,  stating  the  earliest
 date  upon which execution may occur pursuant to the order of the court,
 and commanding the officer to remove all persons named in  the  proceed-
 ing,  provided  upon a showing of good cause, the court may issue a stay
 of re-letting or renovation of the premises for a reasonable  period  of
 time.  HOWEVER, NO COURT SHALL ISSUE A JUDGMENT AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE
 OF A WARRANT OF EVICTION AGAINST A  RESPONDENT  WHO  HAS  DEFAULTED,  OR
 AUTHORIZE  THE  EXECUTION OF AN EVICTION PURSUANT TO A DEFAULT JUDGMENT,
 UNLESS THE COURT HAS PROVIDED THE RESPONDENT WITH WRITTEN NOTICE OF  THE
 RESPONDENT'S  ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL CONSULTA-
 TION, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT  HUNDRED  THIRTY  OF  THE
 EXECUTIVE LAW IN EVICTION PROCEEDINGS IN THE NOTICE REQUIRED BY SECTIONS
 SEVEN  HUNDRED  ELEVEN, SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-ONE AND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-
 FIVE OF THIS ARTICLE.
  3. Nothing contained herein shall deprive the court of  the  power  to
 stay  or vacate such warrant for good cause shown prior to the execution
 thereof, or to restore the tenant to possession subsequent to  execution
 of  the  warrant.  THE  FAILURE  OF THE COURT TO ADVISE AN INDIVIDUAL OF
 THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL  CONSULTATION,  AS
 APPLICABLE,  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EXECUTIVE
 LAW IN AN EVICTION PROCEEDING SHALL CONSTITUTE GOOD  CAUSE  TO  STAY  OR
 VACATE  SUCH  WARRANT.  In a judgment for non-payment of rent, the court
 shall vacate a warrant upon tender or deposit with the court of the full
 rent due at any time prior  to  its  execution,  unless  the  petitioner
 establishes  that  the tenant withheld the rent due in bad faith.  Peti-
 tioner may recover by action any sum of money which was payable  at  the
 time  when the special proceeding was commenced and the reasonable value
 of the use and occupation to the time when the warrant was  issued,  for
 any period of time with respect to which the agreement does not make any
 provision for payment of rent.
 A. 3006--B  55

 TENANT'S  ABILITY  TO  OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL CONSULTATION
 UNDER SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW,  AS  MAY  BE
 APPLICABLE, SHALL BE VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE.

 cation  of  any  provision  of  this  act,  is held to be invalid, or to
 violate or be inconsistent with any  federal  law  or  regulation,  that
 shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of any other provision of
 this  act,  which can be given effect without that provision or applica-
 tion;  and to that end, the provisions and applications of this act  are
 severable.
  § 9. This act shall take effect January 1,  2024;  provided,  however,
 that  sections  two through seven of this act shall take effect one year
 after such date.
