 S. 4006--C  25  A. 3006--C

  3.  The  commissioner of education shall not be authorized to withhold
 foundation aid from a school district that used such funds in accordance
 with this subdivision, notwithstanding any inconsistency with a  request

 for any city school district in a city having a population of more  than
 one  million,  the  set-aside  for  attendance  improvement  and dropout

 for the current year shall be deemed to incorporate all  funds  distrib-
 uted  pursuant to former subdivision 27 of section 3602 of the education
 law for prior years. In school districts where the teachers are  repres-
 ented  by  certified  or  recognized  employee organizations, all salary
 increases funded pursuant to this section shall be determined  by  sepa-
 rate  collective  negotiations  conducted pursuant to the provisions and
 procedures of article 14 of the civil service law,  notwithstanding  the
 existence  of  a  negotiated  agreement  between a school district and a

  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary the  moneys
 appropriated  for the support of public libraries for the year 2023-2024
 by a chapter of the laws of 2023 enacting the aid to  localities  budget
 shall  fulfill  the state's obligation to provide such aid and, pursuant

 basic and remedial education, education in English  proficiency,  educa-
 tion  or  a  course  of  instruction  in financial literacy and personal

 for high cost items, participation  in  a  higher  education  course  of

 following providers which meet the performance or  assessment  standards
 established  in  regulations  by  the commissioner for such providers: a
 community college, licensed trade school, registered business school, or
 a two-year or four-year college; provided, however, that such  post-sec-
 ondary  education  must  be  necessary  to the attainment of the partic-
 ipant's individual employment goal as set  forth  in  the  employability

 undue hardship caused by an event such as a personal injury  or  illness
 of  the  student, the death of a relative of the student or other exten-
 uating circumstances. [Any enrollment in post-secondary education beyond
 a twelve month period must be combined with no less than twenty hours of
 participation averaged weekly in paid employment or work  activities  or
 community  service when paid employment is not available.] PARTICIPATION

 program.

 program after it has been in effect for six months and  again  upon  the

 nor, the temporary president of the  Senate,  and  the  speaker  of  the
 Assembly,  and  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited to, the following
 comparative performance metrics: (a) ridership totals relative to equiv-
 alent time periods before  the  pilot  took  effect;  (b)  increases  or
 decreases  in fare evasion  on adjacent/redundant bus routes and subways
 during the fare-free bus pilot program relative to the  equivalent  time
 period  before  the fare-free bus pilot program took effect; (c) percent
 of scheduled service delivered; (d) average end-to-end bus speed  chang-
 es;  (e) customer journey time performance; (f) additional bus stop time
 and travel time; (g) wait assessments; (h)  the  cost  to  provide  such
 service  itemized by route; (i) scheduled service frequency; and (j) any
 other impacts associated with and  resulting  from  such  fare-free  bus

 hereof, the present value of the aggregate debt service of the refunding
 or repayment bonds, notes or other obligations and of the aggregate debt
 service of the bonds, notes or other obligations so refunded or  repaid,
 shall  be  calculated  by  utilizing  the effective interest rate of the

 (compounded  semi-annually)  necessary  to  discount  the  debt  service
 payments on the refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other obligations
 from the payment dates thereof to the date of issue of the refunding  or

  § 2. Section 371 of the executive law, as added by chapter 707 of  the
 laws of 1981, is amended to read as follows:
  § 371. Statement of legislative findings and purposes. 1. The legisla-
 ture hereby finds and declares that:
  a. The present level of loss of life, injury to persons, and damage to
 property  as  a result of fire demonstrates that the people of the state
 have yet to receive the basic level of  protection  to  which  they  are
 entitled  in  connection with the construction and maintenance of build-
 ings;
  b. There does not exist for all areas of the state a single, adequate,
 enforceable code establishing minimum standards for fire protection  and
 S. 4006--C  133  A. 3006--C
 
 construction,  maintenance  and  use of materials in buildings. Instead,
 there exists a multiplicity of codes and requirements for various  types
 of  buildings  administered at various levels of state and local govern-
 ment.  There  are, in addition, extensive areas of the state in which no
 code at all is in effect for the general benefit of the  people  of  the
 state;
  c.  The  present system of enforcement of fire protection and building
 construction codes is characterized by  a  lack  of  adequately  trained
 personnel,  as  well  as  inconsistent  qualifications for personnel who
 administer and enforce those codes;
  d. Whether because of the absence of applicable codes, inadequate code
 provisions or inadequate enforcement of codes, the threat to the  public
 health  and  safety  posed by fire remains a real and present danger for
 the people of the state; and
  e. The multiplicity of fire protection and building construction  code
 requirements  poses  an  additional  problem for the people of the state
 since it increases the cost of doing business in the state by perpetuat-
 ing multiple requirements, jurisdictional overlaps and  business  uncer-
 tainties,  and,  in  some  instances,  by  artificially  inducing  high
 construction costs.
  2. The legislature declares that it shall be the public policy of  the
 state of New York to:
  a.  Immediately  provide  for  a  minimum level of protection from the
 hazards of fire in every part of the state;
  b. Provide for the promulgation of a uniform code addressing  building
 construction  and  fire  prevention  in order to provide a basic minimum
 level of protection to all people of the state from hazards of fire  and
 inadequate  building construction. In providing for such a uniform code,
 it is declared to be the policy of the state of New York to:
  (1) reconcile the myriad existing and  potentially  conflicting  regu-
 lations which apply to different types of buildings and occupancies;
  (2)  recognize  that  fire  prevention  and  fire prevention codes are
 closely related to the adequacy of building construction codes, that the
 greatest portion of a  building  code's  requirements  are  fire  safety
 oriented,  and  that  fire prevention and building construction concerns
 should be the subject of a single code;
  (3) RECOGNIZE THAT THE DECARBONIZATION OF NEW AND  EXISTING  BUILDINGS
 IS  CLOSELY  RELATED  TO  THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE AGENDA AS
 DESCRIBED IN THE NEW YORK CLIMATE LEADERSHIP  AND  COMMUNITY  PROTECTION
 ACT  SET  FORTH  IN  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND
 NINETEEN, AND THAT THE UNIFORM CODE SHALL ENABLE THE STATE'S CLEAN ENER-
 GY OBJECTIVES;
  (4) place public and private buildings on an equal plane with  respect
 to fire prevention and adequacy of building construction;
  [(4)]  (5)  require new and existing buildings alike to keep pace with
 advances  in  technology  concerning  fire  prevention  and  building
 construction,  including,  where appropriate, that provisions apply on a
 retroactive basis; and
  [(5)] (6) provide protection to both residential  and  non-residential
 buildings;
  c.  Insure  that the uniform code be in full force and effect in every
 area of the state;
  d. Encourage local governments to exercise their full powers to admin-
 ister and enforce the uniform code; and
 S. 4006--C  134  A. 3006--C
 
  e. Provide for a uniform, statewide approach to the training and qual-
 ification of personnel engaged in the administration and enforcement  of
 the uniform code.

  PART UU
 
  Section 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Marijua-
 na  Regulation  and  Taxation  Act (MRTA) envisioned the creation of new
 legal industries in which cannabis is regulated, controlled  and  taxed,
 and  the  generation  of  new  revenue  streams  that enable substantial
 investments  into communities and for the people most impacted by canna-
 bis criminalization.  The Legislature  further  finds  that  additional
 regulations to curb illegal cannabis retail establishments are necessary
 to  fully  effectuate the MRTA and ensure that the goals of the MRTA are
 achieved.
  § 2. Subdivisions (a) and (g) of section 492 of the tax law, as  added
 by chapter 92 of the laws of 2021, are amended and a new subdivision (l)

 meaning  as  the  term  is defined in section three of the cannabis law]
 MEANS CANNABIS, CONCENTRATED CANNABIS, AND CANNABIS-INFUSED PRODUCTS, AS
 REFLECTED ON THE PRODUCT LABEL, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH  ADULT-USE  CANNABIS
 PRODUCT  IS FOR USE BY A CANNABIS CONSUMER AS SUCH A CONSUMER IS DEFINED
 IN SUBDIVISION SIX OF SECTION THREE OF THE CANNABIS LAW. For purposes of
 this article, under no circumstances shall  adult-use  cannabis  product
 include  medical  cannabis  or  cannabinoid  hemp  product as defined in
 section three of the cannabis law.
  (g) "Illicit cannabis" means and includes  [cannabis  flower,  concen-
 trated  cannabis, cannabis edible product and cannabis plant] ANY ADULT-
 USE CANNABIS  PRODUCT,  INCLUDING  CONCENTRATED  CANNABIS  AND  CANNABIS
 EDIBLE  PRODUCTS  on which any tax required to have been paid under this
 chapter has not been paid. Illicit cannabis shall not include any canna-
 bis lawfully possessed in accordance with the cannabis law or penal law.
  (L) "POSSESSION FOR SALE" OR "POSSESSED FOR SALE" MEANS POSSESSION  OF
 MORE  THAN  FIVE  POUNDS OF ADULT-USE CANNABIS PRODUCTS, OR ONE POUND OF
 CONCENTRATED CANNABIS PRODUCTS OR CANNABIS EDIBLE PRODUCTS, AT  A  BUSI-
 NESS  OR  OTHER  LOCATION  USED FOR THE STORAGE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF
 SUCH CANNABIS PRODUCTS WITH THE INTENT THAT SUCH  PRODUCTS  BE  SOLD  AT
 RETAIL.  POSSESSION SHALL BE PRESUMED TO BE FOR SALE WHEN THE ADULT-USE
 CANNABIS PRODUCTS ARE POSSESSED IN ANY PLACE OF BUSINESS  USED  FOR  THE
 BUYING AND SELLING OF SUCH ADULT-USE CANNABIS PRODUCTS. POSSESSION SHALL

  § 3. Section 494 of the tax law, as added by chapter 92 of the laws of

 properly completed application for a  certificate  of  registration  AND
 OBTAIN  SUCH CERTIFICATE before engaging in business, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
 THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO  A  NATURAL  PERSON  ENGAGED  IN  LAWFUL

 prescribed by the commissioner, and must be accompanied by a non-refund-
 able application fee of six hundred dollars. A certificate of  registra-
 tion  shall  not  be  assignable  or transferable and shall be destroyed
 S. 4006--C  145  A. 3006--C
 
 immediately upon such person ceasing to do business as specified in such
 certificate, or in the event that such business never commenced.
  [(ii)]  (2)  Provided,  however, that the commissioner shall refund or
 credit an application fee paid with respect to the  registration  of  an
 adult-use  cannabis business in this state if, prior to the beginning of
 the period with respect to which such registration relates, the  certif-
 icate  of  registration described in [subparagraph (i)] PARAGRAPH ONE of
 this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION is returned to the department or,  if  such
 certificate  has been destroyed, the operator of such business satisfac-
 torily accounts to the commissioner for  the  missing  certificate,  but
 such  business  may  not  sell adult-use cannabis products in this state
 during such period, unless it is re-registered. Such  refund  or  credit
 shall  be  deemed  a  refund of tax paid in error, provided, however, no
 interest shall be allowed or paid on any such refund.
  (b) (1) The commissioner shall refuse to issue a certificate of regis-
 tration to any applicant and shall revoke the certificate  of  registra-
 tion  of  any  such person who does not possess a valid license from the
 office of cannabis management.

 CANNABIS  PRODUCTS  AT  RETAIL  AND  WHO  IS  NOT  REGISTERED UNDER THIS
 SECTION, OR WHOSE REGISTRATION HAS BEEN SUSPENDED OR REVOKED; OR
  (IX) HAS A PLACE OF BUSINESS  AT  THE  SAME  PREMISES  AS  THAT  OF  A
 DISTRIBUTOR  UPON  WHOM TAX IS IMPOSED UNDER THIS ARTICLE, OR PERSON WHO
 SELLS ADULT-USE CANNABIS PRODUCTS AT RETAIL, WHOSE REGISTRATION HAS BEEN
 REVOKED AND WHERE SUCH REVOCATION IS STILL IN EFFECT, UNLESS THE  APPLI-
 CANT PROVIDES THE COMMISSIONER WITH ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION DEMONSTRATING
 THAT  SUCH  APPLICANT ACQUIRED THE PREMISES OR BUSINESS THROUGH AN ARM'S
 LENGTH TRANSACTION AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH (E)  OF  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF
 SECTION FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY-A OF THIS CHAPTER AND THAT THE SALE OR LEASE
 WAS  NOT  CONDUCTED,  IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FOR THE PURPOSE OF PERMITTING
 THE ORIGINAL REGISTRANT TO AVOID THE EFFECT OF THE  PREVIOUS  REVOCATION
 FOR THE SAME PREMISES.
 S. 4006--C  146  A. 3006--C
 
  (3) THE COMMISSIONER MAY REVOKE THE CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION ISSUED
 TO ANY PERSON WHO:
  (I)  HAS  HAD ANY LICENSE OR REGISTRATION PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CHAPTER

 of] this subdivision, where a person who holds a certificate  of  regis-

 years]; AND
  [(3)]  (III)  FOR  A  PERIOD  OF  UP  TO  FIVE  YEARS for a third such
 possession or sale within a  period  of  [up  to]  five  years  by  such

 this  paragraph immediately upon such person's receipt of written notice

 title[, by a securing order release the principal on the principal's own
 recognizance,  release  the principal under non-monetary conditions, or,
 where authorized, fix bail or commit the principal to the custody of the
 sheriff. In all such cases, except where another type of securing  order
 is  shown  to  be required by law, the court shall release the principal
 pending trial on the principal's own recognizance, unless it  is  demon-
 strated  and].  EXCEPT  AS  OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW, the court [makes]
 SHALL MAKE an individualized determination  [that]  AS  TO  WHETHER  the
 principal poses a risk of flight to avoid prosecution, CONSIDER THE KIND

 the court must select the least restrictive alternative and condition or
 conditions that will reasonably assure the principal's return to court.]
 The  court  shall explain THE BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION AND its choice
 of [release, release with conditions, bail or remand] SECURING ORDER  on

 section, the court shall release the  principal  pending  trial  on  the
 principal's own recognizance, unless the court finds on the record or in
 writing  that  release  on  the  principal's  own  recognizance will not
 reasonably assure the principal's return to court.  In  such  instances,
 the  court  shall  release the principal under non-monetary conditions[,
 selecting the least restrictive alternative and conditions] AS  PROVIDED
 FOR  IN  SUBDIVISION  THREE-A  OF SECTION 500.10 OF THIS TITLE that will

 non-monetary conditions, fix bail, OR ORDER NON-MONETARY  CONDITIONS  IN
 CONJUNCTION  WITH FIXING BAIL, or, where the defendant is charged with a
 qualifying offense which is a felony, the court may commit the principal

  1.  Upon  any  occasion  when a court has issued a securing order with
 respect to a principal and the principal is confined in the  custody  of
 the  sheriff  as  a  result of the securing order or a previously issued
 securing order, the principal may make an application for  recognizance,
 release  under  non-monetary conditions [or], bail, A REDUCTION OF BAIL,
 S. 4006--C  166  A. 3006--C
 
 OR IMPOSITION OF NON-MONETARY CONDITIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH BAIL  OR  A

  (b)  Upon such application, the principal must be accorded an opportu-
 nity to be heard, present evidence and  to  contend  that  an  order  of
 recognizance,  release  under  non-monetary conditions or, where author-
 ized, bail, A REDUCTION OF BAIL, OR IMPOSITION  OF  NON-MONETARY  CONDI-
 TIONS  IN  CONJUNCTION  WITH BAIL OR A REDUCTION OF BAIL, must or should
 issue, that the court should release the principal  on  the  principal's
 own  recognizance or under non-monetary conditions rather than fix bail,
 OR WHERE BAIL HAS BEEN IMPOSED, REDUCE THE AMOUNT  OF  BAIL  AND  IMPOSE
 NON-MONETARY  CONDITIONS, WHERE AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS TITLE, and that if
 bail is authorized and fixed it should be  in  a  suggested  amount  and
 form.

 THIS  SECTION  AND  ONE  OR  MORE OF THE CHARGE OR CHARGES ON WHICH SUCH
 SECURING ORDER WAS BASED HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AND/OR  REDUCED  SUCH  THAT
 THE  SECURING  ORDER IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION

 degree of control or restriction that is necessary to secure the princi-
 pal's return to court when required. In  determining  that  matter,  the

 CLE, AND SHALL EXPLAIN THE BASIS FOR ITS  DETERMINATION  AND  CHOICE  OF
 SECURING ORDER ON THE RECORD OR IN WRITING.

 S. 4006--C  167  A. 3006--C
 
  3.  Non-monetary  conditions  of  release  shall be individualized and
 established in writing by the court. At future  court  appearances,  the
 court shall consider a lessening of conditions or modification of condi-
 tions to a less burdensome form based on the principal's compliance with
 such  conditions of release. In the event of alleged non-compliance with
 the conditions of release in an  important  respect,  pursuant  to  this
 subdivision,  additional  conditions may be imposed by the court, on the
 record or in writing, only after notice of the facts  and  circumstances
 of  such  alleged  non-compliance,  reasonable  under the circumstances,
 affording the principal and the principal's attorney and the  people  an
 opportunity to present relevant, admissible evidence, relevant witnesses
 and  to  cross-examine  witnesses, and a finding by clear and convincing
 evidence that the principal violated a condition of release in an impor-
 tant respect. Following such a finding, in determining whether to impose
 additional conditions for non-compliance, the court shall  consider  and
 may  select conditions [consistent with the court's obligation to impose
 the least restrictive condition or conditions] AS PROVIDED FOR IN SUBDI-
 VISION THREE-A OF SECTION 500.10 OF  THIS  TITLE  that  will  reasonably
 assure  the  defendant's return to court. The court shall explain on the
 record or in writing the reasons  for  its  determination  and  for  any
 changes to the conditions imposed.

 tive] THE procedure and method [that will] OF SUCH ELECTRONIC MONITORING

 principal's  return  to  court, and SHALL BE unobtrusive to the greatest
 extent practicable.

  Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision or  any  other

 ING  ORDER  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  PARAGRAPH (D) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE
 BASIS FOR WHICH SHALL BE MADE ON THE RECORD OR IN WRITING, in such crim-
 inal action or proceeding  when  the  court  has  found,  by  clear  and
 convincing evidence, that the defendant:
  Upon  expiration  of  any  of  the three periods specified within this
 subparagraph, whichever is shortest, the court may grant or deny release
 upon an order of bail or recognizance in accordance with the  provisions
 of this article. Upon conviction to an offense the provisions of article
 five hundred thirty of this chapter shall apply; [and]
  (ii)  Under  SUBPARAGRAPH  (I)  OF  paragraph (b) of this subdivision,
 revocation of [the order of  recognizance,  release  under  non-monetary
 conditions  or,  as  the case may be, bail] A PREVIOUSLY ISSUED SECURING
 ORDER shall result in the issuance of a new securing order which may, if
 otherwise authorized by law, permit the principal's release on  recogni-
 zance  or  release  under non-monetary conditions, but shall also render
 the defendant eligible for an order fixing bail, OR  ORDERING  NON-MONE-
 TARY CONDITIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH FIXING BAIL, provided, however, that
 in  accordance  with the principles in this title the court must [select
 the least restrictive alternative and condition or conditions that  will
 reasonably assure the principal's return to court] IMPOSE A NEW SECURING
 ORDER  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF SECTION 510.10 OF THIS
 TITLE, AND IN  IMPOSING  SUCH  ORDER,  MAY  CONSIDER  THE  CIRCUMSTANCES
 WARRANTING SUCH REVOCATION. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be inter-
 preted  as shortening the period of detention, or requiring or authoriz-
 ing any less restrictive form of a securing order, which may be  imposed
 pursuant to any other law[.]; AND
  (III)  UNDER  SUBPARAGRAPHS  (II), (III), AND (IV) OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION, REVOCATION OF A PREVIOUSLY ISSUED SECURING ORDER SHALL
 RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF A NEW SECURING ORDER WHICH MAY,  IF  OTHERWISE

 RELEASE UNDER NON-MONETARY CONDITIONS, BUT SHALL ALSO RENDER THE DEFEND-
 ANT ELIGIBLE FOR AN ORDER FIXING BAIL OR  ORDERING  NON-MONETARY  CONDI-

 ORDER, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER  THE  KIND  AND  DEGREE  OF  CONTROL  OR
 RESTRICTION  NECESSARY  TO  REASONABLY  ASSURE THE PRINCIPAL'S RETURN TO
 COURT AND COMPLIANCE WITH COURT CONDITIONS, AND SELECT A SECURING  ORDER
 CONSISTENT  WITH  ITS  DETERMINATION,  TAKING  INTO  ACCOUNT THE FACTORS
 REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER SUBDIVISION ONE  OF  SECTION  510.10  OF
 S. 4006--C  172  A. 3006--C

 ED  AS  SHORTENING  THE PERIOD OF DETENTION, OR REQUIRING OR AUTHORIZING
 ANY LESS RESTRICTIVE FORM OF A SECURING  ORDER,  WHICH  MAY  BE  IMPOSED
 PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER LAW.

 130.40, 205.10, 205.17, 205.19 or 215.56 of the penal law, [he] OR OTHER
 THAN WHERE AN ARREST IS REQUIRED TO BE MADE PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION FOUR
 OF SECTION 140.10 OF THIS TITLE, THE OFFICER shall, except as set out in
 paragraph (b) of this subdivision, subject to the provisions of subdivi-
 sions  three  and four of section 150.40 of this title, instead issue to
 and serve upon such person an appearance ticket.
  § 2. Subdivision 2 of section 150.20 of the criminal procedure law, as
 amended by chapter 550 of the laws  of  1987,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  2.  (a)  Whenever,  PURSUANT TO SECTION 140.10 OF THIS TITLE, a police

 violation of section 130.25, 130.40, 205.10, 205.17, 205.19 or 215.56 of
 the  penal  law pursuant to section 140.25 OF THIS TITLE, and SUCH PEACE
 OFFICER has requested a police officer to  issue  and  serve  upon  such
 arrested  person  an  appearance  ticket pursuant to subdivision four of
 section 140.27 OF THIS TITLE, or (c) whenever a person has been arrested
 for an offense other than a class A, B, C or D felony or a violation  of
 section  130.25,  130.40,  205.10, 205.17, 205.19 or 215.56 of the penal
 law and SUCH PERSON has been delivered to the custody of an  appropriate
 police  officer  pursuant  to  section 140.40 OF THIS TITLE, such police
 officer may, instead of bringing such person  before  a  local  criminal
 court  and  promptly  filing  or  causing the arresting peace officer or
 arresting person to file a local criminal  court  accusatory  instrument
 therewith,  issue  to  and  serve upon such person an appearance ticket.
 [The issuance and service of an appearance  ticket  under  such  circum-
 stances  may  be  conditioned upon a deposit of pre-arraignment bail, as
 provided in section 150.30.]
  § 3. Subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 140.20 of the criminal  procedure
 law,  as amended by chapter 550 of the laws of 1987, are amended to read

 or 215.56 of the penal law, OR OTHER THAN WHERE AN ARREST IS REQUIRED TO
 BE MADE  PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION FOUR OF SECTION 140.10 OF THIS ARTICLE,
 the arrested person need not be brought before a local criminal court as
 provided  in  subdivision  one,  and  the  procedure  may  instead be as
 follows:
  (a) A police officer may issue and serve an appearance ticket upon the
 arrested person and release him from custody, as prescribed in  subdivi-
 sion two of section 150.20 OF THIS TITLE; or
  (b)  The  desk  officer  in charge at a police station, county jail or
 police headquarters, or any of his superior officers, may, in such place
 fix pre-arraignment bail and, upon deposit thereof, issue and  serve  an
 appearance  ticket  upon the arrested person and release him from custo-
 dy[, as prescribed in section 150.30].
  3. [If] OTHER THAN WHERE AN ARREST IS REQUIRED TO BE MADE PURSUANT  TO
 SUBDIVISION FOUR OF SECTION 140.10 OF THIS ARTICLE, IF (a) the arrest is
 for  an offense other than a class A, B, C or D felony or a violation of
 section 130.25, 130.40, 205.10, 205.17, 205.19 or 215.56  of  the  penal
 law,  and  (b)  owing  to  unavailability  of a local criminal court the
 arresting police officer is unable to bring the arrested  person  before
 such  a  court  with  reasonable promptness, either an appearance ticket
 must be served unconditionally upon the arrested person or  pre-arraign-
 ment  bail  must be fixed, as prescribed in subdivision two. If pre-arr-
 aignment bail is fixed but not  posted,  such  arrested  person  may  be
 temporarily  held in custody but must be brought before a local criminal
 court without unnecessary delay. Nothing contained in  this  subdivision
 requires a police officer to serve an appearance ticket upon an arrested
 person or release him from custody at a time when such person appears to
 be under the influence of alcohol, narcotics or other drug to the degree
 that he may endanger himself or other persons.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
