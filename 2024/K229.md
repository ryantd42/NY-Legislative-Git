  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Colorectal  cancer  is  the second leading cause of cancer
deaths in men and women, combined, in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is estimated that in the year  2023,  over  153,020  new
cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  year  2023,  the  disease  is expected to kill an
estimated 52,550 individuals in this country; and
 
  WHEREAS, An estimated 8,970 men and women in the State of  New  York
will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the year 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  November  of  1999,  the  United  States Senate passed
legislation declaring March 2000 as the first-ever  National  Colorectal
Cancer Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Colon Cancer Alliance, Inc. (CCA) will continue working
with  Congress for coverage, education, and awareness so that colorectal
cancer is detected early and lives are saved; and
 
  WHEREAS, Screening for colorectal cancer is underutilized; less than
50 percent of individuals above age 50  receive  annual  screenings  for
colorectal cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Regular  screenings,  which can detect polyps that lead to
colorectal cancer, can save lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Education can help  inform  the  public  about  methods  of
prevention, and about symptoms, to aid in early detection; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Adopting  a  healthy diet at a young age can significantly
reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York should help inform the  public  about
colorectal cancer prevention and screening; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2023, as  Colorectal
Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and The Colon Cancer Alliance, Inc.
