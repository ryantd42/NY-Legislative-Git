  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

 law relating to the finality of certain utility charges and the contents
 of utility bills, as proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 4234-A and
 A.  4055-A, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law, [no] IF A utility
 corporation or municipality [shall charge] DOES NOT RENDER a residential
 customer for gas or electric service [which was rendered more than two],
 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SEASONAL OR SHORT-TERM CUSTOMER  AS  DEFINED  BY

 THEN,  SUCH  RESIDENTIAL  CUSTOMER SHALL NOT BE CHARGED FOR SUCH GAS AND
 ELECTRIC SERVICES WHICH WERE NOT BILLED  TO  THE  CUSTOMER  AS  PROVIDED
 HEREIN,  UNLESS  the  failure of the corporation or municipality to bill

 liable  for  such  service, the utility shall permit payments to be made
 under an installment payment plan, provided, however, that  the  utility
 or  municipality  may require prompt payment if the non-billing resulted
 from the culpable conduct of the customer. Any such installment  payment
