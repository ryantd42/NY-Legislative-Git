  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 9, 2024, as Eid al-Fitr Day in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to  those  who
foster  ethnic pride and enhance the profile of cultural diversity which
strengthens the fabric of the communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 9, 2024, Eid al-Fitr Day in the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eid al-Fitr also called the Festival of Breaking the  Fast,
is  a  religious  holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the
end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan; and
 
  WHEREAS, This religious Eid is the only day in the month of  Shawwal
during  which  Muslims are not permitted to fast; the date for the start
of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon is sighted by
local religious  authorities,  so  the  day  of  celebration  varies  by
locality;  furthermore,  the  holiday  is  widely  called Korite in West
Africa; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eid al-Fitr has a particular salat  (Islamic  prayer)  that
consists  of  two rakats (units) generally performed in an open field or
large hall; it may only be performed in congregation  and  features  six
additional  Takbirs  (raising of the hands to the ears while saying "God
is the greatest") in the Hanafi school of  Sunni  Islam:  three  at  the
start of the first rakat and three just before ruku in the second rakat;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Other Sunni schools have twelve Takbirs, similarly split in
groups  of  seven  and five; in Shia Islam, the salat has six Takbirs in
the first rakat at the end of qira'a,  before  ruku,  and  five  in  the
second; depending on the juristic opinion of the locality, this salat is
either  fard  (obligatory),  mustahabb  (strongly recommended) or mandub
(preferable); and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  acknowledge  various
cultures of people who add to the overall diversity of our State and, on
this  occasion,  we  take the opportunity to recognize the contributions
made by Muslims and extend best wishes to all of  its  members  as  they
hold  appropriate  ceremonies  to  commemorate  this  milestone;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 9, 2024, as Eid
al-Fitr Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
