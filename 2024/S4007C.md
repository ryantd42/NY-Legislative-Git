 reduction percentage from the base period medicaid  revenue  percentage.
 The  1999  medicaid  revenue  reduction percentages, taking into account
 regional and program differences in utilization of medicaid and medicare
 services, for the following regional groups shall be equal to:
  (i) eight hundred twenty-five thousandths  (.825)  of  one  percentage
 point for CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii)  forty-five  hundredths  (.45)  of one percentage point for CHHAs
 located within the upstate region;
  (iii) one and thirty-five  hundredths  percentage  points  (1.35)  for
 LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv)  one  and  two hundred seventy-five thousandths percentage points
 (1.275) for LTHHCPs located within the upstate region.
  5. (a) For each regional group, if the 1996 medicaid revenue  percent-
 age  is  not  equal  to  or  less  than the 1996 target medicaid revenue
 percentage, the commissioner of health shall compare the  1996  medicaid
 revenue  percentage  to  the  1996 target medicaid revenue percentage to
 determine the amount of the shortfall which, when divided  by  the  1996
 medicaid  revenue  reduction  percentage,  shall  be  called  the  1996
 reduction factor. These amounts, expressed as a  percentage,  shall  not
 exceed  one  hundred percent. If the 1996 medicaid revenue percentage is
 equal to or less than the 1996 target medicaid revenue  percentage,  the
 1996 reduction factor shall be zero.
  (b)  For  1997,  1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006,
 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017,  2018,
 2019,  2020, 2021, 2022 [and], 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 AND 2027, for each
 regional group, if the medicaid revenue percentage  for  the  respective
 year is not equal to or less than the target medicaid revenue percentage
 for  such respective year, the commissioner of health shall compare such
 respective year's medicaid revenue percentage to such respective  year's
 target medicaid revenue percentage to determine the amount of the short-
 S. 4007--B  15
 
 fall  which,  when  divided  by  the  respective year's medicaid revenue
 reduction percentage, shall be called  the  reduction  factor  for  such
 respective  year.  These  amounts,  expressed as a percentage, shall not
 exceed  one  hundred  percent.  If the medicaid revenue percentage for a
 particular year is equal to or less than  the  target  medicaid  revenue
 percentage  for  that  year, the reduction factor for that year shall be
 zero.
  6. (a) For each regional group, the 1996  reduction  factor  shall  be
 multiplied  by  the following amounts to determine each regional group's
 applicable 1996 state share reduction amount:
  (i) two million three hundred ninety thousand dollars ($2,390,000) for
 CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii) seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) for CHHAs located
 within the upstate region;
  (iii) one million two hundred seventy  thousand  dollars  ($1,270,000)
 for LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv)  five  hundred  ninety  thousand  dollars  ($590,000) for LTHHCPs
 located within the upstate region.
  For each regional group reduction, if the 1996 reduction factor  shall
 be zero, there shall be no 1996 state share reduction amount.
  (b)  For  1997,  1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007,
 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018,  2019,
 2020,  2021,  2022  [and],  2023,  2024,  2025,  2026 AND 2027, for each
 regional group, the reduction factor for the respective  year  shall  be
 multiplied  by  the following amounts to determine each regional group's
 applicable state share reduction amount for such respective year:
  (i) two million three hundred ninety thousand dollars ($2,390,000) for
 CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii) seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) for CHHAs located
 within the upstate region;

 for LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv)  five  hundred  ninety  thousand  dollars  ($590,000) for LTHHCPs
 located within the upstate region.
  For each regional group reduction,  if  the  reduction  factor  for  a
 particular  year  shall be zero, there shall be no state share reduction
 amount for such year.
  (c) For each regional group, the 1999 reduction factor shall be multi-
 plied by the following amounts to determine each regional group's appli-
 cable 1999 state share reduction amount:
  (i) one million seven hundred ninety-two thousand five hundred dollars
 ($1,792,500) for CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii) five hundred sixty-two thousand five hundred  dollars  ($562,500)
 for CHHAs located within the upstate region;
  (iii)  nine hundred fifty-two thousand five hundred dollars ($952,500)
 for LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv) four hundred forty-two thousand five hundred  dollars  ($442,500)
 for LTHHCPs located within the upstate region.
  For  each regional group reduction, if the 1999 reduction factor shall
 be zero, there shall be no 1999 state share reduction amount.
  7. (a) For each regional group, the 1996 state share reduction  amount
 shall be allocated by the commissioner of health among CHHAs and LTHHCPs
 on  the  basis  of  the  extent  of  each CHHA's and LTHHCP's failure to
 achieve the 1996 target medicaid revenue  percentage,  calculated  on  a
 provider  specific  basis utilizing revenues for this purpose, expressed
 as a proportion of the total of each  CHHA's  and  LTHHCP's  failure  to
 S. 4007--B  16
 
 achieve  the 1996 target medicaid revenue percentage within the applica-
 ble regional group. This proportion shall be multiplied by the  applica-
 ble  1996 state share reduction amount calculation pursuant to paragraph
 (a)  of  subdivision  6 of this section. This amount shall be called the
 1996 provider specific state share reduction amount.
  (b) For 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003,  2004,  2005,  2006,

 regional group, the state share reduction amount for the respective year
 shall be allocated by the commissioner of health among CHHAs and LTHHCPs
 on  the  basis  of  the  extent  of  each CHHA's and LTHHCP's failure to
 achieve the target medicaid revenue percentage for the applicable  year,
 calculated  on  a  provider  specific  basis utilizing revenues for this
 purpose, expressed as a proportion of  the  total  of  each  CHHA's  and
 LTHHCP's  failure  to achieve the target medicaid revenue percentage for
 the applicable year within the applicable regional group.  This  propor-
 tion  shall be multiplied by the applicable year's state share reduction
 amount calculation pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision 6  of
 this  section.  This  amount shall be called the provider specific state
 share reduction amount for the applicable year.
  8. (a) The 1996 provider specific state share reduction  amount  shall
 be due to the state from each CHHA and LTHHCP and may be recouped by the
 state  by  March  31, 1997 in a lump sum amount or amounts from payments

 pursuant to title 11 of article 5 of the social services law.
  9.  CHHAs  and  LTHHCPs shall submit such data and information at such
 times as the commissioner of health may require  for  purposes  of  this
 section.  The  commissioner of health may use data available from third-

 of health shall calculate for the period August 1,  1996  through  March
 31,  1997  a  medicaid  revenue  percentage, a reduction factor, a state
 share reduction amount, and a provider specific  state  share  reduction
 amount  in  accordance with the methodology provided in paragraph (a) of
 subdivision 2, paragraph (a) of subdivision 5, paragraph (a) of subdivi-
 sion 6 and paragraph (a) of subdivision 7 of this section. The  provider

 reduction amount calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of subdivi-
 sion 7 of this section. Any amount in excess of the amount determined in
 accordance with paragraph (a) of subdivision 7 of this section shall  be
 due  to  the  state  from  each  CHHA  and LTHHCP and may be recouped in
 accordance with paragraph (a) of subdivision 8 of this section.  If  the
 amount  is  less than the amount determined in accordance with paragraph
 (a) of subdivision 7 of this section, the difference shall  be  refunded
 to  the  CHHA and LTHHCP by the state no later than July 15, 1997. CHHAs

 of this section to be allocated regionally with two-thirds of the avail-
 able funding going to New York city and one-third of the available fund-
 ing going to the rest of the state and shall be available  for  distrib-
 ution as follows:
  Distributions  shall  first  be made to consortia and teaching general
 hospitals for the empire clinical research investigator program  (ECRIP)
 to  help  secure federal funding for biomedical research, train clinical
 researchers, recruit national leaders as faculty to act as mentors,  and
 train  residents  and  fellows  in  biomedical  research skills based on
 hospital-specific data submitted to the commissioner  by  consortia  and
 teaching general hospitals in accordance with clause (G) of this subpar-
 agraph.  Such distributions shall be made in accordance with the follow-
 ing methodology:
  (A) The greatest number of clinical research  positions  for  which  a
 consortium  or  teaching general hospital may be funded pursuant to this
 subparagraph shall be one percent  of  the  total  number  of  residents
 training  at  the consortium or teaching general hospital on July first,
 two thousand eight for the  period  January  first,  two  thousand  nine
 through December thirty-first, two thousand nine rounded up to the near-
 est one position.
  (B)  Distributions  made  to a consortium or teaching general hospital
 shall equal the product of the total number of clinical  research  posi-
 tions  submitted  by  a  consortium  or  teaching  general  hospital and
 accepted by the commissioner as meeting the criteria set forth in  para-
 graph  (b)  of subdivision one of this section, subject to the reduction
 calculation set forth in clause (C)  of  this  subparagraph,  times  one
 hundred ten thousand dollars.
  (C)  If  the  dollar  amount for the total number of clinical research
 positions in the region  calculated  pursuant  to  clause  (B)  of  this
 subparagraph  exceeds the total amount appropriated for purposes of this
 paragraph, including clinical research positions that continue from  and
 were funded in prior distribution periods, the commissioner shall elimi-
 nate  one-half  of  the  clinical  research  positions submitted by each
 consortium or teaching general hospital rounded down to the nearest  one
 position.  Such  reduction shall be repeated until the dollar amount for
 the total number of clinical research positions in the region  does  not
 exceed  the total amount appropriated for purposes of this paragraph. If
 the repeated reduction of the total number of  clinical  research  posi-
 tions  in  the region by one-half does not render a total funding amount
 that is equal to or less than the total amount reserved for that  region
 within  the  appropriation, the funding for each clinical research posi-
 tion in that region shall be  reduced  proportionally  in  one  thousand
 dollar  increments until the total dollar amount for the total number of
 clinical research positions in that region does  not  exceed  the  total
 amount  reserved for that region within the appropriation. Any reduction
 in funding will be effective for the duration of the award. No  clinical
 research  positions that continue from and were funded in prior distrib-
 ution periods shall be eliminated or reduced by such methodology.

  § 4. Section 40 of chapter 266 of the laws of 1986, amending the civil
 practice law and rules  and  other  laws  relating  to  malpractice  and
 professional medical conduct, as amended by section 4 of part Z of chap-
 ter 57 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  §  40.  The superintendent of financial services shall establish rates
 for policies providing coverage  for  physicians  and  surgeons  medical
 malpractice  for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June 30,
 [2023] 2024; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
 of law, the superintendent shall not establish or approve  any  increase
 in  rates  for  the  period  commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
 2010. The superintendent shall direct insurers to  establish  segregated
 accounts  for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income attrib-
 utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
 insurers regarding claims and expenses attributable to such  periods  to
 monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
 and  expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall impose
 a surcharge on premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected  deficiency  that  is
 attributable  to the premium levels established pursuant to this section
 for such periods; provided, however, that such  annual  surcharge  shall
 not  exceed  eight  percent of the established rate until July 1, [2023]
 2024, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
 ty-five percent of the approved adequate  rate,  and  that  such  annual
 surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
 to  satisfy  such  deficiency.  The superintendent shall not impose such
 surcharge during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June  30,
 2010.  On  and  after  July  1,  1989,  the surcharge prescribed by this
 section shall be retained by insurers to the extent  that  they  insured
 physicians  and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30, [2023]
 2024 policy periods; in the event  and  to  the  extent  physicians  and
 surgeons  were  insured by another insurer during such periods, all or a
 pro rata share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall  be  remitted
 to  such  other  insurer  in accordance with rules and regulations to be
 promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
 and surgeons who were not insured during such policy  periods  shall  be
 apportioned  among  all insurers in proportion to the premium written by
 each insurer during such policy periods; if a physician or  surgeon  was
 insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
 during  such  policy  periods,  and  at  any time thereafter a hospital,
 health maintenance organization, employer or institution is  responsible
 S. 4007--B  102

 for  responding in damages for liability arising out of such physician's
 or surgeon's practice of medicine, such responsible  entity  shall  also
 remit  to  such  prior  insurer the equivalent amount that would then be
 collected  as  a  surcharge if the physician or surgeon had continued to
 remain insured by such prior insurer. In  the  event  any  insurer  that
 provided  coverage  during  such  policy  periods is in liquidation, the
 property/casualty insurance security fund shall receive the  portion  of
 surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
 The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
 the  purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The superintendent,
 in establishing adequate rates and in determining  any  projected  defi-
 ciency  pursuant  to  the requirements of this section and the insurance
 law, shall give substantial weight, determined  in  his  discretion  and
 judgment,  to  the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of any regulations
 promulgated and laws enacted and the  public  benefit  of  stabilizing
 malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
 od  of  time  necessary for the development of more reliable statistical
 experience as to the efficacy of such  laws  and  regulations  affecting
 medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
 1986,  by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any provision
 of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
 the superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if  such
 rates  would be adequate when taken together with the maximum authorized
 annual surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time  whether
 or  not  any  such  annual surcharge has been actually imposed as of the
 establishment of such rates.
  § 5. Section 5 and subdivisions (a) and (e) of section 6 of part J  of
 chapter  63  of  the  laws  of 2001, amending chapter 266 of the laws of
 1986, amending the civil practice law and rules and other laws  relating
 to malpractice and professional medical conduct, as amended by section 5
 of  part  Z  of  chapter  57 of the laws of 2022, are amended to read as

  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 12 of section 203 of the elder
 law,  as added by section 1 of part U of chapter 57 of the laws of 2019,
 is amended to read as follows:
  (a) The director is hereby authorized to implement private pay  proto-
 cols  for programs and services administered by the office. These proto-
 cols may be implemented by area agencies on aging at  their  option  and
 such  protocols  shall not be applied to services for a participant when
 being paid for with federal funds or funds designated as federal  match,
 or  for  individuals  with  an income below [four] TWO hundred AND FIFTY
 percent of the federal poverty  level.  All  private  payments  received
 directly by an area agency on aging or indirectly by one of its contrac-
 tors shall be used to supplement, not supplant, funds by state, federal,
 or  county  appropriations.  Such private pay payments shall be set at a
 cost to the participant of not more than twenty percent above either the
 unit cost to the area agency on aging to provide the program or  service
 directly,  or  the  amount  that  the  area  agency on aging pays to its
 contractor to provide the  program  or  service.  Private  pay  payments
 received  under  this  subdivision  shall  be used by the area agency on
 aging to first reduce any unmet need for programs and services, and then
 to support and enhance services or programs provided by the area  agency
 on aging. No participant, regardless of income, shall be required to pay
 for  any  program  or  service that they are receiving at the time these
 protocols are implemented by the area agency on aging. This  subdivision
 shall not prevent cost sharing for the programs and services established
 pursuant  to section two hundred fourteen of this title [for individuals
 below four hundred percent of the  federal  poverty  level].  Consistent
 with  federal and state statute and regulations, when providing programs
 and services, area agencies on aging and their contractors shall contin-
 ue to give priority for programs and services to  individuals  with  the
 greatest  economic  or  social  needs. In the event that the capacity to
 provide programs and services is limited,  such  programs  and  services
 shall  be  provided to individuals with incomes below [four] TWO hundred
 AND FIFTY percent of the federal poverty level before such programs  and
 services are provided to those participating in the private pay protocol
 pursuant to this subdivision.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

 consumer credit transaction, if the plaintiff is not the original credi-
 tor, the applicant shall include: (1) an affidavit by the original cred-

 the notice required by subdivision (g) of this section,  where  applica-
 ble, shall also be filed.
  (j)  Affidavit. A request for a default judgment entered by the clerk,
 must be accompanied by an affidavit  by  the  plaintiff  or  plaintiff's
 attorney  stating that after reasonable inquiry, he or she has reason to

 prescription drugs in this state. The impact of ever rising prescription
 drug  costs impacts consumers in this state both at the pharmacy counter

 cies, pharmacy benefit managers, hospitals, employers, and unions.

 S. 4007--B  164
 
 financial  impairment  or  insolvency.  The superintendent of financial
 services has the right and responsibility to enforce the  insurance  law
 and the authority to seek redress against any person responsible for the
 impairment  or  insolvency  of  the  insurer, and nothing in this act is
 intended to restrict or limit such right, responsibility, or authority.

 ment to carry out the purposes of this article.

  PART LL
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and  intent. The legislature finds
 that:
  a. According to a 2020 report by the Women's Media  Center  there  are
 64,000-75,000 missing black women and girls across the United States.
  b.  Cases  involving  black  women  and girls often do not receive the
 attention they need and there are often barriers to families reporting a
 loved one, such as mistrust of police, and racial disparities in how law
 enforcement treat disappearances.
  c. The tens of thousands of black women  and  girls  who  are  missing
 include  abductees,  sex  trafficking victims, and runaways. Black women
 and girls exist at the intersection of racism and sexism, and often face
 worse health, wealth, housing, education, and employment outcomes.
  d. Black girls comprise over 40% of domestic sex  trafficking  victims
 in the United States.
  e.  Law  enforcement  often categorize missing black girls as runaways
 and fail to treat their cases with urgency.
  f. According to a 2020 report by the  Sovereign  Bodies  Institute,  a
 nonprofit,  indigenous-led research organization, at least 2,306 missing
 Native American women and girls have gone missing in the last  40  years
 in the United States, about 1,800 of whom were killed or vanished.
  g.  Systemic  vulnerability and compounding suppressions have resulted
 in mass amounts of disappeared indigenous  peoples,  with  the  National
 Congress  of American Indians finding that an estimated 40% of women who
 are victims of sex  trafficking  identify  as  American  Indian,  Alaska
 Native, or First Nations.
  h.  Families  of Native American women and girls who have gone missing
 report a lack of cultural awareness, systemic  racism  and  sexism,  and
 widespread  apathy by law enforcement and express frustration that their
 cases are not pursued.
  i. There is not comprehensive state or federal data about missing  and
 murdered  Native  Americans.  Advocates  argue that poor record keeping,
 racial misclassification, adverse relationships between  tribal  govern-
 ments  and  outside  law  enforcement  have  led to an underreporting of
 cases.
  § 2. a. There is hereby established a task force on missing women  and
 girls  who  are black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC). Such task
 force shall be composed of the commissioner of the office of family  and
 children's  services,  the  commissioner  of  the  division  of criminal
 justice services, the superintendent of state police, or  the  designees
 of  such  commissioners  and superintendent. Additional members shall be
 appointed as follows, two shall be appointed by the temporary  president
 of  the  senate,  two shall be appointed by the speaker of the assembly,
 one shall be appointed by the minority leader of  the  senate,  and  one
 shall be appointed by the minority leader of the assembly. Members shall
 be representative of the communities experiencing this crisis, including
 directly  impacted individuals, reflect the diversity of New York state,
 and have experience in cultural competency.
  b. Task force members shall receive no compensation for their services
 but shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary  expenses  incurred  in
 the performance of their duties.
 S. 4007--B  197
 
  c. The task force shall:
  (i)  develop policy changes that will work to address the lack of care
 and concern for missing and murdered BIPOC women and girls with New York
 state governmental agencies, including identifying  policies  to  ensure
 first responders are culturally competent;
  (ii)  advance  the  knowledge  of communities on the severity of BIPOC
 women and girls who are missing and murdered;
  (iii) ensure  BIPOC  communities  are  educated  and  trained  on  the
 prevention,  protection,  and  protocols relating to missing BIPOC women
 and girls as it relates to social media;
  (iv) develop a strategy to collect statistics, demographics,  surveys,
 oral histories, and data analysis;
  (v)  recommend  preventive programming and ideas to advance the safety
 of women and girls, including  policies  that  address  the  overlapping
 forms of oppression faced by BIPOC women and girls;
  (vi)  identify  major  traffic hubs, highways, and resource extraction
 sites that lead to or are responsible for the facilitation of the abduc-
 tion of BIPOC women and girls; and
  (vii) create a state-wide awareness campaign.
  d. In carrying out the duties of the task force, such task force shall
 seek public input by holding public hearings in each region of the state
 and accepting public input in writing.
  e. On or before two years after the effective date of  this  act,  the
 task  force  shall  submit to the temporary president of the senate, the
 speaker of the assembly, the minority  leader  of  the  senate  and  the
 minority  leader  of  the  assembly a report containing its findings and
 recommendations. Such reports shall be made available to the public.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall
 have  become  a  law and shall expire and be deemed repealed three years
 after such date.

  PART MM

 HEALTH  CARE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS ADMITTED FOR A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER,
 PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES SHALL

 INCLUDES THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS.  HEALTH
 CARE SERVICES SHALL BE PROVIDED BY  A  HEALTH  CARE  PROFESSIONAL  WHOSE
 SCOPE  OF  PRACTICE  INCLUDES DIAGNOSING AND TREATING HUMAN RESPONSES TO
 ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE OFFICE SHALL CONSULT  WITH  THE

 APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF SUCH  AGENCIES  ARE  COMPLIED  WITH.
 NOTHING  IN  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  PRECLUDE THESE FACILITIES FROM TRANS-
 FERRING A PERSON TO A DIFFERENT  FACILITY  IN  THE  EVENT  THE  PERSON'S
 MENTAL  HEALTH  OR  HEALTH CARE NEEDS ARE DEEMED TO EXCEED THE TREATMENT
 CAPACITY OF SUCH FACILITY.

  Section  1. Clause (vi) of subparagraph 1 of paragraph (e) of subdivi-
 sion 5 of section 366 of the social services law, as amended by  section
 13  of  part MM of chapter 56 of the laws of 2020, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (vi) "look-back  period"  means  the  sixty-month  period  immediately
 preceding the date that an institutionalized individual is both institu-
 tionalized  and  has applied for medical assistance, or in the case of a
 non-institutionalized  individual,  subject  to  federal  approval,  FOR
 TRANSFERS MADE ON OR AFTER OCTOBER FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY, the thir-
 ty-month  period  immediately  preceding the date that such non-institu-
 tionalized individual applies for medical assistance  coverage  of  long
 term care services. Nothing herein precludes a review of eligibility for
 retroactive authorization for medical expenses incurred during the three

  §  2.  Clauses  (iii)  and  (iv) of subparagraph 4 of paragraph (e) of
 subdivision 5 of section 366 of the social services  law,  as  added  by
 section  26-a  of part C of chapter 109 of the laws of 2006, are amended

  (iii) a satisfactory showing is made that: (A) the individual  or  the

 market value, or for other valuable consideration;  or  (B)  the  assets
 were  transferred  exclusively  for  a purpose other than to qualify for

 S. 4007--B  200
 
  (iv) denial of eligibility would cause an undue  hardship,  such  that
 application  of the transfer of assets provision would deprive the indi-
 vidual of medical care such that the individual's health or  life  would
 be  endangered, or would deprive the individual of food, clothing, shel-
 ter,  or  other  necessities  of  life. The commissioner of health shall
 develop a hardship waiver process which shall include a  timely  process

 is an institutionalized individual, the facility in which he or  she  is
 residing shall be permitted to file an undue hardship waiver application
 on  behalf  of such individual with the consent of the individual or the
 personal representative of the individual[.]; OR
  (V) THE TRANSFER WAS TO A FAMILY MEMBER OR INFORMAL  CAREGIVER  BEFORE

 FOR MEDICAID FOR NON-INSTITUTIONAL LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES, AND ALL  THE
 FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET:

 ter 109 of the laws of 2006, is amended to read as follows:
  (5) Any transfer made by an  individual  or  the  individual's  spouse
 under  subparagraph three of this paragraph shall cause the person to be
 ineligible for services for a period  equal  to  the  total,  cumulative
 uncompensated  value of all assets transferred during or after the look-
 back period, divided by the average monthly costs  of  nursing  facility
 services provided to a private patient for a given period of time at the
 time  of  application,  as determined pursuant to the regulations of the
 department. For purposes of this subparagraph, the average monthly costs
 of nursing facility services to a private patient for a given period  of
 time  at  the  time  of  application shall be presumed to be one hundred
 twenty percent of the average medical assistance rate of payment  as  of

 approved  application  for  such care but for the provisions of subpara-
 graph three of this paragraph, whichever is later, and  which  does  not
 occur  in  any  other  periods of ineligibility under this paragraph, OR
 (II) FOR NON-INSTITUTIONALIZED INDIVIDUALS, THE FIRST DAY THE  OTHERWISE
 ELIGIBLE  INDIVIDUAL  IS  FUNCTIONALLY  ELIGIBLE  FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH
 MEDICAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE AVAILABLE BASED ON AN  APPROVED  APPLICATION
 FOR SUCH CARE BUT FOR THE PROVISIONS OF SUBPARAGRAPH THREE OF THIS PARA-
 S. 4007--B  201
 
 GRAPH, WHICHEVER IS LATER, AND WHICH DOES NOT OCCUR IN ANY OTHER PERIODS

  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
 
  PART BBB
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "reproductive freedom and equity grant program".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds:
  1.  Abortion  is  essential  health  care  and integral to the overall
 health and wellbeing of individuals.
  2. In 1970, New York legalized abortion,  three  years  prior  to  the
 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which enumerated a constitutional
 right to abortion care.
  3.  On  January  22,  2019,  the 46th anniversary of the Supreme Court
 decision Roe v. Wade, New York modernized our state law to be consistent
 with the holdings of Roe v. Wade, articulating in that every  individual
 has a fundamental right to abortion.
  4.  Despite  a state right to abortion care, barriers exist that chal-
 lenge an individual's ability to exercise their right to care.
  5. Individuals seeking abortion care can often experience obstacles to
 obtaining an abortion, whether that is an inability to afford  the  cost
 of  care, the distance one must travel, the costs associated with travel
 including transportation needs, childcare, lodging, lost wages and more.
  6. Barriers to  care  are  often  intensified  for  immigrants,  young
 people, people with disabilities and those living in rural areas.
  7.  The United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24,
 2022, significantly impacting access to  care  across  the  country  for
 millions.
  8.  It  is estimated that in the wake of state bans on abortion across
 the country, New York would be the nearest provider of care for  190,000
 to 280,000 more women of reproductive age.
 S. 4007--B  217
 
  9.  Abortion  funds,  abortion  providers,  and  other community-based
 organizations have provided  essential  support  to  individuals  facing
 practical  support  needs.  These  entities  assist  individuals seeking
 abortion care including those living in New York, those traveling to New
 York and those who must travel outside of New York for care.
  10. With no direct and sustained state investment, safety-net abortion
 providers  and abortion funds predominately rely on philanthropic giving
 to address unmet needs of abortion patients, challenging  their  ability
 to meet present need, or any future increase demand for care.
  11.  New York has a proud legacy of protecting and expanding access to
 comprehensive reproductive and sexual health  care  services,  including
 abortion.
  12.  In  furtherance of that legacy, it is incumbent upon the state to
 adopt bold and innovative programs and policies that protect and advance
 reproductive freedom.
  § 3. Article 25-A of the public health law is amended by adding a  new
 section 2599-bb-1 to read as follows:

  3.  THE  COMMISSIONER IS AUTHORIZED TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE

 ble health and long term care services on a fee-for-service basis in the
 geographic  region  in  which such services are proposed to be provided.
 Payment rates shall be risk-adjusted to take into account the character-
 istics of enrollees, or proposed enrollees, including, but  not  limited
 to:  frailty,  disability  level,  health  and functional status, age,
 gender, the nature of services provided to  such  enrollees,  and  other
 factors  as  determined  by the commissioner. The risk adjusted premiums
 may also be combined with  disincentives  or  requirements  designed  to
 mitigate  any incentives to obtain higher payment categories. In setting
 S. 4007--B  223
 
 such payment rates, the commissioner shall consider costs borne  by  the
 managed  care  program to ensure actuarially sound and adequate rates of
 payment to ensure quality of care shall comply with all applicable  laws
 and regulations, state and federal, including regulations as to actuari-
 al  soundness  for medicaid managed care. IN SETTING SUCH REIMBURSEMENT,
 THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH A QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR MANAGED
 LONG TERM CARE PLANS THAT SHALL BE  DISTRIBUTED  BASED  ON  SUCH  PLANS'
 PERFORMANCE  IN  MEETING  QUALITY  OBJECTIVES, WHICH SHALL BE SET BY THE
