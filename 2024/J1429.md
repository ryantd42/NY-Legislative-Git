BY: Senator KENNEDY
 
  COMMENDING  Marcus Burley upon the occasion of his
  designation as a recipient of a Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Marcus Burley upon the occasion of his designation as  recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the evening of August 28, 2023, a Feel Rite Fresh Market
employee and Buffalo native, Marcus Burley, was in the  grocery  store's
backroom, when a female coworker was having lunch in the room; suddenly,
the  woman  began  to  have  a  coughing  fit  and  he  began to ask her
repeatedly if she was okay, and she answered yes, when she evidently was
struggling to breathe; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the individual in danger  started  to  tear  up,  Marcus
Burley  reacted  quickly  and began to perform the Heimlich maneuver; he
performed multiple attempts, and on the third try of the Heimlich  being
performed  by  Marcus Burley, the female coworker was finally freed from
the life-threatening situation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The incident spanning no more than 10 to  15  minutes,  the
act  of  selflessness  and bravery from Marcus Burley has resulted in an
increased camaraderie among the Feel Rite employees; and
 
  WHEREAS, Justly recognized as a hero, Marcus  Burley  richly  merits
the  admiration  of  this  Legislative  Body  and  his community for his
consummate, swift action in rushing to the life-saving aid of his fellow
co-worker; and
 
  WHEREAS, Moreover, Marcus Burley should be  meritoriously  commended
for remaining calm under pressure and for showing valor and true courage
while performing a lifesaving deed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Marcus  Burley,  in his spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated his character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without thought of danger or reward when others need help; now,
therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Marcus  Burley  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as  a
recipient  of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed upon an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Marcus Burley.
