  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 17, 2024, as Bike to Work Day in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness  of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 17, 2024, as Bike to
Work Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Bike Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, May is National Bike Month,  sponsored  by  the  League  of
American Bicyclists and celebrated in communities coast to coast; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  1956,  National Bike Month is a chance to
showcase the many benefits of bicycling and to encourage more people  to
give it a try; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Bike Month includes an ever-expanding diversity of
events  in  communities  nationwide  but the biggest day of the month is
Bike to Work Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, The mission of National Bike Month is to support a safe and
healthy  transportation  alternative  that  is  paramount  to  achieving
sustainability and enhancing the quality of life in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For more than a century, the bicycle has been an important
part of the lives of most Americans; today, millions of Americans engage
in bicycling as an environmentally  sound  form  of  transportation,  an
excellent form of fitness, and quality family recreation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Biking is an efficient and fun way to get the exercise you
need, without having to find extra time to work out; and
 
  WHEREAS, Biking is green; it reduces your carbon footprint,  reduces
traffic congestion and can save you money; when bicycling is substituted
for  short auto trips, 3.6 pounds of pollutants per mile are not emitted
into the atmosphere, and 10 bikes can park in the space used by a single
motor vehicle; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than half of our nation's population lives within five
miles of their workplace, making bicycling a feasible and fun way to get
to work; with increased interest in healthy,  sustainable  and  economic
transportation  options,  it  is not surprising that, from 2000 to 2013,
the number of bicycle commuters in the United States grew by  more  than
62%; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Among the 51 largest U.S. cities, 43 host Bike to Work Day
events; many people who participate in Bike to Work  Day  as  first-time
commuters, become regular bike commuters; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Biking  is  healthy; active employees are more alert, take
fewer sick days, and are more productive; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bicycle commuters get to work on time more  often  and  are
happier  and  more  productive;  80% of people who switch from sedentary
commuting to cycling  improve  their  heart,  lungs  and  blood  vessels
greatly in 6-8 weeks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, over 66% of the adult United States population
is  overweight  and  32%  of  our  nation  is obese, costing America $68
billion in health care and personal costs annually; and
 
  WHEREAS, Medical research has proven that a minimum of 30 minutes of
moderate physical activity three days a week can reduce the incidence of
heart disease, obesity, diabetes and  hypertension  and  improve  mental
health and cardio-vascular fitness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Biking is fun and biking to work builds morale, encourages
camaraderie, and is a great way to get active in your community; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is essential that there be greater public  awareness  of
the  benefits  to  bicycling,  and  all New Yorkers are urged to bike to
work, or try cycling for fun, for fitness, even for transportation; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 17, 2024, as Bike to
Work Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
