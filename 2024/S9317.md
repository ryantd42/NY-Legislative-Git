 and parts of bears, and the intentional and incidental feeding of bears.
 Such regulations shall implement the provisions of  this  article.  Such
 regulations,  as  the  department  deems  appropriate,  may  provide for
 special  permits  and  permit quotas. When a special permit is required,
 the department may fix by regulation a fee for each such permit issued.
  a. Until December thirty-first, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SEV-
 EN, whenever in its opinion deer shall become  numerous  enough  in  any
 area  to  cause  substantial  damage to property or overbrowsing of deer
 range, the department may fix by regulation  special  open  seasons  for
 taking wild deer of either sex. Subject to this subdivision, the depart-
 ment may fix the conditions of such seasons.
  10.  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent provision of subdivision 10 of
 section 11-0901 or subdivision 2, subdivision  3  or  subdivision  8  of
 section 11-0907 of this title, until December thirty-first, two thousand
 [twenty-four]  TWENTY-SEVEN, the department is authorized to adopt regu-

 state  except  in  the  northern zone is such that additional harvest of
 deer is reasonably necessary to properly manage the  deer  herd  in  the
 state  in balance with the available deer range and natural food supply,
 the department may provide by regulation for issuance of deer management
 permits, permitting the taking of one deer for the permit,  in  addition
 to  the limit of one deer that may otherwise be taken by one person in a
 license year.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
