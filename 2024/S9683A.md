 finds  that  granting  the  trustees of the state university of New York
 ("Trustees") the authority and power to lease and otherwise contract  to
 make  available  grounds  and  facilities  of  Stony Brook's campus will
 ensure such land is  utilized  for  the  benefit  of  Stony  Brook,  the
 surrounding community, and the general public.
  §  2.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the trustees are
 authorized and empowered, without  any  public  bidding,  to  lease  and

 developing, constructing, maintaining and operating multi-purpose facil-
 ities to support housing needs and supporting amenities. Such  lease  or
 contract  shall  be for a period not exceeding ninety-nine years without
 any fee simple conveyance and otherwise upon terms and conditions deter-
 mined by such trustees, subject to the approval of the director  of  the
 division  of the budget, the attorney general and the state comptroller.
 In the event that the real property that is the subject of such lease or
 contract shall cease to be used for the purpose described in  this  act,
