 AN  ACT  authorizing  Vineyard  Christian Fellowship South Shore Inc. to
  file with the county of Nassau assessor an application for a  retroac-
  tive real property tax exemption

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Vineyard Christian  Fellowship  South  Shore  Inc.  an  application  for
 exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real
 property tax law for the 2020-2021 assessment roll for all the 2020-2021
 school  taxes  and all the 2021 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to
 such organization located at 142 Franklin Ave, town of Hempstead, county
 of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county parcel ID section  37  block
 205 lot 335. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it had
 been  received on or before the taxable status date established for such
 roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  County  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
