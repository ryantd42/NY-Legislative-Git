 AN  ACT  to  amend the public service law, in relation to requiring that
  renewable energy systems projects use materials produced in the United
  States
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 4 of section 66-r of the public service law, as
 added  by  section  2-a of part AA of chapter 56 of the laws of 2021, is
 amended to read as follows:
  4.(a) Any public entity, in each  contract  for  construction,  recon-
 struction,  alteration,  repair, improvement or maintenance of a covered
 renewable energy system which involves the procurement  of  a  renewable
 energy  credits agreement by a public entity, or a third party acting on
 behalf and for the benefit of a public entity, the "public work" for the
 purposes of this subdivision, shall  ensure  that  such  contract  shall
 contain  a provision that [the iron and structural steel] ALL MATERIALS,
 INCLUDING RAW MATERIALS, used or supplied  in  the  performance  of  the
 contract  or  any  subcontract thereto [and that is permanently incorpo-
 rated into the public work,] shall be  produced  or  made  in  whole  or
 substantial  part  in the United States, its territories or possessions.
 In the case of a structural iron or structural  steel  product  USED  OR
 SUPPLIED  IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT OR ANY SUBCONTRACT THERETO,
 all manufacturing must take place in the United States, from the initial
 melting stage through the application of coatings, except  metallurgical
 processes involving the refinement of steel additives. [For the purposes
 of  this  subdivision,  "permanently incorporated" shall mean an iron or
 steel product that is required to remain in place  at  the  end  of  the
 project  contract,  in  a  fixed location, affixed to the public work to
 which it was incorporated. Iron and steel products that are  capable  of
 being  moved  from  one location to another are not permanently incorpo-
 rated into a public work.]
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  (b) The provisions of paragraph (a)  of  this  subdivision  shall  not
 apply  if  the  head of the department or agency constructing the public
 works, in his or her sole discretion,  determines  that  the  provisions
 would not be in the public interest, would result in unreasonable costs,
 or that obtaining such [steel or iron] NECESSARY MATERIALS in the United
 States  would  increase  the  cost  of  the  contract by an unreasonable
 amount, or such [iron or steel, including without limitation  structural
 iron  and  structural  steel]  NECESSARY MATERIALS cannot be produced or
 made in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quanti-
 ties and of satisfactory quality. The head of the department  or  agency
 constructing  the  public  works  shall include this determination in an
 advertisement or solicitation of a request for proposal, invitation  for
 bid,  or  solicitation  of proposal, or any other method provided for by
 law or regulation for soliciting a response from offerors  intending  to
 result  in  a  contract pursuant to this subdivision.  The provisions of
 paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall not apply for equipment OR MATE-
 RIALS purchased by a covered renewable energy system prior to the effec-
 tive date of this [chapter] SECTION.
  (c) The head of the department or agency constructing the public works
 may, at his or her sole discretion, provide  for  a  solicitation  of  a
 request  for  proposal, invitation for bid, or solicitation of proposal,
 or any other method provided for by law or regulation for  soliciting  a
 response  from  offerors  intending  to result in a contract pursuant to
 this paragraph involving a competitive process in which  the  evaluation
 of  competing  bids  gives  significant  consideration in the evaluation
 process to the procurement of equipment  and  supplies  from  businesses
 located in New York state.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
