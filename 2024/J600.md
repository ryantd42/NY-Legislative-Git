Senate Resolution No. 600
 
BY: Senator KENNEDY
 
  COMMENDING  Bikers  Against Child Abuse (BACA) for
  their steadfast dedication to the health and welfare
  of our young people
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Bikers Against Child Abuse (BACA) for their steadfast dedication
to the health and welfare of our young people; and
 
  WHEREAS, BACA was founded by a licensed clinical social  worker  and
registered  play  therapist  to address the fear and subsequent behavior
reactions of abused children through his love for motorcycles; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  mental  health  professional  was  confronted  with  a
particularly  difficult case involving an eight-year-old boy who refused
to leave his house due to the fear of his  perpetrator;  he  sought  the
support  of  fellow  bikers  to  volunteer  to  provide  an  empowering
experience for the boy through social support therapy; and
 
  WHEREAS, With permission from the boy's  guardians,  27  motorcycles
and  nearly  40  people  from  clubs,  organizations,  and  solo  riders
responded and rode as one group to the child's  home;  they  dismounted,
greeted  the  child,  and  offered  him a ride on a motorcycle, which he
accepted; within hours of his ride the  boy  was  observed  outside  his
house riding his bicycle on his own; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  idea  led to the formation of BACA on a local level,
which grew regionally; today, BACA has progressed into an  international
organization in 47 states and 18 countries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  BACA  works in conjunction with local agencies and fills a
gap in existing services and agencies and fulfills an unmet need  within
the community; putting into practice the experience of the founder, BACA
is  based upon the finding that positive social support may modulate the
trauma experience by a child through addressing their feelings of  fear,
anxiety, and trust and encouraging a sense of safety, based on a stable,
reliable presence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  BACA  attempts to meet the needs of abused children living
in fear by providing a presence during a crisis, where and  when  needed
24 hours a day, seven days a week through its volunteers; they strive to
always show up and be there; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Buffalo Chapter of BACA was founded in 2014, and serves
Erie, Wyoming, Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties, and is currently led
by President Gonzo who is one of the founding members; members are known
by  their  road names for the protection of the children, as well as the
 
members serving the children; other members  of  the  Buffalo  executive
board  include  Hawk,  Vice  President;  Ironhead,  Secretary;  Pipi,
Treasurer; and Bull, Sergeant at Arms; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown  a
long  and  sustained  commitment to excellence certainly have earned the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend Bikers Against Child Abuse (BACA) for their steadfast dedication
to the health and welfare of our young people; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Gonzo, President, Bikers Against Child Abuse (BACA).
