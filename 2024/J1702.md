  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge
outstanding professionals  in  the  boxing  industry  who  distinguished
themselves  through  their  exceptional  performance,  attaining
unprecedented success and the highest  level  of  personal  achievement;
Michael  "Double  M"  Moorer  is  one  such  individual  and his life of

admiration of the sport of boxing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Michael "Double M" Moorer upon the occasion of his  induction  into  the
International  Boxing Hall of Fame and Museum; he will be honored within
the Modern category of boxers at the 35th Anniversary  celebration  from
June 6-9, 2024, in Canastota, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  in  Brooklyn, New York on November 12, 1967, Michael

grandfather took him to the local gym; and
 
  WHEREAS, Relocating to Detroit, Michael Moorer trained under Emanuel
Steward  at the famous Kronk Gym before achieving professional status in
1988; winning his first 26 contests with knockouts, in his 12th bout  he
captured  the inaugural WBO light heavyweight title with a 5th round TKO
of Ramzi Hassan; and
 
  WHEREAS, Double  M  successfully  defended  the  crown  nine  times,
including  stoppages  over  Frankie  Swindell (TKO 6) and Leslie Stewart

  WHEREAS, Wins over Levi Billups (TKO 3),  Mike  White  (W  10),  and

heavyweight champion in history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Two  years  later,  Michael  Moorer captured the WBA / IBF

Axel Schultz (W 12) in 1996; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After two defenses in matches against Frans Botha (TKO 12)
and Vaughn Bean (W 12), Michael Moorer lost  a  rematch  with  Holyfield

  WHEREAS,  Inactive  for  three  years  following the Holyfield loss,
Michael Moorer returned to the ring  in  2000  and  fought  until  2008;
