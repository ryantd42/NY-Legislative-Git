  COMMEMORATING  the 90th Anniversary of Temple Beth
  Israel
 
  WHEREAS, The quality and character of life  in  New  York  State  is
greatly  enriched  by  its  religious  institutions and the faithful and
generous service of those who devote themselves to endeavors of  family,
faith, and community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend institutions of  such  magnanimous  conduct  and  bearing  which
demonstrate  a  deep and continuing concern for others, and in so doing,
inspire others to do the same; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 90th Anniversary of Temple Beth Israel, to be celebrated
at their annual Gala on Sunday, June 9, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first Jewish congregation in Port Washington, New York,
Temple Beth Israel was incorporated in 1933; and
 
  WHEREAS, Coming from humble beginnings, the Jewish community in Port
Washington was meeting in a small space on the third floor of the Bayles
Building in 1915; in 1928, the group moved to the Plaza Building  before
the incorporation of Temple Beth Israel; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  building  at  138 Bayview Avenue was purchased when the
congregation reached about 30 families and there was a need for a larger
space; in 1960, a new space to hold Temple Beth Israel was purchased and
Percival Goodman, a famed synagogue architect, was hired to  design  the
new Temple; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1983, Temple Beth Israel held 241 families and about 725
people  in their congregation; the Temple went through another expansion
and moved into their  present  sanctuary  in  2000,  with  a  myriad  of
beautiful renovations in the years since; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1985,  Temple  Beth  Israel held a vote and decided to
become Egalitarian; and
 
  WHEREAS, Growing to a vast community of devoted members, Temple Beth
Israel now holds more than 265 families and  about  900  people  of  all
ages; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of Temple Beth Israel are involved in all aspects
of the community, maintaining strong civic and religious values; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the able leadership of Senior Rabbi Michael  Mishkin,
Temple Beth Israel, now stands on the threshold of tomorrow, prepared to
meet  the  challenges  of  the  coming  decades,  while  retaining  that
spiritual resolve which has so characterized its glorious past; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to take  note  of
enduring  religious  institutions  and to bring such institutions to the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 90th Anniversary  of  Temple  Beth  Israel;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Rita Shumsky, Temple Beth Israel.
