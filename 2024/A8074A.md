  Section  1.  Paragraph  i  of  subdivision  7 of section 3602-e of the

 laws of 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  i.  establishes a method for selection of eligible children to receive
 prekindergarten program services on a random selection basis where there
 are more eligible children than can be served in a  given  school  year,
 provided, however, THAT IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THERE ARE MORE ELIGI-
 BLE  CHILDREN THAN CAN BE SERVED IN A GIVEN SCHOOL YEAR THAT SUCH SCHOOL

 ESTABLISH  A  METHOD  FOR  SELECTION  AMONG  SUCH ELIGIBLE CHILDREN ON A
 RANDOM BASIS, AND PROVIDED FURTHER that a school district that  operated
 a  targeted  prekindergarten  program  in  the  base  year  may  use the
 selection process established for such program.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
