  RECOGNIZING  October  21-28,  2023,  as  Black
  Entrepreneurs Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  take  note  of
and  publicly  acknowledge individuals who have distinguished themselves
through their exemplary careers, accomplishments, and  purposeful  lives
of service to their community and their profession; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long- standing traditions, this Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize  October 21-28, 2023, as Black Entrepreneurs Week in the State
of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Black  Entrepreneurs  Week  is  in  recognition  of  Black
business and entrepreneurship which has become one of the most impactful
and economic shifts in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  tradition  of recognition began in 2020, when the Hip
Hop Summit Youth Council (HHSYC), known for their work connecting  youth
in  at-risk  communities  to  life changing opportunities, created Black
Entrepreneurs Day in partnership  with  "The  People's  Shark,"  Daymond
John, the founder and CEO of FUBU ("For Us, By Us") and Co-Star of ABC's
four-time  Emmy  Award  winning show, Shark Tank, who serves as curator;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  HHSYC  worked  with  Daymond  to  harness  the  ambition,
creativity, and social capital found throughout the Hip Hop industry and
used  those  elements  as  a  vehicles  to  showcase  the power of Black
economic might and to inspire and inform future generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Entrepreneurship, financial  literacy,  and  education  are
necessary  tools  to  engage  students  and young adults to ensure their
future success, and  to  avoid  problematic  social  issues  and  cyclic
behavior that have contributed to the "glass ceiling" and other economic
disparities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  witnessing  three  massively  successful  years  of
hosting Black Entrepreneurs Day and the growing effects of outreach  and
empowerment  exhibited, its founders have decided one day was not enough
to do justice to the community of excellence and extended the  event  to
Black Entrepreneurs Week to be held October 21-28, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, This very first Black Entrepreneurs Week coincides with the
50th  Year  of  Hip  Hop and will involve celebrity guests such as Spike
Lee, Killer  Mike,  Shaquille  O'Neal,  Tracee  Ellis  Ross,  and  Venus
Williams  in  Game  Changer  Conversations,  where they will share their
entrepreneurial stories and provide valuable insight and knowledge  into
the world of Black business and social success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  approximately  3.12  million  Black-owned
businesses, generating $206 billion in annual revenue and employing 3.56
million workers, with Black  spending  power  projected  to  reach  $1.8
trillion in 2024; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Closing  the  wealth  gap  through  entrepreneurship  and
financial education is the key to public safety and  helping  the  youth
and  young  adults  of  this  State  and  Nation establish the financial
independence necessary to truly thrive, and will create a foundation and
platform for generations of future Black  business  owners  to  succeed;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize October 21-28, 2023, as Black Entrepreneurs Week in the  State
of New York.
