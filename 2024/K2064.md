  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
honor those distinguished officers who would devote themselves to public
service, demonstrating great courage and diligence in providing for  the
care  and  welfare  of  the citizens of their communities and this great

  WHEREAS, Andrew J. Hettinger immediately responded to the dispatched
call  from Dutchess County 9-1-1, regarding a major gas explosion in the
