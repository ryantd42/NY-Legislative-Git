 AN  ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to enacting the
  "get congestion pricing right act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "get congestion pricing right act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares the importance of  the  New  York  Metropolitan  Transportation
 Authority  (MTA)  and affirms the duty of the legislature to ensure that
 the MTA operates effectively. The MTA  provides  an  essential  service:
 transporting  millions  of New Yorkers on billions of trips each year to
 and from their places of work, worship, and gathering.  The  legislature
 further  finds  that,  as the MTA moves to implement congestion pricing,
 the MTA must also encourage the use of public transit as an  alternative
 by  providing  more frequent, reliable, and affordable service - partic-
 ularly bus service. The legislature finds that  bus  system  investments
 were  at  the core of London's successful congestion pricing implementa-
 tion and declares that New York must follow suit by investing in its own
 bus service prior to the implementation of congestion pricing to  better
 serve riders and attract riders for the long-term.
  §  3.  The  public  authorities law is amended by adding a new section
 1266-n to read as follows:
  § 1266-N. BUS SERVICE FREQUENCY  AND  RELIABILITY  AND  FARE-FREE  BUS
 EXPANSION. 1. THE AUTHORITY SHALL ALLOCATE FORTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN
 STATE FUNDS RECEIVED TO THE AUTHORITY'S BUS SYSTEM TO INCREASE FREQUENCY
 AND RELIABILITY.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
