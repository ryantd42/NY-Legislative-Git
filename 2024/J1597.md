  CONGRATULATING  Gladys  Simmons  Barney  upon  the
  occasion of celebrating her 100th Birthday
 
  WHEREAS, Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and  knowledge
to  the  increasingly  active  roles they play in today's society; their
past contributions and future participation are a  vital  part  of,  and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the custom of this Legislative Body to commemorate
and recognize certain milestones celebrated by citizens  of  this  great
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
congratulate  Gladys  Simmons  Barney  upon  the  occasion  of her 100th
Birthday that was celebrated Wednesday, January 3, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gladys Simmons was born to  Victor  and  Annie  Simmons  in
Government Gate, Pembroke, Bermuda, on January 3, 1924; she is the third
of  12  children, six boys and six girls; she attended Central School in
Pembroke but was unable to continue her education in high school because
her parents could not afford the school's fees; and
 
  WHEREAS, Although her dream to become a nurse seemed implausible  in
an  era  when  Black  women  had limited career options, Gladys Simmons'
mother was determined to help her daughter realize  that  dream  through
assisting  with  household chores and aiding a neighborhood midwife with
deliveries and postnatal  care  which  gave  her  a  foundation  for  an
eventual career in nursing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  teacher  in  Central  School tutored Gladys Simmons and
other students after school to prepare them  for  the  Cambridge  Junior
Certificate  examination;  in  1943,  after passing the examination, she
moved into the Cottage Hospital Nursing Home's dormitory, residing there
until graduating in 1947; she was one of five graduates  that  year  and
one  of  a  substantial number of Black women who trained at the nursing
school between 1936 and 1956; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gladys Simmons was presented with her diploma by Sir  Ralph
Leatham;  this  event  was historic because it was the first time that a
governor had performed that role at the  nursing  home;  the  Government
sent  the  graduates  to  Lincoln  Hospital  in  Bronx, New York, for an
additional year of training; and
 
  WHEREAS, Returning to Bermuda  in  1948,  Gladys  Simmons  became  a
private-duty  nurse, caring for wealthy Bermudians in their homes; being
paid lucratively, she was able to afford trips to New York where she met
her future husband, George Barney, whom she married in 1951; and
 
  WHEREAS, The couple settled  in  Corona,  Queens,  New  York,  later
moving to Cambria Heights where Gladys Simmons Barney has resided for 65
years;  the Barneys were blessed with three sons, George, Jr., Mitchell,
and Anthony; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Gladys Simmons Barney worked at Lincoln Hospital for eight
years and Flushing Medical Center for 28 years; after her  husband  died
at  the  age  of  53,  she  raised  her  family while working full-time,
assisted by her mother who would periodically fly to New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gladys Simmons Barney retired in 1987;  in  2017,  she  was
recognized  for  her contributions to the nursing profession at a dinner
to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Bermuda Nurses Association;  in
Bermuda, she attended the Cup Match and renewed family ties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gladys Simmons Barney, with her zest for life, has inspired
and enhanced the lives of her family and friends; and
 
  WHEREAS, This exceptional centenarian has experienced the incredible
joys  and  sorrows  characteristic  of  and  reserved for those with the
stamina and courage to savor a full life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gladys Simmons Barney  has  enriched  the  lives  of  those
around  her  through  her joyous and sincere love for others and through
the vibrant charm and infinite wisdom which comes only from  a  fullness
of years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of  this Legislative Body to publicly
recognize those who have reached such a  remarkable  age  and  who  have
witnessed  and  celebrated  the  innovations, cultural developments, and
awesome achievements of this country  during  the  last  century,  while
themselves  contributing  to  the  growth  and  excellence of this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  Gladys Simmons Barney upon the occasion of celebrating her
100th Birthday; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Gladys Simmons Barney.
