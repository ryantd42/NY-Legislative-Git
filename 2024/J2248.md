BY: Senator TEDISCO
 
  COMMENDING Amelia Juracka upon the occasion of her
  designation  as  recipient  of  a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend Amelia Juracka upon the occasion of her designation as recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the summer of 2023, twelve-year-old Girl  Scout,  Amelia
Juracka,  of Greenfield Center, New York, attended a family gathering at
a relative's home; some of the  attendees  were  enjoying  the  swimming
pool; and
 
  WHEREAS,  No  one noticed that Amelia Juracka's two-year-old cousin,
Oliver, had fallen into the deep end of the pool; and
 
  WHEREAS, Recalling the lessons on water  safety  she  learned  as  a
camper  at  Hidden  Lake  Girl  Scout Camp, Amelia Juracka realized that
little Oliver was in danger; without hesitation,  she  jumped  into  the
pool  and  swam  to  him,  pulling him out of the water; thankfully, the
toddler was unharmed because of this Girl  Scout's  quick  thinking  and
bravery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For the expediency with which Amelia Juracka acted to save
her cousin, she will be awarded the Girl Scout Medal of Honor on Friday,
May 17,  2024;  in  2023,  only  27  Girl  Scouts  received  this  honor
nationwide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Amelia  Juracka, in her spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated her character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of her action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without thought of danger or reward when others need help; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend Amelia Juracka upon the occasion of her designation as recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Amelia Juracka.
