  CELEBRATING  the  life  of  Eric  Eugene  Garvin,
  devoted humanitarian, attorney, community leader and
  renowned social justice advocate
 
  WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding members of our community who,
through their selfless commitment and dedication, have served to  better
the  quality of life in our community and have had a measurable positive
impact on  the  lives  of  its  residents;  Eric  Garvin  was  one  such
individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  profound  sorrow  and  deep regret that this
Legislative Body records the  passing  of  Eric  Garvin,  affectionately
known  as  Gene,  noting  the  significance  of  his purposeful life and
accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eric Garvin of Staten Island,  New  York,  died  tragically
while traveling abroad in Chile; he was 38 years old; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eric Garvin graduated from Westlake High School in Waldorf,
Maryland  in  2002,  before earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 2006
from Mercer University, where he pledged the Theta Pi Chapter  of  Kappa
Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  the  completion  of  his undergraduate studies, Eric
Garvin continued his education at the University of Maryland Law  School
where,  as  a result of his exceptional debating skills, he was selected
as a distinguished member of the University's Moot Court team; and
 
  WHEREAS, After earning his Law degree in 2010, Eric Garvin began his
illustrious career working for former Councilwoman Debi Rose in New York
City's Community Engagement Unit; he then transitioned to the Office  of
Criminal Justice under former Mayor Bill de Blasio; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  first  assignment  in  the  Mayor's  office,  this
extraordinary man  worked  to  reduce  violent  crime  in  neighborhoods
throughout New York City; while assigned to the Brownsville neighborhood
in  Brooklyn,  New York, he worked tirelessly with local Gang leaders to
bring about peace; and
 
  WHEREAS, A vital part of the  anti-violence  movement  of  New  York
City,  Eric  Garvin  went  on  to  also  become  a  vocal  critic of the
incarcerated individuals' conditions at Rikers Island, where  he  worked
diligently to help prisoners transition back into society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  passion  for  exploring  as  much of the world as
possible, Eric Garvin was constantly on the move, traveling to more than
40 countries; he also enjoyed fishing and photography in his free  time,
and  had  become an avid fisherman, often sending his mom and sister his
ugliest catches via pictures and videos; and
 
  WHEREAS, One of Eric Garvin's proudest moments was the creation  and
patent  of  his  PURE REUP agency, which focuses on entrepreneurship and
education; under his able leadership, the  agency  sought  out  ways  to
 
encourage  young people to pursue their passions, despite being impacted
by racism, violence, poverty, and other forms of social decay; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Inspired  by his beloved parents, Eric Sr. and Anna Marie,
and his sister, Naomi, as well as his grandmothers, Marjorie Garvin  and
Mary  Joseph,  this  truly  remarkable  man  spent  his life helping the
underserved and fought extensively against injustice; his  radiant  soul
and  ceaseless  dedication  to  public  service  has  inspired countless
individuals to uplift and protect others in his name; and
 
  WHEREAS, A young man of potential and promise, Eric Garvin had a big
warm smile that exuded confidence and competence with a  work  ethic  to
match;  the  passion he had for social and criminal justice issues drove
him to fiercely advocate for those whom society often  overlooked,  cast
aside,  ignored,  or  persecuted  because he believed in their intrinsic
value and need for opportunities and second chances; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eric  Garvin  was  loving,  kind,  smart,  articulate,  and
driven;  he  was  a  humble  leader who made a lasting difference in any
arena  he  chose;  it  is  heartbreaking  that  his  bright  light  was
extinguished  by  the  very  cycle  of  violence  he  fought  so hard to
eradicate; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eric Garvin's infinite selflessness  and  benevolence  will
shine  on through his family's vivid and happy memories; his insight and
strength will forever serve as a beacon of love, light and hope  to  the
countless lives he touched; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Armed  with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a sense of
compassion, Eric Garvin leaves behind a legacy which  will  long  endure
the  passage  of  time and will remain as a comforting memory to all who
were privileged to have known and loved such an amazing man; he will  be
deeply  missed and truly merits the grateful tribute of this Legislative
Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
mourn  the  death  of  Eric  Eugene  Garvin,  and to express its deepest
condolences to his family; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of Eric Eugene Garvin.
