  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the
  Franklin Square & Munson Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  commemorate  the
Anniversary of the Franklin Square & Munson Fire Department and to honor
its  past  and  present  firefighting  members  for  100  years  of fire
protection for the citizens  of  Franklin  Square,  New  York,  and  its
surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; firefighters exemplify the  power  of
human compassion and the strength of the American spirit through actions
of  the  most heroic magnitude; their sacrifices and selfless dedication
merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fire companies are an integral part of community protection
services in every locality of our State; during the past 100 years,  the
courageous and devoted firefighters of the Franklin Square & Munson Fire
Department have valiantly responded to all types of fire emergencies and
have won the praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  several  large  fires  devastated  parts  of  the
community, the apparent necessity for fire protection was  acknowledged,
and  the  first fire company, Franklin Hook and Ladder Company No. 1, of
Munson, was organized in 1907; and
 
  WHEREAS, Housed in the town's first firehouse, which  was  built  by
the  company's  members on farmland donated by one of those members, the
fire company was equipped with a horse-drawn cart, ladders, and buckets;
a large bell, donated by an old schoolhouse in the town, was mounted  on
the roof; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When a fire was reported, the bell was rung, signaling all
of the volunteer firefighters who would respond as quickly as  possible,
bringing their horses for the ladder cart; the first member to hitch his
horses to the cart would be given a reward; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the town continued to grow, so did the need for a larger
firefighting  force; in 1923, a group of men founded the Franklin Square
Hose and Chemical Company; a motorized engine was  housed  in  a  second
firehouse in downtown Franklin Square; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1924, the Franklin Square & Munson Fire Department was
established with the merging of the Franklin Hook and Ladder Company No.
1 and the Franklin Square Hose & Chemical Company to form  the  Franklin
Square  &  Munson Fire District, each having its own firehouse; although
both buildings are no longer affiliated with  firefighting,  they  still
exist; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  new  firehouse,  which was designed to house the entire
department, was constructed in 1959; presently, the department  consists
 
of  three  engine  companies, a ladder company, a rescue company, and an
EMS company; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Franklin Square & Munson Fire Department has provided
fire protection in the Franklin Square & Munson Fire District,  covering
a  three-square-mile  area,  serving Franklin Square, Garden City South,
and parts of West Hempstead; approximately 30,000 residents rely on  the
dedicated  and  brave firefighters, who selflessly and tirelessly ensure
the safety and welfare of their neighbors, to respond to their fire  and
medical emergencies which number more than 1,000 calls annually; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  the  decades since its inception, the Franklin
Square & Munson Fire Department has honored its  vision  to  become  the
finest  fire  and  EMS  service  organization  possible by utilizing and
developing its members to their fullest potential, maximizing their  use
of  the  resources available to them, and being responsive to the growth
and changing needs of their community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Important values of  the  Franklin  Square  &  Munson  Fire
Department  have been upheld for 100 years; the firefighters of Franklin
Square give human life top priority and regard service to  their  fellow
citizens  as  their  reason  for existence; they believe that integrity,
accountability, cooperation, and education are their means to  attaining
excellence, providing service, and reaching goals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Additionally,  the members of the Franklin Square & Munson
Fire Department are committed to utilizing innovation and creativity  in
solving  problems  and  recognize  the  contribution  of all individuals
through mutual respect, diversity, trust, and support; and
 
  WHEREAS, With its  impressive  force  of  caring  firefighters,  the
record of the Franklin Square & Munson Fire Department in public service
and fire protection is one to be applauded; for 24 hours a day, 365 days
a  year,  for 100 years, whenever the alarm sounded, these noble men and
women provided aid to their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS, The brave firefighters of the Franklin Square & Munson Fire
Department are prepared to risk their lives every day to help  save  the
lives  of  others and to protect homes and property from the destruction
caused by fire and hazards to life, health, and well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the skill and devoted  service  demonstrated
by individual firefighters, the Franklin Square & Munson Fire Department
reflects  the  history and development of firefighting over the past 100
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to  those  individuals  who  recognize that the preservation of life and
property is a sacred responsibility and  who  make  that  responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment of their communities and publicly acknowledge the heroic good
works  performed  by  the  fire  departments of this great Empire State,
their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly  commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the Franklin Square &
Munson Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to  the  members  of  the  Franklin  Square  &  Munson  Fire
Department.
