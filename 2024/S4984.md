 Introduced  by  Sen.  MURRAY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to the effect  of  failed
  propositions  on voter approval for remaining propositions not collec-
  tively exceeding the tax levy limit

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  9 of section 2023-a of the education law, as
 added by section 2 of part A of chapter 97  of  the  laws  of  2011,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  9.  Nothing  in  this section shall preclude the trustee, trustees, or
 board of education of a  school  district,  in  their  discretion,  from
 submitting  additional  items of expenditures to the voters for approval
 as separate propositions or  the  voters  from  submitting  propositions
 pursuant  to sections two thousand eight and two thousand thirty-five of
 this part; provided however, except in the case of a proposition submit-
 ted for any expenditure contained within subparagraphs (i) through  (iv)
 of  paragraph  i of subdivision two of this section, if any proposition,
 or propositions collectively that are subject to  a  vote  on  the  same
 date,  would  require  an  expenditure of money that would require a tax
 levy and would result in the tax  levy  limit  being  exceeded  for  the
 corresponding  school  year  then  such proposition shall be approved if
 sixty percent of the votes cast thereon are in the affirmative.  IN  THE
 EVENT  THAT  THE  TRUSTEE,  TRUSTEES,  OR BOARD OF EDUCATION OF A SCHOOL
 DISTRICT OR THE  VOTERS  SUBMIT  ADDITIONAL  ITEMS  OF  EXPENDITURE  FOR
 APPROVAL  AS  A  SEPARATE  PROPOSITION OR PROPOSITIONS AND SUCH SEPARATE
 PROPOSITION OR PROPOSITIONS COLLECTIVELY WITH THE BUDGET EXCEED THE  TAX
 LEVY LIMIT, THE BUDGET SHALL BE APPROVED IF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST
 THEREON  ARE  IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND IF THE BUDGET, WITHOUT THE SEPARATE
 PROPOSITION OR PROPOSITIONS, DOES NOT EXCEED THE TAX LEVY LIMIT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
