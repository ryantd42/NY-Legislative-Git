  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Eastchester, in the county  of  Westchester,
 is  hereby  authorized  to accept from the Chai Center, a not-for-profit
 organization, an application for  exemption  from  real  property  taxes
 pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax law for the 2021-2022
 assessment  roll  for  all  of the 2021-2022 school taxes and all of the
 2022 general taxes for the parcel located at 455 White Plains  Road,  in
 the town of Eastchester, county of Westchester, otherwise known as West-
 chester  county  parcel  ID  section 44 block 2 lot 11. If accepted, the
 application shall be reviewed as if it has been received  on  or  before
 the taxable status date established for such roll.
  If  satisfied that the Chai Center would otherwise be entitled to such
 exemption  if  the  organization  had  filed  an  application  for  such
 exemption on or before the appropriate taxable status date, the assessor
 of  the town of Eastchester, upon approval by the town board of the town
 of Eastchester, may grant exemption from taxation with  respect  to  the
 subject roll and make the appropriate correction to the subject roll. If
 the  exemption  is  granted  and the Chai Center shall have paid any tax
 with respect to the subject roll, the applicable governing body  or  tax
 department  may  in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of those
 taxes paid and cancel those taxes, fines, penalties, liens  or  interest
 remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
