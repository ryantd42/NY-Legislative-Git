  COMMEMORATING the 30th Anniversary of Jumpstart on
  April 11, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is incumbent upon the people of the State of New York to
recognize  and  acknowledge  those  within  our  midst  who  have  made
significant contributions to the quality of life therein; and
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time  this  Legislative  Body  takes  note  of
certain  extraordinary  individuals  and  organizations  it  wishes  to
recognize for their valued contributions to the success and progress  of
society and publicly acknowledge their endeavors which have enhanced the
basic humanity among us all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
30th Anniversary of Jumpstart to be celebrated on April 11, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  1994,  Jumpstart  is  a  national  early
education  nonprofit  organization which delivers high-quality language,
literacy and social-emotional programming  to  preschool  children  from
under-resourced communities and promotes quality early learning for all;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  idea  for Jumpstart began when college students Aaron
Lieberman, Rebecca Weintraub, Jordan Meranus and David Carmel met  while
working  at  Ramapo Anchorage Camp, a residential summer camp in Upstate
New York which serves children who are experiencing  social,  emotional,
or learning challenges; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During this time, Aaron, Rebecca, Jordan and David started
to notice the dramatic impact tailored, one-on-one attention and support
was having on their young campers after just a few short weeks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Inspired by the opportunity to  build  something  with  the
potential  for  a  deep  impact  on  the  lives  of countless vulnerable
children, these passionate entrepreneurs established a partnership  with
New Haven Head Start and began recruiting volunteers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  That  first  year,  Jumpstart volunteers worked one-on-one
with their assigned children, reinforcing the key  academic  and  social
skills all children need to succeed; they spent time with the children's
teachers  and  met  with  families  to  provide  an integrated effort to
support the children in their growth and skill-development; and
 
  WHEREAS, After the first pilot  program  wrapped  up,  the  teaching
staff  at  the  New  Haven  Head  Start  reported  100%  of the children
participating in  the  Jumpstart  program  improved  in  both  classroom
behavior and skill level; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  Jumpstart  has grown tremendously,
training more than 50,000 college students and community volunteers, and
transforming the lives of over 123,000  preschool  children  nationwide;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today, this vital organization leverages partnerships with
higher  education  institutions,  community  organizations,  Head  Start
programs,  community-based  preschools,  and  school districts to create
sustainable solutions in an effort to close the  kindergarten  readiness
gap; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jumpstart  recruits  and  trains  its  college  student
volunteers from 10 universities and colleges throughout New York City to
deliver quality support at its 40 preschool partner  locations,  serving
nearly 1,500 children during the school year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition, Brooklyn College students serve FirstStepNYC
preschool, and during the summer months, volunteers provide  a  modified
program  designed  to  address  regression  prior  to  the  start  of
kindergarten, reaching an additional 500 children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over  its  distinguished  30-year  history,  Jumpstart  has
demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Jumpstart is in direct  correlation  to  the
efforts  of  its  founders,  Aaron  Lieberman, Rebecca Weintraub, Jordan
Meranus and David Carmel, as well as  its  dedicated  volunteers,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in  all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the organization and the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 30th Anniversary of Jumpstart to be celebrated on April
11, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Jumpstart.
