  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the  "limited  equity  cooperative  insurance  captive authorization and

  § 2. Legislative purpose and findings. The purpose of this act  is  to
 enable limited equity cooperatives in the state of New York to establish
 insurance  captives  to  enhance  their ability to manage risks, improve
 insurance coverage, and promote  financial  stability.  Furthermore,  it

 captives that limited equity cooperatives can establish to one per coun-
 ty.
  § 3. The insurance law is amended by adding a new section 7013 to read
 as follows:
  §  7013.  LIMITED EQUITY COOPERATIVE INSURANCE CAPTIVE. (A) AS USED IN

  (B)  LIMITED  EQUITY  COOPERATIVES  ARE HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO ESTABLISH
 INSURANCE CAPTIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING  INSURANCE  COVERAGE  TO
 THEIR MEMBERS AND MANAGING RELATED RISKS.  NO LIMITED EQUITY COOPERATIVE
 SHALL  HOLD  MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF ITS RISK IN THE SAME COUNTY AND
 SHALL HOLD NO MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF ITS RISK IN NEW  YORK  CITY.  A
 LIMITED  EQUITY  COOPERATIVE  INSURANCE CAPTIVE SHALL HAVE NO FEWER THAN
 TEN THOUSAND UNITS UNDER ITS RISK MANAGEMENT.
  (C) THE LIMITED EQUITY  COOPERATIVE  SHALL  CREATE  AND  ORGANIZE  THE
 INSURANCE  CAPTIVE  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH BY THE
 DEPARTMENT AND OTHER APPLICABLE  LAWS  AND  REGULATIONS.  ANY  INSURANCE

  (D) AN INSURANCE CAPTIVE ESTABLISHED PURSUANT  TO  THE  PROVISIONS  OF

 FOR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RISKS, LIABILITY RISKS, AND  ANY  OTHER  RISKS
 DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE DEPARTMENT, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF THE DEPART-
 MENT.

 ENSURING  ITS  ABILITY TO MEET THE INSURANCE NEEDS OF THE LIMITED EQUITY
 COOPERATIVE MEMBERS.
  (G) PARTICIPATION IN THE LIMITED EQUITY COOPERATIVE INSURANCE  CAPTIVE
 BY  LIMITED  EQUITY  COOPERATIVE  MEMBERS SHALL BE VOLUNTARY. ANY MEMBER
 OPTING TO PARTICIPATE SHALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LIMITED EQUITY COOPERATIVE

 SARY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SECTION.
  § 4. Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part
 of this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction  to
 be  invalid  and  after  exhaustion  of all further judicial review, the
 judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the  remainder  thereof,
 but  shall  be  confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, para-
 graph, section or part of this act directly involved in the  controversy
 in which the judgment shall have been rendered.
  §  5. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law. Effective immediately,

 sary  for  the  implementation  of  this  act  on its effective date are
