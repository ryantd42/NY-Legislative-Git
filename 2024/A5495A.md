 fied  or recognized to represent the employees of such upstate TA-public
 employer, cannot be effected, or upon the joint request of the TA-public
 employer, the MTA-public employer (hereinafter jointly  referred  to  as
 public employer) or the upstate TA-public employer and any such affected
 employee  organization,  such  board shall refer the dispute to a public
 arbitration panel, consisting of one  member  appointed  by  the  public
 employer,  one  member  appointed  by  the employee organization and one
 public member appointed jointly by  the  public  employer  and  employee
 organization  who shall be selected within ten days after receipt by the
 board of a petition for creation of the  arbitration  panel.  If  either
 party fails to designate its member to the public arbitration panel, the
 board  shall promptly, upon receipt of a request by either party, desig-
 nate a member associated in interest with the public employer or employ-
 ee organization he is to represent. Each of the respective parties is to
 bear the cost of its member appointed or designated to  the  arbitration
 panel and each of the respective parties is to share equally the cost of
 the  public  member.  If,  within seven days after the mailing date, the
 parties are unable to agree upon the one public member, the board  shall
 submit to the parties a list of qualified, disinterested persons for the
 selection of the public member. Each party shall alternately strike from
 the  list one of the names with the order of striking determined by lot,
 until the remaining one person shall be  designated  as  public  member.
 This  process  shall  be  completed  within five days of receipt of this
 list. The parties shall  notify  the  board  of  the  designated  public
 member. The public member shall be chosen as chairman.
  §  2.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 the amendments to paragraph (a) of subdivision 5 of section 209  of  the
 civil  service  law made by section one of this act shall not affect the
 expiration of such subdivision and shall be deemed to expire therewith.
