Assembly Resolution No. 833

  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 4, 2024, as Transit Equity Day in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Transit Equity  Day  commemorates  the  birthday  of  civil
rights  icon  Rosa  Parks, an iconic figure in the Civil Rights movement
that ended legal segregation in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, In celebration of Rosa Parks' life and legacy, February 4th
serves as a national day of action to  further  the  goal  of  providing
frequent,  reliable,  accessible,  equitable  and  affordable  public
transportation as a civil right; and
 
  WHEREAS, Increasing access to such transportation has been and  will
continue to be the vanguard in any effort to address the persistent race
and  class  disparities that remain omnipresent in the United States and
transition to a more just, equitable, sustainable society; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the most transit-dependent state in  the  United  States
with  the busiest commuter rail system in the country and largest subway
system in the world, New York has and will continue to  play  a  crucial
role in advancing these principles; and
 
  WHEREAS, Racial inequity is realized in our built infrastructure, in
highways that bisect and segregate communities, traffic that poisons the
air, and disparate service qualities dependent on locale and mode; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Despite the advantages afforded by our legacy rail system,
this pattern remains pervasive in New York,  in  particular  in  transit
deserts  in boroughs beyond Manhattan where riders unable to afford high
commuter rail fares are subjected to slower, less frequent  or  reliable
modes of transport that rob them of time spent with friends, family, and
loved ones; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Much  work  remains  to  ensure  that  New  Yorkers of all
abilities irrespective of race or income, are  able  to  live  near  and
access  high  quality, affordable public transportation; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to February 4, 2024, as Transit Equity
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
