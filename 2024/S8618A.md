 LISH  A  MAPPING,  INSTALLATION  AND  EFFICIENCY PLAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF
 ALLOWING ORES AND OTHER APPLICABLE NEW YORK STATE ENTITIES  TO  IDENTIFY
 LOCATIONS IN THE STATE WHERE NEW OR EXISTING ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES
 CAN  BE  BUILT OR UPGRADED, EXCLUDING SPECIFIED INDIGENOUS LAND OR PRIME
 AGRICULTURAL AREAS THAT MAY BE  NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED.  SUCH  PLAN  SHALL
 FOCUS  ON  THE  IMPLEMENTATION  OF NEW OR EXISTING ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION
 LINES TO ALLOW THE EXPANSION OF TRANSMISSION  AND  DISTRIBUTION  INFRAS-
 TRUCTURE IN UNDER-SERVED COMMUNITIES.
  2. ORES SHALL PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS
 AND  MAXIMIZE  EFFICIENCY FOR INSTALLING NEW OR EXISTING ELECTRIC TRANS-

 TIME, AND COST.
  3.  ORES,  IN  CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT, ELECTRIC AND COMBINED
 ELECTRIC-GAS CORPORATIONS SHALL  GATHER  DATA  REGARDING  THE  AVAILABLE
 CAPACITY  OF ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND ITS EFFICIENCY FOR
 COMMUNITIES SERVED IN AREAS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF LINE CONGESTION,  AND/OR
 AREAS WITH HIGH RENEWABLE PENETRATION WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. ORES
 AND THE DEPARTMENT IN GATHERING SUCH DATA SHALL INCLUDE THE RESOURCE MIX
 OF WIND, SOLAR, HYDROGEN, ELECTRIC AND GAS POWER GENERATING FACILITIES.
  4. ONCE ORES HAS IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL NEW LOCATIONS OR SITES REQUIRING
 UPGRADES  FOR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 THIS SECTION AND HAS ESTABLISHED PROCESSES FOR INSTALLING  NEW  ELECTRIC
 TRANSMISSION LINES IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF
