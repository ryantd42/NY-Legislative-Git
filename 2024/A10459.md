 Introduced  by  COMMITTEE  ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Simon) --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Election Law
 
 AN ACT to amend the election law, in relation to deadlines  for  special
  presidential ballot applications for military voters
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 5 of section 10-106 of  the  election  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  113  of  the  laws  of 2023, is amended to read as
 follows:
  5. The state board of elections shall forward to the appropriate board
 of elections all applications for military ballots received  by  it.  An
 application  from  a  military  voter  not previously registered must be
 received by the appropriate board of elections not later than  ten  days
 before  a  general, primary, or special election in order to entitle the
 applicant to vote at such election. An application from a military voter
 who is already registered must be received at least [seven] FIFTEEN days
 before an election in order to entitle the applicant  to  vote  at  such
 election;  except  that  an  application  from such a military voter who
 delivers their application to the board of elections in person, must  be
 received not later than the day before the election.
  §  2. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 10-108 of the election
 law, as amended by chapter 164 of the laws of 2022, is amended  to  read

 uted by the board of elections, in accordance with the preferred  method

 shall  be  entitled  to a military ballot thereafter for each subsequent
 election through and including the next two regularly scheduled  general
 elections  held in even numbered years, including any run-offs which may
 occur;  provided,  however,  such application shall not be valid for any
 election held within [seven] FIFTEEN days  after  its  receipt.  Ballots
 shall  also  be  mailed  to  any qualified military voter who is already
 registered and who requests such military  ballot  from  such  board  of
 elections  in a letter, which is signed by the voter and received by the
 board of elections not later than the [seventh] FIFTEENTH day before the
 election for which the ballot is requested and which states the  address
 where  the voter is registered and the address to which the ballot is to
 be mailed. The board of elections shall enclose with such ballot a  form
 of  application  for military ballot. In the case of a primary election,
 the board shall deliver only the ballot of  the  party  with  which  the
 military  voter  is enrolled according to the military voter's registra-
 tion records. In the event a primary  election  is  uncontested  in  the
 military  voter's  election district for all offices or positions except
 the party position of member of the ward, town, city or  county  commit-
 tee,  no  ballot  shall  be  delivered  to  such military voter for such
 election; and the military voter shall be advised of the reason why  [he
 or she] SUCH MILITARY VOTER will not receive a ballot.
  §  3. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
