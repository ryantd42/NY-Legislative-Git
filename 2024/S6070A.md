 AN ACT to amend the social  services  law,  in  relation  to  a  refugee
  resettlement program
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares the following:
  a.  Under  federal  law 8 U.S.C. §1101 (a) (42), a refugee is a person
 who is forced to flee their country of origin or last habitation due  to
 persecution,  or  a  well-founded  fear of persecution, based upon their
 race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or
 political opinion;
  b. At the end of 2022, there were  108.4  million  forcibly  displaced
 people  in  the world, 35.3 million of which were refugees. This is more
 than double the recorded number in 2010, and the  highest  it  has  ever
 been;
  c.  Around two-thirds of refugees live in poverty, and many are unable
 to return to their home countries due to the lack of imminent  solutions
 to conflicts, recurrent violence, and political instability;
  d.  Less  than  1 percent of refugees will ever be resettled to a safe
 third country, enabling them  to  rebuild  their  lives  in  safety  and
 contribute to the cultural and economic fabric of a new home nation;
  e.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  refugee resettlement, the United
 States created the Refugee Act of 1980;
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 6070--A  2
 
  f. Since 1980, the United States Refugee  Admissions  Program  (USRAP)
 has  saved more than 3.7 million refugees, and resettled them across the
 country;
  g. As of 2021, New York State resettled the third most refugees in the
 country;
  h.  On  September 19, 2016, the United  Nations General Assembly unan-
 imously adopted the New York  Declaration  for  Refugees  and  Migrants,
 which  reaffirms  the importance of the international refugee regime and
 contains a wide range of commitments to  strengthen  and  enhance  mech-
 anisms to protect these individuals;
  i.  Research from reputable sources including the Fiscal Policy Insti-
 tute, Urban Institute, Pew Research Center,  and  New  American  Economy
 find  a  positive economic and social impact of refugees across New York
 State;
  j. Governor Kathy Hochul reaffirmed New  York  State's  commitment  to
 helping refugees on August 19, 2021 by welcoming those fleeing Afghanis-
 tan;
  k. The Statue of Liberty, a national monument and icon of freedom that
 has  been  welcoming  immigrants from across the world to New York State
 since 1886, states, "Give me your tired, your poor,  your huddled masses
 yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse  of  your  teeming  shore.
 Send  these,  the  homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside
 the golden door!";
  l. The State of New York has been proud to  partner  with  the  United
 States  Citizenship and Immigration Services in assisting and resettling
 refugees from USRAP through its Bureau of  Refugee  Services,  which  is
 housed within the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance;
  m.  The  legislature  hereby  affirms,  with  this  act, its continued
 commitment to resettle refugees through the United States Refugee Admis-
 sions Program within the boundaries of this state for as long  as  indi-
 viduals around the world are displaced from their home countries.

 act,  including  provision  for refugee cash assistance, refugee medical
 assistance, refugee child welfare services, and refugee social services.
 The department shall submit  the  plan  for  such  refugee  resettlement
 program to the federal department of health and human services and shall
 act  for  the  state  in any negotiations relative to the submission and
 approval of such plan and make any arrangement which may be necessary to
 obtain and retain such approval].
  (B) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ESTABLISH A REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM,  TO
 BE  ADMINISTERED  BY  THE  BUREAU  OF REFUGEE SERVICES HOUSED WITHIN THE
