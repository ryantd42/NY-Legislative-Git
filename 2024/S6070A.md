 the most refugees in 2020;
  f.  On  September 19, 2016, the United  Nations General Assembly unan-

 anisms to protect these individuals;

  i. The Statue of Liberty, a national monument and icon of freedom that
 has been welcoming immigrants from across the world to  New  York  State
 since 1886, states, "Give me your tired, your poor,  your huddled masses

 Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift  my  lamp  beside
 the golden door!"
