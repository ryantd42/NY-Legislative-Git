  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The civil practice law and rules is amended by adding a new
 section 4550 to read as follows:
  §  4550. DISCLOSURE OF MEDICAL RECORDS IN THIRD PARTY MEDICAL MALPRAC-
 TICE ACTION. 1. IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS WHERE  THE  PLAINTIFF  IS
 NOT  THE  PATIENT  OF  THE  DEFENDANT AND THE ALLEGED MALPRACTICE IS THE
 RESULT OF THE DEFENDANT'S TREATMENT OR CARE OF A NON-PARTY, THE  DEFEND-
 ANT  MAY  MAKE  A  MOTION  TO THE COURT TO COMPEL THE NON-PARTY PATIENT,
 NOTWITHSTANDING ANY STATE OR FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS TO  THE  CONTRARY,  TO
 WAIVE  THE  PRIVILEGE  IN  ORDER TO OBTAIN DISCLOSURE OF MEDICAL RECORDS
 RELEVANT TO THE LITIGATION OR PERMIT THE DEFENDANT TO TESTIFY ABOUT  HIS
 OR HER INTERACTIONS WITH THE NON-PARTY PATIENT.  THE COURT SHALL GRANT A
 WAIVER OF THE PRIVILEGE IF:
  (A)  THE  DEFENDANT  CAN SHOW THAT THE NON-PARTY PATIENT HAS FAILED TO
 WAIVE THE PRIVILEGE AFTER A GOOD FAITH EFFORT BY THE DEFENDANT WAS  MADE
 TO OBTAIN THE WAIVER; AND
  (B)  THE  RECORD OR TESTIMONY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE REQUESTED INFORMA-
 TION AND/OR RECORDS MAY PROVIDE A DEFENSE TO THE ACTION.
  2. IN THE INTEREST OF CONFIDENTIALITY, THE JUDGE MAY  ORDER  THAT  THE
 HEARING  BE  HELD IN CAMERA.  THE JUDGE MAY ALSO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF ANY
 DISCLOSURE ORDER TO ONLY MEDICAL INFORMATION THAT  IS  RELEVANT  TO  THE
 PENDING ACTION.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
