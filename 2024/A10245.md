 Introduced  by  COMMITTEE  ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Lucas) --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Governmental Operations
 
 AN ACT to  amend  the  executive  law,  in  relation  to  requiring  the
  collection  of  certain  demographic  information  by  state agencies,
  boards, departments and commissions
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares the following:
  (a) American Freedmen, descendants of persons enslaved in  the  United
 States,  Black Caribbean, Black African, and the Black Central and South
 American immigrant populations  are  the  most  diverse  in  the  United
 States.  The  vast majority of the group consist of American Freedmen,
 people who were trafficked against their will to the US via the Transat-
 lantic Slave Trade, a minority group consisting of persons who voluntar-
 ily immigrated to the United States.
  (b) While Black/African Americans are often misrepresented as a  homo-
 geneous  group,  they  are  an extremely diverse group, with ethnicities
 from over 87 different  countries.  Although  American  Freedmen,  Black
 Caribbean  Immigrants,  African  Immigrants,  and those from Central and
 South America in this state share geographical commonalities, they expe-
 rience different social, educational, health, and economic outcomes that
 are unique to their respective communities.
  (c) Existing state law requires state demographic data to be collected
 for Black/African American as a singular ethnic group. However,  preced-
 ence  has been set by both the recent passing of chapter 745 of the laws
 of 2021 requiring the collection of certain demographic  information  by
 certain state agencies, boards and commissions within the Asian American
 Pacific  Islander  communities.  Precedence  was also set on the 2020 US
 census which disaggregated both Asian  and  Latino  groups.  The  United
 States  Census  Bureau currently reports data for more than 20 different
 ethnicities within the "Asian" & "Native  Hawaiians  and  Other  Pacific
 Islanders" categories alone.

  (d)  State  agencies should collect and update data on a regular basis
 and make it accessible to the public so that regional and local  govern-
 ments,  elected  officials,  decision makers, and other stakeholders can
 use the information to strategically target programs for those  most  in
 need.
  (e)  Given  the diversity of languages, cultures, and specific histor-
 ical oppression, separating data between Black/African  American  ethnic
 groups  and making the data publicly accessible are critical for enhanc-
 ing our state's understanding of the  needs  and  experiences  of  these
 different communities.
  §  2. Section 170-e of the executive law, as amended by chapter 123 of
 the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  § 170-e. Collection of demographic information.  1.  (A)  Every  state
 agency,  board,  department,  or commission that directly collects demo-
 graphic data as to the ancestry or ethnic origin  of  residents  of  the
 state  of  New  York  shall use separate collection categories and tabu-
 lations for the following Asian and Pacific Islander groups in New  York
 state:
  [(a)]  (I)  each  major  Asian  group shall include Chinese, Japanese,
 Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Asian Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani,  and
 all  of  the ten most populous Asian groups in the most recent five-year
 American community survey published by the United States Census  Bureau;
 and
  [(b)]  (II)  each  major  Pacific  Islander group shall include Native
 Hawaiian, Guamanian and Chamorro, and Samoan; or

 Asian or Pacific Island group.
  [2.]  (B)  Every  state  agency, board, department, or commission that

 ing  practices  as  required  by  this  [section]  SUBDIVISION and shall
 continue to collect and  report  on  any  demographic  group  no  longer
 included  in  the  ten  most  populous  groups  until the release of the
 following five-year American community survey, at which time state agen-
 cies, boards, departments or commissions may cease to collect and report
 on such demographic groups provided they remain  outside  the  ten  most
 populous groups.
  [4.] (D) The data collected pursuant to the different collection cate-
 gories  and  tabulations  described in PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS subdivision
 [one of this section], to the degree that the  data  quality  is  suffi-

 ethnic origins of residents of the state of New York by the state  agen-
 cy,  board,  department, or commission published or released on or after
