 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic  law,  in  relation  to  driving
  privilege  licenses  and  making  technical  corrections; to amend the
  election law, in relation to registering to vote on an application for
  a motor vehicle driver's license
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  501 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 7 to read as follows:
  7. DRIVING PRIVILEGE LICENSES. (A) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ISSUE  DRIV-
 ING  PRIVILEGE  LICENSES AS PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE. SUCH LICENSE SHALL
 BE VALID ONLY FOR THE OPERATION OF A MOTOR VEHICLE OF A TYPE WHICH COULD
 BE OPERATED BY THE HOLDER OF THE CLASS OF LICENSE FOR WHICH  APPLICATION
 IS BEING MADE, PROVIDED, HOWEVER THAT NO DRIVING PRIVILEGE LICENSE SHALL
 BE ISSUED WHICH WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE.
  (B)  (I)  NO  GOVERNMENTAL  ENTITY  SHALL  ACCEPT  A DRIVING PRIVILEGE
 LICENSE AS PROOF OF PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION.
  (II) NO DRIVING PRIVILEGE LICENSE SHALL BE USED AS A DOCUMENT  PROVID-
 ING PROOF OF A PERSON'S AGE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT REQUIRED PURPOSE.
  §  2.  Subdivision 1 of section 502 of the vehicle and traffic law, as
 separately amended by chapters 158 and 440  of  the  laws  of  2021,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  Application  for license. Application for a driver's license shall
 be made to the commissioner. The fee prescribed by law may be  submitted
 with such application. The applicant shall furnish such proof of identi-
 ty,  age,  and  fitness  as  may  be  required by the commissioner. With
 respect to a [non-commercial  driver's]  DRIVING  PRIVILEGE  license  or
 learner's  permit  which does not meet federal standards for identifica-
 tion, in addition to the acceptable proofs of age and identity  approved
 by the commissioner as of January first, two thousand nineteen, accepta-

 ble  proof  of  identity  shall  also  include, but not be limited to, a
 valid, unexpired foreign passport issued by the applicant's  country  of
 citizenship  (which  shall  also  be eligible as proof of age), a valid,
 unexpired  consular  identification  document issued by a consulate from
 the applicant's country of citizenship,  or  a  valid  foreign  driver's
 license  that includes a photo image of the applicant and which is unex-
 pired or expired for less than twenty-four months of its date of expira-
 tion, as primary forms of such proof. Nothing contained in this subdivi-
 sion shall  be  deemed  to  preclude  the  commissioner  from  approving
 additional  proofs  of  identity and age.  The license shall display the
 sex designation of M, F, or X as certified by  the  applicant,  with  no
 additional  documentation  required.  The  applicant  may  amend the sex
 designation of their driver's license upon request.  Upon  amendment  of
 the  sex  designation,  the  change shall be made consistent through all
 affiliated records within the control of the department. The commission-
 er may also provide that the application  procedure  shall  include  the
 taking  of  a  photo image or images of the applicant in accordance with
 rules and regulations prescribed by the commissioner. In  addition,  the
 commissioner  also  shall require that the applicant provide such appli-
 cant's social security number or, in lieu thereof, with  respect  to  an
 application for a [non-commercial driver's] DRIVING PRIVILEGE license or
 learner's  permit  which does not meet federal standards for identifica-
 tion, an affidavit signed by such applicant  that  they  have  not  been
 issued  a  social  security  number. The commissioner also shall provide
 space on the application so that the applicant may  request  a  notation
 upon  such license that such applicant is a veteran of the United States
 armed forces, and space on the application so  that  the  applicant  may
 request  a notation upon such license that he or she is a veteran of the
 United States armed forces, and space on the  application  so  that  the
 applicant  may  register  in  the  New York state organ and tissue donor
 registry under section forty-three hundred ten of the public health  law
 with  the  following  stated on the application in clear and conspicuous
 type:
  "You must fill out the following section: Would you like to  be  added
 to  the  Donate  Life  Registry? Check box for 'yes' or 'skip this ques-
 tion'."
  The commissioner of health shall not maintain records  of  any  person
 who checks "skip this question". Except where the application is made in
 person  or  electronically,  failure to check a box shall not impair the
 validity of an application, and failure to check "yes" or checking "skip
 this question" shall not be construed to imply a wish not to donate.  In
 the  case  of  an  applicant under eighteen years of age, checking "yes"
 shall not constitute consent to make an anatomical gift or  registration
 in  the  donate  life registry, except as otherwise provided pursuant to
 the provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision  one  of  section  forty-
 three  hundred  one  of  the  public  health law. Where an applicant has
 previously consented to make an anatomical gift  or  registered  in  the
 donate  life registry, checking "skip this question" or failing to check
 a box shall not impair that consent or  registration.  In  addition,  an
 applicant  for  a commercial driver's license who will operate a commer-
 cial motor vehicle in interstate commerce shall certify that such appli-
 cant meets the requirements to operate a commercial  motor  vehicle,  as
 set  forth  in public law 99-570, title XII, and title 49 of the code of
 federal regulations, and  all  regulations  promulgated  by  the  United
 States  secretary of transportation under the hazardous materials trans-
 portation act. In addition,  an  applicant  for  a  commercial  driver's
 S. 5244  3
 
 license shall submit a medical certificate at such intervals as required
 by  the  federal  motor  carrier safety improvement act of 1999 and Part
 383.71(h) of title 49 of the code of  federal  regulations  relating  to
 medical  certification  and  in a manner prescribed by the commissioner.
 For purposes of this section  and  sections  five  hundred  three,  five
 hundred ten-a, and five hundred ten-aa of this title, the terms "medical
 certificate" and "medical certification" shall mean a form substantially
 in  compliance  with the form set forth in Part 391.43(h) of title 49 of
 the code of federal regulations. Upon a determination that the holder of
 a commercial driver's license has made any false statement, with respect
 to the application for such license, the commissioner shall revoke  such
 license.
  §  3. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 6 of section 502 of the vehicle and
 traffic law, as amended by chapter 37 of the laws of 2019, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (a) A license issued pursuant to  subdivision  five  of  this  section
 shall  be valid until the expiration date contained thereon, unless such
 license is suspended, revoked or cancelled. Such license may be  renewed
 by  submission of an application for renewal, the fee prescribed by law,
 proofs of prior licensing, fitness and acceptable vision  prescribed  by
 the  commissioner,  the  applicant's  social security number or, in lieu
 thereof, with respect to an application for a [non-commercial  driver's]
 DRIVING PRIVILEGE license or learner's permit which does not meet feder-
 al  standards  for identification, an affidavit signed by such applicant
 that they have not been issued a social security number, and if required
 by the commissioner, a photo image of the applicant in such numbers  and
 form  as the commissioner shall prescribe. In addition, an applicant for
 renewal of a license containing a hazardous material  endorsement  shall
 pass  an examination to retain such endorsement. The commissioner shall,
 with respect to the renewal of a hazardous materials endorsement, comply
 with the requirements  imposed  upon  states  by  sections  383.141  and
 1572.13  of  title  49  of the code of federal regulations. A renewal of
 such license shall be issued by the commissioner upon approval  of  such
 application, except that no such license shall be issued if its issuance
 would  be  inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of  section five hundred
 sixteen of this title, and except that the commissioner  may  refuse  to
 renew  such  license if the applicant is the holder of a currently valid
 or renewable license to drive issued by another state or foreign country
 unless the applicant surrenders such license.
  § 4. Subdivision 8 of section 502 of the vehicle and traffic  law,  as
 added by chapter 37 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  8. Non-commercial drivers' licenses and learners' permits which do not
 meet federal standards for identification. [(a)] Non-commercial drivers'
 licenses  and  learners' permits which do not meet federal standards for
 identification shall be issued in such form as  the  commissioner  shall
 determine,  provided  that  such  licenses and permits shall be visually
 identical to non-commercial  drivers'  licenses  and  learners'  permits
 which  do  meet  federal  standards  for identification except that such
 licenses and permits may state "Not  for  Federal  Purposes".  Provided,
 however,  that the commissioner may promulgate regulations providing for
 additional design or color indicators for both such non-commercial driv-
 ers' licenses and learners' permits if required to comply  with  federal
 law.

 PROVIDED THAT SUCH LICENSES AND PERMITS SHALL BE  VISUALLY  DISTINCT  TO
 NON-COMMERCIAL  DRIVERS'  LICENSES  AND  LEARNERS' PERMITS WHICH DO MEET
 FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR IDENTIFICATION INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THAT
 SUCH  LICENSES AND PERMITS SHALL STATE A PHRASE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO
 "FOR DRIVING PRIVILEGES ONLY - NOT VALID FOR IDENTIFICATION".  PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER,  THAT THE COMMISSIONER MAY PROMULGATE REGULATIONS PROVIDING FOR
 ADDITIONAL DESIGN OR COLOR INDICATORS FOR DRIVING PRIVILEGE LICENSES AND
 LEARNERS' PERMITS APPLIED FOR WITH ALTERNATIVE FORMS  OF  IDENTIFICATION
 IF  REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW. AS USED IN THIS SECTION "ALTER-

 CATION DOCUMENT ISSUED BY A CONSULATE FROM THE  APPLICANT'S  COUNTRY  OF
 CITIZENSHIP,  OR  A VALID FOREIGN DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT INCLUDES A PHOTO

 gration status.

 learner's permit [which does not meet federal standards for] APPLIED FOR
