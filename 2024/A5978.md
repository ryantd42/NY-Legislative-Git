  § 250. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  1.  THE  LEGISLATURE  FINDS  THAT  SEVERAL
 COMMUNITIES  WITHIN  THE STATE HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A LACK OF
 BANKING SERVICES TO MEET THEIR FINANCIAL NEEDS. LOW-INCOME,  INNER  CITY
 AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE OFTEN LEFT OUT OF THE BANKING SYSTEM. FURTHER-
 MORE,  INDIVIDUALS  WITHOUT  LAWFUL  IMMIGRATION  STATUS HAVE DIFFICULTY
 ACCESSING BANKING SERVICES, PARTICULARLY WHEN  THE  PROCESS  REQUIRES  A
 SOCIAL  SECURITY  NUMBER  OR A FORM OF GOVERNMENT-ISSUED IDENTIFICATION.
 THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAS AN INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT COMMUNITIES  THAT
 ARE  UNDERSERVED BY BANKING INSTITUTIONS HAVE ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES
 SUCH AS LOW OR NO COST SAVINGS AND CHECKING ACCOUNTS,  LOANS  AND  ELEC-
 TRONIC  BANKING PLATFORMS.  PROVIDING BANKING SERVICES TO THESE COMMUNI-
 TIES WILL ENSURE THEY CAN SAFELY AND SECURELY STORE THEIR MONEY AND HAVE
 ACCESS TO FINANCING OPTIONS THAT ARE LEGITIMATE ALTERNATIVES TO PREDATO-
 RY LENDING PRACTICES, SUCH AS HIGH-INTEREST PAY-DAY LOANS.
  2. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT A  GROUP  WITH  INSUFFICIENT  ACCESS  TO
 BANKING SERVICES IS THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. THE FEDERAL CLASSIFICATION OF
 CANNABIS  AS  A  SCHEDULE  I DRUG UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT OF
 1970 MEANS MOST PRIVATE BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS ARE UNABLE TO OR  REFUSE
 TO  SERVICE  BANK  ACCOUNTS  HELD  BY CANNABIS-RELATED BUSINESSES DUE TO
 FEDERAL MONEY LAUNDERING STATUTES AND  THE  BANK  SECRECY  ACT.  AS  A
 RESULT,  CANNABIS-RELATED  BUSINESSES  ARE  LOCKED  OUT  OF  THE BANKING
 SYSTEM, FORCING THEM TO RELY ENTIRELY ON CASH TO  CONDUCT  TRANSACTIONS.
 BEING CASH-ORIENTED LEAVES CANNABIS-RELATED BUSINESSES DISPROPORTIONATE-
 LY  SUSCEPTIBLE  TO BURGLARY OF THEIR PROPERTY AND MAKES THEIR EMPLOYEES
 TARGETS OF VIOLENT ROBBERY.  IN ADDITION,  CASH  TRANSACTIONS  ARE  NOT
 TRACEABLE  BY  STATE AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL REGULATORS, MEANING CASH-ONLY
 CANNABIS-RELATED BUSINESSES CAN BE USED TO LAUNDER  MONEY  DERIVED  FROM
 ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.  THEREFORE, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE EXCLUSION
 OF  CANNABIS-RELATED  BUSINESSES  FROM  THE BANKING SYSTEM CONSTITUTES A
 PUBLIC SAFETY AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY ISSUE.
  3. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF  A  PUBLICLY  OWNED
 AND  OPERATED  BANK WOULD ALLEVIATE ISSUES OF FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY AND
 PUBLIC SAFETY BY PROVIDING A SECURE DEPOSITORY FOR THE STORAGE AND LEND-
 ING OF CANNABIS-RELATED BUSINESSES FUNDS AND  DEPOSITS  FROM  LOW-INCOME
 RESIDENTS OF THE STATE.
  4. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT IN ADDITION TO INCREASING PUBLIC SAFETY,
 THE  PROVISION  OF BANKING SERVICES TO CANNABIS-RELATED BUSINESSES WOULD
 FACILITATE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN  NEW  YORK  STATE.  THE  LEGAL
 CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS PROJECTED TO GROW BY TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN
 COMING YEARS. A STATE OWNED AND OPERATED BANK CAN FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH
 AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND SPUR JOB CREATION IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY BY
 PROVIDING  COLLATERALIZED  LOANS  TO  COMMUNITIES UNDERSERVED BY BANKING
 INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING ELIGIBLE AND REGISTERED  CANNABIS-RELATED  BUSI-
 NESSES.
  5.  THE  LEGISLATURE  INTENDS  TO ESTABLISH THE NEW YORK STATE BANKING
 AUTHORITY AND THE NEW YORK STATE BANK TO USE A PORTION OF THE TAX REVEN-
 UE RECEIVED FROM THE SALES OF LEGAL ADULT-USE CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO SERVE
 LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES AND CANNABIS-RELATED BUSINESSES THAT  ARE  UNDER-
 SERVED BY BANKING INSTITUTIONS.
