BY: M. of A. Jacobson
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  175th  Anniversary  of  Vassar
  Temple
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
certain exemplary institutions whose stewardship of faith and commitment
to  public service strengthen the fabric of communities across the great
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 175th Anniversary of Vassar Temple; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is our intent to recognize the work of Vassar Temple  in
Poughkeepsie,  New  York,  in gratitude for its dedication to the Jewish
faith and support for Jewish heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its founding as The Congregation Brethren  of  Israel
in  1848, Vassar Temple has served as the spiritual home for generations
of Jewish members; and
 
  WHEREAS, Opening with  sixteen  families  at  its  founding,  Vassar
Temple  is  now  the oldest continuously functioning Jewish congregation
between New York City and Albany; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1951, Vassar Temple joined the Union of American  Hebrew
Congregations, now the Union for Reform Judaism; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1953, the current home of Vassar Temple on Hooker Avenue
at Cherry Street in Poughkeepsie was dedicated; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Vassar  Temple  has  served  as  a center of fellowship to
support and guide congregants through life events, spiritual needs,  and
religious education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Vassar  Temple  has  supported outreach to both Jewish and
non-Jewish residents, including through its work on the Dutchess  County
Interfaith Council; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Vassar  Temple  has been a local pillar in its work toward
tikkun olam (the repair of the world),  serving  the  community  through
blood  drives  with  the  Red  Cross,  helping unhoused individuals with
Hudson River Housing, supporting  domestic  violence  victims  at  Grace
Smith House, and fighting hunger with monthly food donations to Dutchess
Outreach; now therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 175th Anniversary of Vassar Temple; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Vassar Temple.
