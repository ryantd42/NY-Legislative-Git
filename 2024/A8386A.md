 PROPORTION AS ALL OTHER UNITS IN  THE  DEVELOPMENT.  THE  MINIMUM  GROSS
 FLOOR  AREA PER AFFORDABLE UNIT SHALL NOT BE LESS THAN NINETY PERCENT OF
 THE AVERAGE FLOOR AREA OF NON-RESTRICTED  HOUSING  UNITS  OF  EQUIVALENT
 SIZE  (EFFICIENCY,  ONE-,  TWO-,  THREE-  AND FOUR-BEDROOM UNITS) IN THE

  (F)  FOR  AFFORDABLE  HOMEOWNERSHIP  UNITS, THE TITLE TO SAID PROPERTY
 SHALL BE RESTRICTED SO THAT IN THE EVENT OF ANY RESALE BY THE HOME BUYER
 OR ANY SUCCESSOR, THE RESALE PRICE SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT AFFORDABLE
 TO A HOUSEHOLD AT THE SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME.
  8. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO  OVERRIDE  THE  NEW

 WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  (B)  IF,  UPON COMMENCEMENT OF SUCH PROCEEDING, IT SHALL APPEAR TO THE
 COURT THAT TESTIMONY IS NECESSARY FOR  THE  PROPER  DISPOSITION  OF  THE
 MATTER,  THE COURT MAY TAKE EVIDENCE AND DETERMINE THE MATTER.  ALTERNA-
 TIVELY, THE COURT MAY APPOINT A  HEARING  OFFICER  PURSUANT  TO  ARTICLE
 FORTY-THREE OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES TO TAKE SUCH EVIDENCE AS
 IT  MAY  DIRECT  AND REPORT THE SAME TO THE COURT WITH THE HEARING OFFI-
