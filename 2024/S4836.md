  (V) WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE RECEIPT OF AN APPLICATION,  THE  DEPARTMENT
 OF  STATE SHALL REVIEW THE APPLICATION TO ENSURE THE APPLICANT HAS FILED
 THE CORRECT APPLICATION, AND TO DETERMINE IF ANY  REQUIRED  SECTIONS  OF
 THE  APPLICATION  CONTAIN  NO  INFORMATION.  WITHIN  ONE BUSINESS DAY OF
 DETERMINING  AN  APPLICANT HAS FILED AN INCORRECT APPLICATION, OR DETER-
 MINING AN APPLICATION CONTAINS NO INFORMATION IN A SECTION  REQUIRED  TO
 CONTAIN  INFORMATION,  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  SO  NOTIFY THE APPLICANT.
 APPLICANTS SHALL BE PERMITTED TO AMEND AN APPLICATION FOUND TO BE  MISS-

 IF  IT  IS  AMENDED  BY  THE  APPLICATION  DEADLINE. IF AN APPLICANT HAS
 SUBMITTED AN INCORRECT APPLICATION, THE APPLICANT MAY SUBMIT THE CORRECT

 THE COMPETITIVE INTEGRITY OF THE GRANT PROGRAM.
  §  2. The sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000), or so much thereof
 as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated to the department  of  state
 out of any moneys in the state treasury in the general fund to the cred-
 it of the local government capital improvement grant program, not other-
 wise  appropriated,  and  made immediately available, for the purpose of
 carrying out the provisions of this act. Such moneys shall be payable on
 the audit and warrant  of  the  comptroller  on  vouchers  certified  or
 approved  by  the  commissioner of education in the manner prescribed by
 law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
