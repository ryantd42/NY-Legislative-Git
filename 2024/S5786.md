 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law and the family court act,  in
  relation  to statements of those accused of crimes to enhance criminal
  investigations and prosecutions and to promote confidence in the crim-
  inal justice system of this state
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  3 of section 60.45 of the criminal procedure
 law, as added by section 1 of part VVV of chapter  59  of  the  laws  of
 2017, is amended to read as follows:
  3.  (a)  [Where] WHEN a person is subject to [custodial] interrogation
 by a public servant [at a detention facility], AND THE PUBLIC SERVANT IS
 AWARE OR HAS REASON TO SUSPECT THAT THE PERSON INTERROGATED COMMITTED  A
 CRIME  UNDER  INVESTIGATION  BY SUCH PUBLIC SERVANT OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT
 ENTITY ASSOCIATED WITH  SUCH  PUBLIC  SERVANT,  the  entire  [custodial]
 interrogation, including the giving of any required advice of the rights
 of  the individual being questioned, and the waiver of any rights by the
 individual, shall be recorded by an appropriate video  recording  device
 [if the interrogation involves a class A-1 felony, except one defined in
 article  two hundred twenty of the penal law; felony offenses defined in
 section 130.95 and 130.96 of the penal law; or a felony offense  defined
 in  article  one  hundred  twenty-five or one hundred thirty of such law
 that is defined as a class B violent felony offense in section 70.02  of
 the  penal  law.  For  purposes  of  this paragraph, the term "detention
 facility" shall mean a police station,  correctional  facility,  holding
 facility  for  prisoners,  prosecutor's  office  or other facility where
 persons are held in detention in connection with criminal  charges  that
 have  been  or  may  be  filed against them]. THE INTERROGATION SHALL BE
 RECORDED  IN A MANNER SUCH THAT THE PERSONS IN THE RECORDING  ARE  SHOWN
 AND THE SPEECH IS  INTELLIGIBLE.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  (b) [No confession, admission or other statement shall be subject to a
 motion  to  suppress  pursuant to subdivision three of section 710.20 of
 this chapter based solely upon the failure to video record such interro-
 gation in a detention facility as  defined  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this
 subdivision. However, where] WHEN the people offer into evidence AGAINST
 A  DEFENDANT a confession, admission or other statement made by a person
 [in custody] with respect to  [his  or  her  participation  or  lack  of
 participation in] an ALLEGED offense [specified in paragraph (a) of this
 subdivision,] that has not been video recorded, the court shall [consid-
 er  the  failure  to  record as a factor, but not as the sole factor, in
 accordance with paragraph (c) of this subdivision in determining whether
 such confession, admission or other statement shall be admissible.
  (c) Notwithstanding the requirement of paragraph (a) of this  subdivi-
 sion,  upon  a  showing  of  good cause by the prosecutor, the custodial
 interrogation need not be recorded. Good cause shall include, but not be
 limited to:
  (i) If electronic recording equipment malfunctions.
  (ii) If electronic recording equipment is not available because it was
 otherwise being used.
  (iii) If statements  are  made  in  response  to  questions  that  are
 routinely asked during arrest processing.
  (iv)  If the statement is spontaneously made by the suspect and not in
 response to police questioning.
  (v) If the statement is made during an interrogation that is conducted
 when the interviewer is unaware that a qualifying offense has occurred.
  (vi) If the statement is made at a location other than the  "interview
 room"  because  the  suspect  cannot  be brought to such room, e.g., the
 suspect is in a hospital or the suspect is out of state and  that  state
 is not governed by a law requiring the recordation of an interrogation.
  (vii)  If the statement is made after a suspect has refused to partic-
 ipate in the interrogation if it is recorded, and appropriate effort  to
 document such refusal is made.
  (viii) If such statement is not recorded as a result of an inadvertent
 error  or  oversight,  not  the result of any intentional conduct by law
 enforcement personnel.
  (ix) If it is law enforcement's reasonable belief that such  recording
 would  jeopardize  the  safety of any person or reveal the identity of a
 confidential informant.
  (x) If such statement is made at a location not equipped with a  video
 recording  device  and  the  reason  for  using  that location is not to
 subvert the intent of the law. For purposes of this  section,  the  term
 "location"  shall  include those locations specified in paragraph (b) of
 subdivision four of section 305.2 of the family court act.
  (d) In the event the court finds that the people have not  shown  good
 cause  for  the  non-recording  of  the  confession, admission, or other
 statement, but determines that a non-recorded confession,  admission  or
 other  statement  is  nevertheless admissible because it was voluntarily
 made then, upon request of the defendant, the court  must  instruct  the
 jury  that  the  people's  failure to record the defendant's confession,
 admission or other statement as required by this section may be  weighed
 as  a  factor,  but  not as the sole factor, in determining whether such
 confession, admission or other statement was voluntarily  made,  or  was
 made at all.
  (e)  Video recording as required by this section shall be conducted in
 accordance with standards established by rule of the division of  crimi-

 AWARE  OR HAS REASON TO SUSPECT THAT THE CHILD INTERROGATED COMMITTED AN
 ACT THAT WOULD BE A CRIME IF COMMITTED BY AN ADULT AND  WHICH  IS  UNDER
 INVESTIGATION BY SUCH PUBLIC SERVANT OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY ASSOCI-
 ATED  WITH  SUCH PUBLIC SERVANT, the entire interrogation, including the
 giving of any required notice to the child as to his or her  rights  and
 the  child's  waiver of any rights, shall be video recorded [in a manner

 nal  justice services pursuant to paragraph (e)] AND GOVERNED IN ACCORD-

  8. In determining the suitability of questioning and  determining  the
 reasonable period of time for questioning such a child, the child's age,
 the  presence  or absence of his or her parents or other persons legally
 responsible for his or her care, notification  pursuant  to  subdivision
 three  OF  THIS  SECTION and, where the child has been interrogated at a
 facility designated by the chief administrator of the courts as a  suit-
 able  place  for the questioning of juveniles, whether the interrogation
 was in compliance with the video-recording and  disclosure  requirements
 of  subdivision  five-a of this section shall be included among relevant
 considerations.
  § 3. Subdivision 3 of section  344.2  of  the  family  court  act,  as
 amended  by  chapter  299  of  the  laws  of 2020, is amended to read as

 rogation  by  a  public  servant [at a facility specified in subdivision
 four of section 305.2 of this article,] AND THE PUBLIC SERVANT IS  AWARE
 OR  HAS  REASON  TO SUSPECT THAT THE CHILD INTERROGATED COMMITTED AN ACT
 THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CRIME IF COMMITTED BY  AN  ADULT  AND  WHICH  IS
 UNDER  INVESTIGATION  BY SUCH PUBLIC SERVANT OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITY

 gation,  including  the giving of any required [advice of the] NOTICE TO
