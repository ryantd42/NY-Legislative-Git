  RECOGNIZING  February  2,  2024, as World Wetlands
  Day
 
  WHEREAS, New York State understands the importance of preserving and
contributing  to  the  maintenance  of  wetlands,  and  understands  the
importance that they play in the cycle of preserving a proper balance in
the ecosystem; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year  on  February 2nd, people across the globe come
together to celebrate World Wetlands Day in  order  to  raise  awareness
about  the  vital  role  of wetlands for our planet and its inhabitants;
this monumental day marks the date of the adoption of the Convention  on
Wetlands on February 2, 1971; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Wetlands are land areas that are saturated or flooded with
water either permanently or seasonally; wetlands are currently estimated
to cover more than 12.1 million square kilometers, an area greater  than
the country of Greenland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Inland  wetlands  include  marshes,  ponds,  lakes,  fens,
rivers, floodplains, and swamps; and coastal wetlands include  saltwater
marshes, estuaries, mangroves, lagoons and even coral reefs; fish ponds,
rice paddies, and salt pans are human-made wetlands; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wetlands are critical to human and planet life; directly or
indirectly,  they  provide  almost  all  of  the  world's consumption of
freshwater, and more than one billion people depend on them for a living
and 40% of the world's species live and breed in wetlands; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wetlands are  a  vital  source  for  food,  raw  materials,
genetic  resources  for medicines, and hydropower; they mitigate floods,
protect coastlines and build community resilience to disasters, and they
play an important role  in  transport,  tourism  and  the  cultural  and
spiritual well-being of people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2012, Hurricane Sandy slammed into the eastern seaboard
of the United States, directly impacting New York State  and  inflicting
damage  in 24 states; if not for coastal wetlands, the destruction would
have been worse; a recent study  found  that  coastal  wetlands  in  the
Northeast  United  States prevented $625 million in direct flood damages
during Hurricane Sandy, reducing damages by more than 22% in half of the
impacted areas and by as much as 30% elsewhere; and
 
  WHEREAS, The intensity, frequency, and duration  of  North  Atlantic
hurricanes  have  increased since the early 1980s, making the protection
of the 50% of United States wetlands that remain an imperative; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State understands the importance of preserving and
contributing  to  the  maintenance  of  Wetlands,  and  understands  the
importance  that  wetlands  play  in  the  cycle  of preserving a proper
balance in the ecosystem; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to observe  those
events of true purpose and worthy accomplishment that recognize the need
for  the  understanding  of  preserving the Wetlands of New York and the
global community, and instilling educational tenets in our Great  State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize February 2, 2024, as World Wetlands Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Antonio  Guterres,  Secretary  General  of  the  United
Nations.
