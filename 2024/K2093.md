  COMMEMORATING  the  observance  of  Holocaust
  Remembrance Day in the State of New York on  May  6,
  2024
 
  LEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION  commemorating  the  observance  of  Holocaust
Remembrance Day in the State of New York on May 6, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, From 1933 to 1945, 5.8 million Jews were  murdered  in  the
Nazi  Holocaust  as  a  part  of  a  systematic program of genocide, and
millions of other people also perished as victims of Nazism; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jews who fell under German control in Eastern  and  Central
Europe were quickly stripped of their rights and property; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Jews who perished at Nazi hands comprised two-thirds of
all  European  Jewry,  and in countries such as Poland, which before the
Second World War included parts of the Ukraine and Belarus,  the  Jewish
death toll surpassed 90 percent; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The People of the State of New York should always remember
the atrocities committed by the Nazis so that  such  horrors  are  never
repeated; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Those  who survived the killing camps tell us that as many
people walked to their deaths, their last words were "remember us"; and
 
  WHEREAS, The year 2024 marks the 91st anniversary of  the  beginning
of  the genocide of European Jews- the darkest, most murderous moment in
history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  We  learn  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Holocaust  that
indifference  to  genocide  cannot  be  tolerated; Holocaust remembrance
imposes a moral obligation to speak out; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Holocaust  represents  the  darkest  period  in  the
civilization  of  mankind  and  must always be remembered to prevent its
reoccurrence anywhere else in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The People of the State  of  New  York  should  continually
rededicate  themselves to the principle of equal justice for all people;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The People of the State of New York should remain eternally
vigilant against all tyranny  and  recognize  that  bigotry  provides  a
breeding ground for tyranny to flourish; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Holocaust Remembrance Day, known in Hebrew as Yom HaShoah,
is a day set aside for remembering the victims of the Holocaust and  for
reminding New Yorkers, all Americans, and all people around the world of
what  can  happen  to  civilized  people  when  bigotry,  hatred,  and
indifference reign; and
 
  WHEREAS, Internationally, Holocaust Remembrance Day is  observed  on
the  27th  day of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar, which this year falls on
Monday, May 6, 2024; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the observance of Holocaust Remembrance Day in the State  of
New York on May 6, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and The Blue Card.
