  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to highlight the men and women who lend
their passion and skills to educating our children; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  16,  2024, as Teaching
Assistant's Day in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Teaching Assistant's Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Teaching Assistant's Day is held annually on the
16th of September to raise awareness of the hard  work  and  efforts  of
Teaching Assistants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Teaching  Assistants  are  instrumental  to the success of
classrooms, and serve as the eyes and the ears to ensure students are on
track; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to a US Bureau of Labor report, approximately 1.1
million Teaching Assistants are employed  in  elementary  and  secondary
schools  across the country; in the same report, New York State is found
to have one of the highest rates of employment and salary  for  Teaching
Assistants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Teaching  Assistants  develop  important  individual
relationships with students and help  create  exceptional  students  and
school environments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Significant  contributors  to education in New York State,
our  Teaching  Assistants  continually  demonstrate  an  impressive
dedication,  an  unparalleled devotion and an unremitting enthusiasm for
the quality of the educational programs  and  opportunities  offered  at
their  schools  for  the benefit of faculty and students, as well as for
the entire community; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize  the
educators of New York State who work to open the minds of their students
to new ideas, knowledge and dreams; who keep American democracy alive by
laying  the foundation for good citizenship; who fill many roles such as
listeners, explorers, role  models,  motivators  and  mentors;  and  who
continue to influence their students long after the school days are only
memories; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  16,  2024,  as
Teaching Assistant's Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
