  § 190. Civil actions for false claims. 1. Civil  enforcement  actions.
 (A)  The  attorney  general  shall  have  the  authority  to investigate
 violations under section one hundred eighty-nine of this article. If the
 attorney general believes that a person has  violated  or  is  violating
 such  section,  then  the  attorney  general may bring a civil action on
 behalf of the people of the state of New York or on behalf  of  a  local
 government  against  such person. A local government also shall have the
 authority to investigate violations that may have resulted in damages to
 such local government under section  one  hundred  eighty-nine  of  this
 article, and may bring a civil action on its own behalf, or on behalf of
 any  subdivision  of such local government, to recover damages sustained
 by such local government as a result of such violations. No  action  may
 be  filed  pursuant  to this subdivision against the federal government,
 the state or a local government, or  any  officer  or  employee  thereof
 acting  in  [his  or  her] THEIR official capacity. The attorney general
 shall consult with the office of medicaid  inspector  general  prior  to
 filing any action related to the medicaid program.
  (B)  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL IS EMPOWERED TO SUBPOENA WITNESSES, COMPEL
 THEIR ATTENDANCE, EXAMINE THEM UNDER OATH BEFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR
 A MAGISTRATE, A COURT OF RECORD  OR  A  JUDGE  OR  JUSTICE  THEREOF  AND
 REQUIRE THE PRODUCTION OF ANY BOOKS OR PAPERS WHICH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 DEEMS  RELEVANT  OR  MATERIAL  TO THE INQUIRY.  IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
 BELIEVES IT TO BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT AN INVESTIGATION BE  MADE,
 THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL  MAY  EITHER REQUIRE OR PERMIT ANY PERSON TO FILE
 WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL A STATEMENT IN WRITING UNDER OATH OR OTHERWISE
 AS TO ALL THE FACTS AND  CIRCUMSTANCES  CONCERNING  THE  SUBJECT  MATTER
 WHICH  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL  BELIEVES  IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO
 INVESTIGATE, AND FOR THAT PURPOSE MAY PRESCRIBE FORMS  UPON  WHICH  SUCH
 STATEMENTS  SHALL  BE  MADE.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY ALSO REQUIRE SUCH
 OTHER DATA AND INFORMATION AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY DEEM RELEVANT AND
 MAY MAKE SUCH SPECIAL AND INDEPENDENT  INVESTIGATIONS  AS  THE  ATTORNEY
 GENERAL  MAY DEEM NECESSARY IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTER.  THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL'S INVESTIGATIVE POWERS SHALL NOT ABATE OR TERMINATE BY REASON OF
 ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING  BROUGHT  BY  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL,  A  LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT, OR A QUI TAM PLAINTIFF UNDER THIS ARTICLE.
  2.  Qui  tam  civil  actions. (a) Any person may bring a qui tam civil
 action for a violation of section one hundred eighty-nine of this  arti-
 cle on behalf of the person and the people of the state of New York or a
 local  government.  No  action may be filed pursuant to this subdivision
 against the federal government, the state or a local government, or  any
 officer or employee thereof acting in [his or her] THEIR official capac-
 ity.
  For  purposes of subparagraphs (i) and (iv) of paragraph (a) of subdi-
 vision eight of section seventy-three of the public  officers  law,  any
 activity by a former government employee in connection with the securing
 of  rights,  protections  or  benefits related to preparing or filing an
 action under this article shall not be deemed to  be  an  appearance  or
 practice before any agency.
  (b)  A  copy  of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially
 all material evidence and information  the  person  possesses  shall  be
 S. 9813  4
 
 served on the state pursuant to subdivision one of section three hundred
 seven  of  the  civil  practice  law and rules. Any complaint filed in a
 court of the state of New York  shall  be  filed  in  supreme  court  in
 camera,  shall  remain under seal for at least sixty days, and shall not
 be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The seal shall not
 preclude the attorney general, a local government, or the qui tam plain-
 tiff from serving the complaint, any other  pleadings,  or  the  written
 disclosure  of  substantially  all  material  evidence  and  information
 possessed by the person bringing the action, on relevant FEDERAL, state,
 or local government agencies, or on law enforcement authorities  of  the
 state,  a  local  government, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, or other jurisdic-
 tions, so that the actions may be  investigated  or  prosecuted,  except
 that  such  seal applies to the agencies or authorities so served to the
 same extent as the seal applies to other parties in the action.
  If the allegations in the complaint allege a violation of section  one
 hundred eighty-nine of this article involving damages to a local govern-
 ment,  then  the attorney general may at any time provide a copy of such
 complaint and written disclosure to the attorney for such local  govern-
 ment;  provided,  however,  that  if  the  allegations  in the complaint
 involve damages only to a city with a population of one million or more,
 or only to the state and such a city, then the  attorney  general  shall
 provide such complaint and written disclosure to the corporation counsel
 of such city within thirty days.
  The  state  may  elect  to supersede or intervene and proceed with the
 action, or to authorize a  local  government  that  may  have  sustained
 damages  to  supersede or intervene, within sixty days after it receives
 both the complaint and the material evidence and information;  provided,
 however,  that  if the allegations in the complaint involve damages only
 to a city with a population of one million or more,  then  the  attorney
 general  may  not  supersede  or  intervene  in  such action without the
 consent of the corporation counsel of such city.  The  attorney  general
 shall consult with the office of the medicaid inspector general prior to
 superseding  or  intervening  in  any  action  related  to  the medicaid
 program. The attorney general may, for good cause shown, move the  court
 for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal
 under  this subdivision. Any such motions may be supported by affidavits
 or other submissions in camera.
  (c) Prior to the expiration of the sixty day period or any  extensions
 obtained  under  paragraph (b) of this subdivision, the attorney general
 shall notify the court that [he or she] THEY:
  (i) [intends] INTEND to file a  complaint  against  the  defendant  on
 behalf of the people of the state of New York or a local government, and
 thereby  be  substituted  as the plaintiff in the action and convert the
 action in all respects from a qui tam civil action brought by a  private
 person  into  a  civil  enforcement action by the attorney general under
 subdivision one of this section;
  (ii) [intends] INTEND to intervene in such action, as of right, so  as
 to aid and assist the plaintiff in the action; or
  (iii)  if the action involves damages sustained by a local government,
 [intends] INTEND to grant the local government permission to:  (A)  file
 and  serve a complaint against the defendant, and thereby be substituted
 as the plaintiff in the action and convert the action  in  all  respects
 from  a  qui  tam  civil action brought by a private person into a civil
 enforcement action by the local government under subdivision one of this
 section; or (B) intervene in such action, as of right, so as to aid  and
 assist the plaintiff in the action.
 S. 9813  5
 
  The attorney general shall provide the local government with a copy of
 any such notification at the same time the court is notified.
  (d)  If  the  state  notifies  the  court  that  it  intends to file a
 complaint against the defendant and thereby be substituted as the plain-
 tiff in the action, or to permit a  local  government  to  do  so,  such
 complaint,  whether  filed  separately or as an amendment to the qui tam
 plaintiff's complaint, must  be  filed  within  thirty  days  after  the
 notification to the court. For statute of limitations purposes, any such
 complaint  filed by the state or a local government shall relate back to
 the filing date of the complaint of the qui tam plaintiff, to the extent
 that the cause of action of the state or local government arises out  of
 the  conduct, transactions, or occurrences set forth, or attempted to be
 set forth, in the complaint of the qui tam plaintiff.
  (e) If the state notifies the court that it intends  to  intervene  in
 the  action,  or to permit a local government to do so, then such motion
 to intervene, whether filed separately or as an amendment to the qui tam
 plaintiff's complaint, shall be  filed  within  thirty  days  after  the
 notification  to  the  court.  For  statute of limitations purposes, any
 complaint filed by the state or a local government, whether filed  sepa-
 rately  or  as  an amendment to the qui tam plaintiff's complaint, shall
 relate back to the filing date of the complaint of the  qui  tam  plain-
 tiff,  to  the  extent  that  the  cause of action of the state or local
 government arises out of the conduct, transactions, or  occurrences  set
 forth,  or  attempted  to  be set forth, in the complaint of the qui tam
 plaintiff.
  (f) If the state declines to participate in the action or to authorize
 participation by a local government, the  qui  tam  action  may  proceed
 subject  to  judicial  review under this section, the civil practice law
 and rules, and other  applicable  law.  ONCE  THIRTY  DAYS  HAVE  PASSED
 FOLLOWING  THE  DATE  ON  WHICH THE STATE WAS REQUIRED TO OR IN FACT DID
 INFORM THE COURT PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS  SUBDIVISION  WHETHER
 IT INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE OR INTERVENE, OR AUTHORIZE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO
 DO  SO,  (I) A QUI TAM CLAIM ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED
 EIGHTY-NINE OF THIS ARTICLE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SHALL BE DISCONTINUED
 ONLY WITH THE CONSENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR A COURT ORDER;  (II)  A
 QUI TAM CLAIM ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE OF
 THIS  ARTICLE  ON  BEHALF  OF  THE STATE AND A LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL BE
 DISCONTINUED ONLY WITH THE CONSENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  OR  A  COURT
 ORDER;  AND  (III)  A  QUI TAM CLAIM ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION ONE
 HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE OF THIS ARTICLE SOLELY ON BEHALF OF A LOCAL  GOVERN-
 MENT  SHALL BE DISCONTINUED ONLY WITH THE CONSENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENER-
 AL, SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT, OR A COURT ORDER.
  The qui tam plaintiff shall provide the state or any applicable  local
 government  with a copy of any document filed with the court on or about
 the  date  it is filed, or any order issued by the court on or about the
 date it is issued. A qui tam plaintiff shall notify  the  state  or  any
 applicable  local  government within five business days of any decision,
 order or verdict resulting in judgment in favor of the  state  or  local
 government.  THE  QUI  TAM  PLAINTIFF SHALL PROVIDE THE STATE OR LOCAL
 GOVERNMENT A DRAFT OF ANY PROPOSED SETTLEMENT  AGREEMENT  AFFECTING  THE
 QUI  TAM ACTION AT LEAST FIVE BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE EXECUTING ANY SETTLE-
 MENT AGREEMENT.
  3. Time to answer. If the state decides to participate in  a  qui  tam
 action  or  to  authorize  the  participation of a local government, the
 court shall order that the qui tam complaint be unsealed and  served  at
 the  time  of  the filing of the complaint or intervention motion by the
 S. 9813  6
 
 state or local government. After the complaint  is  unsealed,  or  if  a
 complaint is filed by the state or a local government pursuant to subdi-
 vision  one  of  this  section,  the  defendant shall be served with the
 complaint  and  summons  pursuant to article three of the civil practice
 law and rules. A copy of any complaint which alleges that  damages  were
 sustained  by  a  local  government  shall  also be served on such local
 government. The defendant shall be required to respond  to  the  summons
 and  complaint  within the time allotted under rule three hundred twenty
 of the civil practice law and rules.
  4. Related actions. When a person brings a qui tam action  under  this
 section,  no  person other than the attorney general, or a local govern-
 ment attorney acting pursuant to subdivision  one  of  this  section  or
 paragraph (b) of subdivision two of this section, may intervene or bring
 a  related  civil  action  based  upon  the facts underlying the pending
 action; provided, however, that nothing in  this  subdivision  shall  be
 deemed  to  deny  persons the right, upon leave of court, to file briefs
 amicus curiae.
  5. Rights of the parties of qui  tam  actions.  (a)  If  the  attorney
 general  elects  to  convert  the  qui tam civil action into an attorney
 general enforcement action,  then  the  state  shall  have  the  primary
 responsibility  for  prosecuting  the  action.  If  the attorney general
 elects to intervene in the qui tam civil action then the state  and  the
 person  who  commenced  the  action,  and  any  local  government  which
 sustained damages and intervenes in  the  action,  shall  share  primary
 responsibility  for  prosecuting  the  action.  If  the attorney general
 elects to permit a local government to convert the action into  a  civil
 enforcement action, then the local government shall have primary respon-
 sibility  for  investigating  and  prosecuting the action. If the action
 involves damages to a local government but not the state, and the  local
 government  intervenes  in  the  qui  tam  civil  action, then the local
 government and the person who commenced the action shall  share  primary
 responsibility  for prosecuting the action. Under no circumstances shall
 the state or a local government be bound by an act of the person  bring-
 ing the original action. Such person shall have the right to continue as
 a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph
 (b) of this subdivision. Under no circumstances shall the state be bound
 by  the act of a local government that intervenes in an action involving
 damages to the state. If  neither  the  attorney  general  nor  a  local
 government  intervenes  in the qui tam action then the qui tam plaintiff
 shall have the responsibility for prosecuting the action, subject to the
 attorney general's right to intervene at a later date upon a showing  of
 good cause.
  (b)(i)  The  state  may move to dismiss the action notwithstanding the
 objections of the person initiating the action if the  person  has  been
 served  with the motion to dismiss and the court has provided the person
 with an opportunity to be heard on the motion. If  the  action  involves
 damages  to  both the state and a local government, then the state shall
 consult with such local government before moving to dismiss the  action.
 If  the  action involves damages sustained by a local government but not
 the state, then the local government may  move  to  dismiss  the  action
 notwithstanding  the  objections  of the person initiating the action if
 the person has been served with the motion to dismiss and the court  has
 provided the person with an opportunity to be heard on the motion.
  (ii)  The  state  or a local government may settle the action with the
 defendant notwithstanding the objections of the  person  initiating  the
 action  if  the court determines, after an opportunity to be heard, that
 S. 9813  7
 
 the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable  with  respect
 to  all  parties  under  all  the  circumstances. Upon a showing of good
 cause, such opportunity to be heard may be held in camera.
  (iii)  Upon  a  showing  by the attorney general or a local government
 that the original  plaintiff's  unrestricted  participation  during  the
 course of the litigation would interfere with or unduly delay the prose-
 cution  of  the  case,  or would be repetitious or irrelevant, or upon a
 showing by the defendant that the original  qui  tam  plaintiff's  unre-
 stricted  participation during the course of the litigation would be for
 purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant  undue  burden,  the
 court  may,  in  its  discretion,  impose  limitations  on  the original
 plaintiff's participation in the case, such as:
  (A) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;
  (B) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;
  (C) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or
  (D) otherwise limiting the participation by the person  in  the  liti-
 gation.
  (c)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law, whether or not the
 attorney general or a local government elects to supersede or  intervene
 in  a  qui tam civil action, the attorney general and such local govern-
 ment may elect to pursue any remedy available with respect to the crimi-
 nal or civil prosecution of the presentation of false claims,  including
 any  administrative  proceeding to determine a civil money penalty or to
 refer the matter to the office of the  medicaid  inspector  general  for
 medicaid  related matters. If any such alternate civil remedy is pursued
 in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall  have  the
 same  rights  in  such  proceeding  as such person would have had if the
 action had continued under this section.
  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law,  whether  or  not  the
 attorney  general  elects  to  supersede or intervene in a qui tam civil
 action, or to permit a local government to supersede or intervene in the
 qui tam civil action, upon a showing by the state  or  local  government
 that  certain  actions  of discovery by the person initiating the action
 would interfere with the state's or a local  government's  investigation
 or  prosecution  of  a  criminal or civil matter arising out of the same
 facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not  more  than
 sixty  days.  Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may
 extend the period of such stay upon a further showing in camera that the
 state or a local government has pursued the criminal or  civil  investi-
 gation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discov-
 ery  in  the  civil  action  will interfere with the ongoing criminal or
 civil investigation or proceedings.
  6. Awards to qui tam plaintiff. (a) If the attorney general elects  to
 convert  the  qui  tam civil action into an attorney general enforcement
 action, or to permit a local government to convert  the  action  into  a
 civil  enforcement  action  by such local government, or if the attorney
 general or a local government elects to intervene in the qui  tam  civil
 action,  then  the  person  or  persons  who initiated the qui tam civil
 action collectively shall be entitled to  receive  between  fifteen  and
 twenty-five  percent  of  the  proceeds  recovered  in  the action or in
 settlement of the action.  The court shall determine the  percentage  of
 the  proceeds  to which a person commencing [a] ANY qui tam civil action
 is entitled, by considering the extent to which the  plaintiff  substan-
 tially  contributed  to  the  prosecution of the action. Where the court
 finds that the action was based primarily  on  disclosures  of  specific
 information  (other than information provided by the person bringing the
 S. 9813  8
 
 action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil  or
 administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hear-
 ing, audit or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award
 such  sums  as  it  considers  appropriate, but in no case more than ten
 percent of the proceeds, taking into account  the  significance  of  the
 information and the role of the person or persons bringing the action in
 advancing  the case to litigation. Where the court finds that the action
 was based on disclosure of specific information related to  the  use  of
 government funds during a declaration of a state of emergency, the court
 shall  increase  the  percentage  of  the  proceeds  to which the person
 commencing such qui tam civil action is entitled by up to  five  percent
 more than the maximum percentage allowed pursuant to this paragraph. Any
 such  person  shall  also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that
 the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, reasonable attorneys'
 fees, and costs pursuant to article eighty-one of the civil practice law
 and rules. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be  awarded  against
 the defendant.
  (b)  If  the  attorney general or a local government does not elect to
 intervene or convert the action, and the action is successful, then  the
 person  or  persons  who  initiated  the  qui  tam  action which obtains
 proceeds shall be entitled to receive  between  twenty-five  and  thirty
 percent  of  the  proceeds  recovered in the action or settlement of the
 action. The court shall determine the  percentage  of  the  proceeds  to
 which  a  person commencing [a] ANY qui tam civil action is entitled, by
 considering the extent to which the plaintiff substantially  contributed
 to  the prosecution of the action. Where the court finds that the action
 was based on disclosure of specific information related to  the  use  of
 government funds during a declaration of a state of emergency, the court
 shall  increase  the  percentage  of  the  proceeds  to which the person
 commencing such qui tam civil action is entitled by up  to  ten  percent
 more  than  the  maximum  percentage allowed pursuant to this paragraph.
 Such person shall also receive an amount for  reasonable  expenses  that
 the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, reasonable attorneys'
 fees, and costs pursuant to article eighty-one of the civil practice law
 and  rules.  All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against
 the defendant.
  (c) With the exception of a court award of costs, expenses  or  attor-
 neys'  fees, any payment to a person pursuant to this paragraph shall be
 made from the proceeds.
  (d) If the attorney general or a local  government  does  not  proceed
 with  the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action,
 the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys' fees  and
 expenses  if  the  defendant  prevails in the action and the court finds
 that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly  frivolous,
 clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.
  7.  Costs,  expenses, disbursements and attorneys' fees. In any action
 brought pursuant to this article, the court may award any local  govern-
 ment that participates as a party in the action an amount for reasonable
 expenses  which  the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus
 reasonable attorneys' fees, plus costs pursuant to article eighty-one of
 the civil practice law and rules. All  such  expenses,  fees  and  costs
 shall be awarded directly against the defendant and shall not be charged
 from  the  proceeds,  but  shall  only  be awarded if a local government
 prevails in the action.
  8. Exclusion from recovery. If the court finds that the qui tam  civil
 action was brought by a person who planned or initiated the violation of
 S. 9813  9
 
 section  one  hundred  eighty-nine of this article upon which the action
 was brought, then the court may,  to  the  extent  the  court  considers
 appropriate,  reduce  the  share of the proceeds of the action which the
 person  would  otherwise be entitled to receive under subdivision six of

 vene in such action and to civilly prosecute the same on behalf  of  the
 state or a local government.
  9.  Certain  actions  barred.  (a)  The  court shall dismiss a qui tam

 rule or program enabling the public to request, receive  or  view  docu-
 ments  or  information  in  the possession of public officials or public
 agencies;
  (iii) in the news media, provided  that  such  allegations  or  trans-
