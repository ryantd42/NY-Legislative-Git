 AN ACT authorizing the Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center to file an
  application for exemption from real property taxes
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor of the town of Islip, county of Suffolk, is hereby author-
 ized to accept from the  Good  Samaritan  Hospital  Medical  Center,  an
 application  for  exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section
 420-a of the real property tax law with respect to the 2019-2020 assess-
 ment roll, for the parcel owned by such organization, with  such  parcel
 being located at 1111 Montauk Highway, in the hamlet of West Islip, town
 of  Islip,  county of Suffolk, otherwise known as Suffolk county tax map
 number 474.1-2-1. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed  as  if
 it  had  been  received on or before the taxable status date established
 for such roll.
  If satisfied that such  non-profit  organization  would  otherwise  be
 entitled to such exemption if such organization had filed an application
 for exemption by the appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by the town board of Islip, may grant exemption from all taxa-
 tion and make appropriate corrections  to  the  subject  roll.  If  such
 exemption is granted and such organization therefore shall have paid any
 tax  with  respect to the subject roll, the applicable governing body or
 tax department may, in its sole discretion, provide for  the  refund  of
 the  taxes  paid, along with any fines or penalties paid, and cancel any
 taxes, fines, penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
