 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Good  Samaritan  Hospital  Medical
  Center to file an application for a real property tax exemption
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Islip, county of Suffolk, is hereby  author-
 ized  to  accept  an  application for exemption from real property taxes
 from the Good Samaritan Hospital  Medical  Center  pursuant  to  section
 420-a of the real property tax law with respect to the 2021-2022 assess-
 ment roll, for the parcel located at 1111 Montauk Highway in the town of
 Islip,  county  of  Suffolk,  otherwise  known as Suffolk county tax map
 district 0500, section 474.01, block 03.00, lot 005.00. If accepted, the
 application shall be reviewed as if it had been received  on  or  before
 the taxable status dates established for such roll.
  If  satisfied that such not-for-profit organization would otherwise be
 entitled to such  exemption  if  such  not-for-profit  organization  has
 acquired  the subject property and filed an application for exemption by
 the appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon approval by  the
 town  board  of  Islip,  may  grant exemption from all taxation and make
 appropriate corrections to the subject roll. If such exemption is grant-
 ed and such not-for-profit organization therefore shall  have  paid  any
 tax  with respect to the subject roll, the governing body or tax depart-
 ment may, in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of those  taxes
 paid  and  cancel  any  taxes,  fines, penalties, interest, or tax liens
 remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
