  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 13, 2023, as K9 Veterans Day in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative Body to declare
official days that are set aside to honor  the  valiant  and  courageous
service  of  the many K9 military dogs who have protected and served our
country throughout its birth and growth; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  March  13,  2023,  as  K9
Veterans  Day  in the State of New York, in conjunction with National K9
Veterans Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many citizens and public officials from the  State  of  New
York will observe K9 Veterans Day with numerous activities and programs,
remembering  the  thousands of dogs who have served the United States of
America with honor, dignity and valor; and
 
  WHEREAS, The official K9 Corps was created on  March  13,  1942,  by
Joseph  J.  White, a retired Military Working Dog handler and founder of
this significant day, who pioneered  a  nationwide  effort  to  get  the
entire country to recognize March 13th as K9 Veterans Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  remarkable  dogs have served at many jobs in all of
our wars, having been employed by the United States Military from  World
War I to present conflicts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  this  day,  dogs  continue to serve on our borders and
abroad every day, on both land and sea; many New  York  State  residents
actively  participate  in  and  engage  in  K9  training and operational
activities to assist the United States Military; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to the current war on  terror,  such  dogs  as  Customs
Dogs,  Search  and  Rescue Dogs, Border Patrol Dogs, Police Dogs, Secret
Service Dogs and many more will be included with  the  Military  Working
Dogs  in  this  recognition  as  they  also  help  protect and serve our
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is well-known  that  K9  dogs  are  loyal,  loving,  and
devoted, and they have knowingly placed themselves in harm's way, making
the  ultimate  sacrifice  by laying down their lives for their partners;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is appropriate for  this  Legislative  Body  to  commend
these dogs and to recognize their contributions by observing K9 Veterans
Day,  honoring  the  past and present canines for their valuable service
and protection; they truly deserve to be remembered by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  March  13,  2023,  as  K9
Veterans Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
