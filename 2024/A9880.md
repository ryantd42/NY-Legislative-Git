  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 597 of the labor law, as added  by
 chapter  705  of  the  laws of 1944 and renumbered by chapter 663 of the
 laws of 1946, is amended to read as follows:
  1. Issuance. The validity of the claim  and  the  amount  of  benefits
 payable to the claimant shall be determined in accordance with the regu-
 lations  and  procedure  established  by the commissioner and, when such
 determination is issued by the commissioner,  it  shall  be  deemed  the
 initial  determination  of  the  claim. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LAW, RULE OR
 REGULATION TO THE CONTRARY, THE COMMISSIONER  SHALL  PROVIDE  NOTICE  TO
 EACH CLAIMANT OF SUCH INITIAL DETERMINATION OF APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF THE
 CLAIM  NO  LATER  THAN  THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE CLAIMANT HAS FURNISHED ALL

 ANCE OF A DETERMINATION, THE RETROACTIVE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  THE  CLAIMANT
 WOULD  RECEIVE  BENEFITS  FROM  IF  APPROVED,  AND  HOW THE CLAIMANT MAY
 CONFIRM THE STATUS OF THE DETERMINATION IF IT IS NOT RECEIVED BY THE NEW
