 INFORMATION.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ARE NOT LIMITED TO INFORMA-
 TION COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY OR OVER THE INTERNET,  BUT  APPLY  TO  THE
 COLLECTION  AND SALE OF ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY A BUSINESS

 PERSONAL  INFORMATION  SHOULD  BE  CONSTRUED  TO  HARMONIZE  WITH  THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, BUT IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN  EXIST-
 ING  LAW  AND  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW
 THAT AFFORD THE GREATEST PROTECTION FOR THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY FOR CONSUM-
 ERS SHALL CONTROL.
  14. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL PREVENT A  CITY,  COUNTY,  CITY  AND
 COUNTY,  MUNICIPALITY,  OR  LOCAL AGENCY FROM SAFEGUARDING THE CONSTITU-

 THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS, TAKING  INTO  ACCOUNT  AVAILABLE
 TECHNOLOGY, SECURITY CONCERNS, AND THE BURDEN ON THE BUSINESS, TO GOVERN
 A  BUSINESS'S DETERMINATION THAT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED BY A
 CONSUMER IS A VERIFIABLE REQUEST, INCLUDING TREATING A REQUEST SUBMITTED
 THROUGH A PASSWORD PROTECTED ACCOUNT MAINTAINED BY THE CONSUMER WITH THE
 BUSINESS WHILE THE CONSUMER IS LOGGED INTO THE ACCOUNT AS  A  VERIFIABLE
 REQUEST  AND  PROVIDING A MECHANISM FOR A CONSUMER WHO DOES NOT MAINTAIN

 OF  TRANSACTIONS  INVOLVING  MULTIPLE THIRD PARTIES, IN EXCHANGE FOR ANY
 ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS SUBJECT TO THIS SECTION,  AND  TO  INCLUDE  BUSINESS
 PRACTICES  INVOLVING  THE DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN EXCHANGE
 FOR SOMETHING OF VALUE. VALUABLE  CONSIDERATION  DOES  NOT  INCLUDE  THE

 PARTY", AND "BUSINESS PURPOSE" AS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION ONE  OF  THIS
 SECTION, TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, DATA COLLECTION, OBSTACLES TO
 IMPLEMENTATION,  AND  PRIVACY CONCERNS AND TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, PROVIDED THAT SUCH REGULATIONS DO  NOT  REDUCE
 CONSUMER  PRIVACY  OR THE ABILITY OF CONSUMERS TO STOP THE SALE OF THEIR
 PERSONAL INFORMATION.
  (B) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHALL BE PRECLUDED FROM ADOPTING  REGULATIONS
 THAT  LIMIT  OR  REDUCE  THE  NUMBER  OR SCOPE OF CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL
 INFORMATION ENUMERATED IN PARAGRAPH (C) OF SUBDIVISION SIX AND PARAGRAPH
 (M) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION, OR  THAT  LIMIT  OR  REDUCE  THE
 NUMBER  OR  SCOPE  OF  CATEGORIES  ADDED PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH ONE OF
 PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, EXCEPT AS NECESSARY  TO  COMPLY  WITH
 SUBPARAGRAPH  THREE  OF  PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION. THE ATTORNEY
 GENERAL SHALL ALSO BE PRECLUDED FROM REDUCING THE  SCOPE  OF  THE  DEFI-
 NITION  OF  "UNIQUE  IDENTIFIERS",  EXCEPT  AS  NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH
 SUBPARAGRAPH THREE OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.

 ATTORNEY  GENERAL  SHALL ADOPT ANY SUCH REGULATIONS WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF
 THE DATE THIS SECTION IS ADOPTED.
  (D) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY ADOPT ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS AS NECESSARY
 TO FURTHER THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.
  16. IF A SERIES OF STEPS OR TRANSACTIONS WERE  COMPONENT  PARTS  OF  A
 SINGLE  TRANSACTION  INTENDED  FROM  THE  BEGINNING TO BE TAKEN WITH THE
 INTENTION OF AVOIDING THE REACH OF THIS SECTION, INCLUDING  THE  DISCLO-
 SURE OF INFORMATION BY A BUSINESS TO A THIRD PARTY IN ORDER TO AVOID THE
 DEFINITION  OF "SELL", A COURT SHALL DISREGARD THE INTERMEDIATE STEPS OR
 TRANSACTIONS FOR PURPOSES OF EFFECTUATING THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.
  17. ANY PROVISION OF A CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT OF ANY KIND THAT PURPORTS
 TO WAIVE OR LIMIT IN ANY WAY A CONSUMER'S  RIGHTS  UNDER  THIS  SECTION,
 A. 4374  15
 
 INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY RIGHT TO A REMEDY OR MEANS OF ENFORCE-
 MENT, SHALL BE DEEMED CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AND SHALL  BE  VOID  AND
 UNENFORCEABLE.  THIS SECTION SHALL NOT PREVENT A CONSUMER FROM:  DECLIN-
 ING  TO  REQUEST  INFORMATION FROM A BUSINESS; DECLINING TO OPT OUT OF A
 BUSINESS'S SALE OF THE CONSUMER'S PERSONAL INFORMATION; OR AUTHORIZING A
 BUSINESS TO SELL THE CONSUMER'S PERSONAL  INFORMATION  AFTER  PREVIOUSLY
 OPTING OUT.
  18. IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE ADJUDGED BY ANY COURT OF
 COMPETENT  JURISDICTION  TO  BE INVALID, SUCH JUDGMENT SHALL NOT AFFECT,
 IMPAIR OR INVALIDATE THE REMAINDER THEREOF, BUT SHALL BE CONFINED IN ITS
 OPERATION TO THE PROVISION DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE CONTROVERSY IN WHICH
