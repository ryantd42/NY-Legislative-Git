  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 19-25, 2023, as Grain Bin  Safety  Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to  increase  awareness  of  important
issues  that affect the lives of agricultural workers of New York State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 19-25,  2023,  as
Grain Bin Safety Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Grain  Bin Safety Week, a collaborative effort by industry
leaders and agricultural professionals working together,  is  an  annual
observance which occurs the third full week of February to promote grain
bin safety on farms and commercial grain-handling facilities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Safety  of  farm  and  agricultural  workers  is of utmost
important to the government of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, It only takes seconds to be completely engulfed in  flowing
grain or overcome by oxygen-deficient atmospheres; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Grain  production,  handling  and  transportation  is  a
significant industry in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to increased training and more public awareness, deaths
from grain bin  entrapments  declined  until  2014;  that  year  saw  38
documented entrapments nationally, resulting in 17 deaths; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2018, there were 61 documented cases, an increase of 13%
over  the  54  cases reported in 2017, and of these cases, there were 30
documented grain entrapment cases; furthermore, 50% of  the  30  victims
entrapped in grain ended up being a fatality; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Grain  operators,  farmers and employees are encouraged to
help reduce the number of preventable  injuries  and  deaths  associated
with  grain  handling  and  storage  through  education and awareness of
hazards and safe work practices; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 19-25, 2023, as
Grain Bin Safety Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
