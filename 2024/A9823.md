  NEW YORK STATE DISCLOSURE FORM
  FOR
  BUYER AND SELLER
  THIS IS NOT A CONTRACT
  New  York  state  law requires real estate licensees who are acting as
 agents of buyers or sellers of property to advise the  potential  buyers
 or  sellers  with whom they work of the nature of their agency relation-
 ship and the rights and obligations it  creates.  This  disclosure  will
 help  you to make informed choices about your relationship with the real
 estate broker and its sales agents.
  Throughout the transaction you may receive more  than  one  disclosure
 form.  The  law  may  require each agent assisting in the transaction to
 present you with this disclosure form. A real estate agent is  a  person
 qualified to advise about real estate.
  If you need legal, tax or other advice, consult with a professional in
 that field.
  DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS
  SELLER'S AGENT
  A  seller's  agent is an agent who is engaged by a seller to represent
 the seller's interests. The seller's agent does this by securing a buyer
 for the seller's home at a price and on terms acceptable to the  seller.
 A seller's agent has, without limitation, the following fiduciary duties
 to the seller: reasonable care, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full
 disclosure,  obedience  and  duty  to account. A seller's agent does not
 represent the interests of the buyer.  The  obligations  of  a  seller's
 agent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in an agree-
 ment  between  the  agent  and the seller. In dealings with the buyer, a
 seller's agent should (a) exercise reasonable skill and care in perform-
 ance of the agent's duties; (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good faith;
 and (c) disclose all facts known to the agent materially  affecting  the
 value or desirability of property, except as otherwise provided by law.
  BUYER'S AGENT
  A buyer's agent is an agent who is engaged by a buyer to represent the
 buyer's  interests.  The  buyer's  agent  does  this  by negotiating the
 purchase of a home at a price and on terms acceptable to  the  buyer.  A
 buyer's agent has, without limitation, the following fiduciary duties to
 the  buyer:  reasonable  care,  undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full
 disclosure, obedience and duty to account.  A  buyer's  agent  does  not
 represent  the  interests  of  the  seller. The obligations of a buyer's
 agent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in [an]  THE
 REPRESENTATION agreement between the agent and the buyer. SUCH REPRESEN-
 TATION  AGREEMENT  MUST  BE  ENTERED  INTO  PRIOR  TO  WHEN THE OFFER TO
 A. 9823  5
 
 PURCHASE IS MADE TO THE SELLER OR SELLER'S AGENT. In dealings  with  the
 seller, a buyer's agent should (a) exercise reasonable skill and care in
 performance of the agent's duties; (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good
 faith;  and (c) disclose all facts known to the agent materially affect-
 ing the buyer's ability and/or willingness  to  perform  a  contract  to
 acquire  seller's  property  that  are not inconsistent with the agent's
 fiduciary duties to the buyer.
  BROKER'S AGENTS
  A broker's agent is an agent that cooperates or is engaged by a  list-
 ing agent or a buyer's agent (but does not work for the same firm as the
 listing  agent  or buyer's agent) to assist the listing agent or buyer's
 agent in locating a property to sell or buy, respectively, for the list-
 ing agent's seller or the buyer agent's buyer. The broker's  agent  does
 not have a direct relationship with the buyer or seller and the buyer or
 seller  can  not  provide  instructions  or  direction  directly  to the
 broker's agent. The buyer and the seller therefore do not have vicarious
 liability for the acts of the  broker's  agent.  The  listing  agent  or
 buyer's agent do provide direction and instruction to the broker's agent
 and therefore the listing agent or buyer's agent will have liability for
 the acts of the broker's agent.
  [DUAL AGENT
  A  real  estate  broker may represent both the buyer and the seller if
 both the buyer and seller give their informed  consent  in  writing.  In
 such  a dual agency situation, the agent will not be able to provide the
 full range of fiduciary duties to the buyer and seller. The  obligations
 of  an agent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in an
 agreement between the agent, and the buyer and seller. An  agent  acting
 as a dual agent must explain carefully to both the buyer and seller that
 the  agent  is acting for the other party as well. The agent should also
 explain the possible effects of dual representation, including  that  by
 consenting  to  the  dual  agency  relationship the buyer and seller are
 giving up their right to undivided loyalty. A  buyer  or  seller  should
 carefully  consider the possible consequences of a dual agency relation-
 ship before agreeing to such  representation.  A  seller  or  buyer  may
 provide  advance  informed consent to dual agency by indicating the same
 on this form.]
  DUAL AGENT
  WITH
  DESIGNATED SALES AGENTS
  If the buyer and the seller provide their informed consent in writing,
 the principals and the real estate broker who represents both parties as
 a dual agent may designate a sales agent  to  represent  the  buyer  and
 another  sales  agent  to represent the seller to negotiate the purchase
 and sale of real estate. A sales agent works under  the  supervision  of
 the  real  estate broker. With the informed consent of the buyer and the
 seller in writing, the designated sales agent for the buyer  will  func-
 tion  as  the buyer's agent representing the interests of and advocating
 on behalf of the buyer and the designated sales  agent  for  the  seller
 will  function  as  the seller's agent representing the interests of and
 advocating on behalf of the seller in the negotiations between the buyer
 and seller. A designated sales agent cannot provide the  full  range  of
 fiduciary duties to the buyer or seller. The designated sales agent must
 explain  that like the dual agent under whose supervision they function,
 they cannot provide undivided loyalty. A buyer or seller should careful-
 ly consider the possible consequences of a dual agency relationship with
 designated sales agents before agreeing to such representation. A seller
 A. 9823  6
 
 or buyer may provide advance informed consent to dual agency with desig-
 nated sales agents by indicating the same on this form.
 
  This  form  was  provided to me by ____________________ (print name of

 disclosure form:
  NEW YORK STATE DISCLOSURE FORM
  FOR
  LANDLORD AND TENANT
 
  THIS IS NOT A CONTRACT
  New York state law requires real estate licensees who  are  acting  as
 agents of landlords and tenants of real property to advise the potential
 landlords  and tenants with whom they work of the nature of their agency
 relationship and the rights and obligations it creates. This  disclosure
 will  help you to make informed choices about your relationship with the
 real estate broker and its sales agents.
  Throughout the transaction you may receive more  than  one  disclosure
 form.  The  law  may  require each agent assisting in the transaction to
 present you with this disclosure form. A real estate agent is  a  person
 qualified  to  advise about real estate. If you need legal, tax or other
 advice, consult with a professional in that field.

  DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS
  LANDLORD'S AGENT
 
  A landlord's agent is an agent who is engaged by a landlord to  repre-
 sent the landlord's interest. The landlord's agent does this by securing
 a  tenant  for  the landlord's apartment or house at a rent and on terms
 acceptable to the landlord. A landlord's agent has, without  limitation,
 A. 9823  7
 
 the  following  fiduciary duties to the landlord: reasonable care, undi-
 vided loyalty, confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and  duty  to
 account.  A  landlord's  agent  does  not represent the interests of the
 tenant.  The  obligations  of a landlord's agent are also subject to any
 specific provisions set forth in an agreement between the agent and  the
 landlord.  In  dealings  with  the tenant, a landlord's agent should (a)
 exercise reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties;
 (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good faith; and (c) disclose all  facts
 known  to  the  agent  materially affecting the value or desirability of
 property, except as otherwise provided by law.
 
  TENANT'S AGENT
 
  A tenant's agent is an agent who is engaged by a tenant  to  represent
 the  tenant's  interest. The tenant's agent does this by negotiating the
 rental or lease of an apartment or house at a rent and on terms accepta-
 ble to the tenant. A tenant's agent has, without limitation, the follow-
 ing fiduciary duties to the tenant: reasonable care, undivided  loyalty,
 confidentiality,  full  disclosure,  obedience  and  duty  to account. A
 tenant's agent does not represent the  interest  of  the  landlord.  The
 obligations  of  a  tenant's  agent  are  also  subject  to any specific
 provisions set forth in [an] THE REPRESENTATION  agreement  between  the
 agent and the tenant. SUCH REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ENTERED INTO
 PRIOR  TO  OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TENANT'S AGENT SHOWS ANY PROPERTY TO
 THE TENANT FOR THE FIRST TIME. In dealings with the landlord, a tenant's
 agent should (a) exercise reasonable skill and care  in  performance  of
 the agent's duties; (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good faith; and (c)
 disclose  all facts known to the  tenant's ability and/or willingness to
 perform a contract to rent or lease landlord's  property  that  are  not
 inconsistent with the agent's fiduciary duties to the buyer.

  BROKER'S AGENTS
 
  A  broker's agent is an agent that cooperates or is engaged by a list-
 ing agent or a tenant's agent (but does not work for the  same  firm  as
 the  listing  agent  or  tenant's  agent) to assist the listing agent or
 tenant's agent in locating a property to rent or lease for  the  listing
 agent's  landlord  or the tenant agent's tenant. The broker's agent does
 not have a direct relationship with  the  tenant  or  landlord  and  the
 tenant or landlord can not provide instructions or direction directly to
 the  broker's  agent.  The tenant and the landlord therefore do not have
 vicarious liability for the acts of  the  broker's  agent.  The  listing
 agent  or  tenant's  agent  do  provide direction and instruction to the
 broker's agent and therefore the listing agent or  tenant's  agent  will
 have liability for the acts of the broker's agent.
 
  [DUAL AGENT

  A real estate broker may represent both the tenant and the landlord if
 both  the tenant and landlord give their informed consent in writing. In
 such a dual agency situation, the agent will not be able to provide  the
 full range of fiduciary duties to the landlord and the tenant. The obli-
 gations  of  an  agent  are  also subject to any specific provisions set
 forth in an agreement between the agent, and the tenant and landlord. An
 agent acting as a dual agent must explain carefully to both the landlord
 and tenant that the agent is acting for the other  party  as  well.  The
 A. 9823  8

 agent  should  also explain the possible effects of dual representation,
 including that by consenting to the dual agency relationship  the  land-
 lord  and tenant are giving up their right to undivided loyalty. A land-
 lord and tenant should carefully consider the possible consequences of a
 dual  agency  relationship  before  agreeing to such representation.  A
 landlord or tenant may provide advance informed consent to  dual  agency
 by indicating the same on this form.]
 
  DUAL AGENT
  WITH
  DESIGNATED SALES AGENTS
 
  If the tenant and the landlord provide their informed consent in writ-
 ing,  the  principals  and  the  real  estate broker who represents both
 parties as a dual agent may designate a sales  agent  to  represent  the
 tenant  and another sales agent to represent the landlord. A sales agent
 works under the supervision of the real estate broker. With the informed
 consent in writing of the tenant and the landlord, the designated  sales
 agent  for  the  tenant will function as the tenant's agent representing
 the interests of and advocating on behalf of the tenant and  the  desig-
 nated sales agent for the landlord will function as the landlord's agent
 representing  the  interests of and advocating on behalf of the landlord
 in the negotiations between the tenant and the  landlord.  A  designated
 sales  agent  cannot  provide  the full range of fiduciary duties to the
 landlord or tenant. The designated sales agent must  explain  that  like
 the  dual  agent  under  whose  supervision  they  function, they cannot
 provide undivided loyalty. A landlord or tenant should carefully consid-
 er the possible consequences of a dual agency relationship  with  desig-
 nated  sales  agents before agreeing to such representation.  A landlord
 or tenant may provide advance  informed  consent  to  dual  agency  with
 designated sales agents by indicating the same on this form.
