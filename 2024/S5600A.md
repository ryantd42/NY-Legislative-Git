  (a) Each electric corporation subject to section twenty-five-a of this
 chapter shall annually, on or before December fifteenth, submit  to  the
 commission an emergency response plan for review and approval. The emer-
 gency response plan shall be designed for the reasonably prompt restora-
 tion  of service in the case of an emergency event, defined for purposes
 of this subdivision as an event where widespread outages  have  occurred

 SION. IN ESTABLISHING SUCH TIME-BASED RESTORATION SCHEDULES, THE COMMIS-
 SION SHOULD UTILIZE BENCHMARKS FOR  THE  RESTORATION  OF  SERVICE  WHICH
 INCLUDE,  BUT  ARE  NOT LIMITED TO, THE PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS RESTORED
 WITHIN EACH TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR INTERVAL FOLLOWING THE STORM AND  CONSIDER-

 sary  for  an  individual  whose diagnosis is likely to be significantly
 triggered or significantly exacerbated by a continued loss of power that
 will adversely impact that individual's health; (iv)  identification  of
 and outreach plans to customers who had documented their need for essen-
 tial electricity to provide critical telecommunications, critical trans-
 portation,  critical  fuel  distribution  services  or  other large-load
 customers identified by the commission; (v) designation of company staff
 to communicate with local officials and appropriate regulatory agencies;
 (vi) provisions regarding how the company will assure the safety of  its
 employees  and  contractors;  (vii) procedures for deploying company and
 mutual aid crews to work  assignment  areas;  (viii)  identification  of
 additional  supplies  and equipment needed during an emergency; (ix) the
 means of obtaining additional supplies and equipment; (x) procedures  to
 practice  the  emergency  response plan; (xi) appropriate safety precau-
 tions regarding electrical hazards, including plans to  promptly  secure
 downed  wires within thirty-six hours of notification of the location of
 such downed wires from  a  municipal  emergency  official;  (xii)  plans
 setting  forth how the communication and coordination of efforts between
 the  electric  corporation,  electric  corporation  employees,  electric
 corporation  company  crews,  mutual  aid  crews, other utilities, local
 governments and any other entity  performing  services  to  assist  such
 electric  corporation  shall  occur;  and  (xiii)  such other additional
 information as the commission may require.  Each such corporation shall,
 on an annual basis, undertake drills implementing procedures to practice
 its emergency management  plan.  The  commission  may  adopt  additional
 requirements  consistent with ensuring the reasonably prompt restoration
 of service in the case of an emergency event.

 manner as chapter 743 of the laws of 2022, takes effect.
