  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative purpose and findings.  The  legislature  hereby
 finds and declares as follows:
  (a)  New  York  state  is currently facing a severe housing crisis for
 people with developmental disabilities. Staffing shortages for certified
 housing, commonly referred to as group homes, has put  additional  pres-
 sure  on the state to provide alternative and innovative housing models,
 especially for those persons who are able to live more independently and
 wish to do so.
  (b) Many persons with developmental disabilities live with a parent or
 parents, a family member, or other  similar  direct  support  personnel.
 However, many such persons wish to live more independently, and would do
 so if an option existed that included certain appropriate supports.
  (c)  Further,  although  family  caregiving  is  appropriate  in  many
 instances, parents and similar direct support personnel  may  eventually
 become  unable to continue supporting the person who has a developmental

 disability, due to the direct support personnel's infirmity,  death,  or
 other concerns.
  (d)  Accordingly, there is a need to create new and innovative housing
 models that maximize independence for persons with  developmental  disa-
 bilities.  The  state should provide more independent housing options to
 persons with developmental disabilities, where such persons wish and are
 able to take advantage of such opportunities.
  (e) Thus, to maximize the availability of innovative housing settings,
 this legislation directs the office for people with developmental  disa-
 bilities  ("OPWDD")  to  create  an  Innovative  Housing Initiative that
 enables persons with developmental disabilities to live  more  independ-
 ently,  including  housing  that is owned or leased in their name, or by
 someone else on behalf of such person or that of a trust established for
 their benefit, with supports provided through OPWDD, such as availabili-
 ty of shared direct support personnel. In  this  way,  OPWDD  will  help
 ensure  that  persons  with  developmental  disabilities  are  afforded
 settings that are the most integrated and appropriate for their needs.
  § 2. The mental hygiene law is amended by adding a new  section  16.38
 to read as follows:
 § 16.38 INNOVATIVE HOUSING INITIATIVE.
  (A) THE OFFICE SHALL ENABLE PERSONS WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY TO
 LIVE  INDEPENDENTLY IN A RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT, WITH SUPPORT SERVICES,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STAFFING SUPPORT, SHARED STAFFING  SUPPORT,
 AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND RECREATION.
  (B)  SUCH RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT MAY BE COMPRISED OF A SINGLE HOUSING
 UNIT OR MULTIPLE UNITS OF HOUSING, IN ONE OR MORE  BUILDINGS,  INCLUDING
 BUT  NOT  LIMITED TO: (I) LEASED RESIDENTIAL HOUSING UNITS; (II) HOUSING
 THAT QUALIFIES AS A COOPERATIVE INTEREST IN REALTY UNDER  SECTION  THREE
 HUNDRED  FIFTY-TWO-E  OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS LAW; AND (III) CONDOMINIUM
 UNITS UNDER ARTICLE NINE-B OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW.  THE  INTEREST  IN
 SUCH RESIDENTIAL UNIT MAY BE LEASED OR OWNED BY A PERSON WITH A DEVELOP-
 MENTAL  DISABILITY, OR AN ENTITY ON BEHALF OF SUCH PERSON, INCLUDING BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO A TRUST ESTABLISHED FOR SUCH PERSON'S BENEFIT.  EACH UNIT
 OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSING MAY BE OCCUPIED BY NO MORE  THAN  THE  NUMBER  OF
 UNRELATED PERSONS PERMITTED BY LOCAL LAW.
  (C)  THE  SELECTION  OF  THE  RESIDENTIAL  ENVIRONMENT,  THE PERSON OR
 PERSONS WITH WHOM THEY LIVE AND THE DETERMINATION THAT  THEY  MAY  INDE-
 PENDENTLY  LIVE  IN SUCH RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT, WITH SUPPORT SERVICES,
 SHALL BE MADE SOLELY BY SUCH PERSON WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY  AND
 THEIR QUALIFIED REPRESENTATIVE.
  (D) IN RECOGNITION OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL'S EXPERIENCE
 SHALL DETERMINE WHETHER A RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT IS THE MOST INTEGRATED
 AND  APPROPRIATE  FOR THE NEEDS OF THE PERSON WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISA-
 BILITY, IN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY  FOR  ANY  HOUSING  PROGRAM,  SUPPORT
 SERVICES OR OTHER BENEFITS, THE OFFICE SHALL:
  (1)  HONOR  THE RIGHT OF THE PERSON WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY TO
 CHOOSE THE RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT AND WITH WHOM THEY MAY LIVE;
