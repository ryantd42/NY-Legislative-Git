 in  the  coverage of the insurance contract as if they were employees by
 any such corporation filing with the  insurance  carrier,  upon  a  form
 prescribed  by  the  chair  of the workers' compensation board, a notice
 that  the  corporation elects to bring one or more executive officers of
 such corporation named in the notice within the coverage of  this  chap-
 ter.  Such  election  shall  be  effective  with respect to all policies
 issued to such corporation by such insurance carrier as long as it shall
 continuously insure the corporation. If such  election  is  revoked,  it
 shall be in writing on a form prescribed by the chair and filed with the
 chair  and  with  the  insurance carrier and a copy thereof furnished to
 each officer as to whom such  revocation  is  applicable,  upon  a  form

 payments  into the special funds provided in this chapter as in the case
 of an employee. The executive officers who may  be  brought  within  the

 ration who at all times during the period involved between them owns all

 ration  who at all times during the period involved between them own all
