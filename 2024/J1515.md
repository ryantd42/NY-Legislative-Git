  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2024, as Turner Syndrome Awareness Month in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and fully  in  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2024,  as  Turner
Syndrome  Awareness  Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with
National Turner Syndrome Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Turner Syndrome is the second most common genetic disorder,
affecting 1 in 2,000 females; over 1,000 baby girls are  born  with  the
Syndrome annually; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Discovered in 1938 by Dr. Henry Turner, Turner Syndrome is
a genetic condition that can only affect females in which she  does  not
have  the  usual  pair of two X sex chromosomes; instead of the usual 46
chromosomes a person is born with, those with Turner Syndrome have cells
that are missing all or part of an X chromosome; and
 
  WHEREAS, In about half of all individuals with Turner Syndrome,  the
affected  female  has  only  one  X  chromosome;  others  may have two X
chromosomes, but one is incomplete; and  sometimes  a  female  has  some
cells with two X chromosomes, but other cells have only one; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ultimately,  the  specific  cause  of  Turner  Syndrome is
unknown because the gene on the X chromosome  that  is  responsible  for
most  of  the  features  of  the  chromosomal  disorder is undetermined;
however, researchers have been able to identify the gene responsible for
short stature and  skeletal  abnormalities,  which  is  the  SHOX  gene,
important for bone development and growth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  signs  of Turner Syndrome should be detected during a
girl's first few years of  life  for  the  best  possible  outcomes  for
treatment; a variety of signs allude to the possibility of an individual
having  this  condition,  such  as  a  short  stature  and  frequent ear
infections, which should signal the need for diagnostic testing for  the
disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There are many health concerns associated with a diagnosis
of  Turner  Syndrome,  including:  potentially  fatal  cardiovascular
diseases;  reduced  cognitive function; educational issues consisting of
difficulty with visual spatial tasks,  memory,  attention,  as  well  as
other  learning disabilities; risk of ovarian failure; type II diabetes;
hyporthyroidism;  psychological  issues  like  low  self-esteem,
predisposition  to  age-specific  problems,  isolation,  depression;
pregnancy complications; and  hearing  issues,  along  with  many  other
complications; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Symptoms  that  are  prevalent  among  females with Turner
Syndrome often go untreated because  of  lack  of  education  about  the
signs,  symptoms  and  possible treatments to improve overall quality of
life outcomes;  by  spreading  awareness  about  this  condition,  those
affected  by Turner Syndrome may be treated earlier to produce long-term
positive outcomes for the patient; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 2008, the Turner  Syndrome  Foundation  supports
research  initiatives and facilitates educational programs that increase
professional awareness and enhance medical care  of  those  affected  by
Turner Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2024, as Turner
Syndrome Awareness Month in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with
National Turner Syndrome Awareness Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York and the Turner Syndrome Foundation.
