 Introduced by M. of A. THIELE -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Local Governments
 
 AN  ACT to amend the county law, in relation to establishing a procedure
  for the creation of new counties
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative findings. It is hereby found by the legislature
 that  section 2 of article 9 of the state constitution provides that the
 legislature shall provide for the creation  and  organization  of  local
 governments  in  the state of New York. The state has established proce-
 dures for the creation of villages, towns, and for municipal annexation.
 However, it has not established procedures for the creation of counties.
  The legislature is committed to the establishment of local  government
 that  is more cost effective, more efficient, and more responsive to the
 needs and desires of those residents being served. Therefore, the legis-
 lature finds that it is in the best interests of the state of  New  York
 to  establish  a  procedure for the creation of new counties where it is
 feasible and in the best interest  of  the  governed.  This  legislation
 would create such a procedure.
  §  2. The county law is amended by adding a new article 1-A to read as
 follows:
  ARTICLE 1-A
  CREATION OF NEW COUNTIES
 SECTION 10. POPULATION AND AREA REQUIREMENTS.
  11. FEASIBILITY STUDY.

  14. DECISION OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER.
  15. REFERENDUM.
  16. EFFECTIVE DATE; TRANSITION PERIOD.
  17. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
