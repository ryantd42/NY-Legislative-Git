  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May  5-11,  2024,  as  Correctional  Officers  and
  Employees Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  operation  of  correctional  facilities  represents a
crucial component of the criminal justice system in the  United  States,
and correctional personnel play a vital role in protecting the rights of
the public to be safeguarded from criminal activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are over 16,178 corrections officers and employees in
the  State  of New York who oversee the State's correctional facilities,
along with over 6,109 correction officers and employees in the  City  of
New York who oversee the City's correctional facilities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  officers gallantly report to work every day and are
responsible for the care, custody, and maintenance of more  than  31,329
inmates  charged  to  their care in the State of New York, and more than
6,100 inmates charged to their care in the City of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the course of their duties,  corrections  officers  work
under physically and mentally demanding circumstances and face danger in
their  daily work lives, often protecting society from some of the worst
offenders and criminals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Corrections  officers  truly  exemplify  bravery  and  an
unwavering  commitment  to  their  community  and State, and deserve the
utmost respect and appreciation from the people  of  the  State  of  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1984, former President Ronald Reagan signed Proclamation
5187,  which  designated  the  first  full  week  in  May  as  "National
Correctional Officers Week" in honor of  corrections  officers  who  put
their  lives  on the line every day to protect the public from dangerous
criminals and to help prisoners work toward becoming productive  members
of society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  recognizes  the  indispensable
contributions that corrections officers make every day  to  protect  our
citizens  from  harm,  and honor all corrections officers and employees;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  5-11,  2024, as
Correctional Officers and Employees Week in the State of New  York;  and

  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to any and all groups throughout New York that represent and
