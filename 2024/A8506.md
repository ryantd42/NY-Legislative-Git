 state  division  of housing and community renewal within one year of the

 previously  alleged  to have been substantially rehabilitated before the
 effective date of the chapter of the laws of two  thousand  twenty-three
 that  amended this paragraph, within six months of such effective date,]

 purposes of determining the status  of  any  apartment  under  the  rent
 stabilization law[;
 A. 8506  3

  (b)  With  respect  to  the  calculation of legal rents for the period
 either prior to or subsequent to June 14, 2019, an owner shall be deemed
 to have committed fraud if the owner shall  have  committed  a  material
 breach  of  any  duty, arising under statutory, administrative or common
 law, to disclose truthfully to any tenant, government agency or judicial
 or administrative tribunal, the rent, regulatory status, or lease infor-
 mation,  for  purposes  of claiming an unlawful rent or claiming to have
 deregulated an apartment, whether or not the owner's  conduct  would  be
 considered  fraud under the common law, and whether or not a complaining
 tenant specifically relied on untruthful  or  misleading  statements  in
 registrations,  leases,  or other documents. The following conduct shall
 be presumed to have been the product of such  fraud:  (1)  the  unlawful
 deregulation  of  any  apartment, including such deregulation as results
 from claiming an unlawful increase such as would have brought  the  rent
 over the deregulation threshold that existed under prior law, unless the
 landlord  can  prove  good faith reliance on a directive or ruling by an
 administrative agency or court; or (2) beginning October 1, 2011,  fail-
 ing to register, as rent stabilized, any apartment in a building receiv-
 ing  J-51 or 421-a benefits.] OR FOR SUCH OTHER PURPOSES PERMITTED UNDER
 LAW OR THE REGULATIONS OF THE NEW YORK STATE  DIVISION  OF  HOUSING  AND
 COMMUNITY RENEWAL.

 PROCEEDING  BEFORE  A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION OR THE STATE DIVI-
 SION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL, A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION
 OR THE STATE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  RENEWAL  SHALL  ISSUE  A

 LENT SCHEME AFTER A CONSIDERATION OF THE TOTALITY OF THE  CIRCUMSTANCES.
 IN  MAKING  SUCH DETERMINATION, THE COURT OR THE DIVISION SHALL CONSIDER
 ALL OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND ALL APPLICABLE  STATUTORY  AND  REGULATORY
 LAW AND CONTROLLING AUTHORITIES, PROVIDED THAT THERE NEED NOT BE A FIND-
 ING  THAT ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF COMMON LAW FRAUD, INCLUDING EVIDENCE OF
 A MISREPRESENTATION OF MATERIAL FACT, FALSITY,  SCIENTER,  RELIANCE  AND
 INJURY,  WERE  SATISFIED IN ORDER TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT A FRAUDU-

 CIRCUMSTANCES NONETHELESS INDICATE THAT SUCH FRAUDULENT SCHEME TO DEREG-
 ULATE A UNIT WAS COMMITTED.
