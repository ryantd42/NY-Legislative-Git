 been December 22, 2014.

 their deceased husband. The amount paid to Robin Garfinkle shall be less
 any  sums  previously  paid  by  the New York State and Local Retirement
 System to any beneficiary of Howard Mahler.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of  approximately  $1.21  million
 which will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
