 AN ACT authorizing the Ministerio Sion New York, Inc.  to  retroactively
  apply for a real property tax exemption for certain property
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the Ministerio Sion New York, Inc. an  application  for  exemption  from
 real  property  taxes  pursuant  to section 420-a and section 462 of the
 real property tax law with respect to the 2022-2023 assessment roll  for
 the 2022-2023 school and the 2023 general taxes, for the parcel conveyed
 to  such organization, with such parcel having an address of 97 New Hyde
 Park Road in the hamlet of Franklin Square, town of Hempstead, county of
 Nassau.  If accepted, the application shall be reviewed  as  if  it  had
 been  received on or before the taxable status date established for such
 rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  of the Nassau County legislature, may grant exemption from all
 taxation and make appropriate corrections to the subject rolls. If  such
 exemption  is  granted and such organization, therefore, shall have paid
 any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the applicable governing body
 or tax department may, in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of
 those taxes paid and cancel those taxes, fines, penalties, liens, inter-
 est or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
