  COMMEMORATING  the 95th Anniversary of The Stanley
  Theatre in Utica, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Theatrical  institutions,  and  the  many  social  and
educational  benefits  they confer, play a vital role in the development
of their neighborhoods; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  those  artistic  landmarks  which  have  brought  outstanding
entertainment and cultural enrichment to the citizens of the great State
of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 95th Anniversary of The Stanley Theatre  in  Utica,  New
York, to be celebrated at a 1920s-themed anniversary party on October 5,
2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The anniversary party for The Stanley Theatre will feature
music by The Fabulous Mojos, hors d'oeuvre food stations, basket raffles
provided by local businesses, and other festivities  to  celebrate  this
auspicious occasion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  nearly a century, The Stanley Theatre has brought the
Utica community together with live concerts, Broadway  shows,  musicals,
ballets,  movies, graduation ceremonies and recitals; today, The Stanley
Theatre operates as a not-for-profit organization run by the Central New
York Community Arts Council; and
 
  WHEREAS, Opening to the public on September 10,  1928,  The  Stanley
Theatre  was  designed by Thomas Lamb, a renowned theatre architect, for
the Mastbaum chain of theatres; the 2,963-seat theatre was  named  after
one of the Mastbaum brothers, Stanley; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originally built as a movie theatre, the "Mexican baroque"
inspired theatre blends unique styles  with  a  terra  cotta  and  tiled
mosaic  exterior,  and  Hapsburg Lions, the faces of indigenous peoples,
and a beautiful collection of cherubs gracing the "gold-leaf"  interior;
the seats and most of the interior have been refurnished recently to its
original condition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Stanley Theatre was purchased by the Central New York
Community Arts Council, Inc. in 1974 and since then, over  $5.5  million
has  been  spent  on  its  magnificent  restoration;  all  mechanical,
electrical, and safety systems are continuously upgraded to  accommodate
the many touring shows; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are four major local presenters that use the Stanley:
the  Broadway Theatre League; the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute
Great Artists Series; the  Utica  Symphony  Orchestra;  and  the  Mohawk
Valley Ballet; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  a  staple for the arts in the community, recent
events at  The  Stanley  Theatre  include  Indigo  Girls,  Jesus  Christ
Superstar,  Saturday  Night  Fever, Itzhak Perlman, Canadian Brass, Judy
Collins, Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, Spirit of the Dance, B.B. King,
Trey  Anastasio, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and Jerry
Seinfeld; and
 
  WHEREAS, Serving many purposes, the elegant Stanley Theatre  lobbies
hold  receptions  and  meetings  throughout the year and the Theatre has
also become  a  local  tradition  for  wedding  parties  to  have  their
photographs  taken  on  the  grand  staircases  in the lobby, said to be
inspired by the Titanic; and
 
  WHEREAS, A vibrant arts community encourages collaboration, instills
local pride, draws people together, and is essential  to  a  community's
vitality;  over  the  past  95  years,  The  Stanley Theatre has greatly
contributed to the richness of New York's cultural palette; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that when artistic
societies of such noble aims and  accomplishments  are  brought  to  our
attention,  they  should be recognized by all the citizens of this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  95th  Anniversary of The Stanley Theatre in Utica, New
York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to The Stanley Theatre, Utica, New York.
