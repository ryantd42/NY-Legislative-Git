Assembly Resolution No. 224
 
BY: M. of A. Barclay
 
  AMENDING  section  2  of  Rule  IV of the Assembly
  rules, in relation to committee agendas
 
  RESOLVED, That section 2 of Rule IV of the Assembly rules is amended
to read as follows:
 
  §  2.  Meetings  of  standing  committees.  a.  Meetings  of  standing
committees.  Standing committees shall hold meetings at a regular weekly
time  and  day as scheduled by the committee chairperson in consultation
with the committee coordinators, as designated by the Speaker, and  such
set  time  shall  be posted on the Assembly committee board and Assembly
Internet site. The weekly committee  schedule  shall  be  available  the
preceding Thursday, as provided for in subdivision b of this section. If
on  the  first  Tuesday of any month of the regular legislative session,
excluding January, a standing committee shall  have  50  or  more  bills
pending  committee  action,  such committee shall be required to meet at
least once during such month to consider legislation.
 
  b. Each chairperson of a standing committee shall, by the Thursday  of
the  week  preceding,  furnish to the Speaker, the Majority and Minority
Leaders, and make available in written  or  electronic  format  to  each
member of such committee, a copy of the agenda of all meetings scheduled
for  the  following  week,  together  with  a  copy  of the introducer's
memorandum  for  each  bill  listed  on  such  agenda.  Further,  each
chairperson  shall  furnish  to  the  Speaker, the Majority and Minority
Leaders and to the ranking minority member of such committee, a list  of
all  bills  referred  to  such committee to date together with the above
agenda and memoranda. In addition, copies of such agenda shall  be  made
available  not  later  than such Thursday to representatives of the news
media and  to  the  general  public  by  the  filing  thereof  with  the
Legislative  Library  and  the  Assembly  Public Information Office, and
shall  be  made  available  on  the  Assembly  Internet  site  and  the
Legislative Retrieval System.  The notice provisions of this subdivision
and  of subdivision c shall not apply to the Committee on Rules. Nothing
contained in this subdivision shall  be  deemed  to  waive  any  of  the
provisions  of  article  seven  of  the Public Officers Law known as the
"Open Meetings Law".
 
  c. The chairperson of a standing committee may call a special  meeting
or  add  or  delete  items  on the agenda of a regular meeting by giving
twenty-four hour notice of the agenda of such special  meeting  or  such
additions  or  deletions  in  the  same manner and to the same extent as
notice of agenda for regular  meetings,  provided,  however,  that  such
notice shall not be required if a message of necessity has been received
from the governor in connection with the bill under consideration or the
ranking minority member of the committee consents thereto.
 
  d. All standing committee meetings shall be open to representatives of
the  news  media  and  general public, except that the committee, upon a
two-thirds vote of the members  of  the  committee  present  or  upon  a
majority vote of the total membership of the committee, whichever is the
greater,  may  hold  an  executive session at which only members of such
committee shall be in attendance. The subjects to be acted upon  at  the
 
executive session shall be limited to the subjects enumerated in section
one hundred five of the Public Officers Law. No bill shall be voted upon
at  such  executive  session. No committee shall vote to report any bill
unless  a  majority  of all the members thereof is actually present. The
affirmative vote of a  majority  of  all  the  members  appointed  to  a
standing committee shall be necessary to every report. The negative vote
of  such a majority shall be necessary to defeat a bill in committee. No
proxy vote shall be valid.
 
  e. No bill shall be removed from a committee agenda once a  motion  to
consider the bill has been made.
  f.  At  the  conclusion  of a committee meeting the committee clerk of
such committee shall deliver to the Office of Journal Operations and the
ranking minority member of such committee a roll call  on  each  of  the
bills  considered by the committee and on each vote to hold an executive
session indicating the attendance of the members and the ayes and  nays.
Such  roll  call  shall  be  reproduced  not  later  than 24 hours after
transmittal to such Office and shall be made available for inspection by
the general public and representatives of the news media in the Assembly
Public  Information  Office,  the  Assembly  Internet  site  and  the
Legislative Retrieval System.
 
  [f.] g. The report of a committee upon any matter referred to it other
than  a bill, may include a brief statement of the opinion of any member
or members of the committee voting in either the majority or minority.
 
  [g.] h. The audio and/or video broadcast of committee  meetings  shall
be  made  available  on the Assembly Internet site when practicable, and
shall be  subject  to  the  same  requirements  as  apply  to  televised
proceedings of Assembly sessions pursuant to Rule X.
