  Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature hereby finds and
 determines that pursuant to a bond resolution dated  February  19,  2019
 adopted  by  the  common council of the city of Buffalo, county of Erie,
 (the "common council" and the "city" respectively) the city issued bonds
 in  the  principal  amount  of  $1,100,000  to  finance  the  cost  of
 construction  of  a  new  police shooting range. The legislature further
 finds and determines that said resolution failed to include language  to
 identify the accurate address within the city in which such construction
 of a new police shooting range is intended to be made.
  § 2. Notwithstanding the defects described in section one of this act,
 the  object  or  purposes  for  which  said bonds were issued are hereby
 deemed to be for the construction of a new police shooting range  to  be
 located  at  379 Paderewski Drive in the city of Buffalo as mentioned in
 the aforesaid resolution and the expenditure of the $1,100,000  proceeds
 of  such  bonds for such objects or purposes is hereby authorized, vali-
 dated, confirmed and ratified.
  § 3. The authorization provided in section two of this act  shall  not
 take  effect  until  the  common council of the city of Buffalo adopts a
 resolution after the effective date of this act that shall be subject to
 permissive referendum pursuant to section 23-11 of the  charter  of  the
 city  of  Buffalo as if the council had not already created a city debt.
 In the event a successful petition is filed with  the  city  clerk,  the
 authorization  provided in section two of this act shall not take effect
 unless such resolution is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority
 of the qualified electors.
  § 4. Separability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part
 of this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction  to
 be  invalid,  such  judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the
