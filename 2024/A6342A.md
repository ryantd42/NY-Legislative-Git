 of an incarcerated individual or a person described in subdivision a  of

 cerated individual or person described in such subdivision  a  that  may

 incurred in the performance and discharge of duty, unless  the  contrary

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would allow members of the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees' Retirement System employed as safety officers to be eligible for  a
 performance  of duty (POD) disability benefit if they become disabled as
 a result of an injury inflicted by any person confined in an institution
 under the jurisdiction of the New York State Office  of  Mental  Health.
 The  benefit  will  be 75 percent of final average salary, less workers'
 compensation.  Currently, these affected members do not have a POD disa-
 bility benefit.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately $1.10  million  in
 the  annual  contributions  of the State of New York for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future  years  this  cost  will  vary  but  is
 expected to average 1.7% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $5.78 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
  These estimated costs are based on 611 affected  members  employed  by
 the  State  of New York, with annual salary of approximately $54 million
 as of March 31, 2023.
