  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 607-a of the retirement and social security law, as

 OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN, who becomes physically or mentally
 incapacitated for the performance of duties as the natural and proximate
 result,  of  an injury, sustained in the performance or discharge of his
 or her duties by, or as the natural and proximate result of, an  act  of

 have  involved transmission of a specified transmissible disease from an

 incurred  in  the performance and discharge of duty, unless the contrary
 be proved by competent evidence.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow members of the New York State and Local  Employ-
 ees'  Retirement System employed as safety officers to be eligible for a
 performance of duty (POD) disability benefit if they become disabled  as
 a result of an injury inflicted by any person confined in an institution
 under  the  jurisdiction  of the New York State Office of Mental Health.
 The benefit will be 75 percent of final average  salary,  less  workers'
 compensation.  Currently, these affected members do not have a POD disa-
 bility benefit.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $680,000  in  the
 annual contributions of the State of New York for the fiscal year ending
 March  31,  2024.  In  future  years, this cost will vary as the billing
 rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $5.08 million which will
 be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
  These  estimated  costs  are based on 587 affected members employed by
 the State of New York, with annual salary of approximately  $48  million
 as of March 31, 2022.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the impact

 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the
