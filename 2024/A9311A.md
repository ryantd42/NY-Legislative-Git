 AN  ACT  to amend the cannabis law, in relation to employment at certain
  licensees for the purposes of parole conditions
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 6 of section 127 of the cannabis law is amended
 to read as follows:
  6.  (A)  A  person  currently  under  parole, probation or other state
 supervision, or released on recognizance,  non-monetary  conditions,  or
 bail prior to being convicted, shall not be punished or otherwise penal-
 ized  for conduct allowed under this chapter unless the terms and condi-
 tions of said parole, probation, or state supervision explicitly prohib-
 it a person's cannabis use or any other conduct otherwise allowed  under
 this  chapter.  A person's use of cannabis or conduct under this chapter
 shall not be prohibited unless it has been shown by clear and convincing
 evidence that the prohibition is reasonably related  to  the  underlying
 crime.  Nothing  in this provision shall restrict the rights of a certi-
 fied medical patient.
  (B) A PERSON CURRENTLY, OR PROSPECTIVELY, UNDER PAROLE,  PROBATION  OR
 OTHER STATE SUPERVISION, WHO AS A CONDITION OF SUCH PAROLE, PROBATION OR
 OTHER  STATE  SUPERVISION  IS  REQUIRED TO BE EMPLOYED, MAY FULFILL SUCH
 EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT THROUGH EMPLOYMENT AT  ANY  LICENSEE  UNDER  THIS
 CHAPTER  UNLESS  THE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SAID PAROLE, PROBATION, OR
 STATE SUPERVISION EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT SUCH PERSON'S EMPLOYMENT  AT  SUCH
 LICENSEE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
