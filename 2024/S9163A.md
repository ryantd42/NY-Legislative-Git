 AN ACT authorizing the Praise Tabernacle Church of God to receive retro-
  active real property tax exempt status

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor of the city of Albany, county of Albany, is hereby author-
 ized to accept from Praise Tabernacle Church of God, also known as Alba-
 ny Church of God, a religious not-for-profit corporation, an application
 for exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of  the
 real  property  tax  law  with  respect to the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and
 2023-2024 assessment rolls, for all of the school taxes and all  of  the
 general  taxes  of such rolls for the parcel owned by such organization,
 with such parcel being located in the city of Albany, county of  Albany,
 at  453  Delaware  Avenue,  otherwise  known  as  Albany  county tax map
 district 75 section 68 block 2 lot 1. If accepted, the application shall
 be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the  taxable  status
 dates established for such rolls.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate taxable status dates, the assessor, upon
 approval of the  common  council  of  the  city  of  Albany,  may  grant
 exemption  from  all  taxation  and  make appropriate corrections to the
 subject rolls. If such  exemption  is  granted  and  such  organization,
 therefor, shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the
 applicable governing body or tax department may, in its sole discretion,
 provide  for  the  refund  of  those  taxes paid and cancel those taxes,
 fines, penalties, liens, interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
