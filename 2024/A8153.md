  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  finds that native
 plants and ecology are under threat due to habitat destruction,  modifi-
 cation,  and  curtailment.  The  state's  ecology  is  likewise  facing
 increased competition from invasive species and additional stress due to
 climate change. The state has a responsibility to conserve  and  enhance
 the  native  ecological  health  of  the state which directly influences
 public health, agricultural efficacy, economic activity, and recreation-
 al enjoyment.
  § 2. The environmental conservation law is amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 9-0114 to read as follows:
 § 9-0114. NATIVE PLANT PROGRAM.
