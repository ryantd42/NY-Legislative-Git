  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Section 208-f
 of the General Municipal Law (GML) to provide Special  Accidental  Death
 Benefits  (SADB)  to  eligible  beneficiaries of members of the New York
 City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) who are employed  in  certain
 Deputy  Sheriff  titles  and die as a natural and proximate result of an
 accident sustained in the performance of duty.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: Currently, certain beneficiaries of  Deputy  Sher-
 iffs  who die as a natural and proximate result of an accident sustained
 in the performance of duty are eligible to receive an  Accidental  Death
 Benefit equal to 50% of Final Salary. Such benefit is subject to a Cost-
 S. 6216  3
 
 of-Living  Adjustment  (COLA)  starting  after  five  years, pursuant to
 Administrative Code of the City of New York (ACCNY) Section 13-696.
  Under  the  proposed legislation, beneficiaries of Deputy Sheriffs who
 die as a natural and proximate result of an accident  sustained  in  the
 performance  of  duty would receive an Accidental Death Benefit equal to
 100% of Final Salary, offset by any social security and workers' compen-
 sation benefits paid. For purposes of this Fiscal Note,  and  consistent
 with  the  assumptions  and methods described herein, it is assumed that
 the past four decades' practice of providing 3.0% COLAs on the SADB each
 year will be continued in the future.
  For purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  SADB  under  the
 proposed  legislation  would  only be provided to members who die in the
 performance of duty after the Effective Date.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: There is insufficient  data  avail-
 able  to  estimate  the  number  of members who may die as a natural and
 proximate result of an accident sustained in the  performance  of  duty.
 Therefore,  the  estimated financial impact has been calculated on a per
 event basis equal to the increase in the Present Value of  Future  Bene-
 fits  (PVFB) for an average member who could potentially be eligible for
 SADB provided by this proposed legislation.
  Based on the census data and the  actuarial  assumptions  and  methods
 described  herein,  the  enactment  of  this  proposed legislation would
 increase the PVFB by approximately $1.1 million, on  average,  for  each
 eligible Deputy Sheriff who dies as a natural and proximate result of an
 accident sustained in the performance of duty.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: Enactment of this
 proposed legislation would increase employer contributions,  where  such
 amount  would  depend on the number of members affected as well as other
 characteristics including the age, years of service, and salary  history
 of each member.
  Based  on  the actuarial assumptions and methods described herein, the
 enactment of this proposed legislation is estimated to  increase  annual
 employer  contributions  by approximately $135,000, on average, for each
 eligible Deputy Sheriff who dies as a natural and proximate result of an
 accident sustained in the performance of duty.
  As there is insufficient data  currently  available  to  estimate  the
 number  of eligible members who might die and be eligible for SADB under
 the proposed legislation, the financial impact would  be  recognized  at
 the  time of event. Consequently, changes in employer contributions have
 been estimated assuming that the increase in the PVFB would be amortized
 over a closed 15-year period (14 payments under the One-Year Lag Method-
 ology) using level dollar payments.
  With respect to the timing, increases in employer contributions  would
 depend  upon when members would die as a natural and proximate result of
 an accident  sustained  in  the  performance  of  duty  but,  generally,
 increased employer contributions will first occur the second fiscal year
 following approval of the Accidental Death Benefit.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The  146 NYCERS Deputy Sheriffs as of June 30, 2022 had an average age
 of approximately 42.0  years,  average  service  of  approximately  11.6
 years, and an average salary of approximately $85,700.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.

  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
