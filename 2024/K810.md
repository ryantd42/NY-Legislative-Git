  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the  quality  and  character of life in the communities across the great
State of New York is reflective of certain exemplary organizations whose
purpose is dedicated to serving the  community  and  the  needs  of  its
citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Julia L. Butterfield Memorial Library upon the occasion of
hosting its Bicentennial celebration on Tuesday, December 19, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  Julia  L.  Butterfield  Memorial  Library  and  Putnam
History  Museum organized the Julia L. Butterfield Bicentennial to honor
Julia's 200th birthday on December 19, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, This is the latest in a series of events and activities  to
commemorate  her remarkable life and enduring legacy in Cold Spring, New
York; her legacy positively impacts the Cold Spring  community  to  this
day  as  her  last  wishes  included  bequests for the construction of a
library (Julia L. Butterfield Memorial Library), a hospital (Butterfield
Hospital), and the St. Mary's Church parsonage; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Julia L. Butterfield Memorial Library  was  established
through  the will of the late Julia L. Butterfield who died on August 6,
1913, at the age of 90; and
 
  WHEREAS, Julie L. Butterfield was born on December 19, 1823, on  St.
Marks' Place in New York City; she moved to Cold Spring in 1852 with her
first husband Frederick James; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Until  her death, she spent a large portion of her time at
her beautiful Cold Spring residence known as Cragside which was  located
on  the  site  of  the new Haldane Central School District's high school
building; the gatehouse to Cragside still stands today on the corner  of
Route 9D (Morris Ave) and Craigside Drive; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Julia  L. Butterfield loved to entertain, and her frequent
guests included the Grand Duke of Russia, the Count of Paris, presidents
of the United States, several governors, famous generals,  and  bishops;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, many of the paintings that hang in the Library
today once hung in Cragside; the most famous, "A Pic-Nic on the Hudson,"
was  painted  in  1863 by Hudson River School artist Thomas Rossiter who
also lived in Cold Spring and was a friend of Julia L. Butterfield; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, a vital  part  of  its  community,  this  remarkable
institution  has  continually  strived  to  provide outstanding service,
 
focusing on education, recreation, and social inclusion,  to  a  diverse
population of neighborhood residents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  enjoyed by the Julia L. Butterfield Memorial
Library is in direct correlation to the efforts of the Board of Trustees
and many individuals who have supported the development of  the  library
over the years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Steeped in a proud and distinguished history, the Julia L.
Butterfield Memorial Library may  take  just  pride  in  its  purposeful
growth,  as  it  looks  forward  to continuing to serve the educational,
cultural and intellectual needs of the community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  Julia L. Butterfield Memorial Library upon the occasion of
hosting its Bicentennial celebration on December 19,  2023;  and  be  it
