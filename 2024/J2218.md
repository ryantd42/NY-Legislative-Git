  HONORING  nine  brave  FDNY  First  Responders  in
  recognition of their prompt and  heroic  actions  on
  February 23, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble firefighters, EMTs, and Medics who exhibit courage
and bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their  own  lives  in  an  effort  to  preserve the life and property of
another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
nine  brave  FDNY Firefighters in recognition of their prompt and heroic
actions; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York's Bravest defended their  title  Friday,  February
23,  2024,  when  they  saved three people dangling from the window of a
burning building in Harlem, New York, with only a rope in a dramatic and
dangerous rescue; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ladder 28 Firefighter Michael Kotzo, Ladder 28 Probationary
Firefighter Jason Lopez, Squad 41 Firefighter Thomas Morrison, Squad  41
Firefighter  Matthew  Nolan,  and  Rescue  3  Firefighter Matthew Murphy
worked together through actions of the most heroic magnitude, rappelling
down the side of 2 St. Nicholas Place with the civilians in  their  arms
as  the  raging  fire  tore through the apartment building; furthermore,
FDNY 10H2 EMT Eisen and EMT Cordiero, as well as FDNY 12R2 Medic Yu  and
Medic  Barnes  were  instrumental  in  the  lifesaving  recue of trapped
residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, The blaze broke out on the third  floor  of  the  six-story
building and quickly overtook the hallways, blocking residents of higher
floors from reaching the stairwell; with no way out, the three residents
fled  to the window, only to realize there was no fire escape to flee to
safety; and
 
  WHEREAS, This left these noble firemen with no other option than  to
deploy  the  uncommon  and  daring rescue method called the "life-saving
rope evolution"; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to acknowledging these five brave men,  members
from  Rescue  3,  Ladder 45, Ladder 34, and Squad 41 actively fought the
blaze and should be meritoriously commended  for  their  sacrifices  and
selfless dedication; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ladder 28 Firefighter Michael Kotzo, Ladder 28 Probationary
Firefighter  Jason Lopez, Squad 41 Firefighter Thomas Morrison, Squad 41
Firefighter Matthew Nolan, Rescue  3  Firefighter  Matthew  Murphy,  EMT
Eisen,  EMT  Cordiero,  Medic  Yu,  and  Medic Barnes, have consistently
 
demonstrated  a  level  of  commitment,  dedication,  integrity,  and
professionalism which truly exemplifies the finest traditions of the New
York City Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
actions performed by the courageous firefighters of  this  great  Empire
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor nine brave FDNY First Responders in recognition  of  their  prompt
and heroic actions on February 23, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted  to  Ladder  28  Firefighter  Michael  Kotzo,  Ladder  28
Probationary  Firefighter  Jason  Lopez,  Squad  41  Firefighter  Thomas
Morrison, Squad 41  Firefighter  Matthew  Nolan,  Rescue  3  Firefighter
Matthew Murphy, EMT Eisen, EMT Cordiero, Medic Yu, and Medic Barnes.
