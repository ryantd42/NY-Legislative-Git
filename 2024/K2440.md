  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 26, 2024, as Hug a Sheep Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim October 26, 2024, as Hug a Sheep Day
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Hug a Sheep Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Hug a Sheep  Day  is  a  unique  celebration  that
brings  people  closer  to  these fluffy, lovable farm animals; it takes
place on the last Saturday of every October, making it a cozy fall event
for animal lovers; and
 
  WHEREAS, This special day has grown  into  an  international  event,
with  farms  opening  their  gates  for  people to come and hug a sheep,
promoting kindness and compassion towards these gentle creatures; and
 
  WHEREAS, Celebrated since the  mid-1990s,  the  day  aims  to  offer
cuddles  and  appreciate  the significant roles sheep play in our lives,
from providing wool for our clothes to contributing to agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Hug a Sheep Day is also a  chance  to  learn  more
about sheep, their intelligence, and their ability to remember faces for
years;  engaging  activities  such  as  farm  visits,  petting zoos, and
knitting classes are excellent options; there is something for everyone,
whether it's learning about  their  rectangular  pupils,  their  natural
self-medication  habits,  or  simply enjoying the warmth of a sheep hug;
and
 
  WHEREAS, National Hug a Sheep  Day  not  only  celebrates  the  bond
between  humans  and  sheep but also highlights the importance of animal
welfare and ethical treatment; it is a gentle reminder of these animals'
joy and comfort in our lives and the need to treat them  with  love  and
respect; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, the day encourages individuals to embark on an
adventure  by  finding  a  local  farm  or  petting  zoo that is open to
visitors; many of these places have sheep that  you  can  pet  and  hug,
providing  a  joyful experience for both kids and adults; alternatively,
you can spread the love for  sheep  online  by  posting  adorable  sheep
photos or videos; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Hug  a Sheep Day is a time to take a few moments
out of your day to appreciate the beauty  and  the  diversity  of  these
amazing animals; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 26, 2024, as Hug a
Sheep Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
