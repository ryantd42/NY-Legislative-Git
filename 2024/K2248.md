  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 16, 2024, as Neurodiversity Pride  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside  to  celebrate  the  diversity  of  the
citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  proclaim  June  16,  2024,  as
Neurodiversity Pride Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, 2024 marks the 7th edition  of  Neurodiversity  Pride  Day,
celebrating  the  uniqueness  of  neurodivergent  individuals  and their
contributions  to  society  at  large;  the  Day  supports  acceptance,
inclusion,  and  appreciation  for  those  who function differently than
others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Considered to be an identity, "neurodivergent," is not just
a medical diagnosis and refers to the fact that neurodiverse individuals
have a different, but not lesser, way of perceiving the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, A symbol  of  unity,  the  New  York  Neurodiversity  Flag,
designed  by  Joshua  Mirsky,  with  its  prominent  infinity symbol and
striking red and gold background was chosen after a contest  and  public
vote  run by the New York State Autism Spectrum Disorders Advisory Board
in 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  infinity  symbol  represents  autism  acceptance;  the
diamond  represents  strength  and  value; the red background represents
power; and the gold represents 1st place, signaling that  neurodivergent
individuals are not second class citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York Neurodiversity Flag is a token of the movement
to  call  for  change  and  represents a sense of identity, purpose, and
comradery within the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Neurodiversity Pride Day,  citizens  are  encouraged  to
shift  their  focus  to  how  to make society more accepting and to have
pride in possessing the courage to be themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
the  unique  strengths  and potential of neurodivergent people, and more
must be done to increase activity  at  the  local,  State  and  national
levels  to support neurodivergent people as well as their families; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  proclaim  June  16,  2024,  as
Neurodiversity Pride Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
