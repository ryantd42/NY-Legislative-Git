 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to piggyback  bus  trans-
  portation contracts
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "school bus
 route efficiency act".
  § 2.  Paragraph g of subdivision 14 of section 305  of  the  education
 law,  as  added by section 12-a of part YYY of chapter 59 of the laws of
 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  g. Notwithstanding the provisions of  this  subdivision,  section  one
 hundred  three  of  the general municipal law, or any other provision of
 law to the contrary, the board of education shall be authorized to enter
 into a piggyback contract with another school district  that  transports
 students  pursuant  to a contract with a private transportation contrac-
 tor, provided that the board finds that the contract cost is appropriate
 [and entry into a piggyback contract will result in a  cost  savings  to
 the  school  district].  For  purposes  of  this paragraph, a "piggyback
 contract" means a contract for the transportation of students that:  (1)
 provides  transportation  FOR  ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT to a location outside
 the students' school district of  residence  [to  which  another  school
 district is already providing transportation to its own students through
 an  existing  contract  with  a private transportation contractor, other
 than a cooperatively bid  contract];  (2)  PROVIDES  TRANSPORTATION  FOR
 ANOTHER  SCHOOL  DISTRICT  FOR  ITS  OWN  STUDENTS TO THE SAME OR NEARBY
 LOCATIONS THROUGH A CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE  TRANSPORTATION  CONTRACTOR;
 (3)  is  entered  into by the private transportation contractor and each
 school district involved; and [(3)]  (4) provides for transportation  in
 accordance  with the terms and conditions of such [existing] transporta-
 tion contract.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the first of July  next  succeeding
 the date upon which it shall have become a law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
