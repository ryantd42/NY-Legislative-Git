Assembly Resolution No. 1017
 
BY: M. of A. Gibbs
 
  HONORING  the  life  and legacy of Ariel Gibbs, in
  conjunction  with  the  observance  of  Heart  Valve
  Disease Awareness Day on February 22, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
diseases that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the life and legacy of Ariel Gibbs, in conjunction with  the  observance
of Heart Valve Disease Awareness Day on February 22, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Heart Valve Disease Awareness Day is recognized annually on
February  22nd,  and  aims to increase recognition of the specific risks
and symptoms of heart valve disease, improve  detection  and  treatment,
and ultimately save lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  heart  valve  disease  can be disabling and deadly,
available treatments can save  lives,  making  education  and  awareness
particularly important; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  this  day  and  throughout  the  year,  the  campaign
partners-100+  non-profits,  advocacy  organizations,  professional
societies,  foundations,  and hospitals and heart centers-are helping to
spread the word about valve disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 11 million Americans  have  heart  valve  disease
(HVD), a potentially disabling and deadly disease, yet three out of four
Americans know little to nothing about HVD; and
 
  WHEREAS, Aortic Stenosis (AS) is the most common type of heart valve
disease, affecting millions of people in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  AS is the hardening of the aortic valve over time, causing
the valve to tighten; this narrowing of the valve makes  it  harder  for
the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body; and
 
  WHEREAS,  AS  can  vary  in  severity and gets worse over time; as a
result, less oxygen-rich blood flows from the lungs to the brain and the
rest of the body, which may cause symptoms; and
 
  WHEREAS, Severe aortic stenosis with  symptoms,  commonly  known  as
heart valve failure, can be life-threatening if left untreated; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  on  March  25,  1995, Ariel Gibbs tragically died of
Aortic Stenosis on February 18, 2016,  at  just  20  years  old;  it  is
imperative  that  there  be  greater  awareness  of  this serious health
condition, and more must be done to  increase  activity  at  the  local,
State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor the life and legacy  of  Ariel  Gibbs,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of Heart Valve Disease Awareness Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Ariel Gibbs.
