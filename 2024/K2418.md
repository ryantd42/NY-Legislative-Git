  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November  2024,  as  Hospice  and  Palliative  Care
  Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State places the highest priority on the health
and well-being of all our citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, Honoring patient  preferences  is  a  critical  element  in
providing quality end-of-life care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  November  2024,  as  Hospice  and
Palliative Care Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction
with  the  observance  of National Hospice and Palliative Care Awareness
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than 40 years, hospice has helped provide  comfort
and  dignity  to  millions of people, allowing them to spend their final
months at home, surrounded by the people important to them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  hospice  model  is  built  on  an  interdisciplinary,
team-oriented  approach  to  treatment  and  support,  including  expert
medical care, quality symptom control, and comprehensive pain management
as a foundation of care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Beyond providing clinical treatment, hospice attends to the
patient's emotional, spiritual and social  needs,  and  provides  family
services like caregiver training, respite care, and bereavement support;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Community-based  palliative care, which delivers expertise
to improve quality of life through pain and symptom  control  and  other
support, can be provided at any time during a serious illness, and given
that  hospice  organizations  are  some  of  the  best  providers  of
community-based palliative care; and
 
  WHEREAS, In  an  increasingly  fragmented  and  broken  health  care
system,  hospice  is one of the few sectors that demonstrates how health
care can and should work at its best for the people it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  1.61  million  Medicare  beneficiaries  living  with
life-limiting illness and their families received care from the nation's
hospice  programs  in  communities throughout the United States in 2019;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Data  shows  significant  changes  in  patient  diagnoses,
calling  for  innovation  in how hospices provide care to those in need;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Hospice and palliative care organizations are advocates and
educators  about  advance  care  planning  that  help  individuals  make
decisions about the care they want; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  the  criteria  to  be  enrolled  in  hospice and
palliative care differs, both services manage symptoms to help keep your
loved one comfortable; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Both share a holistic and integrative approach to the care
by treating the whole person, physically, emotionally, spiritually,  and
socially;  and  both types of care focus on relieving symptoms, pain and
stress, for the  patient,  their  caregivers,  and  their  family;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as  Hospice
and  Palliative Care Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
