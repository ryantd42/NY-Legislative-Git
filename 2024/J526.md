  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Parkinson's Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great care to recognize serious
diseases  by  proclaiming  official months to increase awareness of such
concerns, which affect thousands of New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Parkinson's Awareness
Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Parkinson's Disease is a chronic, progressive  neurological
disease  and  is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's  Research  is
dedicated  to  finding  a  cure  for  Parkinson's  disease  through  an
aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the  development  of
improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  United  States,  50,000-60,000  new  cases  of
Parkinson's Disease are diagnosed each year, adding to the  one  million
people who currently have Parkinson's Disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Great  strides  have  been  made  in  the  battle  against
Parkinson's  Disease;  Parkinson's  Awareness  Month  is  committed  to
fighting  this  horrific  disease  by  finding  better  ways to prevent,
detect, and provide treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS, Parkinson's Disease is a substantial health problem in  the
State  of  New  York  and  throughout  the  United  States;  it  strikes
disproportionately more men, but also women, with  the  average  age  of
onset being around 60 years old; and
 
  WHEREAS, The symptoms of Parkinson's Disease can vary from person to
person;  early  signs  may  be  subtle  and  can  go unnoticed; symptoms
typically begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse on that
side even after symptoms begin to affect both sides; and
 
  WHEREAS, People suffering with Parkinson's Disease can exhibit  many
signs  and  symptoms  including  tremors,  rigidity, slowing of motions,
postural instability, depression,  emotional  changes,  difficulty  with
swallowing  and  chewing,  speech  changes,  sleep  problems,  pain  and
dementia; and
 
  WHEREAS, While there  is  no  cure  for  Parkinson's  Disease,  many
different  types  of  medications and surgical options are available for
its treatment; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Parkinson's
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.
