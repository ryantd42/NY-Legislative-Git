  PERSONAL BENEFIT.
  1. A PERSON SHALL BE GUILTY OF MISREPRESENTING A COMPANION ANIMAL AS A
 SERVICE ANIMAL FOR PERSONAL BENEFIT WHEN HE OR SHE:
  (A) EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY REPRESENTS THAT AN ANIMAL  IN  HIS  OR  HER
 POSSESSION  IS  A SERVICE ANIMAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING ANY RIGHTS
 OR PRIVILEGES AFFORDED TO A  PERSON  WITH  A  DISABILITY  REQUIRING  THE
 ASSISTANCE  OF  A  SERVICE  ANIMAL  AND SUCH PERSON KNOWS OR SHOULD HAVE
 KNOWN THAT THE ANIMAL IN HIS OR HER POSSESSION WAS NOT A SERVICE ANIMAL;
 OR
  (B) TAKES AN ANIMAL, WHICH SUCH PERSON KNOWS OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN  NOT
 TO  BE  A  SERVICE  ANIMAL,  INTO  A PLACE OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION WHERE
 COMPANION ANIMALS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND THE  ANIMAL  ACCOMPANYING  SAID
 INDIVIDUAL  IS  WEARING  A  CAPE,  VEST, SPECIAL LEASH, OR OTHER FORM OF
