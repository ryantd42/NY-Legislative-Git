 Introduced by M. of A. E. BROWN -- read once and referred to the Commit-

 AN  ACT  directing  the  Long  Island rail road commuter's council study
  technologies which would allow  seamless  communication  between  fire
  departments  and  the  Long  Island  rail  road; and providing for the
  repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short title. This act shall be known as the "Fire depart-
 ment and Long Island rail road communication enhancement act".
  § 2. The Long Island rail road commuter's council is directed to study
 emerging technologies which would allow seamless  communication  between
 fire  departments  and  the  Long  Island  rail  road.  Such study shall
 include, but not be limited to:
  (a) assessing technological solutions and communication protocols that
 enable real-time communication between fire  departments  and  the  Long
 Island rail road;
  (b)  examine  potential  methods  for fire departments to notify train
 conductors promptly in the event of an emergency requiring such dispatch
 of a fire truck, ensuring a conductor receives notice to halt the train;
  (c) examine the feasibility of  implementing  a  system  that  enables
 train  conductors  to receive alerts from fire departments allowing such
 conductor to temporarily halt trains at  the  preceding  station  for  a
 specified period, facilitating unobstructed emergency response;
  (d)  considering  the  impact of such technological solutions on train
 schedules, passenger safety, and emergency response efficiency; and
  (e) engaging with relevant stakeholders, including,  but  not  limited
 to,  fire  department  officials,  transportation experts, and emergency
 response professionals, to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.
  § 3. The Long Island rail road commuter's council shall make a  report
 to  the  Metropolitan  transportation authority of its findings, conclu-
 sions, and recommendations no later than twelve months after the  effec-
 tive date of this act. Such report shall include an outline of its find-
 ings,  recommendations,  and  proposed  technological  solutions  for

 implementing effective communication mechanisms between fire departments
 and the Long Island rail road. Further,  such  report  shall  include  a
 cost-benefit  analysis,  potential challenges, and proposed timeline for
 such implementation of the recommended solutions.
  §  4.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed twelve months after it shall have become a law.
