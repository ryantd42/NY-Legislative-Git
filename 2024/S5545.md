 to read as follows:
  (i) Discontinuance of a class of contract upon not  less  than  ninety
 days'  prior written notice, AND NOTICE VIA EMAIL IF THE CORPORATION HAS
 THE ENROLLED INDIVIDUAL'S EMAIL  ADDRESS  ON  FILE.  In  exercising  the
 option  to  discontinue  coverage pursuant to this item, the corporation
 must act uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of
 enrolled individuals or individuals who may  become  eligible  for  such
 coverage and must offer to subscribers or group remitting agents, as may
 be  appropriate,  the  option  to  purchase  all other individual health
 insurance coverage currently being offered by the corporation to  appli-
 cants  in  that market. Provided, however, the superintendent may, after
 giving due consideration to the public interest, approve a request  made
 by a corporation for the corporation to satisfy the requirements of this
 item  through  the  offering  of  contracts at each level of coverage as
 defined in subsection (b) of section four thousand three  hundred  six-h
 of  this  article  that  contains  the essential health benefits package
 described in paragraph three of subsection (e) of section four  thousand
 three  hundred  six-h of this article by another corporation, insurer or
 health maintenance organization within the  corporation's  same  holding
 company system, as defined in article fifteen of this chapter.
  (ii)  Discontinuance  of  all  hospital,  surgical  or medical expense
 coverage in the individual direct payment  market  in  this  state  upon
 written  notice  to  the  superintendent and to each subscriber not less
 than one hundred eighty days prior to the date of the expiration of such
 coverage, AND NOTICE VIA EMAIL IF THE CORPORATION HAS  THE  SUBSCRIBER'S
 EMAIL ADDRESS ON FILE.  In the event of such a withdrawal from the indi-
 vidual  direct  payment  market,  the  corporation must also provide the
 superintendent with a written plan to minimize potential  disruption  in
 the  marketplace  occasioned by such withdrawal. In addition, the corpo-
 S. 5545  4
 
 ration may not provide for the issuance of  any  hospital,  surgical  or
 medical expense coverage in the individual direct payment market in this
 state  during  the five-year period beginning on the date of the discon-
 tinuance of the last health insurance coverage not so renewed.
  §  12.  The opening paragraph of item (i) of subparagraph (A) and item
 (i) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph 3 of subsection (j) of section 4305
 of the insurance law, as amended by chapter 398 of the laws of 2010, are
 amended to read as follows:
  the corporation provides written notice to each contract  holder,  AND
 NOTICE  VIA  EMAIL  IF  THE  CORPORATION HAS THE CONTRACT HOLDER'S EMAIL
 ADDRESS ON FILE, provided coverage of this class in such market (and  to
 all  employees  and member insureds covered under such coverage) of such
 discontinuance at least ninety days prior to the date of  discontinuance
 of  such  coverage.  In  addition to any other information required of
 notices by the superintendent, this written notice  shall  conspicuously
 include  an explanation, in plain language, of the contract holder's and
 covered employee's or member insured's rights  under  this  subparagraph
 and subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, including:
  (i)  the corporation provides written notice to the superintendent and
 to each contract holder (and all employees and member  insureds  covered
 under  such  coverage),  AND NOTICE VIA EMAIL IF THE CORPORATION HAS THE
 CONTRACT HOLDER'S EMAIL ADDRESS ON FILE, of such discontinuance at least
 one hundred eighty days prior to the date of the discontinuance of  such
 coverage;
  §  13.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all
 policies or contracts issued, renewed, modified, altered or  amended  on
 and after such effective date.
