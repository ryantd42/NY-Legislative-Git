  COMMENDING  the  Allen  Community  Senior Citizens
  Center upon the occasion  of  celebrating  its  50th
  Anniversary on March 27, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great  pride  in  acknowledging
outstanding  organizations  which  distinguish themselves in serving the
community and its residents and warrant special recognition; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the Allen Community Senior Citizens Center upon the occasion  of
celebrating  its  50th  Anniversary at its Anniversary Gala on Saturday,
March 30, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to  honor  those
illustrious  organizations  of  the  State  of New York whose purposeful
endeavors serve the cherished senior citizens in their  communities  and
preserve  a  facet of this Nation's glorious past for the edification of
future generations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Allen  Community  Senior  Citizens  Center  is  a
community-based agency in Southeast Queens, New York, which is funded by
the  New York City Department for the Aging (DFTA); it provides numerous
services to more than 1,000 senior citizens who are 60 years of age  and
older; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  mission of the Allen Community Senior Citizens Center
is to programmatically serve the elderly in the  community  through  the
provision  of  a  variety  of  comprehensive  services  that  meet  the
nutritional,  recreational,  educational,  and  informational  needs  of
program participants in a caring and sensitive manner; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  late Bishop Donald George Kenneth Ming, former Pastor
of Allen AME Church, founded the Allen Community Senior Citizens  Center
to  assist those isolated senior citizens by providing opportunities for
socialization; under the direction of the late Ms. Rose I. Jenkins,  the
newly incorporated organization opened its doors on March 27, 1974; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ms.  Jenkins  and  the  Reverend  Dr.  Floyd H. Flake, the
subsequently appointed and current Pastor of Allen AME Church,  now  The
Greater  Allen  AME  Cathedral  of  New York, cooperatively expanded the
senior  program  to  include  educational,  consumer,  and  nutritional
education  services;  additionally,  a  Senior  Advisory  Council  was
established; and
 
  WHEREAS, In June of 1982, due to the efforts  of  the  Reverend  Dr.
Flake,  the  Allen  Senior  Citizens Complex was acquired, and the Allen
Community Senior Citizens Center relocated to the premises; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception, the Allen Community Senior Citizens
Center has offered many  new  services,  including  health  and  fitness
programs,  Tai  Chi,  cultural  activities,  coffee  hour,  and computer
learning sessions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally, individualized support  and  case  assistance
are  available,  and  nutritious hot lunches are provided daily; for the
seniors' enjoyment, day outings and  overnight  trips  are  periodically
planned; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  course of the development of the Empire State, if
the aspects of shared concern and responsive  endeavor  combine  in  the
commitment  to  humanity  and  society,  there  have  emerged  among the
distinguished citizens of the State of New  York  certain  organizations
which  warrant  special recognition; the Allen Community Senior Citizens
Center is such an organization; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend the Allen Community Senior Citizens Center, upon the occasion of
celebrating  its  50th  Anniversary,  and to honor its members, past and
present, who have labored so conscientiously to secure and  improve  the
quality  of  life  for  the  senior citizens of the community; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Allen Community Senior Citizens Center.
