  COMMENDING  the  Ancient  Egyptian  Arabic  Order
  Nobles  Mystic  Shrine  upon  the  occasion  of
  celebrating Jubilee Day on June 2, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern and in full accord with its long-
standing  traditions,  this  Legislative Body is justly proud to commend
the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine upon the occasion
of celebrating Jubilee Day on Sunday, June 2, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The history of Jubilee Day began  in  August  1914  with  a
lawsuit  against  the  Order,  which ended in a historic decision by The
United States Supreme Court on June 3, 1929; and
 
  WHEREAS, The lawsuit  attempted  to  deprive  the  Ancient  Egyptian
Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine of the right to work and be recognized
as Shriners; it also extended those implications to all appending Prince
Hall Masons established in the United States of America; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The nine Supreme Court Justices' unanimous decision upheld
the  rights  of  this  vital  organization's  members  to  work  and  be
recognized  as Shriners; it also legitimized Prince Hall Masonry in this
country, including other Fraternal Orders  composed  of  black  members,
which are of organizations, doctrine, and purpose as those consisting of
white members; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Prince  Hall  Masonry  has  thrived for 200 years and will
continue to be a vital resource for the Black communities all throughout
the State and the country for countless years to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Imperial  Officers,  Illustrious  Potentates,
Commandresses,  current  ranking  officers,  and  Nobles  will gather to
commemorate Jubilee Day on Sunday, June 2, 2024, to the memory  of  that
historic  decision  of  the United States Supreme Court on June 3, 1929,
and dedicate this service to those members of the Order who  have  given
unselfishly of their substance to the end which justice prevailed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Worldwide Fraternal Shrine Family has a membership of
approximately 35,000 in some 227 Shrine  Temples  and  200  Courts,  its
women's  auxiliary,  the  Daughters  of Isis, throughout the Continental
United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, England,  Spain,  Hawaii,  Japan,
Korea, Guam, Thailand, Panama, and the Bahamas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Ancient  Egyptian  Arabic  Order Nobles of the Mystic
Shrine  is  primarily  a  benevolent,  charitable,  and  fraternal
organization;  its dedicated membership is committed to fostering civic,
economic, and educational development programs worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to honor and commend
the members of the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles  Mystic  Shrine,
past  and  present,  who  have  labored so conscientiously to secure and
improve the quality of life for the community it serves; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine upon  the
occasion of celebrating Jubilee Day on June 2, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Ancient Egyptian Arabic Order Nobles Mystic Shrine.
