  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2024, as German-American Heritage  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored  traditions,  it  is  the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2024,  as
German-American Heritage Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  1670s,  the  first  significant  groups of German
immigrants arrived in the British colonies, settling  primarily  in  New
York  and  Pennsylvania;  immigration  continued  in  very large numbers
during the 19th Century, with eight million arrivals from Germany; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many Germans arrived in North America seeking religious  or
political  freedom, others for economic opportunities greater than those
in Europe, and others for the chance to start fresh in  the  New  World;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The arrivals before 1850 were mostly farmers who sought out
the most productive land, where their intensive farming techniques would
pay  off;  after  1840,  many  came  to  cities,  where  Germania,
German-speaking districts, soon emerged; and
 
  WHEREAS, German-Americans established the first kindergartens in the
United States, introduced the Christmas tree tradition,  and  originated
popular American foods such as hot dogs and hamburgers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, German-American celebrations are held throughout the
country,  one  of  the most well-known being the German-American Steuben
Parade in New  York  City,  held  every  third  Saturday  in  September;
traditional  Oktoberfest  celebrations  and  the German-American Day are
also popular festivities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Currently, German-Americans make up  11.1%  of  New  York's
population,  and  approximately  49  million  German-Americans  live
throughout the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, German-Americans have  made  significant  contributions  to
American  society  as  doctors,  politicians,  musicians,  athletes, and
teachers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Based in New York City, German-American John  Peter  Zenger
began  publication  of  the  New York Weekly Journal in 1733; the paper,
backed  by  several  prominent  lawyers  and  merchants,  attacked  the
administration of the British Royal Governor of New York, William Cosby;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Responsible for the content of the paper, John Peter Zenger
was  arrested on libel charges and imprisoned in 1734; in the trial that
followed, he was defended by Andrew Hamilton, who established truth as a
defense in cases of libel; the trial, which resulted in the  publisher's
acquittal, helped to establish freedom of the press in America; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Another  famous  German-American  was  Dwight  David "Ike"
Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States from  1953-1961,  as
well as a decorated General in the United States Army; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  World  War  II,  Dwight David Eisenhower served as
Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in  Europe,  with  responsibility
for  planning  and  supervising  the  successful  invasion of France and
Germany in 1944-1945; in 1951, he became the first Supreme Commander  of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); and
 
  WHEREAS,  German-American  Heritage Month is a time to celebrate the
aspirations and values that have been shared with the German people  for
generations,  and  to recognize the countless contributions of Americans
and New Yorkers of German descent  to  every  aspect  of  society;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2024,  as
German-American  Heritage  Month  in  the  State  of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
