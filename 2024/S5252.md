 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure  law,  in  relation  to  ensuring
  repeat offenders qualify for bail and pre-trial detention
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The opening paragraph and paragraphs (t) and (u) of  subdi-
 vision  4  of  section 510.10 of the criminal procedure law, the opening
 paragraph as amended by section 2 of part UU of chapter 56 of  the  laws
 of  2020, paragraph (t) as amended and paragraph (u) as added by section
 2 of subpart B of part UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, are amended
 and a new paragraph (v) is added to read as follows:
  Where the principal stands charged  with  a  qualifying  offense,  the
 court, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may in its discretion release
 the principal pending trial on the principal's own recognizance or under
 non-monetary  conditions,  fix  bail, or, where the defendant is charged
 with a qualifying offense [which is a felony], the court may commit  the
 principal to the custody of the sheriff. A principal stands charged with
 a qualifying offense for the purposes of this subdivision when he or she
 stands charged with:
  (t)  any  felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifi-
 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a
 firearm  as  defined  in  section  265.01-b of the penal law, where such
 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned  after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a separate
 felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an  identifiable  person
 or  property,  or  any  charge  of  criminal  possession of a firearm as
 defined in section 265.01-b of the penal law,  provided,  however,  that
 the  prosecutor must show reasonable cause to believe that the defendant
 committed the instant crime and any underlying crime. For  the  purposes

 of  this subparagraph, any of the underlying crimes need not be a quali-
 fying offense as defined in this subdivision. For the purposes  of  this
 paragraph,  "harm  to  an identifiable person or property" shall include
 but  not  be  limited  to theft of or damage to property. However, based
 upon a review of the facts alleged in the accusatory instrument, if  the
 court determines that such theft is negligible and does not appear to be
 in  furtherance  of  other  criminal  activity,  the  principal shall be
 released on his or her own recognizance or under  appropriate  non-mone-
 tary conditions; [or]
  (u)  criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined in
 subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale of
 a firearm to a minor as defined in section 265.16 of the  penal  law[.];
 OR
  (V)  A  MISDEMEANOR  OR  FELONY  OFFENSE  AND  THE  PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN
 CONVICTED OF ONE OR MORE MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY OFFENSES WITHIN THE IMME-
 DIATE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS.
  § 2. The opening paragraph and subparagraphs (xx) and (xxi)  of  para-
 graph  (b)  of subdivision 1 of section 530.20 of the criminal procedure
 law, the opening paragraph as amended by section 3 of part UU of chapter
 56 of the laws of 2020, subparagraph (xx) as  amended  and  subparagraph
 (xxi) as added by section 4 of subpart C of part UU of chapter 56 of the
 laws of 2022, are amended and a new subparagraph (xxii) is added to read
 as follows:
  Where  the  principal  stands  charged  with a qualifying offense, the
 court, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may in its discretion release
 the principal pending trial on the principal's own recognizance or under
 non-monetary conditions, fix bail, or, where the  defendant  is  charged
 with  a qualifying offense [which is a felony], the court may commit the
 principal to the custody of the sheriff. The  court  shall  explain  its
 choice of release, release with conditions, bail or remand on the record
 or in writing. A principal stands charged with a qualifying offense when
 he or she stands charged with:
  (xx)  any felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifi-
 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a
 firearm  as  defined  in  section  265.01-b  of the penal law where such
 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned  after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a separate
 felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an  identifiable  person
 or property, provided, however, that the prosecutor must show reasonable
 cause  to believe that the defendant committed the instant crime and any
 underlying crime. For the purposes of  this  subparagraph,  any  of  the
 underlying  crimes  need  not be a qualifying offense as defined in this
 subdivision. For the purposes of this paragraph, "harm to  an  identifi-
 able person or property" shall include but not be limited to theft of or
 damage to property. However, based upon a review of the facts alleged in
 the  accusatory  instrument,  if the court determines that such theft is
 negligible and does not appear to be in furtherance  of  other  criminal
 activity, the principal shall be released on his or her own recognizance
 or under appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]
  (xxi)  criminal  possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined
 in subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale
 of a firearm to a minor as  defined  in  section  265.16  of  the  penal
 law[.]; OR
 S. 5252  3
 
  (XXII)  A  MISDEMEANOR  OR  FELONY  OFFENSE AND THE PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN
 CONVICTED OF ONE OR MORE MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY OFFENSES WITHIN THE IMME-
 DIATE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS.
  § 3. The opening paragraph and paragraphs (t) and (u) of subdivision 4
 of  section  530.40 of the criminal procedure law, the opening paragraph
 as amended by section 4 of part UU of chapter 56 of the  laws  of  2020,
 paragraph  (t)  as  amended  and  paragraph (u) as added by section 4 of
 subpart B of part UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, are amended  and
 a new paragraph (v) is added to read as follows:
  Where  the  principal  stands  charged  with a qualifying offense, the
 court, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may in its discretion release
 the principal pending trial on the principal's own recognizance or under
 non-monetary conditions, fix bail, or, where the  defendant  is  charged
 with  a qualifying offense [which is a felony], the court may commit the
 principal to the custody of the sheriff. The  court  shall  explain  its
 choice of release, release with conditions, bail or remand on the record
 or  in writing. A principal stands charged with a qualifying offense for
 the purposes of this subdivision when he or she stands charged with:
  (t) any felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to  an  identifi-
 able  person  or  property,  or  any  charge of criminal possession of a
 firearm as defined in section 265.01-b of  the  penal  law,  where  such
 charge  arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a  separate
 felony  or  class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifiable person
 or property, or any charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a  firearm  as
 defined  in  section  265.01-b of the penal law, provided, however, that
 the prosecutor must show reasonable cause to believe that the  defendant
 committed  the  instant crime and any underlying crime. For the purposes
 of this subparagraph, any of the underlying crimes need not be a  quali-
 fying  offense  as defined in this subdivision. For the purposes of this
 paragraph, "harm to an identifiable person or  property"  shall  include
 but  not  be  limited  to theft of or damage to property. However, based
 upon a review of the facts alleged in the accusatory instrument, if  the
 court determines that such theft is negligible and does not appear to be
 in  furtherance  of  other  criminal  activity,  the  principal shall be
 released on his or her own recognizance or under  appropriate  non-mone-
 tary conditions; [or]
  (u)  criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined in
 subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale of
 a firearm to a minor as defined in section 265.16 of the  penal  law[.];
 OR
  (V)  A  MISDEMEANOR  OR  FELONY  OFFENSE  AND  THE  PRINCIPAL HAS BEEN
 CONVICTED OF ONE OR MORE MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY OFFENSES WITHIN THE IMME-
