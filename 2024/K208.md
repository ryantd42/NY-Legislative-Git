  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 21, 2023, as Down Syndrome  Awareness  Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of common genetic
variations that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 21,  2023,  as  Down
Syndrome Awareness Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of World Down Syndrome Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Down  syndrome is a genetic condition affecting the body's
development caused by the presence of three copies of chromosome  21  in
the  cell nucleus, and is also called Trisomy 21; there are an estimated
seven million people with Down syndrome worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, One in every 691 babies  born  in  the  United  States  are
diagnosed with Down syndrome, making it the most common genetic disorder
in  the  nation;  approximately 400,000 Americans have Down syndrome and
about 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome in the United States each
year; and
 
  WHEREAS, While once extremely fatal, advances in medical  technology
are  helping  individuals  with  Down syndrome to live longer, healthier
lives  than  ever  before;  with  proper  treatment,  most  particularly
corrective  heart surgeries, as many as 80% of adults with Down syndrome
will reach age 60 or older; and
 
  WHEREAS, Down Syndrome International will be  celebrating  the  18th
Anniversary  of  World  Down  Syndrome  Day  on March 21, 2023; the date
(3/21) was chosen to represent the scientific basis  of  the  condition,
Trisomy 21; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Down Syndrome Day is a global awareness day which has
been officially observed by the United Nations since 2012; each year the
voice  of  people  with  Down  syndrome and those who live and work with
them, grows louder, but there is still so much more to be done; and
 
  WHEREAS, More and more New Yorkers are interacting with  individuals
with  Down syndrome, increasing the need for widespread public education
and acceptance; and
 
  WHEREAS, People with Down syndrome in the State of New York  possess
a  wide  range of abilities, and are active participants in educational,
occupational, social, and recreational circles of the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
inherent  dignity, worth and valuable contributions of persons with Down
syndrome  as  promoters  of  the  well-being  and  diversity  of  our
communities,  and  the  importance  of  their  individual  autonomy  and
 
independence, including the freedom to  make  their  own  choices;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 21,  2023,  as  Down
Syndrome Awareness Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of World Down Syndrome Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
