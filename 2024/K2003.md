  community
 
  WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding members of our community who,
through their selfless commitment and dedication, have served to  better
the  quality of life in our community and have had a measurable positive

Legislative Body records the passing of Billie D. Anderson,  noting  the
significance of her purposeful life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS, Billie D. Anderson of Binghamton, New York, died on Sunday,
July 23, 2023, at the age of 91; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  in the South, Billie D. Anderson moved to Binghamton
in 1945 with her family in hopes of finding equality but  was  met  with
more  discrimination;  when  her  own  son  became  the  target  of this
discrimination she began advocating to diversify the  Binghamton  School
Board and was able to bring in African American teachers and counselors;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  she  organized  bus  trips to Washington and
Albany, speaking  out  against  racism  and  inequality  in  employment,
criminal justice, and education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  trailblazer with a strong voice for disenfranchised and
marginalized individuals throughout Broome County,  Billie  D.  Anderson
stood for rights, equality, and justice for all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  30  years, Billie D. Anderson worked at Opportunities
for Broome assisting individuals and families to improve the quality  of
their  lives through the development of self-reliance, while promoting a
culture of people working together to help themselves, one another,  and
their community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Billie  D.  Anderson  was  a  champion for civil and human
rights; she fearlessly fought for equality, lending her unwavering voice
to uplift the oppressed and strived for a better and  more  just  world;
her  dedication  to  these  causes  knew  no  bounds,  and  her work was
instrumental in revitalizing the Broome-Tioga NAACP, ensuring  that  the
organization  remained  a  beacon of hope for those who sought fairness,
and inclusivity, and justice; and
 
  WHEREAS, A woman of indomitable  faith  and  dedication,  Billie  D.
Anderson  was  also  an  active  member  of  Trinity  AME Zion Church in
Binghamton; and
 
  WHEREAS, While she was passionate about many things, above  all  her
greatest passion was being a mother to her six children, whom she raised
to always stand up for what they believe in; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  freedom  fighter  and  leader  who  took initiative and
founded  numerous  community  service  projects,  Billie  D.  Anderson's
tireless  efforts  within  the  local  jail system and the public school
system further demonstrated her unyielding commitment to  helping  those
in need; and
 
  Whereas,  Billie  D.  Anderson's  legacy will forever be etched in the
hearts  of  the  countless  individuals  she  touched;  her  unwavering
dedication,  unapologetic tenacity, and profound compassion will inspire
future generations to stand up and speak  out  for  justice  and  combat
injustice in its many forms; now, therefore be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
mourn the death of Billie  D.  Anderson,  and  to  express  its  deepest
condolences to her family; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Billie D. Anderson.
