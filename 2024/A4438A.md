  (a) Local governmental units shall be granted state aid by a state aid
 funding authorization letter issued by  the  office  [for  approved  net
 operating  costs] BASED ON A PAYMENT FOR SERVICES MODEL DEVELOPED BY THE
 OFFICE, IN CONSULTATION WITH OPERATORS OF FUNDED PROGRAMS, for voluntary
 agencies  [to  support  the  base  amount  of state aid provided to such
 voluntary agencies for the prior year] provided that the  local  govern-
 mental  unit  has approved and submitted budgets for the voluntary agen-
 cies to the office. The voluntary  agency  budgets  shall  identify  the
 nature  of the services to be provided which must be consistent with the
 local services plan submitted by the local governmental unit pursuant to
 article forty-one of this chapter, the areas to be served and include  a
 description of the voluntary agency contributions and local governmental
 unit  funding  provided.  The  local  governmental unit shall enter into
 contracts with the voluntary agencies receiving  such  state  aid.  Such
 contracts shall include funding requirements set by the office including
 but  not  limited  to responsibilities of voluntary agencies relating to
 work scopes, program performance and operations, [application of program
 income, prohibited use of funds,] recordkeeping and  audit  obligations.
 Upon  designation  by  the office, local governmental units shall notify
 voluntary agencies as to the source of funding received by  such  volun-
 tary agencies.
  (b)  State  aid  made  available  to  a  local  governmental unit [for
 approved net operating costs] BASED ON  A  PAYMENT  FOR  SERVICES  MODEL
 DEVELOPED  BY  THE  OFFICE,  IN  CONSULTATION  WITH  OPERATORS OF FUNDED
 PROGRAMS for a program operated by a voluntary agency or a local govern-
 mental unit may be reduced where a review  of  such  voluntary  agency's
 prior  year's  budget  and/or  performance  indicates[:  (1)] that the
 program operated by a local governmental unit or  voluntary  agency  has
 failed  to  meet  minimum  performance standards and requirements of the
 office including, but not limited to,  maintaining  service  utilization
 rates  and productivity standards as set by the office provided however,
 that upon determination that the program  is  not  meeting  the  minimum
 standards  and  requirements, the office shall notify such program oper-
 ated by a local governmental unit or voluntary agency of their deficien-
 cies, and if appropriate, a corrective action plan that includes specif-
 ic  actions  to  address  any  deficiencies  and  a  timetable  for
 implementation shall be developed. State aid may be reduced if a correc-
 tive  action plan is not approved by the office or is not implemented in
 a timely and satisfactory manner[;
  (2) that the voluntary agency has had an increase in voluntary  agency
 contributions  that  reduces the approved net operating costs necessary,
 except where the office has approved an alternative use of  such  volun-
 tary  agency  contributions  or  such voluntary agency contributions are
 necessary to ensure financial viability].
  § 3. This act shall take effect January 1, 2024  and  shall  apply  to
