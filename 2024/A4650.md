 assistance,  and  data  as  will  enable the commission to carry out its
 powers and duties.
  §  3.  (a)  For the accomplishment of its purposes, the commission may
 meet and hold hearings within or without the state.  The  commission  is
 authorized and empowered to undertake any studies, inquiries, surveys or
 analyses  it  may  deem relevant through its own personnel or in cooper-
 ation with or by agreement with any other public or private agency.
  (b) To the maximum extent feasible, the  commission  may  request  and
 shall be entitled to receive and shall utilize and be provided with such
 facilities,  resources and data from any court in the state and from any
 subdivision, department, board, bureau, commission,  office,  agency  or
 other instrumentality of the state or of any political subdivision ther-
 eof  as  it deems necessary or desirable for the proper execution of its
 powers and duties and to effectuate the purposes set forth in this act.
  (c) The commission is hereby authorized and empowered  to  enter  into

 provided further, however, that the commissioner of the New  York  state
 office  of  parks, recreation and historic preservation shall notify the
 legislative bill drafting commission upon the  renaming  of  the  Robert
 Moses State Park as required under this act in order that the commission
 may  maintain an accurate and timely effective data base of the official
 text of the laws of the state of New York in  furtherance  of  effecting
 the  provisions of section 44 of the legislative law and section 70-b of
 the public officers law.
