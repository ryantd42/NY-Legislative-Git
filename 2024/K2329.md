  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  and  weeks  that  are set aside to increase awareness of
serious issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  9,  2024,  as
Emergency Nurses Day and October 6-12, 2024, as Emergency Nurses Week in
the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  more than 100,000 emergency nurses are the first line
of patient care in our nation's emergency departments; and
 
  WHEREAS, The profession of emergency  nurse  continues  to  grow  in
number and respect throughout our nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Emergency  nurses  are  committed  to  providing  quality
emergency care to their patients; and
 
  WHEREAS, Emergency nurses  selflessly  dedicate  large  portions  of
their lives to caring for and comforting those persons most in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, Emergency nurses are at the forefront of the health system;
they  are  the  first  face  a  patient  comes  across  when entering an
emergency room, and often the last face a patient sees when leaving; and
 
  WHEREAS, They face daily challenges of verbal  and  physical  abuse,
patient  adversity and hardship, and the constant battle of access block
and ramping, however this does not stop them from getting out of bed the
next day and doing it all over again; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Emergency  nurses  continually  demonstrate  their
professionalism  and strive to upgrade standards of practice and improve
patient care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Emergency nurses endeavor to  educate  the  public  in  the
prevention  and  treatment  of  injury and illness and the proper use of
emergency services; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  9, 2024, as
Emergency Nurses Day and October 6-12, 2024, as Emergency Nurses Week in
the State of New York, in recognition of our appreciation  of  emergency
nurses  and to celebrate their dedication and professionalism; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
