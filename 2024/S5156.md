 MONEY  THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 7-103 OF THIS TITLE,
 AND THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF WHICH IS TO  SECURE  THE  PERFORMANCE  OF  A
 RENTAL AGREEMENT FOR THE USE OR RENTAL OF ANY DWELLING OR ANY PART THER-
 EOF.
  (B)  THE  TERM "LANDLORD" SHALL MEAN ANY PERSON WHO RECEIVES PAYMENT
 FROM A TENANT FOR THE RENTAL OR USE OF ANY DWELLING OR ANY PORTION THER-
 EOF AND HAS RECEIVED A SECURITY DEPOSIT IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH RENTAL.
  (C)  THE TERM "TENANT" SHALL MEAN ANY PERSON WHO OCCUPIES ANY DWELLING
 OR ANY PORTION THEREOF FOR WHICH  HE  OR  SHE  PAYS  RENT  AND  WHO,  IN
 CONNECTION WITH SUCH RENTAL, HAS FURNISHED A SECURITY DEPOSIT.
  2.  A LANDLORD SHALL, WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE TENANT VACATES THE
 DWELLING RETURN TO THE TENANT THE FULL SECURITY DEPOSIT AND ANY  ACCRUED
 INTEREST TO WHICH THE TENANT IS ENTITLED.
