BY: Senator HELMING
 
  COMMENDING  Wendy  Boyer  upon the occasion of her
  designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action in emergency situations to preserve the
lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Wendy Boyer upon the occasion of her designation as recipient of
a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an  individual  by  the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, A former substitute school bus driver, Wendy Boyer has been
employed since March 21, 2022, as a  Teacher  Aide  in  a  special-needs
classroom  at  Middlesex  Valley  School  in  the Marcus Whitman Central
School District; and
 
  WHEREAS, A resident of Canandaigua, New York, Wendy Boyer engaged in
a heroic act to save a student's  life;  her  duties  in  the  classroom
included  assisting  students with opening food items' packaging as well
as separating trash and recyclable items; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Wednesday, May 15, 2024,  Wendy  Boyer  was  serving  as
cafeteria  support  during lunchtime; always concerned for the students'
safety and well-being, she was alerted to a child who was choking; and
 
  WHEREAS, Without hesitation, Wendy Boyer  attempted  to  communicate
with  the  child;  assessing the situation, she utilized her training in
basic first aid to dislodge the food caught  in  the  student's  throat,
performing  two  abdominal  thrusts  (formerly  known  as  the  Heimlich
Maneuver); and
 
  WHEREAS, Wendy Boyer's courage and  immediate  response  halted  the
child's  choking  and prevented a potentially tragic event; although she
is  not  officially  certified  in  first  aid  and  cardiopulmonary
resuscitation  (CPR),  she  attended  a  Good  Samaritan course to learn
life-saving measures; and
 
  WHEREAS, A quiet and humble person, Wendy Boyer enjoys crafting  and
working  with  individuals  who  would  benefit  from  the assistance of
someone with a caring and driven attitude; she is an advocate for  those
who  may  not  be  able to do so for themselves or have the resources or
family and friends for support; and
 
  WHEREAS, Familiar with her willingness to support  anyone  in  need,
Wendy Boyer's colleagues were not surprised by her immediate response to
an  emergency  or  her  possession of the skillset and bravery to save a
student's life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  Wendy  Boyer's  noble  and  courageous actions, a
precious life was saved, and a seemingly  dire  situation  had  positive
results;  this  humble hero's intervention is a reminder of the profound
impact which kindness and preparedness can have not only in our  schools
but also in our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Wendy  Boyer,  in  her  spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated her character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of her action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without thought of danger or reward when others need help; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend Wendy Boyer upon the occasion of her designation as recipient of
a  Liberty  Medal,  the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Wendy Boyer.
