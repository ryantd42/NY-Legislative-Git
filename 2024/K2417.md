  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 17-23, 2024,  as  Hunger  and  Homelessness
  Awareness Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help increase
awareness of serious issues that affect the lives of  many  citizens  of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 17-23, 2023, as
Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week in the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National Hunger and Homelessness
Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1975, Villanova University  hosted  the  first  National
Hunger  and  Homelessness Week; since then, universities, colleges, high
schools and organizations across the United States host events in  their
communities  to increase awareness about the daily effects of hunger and
homelessness; and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital initiative week focuses on giving and caring the
week before Thanksgiving, and the observance serves as a  reminder  that
hunger  and  homelessness  do not stop for the holidays but continue all
year long; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the United States,  43.1  million  citizens  are  living
below  the  poverty  line,  one  in  five  of  those  being  children;
circumstantially, just over half a million people have nowhere to  sleep
at night; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hunger and Homelessness are grave concerns for the State of
New  York;  it  is  essential to eliminate these serious concerns and to
increase public awareness of the extent to which they exist; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to Feeding  America,  there  are  more  than  2.6
million  New  Yorkers,  or  one in eight people, who are considered food
insecure, meaning they do not have enough food to live a  healthy  life;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  the youngest residents of the State of New York, food
insecurity  is  more  prevalent,  affecting  one  in  five  children;
furthermore, as of 2018, New York State has an estimated 91,897 citizens
experiencing homelessness on any given day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York  is  fully committed to bringing
awareness to solving hunger and homelessness in all its communities,  as
well as providing necessary resources to residents in need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  is  committed  to  working  with food pantries,
shelters, and other service  organizations  which  need  support;  these
organizations  provide  food,  secure places to sleep, and other aids to
those who need it the most; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the  local,  State
and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 17-23,  2024,  as
Hunger  and Homelessness Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
