  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would add Article 14-C to the Retirement and Social Security
 Law,  creating  county  electable  twenty-year plans covering any county
 correction officers and deputy sheriffs engaged directly  in  correction
 officer duties that aggregate at least fifty percent of their service. A
 county  may elect to provide a retirement benefit equal to fifty percent
 of final average salary after twenty years  of  service.  A  county  may
 further  elect to provide for additional sixtieths for service in excess
 of twenty years. All service rendered as a correction officer,  sheriff,
 deputy sheriff or undersheriff, a member or officer of the State Police,
 a  paid  firefighter,  a  police officer, or an officer of any organized
 fire department or police force will be creditable. The retirement bene-
 fit is not to exceed seventy-five percent of final average salary.
  If this bill is enacted during the  2024  Legislative  Session,  there
 will  be  an increase in the annual contributions of any electing county
 for the fiscal year ending  March  31,  2025,  as  approximated  in  the
 following  table.  In future years, these costs will vary as the billing
 rates of the affected members change.
 
 Current Plan  Article 14-C  Article 14-C
  20-Year Plan  20-Year Plan
  with additional sixtieths
 Article 14 or Article 15  9.0%  10.3%
 89*, 25-Year Plans  4.9%  6.4%
 County Law Enforcement
 Article 14-B 25-Year Plan  3.7%  5.2%
 Article 14-B 25-Year Plan  2.1%  3.6%
 25-Year Plan
 with additional sixtieths
 
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service  cost  that  will  depend  upon  the  affected
 members' service, salary, tier, current retirement plan, and new retire-
 ment plan.  Once a county elects to provide this coverage, an exact cost
 will be determined based on a roster of eligible members provided by the
 county.  The past service cost may be amortized over a period of up to
 ten years.
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
