 EMPLOYER ELECTS TO PROVIDE SAME. (A) ANY MEMBER OF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM
 MAY  ELECT TO BECOME A MEMBER PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION
 WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER HE OR SHE BECOMES A MEMBER, IF HIS OR HER EMPLOYER

  (I)  UPON  COMPLETION OF TWENTY YEARS OF SUCH SERVICE AND UPON RETIRE-
 MENT, EACH SUCH MEMBER SHALL RECEIVE A PENSION SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE HIM
 OR HER WITH A RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO ONE-FORTIETH OF HIS  OR  HER

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would create Article 14-C in the Retirement and Social Secu-
 rity  Law,  creating  county electable 20-year plans covering any county
 S. 5883  4
 
 correction officers and deputy sheriffs engaged directly in at least 50%
 correction officer duties. A county may elect to  provide  a  retirement
 benefit  equal to 50% of final average salary after 20 years of service.
 A  county  may further elect to provide for additional 60ths for service
 beyond 20 years. All service rendered as a correction officer,  sheriff,
 undersheriff,  or  deputy  sheriff,  a  member  or  officer of the State
 Police, a paid firefighter, a police  officer,  or  an  officer  of  any
 organized  fire department or police force is creditable. The retirement
 benefit is not to exceed 75% of final average salary.
  If this bill is enacted during the  2023  legislative  session,  there
 will  be  an increase in the annual contributions of any electing county
 for the fiscal year ending  March  31,  2024,  as  approximated  in  the
 following  table.  In future years, these costs will vary as the billing
 rates of the affected members change.
 
 Current Plan  Electing 20-year plan  Electing 20-year plan
  plus additional 60ths
  A15  7.5%  8.5%
  89-e  4.3%  5.4%
  551  3.3%  4.4%
  551E  2.0%  3.1%
 
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service  cost  that  will  depend  upon  the  members'
 service, salary, tier, current retirement plan, and new retirement plan.
 Once  a  county  elects  to provide this coverage, an exact cost will be
 determined based upon a roster of eligible members provided by the coun-
 ty. The past service cost may be amortized over a period of  up  to  ten
 years.
  Further,  we  anticipate  additional administrative costs to implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  plan  qualification  issues:  granting
 correction  officers  service credit toward retirement in a 20-year plan
 could jeopardize the Retirement System's governmental  plan  status  and
 its  exemption  from ERISA. This development could result in the loss of
 qualified status, which would mean the loss of tax benefits. This result
 would substantially impair the Retirement System's  value  to  our  more
 than one million participants.
  Prior to the enactment of this legislation, we recommend that a favor-
 able ruling be obtained from the IRS stating that these provisions would
 not  harm the qualification status of the Retirement System. It is esti-
 mated that the costs to obtain such a ruling would be  $38,000  for  the
 services of the IRS, and $1,000 per hour for legal consultants.
