  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2024, as Polish American Heritage  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to call attention
to those months that are set aside to  serve  to  enhance  the  cultural
enrichment  of  the  State  of  New  York  and  preserve the heritage of
Polish-Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October  2024,  as  Polish
American  Heritage  Month  in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of National Polish American Heritage Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Polish  Americans  have  made  significant  lasting
contributions  to  New  York  State's  commonweal  in medicine, science,
business,  commerce,  politics,  the  arts,  music,  literature,  and
education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Polish  Americans  have  also  contributed to altering the
physical landscape of the cities they have inhabited, erecting monuments
to Polish American  heroes  such  as  General  Thaddeus  Kosciuszko  and
General  Casimir Pulaski; distinctive cultural phenomena such as vibrant
Polish American Cultural Societies or  the  Polish  Cathedral  style  of
architecture became part and parcel of the areas where Polish settlement
occurred; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to recognize
those important events such as  Polish  American  Heritage  Month  which
remind  us  of  the  rich  and  diverse  heritage of our great State and
Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Events which celebrate diversity and  peace  contribute  to
fulfilling  our  Nation's great legacy of equal opportunity for all, and
do so profoundly enhance our shared commitment to freedom  and  justice;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October  2024,  as  Polish
American  Heritage  Month  in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of National Polish American Heritage  Month;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
