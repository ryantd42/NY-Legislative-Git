  COMMEMORATING the 50th Anniversary of Mateflex
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially  to  the  economic  vitality of their communities, thereby
enhancing economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Mateflex; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1974, Mateflex  has  provided  quality  modular  tile
surfaces for an ever-growing list of applications; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1973, Edward Mele, an avid tennis player of over thirty
years, was investigating available tennis court surface styles  for  use
on  two  of his private, personal courts, when, through his research, he
found a product called Mateflex that had been used  as  a  tennis  court
surface overlay in many professional tournaments in Europe, and in three
of six Grand Prix Masters tournaments played elsewhere across the globe;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1973,  the  Grand  Prix  Masters  final  was played on
Mateflex in Boston, Massachusetts,  and  Edward  Mele  finally  had  the
opportunity to try the Mateflex Classic tennis surface in person for the
first time; and
 
  WHEREAS, After giving the material its initial test run, Edward Mele
immediately  purchased two brand new courts, and was so impressed by the
material that he began to consider the product as an option for  one  of
his  personal  business ventures, a plastic manufacturing plant based in
Utica, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Edward Mele, along with his brother Joseph Mele, an equally
successful and aggressive business partner in his own right,  ultimately
acquired  the  permission  to manufacture Mateflex in the United States,
forming the Mateflex-Mele Corporation in 1974; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1986, Mateflex has been developing their products and
technologies, introducing Mateflex II, Mateflex III, SoftFlex, TileFlex,
and CarpetFlex, ProGym and HomeCourt tiles, ProGym Plank,  and  TopCourt
tile, which, most recently, is taking the pickleball world by storm; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  humble  beginnings  with  just  a single tile design
strictly for tennis courts, Mateflex  now  has  multiple  product  lines
supporting limitless applications today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  Mateflex is in direct correlation to the
efforts of  its  hardworking  and  dedicated  staff,  all  of  whom  are
considered  integral parts of the success of Mateflex; their involvement
is, and always has been, characterized by an impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the business and the community it serves; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business, its contributions to  the  local
and  state  economies,  and its vibrant role in improving the quality of
life in its community, fully confident that it will  continue  to  enjoy
the  sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Mateflex; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Mateflex.
