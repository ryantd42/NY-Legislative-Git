 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Shulamith School for Girls to file
  with  the  county  of Nassau assessor an application for a retroactive
  real property tax exemption

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the  Shulamith  School  for Girls an application for exemption from real
 property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real  property  tax  law
 for the 2021-2022 assessment roll for all the 2021-2022 school taxes and
 all  the 2022 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such organization
 located at 158 Irving Place, hamlet  of  Woodmere,  town  of  Hempstead,
 county  of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county parcel ID section 39
 block 107 lot 1. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it
 had been received on or before the taxable status date  established  for
 such roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  County  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  rolls,  the applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
