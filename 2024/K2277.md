  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that are set aside to increase awareness and enhance the
profile of cultural  diversity  which  strengthens  the  fabric  of  the
communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 28, 2024, as Nepali
American Heritage Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal is a trusted  ally
of  our  great  State  and  Nation,  sharing  our  values  of democracy,
pluralism, freedom, and conservation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The modern government of Nepal began on Jestha 15, 2065  on
the  Nepali  calendar,  when  the  newly-elected  Constituent  Assembly
convened for the first time and  declared  Nepal  a  federal  democratic
republic,  and  its  anniversary  is now celebrated in Nepal as Republic
Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Beginning in the 1990s, people began emigrating from  Nepal
in  large  numbers  to  the  United States, which is now proudly home to
about 200,000 Nepali Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of  New  York  is  home  to  over  15,000  Nepali
Americans,  living  predominantly  in  New York City and concentrated in
Queens, where they constitute one of the fastest-growing populations  in
the city; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  is a vibrant Nepali American community in the State
of New York, impressing upon us their culture  and  values,  and  making
outstanding  contributions  in  the arts, sciences, academics, business,
sports, religion, politics, and philanthropy; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 28, 2024, as Nepali
American Heritage Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
