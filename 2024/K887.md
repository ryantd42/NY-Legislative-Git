  COMMENDING  Volunteer  Firefighter  Warren  Holmes
  upon the occasion of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition  after  50 years of dedicated service to
  the North Bailey Fire Company
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  valiant  firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery
every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  firefighters have lost their lives to save the lives
of others; each and every day, they face danger and peril  without  fear
and perform their job with the utmost concern and professionalism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  commend  Volunteer
Firefighter Warren Holmes upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for
special  recognition  after  50  years of dedicated service to the North
Bailey Fire Company; this momentous occasion will be celebrated  at  the
Annual  Installation of Officers banquet on Saturday, April 20, 2024, at
the Reikart Ballroom in Amherst, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Warren Holmes joined the North Bailey Fire Company on April
15, 1974, and is a Past Chief, serving from 1984 to 1988; he also served
as President of the Company from 2006 to 2014; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  and  fire  departments  not  only
provide the critical service of fire protection but also engage in other
activities  of  great  benefit  and  importance  to the communities they
serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Warren  Holmes  is  such  a  firefighter; throughout 50 years of devoted
service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the  call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Volunteer  Firefighter  Warren  Holmes  for  50  years  of
distinguished service; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Warren Holmes.
