  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 21 - 27, 2024, as National Passenger  Safety
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to increase awareness of concerns that
affect the lives of each and every New Yorker; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January  21-27,  2024,  as
National Passenger Safety Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Everyone  has an important role to play in increasing road
safety; in 2019, passenger  deaths  accounted  for  25  percent  of  all
traffic fatalities nationwide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety
Administration's (NHTSA) preliminary estimates, traffic deaths increased
seven percent in 2020, and 18 percent in the first six months  of  2021;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Passenger  vehicle  occupant  deaths  rose five percent in
2020; and
 
  WHEREAS, Historic increases in traffic deaths occurred  even  though
there was a 13 percent decrease in vehicle miles traveled; and
 
  WHEREAS, NHTSA's data shows the main behaviors driving this increase
were speeding, impaired driving and failure to wear seat belts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Whether  a  driver  is  impaired  by  alcohol or drugs, is
speeding, driving too aggressively, driving distracted  or  cannot  stay
awake  at  the  wheel,  bad  driving  choices  put passengers at risk of
serious injury or death; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of those lives might have been saved had  a  passenger
in  the  car  insisted  the  driver  slow down, stop texting, or not get
behind the wheel in the first place; and
 
  WHEREAS, Passengers - especially  teens  and  young  adults  -  need
education and encouragement to empower them to save lives by calling out
unsafe driving in the car as it happens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Parents  also  need  education  and encouragement to teach
their children about the importance of speaking up or not getting in the
car with someone who is drunk, drugged or distracted; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim January 21-27, 2024, as
National Passenger Safety Week in the State  of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
