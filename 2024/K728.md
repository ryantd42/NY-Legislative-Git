  RECOGNIZING and commending the National Conference
  of  State  Legislatures  on  its 50th anniversary in
  2025
 
  WHEREAS, The National Conference of State  Legislatures  (NCSL)  was
founded  in 1975, and has evolved during the past half-century to become
the  premier  organization  solely  dedicated  to  serving  state  and
territorial legislators and legislative staff; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It was created from the merger of three organizations that
served or represented state legislatures and that shared the belief that
legislative service is one of democracy's worthiest pursuits; And
 
  WHEREAS, NCSL is a bipartisan organization with three objectives: to
advance  the  effectiveness,  independence  and  integrity  of  state
legislatures; to foster interstate communication and cooperation; and to
ensure states a strong, cohesive voice in the federal system; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our Nation's state legislatures are America's laboratories
of democracy and have continually shown that  they  are  the  bodies  to
tackle  emerging  challenges;  state  legislatures are where people from
very different backgrounds, representing very different communities, can
come together and find common ground; NCSL has facilitated the  exchange
of  ideas,  provided critical research and information, and encouraged a
rigorous review of complex issues confronting our  communities,  states,
and  nation; NCSL also strives to strengthen the bonds between America's
state legislatures and the international community; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State Assemblymember John T. McDonald  III  serves
as a member of the NCSL Executive Committee and Assemblymember Michaelle
C.  Solages  previously served as a member of the Executive Committee;
furthermore, other members of this chamber contribute to NCSL with their
expertise and knowledge, and the partnership of NCSL and New York  State
continues to strengthen; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize and commend the National Conference of State Legislatures  for
their  superb  leadership  and  their  commitment  to  the  legislative
institution; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
