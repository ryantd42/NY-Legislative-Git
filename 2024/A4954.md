 repealing  any  such  exemption  or a local law, ordinance or resolution
 providing for a refund or credit described in subdivision (d) of section
 eleven hundred nineteen of this chapter or repealing such  provision  so
 provided  must  go  into  effect only on March first. No such local law,
 ordinance or resolution shall be effective unless a  certified  copy  of
 such  law,  ordinance or resolution is mailed by registered or certified
 mail to the commissioner at the commissioner's office in Albany at least
 ninety days prior to the date it is to become  effective.  However,  the
 commissioner  may  waive  and  reduce  such  ninety-day  minimum  notice
 requirement to a mailing of such certified copy by registered or  certi-
 fied  mail  within  a  period of not less than thirty days prior to such
 effective date if the commissioner deems such action  to  be  consistent
 with  the  commissioner's  duties  under section twelve hundred fifty of
 this  article  and  the  commissioner  acts  by  resolution.  Where  the
 restriction  provided for in section twelve hundred twenty-three of this
 article as to the effective date of a tax  and  the  notice  requirement
 provided  for  therein  are  applicable  and  have  not been waived, the
 restriction and notice requirement in  section  twelve  hundred  twenty-
 three of this article shall also apply.
