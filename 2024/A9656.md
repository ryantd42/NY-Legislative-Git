  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would modify section 89-q of the Retirement and Social Secu-
 rity Law to allow members of the New York  State  and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  employed  as  traffic officers by the Town of Elmira
 Traffic District Number 1 to  elect  to  be  covered  by  a  twenty-year
 retirement  plan providing a benefit of one-half of final average salary
 (FAS), without regard to age. Currently, such members are  permitted  to
 retire upon completion of twenty-five years of creditable service with a
 benefit of one-half of FAS.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $15,000 in the
 annual contributions of the Town of Elmira for the  fiscal  year  ending
 March  31,  2025. In future years this cost will vary but is expected to
 average 4.3% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $141,000 which  will  be
 borne by the Town of Elmira as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes
 that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
  To  opt  into  the twenty-year retirement plan, members must submit an
 application within one year of the effective date of this bill or within
 one year of entering employment with the Town of Elmira Traffic District
 Number 1 as a traffic officer. The bill will not be effective until  the
 first of January next succeeding the date it becomes law.
  These  estimated costs are based on 6 affected members employed by the
 Town of Elmira, with annual salary of approximately $300,000 as of March
 31, 2023. `
