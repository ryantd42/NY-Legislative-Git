BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  HONORING  Sara  Mitchell  upon the occasion of her
  designation for special recognition after  45  years
  of dedicated service to the Cazenovia Area Volunteer
  Ambulance Corps
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
give outstanding service to the people of the  Empire  State  and  whose
extraordinary  achievements  save  the  lives  of  their fellow citizens
should be recognized because their efforts so profoundly strengthen  our
shared commitment to family and community life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Sara  Mitchell  upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation  for  special
recognition  after  45  years of dedicated service to the Cazenovia Area
Volunteer Ambulance Corps, which was celebrated at its 50th  Anniversary
Banquet  on  Saturday,  March  2,  2024,  at the Hampton Inn & Suites in
Cazenovia, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The unity of  our  State  and  Nation  is  built  upon  the
compassion of those individuals within the State of New York who, in the
course of their jobs, perform acts of heroic dimension and who epitomize
the best of humanity; Sara Mitchell is one such individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer ambulance corps members are an important part of
the safety net of America's healthcare system; they  provide  lifesaving
care to those in need, 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Access to quality emergency care dramatically improves the
survival and recovery rate of those who  experience  sudden  illness  or
injury; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  1974  and  currently  based at 106 Nelson
Street, Cazenovia Area Volunteer Ambulance Corps has  been  serving  the
greater  Cazenovia  community seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and 365
days a year for five decades; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital  ambulance  corps  would  not  exist  without
individuals  such  as Sara Mitchell who sacrifice time spent with family
and friends to put in countless hours to help a neighbor in need as well
as those passing through; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by  an
individual  for  the benefit of others which Sara Mitchell has displayed
throughout her life; and
 
  WHEREAS, In  the  performance  of  her  duties,  Sara  Mitchell  has
demonstrated her character and her compassion for the welfare of others;
she is a tremendous asset to his EMS Unit and a distinguished citizen of
the State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our  unending  gratitude  and  respect  are  owed to these
devoted individuals whose responsibility is the preservation of life and
 
who make that responsibility their own by serving their local  ambulance
corps; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Sara Mitchell upon the occasion of  her  designation  for  special
recognition  after  45  years of dedicated service to the Cazenovia Area
Volunteer Ambulance Corps; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Sara Mitchell.
