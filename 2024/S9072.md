  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Each local government shall prepare and adopt an affordable
 housing plan. For the purposes of this  act,  "local  government"  shall
 mean  a  city,  town,  or village. Such plan shall identify the regional
 need for affordable housing, as well as the need for affordable  housing
 within  the  local  government.  Such plan shall specify how the munici-
 pality intends to increase the number of affordable housing units in the
 region and local government. In preparing the plan, the local government
 shall examine, but not be limited to the  following  options  to  create
 affordable  housing:  (a) the provision of financial assistance to home-
 buyers; (b) the production of  affordable  housing  for  sale;  (c)  the
 production of affordable housing for rent; (d) the production of afford-
 able  housing  in  conjunction with public/private partnerships; (e) the
 rehabilitation of existing buildings and structures for the  purpose  of
 conversion  to  affordable  housing; (f) the acquisition of interests in
 real property in existing housing stock to produce  affordable  housing;
 (g)  the creation of accessory dwelling units; (h) the creation of mixed
 use developments that include affordable housing; and (i) the  provision
 of housing counseling services.
  §  2. Such plan shall adhere to the following land use principles: (a)
 account for and minimize social, economic, and  environmental  costs  of
 new  development, including infrastructure costs such as transportation,
 sewers, and wastewater treatment, water, schools, recreation,  and  loss
 of  open space and agricultural land; (b) encourage development in areas
 where transportation, water, and sewage infrastructure are available  or
 practical;  (c)  protect,  preserve,  and enhance the state's resources,
 including  agricultural  land,  forests,  surface  waters,  groundwater,
 recreation  and  open  space, scenic areas, and significant historic and
 archeological sites; (d) promote coordination of state and local govern-

 ment decisions and cooperation among communities to work toward the most
 efficient, planned and cost-effective delivery  of  government  services
 by,  among  other means, facilitating cooperative agreements among adja-
 cent  communities, and to coordinate planning to ensure compatibility of
 one's community development with development of neighboring communities;
 (e) strengthen communities through development and redevelopment strate-
 gies that include integration of all income and age groups,  mixed  land
 uses,  and  compact  development,  traditional neighborhood development,
 planned unit development, open space districts, downtown revitalization,
 brownfield redevelopment, enhanced beauty in public spaces, and  diverse
 and community housing in close proximity to places of employment, recre-
 ation,  and  commercial development; (f) provide transportation choices,
 including increasing public transit and alternative modes of transporta-
 tion, in order to reduce automobile dependency, traffic congestion,  and
 automobile pollution; (g) ensure predictability in building and land use
 codes;  and  (h) provide for and encourage local governments to develop,
 through a collaborative community-based effort, plans that include  long
 term  land  use  and  permit  predictability and coordination, efficient
 decision making and planning implementation.
  § 3. Such plan may include the establishment of a  map  or  maps  that
 delineate  the  affordable housing recommendations proposed by the local
 government. Such plan shall be updated at least once every  five  years.
 Such plan shall ensure that all housing created remains affordable. Such
 plan  shall provide for the equitable distribution of affordable housing
 opportunities in the local government and region. The plan shall  ensure
 that  no  community  has  an  undue  concentration of affordable housing
 opportunities that would substantially alter the character of the commu-
 nity. In determining equitable distribution of affordable housing oppor-
 tunities, existing affordable housing opportunities in a community shall
 be considered.
  § 4. (a) The governing body of the local government shall hold  public
 hearings  and other informational meetings and organize other activities
 to inform residents about the process of preparing the plan.
  (b) The governing body of the local government shall hold at least one
 public hearing on the draft plan and one public  hearing  on  the  final
 plan. The local government shall post a copy of any draft plan or amend-
 ment to such plan on the website of the local government.
  (c) The final plan shall be adopted by the governing body by local law
 or  resolution,  as  appropriate,  no  later than December 31, 2024. All
 public hearings shall be on at least ten days' notice to the public. All
 notices of public hearings shall be published in the official  newspaper
 of the local government and posted on the official signboard and website
 of  the  local government. After adoption of the plan, the local govern-
 ment shall file the final plan in the office of the clerk of such  local
 government  and  post  the  plan on the website of the local government.
 Following such adoption, the local government shall regularly review and
 maintain such plan.
  § 5. If any clause, sentence, subdivision, paragraph, section or  part
 of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to
 be invalid, and such decision is not reversed or is otherwise deemed  to
 be  final, such judgment shall not have the effect of rendering this act
 invalid, inoperative and void.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
