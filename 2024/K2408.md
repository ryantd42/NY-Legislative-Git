  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2024, as Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness  Month
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months to help raise awareness about brain  diseases,  such  as
Alzheimer's,  and  the  need to increase efforts to combat its human and
economic costs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1910,  Alzheimer's  disease  was  named  after  Alois
Alzheimer by his senior colleague, psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin, who used
the term 'Alzheimer's disease' in his book "Psychiatrie"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Alzheimer's  disease  is  a progressive, neurodegenerative
brain disease that tragically leads to memory loss and cognitive decline
and is the most common type of dementia; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Institute on Aging  defines  dementia  as  the
loss  of  the  cognitive  functions  such  as thinking, remembering, and
reasoning to such an extent that it interferes  with  a  person's  daily
live and activities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1980, The Alzheimer's Association is the leading
organization  in  Alzheimer's care and research whose mission is to work
globally, nationally and locally to enhance the care and support of  all
those affected by Alzheimer's and other dementias; and
 
  WHEREAS,  President  Ronald  Regan  initiated  the  observance  of
Alzheimer's and  Brain  Awareness  Month  in  1983  to  not  only  raise
awareness  about  Alzheimer's,  but  to  also get people involved in the
recognition of the diseases as well as the types  of  care  required  by
someone suffering from it; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nearly seven million Americans are living with Alzheimer's
and more than 11 million provide their unpaid care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Age is the greatest risk  factor  for  Alzheimer's  disease
which  has no known cause or cure, however, there are strategies to help
prevent and treat dementias that  can  help  improve  the  prognoses  of
people living with these conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the latest statistics (2020), the number of
people aged 65 and older with Alzheimer's in New York is  426,500  which
is 12% of that 65 and older population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Women,  as  well  as  Latino  and Black Americans are at a
significantly higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and dementia; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nationally, one-in-three seniors dies with  Alzheimer's  or
another  dementia,  killing  more people than Breast Cancer and Prostate
Cancer combined; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other  dementias  will
cost the nation $360 billion dollars in 2024 and will increase to nearly
$1 trillion by 2050; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  the month of June, the Alzheimer's Association
encourages people around the globe to support the  movement  by  wearing
purple  as  an  opportunity  to  spread  the  word  about  and  discuss
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals  living  with  Alzheimer's  disease  and  their
caregivers  need  acknowledgment,  support,  and  services to meet their
needs over the lengthy progression of Alzheimer's  disease  and  related
dementias; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2024, as  Alzheimer's
and Brain Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOVED,  That  copies  of  this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and The Alzheimer's Association.
