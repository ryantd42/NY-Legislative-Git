  CONGRATULATING the members of the Broadalbin-Perth
  High  School  Odyssey  of  the  Mind  team  upon the
  occasion of their victory at the Odyssey of the Mind
  World Championship
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to act  in  accord
with  its  long-standing  traditions,  honoring  the  youth of today and
leaders of tomorrow, whose character and achievements best exemplify the
ideals and values cherished by this great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to  congratulate  the
members  of  the  Broadalbin-Perth  High School Odyssey of the Mind team
upon the occasion of their victory at the  Odyssey  of  the  Mind  World
Championship;  the  event  was  held  May  20-24,  2024,  at  Iowa State
University; and
 
  WHEREAS, Odyssey of the Mind is an international educational program
in which students from kindergarten through college learn how  to  think
divergently by working as a team to solve an open-ended problem; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  part of the Odyssey of the Mind program, students also
learn creativity, innovation, problem-solving, critical thinking, global
awareness,  interpersonal  and  collaborative  communication  skills,
self-direction, and adaptability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Division  3 team competed in Problem 2, entitled "AI
Tech-NO-Art," which challenged teams to design,  build,  and  operate  a
device  that determines if a work of art is beautiful or not; the device
needed to dismantle a work of art that it decides is  not  beautiful  to
create a new work of art it believes is beautiful; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to taking home the first-place trophy, the team
also won a Ranatra Fusca Award for exceptional creativity; they were one
of  only  four teams at the World Finals to receive a Ranatra Fusca, and
the only team from the United States to do so; the Broadalbin-Perth team
also won a  Ranatra  Fusca  at  the  New  York  State  Championships,  a
testament to their unwavering dedication and ingenuity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The triumphant Broadalbin-Perth High School Odyssey of the
Mind Team members are:  seniors,  Logan  Aery,  Lauryn  Donahue,  Blaine
Herrick, and Jacob Hughes; junior, Ryan Michalski; and coaches, Carl and
Alison Aery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  momentous  occasion  marks  the  first  team  in
Broadalbin-Perth history to win a world championship and was the  team's
fourth consecutive trip to the World Finals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Poised  eagerly  with  enthusiasm  and determined purpose,
these  scholars  now  stand  honorably,  with  just  pride  in  their
accomplishments  and  in  eager  anticipation  of  future  challenges,
understanding and appreciating the caring counsel and  support  provided
by their coaches, teachers, family, and friends; and
 
  WHEREAS, Educational competition instills the values of teamwork and
accomplishment,  and  these  outstanding  students  have  clearly made a
contribution to the spirit of excellence which is a tradition  of  their
school; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate the members of the Broadalbin-Perth High School Odyssey  of
the  Mind  team upon the occasion of their victory at the Odyssey of the
Mind World Championship; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  aforementioned  members  and  coaches  of  the
Broadalbin-Perth High School Odyssey of the Mind Team.
