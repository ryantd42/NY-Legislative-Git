  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Subdivision  8  of  section 3604 of the education law, as
 amended by chapter 359 of the laws  of  2023,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  8.  No  school shall be in session on a Saturday, the first day of the
 second lunar month after the winter solstice in the  preceding  calendar
 year  known  as  Asian  Lunar  New Year, THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE EIGHTH
 MONTH OF THE INDIAN CALENDAR IN EACH YEAR, KNOWN AS DIWALI, or  a  legal
 holiday,  except  general  election  day,  Washington's  birthday  and
 Lincoln's birthday, and except that  driver  education  classes  may  be
 conducted on a Saturday. A deficiency not exceeding four days during any
 school  year  caused  by  teachers'  attendance upon conferences held by
 superintendents of schools of city  school  districts  or  other  school
 districts  employing  superintendents of schools shall be excused by the
 commissioner, notwithstanding any provision of law, rule  or  regulation
 to the contrary, a school district may elect to schedule such conference
 days  in  the last two weeks of August, subject to collective bargaining
 requirements pursuant to article fourteen of the civil service law,  and
 such  days shall be counted towards the required one hundred eighty days
 of session, provided however, that such scheduling shall not  alter  the
 obligation  of the school district to provide transportation to students
 in non-public elementary and secondary schools or  charter  schools.  At
 least  two  such  conference days during such school year shall be dedi-
 cated to staff attendance upon conferences providing  staff  development
 relating  to  implementation  of  the  new  high  learning standards and
 assessments, as adopted by the board of regents.  Notwithstanding  any
 other  provision  of  law,  rule  or  regulation to the contrary, school

 and  assessments. A district making such election may provide such staff
 development on any day during which sessions are allowed and apply  such
 units  to  satisfy  a  deficiency  in  the  length  of one or more daily
 sessions of instruction for pupils as specified in  regulations  of  the
 commissioner.  The  commissioner  shall assure that such conference days
 include appropriate school violence prevention and  intervention  train-
 ing, and may require that up to one such conference day be dedicated for
 such purpose.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
