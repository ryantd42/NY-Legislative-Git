 AN ACT authorizing the Seaford Fire District to receive retroactive real
  property tax exempt status
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the Seaford Fire District an application for exemption from real proper-
 ty  taxes  pursuant  to  section  406  of the real property tax law with
 respect to the 2021-2022 assessment rolls for a portion of the 2021-2022
 school taxes and a portion of the 2022  general  taxes  for  the  parcel
 conveyed  to  such  organization  located  at  3844 Waverly Ave, town of
 Seaford, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau  county  parcel  ID
 section  57  block  156  lot  151. If accepted, the application shall be
 reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxable status date
 established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
