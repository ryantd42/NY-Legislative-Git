 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  general municipal law, in relation to extending
  provisions of law relating to urban development action areas
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  693  of the general municipal law, as amended by
 chapter 161 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  § 693. Area designation. An urban development  action  area  shall  by
 resolution  be  designated  by  the governing body, or by the commission
 where so authorized to act by the governing body, on its own  initiative
 or upon recommendation of the agency, provided at least sixty percent of
 such area is an eligible area. Any such designation shall be in conform-
 ance  with the standards and procedures required for all land use deter-
 minations  pursuant  to  general,  special  or  local  law  or  charter.
 Provided,  however,  that  if  a  proposed urban development action area
 project is to be developed on an eligible area and  consists  solely  of
 the  rehabilitation  or  conservation  of  existing  private or multiple
 dwellings or the construction of one to four unit  dwellings  or,  until
 June  thirtieth,  two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-SEVEN, for up to six
 urban development  action  area  projects  in  any  calendar  year,  the
 construction  of  up  to  ninety  dwelling units financed by the federal
 government and restricted to occupancy by the elderly or by persons with
 disabilities without any change in land use permitted by  local  zoning,
 the  governing body, or the commission where so authorized to act by the
 governing body, may waive the area designation requirement.
  § 2. Subdivision 5 of section 694 of the  general  municipal  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  161  of  the  laws  of 2021, is amended to read as
 follows:
  5. Any approval of an urban development action area project  shall  be
 in  conformance  with the standards and procedures required for all land
 use determinations pursuant to general, special or local law or charter.
 In a city having a population of one million or more, the governing body

 may require that the agency incorporate into the project any or  all  of
 the following: (i) the proposed number of residential units; (ii) wheth-
 er  such  units are home ownership units, rental units or condominium or
 cooperative units; (iii) a best estimate of the initial rents or selling
 prices for such units; (iv) the proposed income restrictions, if any, on
 renters  or  purchasers  of  such  units; and (v) the basis on which the
 consideration for the sale or lease of the property is to be determined.
 Provided, however, that if the proposed urban  development  action  area
 project  consists solely of the rehabilitation or conservation of exist-
 ing private or multiple dwellings or the construction  of  one  to  four
 unit  dwellings  or,  until  June  thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-four]
 TWENTY-SEVEN, for up to six urban development action  area  projects  in
 any  calendar  year,  the  construction  of  up to ninety dwelling units
 financed by the federal government and restricted to  occupancy  by  the
 elderly  or  by persons with disabilities without any change in land use
 permitted by local zoning, the governing body, or the  commission  where
 so authorized to act by the governing body, may waive any such standards
 and procedures required by local law or charter.
  §  3.  Paragraph  (d)  of  subdivision 6 of section 695 of the general
 municipal law, as amended by chapter 161 of the laws of 2021, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (d) Notwithstanding any standards or procedures established  for  land
 disposition  by  general,  special  or local law or charter, if an urban
 development action area project is to be developed on an  eligible  area
 and  consists  solely  of the rehabilitation or conservation of existing
 private or multiple dwellings or the construction of one  to  four  unit
 dwellings  or,  until June thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-
 SEVEN, for up to six urban  development  action  area  projects  in  any
 calendar  year, the construction of up to ninety dwelling units financed
 by the federal government and restricted to occupancy by the elderly  or
 by persons with disabilities without any change in land use permitted by
 local zoning, a municipality may dispose of the real property constitut-
 ing such urban development action project to any person, firm, or corpo-
 ration  qualified  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  by resolution of its
 governing body or, in any city having a population  of  one  million  or
 more,  by  action  of  the  mayor,  provided that such disposition is in
 accordance with the requirements of  this  subdivision.  Disposition  of
 real  property  acquired by condemnation shall be in accordance with the
 requirements of section four hundred six of the eminent domain procedure
 law, if applicable.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 if  this act shall have become a law after June 30, 2024, this act shall
 take effect immediately and shall be deemed to have been in  full  force
 and effect on and after June 30, 2024.
