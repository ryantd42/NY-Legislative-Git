  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE QUALITY, APPRO-
 PRIATENESS  AND  EFFECTIVENESS  OF  THE  CENTERS AND SHALL REPORT TO THE

 SUSPECTED  ABUSE OR MALTREATMENT BASED ONLY UPON A DIAGNOSIS OF NEONATAL
 ABSTINENCE SYNDROME OR NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME, OR ADMISSION
 TO A MATERNAL-INFANT CARE CENTER ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO  SECTION  TWEN-
 TY-FIVE  HUNDRED  NINE-D OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY
 OTHER GROUNDS TO SUSPECT ABUSE OR MALTREATMENT.
  § 3. Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (i) of subdivision (f)  of  section
 1012  of  the family court act, as amended by chapter 984 of the laws of
 1981, is amended to read as follows:
  (B) in providing the child with proper supervision or guardianship, by
 unreasonably inflicting or allowing to be inflicted harm, or a  substan-
 tial  risk  thereof,  including  the  infliction  of  excessive corporal
 punishment; or by misusing a drug or drugs;  or  by  misusing  alcoholic
 beverages to the extent that he loses self-control of his actions; or by
 any  other  acts  of a similarly serious nature requiring the aid of the
 court; provided, however, that where the respondent is  voluntarily  and
 regularly  participating  in a rehabilitative program, INCLUDING BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO A PROGRAM OFFERED AT A  MATERNAL-INFANT  CARE  CENTER  ESTAB-
 LISHED  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  TWENTY-FIVE  HUNDRED NINE-D OF THE PUBLIC
 HEALTH LAW, evidence that the respondent has repeatedly misused  a  drug
 or drugs or alcoholic beverages to the extent that he loses self-control
 of  his  actions shall not establish that the child is a neglected child

 mental or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger
 of  becoming impaired as set forth in paragraph (i) of this subdivision;
 or

 years  after  such date.  Effective immediately, the addition, amendment
 and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation
