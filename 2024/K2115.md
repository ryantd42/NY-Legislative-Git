BY: M. of A. Conrad
 
  HONORING  Kenmore Mercy Hospital upon the occasion
  of receiving the 2023 Leapfrog  Top  Hospital  Award
  for Outstanding Quality and Patient Safety
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
institutions  which  have  faithfully  served  the  health  needs of the
community  and  its  citizens  with  unwavering  diligence,  unrelenting
compassion,  and  a  strong sense of commitment to upholding the highest
practices and standards in their field; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Kenmore  Mercy Hospital upon the occasion of receiving the 2023 Leapfrog
Top Hospital Award for Outstanding Quality and Patient Safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Leapfrog  Group  is  a  national  industry  watchdog
organization  of  employers  and  other  large purchasers of health care
known for setting the  toughest  quality  standards;  the  Leapfrog  Top
Hospital  Award  is  widely  acknowledged as one of the most competitive
awards and American hospital can receive; and
 
  WHEREAS, To qualify for this distinction, hospitals  must  rank  top
among  peers  on the Leapfrog Hospital Survey, an assessment of hospital
performance centered on the highest standards for  quality  and  patient
safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Of  more than 2,100 hospitals considered for this esteemed
accolade, only 35 general hospitals were  successful  in  receiving  the
coveted award; Kenmore Mercy Hospital was one such hospital of the 35 in
the nation, and was the only hospital in New York State to be designated
for this recognition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Along  with  this  momentous  designation,  Kenmore  Mercy
Hospital received its twentieth consecutive "A" Safety Grade, making  it
one  of  only  36 hospitals in the country, and the only one in New York
with this distinction; and
 
  WHEREAS, Proving patient safety to be the utmost priority  time  and
time  again,  Kenmore  Mercy  Hospital  is justly deserving of this 2023
Leapfrog Top Hospital Award for Outstanding Quality and Patient  Safety,
and  merits the applause of all citizens of this great State and Nation;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Kenmore  Mercy  Hospital  is  in  direct
correlation to the efforts of its President, Walt Ludwig, as well as its
host  of dedicated doctors, nurses, support staff, and volunteers, whose
involvement is, and always has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive
commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard of
excellence in all endeavors  on  behalf  of  the  organization  and  the
community it serves; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Kenmore Mercy Hospital upon the occasion  of  receiving  the  2023
 
Leapfrog  Top Hospital Award for Outstanding Quality and Patient Safety;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Kenmore Mercy Hospital.
