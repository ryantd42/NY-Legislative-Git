  (d) If it shall appear, to the satisfaction of the  Attorney  General,

 tants,  certificate-holders  and participants of both TIAA and CREF, and
 (ii) the procedural requirements set forth in subdivision  (c)  of  this
 section have been satisfied, the Attorney General shall approve the Plan
 of Combination.
  (e) Upon obtaining the respective approvals of the members of CREF and
 the sole stockholder of TIAA, the Plan of Combination shall be submitted
 to  the  Superintendent,  for review and approval in accordance with the
 procedures set forth in section 7105 of the insurance law.
  (f) Thereafter, once all other required regulatory approvals to effec-
 tuate the combination have been obtained, TIAA shall  file  a  certified
 copy  of  the Plan of Combination, with the approvals of the Superinten-
 dent and the Attorney General affixed thereto,  in  the  office  of  the

 clerk of the county of New York. Upon the completion of such filing, the
 combination shall become effective.
  § 4. (a) At the effective time of and pursuant to the Plan of Combina-
 tion,  all assets and liabilities of CREF including causes of action and
 defenses thereto, shall vest by operation of law in TIAA, and all  vari-
 able  annuity  contracts and certificates issued by CREF and in force at
 the effective time of the combination, shall be and become TIAA variable
 annuity contracts and certificates as  of  the  effective  time  of  the
 combination; provided, however, that at the effective time of the combi-
 nation:  (i)  without further act or deed, the assets and liabilities of
 CREF relating to the outstanding variable annuity contracts and  certif-
 icates  of CREF shall immediately be assets and liabilities of and allo-
 cated to the TIAA Separate Account without such assets becoming  general
 account  assets  of TIAA; and (ii) each investment account of CREF imme-
 diately prior to the combination shall comprise  an  investment  sub-ac-

 each such investment account vesting immediately and  directly  in  that

  (b)  At  the  effective time, TIAA shall assume the obligations of all
 CREF contracts and certificates, and all holders of CREF  contracts  and
 certificates shall be notified of the combination.
  (c)  At all times the assets of the TIAA Separate Account, and of each
 investment sub-account, shall be  segregated  from  the  assets  of  the
 general  account of TIAA and any other TIAA separate account and invest-
 ment sub-account. That portion  of  the  assets  of  the  TIAA  Separate
 Account,  and of each investment sub-account, not exceeding the reserves
 and other contract liabilities with respect to the TIAA Separate Account
 and each investment sub-account, shall not be  chargeable  with  liabil-
 ities  arising  out of any other business of TIAA. The income, gains and
 losses, whether or not realized, from assets allocated to the TIAA Sepa-
 rate Account, and each investment sub-account, shall be credited  to  or
