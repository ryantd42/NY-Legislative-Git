  WHEREAS,  Built in 1948 to 1949, Clinton Arena, also known as Edward
W.  Stanley Recreation Center, is a community staple that has provided a
space for sports and gatherings for the last 75 years; and

duration  and  has  even burned down; after the unfortunate destruction,
Clinton Arena was rebuilt in 1954; and

League's Clinton Comets and is prominently known as an ice hockey  rink;

team,  Clinton  Figure  Skating  Club,  and  the  Clinton  Youth  Hockey
Organization; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  capacity to seat 2,000 people and 300 standing,
Clinton Arena has hosted high profile events such as an  NHL  pre-season
game  between  the Buffalo Sabres and the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2018,
the filming of a portion of the movie Slap Shot, and in 2006  the  first
annual "Hockey town" event between Hamilton and Utica College; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  April  14,  2018,  the  Clinton  Arena  won  the Kraft
Hockeyville  U.S.  Grand  Prize  and  was  granted  with  generous  rink
upgrades;  the  Arena  continues to undergo improvements and renovations
with support from State and local organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the seasons, Clinton Arena is a destination much
appreciated by the residents of Clinton, New York and visitors who  seek
the  historical, cultural, and recreational resources of the area; it is
a source of pride and community heritage; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Clinton Arena; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Clinton Arena.
