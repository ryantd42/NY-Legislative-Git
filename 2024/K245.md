BY: M. of A. Burke
 
  HONORING the members of the Buffalo Bills Training
  and  Medical  Staff  for  their immediate and heroic
  actions in saving the life of Buffalo  Bills  safety
  Damar Hamlin
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
those individuals within the State of New York who,  in  the  course  of
their jobs, perform acts of heroic dimension; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the members of the Buffalo Bills Training and Medical  Staff  for  their
immediate  and heroic actions in saving the life of Buffalo Bills safety
Damar Hamlin; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Monday, January 2, 2023, during the primetime  NFL  Week
17  match-up  between  the  Buffalo  Bills  and  the Cincinnati Bengals,
24-year-old Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into  cardiac  arrest
after  making  a  routine  tackle  within  the first nine minutes of the
game's first quarter; and
 
  WHEREAS, Damar Hamlin's heartbeat  was  restored  on  the  field  at
Paycor  Stadium  after  Buffalo  Bills' Training and Medical Staff, most
notably Assistant  Athletic  Trainer  Denny  Kellington,  spent  several
minutes  administering CPR surrounded by players from both organizations
who circled together and knelt in prayer; and
 
  WHEREAS, With his fight captivating the world,  Damar  Hamlin  spent
most  of  the  days  following  his collapse on a ventilator in critical
condition at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center while  the  NFL
world, the sports world, and all of humanity came together in support of
No. 3; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Damar  Hamlin's  recovery continues to trend in a positive
direction; his ventilator was removed, his neurologic  function  remains
intact, and he has since been released from the hospital and returned to
his  beloved  community  of  Buffalo,  New  York,  all  thanks  to  the
preparedness and expertise of  this  extraordinary  Buffalo  Bills  care
team; and
 
  WHEREAS, Justly recognized as heroes, the training and medical staff
of  the  Buffalo  Bills  richly merit the admiration of this Legislative
Body and the Buffalo community for their  consummate,  swift  action  in
saving the life of this young man; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Moreover,  they  should  be  meritoriously  commended  for
remaining calm under pressure and for showing  valor  and  true  courage
while performing this lifesaving deed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In the performance of their duties, the remarkable members
of the Buffalo Bills  Training  and  Medical  Staff  demonstrated  their
character  as  well  as  their compassion for the welfare of their team;
they truly are tremendous assets to the Buffalo Bills organization; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body that when an act
of such heroism is brought to our official attention, the same should be
memorialized for the edification and emulation of all;  now,  therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor the members of the Buffalo Bills Training and  Medical  Staff  for
their  immediate  and heroic actions in saving the life of Buffalo Bills
safety Damar Hamlin; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  members  of the Buffalo Bills training and medical
staff.
