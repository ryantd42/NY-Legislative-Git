 state teachers' retirement system, as defined by paragraph a of subdivi-
 sion two of  section  five  hundred  seventeen  of  the  education  law,

 tax levy necessary for expenditures for the coming fiscal year for local
 government employer  contributions  to  the  New  York  state  teachers'
 retirement system caused by growth in the normal contribution rate minus
 two percentage points[.];
