 AN  ACT  authorizing the county of Nassau assessor to accept an applica-
  tion for a real property tax exemption from Lubavitch of Old Westbury
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Lubavitch of Old Westbury an application for exemption from real proper-
 ty  taxes pursuant to section 420-a and 462 of the real property tax law
 with respect to the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 assessment rolls for all  of
 the  2021-2022  and  2022-2023 school taxes and all of the 2022 and 2023
 general taxes for the parcel owned by such organization located  at  153
 Bacon  Road,  town of Old Westbury, county of Nassau, otherwise known as
 Nassau county tax map section 19, block E, lot 2000.  If  accepted,  the
 application  shall  be  reviewed as if it had been received on or before
 the taxable status date established for such assessment roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject roll. If such exemption is  granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject roll, the applicable governing body or tax  department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
