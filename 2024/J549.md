BY: Senator KENNEDY
 
  COMMENDING Charles Everhart, Jr. upon the occasion
  of  his designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal,
  the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
  New York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Charles  Everhart,  Jr. upon the occasion of his designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In January of  2023,  Buffalo  school  bus  driver  Charles
Everhart, Jr. was in the midst of his very first solo route dropping off
a  young student at the corner of Seventh and Carolina streets, a couple
of blocks from the student's residence in an apartment complex, when  he
heard  loud  gunshots  ring  out  from  a  group of boys on the adjacent
corner, about 50 feet away; and
 
  WHEREAS, Charles Everhart, Jr. immediately sprang  into  action  and
ran  to the back of the bus to lift the hatch and yelled for the student
to keep running; the commotion caused the young men who were involved in
the shooting to flee on foot; and
 
  WHEREAS, Charles Everhart, Jr. then alerted police,  told  them  the
direction  the  youths  ran  and drove around the block to the student's
address to make sure he entered his residence safely;  due  to  Charles'
selfless efforts, the frightened second grader made it home safely; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A few weeks later, Charles Everhart, Jr. was assigned that
same bus route and took an extra few  minutes  to  drive  the  grateful,
young boy right to his door; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Charles  Everhart, Jr. has always been an active member of
his community as a member of the True Bethel Baptist  Church  and  as  a
volunteer for various organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prior to his position with First Student, Charles Everhart,
Jr.  was  the  Regional  Manager  of  Hallcon/Renzenberger where he flew
across the country training other regional managers; in  this  capacity,
he  was responsible for 300 drivers, eight supervisors, and 100 vehicles
in five states; and
 
  WHEREAS, Charles Everhart, Jr., in his spontaneous and heroic  acts,
has  so  aptly demonstrated his character and compassion for the welfare
of others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern
of ordinary  citizens  across  the  community  of  New  York  State  who
voluntarily  respond without thought of danger or reward when others are
in need of help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Charles  Everhart,  Jr. upon the occasion of his designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Charles Everhart, Jr.
