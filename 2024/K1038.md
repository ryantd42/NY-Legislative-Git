  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 22, 2024, as Ameloblastoma Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days that are set aside to increase awareness of the wellbeing
and livelihood of the public; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Friday, March 22, 2024, as
Ameloblastoma Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ameloblastoma is  a  rare  head  and  neck  tumor  with  an
estimated annual incidence of 0.5 per million population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ameloblastoma typically develop in the jaw near the molars
but manifest in different forms; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ameloblastoma are typically benign but  can  rarely  become
cancerous (malignant) in some cases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Despite  that  they  are  benign and slow-growing lesions,
Ameloblastoma  exhibit  locally  destructive  behavior  with  a  high
recurrence rate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  their slow growth, Ameloblastoma can go unnoticed
before potential problems are noticed; and
 
  WHEREAS, If left untreated, ameloblastoma can grow large and pose  a
risk to the airway; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative  that  awareness  of  Ameloblastoma  is
available to the public in order to lower the chance of potential risks;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Ameloblastoma Day  in  the  State  of  New  York  increases
awareness  of  this  condition  and  of  those  who  live  with it; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  22,  2024, as
Ameloblastoma Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
