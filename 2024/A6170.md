 AN ACT to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to the notice
  required for the termination of temporary payments of compensation and
  the notice required for cessation of compensation payments

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Subdivision 3 of section 21-a of the workers' compensation
 law, as amended by chapter 6 of the laws of 2007, is amended to read  as
 follows:
  3. An employer may cease making temporary payments of compensation and
 prescribed medicine if such employer delivers within [five] SIXTEEN days
 after  the last payment, to the injured employee and the board, a notice
 of  termination  of  temporary  payments  of  compensation  on  a  form
 prescribed  by  the board. Such notice shall inform the injured employee
 that the employer is  ceasing  temporary  payment  of  compensation  and
 prescribed medicine. Upon the cessation of temporary payments of compen-
 sation  and  prescribed  medicine, all parties to any action pursuant to
 this chapter shall retain all  rights,  defenses  and  obligations  they
 would  otherwise  have  pursuant  to this chapter without regard for the
 temporary payment of compensation and prescribed medicine.
  § 2. Paragraph (d) of subdivision 1 of  section  25  of  the  workers'
 compensation  law,  as  amended  by  chapter 635 of the laws of 1996, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (d) Whenever for any reason compensation payments cease, the  employer
 or  its insurance carrier shall within [sixteen] THIRTY days thereafter,
 send to the chair a notice on a form prescribed by the chair  that  such
 payment  has  been  stopped,  which notice shall contain the name of the
 injured employee or his or her principle dependent, the  date  of  acci-
 dent,  the date to which compensation has been paid and the whole amount
 of compensation paid. In case the  employer  or  its  insurance  carrier

 fails  so  to  notify  the  chair  of  the  cessation of payments within
 [sixteen] THIRTY days after the date  on  which  compensation  has  been
 paid, the board may impose a penalty upon such employer or its insurance
 carrier  in  the amount of three hundred dollars, which shall be paid to
 the claimant. Such penalty shall be collected in like manner as an award
 of compensation.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
