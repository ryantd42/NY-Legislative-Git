  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "NY Home Energy Affordable Transition Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares that:
  1. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act  (the  "CLCPA")
 created  legal  mandates for dramatic greenhouse gas emission reductions
 from all sectors of New York's economy. The CLCPA also emphasizes equity
 in addressing climate change by requiring all state agencies and author-
 ities to prioritize reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollu-
 tants in disadvantaged communities and by mandating that  certain  state
 investments deliver benefits to these communities.
  2.  Buildings  are  New  York's largest source of greenhouse gas emis-
 sions, accounting for approximately  one-third  of  the  greenhouse  gas

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 4592--A  2
 
 emissions  in  our  state.  New York state's buildings also produce more
 local air pollution than any other state in the  country,  resulting  in
 negative health outcomes such as increased rates of asthma, particularly
 among  children,  and  heart disease. Therefore, reducing greenhouse gas
 emissions and toxic air pollution emitted  from  New  York's  buildings,
 especially  in disadvantaged communities, is necessary to meet the CLCPA
 mandates.
  3. To meet the state's bold climate and equity mandates, New York will
 need to update how it regulates  gas  utility  service.  Doing  so  will
 enable strategic planning and investments in neighborhood-scale building
 decarbonization  and  help  bring  the statewide gas distribution system
 into alignment with the two  thousand  thirty  and  two  thousand  fifty
 greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  mandates  in  the CLCPA through an
 orderly and equitable process, coordinated with appropriate  investments
 in  the electric system to ensure all New Yorkers have non-discriminato-
 ry, affordable access to the energy needed  for  heating,  cooling,  and
 powering the buildings in which they live and work.
  4.  The  New  York  public  service  law not only contains barriers to
 neighborhood-scale building decarbonization solutions  such  as  thermal
 energy  networks,  but  also  works  at  cross purposes with the state's
 climate and  affordability  goals,  by  requiring  and  subsidizing  the
 continued expansion of natural gas infrastructure.
  a.  The gas utility obligation to serve codified in the public service
 law is a  major  obstacle  to  utilities  developing  neighborhood-scale
 building decarbonization projects that would facilitate bringing the gas
 system  into  alignment  with  the  two thousand thirty and two thousand
 fifty greenhouse gas emission reduction  mandates  in  the  CLCPA  in  a
 manner that can mitigate costs for all utility customers, reduces green-
 house  gas  emissions and co-pollutants impacting local air quality, and
 provides a transition for impacted workers.
  b. Statutorily mandated utility system  extension  allowances  require
 existing  ratepayers  to  subsidize  gas  infrastructure hookups for new
 customers. According to a recent joint filing with  the  Public  Service
 Commission  by  the  New York state gas utilities, these required allow-
 ances cost gas utilities hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  per  year.
 These costs are passed directly to existing gas customers.
  c.  Gas  utilities in New York are on track to collectively spend $150
 billion to replace thousands of miles of leak prone pipe in  the  coming
 years.  These  investments pose a risk of becoming stranded assets, with
 $77 billion of the total cost coming due after 2050, but can be  avoided
 in many cases by strategically investing in neighborhood-scale decarbon-
 ization projects.
  5.  New  Yorkers  are suffering from dramatic fossil fuel price spikes
 driven by the increasingly integrated global commodity  market,  subject
 to  the  whims  of  foreign dictators such as Russia's Vladimir Putin or
 Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed  bin  Salman.  Fossil  fuel  prices  have
 spiked  to historic high levels, making both electricity and gas utility
 service unaffordable  for  many  New  Yorkers.  Decarbonizing  buildings
 through  the strategic development of neighborhood-scale building decar-
 bonization projects, along  with  investing  in  energy  efficiency  and
 renewable  electricity,  will  save  New  Yorkers  money  now and in the
 future, protect against price volatility, and promote true energy  inde-
 pendence for New York state.
  6. Fossil fuel price spikes are exacerbating the affordability impacts
 of  the  COVID-19  Pandemic.  Over  a million households in New York now
 struggle to pay their utility bills. The Public Service  Commission  has
 A. 4592--A  3

 declared,  but  not  yet  achieved, a goal that customers should not pay
 more than 6% of their income for utility energy services, a number based
 on a nationally accepted standard.
  7.  Thus,  it  is  the  intent of the legislature to enact the NY Home
 Energy Affordable Transition Act for the following purposes:
  a. to ensure that the public  service  law  regarding  regulation  and
 oversight  of  gas  utilities  will provide for the timely and strategic
 decarbonization and right-sizing of the gas  distribution  system  in  a
 just  and  affordable manner as required to meet the climate justice and
 emission reduction mandates of the CLCPA, appropriately balancing  rate-
 payers'  needs  and  interests with the maintenance of financially sound
 utilities, prioritizing low-to-moderate income customers  and  disadvan-
 taged communities, and encouraging neighborhood-scale transitions;
  b. to provide the Public Service Commission with the statutory author-
 ity  and  direction  to  align utility regulations and planning with the
 CLCPA climate justice and emission reduction mandates and to require the
 Public Service Commission to take a proactive role in the  timely  iden-
 tification  and  amendment of such regulations or rulings as may pose an
 impediment to achieving CLCPA mandates, and to identify  any  laws  that
 may pose an impediment;
  c.  to  end  statutorily mandated, ratepayer-subsidized incentives for
 the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure while maintaining the  equi-
 table  provision  of  electric  service  for efficient heating, cooling,
 cooking, hot water, and other uses;
  d. to provide affordable access to electricity for heating and cooling
 and to protect  low-income  and  moderate-income  customers  from  undue
 burdens as they decarbonize their buildings; and
  e.  to  clarify that municipal building codes regulating on-site emis-
 sions are not preempted under New York state law.
  8. This legislation does not establish a ban on the use of gas. It  is
 neither  the  intent  nor  would it be the effect of this legislation to
 require the immediate transition of any existing gas customer to  alter-
 native heating and cooling services.
  §  3. Subdivision 1 of section 4 of the public service law, as amended
 by chapter 594 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  1. There shall be in the department of public service a public service
 commission, which shall possess the powers and duties hereinafter speci-
 fied, and also all powers necessary or proper to enable it to carry  out
 the  purposes  of  this chapter AND TO ENABLE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CLIMATE
 JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE  HUNDRED  SIX  OF
 THE  LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNC-
 TION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.  The commission shall  consist  of
 five  members,  to  be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice
 and consent of the senate. A commissioner shall be designated as [chair-
 man] CHAIRPERSON of the commission by the  governor  to  serve  in  such
 capacity  at  the  pleasure  of the governor or until his OR HER term as
 commissioner expires whichever first occurs. At least  one  commissioner
 shall  have  experience in utility consumer advocacy. No more than three
 commissioners may be members of the same political party unless,  pursu-
 ant to action taken under subdivision two of this section, the number of
 commissioners  shall  exceed  five,  and in such event no more than four
 commissioners may be members of the same political party.

 USE  OF NATURAL GAS IN WASTEFUL DEVICES AND PRACTICES, AS DEFINED BY THE
 COMMISSION, AND REQUIRE CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY IN GAS USAGE.
  12-E. THE COMMISSION SHALL REVIEW THE  CAPITAL  CONSTRUCTION  PLAN  OF
 EACH  GAS CORPORATION AND ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO EXAMINE FEASIBLE ALTER-
 NATIVES TO SUCH CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE  CONSISTENCY  WITH  THE
 CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND
 FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, ENCOURAGING  NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE
 TRANSITIONS  AWAY  FROM  FUELS WITH HIGH LIFE-CYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS EMIS-
 SIONS AND ON-SITE CO-POLLUTANT EMISSIONS,  PRIORITIZING  LOW-TO-MODERATE
 INCOME  CUSTOMERS  AND  DISADVANTAGED  COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED IN SECTION
 75-0101 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL  CONSERVATION  LAW.  SUCH  PROCESS  SHALL
 INCLUDE  THRESHOLDS  AND  CRITERIA  FOR THE TYPES OF PROJECTS SUBJECT TO
 SUCH EXAMINATION. THE COMMISSION SHALL  REQUIRE  PARTICIPATION  IN  SUCH
 PROCESS BY EACH ELECTRIC CORPORATION WITH A SERVICE AREA OVERLAPPING THE
 SERVICE  AREA  OF THE GAS CORPORATION; AND THE COMMISSION SHALL HAVE THE
 POWER TO REQUIRE ANY SUCH ELECTRIC CORPORATION TO PARTICIPATE IN  ALTER-
 NATIVES  TO GAS CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING PARTICIPATION IN FINANC-
 ING. ANY COSTS INCURRED BY SUCH ELECTRIC  CORPORATION  FOR  SUCH  CORPO-
 RATION'S  PARTICIPATION  SHALL  BE  SUBJECT  TO  AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FULL
 RECOVERY, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSION.
  § 10. Section 66-a of the public service law, as added by chapter 7 of
 the laws of 1948, subdivision 1 as amended and subdivision 3 as added by
 chapter 582 of the laws of 1975, subdivision 2 as amended by chapter 722
 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
  § 66-a. Conservation of gas,  declaration  of  policy,  delegation  of
 power.  1.  It  is hereby declared to be the policy of this state that
 when there develops in any area a situation under  which  a  gas  corpo-
 ration supplying gas to such area is unable to meet the reasonable needs
 of  its  consumers  and  of  persons or corporations applying for new or
 additional gas service, the available supply of gas shall  be  allocated
 among  the  customers  of such gas corporation, in such manner as may be
 necessary to protect public health and safety and to avoid  undue  hard-
 ship,  PARTICULARLY  FOR  LOW-TO-MODERATE  INCOME RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS,
 ELECTRIC GENERATION NEEDED FOR ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY, AND  CUSTOM-
 ERS  WITH  HARD-TO-ELECTRIFY INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USES, pursuant to
 rules and regulations as may be adopted by the commission, and  that  to
 carry  out  this  declared policy the jurisdiction of the public service
 commission should be clarified.  IT IS FURTHER DECLARED TO BE THE POLICY
 OF THIS STATE THAT GAS SERVICE TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS MUST BE PROVIDED IN
 A MANNER THAT IS SAFE AND ADEQUATE, NOT UNJUSTLY DISCRIMINATORY OR UNDU-
 LY PREFERENTIAL, AND IN ALL RESPECTS JUST AND REASONABLE.
  2. Notwithstanding the provisions of any statute or any franchise held
 by a gas corporation, the commission shall have power, upon the  finding
 that CONTINUED GAS SERVICE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE
 CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND
 FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, OR THAT  there  exists  such  a
 shortage  of  gas  in  any  area  in the state, that the gas corporation
 supplying such area is unable and will be unable to  secure  or  produce
 sufficient  gas  to  meet  the  reasonable needs of its customers and of
 A. 4592--A  10
 
 persons or corporations applying for new or additional gas  service,  to
 require such corporation to immediately discontinue the supplying of gas
 to  additional  customers  or of supplying additional service to present
 customers,  for  such  purpose  or  purposes as may be designated by the
 commission, or to customers using gas for a purpose  prohibited  by  the
 commission  pursuant  to  this  act,  and that upon the finding that the
 supply of gas available is  and  will  be  insufficient  to  supply  the
 demands  of  all consumers receiving service, to require such gas corpo-
 ration to curtail or discontinue  service  to  any  or  all  classes  of
 customers  of  such  gas  corporation.  In  imposing such a direction or
 requirement, the commission shall give consideration first  to  existing
 domestic  uses  and  uses  deemed  to  be necessary by the commission to
 protect public health and safety and to avoid undue hardship [and  shall
 be  limited  to the period of the emergency provided that the gas corpo-
 ration affected shall make such restriction,  curtailing  or  discontin-
 uance  applicable  to  all customers or applicants for service in a like
 class. If the commission determines that good cause exists for supplying
 service to additional customers or for supplying additional  service  to
 some  existing  customers, notwithstanding the curtailment or discontin-
 uance of service to other existing customers, it shall,  to  the  extent
 feasible, allocate gas with equal priority to new or additional domestic
 uses  of  gas  and  commercial or industrial processes which require gas
 because there is no practical substitute for it in  such  proportion  as
 the  commission  determines to be reasonable.  Provided that the commis-
 sion shall be permitted, after public hearing, to authorize any  natural
 gas  produced  from  lands  under the waters of Lake Erie to be used for
 process or feedstock requirements].  The  commission  is  authorized  to
 adopt such rules, regulations and orders as are necessary or appropriate
 to carry out these delegated powers.
  3.  In carrying out the delegated powers provided for in this section,
 the commission shall, to the extent practicable, determine and establish
 gas conservation measures or standards, INCLUDING ENERGY EFFICIENT ELEC-
 TRIFICATION OF GAS END USES. The commission may require compliance  with
 such measures or standards as a condition of receiving service.
  4.  THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NEW OR ADDI-
 TIONAL GAS SERVICE IS WARRANTED NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  NEED  TO  CONSERVE
 RESOURCES  FOR  SERVICE  TO EXISTING GAS CUSTOMERS.  SUCH DETERMINATION
 SHALL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND
 EMISSION  REDUCTION  MANDATES  IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF
 TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND  FUNCTION  AS  MAY
 ARISE  FROM  TIME  TO  TIME, AND MAY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS INCLUDING
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IMPACTS ON NEW AND  EXISTING  CUSTOMERS  INCLUDING
 LOW-TO-MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS, IMPACTS ON SYSTEM SAFETY AND ADEQUACY,
 EQUITY  TOWARD  EXISTING CUSTOMERS WITH LIMITED CONVERSION ALTERNATIVES,
 AND THE FEASIBILITY OF NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE ALTERNATIVES TO USAGE OF FUELS
 WITH HIGH LIFE-CYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND  ON-SITE  CO-POLLUTANT
 EMISSIONS, INCLUDING THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS.
  5.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  REQUIRE  GAS  AND/OR ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO
 PROVIDE COORDINATION ASSISTANCE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, IN SUCH  FORMS
 AS  THE  COMMISSION  DEEMS REASONABLY REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATE ENERGY
 POLICY, TO IDENTIFY AND ADOPT ALTERNATIVES WHERE APPLICATIONS FOR NEW OR
 ADDITIONAL GAS SERVICE ARE DENIED AND ENCOURAGE NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE TRAN-
 SITIONS.
  § 11. Section 66-b of the public service law is REPEALED.
  § 12. The public service law is amended by adding a new  section  66-w
 to read as follows:
 A. 4592--A  11
 
  §  66-W.  EXPANSION  OF  GAS  DISTRIBUTION  INFRASTRUCTURE.  EXCEPT AS
 PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION, AND NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER  PROVISION  OF
 THIS  CHAPTER, AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, NO
 GAS CORPORATION SHALL COMMENCE  CONSTRUCTION  OF  NEW  GAS  DISTRIBUTION
 INFRASTRUCTURE  THE RESULT  OF WHICH WOULD BE TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY
 OF SERVICE INTO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE GAS  SERVICE  WAS  NOT  AVAILABLE
 PRIOR TO THAT DATE AS DEFINED BY THE APPLICABLE UTILITY'S CERTIFICATE OF
 PUBLIC  CONVENIENCE  AND  NECESSITY APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION. NO  SUCH
 NEW GAS DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE  SHALL BE PUT  INTO  SERVICE  AFTER
 DECEMBER  THIRTY-FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE. THE COMMISSION  MAY
 AUTHORIZE  EXCEPTIONS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, PROVIDED THAT THE COMMIS-
 SION FINDS THAT THE  PROJECT  QUALIFYING  FOR  THE  EXCEPTION  SERVES  A
 COMPELLING  STATE  INTEREST,  ALTERNATIVES TO GAS SERVICE ARE EITHER NOT
 TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE OR PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE, AND  THAT  THE  PROJECT
 WILL  BE  COMPLETED AND PUT INTO SERVICE NOT LATER THAN DECEMBER THIRTY-
 FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SEVEN. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION,  GAS
 DISTRIBUTION  INFRASTRUCTURE SHALL INCLUDE ALL REAL ESTATE, FIXTURES AND
 PERSONAL PROPERTY OPERATED,  OWNED,  USED  OR  TO  BE  USED  FOR  OR  IN
 CONNECTION WITH OR TO FACILITATE THE MANUFACTURE, CONVEYING, TRANSPORTA-
 TION,  DISTRIBUTION,  SALE OR FURNISHING OF GAS (NATURAL OR MANUFACTURED
 OR A MIXTURE OF BOTH) FOR LIGHT, HEAT OR POWER,  BUT  DOES  NOT  INCLUDE
 PROPERTY  USED SOLELY FOR OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE BUSINESS OF SELLING,
 DISTRIBUTING OR FURNISHING OF GAS IN ENCLOSED CONTAINERS.
  § 13. Section 66-g of the public service law is REPEALED.
  § 14. The public service law is amended by adding a new  section  77-a
 to read as follows:
  §  77-A. ALIGNING UTILITY REGULATION WITH CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION
 REDUCTION MANDATES. 1.  WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF
 THIS  SECTION,  THE  COMMISSION SHALL INITIATE A PROCEEDING, OR MULTIPLE
 PROCEEDINGS, AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE, TO CONSIDER AND ACT ON THE MATTERS
 IDENTIFIED IN THIS SECTION IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN  ITS  REGULATION  OF
 UTILITY  SERVICES  WITH  THE TIMELY ACHIEVEMENT, OF CONSISTENCY WITH THE
 CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER  ONE  HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND
 FUNCTION  AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. IF THE COMMISSION IS  ALREADY
 ENGAGED IN A PROCEEDING ADDRESSING ONE OR MORE OF THE  MATTERS  IDENTI-
 FIED  IN THIS SECTION, IT SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO OPEN A NEW PROCEEDING
 ON THAT MATTER.  FOLLOWING  COMPLETION  OF  ALL  PROCEEDINGS  INITIATED
 PURSUANT  TO  THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSION SHALL INITIATE REGULAR SUBSE-
 QUENT  PROCEEDINGS,  AS  IT  DEEMS  NECESSARY, TO ENSURE  THE  ACHIEVE-
 MENT  OF  THE  GOALS  OUTLINED  IN THIS SECTION.  THE PROCEEDING OR
 PROCEEDINGS SHALL INCLUDE:
  (A) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, A REVIEW OF
 THE PUBLIC SERVICE LAW AND ITS CURRENT  RULES  AND  POLICY  GUIDANCE  TO
 IDENTIFY  ANY  LAW,  RULE, GUIDANCE, OR LACK THEREOF, THAT  MAY  INHIBIT
 TIMELY,  EQUITABLE  ACHIEVEMENT  OF  CONSISTENCY WITH THE  CLIMATE
 JUSTICE  AND  EMISSION  REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF
 THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND  FUNC-
 TION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.  THE COMMISSION SHALL REPORT TO THE
 LEGISLATURE  ITS  PROGRESS  AND FINDINGS, IDENTIFY SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS IT
 WILL  TAKE,  AND  MAKE  RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR ANY STATUTORY AMENDMENTS OR
 OTHER ACTIONS THAT MAY  BE NEEDED TO FACILITATE THE  TIMELY  ACHIEVEMENT
 OF SUCH  MANDATES.
  (B)  WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, A REVISION
 OF THE COMMISSION'S RULES AND REGULATIONS  FOR  DETERMINING  APPROPRIATE
 ALLOWANCES  FOR  THE  EXTENSION  OF GAS AND ELECTRIC UTILITY SERVICES TO
 A. 4592--A  12
 
 ENSURE THAT UTILITY SERVICE IS PROVIDED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH  THE
 ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN
 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN,  AND  SUCH
 SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. IN ESTAB-
 LISHING  RULES GOVERNING THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE EXTENSION OF GAS SERVICE,
 THE COMMISSION SHALL ELIMINATE  ALL  MAIN  AND  SERVICE  LINE  EXTENSION
 ALLOWANCES  FOR  GAS  SERVICE  AND  MAY INCREASE ALLOWANCES FOR ELECTRIC
 SERVICE. THE COMMISSION MAY ESTABLISH RULES THAT  PROVIDE  FOR  DISTINCT
 ELECTRIC ALLOWANCES FOR ALL-ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS AND FOR DUAL-FUEL CUSTOM-
 ERS AND MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC ALLOWANCES TO BUILDINGS THAT ARE
 MADE  READY  FOR  BENEFICIAL  ELECTRIC LOADS SUCH AS THOSE WITH ELECTRIC
 VEHICLE CHARGING FACILITIES AND GRID INTERACTIVE BUILDINGS. THE  COMMIS-
 SION MAY ALSO ESTABLISH ALLOWANCES FOR BUILDINGS SEEKING INTERCONNECTION
 WITH THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS.
  (C)  IN  ORDER  TO  MINIMIZE  LONG-TERM COSTS AND STRANDED ASSETS, AND
 MAXIMIZE SAVINGS AND BENEFITS FOR CUSTOMERS,  WITHIN  ONE  YEAR  OF  THE
 EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THIS  SECTION  THE  COMMISSION SHALL ISSUE AN ORDER
 REQUIRING EACH GAS CORPORATION, WITHIN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY  DAYS  OF  THE
 ISSUANCE  OF THE ORDER, TO RESTRUCTURE ITS PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE LEAK-
 PRONE GAS MAINS AND SERVICE LINES ON ITS SYSTEM TO FACILITATE THE ORDER-
 LY RIGHT-SIZING OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM  TO  ACHIEVE  CONSISTENCY
 WITH  THE CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE
 HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN
 LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, WHILE MAINTAINING SAFE-
 TY AND RELIABILITY OF THE GAS SYSTEM, SUBJECT TO  ALL  RELEVANT  FEDERAL
 LAWS  AND  REGULATIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMMISSION SHALL REQUIRE
 EACH GAS CORPORATION, IN COORDINATION WITH ANY AND ALL  ELECTRIC  CORPO-
 RATIONS  WITH  OVERLAPPING  SERVICE  AREAS,  TO  PURSUE A GEOGRAPHICALLY
 TARGETED APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING ALTERNATIVE  SOLUTIONS  THAT  MINIMIZE
 THE  REPLACEMENT OF LEAK-PRONE GAS MAINS AND SERVICE LINES WHILE ENCOUR-
 AGING  NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE  FULL  BUILDING  ELECTRIFICATION,  INCLUDING
 THROUGH  THE  INSTALLATION  OF THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS, RESULTING IN THE
 DECOMMISSIONING OF THE MAXIMUM FEASIBLE SEGMENT OF GAS MAIN  OR  SERVICE
 LINE.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL REQUIRE EACH GAS CORPORATION, AFTER NOTICE
 AND COMMENT, TO  ESTABLISH  CRITERIA  FOR  EVALUATING  WHETHER  SPECIFIC
 SEGMENTS OF LEAK-PRONE MAINS AND SERVICE LINES ARE CANDIDATES FOR SUCH A
 GEOGRAPHICALLY  TARGETED APPROACH AND TO EVALUATE THEIR ENTIRE INVENTORY
 OF LEAK-PRONE PIPES TO CREATE A  STRATEGIC  DECOMMISSIONING  RANKING  IN
 WHICH  IT  RANKS  THE  SEGMENTS IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO ELECTRIFY ALL
 CUSTOMERS SERVED BY THE SEGMENT AND RETIRE THE GAS DISTRIBUTION  INFRAS-
 TRUCTURE.  THE COMMISSION SHALL REQUIRE EACH GAS CORPORATION TO FILE AN
 ANNUAL REPORT THAT PROVIDES A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF
 THE REDUCTION OF LEAK-PRONE PIPE INVENTORY AND THAT UPDATES THE  STRATE-
 GIC  DECOMMISSIONING  RANKING  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE COMMISSION SHALL
 ESTABLISH NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND CONSUMER AND AFFORDABILITY PROTECTIONS
 IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION THIRTY OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE  LAW  APPLICABLE
 TO  CUSTOMERS SERVED BY SEGMENTS OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TARGETED
 FOR DECOMMISSIONING.
  (D) IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE COST SAVINGS AND BENEFITS OF THE  TRANSI-
 TION  OF  THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM FOR THE EQUITABLE, ORDERLY, AND AFFORDABLE
 ACHIEVEMENT  OF  CONSISTENCY  WITH  THE  CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND  EMISSION
 REDUCTION  MANDATES  IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOU-
 SAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM
 TIME TO TIME, WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION  THE
 COMMISSION  SHALL  ISSUE AN ORDER REQUIRING ALL ELECTRIC CORPORATIONS TO
 PURSUE ALL AVAILABLE ELECTRIC ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND  DEMAND  FLEXIBILITY
 A. 4592--A  13
 
 MEASURES  THAT  ARE  COST-EFFECTIVE,  RELIABLE,  AND  FEASIBLE.  NO LESS
 FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY THREE YEARS, THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  IDENTIFY  THE
 STATEWIDE  ACHIEVABLE  POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND FLEXI-
 BILITY  MEASURES FOR THE SUBSEQUENT TEN-YEAR PERIOD AND ESTABLISH ANNUAL
 ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND  DEMAND  FLEXIBILITY  TARGETS  FOR  EACH  ELECTRIC
 CORPORATION  THAT ARE NO LOWER THAN ITS PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE STATE-
 WIDE ACHIEVABLE POTENTIAL.
  (E) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION SHALL COMPLETE A PROCEEDING TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE A REPORT  EVALUAT-
 ING  AND  CONSIDERING RATE MAKING STRATEGIES TO ENCOURAGE AND FACILITATE
 ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION  REDUCTION  MANDATES  IN
 CHAPTER  ONE  HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH
 SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM  TIME  TO  TIME.  THE
 REPORT SHALL EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR DEVELOPING AND ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF
 RATES  FOR  ELECTRIC,  GAS,  STEAM, AND THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS ON TOTAL
 CUSTOMER ENERGY COSTS, AND SHALL EXPLORE OPTIONS  FOR  INTEGRATING  COST
 SHARING  AND  RECOVERY  ACROSS  UTILITIES AND SERVICES. THE REPORT SHALL
 ALSO IDENTIFY STATUTORY BARRIERS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF  SUCH  STRATE-
 GIES.  IN  CONSIDERING SUCH RATE MAKING STRATEGIES, THE COMMISSION SHALL
 HAVE A GOAL OF ENSURING  THAT  ALL  LOW-TO-MODERATE  INCOME  RESIDENTIAL
 CUSTOMERS PAY NO MORE THAN SIX PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME FOR ELECTRICITY.
  (F) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION  SHALL  DETERMINE,  BASED  ON  THE  BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE
 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS NECESSARY TO BRING THE STATEWIDE  GAS
 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTO ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATEWIDE TWO THOUSAND THIR-
 TY  AND  TWO THOUSAND FIFTY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS IN
 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN,  AND  SUCH
 SUCCESSORS  IN  LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND SET
 INTERIM  EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS FOR EACH  GAS  UTILITY  AS  WELL  AS
 DEVELOPING A PERIODIC PROCESS TO REVIEW AND UPDATE SUCH TARGETS;
  (G) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION  SHALL REVISE ITS RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR CONDUCTING BENEFIT-COST
 ANALYSES SO THAT THE METHODOLOGY AND THE BASE  FINANCIAL  AND  FRAMEWORK
 ASSUMPTIONS  FOR THE ANALYSIS SUPPORT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CLIMATE JUSTICE
 AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF  THE  LAWS
 OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY
 ARISE  FROM  TIME  TO  TIME.  SUCH REVISIONS SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE
 LIMITED TO:
  (1) GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES  SHALL  BE  USED  AS  A
 CONSTRAINT  IN  DESIGNING THE SCENARIOS TO BE ANALYZED SUCH THAT ALL THE
 SCENARIOS SHALL  COMPLY  WITH  THE  STATUTORY  GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSION
 REQUIREMENTS  AND  ANY INTERIM TARGETS SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRON-
 MENTAL CONSERVATION OR THE COMMISSION  IN ORDER TO INTERNALIZE THE  COST
 OF ACHIEVING SUCH TARGETS IN THE BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS.
  (2) QUANTIFICATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN AMBI-
 ENT  AND INDOOR AIR QUALITY. WHEN QUANTITATIVE METRICS ARE NOT POSSIBLE,
 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS SHALL BE INCLUDED.
  (3) CONSIDERATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AND  RISKS  ASSOCI-
 ATED  WITH  DIFFERENT  SCENARIOS,  INCLUDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
 LEAKED GAS, THE PROLONGED RELIANCE ON THE GAS SYSTEM THAT  RESULTS  FROM
 LONG-LIVED  INVESTMENTS  IN  GAS INFRASTRUCTURE AND GAS-CONSUMING EQUIP-
 MENT, THE POSITIVE OPTION VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH MEASURES THAT CAN ELIMI-
 NATE OR DEFER THE NEED FOR INVESTMENTS IN GAS  INFRASTRUCTURE  AND  GAS-
 CONSUMING  EQUIPMENT,  AND  POTENTIAL  CHALLENGES  ASSOCIATED  WITH FULL
 ELECTRIFICATION.
 A. 4592--A  14
 
  (4) IN INSTANCES WHERE AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL HAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRI-
 BUTE, ONLY ATTRIBUTE ALTERNATIVE FUELS WITH EMISSION REDUCTION  BENEFITS
 UNDER  THE  BENEFIT-COST  ANALYSIS  IF  THE ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES ARE
 RETAINED BY THE UTILITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UTILITY'S CUSTOMERS OR BY
 THE END-USE CUSTOMER.
  (5)  USE ACCURATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES THAT ASSUME THE FULL VALUE OF
 ANY NEW GAS ASSET IS FULLY DEPRECIATED NO LATER THAN TWO THOUSAND FIFTY,
 ABSENT DEMONSTRATION THAT THE SPECIFIC  ASSET  WILL  REMAIN  IN  SERVICE
 BEYOND  TWO  THOUSAND FIFTY, AND EARLIER IF IT IS LIKELY THAT SUCH ASSET
 WILL NEED TO BE PHASED OUT OR RETIRED BEFORE TWO  THOUSAND  FIFTY  GIVEN
 ANY  INTERIM GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS OR GEOGRAPHICALLY
 TARGETED STRATEGIC ASSET RETIREMENT.
  (6) ASSESS DEMOGRAPHIC IMPACTS BY MEASURING WITH  AS  MUCH  GEOGRAPHIC
 GRANULARITY AS POSSIBLE AND CONSIDERING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPOSURE AND
 RISK  FACTORS  FOR  IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER POPU-
 LATIONS WITH VULNERABILITY TO CHANGES INDUCED BY REGULATION.
  2. NOTHING IN THIS CHAPTER OR ANY OTHER LAW OF NEW YORK STATE SHALL BE
 INTERPRETED OR OTHERWISE CONSTRUED AS  PREEMPTING  A  MUNICIPALITY  FROM
 ADOPTING BUILDING CODES OR OTHER REGULATIONS REGARDING ON-SITE EMISSIONS
 FOR NEW AND EXISTING BUILDINGS WITHIN THEIR LOCALITIES.
  § 15. This act shall take effect immediately.
