 AN  ACT to amend the public service law, the public authorities law, the
  transportation corporations law and the  labor  law,  in  relation  to
  aligning  utility  regulation  with state climate justice and emission
  reduction targets; to repeal section 66-b of the  public  service  law
  relating to continuation of gas service; and to repeal section 66-g of
  the public service law relating to the sale  of indigenous natural gas

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "NY Home Energy Affordable Transition Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares that:
  1.  The  Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (the "CLCPA")
 created legal mandates for dramatic greenhouse gas  emission  reductions
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 4592--B  2
 
 from all sectors of New York's economy. The CLCPA also emphasizes equity
 in addressing climate change by requiring all state agencies and author-
 ities to prioritize reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollu-
 tants  in  disadvantaged communities and by mandating that certain state
 investments deliver benefits to these communities.
  2. Buildings are New York's largest source  of  greenhouse  gas  emis-
 sions,  accounting  for  approximately  one-third  of the greenhouse gas
 emissions in our state. New York state's  buildings  also  produce  more
 local  air  pollution  than any other state in the country, resulting in
 negative health outcomes such as increased rates of asthma, particularly
 among children, and heart disease. Therefore,  reducing  greenhouse  gas
 emissions  and  toxic  air  pollution emitted from New York's buildings,
 especially in disadvantaged communities, is necessary to meet the  CLCPA
 mandates.
  3. To meet the state's bold climate and equity mandates, New York will
 need  to  update  how  it  regulates  gas utility service. Doing so will
 enable strategic planning and investments in neighborhood-scale building
 decarbonization and help bring the  statewide  gas  distribution  system
 into  alignment  with  the  two  thousand  thirty and two thousand fifty
 greenhouse gas emission reduction  mandates  in  the  CLCPA  through  an
 orderly  and equitable process, coordinated with appropriate investments
 in the electric system to ensure all New Yorkers have  non-discriminato-
 ry,  affordable  access  to  the energy needed for heating, cooling, and
 powering the buildings in which they live and work.
  4. The New York public service  law  not  only  contains  barriers  to
 neighborhood-scale  building  decarbonization  solutions such as thermal
 energy networks, but also works  at  cross  purposes  with  the  state's
 climate  and  affordability  goals,  by  requiring  and  subsidizing the
 continued expansion of natural gas infrastructure.
  a. The gas utility obligation to serve codified in the public  service
 law  is  a  major  obstacle  to  utilities developing neighborhood-scale
 building decarbonization projects that would facilitate bringing the gas
 system into alignment with the two  thousand  thirty  and  two  thousand
 fifty  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  mandates  in the CLCPA in a
 manner that can mitigate costs for all utility customers, reduces green-
 house gas emissions and co-pollutants impacting local air  quality,  and
 provides a transition for impacted workers.
  b.  Statutorily  mandated  utility system extension allowances require
 existing ratepayers to subsidize  gas  infrastructure  hookups  for  new
 customers.  According  to  a recent joint filing with the Public Service
 Commission by the New York state gas utilities,  these  required  allow-
 ances  cost  gas  utilities  hundreds  of  millions of dollars per year.
 These costs are passed directly to existing gas customers.
  c. Gas utilities in New York are on track to collectively  spend  $150
 billion  to  replace thousands of miles of leak prone pipe in the coming
 years. These investments pose a risk of becoming stranded  assets,  with
 $77  billion of the total cost coming due after 2050, but can be avoided
 in many cases by strategically investing in neighborhood-scale decarbon-
 ization projects.
  5. New Yorkers are suffering from dramatic fossil  fuel  price  spikes
 driven  by  the increasingly integrated global commodity market, subject
 to the whims of foreign dictators such as  Russia's  Vladimir  Putin  or
 Saudi  Arabia's  Prince  Mohammed  bin  Salman.  Fossil fuel prices have
 spiked to historic high levels, making both electricity and gas  utility
 service  unaffordable  for  many  New  Yorkers.  Decarbonizing buildings
 through the strategic development of neighborhood-scale building  decar-
 A. 4592--B  3
 
 bonization  projects,  along  with  investing  in  energy efficiency and
 renewable electricity, will save  New  Yorkers  money  now  and  in  the
 future,  protect against price volatility, and promote true energy inde-
 pendence for New York state.
  6. Fossil fuel price spikes are exacerbating the affordability impacts
 of  the  COVID-19  Pandemic.  Over  a million households in New York now
 struggle to pay their utility bills. The Public Service  Commission  has
 declared,  but  not  yet  achieved, a goal that customers should not pay
 more than 6% of their income for utility energy services, a number based
 on a nationally accepted standard.
  7. Thus, it is the intent of the legislature  to  enact  the  NY  Home
 Energy Affordable Transition Act for the following purposes:
  a.  to  ensure  that  the  public service law regarding regulation and
 oversight of gas utilities will provide for  the  timely  and  strategic
 decarbonization  and  right-sizing  of  the gas distribution system in a
 just and affordable manner as required to meet the climate  justice  and
 emission  reduction mandates of the CLCPA, appropriately balancing rate-
 payers' needs and interests with the maintenance  of  financially  sound
 utilities,  prioritizing  low-to-moderate income customers and disadvan-
 taged communities, and encouraging neighborhood-scale transitions;
  b. to provide the Public Service Commission with the statutory author-
 ity and direction to align utility regulations  and  planning  with  the
 CLCPA climate justice and emission reduction mandates and to require the
 Public  Service  Commission to take a proactive role in the timely iden-
 tification and amendment of such regulations or rulings as may  pose  an
 impediment  to  achieving  CLCPA mandates, and to identify any laws that
 may pose an impediment;
  c. to maintain the affordability of services for all  utility  custom-
 ers, create good paying, family sustaining jobs, and facilitate achieve-
 ment  of  the  CLCPA  climate justice and emission reduction mandates by
 enabling gas utilities to minimize the need for new investments  in  gas
 infrastructure;
  d.  to  facilitate  a well-planned and strategic downsizing of the gas
 system by redirecting ratepayer funds that  would  have  been  spent  on
 costly  new  investments to maintain or expand the gas system to instead
 fund  job-creating  neighborhood-scale  decarbonization  projects  that
 provide  alternative clean energy solutions for efficient heating, cool-
 ing, cooking, hot water, and  other  uses  that  effectively  transition
 customers  away  from  dependence on fuels with greenhouse gas emissions
 and equipment that produces on-site co-pollutant emissions;
  e. to end statutorily mandated,  ratepayer-subsidized  incentives  for
 the  expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure while maintaining the equi-
 table provision of electric  service  for  efficient  heating,  cooling,
 cooking, hot water, and other uses;
  f. to provide affordable access to electricity for heating and cooling
 and  to  protect  low-income  and  moderate-income  customers from undue
 burdens as they decarbonize their buildings; and
  g. to clarify that municipal building codes regulating  on-site  emis-
 sions are not preempted under New York state law.
  8.  Transitioning  gas  customers  to  alternative heating and cooling
 services is likely to be most cost-effective  from  the  perspective  of
 individual customers and New York state as a whole if undertaken as part
 of  a  neighborhood-scale  project.  Such  projects  would help minimize
 stranded costs in gas  system  infrastructure  and  support  coordinated
 investments on the part of customers, utilities, and others, potentially
 A. 4592--B  4
 
 including but not limited to electrification make-ready measures, equip-
 ment located on the premises of customers, and thermal energy networks.
  9.  This legislation does not establish a ban on the use of gas. It is
 neither the intent nor would it be the effect  of  this  legislation  to
 require  the  immediate transition of existing gas customers to alterna-
 tive heating and cooling services.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 4 of the public service law, as  amended
 by chapter 594 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  1. There shall be in the department of public service a public service
 commission, which shall possess the powers and duties hereinafter speci-
 fied,  and also all powers necessary or proper to enable it to carry out

 JUSTICE  AND  EMISSION  REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF
 THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND  FUNC-
 TION  AS  MAY  ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.  The commission shall consist of
 five members, to be appointed by the governor, by and  with  the  advice
 and consent of the senate. A commissioner shall be designated as [chair-
 man]  CHAIRPERSON  of  the  commission  by the governor to serve in such
 capacity at the pleasure of the governor or until his  OR  HER  term  as

 pality  for  the  purpose  of supplying, selling or distributing natural
 gas, to augment its supply of natural gas, whenever the commission deems
 necessary and whenever artificial gas can  be  reasonably  obtained,  by
 acquiring  by  purchase, manufacture or otherwise a supply thereof to be
 mixed with such natural gas, in order to render adequate service to  the
 customers  of such corporation or to maintain a proper and uniform pres-
 sure; and have power after an investigation and a hearing to  order  any
 corporation  having  authority under any general or special law or under
 any charter or franchise, to lay down, erect or maintain  wires,  pipes,
 conduits,  ducts  or other fixtures in, over or under the streets, high-
 ways and public places of any municipality for the purpose of supplying,
 selling or distributing artificial gas, to augment its supply of artifi-
 cial gas, whenever the commission deems necessary and  whenever  natural
 gas  can be reasonably obtained, by acquiring by purchase or otherwise a
 supply thereof to be mixed with such artificial gas, in order to  render
 adequate  service  to the customers of such corporation or to maintain a
 proper and uniform pressure; and to fix such rate for the  supplying  of
 mixed  gas  as  shall  secure to such corporation a fair return; and may
 order the curtailment or discontinuance of the use of  natural  gas  for
 manufacturing  or  industrial  purposes,  for periods aggregating not to
 exceed four months in any calendar year, if it  is  established  to  the
 satisfaction  of  the  commission  that the supply of natural gas is not
 adequate to meet the reasonable demands of domestic consumption and  may
 [prohibit  the  use  of  natural  gas in wasteful devices and practices]
 ORDER THE CURTAILMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF THE USE OF  THE  DISTRIBUTION
 SYSTEM,  WHERE  THE  COMMISSION  HAS DETERMINED THAT SUCH CURTAILMENT OR
 DISCONTINUANCE IS REASONABLY REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATE ENERGY  POLICY,
 PROVIDED  THAT  SUCH  CURTAILMENT  OR DISCONTINUANCE SHALL BE CONSISTENT
 WITH PROGRAMS APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO  OF
 SECTION  THIRTY OF THIS CHAPTER, AND MAY PROHIBIT THE USE OF NATURAL GAS
 IN WASTEFUL DEVICES AND PRACTICES, AS DEFINED  BY  THE  COMMISSION,  AND
 REQUIRE CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY IN GAS USAGE.
  12-E.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  REVIEW THE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PLAN OF
 EACH GAS CORPORATION AND ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO EXAMINE FEASIBLE  ALTER-
 NATIVES  TO  SUCH  CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE CONSISTENCY WITH THE
 CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER  ONE  HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND
 FUNCTION  AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, ENCOURAGING NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE
 TRANSITIONS AND THE ELIMINATION OF ON-SITE CO-POLLUTANT EMISSIONS.  SUCH
 PROCESS SHALL INCLUDE THRESHOLDS AND CRITERIA FOR THE TYPES OF  PROJECTS
 SUBJECT  TO SUCH EXAMINATION. THE COMMISSION SHALL REQUIRE PARTICIPATION
 IN SUCH PROCESS BY EACH ELECTRIC CORPORATION WITH A SERVICE  AREA  OVER-
 LAPPING  THE  SERVICE  AREA  OF  THE GAS CORPORATION; AND THE COMMISSION
 SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO REQUIRE ANY SUCH ELECTRIC CORPORATION TO PARTIC-
 IPATE IN ALTERNATIVES TO GAS  CAPITAL  CONSTRUCTION,  INCLUDING  PARTIC-
 IPATION  IN  FINANCING.  ANY COSTS INCURRED BY SUCH ELECTRIC CORPORATION
 A. 4592--B  10
 
 FOR SUCH CORPORATION'S PARTICIPATION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AN  OPPORTUNITY
 FOR FULL RECOVERY, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSION.
  § 10. Section 66-a of the public service law, as added by chapter 7 of
 the laws of 1948, subdivision 1 as amended and subdivision 3 as added by
 chapter 582 of the laws of 1975, and subdivision 2 as amended by chapter
 722 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
  § 66-a. Conservation  of  gas,  declaration  of  policy, delegation of
 power.  1. It is hereby declared to be the policy  of  this  state  that
 when  there  develops  in  any area a situation under which a gas corpo-
 ration supplying gas to such area is unable to meet the reasonable needs
 of its consumers and of persons or  corporations  applying  for  new  or
 additional  gas  service, the available supply of gas shall be allocated
 among the customers of such gas corporation, in such manner  as  may  be
 necessary  to  protect public health and safety and to avoid undue hard-
 ship, PARTICULARLY FOR  LOW-TO-MODERATE  INCOME  RESIDENTIAL  CUSTOMERS,
 ELECTRIC  GENERATION NEEDED FOR ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY, AND CUSTOM-
 ERS WITH HARD-TO-ELECTRIFY INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USES,  pursuant  to
 rules  and  regulations as may be adopted by the commission, and that to
 carry out this declared policy the jurisdiction of  the  public  service
 commission should be clarified.  IT IS FURTHER DECLARED TO BE THE POLICY
 OF THIS STATE THAT GAS SERVICE TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS MUST BE PROVIDED IN
 A MANNER THAT IS SAFE AND ADEQUATE, NOT UNJUSTLY DISCRIMINATORY OR UNDU-
 LY PREFERENTIAL, AND IN ALL RESPECTS JUST AND REASONABLE, SUBJECT TO THE
 PROVISIONS OF SECTION THIRTY OF THIS CHAPTER.
  2. Notwithstanding the provisions of any statute or any franchise held
 by  a gas corporation, the commission shall have power, upon the finding
 that CONTINUED GAS SERVICE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE
 CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER  ONE  HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND
 FUNCTION  AS  MAY  ARISE  FROM TIME TO TIME, OR THAT there exists such a
 shortage of gas in any area in  the  state,  that  the  gas  corporation
 supplying  such  area  is unable and will be unable to secure or produce
 sufficient gas to meet the reasonable needs  of  its  customers  and  of
 persons  or  corporations applying for new or additional gas service, to
 require such corporation to immediately discontinue the supplying of gas
 to additional customers or of supplying additional  service  to  present
 customers,  for  such  purpose  or  purposes as may be designated by the
 commission, or to customers using gas for a purpose  prohibited  by  the
 commission  pursuant  to  this  act,  and that upon the finding that the
 supply of gas available is  and  will  be  insufficient  to  supply  the
 demands  of  all consumers receiving service, to require such gas corpo-
 ration to curtail or discontinue  service  to  any  or  all  classes  of
 customers  of  such  gas  corporation.  In  imposing such a direction or
 requirement, the commission shall give consideration first  to  existing
 domestic  uses  and  uses  deemed  to  be necessary by the commission to
 protect public health and safety and to avoid undue hardship [and  shall
 be  limited  to the period of the emergency provided that the gas corpo-
 ration affected shall make such restriction,  curtailing  or  discontin-
 uance  applicable  to  all customers or applicants for service in a like
 class. If the commission determines that good cause exists for supplying
 service to additional customers or for supplying additional  service  to
 some  existing  customers, notwithstanding the curtailment or discontin-
 uance of service to other existing customers, it shall,  to  the  extent
 feasible, allocate gas with equal priority to new or additional domestic
 uses  of  gas  and  commercial or industrial processes which require gas
 because there is no practical substitute for it in  such  proportion  as
 A. 4592--B  11

 the  commission  determines to be reasonable.  Provided that the commis-
 sion shall be permitted, after public hearing, to authorize any  natural
 gas  produced  from  lands  under the waters of Lake Erie to be used for
 process  or  feedstock  requirements].  The  commission is authorized to
 adopt such rules, regulations and orders as are necessary or appropriate
 to carry out these delegated powers.
  3. In carrying out the delegated powers provided for in this  section,
 the commission shall, to the extent practicable, determine and establish
 gas conservation measures or standards, INCLUDING ENERGY EFFICIENT ELEC-
 TRIFICATION  OF GAS END USES. The commission may require compliance with
 such measures or standards as a condition of receiving service.
  4. THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NEW OR  ADDI-
 TIONAL  GAS  SERVICE  IS  WARRANTED NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEED TO CONSERVE
 RESOURCES FOR SERVICE TO EXISTING GAS  CUSTOMERS.  SUCH  DETERMINATION
 SHALL  BE  CONSISTENT  WITH  THE  ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CLIMATE JUSTICE AND
 EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF  THE  LAWS  OF
 TWO  THOUSAND  NINETEEN,  AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY
 ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND MAY TAKE  INTO  ACCOUNT  FACTORS  INCLUDING
 ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT,  IMPACTS  ON NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS INCLUDING
 LOW-TO-MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS, IMPACTS ON SYSTEM SAFETY AND ADEQUACY,
 EQUITY TOWARD EXISTING CUSTOMERS WITH LIMITED  CONVERSION  ALTERNATIVES,
 AND THE FEASIBILITY OF NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE ALTERNATIVES TO USAGE OF FUELS
 WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ON-SITE CO-POLLUTANTS, INCLUDING THER-
 MAL ENERGY NETWORKS.
  5.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  REQUIRE  GAS  AND/OR ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO
 PROVIDE COORDINATION ASSISTANCE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, IN SUCH  FORMS
 AS  THE  COMMISSION  DEEMS REASONABLY REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATE ENERGY
 POLICY, TO IDENTIFY AND ADOPT ALTERNATIVES WHERE APPLICATIONS FOR NEW OR
 ADDITIONAL GAS SERVICE ARE DENIED AND ENCOURAGE NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE TRAN-
 SITIONS.
  § 11. Section 66-b of the public service law is REPEALED.
  § 12. The public service law is amended by adding a new  section  66-w
 to read as follows:
  §  66-W.  EXPANSION  OF  GAS  COMPANY SERVICE TERRITORIES. EXCEPT AS
 PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION, AND NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER  PROVISION  OF
 THIS CHAPTER, AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, THE
 COMMISSION  SHALL  NOT GRANT AN AMENDMENT OF A GAS COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE
 OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY THAT EXPANDS A GAS COMPANY'S SERVICE
 TERRITORY IN ORDER TO EXTEND GAS  PLANT  AND  THE  AVAILABILITY  OF  GAS
 SERVICE  INTO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE GAS SERVICE WAS NOT AVAILABLE PRIOR
 TO SUCH DATE. THE COMMISSION MAY AUTHORIZE EXCEPTIONS TO THE POLICY  SET
 FORTH IN THIS SECTION ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, PROVIDED THAT THE COMMIS-
 SION  FINDS  THAT THE AMENDMENT OF THE CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE
 AND NECESSITY IS LIMITED TO A PROJECT THAT  SERVES  A  COMPELLING  STATE
 INTEREST,  ALTERNATIVES TO GAS SERVICE ARE EITHER NOT TECHNICALLY FEASI-
 BLE OR PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE, AND THAT THE PROJECT WILL  BE  COMPLETED
 AND  PUT INTO SERVICE NOT LATER THAN DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND
 TWENTY-SEVEN.
  § 13. Section 66-g of the public service law is REPEALED.
  § 14. The public service law is amended by adding a new  section  77-a
 to read as follows:
  §  77-A. ALIGNING UTILITY REGULATION WITH CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION
 REDUCTION MANDATES. 1.  WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF
 THIS  SECTION,  THE  COMMISSION SHALL INITIATE A PROCEEDING, OR MULTIPLE
 PROCEEDINGS, AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE, TO CONSIDER AND ACT ON THE MATTERS
 IDENTIFIED IN THIS SECTION IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN  ITS  REGULATION  OF
 A. 4592--B  12
 
 UTILITY  SERVICES  WITH  THE TIMELY ACHIEVEMENT, OF CONSISTENCY WITH THE
 CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER  ONE  HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND
 FUNCTION  AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. IF THE COMMISSION IS  ALREADY
 ENGAGED IN A PROCEEDING ADDRESSING ONE OR MORE OF THE  MATTERS  IDENTI-
 FIED  IN THIS SECTION, IT SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO OPEN A NEW PROCEEDING
 ON THAT MATTER.  FOLLOWING  COMPLETION  OF  ALL  PROCEEDINGS  INITIATED
 PURSUANT  TO  THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSION SHALL INITIATE REGULAR SUBSE-
 QUENT  PROCEEDINGS,  AS  IT  DEEMS  NECESSARY, TO ENSURE  THE  ACHIEVE-
 MENT  OF  THE  GOALS  OUTLINED  IN THIS SECTION.  THE PROCEEDING OR
 PROCEEDINGS SHALL INCLUDE:
  (A) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, A REVIEW OF
 THE PUBLIC SERVICE LAW AND ITS CURRENT  RULES  AND  POLICY  GUIDANCE  TO
 IDENTIFY  ANY  LAW,  RULE, GUIDANCE, OR LACK THEREOF, THAT  MAY  INHIBIT
 TIMELY,  EQUITABLE  ACHIEVEMENT  OF  CONSISTENCY WITH THE  CLIMATE
 JUSTICE  AND  EMISSION  REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF
 THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND  FUNC-
 TION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.  THE COMMISSION SHALL REPORT TO THE
 LEGISLATURE  ITS  PROGRESS  AND FINDINGS, IDENTIFY SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS IT
 WILL  TAKE,  AND  MAKE  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANY STATUTORY AMENDMENTS, OR
 BUDGETARY OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT MAY  BE NEEDED TO FACILITATE THE  TIMELY
 ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCH  MANDATES.
  (B)  WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, A REVISION
 OF THE COMMISSION'S RULES AND REGULATIONS  FOR  DETERMINING  APPROPRIATE
 ALLOWANCES  FOR  THE  EXTENSION  OF GAS AND ELECTRIC UTILITY SERVICES TO
 ENSURE THAT UTILITY SERVICE IS PROVIDED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH  THE
 ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN
 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN,  AND  SUCH
 SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. IN ESTAB-
 LISHING  RULES GOVERNING THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE EXTENSION OF GAS SERVICE,
 THE COMMISSION SHALL ELIMINATE  ALL  MAIN  AND  SERVICE  LINE  EXTENSION
 ALLOWANCES  FOR  GAS  SERVICE  AND  MAY INCREASE ALLOWANCES FOR ELECTRIC
 SERVICE. THE COMMISSION MAY ESTABLISH RULES THAT  PROVIDE  FOR  DISTINCT
 ELECTRIC ALLOWANCES FOR ALL-ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS AND FOR DUAL-FUEL CUSTOM-
 ERS AND MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC ALLOWANCES TO BUILDINGS THAT ARE
 MADE  READY  FOR  BENEFICIAL  ELECTRIC LOADS SUCH AS THOSE WITH ELECTRIC
 VEHICLE CHARGING FACILITIES AND GRID INTERACTIVE BUILDINGS. THE  COMMIS-
 SION MAY ALSO ESTABLISH ALLOWANCES FOR BUILDINGS SEEKING INTERCONNECTION
 WITH THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS.
  (C)  IN  ORDER  TO  MINIMIZE  LONG-TERM COSTS AND STRANDED ASSETS, AND
 MAXIMIZE SAVINGS AND BENEFITS FOR CUSTOMERS,  WITHIN  ONE  YEAR  OF  THE
 EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THIS  SECTION  THE  COMMISSION SHALL ISSUE AN ORDER
 REQUIRING EACH GAS CORPORATION, WITHIN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY  DAYS  OF  THE
 ISSUANCE OF SUCH ORDER, TO RESTRUCTURE ITS PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE LEAK-
 PRONE GAS MAINS AND SERVICE LINES ON ITS SYSTEM TO FACILITATE THE ORDER-
 LY  RIGHT-SIZING  OF  THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE CONSISTENCY
 WITH THE CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER  ONE
 HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN
 LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, WHILE MAINTAINING SAFE-
 TY  AND  RELIABILITY  OF THE GAS SYSTEM, SUBJECT TO ALL RELEVANT FEDERAL
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMMISSION  SHALL  REQUIRE
 EACH  GAS  CORPORATION, IN COORDINATION WITH ANY AND ALL ELECTRIC CORPO-
 RATIONS WITH OVERLAPPING SERVICE AREAS, TO PURSUE PROGRAMS  PURSUANT  TO
 SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  SECTION  THIRTY  OF THIS CHAPTER THAT MINIMIZE THE
 REPLACEMENT OF LEAK-PRONE GAS MAINS AND SERVICE LINES.  THE  COMMISSION
 SHALL  REQUIRE EACH GAS CORPORATION, AFTER NOTICE AND COMMENT, TO ESTAB-
 A. 4592--B  13
 
 LISH CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING WHETHER  SPECIFIC  SEGMENTS  OF  LEAK-PRONE
 MAINS  AND SERVICE LINES ARE CANDIDATES FOR SUCH  PROGRAMS AND TO EVALU-
 ATE THEIR ENTIRE INVENTORY OF LEAK-PRONE PIPES  TO  CREATE  A  STRATEGIC
 DECOMMISSIONING  RANKING  IN WHICH IT RANKS THE SEGMENTS IN TERMS OF THE
 ABILITY TO ELECTRIFY ALL CUSTOMERS SERVED BY THE SEGMENT AND RETIRE  THE
 GAS  DISTRIBUTION  INFRASTRUCTURE. THE COMMISSION SHALL REQUIRE EACH GAS
 CORPORATION TO FILE AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT  PROVIDES  A  QUALITATIVE  AND
 QUANTITATIVE  ASSESSMENT  OF  THE REDUCTION OF LEAK-PRONE PIPE INVENTORY
 AND THAT UPDATES THE STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING RANKING  FROM  THE  PRIOR
 YEAR.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL ESTABLISH NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND CONSUMER
 AND AFFORDABILITY PROTECTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION THIRTY OF  THIS
 CHAPTER  APPLICABLE  TO CUSTOMERS SERVED BY SEGMENTS OF THE GAS DISTRIB-
 UTION SYSTEM TARGETED FOR DECOMMISSIONING.
  (D) IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE COST SAVINGS AND BENEFITS OF THE  TRANSI-
 TION  OF  THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM FOR THE EQUITABLE, ORDERLY, AND AFFORDABLE
 ACHIEVEMENT  OF  CONSISTENCY  WITH  THE  CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND  EMISSION
 REDUCTION  MANDATES  IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOU-
 SAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM
 TIME TO TIME, WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION  THE
 COMMISSION  SHALL  ISSUE AN ORDER REQUIRING ALL ELECTRIC CORPORATIONS TO
 PURSUE ALL AVAILABLE ELECTRIC ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND  DEMAND  FLEXIBILITY
 MEASURES  THAT  ARE  COST-EFFECTIVE,  RELIABLE,  AND  FEASIBLE.  NO LESS
 FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY THREE YEARS, THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  IDENTIFY  THE
 STATEWIDE  ACHIEVABLE  POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND FLEXI-
 BILITY MEASURES FOR THE SUBSEQUENT TEN-YEAR PERIOD AND ESTABLISH  ANNUAL
 ENERGY  EFFICIENCY  AND  DEMAND  FLEXIBILITY  TARGETS  FOR EACH ELECTRIC
 CORPORATION THAT ARE NO LOWER THAN ITS PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE  STATE-
 WIDE ACHIEVABLE POTENTIAL.
  (E) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION  SHALL COMPLETE A PROCEEDING TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE A REPORT EVALUAT-
 ING AND CONSIDERING RATE MAKING STRATEGIES TO ENCOURAGE  AND  FACILITATE
 ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN
 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN,  AND  SUCH
 SUCCESSORS  IN  LAW  AND  FUNCTION  AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME.  THE
 REPORT SHALL EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR DEVELOPING AND ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF
 RATES FOR ELECTRIC, GAS, STEAM, AND THERMAL  ENERGY  NETWORKS  ON  TOTAL
 CUSTOMER  ENERGY  COSTS,  AND SHALL EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR INTEGRATING COST
 SHARING AND RECOVERY ACROSS UTILITIES AND SERVICES.  THE  REPORT  SHALL
 ALSO  IDENTIFY  STATUTORY BARRIERS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH STRATE-
 GIES.  IN CONSIDERING SUCH RATE MAKING STRATEGIES, THE COMMISSION  SHALL
 HAVE  A  GOAL  OF  ENSURING THAT ALL RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS BE ADEQUATELY
 PROTECTED FROM BEARING AN ENERGY BURDEN  GREATER  THAN  SIX  PERCENT  OF
 THEIR  HOUSEHOLD  INCOME PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION THIRTY
 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  (F) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION SHALL DETERMINE, BASED  ON  THE  BEST  AVAILABLE  INFORMATION,  THE
 GREENHOUSE  GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS NECESSARY TO BRING THE STATEWIDE GAS
 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTO ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATEWIDE TWO THOUSAND THIR-
 TY AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION  TARGETS  IN
 CHAPTER  ONE  HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH
 SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME,  AND  SET
 INTERIM  EMISSION  REDUCTION  TARGETS  FOR EACH GAS UTILITY AS WELL AS
 DEVELOPING A PERIODIC PROCESS TO REVIEW AND UPDATE SUCH TARGETS;
  (G) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION SHALL REVISE ITS RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR CONDUCTING  BENEFIT-COST
 ANALYSES  SO  THAT  THE METHODOLOGY AND THE BASE FINANCIAL AND FRAMEWORK
 A. 4592--B  14
 
 ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE ANALYSIS SUPPORT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CLIMATE  JUSTICE
 AND  EMISSION  REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS
 OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNCTION AS MAY
 ARISE  FROM  TIME  TO  TIME.  SUCH REVISIONS SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE
 LIMITED TO:
  (1) GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES  SHALL  BE  USED  AS  A
 CONSTRAINT  IN  DESIGNING THE SCENARIOS TO BE ANALYZED SUCH THAT ALL THE
 SCENARIOS SHALL  COMPLY  WITH  THE  STATUTORY  GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSION
 REQUIREMENTS  AND  ANY INTERIM TARGETS SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRON-
 MENTAL CONSERVATION OR THE COMMISSION  IN ORDER TO INTERNALIZE THE  COST
 OF ACHIEVING SUCH TARGETS IN THE BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS.
  (2) QUANTIFICATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN AMBI-
 ENT  AND INDOOR AIR QUALITY. WHEN QUANTITATIVE METRICS ARE NOT POSSIBLE,
 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS SHALL BE INCLUDED.
  (3) CONSIDERATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AND  RISKS  ASSOCI-
 ATED  WITH  DIFFERENT  SCENARIOS,  INCLUDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
 LEAKED GAS, THE PROLONGED RELIANCE ON THE GAS SYSTEM THAT  RESULTS  FROM
 LONG-LIVED  INVESTMENTS  IN  GAS INFRASTRUCTURE AND GAS-CONSUMING EQUIP-
 MENT, THE POSITIVE OPTION VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH MEASURES THAT CAN ELIMI-
 NATE OR DEFER THE NEED FOR INVESTMENTS IN GAS  INFRASTRUCTURE  AND  GAS-
 CONSUMING  EQUIPMENT,  AND  POTENTIAL  CHALLENGES  ASSOCIATED  WITH FULL
 ELECTRIFICATION.
  (4) IN INSTANCES WHERE AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL HAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRI-
 BUTE, ONLY ATTRIBUTE ALTERNATIVE FUELS WITH EMISSION REDUCTION  BENEFITS
 UNDER  THE  BENEFIT-COST  ANALYSIS  IF  THE ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES ARE
 RETAINED BY THE UTILITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UTILITY'S CUSTOMERS OR BY
 THE END-USE CUSTOMER.
  (5) USE ACCURATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES THAT ASSUME THE FULL VALUE  OF
 ANY NEW GAS ASSET IS FULLY DEPRECIATED NO LATER THAN TWO THOUSAND FIFTY,
 ABSENT  DEMONSTRATION  THAT  THE  SPECIFIC  ASSET WILL REMAIN IN SERVICE
 BEYOND TWO THOUSAND FIFTY, AND EARLIER IF IT IS LIKELY THAT  SUCH  ASSET
 WILL  NEED  TO  BE PHASED OUT OR RETIRED BEFORE TWO THOUSAND FIFTY GIVEN
 ANY INTERIM GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS OR  GEOGRAPHICALLY
 TARGETED STRATEGIC ASSET RETIREMENT.
  (6)  ASSESS  DEMOGRAPHIC  IMPACTS BY MEASURING WITH AS MUCH GEOGRAPHIC
 GRANULARITY AS POSSIBLE AND CONSIDERING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPOSURE AND
 RISK FACTORS FOR IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES  AND  OTHER  POPU-
 LATIONS WITH VULNERABILITY TO CHANGES INDUCED BY REGULATION.
  2. NOTHING IN THIS CHAPTER OR ANY OTHER LAW OF NEW YORK STATE SHALL BE
 INTERPRETED  OR  OTHERWISE  CONSTRUED  AS PREEMPTING A MUNICIPALITY FROM
 ADOPTING BUILDING CODES OR OTHER REGULATIONS REGARDING ON-SITE EMISSIONS
 FOR NEW AND EXISTING BUILDINGS WITHIN THEIR LOCALITIES.
  § 15.  The labor law is amended by adding a new section 224-g to  read
