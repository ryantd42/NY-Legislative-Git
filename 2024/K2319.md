  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
honor  those  commemorative historical events which symbolize the growth
and development of  the  educational  institutions  which  comprise  the
communities of this great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  120th Anniversary of St. Elizabeth College of Nursing;
and
 
  WHEREAS, St. Elizabeth College of Nursing (SECON) was established in
1904 as a single purpose three-year diploma program in nursing;  it  was
registered  by  the  New  York State Education Department (NYSED) as St.
Elizabeth Hospital School of Nursing and graduated its  first  class  of
seven in 1907; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  October  29, 2023, the Mohawk Valley Health System and
its two acute care hospitals, St. Elizabeth Medical  Center  (SEMC)  and
Faxton-St.  Luke's  Healthcare  (FSLH),  began  a new chapter in their
provision  of  healthcare  to  the  Mohawk  Valley  and  surrounding
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  part  of  New  York State's "Oneida County Health Care
Transformation Program," Mohawk Valley Health System (MVHS) was able  to
build  the  new  state-of-the-art  Wynn Hospital; when the Wynn Hospital
opened its doors,  the  acute  care  services  of  SEMC  and  FSLH  were
consolidated  into  the new Wynn Hospital building under MVHS, Inc., the
former FSLH; MVHS, Inc. became the new parent of the college; and
 
  WHEREAS, MVHS, Inc will continue to maintain the  strong  traditions
and excellence in clinical experience that have made the college what it
is  today,  but  will offer a rare and unrivaled experience of providing
clinical teaching in a brand-new state-of-the-art facility; and
 
  WHEREAS, St. Elizabeth College of Nursing  provides  their  students
the  ability  to  complete over 600 clinical hours, tailored to meet the
objectives of each  course  they  take  in  their  degree's  curriculum;
medical-surgical  nursing  and  psychiatric components of these clinical
hours take place at The Wynn Hospital campus of the Mohawk Valley Health
System; and
 
  WHEREAS, Other specialty practices that students receive training in
is obstetrical and pediatric nursing  which  takes  place  at  The  Wynn
Hospital campus of MVHS and at Golisano Children's Hospital in Syracuse,
New  York,  respectively, truly providing an in-depth hands-on education
experience for every student; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the curriculum,  in  addition  to  the  clinical
units  aforementioned,  students  are provided the opportunity to attend
scheduled clinical experiences in the community  to  assist  in  meeting
 
objectives  of  the curriculum; these sites include, but are not limited
to: outpatient clinics, long term care facilities, outpatient adult  day
care settings, and physician offices; and
 
  WHEREAS,  St.  Elizabeth  College  of  Nursing  now  also  offers an
Associate  in  Applied  Science  degree  in  nursing  fully  integrating
theoretical  learning  with  clinical  experiences  within  a  caring
environment; this program contains a clinical  component  that  combines
the  theory  learned  in class with actual nursing practice allowing for
immediate transfer and application of knowledge,  giving  St.  Elizabeth
students an advantage when entering the workforce; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud and distinguished history, St. Elizabeth
College  of Nursing may look back with pride upon its humble beginnings,
find just satisfaction in its purposeful growth and hold true of purpose
in its commitment to serving the educational needs of  the  citizens  of
New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 120th Anniversary of St. Elizabeth College  of  Nursing;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to St. Elizabeth College of Nursing.
