BY: M. of A. Slater
 
  COMMEMORATING the 101st Anniversary of the Mohegan
  Volunteer Fire Association
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection services in every locality of our State; for 101  years,  the
Mohegan  Volunteer  Fire  Association  has  worked  to  provide the best
possible emergency service to the people of Mohegan, New  York,  and  to
minimize  suffering,  and  loss  of  life and property incurred by fire,
accidents, disasters, and medical emergencies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate  the  101st  Anniversary  of  the  Mohegan  Volunteer  Fire
Association, celebrated on February 21, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On February 21, 1922, a group of local citizens met in the
little Mohegan Schoolhouse, presently known  as  The  Rugged  Boot  shoe
store, for the purpose of organizing a fire department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  meeting  that  inspired  the  creation of the Mohegan
Volunteer Fire Association occurred after a fire in one of Mohegan,  New
York's  hotels;  the  following  men  were  believed  to  have  been  in
attendance at that impactful  meeting:  Theodore  Hill,  Jr.,  H.  Field
Horne, Arthur Horton, J.W. Horne, William O'Neill, James Gilmartin, John
Wubbe, James Cuatt, Bernard McCord, Addison Garland, Albert Heady, David
Travis,  Everett Travis, Albert Travis, George Jetter, J. Edward Jetter,
Olie Odell, Robert  Foell,  William  Foell,  Herman  Croft,  Christopher
Jetter, William Zugner, Cleveland Curry, and Roy Heady; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  early 20th century, Lake Mohegan's many clubs and
hotels  attracted  tourists  as  a  hub  for  live  bands  and  Broadway
entertainment  outside  of New York City; the summer crowds swelled with
visitors from all over the region and big-name performers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prior to 1922, fires were  fought  by  the  Peekskill  Fire
Companies  and  the  Yorktown  Heights  Engine  Company,  however, their
effectiveness in being able to reach a fire in time to  save  lives  and
property  was  limited; the growth in tourism and population surrounding
the Lake Mohegan community led to a need to develop a  fire  department;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave  firefighters  of  the  Mohegan  Volunteer Fire
Association are prepared to risk their lives every day to help save  the
lives  of  others and to protect homes and property from the destruction
caused by fire; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the skill and devoted  service  demonstrated
by  individual  firefighters,  the  Mohegan  Volunteer  Fire Association
reflects the history and development of firefighting over the  past  101
years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
 
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition  to  those  who  work  so  selflessly  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
good works performed by the volunteer fire  departments  of  this  great
Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
proudly commemorate the 101st Anniversary of the Mohegan Volunteer  Fire
Association; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Mohegan Volunteer Fire Association.
