  CELEBRATING the playing of the ICC Men's T20 World
  Cup  at  Nassau County International Cricket Stadium
  at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow,  New  York,  from
  June 3-12, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the intent of this Legislative Body to commemorate
those sporting events of historical  significance  which  add  strength,
vigor,  and inspiration to the quality of life in the communities of the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
celebrate the playing of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup  at  Nassau  County
International  Cricket  Stadium  at  Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New
York, from June 3-12, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hosted by the International Cricket Council, the T20  World
Cup  is  a  biennial  Twenty20  International cricket tournament between
men's national teams that started in  2007;  this  year  marks  the  9th
edition  of  the  playing of the World Cup, scheduled to be co-hosted by
the West Indies and the United States from June 1 to June 29, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 20 qualifying teams will be divided into four groups of
five teams and the top two teams in each group will advance to the Super
8 round; in this stage, the qualifying teams  will  be  split  into  two
groups  of  four,  with the top two teams from each group qualifying for
the knockout stage; the knockout stage will consist of  two  semi-finals
in Guyana and a final in Barbados; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 2024 World Cup is the first time the United States will
be  hosting and participating in Cricket World Cup games; New York State
will host world cup matches alongside Florida and Texas  in  the  United
States,  as well as, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana, Saint Lucia,
St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines,  and  Trinidad  and  Tobago,
internationally; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Eight  of  the Men's T20 World Cup matches will be held in
Nassau County, including two of the  most  anticipated  matches  between
rivals  India vs Pakistan and the debut of team USA vs India; serving as
the venue, the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium was built  in
only three months and is the first modular cricket stadium in the world,
seating 34,000 fans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cricket has usually been considered a niche, international
sport, with its most loyal fanbases coming from the diaspora of regions,
particularly South Asia, where the sport is  mainstream;  the  New  York
Metropolitan  area being chosen for this opportunity highlights that the
area is home to the largest metropolitan Indian  population  outside  of
Asia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recognizing  the  Nassau  County  hamlet of Hicksville, as
being a growing hub of the Indian American Community, Nassau County will
receive an estimated $2.7 million in direct revenue from the tournament;
 
this historic tournament will leave Eisenhower Park  with  a  legacy  of
permanent improvements to host large cricket tournaments henceforth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
sporting events  which  enhance  the  well-being  and  vitality  of  its
community  and  have shown a long and sustained commitment to excellence
certainly have earned the recognition and applause of all  the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
celebrate the playing of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup  at  Nassau  County
International  Cricket  Stadium  at  Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New
York, from June 3-12, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to the USA Cricket Board of Directors and the Nassau County
Executive.
