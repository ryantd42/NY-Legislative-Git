  HONORING  Chuck  Miller  upon  the occasion of his
  designation for special recognition by the New  York
  State Office for the Aging on May 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Chuck Miller
upon the occasion of his designation for special recognition by the  New
York  State  Office  for the Aging on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at The Hart
Theater Lounge at the Egg Performing Arts Theater at  the  Empire  State
Plaza in Albany, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each May, the New York State Office for the Aging pauses to
acknowledge  the outstanding contributions made by older citizens during
National Older Americans Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of older generations have helped  build  and  shape
our  Nation  to  be  the  greatest  in the world; they have defended our
freedoms and values to ensure that those who come after  them  may  have
better  lives; nowhere in the Nation is the legacy of their efforts more
visible and more a part of the lives of all citizens than  here  in  the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chuck  Miller  of  Chenango  County  has continually shown
extreme competence, extraordinary intelligence, and diligent  leadership
in  his  unwavering service to his community and, consequently, has been
selected for this most prestigious honor; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chuck Miller has repeatedly demonstrated his commitment  to
his community by serving at two meal service sites weekly; he goes above
and beyond the asking of a volunteer, checking in on clients that are no
longer  receiving  meals,  ensuring  their  health and wellness; he also
gives of his time in supporting medical transportation services; and
 
  WHEREAS, This honoree has also restored an  old  hay  wagon  on  his
property  to  provide  hayrides  to friends, family, neighbors, and even
older adults from the senior center during the fall season; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by
individuals  for  the benefit of others which Chuck Miller has displayed
throughout his life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chuck Miller has enriched the lives of his family, friends,
and colleagues through his love and respect for others, and through  the
wisdom  which  comes from many years of living life to the fullest; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Chuck  Miller  upon  the  occasion of his designation for special
 
recognition by the New York State Office for the Aging on May 14,  2024;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Chuck Miller.
