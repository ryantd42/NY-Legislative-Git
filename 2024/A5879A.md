  tive law, the mental hygiene law, the private housing finance law, the
  public authorities law, the social services law and the New York state
  medical care facilities finance agency act, in relation  to  replacing
  the  terms "mentally retarded" and "mental retardation" with "develop-

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 707 of the county law, as added by
 chapter 1 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, upon a
 finding in an ex parte proceeding that expert  services  are  reasonably
 necessary  for  the  prosecution  of the case whether in connection with
 issues relating to guilt or sentencing or  that  investigative  services
 relating  to  a  separate  sentencing proceeding or [mental retardation]
 DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY hearing pursuant to section 400.27 of the crim-
 inal procedure law are  reasonably  necessary,  the  trial  court  shall
 authorize  the  payment  of fees and expenses for such services.  Upon a
 finding that timely procurement of such services could  not  practicably
 await  prior  authorization,  the  court may authorize the provision and
 payment for such services nunc pro tunc.

 graph (c) of subdivision 14 as amended by section 9 of part LLL of chap-
 ter 59 of the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  (b)  The defendant was [mentally retarded] A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL
 DISABILITIES at the time of the crime, or the defendant's mental capaci-
 ty was impaired or his ability to conform his conduct  to  the  require-
 ments  of  law  was  impaired  but  not so impaired in either case as to
 constitute a defense to prosecution;
  (a) Upon the conviction of a defendant for the offense  of  murder  in
 the  first  degree  as  defined  in section 125.27 of the penal law, the
 court shall, upon oral or written motion of the defendant based  upon  a
 showing  that there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is
 [mentally retarded] A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITIES,  promptly
 conduct  a  hearing without a jury to determine whether the defendant is
 [mentally retarded] A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.  Upon  the
 consent  of  both  parties, such a hearing, or a portion thereof, may be
 conducted by the court contemporaneously with  the  separate  sentencing
 proceeding  in  the  presence  of the sentencing jury, which in no event
 shall be the trier of fact with respect to the hearing. At such  hearing
 the defendant has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence
 that  he or she is [mentally retarded] A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISA-
 BILITIES. The court shall defer rendering any finding pursuant  to  this
 subdivision  as to whether the defendant is [mentally retarded] A PERSON
 WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES until a sentence is imposed pursuant  to
 this section.
  (b)  In  the event the defendant is sentenced pursuant to this section
 to life imprisonment without parole or to a term of imprisonment for the
 class A-I felony of murder in the first degree other than a sentence  of
 life  imprisonment  without parole, the court shall not render a finding
 with respect to whether the defendant is [mentally  retarded]  A  PERSON
 WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.
  (c)  In  the event the defendant is sentenced pursuant to this section
 to death, the court shall thereupon render a  finding  with  respect  to
 whether the defendant is [mentally retarded] A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL
 DISABILITIES.  If the court finds the defendant is [mentally retarded] A
 PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, the court shall  set  aside  the
 sentence of death and sentence the defendant either to life imprisonment
 without  parole or to a term of imprisonment for the class A-I felony of
 murder in the first degree other than a sentence  of  life  imprisonment
 without  parole.  If  the  court  finds  the  defendant is not [mentally
 retarded] A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, then  such  sentence
 of death shall not be set aside pursuant to this subdivision.
  (d)  In the event that a defendant is convicted of murder in the first
 degree pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision
 one  of  section 125.27 of the penal law, and the killing occurred while
 the defendant was confined or under  custody  in  a  state  correctional
 facility  or  local correctional institution, and a sentence of death is
 imposed, such sentence may not be set aside pursuant to this subdivision
 upon the ground that the defendant is [mentally retarded] A PERSON  WITH
 DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITIES.  Nothing in this paragraph or paragraph (a)
 of this subdivision shall preclude a defendant from presenting  mitigat-
 ing  evidence  of  [mental  retardation] DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY at the
 separate sentencing proceeding.
  (e) The foregoing provisions of this subdivision notwithstanding, at a
 reasonable time prior to the commencement of trial  the  defendant  may,
 upon a written motion alleging reasonable cause to believe the defendant
 is  [mentally  retarded] A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, apply
 A. 5879  3
 
 for an order directing that a [mental retardation]  DEVELOPMENTAL  DISA-
 BILITY  hearing  be  conducted  prior  to  trial. If, upon review of the
 defendant's motion and any response thereto, the court finds  reasonable
 cause  to  believe  the  defendant  is [mentally retarded] A PERSON WITH
 DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, it shall promptly conduct a hearing  without
 a  jury  to  determine  whether  the  defendant is [mentally retarded] A
 PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. In the  event  the  court  finds
 after the hearing that the defendant is not [mentally retarded] A PERSON
 WITH  DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITIES, the court must, prior to commencement
 of trial, enter an order so stating, but nothing in this paragraph shall
 preclude a defendant from  presenting  mitigating  evidence  of  [mental
 retardation]  DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY at a separate sentencing proceed-
 ing. In the event the court finds after the hearing that the  defendant,
 based  upon  a  preponderance  of the evidence, is [mentally retarded] A
 PERSON  WITH  DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITIES,  the  court  must,  prior  to
 commencement  of  trial,  enter an order so stating. Unless the order is
 reversed on an appeal by the people or unless the  provisions  of  para-
 graph  (d)  of  this subdivision apply, a separate sentencing proceeding
 under this section shall not be conducted if the defendant is thereafter
 convicted of murder in  the  first  degree.  In  the  event  a  separate
 sentencing  proceeding is not conducted, the court, upon conviction of a
 defendant for the crime of murder in the first  degree,  shall  sentence
 the  defendant  to  life imprisonment without parole or to a sentence of
 imprisonment for the class A-I felony of  murder  in  the  first  degree
 other  than  a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.  Whenever a
 [mental retardation] DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY  hearing  is  held  and  a
 finding  is  rendered  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  the court may not
 conduct a hearing pursuant to paragraph (a)  of  this  subdivision.  For
 purposes  of  this  subdivision and paragraph (b) of subdivision nine of
 this section, ["mental retardation"]  "DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITY"  means
 significantly  subaverage  general  intellectual  functioning  existing
 concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior  which  were  manifested
 before the age of eighteen.
  (f)  In  the event the court enters an order pursuant to paragraph (e)
 of this subdivision finding that the defendant is [mentally retarded]  A
 PERSON  WITH  DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITIES,  the  people may appeal as of
 right from the order pursuant to subdivision ten of  section  450.20  of
 this  chapter.  Upon  entering  such  an order the court must afford the
 people a reasonable period of time, which shall not  be  less  than  ten
 days, to determine whether to take an appeal from the order finding that
 the  defendant  is [mentally retarded] A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISA-
 BILITIES. The taking of an appeal by the people stays the  effectiveness
 of  the  court's order and any order fixing a date for trial. Within six
 months of the effective date of this subdivision, the court  of  appeals
 shall  adopt rules to ensure that appeals pursuant to this paragraph are
 expeditiously perfected, reviewed and determined so that pretrial delays
 are minimized. Prior to adoption of the  rules,  the  court  of  appeals
 shall  issue  proposed  rules  and receive written comments thereon from
 interested parties.
  (a) As used in this subdivision, the term "psychiatric evidence" means
 evidence of mental disease,  defect  or  condition  in  connection  with
 either a mitigating factor defined in this section or a [mental retarda-
 tion]  DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITY  hearing pursuant to this section to be
 offered by a psychiatrist, psychologist or other person who has received
 training, or education, or has experience relating  to  the  identifica-
 A. 5879  4
 
 tion,  diagnosis,  treatment  or  evaluation  of  mental disease, mental
 defect or mental condition.
  (c)  When  a defendant serves notice pursuant to this subdivision, the
 district attorney may make application, upon notice  to  the  defendant,
 for  an order directing that the defendant submit to an examination by a
 psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or licensed clinical social  worker
 designated  by  the  district  attorney,  for  the  purpose of rebutting
 evidence offered by the defendant with  respect  to  a  mental  disease,
 defect,  or  condition  in  connection  with  either a mitigating factor
 defined in this section, including  whether  the  defendant  was  acting
 under  duress,  was  mentally  or  emotionally  disturbed  or  [mentally
 retarded] WAS A PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, or was under the
 influence of alcohol or any drug. If the  application  is  granted,  the
 district  attorney  shall schedule a time and place for the examination,
 which shall be recorded. Counsel for the people and the defendant  shall
 have  the  right  to  be present at the examination. A transcript of the
 examination shall be made available to the defendant  and  the  district
 attorney  promptly  after  its conclusion.  The district attorney shall
 promptly serve on the defendant a written copy of the findings and eval-
 uation of the examiner. If  the  court  finds  that  the  defendant  has
 wilfully  refused  to cooperate fully in an examination pursuant to this
 paragraph, it shall, upon request of the district attorney, instruct the
 jury that the defendant did not submit to or  cooperate  fully  in  such
 psychiatric examination. When a defendant is subjected to an examination
 pursuant  to  an  order  issued in accordance with this subdivision, any
 statement made by the defendant for the purpose of the examination shall
 be inadmissible in evidence  against  him  in  any  criminal  action  or
 proceeding  on  any issue other than that of whether a mitigating factor
 has been established or whether the defendant is [mentally  retarded]  A
 PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, but such statement is admissible
 upon  such an issue whether or not it would otherwise be deemed a privi-
 leged communication.
  At a reasonable time prior to the sentencing proceeding or  a  [mental
 retardation] DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY hearing:
  (c)  If,  after  complying  with  the provisions of this section or an
 order pursuant thereto, a party finds either before or during a sentenc-
 ing proceeding or [mental retardation] DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY hearing,
 additional material subject to discovery or covered by court order,  the
 party shall promptly make disclosure or apply for a protective order.
  §  3.  Subdivision 10 of section 450.20 of the criminal procedure law,
 as added by chapter 1 of the  laws  of  1995,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  10.  An order, entered pursuant to paragraph (e) of subdivision twelve
 of section 400.27, finding that the defendant is [mentally  retarded]  A
 PERSON WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

 of constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating or improving thereon one
 or more community mental health and [retardation] DEVELOPMENTAL DISABIL-

 acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement
 thereon  of one or more community mental health and [retardation] DEVEL-
 OPMENTAL DISABILITIES facilities, pursuant to the provisions of this act
 and the facilities development corporation act.  The agency  is  hereby
 authorized to lease or sublease such real property and facilities there-
 on  to the corporation for the purpose of making the same available to a

 accordance  with  the provisions of a lease, sublease or other agreement

 health and [retardation] DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES facility or  facili-
 ties  constructed,  reconstructed, rehabilitated or improved thereon and

 than or equal to the purchase price of the real property,  the  depreci-
 ated  cost  of  THE sum of the community mental health and [retardation]
 DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES facility constructed, reconstructed, rehabil-
 itated, demolished or improved thereon and all other costs of the agency
