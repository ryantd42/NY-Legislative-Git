 AN  ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to requiring a
  vision test for the renewal of a driver's license
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 6 of section 502 of the vehi-
 cle and traffic law, as amended by chapter 37 of the laws  of  2019,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a)  A  license  issued  pursuant  to subdivision five of this section
 shall be valid until the expiration date contained thereon, unless  such
 license  is suspended, revoked or cancelled. Such license may be renewed
 by submission of an application for renewal, the fee prescribed by  law,
 proofs  of  prior licensing, fitness and acceptable vision prescribed by
 the commissioner, the applicant's social security  number  or,  in  lieu
 thereof,  with  respect  to an application for a non-commercial driver's
 license or learner's permit which does not meet  federal  standards  for
 identification, an affidavit signed by such applicant that they have not
 been issued a social security number, and if required by the commission-
 er,  a  photo  image  of  the  applicant in such numbers and form as the
 commissioner shall prescribe.  PROOF  OF  ACCEPTABLE  VISION  SHALL  BE
 REQUIRED  IN  THE  FORM  OF  AN EYE TEST OR A DOCTOR'S CERTIFICATION FOR
 LICENSE RENEWAL PURSUANT TO THIS  SUBDIVISION.  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL
 ALLOW  THE  ONLINE  SUBMISSION  OF A DOCTOR'S CERTIFICATION OF AN APPLI-
 CANT'S PROOF OF ACCEPTABLE VISION. In addition, an applicant for renewal
 of a license containing a hazardous material endorsement shall  pass  an
 examination  to  retain  such  endorsement. The commissioner shall, with
 respect to the renewal of a hazardous materials endorsement, comply with
 the requirements imposed upon states by sections 383.141 and 1572.13  of
 title  49  of the code of federal regulations. A renewal of such license
 shall be issued by the commissioner upon approval of  such  application,

 except  that  no  such  license shall be issued if its issuance would be
 inconsistent with the provisions of section five hundred sixteen of this
 title, and except that the commissioner may refuse to renew such license
 if the applicant is the holder of a currently valid or renewable license
 to drive issued by another state or foreign country unless the applicant
 surrenders such license.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
 it  shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
 completed on or before such effective date.
