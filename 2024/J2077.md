an  early  age,  watching his father, a licensed electrician, respond to
alarms as a volunteer firefighter with the Greenburgh  Fire  Department;
and

joined the Hartsdale Fire Department as a volunteer and then went on  to
become a career firefighter with the department in 1980; and
 
  WHEREAS, Raymond J. Baker, Sr., met the love of his life, the former

years  at  Our  Lady  of  Sorrows Elementary School in White Plains, New
York, were married in 1993 and moved from Hartsdale to Somers  in  1995;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Together,  the couple raised their two wonderful children,
Raymond Jr., who is also  a  Lieutenant  with  the  Lewisboro  Volunteer

teacher at BOCES Westchester; and
 
  WHEREAS, Deputy Chief Raymond J. Baker, Sr., retired in 2013 after a
33-year career with  the  Hartsdale  Fire  Department;  in  addition  to
responding  to  thousands  of fire alarms and other emergency calls as a

the  past  eight  years,  and  together  rising through the ranks- he as
Deputy Chief and Baker Jr. as Fire Lieutenant; and
 
  WHEREAS, A true mentor, Deputy Chief  Raymond  J.  Baker,  Sr.,  was
always more than willing to share his lifetime of experience, expertise,

being who gave four-and-a-half decades of his life to  safeguarding  the
residents of his community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  conservationist  who  enjoyed  the  great  outdoors,
especially hunting and fishing, Deputy Chief Raymond J. Baker, Sr.,  was

  WHEREAS, Deputy Chief Raymond J. Baker,  Sr.,  is  survived  by  his
wife,  Ann; their children, Raymond Jr. (Laura) and Ryan (Julianna); and
his many firefighter colleagues whom he always  considered  his  sisters
and  brothers; he is predeceased by his parents, Raymond and Millie, and
a sister, Louise; and

and the enormous impact he had on everyone with whom he came in contact;
and

grateful  appreciation  and  heartfelt  regret  in  recognition  of  a
courageous  firefighter  who dedicated his purposeful life and career in
faithful service to his family and community; now, therefore, be it
