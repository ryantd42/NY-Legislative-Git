 Introduced  by  M. of A. MAHER, GOODELL -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Ways and Means
 
 AN ACT to amend the financial services law, the tax law and  the  public
  health law, in relation to enacting the Health Care Tax Reform Act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be  cited  as  the  "Health
 Care Tax Reform Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The Legislature hereby finds that:
  (a) The affordability of health care and health insurance is extremely
 important  in  ensuring  that the maximum number of New York State resi-
 dents can obtain high quality affordable health care;
  (b) Health care and health insurance are currently subject to  several
 taxes that directly and indirectly increase the cost of health insurance
 coverage,  including  an annual flat tax on all privately insured people
 in New York State called the covered lives assessment  that  raises  the
 costs  to  health  plans by $1.1 Billion, a 9.63% sales tax surcharge on
 certain  hospital  based  health  services  that  costs  consumers  $3.6
 Billion,  a  1.75%  flat tax on all commercial health insurance policies
 that costs consumers $350 Million, and a gross receipts tax on insurance
 companies called a section 206 assessment that costs health  plans  $149
 Million a year;
  (c)  Collectively,  the taxes on health care and health insurance cost
 consumers a total of over $5 Billion in 2018, which  exceeds  the  total
 amount  of  taxes  paid  by corporations through the franchise taxes and
 exceeds all other types of taxes except for personal  income  taxes  and
 general sales taxes; and
  (d)  The  taxes  on health care and health insurance are fundamentally
 regressive taxes because the taxes are unrelated to a consumer's  wealth
 or  ability to pay, directly impact hospitalization costs at a time when
 consumers are facing some of  their  greatest  health  care  challenges,

 directly  increase  the cost of health insurance, and are counterproduc-
 tive to the public  policy  objective  of  making  health  insurance  as
 affordable as possible.
