  Fife & Drum Corps
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of the citizens of the State of New York to
recognize  and  pay tribute to those institutions and individuals within
our midst that diligently strive to uphold and promote excellence, while
providing  meaningful  services  to  their  members  and  the  community
at-large; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Jeffrey  Waterman for his 60 years of dedication and service to
the Camden Continentals Fife & Drum Corps; and
 
  WHEREAS, Before its establishment in Camden, New  York,  the  Camden
Continentals  Fife  & Drum Corps was created in the mid-1800s within the
Town of Taberg, New York under the direction of Alanson White; in  1945,
the  band  moved  to Camden and was named the Camden Continentals Fife &
Drum Corps; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originally  formed  to  play  at  political  rallies  and
patriotic  celebrations,  the  Camden  Continentals  Fife  &  Drum Corps
adheres to the mission statement to entertain the people of Central  New
York,  while promoting patriotism and a general sense of esprit de corps
within the community; the Corps now appears in around 15 events per year
at parades and musters; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1850, the Corps acted as a Training Unit  for  the  Army
and  in  the  past have performed in Washington DC for President Grant's
inauguration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jeffrey  Waterman  was  the  Director  of  the  Camden
Continentals  from  1973  to  2020,  until  his  son,  Randy  Waterman,
ultimately took over as director; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dedicated to the mission of the oldest fife and drum  corps
in  the  State  of  New  York,  Jeffrey  Waterman  celebrated his golden
anniversary with the Camden Continentals Fife & Drum Corps in August  of
2014  and  still  continues  to  remain  a  dedicated  member;  like his
ancestor, he beautifully plays the fife; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments to
preserve American Heritage are brought to our attention, they should  be
celebrated  and  recognized  by  all  the  citizens of this great Empire
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Jeffrey  Waterman for his 60 years of dedication and service to
the Camden Continentals Fife & Drum Corps; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
