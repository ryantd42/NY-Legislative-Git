  COMMEMORATING  the  246th  Anniversary  of  Sybil
  Ludington's legendary ride,  alerting  the  American
  Militia  that  British forces were approaching to be
  observed April 26, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge and
celebrate individuals and events  of  historic  significance  which  add
vitality,  sensitivity,  understanding  and inspiration to the diversity
and value of the people of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 246th Anniversary of Sybil Ludington's  legendary  ride,
alerting the American Militia that British forces were approaching to be
observed on Wednesday, April 26, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sybil  Ludington  is  an  unsung  heroine  of the American
Revolutionary War; on April 26, 1777, she  and  her  horse,  Star,  rode
through the night alerting militia forces to the approach of the British
regular forces; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  action was similar to that performed by Jack Jouett,
William Dawes and Paul Revere, although she rode  more  than  twice  the
distance  of  Paul  Revere, and was only 16 years-old at the time of her
action; and
 
  WHEREAS, The legend has been very widely disseminated, and Paula  D.
Hunt  concludes  an  extensive  study of it by saying, "The story of the
lone, teenage girl riding for freedom, it seems, is simply too good  not
to be believed"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sybil Ludington, born on April 5, 1761, in Kent, New York,
was one of 12 children of Colonel Henry and Abigail  Knowles  Ludington;
she and her family moved to Dutchess County, New York, where they farmed
a very large piece of land; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  April  26, 1777, Sybil Ludington rode 40 miles through
the night to warn approximately 400 militiamen under the control of  her
father that British troops were planning to attack Danbury, Connecticut,
where  the Continental Army had a supply depot; on her way to gather her
father's troops, she also warned the people of Danbury of  the  imminent
danger by knocking on doors with a stick; and
 
  WHEREAS, The afternoon after Sybil Ludington's ride through Danbury,
the  British  troops  burned down three buildings and destroyed multiple
houses but, due to her steadfast efforts, they did not kill many  people
as  expected;  at  the  start  of the Battle of Ridgefield, however, the
militia was able to drive General William Tryon, then  Governor  of  the
colony of New York, and his men, to Long Island Sound; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sybil  Ludington  was  congratulated  for  her  heroism by
friends, neighbors and General George Washington; and
 
  WHEREAS, After the war, Sybil  Ludington  married  Edmond  Ogden  in
1784;  together, they raised their son, Henry; in 1792, she settled with
her husband and son in Catskill, New York, where they  lived  until  her
death on February 26, 1839, at the age of 77; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1935, the State of New York placed a number of markers
along Sybil Lundington's historic route; a  statue  of  this  courageous
young woman, sculpted by Anna Hyatt Huntington, was erected near Carmel,
New York, in 1961 to commemorate her ride; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Smaller versions of the statue exist on the grounds of the
Daughters of the American Revolution Headquarters in Washington, DC,  as
well  as the grounds of the public library in Danbury, and in the Elliot
and Rosemary Offner Museum at  Brookgreen  Gardens  in  Murrells  Inlet,
South Carolina; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1975, Sybil Ludington was honored with a postage stamp
in the "Contributors to the Cause" United  States  Bicentennial  series;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  1979,  the Sybil Ludington 50k Run has been held in
Carmel in recognition of her long and cold  ride;  the  course  of  this
hilly road race approximates her significant ride, and finishes near her
statue on the shore of Lake Gleneida in Carmel; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body recognizes that New York State is the
home  to  countless  women who are strong and colorful threads, vital to
the fabric of our rich heritage, who have contributed, and  continue  to
add  to  the  advancement  of  our culture through their traditional and
non-traditional roles in society; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  246th Anniversary of Sybil Ludington's legendary ride,
alerting the American Militia that British forces were approaching to be
observed on April 26, 2023.
