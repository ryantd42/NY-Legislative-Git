  (vii)  Every  large  group  policy delivered or issued for delivery in
 this state that provides medical, major medical  or  similar  comprehen-
 sive-type  coverage  shall  provide  coverage  for  three  [cycles  of]
 COMPLETED OOCYTE RETRIEVALS AND  in-vitro  fertilization  [used  in  the
 treatment  of infertility] WITH UNLIMITED EMBRYO TRANSFERS FROM FRESH OR

 tion using a fresh embryo transfer; or medications are administered  for
 endometrial  preparation with the intent of undergoing in-vitro fertili-
 zation using a frozen embryo transfer.]

 intercourse  or  therapeutic  donor insemination, or after six months of
 regular, unprotected sexual intercourse or therapeutic  donor  insemina-
 tion  for  a  female  thirty-five  years of age or older; (B) A PERSON'S
 INABILITY TO REPRODUCE EITHER AS A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL OR WITH THEIR PART-
 NER WITHOUT MEDICAL INTERVENTION;  OR  (C)  A  LICENSED  PHYSICIAN'S  OR

 ual's medical history or physical findings.

 ANCE  WITH THE GUIDELINES OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDI-

 to annual deductibles and coinsurance, including copayments, as  may  be
 deemed  appropriate  by  the  superintendent  and as are consistent with

 purposes of this subparagraph, a "cycle" is defined as either all treat-
 ment  that  starts  when:  preparatory  medications are administered for
 ovarian stimulation for oocyte retrieval with the intent  of  undergoing
