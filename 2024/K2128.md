BY: M. of A. Raga
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  213th  Anniversary  of  the
  Independence of the Republic of Paraguay
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  celebrate
historical  events  which  exemplify  the spirit and struggle of peoples
throughout the world to achieve  independence  and  live  in  peace  and
freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern and in full accord with its long-
standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 213th Anniversary of the Independence of the Republic of
Paraguay, to be celebrated on May 14, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Paraguay is a Spanish speaking  country  in  South  America
that shares borders with Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pre-Columbian  society in the wooded, fertile region which
is now present-day Paraguay, consisted of semi-nomadic tribes, who  were
recognized for their fierce warrior traditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  indigenous  tribes  were  members  of five distinct
language families, and 17 separate ethno-linguistic groups  which  still
remain today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Europeans  first  arrived  in  the  area in the early 16th
Century, and the settlement of Asuncion, the capital and largest city of
Paraguay, was founded on August 15, 1537, by the Spanish  explorer  Juan
de Salazar y Espinoza; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  city  of  Asuncion  eventually became the center of a
Spanish colonial province, as well as  a  primary  site  of  the  Jesuit
missions and settlements in South America in the 18th Century; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jesuit  Reductions  were founded and flourished in eastern
Paraguay for about 150 years until the expulsion of the Jesuits  by  the
Spanish crown in 1767; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Paraguay  officially  declared  its  independence  after
overthrowing the local Spanish administration on May 15, 1811; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first Paraguayans arrived in America between  1841  and
1850;  today, it is still a developing nation; its citizens have endured
through both national political instability and a  transition  toward  a
democratic government; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While a small nation in size and population, Paraguay is a
nation of rich  cultural  diversity;  Guarani,  the  secondary  national
language, is spoken in communities throughout Paraguay; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the United States Census Bureau in 2022, there
were  about  24,500  Paraguayans  currently living in the United States;
historically, a  significant  number  of  Paraguayans  left  their  home
country  during  the  nation's civil war in 1947, and relocated in large
 
cities across the United States with large concentrations located in New
York's counties of Queens and Westchester; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  the  New  York  Mayor's Office of Immigrant
Affairs, the Paraguayan population in New York  between  2010  and  2019
grew at an astounding rate of 154.4%, from a reported number of 1,674 in
2010, to the most recent count of 4,259 in 2019; likewise the percentage
growth  of  the Paraguayan population in New York City doubled from 0.2%
in 2010, to the most recent accounting of 0.4% in 2019; and
 
  WHEREAS, Multiple  cultural  organizations  in  New  York  City  are
planning  on  holding  various cultural and social gatherings as well as
historical celebrations to commemorate  the  213th  Anniversary  of  the
Independence of the Republic of Paraguay; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  vital  organizations  will  also  be  involved  in
celebrating the Republic of Paraguay's Independence to further the  goal
of  cultivating  and  bringing awareness to the Paraguayan culture among
Paraguayan people in  and  around  New  York  City,  and  educating  the
importance of history and culture of Paraguayan to everyone; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize the
great contributions which Paraguayans have  brought  to  our  State  and
Nation,  and  to  wish  them  all  continued success in their purposeful
endeavors; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate the 213th Anniversary of the Independence of the Republic of
Paraguay; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to esteemed Paraguayan organizations in  the  State  of  New
York.
