  3-a. In addition to the fees retained pursuant to subdivision three of
 this section, each county clerk acting as the agent of the  commissioner
 pursuant  to subdivision one of this section shall retain [four percent]
 A PERCENTAGE of  "enhanced  internet  and  electronic  partner  revenue"
 collected  by  the  commissioner.  For the purposes of this subdivision,
 "enhanced internet and electronic partner revenue" shall mean the amount
 of gross receipts attributable to  all  transactions  conducted  on  the
 internet  by  residents of such county and by designated partners of the
 department on behalf of such residents for  the  current  calendar  year
 [that  exceeds  the amount of such revenue collected by the commissioner
 during calendar year two thousand eleven]. The commissioner shall certi-
 fy the amounts to be retained by each  county  clerk  pursuant  to  this

 retained by county clerks pursuant to this subdivision in calendar years
 two thousand twelve and two thousand thirteen combined  exceeds  eighty-
 S. 4008--C  9  A. 3008--C

 eight million five hundred thousand dollars, then the percentage of fees
 to  be  retained  thereafter  shall  be reduced to a percentage that, if
 applied to the fees collected during calendar years two thousand  twelve
 and  two thousand thirteen combined, would have resulted in an aggregate
 retention of eighty-eight million five hundred thousand dollars  or  2.5
 percent  of  enhanced internet and electronic partner revenue, whichever
 is higher. If the aggregate amount of fees  retained  by  county  clerks
 pursuant  to  this subdivision in calendar years two thousand twelve and
 two thousand thirteen combined is less than  eighty-eight  million  five
 hundred  thousand  dollars,  then  the percentage of fees to be retained
 thereafter shall be increased to a percentage that, if  applied  to  the
 fees  collected  during calendar years two thousand twelve and two thou-
 sand thirteen combined, would have resulted in an aggregate retention of
 eighty-eight million five hundred thousand dollars, or  six  percent  of
 enhanced  internet and electronic partner revenue, whichever is less. On
 and after April first, two thousand sixteen,  the  percent  of  enhanced
 internet  and electronic partner revenue to be retained by county clerks
 shall be the average of the  annual  percentages  that  were  in  effect
 between  April  first,  two  thousand twelve and March thirty-first, two
 thousand sixteen.] THE RETENTION PERCENTAGE SHALL BE 10.75 PERCENT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect January 1, 2024.

  PART TT

  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Suffolk county water quality restoration act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The county  of  Suffolk  ("county"),  with  a
 population  of  one million five hundred thousand persons, has in excess
 of three hundred eighty thousand  existing  onsite  wastewater  disposal
 systems,  comprised  mostly  of  cesspools  and septic systems, with two
 hundred nine thousand of these onsite systems in environmentally  sensi-
 tive  areas which could benefit from nitrogen-reducing technologies. The
 United States Environmental Protection Agency recognizes Long Island  as
 having  a  sole  source  aquifer  system  for its drinking water supply.
 Suffolk county has an imminent need  to  preserve  this  valuable  water
 resource  by reducing the amount of nitrogen discharged into the ground-
 water by onsite systems. The full water cycle is impacted by  increasing
 quantities of nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, volatile organic contam-
 inants  and saltwater intrusion, as well as a number of emerging threats
 such as prescription drugs and sea level rise.
  The Suffolk county subwatersheds wastewater plan ("SWP"), certified by
 the  department  of  environmental  conservation  as  a  Nine  Elements
 Watershed  (9E)  plan,  has  documented  the devastating effects of high
 levels of nitrogen pollution, not only on the  drinking  water  quality,
 but  also  on  coastal  ecosystems,  dissolved  oxygen,  water  clarity,
 eelgrass, wetlands, shellfish,  coastal  resilience  and  in  triggering
 harmful  algal  blooms.  The SWP is a long-term plan to address the need
 for wastewater treatment infrastructure throughout the county comprehen-
 sively over a period of fifty years. The SWP delineates the  source  and
 concentration  of  nitrogen  loading  in  one hundred ninety-one subwat-
 ersheds throughout the county, and establishes nitrogen reduction  goals
 for each watershed.
  For many areas of the county, installing or connecting sewers is not a
 practical  or  cost-effective  method  of  treating wastewater. For that
 reason, the SWP prescribes a hybrid approach  that  relies  on  sewering
 where feasible, and the replacement of cesspools and septic systems with
 innovative/alternative  onsite wastewater treatment systems. The consol-
 idation of any or all of the twenty-seven  county  sewer  districts,  as
 well  as  unsewered  areas  of the county, into a county-wide wastewater
 management district, the establishment of a  water  quality  restoration
 fund,  and  a county board of trustees to monitor progress and the allo-
 cation of resources consistent with the goals of the SWP would allow for
 the implementation of a  much  needed  integrated  long-term  wastewater
 solution for the county through comprehensive planning and management to
 improve water quality.
  The  purpose of this act is to create a water quality restoration fund
 to finance projects for the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation
 of groundwater and surface waters as recommended by the  SWP.  This  act
 would allow the funding of projects that will mitigate wastewater pollu-
 tants  utilizing  the best available technology consistent with the SWP.
 The water quality restoration fund would be financed  with  a  dedicated
 and recurring revenue source by the enactment of an additional sales and
 S. 4008--C  27  A. 3008--C

 compensating  use  tax  at  the  rate of one-eighth of one percent until
 2060.  Such tax would be enacted pursuant to a mandatory referendum.
  This  act  shall  also  provide  Suffolk  county with the authority to
 create a county-wide wastewater management district through the  consol-
 idation  of  existing  county  sewer  districts with currently unsewered
 areas of the county. A county-wide wastewater management  district  will
 provide  an  integrated  and  efficient  approach to managing wastewater
 services across the county; allow the county to enhance and  expand  its
 incentive  program to property owners to upgrade their wastewater treat-
 ment systems; to manage, monitor and enforce nitrogen reduction programs
 throughout the county; complete  additional  sewer  extension  projects;
 improve  the  economic wellbeing of communities; and provide an opportu-
 nity to consolidate and streamline the county's existing sewer  district
 system  and  normalize  the  inequitable  rate  structure  that has long
 existed.
  In addition, this act will extend  the  existing  one-quarter  of  one
 percent  sales  tax  utilized  to  finance  the  county  drinking  water
 protection program until 2060.
  § 3. The county law is amended by adding a new section 256-b  to  read

 COUNTY OF SUFFOLK, TWENTY-FIVE YEARS.
  § 4-a. Subdivisions (a) and (d) of section 1210-A of the tax  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  683  of  the  laws of 2007, are amended to read as
 follows:
  (a) In addition to the taxes imposed by section twelve hundred ten  or

 authorized and empowered to adopt and amend a local  law,  ordinance  or
 resolution  imposing  within  the  territorial  limits of said county an

 study  regarding  the participation of minority and women-owned business
 enterprises in state contracts since the amendment of this article to be
 delivered  to  the  governor  and  legislature  no  later  than  August
 fifteenth,  two thousand [twenty-three] TWENTY-FOUR.  The study shall be
 prepared by an entity independent of the department and selected through
 a request for proposal process. The purpose of such study is:
  (a) to determine whether there is a disparity between  the  number  of
 qualified minority and women-owned businesses ready, willing and able to
 perform  state contracts for commodities, services and construction, and
 the  number  of  such  contractors  actually  engaged  to  perform  such
 contracts,  and  to  determine  what  changes, if any, should be made to
 state policies affecting minority and women-owned business enterprises;
  (b) to determine whether there is a disparity between  the  number  of
 qualified  minorities and women ready, willing and able, with respect to
 labor markets, qualifications and other relevant factors, to participate
 in contractor employment, management level bodies, including  boards  of
 directors,  and as senior executive officers within contracting entities
 and the number of such group members  actually  employed  or  affiliated
 with  state  contractors in the aforementioned capacities, and to deter-

 history of minority and women-owned  business  enterprise  programs  and
 their effectiveness as a means of securing and ensuring participation by
 minorities and women, and a disparity analysis by market area and region
 of  the  state.  Such  study  shall  distinguish between minority males,
 minority females and non-minority females in the  statistical  analysis;
 and
  (c)  such  study  shall also include an analysis of the utilization on
 state agency contracts of businesses owned by an Indian nation or tribe,
 as such term is defined in section two of  the  Indian  law,  whether  a
 disparity  exists between availability of such businesses to participate
 on state agency contracts and utilization, and, if so,  the  feasibility
 of  authorizing  an  Indian  nation  or tribe owned businesses to become
 certified as a participant in  the  minority  and  women-owned  business
 enterprise program.
  2.  The  director  of  the  division  of minority and women's business
 development is directed to transmit the disparity study to the  governor
