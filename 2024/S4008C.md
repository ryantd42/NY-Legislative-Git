 vehicle  utilized  in  such  demonstrations  and  tests  to  operate  in
 violation of article 22 or title 7  of  the  vehicle  and  traffic  law,
 excluding section 1226 of such law.
  §  2.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that

 therewith.
 
  PART K
 
  Section  1. Paragraphs 26 and 27 of subdivision (a) of section 1642 of
 the vehicle and traffic law, paragraph 26 as added and paragraph  27  as
 amended  by  chapter  248  of  the  laws of 2014, are amended to read as
 follows:
  26. (a) With respect to highways (which term for the purposes of  this
 paragraph shall include private roads open to public motor vehicle traf-
 fic)  in such city, other than state highways maintained by the state on
 which the department of transportation shall have established higher  or
 lower  speed  limits  than the statutory fifty-five miles per hour speed
 limit as provided in section sixteen hundred twenty of this title, or on
 which the department of transportation shall have designated  that  such
 city  shall not establish any maximum speed limit as provided in section
 sixteen hundred twenty-four of this title, subject  to  the  limitations
 imposed by section sixteen hundred eighty-four of this title, establish-
 ment  of  maximum speed limits at which vehicles may proceed within such
 city or within designated areas of such city higher or  lower  than  the
 fifty-five  miles  per hour maximum statutory limit. No such speed limit
 applicable throughout such city or within designated areas of such  city
 shall  be  established at less than [twenty-five] TWENTY miles per hour,
 except that school speed limits may  be  established  at  no  less  than
 [fifteen]  TEN  miles  per  hour  [pursuant  to]  NOTWITHSTANDING  the
 provisions of section sixteen hundred forty-three of this article.
  (b) A city shall not lower OR RAISE a speed limit by  more  than  five
 miles  per  hour  pursuant  to  this paragraph unless such city provides
 written notice and an opportunity to comment to the community  board  or
 community boards established pursuant to section twenty-eight hundred of
 the  New  York city charter with jurisdiction over the area in which the
 lower OR HIGHER speed limit shall apply. Such notice may be provided  by
 electronic mail and shall be provided sixty days prior to the establish-
 ment of such lower OR HIGHER speed limit.
  27.  (a)  Establishment  of  maximum  speed limits below [twenty-five]
 TWENTY miles per hour at which motor vehicles may proceed  on  or  along
 designated  highways within such city for the explicit purpose of imple-
 menting traffic  calming  measures  as  such  term  is  defined  herein;
 provided,  however, that no speed limit shall be set below [fifteen] TEN
 miles per hour nor shall such speed limit be established where the traf-
 fic calming measure to be  implemented  consists  solely  of  a  traffic
 control sign.  Establishment of such a speed limit shall, where applica-
 ble,  be  in  compliance with the provisions of sections sixteen hundred
 twenty-four and sixteen hundred eighty-four  of  this  [chapter]  TITLE.
 Nothing  contained  herein shall be deemed to alter or affect the estab-
 lishment of school speed limits pursuant to the  provisions  of  section
 sixteen  hundred  forty-three  of this article, PROVIDED THAT THE SCHOOL
 SPEED LIMIT SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH TWENTY-SIX OF THIS SUBDIVISION  SHALL
 APPLY  IN ANY CITY TO WHICH THIS SECTION IS APPLICABLE. For the purposes
 of this paragraph, "traffic calming measures" shall  mean  any  physical
 engineering  measure  or  measures  that  reduce the negative effects of
 motor vehicle use, alter driver  behavior  and  improve  conditions  for
 non-motorized street users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.
  (b)  Any  city  establishing  maximum speed limits below [twenty-five]
 TWENTY miles per hour pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph  shall
 S. 4008--B  30
 
 submit  a  report to the governor, the temporary president of the senate
 and the speaker of the assembly on or before March first,  two  thousand
 fifteen  and biannually thereafter on the results of using traffic calm-
 ing  measures and speed limits lower than [twenty-five] TWENTY miles per
 hour as authorized by this paragraph. This report  shall  also  be  made
 available  to  the public by such city on its website. Such report shall
 include, but not be limited to the following:
  (i) a description of the designated  highways  where  traffic  calming
 measures and a lower speed limit were established [and];
  (ii)  a  description of the specific traffic calming measures used and
 the maximum speed limit established; and
  (iii) a comparison of the aggregate  type,  number,  and  severity  of
 accidents reported on streets on which street calming measures and lower
 speed  limits  were implemented in the year preceding the implementation
 of such measures and policies and the year following the  implementation
 of  such  measures and policies, to the extent this information is main-
 tained by any agency of the state or the city.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  SUBPART A
 
  Section  1.  Subparagraph  3  of  paragraph  (c) of subdivision 2 of
 section 1193 of the vehicle and traffic law, as amended by  chapter  732
 of the laws of 2006, is amended to read as follows:
  (3)  In no event shall a new license be issued where a person has been
 twice convicted of a violation  of  [subdivision]  ANY  COMBINATION  OF,
 SUBDIVISION  TWO, TWO-A, three, four or four-a of section eleven hundred
 ninety-two of this article [or of driving while intoxicated or of  driv-
 ing  while  ability is impaired by the use of a drug or of driving while
 ability is impaired by the combined influence of drugs or of alcohol and
 any drug or drugs], OR OF SECTIONS  120.03,  120.04,  120.04-A,  125.12,
 125.13, OR 125.14 OF THE PENAL LAW, where physical injury, as defined in
 section  10.00  of the penal law, has resulted from such offense in each
 instance.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  SUBPART B
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares:
  1.  In  2009, New York adopted "Leandra's Law" to require, as a condi-
 tion of sentence, that all individuals convicted of the crime of driving
 S. 4008--B  31

 while intoxicated install an ignition interlock device (IID) for a spec-
 ified time in any vehicle they own or operate.  Fifteen  years  later,
 despite  the  mandate,  only  three in ten offenders actually install an
 IID.
  2.  In  addition,  although  the  penalty model based predominantly on
 license revocation persists, far too many offenders  continue  to  drive
 even  after losing their  license privilege, and a significant number of
 them  continue to drive under the influence of alcohol.  The  consensus
 among  highway  safety  experts  is that well over fifty percent, and as
 many as eighty percent, of revoked drivers continue to drive while unli-
 censed.
  3. IIDs are designed to do two  things:  (1)  protect  the  public  by
 preventing drunk driving events; and (2) alter driver behavior to reduce
 recidivism. Numerous studies have shown IIDs to be overwhelmingly effec-
 tive on both counts:
  (a) Public safety. Between December 1, 2006 and December 31, 2020, IID
 installation  stopped  3.8 million drivers nationally from attempting to
 drive while legally intoxicated (.08+) and  foiled  an  additional  25.4
 million  drivers from attempting to drive after consuming enough alcohol
 to trigger the IID's set point.  Over the same time period in New York -
 even despite the poor compliance rate - IIDs prevented more than 111,000
 legally drunk drivers and  foiled  an  additional  439,427  attempts  by
 convicted drunk drivers who attempted to start a vehicle after consuming
 alcohol.
  (b)  Reduced recidivism. A 2016 University of Pennsylvania study found
 that alcohol-related fatalities decreased by 15% in states with  all-of-
 fender interlock laws. Similarly, a 2016 California study concluded that
 ignition  interlock  devices  are seventy-four percent more effective in
 reducing DWI recidivism than license suspension alone during  the  first
 six  months  after conviction and forty-five percent more effective over
 the course of a year.
  4. Given the empirical data that favors the use of the IID as a condi-
 tion of sentence, either in conjunction with or instead of license revo-
 cation, the legislature finds that New  York  has  fallen  significantly
 behind  other  states  that  utilize  IIDs  to promote public safety and
 support rehabilitative efforts.  Accordingly, the  legislature  declares
 that  to  further  advance public safety, New York must adopt best prac-
 tices consistent with the data for model use of the  ignition  interlock
 device as a proven method for saving lives and promoting rehabilitation.

 except as provided herein. For any such individual subject to a sentence
 of  probation,  installation  and maintenance of such ignition interlock
 device shall be a condition of probation.
  (b) Nothing contained in this section shall  prohibit  a  court,  upon
 application  by a probation department, from modifying the conditions of
 probation of any person convicted of any violation set  forth  in  para-
 graph  (a)  of  this  subdivision  prior  to  the effective date of this

 AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR SENTENCES IMPOSED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (G) OF
 SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-THREE OF THIS  ARTICLE,

 sentenced  to  a  period of probation or conditional discharge, provided
 the person has satisfied the minimum period of license revocation estab-
 lished by law and the commissioner has been notified  that  such  person

 ter during the license revocation period or deemed by a  court  to  have
 violated  any  condition of probation or conditional discharge set forth

 consumption  of  alcohol. In exercising discretion relating to the issu-
 ance of a post-revocation conditional license pursuant to this  subdivi-
 sion,  the  commissioner  shall not deny such issuance based solely upon
 the number of convictions for violations of any subdivision  of  section
 S. 4008--B  40

 the holder's employment requires the operation of a motor  vehicle  then
 during  the hours thereof, (3) [enroute] EN ROUTE to and from a class or
 course at an accredited school, college or  university  or  at  a  state
 approved  institution  of  vocational  or technical training, (4) to and

 office for the transaction of business relating to such license, (6) for
 a three hour consecutive daytime period, chosen by the department, on  a
 day  during  which the participant is not engaged in usual employment or
 vocation, (7) [enroute] EN ROUTE to and from a  medical  examination  or
 treatment  as part of a necessary medical treatment for such participant
 or member of the participant's household,  as  evidenced  by  a  written
 statement  to  that  effect  from  a  licensed medical practitioner, (8)
 [enroute] EN ROUTE to and from a  class  or  an  activity  which  is  an
 authorized  part  of  the alcohol and drug rehabilitation program and at
 which participant's attendance is required, and (9) [enroute]  EN  ROUTE
 to and from a place, including a school, at which a child or children of
 the  participant are cared for on a regular basis and which is necessary
 for the participant to maintain such participant's employment or enroll-
 ment at an accredited school,  college  or  university  or  at  a  state
 approved institution of vocational or technical training.
  (c) The post-revocation conditional license described in this subdivi-
 sion  may  be revoked by the commissioner for sufficient cause including
 but not limited to, failure to comply with the terms of the condition of
 probation or conditional discharge set forth by the court, conviction of
 any traffic offense other than one involving parking, stopping or stand-
 ing [or], conviction of any alcohol or drug related offense, misdemeanor
 or felony, ANY VIOLATION OF THIS ARTICLE WITH  RESPECT  TO  OPERATING  A
 MOTOR  VEHICLE  WITHOUT  A  FUNCTIONING  IGNITION  INTERLOCK DEVICE WHEN
 REQUIRED TO DO SO, or failure to install or  maintain  a  court  ordered
 ignition interlock device.
  (d)  Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the court from requiring,
 as a condition of probation or conditional discharge,  the  installation
 of a functioning ignition interlock device in any vehicle owned or oper-
 ated  by  a  person sentenced for a violation of subdivision two, two-a,
 [or] three OR FOUR-A of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this [chap-
 ter] ARTICLE, or any crime defined by this chapter or the penal  law  of
 which  an  alcohol-related  violation of any provision of section eleven
 hundred ninety-two of this [chapter] ARTICLE is an essential element, if
 the court in its discretion, determines that such a condition is  neces-
 sary  to  ensure  the public safety. Imposition of an ignition interlock
 condition shall in no way limit the effect  of  any  period  of  license
 suspension or revocation set forth by the commissioner or the court.
  (e) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the court from applying any
 other  conditions  of probation or conditional discharge allowed by law,
 including treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, restitution and community
 service.
 S. 4008--B  41
 
  (f) The commissioner shall note on the operator's record of any person
 restricted pursuant to this section  that,  in  addition  to  any  other
 restrictions,  conditions or limitations, such person may operate only a
 motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device.
  4.  Proof  of  compliance  and recording of condition.  (a) Following
 imposition by the court of the use of an ignition interlock device as  a
 condition PLEA, SENTENCE, of probation or conditional discharge it shall
 require  the  person to provide proof of compliance with this section to
 the court and the probation  department  or  other  monitor  where  such
 person is under probation or conditional discharge supervision.  A CLAIM
 BY  SUCH  PERSON  THAT  HE  OR  SHE HAS GOOD CAUSE FOR NOT INSTALLING AN
 IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE SHALL BE  MADE  TO  THE  COURT  AT  OR  BEFORE
 SENTENCING,  IN  WRITING IN THE FORM OF A SWORN AFFIDAVIT SIGNED BY SUCH
 PERSON ASSERTING UNDER OATH THAT: (1) HE OR SHE IS NOT THE REGISTERED OR
 TITLED OWNER OF ANY MOTOR VEHICLE AND WILL NOT OPERATE ANY MOTOR VEHICLE
 DURING THE PERIOD OF RESTRICTION; AND (2) THAT SUCH PERSON DOES NOT HAVE
 ACCESS TO THE VEHICLE OPERATED  BY  SUCH  PERSON  AT  THE  TIME  OF  THE
 VIOLATION  OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-TWO OF THIS ARTICLE; AND (C)
 THAT THE REGISTERED OWNER OF THAT VEHICLE OR ANY VEHICLE  REGISTERED  TO
 SUCH PERSON'S HOUSEHOLD WILL NOT GIVE CONSENT FOR THE INSTALLATION OF AN
 INTERLOCK  DEVICE  ON  HIS OR HER VEHICLE. THE AFFIDAVIT SHALL INCLUDE A
 STATEMENT REGARDING WHETHER SUCH PERSON OWNED ANY MOTOR VEHICLE  ON  THE
 DATE OF THE UNDERLYING VIOLATION OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-TWO OF
 THIS  ARTICLE  AND  WHETHER  OWNERSHIP OF ANY OF THOSE VEHICLES HAS BEEN
 TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER PARTY BY SALE, GIFT OR ANY OTHER MEANS SINCE  THE
 DATE  OF  SAID  VIOLATION.  THE AFFIDAVIT SHALL ALSO INCLUDE A STATEMENT
 FROM SUCH PERSON THAT HE OR SHE HAS NOT AND WILL NOT TRANSFER  OWNERSHIP
 OF  ANY  VEHICLE  TO EVADE INSTALLATION OF AN IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE,
 THE ADDRESS OF SUCH PERSON'S EMPLOYMENT, IF  APPLICABLE,  AND  HOW  SUCH
 PERSON  INTENDS  TO  TRAVEL  TO  THAT  LOCATION  DURING  THE  PERIOD  OF
 RESTRICTION. THE PERSON ALSO MAY INCLUDE ANY  OTHER  FACTS  AND  CIRCUM-
 STANCES  HE  OR  SHE BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT TO THE CLAIM OF GOOD CAUSE.
 THE COURT SHALL MAKE A FINDING WHETHER GOOD CAUSE EXISTS ON  THE  RECORD
 AND,  IF  GOOD CAUSE SHALL BE FOUND, ISSUE SUCH FINDING IN WRITING TO BE
 FILED BY SUCH PERSON WITH  THE  PROBATION  DEPARTMENT  OR  THE  IGNITION
 INTERLOCK  MONITOR,  AS  APPROPRIATE. IN THE EVENT THE COURT DENIES SUCH
 PERSON'S CLAIM OF GOOD CAUSE ON THE BASIS OF THE  AFFIDAVIT  FILED  WITH
 THE  COURT, SUCH PERSONS SHALL BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. SUCH
 PERSON SHALL ALSO BE PERMITTED TO WAIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD,  IF
 HE  OR  SHE  CHOOSES  TO  DO  SO.  If [the] A person SHALL BE ORDERED TO
 INSTALL AND MAINTAIN AN IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE, AND SUCH PERSON fails
 to provide for such proof of installation, absent a finding by the court
 of good cause for that failure which is entered in the record, the court
 may revoke, modify, or terminate the person's sentence of  probation  or
 conditional  discharge as provided under law.  [Good cause may include a
 finding that the person is not the owner of  a  motor  vehicle  if  such
 person asserts under oath that such person is not the owner of any motor
 vehicle and that he or she will not operate any motor vehicle during the
 period  of  interlock  restriction except as may be otherwise authorized
 pursuant to law.] "Owner" shall have the same  meaning  as  provided  in
 section one hundred twenty-eight of this chapter.
  (b) When a court imposes the condition specified in subdivision one of
 this  section, the court shall notify the commissioner in such manner as
 the commissioner may prescribe, and the  commissioner  shall  note  such
 condition  on  the operating record of the person subject to such condi-
 tions.
 S. 4008--B  42
 
  5. Cost, installation and maintenance.  (a) The cost of installing and
 maintaining the ignition interlock device shall be borne by  the  person
 subject  to  such  condition  unless the court determines such person is
 financially unable to afford  such  cost  whereupon  such  cost  may  be
 imposed  pursuant  to  a  payment plan or waived.  In the event of such
 waiver, the cost of the device shall be borne in accordance  with  regu-
 lations  issued under paragraph (g) of subdivision one of section eleven
 hundred ninety-three of this article or pursuant to such other agreement
 as may be entered into for provision of the device. Such cost  shall  be
 considered a fine for the purposes of subdivision five of section 420.10
 of  the  criminal  procedure law. Such cost shall not replace, but shall
 instead be in addition to, any fines, surcharges, or other costs imposed
 pursuant to this chapter or other applicable laws.

 responsible  for  the installation, calibration, and maintenance of such

 S. 4008--B  46
 
 part  F  of  chapter  58  of  the  laws  of 2012, are amended to read as
 follows:
  3.  Each  such  county  clerk shall retain from fees collected for any
 motor vehicle related service  described  in  subdivision  one  of  this
 section  processed  by such county clerk an amount based on a percentage
 of gross receipts collected. For purposes  of  this  section,  the  term
 "gross  receipts"  shall include all fines, fees and penalties collected
 pursuant to this chapter by a  county  clerk  acting  as  agent  of  the
 commissioner,  but shall not include any state or local sales or compen-
 sating use taxes imposed under or pursuant to the authority of  articles
 twenty-eight  and twenty-nine of the tax law and collected by such clerk
 on behalf of the commissioner of taxation  and  finance.  The  retention
 percentage  shall  be  [12.7] 10.75 percent [and shall take effect April
 first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine; provided,  however,  the  retention
 percentage  shall be thirty percent of the thirty dollar fee established
 in paragraph (e) of subdivision two of section four  hundred  ninety-one
 and  paragraph f-one of subdivision two of section five hundred three of
 this chapter].
  3-a. In addition to the fees retained pursuant to subdivision three of
 this section, each county clerk acting as the agent of the  commissioner

 A PERCENTAGE of  "enhanced  internet  and  electronic  partner  revenue"
 collected  by  the  commissioner.  For the purposes of this subdivision,

 during calendar year two thousand eleven]. The commissioner shall certi-
 fy the amounts to be retained by each  county  clerk  pursuant  to  this
 subdivision.  [Provided,  however,  that if the aggregate amount of fees
 retained by county clerks pursuant to this subdivision in calendar years
 two thousand twelve and two thousand thirteen combined  exceeds  eighty-
 eight million five hundred thousand dollars, then the percentage of fees
 to  be  retained  thereafter  shall  be reduced to a percentage that, if
 applied to the fees collected during calendar years two thousand  twelve
 and  two thousand thirteen combined, would have resulted in an aggregate
 retention of eighty-eight million five hundred thousand dollars  or  2.5

 hours in effect are everyday and/or twenty-four hours a day;  the  meter
 number  for a meter violation, where appropriate; and the date, time and
 particular place of  occurrence  of  the  charged  violation,  shall  be
 inserted  therein.  A mere listing of a meter number in cases of charged
 meter  violations  shall  not  be  deemed  to  constitute  a  sufficient
 description  of  a  particular  place of occurrence for purposes of this
 subdivision. The notice of violation shall be served upon the  owner  of
 the  motor  vehicle  if  the  operator  is not present, by affixing such
 notice to said vehicle in a conspicuous place. Whenever such  notice  is

 notice of violation, or a duplicate  thereof  by  affixation  as  herein
 provided  shall  have  the same force and effect and shall be subject to
 the same  penalties  for  disregard  thereof  as  though  the  same  was
 personally served with the name of the person charged with the violation
 inserted therein.

 due to the knowing fraud, false testimony, misrepresentation,  or  other
 misconduct,  or the knowing alteration of a notice of parking violation,
 by the person so charged or his or her  agent,  employee,  or  represen-
 tative.  Such  notice  shall  fix  a time when and place where a hearing
 shall be held before a hearing examiner  to  determine  whether  or  not
 dismissal of a charged parking violation shall be set aside. Such notice
 shall set forth the basis for setting aside the dismissal and advise the
 owner  that  failure  to  appear  at the date and time indicated in such
 notice shall be deemed an admission of liability and shall result in the
 setting aside of the dismissal and  entry  of  a  determination  on  the
 charged  parking  violation.  Such notice shall also contain a warning

  PART TT
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Suffolk county water quality restoration act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The county  of  Suffolk  ("county"),  with  a
 population  of  one million five hundred thousand persons, has in excess
 of three hundred eighty thousand  existing  onsite  wastewater  disposal
 systems,  comprised  mostly  of  cesspools  and septic systems, with two
 hundred nine thousand of these onsite systems in environmentally  sensi-
 S. 4008--B  91
 
 tive  areas which could benefit from nitrogen-reducing technologies. The
 United States Environmental Protection Agency recognizes Long Island  as
 having  a  sole  source  aquifer  system  for its drinking water supply.
 Suffolk  county  has  an  imminent  need to preserve this valuable water
 resource by reducing the amount of nitrogen discharged into the  ground-
 water  by onsite systems. The full water cycle is impacted by increasing
 quantities of nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, volatile organic contam-
 inants and saltwater intrusion, as well as a number of emerging  threats
 such as prescription drugs and sea level rise.
  The Suffolk county subwatersheds wastewater plan ("SWP"), certified by
 the  department  of  environmental  conservation  as  a  Nine  Elements
 Watershed (9E) plan, has documented  the  devastating  effects  of  high
 levels  of  nitrogen  pollution, not only on the drinking water quality,
 but  also  on  coastal  ecosystems,  dissolved  oxygen,  water  clarity,
 eelgrass,  wetlands,  shellfish,  coastal  resilience  and in triggering
 harmful algal blooms. The SWP, is a long-term plan to address  the  need
 for wastewater treatment infrastructure throughout the county comprehen-
 sively  over  a period of fifty years. The SWP delineates the source and
 concentration of nitrogen loading  in  one  hundred  ninety-one  subwat-
 ersheds  throughout the county, and establishes nitrogen reduction goals
 for each watershed.
  For many areas of the county, installing or connecting sewers is not a
 practical or cost-effective method  of  treating  wastewater.  For  that
 reason,  the  SWP  prescribes  a hybrid approach that relies on sewering
 where feasible, and the replacement of cesspools and septic systems with
 innovative/alternative onsite wastewater treatment systems. The  consol-
 idation  of  any  or  all of the twenty-seven county sewer districts, as
 well as unsewered areas of the county,  into  a  county-wide  wastewater
 management  district,  the  establishment of a water quality restoration
 fund, and a county board of trustees to monitor progress and  the  allo-
 cation of resources consistent with the goals of the SWP would allow for
 the  implementation  of  a  much  needed integrated long-term wastewater
 solution for the county through comprehensive planning and management to
 improve water quality.
  The purpose of this act is to create a water quality restoration  fund
 to finance projects for the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation
 of  groundwater  and  surface waters as recommended by the SWP. This act
 would allow the funding of projects that will mitigate wastewater pollu-
 tants utilizing the best available technology consistent with  the  SWP.
 The  water  quality  restoration fund would be financed with a dedicated
 and recurring revenue source by the enactment of an additional sales and
 compensating use tax at the rate of  one-eighth  of  one  percent  until
 2060.  Such tax would be enacted pursuant to a mandatory referendum.
  This  act  shall  also  provide  Suffolk  county with the authority to
 create a county-wide wastewater management district through the  consol-
 idation  of  existing  county  sewer  districts with currently unsewered
 areas of the county. A county-wide wastewater management  district  will
 provide  an  integrated  and  efficient  approach to managing wastewater
 services across the county; allow the county to enhance and  expand  its
 incentive  program to property owners to upgrade their wastewater treat-
 ment systems; to manage, monitor and enforce nitrogen reduction programs
 throughout the county; complete  additional  sewer  extension  projects;
 improve  the  economic wellbeing of communities; and provide an opportu-
 nity to consolidate and streamline the county's existing sewer  district
 system  and  normalize  the  inequitable  rate  structure  that has long
 existed.
 S. 4008--B  92
 
  In addition, this act will extend  the  existing  one-quarter  of  one
 percent  sales  tax  utilized  to  finance  the  county  drinking  water
 protection program until 2060.
  §  3.  The county law is amended by adding a new section 256-b to read

 relating  to a maximum rate shall be calculated without reference to the
 additional  sales  and  compensating  use  tax  herein  authorized.  For

 deposited  in one or more of the banks or trust companies designated, in
 the manner provided by law, as a depository of the funds of such county.
 Pending expenditure from such fund, moneys therein may  be  invested  in
 the  manner provided in section eleven of the general municipal law. Any
 interest earned or capital gain realized on the moneys so  deposited  or

 provision  to  the  contrary,  moneys  in  said fund which have not been
 appropriated from and transferred to or expended in any fiscal year  for
 the  purposes of making payments pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of
 this section, may alternatively be  appropriated  for  the  purposes  of
 paying debt service on any new indebtedness incurred after the effective
 date  of  the  chapter of the laws of two thousand one that enacted this
 paragraph pursuant to the local finance law in order to  effectuate  the
 purposes described in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this subdivision. For the
 purpose  of  allocating  moneys in said fund pursuant to local law among
 the purposes described in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)  of  this
 subdivision,  moneys  applied  to  the payment of debt service under the
 authority of the previous sentence shall be considered by said county to

 § 75-0121. CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM; ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCES.
  1.  CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM. A. THERE IS HEREBY CREATED AN ECONOMY-WIDE
 CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM TO ENSURE THE SATISFACTION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF
 SECTIONS  75-0107  AND  75-0109  OF  THIS  ARTICLE  THROUGH  EMISSIONS
 REDUCTIONS  METHODS  ADOPTED  AND  IMPLEMENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE
 AUTHORITY.  THE DEPARTMENT  AND  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL  UNDERTAKE  SUCH
 ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION SO AS TO PROVIDE FOR THE PROGRAM TO BEGIN AS
 OF THE START OF THE FIRST COMPLIANCE PERIOD.  THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM
 SHALL  BE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT, INCLUDING AT LEAST THREE
 PUBLIC HEARINGS, AND SHALL INCLUDE  SUBSTANTIAL  CONSULTATION  WITH  THE
 CLIMATE JUSTICE WORKING GROUP AND MEMBERS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.
  B.  THE  CAP  AND  INVEST PROGRAM SHALL PROVIDE FOR ANNUALLY DECLINING
 AGGREGATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS BY SETTING A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE
 AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM ALL  COVERED  SOURCES  REGULATED
 UNDER  THE  CAP  AND  INVEST PROGRAM IN A GIVEN COMPLIANCE PERIOD.  SUCH
 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS MAY BE REFERRED TO HEREIN AS A CAP.
  C. A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES SHALL BE CREATED BY  THE  DEPARTMENT
 TO  BE  TRANSFERRED TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION ACCOUNT SO
 AS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE BY THE  AUTHORITY  TO  COVERED  SOURCES  IN  THE
 MANNER  SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION AND SUBDIVISION TWENTY-FIVE OF SECTION
 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES LAW.  THE  TOTAL
 NUMBER  OF ALLOWANCES CREATED AND TRANSFERRED SO AS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE
 FOR AUCTION OR SALE BY THE AUTHORITY IN A COMPLIANCE PERIOD SHALL IN  NO
 EVENT EXCEED THE CAP FOR SUCH COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
  D. ALL COVERED SOURCES MUST REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN A FORM AND
 MANNER  TO  BE PRESCRIBED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO SUCH

 TIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BY  ESTABLISHING  MAXIMUM  ALLOWABLE
 GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSIONS LIMITS FOR ALL INDIVIDUAL SOURCES LOCATED IN,
 OR CONTRIBUTING TO POLLUTION BURDEN IN, A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. MAXI-
 MUM ALLOWABLE GREENHOUSE GAS  EMISSIONS  LIMITS  ON  INDIVIDUAL  SOURCES
 SHALL DECLINE ANNUALLY AT A RATE WHICH IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE DECLINE OF
 THE CAP. SUCH EMISSIONS LIMITS SHALL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THAT DISAD-
 VANTAGED  COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE POLLUTION REDUCTIONS AT RATES COMMENSU-
 RATE WITH POLLUTION REDUCTION IN OTHER COMMUNITIES AS A  RESULT  OF  THE
 CAP  AND  INVEST  PROGRAM,  AND  ARE  NOT  DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY
 AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM  IN  COMPLIANCE  WITH
 PARAGRAPH  C  OF  SUBDIVISION  THREE OF SECTION 75-0109 OF THIS ARTICLE,
 TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF  SUCH  COMMUNITIES  AND  SUCH
 SOURCES.  THE  DEPARTMENT  MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES FOR SOURCES
 S. 4008--B  113
 
 LOCATED IN, OR CONTRIBUTING TO  POLLUTION  BURDEN  IN,  A  DISADVANTAGED
 COMMUNITY,  THAN  WOULD  OTHERWISE  BE REQUIRED UNDER THE CAP AND INVEST
 PROGRAM.
  F.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS
 COVERED SOURCES FOR WHICH REGULATION UNDER THE CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM IS

 EOF  IN  THE MANNER SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE AND IN SUBDIVISION TWENTY-
 FIVE OF SECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY-FOUR OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES LAW.
  3. ENERGY-INTENSIVE AND TRADE-EXPOSED FACILITIES.  A.  THE  DEPARTMENT
 SHALL  ADOPT  REGULATIONS THAT ESTABLISH CRITERIA AND METHODS FOR DETER-
 MINING BOTH ENERGY INTENSITY AND TRADE EXPOSURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDEN-
 TIFYING FACILITIES WHICH MAY BE VULNERABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE  CAP  AND
 INVEST  PROGRAM  SUCH  THAT  THEY MAY BE DESIGNATED AS EITES IN A MANNER
 WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TREATMENT OF EITES  IN  THE  SCOPING  PLAN,
 INCLUDING  APPENDIX C THEREOF. THE PROCEEDINGS FOR SUCH REGULATIONS MUST
 INCLUDE PUBLIC  HEARINGS AND OTHER EFFORTS  TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL OPPOR-
 TUNITIES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT FROM ALL PERSONS WHO WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE
 PLAN, INCLUDING PERSONS WORKING FOR EITES AND PERSONS LIVING  IN  DISAD-
 VANTAGED  COMMUNITIES. SUCH REGULATIONS SHALL BE DEVELOPED IN COMPLIANCE
 WITH SUBPARAGRAPHS (I) THROUGH (IV) OF PARAGRAPH B OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  B. SUCH REGULATIONS SHALL:
  (I) IDENTIFY A PROCEDURE FOR SUCH FACILITIES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT  THEY
 ARE USING THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES;
  (II)  CONSIDER  HOW  PROGRAM  DESIGN  CAN FURTHER MITIGATE THE COST OF
 REDUCING EMISSIONS FOR SUCH FACILITIES WHILE PROVIDING AN  INCENTIVE  TO
 IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE EMISSIONS;
  (III)  INCORPORATE  CO-POLLUTANT  REDUCTION  MEASURES  OR  MITIGATION
 REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH FACILITIES LOCATED IN OR CONTRIBUTING TO A CO-POL-

  C. UPON A SHOWING BY AN EITE SATISFACTORY TO THE DEPARTMENT  THAT  THE
 EITE  WILL  BE  SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMPLIANCE WITH THE
 CAP AND INVEST PROGRAM SO AS TO RESULT IN LEAKAGE,  THE  DEPARTMENT  AND
 THE AUTHORITY MAY, IN A MANNER NOT INCONSISTENT WITH ANY OTHER PROVISION
 OF THIS ARTICLE OR THE SCOPING PLAN, PROVIDE FOR ALLOWANCES TO INITIALLY
 BE ISSUED TO ELIGIBLE EITES AT REDUCED COST.  THE AMOUNT OF SUCH REDUCED
 COST  SHALL  BE  THAT  AMOUNT WHICH IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT LEAKAGE WITH
 RESPECT TO THE FACILITY, AS DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT,  IN  CONSULTA-
 TION  WITH  THE  AUTHORITY  AND  THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT,
 ASSUMING THE EITE EMPLOYS  BEST  AVAILABLE  TECHNOLOGY.  FOR  THE  FIRST
 COMPLIANCE  PERIOD,  ANY  ALLOWANCES  ISSUED  TO AN EITE AT REDUCED COST
 S. 4008--B  114

 SHALL NOT REPRESENT MORE THAN THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF ALLOWANCES NECESSARY
 TO AUTHORIZE THE EITE TO EMIT AN AMOUNT  OF  CARBON  DIOXIDE  EQUIVALENT
 EMISSIONS  EQUAL  TO THE EITE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT
 EMISSIONS  FOR  THE  YEARS TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-TWO, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-
 THREE, AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, AS DETERMINED  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT,
 ADJUSTED  DOWNWARD  AS  NECESSARY  TO  AN  AMOUNT WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE
 REQUIREMENT  THAT THE EITE EMPLOYS BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY  TO  REDUCE
 ITS  EMISSIONS.  IN  SUBSEQUENT  COMPLIANCE PERIODS, ANY ALLOCATION TO
 EITES OF ALLOWANCES AT REDUCED COST SHALL DECLINE IN PROPORTION  TO  THE
 REDUCTION  IN  TOTAL  AVAILABLE ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH COMPLIANCE PERIOD IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAP FOR SUCH COMPLIANCE PERIOD.  IN NO  EVENT  SHALL
 AN  EITE  BE  ISSUED AN ALLOWANCE AT REDUCED COST FOR AN AMOUNT WHICH IS
 LESS THAN THE AMOUNT PAID BY THE EITE FOR A REDUCED  COST  ALLOWANCE  IN
 THE PREVIOUS COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
  D.  IN  NO  EVENT SHALL EITES RECEIVE ALLOWANCES AT REDUCED COST AFTER
 THE TENTH COMPLIANCE PERIOD.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL CEASE THE ISSUANCE OF
 ALLOWANCES TO EITES AT REDUCED COST IF IT DETERMINES THAT:
  (I) ISSUANCE OF ALLOWANCES AT REDUCED COST TO AN  EITE  IS  NO  LONGER
 NECESSARY TO LIMIT LEAKAGE;
  (II) THE EITE IS NOT EMPLOYING BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY;
  (III)  THE  EITE  IS  LOCATED  WITHIN  A  DISADVANTAGED  COMMUNITY, OR
 CONTRIBUTES TO THE POLLUTION BURDEN OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY, AND  THE
 EITE'S  CO-POLLUTANT  EMISSIONS  HAVE INCREASED RELATIVE TO THE PREVIOUS
 COMPLIANCE PERIOD;
  (IV) THE EITE NO LONGER QUALIFIES AS AN EITE; OR
  (V) THE EITE MADE MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS ON ITS APPLICATION, OR  MATE-
 RIALLY  VIOLATED  (A) THE TERMS OF ANY APPROVAL OF SUCH APPLICATION, (B)
 ANY AGREEMENT IN RESPECT THEREOF OR (C) ANY  LAW,  RULE,  OR  REGULATION

 PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH E OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION.
  E. IF THE ACTUAL GREENHOUSE GAS EQUIVALENT EMISSIONS OF AN EITE EXCEED
 THE  ALLOWANCES  ISSUED  TO  AN EITE AT REDUCED COST FOR THAT COMPLIANCE
 PERIOD, SUCH EITE MUST ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL  ALLOWANCES  AND  SUBMIT  SUCH
 ALLOWANCES AS NECESSARY TO SATISFY ITS COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION DURING SUCH
 COMPLIANCE PERIOD.
  F.  IF  THE DEPARTMENT ISSUES ALLOWANCES TO EITES AT REDUCED COST, THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL:
  (I) CONDUCT REGULAR AUDITS OF SUCH EITES  TO  DETERMINE  WHETHER  SUCH
 EITES CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS EITES FOR PURPOSES OF RECEIVING FREE ALLOW-
 ANCES UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION; AND
  (II) REGULARLY REVIEW THE NEED TO ISSUE ALLOWANCES TO EITES AT REDUCED
 COST.
  G.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL CREATE A PUBLIC DATABASE ONLINE AND REPORT TO
 THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE, ON THE EMISSIONS AND LOCATION  OF  ANY
 EITE.
  H.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANYTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION TO THE CONTRARY, THE
 TOTAL NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES ISSUED AT REDUCED COST FOR A COMPLIANCE PERI-
 OD SHALL NOT EXCEED FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE ALLOWANCES FOR  SUCH  COMPLI-
 ANCE  PERIOD.  TO THE EXTENT THIS PARAGRAPH LIMITS THE NUMBER OF REDUCED
 COST ALLOWANCES OTHERWISE ALLOCATED TO EITES PURSUANT TO  THIS  SUBDIVI-
 SION,  ALLOCATIONS OF REDUCED COST ALLOWANCES SHALL BE REDUCED AS NECES-
 SARY IN A MANNER TO BE DETERMINED  APPROPRIATE  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT,  IN
 CONSULTATION WITH THE AUTHORITY.

  5. ALLOWANCE RESERVE. THE DEPARTMENT MAY RESERVE A  SMALL  PORTION  OF
 ALLOWANCES  UNDER THE CAP FOR PURPOSES OF MARKET STABILITY AND TO INCEN-
 TIVIZE ADDITIONAL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS SO LONG AS  SUCH  ALLOWANCES  ARE
 NOT  IN ADDITION TO THE TOTAL ALLOWANCES UNDER THE CAP.  SUCH ALLOWANCES
 MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSIONS  REDUCTION  ACCOUNT
 UPON  NOTICE  TO THE DEPARTMENT BY THE AUTHORITY AT SUCH TIMES AS DEEMED
 NECESSARY BY THE AUTHORITY. SUCH RESERVE ALLOWANCES MAY BE AUCTIONED  OR
 SOLD  IN A MANNER AND AT A TIME DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE AUTHORITY.
 SUCH RESERVE ALLOWANCES SHALL BE AUCTIONED OR SOLD FOR A PRICE WHICH  IS
 EQUAL  TO  OR  GREATER  THAN THE MAXIMUM ALLOWANCE PRICE PROVIDED FOR IN
 SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION 75-0125 OF THIS ARTICLE.
 § 75-0123. USE OF ALLOWANCES.
  1. ALLOWANCES MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE FULL  AMOUNT

 PROGRESS,  ABILITY,  OR  LIKELIHOOD OF MEETING OR EXCEEDING THE REQUIRE-
 MENTS OF THIS ARTICLE;
  B. THAT CREDIT FOR  GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSIONS  REDUCTIONS  UNDER  ONE
 PROGRAM  SHALL  NOT REDUCE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE OTHER JURISDIC-
 TIONAL PROGRAM MORE THAN AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF  GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMIS-
 SIONS REDUCTIONS IN SUCH PROGRAM; AND
  C. SUCH LINKAGE WILL NOT RESULT IN INCREASED CO-POLLUTANT EMISSIONS IN
 DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.
  4.  IF  THE  DEPARTMENT  DETERMINES  THAT LINKAGE WITH ANOTHER SIMILAR
 PROGRAM MADE PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION NO LONGER MEETS
 THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH A OF SUCH SUBDIVISION AND  PARA-

 enabling the reverse vending machine to accept containers from redeemers
 and  to issue a scrip or receipt for their refund value. SUCH DEFINITION
 SHALL ALSO APPLY TO ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY APPROVED BY THE  COMMISSIONER
 PURSUANT  TO  SUBPARAGRAPH  (III) OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 SECTION 27-1007 OF THIS TITLE.
  14. "STATE-SPECIFIC UPC CODE" MEANS A UNIVERSAL PRODUCT CODE AND LABEL

 § 27-1007. Mandatory acceptance.
  Except as provided in section 27-1009 of this title:
  1. (a) A dealer shall accept at his or her place of  business  from  a
 redeemer  any  empty  beverage  containers  of  the design, shape, size,
 color, composition and brand sold or offered for sale by the dealer, and
 shall pay to the  redeemer  the  refund  value  of  each  such  beverage
 container  as  established in section 27-1005 of this title. Redemptions
 of refund value must be in legal tender, or a scrip or  receipt  from  a
 reverse  vending  machine,  provided  that  the  scrip or receipt can be
 exchanged for legal tender for a period of  not  less  than  sixty  days
 without  requiring the purchase of other goods.  IN THE EVENT SUCH SCRIP
 OR RECEIPT EXPIRES, SUCH SCRIP OR RECEIPT MUST INDICATE  ANY  EXPIRATION
 DATE  AND  THE  DEALER  MUST POST A CONSPICUOUS SIGN INDICATING HOW MANY
 DAYS A REDEEMER HAS TO EXCHANGE THE SCRIP OR RECEIPT FOR  LEGAL  TENDER.
 IF  SUCH  NOTIFICATION  IS  NOT  PROVIDED, A DEALER MUST REDEEM THE FULL
 REFUND VALUE INDICATED ON ANY LEGIBLE SCRIP OR RECEIPT. The use or pres-
 ence of a reverse vending machine shall not  relieve  a  dealer  of  any
 obligations  imposed  pursuant  to  this section. If a dealer utilizes a
 reverse vending machine to redeem containers, the dealer  shall  provide
 redemption  of  beverage  containers when the reverse vending machine is
 S. 4008--B  136
 
 full, broken, under repair  or  does  not  accept  a  type  of  beverage
 container  sold or offered for sale by such dealer and may not limit the
 hours or days of redemption except as provided by subdivision  three  of
 this section.
  (b)  Beginning  March first, two thousand ten, a dealer whose place of
 business is part of a chain engaged in the same general field  of  busi-
 ness  which operates ten or more units in this state under common owner-
 ship and whose business has at least: (i) forty thousand but  less  than
 sixty  thousand  square  feet  devoted to the display of merchandise for
 sale to the public shall install and maintain at least two reverse vend-
 ing machines at the dealer's place of business; (ii) sixty thousand  but
 less  than  eighty-five  thousand  square feet devoted to the display of
 merchandise for sale to the public shall install and maintain  at  least
 three  reverse  vending  machines  at the dealer's place of business; or
 (iii) eighty-five  thousand  square  feet  devoted  to  the  display  of
 merchandise  for  sale to the public shall install and maintain at least
 four reverse vending machines at the dealer's  place  of  business.  The
 requirements of [paragraph (b) of] this subdivision to install and main-
 tain  reverse  vending  machines  shall  not apply to a dealer that: (i)
 sells only beverage containers of  twenty  ounces  or  less  where  such
 beverage  containers  are  packaged  in  quantities fewer than six; (ii)
 sells beverage containers and devotes no more than five percent  of  its
 floor  space to the display and sale of consumer commodities, as defined
 in section two hundred fourteen-h of the agriculture and markets law; or
 (iii) obtains a waiver from  the  commissioner  authorizing  dealers  to
 provide consumers with an alternative technology that: (A) determines if
 the  container  is  redeemable,  (B)  provides protections against fraud
 through a system that validates each container redeemed by  reading  the
 universal  product  code and, except with respect to refillable contain-
 ers, renders the container  unredeemable,  (C)  accumulates  information
 regarding  containers redeemed, and (D) issues legal tender, or a scrip,
 receipt, or other form of credit for  the  refund  value,  that  can  be
 exchanged  for  legal  tender  for  a period of not less than sixty days
 without requiring the purchase of other goods AND INCLUDES  ANY  EXPIRA-
 TION  DATE ON THE SCRIP, RECEIPT, OR OTHER FORM OF CREDIT. Notwithstand-
 ing the foregoing, if the alternative technology does not allow  consum-
 ers  to immediately obtain the refund value of the redeemed container, a
 dealer shall be permitted to deploy such alternative technology only  if
 it  also offers an alternative that allows consumers to conveniently and
 immediately obtain such refund value through a reverse  vending  machine
 or other alternative method.
  (c) A dealer to which paragraph (b) of this subdivision does not apply
 and whose place of business is at least forty thousand square feet which
 does  not  utilize  reverse  vending  machines to process empty beverage
 containers for redemption shall: (i) establish and maintain a  dedicated
 area  within such business to accept beverage containers for redemption;
 (ii) adequately staff such area to facilitate efficient  acceptance  and
 processing  of such containers during business hours; and (iii) post one
 or more conspicuous signs conforming to the size and color  requirements
 described  in subdivision two of this section at each public entrance to
 the business which describes where in the business the  redemption  area
 is  located.  The  commissioner  may  establish in rules and regulations
 additional standards for the efficient processing of beverage containers
 by such dealers.
  (d) For the purposes of this subdivision on any day that a  dealer  is
 open  for less than twenty-four hours, the dealer may restrict or refuse
 S. 4008--B  137
 
 the payment of refund values during the first and last hour  the  dealer
 is open for business.
  2.  A dealer shall post a conspicuous sign, at the point of sale, that
 states:
  "NEW YORK BOTTLE BILL OF RIGHTS
 
  STATE LAW REQUIRES US TO REDEEM EMPTY RETURNABLE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS OF
  THE SAME TYPE AND BRAND THAT WE SELL OR OFFER FOR SALE
 
 YOU HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS UNDER THE NEW YORK  STATE  RETURNABLE  CONTAINER
 ACT:
  THE  RIGHT  to  return your empties for refund to any dealer who sells
 the same brand, type and size, whether you bought the beverage from  the
 dealer  or  not.  It is illegal to return containers for refund that you
 did not pay a deposit on in New York state.
  THE RIGHT to get  your  deposit  refund  in  cash,  without  proof  of
 purchase.
  THE  RIGHT  to  return  your empties any day, any hour, except for the
 first and last hour of the dealer's business day (empty  containers  may
 be redeemed at any time in 24-hour stores).
  THE  RIGHT  to  return  your  containers if they are empty and intact.
 Washing containers is not required by law, but is  strongly  recommended
 to maintain sanitary conditions.
  The New York state returnable container act can be enforced by the New
 York  state department of environmental conservation, the New York state
 department of agriculture and markets, the New York state department  of
 taxation and finance, the New York state attorney general and/or by your
 local government."
  Such  sign must be no less than eight inches by ten inches in size and
 have lettering a minimum of one quarter inch high, and of a color  which
 contrasts with the background. The department shall maintain a toll free
 telephone number for a "bottle bill complaint line" that shall be avail-
 able from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each business day to receive reports of
 violations  of  this  title. The telephone number shall be listed on any
 sign required by this section.
  3. On or after June first, two thousand nine, a dealer may  limit  the
 number of empty beverage containers to be accepted for redemption at the
 dealer's  place  of  business to no less than seventy-two containers per
 visit, per redeemer, per day, provided that:
  (a) The dealer has a written agreement with a redemption center, be it
 either at a fixed physical location within the same  county  and  within
 [one-half]  ONE  mile  of  the  dealer's  place of business, or a mobile
 redemption center, operated by a  redemption  center,  that  is  located
 within  one-quarter  mile of the dealer's place of business. The redemp-
 tion center must have a written agreement  with  the  dealer  to  accept
 containers on behalf of the dealer; and the redemption center's hours of
 operation  must  cover  at least 9:00 a.m. through 7:00 p.m. daily or in
 the case of a mobile redemption center,  the  hours  of  operation  must
 cover  at  least  four consecutive hours between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.
 daily. The dealer must post a conspicuous, permanent sign,  meeting  the
 size  and  color  specifications  set  forth  in subdivision two of this
 section, open to public view, identifying  the  location  and  hours  of
 operation  of  the  affiliated  redemption  center  or mobile redemption
 center; and
  (b) The dealer provides, at a minimum, a consecutive two  hour  period
 between  7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. daily whereby the dealer will accept up
 S. 4008--B  138
 
 to two hundred forty containers, per redeemer,  per  day,  and  posts  a
 conspicuous,  permanent  sign, meeting the size and color specifications
 set forth in subdivision two of this section, open to public view, iden-
 tifying  those  hours. The dealer may not change the hours of redemption
 without first posting a thirty day notice; and
  (c) The dealer's primary business is the sale of food or beverages for
 consumption off-premises, and the dealer's place  of  business  is  less
 than ten thousand square feet in size.
  4.  A  deposit  initiator  shall accept from a dealer or operator of a
 redemption center any empty beverage container  of  the  design,  shape,
 size,  color,  composition  and  brand  sold  or offered for sale by the
 deposit initiator, and shall pay the dealer or operator of a  redemption
 center  the  refund value of each such beverage container as established
 by section 27-1005 of this title. A deposit initiator shall  accept  and
 redeem  all  such  empty beverage containers from a dealer or redemption
 center without limitation on quantity.
  5. A deposit initiator's or distributor's failure  to  pick  up  empty
 beverage containers, including containers processed in a reverse vending
 machine,  from  a redemption center, dealer or the operator of a reverse
 vending machine, IN A TIMELY MANNER AND AT REASONABLE TIMES AS  PROVIDED
 BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  PURSUANT TO THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO
 PARAGRAPH (C) OF SUBDIVISION EIGHT OF THIS SECTION shall be a  violation
 of this title.
  6.  In  addition to the refund value of a beverage container as estab-
 lished by section 27-1005 of this title, a deposit initiator  shall  pay
 to any dealer or operator of a redemption center a handling fee of three
 and  one-half  cents for each beverage container accepted by the deposit
 initiator from such dealer or operator of a redemption center.  BEGIN-
 NING  APRIL FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX, THE HANDLING FEE WILL BE SIX
 CENTS. Payment of the handling fee shall be as compensation for collect-
 ing, sorting and packaging of empty beverage  containers  for  transport
 back  to  the deposit initiator or its designee. Payment of the handling
 fee may not be conditioned on the purchase of any goods or services, nor
 may such payment be made out of the  refund  value  account  established
 pursuant  to  section  27-1012 of this title. A distributor who does not
 initiate deposits on a type of beverage container is considered a dealer
 only for the purpose of receiving a handling fee from a  deposit  initi-
 ator.
  7.  A deposit initiator on a brand shall accept from a distributor who
 does not initiate deposits on that brand any empty  beverage  containers
 of that brand accepted by the distributor from a dealer or operator of a
 redemption  center  and shall reimburse the distributor the refund value
 of each such beverage container, as established by  section  27-1005  of
 this  title.  In  addition,  the  deposit initiator shall reimburse such
 distributor for each such beverage container  the  handling  fee  estab-
 lished  under  subdivision  six  of  this  section. Without limiting the
 rights of the department or any person, firm or corporation  under  this
 subdivision  or any other provision of this section, a distributor shall
 have a civil right of action to  enforce  this  subdivision,  including,
 upon three days notice, the right to apply for temporary and preliminary
 injunctive  relief against continuing violations, and until arrangements
 for collection and return of empty containers or reimbursement  of  such
 distributor for such deposits and handling fees are made.
  8. It shall be the responsibility of the deposit initiator or distrib-
 utor  to provide to a dealer or redemption center a sufficient number of
 bags, cartons, or other suitable containers, at no cost, for the packag-
 S. 4008--B  139
 
 ing, handling and pickup of  empty  beverage  containers  that  are  not
 redeemed  through  a  reverse  vending  machine.  The  bags, cartons, or
 containers must be provided by the deposit initiator or distributor on a
 schedule  that allows the dealer or redemption center sufficient time to
 sort the empty beverage containers prior  to  pick  up  by  the  deposit
 initiator or distributor. In addition:
  (a)  When picking up empty beverage containers, a deposit initiator or
 distributor shall not require a dealer  or  redemption  center  to  load
 their  own  bags,  cartons or containers onto or into the deposit initi-
 ator's or distributor's vehicle or vehicles  or  provide  the  staff  or
 equipment  needed  to  do  so.  HOWEVER,  WHERE  PALLETS OR SKIDS, BAGS,
 CARTONS OR CONTAINERS ARE READILY MOVABLE ONLY BY MEANS OF A FORKLIFT OR
 SIMILAR EQUIPMENT, A DEPOSIT INITIATOR  OR  DISTRIBUTOR  MAY  REQUIRE  A
 DEALER  OR REDEMPTION CENTER TO MOVE OR LOAD SUCH ITEMS AT NO COST USING
 A FORKLIFT OR SIMILAR EQUIPMENT BELONGING TO THE  DEALER  OR  REDEMPTION
 CENTER  PROVIDED  THAT  SUCH EQUIPMENT AND APPROPRIATE STAFF ARE READILY
 AVAILABLE.
  (b) A  deposit  initiator  or  distributor  shall  not  require  empty
 containers  to be counted at a location other than the redemption center
 or dealer's place of business. The dealer  or  redemption  center  shall
 have the right to be present at the count. IN THE EVENT OF A DISCREPANCY
 BETWEEN  THE  COUNT  OF THE DEALER OR REDEMPTION CENTER AND THE COUNT OF
 THE DEPOSIT  INITIATOR  OR  DISTRIBUTOR  FOR  CONTAINERS  NOT  PROCESSED
 THROUGH  A  REVERSE  VENDING  MACHINE ALL SUCH EMPTY CONTAINERS SHALL BE
 RETAINED AND A RE-COUNT MAY BE REQUESTED. THE RE-COUNT MAY BE HELD AT  A
 LOCATION  OTHER THAN THE REDEMPTION CENTER OR DEALER'S PLACE OF BUSINESS
 ONLY IF THE DEALER OR REDEMPTION CENTER AGREES AND IS PRESENT.
  (c) A deposit initiator or distributor shall pick  up  empty  beverage
 containers  from  the dealer or redemption center IN A TIMELY MANNER AND
 at reasonable times [and intervals] as  determined  in  rules  or  regu-
 lations  promulgated  by  the  department NO LATER THAN APRIL FIRST, TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX.
  9. No person shall return or assist another to return to a  dealer  or
 redemption  center  an  empty beverage container for its refund value if
 such container had previously been accepted for redemption by a  dealer,
 redemption center, or deposit initiator who initiates deposits on bever-
 age containers of the same brand.
  10.  A  redeemer,  dealer,  distributor or redemption center shall not
 knowingly redeem an empty beverage container  on  which  a  deposit  was
 never paid in New York state.
  11.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  two of section
 27-1009 of this title, a deposit initiator or distributor  shall  accept
 and  redeem beverage containers as provided in this title, if the dealer
 or operator of a redemption center shall  have  accepted  and  paid  the
 refund value of such beverage containers.
  12. No person shall intentionally program, tamper with, render inaccu-
 rate, or circumvent the proper operation of a reverse vending machine to
 wrongfully  elicit  deposit  monies  when  no valid, redeemable beverage
 container has been placed in and properly processed by the reverse vend-
 ing machine.
  13. THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT  OF  TAXATION  AND  FINANCE  ARE
 AUTHORIZED TO AUDIT ANY REVERSE VENDING MACHINE.

 BLE FOR THE BOTTLER TO ACHIEVE THE SPECIFIED PERCENT REQUIREMENT.

 required to be filed. The  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  may
 require  that  the payments be made electronically. The remaining twenty

 been fully complied with, each  deposit  initiator  shall  pay  to  such
 commissioner  at  such  time,  in  lieu  of  the amount described in the
 preceding sentence, an amount equal to the balance which would have been

 The  commissioner  of taxation and finance may require that the payments
 be made electronically.
  §  8. Subdivision 12 of section 27-1012 of the environmental conserva-
 tion law, as amended by section 6 of part F of chapter 58 of the laws of

 or redemption of beverage containers on which no deposit was initiated.
  c. A bottler or deposit initiator shall notify the  department,  in  a
 form  prescribed  by  the  department,  whenever a beverage container or
 beverage container label is revised by altering  the  universal  product

  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "climate
 change superfund act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature finds and declares the
 following:
  1. Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion  of  fossil
 fuels,  is  an immediate, grave threat to the state's communities, envi-
 ronment, and economy. In addition to mitigating the further  buildup  of
 greenhouse  gases, the state must take action to adapt to certain conse-
 quences of climate change that are irreversible,  including  rising  sea
 levels,  increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, heat
 waves, toxic  algal  blooms  and  other  climate-change-driven  threats.
 Maintaining New York's quality of life into the future, particularly for
 young  people,  who  will experience greater impacts from climate change
 over their lifetimes, will be one of  the  state's  greatest  challenges
 over  the  next  three  decades.  Meeting  that challenge will require a
 shared commitment of purpose and huge investments  in  new  or  upgraded
 infrastructure and the transition to a green economy.
 S. 4008--B  143
 
  2.  New  York has previously adopted programs now in place - the inac-
 tive hazardous waste disposal site (state superfund) program and the oil
 spill fund - to remediate environmental damage to lands and waters based
 on the principle that, where  possible,  the  entities  responsible  for
 environmental  damage  should  pay  for  its cleanup. No similar program
 exists yet for the pollution of the atmosphere by greenhouse gas buildup
 as a result of burning fossil fuels.
  3. Based on decades of research it is now possible to  determine  with
 great  accuracy  the  share of greenhouse gases released into the atmos-
 phere by specific fossil fuel companies over the last 70 years or  more,
 making  it possible to assign liability to and require compensation from
 companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time period.
  4. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a  climate  change
 cost  recovery program that will require companies that have contributed
 significantly to the buildup of climate change-driving greenhouse  gases
 in  the  atmosphere to bear a proportionate share of the cost of invest-
 ments required to address the impacts of  climate  change  in  New  York
 state.
  5.  a.  The obligation to pay under the program is based on the fossil
 fuel companies' historic contribution to the buildup of greenhouse gases
 that is largely responsible for climate  change.  The  program  operates
 under a standard of strict liability; companies are required to pay into
 the  fund  because  the  use  of their products caused the pollution. No
 finding of wrongdoing is required.
  b. Nonetheless, the legislature recognizes that the actions of many of
 the biggest fossil fuel  companies  have  been  unconscionable,  closely
 reflecting  the  strategy  of  denial, deflection, and delay used by the
 tobacco industry. In spite of the  information  provided  by  their  own
 scientists  that  the  continued  burning  of  fossil  fuels  would have
 catastrophic results, these companies hid the truth from the public  and
 actively spread false information that the science of climate change was
 uncertain  when  in  fact  it was beyond controversy. This breach of the
 public trust was breathtaking in its  scope  and  consequences,  and  it
 continues to this day.
  c. Since 2022, the fossil fuel industry has taken advantage of several
 overlapping  global crises to earn immense profits, charging record high
 prices while aggressively rejecting any responsibility for the costs  of
 its  business activities. While all the profits accrue to the companies,
 all of the costs of climate change are paid by  taxpayers  and  individ-
 uals. This is a market failure that needs to be addressed through policy
 change.
  6.  Payments  by  historical  polluters would be used to build climate
 resiliency through new or upgraded infrastructure assets, to help socie-
 ty adapt by supporting the transition to a clean energy economy, and  to
 compensate  individuals  and  businesses  for  losses related to climate
 change and the costs associated with the need to  transition  away  from
 the  fossil fuels which have contributed to climate change, all of which
 are necessary to protect the public safety and welfare in  the  face  of
 the  growing  impacts of climate change. At least 35%, with a goal of at
 least 40% of the overall benefits of  program  spending  would  directly
 benefit disadvantaged communities.
  7. This act is not intended to intrude on the authority of the federal
 government  in  areas  where it has preempted the right of the states to
 legislate. This act is remedial  in  nature,  seeking  compensation  for
 damages resulting from the past actions of polluters.

  Section  1.  Legislative  findings and declaration. In response to the
 COVID-19 pandemic, chapters 108 and 126 of the laws of 2020 were adopted
 to ensure that New Yorkers would not be deprived of gas, electric, water
 service, helping households follow the vital state policy of "sheltering
 in place."  The moratorium prohibited termination of utility services at
 a pivotal moment when it became evident that  sanitary  conditions  were
 required  to  combat  the  COVID-19  virus and keep New Yorkers safe and
 healthy, especially seniors and the medically vulnerable.  The  legisla-
 ture  finds  and  declares that it is unknown to the state the number of
 New Yorkers who had their services terminated or disconnected during the
 pandemic. The legislature finds that  many  utility  customers  rely  on
 continuous  service  for heat, water, and electricity to power necessary
 equipment, such as life-saving health care devices and other New Yorkers
 require cooling during extreme heat conditions and heat  during  extreme
 cold  conditions,  particularly when congregate care cooling and heating
 facilities are not safe for use by medically vulnerable households.  The
 legislature finds that the state requires comprehensive data  concerning
 New  Yorkers' ability to afford utility service, including the number of
 New Yorkers who had their services terminated or who  are  currently  at
 risk of termination during the pandemic. The legislature finds that this
 data  is  critical  to ascertain the effectiveness of the moratorium and
 other COVID-19 consumer protections, as well as the  disruptive  effects
 that  the  pandemic  has had on utility customers' finances, and utility
 finances and services, and the public  health,  safety  and  welfare  of
 millions  of medically and financially vulnerable citizens. The legisla-
 ture also finds that the permanent collection and reporting  of  utility
 data  is  imperative  to  gain  regular  updates  on and evaluate trends
 concerning the scale and extent of terminations and utility debt  across
 the  state, so that evidence-based policy can be properly crafted there-
 after.
  § 2. 1. As used in this act:
  a. "Assistance program" shall mean any  program  offered  to  eligible
 low-income  customers  to assist with the costs of electricity, gas, and
 water, including but not limited to the low-income home  energy  assist-
 ance  program,  any low-income affordability plans as provided by public
 service commission case number 14-M-0565,  and/or  any  other  financial
 S. 4008--B  149
 
 assistance  program  provided through or by New York state or individual
 utilities, counties or municipalities.
  b.  "COVID-19  state of emergency" shall mean the state disaster emer-
 gency declared pursuant to executive order 202 of 2020.
  c. "Commission" shall mean the public service commission.

 section  2  of  the  public  service law and shall include potable water
 districts and potable water systems owned and/or  operated  by  a  city,
 town, village, authority or other governmental subdivision.
  e.  "Utility"  shall  mean  a municipality, utility corporation, steam
 corporation, water-works corporation, an electric corporation as defined
 in subdivision 13 of section 2 of the public service law, a  gas  corpo-
 ration  as  defined in subdivision 11 of section 2 of the public service
 law, a combination gas and electric corporation as defined  in  subdivi-
 sion  14  of section 2 of the public service law, a steam corporation as
 defined in subdivision 22 of section 2 of the public service law and any

  f. "Utility corporation" shall have the same meaning  as  subdivisions
 23 and 24 of section 2 of the public service law.
  g.  "Water-works  corporation" shall have the same meaning as subdivi-
 sion 27 of section 2 of the public service law.
  2. a. Every utility shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the public
 service commission for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of  this
 act  pursuant  to  sections 24, 25 and 26 of the public service law. The
 commission shall adjudicate complaints and  conduct  investigations  for
 violation  of this act in the manner provided by the provisions of arti-
 cle 2 of the public service law.
  b. Within 180 days after the effective date of this act,  the  commis-
 sion  shall  prepare  and  submit  to the governor and the legislature a
 written report that shall make findings and  recommendations  concerning
 the affordability of electric, gas, and water services to commercial and
 residential  customers in this state. An updated report shall be submit-
 ted one year after the commission has submitted such initial  report  to
 the  governor  and legislature.  Without unreasonably exposing consumer
 personally identifiable information in a  manner  that  violates  public
 service  law  and public service commission practice or federal law, the
 reports shall include but not be limited  to  the  following,  with  all
 information  to  be  broken  down  by utility, type of service provided,
 month, customer class and county:
  (1) the number of customers and how that number compares to the previ-
 ous year's number of customers on the same month and day;
  (2) the number of  disconnection  notices  sent  due  to  non-payment,
 disconnections  due to non-payment, reconnections of customers that were
 disconnected for non-payment, and  how  those  numbers  compare  to  the
 previous year on the same month and day;

 greater  than 180 days at the end of each month, the total dollar amount
 of arrears, and how those numbers compare to the previous  year  on  the
 same  month  and day.  Provided, however, that a utility or municipality
 may petition the commission, in a form and manner to  be  determined  by
 the  commission,  to  allow such utility or municipality to provide such
 data in an alternative format if the specificity set forth in  this  act
 cannot  be  obtained  from  an  existing  utility information technology
 S. 4008--B  150
 
 system and such data would result in the increase  of  customer  utility
 bills;
  (5) the number of customers that became eligible for disconnection due
 to  bill  non-payment  but  were not disconnected because of any legally
 mandated or voluntary suspension of disconnections due to  the  COVID-19
 state  of emergency, or for any other statutory, regulatory or voluntary
 reason irrespective of the COVID-19 emergency, or such other  states  of
 emergency as may follow the end of the COVID-19 emergency;
  (6) the number of customers enrolled in deferred payment agreements at
 the end of each month;
  (7) the number of customers that entered into, successfully completed,
 or  defaulted  from  a deferred payment agreement, and how those numbers
 compare to the previous year on the same month and day;
  (8) available customer assistance programs, including terms of  eligi-
 bility,  and  any enhancements  to  the programs that have been made or
 are planned to address actual or anticipated increased demand;
  (9) the number of customers  that  applied  for  financial  assistance
 under  each applicable assistance program, and how those numbers compare
 to the previous year on the same month and day;
  (10) the number of customers receiving assistance under  each  assist-
 ance  program  at  the  end  of  each  month, the total dollar amount of
 assistance provided for arrears, the total dollar amount  of  assistance
 provided  for current or future bills and the average amount per custom-
 er, and how those numbers compare to the previous year on the same month
 and day;
  (11) the number of customers  charged  late  fees,  penalties,  recon-
 nection  fees,  interest,  and  any  other  charge  associated with late
 payment of a bill;
  (12) the total dollar amount of late fees, penalties, interest, recon-
 nection fees and any other  charge  associated  with  late  payment  per
 customer,  the  average  and  median  dollar  amount  billed to customer
 accounts and the average and median utility usage per customer account;
  (13) the methods and contents of general communications  by  utilities
 to  customer  accounts  concerning their rights and available assistance
 programs, excluding any customer-specific communications; and
  (14) the commission's assessment of whether existing customer  assist-
 ance programs are presently and will in the future be sufficient to meet
 the  financial  needs  of customer accounts in arrears who are unable to
 pay those arrears in full, as well as the needs of customer accounts who
 may be unable to pay bills for current service.
  c. Following the commission's submission of the reports to the  gover-
 nor  and  legislature  such  reports shall be posted on the commission's
 website and be subject to 30 days of  public  comment  on  affordability
 from the date of the submission to the governor and the legislature. The
 commission  shall  provide meaningful  opportunities for  public comment
 from  all  persons who will be impacted by findings of  the  commission,
 including  persons  living  in  disadvantaged communities and in rural
 communities across  the  state  in  entirety.  Within  90  days  of  the
 submission  of the initial report, the commission shall conduct at least
 five public  hearings in different regions of the state,  as  defined
 by  the  empire  state development corporation, and provide meaningful
 opportunity for comment. The public hearings may be held virtually.
  d. Each utility shall, within 90 days of the effective  date  of  this
 act,  submit  to  the commission, in a form and manner determined by the
 commission, the information required pursuant to  paragraph  b  of  this
 subdivision.  Six months after the submission of the initial report to
 S. 4008--B  151
 
 the governor and legislature, each utility shall submit to  the  commis-
 sion, in a form and manner determined by the commission, the information
 required pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivision. Each utility shall

  PART MMM
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "NY Home Energy Affordable Transition Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares that:
  1. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act  (the  "CLCPA")
 created  legal  mandates for dramatic greenhouse gas emission reductions
 from all sectors of New York's economy. The CLCPA also emphasizes equity
 in addressing climate change by requiring all state agencies and author-
 ities to prioritize reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollu-
 tants in disadvantaged communities and by mandating that  certain  state
 investments deliver benefits to these communities.
  2.  Buildings  are  New  York's largest source of greenhouse gas emis-
 sions, accounting for approximately  one-third  of  the  greenhouse  gas
 emissions  in  our  state.  New York state's buildings also produce more
 local air pollution than any other state in the  country,  resulting  in
 negative health outcomes such as increased rates of asthma, particularly
 among  children,  and  heart disease. Therefore, reducing greenhouse gas
 emissions and toxic air pollution emitted  from  New  York's  buildings,
 especially  in disadvantaged communities, is necessary to meet the CLCPA
 mandates.
  3. To meet the state's bold climate and equity mandates, New York will
 need to update how it regulates  gas  utility  service.  Doing  so  will
 enable strategic planning and investments in neighborhood-scale building
 decarbonization  and  help  bring  the statewide gas distribution system
 into alignment with the two  thousand  thirty  and  two  thousand  fifty
 S. 4008--B  152
 
 greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  mandates  in  the CLCPA through an
 orderly and equitable process, coordinated with appropriate  investments
 in  the electric system to ensure all New Yorkers have non-discriminato-
 ry,  affordable  access  to  the energy needed for heating, cooling, and
 powering the buildings in which they live and work.
  4. The New York public service  law  not  only  contains  barriers  to
 neighborhood-scale  building  decarbonization  solutions such as thermal
 energy networks, but also works  at  cross  purposes  with  the  state's
 climate  and  affordability  goals,  by  requiring  and  subsidizing the
 continued expansion of natural gas infrastructure.
  a. The gas utility obligation to serve codified in the public  service
 law  is  a  major  obstacle  to  utilities developing neighborhood-scale
 building decarbonization projects that would facilitate bringing the gas
 system into alignment with the two  thousand  thirty  and  two  thousand
 fifty  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  mandates  in the CLCPA in a
 manner that can mitigate costs for all utility customers, reduces green-
 house gas emissions and co-pollutants impacting local air  quality,  and
 provides a transition for impacted workers.
  b.  Statutorily  mandated  utility system extension allowances require
 existing ratepayers to subsidize  gas  infrastructure  hookups  for  new
 customers.  According  to  a recent joint filing with the Public Service
 Commission by the New York state gas utilities,  these  required  allow-
 ances  cost  gas  utilities  hundreds  of  millions of dollars per year.
 These costs are passed directly to existing gas customers.
  c. Gas utilities in New York are on track to collectively  spend  $150
 billion  to  replace thousands of miles of leak prone pipe in the coming
 years. These investments pose a risk of becoming stranded  assets,  with
 $77  billion of the total cost coming due after 2050, but can be avoided
 in many cases by strategically investing in neighborhood-scale decarbon-
 ization projects.
  5. New Yorkers are suffering from dramatic fossil  fuel  price  spikes
 driven  by  the increasingly integrated global commodity market, subject
 to the whims of foreign dictators such as  Russia's  Vladimir  Putin  or
 Saudi  Arabia's  Prince  Mohammed  bin  Salman.  Fossil fuel prices have
 spiked to historic high levels, making both electricity and gas  utility
 service  unaffordable  for  many  New  Yorkers.  Decarbonizing buildings
 through the strategic development of neighborhood-scale building  decar-
 bonization  projects,  along  with  investing  in  energy efficiency and
 renewable electricity, will save  New  Yorkers  money  now  and  in  the
 future,  protect against price volatility, and promote true energy inde-
 pendence for New York state.
  6. Fossil fuel price spikes are exacerbating the affordability impacts
 of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Over a million  households  in  New  York  now
 struggle  to  pay their utility bills. The Public Service Commission has
 declared, but not yet achieved, a goal that  customers  should  not  pay
 more than 6% of their income for utility energy services, a number based
 on a nationally accepted standard.
  7.  Thus,  it  is  the  intent of the legislature to enact the NY Home
 Energy Affordable Transition Act for the following purposes:
  a. to ensure that the public  service  law  regarding  regulation  and
 oversight  of  gas  utilities  will provide for the timely and strategic
 decarbonization and right-sizing of the gas  distribution  system  in  a
 just  and  affordable manner as required to meet the climate justice and
 emission reduction mandates of the CLCPA, appropriately balancing  rate-
 payers'  needs  and  interests with the maintenance of financially sound
 S. 4008--B  153
 
 utilities, prioritizing low-to-moderate income customers  and  disadvan-
 taged communities, and encouraging neighborhood-scale transitions;
  b. to provide the Public Service Commission with the statutory author-
 ity  and  direction  to  align utility regulations and planning with the
 CLCPA climate justice and emission reduction mandates and to require the
 Public Service Commission to take a proactive role in the  timely  iden-
 tification  and  amendment of such regulations or rulings as may pose an
 impediment to achieving CLCPA mandates, and to identify  any  laws  that
 may pose an impediment;
  c.  to  end  statutorily mandated, ratepayer-subsidized incentives for
 the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure while maintaining the  equi-
 table  provision  of  electric  service  for efficient heating, cooling,
 cooking, hot water, and other uses;
  d. to provide affordable access to electricity for heating and cooling
 and to protect  low-income  and  moderate-income  customers  from  undue
 burdens as they decarbonize their buildings; and
  e.  to  clarify that municipal building codes regulating on-site emis-
 sions are not preempted under New York state law.
  8. This legislation does not establish a ban on the use of gas. It  is
 neither  the  intent  nor  would it be the effect of this legislation to
 require the immediate transition of any existing gas customer to  alter-
 native heating and cooling services.
  §  3. Subdivision 1 of section 4 of the public service law, as amended
 by chapter 594 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  1. There shall be in the department of public service a public service
 commission, which shall possess the powers and duties hereinafter speci-
 fied, and also all powers necessary or proper to enable it to carry  out
 the  purposes  of  this chapter AND TO ENABLE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CLIMATE
 JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE  HUNDRED  SIX  OF
 THE  LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND FUNC-
 TION AS MAY ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. The  commission  shall  consist  of
 five  members,  to  be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice
 and consent of the senate. A commissioner shall be designated as [chair-
 man] CHAIRPERSON of the commission by the  governor  to  serve  in  such
 capacity  at  the  pleasure  of the governor or until his OR HER term as
 commissioner expires whichever first occurs. At least  one  commissioner
 shall  have  experience in utility consumer advocacy. No more than three
 commissioners may be members of the same political party unless,  pursu-
 ant to action taken under subdivision two of this section, the number of
 commissioners  shall  exceed  five,  and in such event no more than four
 commissioners may be members of the same political party.

 ERS WITH HARD-TO-ELECTRIFY INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USES,  pursuant  to
 rules  and  regulations as may be adopted by the commission, and that to
 carry  out  this  declared policy the jurisdiction of the public service
 commission should be clarified.  IT IS FURTHER DECLARED TO BE THE POLICY
 OF THIS STATE THAT GAS SERVICE TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS MUST BE PROVIDED IN
 A MANNER THAT IS SAFE AND ADEQUATE, NOT UNJUSTLY DISCRIMINATORY OR UNDU-
 LY PREFERENTIAL, AND IN ALL RESPECTS JUST AND REASONABLE.
  2. Notwithstanding the provisions of any statute or any franchise held
 by a gas corporation, the commission shall have power, upon the  finding
 that CONTINUED GAS SERVICE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE
 CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, OR THAT there  exists  such  a
 shortage  of  gas  in  any  area  in the state, that the gas corporation
 supplying such area is unable and will be unable to  secure  or  produce
 sufficient  gas  to  meet  the  reasonable needs of its customers and of
 persons or corporations applying for new or additional gas  service,  to
 require such corporation to immediately discontinue the supplying of gas
 to  additional  customers  or of supplying additional service to present
 customers, for such purpose or purposes as  may  be  designated  by  the
 commission,  or  to  customers using gas for a purpose prohibited by the
 commission pursuant to this act, and that  upon  the  finding  that  the
 supply  of  gas  available  is  and  will  be insufficient to supply the
 demands of all consumers receiving service, to require such  gas  corpo-
 ration  to  curtail  or  discontinue  service  to  any or all classes of
 customers of such gas corporation.  In  imposing  such  a  direction  or
 requirement,  the  commission shall give consideration first to existing
 domestic uses and uses deemed to  be  necessary  by  the  commission  to
 protect  public health and safety and to avoid undue hardship [and shall
 be limited to the period of the emergency provided that the  gas  corpo-
 ration  affected  shall  make such restriction, curtailing or discontin-
 uance applicable to all customers or applicants for service  in  a  like
 class. If the commission determines that good cause exists for supplying
 service  to  additional customers or for supplying additional service to
 some existing customers, notwithstanding the curtailment  or  discontin-
 uance  of  service  to other existing customers, it shall, to the extent
 feasible, allocate gas with equal priority to new or additional domestic
 uses of gas and commercial or industrial  processes  which  require  gas
 because  there  is  no practical substitute for it in such proportion as
 the commission determines to be reasonable.  Provided that  the  commis-
 sion  shall be permitted, after public hearing, to authorize any natural
 gas produced from lands under the waters of Lake Erie  to  be  used  for
 process  or  feedstock  requirements].  The  commission is authorized to
 adopt such rules, regulations and orders as are necessary or appropriate
 to carry out these delegated powers.
  3. In carrying out the delegated powers provided for in this  section,
 the commission shall, to the extent practicable, determine and establish
 gas conservation measures or standards, INCLUDING ENERGY EFFICIENT ELEC-
 TRIFICATION  OF GAS END USES. The commission may require compliance with
 such measures or standards as a condition of receiving service.
  4. THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NEW OR  ADDI-
 TIONAL  GAS  SERVICE  IS  WARRANTED NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEED TO CONSERVE
 RESOURCES FOR SERVICE TO EXISTING GAS  CUSTOMERS.  SUCH  DETERMINATION
 SHALL  BE  CONSISTENT  WITH  THE  ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CLIMATE JUSTICE AND
 EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF  THE  LAWS  OF
 TWO  THOUSAND  NINETEEN,  AND  MAY  TAKE  INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS INCLUDING
 S. 4008--B  160
 
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IMPACTS ON NEW AND  EXISTING  CUSTOMERS  INCLUDING
 LOW-TO-MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS, IMPACTS ON SYSTEM SAFETY AND ADEQUACY,
 EQUITY  TOWARD  EXISTING CUSTOMERS WITH LIMITED CONVERSION ALTERNATIVES,
 AND THE FEASIBILITY OF NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE ALTERNATIVES TO USAGE OF FUELS
 WITH  HIGH  LIFE-CYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ON-SITE CO-POLLUTANT
 EMISSIONS, INCLUDING THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS.
  5. THE COMMISSION SHALL  REQUIRE  GAS  AND/OR  ELECTRIC  UTILITIES  TO
 PROVIDE  COORDINATION ASSISTANCE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, IN SUCH FORMS
 AS THE COMMISSION DEEMS REASONABLY REQUIRED TO  IMPLEMENT  STATE  ENERGY
 POLICY, TO IDENTIFY AND ADOPT ALTERNATIVES WHERE APPLICATIONS FOR NEW OR
 ADDITIONAL GAS SERVICE ARE DENIED AND ENCOURAGE NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE TRAN-
 SITIONS.
  § 10. Section 66-b of the public service law is REPEALED.
  §  11.  The public service law is amended by adding a new section 66-u
 to read as follows:
  § 66-U.  EXPANSION  OF  GAS  DISTRIBUTION  INFRASTRUCTURE.  EXCEPT  AS
 PROVIDED  IN  THIS  SECTION,  AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF
 THIS CHAPTER, AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR,  NO
 GAS  CORPORATION  SHALL  COMMENCE  CONSTRUCTION  OF NEW GAS DISTRIBUTION
 INFRASTRUCTURE THE RESULT  OF WHICH WOULD BE TO EXPAND THE  AVAILABILITY
 OF  SERVICE  INTO  GEOGRAPHIC  AREAS WHERE GAS SERVICE WAS NOT AVAILABLE
 PRIOR TO THAT DATE AS DEFINED BY THE APPLICABLE UTILITY'S CERTIFICATE OF
 PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION.  NO  SUCH
 NEW  GAS  DISTRIBUTION  INFRASTRUCTURE  SHALL BE PUT INTO SERVICE AFTER
 DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE.  THE  COMMISSION  MAY
 AUTHORIZE  EXCEPTIONS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, PROVIDED THAT THE COMMIS-
 SION  FINDS  THAT  THE  PROJECT  QUALIFYING  FOR  THE EXCEPTION SERVES A
 COMPELLING STATE INTEREST, ALTERNATIVES TO GAS SERVICE  ARE  EITHER  NOT
 TECHNICALLY  FEASIBLE  OR  PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE, AND THAT THE PROJECT
 WILL BE COMPLETED AND PUT INTO SERVICE NOT LATER THAN  DECEMBER  THIRTY-
 FIRST,  TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SEVEN. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, GAS
 DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE SHALL INCLUDE ALL REAL ESTATE, FIXTURES  AND
 PERSONAL  PROPERTY  OPERATED,  OWNED,  USED  OR  TO  BE  USED  FOR OR IN
 CONNECTION WITH OR TO FACILITATE THE MANUFACTURE, CONVEYING, TRANSPORTA-
 TION, DISTRIBUTION, SALE OR FURNISHING OF GAS (NATURAL  OR  MANUFACTURED
 OR  A  MIXTURE  OF  BOTH) FOR LIGHT, HEAT OR POWER, BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE
 PROPERTY USED SOLELY FOR OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE BUSINESS OF  SELLING,
 DISTRIBUTING OR FURNISHING OF GAS IN ENCLOSED CONTAINERS.
  § 12. Section 66-g of the public service law is REPEALED.
  §  13.  The public service law is amended by adding a new section 77-a
 to read as follows:
  § 77-A. ALIGNING UTILITY REGULATION WITH CLIMATE JUSTICE AND  EMISSION
 REDUCTION  MANDATES.  1.  WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
 THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSION SHALL INITIATE A  PROCEEDING,  OR  MULTIPLE
 PROCEEDINGS, AS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE, TO CONSIDER AND ACT ON THE MATTERS
 IDENTIFIED  IN  THIS  SECTION IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN ITS REGULATION OF
 UTILITY SERVICES WITH THE TIMELY ACHIEVEMENT  OF  CONSISTENCY  WITH  THE
 CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IF THE COMMISSION  IS  ALREADY
 ENGAGED  IN  A PROCEEDING ADDRESSING ONE OR MORE OF THE  MATTERS IDENTI-
 FIED IN THIS SECTION, IT SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO OPEN A NEW  PROCEEDING
 ON  THAT  MATTER.  FOLLOWING  COMPLETION  OF ALL PROCEEDINGS INITIATED
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSION SHALL INITIATE  REGULAR  SUBSE-
 QUENT  PROCEEDINGS,  AS  IT  DEEMS  NECESSARY, TO ENSURE  THE  ACHIEVE-
 MENT  OF  THE  GOALS  OUTLINED  IN THIS SECTION.  THE  PROCEEDING  OR
 PROCEEDINGS SHALL INCLUDE:
 S. 4008--B  161
 
  (A) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, A REVIEW OF
 THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE  LAW  AND  ITS CURRENT RULES AND POLICY GUIDANCE TO
 IDENTIFY ANY LAW, RULE, GUIDANCE, OR LACK THEREOF, THAT  MAY  INHIBIT
 TIMELY,  EQUITABLE  ACHIEVEMENT  OF  CONSISTENCY WITH THE  CLIMATE
 JUSTICE  AND EMISSION REDUCTION  MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF
 THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THE COMMISSION SHALL  REPORT  TO  THE
 LEGISLATURE  ITS  PROGRESS  AND FINDINGS, IDENTIFY SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS IT
 WILL  TAKE,  AND  MAKE  RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR ANY STATUTORY AMENDMENTS OR
 OTHER ACTIONS THAT MAY  BE NEEDED TO FACILITATE THE  TIMELY  ACHIEVEMENT
 OF SUCH  MANDATES.
  (B)  WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, A REVISION
 OF THE COMMISSION'S RULES AND REGULATIONS  FOR  DETERMINING  APPROPRIATE
 ALLOWANCES  FOR  THE  EXTENSION  OF GAS AND ELECTRIC UTILITY SERVICES TO
 ENSURE THAT UTILITY SERVICE IS PROVIDED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH  THE
 ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN
 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IN  ESTAB-
 LISHING  RULES GOVERNING THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE EXTENSION OF GAS SERVICE,
 THE COMMISSION SHALL ELIMINATE  ALL  MAIN  AND  SERVICE  LINE  EXTENSION
 ALLOWANCES  FOR  GAS  SERVICE  AND  MAY INCREASE ALLOWANCES FOR ELECTRIC
 SERVICE. THE COMMISSION MAY ESTABLISH RULES THAT  PROVIDE  FOR  DISTINCT
 ELECTRIC ALLOWANCES FOR ALL-ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS AND FOR DUAL-FUEL CUSTOM-
 ERS AND MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC ALLOWANCES TO BUILDINGS THAT ARE
 MADE  READY  FOR  BENEFICIAL  ELECTRIC LOADS SUCH AS THOSE WITH ELECTRIC
 VEHICLE CHARGING FACILITIES AND GRID INTERACTIVE BUILDINGS. THE  COMMIS-
 SION MAY ALSO ESTABLISH ALLOWANCES FOR BUILDINGS SEEKING INTERCONNECTION
 WITH THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS.
  (C)  IN  ORDER  TO  MINIMIZE  LONG-TERM COSTS AND STRANDED ASSETS, AND
 MAXIMIZE SAVINGS AND BENEFITS FOR CUSTOMERS,  WITHIN  ONE  YEAR  OF  THE
 EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THIS  SECTION  THE  COMMISSION SHALL ISSUE AN ORDER
 REQUIRING EACH GAS CORPORATION, WITHIN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY  DAYS  OF  THE
 ISSUANCE  OF THE ORDER, TO RESTRUCTURE ITS PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE LEAK-
 PRONE GAS MAINS AND SERVICE LINES ON ITS SYSTEM TO FACILITATE THE ORDER-
 LY RIGHT-SIZING OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM  TO  ACHIEVE  CONSISTENCY
 WITH  THE CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE
 HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHILE MAINTAINING SAFE-
 TY AND RELIABILITY OF THE GAS SYSTEM, SUBJECT TO  ALL  RELEVANT  FEDERAL
 LAWS  AND  REGULATIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, THE COMMISSION SHALL REQUIRE
 EACH GAS CORPORATION, IN COORDINATION WITH ANY AND ALL  ELECTRIC  CORPO-
 RATIONS  WITH  OVERLAPPING  SERVICE  AREAS,  TO  PURSUE A GEOGRAPHICALLY
 TARGETED APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING ALTERNATIVE  SOLUTIONS  THAT  MINIMIZE
 THE  REPLACEMENT OF LEAK-PRONE GAS MAINS AND SERVICE LINES WHILE ENCOUR-
 AGING  NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE  FULL  BUILDING  ELECTRIFICATION,  INCLUDING
 THROUGH  THE  INSTALLATION  OF THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS, RESULTING IN THE
 DECOMMISSIONING OF THE MAXIMUM FEASIBLE SEGMENT OF GAS MAIN  OR  SERVICE
 LINE.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL REQUIRE EACH GAS CORPORATION, AFTER NOTICE
 AND COMMENT, TO  ESTABLISH  CRITERIA  FOR  EVALUATING  WHETHER  SPECIFIC
 SEGMENTS OF LEAK-PRONE MAINS AND SERVICE LINES ARE CANDIDATES FOR SUCH A
 GEOGRAPHICALLY  TARGETED APPROACH AND TO EVALUATE THEIR ENTIRE INVENTORY
 OF LEAK-PRONE PIPES TO CREATE A  STRATEGIC  DECOMMISSIONING  RANKING  IN
 WHICH  IT  RANKS  THE  SEGMENTS IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO ELECTRIFY ALL
 CUSTOMERS SERVED BY THE SEGMENT AND RETIRE THE GAS DISTRIBUTION  INFRAS-
 TRUCTURE.  THE COMMISSION SHALL REQUIRE EACH GAS CORPORATION TO FILE AN
 ANNUAL REPORT THAT PROVIDES A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF
 THE REDUCTION OF LEAK-PRONE PIPE INVENTORY AND THAT UPDATES THE  STRATE-
 GIC  DECOMMISSIONING  RANKING  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE COMMISSION SHALL
 ESTABLISH NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND CONSUMER AND AFFORDABILITY PROTECTIONS
 S. 4008--B  162
 
 IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION THIRTY OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE  LAW  APPLICABLE
 TO  CUSTOMERS SERVED BY SEGMENTS OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TARGETED
 FOR DECOMMISSIONING.
  (D)  IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE COST SAVINGS AND BENEFITS OF THE TRANSI-
 TION OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM FOR THE EQUITABLE, ORDERLY,  AND  AFFORDABLE
 ACHIEVEMENT  OF  CONSISTENCY  WITH  THE  CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND  EMISSION
 REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF  TWO  THOU-
 SAND NINETEEN, WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION THE
 COMMISSION  SHALL  ISSUE AN ORDER REQUIRING ALL ELECTRIC CORPORATIONS TO
 PURSUE ALL AVAILABLE ELECTRIC ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND  DEMAND  FLEXIBILITY
 MEASURES  THAT  ARE  COST-EFFECTIVE,  RELIABLE,  AND  FEASIBLE.  NO LESS
 FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY THREE YEARS, THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  IDENTIFY  THE
 STATEWIDE  ACHIEVABLE  POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND FLEXI-
 BILITY MEASURES FOR THE SUBSEQUENT TEN-YEAR PERIOD AND ESTABLISH  ANNUAL
 ENERGY  EFFICIENCY  AND  DEMAND  FLEXIBILITY  TARGETS  FOR EACH ELECTRIC
 CORPORATION THAT ARE NO LOWER THAN ITS PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE  STATE-
 WIDE ACHIEVABLE POTENTIAL.
  (E) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION  SHALL COMPLETE A PROCEEDING TO DEVELOP AND ISSUE A REPORT EVALUAT-
 ING AND CONSIDERING RATE MAKING STRATEGIES TO ENCOURAGE  AND  FACILITATE
 ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN
 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS  OF  TWO  THOUSAND  NINETEEN.  THE
 REPORT SHALL EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR DEVELOPING AND ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF
 RATES  FOR  ELECTRIC,  GAS,  STEAM, AND THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS ON TOTAL
 CUSTOMER ENERGY COSTS, AND SHALL EXPLORE OPTIONS  FOR  INTEGRATING  COST
 SHARING  AND  RECOVERY  ACROSS  UTILITIES AND SERVICES. THE REPORT SHALL
 ALSO IDENTIFY STATUTORY BARRIERS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF  SUCH  STRATE-
 GIES.  IN  CONSIDERING SUCH RATE MAKING STRATEGIES, THE COMMISSION SHALL
 HAVE A GOAL OF ENSURING  THAT  ALL  LOW-TO-MODERATE  INCOME  RESIDENTIAL
 CUSTOMERS PAY NO MORE THAN SIX PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME FOR ELECTRICITY.
  (F) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION  SHALL  DETERMINE,  BASED  ON  THE  BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE
 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS NECESSARY TO BRING THE STATEWIDE  GAS
 DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTO ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATEWIDE TWO THOUSAND THIR-
 TY  AND  TWO THOUSAND FIFTY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS IN
 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND  NINETEEN,  AND  SET
 INTERIM  EMISSION  REDUCTION  TARGETS  FOR EACH GAS UTILITY AS WELL AS
 DEVELOPING A PERIODIC PROCESS TO REVIEW AND UPDATE SUCH TARGETS;
  (G) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SION SHALL REVISE ITS RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR CONDUCTING  BENEFIT-COST
 ANALYSES  SO  THAT  THE METHODOLOGY AND THE BASE FINANCIAL AND FRAMEWORK
 ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE ANALYSIS SUPPORT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CLIMATE  JUSTICE
 AND  EMISSION  REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS
 OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SUCH  REVISIONS  SHALL  INCLUDE,  BUT  NOT  BE
 LIMITED TO:
  (1)  GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSION  REDUCTION  MANDATES SHALL BE USED AS A
 CONSTRAINT IN DESIGNING THE SCENARIOS TO BE ANALYZED SUCH THAT  ALL  THE
 SCENARIOS  SHALL  COMPLY  WITH  THE  STATUTORY  GREENHOUSE  GAS EMISSION
 REQUIREMENTS AND ANY INTERIM TARGETS SET BY THE DEPARTMENT  OF  ENVIRON-
 MENTAL  CONSERVATION OR THE COMMISSION  IN ORDER TO INTERNALIZE THE COST
 OF ACHIEVING SUCH TARGETS IN THE BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS.
  (2) QUANTIFICATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN AMBI-
 ENT AND INDOOR AIR QUALITY. WHEN QUANTITATIVE METRICS ARE NOT  POSSIBLE,
 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS SHALL BE INCLUDED.
  (3)  CONSIDERATION  OF THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES AND RISKS ASSOCI-
 ATED WITH DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, INCLUDING  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACT  OF
 S. 4008--B  163

 LEAKED  GAS,  THE PROLONGED RELIANCE ON THE GAS SYSTEM THAT RESULTS FROM
 LONG-LIVED INVESTMENTS IN GAS INFRASTRUCTURE  AND  GAS-CONSUMING  EQUIP-
 MENT, THE POSITIVE OPTION VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH MEASURES THAT CAN ELIMI-
 NATE  OR  DEFER  THE NEED FOR INVESTMENTS IN GAS INFRASTRUCTURE AND GAS-
 CONSUMING EQUIPMENT,  AND  POTENTIAL  CHALLENGES  ASSOCIATED  WITH  FULL
 ELECTRIFICATION.
  (4) IN INSTANCES WHERE AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL HAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRI-
 BUTE,  ONLY ATTRIBUTE ALTERNATIVE FUELS WITH EMISSION REDUCTION BENEFITS
 UNDER THE BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS  IF  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL  ATTRIBUTES  ARE
 RETAINED BY THE UTILITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE UTILITY'S CUSTOMERS OR BY
 THE END-USE CUSTOMER.
  (5)  USE ACCURATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES THAT ASSUME THE FULL VALUE OF
 ANY NEW GAS ASSET IS FULLY DEPRECIATED NO LATER THAN TWO THOUSAND FIFTY,
 ABSENT DEMONSTRATION THAT THE SPECIFIC  ASSET  WILL  REMAIN  IN  SERVICE
 BEYOND  TWO  THOUSAND FIFTY, AND EARLIER IF IT IS LIKELY THAT SUCH ASSET
 WILL NEED TO BE PHASED OUT OR RETIRED BEFORE TWO  THOUSAND  FIFTY  GIVEN
 ANY  INTERIM GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS OR GEOGRAPHICALLY
 TARGETED STRATEGIC ASSET RETIREMENT.
  (6) ASSESS DEMOGRAPHIC IMPACTS BY MEASURING WITH  AS  MUCH  GEOGRAPHIC
 GRANULARITY AS POSSIBLE AND CONSIDERING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPOSURE AND
 RISK  FACTORS  FOR  IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER POPU-
 LATIONS WITH VULNERABILITY TO CHANGES INDUCED BY REGULATION.
  2. NOTHING IN THIS CHAPTER OR ANY OTHER LAW OF NEW YORK STATE SHALL BE
 INTERPRETED OR OTHERWISE CONSTRUED AS  PREEMPTING  A  MUNICIPALITY  FROM
 ADOPTING BUILDING CODES OR OTHER REGULATIONS REGARDING ON-SITE EMISSIONS
 FOR NEW AND EXISTING BUILDINGS WITHIN THEIR LOCALITIES.

 research and development expenditures in New York state during the taxa-
 ble  year;  provided  however,  if  not  a  green project, the excelsior
 research and development tax credit shall not exceed six percent of  the
 S. 4008--B  166
 
 qualified  research  and development expenditures attributable to activ-
 ities conducted in New York state, or, if a green project [or], a  Green
 CHIPS project, OR A NY HEMP PROJECT, the excelsior research and develop-
 ment  tax  credit  shall  not  exceed  eight percent of the research and
 development expenditures attributable to  activities  conducted  in  New
 York  state. If the federal research and development credit has expired,
 then the research and development expenditures relating to  the  federal
 research  and  development  credit shall be calculated as if the federal
 research and development credit structure and definition  in  effect  in
 two  thousand  nine  were  still  in  effect.  Notwithstanding any other
 provision of this chapter to  the  contrary,  research  and  development
 expenditures  in  this state, including salary or wage expenses for jobs
 related to research and development activities in  this  state,  may  be
 used  as the basis for the excelsior research and development tax credit

  1.  In  connection  with  the undertaking of any project for which the
 commissioner is authorized to  use  moneys  of  the  federal  government
 pursuant  to  the provisions of subdivision thirty-four-a of section ten
 and section eighty of this chapter to assure the effective discharge  of
 state responsibilities with respect to regional transportation needs, on
 highways, roads, streets, bicycle paths [or], pedestrian paths, OR PARK-
 AND-RIDE  DEVELOPMENTS  that  are  not  on the state highway system, the
 commissioner shall submit such project to the governing body  or  bodies
 of  the  affected municipality or municipalities together with estimates
 of costs thereof. If such project includes a municipal project, as  that
 term  is  defined in accordance with article thirteen of the transporta-
 tion law, the state share  of  such  municipal  project  shall  also  be
 included.  If such project includes a project affecting a highway, road,
 street, bicycle path [or], pedestrian path,  OR  PARK-AND-RIDE  DEVELOP-
 MENTS not on the state highway system, the state share shall be equal to
 eighty  percent of the difference between the total project cost and the
 federal assistance, provided, however, the state share shall be equal to
 eighty-seven and one-half percent of the difference  between  the  total
 project  cost and the federal assistance where, in conjunction with such
 project, the municipality  agrees  to  fund  a  complete  street  design
 feature  as defined in section three hundred thirty-one of this chapter,
 provided, further, the commissioner may increase the state share  to  an
 amount  equal to one hundred percent of the difference between the total
 project cost and the federal assistance where he or she determines  that
 the  need  for the project results substantially from actions undertaken
 pursuant to section ten of this chapter. No such project  shall  proceed
 without  the  approval  of  the  governing  body of a municipality. Such
 governing body may request the commissioner to undertake  the  provision
 of  such  project.  If the commissioner agrees to such undertaking he or
 she shall notify the local governing body which shall appropriate suffi-
 cient moneys to pay the estimated amount of the municipal share.  Such
 moneys  shall  be deposited with the state comptroller who is authorized
 to receive and accept the same for the purposes of such project, subject
 S. 4008--B  167
 
 to the draft or requisition of the commissioner. When the work  of  such
 project has been completed, the commissioner shall render to the govern-
 ing  body of such municipality an itemized statement showing in full (a)
 the  amount  of  money that has been deposited by such municipality with
 the state comptroller as hereinbefore provided, and  (b)  all  disburse-
 ments  made  pursuant  to  this  section for such project.  Any surplus
 moneys shall be paid to such municipality on the warrant  of  the  comp-
 troller on vouchers therefor approved by the commissioner. When the work
 of  such  project has been completed and it is determined by the commis-
 sioner that the amount of the cost to be borne by the municipality is in
 excess of the amount deposited by such municipality with the state comp-
 troller, the commissioner shall then  notify  the  municipality  of  the
 deficiency  of  funds. The municipality shall then within ninety days of
 the receipt of such notice, pay such amount to  the  state  comptroller.
 For  purposes  of  this section, the term "municipality" shall include a
 city, county, town, village or two  or  more  of  the  foregoing  acting
 jointly.
  §  1-a.  Subdivision  1  of  section  80-b  of the highway law, as
 amended by chapter 3 of the laws  of  2023,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1.  In  connection  with  the undertaking of any project for which the
 commissioner is authorized to  use  moneys  of  the  federal  government
 pursuant  to  the provisions of subdivision thirty-four-a of section ten
 and section eighty of this chapter to assure the effective discharge  of
 state responsibilities with respect to regional transportation needs, on
 highways, roads, streets, bicycle paths [or], pedestrian paths, OR PARK-
 AND-RIDE  DEVELOPMENTS  that  are  not  on the state highway system, the
 commissioner shall submit such project to the governing body  or  bodies
 of  the  affected municipality or municipalities together with estimates
 of costs thereof. If such project includes a municipal project, as  that
 term  is  defined in accordance with article thirteen of the transporta-
 tion law, the state share  of  such  municipal  project  shall  also  be
 included.  If such project includes a project affecting a highway, road,
 street, bicycle path [or], pedestrian path,  OR  PARK-AND-RIDE  DEVELOP-
 MENTS not on the state highway system, the state share shall be equal to
 eighty  percent of the difference between the total project cost and the
 federal assistance, provided, however, the commissioner may increase the
 state share to an amount equal to one hundred percent of the  difference
 between  the  total  project cost and the federal assistance where he or
 she determines that the need for the project results substantially  from
 actions  undertaken  pursuant  to  section  ten of this chapter. No such
 project shall proceed without the approval of the governing  body  of  a
 municipality. Such governing body may request the commissioner to under-
 take  the  provision of such project. If the commissioner agrees to such
 undertaking he or she shall notify the local governing body which  shall
 appropriate sufficient moneys to pay the estimated amount of the munici-
 pal share. Such moneys shall be deposited with the state comptroller who
 is  authorized  to  receive and accept the same for the purposes of such
 project, subject to the draft or requisition of the  commissioner.  When
 the  work  of  such  project  has been completed, the commissioner shall
 render to the governing body of such municipality an itemized  statement
 showing  in full (a) the amount of money that has been deposited by such
 municipality with the state comptroller as  hereinbefore  provided,  and
 (b)  all  disbursements  made pursuant to this section for such project.
 Any surplus moneys shall be paid to such municipality on the warrant  of
 the  comptroller on vouchers therefor approved by the commissioner. When
 S. 4008--B  168
 
 the work of such project has been completed and it is determined by  the
 commissioner that the amount of the cost to be borne by the municipality
 is in excess of the amount deposited by such municipality with the state
 comptroller,  the commissioner shall then notify the municipality of the
 deficiency of funds. The municipality shall then within ninety  days  of
 the  receipt  of  such notice, pay such amount to the state comptroller.
 For purposes of this section, the term "municipality"  shall  include  a
 city,  county,  town,  village  or  two  or more of the foregoing acting
 jointly.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that

 winter  road  maintenance  practices and engaging the public in changing
 behaviors to support road salt reduction efforts.
  § 2. 1. The department of transportation and the department  of  envi-
 ronmental  conservation  shall  review  the report of the East of Hudson
 watershed road  salt  reduction  task  force,  established  pursuant  to
 section  one of this act, shall conduct water sampling and analysis, and
 shall incorporate into a road salt pilot program in the East  of  Hudson
 watershed  those  recommendations that, in the discretion of the commis-
 sioner of transportation, will not jeopardize the health and  safety  of
 the  traveling  public and for which an appropriation is available. Such
 S. 4008--B  172
 
 road salt pilot program shall be established two years after such  water
 sampling and analysis has been completed to establish necessary baseline
 data.  Local  governments in the East of Hudson watershed may review the
 report  of  the East of Hudson watershed road salt reduction task force,
 established pursuant to section one of this  act,  and  may  incorporate
 into  a  road salt pilot program in their jurisdiction those recommenda-
 tions that, in the discretion of the commissioner of transportation  and
 the  local  government, will not jeopardize the health and safety of the
 traveling public and for which funding is available.
  2. Following the incorporation of the recommendations into a road salt
 pilot program, the department of transportation and department of  envi-
 ronmental  conservation  shall  submit a summary report to the governor,
 temporary president of the senate, and speaker of the assembly by August
 30, 2028, of the results of such pilot program, including the  identifi-
 cation  of  effective and ineffective techniques for winter road mainte-
 nance and revised levels of service in the East of Hudson watershed.

 ing  the  payment  of the final estimate, pay not to exceed seventy-five
 per centum of the amount of the retained percentage.

 ANCE  BONDS  AND  PAYMENT BONDS MAY BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THE AGGREGATE
 AMOUNT OF THE CONTRACT IS UNDER FIVE HUNDRED  THOUSAND  DOLLARS.  ADVER-
 TISEMENTS FOR PROPOSALS SHALL PROVIDE INFORMATION AS TO THE REQUIREMENTS
 FOR,  OR  DISPENSATION  OF,  PERFORMANCE  AND  PAYMENT  BONDS.  Provided
 further, that in a case where a performance or payment bond is dispensed
 with, twenty per centum may be retained from each  progress  payment  or
 estimate until the entire contract work has been completed and accepted,

  PART DDDD
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 the  public  health, safety and welfare of the residents of the state of
 New York traveling to, from and within the city of New York is an  issue
 that  affects millions of New Yorkers and visitors.  This issue includes
 access to adequate residential parking. Residents of  the  city  of  New
 York,  particularly  from  outer  borough  communities, have some of the
 longest commutation times in the country. Public  transportation  access
 is  often  limited  for  these  residents  and visitors as well. Lack of
 adequate parking and public transportation  options  can  also  pose  an
 issue  for parents with small children, caregivers making home visits or
 providing transportation assistance for severely  disabled  individuals,
 and  can  make life difficult for motorists with disabilities attempting
 to park near their homes. In addition, emissions  from  idling  vehicles
 that  are  stopped  or  standing,  or  from vehicles continually looping
 around their neighborhoods in search of parking,  can  have  deleterious
 health  impacts  on  the  state's  most vulnerable populations. New York
 City's health department has called air pollution a  leading  threat  to
 its residents, and estimated that particulate matter emissions and ozone
 caused  more  than two thousand deaths and eight thousand asthma-related
 emergency room visits every year. New York City has also taken a  number
 of actions available to it to reduce air pollution, including adopting a
 motor vehicle idling enforcement program and attempting to shift commer-
 cial  vehicle  traffic  to bicycles and other alternative transportation
 modes. A residential  parking  permit  system  would  build  upon  those
 efforts and assist in reducing these pollution-related outcomes, and its
 revenues would serve as an investment in the region's public transporta-
 tion system. For these reasons, improving residential parking options by
 facilitating  establishment  of  a  residential  parking  permit  system
 addresses an issue of significant importance to the state and serves  as
 a  bridge  to  a  future in which more public transportation options are
 available for both residents and visitors.
  § 2. Subdivision (a) of section 1642 of the vehicle and traffic law is
 amended by adding a new paragraph 28 to read as follows:
  28. (A) NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,
