  COMMEMORATING the 200th Anniversary of the Town of
  Newfane, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  Bicentennial  Anniversary  of the Town of Newfane, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over thousands of years as Lake Ontario  receded  from  the
land  exposing  marshlands  and  a higher-elevation shoreline of fertile
soil rich with wild cranberries, the first inhabitants to call this land
home were local tribes who made this area  part  of  their  major  trade
route; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ruled  by the Senecas and conquered by the Iroquois, there
are, today, relics of these original tribes still being found from 2,000
years ago in at least 20 sites in  and  around  Newfane,  Eighteen  Mile
Creek, the Ridge and the Lake; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  the Revolutionary War as settlements were expanding
across the frontier, the well-established Ridge Trail  was  named  Ridge
Road when Niagara County was established in 1808; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  covered  wagons  brought  more settlers to the region,
dozens of families began establishing properties in the region when  the
War of 1812 broke out against the British along the Canadian border; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  the  war,  an  influx  of settlers came to the area
determined to build roads  and  convert  marshland  into  farmland,  and
shortly after families set up homes and businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  collection  of  neighborhoods  coalesced  around  the
founding of the Patterson Hotel, built in 1823 by Arthur  Patterson  who
sought  to  incorporate, partnering with Otis Hathaway of Lockport to do
so, and their plan for the town is largely still visible today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Other businessmen contributed to the cause, including James
Van Horn, who offered his home as a meeting place  and  at  one  of  the
meetings his wife, Abigail, requested the town carry the name "New Fane"
and it was adopted in 1824; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the Town of Newfane is over 9,200 people strong with
the  hamlets  of  Appleton,  Burt,  Corwin,  Ridgewood, Newfane, Olcott,
Woodland  Heights,  and  Wrights  Corners,  full  of  friendly  people
passionate about their roots and hopeful about the future; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  town is home to volunteer firefighters,
farmers, businesses, educators, healthcare providers,  public  servants,
 
and  neighbors  looking  after neighbors, celebrating their achievements
and milestones, and working hard to be the best of what America is; and
 
  WHEREAS, Of historic origin, and remaining fruitful over the ebb and
flow  of  decades of growth and change, the Town of Newfane continues to
provide the quintessential quality of life for its residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the able leadership of Supervisor John Syracuse,  the
residents of the Town of Newfane have a bright outlook for the future of
their  community,  which  remains a beautiful place in which to live and
raise a family; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of the Town of Newfane's  rich  history  and
enduring contribution to the State of New York, this Legislative Body is
proud  to  pay  tribute  to  this spirited town upon the occasion of its
200th Anniversary; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  200th  Anniversary of the Town of Newfane, recognizing
the significance of the role it continues to play in  the  life  of  the
community of the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Town of Newfane Supervisor, John Syracuse.
