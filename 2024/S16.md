 provided  that fifty percent of all moneys received by the department of
 state for such fines shall be  payable  to  the  anti-discrimination  in

 vision  four of section four hundred forty-two-h of this article, or for
 a material misstatement in the application for such license, or if  such
 licensee  has  been  guilty  of  fraud  or  fraudulent practices, or for
 dishonest  or misleading advertising, or has demonstrated untrustworthi-
 ness or incompetency to act as a real estate broker or  salesperson,  or
 for  a  violation  of  article fifteen of the executive law committed in
 their capacity as a real estate broker or salesperson, as the  case  may
 be.  UPON A FINDING THAT A BROKER, AGENT OR SALESPERSON HAS VIOLATED THE
 PROVISIONS OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED FORTY-THREE-B OF  THIS  ARTICLE,  THE
 DEPARTMENT  SHALL  IMPOSE  A  FINE  OF  TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FIRST
 VIOLATION AND A FINE OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A SECOND VIOLATION.
 UPON A THIRD VIOLATION OF SUCH SECTION THE DEPARTMENT SHALL  REVOKE  THE
 LICENSE  ISSUED  UNDER THIS ARTICLE. In the case of a real estate broker
 engaged in the business of  a  tenant  relocator,  untrustworthiness  or
 incompetency  shall include engaging in any course of conduct including,
 but not limited to, the  interruption  or  discontinuance  of  essential
 building  service,  that interferes with or disturbs the peace, comfort,
 repose and quiet enjoyment of a tenant.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
