BY: Senator MAYER
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  99th  Anniversary  of  The
  Bronxville Women's Club
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 99th Anniversary of The Bronxville Women's Club,  to  be
celebrated at its "99 Years" event on April 24, 2024, in Bronxville, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Anna  Lawrence Bisland founded The Bronxville Women's Club
in  1925  when  she  organized  representatives  of  various  local
organizations  to  meet,  and with 176 women enrolled, the club was then
established; she additionally was the first president of The  Bronxville
Women's Club; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  first,  The Bronxville Women's Club rented property in
Lawrence Park West for its clubhouse, but soon ran out  of  space;  Anna
Lawrence  Bisland  donated the present site at the corner of Midland and
Tanglewylde Avenues, and, with a  thousand  members  contributing  fifty
dollars each and a mortgage, the building of a new clubhouse began; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Bronxville  Women's Club still operates at the latter
location, and was even registered on the Westchester County Inventory of
Historic Places in 1999 and on the National List of Historic  Places  in
2007; the building itself has been newly named the Anna Lawrence Bisland
1928 House; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Membership  of  The Bronxville Women's Club is open to all
women and men who are interested in a diverse selection of  educational,
cultural,  civic,  health  and  art  programs;  the  club  also  hosts
literature, music, philanthropy, and even children's programs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Theater, social entertainment, lectures and guest speakers,
art sessions, and dance are also pillars of The Bronxville Women's Club;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Philanthropic events hosted by The Bronxville Women's  Club
raise  funds  that  are  distributed  to  local charities and non-profit
organizations, emphasizing the club's commitment to  community  service;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 99th Anniversary of The Bronxville Women's Club; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Bronxville Women's Club.
