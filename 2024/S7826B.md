 AN  ACT to amend the banking law, in relation to mandating acceptance of
  the New York city identity card as a primary form of identification at
  all banking organizations
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "pro-bank-
 ing act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds  and  declares
 that:
  (a) Local law no. 35 for the year 2014 amended subchapter 1 of chapter
 1  of  title  3  of  the  administrative code of the city of New York by
 adding a section  3-115,  creating  the  New  York  city  identity  card
 program.  One of the main objectives of the program was to expand access
 to bank-approved identification cards, thereby reducing  the  number  of
 unbanked residents across the city. In 2015, federal regulatory authori-
 ties  notified  the city agencies in charge of administering the program
 that banks could use the New York city  identity  card  to  satisfy  the
 minimum requirements of federal anti-money laundering laws. In 2016, the
 New  York  State  Department of Financial Services further "encourage[d]
 New York state-chartered and licensed financial institutions  to  accept
 the Municipal ID as a form of acceptable identification card."
  (b) Despite authorization by federal and state regulatory authorities,
 only  approximately  one-third  of  city  banks accept the New York city
 identity card, leaving many city residents on the margins of the  finan-
 cial system. As of 2017, 11.2 percent of households in New York city had
 no bank account and ten neighborhoods accounted for nearly 35 percent of
 those  households. Residents of color, undocumented residents, and resi-
 dents living below the poverty line are disproportionately impacted  and
 are  at  greater risk of falling victim to predatory financial services,

 imperiling their financial futures and aggravating  economic  inequality
 across the state.
  (c) The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that our most vulner-
 able  residents  are  not  cut  off  from  traditional banking services.
 Mandating acceptance of the New York city identity card  at  state-char-
 tered  financial  institutions  will  allow all residents to build their
 financial futures and advance the state's goal of  facilitating  broader
 financial inclusion.
  §  3. The banking law is amended by adding a new section 13 to read as
 follows:
  § 13. ACCEPTANCE OF NEW YORK CITY IDENTITY CARD.  1.  DEFINITIONS.  AS
 USED IN THIS SECTION:
  (A)  "NEW  YORK CITY IDENTITY CARD" REFERS TO THE IDENTITY CARD ISSUED

 ANOTHER  CONTACT  INDIVIDUAL  PURSUANT  TO  31  CFR  §

 INABILITY TO COMPLY THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT FINDS SUFFICIENT.

 of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to
 be invalid and after exhaustion of  all  further  judicial  review,  the
 judgment  shall  not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof,
 but shall be confined in its operation to the  clause,  sentence,  para-
 graph,  section or part of this act directly involved in the controversy
 in which the judgment shall have been rendered.

 it shall have become a law.  Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
