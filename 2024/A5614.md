 for review of such denial pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil
 practice law and rules. In the event that access to any record is denied
 pursuant to the provisions of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of
 this  article, the agency involved shall have the burden of proving that
 such record falls within the provisions of such subdivision two. Failure
 by an agency to conform to the  provisions  of  paragraph  (a)  of  this
 subdivision shall constitute a denial.
  (c) The court in such a proceeding: (i) may assess, against such agen-
 cy  involved,  reasonable  attorney's  fees  and  other litigation costs
 reasonably incurred by such person in any case under the  provisions  of
 this  section in which such person has substantially prevailed, and when
 the agency failed to respond to a request or appeal within the statutory
 time; and (ii) shall assess, against such  agency  involved,  reasonable
 attorney's  fees  and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by such
 person in any case under the provisions of this section  in  which  such
 person  has  substantially prevailed and the court finds that the agency
 had no reasonable basis for denying access] APPEAL TO THE  COMMITTEE  ON

 enforce the provisions of this article against  a  public  body  by  the
 commencement  of  [a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the
 civil practice law and rules, or an action for declaratory judgment  and
 injunctive  relief.  In any such action or proceeding, if a court deter-
 mines that a public body failed to comply with this article,  the  court
 shall  have  the  power,  in  its  discretion, upon good cause shown, to
 declare that the public body violated this article  and/or  declare  the

 A. 5614  6

 court  may  require  the  members of the public body to participate in a
 training session concerning the  obligations  imposed  by  this  article
 conducted by the staff of the committee on open government.

 required by this article shall not alone be grounds for invalidating any
 action taken at a meeting of a public body. The provisions of this arti-
 cle shall not affect the validity  of  the  authorization,  acquisition,
 execution or disposition of a bond issue or notes.

 reasonable attorney fees may be awarded by the court, in its discretion,
 to the successful party. If a court determines that a vote was taken  in
 material  violation  of  this article, or that substantial deliberations
 relating thereto occurred in private prior to such vote, the court shall
 award costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the successful petitioner,
 unless there was a reasonable basis for a public body to believe that  a
 closed session could properly have been held.
  3.  The  statute of limitations in an article seventy-eight proceeding
 with respect to an action taken at executive session shall  commence  to
 run  from  the date the minutes of such executive session have been made
