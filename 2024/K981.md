  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the
  Woodhaven Library on January 7, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
cultural institutions that contribute to the rich history and culture of
our Great State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  100th Anniversary of the Woodhaven Library, celebrated
on Sunday, January 7, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Woodhaven Library in Queens, New  York,  is  a  beloved
community  institution  that  has  served the residents of Woodhaven and
surrounding neighborhoods for a century; and
 
  WHEREAS, The library has played an indispensable role  in  promoting
literacy, knowledge, and lifelong learning, instilling a love of reading
and empowering residents to make informed decisions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Woodhaven  Library  has  been  a  hub  for  diverse
educational, cultural, and  recreational  activities,  offering  crucial
resources,  programs,  and  services  that  have  brought  people  from
different backgrounds together; and
 
  WHEREAS, The library has hosted  its  own  prekindergarten  program,
fostering new generations of scholars; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  the  assistance  offered  by  Woodhaven  Library,
children have excelled in school, immigrants have learned  English,  job
seekers  have  found  their  dream  careers, and people of all ages have
gained computer literacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Plans for the Woodhaven Library began  in  1922,  when  the
Queens  Public  Library  determined  that  the  burgeoning  community of
Woodhaven needed a larger library in order to meet demand; and
 
  WHEREAS, Initially told there were  insufficient  funds  for  a  new
library,  Woodhaven  residents  diligently campaigned until they secured
funding from the City of  New  York  and  the  Queens  Public  Library's
endowment  from  Andrew  Carnegie-a  testament  to  the  dedication  of
Woodhaven residents and their love for their neighborhood that continues
to this day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Construction  of  the  Woodhaven  Library  began  with  the
community  coming  together for a cornerstone laying ceremony on July 7,
1923, and the Woodhaven Library opened its doors on January 7,  1924  at
3:00 P.M.; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Woodhaven Library is truly a homegrown institution: its
architect, Robert F. Schirmer, and builder, Henry Berau of Berau Fraser,
were both Woodhaven residents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The 100th Anniversary of the Woodhaven Library presents an
opportunity to recognize  and  celebrate  the  library's  rich  history,
highlight  its  outstanding  contributions to the community, and inspire
future generations to continue the legacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud and distinguished history, the Woodhaven
Library  may  take  just  pride  in  its  purposeful growth, as it looks
forward  to  continuing  to  serve  the  educational,  cultural  and
intellectual needs of the community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Woodhaven Library;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Woodhaven Library, the President of the Queens Public
Library, and various institutions in Woodhaven.
