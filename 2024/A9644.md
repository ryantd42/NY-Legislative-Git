  § 102. Legislative intent.  William R. Willcox,  Eugenius  H.  Outer-
 bridge  and Murray Hulbert, or any two of them, commissioners heretofore
 appointed under chapter four hundred and twenty-six of the laws of nine-
 teen hundred and seventeen of the state of New York, together  with  the
 attorney-general  of  the  state  of  New York, are hereby authorized as
 commissioners upon the part of the state of New York to enter into, with
 the state of New Jersey, by and through the commissioners  appointed  or
 who  may  be appointed under or by virtue of a law of the legislature of
 the state of New Jersey, an agreement or compact in the form  following,
 that is to say:
  Whereas,  In  the  year eighteen hundred and thirty-four the states of
 New York and New Jersey did enter into an agreement fixing and determin-
 ing the rights and obligations of the two states in and about the waters
 between the two states, especially in and about the bay of New York  and
 the Hudson river; and
  Whereas,  Since  that  time  the  commerce of the port of New York has
 greatly developed and increased and the territory in and around the port
 has become commercially one center or district; and
  Whereas, It is confidently believed that a better co-ordination of the
 terminal, transportation and other facilities of commerce in, about  and
 through the port of New York, will result in great economies, benefiting
 the nation, as well as the states of New York and New Jersey; and
  Whereas,  The  future development of such terminal, transportation and
 other facilities of commerce will require the expenditure of large  sums
 of  money and the cordial co-operation of the states of New York and New
 Jersey in the encouragement of the investment of  capital,  and  in  the
 formulation and execution of the necessary physical plans; and
 A. 9644  6
 
  Whereas, Such result can best be accomplished through the co-operation
 of the two states by and through a joint or common agency.
  Now,  therefore, the said states of New Jersey and New York do supple-
 ment and amend the existing agreement of eighteen  hundred  and  thirty-
 four in the following respects.
  They  agree to and pledge, each to the other, faithful co-operation in

 consist of twelve commissioners, six resident voters from the  state  of
 New  York, at least four of whom shall be resident voters of the city of
 New York, and six resident voters from the state of New Jersey, at least
 four of whom shall be resident voters within the New Jersey  portion  of
 the district, the New York members to be chosen by the state of New York
 and  the New Jersey members by the state of New Jersey in the manner and
 for the terms fixed and determined from time to time by the  legislature
 of  each  state  respectively,  except  as  provided  in this part. Each
 commissioner may be removed or suspended from office as provided by  the
 law of the state from which he or she shall be appointed.
  2.  a.  The  officers  of the port authority shall be a chairperson, a
 vice chairperson, a chief executive officer, a general counsel, a  chief
 financial  officer,  a chief ethics and compliance officer, an inspector
 general, a treasurer, a comptroller, and a secretary. Beginning upon the
 next hiring of a chief executive officer but no later than a  year  from
 the  effective  date  of  this article, the positions of chairperson and
 vice chairperson shall be rotated for a term of two years among  commis-
 sioners appointed by New York and New Jersey, with a chairperson elected
 first  from  among  those commissioners appointed by the governor of New
 York and a vice chairperson elected first from among those commissioners
 appointed by the governor of New Jersey, after  which  the  next  chair-
 person  shall  be  elected from among those appointed by the governor of
 New Jersey and the next vice chairperson shall  be  elected  from  among
 those appointed by the governor of New York and thereafter the positions
 of  chairperson and vice chairperson shall rotate every two years in the
 same order as established herein provided that the failure of the  board
 of  commissioners  to elect a new chairperson and vice chairperson shall
 not prevent the rotation of the positions of chairperson and vice chair-
 person to the next succeeding state.
  b. No commissioner, including the chairperson, shall serve as the port
 authority's chief executive officer, general  counsel,  chief  financial
 officer,  chief  ethics  and  compliance  officer, inspector general, or
 comptroller, or hold any other equivalent position while  serving  as  a
 commissioner.
  3.  a.  The  commissioners  shall  promulgate a commissioner's oath of
 office in consultation with the chief ethics and compliance officer.
  b. At the time that a commissioner of the  port  authority  takes  and
 subscribes the commissioner's oath of office, or within sixty days after
 A. 9644  10
 
 the  effective  date of this subdivision if the commissioner has already
 taken and subscribed the commissioner's oath of office, the commissioner
 shall execute a statement declaring that  the  commissioner  understands
 the  commissioner's  independence  and  fiduciary  obligation to perform
 duties and responsibilities to the best of the commissioner's abilities,
 in good faith and with proper diligence and  care  which  an  ordinarily
 prudent  person  in  like position would use under similar circumstances
 and may take into consideration the views and policies  of  any  elected
 officials  or  bodies  and  ultimately apply independent judgment in the
 best interest of the  port  authority,  its  mission,  and  the  public,
 consistent  with  the enabling compact, mission, and by-laws of the port
 authority and the applicable laws of both states; and that the fiduciary
 duty to the port authority is derived from and governed by its mission.
  c. Individuals appointed to the board of commissioners  shall  partic-
 ipate in training approved by the chief ethics and compliance officer in
 consultation  with the inspector general of the port authority regarding
 their legal, fiduciary, financial and ethical responsibilities as direc-
 tors of an authority within six months of appointment to the  authority.
 The  commissioners  shall  participate  in continuing training as may be
 required to remain informed of best practices, regulatory and  statutory
 changes relating to the effective oversight of the management and finan-
 cial activities of public authorities and to adhere to the highest stan-
 dards of responsible governance.
  d. (1) A commissioner shall not vote on or participate in any board or
 committee  discussions  or  decisions  with  respect  to  an item if the
 commissioner, a member of the  commissioner's  immediate  family,  or  a
 business in which the commissioner has an interest has a direct or indi-
 rect financial involvement that may reasonably be expected to impair the
 commissioner's  objectivity  or independent judgment or that may reason-
 ably create the appearance of impropriety.  A commissioner shall  report
 such  a  need  for  recusal  to the general counsel when it arises.  The
 public shall be informed of any recusals prior to any board  action  and
 the minutes shall clearly reflect that recusal.
  (2) For the purposes of this subdivision, the terms:
  (i)  "immediate  family"  shall  mean:  a  spouse,  parent,  child, or
 sibling; and
  (ii) "interest" shall mean: (A) if  the  business  organization  is  a

 member or the board member's  immediate  family  owns  or  controls  ten
 percent or more of the stock of the corporation, or serves as a director
 or officer of the corporation.

 previous  year,  exceeds  $150,000,  which  amount shall be adjusted for
 inflation annually in accordance with the consumer price index  for  all
 urban  wage  earners  and  clerical workers (CPI-W) as calculated by the
 federal government. These financial disclosures  shall  be  updated  not
 less  than  annually and shall be made available on the port authority's
 website.
  f. The board of commissioners shall:
  (1) adopt a mission statement that the port authority's mission is  to

 sioners and/or any law enforcement authority.

 action;
  d. The inspector general shall  prepare  and  make  available  to  the

 authority shall arrange for an  independent  firm  of  certified  public
 accountants  to perform an audit of the financial statements of the port
 authority each year, in accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting
 principles  and standards referenced in paragraph a of this subdivision.

 authority  shall  be  required  to  make a written certification to that
 effect that, to the best of their knowledge and  belief,  the  financial

 aration of the consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with
 generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and standards referenced in
 paragraph a of this subdivision.
  d. Notwithstanding any other provision of law  to  the  contrary,  the

 other person serving in an equivalent position for  the  authority,  was
 employed  by  that  independent firm of certified public accountants and
 participated in any capacity in the audit of the  authority  during  the
 one year period preceding the date of the initiation of the audit.
  3.  The  port  authority  shall  make accessible to the public via its
 website an executive summary of its most recent independent audit report
 unless such information is exempt from  disclosure  pursuant  to  either
 state's freedom of information laws.
  § 113. Property disposition, debt issuance, capitol plan and operating
 budget.  1.  Any  sale of real property by the port authority shall be
 undertaken and conducted pursuant to the provisions of the existing laws
 governing the sale of real property by the port authority in  the  state
 in  which  such real property is located and by approval of the board of
 commissioners.
  a. No disposition of real property, or any interest in real  property,
 shall be made unless an appraisal of the value of such real property has
 been  made by an independent appraiser and included in the record of the
 transaction, and, provided further, that no  disposition  of  any  other
 real  property, which because of its unique nature or the unique circum-
 stances of the proposed transaction is not readily valued  by  reference
 A. 9644  20
 
 to  an  active market for similar real property, shall be made without a
 similar appraisal.
  b. Disposal of real property for less than fair market value. No prop-
 erty  owned,  leased,  or otherwise in the control of the port authority
 may be sold, leased, or otherwise  alienated  for  less  than  its  fair
 market value unless:
  (1)  the  transferee  is  a government or other public entity, and the
 terms and conditions of the transfer require that the ownership and  use
 of the real property will remain with the government or any other public
 entity; or
  (2)  the  purpose  of  the transfer is within the purpose, mission, or
 governing statute of the port authority and a written  determination  is
 made  by the board of commissioners that there is no reasonable alterna-
 tive to the proposed below-market transfer that would achieve  the  same
 purpose of such transfer, prior to board approval of such a transfer.
  c.  The  board shall adopt, within six months of the effective date of
 this article, appropriate rules and regulations concerning  disposition,
 acquisition, and transfer of real property or any interest in real prop-
 erty by the port authority which shall, at a minimum, include a require-
 ment  that  the  following information be made available to the board of
 commissioners at the meeting  where  approval  of  such  a  disposition,
 acquisition or transfer is scheduled:
  (1) a full description of the property;
  (2)  a  description of the purpose of the disposition, acquisition, or
 transfer;
  (3) a statement of the value to be received from such  a  disposition,
 acquisition, or transfer;
  (4) the names of any private parties participating in the disposition,
 acquisition, or transfer; and
  (5)  in  the  case of a property disposition for less than fair market
 value, an explanation and  a  written  determination  by  the  board  of
 commissioners  that  there  is no reasonable alternative to the proposed
 below-market value that would achieve the same purpose of such  disposi-
 tion.
  d.  Not  less  than ten days in advance of any meeting of the board of
 commissioners of the port authority at which the board of  commissioners
 is to consider an action to authorize the sale of real property owned by
 the  port  authority,  the chief executive officer of the port authority
 shall provide public notice of such proposed action along with  relevant
 material  terms  and  provisions of such sale including, but not limited
 to, the information made available  pursuant  to  paragraph  c  of  this
 subdivision, by posting on the port authority's website.
  e.  The chief executive officer may authorize or arrange for contracts
 for the sale of personal property owned by the port authority or arrange
 for contracts for the sale  of  personal  property  owned  by  the  port
 authority  upon such terms and conditions as the chief executive officer
 may deem proper and execute the same on behalf  of  the  port  authority
 where  the  value  of  such  personal  property  is not in excess of one
 million dollars; provided, however, that  personal  property  valued  at
 more than $250,000 shall not be sold by authority of the chief executive
 officer  other  than  to  the highest bidder after public advertisement.
 Where the value of such personal property is in  excess  of  $1,000,000,
 the sale of such property must be authorized by the board of commission-
 ers  of the port authority upon such terms as the board of commissioners
 may deem proper.
 A. 9644  21
 
  f. The port authority may retain brokers or third-party  vendors  that
 facilitate  online  auctions, or assist in disposing of surplus real and
 personal property of the port authority.
  2. a. The issuance of any bonds, notes or other instruments of indebt-
 edness  by the port authority shall be undertaken in a manner consistent
 with applicable laws governing the port authority and covenants with the
 holders of the port authority's bonds, notes  or  other  instruments  of
 indebtedness.
  b.  At  least sixty days prior to the end of its fiscal year, the port
 authority shall submit to the governor, state comptroller, and  legisla-
 ture  of  each state a statement of intent in regards to the issuance of
 and overall amount of bonds, notes, or  other  debt  obligations  antic-
 ipated,  at  the time the statement is submitted, during the next fiscal
 year.
  3. The port authority shall adopt a  ten-year  capital  plan  that  is
 developed  using a comprehensive planning process and risk-based priori-
 tization that considers asset condition, operational and revenue impact,
 threat assessment, customer service, regional benefit, and regulatory or
 statutory requirements. The capital plan shall  be  dependent  upon  the
 availability  of  sufficient  funding  and other resources to pursue the
 capital projects proposed for the ten-year period. Performance  progress
 and  revisions to reflect changes in programs, policies and projects and
 the environment in which the port authority operates shall  be  reviewed
 regularly  by  a committee designated by the board of commissioners, and
 the capital plan shall be revised periodically as necessary  and  appro-
 priate,  and shall be reviewed with the board of commissioners annually.
 The port authority shall publish an annual report on the status  of  the
 capital  program and such report shall be made publicly available on the
 port authority's website. Prior to adoption of a capital plan, the  port
 authority  shall make such proposed plan available for public review and
 comments on its public website for at least two weeks prior to approval,
 and all comments received are to be distributed to the board of  commis-
 sioners for review prior to consideration of the capital plan.
  4. The port authority shall prepare a detailed annual operating budget
 beginning  with the fiscal year after the enactment into law legislation
 having identical effect by the state of New Jersey.  A preliminary annu-
 al operating budget shall be made publicly available on the port author-
 ity's website in July of every fiscal year and a final annual  operating
 budget shall be made publicly available in February of each fiscal year.
  §  114.  State of emergency; domestic companion animal.  1. a. For the
 purposes of this section:
  (1) "Domestic companion animal" means a companion  animal  or  pet  as
 defined  in  section  three hundred fifty of the agriculture and markets
 law and shall also mean any other  domesticated  animal  normally  main-
 tained  in  or  near  the household of the owner or person who cares for
 such other domesticated animal. "Pet" or "companion  animal"  shall  not
 include  a  "farm  animal," as defined in section three hundred fifty of
 the agriculture and markets law.
  (2) "Public transportation or  public  transportation  service"  means
 rail  passenger  service,  motorbus  regular  route service, paratransit
 service, motorbus charter service, and ferry passenger service.
  b. (1) In the event that a state of emergency has been declared and an
 evacuation of any region of the state is in progress,  the  owner  of  a
 domestic  companion animal shall be permitted to board any public trans-
 portation or public transportation service with the  domestic  companion
 animal  so  long as that animal is under the owner's control by use of a
 A. 9644  22
 
 leash or tether, or is properly confined in an appropriate container  or
 by  other  suitable  means, provided that such boarding is authorized by
 and consistent with the provisions of state disaster emergency plans  or
 local  state  of  emergency plans pertaining to the needs of animals and
 individuals with an animal under their  care.  The  provisions  of  this
 article shall only apply to the owners of domestic companion animals who
 are  evacuating  from a region of the state affected by the emergency or
 local disaster emergency as defined in section twenty of  the  executive
 law, or a local state of emergency, as defined in section twenty-four of
 the executive law.
  (2) A domestic companion animal may be refused permission to board any
 public  transportation  or  public  transportation  service, even if the
 animal is under the owner's control or properly confined  in  accordance
 with this paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that, due to
 attendant  circumstances,  permitting  the  animal to board would pose a
 health or safety hazard.
  c. All passengers with service animals shall be given priority seating
 on all means of transportation regulated by this article  in  accordance
 with  the  federal  "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C.
 s.12101 et seq.). For the purposes of  this  article,  "service  animal"
 shall  have the same meaning as set forth in the federal "Americans with
 Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s.12101  et  seq.)  and  any  regu-
 lations under the act.
  d.  All  passengers on any public transportation or public transporta-
 tion service shall be  provided  seating  before  a  domestic  companion
 animal may be placed in a seat.
  2.  The  port  authority is hereby authorized to make and enforce such
 rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of this section.
  § 115. Public meetings.  1. The legislature finds  and  declares  that
 the  right of the public to be present at meetings of the port authority
 of New York and New Jersey, and to witness in full detail all phases  of
 the deliberation, policy formulation, and decision making of the author-
 ity, is vital to the enhancement and proper functioning of the democrat-
 ic  process,  and that secrecy in public affairs undermines the faith of
 the public in government and the public's  effectiveness  in  fulfilling
 its role in a democratic society; and declares it to be the public poli-
 cy  of  this  state to insure the right of its citizens to have adequate
 advance notice of and the right to attend all meetings of the  authority
 at which any business affecting the public is discussed or acted upon in
 any  way  except  only in those circumstances where otherwise the public
 interest would be clearly endangered or the personal privacy of  guaran-
 teed  rights  of  individuals  would be clearly in danger of unwarranted
 invasion.
  2.  The board shall, within six months of the enactment  into  law  of
 legislation having an identical effort by the state of New Jersey, adopt
 appropriate rules and regulations concerning proper notice to the public
 and  the  news media of its meetings and the right of the public and the
 news media to be present at meetings of the  authority.  The  board  may
 incorporate  in  its rules and regulations conditions under which it may
 exclude the public from a meeting or a portion thereof.
  3. Any rules or regulations adopted hereunder shall become a  part  of
 the  minutes  of the port authority of New York and New Jersey and shall
 be subject to the approval of the governor of New Jersey and the  gover-
 nor of New York.
  4. Unless and until otherwise determined by the action of the legisla-
 tures  of the two states, no action of the port authority shall be bind-
 A. 9644  23
 
 ing unless taken at a meeting at which at least  three  of  the  members
 from  each  state are present, and unless a majority of the members from
 each state present at such meeting but in any event at  least  three  of
 the  members  from  each  state, shall vote in favor thereof. Each state
 reserves the right to provide by law for the exercise of a veto power by
 the governor thereof over any action of any commissioner appointed ther-
 efrom.
  § 116. Minutes of public meetings.  1. The port authority  shall  file

 speaker and minority leader of the assembly, the chairman of the  assem-
 bly  ways  and  means  committee  and the chairman of the senate finance
 committee of the state of New York and the  president,  minority  leader
 and  secretary  of the senate and the speaker, minority leader and clerk
 of the general assembly of the state of New Jersey a copy of the minutes
 of any action taken at any public meeting of the  port  authority.  Such
 filing shall be made on the same day such minutes are transmitted to the
 governor  of  each  state for review; and notice of such filing shall be
 provided to the governor of each state at  the  same  time.  Failure  to
 effectuate any such filing shall not impair the ability of the authority
 to  act  pursuant  to  a  resolution of its board. Such filing shall not
 apply to any minutes required to be filed pursuant to section twenty  of
 former  chapter  six  hundred  fifty-one of the laws of nineteen hundred
 seventy-eight and continued by part XXVII of this article.
  2. The temporary president and minority  leader  of  the  senate,  the
 speaker  and minority leader of the assembly, the chairman of the assem-
 bly ways and means committee and the  chairman  of  the  senate  finance
 committee  of  the state of New York and the speaker and minority leader
 of the general assembly and the president and the minority leader of the
 senate of the state of New Jersey, or representatives designated by them
 in writing for this purpose, may by certificate filed with the secretary
 of the port  authority  waive  the  foregoing  filing  requirement  with
 respect to any specific minutes.
  §  117.  Jurisdiction.  Unless and until otherwise provided, all laws
 now or hereafter vesting jurisdiction or control in the  public  service
 commission,  or  the  public  utilities commission, or like body, within
 each state respectively, shall apply to railroads and to any transporta-
 tion, terminal or other facility owned, operated, leased or  constructed
 by  the  port authority, with the same force and effect as if such rail-
 road, or transportation, terminal or other facility were owned,  leased,
 operated or constructed by a private corporation.
  §  118.  Powers  of  municipalities  to  develop or improve.  Nothing
 contained in this agreement shall impair the powers of any  municipality
 to develop or improve port and terminal facilities.
  §  119.  Comprehensive  development.  1. The legislatures of the two
 states, prior to the signing of this agreement, or thereafter as soon as
 may be practicable, will adopt a plan or  plans  for  the  comprehensive
 development of the port of New York.
  2.  The  port  authority  shall  from  time to time make plans for the
 development of the port of New York district, supplementary to or  amen-
 datory  of  any  plan  theretofore adopted, and when such plans are duly
 approved by the legislatures of the two states, they  shall  be  binding
 upon  both  states  with the same force and effect as if incorporated in
 this chapter.
  3. The port authority may petition any interstate commerce  commission
 (or like body), commissioner of transportation, public utilities commis-
 sion  (or  like  body),  or any other federal, municipal, state or local
 A. 9644  24
 
 authority, administrative, judicial or legislative, having  jurisdiction
 in  the  premises,  after  the  adoption  of  the  comprehensive plan as
 provided for in subdivision one of this section, for  the  adoption  and
 execution  of any physical improvement, change in method, rate of trans-
 portation, system of handling freight, warehousing, docking,  lightering
 or transfer of freight, which, in the opinion of the port authority, may
 be designed to improve or better the handling of commerce in and through
 the  port  of  New York district, or improve terminal and transportation
 facilities therein. It may intervene in  any  proceeding  affecting  the
 commerce of the port.
  § 120. Recommendations.  The port authority may from time to time make
 recommendations to the legislatures of the two states or to the congress
 of  the  United  States,  based  upon study and analysis, for the better
 conduct of the commerce passing in and through the port of New York, the
 increase and improvement of transportation and terminal facilities ther-
 ein, and the more economical and expeditious handling of such commerce.
  § 121. Expense of operations.  1. Unless and until the  revenues  from
 operations  conducted  by  the  port  authority are adequate to meet all
 expenditures, the legislatures of the two states shall  appropriate,  in
 equal  amounts, annually, for the salaries, office and other administra-
 tive expenses, such sum or sums as shall  be  recommended  by  the  port
 authority  and  approved  by  the  governors of the two states, but each
 state obligates itself hereunder only to the extent of one hundred thou-
 sand dollars in any one year.
  2. Unless and until otherwise determined by the action of the legisla-
 tures of the two states, the port authority shall not  incur  any  obli-
 gations  for  salaries,  office or other administrative expenses, within
 the provisions of subdivision one of this section, prior to  the  making
 of appropriations adequate to meet the same.
  §  122.  Port  authority as an agency.  Notwithstanding any law to the
 contrary, the port authority shall be deemed an "agency" and treated  as
 such under the laws of New York, for all purposes under articles six and
 six-A  of the public officers law, and shall be deemed a "public agency"
 and treated as such under New Jersey, P.L. 1963,  c.  73  (C.47:1A-1  et
 seq.), pertaining to the disclosure of government records.
  § 123. Notice of claim.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to
 the contrary, every action against the authority for damages or injuries
 to  real  or  personal  property, or for the destruction thereof, or for
 personal injuries or wrongful death shall  not  be  commenced  unless  a
 notice  of  claim  shall have been served on the authority in the manner
 provided for in the state where the action is commenced, and in  compli-
 ance  with  the  pertinent  statutes  of the state relating generally to
 actions commenced against that state and  in  compliance  with  all  the
 requirements  of  the laws of that state. Where such state's law permits
 service upon a department of that state in  lieu  of  service  upon  the
 public  entity,  service  may be made pursuant to such law. Except in an
 action for wrongful death against such an entity, an action for  damages
 or  for  injuries  to  real or personal property, or for the destruction
 thereof, or for personal injuries, alleged to have been sustained, shall
 not be commenced more than one year and ninety days after the  cause  of
 action  therefor  shall have accrued or within the time period otherwise
 prescribed by any special provision of law of that state,  whichever  is
 longer.
  §  124.  Regulations.  1. The port authority is hereby authorized to
 make suitable rules and regulations not inconsistent with the  constitu-
 tion  of  the United States or of either state, and subject to the exer-
 A. 9644  25
 
 cise of the power of congress, for the improvement  of  the  conduct  of
 navigation  and  commerce, which, when concurred in or authorized by the
 legislatures of both states, shall be binding  and  effective  upon  all
 persons and corporations affected thereby.
  2. The two states shall provide penalties for violations of any order,
 rule  or regulation of the port authority, and for the manner of enforc-
 ing the same.

  DEVELOPMENT OF THE PORT OF NEW YORK
 Section 201. Development of the port of New York.
  202. Investigations.
  203. Hearings.
  204. Orders.
  205. Terminal stations.
  206. Preference.
  § 201. Development of the port of New York.  1. Pursuant  to  subdivi-
 sion  two  of section one hundred seven of this article the following be
 and is hereby adopted as the comprehensive plan for the  development  of
 the port of New York:
  (a)  That  terminal  operations  within  the  port district, so far as
 economically practicable, should be unified;
  (b) That there should be consolidation of shipments at proper  classi-
 fication  points  so  as to eliminate duplication of effort, inefficient
 loading of equipment and realize reduction in expenses;
  (c) That there should be the most direct routing of all commodities so
 as to avoid centers of congestion, conflicting currents and long  truck-
 hauls;
  (d)  That  terminal  stations established under the comprehensive plan
 should be union stations, so far as practicable;
  (e) That the process of coordinating facilities should so far as prac-
 ticable adapt existing facilities as integral parts of the  new  system,
 so  as  to avoid needless destruction of existing capital investment and
 reduce so far as may be possible the requirements for new  capital;  and
 endeavor  should  be  made to obtain the consent of local municipalities
 within the port district for  the  coordination  of  their  present  and
 contemplated port and terminal facilities with the whole plan.
  (f)  That  freight  from all railroads must be brought to all parts of
 the port wherever practicable  without  cars  breaking  bulk,  and  this
 necessitates  tunnel  connection between New Jersey and Long Island, and
 tunnel or bridge connections between other parts of the port;
  (g) That there should be urged upon the federal  authorities  improve-
 ment  of  channels  so  as  to  give  access for that type of waterborne
 commerce adapted to the various forms of development which  the  respec-
 tive  shorefronts  and  adjacent lands of the port would best lend them-
 selves to;
  (h) That highways for motor truck traffic should be laid out so as  to
 permit  the  most  efficient inter-relation between terminals, piers and
 industrial establishments not equipped with railroad sidings and for the
 distribution of building materials and many other commodities which must
 be handled by  trucks;  these  highways  to  connect  with  existing  or
 projected bridges, tunnels and ferries.
  (i)  That  definite  methods for prompt relief should be devised which
 can be applied for the better coordination  and  operation  of  existing
 facilities while larger and more comprehensive plans for future develop-
 ment are being carried out.
 A. 9644  26
 
  2.  The bridges, tunnels and belt lines forming the comprehensive plan
 are generally and in outline indicated on maps filed by the port of  New
 York  authority  in  the offices of the secretaries of the states of New
 York and New Jersey and are hereinafter described in outline.
  3.  (a)  A  tunnel  or tunnels connecting the New Jersey shore and the
 Brooklyn shore of New York to provide through  line  connection  between
 the  transcontinental railroads now having their terminals in New Jersey
 with the Long Island railroad and the New York  connecting  railroad  on
 Long  Island and with the New York Central and Hudson River railroad and
 the New York, New Haven and Hartford  railroad  in  the  Bronx,  and  to
 provide  continuous transportation of freight between the Queens, Brook-
 lyn and Bronx sections of the port to and from all parts of the westerly
 section of the port, for all of the transcontinental railroads.
  (b) A bridge and/or tunnel across or under the Arthur kill, and/or the
 existing bridge enlarged, to provide direct freight carriage between New
 Jersey and Staten Island.
  (c) The location of all such tunnels or bridges to be at the shortest,
 most accessible and most economical points practicable,  taking  account
 of  existing facilities now located within the port district and provid-
 ing for and taking account of all reasonably foreseeable  future  growth
 in all parts of the district.
  4.  The  island of Manhattan to be connected with New Jersey by bridge
 or tunnel, or both, and freight destined to and  from  Manhattan  to  be
 carried  underground,  so  far as practicable, by such system, automatic
 electric as hereinafter described or otherwise, as will furnish the most
 expeditious, economical and practicable transportation of freight, espe-
 cially meat, produce, milk and other commodities  comprising  the  daily
 needs  of  the  people. Suitable markets, union inland terminal stations
 and warehouses to be laid out at points most convenient to the homes and
 industries upon the island, the said system to be connected with all the
 trans-continental railroads terminating in New Jersey and by appropriate
 connection with the New York Central and Hudson River railroad, the  New

 A. 9644  29
 
  7.  The  right  to  add to, modify or change any part of the foregoing
 comprehensive plan is reserved by each state, with  the  concurrence  of
 the other.
  8. The port of New York authority is hereby authorized and directed to
 proceed  with the development of the port of New York in accordance with
 said comprehensive plan as rapidly as may  be  economically  practicable
 and  is  hereby  vested  with  all  necessary and appropriate powers not
 inconsistent with the constitution of the United  States  or  of  either
 state, to effectuate the same, except the power to levy taxes or assess-
 ments.  It  shall request the congress of the United States to make such
 appropriations for deepening and widening  channels  and  to  make  such
 grants of power as will enable the said plan to be effectuated. It shall
 have  power  to  apply to all federal agencies, including the interstate
 commerce commission, the war department, and the United States  shipping
 board, for suitable assistance in carrying out said plan. It shall coop-
 erate  with  the state highway commissioners of each state so that trunk
 line highways as and when laid out by each state shall fit in with  said
 comprehensive  plan. It shall render such advice, suggestion and assist-
 ance to all municipal officials as will permit all local  and  municipal
 port and harbor improvements, so far as practicable, to fit in with said
 plan.  All  municipalities within the district are hereby authorized and
 empowered to cooperate in the effectuation of said plan, and are  hereby
 vested with such powers as may be appropriate or necessary so to cooper-
 ate. The bonds or other securities issued by the port authority shall at
 all  times  be  free  from taxation by either state.  The port authority
 shall be regarded as the municipal corporate instrumentality of the  two
 states  for  the  purpose  of  developing  the port and effectuating the
 pledge of the states in the said compact, but it shall have no power  to
 pledge  the  credit  of  either  state  or to impose any obligation upon
 either state, or upon any municipality, except as and when such power is
 expressly granted by statute, or the consent by any such municipality is
 given.
  § 202. Investigations.  1. (a) To facilitate the determination of  the
 economic practicability of any step in the comprehensive plan, or of any
 other  fact  or  matter  which  the  port  authority  is  authorized and
 empowered to decide or determine, the port authority may conduct  inves-
 tigations,  inquiries  or  hearings  at such place or places and at such
 times as it shall appoint.  Such investigations, inquiries  or  hearings
 may  be  held  by or before one or more of the commissioners of the port
 authority, or by or before any person or persons appointed as its repre-
 sentative, and when ratified, approved or confirmed by the port authori-
 ty on its action shall be and be deemed to be the investigation, inquiry
 or hearing of the port authority.
  (b) For the purpose of such investigations, inquiries or hearings, and
 of such other action or powers as the port authority may  be  authorized
 or  empowered to take or exercise, it shall have jurisdiction of any and
 all persons, associations, or corporations, residing in,  or  acting  or
 existing under or by virtue of the laws of, or owning property or coming
 within this state.
  2. The port authority shall have the power to compel the attendance of
 witnesses  and  the  production of any papers, books or other documents,
 and to administer oaths to all witnesses who may be  called  before  it.
 Subpoenas issued by the port authority shall be signed by a commissioner
 or  by the secretary of the port authority. No witness subpoenaed at the
 instance of parties other than the port authority shall be  entitled  to
 compensation  therefrom  for  attendance or travel, but the cost thereof
 A. 9644  30
 
 shall be borne by the party at whose instance the witness  is  summoned,
 unless the port authority otherwise orders. A subpoena issued under this
 section  shall  be  regulated by the civil practice law and rules of the
 state of New York.
  § 203. Hearings.  1. All hearings before the port authority, including
 the  taking  of  testimony, shall be governed by rules to be adopted and
 prescribed by it.
  2. In any investigation, inquiry or hearing before the port authority,
 a commissioner or an officer conducting the  investigation,  inquiry  or
 hearing may confer immunity in accordance with the provisions of section
 50.20 of the criminal procedure law of the state of New York.
  3. No commissioner or employee of the port authority shall be required
 to give testimony in any civil suit to which the port authority is not a
 party with regard to information obtained by him in the discharge of his
 or her official duty.
  §  204. Orders.  1. Every order of the port authority shall be served
 upon every person, association or corporation to  be  affected  thereby,
 either by personal delivery of a certified copy thereof, or by mailing a
 certified copy thereof, in a sealed package with postage prepaid, to the
 person  to  be  affected thereby; or in the case of a corporation to any
 officer or agent thereof upon whom a summons  might  be  served,  either
 within  or  without  the  state, in accordance with law. It shall be the
 duty of every person, association or corporation,  to  notify  the  port
 authority forthwith, in writing, of the receipt of the certified copy of
 every  order  so served, and in the case of a corporation such notifica-
 tion must be signed and acknowledged by a person or officer duly author-
 ized by the corporation to admit such service. Within a  time  specified
 in  the  order of the port authority, such person, association or corpo-
 ration, upon whom it is served, must, if so required in the order, noti-
 fy the port authority in like manner whether the terms of the order  are
 accepted  and  will  be  obeyed. Every order of the port authority shall
 take effect at a time therein specified  and  shall  continue  in  force
 either for a period which may be designated therein, or until changed or
 abrogated  by  the  port authority, unless such order be unauthorized by
 law, or be in violation of a provision of the constitution of the state,
 or of the United States.
  2. No order staying or suspending an order of the port authority shall
 be made by any court otherwise than upon notice and after  hearing,  and
 if  the  order  of the port authority is suspended, the order suspending
 the same shall contain a specific finding based upon evidence  submitted
 to the court and identified by reference thereto that great and irrepar-
 able  damage would otherwise result to the petitioner and specifying the
 nature of the damage.
  3. (a) Whenever the port authority shall be of the  opinion  that  any
 person,  association or corporation subject to its jurisdiction is fail-
 ing or omitting, or about to fail or omit to do anything required of  it
 by  the laws governing the development and regulation of the port of New
 York, or by its order, or is doing  or  is  about  to  do  anything,  or
 permitting,  or  about  to permit anything to be done contrary to, or in
 violation of, such law or orders, it shall direct  its  legal  represen-
 tative  to  commence  an  action  or  proceeding in the name of the port
 authority, in an appropriate court having jurisdiction, for the  purpose
 of  having  such  violations,  or  threatened  violations,  stopped  and
 prevented either by mandamus or injunction. Such an action or proceeding
 may be brought in the supreme court of this state, and  the  said  court
 shall  have  and is hereby given the necessary and appropriate jurisdic-
 A. 9644  31
 
 tion to grant mandamus or injunction, as the case may  require,  or  any
 other relief appropriate to the case.
  (b)  Failure  of such person, association or corporation to notify the
 port authority, as required in the preceding section, of its  acceptance
 of  and willingness to obey any order of the port authority shall be and
 be deemed to be prima facie  proof  that  such  person,  association  or
 corporation  is  guilty  of such violation, or threatened violation. The
 legal representative of the port authority shall begin  such  action  or
 proceeding  by  a  petition  to  the  appropriate  court,  alleging  the
 violation complained of and praying for appropriate  relief  by  way  of
 mandamus  or  injunction. If the petition is directed to a court of this
 state, it shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify the  time,
 not  exceeding  twenty days after the service of a copy of the petition,
 within which the person, association or corporation complained  of  must
 answer  the petition. In case of default in answer, or after answer, the
 court shall immediately inquire into the  facts  and  circumstances,  in
 such manner as the court shall direct, without other or formal pleadings
 and  without  respect  to any technical requirement. Such other persons,
 associations or corporations as the court shall deem necessary or proper
 to join as parties, in order to make its order, judgment or writs effec-
 tive, may be joined as parties upon application of the  legal  represen-
 tative  of  the port authority. The final judgment in any such action or
 proceeding shall either dismiss the action or proceeding, or direct that
 a writ of mandamus, or an injunction, or both, issue as  prayed  for  in
 the  petition, or in such modified or other form as the court may deter-
 mine will afford the appropriate relief.
  4. (a) Whenever the port authority, after opportunity to  the  parties
 affected or to be affected thereby to be heard, shall determine any fact
 or  matter  which  it  is authorized by any law to hear or determine, or
 that any step in the effectuation of the comprehensive plan is or in the
 near future will be economically practicable, it shall make its findings
 in writing, setting forth its reasons therefor, and such findings  shall
 be  and be deemed to be a determination by the port authority, under and
 pursuant to law. Upon such determination an  appropriate  order  may  be
 entered  by the port authority and be made effective and may be enforced
 as herein provided.
  (b) If such findings or determination shall require the use of  exist-
 ing  facilities or any part thereof described in the law, owned or oper-
 ated by any carrier or carriers, then the port authority may  order  and
 require the carrier or carriers owning or operating said railroad facil-
 ities or part thereof to permit the use of such facilities or part ther-
 eof upon the payment of reasonable compensation therefor. If the carrier
 or  carriers affected or to be affected by such order shall not be able,
 within the time to be specified in its order by the port  authority,  to
 agree  among  themselves upon the compensation to be paid by a user to a
 proprietor or operator for the use of such existing facilities  or  part
 thereof,  then the port authority shall make determination of the amount
 to be paid by the user to the proprietary carrier  or  carriers,  taking
 all  the  facts and circumstances into account, including the public use
 to which such facilities have been put; or,  at  its  option,  the  port
 authority  may  apply  to  the  supreme court of this state, either in a
 separate proceeding or in  proceedings  by  mandamus  or  injunction  to
 enforce  its order, to fix and determine the fair and reasonable compen-
 sation to be paid by the user to the proprietary carrier or carriers for
 such use. If any carrier shall be dissatisfied with the findings of  the
 port  authority in the matter of the compensation to be paid for the use
 A. 9644  32
 
 of any existing facility, it shall have the right to review the same  in
 the  supreme  court  of this state by taking appropriate proceedings for
 such review within sixty days from the service of the order of the  port
 authority, but pending such review the order for the use of such facili-
 ties  shall  be  operative, the determination of the compensation by the
 court to relate back to the time  of  the  commencement  of  such  user,
 unless  the court shall for good and proper reasons enjoin the operation
 of such order.
  § 205. Terminal stations.  If, in the determination of steps to effec-
 tuate the comprehensive plan, the port authority  shall  determine  that
 one  or  more  union  terminal stations are then, or in the near future,
 economically practicable, it shall call a conference of all the carriers
 affected or to be affected by the  use  of  such  terminal  stations  or
 station  and  shall submit to them a plan or plans for the construction,
 maintenance and use thereof.  If the carriers or any of them shall  fail
 or  refuse  to  agree  upon such plan, the port authority shall make and
 certify its findings and conclusions to the supreme court of this state,
 and the said court is vested with appropriate and adequate  jurisdiction
 to  determine  whether  or not such plan or plans for a union station or
 stations effectuate the comprehensive plan, and to make such  conditions
 and  impose such terms as will carry out the same in accordance with the
 principles embraced in the comprehensive plan and the laws governing the
 same.
  § 206. Preference.  All actions and proceedings  to  which  the  port
 authority may be a party and in which any question arises under the laws
 relating to the port authority, or under or concerning any of its orders
 or  actions,  shall  be  preferred  over  all other civil causes, except
 election causes, in all courts of this state  and  shall  be  heard  and
 determined  in  preference  to all other civil business pending therein,
 except election causes, irrespective of position on  the  calendar.  The
 same preference shall be granted upon application of the legal represen-
 tative of the port authority, in any action or proceeding in which he or
 she may be allowed to intervene.
  PART III
  BRIDGES AND TUNNELS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY
 
 Section 301. Legislative intent.
  302. Tunnels.
  303. Bridges.
  304. Studies and reporting.
  305. Inspections.
  306. Construction, maintenance and operation.
  307. Rules and regulations relating to tunnels and bridges.
  308. Bonds.
  309. Compact.
  §  301.  Legislative  intent.  The state of New Jersey by appropriate
 legislation concurring herein, the states of New  York  and  New  Jersey
 hereby  declare  and  agree that the vehicular traffic moving across the
 interstate waters within the port of New York district, created  by  the
 compact  of  April thirty, nineteen hundred twenty-one, between the said
 states, which said phrase "interstate waters" as used in this part shall
 include the portion of the Hudson river within the said port of New York
 district north of the New Jersey state line, constitutes a general move-
 ment of traffic  which  follows  the  most  accessible  and  practicable
 routes,  and  that  the users of each bridge or tunnel over or under the
 said waters benefit by the existence of every  other  bridge  or  tunnel
 A. 9644  33
 
 since all such bridges and tunnels as a group facilitate the movement of
 such  traffic  and relieve congestion at each of the several bridges and
 tunnels.  Accordingly the two said states, in the interest of the  users
 of  such  bridges  and tunnels and the general public, hereby agree that
 the construction, maintenance, operation and control of all such bridges
 and tunnels, heretofore or hereafter authorized by the two said  states,
 shall be unified under the port authority, to the end that the tolls and
 other  revenues  therefrom shall be applied so far as practicable to the
 costs of the construction, maintenance and operation of said bridges and
 tunnels as a group and economies in operation  effected,  it  being  the
 policy  of  the two said states that such bridges and tunnels shall as a
 group be in all respects self-sustaining.
  § 302. Tunnels. 1.  In furtherance of the  policy  stated  in  section
 three  hundred  one  of  this  part,  and in partial effectuation of the
 comprehensive plan adopted by the two said states for the development of
 the said port of  New  York  district  pursuant  to  this  chapter,  the
 control,  operation,  tolls  and other revenues of the vehicular tunnel,
 known as the Holland tunnel, under the Hudson river between the city  of
 Jersey  City  and  the  city  of  New  York, shall be vested in the port
 authority as hereinafter provided; and  the  port  authority  is  hereby
 authorized  and  empowered  to  construct,  own, maintain and operate an
 interstate vehicular crossing under the Hudson river to consist of three
 tubes (hereinafter called the Midtown Hudson tunnel), together with such
 approaches thereto and connections with highways as the  port  authority
 may deem necessary or desirable.
  2.  The  entrances,  exits  and  approaches to the said Midtown Hudson
 tunnel, on the New York side, shall be between West Thirty-fifth  street
 and  West  Forty-first street and in the vicinity of Ninth avenue and to
 the west thereof, in the borough of Manhattan, city  of  New  York.  The
 approaches  to  the  said  Midtown  Hudson tunnel on the New Jersey side
 shall be so located and constructed as to permit tunnel traffic to  pass
 over  or under the tracks of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Rail-
 road Company and the Northern Railroad Company of New Jersey, immediate-
 ly west of the Palisades, without crossing the said tracks at grade, and
 as to permit connections with New Jersey state  highway  routes  in  the
 vicinity  of  the said tracks. The said Midtown Hudson tunnel shall have
 an appropriate entrance and exit in the township of Weehawken, county of
 Hudson, state of New Jersey.
  3. The control, operation,  tolls  and  other  revenues  of  the  said
 Holland  tunnel  and  its  entrance  and exit plazas and of all real and
 personal property appurtenant thereto or used in  connection  therewith,
 shall  vest  in  the  port  authority  upon  the making of the following
 payments by the port authority to each of the said two states:
  (a) An amount equal to the moneys contributed by such state toward the
 cost of construction of the said Holland tunnel, with  interest  thereon
 at  the  rate of four and one-quarter per centum per annum from the date
 or dates on which such moneys were contributed by such state to the date
 of the payment to such state;
  (b) Less, however, the share of such state in the net revenues of  the
 said  tunnel  to the date of the said payment, and less interest on such
 net revenues at the rate of four and one-quarter per  centum  per  annum
 from  the  dates  on  which  the said net revenues were received by such
 state to the date of the said payment;
  (c) And in the case of the payment to the state of New York,  less  an
 amount equal to the moneys which the said state has agreed to advance to
 the  port authority (but which have not as yet been advanced to the port
 A. 9644  34
 
 authority) in aid  of  bridge  construction,  during  the  fiscal  years
 commencing  in  nineteen hundred thirty-one and nineteen hundred thirty-
 two, pursuant to chapter seven hundred and sixty-one of the laws of  New
 York  of  nineteen  hundred  twenty-six and chapter three hundred of the
 laws of New York of nineteen hundred twenty-seven  and  acts  amendatory
 thereof  and  supplemental  thereto, discounted, however, in the case of
 each advance at the rate of four and one-quarter per centum  per  annum,
 from  the  date of the said payment to the state of New York to the date
 upon which such advance is to be available  pursuant  to  the  aforesaid
 statutes.
  In computing interest as aforesaid upon the moneys contributed by each
 of  the  said  two  states  toward  the cost of construction of the said
 Holland tunnel, such moneys shall be deemed to have been contributed  by
 such  state  upon  the first day of the month following the month during
 which there were presented to the comptroller of such  state  for  audit
 and  payment,  the  schedules and vouchers pursuant to which such moneys
 were paid. In computing interest as  aforesaid  upon  the  net  revenues
 received  by  each  of  the  said two states, such net revenues shall be
 deemed to have been received by such  state  upon  the  date  when  such
 revenues  were credited to such state or to the commission of such state
 pursuant to paragraph eleven of  article  fourteen  of  the  compact  of
 December thirty, nineteen hundred nineteen, between the two said states.
  4. If the amount paid by the port authority to the state of New Jersey
 pursuant  to  subdivision  three  of  this section shall be less than an
 amount which, together with the moneys then in the sinking  fund  estab-
 lished  by chapter three hundred and fifty-two of the laws of New Jersey
 of nineteen hundred twenty and chapter two hundred and sixty-two of  the
 laws  of  New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-four, hereinafter called
 the New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel  sinking  fund  (other  than
 moneys  set  apart  to  pay  interest for the then current year upon the
 bonds of the state of New Jersey authorized by the aforesaid acts of the
 state of New Jersey, hereinafter called New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland
 tunnel bonds), will be  equal  to  the  principal  amount  of  the  then
 outstanding  New  Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel bonds, then and in
 such event, the port authority shall in addition pay to the state of New
 Jersey an amount which, together with the amount paid under and pursuant
 to the preceding section hereof and the moneys then in said  New  Jersey
 Camden  bridge-Holland tunnel sinking fund, will be equal to the princi-
 pal amount of the then  outstanding  New  Jersey  Camden  bridge-Holland
 tunnel  bonds;  and shall, moreover, pay to the state of New York a like
 amount.
  5. The amount payable by the port authority to the state of  New  York
 pursuant to subdivisions three and four of this section shall be paid by
 the  port  authority into the treasury of the state of New York upon the
 thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred thirty-one,  or  at  an  earlier
 date  at  the  option  of the port authority on five days' notice to the
 comptroller of the state of New York, upon a voucher signed and  audited
 by the said comptroller, who is hereby authorized to consummate the said
 transaction.
  6. The amount payable by the port authority to the state of New Jersey
 pursuant to subdivisions three and four of this section shall be paid by
 the  port authority to the sinking fund commission created by said chap-
 ter three hundred and fifty-two of the laws of New  Jersey  of  nineteen
 hundred twenty and said chapter two hundred and sixty-two of the laws of
 New  Jersey  of nineteen hundred twenty-four, hereinafter called the New

  8. Upon the making of the foregoing payments by the port authority  to
 the  two  said states, the provisions of the compact of December thirty,
 nineteen hundred nineteen, between the said two states, relating to  the
 construction  and  operation  of the said Holland tunnel, as amended, so
 far as inconsistent herewith or with the rules, practice  and  procedure
 or general authority of the port authority, shall be and shall be deemed
 to  be abrogated; and chapter four hundred and twenty-one of the laws of
 New York of nineteen hundred thirty, and chapter two hundred and  forty-
 seven  of  the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred thirty, making the
 port authority the agent of the two states in connection with the opera-
 tion of the said Holland tunnel shall cease to be effective.
  § 303. Bridges.  1. Except as may be  agreed  upon  between  the  port
 authority  and  the  municipality  in  which  they shall be located, the
 approaches to the George Washington bridge hereafter constructed on  the
 New  York side shall be located as follows: between Amsterdam avenue and
 Pinehurst avenue, the approaches  shall  be  located  between  West  One
 hundred seventy-eighth street and West One hundred seventy-ninth street;
 between  Pinehurst avenue and Cabrini boulevard, the approaches shall be
 between West One hundred seventy-eighth  street  and  West  One  hundred
 eightieth  street;  between  Cabrini  boulevard  and  Haven  avenue, the
 approaches shall be between West One hundred seventy-seventh street  and
 the  line  parallel  to the northerly side of West One hundred eightieth
 street and one hundred twenty-five feet north of the  building  line  on
 the north side thereof; between Haven avenue and Service street north of
 the George Washington bridge, the approaches shall be between the bridge
 and  an extension of the building line on the northerly side of West One
 hundred eightieth street. Except as so limited, the port  authority  may
 effectuate  such  approaches, connections, highway extensions or highway
 improvements as it shall deem necessary or desirable in relation to  the
 George Washington bridge, located in or extending across the counties in
 which  such  bridge  is  located,  and,  in its discretion, may do so by
 agreement with any other public agency; such agreement may  provide  for
 the  construction,  ownership,  maintenance  or  operation  of  such
 approaches, connections or highway extensions or highway improvements by
 such other public agency.
  2. The port authority is  hereby  authorized  and  empowered,  in  its
 discretion,  to  construct,  own,  maintain  and  operate  in Washington
 Heights in the borough of Manhattan, New York city, as an  addition  and
 improvement  to  the vehicular bridge over the Hudson river at Fort Lee,
 A. 9644  36
 
 known as and hereinafter in this section referred to as the George Wash-
 ington bridge, a bus passenger facility, by which is  meant  a  facility
 consisting  of  one or more buildings, structures, improvements, loading
 or unloading areas, parking areas or other facilities necessary, conven-
 ient  or desirable in the opinion of the port authority for the accommo-
 dation of omnibuses  and  other  motor  vehicles  operated  by  carriers
 engaged in the transportation of passengers, or for the loading, unload-
 ing,  interchange  or  transfer  of such passengers or their baggage, or
 otherwise for the accommodation, use or convenience of  such  passengers
 or such carriers or their employees and for purposes incidental thereto.
  3.  Nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  deemed  to prevent the port
 authority from establishing, levying  and  collecting  tolls  and  other
 charges  in  connection  with such bus passenger facility in addition to
 and other than the tolls or charges established, levied and collected in
 connection with the George Washington bridge  or  any  other  bridge  or
 tunnel.
  §  304.  Studies and reporting.  The port authority shall from time to
 time make studies, surveys and investigations to determine the necessity
 and practicability of vehicular bridges and tunnels over or under inter-
 state waters within the port of New York district, in  addition  to  the
 Midtown  Hudson  tunnel  and Holland tunnel and to the George Washington
 bridge, Goethals bridge, Outerbridge Crossing and  Bayonne  bridge,  and
 report  to the governors and legislatures of the two states thereon. The
 port authority shall not proceed with the construction of any such addi-
 tional vehicular bridges and  tunnels  over  or  under  said  interstate
 waters  until hereafter expressly authorized by the two said states, but
 the second deck of the George Washington bridge shall be  considered  an
 addition  and  improvement to the said bridge and not such an additional
 vehicular bridge, and the port authority's power  and  authorization  to
 construct, own, maintain and operate said second deck for highway vehic-
 ular  or  rail  rapid transit traffic or both is hereby acknowledged and
 confirmed.
  § 305. Inspections.  The port authority shall inspect bridges  located
 within  the  state of New York and under the authority's jurisdiction in
 accordance with criteria established for  other  publicly-owned  bridges
 within the state.
  § 306. Construction, maintenance and operation.  1. The port authority
 shall,  so  far  as  it  deems it practicable, treat as a single unified
 operation the  construction,  maintenance  and  operation  of  the  said
 Midtown  Hudson  tunnel,  the  Holland tunnel, the two vehicular bridges
 over the Arthur Kill, the vehicular bridge over the Kill van  Kull,  the
 vehicular bridge over the Hudson river at Fort Lee, and any other vehic-
 ular  bridges  or  tunnels  which  it  may construct or operate, raising
 moneys for the construction thereof and for the making of additions  and
 improvements  thereto  in whole or in part upon its own obligations, and
 establishing and levying such tolls and other charges  as  it  may  deem
 necessary  to secure from all of such bridges and tunnels as a group, at
 least sufficient revenue to meet the expenses of the construction, main-
 tenance and operation of such bridges and tunnels as  a  group,  and  to
 provide  for  the  payment  of  the  interest  upon and amortization and
 retirement of and the fulfillment of the terms of all  bonds  and  other
 securities  and  obligations  which  it  may  have issued or incurred in
 connection therewith.
  2. The additions and improvements to bridges and  tunnels  constructed
 or  operated  by  it  which  the  port authority is hereby authorized to
 effectuate shall include but not be limited to  parking  facilities,  by
 A. 9644  37
 
 which  is  meant  transportation  facilities  consisting  of one or more
 areas, buildings, structures, improvements, or other  accommodations  or
 appurtenances  necessary,  convenient or desirable in the opinion of the
 port  authority for the parking or storage of motor vehicles of users of
 such bridges and tunnels and other members of the general public and for
 the transfer of the operators and passengers of such motor  vehicles  to
 and from omnibuses and other motor vehicles operated by carriers over or
 through such bridges or tunnels, and for purposes incidental thereto.
  3.  Nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  deemed  to prevent the port
 authority from establishing, levying  and  collecting  tolls  and  other
 charges in connection with any parking facility in addition to and other
 than  the  tolls  or  charges  established,  levied  and  collected  in
 connection with the bridge or tunnel to which such parking  facility  is
 an addition and improvement or any other bridge or tunnel.
  4.  The  port authority shall not proceed with the construction of any
 parking facility as an addition and improvement to any bridge or  tunnel
 other  than  a  parking  facility in the township of North Bergen in the
 state of New Jersey at or in the vicinity of the Midtown  Hudson  tunnel
 and  its  approaches  and connections, except as heretofore or hereafter
 expressly authorized.
  5. The plans of the connections with state or  municipal  highways  of
 any  vehicular  bridge  or tunnel which the port authority may hereafter
 construct (including the plans of any additional connections of existing
 bridges or tunnels with state or municipal highways), shall  be  subject
 to  the  approval of the governor of the state in which such connections
 shall be located. Either state may require  by  appropriate  legislation
 that  such  connections  shall be subject to the approval of the munici-
 pality of that state in which they shall be located; and in such  event,
 the approval of such municipality shall be given as provided in subdivi-
 sion two of section one hundred three of this article.  Except as limit-
 ed  herein, the port authority shall determine all matters pertaining to
 such bridges and tunnels.
  6. The construction, maintenance and operation  of  vehicular  bridges
 and  tunnels  within  the  said port of New York district (including the
 said Holland tunnel and the said Midtown Hudson tunnel), are and will be
 in all respects for the benefit of the people of the states of New  York
 and  New  Jersey,  for the increase of their commerce and prosperity and
 for the improvement of their health and living conditions; and the  port
 authority  shall  be  regarded  as  performing an essential governmental
 function in undertaking  the  construction,  maintenance  and  operation
 thereof  and in carrying out the provisions of law relating thereto, and
 shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments upon any of the proper-
 ty acquired or used by it for such purposes.
  7. If for any of  the  purposes  of  this  part  (including  temporary
 construction  purposes,  and  the making of additions or improvements to
 bridges or tunnels already constructed), the port authority  shall  find
 it  necessary  or  convenient  to  acquire  any  real property as herein
 defined, whether for immediate or future use,  the  port  authority  may
 find  and determine that such property, whether a fee simple absolute or
 a lesser interest, is required for a public use, and upon such  determi-
 nation,  the  said  property shall be and shall be deemed to be required
 for such public use until otherwise determined by  the  port  authority;
 and  with the exceptions hereinafter specifically noted, the said deter-
 mination shall not be affected by the fact that such property has there-
 tofore been taken for, or is then devoted to,  a  public  use;  but  the
 public use in the hands or under the control of the port authority shall
 A. 9644  38
 
 be  deemed  superior to the public use in the hands of any other person,
 association or corporation.
  8.  The port authority may acquire and is hereby authorized to acquire
 such property, whether a fee simple absolute or a  lesser  interest,  by
 the  exercise  of  the right of eminent domain under and pursuant to the
 provisions of the eminent domain procedure law of the state of New York,
 in the case of property located in such state, and revised  statutes  of
 New  Jersey,  Title  20:1-1  et seq., in the case of property located in
 such state, or at the option  of  the  port  authority  as  provided  in
 section  fifteen  of  chapter  forty-three  of the laws of New Jersey of
 nineteen hundred forty-seven, as amended, for the condemnation  of  real
 property  for  air terminal purposes, in the case of property located in
 such state, or pursuant to such other and alternate procedure as may  be
 provided by law.
  9.  Where  a person entitled to an award in the proceedings to acquire
 any real property for any of the  purposes  of  this  part,  remains  in
 possession  of  such  property after the time of the vesting of title in
 the port authority, the reasonable value of his  use  and  occupancy  of
 such  property  subsequent to such time, as fixed by agreement or by the
 court in such proceedings or by any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction,
 shall  be  a lien against such award, subject only to liens of record at
 the time of the vesting of title in the port authority.
  10. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit  the  port
 authority  from  bringing  any proceedings to remove a cloud on title or
 such other proceedings as it may, in its  discretion,  deem  proper  and
 necessary,  or  from  acquiring  any  such  property  by  negotiation or
 purchase.
  11. Anything in this act to the contrary notwithstanding, no  property
 now  or  hereafter  vested  in  or  held  by  any county, city, borough,
 village, township or other municipality  shall  be  taken  by  the  port
 authority,  without  the  authority  or  consent  of  such county, city,
 borough, village, township or other municipality as provided in part one
 of this article, provided that the state in  which  such  county,  city,
 borough,  village, township or other municipality is located may author-
 ize such property to be taken by the port authority by  condemnation  or
 the  exercise  of  the right of eminent domain without such authority or
 consent; nor shall anything herein impair or invalidate in any  way  any
 bonded  indebtedness  of  the  state,  or  such  county,  city, borough,
 village, township or other municipality, nor impair  the  provisions  of
 law  regulating  the  payment into sinking funds of revenue derived from
 municipal property, or dedicating the revenues  derived  from  municipal
 property, to a specific purpose. The port authority is hereby authorized
 and  empowered  to acquire from any such county, city, borough, village,
 township or other municipality, or  from  any  other  public  agency  or
 commission  having jurisdiction in the premises, by agreement therewith,
 and such county, city, borough, village, township, municipality,  public
 agency  or commission, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, is
 hereby authorized and empowered to  grant  and  convey  upon  reasonable
 terms  and conditions, any real property, which may be necessary for the
 construction, operation and maintenance of  such  bridges  and  tunnels,
 including  such  real  property  as has already been devoted to a public
 use. Each of the two said states hereby consent to the use  and  occupa-
 tion  of the real property of such state necessary for the construction,
 operation and maintenance of bridges and tunnels constructed or operated
 pursuant to the provisions of this part, including lands  of  the  state
 lying under water.
 A. 9644  39
 
  12.  The  port  authority and its duly authorized agents and employees
 may enter upon any land in this state for the  purpose  of  making  such
 surveys, maps, or other examinations thereof as it may deem necessary or
 convenient for the purposes of this part.
  13.  The  term  "real  property" as used in this section is defined to
 include lands, structures, franchises, and interests in land,  including
 lands under water and riparian rights, and any and all things and rights
 usually included within the said term, and includes not only fees simple
 absolute  but  also  any  and  all  lesser interests, such as easements,
 rights of way, uses, leases, licenses and all other incorporeal  heredi-
 taments and every estate, interest or right, legal or equitable, includ-
 ing  terms of years, and liens thereon by way of judgments, mortgages or
 otherwise, and also claims for damage to real estate.
  14. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize or permit
 the port authority to undertake the construction of any vehicular bridge
 or tunnel over or under  the  Arthur  Kill,  unless  or  until  adequate
 provision  has  been  made  by law for the protection of those advancing
 money upon the obligations of the port authority for the construction of
 the bridges mentioned in chapter two hundred and  ten  of  the  laws  of
 nineteen  hundred  twenty-five,  or  the  construction  of any vehicular
 bridge or tunnel over or under the Hudson river, at or north of Sixtieth
 street in the borough of Manhattan, city of New York,  unless  or  until
 adequate  provision  has  been  made  by law for the protection of those
 advancing money upon the obligations  of  the  port  authority  for  the
 construction  of  the  bridge  mentioned  in  chapter  seven hundred and
 sixty-one  of  the  laws  of  nineteen  hundred  twenty-six,  or  the
 construction  of  any  vehicular bridge or tunnel over or under the Kill
 van Kull unless or until adequate provision has been made by law for the
 protection of those advancing money upon the  obligations  of  the  port
 authority  for the construction of the bridge mentioned in chapter three
 hundred of the laws of nineteen hundred twenty-seven.
  § 307. Rules and regulations relating to tunnels and bridges.  1.  The
 port  authority  is hereby authorized to make and enforce such rules and
 regulations and to establish, levy and  collect  such  tolls  and  other
 charges  in  connection  with any vehicular bridges and tunnels which it
 may now or hereafter be authorized to own, construct, operate or control
 (including the said Holland tunnel and the said Midtown Hudson  tunnel),
 as  it  may  deem  necessary,  proper or desirable, which said tolls and
 charges shall be at  least  sufficient  to  meet  the  expenses  of  the
 construction,  operation and maintenance thereof, and to provide for the
 payment of, with interest upon, and the amortization and  retirement  of
 bonds  or  other securities or obligations issued or incurred for bridge
 or tunnel purposes.  There  shall  be  allocated  to  the  cost  of  the
 construction,  operation  and  maintenance  of such bridges and tunnels,
 such proportion of the general expenses of  the  port  authority  as  it
 shall deem properly chargeable thereto.
  2.  The  moneys  in  the  general  reserve  fund of the port authority
 (authorized by chapter five of  the  laws  of  New  Jersey  of  nineteen
 hundred  thirty-one,  as amended, and chapter forty-eight of the laws of
 New York of nineteen hundred thirty-one, as  amended  and  continued  by
 part  XXIX  of  this  article) may be pledged in whole or in part by the
 port authority as security for or applied by it to  the  repayment  with
 interest of any moneys which it may raise upon bonds or other securities
 or  obligations  issued  or  incurred  from  time to time for any of the
 purposes of this part or secured in whole or in part by  the  pledge  of
 the  revenues of the port authority from any bridge or tunnel or both so
 A. 9644  40
 
 issued or incurred and so  secured;  and  the  moneys  in  said  general
 reserve  fund may be applied by the port authority to the fulfillment of
 any other undertakings which it may assume to or for the benefit of  the
 holders of any such bonds, securities or other obligations.
  3.  Subject  to  prior liens and pledges (and to the obligation of the
 port authority to apply revenues  to  the  maintenance  of  its  general
 reserve  fund  in the amount prescribed by the said statutes authorizing
 said fund), the revenues of the port authority  from  facilities  estab-
 lished,  constructed,  acquired  or  effectuated through the issuance or
 sale of bonds of the port authority secured by a pledge of  its  general
 reserve  fund  may  be  pledged  in  whole or in part as security for or
 applied by it to the repayment with interest of any moneys which it  may
 raise  upon  bonds or other securities or obligations issued or incurred
 from time to time for any of the purposes of this  part  or  secured  in
 whole  or  in  part  by the pledge of the revenues of the port authority
 from any bridge or tunnel or both so issued or incurred and so  secured,
 and  said  revenues may be applied by the port authority to the fulfill-
 ment of any other undertakings which it may assume to or for the benefit
 of the holders of such bonds, securities or other obligations.
  In the event that at any time the balance of moneys  theretofore  paid
 into  the general reserve fund and not applied therefrom shall exceed an
 amount equal to one-tenth of the  par  value  of  all  bonds  legal  for
 investment, as defined and limited in the said statutes authorizing said
 fund,  issued  by  the  port authority and currently outstanding at such
 time, by reason of the retirement of bonds or other securities or  obli-
 gations  issued or incurred from time to time for any of the purposes of
 this part or secured in whole or in part by the pledge of  the  revenues
 of  the  port  authority  from any bridge or tunnel or both so issued or
 incurred and so secured, the par value of  which  had  theretofore  been
 included  in  the computation of said one-tenth, then the port authority
 may pledge or apply such excess for and only for the purposes for  which
 it  is  authorized  by the said statutes authorizing said fund to pledge
 the moneys in the general reserve fund and such pledge may  be  made  in
 advance of the time when such excess may occur.
  §  308.  Bonds.  1. The two said states covenant and agree with each
 other and with the holders of any bonds or  other  securities  or  obli-
 gations  of  the port authority, issued or incurred for bridge or tunnel
 purposes and as security for which there may or  shall  be  pledged  the
 tolls and revenues or any part thereof of any vehicular bridge or tunnel
 (including  the said Holland tunnel and the said Midtown Hudson tunnel),
 that the two said states will not, so long as any of such bonds or other
 obligations remain outstanding and unpaid, diminish or impair the  power
 of  the  port  authority  to establish, levy and collect tolls and other
 charges in connection therewith; and that the two said states will  not,
 so long as any of such bonds or other obligations remain outstanding and
 unpaid,  authorize  the construction of any vehicular bridges or tunnels
 over or under interstate waters as herein defined within the  said  port
 of New York district, by any person or body other than the port authori-
 ty,  in competition with those whose tolls or other revenues are pledged
 as aforesaid; provided that nothing herein contained shall be deemed  to
 refer  to  the  bridge authorized by the act of congress of July eleven,
 eighteen hundred ninety, chapter six hundred and  sixty-nine,  and  acts
 amendatory  thereof  and supplemental thereto; and provided further that
 nothing  herein  contained  shall  preclude  the  authorization  of  the
 construction  of such competitive tunnels or bridges by other persons or
 A. 9644  41
 
 bodies if and when adequate provision shall  be  made  by  law  for  the
 protection of those advancing money upon such obligations.
  2. The bonds or other securities or obligations which may be issued or
 incurred by the port authority pursuant to this part, or as security for
 which  there  may  be  pledged  the tolls and other revenues or any part
 thereof of any vehicular bridge or tunnel (including  the  said  Holland
 tunnel  and  the said Midtown Hudson tunnel) now or hereafter authorized
 by the two said states or both so issued or incurred and so secured, are
 hereby made securities in which all state  and  municipal  officers  and
 bodies,  all banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks, savings and
 loan associations, investment companies and other persons carrying on  a
 banking  business,  all  insurance companies, insurance associations and
 other persons carrying on an insurance business, and all administrators,
 executors, guardians, trustees  and  other  fiduciaries  and  all  other
 persons  whatsoever who are now or may hereafter be authorized to invest
 in bonds or other obligations of the state,  may  properly  and  legally
 invest  any  funds, including capital, belonging to them or within their
 control; and said bonds or other securities or  obligations  are  hereby
 made  securities  which  may  properly and legally be deposited with and
 shall be received by any state or municipal officer or  agency  for  any
 purpose  for  which  the  deposit  of bonds or other obligations of this
 state is now or may hereafter be authorized.
  § 309. Compact.  1. This section and the preceding  sections  of  this
 part,  constitute  an  agreement  between the states of New York and New
 Jersey supplementary to the compact between the two states  dated  April
 thirty,  nineteen  hundred twenty-one, and amendatory thereof, and shall
 be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of said compact and of
 the comprehensive plan heretofore adopted by the  two  states,  and  any
 powers  granted to the port authority by this part shall be deemed to be
 in aid of and supplementary to and in no  case  a  limitation  upon  the
 powers  heretofore  vested  in the port authority by the two said states
 and/or by congress, except as herein otherwise provided.
  2. Any declarations contained in this part with respect to the govern-
 mental nature of bridges and tunnels and to the exemption of bridge  and
 tunnel property from taxation and to the discretion of the port authori-
 ty  with  respect to bridge and tunnel operations shall not be construed
 to imply that other port authority property and operations are not of  a
 governmental  nature,  or that they are subject to taxation, or that the
 determinations of the  port  authority  with  respect  thereto  are  not
 conclusive.
  3.  The  powers vested in the port authority herein (including but not
 limited to the powers to acquire real property by  condemnation  and  to
 make  or effectuate additions, improvements, approaches and connections)
 shall be continuing powers and no exercise thereof shall  be  deemed  to
 exhaust them or any of them.
  4.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect, diminish or
 impair the rights and obligations created by, or to repeal  any  of  the
 provisions  of  chapter  three  hundred and fifty-two of the laws of New
 Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty and chapter two hundred and  sixty-two
 of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-four.
  5.  If,  however,  any loss shall be suffered by or accrue to the said
 sinking fund, and if, after the  making  of  the  payment  by  the  port
 authority  to  the  state  of  New  Jersey as hereinbefore provided, the
 moneys in the said sinking fund shall at any time be or become less than
 an amount equal to the principal amount of the then currently  outstand-
 ing  New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel bonds, or if the income and
 A. 9644  42
 
 interest currently received from or currently accruing upon  the  moneys
 in  the  said  sinking  fund  shall be or become insufficient to pay the
 interest currently accruing upon or currently payable in connection with
 the  aforesaid  New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel bonds, the state
 of New Jersey represents and agrees that it will make good such deficits
 out of sources other than revenues from the said Holland tunnel.
  6. The said payment by the port authority to the state of  New  Jersey
 constitutes  repayment  for  all  moneys  contributed  by the said state
 toward the cost of construction of the said  Holland  tunnel,  including
 the  moneys diverted and appropriated by chapter three hundred and nine-
 teen of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-six and  chap-
 ter  fifty-eight  of  the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-
 seven from the road fund, created by chapter fifteen of the laws of  New
 Jersey  of nineteen hundred seventeen. The requirement of chapter fifty-
 eight of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen  hundred  twenty-seven  that
 the  said  moneys  diverted and appropriated by the said statutes of the
 state of New Jersey shall be returned and  credited  to  the  said  road
 fund,  with  interest,  shall be and shall be deemed to be satisfied and
 discharged so far as it relates to the revenues arising from the  opera-
 tion of the said Holland tunnel.
  7.  The  provisions  of  this  section shall constitute a covenant and
 agreement by the state of New York with the state  of  New  Jersey,  the
 port  authority and the holders of any bonds or other obligations of the
 port authority, as security for which the tolls  and  revenues  of  said
 Holland tunnel may be pledged.
  8.  Nothing  herein  contained shall be construed to impair in any way
 the obligation of the port authority to repay to the two states  any  or
 all  advances  made  by  them  to  the  port  authority in aid of bridge
 construction.

 or a lesser interest, is required for public use, and upon such determi-
 nation, the said property shall be and shall be deemed  to  be  required
 for such public use until otherwise determined by the port authority.

 such real property for any reason whatsoever, then  the  port  authority

 village,  township  or  other municipality, nor impair the provisions of
 law regulating the payment into sinking funds of  revenue  derived  from
 municipal  property,  or  dedicating the revenues derived from municipal
 property, to a specific purpose.  Moreover,  no  property  devoted  to
 public  use  by  any  railroad or railway corporation, or public utility
 corporation, or by any other corporation, shall be  taken  by  the  port
 authority  without  the  authority  or consent of such corporation.  The

 thousand dollars, respectively, to the port  authority  for  preliminary
 studies  upon  the  interstate vehicular bridges now known as the Outer-

 agreements between the two states that said moneys should be  paid  back
 when  the  construction  debt  has  been  amortized, and said two states
 having advanced further sums aggregating four million  dollars  each  in
 aid  of  the construction of said bridges pursuant to agreements between
 the two states that said moneys should be paid back out of bridge reven-
 ues in specified annual installments, if  and  when  earned  over  prior

 permit any such payments up to the present time but the  port  authority
 being  in  a position to fund its obligations to pay back said appropri-
 ations, now, therefore, upon the concurrence of the state of New  Jersey
 as  provided  in  section  eight  hereof, the states of New York and New

 million one hundred thousand dollars in aggregate  principal  amount  of
 bonds,  or moneys, or both shall be delivered to the state of New Jersey
 provided, that if, in the opinion  of  the  commissioners  of  the  port

 postpone such delivery, then delivery of said additional  amounts  shall
 be  postponed  in  whole or in part until such time, not later than five
 years from the effective date of chapter three hundred fifty-two of  the
 laws  of  nineteen hundred forty-six, as in the judgment of said commis-
 sioners financial conditions permit such delivery.
  The port authority shall determine whether payments made  pursuant  to
 this part and the concurrent article of the state of New Jersey shall be
 made  by  delivery of bonds or of moneys, or both, and, if both, in what
 proportions. The moneys may, at the option of  the  port  authority,  be

 New York shall be made by delivering or tendering  delivery  thereof  to
 the  comptroller of the state of New York at his office at Albany during
 regular business hours. Delivery of bonds or moneys to the state of  New
 Jersey  shall be made by delivering or tendering delivery thereof to the

 reserve fund shall be pledged as security for the payment of the princi-
 pal and interest of said bonds and for the fulfillment of  other  under-
 takings assumed by the port authority to or for the benefit of the hold-
 ers  of  said bonds. Such pledge, however, shall be subject to the right
 of the port authority to pledge said general reserve  fund  as  security
 for any other bonds, notes or evidences of indebtedness whatsoever here-
 after  issued  by the authority as security for which it may at the time
 be authorized to pledge the said general reserve fund, and also  subject
 to  the  right  of  the port authority to use the moneys in said general
 reserve fund to meet, pay or otherwise fulfill any  of  its  obligations
 under  or  in  connection  with  any  bonds, notes or other evidences of
 indebtedness as security for which said general reserve fund has hereto-
 fore been or is now pledged or for which said general reserve  fund  may
 hereafter  be pledged. Moreover, no greater rights in or to said general
 reserve fund shall be granted to or conferred upon the  holders  of  the
 bonds  delivered to the two states pursuant to this part and the concur-
 A. 9644  48
 
 rent article of the state of New Jersey than have been  granted  to  and

 hundred fifty-two of the laws of nineteen hundred forty-six and  contin-
 ued  by  this part and the concurrent article of the state of New Jersey
 shall be dated as of a date not more than thirty days subsequent to  the
 date  on  which  delivery  is made or tendered, shall mature forty years
 from their date, and shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half
 per centum per annum. Said bonds shall be subject to redemption  at  the
 option  of  the  port  authority,  in  whole or in part, on any interest
 payment date or dates at one hundred percent of their  par  value,  plus
 accrued interest to the date set for redemption.
  Except  as  hereinbefore  specifically  provided,  the  port authority
 shall, by resolution, determine the form, characteristics and all  other
 matters  in  connection  with said bonds, including without limiting the
 generality hereof, the denominations in  which  they  shall  be  issued,
 provisions  with  respect  to  the exchange of bonds of one denomination
 into bonds of another denomination, provisions with respect to the issu-

 obligations are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be
 deposited  with  and shall be received by any state or municipal officer
 or agency of either state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds
 or other obligations of such state is now or may  hereafter  be  author-
 ized.

 first two million fifty thousand dollars paid to each state pursuant  to
 this part and the concurrent article of the state of New Jersey shall be
 deemed to be on account of the moneys advanced by such state for prelim-

 upon and in aid of the construction of the Outerbridge crossing (former-
 ly known as the Perth Amboy-Tottenville bridge) and the Goethals  bridge
 (formerly  known  as  the  Elizabeth-Howland  Hook bridge); and from and

 with  interest  of  any  moneys  which it may raise upon bonds, notes or
 other obligations or evidences of indebtedness, issued by it  from  time

 omnibuses and other motor vehicles operated by carriers engaged  in  the

 their employees) or for purposes  incidental  thereto;  and  that  the
 moneys in said general reserve fund may be applied by the port authority
 to  the  fulfillment of any other undertakings which it may assume to or
 for the benefit of the holders of any of such bonds;  and the  two  said
 states further agree that the port authority may acquire by condemnation
 or  the  right  of eminent domain such real property in each state as it
 may from time to time deem necessary  for  or  in  connection  with  the

  § 1002. Funding.  The bonds, notes or other obligations  or  evidences

 erly and legally be deposited with and shall be received by any state or
 municipal  officer  or  agency of either state for any purpose for which
 the deposit of bonds or other obligations of such state is  now  or  may
 hereafter be authorized.
  § 1003. Maintenance and operation.  The establishment, maintenance and
 operation  of  such  motor  bus  terminal  within  the  port of New York
 district is and will be in all respects for the benefit of the people of
 the states of New York  and  New  Jersey,  for  the  increase  of  their
 commerce  and  prosperity  and  for  the improvement of their health and
 living conditions; and the port authority shall be regarded as  perform-
 ing  an essential governmental function in undertaking the construction,
 A. 9644  51

 maintenance and operation thereof and in carrying out the provisions  of
 law relating thereto.
  § 1004. Powers.  Any powers granted to the port authority by this part
 and  the  concurrent act of the state of New Jersey shall be regarded as
 in aid of and supplemental to and in no sense as a limitation  upon  any
 of  the  other  powers vested in it by the two states or either of them;
 and the port authority  shall  be  authorized  not  only  to  establish,
 acquire,  rehabilitate,  maintain, operate and from time to time improve
 such motor bus terminal, but also to make incidental uses of  properties
 acquired for or in connection with such motor bus terminal.
  § 1005. Acquisition of real property.  If, for the purpose of effectu-
 ating,  acquiring,  constructing, rehabilitating or improving such motor
 bus terminal, the port authority shall find it necessary  or  convenient
 to  acquire any real property, as herein defined, in this state, whether
 for immediate or future use, the port authority may find  and  determine
 that  such property, whether a fee simple absolute or a lesser interest,
 is required for public use, and upon such determination, the said  prop-
 erty  shall  be  and  shall be deemed to be required for such public use
 until  otherwise  determined  by  the  port  authority;  and  with  the
 exceptions  hereinafter specifically noted, the said determination shall
 not be affected by the fact that  such  property  has  theretofore  been
 taken  for,  or  is then devoted to, a public use; but the public use in
 the hands or under the control of the port  authority  shall  be  deemed
 superior to the public use in the hands of any other person, association
 or corporation.
  If  the  port  authority is unable to agree for the acquisition of any
 such real property for any reason whatsoever, then  the  port  authority
 may  acquire and is hereby authorized to acquire such property whether a
 fee simple absolute or a lesser interest, by the exercise of  the  right
 of  eminent  domain  under and pursuant to the provisions of the eminent
 domain procedure law.
  Anything in this part to the contrary notwithstanding, no property now
 or hereafter vested in or  held  by  the  state  or  any  county,  city,
 borough,  village,  township or other municipality shall be taken by the
 port authority, without the authority or consent of the state or of such
 county, city, borough,  village,  township,  or  other  municipality  as
 provided  in the compact of April thirtieth, nineteen hundred twenty-one
 and continued by part I of this article, between the states of New  York
 and  New  Jersey,  nor shall anything herein impair or invalidate in any
 way any bonded indebtedness of the state, or such county, city, borough,
 village, township or other municipality, nor impair  the  provisions  of
 law  regulating  the  payment into sinking funds of revenue derived from
 municipal property, or dedicating the revenues  derived  from  municipal
 property  to a specific purpose. The port authority is hereby authorized
 and empowered to acquire from any such county, city,  borough,  village,
 township  or  other  municipality,  or  from  any other public agency or
 commission having jurisdiction in the premises, by agreement  therewith,
 and  such county, city, borough, village, township, municipality, public
 agency or commission, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law,  is
 hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to  grant and convey upon reasonable
 terms and conditions, any real property, which may be necessary for  the
 establishment,  construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, operation and
 maintenance of such motor bus terminal, including such real property  as
 has already been devoted to a public use.
  The  port  authority  and its duly authorized agents and employees may
 pursuant to the provisions of the eminent  domain  procedure  law  enter
 A. 9644  52
 
 upon  any  land  in  this  state for the purpose of making such surveys,

 continued  by part I of this article and shall be liberally construed to
 effectuate the purposes of said compact and of  the  comprehensive  plan
 heretofore  adopted  by  the two states pursuant thereto, and the powers

 and  supplemental  to  and not in limitation or derogation of any of the
 powers heretofore conferred upon or delegated to the Port Authority.
  § 1106.  Acquisition  of  land  by  eminent  domain  or  condemnation.
 Subject  to the limitation provided for in section eleven hundred two of
 this part that the Port Authority may not acquire  any  marine  terminal
 owned or operated by any municipality or any other property vested in or
 held  by any municipality without the authority or consent of such muni-
 cipality, the Port Authority may, at its option, exercise the  right  of
 eminent  domain or condemnation to acquire real property in the state of
 New York for marine terminal purposes as set forth in this section:
  1. If for any of  the  purposes  of  this  part  (including  temporary
 construction  purposes,  and  the  making  of  additions, extensions, or
 improvements to marine terminals already constructed) the Port Authority
 shall find it necessary, convenient or desirable  to  acquire  any  real
 property  as  herein  defined,  whether for immediate or future use, the
 Port Authority may find and determine that such property, whether a  fee
 simple  absolute or a lesser interest, is required for a public use, and
 upon such determination, the said real property shall be  and  shall  be
 deemed  to be required for such public use until otherwise determined by
 the Port Authority;  and, subject to the limitation hereinbefore specif-
 ically noted, the said determination shall not be affected by  the  fact
 that  such  property  has theretofore been taken for, or is then devoted
 to, a public use;  but the public use in the hands or under the  control
 of  the Port Authority shall be deemed superior to the public use in the
 hands of any other person, association or corporation, provided,  howev-
 er,  that  nothing  herein  contained  shall  be construed to permit the
 taking by exercise of the right of eminent domain by the Port  Authority
 of any property owned by any railroad or railway corporation and devoted
 to  use  by such corporation in its operations, or acquired prior to the
 effective date of this part and held for such use, without the authority
 or consent of such corporation.
  The Port Authority may acquire and is  hereby  authorized  to  acquire
 such  property,  whether  a fee simple absolute or a lesser interest, by
 the exercise of the right of eminent domain under and  pursuant  to  the
 provisions of the eminent domain procedure law of the state of New York.
  2.  Unless  and until the state of New York otherwise provides by law,
 the Port Authority shall not have the power to acquire real property  in
 the  state  of  New York for marine terminal purposes by condemnation or
 the right of eminent domain except for  real  property  within  the  two
 tracts  in  the  borough of Brooklyn, county of Kings, city and state of
 New York, hereinafter bounded and described,  necessary,  convenient  or

 A. 9644  61
 
 hereditaments and every estate, interest or right, legal  or  equitable,
 including  terms  for years and liens thereon by way of judgments, mort-

  §  1204.  Purpose.  The  effectuation,  establishment,  acquisition,
 construction, rehabilitation, improvement, maintenance and operation  of
 air  terminals  by the port authority is and will be in all respects for
 the benefit of the people of the states of New York and New Jersey,  for
 the  increase  of their commerce and prosperity, and for the improvement
 of their health and living conditions;  and the port authority shall  be
 regarded as performing an essential governmental function in undertaking
 the  effectuation,  establishment,  acquisition, construction, rehabili-
 tation, improvement, maintenance or operation thereof, and  in  carrying
 out the provisions of law relating thereto.
  §  1205.  Operation  of  air terminals; noise prohibition. 1. The port
 authority shall not permit or contract for the landing or takeoff of any
 aircraft which emits a noise in excess of 108 EPNdB as measured  as  set
 forth herein at any airport it maintains or operates; provided, however,
 in  any  case  of emergency involving the possible saving of human life,
 the prohibition of this subdivision may be temporarily suspended.
  2. Measurement. For purposes of this section, aircraft noise is to  be
 measured at the following points:
  (a)  For  takeoff, at a point 3.5 nautical miles from the start of the
 takeoff roll on the extended centerline of the runway;
  (b) For approach, at a point one nautical mile from the  threshold  on
 the extended centerline of the runway;  and
  (c)  For  the  sideline,  at the point, on a line parallel to and 0.25
 nautical miles from the extended centerline of  the  runway,  where  the
 noise  level  after  liftoff  is  greatest,  except  that, for airplanes
 powered by more than three turbojet engines, this distance must be  0.35
 nautical miles.
  3.  Exceptions.  Notwithstanding  the requirements of subdivisions one
 and two of this section the port authority in its discretion may, up  to
 a  maximum noise level not exceeding 112 PNdB on takeoff, as measured by
 the port authority in the manner used by the port authority to make such
 measurements on the effective date of this section, grant  an  exception
 thereto  to  any classification of aircraft built prior to the effective
 date of this part and which has heretofore used the  airport  facilities
 of  the  port  authority, even though said aircraft does not comply with
 subdivisions one and two of this section, upon a showing  that  (a)  the
 aircraft  is capable of being equipped with retrofit equipment to reduce
 the noise thereof to comply  with  the  foregoing  requirements  of  the
 airport operator, and, in addition, (b) that such modification by way of
 retrofit  to  reduce its noise shall be accomplished upon such terms and
 conditions to assure compliance as the port authority, as airport opera-
 tor, may require, within five years of the date of  application  for  an
 exception  hereunder  but  in  no  event later than June first, nineteen
 hundred eighty-one.
  § 1206. Taxes; assessments. The port authority shall  be  required  to
 pay no taxes or assessments upon any of the property acquired or used by
 it  for  air  terminal  purposes;  but  this shall not be construed to
 prevent the port authority and municipalities from entering into  agree-
 ments  for the payment of fair and reasonable sums by the port authority
 annually in accordance with legislation heretofore adopted  by  the  two
 states, to the end that such municipalities may not suffer undue loss of
 taxes  and  assessments  by  reason  of the acquisition and ownership of
 property by the port authority for air terminal purposes.
 A. 9644  62
 
  § 1207.  General reserve fund; repayment. The moneys  in  the  general
 reserve fund of the port authority may be pledged in whole or in part by
 the  port  authority  as  security for or applied by it to the repayment
 with interest of any moneys which it may raise upon bonds issued  by  it
 from  time  to time to provide funds for air terminal purposes;  and the
 moneys in said general reserve fund may be applied by the port authority
 to the fulfillment of any other undertakings which it may assume  to  or
 for the benefit of the holders of any such bonds.
  Subject to prior liens and pledges, (and to the obligation of the port
 authority  to  apply  revenues to the maintenance of its general reserve
 fund in the amount prescribed by the general reserve fund statutes), the
 revenues of the port authority from facilities established, constructed,
 acquired or effectuated through the issuance or sale  of  bonds  of  the
 port  authority  secured  by a pledge of its general reserve fund may be
 pledged in whole or in part as security for or  applied  by  it  to  the
 repayment  with  interest  of  any  moneys which it may raise upon bonds
 issued by it to provide funds for air terminal purposes, and said reven-
 ues may be applied by the port authority to the fulfillment of any other
 undertakings which it may assume to or for the benefit of the holders of
 such bonds.
  § 1208. Bonds. The bonds issued by the port authority to provide funds
 for air terminal purposes are hereby made securities in which all  state
 and  municipal  officers  and bodies of both states, all banks, bankers,
 trust companies, savings banks, building and loan associations,  savings
 and  loan  associations, investment companies and other persons carrying
 on a banking business, all insurance companies,  insurance  associations
 and other persons carrying on an insurance business, and all administra-
 tors,  executors,  guardians,  trustees  and  other fiduciaries, and all
 other persons whatsoever, who are now or may hereafter be authorized  by
 either  state to invest in bonds or other obligations of such state, may
 properly and legally invest any funds, including capital,  belonging  to
 them or within their control;  and said bonds are hereby made securities
 which  may  properly and legally be deposited with and shall be received
 by any state or municipal officer or agency  of  either  state  for  any
 purpose  for  which  the  deposit  of bonds or other obligations of such
 state is now or may hereafter be authorized.
  §  1209.  Municipality  consent.  1.  Notwithstanding  any  contrary
 provision of law, every municipality in the Port of New York District is
 authorized  and empowered to consent to the use by the port authority of
 any air terminal owned by such municipality or of any real  or  personal
 property owned by such municipality and necessary, convenient or desira-
 ble  in  the  opinion  of  the port authority for air terminal purposes,
 including such real property as has already been  devoted  to  a  public
 use,  and  as  an  incident to such consent, to grant, convey, lease, or
 otherwise transfer to the port authority any such air terminal  or  real
 or  personal  property, upon such terms as may be determined by the port
 authority and such  municipality.  Every  such  municipality  is  also
 authorized  and  empowered as an incident to such consent to vest in the
 port authority the control, operation, maintenance, rents, tolls, charg-
 es and any and all other revenues of any air terminal now owned by  such
 municipality,  the  title to such air terminal remaining in such munici-
 pality.  Such consent shall be given and the execution of any agreement,
 deed, lease, conveyance, or other instrument evidencing such consent  or
 given  as an incident thereto shall be authorized in the manner provided
 in article twenty-two  of  the  compact  of  April  thirtieth,  nineteen
 A. 9644  63
 
 hundred twenty-one, and continued by part I of this article, between the
 two states creating the port authority.
  2.  Notwithstanding  any contrary provision of law, every municipality
 outside the port district is authorized and empowered to consent to  the
 use  of  real property owned by such municipality and necessary, conven-
 ient or desirable in the opinion of the port authority  for  beacons  or
 other aids to navigation, or to the use of any air space over real prop-
 erty owned by such municipality;  and as an incident to such consent, to
 grant,  lease,  convey  or otherwise transfer to the port authority such
 real property or air space.
  Such consent shall be given and the execution of any agreement,  deed,
 lease,  conveyance  or other instrument evidencing such consent or given
 as an incident thereto, shall be given by the  officer,  board  or  body
 authorized  by  law  to convey such property, or if no officer, board or
 body be otherwise authorized so to do, by the  governing  body  of  such
 municipality.
  3.  The  states  of  New  York and New Jersey hereby consent to suits,
 actions or proceedings of any form or nature in law, equity or otherwise
 by any city or other municipality against the port  authority  upon,  in
 connection with or arising out of any such agreement, agreements, or any
 modification  thereof  or supplement thereto, for the following types of
 relief and for such purposes only:
  (a) For money damages for breach thereof,
  (b) For money damages for torts arising out of the  operation  of  the
 municipal air terminal,
  (c) For rent,
  (d) For specific performance,
  (e) For reformation thereof,
  (f) For accounting,
  (g) For declaratory judgment,
  (h) For judgments, orders or decrees restraining or enjoining the port
 authority  from  transferring title to real property to third persons in
 cases where it has contracted with such city or  other  municipality  to
 transfer such title to such city or municipality, and
  (i) For judgments, orders or decrees restraining or enjoining the port
 authority from committing or continuing to commit other breaches of such
 agreements with such municipality, provided that such judgment, order or
 decree  shall  not be entered except upon two days' prior written notice
 to the port  authority  of  the  proposed  entry  thereof  and  provided
 further, that upon an appeal taken by the port authority from such judg-
 ment,  order or decree the service of the notice of appeal shall perfect
 the appeal and shall stay the  execution  of  such  judgment,  order  or
 decree appealed from, without an undertaking or other security.
  4.  When  rules  of  venue are applicable, the venue of any such suit,
 action or proceeding shall be laid in the county or judicial district in
 which the air terminal, which is the subject matter  of  such  agreement
 between  the  port  authority and the city or other municipality, or any
 part thereof, is located.
  5. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, or part of this subdivision, or
 the application thereof to any person or circumstances, shall,  for  any
 reason,  be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
 such judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the  remainder  of
 this  subdivision,  and  the  application thereof to any other person or
 circumstances, but shall be confined in its  operation  to  the  clause,
 sentence, paragraph, or part thereof directly involved in the controver-
 A. 9644  64
 
 sy  in which such judgment shall have been rendered and to the person or
 circumstances involved.
  §  1210.  Acquisition limitations.  The powers hereinafter granted to
 the port authority to acquire real property by condemnation or the right
 of eminent domain shall be subject  to  the  limitations  set  forth  in
 section  twelve  hundred  two  of  this  part, and also to the following
 further limitations:
  1. Unless and until the state of New York otherwise provides  by  law,
 the port authority shall not have power to acquire real property in that
 state  for air terminal purposes by condemnation or the right of eminent
 domain except for  the  purpose  of  making  additions,  extensions  and
 improvements  to  the  three  air terminals in New York city known as La
 Guardia airport, John F. Kennedy international airport  (formerly  known
 as  Idlewild  airport),  and  Floyd  Bennett airport, for the purpose of
 acquiring air rights or  preventing  or  removing  actual  or  potential
 hazards  to air navigation within three miles of the runways at said air
 terminals as such runways may  now  or  hereafter  exist,  and  for  the
 purpose  of  establishing  or  maintaining beacons and other aids to air
 navigation in connection with said three air terminals, whether  or  not
 within  three  miles  of said runways. The port authority shall not have
 power to acquire by condemnation or the right  of  eminent  domain  real
 property in or under the waters of Jamaica Bay for the purpose of adding
 to,  expanding, extending or constructing runway extensions, or incorpo-
 rating such lands into the  airport  operation;  however,  this  section
 shall  not  prohibit  the  port  authority from acquiring such lands for
 installing flight control and safety equipment to service  its  existing
 runways,  nor  from  installing  anti-pollution devices and equipment in
 accordance with its anti-pollution program adopted for the air terminals
 in New York city known as John F. Kennedy international airport or Floyd
 Bennett airport.
  2. Unless and until the state of New Jersey otherwise provides by law,
 the port authority shall not have the power to acquire real property  in
 the state of New Jersey for air terminal purposes by condemnation or the
 right  of  eminent  domain  except  for the purpose of making additions,
 extensions and improvements to the air terminal known as Newark  airport
 (including additions, extensions and improvements thereto located in the
 city  of Elizabeth), for the purpose of acquiring air rights or prevent-
 ing or removing actual or potential hazards  to  air  navigation  within
 three  miles of the runways at said air terminal as such runways may now
 or hereafter exist, and for the purpose of establishing  or  maintaining
 beacons  and  other  aids  to air navigation in connection with said air
 terminal, whether or not within three miles of said runways.
  3. Unless otherwise provided by law by the state in  which  such  real
 property  is located, the port authority shall not have power to acquire
 for air terminal purposes by condemnation, acquisition pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of the eminent domain procedure law, or the right of eminent
 domain subsequent to June thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  fifty-two,  any
 real  property taken for and actually devoted to a public use, provided,
 that this limitation shall not apply to real property a  proceeding  for
 the acquisition of which was initiated prior to that date.
  4.  The  foregoing limitations shall not be construed to limit, affect
 or impair the power of the port authority to acquire  real  property  at
 any  time  and  place for air terminal purposes by negotiation or in any
 other  manner  than  by  condemnation,  acquisition  pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of  the  eminent domain procedure law, or by the exercise of
 the right of eminent domain.
 A. 9644  65
 
  5. Subject to the foregoing limitations, if the port  authority  shall
 find  it  necessary  or  convenient to acquire any real property for air
 terminal purposes, whether for immediate or future use, the port author-
 ity may find and determine that such  property,  whether  a  fee  simple
 absolute  or  a  lesser interest, is required for a public use, and upon
 such determination the said property shall be and shall be deemed to  be
 required  for  such  public  use  until otherwise determined by the port
 authority, and such determination shall not be affected by the fact that
 such property has theretofore been taken for and is then  devoted  to  a
 public use;  but the public use in the hands or under the control of the
 port  authority  shall be deemed superior to the public use in the hands
 of any other person, association or corporation  except  a  municipality
 within  or without the port district. The port authority may acquire and
 is hereby authorized to acquire such  property,  whether  a  fee  simple
 absolute  or  a  lesser  estate, by the exercise of the right of eminent
 domain under and pursuant to the eminent domain  procedure  law  of  the
 state  of  New  York, in the case of property located in such state, and
 revised statutes of New Jersey, Title 20:1-1 et seq.,  in  the  case  of
 property  situated in such state, or at the option of the port authority
 pursuant to such other and alternate procedure in each state as  may  be
 provided  by law by such state. The port authority shall have such power
 of eminent domain not only in respect to real  property  located  within
 the  Port  of New York District but also as to any real property located
 outside of the port district which is necessary, incidental  or  conven-
 ient  for  the  effectuation,  establishment, acquisition, construction,
 rehabilitation or improvement, and  maintenance  and  operation  of  air
 terminals  within  the  port district. Nothing herein contained shall be
 construed to prevent the port authority from bringing any proceedings to
 remove a cloud on title or such other proceedings  as  it  may,  in  its
 discretion, deem proper and necessary, or acquiring any such property by
 negotiation or purchase.
  § 1211. Federal aid.  The port authority may make application directly
 to  the proper federal officials or agencies for federal loans or grants
 in aid of air terminals owned or  operated  by  it;  provided,  that  if
 either  state shall have or adopt general legislation governing applica-
 tions for federal aid for air terminals by municipalities of such state,
 or the receipt or disbursement of such federal aid by or  on  behalf  of
 such  municipalities,  then such legislation shall at the option of such
 state apply to applications by the port authority for  federal  aid  for
 air  terminals located in such state and to the receipt and disbursement
 of such federal aid by or on behalf of the port authority, in  the  same
 manner  and  to  the  same extent as other municipalities of such state.
 Except as above provided, no agency or commission of either state  shall
 have  jurisdiction  over any air terminals under the control of the port
 authority, and all details of financing, construction, leasing, charges,
 rates, tolls, contracts and the operation  of  air  terminals  owned  or
 controlled by the port authority shall be within its sole discretion and
 its  decision in connection with any and all matters concerning such air
 terminals shall be controlling and conclusive. The  local  laws,  resol-
 utions, ordinances, rules and regulations of a municipality within which
 an  air  terminal  is  situated  shall apply to such air terminal, if so
 provided in any agreement between the port authority  and  such  munici-
 pality, and to the extent provided in such agreement.
  § 1212. Lands under water.  In the event that the port authority shall
 find it necessary or desirable to acquire any unappropriated state lands
 or lands under water in the state of New York for air terminal purposes,
 A. 9644  66
 
 the  commissioner  of general services of that state may grant, transfer
 or convey such unappropriated state lands or lands under  water  to  the
 port  authority  upon such consideration, terms and conditions as may be
 determined  by  said commissioner, except that no lands under the waters
 of Jamaica Bay may be granted,  transferred  or  conveyed  to  the  port
 authority  for  air  terminal  purposes  by  said commissioner except as
 provided in paragraph one of section twelve hundred ten of this part.
  In the event that the port authority shall find it necessary or desir-
 able to acquire any lands under water in the state of New Jersey for air
 terminal purposes, the division  of  navigation  of  the  department  of
 conservation  of  that  state  may  grant, transfer or convey such lands
 under water to the port authority in accordance  with  the  statutes  of
 that state governing the making of riparian grants and leases, upon such
 terms and conditions as may be determined by said division.
  In the event that the port authority shall find it necessary or desir-
 able  to  acquire  any  real property required or used for state highway
 purposes in the state of New Jersey, the state highway department of the
 state of New Jersey may grant, transfer or convey such real property  to
 the  port  authority upon such terms and conditions as may be determined
 by said state highway department.
  § 1213. Repayment of bonds and obligations.  The two  states  covenant
 and  agree with each other and with the holders of any bonds of the port
 authority issued or incurred for air terminal purposes and  as  security
 for  which  there  may  or  shall be pledged (directly or indirectly, or
 through the medium of its general reserve fund or otherwise), the reven-
 ues, or any part thereof, of any air terminal or other facility owned or
 operated by the port authority, that the two states will not, so long as
 any of such bonds or other obligations remain  outstanding  and  unpaid,
 diminish  or  impair  the power of the port authority to establish, levy
 and collect landing  fees,  charges,  rents,  tolls  or  other  fees  in
 connection therewith.
  §  1214. Contrary declarations.  Any declarations contained herein and
 in the concurrent act of the state of New Jersey  with  respect  to  the
 governmental  nature of air terminals and to the exemption of air termi-
 nal property from taxation and to the discretion of the  port  authority
 with  respect to air terminal operations shall not be construed to imply
 that other port authority property and operations are not of  a  govern-
 mental  nature, or that they are subject to taxation, or that the deter-
 minations of the port authority with respect thereto are not conclusive.
  § 1215. Agreement between the states.  This section and the  preceding
 sections  of this part constitute an agreement between the states of New
 York and New Jersey supplementary to the compact between the two  states
 dated April thirtieth, nineteen hundred twenty-one, and amendatory ther-
 eof,  and  continued  by  part I of this article, and shall be liberally
 construed to effectuate the purposes of said compact and of the  compre-
 hensive plan heretofore adopted by the two states, and the powers vested
 in  the  port  authority  hereby  shall be construed to be in aid of and
 supplemental to and not in limitation of or in derogation of any of  the
 powers heretofore conferred upon or delegated to the port authority.
  §  1216.  Federal  aid procedure; application.  The state of New York
 hereby elects to exercise the option reserved to each state  by  section
 twelve  hundred eleven of this part (and by the corresponding section of
 the New Jersey statute concurring herein);  and accordingly, if  by  the
 effective  date  of  chapter  802  of  the  laws of 1947, this state has
 adopted, or if thereafter it shall adopt general  legislation  governing
 applications for federal aid for air terminals by municipalities of this
 A. 9644  67
 
 state or the receipt or disbursement of such federal aid by or on behalf
 of  such municipalities, such legislation shall apply to applications by
 the port authority for federal aid for air  terminals  located  in  this
 state  in the same manner and to the same extent as other municipalities
 of this state, provided, that if such  legislation  shall  require  such
 applications  for  federal  aid  to  be  approved by any officer, board,
 commission, department or other agency of this state  or  shall  require
 the  consent  of any such agency of this state to the submission thereof
 to the federal government, or shall require  any  such  agency  of  this
 state  to  be  designated by municipalities as their agent to collect or
 disburse such federal aid, or shall contain any other requirement  vest-
 ing  any such agency of this state with power or discretion with respect
 to the making of such applications for federal aid  or  the  receipt  or
 disbursement  thereof,  then such officer, board, commission, department
 or other agency of this state shall have power to waive such requirement
 in whole or in part temporarily  or  permanently  insofar  as  the  port
 authority is concerned.
 
  PART XIII
  EMINENT DOMAIN
 
 Section 1301. Right of eminent domain.
  §  1301.  Right  of  eminent  domain.  The powers granted to the port
 authority by this part shall be deemed to be in aid of and  supplemental
 to and not in limitation or derogation of the powers otherwise conferred
 upon it;  and nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the
 port  authority  from  exercising  the right of eminent domain under and
 pursuant to the eminent domain procedure law of the state of  New  York,
 or  any  other  applicable  law  of  this state, in any case where it is
 authorized so to do.

 to  be  a  resident  of  each  such  county or judicial district for the
 purpose of such suits, actions or proceedings. Although the port author-
 ity is engaged in the performance of governmental  functions,  the  said
 two  states  consent  to  liability on the part of the port authority in
 such suits, actions or proceedings for tortious acts committed by it and
 its agents to the same extent as though it were a private corporation.
  § 1407. Statute of limitations.  The foregoing consent is granted upon

 manner in which the claim arose, and (4) the items of damage or injuries
 claimed  to  have been sustained so far as then practicable. Such notice

 thereof, may be sent by registered mail to the  port  authority  at  its
 principal  office. Where the claimant is a person under the age of eigh-
 teen years or is mentally or physically incapacitated and by  reason  of
 such  disability no notice of claim is filed or suit, action or proceed-
 ing commenced within the time  specified  in  section  fourteen  hundred
 seven  of this part, or where a person entitled to make a claim dies and
 by reason of his death no notice of claim is filed or  suit,  action  or
 proceeding  commenced  within  the  time  specified  in section fourteen
 hundred seven of this part then any court in which such suit, action  or
 proceeding may be brought may in its discretion grant leave to serve the
 notice  of claim and to commence the suit, action or proceeding within a
 reasonable time but in any event within three years after the  cause  of
 action  accrued. Application for such leave must be made upon an affida-

 not  been served, and such application shall be made only upon notice to
 the port authority.
  § 1409. Limits of liability.  The commissioners, officers or employees
 of the port  authority  shall  not  be  subject  to  suits,  actions  or
 proceedings  for judgments, orders or decrees restraining, preventing or
 enjoining them in their official or personal capacities from  committing
 or  continuing to commit any act or acts on behalf of the port authority
 other than suits, actions and proceedings brought by the attorney gener-
 al of New York or by the attorney general of New Jersey or by  the  port
 authority itself--each of said attorneys general being hereby authorized
 to  bring such suits, actions or proceedings in his discretion on behalf
 of any person or persons whatsoever who requests him so to do except  in
 the  cases  excluded  by sections fourteen hundred two, fourteen hundred
 three and fourteen hundred four of this part; provided, that in any such
 suit, action or proceeding brought by either attorney general, no  judg-
 ment,  order  or  decree shall be entered except upon at least two days'
 notice to the defendant of the proposed entry thereof.
  § 1410. Other suits, actions or proceedings.  Nothing herein shall  be
 deemed  to  revoke,  rescind or affect any consents to suits, actions or
 proceedings against the port authority heretofore given by the two  said
 states  in chapter eight hundred two of the laws of New York of nineteen
 hundred forty-seven, as amended, and continued by part XII of this arti-
 cle, and chapter forty-three of the  laws  of  New  Jersey  of  nineteen

 nor shall any vehicle be so constructed, equipped or loaded as to endan-
 ger  unreasonably  or  to  be likely to endanger unreasonably persons or

 obeyed unless a port authority police officer directs otherwise.
 A. 9644  71
 
  §  1505. Driving procedure.  Unless otherwise directed, vehicles shall
 at all times stay to the right of the center of all roadways  except  in

 roadway is marked with traffic lanes vehicles shall not cross markings.
  § 1506. Operation requirements.  No person shall operate a motor vehi-
 cle  in  or  upon  any  part  of  a vehicular crossing unless he is duly
 authorized to operate motor vehicles in the state in which such part  of

 in or upon any part of a vehicular crossing which is not  registered  in
 accordance  with  the  provisions  of the law of the state in which such
 part of the vehicular crossing is located.
  § 1507. Accident protocol.  The operator of any vehicle involved in an
 accident resulting in injury or death to any person  or  damage  to  any
 property  shall  immediately stop such vehicle at the scene of the acci-
 dent, render such assistance as  may  be  needed,  and  give  his  name,
 address,  and  operator's  license and registration number to the person
 injured or to any officer or witness of the injury. The operator of such
 vehicle shall make a report of such accident in accordance with the  law
 of the state in which such accident occurred.
  §  1508. Transport restrictions.  No person shall transport in or upon
 a vehicular crossing, any dynamite, nitroglycerin, black  powder,  fire-
 works,  blasting  caps  or  other  explosives, gasoline, alcohol, ether,
 liquid shellac, kerosene, turpentine, formaldehyde or other  inflammable
 or  combustible  liquids,  ammonium  nitrate, sodium chlorate, wet hemp,
 powdered metallic magnesium, nitro-cellulose film,  peroxides  or  other
 readily  inflammable  solids  or oxidizing materials, hydrochloric acid,

 ic, carbolic acid, potassium cyanide, tear gas, lewisite  or  any  other
 poisonous  substances,  liquids  or gases, or any compressed gas, or any
 radio-active article, substance or material, at such time or place or in
 such manner or condition as to endanger unreasonably or as to be  likely
 to endanger unreasonably persons or property.
  § 1509. Violations.  Violations of the rules and regulations set forth
 in  sections  fifteen  hundred two through fifteen hundred eight of this
 part committed within the territorial limits of either  state  shall  be
 punishable  as  may be provided by the laws of such state but the penal-
 ties prescribed by either state shall not preclude  the  port  authority
 from  excluding  from vehicular crossings permanently or for a specified
 time, all vehicles violating any of the said rules and  regulations,  as
 well  as  other  vehicles  owned or operated by the owner or operator of
 such vehicle.
  § 1510. Definitions.  The following terms as used  herein  shall  have
 the indicated meanings:
  1. "Traffic" shall include pedestrians, ridden animals, herded animals
 and vehicles whether moved by human power or otherwise.
  2.  "Vehicular  crossings"  shall include not only bridges and tunnels
 operated by the port authority, but also their  plazas  and  approaches,
 but  shall  not  include  any lands granted by the port authority to the
 states of New York or New Jersey or to  a  municipality  for  street  or
 highway  purposes even though such street or highway constitutes a means
 of access to or egress from such vehicular crossing.
  § 1511. Severability.  If any term or provision of this part shall  be
 declared  unconstitutional or ineffective in whole or in part by a court
 of competent jurisdiction, then to the extent that it is not unconstitu-
 tional or ineffective, such term or provisions  shall  be  enforced  and
 A. 9644  72
 
 effectuated,  nor  shall  such determination be deemed to invalidate the
 remaining terms or provisions thereof.
  § 1512. Repeal of previous rules and regulations.  The two said states
 agree  that  chapter  two  hundred  fifty-one of the laws of New York of
 nineteen hundred thirty-four, entitled "An act  establishing  rules  and
 regulations  for  the  control  of traffic on the interstate bridges and
 tunnels operated by the Port  of  New  York  Authority  and  prescribing
 proceedings and penalties for their violations", and chapter one hundred
 forty-six  of  the pamphlet laws of New Jersey, nineteen hundred thirty-
 two, entitled "An act establishing rules and regulations for the control
 of traffic on the inter-state bridges and tunnels operated by  the  Port
 of  New  York  Authority  and  prescribing proceedings and penalties for
 their violations", shall be and are repealed as of the  date  this  part
 takes effect.
  §  1513. Agreement between the states.  This section and the preceding
 sections of this part, together with the corresponding sections  of  the
 act  of  the  state of New Jersey concurring herein, shall constitute an
 agreement between the states of New York and New Jersey supplementary to
 the compact between the  two  states  dated  April  thirtieth,  nineteen
 hundred  twenty-one,  and  amendatory  thereof,  and  shall be liberally
 construed to effectuate the purposes of said compact and of  the  agree-
 ments  of the two states amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto; and
 shall be construed to be in aid of and supplemental to and not in  limi-
 tation  of  or  in derogation of the powers heretofore conferred upon or
 delegated to the port authority.
  § 1514. Compliance with state law.  If the violation within the  state
 of  any  of  the  rules  and  regulations  set forth in sections fifteen
 hundred two through fifteen hundred eight of this part including but not
 limited to those regarding the payment of tolls, would have been a felo-
 ny, misdemeanor or other punishable offense if committed on  any  public
 road,  street,  highway  or  turnpike  in the municipality in which such
 violation occurred, it shall be tried and punished in the same manner as
 if it had been committed on such public road, street, highway  or  turn-
 pike.
  §  1515. Felonies.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section fifteen
 hundred fourteen of this part, if the violation within the state of  the
 rule  and  regulation  set forth in section fifteen hundred nine of this
 part shall result in injury or death to a person or persons or damage to
 property in excess of the value of five thousand dollars, such violation
 shall constitute a felony.
  § 1516. Misdemeanors.  Except as provided in sections fifteen  hundred
 fourteen  and fifteen hundred fifteen of this part, any violation within
 the state of any of the rules and  regulations  set  forth  in  sections
 fifteen hundred two through fifteen hundred eight of this part including
 but  not  limited to those regarding the payment of tolls, shall consti-
 tute a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as an offense  triable  in  a
 magistrate's  court  by  a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or by
 imprisonment not exceeding sixty days or by both such fine and imprison-
 ment.
  § 1517. Owner liability for failure of operator to  comply  with  toll
 collection  regulations of the port authority. Notwithstanding any other
 provision of law and  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section
 fifteen hundred eighteen of this part, an owner of a vehicle may be held
 liable  for  failure  of  an  operator  thereof  to comply with the toll
 collection regulations of the port authority of New York and New  Jersey
 (hereinafter  called  port  authority).  The owner of a vehicle shall be
 A. 9644  73
 
 liable pursuant to this section if such vehicle  was  used  or  operated
 with  the  permission  of the owner, express or implied, in violation of
 the  toll  collection  regulations  of  the  port  authority,  and  such
 violation  is  evidenced by information obtained from a photo-monitoring
 system, provided, however, that no owner of a vehicle  shall  be  liable
 where  the operator of such vehicle has been convicted of a violation of
 those toll collection regulations for the same incident.
  § 1518. Imposition of liability for failure of operator to comply with
 toll collection regulations of the port  authority.  The  liability  set
 forth  in  section  fifteen  hundred  seventeen  of  this part, shall be
 imposed upon an owner for  a  violation  by  an  operator  of  the  toll
 collection regulations of the port authority occurring within the terri-
 torial limits of the state of New York in accordance with the following:
  1.  For  the purposes of this section, the term "owner" shall mean any
 person, corporation, partnership, firm, agency, association, lessor,  or
 organization  who,  at  the time of the violation in any city in which a
 vehicle is operated: (a) is the beneficial or equitable  owner  of  such
 vehicle;  or  (b) has title to such vehicle; or (c) is the registrant or
 co-registrant of such vehicle which is registered with the department of
 motor vehicles of this state or any other  state,  territory,  district,
 province,  nation  or  other jurisdiction; or (d) subject to the limita-
 tions set forth in subdivision six of this section, uses such vehicle in
 its vehicle renting and/or leasing business; and includes (e)  a  person
 entitled  to  the  use and possession of a vehicle subject to a security
 interest in another person. For the purposes of this section,  the  term
 "operator"  shall mean any person, corporation, firm, partnership, agen-
 cy, association, organization or lessee that uses or operates a  vehicle
 with  or  without the permission of the owner, and an owner who operates
 his or her own vehicle. For purposes of this section, the  term  "photo-
 monitoring  system"  shall  mean  a  vehicle sensor installed to work in
 conjunction with a toll collection facility which automatically produces
 one or more photographs, one or more microphotographs,  a  videotape  or
 other recorded images of each vehicle at the time it is used or operated
 in  violation  of the toll collection regulations of the port authority.
 For purposes of this section, the term "toll collection  regulations  of
 the  port  authority"  shall refer to the traffic regulations for inter-
 state vehicular crossings operated by the port authority as set forth in
 this part and in chapter one hundred  ninety-two  of  the  laws  of  New
 Jersey  of  nineteen hundred fifty, and specifically that section of the
 laws which prohibits traffic in or upon vehicular crossings operated  by
 the  port  authority  except  upon  the  payment of such tolls and other
 charges as may from time to time be prescribed by the port authority and
 which further makes it unlawful for any person to refuse to pay,  or  to
 evade or to attempt to evade the payment of such tolls or other charges.
 For purposes of this section, the term "vehicle" shall mean every device
 in,  upon,  or by which a person or property is or may be transported or
 drawn upon a highway, except devices used  exclusively  upon  stationary
 rails or tracks.
  2. A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by an agent of the port author-
 ity,  or  a  facsimile  thereof,  based  upon inspection of photographs,
 microphotographs, videotape or  other  recorded  images  produced  by  a
 photo-monitoring  system  shall  be  prima  facie  evidence of the facts
 contained therein and shall be admissible in any proceeding  charging  a
 violation of toll collection regulations of the port authority, provided
 that  any  photographs,  microphotographs,  videotape  or other recorded
 images evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection and
 A. 9644  74
 
 admission into evidence in any proceeding to  adjudicate  the  liability
 for such violation.
  3.  An imposition of liability pursuant to this section shall be based
 upon a preponderance of evidence as submitted. An imposition of  liabil-
 ity  pursuant  to  this  section  shall not be deemed a conviction of an
 operator and shall not be made  part  of  the  motor  vehicle  operating
 record,  furnished  pursuant  to section three hundred fifty-four of the
 vehicle and traffic law, of the  person  upon  whom  such  liability  is
 imposed  nor shall it be used for insurance purposes in the provision of
 motor vehicle insurance coverage.
  4. (a) A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each
 person alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation pursuant to this
 section of the toll collection regulations of the port  authority.  Such
 notice  shall  be  mailed  no  later  than thirty days after the alleged
 violation. Personal delivery on the owner shall not be required. A manu-
 al or automatic record of mailing prepared in  the  ordinary  course  of
 business shall be prima facie evidence of the mailing of the notice.
  (b)  A  notice  of liability shall contain the name and address of the
 person alleged to be liable as an owner for  a  violation  of  the  toll
 collection  regulations  of the port authority pursuant to this section,
 the registration number of the vehicle involved in such  violation,  the
 location  where  such  violation  took  place, the date and time of such
 violation and the identification number of the  photo-monitoring  system
 which recorded the violation or other document locator number.
  (c)  The  notice  of  liability shall contain information advising the
 person charged of the manner and the time in which he  may  contest  the
 liability  alleged  in  the  notice. Such notice of liability shall also
 contain a warning to advise the persons charged that failure to  contest
 in  the manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission of liabil-
 ity and that a default judgment may be entered thereon.
  (d) The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by  the  port
 authority or its duly authorized agent.
  5. If an owner receives a notice of liability pursuant to this section
 for  any time period during which the vehicle was reported to the police
 department as having been stolen, it shall be  a  valid  defense  to  an
 allegation  of  liability  for  a violation of the toll collection regu-
 lations of the port authority that the vehicle had been reported to  the
 police  as  stolen  prior to the time the violation occurred and had not
 been recovered by such time. If an owner receives a notice of  liability
 pursuant  to  this  section for any time period during which the vehicle
 was stolen, but not as yet reported to the police as having been stolen,
 it shall be a  valid  defense  to  an  allegation  of  liability  for  a
 violation  of toll collection regulations of the port authority pursuant
 to this section that the vehicle was reported as stolen within two hours
 after discovery of the theft by the owner. For purposes of asserting the
 defense provided by this subdivision, it  shall  be  sufficient  that  a
 certified  copy  of  the  police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by
 first class mail to the court or other entity having jurisdiction.
  6. An owner, as defined in paragraph (a) of subdivision  one  of  this
 section, who is a lessor of a vehicle to which a notice of liability was
 issued  pursuant to subdivision four of this section shall not be liable
 pursuant to this section for the violation of the toll collection  regu-
 lations  of the port authority provided that he or she sends to the port
 authority serving the notice of liability and  to  the  court  or  other
 entity  having  jurisdiction  a  copy of the rental, lease or other such
 contract document covering such vehicle on the date  of  the  violation,
 A. 9644  75
 
 with  the  name and address of the lessee clearly legible, within thirty
 days after receiving from the port  authority  or  its  duly  authorized
 agent the original notice of liability. Failure to send such information
 within  such  thirty  day time period shall render the lessor liable for
 the penalty prescribed by this section. Where the lessor  complies  with
 the  provisions  of  this subdivision, the lessee of such vehicle on the
 date of such violation shall be deemed to be the owner of  such  vehicle
 for  purposes  of this section and shall be subject to liability for the
 violation of toll collection regulations of the port authority  provided
 that  the  port authority or its duly authorized agent mails a notice of
 liability to the lessee within ten days after the court, or other entity
 having jurisdiction, deems the lessee to be the owner. For  purposes  of
 this  subdivision  the term "lessor" shall mean any person, corporation,
 firm, partnership, agency, association or organization  engaged  in  the
 business  of  renting  or  leasing vehicles to any lessee under a rental
 agreement, lease or otherwise wherein the said lessee has the  exclusive
 use  of  said  vehicle  for any period of time. For the purposes of this
 subdivision, the term "lessee" shall mean any person, corporation, firm,
 partnership, agency, association or organization that rents,  leases  or
 contracts  for  the  use  of  one or more vehicles and has exclusive use
 thereof for any period of time.
  7. Except as provided in subdivision six of this section, if a  person
 receives  a  notice  of liability pursuant to this section it shall be a
 valid defense to an allegation of liability  for  a  violation  of  toll
 collection  regulations  of  the  port authority that the individual who
 received the notice of liability pursuant to this section  was  not  the
 owner  of  the  vehicle at the time the violation occurred. If the owner
 liable for a violation of the toll collection regulations  of  the  port
 authority  pursuant  to this section was not the operator of the vehicle
 at the time of the violation, the  owner  may  maintain  an  action  for
 indemnification  against  the  operator. The operator of the vehicle may
 apply to the court or other entity having jurisdiction to adjudicate the
 liability imposed under this section to accept  responsibility  for  the
 violation  and  satisfactorily  discharge all applicable tolls, charges,
 and penalties related to the violation.
  8. "Electronic toll collection system" shall mean a system of collect-
 ing tolls or charges which is capable of charging an account holder  the
 appropriate  toll or charge by transmission of information from an elec-
 tronic device on a motor vehicle to the toll lane, which information  is
 used  to  charge the account the appropriate toll or charge. In adopting
 procedures for the preparation and mailing of a notice of liability, the
 port authority or its duly authorized agent shall  adopt  guidelines  to
 ensure  adequate  and  timely  notice  to all electronic toll collection
 system account holders to inform them when  their  accounts  are  delin-
 quent.  An  owner  who  is  an  account holder under the electronic toll
 collection system shall not be found liable  for  a  violation  of  this
 section  unless such authority has first sent a notice of delinquency to
 such account holder and the account holder was in fact delinquent at the
 time of the violation.
  9. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit  the  liability
 of  an  operator  of  a vehicle for any violation of the toll collection
 regulations of the port authority. Nothing in this section shall author-
 ize or preclude the port authority from excluding from any of its facil-
 ities, in its sole discretion, any or all vehicles  found  liable  under
 this section as well as other vehicles owned or operated by the owner or
 operator of such vehicle.
 A. 9644  76
 
  10.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law, all photographs,
 microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images  prepared  pursuant
 to  this section shall be for the exclusive use of the port authority in
 the discharge of its duties under this section and shall not be open  to
 the  public nor be used in any court in any action or proceeding pending
 therein unless such action or proceeding relates to the imposition of or
 indemnification for liability pursuant to this section. The port author-
 ity or its duly authorized agent shall  not  sell,  distribute  or  make
 available  in  any  way,  the  names  and  addresses  of electronic toll
 collection system account holders,  or  any  information  compiled  from
 transactions  with  such  account holders, without such account holders'
 consent to any entity that will use such information for any  commercial
 purpose  provided  that the foregoing restriction shall not be deemed to
 preclude the exchange of such  information  between  any  entities  with
 jurisdiction  over  and or operating a toll highway bridge and/or tunnel
 facility.
  § 1519.  Adjudication of liability.  Adjudication  of  the  liability
 imposed  upon an owner by section fifteen hundred seventeen of this part
 for a violation of the toll collection regulations of the port authority
 occurring within the territorial limits of the state of New  York  shall
 be  in  accordance  with  sections  two hundred thirty-five, two hundred
 thirty-six, two  hundred  thirty-seven,  two  hundred  thirty-nine,  two
 hundred  forty,  two  hundred  forty-one,  five hundred ten and eighteen
 hundred nine of the vehicle and traffic law, or by  such  entity  having
 jurisdiction  over  violations of the toll collection regulations of the
 port authority occurring within the territorial limits of the  state  of
 New  York, provided that all violations shall be heard and determined in
 the county in which the violation is alleged to  have  occurred,  or  by
 consent of both parties, in any county in the state of New York in which
 the  port  authority  operates  or maintains a facility.  An owner found
 liable for a violation of toll collection regulations pursuant  to  this
 section  shall  for  a  first violation thereof be liable for a monetary
 penalty not to exceed fifty dollars or two times the toll evaded  which-
 ever  is  greater;  for  a second violation thereof both within eighteen
 months be liable for a  monetary  penalty  not  to  exceed  one  hundred
 dollars  or five times the toll evaded whichever is greater; for a third
 or subsequent violation thereof all within eighteen months be liable for
 a monetary penalty not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars or ten  times
 the toll evaded whichever is greater.

 facilitate  the  flow  of traffic between the two states, will alleviate
 congestion in the vehicular crossings  of  the  Hudson  river  and  will
 promote  the  movement of commerce between the two states by providing a
 direct connection between the state of New Jersey and Long Island in the
 state of New York by way of Staten Island and that it is  therefore  the
 policy of the two said states to provide such bridge.
  §  2002.  Authorization for construction. In furtherance of the afore-
 said policy, and in partial effectuation of the comprehensive plan here-
 tofore adopted by the two said states for the development  of  the  said
 port  district,  the Port of New York Authority is hereby authorized and
 empowered to construct, own, maintain and operate a bridge  (hereinafter

 connections  with  highways  and with the bridges between New Jersey and
 Staten Island as the Port Authority may  deem  necessary  or  desirable.
 A. 9644  82
 
 The Port Authority may effectuate such approaches or connections, in its
 discretion,  by  agreement with any other public agency, which agreement
 may provide for the construction, ownership, maintenance or operation of
 such approaches or connections by such other public agency.
  The  Port Authority shall not commence the construction of the Narrows
 bridge until after the  execution  of  an  agreement  between  the  Port
 Authority  and  the  Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (hereinafter
 called the Triborough Authority) pursuant to section two  thousand  four
 of this part.
  §  2003. Definitions.  The following terms as used in this part shall
 mean:
  "Bonds" shall mean bonds, notes, securities or  other  obligations  or
 evidences of indebtedness.

 interest upon and amortization and retirement of and the fulfillment  of
 the terms of all bonds which it may have issued in connection therewith.

 and occupancy of the Triborough Authority, and
  (2) For judgments, orders or decrees restraining or enjoining the Port
 Authority from committing or continuing to commit other breaches of such
 agreement or any amendment thereof;  provided, that such judgment, order
 or  decree  shall  not  be  entered  except upon two days' prior written
 notice to the Port Authority of the proposed entry thereof and  provided
 further, that upon an appeal taken by the Port Authority from such judg-
 ment,  order or decree the service of the notice of appeal shall perfect
 the appeal and shall stay the  execution  of  such  judgment,  order  or
 decree appealed from, without an undertaking or other security.
  Nothing  herein contained shall be deemed to revoke, rescind or affect
 any consents to suits, actions or proceedings against the Port Authority
 heretofore given by the two said states in chapter three hundred one  of
 the laws of New York of nineteen hundred fifty and continued by part XIV
 of  this  article and chapter two hundred four of the laws of New Jersey
 of nineteen hundred fifty-one.
  § 2005. Funding.  The moneys in the general reserve fund of  the  Port
 Authority  may  be  pledged in whole or in part by the Port Authority as
 security for or applied by it to the  repayment  with  interest  of  any
 moneys  which  it  may raise upon Narrows bridge bonds issued by it from
 time to time and the moneys in said general reserve fund may be  applied
 by the Port Authority to the fulfillment of any other undertakings which
 it may assume to or for the benefit of the holders of any such bonds.
  Subject  to prior liens and pledges (and to the obligation of the Port
 Authority to apply revenues to the maintenance of  its  general  reserve
 fund in the amount prescribed by the general reserve fund statutes), the
 revenues of the Port Authority from facilities established, constructed,
 acquired  or  effectuated  through  the issuance or sale of bonds of the
 A. 9644  84
 
 Port Authority secured by a pledge of its general reserve  fund  may  be
 pledged  in  whole  or  in  part as security for or applied by it to the
 repayment with interest of any moneys which it may  raise  upon  Narrows
 bridge  bonds, and said revenues may be applied by the Port Authority to
 the fulfillment of any other undertakings which it may assume to or  for
 the benefit of the holders of such bonds.
  In  the  event that at any time the balance of moneys theretofore paid
 into the general reserve fund and not applied therefrom shall exceed  an
 amount  equal  to  one-tenth  of  the  par  value of all bonds legal for
 investment, as defined and limited in the general reserve fund statutes,
 issued by the Port Authority and currently outstanding at such time,  by
 reason  of the retirement of Narrows bridge bonds the par value of which
 had theretofore been included in the computation of said one-tenth, then
 the Port Authority may pledge or apply such excess for and only for  the
 purposes for which it is authorized by the general reserve fund statutes
 to pledge the moneys in the general reserve fund, and such pledge may be
 made in advance of the time when such excess may occur.
  §  2006.  Bi-state  covenant.  The two states covenant and agree with
 each other and with the holders of Narrows bridge bonds as security  for
 which  there may or shall be pledged (directly or indirectly, or through
 the medium of its general reserve fund or otherwise)  the  revenues,  or
 any  part  thereof, of the Narrows bridge or any other facility owned or
 operated by the Port Authority, that the two states will not, so long as
 any of such bonds remain outstanding and unpaid, diminish or impair  the
 power of the Port Authority to establish, levy and collect tolls, rents,
 charges  or other fees in connection with the Narrows bridge (so long as
 the Port Authority shall retain title to such bridge) or any such  other
 facility;  and that the two said states will not, so long as any of such
 bonds  remain  outstanding  and unpaid and so long as the Port Authority
 shall retain title to the Narrows bridge, authorize the construction  of
 any  other  vehicular  bridges or tunnels (other than bridges or tunnels
 exclusively for railway rapid transit purposes)  between  Staten  Island
 and Long Island by any person or body other than the Port Authority.
  §  2007. Security bonds.  Narrows bridge bonds are hereby made securi-
 ties in which all state  and  municipal  officers  and  bodies  of  both
 states, all banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks, building and
 loan  associations,  savings and loan associations, investment companies
 and other persons carrying on a banking business, all  insurance  compa-
 nies,  insurance associations and other persons carrying on an insurance
 business, and all administrators,  executors,  guardians,  trustees  and
 other  fiduciaries, and all other persons whatsoever, who are now or may
 hereafter be authorized by either state  to  invest  in  bonds  of  such
 state,  may  properly  and  legally invest any funds, including capital,
 belonging to them or within their control;  and said bonds  are  hereby
 made  securities  which  may  properly and legally be deposited with and
 shall be received by any state or municipal officer or agency of  either
 state  for  any  purpose for which the deposit of bonds of such state is
 now or may hereafter be authorized.
  § 2008. Authorization to acquire real property.  If the Port Authority
 shall find it necessary or convenient to acquire any real  property  for
 Narrows  bridge  purposes  (including  temporary construction, rehabili-
 tation or improvement), whether for immediate or future  use,  the  Port
 Authority  may  find  and  determine  that  such property, whether a fee
 simple absolute or a lesser interest, is required for a public use,  and
 upon  such  determination the said property shall be and shall be deemed
 to be required for such public use until  otherwise  determined  by  the
 A. 9644  85

 Port Authority, and such determination shall not be affected by the fact
 that such property has theretofore been taken for and is then devoted to
 a public use; but the public use in the hands of or under the control of
 the  Port  Authority  shall  be deemed superior to the public use in the
 hands of any other person, association or  corporation.  If  the  Port
 Authority shall find it necessary or convenient hereunder to acquire any
 real  property which is then devoted to a public use, the Port Authority
 shall have power to exchange or substitute any other real  property  for
 such  real  property  upon terms agreed to by the Port Authority and the
 owner of such property then devoted to a public use,  and  to  find  and
 determine  that  such  other real property is also required for a public
 use; upon such determination the said other property shall be and  shall
 be deemed to be required for such public use.
  The Port Authority may acquire and is hereby authorized to acquire any
 real  property  in the state of New York required for a public use under
 the preceding paragraph, whether a  fee  simple  absolute  or  a  lesser
 estate,  by the exercise of the right of eminent domain under and pursu-
 ant to the eminent domain procedure law of the state of New York, or  at
 the  option  of  the  Port Authority pursuant to any other and alternate
 procedure provided by law by such state.  Nothing herein contained shall
 be construed to prevent the Port Authority from bringing any proceedings
 in either state to remove a cloud on title or such other proceedings  as
 it  may, in its discretion, deem proper and necessary, or from acquiring
 any such property in either state by negotiation or purchase.
  Where a person entitled to an award  remains  in  possession  of  such
 property  after  the time of the vesting of title in the Port Authority,
 the reasonable value of his use and occupancy of  such  property  subse-
 quent  to  such  time,  as  fixed  by  agreement or by the court in such
 proceedings or by any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be  a  lien
 against  such  award, subject only to liens of record at the time of the
 vesting of title in the Port Authority.
  § 2009. Prior consent required. Anything in this part to the  contrary
 notwithstanding,  no  property now or hereafter vested in or held by the
 city of New York shall be  taken  by  the  Port  Authority  without  the
 authority  or  consent  of the city as provided in said compact of April
 thirty, nineteen hundred twenty-one. The Port Authority is  also  hereby
 authorized  and  empowered to acquire from said city by agreement there-
 with, and the city, notwithstanding any contrary provision  of  law,  is
 hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to  grant and convey upon reasonable
 terms and conditions any real property which the  Port  Authority  shall
 find  to  be  necessary for Narrows bridge purposes, including such real
 property as has already been devoted to a public use.  The state of  New
 York  hereby  consents to the use and occupation of the real property of
 such state which the Port Authority  shall  find  to  be  necessary  for
 Narrows bridge purposes, including lands of the state lying under water,
 and the department, board or division or other agency of the state exer-
 cising  supervision  of such property shall execute such documents as it
 may deem necessary to evidence the right to such use and occupation.
  § 2010. Authorization of agents to enter property.  The Port Authority
 and its duly authorized agents, and all persons acting under its author-
 ity and by its direction, may enter in the daytime  into  and  upon  any
 real  property  which it shall be necessary so to enter, for the purpose
 of making such surveys, diagrams, maps or plans, or for the  purpose  of
 making  such  soundings or borings as the Port Authority may deem neces-
 sary or convenient for the purposes of this part and the concurrent  act
 of the state of New Jersey.
 A. 9644  86
 
  §  2011. Essential government function.  The construction, maintenance
 and operation of the Narrows bridge are and will be in all respects  for
 the  benefit of the people of the states of New York and New Jersey, for

 out  of  the  proceeds  of  the joint sale of various properties of such
 creditors theretofore used by such lessee, including such railroad  cars

  (d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subdivision, any rail-
 road cars purchased by the port authority with the proceeds of the issu-
 ance  by the port authority of any series of bonds or other evidences of
 indebtedness shall become the property of this  state  after  the  final
 payment  of  all  the  bonds  or other evidences of indebtedness of such
 series, and thereafter shall be held by the port  authority  subject  to
 the  disposition  of  this state, and any railroad cars purchased by the
 port authority with any advances from this state shall become the  prop-
 erty of this state upon the repayment of all such advances solely out of
 rentals  in  excess  of  the  port authority's administrative, legal and
 financial expenses in connection therewith;  or if the proceeds of  port
 authority  bonds  or other evidences of indebtedness of any series shall
 have been applied to repay all or any portion  of  such  advances,  then
 such cars shall become the property of this state upon the final payment
 of  all  such  bonds  or  other  evidences  of such indebtedness of such
 series.
  (e)(i) To the extent authorized by the constitution at the time of the
 issuance of bonds or notes of the port authority for any of the purposes
 of this part, the punctual payment of such bonds and notes shall be, and
 the same hereby is, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the state of
 New York, both as to principal and interest, according to  their  terms;
 and such guaranty shall be expressed upon the face thereof by the signa-
 ture  or  facsimile signature of the comptroller or a deputy comptroller
 of the state of New York.  If the port authority shall fail to pay, when
 due, the principal of, or interest upon, such bonds or notes, such comp-
 troller shall pay the holder thereof.  In furtherance of  such  guaranty
 of  punctual  payment,  if  the  comptroller of this state shall receive
 written notice from the trustee or other fiduciary or other duly author-
 ized representative of the holder or holders of  such  bonds  and  notes
 designated  in  any agreement between the port authority and such holder
 or holders that the port authority has failed to  make  or  deposit  any
 payment  of  interest or principal required by such agreement to or with
 such trustee or fiduciary or otherwise at or before the  time  specified
 in  such agreement, then such comptroller shall within three days of the
 receipt of such notice pay to such trustee or fiduciary  or  other  duly
 authorized representative the amount necessary to meet any deficiency in
 the payment of such interest and principal, when due.
  If  the  comptroller shall make a payment or payments pursuant to this
 subparagraph, the state shall be subrogated to the rights of  the  bond-
 holders  or  noteholders to whom, or on account of whom, such payment or
 payments were made, in and to the revenues pledged to such holders;  and
 for such purpose, to the extent any such revenues in the  hands  of  the
 port  authority may be inadequate to repay such payment or payments made
 by the state, the state shall be further subrogated to the rights of the
 port authority to recover any rentals due and unpaid to the port author-
 ity as of the date of such payment or payments and pledged to such hold-
 ers as aforesaid.
 A. 9644  91
 
  (ii) Such bonds and notes shall be sold by the port authority in  such
 manner  and at such time as the port authority, with the approval of the
 comptroller, shall determine. The proceeds of  each  sale  of  bonds  or
 notes  shall  be  applied  to  the  purpose or purposes set forth in the
 resolution  of the port authority authorizing the issuance of such bonds
 or notes. If, after having accomplished  the  purpose  or  purposes  set
 forth in such resolution there remains any unexpended balance (including
 interest earned by the port authority on such proceeds), such unexpended
 balance  shall be applied by the port authority, to the extent practica-
 ble, to the purchase for retirement or to the  redemption  of  bonds  or
 notes  included  in  such  sale,  or otherwise as the port authority may
 determine for the purposes of this part.  If  any  commuter  car,  the
 acquisition  of which is financed or refinanced by the issuance of bonds
 or notes under this part, be lost, damaged or destroyed, the proceeds of
 any insurance policies covering such loss, damage or destruction or  any
 payments made to the port authority by the lessee of such car on account
 of such loss, damage or destruction shall be applied by the port author-
 ity, to the extent practicable, to the purchase for retirement or to the
 redemption  of  bonds  or notes of such series, or otherwise as the port
 authority may determine for the purposes of this part.
  (iii) The port authority is designated as the agent of  the  state  of
 New  York  for the purpose of selling, leasing or otherwise disposing of
 any railroad cars which shall become the property of the state  pursuant
 to  paragraph (d) of this subdivision.  As such agent the port authority
 may agree, upon such terms and conditions as may be  deemed  appropriate
 by it, with any lessee of railroad cars or with any other person, either
 in advance of or after the time when such cars shall become the property
 of  the  state, so to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of such cars.  In
 the event any such cars are so sold, leased or otherwise disposed of  by
 the  port  authority, the port authority shall pay over to the state, as
 promptly after receipt  as  may  be  practicable,  any  balance  of  the
 proceeds  thereof,  which remain after deduction of the port authority's
 administrative, legal and financial expenses in connection with or aris-
 ing out of such sale, lease or other disposition.

 states as their joint agent for the development  of  the  transportation

  3. In furtherance of the aforesaid findings and determinations and  in
 partial effectuation of and supplemental to the comprehensive plan here-
 A. 9644  97
 
 tofore  adopted  by  the two said states for the development of the said
 port district, the port authority is hereby authorized and empowered  to
 establish,  acquire,  construct,  effectuate, develop, own, lease, main-
 tain,  operate, improve and rehabilitate a project herein referred to as
 the port development project, which  shall  consist  of  a  facility  of
 commerce  herein  referred  to  as the world trade center, to be located
 within the Hudson tubes-world trade center area, and railroad facilities
 herein referred to as the Hudson tubes and the Hudson tubes  extensions.
 The  port  authority  shall  proceed as rapidly as may be practicable to
 accomplish the purposes of this part.
  The port authority is hereby authorized and  empowered  to  establish,
 levy  and  collect such rentals, tolls, fares, fees and other charges as
 it may deem necessary, proper or desirable in connection with any facil-
 ity or part of any facility constituting a portion of the port  develop-
 ment project and to issue bonds for any of the purposes of this part and
 to  provide for payment thereof, with interest upon and the amortization
 and retirement of such bonds, and to secure all or any portion  of  such
 bonds by a pledge of such rentals, tolls, fares, fees, charges and other
 revenues  or any part thereof (including but not limited to the revenues
 of any subsidiary corporation incorporated for any of  the  purposes  of
 this  part), and to secure all or any portion of such bonds by mortgages
 upon any property held or to be held by the port authority  (or  by  any
 such  subsidiary  corporation) for any of the purposes of this part, and
 for any of the purposes of this part to exercise all appropriate  powers
 heretofore  or  hereafter  delegated to it by the states of New York and
 New Jersey, including, but not limited to, those expressly set forth  in
 this  part.  The surplus revenues of the port development project may be
 pledged in whole or in part as hereinafter provided.
  Unless and until hereafter expressly authorized by the two states  the
 port  authority  shall not: (a) operate or permit operation by others of
 its Hudson tubes railroad cars or other rolling stock  or  equipment  or
 Hudson  tubes  extensions railroad cars or other rolling stock or equip-
 ment except upon the rail transit lines of the Hudson tubes  or  of  the
 Hudson  tubes  extensions and also between the Market street station and
 the South street station of the Pennsylvania  railroad  company  in  the
 city  of  Newark,  state  of  New Jersey; or (b) except by way of Hudson
 tubes extensions as herein defined, make additions, betterments or other
 improvements to or of said Hudson tubes or Hudson  tubes  extensions  by
 way  of extensions of their rail transit lines. Nothing herein contained
 shall be deemed to prevent the making by  the  port  authority  of  such
 joint service or other agreements with railroads as it shall deem neces-
 sary, convenient or desirable for the use of the Hudson tubes and Hudson
 tubes  extensions  by the railroad cars or other rolling stock or equip-
 ment of such railroads and the acquisition of the rights of any  or  all
 parties  in any joint service or other agreements the Hudson & Manhattan
 railroad company or its successors shall have made with other  railroads
 for  such  use of the Hudson tubes. The port authority shall not proceed
 with the effectuation of any railroad or railroad facility  in  addition
 to  the  Hudson  tubes  and  the Hudson tubes extensions until hereafter
 expressly authorized by the two states. Nothing contained in  this  part
 shall authorize or empower the port authority to establish, construct or
 otherwise effectuate an air terminal.
  4.  The  moneys in the general reserve fund may be pledged in whole or
 in part by the port authority as security for or applied by  it  to  the
 repayment  with  interest  of  any  moneys which it may raise upon bonds
 issued or incurred by it from time to time for any of  the  purposes  of
 A. 9644  98
 
 this part or upon bonds secured in whole or in part by the pledge of the
 revenues  from  the  port  development project or any portion thereof or
 upon bonds both so issued or incurred and so secured;  and the moneys in
 said  general  reserve  fund may be applied by the port authority to the
 fulfillment of any other undertakings which it may assume to or for  the
 benefit of the holders of any such bonds.
  Subject  to prior liens and pledges (and to the obligation of the port
 authority to apply revenues to the maintenance of  its  general  reserve
 fund in the amount prescribed by the general reserve fund statutes), the
 revenues from facilities established, constructed, acquired or otherwise
 effectuated  through the issuance or sale of bonds of the port authority
 secured in whole or in part by a pledge of its general reserve  fund  or
 any  portion  thereof may be pledged in whole or in part as security for
 or applied by it to any of the purposes  of  this  part,  including  the
 repayment  with  interest  of  any  moneys which it may raise upon bonds
 issued or incurred from time to time for any of  the  purposes  of  this
 part  or  upon  bonds  secured  in whole or in part by the pledge of the
 revenues of the port authority from the port development project or  any
 portion thereof or upon bonds both so issued or incurred and so secured;
 and  said  revenues may be applied by the port authority to the fulfill-
 ment of any other undertakings which it may assume to or for the benefit
 of the holders of such bonds.
  5. In all cases where the port authority has raised or shall hereafter
 raise moneys for any of the purposes of this part by the issue and  sale
 of bonds which are secured in whole or in part by a pledge of the gener-
 al  reserve  fund  or any portion thereof, the surplus revenues from any
 facility constituting a portion of  the  port  development  project  and
 financed  in  whole or in part out of the proceeds of such bonds and the
 surplus revenue from any  other  port  authority  facility  the  surplus
 revenues  of  which at such time may be payable into the general reserve
 fund shall be pooled and applied by the port authority to the establish-
 ment and maintenance of the general reserve fund in an amount  equal  to
 one-tenth of the par value of all bonds legal for investment, as defined
 in  the  general reserve fund statutes, issued by the port authority and
 currently outstanding, including  such  bonds  issued  for  any  of  the
 purposes  of this part; and all such moneys in said general reserve fund
 may be pledged and applied in the manner provided in the general reserve
 fund statutes.
  In the event that any time the balance of moneys theretofore paid into
 the general reserve fund and  not  applied  therefrom  shall  exceed  an
 amount equal to one-tenth of the par value of all bonds upon the princi-
 pal  amount  of  which  the amount of the general reserve fund is calcu-
 lated, by reason of the retirement of bonds issued or incurred from time
 to time for any of the purposes of this part the par value of which  had
 theretofore  been  included  in  the  computation  of said amount of the
 general reserve fund, then the port authority may pledge or  apply  such
 excess  for  and only for the purposes for which it is authorized by the
 general reserve fund statutes  to  pledge  the  moneys  in  the  general
 reserve  fund  and  such  pledge may be made in advance of the time when
 such excess may occur.
  6. The two states covenant and agree with  each  other  and  with  the
 holders  of  any affected bonds, as hereinafter defined, that so long as
 any of such bonds remain outstanding and unpaid and the holders  thereof
 shall  not  have  given their consent as provided in their contract with
 the port authority, the two states will not diminish or impair the power
 of the port authority (or any subsidiary  corporation  incorporated  for
 A. 9644  99
 
 any  of  the  purposes  of  this  part)  to  establish, levy and collect
 rentals, tolls, fares, fees or other  charges  in  connection  with  any
 facility  constituting  a portion of the port development project or any
 other  facility  owned  or  operated  by the port authority of which the
 revenues have been or shall be pledged in whole or in part  as  security
 for  such  bonds  (directly  or indirectly, or through the medium of the
 general reserve fund or otherwise), or to determine the quantity, quali-
 ty, frequency or nature of the service provided in connection with  each
 such facility.
  "Affected  bonds"  as used in this subdivision shall mean bonds of the
 port authority issued or incurred by it from time to time for any of the
 purposes of this part or bonds as security for which there may or  shall
 be pledged, in whole or in part, the general reserve fund or any reserve
 fund  established  by or pursuant to contract between the port authority
 and the holders of such bonds,  or  the  revenues  of  the  world  trade
 center,  Hudson  tubes,  Hudson  tubes  extensions or any other facility
 owned or operated by the port authority any surplus  revenues  of  which
 would  be payable into the general reserve fund, or bonds both so issued
 or incurred and so secured.
  7. The port authority is authorized and empowered to  co-operate  with
 the  states  of New York and New Jersey, with any municipality, with the
 federal government and with any agency or commission of any one or  more
 of the foregoing, or with any one or more of them, for and in connection
 with  the  acquisition,  clearance,  replanning,  rehabilitation, recon-
 struction or redevelopment of the Hudson tubes-world trade  center  area
 or  of  any  other area forming part of the port development project for
 the purpose of renewal and improvement of said area and for any  of  the
 purposes of this part, and to enter into an agreement or agreements (and
 from time to time to enter into agreements amending or supplementing the
 same)  with  any  such  municipality,  commission or agency and with the
 states of New York and New Jersey and with the  federal  government,  or
 with  any one or more of them, for or relating to such purposes, includ-
 ing but not limited to agreements with respect to financial  assistance,
 loans and grants as provided in title one of the housing act of nineteen
 hundred  forty-nine  and  all  federal  laws amendatory and supplemental
 thereto and with respect to occupancy of space in the  port  development
 project.  The port authority is hereby authorized and empowered to apply
 for and accept financial assistance, loans and grants for such  purposes
 under  federal, state or local laws, and to make application directly to
 the proper officials or agencies for and receive federal, state or local
 loans or grants in aid of any of the purposes of this part.
  8. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, general, special  or
 local, either state and any municipality and any commission or agency of
 either  or both of said two states is authorized and empowered to co-op-
 erate with the port authority and to enter into an agreement  or  agree-
 ments  (and  from  time  to  time  to  enter into agreements amending or
 supplementing the same) with the port authority for  and  in  connection
 with  or  relating  to the acquisition, clearance, replanning, rehabili-
 tation, reconstruction, or redevelopment of the Hudson tubes-world trade
 center area or of any other area forming part of  the  port  development
 project for the purpose of renewal and improvement of said area as afor-
 esaid  and  for  any  of the purposes of this part, upon such reasonable
 terms and conditions as may be determined by such  state,  municipality,
 agency or commission and the port authority. Such agreement may, without
 limiting  the generality of the foregoing, include consent to the use by
 the port authority of any real property owned or to be acquired by  said
 A. 9644  100
 
 state, municipality, agency or commission and consent to the use by such
 state,  municipality, agency or commission of any real property owned or
 to be acquired by the port authority which in either case is  necessary,
 convenient  or desirable in the opinion of the port authority for any of
 the purposes of this part, including such  real  property,  improved  or
 unimproved,  as  has  already  been  devoted  to or has been or is to be
 acquired for urban renewal or other public use, and as  an  incident  to
 such  consents such state, municipality, agency or commission may grant,
 convey, lease or otherwise transfer any such real property to  the  port
 authority  and  the port authority may grant, convey, lease or otherwise
 transfer any such real property to such state, municipality,  agency  or
 commission for such term and upon such conditions as may be agreed upon.
 If  real  property  of such state, municipality, agency or commission be
 leased to the port authority for any of the purposes of this part,  such
 state,  municipality,  agency  or  commission  may  consent  to the port
 authority having the right to mortgage the fee of such property and thus
 enable the port authority to give as security for its bond  or  bonds  a
 lien upon the land and improvements, but such state, municipality, agen-
 cy or commission by consenting to the execution by the port authority of
 a  mortgage  upon  the leased property shall not thereby assume and such
 consent shall not be construed as  imposing  upon  such  state,  munici-
 pality,  agency  or  commission  any  liability  upon  the bond or bonds
 secured by the mortgage.
  Nothing contained in this subdivision shall  impair  or  diminish  the
 powers  vested in either state or in any municipality, agency or commis-
 sion to acquire, clear, replan, reconstruct, rehabilitate  or  redevelop
 substandard  or  insanitary or deteriorating areas and the powers herein
 granted to the  state,  municipality,  agency  or  commission  shall  be
 construed  to be in aid of and not in limitation or in derogation of any
 such powers, heretofore or hereafter conferred upon or  granted  to  the
 state, municipality, agency or commission.
  Nothing  contained  in  this  part shall be construed to authorize the
 port authority to acquire property now or hereafter vested in or held by
 any municipality without the authority or consent of such  municipality,
 provided  that  the  state  in which said municipality is located may by
 statute enact that such property may be taken by the port  authority  by
 condemnation or the exercise of the right of eminent domain without such
 authority  or consent; nor shall anything herein impair or invalidate in
 any way any bonded indebtedness of the state or such  municipality,  nor
 impair  the  provisions of law regulating the payment into sinking funds
 of revenues derived from municipal property, or dedicating the  revenues
 derived from municipal property to a specific purpose.
  The  port authority is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire from
 any such municipality, or from any other  agency  or  commission  having
 jurisdiction  in  the premises, by agreement therewith, and such munici-
 pality, agency or commission, notwithstanding any contrary provision  of
 law,  is  hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to  grant and convey, upon
 reasonable terms and conditions, any real property which may  be  neces-
 sary,  convenient  or  desirable  for  any of the purposes of this part,
 including such real property as has already been  devoted  to  a  public
 use.
  Any consent by a municipality shall be given and the terms, conditions
 and  execution  by a municipality of any agreement, deed, lease, convey-
 ance or other instrument pursuant  to  this  subdivision  or  any  other
 provision  of  this  part  shall be authorized in the manner provided in
 article twenty-two of the compact  of  April  thirty,  nineteen  hundred
 A. 9644  101
 
 twenty-one  between  the  two  states  creating  the port authority. Any
 consent by either state shall be effective if given, and the  terms  and
 conditions  and  execution  of any agreement, deed, lease, conveyance or
 other  instruments pursuant to this subdivision or an other provision of
 this part shall be effective if authorized,  by  the  governor  of  such
 state.
  9.  The  states  of  New  York and New Jersey hereby consent to suits,
 actions or proceedings by any municipality against  the  port  authority
 upon,  in connection with or arising out of any agreement, or any amend-
 ment thereof, entered into for any of the  purposes  of  this  part,  as
 follows:
  (a) for judgments, orders or decrees restraining or enjoining the port
 authority  from  transferring title to real property to other persons in
 cases where it has agreed with said municipality for  transfer  of  such
 title to the municipality;  and
  (b) for judgments, orders or decrees restraining or enjoining the port
 authority from committing or continuing to commit other breaches of such
 agreement or any amendment thereof;  provided, that such judgment, order
 or  decree  shall  not  be  entered  except upon two days' prior written
 notice to the port  authority  of  the  proposed  entry  thereof;  and
 provided  further that upon appeal taken by the port authority from such
 judgment, order or decree the service of  the  notice  of  appeal  shall
 perfect  the  appeal  and  stay the execution of such judgment, order or
 decree appealed from without an undertaking or other security.
  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to revoke, rescind or  affect
 any consent to suits, actions, or proceedings against the port authority
 heretofore  given by the two said states in chapter three hundred one of
 the laws of New York of nineteen hundred fifty  and  continued  by  part
 XXIV  of  this  article, and chapter two hundred four of the laws of New
 Jersey of nineteen hundred fifty-one.
  10. The effectuation of the world trade center, the Hudson  tubes  and
 the  Hudson  tubes  extensions, or any of such facilities constituting a
 portion of the port development project, are and will be in all respects
 for the benefit of the people of the states of New York and New  Jersey,
 for  the  increase of their commerce and prosperity and for the improve-
 ment of their health and living conditions; and the port  authority  and
 any  subsidiary corporation incorporated for any of the purposes of this
 part shall be regarded as performing an essential governmental  function
 in  undertaking  the  effectuation  thereof,  and  in  carrying  out the
 provisions of law relating thereto.
  11. The port authority shall be required to pay no  taxes  or  assess-
 ments  upon  any  of  the property acquired or used by it for any of the
 purposes of this part or upon any deed,  mortgage  or  other  instrument
 affecting  such  property  or upon the recording of any such instrument.
 However, to the end that no municipality  shall  suffer  undue  loss  of
 taxes  and  assessments  by  reason  of the acquisition and ownership of
 property by the port authority for any of the purposes of this part, the
 port authority is hereby authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to
 enter into a voluntary agreement or  agreements  with  any  municipality
 whereby the port authority will undertake to pay in lieu of taxes a fair
 and reasonable sum or sums annually in connection with any real property
 acquired and owned by the port authority for any of the purposes of this
 part.  Such sums in connection with any real property acquired and owned
 by  the port authority for any of the purposes of this part shall not be
 more than the sum last paid as taxes upon such real  property  prior  to
 the  time  of its acquisition by the port authority;  provided, however,
 A. 9644  102
 
 that in connection with any portion  of  the  Hudson  tubes-world  trade
 center  area  acquired  and  owned  by the port authority for any of the
 purposes of this part, after such property is improved pursuant to  this
 part  with  world  trade  center  buildings,  structures or improvements
 greater in value than the buildings, structures or improvements on  such
 Hudson  tubes-world  trade center area at the time of its acquisition by
 the port authority, then, with regard to such greater value, such sum or
 sums may be increased by such additional sum or sums annually as may  be
 agreed  upon  between  the port authority and the city of New York which
 will not include any consideration of the exhibit  areas  of  the  world
 trade  center  or  of  any  areas which would be tax exempt in their own
 right if title were in the governmental  occupants  or  of  other  areas
 accommodating  services for the public or devoted to general public use.
 Each such municipality is hereby authorized and empowered to enter  into
 such  agreement  or agreements with the port authority and to accept the
 payment or payments which the port authority is  hereby  authorized  and
 empowered  to  make, and the sums so received by such municipality shall
 be devoted to purposes to which taxes may be applied  unless  and  until
 otherwise  directed  by  law  of the state in which such municipality is
 located.
  12. All details of the effectuation,  including  but  not  limited  to
 details  of  financing,  leasing,  rentals, tolls, fares, fees and other
 charges, rates, contracts and service, of the world  trade  center,  the
 Hudson tubes and the Hudson tubes extensions by the port authority shall
 be  within  its  sole discretion and its decision in connection with any
 and all matters concerning the world trade center, the Hudson tubes  and
 the  Hudson  tubes  extensions  shall be controlling and conclusive. The
 local laws, resolutions, ordinances, rules and regulations of  the  city
 of New York shall apply to such world trade center if so provided in any
 agreement  between  the  port  authority  and the city and to the extent
 provided in any such agreement.
  So long as any facility constituting a portion of the port development
 project shall be owned, controlled or operated  by  the  port  authority
 (either  directly  or  through a subsidiary corporation incorporated for
 any of the purposes of this part), no agency, commission or municipality
 of either or both of the two states shall have  jurisdiction  over  such
 facility  nor shall any such agency, commission or municipality have any
 jurisdiction over the terms or method of  effectuation  of  all  or  any
 portion  thereof  by the port authority (or such subsidiary corporation)
 including but not limited to the transfer of all or any portion  thereof
 to or by the port authority (or such subsidiary corporation).
  Nothing  in  this  part  shall be deemed to prevent the port authority
 from establishing, acquiring, owning, leasing, constructing,  effectuat-
 ing, developing, maintaining, operating, rehabilitating or improving all
 or  any  portion  of  the  port development project through wholly owned
 subsidiary corporations of the port authority or from transferring to or
 from any such corporations any moneys, real property or  other  property
 for any of the purposes of this part. If the port authority shall deter-
 mine from time to time to form such a subsidiary corporation it shall do
 so  by  executing and filing with the secretary of state of New York and
 the secretary of state of New Jersey  a  certificate  of  incorporation,
 which  may  be  amended from time to time by similar filing, which shall
 set forth the name of such subsidiary  corporation,  its  duration,  the
 location  of its principal office, and the purposes of the incorporation
 which shall be one or more of the purposes of  establishing,  acquiring,
 owning,  leasing,  constructing,  effectuating, developing, maintaining,
 A. 9644  103
 
 operating, rehabilitating or improving all or any portion  of  the  port
 development  project. The directors of such subsidiary corporation shall
 be the same persons holding the offices of  commissioners  of  the  port
 authority.  Such subsidiary corporation shall have all the powers vested
 in the port authority itself for the purposes of this part  except  that
 it  shall  not  have the power to contract indebtedness. Such subsidiary
 corporation and any of its property, functions and activities shall have
 all of the privileges, immunities, tax exemptions and  other  exemptions
 of  the  port  authority and of the port authority's property, functions
 and activities. Such subsidiary corporation  shall  be  subject  to  the
 restrictions and limitations to which the port authority may be subject,
 including,  but  not  limited to the requirement that no action taken at
 any meeting of the board of directors  of  such  subsidiary  corporation
 shall  have  force or effect until the governors of the two states shall
 have an opportunity, in the same manner and within the same time as  now
 or  hereafter  provided  by law for approval or veto of actions taken at
 any meeting of the port  authority  itself,  to  approve  or  veto  such
 action.  Such subsidiary corporation shall be subject to suit in accord-
 ance with subdivision nine of this section and chapter three hundred one
 of the laws of New York of nineteen hundred fifty as continued  by  part
 XXIV  of  this  article, and chapter two hundred four of the laws of New
 Jersey of nineteen hundred fifty-one as if such  subsidiary  corporation
 were  the  port authority itself.  Such subsidiary corporation shall not
 be a participating employer under the New  York  retirement  and  social
 security law or any similar law of either state and the employees of any
 such  subsidiary corporation, except those who are also employees of the
 port authority, shall not be deemed employees of the port authority.
  Whenever any state, municipality, commission, agency, officer, depart-
 ment, board or division is authorized  and  empowered  for  any  of  the
 purposes  of  this part to co-operate and enter into agreements with the
 port authority or to grant any consent  to  the  port  authority  or  to
 grant,  convey,  lease  or  otherwise  transfer any property to the port
 authority or to execute any document, such state, municipality,  commis-
 sion, agency, officer, department, board or division shall have the same
 authorization and power for any of such purposes to co-operate and enter
 into  agreements  with such subsidiary corporation and to grant consents
 to such subsidiary corporation and to grant, convey, lease or  otherwise
 transfer  property  to  such subsidiary corporation and to execute docu-
 ments for such subsidiary corporation.
  13. The bonds issued by the port authority to provide funds for any of
 the purposes of this part are hereby made securities in which all  state
 and  municipal  officers  and bodies of both states, all trust companies
 and banks other than savings banks, all building and loan  associations,
 savings  and  loan  associations, investment companies and other persons
 carrying on a commercial  banking  business,  all  insurance  companies,
 insurance  associations and other persons carrying on an insurance busi-
 ness, and all administrators, executors, guardians, trustees  and  other
 fiduciaries,  and  all  other  persons  whatsoever  (other  than savings
 banks), who are now or may hereafter be authorized by  either  state  to
 invest  in  bonds  of  such  state,  may properly and legally invest any
 funds, including capital, belonging to them or within their control, and
 said bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally  be
 deposited  with  and shall be received by any state or municipal officer
 or agency of either state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds
 of such state is now or may hereafter be authorized. The bonds issued by
 the port authority to provide funds for any of the purposes of this part
 A. 9644  104
 
 as security for which the general reserve fund shall have  been  pledged
 in  whole  or  in  part  are hereby made securities in which all savings
 banks also may properly and legally invest any funds, including capital,
 belonging to them or within their control.
  14.  If  the  port  authority shall find it necessary, convenient or
 desirable to acquire (either directly or  through  a  subsidiary  corpo-
 ration)  from  time to time any real property or any property other than
 real property (including but not limited to contract  rights  and  other
 intangible  personal  property and railroad cars or other rolling stock,
 maintenance and repair equipment and  parts,  fuel  and  other  tangible
 personal  property),  for  any of the purposes of this part, whether for
 immediate or future use  (including  temporary  construction,  rehabili-
 tation  or  improvement), the port authority may find and determine that
 such property, whether a fee simple absolute or a  lesser  interest,  is
 required for a public use, and upon such determination the said property
 shall  be  and  shall be deemed to be required for such public use until
 otherwise determined by the port authority, and such determination shall
 not be affected by the fact that  such  property  has  theretofore  been
 taken for and is then devoted to a public use; but the public use in the
 hands  of  or  under  the  control of the port authority shall be deemed
 superior to the public use in the hands of any other person, association
 or corporation.
  The port authority may acquire and is hereby authorized so to  acquire
 from  time to time, for any of the purposes of this part, such property,
 whether a fee simple absolute or a lesser estate, (including  the  exer-
 cise  of  the  right  of  eminent  domain)  under  and  pursuant  to the
 provisions of the eminent domain procedure law of the state of New  York
 in  the  case  of property located in or having its situs in such state,
 and revised statutes of New Jersey, title twenty: one-one  et  seq.,  in
 the  case  of property located in or having its situs in such state, or,
 at the option of the port authority, as provided in section  fifteen  of
 chapter  forty-three  of  the  laws  of  New  Jersey of nineteen hundred
 forty-seven, as amended, in the case of property located  in  or  having
 its  situs in such state, or pursuant to such other and alternate proce-
 dure as may be provided by law of the state in which  such  property  is
 located  or  has its situs; and all of said statutes for the acquisition
 of real property shall, for any of the purposes of this part, be applied
 also to the acquisition of other property authorized  by  this  subdivi-
 sion, except that such provisions as pertain to surveys, diagrams, maps,
 plans  or  profiles,  assessed valuation, lis pendens, service of notice
 and papers, filing in the office of the clerk in which the real property
 affected is situated and such other provisions as by their nature cannot
 be applicable to property other than real property, shall not be  appli-
 cable  to  the acquisition of such other property. In the event that any
 property other than real property is acquired by acquisition then,  with
 respect to such other property, notice of such proceeding and all subse-
 quent notices or court processes shall be served upon the owners of such
 other  property  and  upon  the port authority by personal service or by
 registered or certified mail, except as may be otherwise directed by the
 court.
  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any  property  to  be
 acquired  for any of the purposes of this part, which property shall not
 have been used by its owner or owners or any of his or  their  predeces-
 sors in connection with and shall not have been acquired by its owner or
 owners  or  any  of his or their predecessors for use in connection with
 the effectuation by a railroad company or companies of the Hudson  tubes
 A. 9644  105
 
 or  the  Hudson  tubes  extensions  prior to port authority acquisition,
 shall, if such property is personal property, be acquired only by agree-
 ment with the owner or  owners  and  shall,  if  such  property  is  not
 personal  property,  be acquired in an action or proceeding in the state
 in which such property is  located  or  has  its  situs.  Except  as  so
 provided,  the port authority is hereby authorized and empowered, in its
 discretion, from time to time to combine any property  which  is  to  be
 acquired  as aforesaid for any of the purposes of this part for acquisi-
 tion in a single action or proceeding notwithstanding that part  of  the
 the property so to be acquired is located or has its situs in New Jersey
 and  part in New York or is personal property or mixed real and personal
 property or may be owned by more than one owner; and, except as  herein-
 after provided, each such single action or proceeding to acquire proper-
 ty  located  or  having it situs part in New Jersey and part in New York
 shall be pursuant to the laws of whichever of the two  said  states  the
 port  authority shall estimate contains the greater part in value of all
 the property to be acquired in such action  or  proceeding  (hereinafter
 sometimes  called  the forum state) and in the court or courts specified
 in the laws of the forum state for the acquisition by the port authority
 of property located or having its situs in the forum state  pursuant  to
 this part, in which event, notwithstanding the location or situs of said
 property,  each  of said two states hereby confers upon it said court or
 courts jurisdiction of such action or proceeding and the port  authority
 and any subsidiary corporation so acquiring such property and the owners
 of  such  property  shall  be  bound by the judgments, orders or decrees
 therein. In any such action or proceeding the court  or  courts  of  the
 forum  state shall apply the laws of valuation of the other state (here-
 inafter sometimes called the nonforum state) to  the  valuation  of  the
 property  which  is  located  or  has it situs in the nonforum state and
 shall include in the total compensation to be made to any owner of prop-
 erty in both states being acquired in  such  action  or  proceeding  the
 increment,  if  any,  in  the  value of such property in both states, by
 reason of its being in a single  ownership.  If  a  judgment,  order  or
 decree  in such an action or proceeding shall best title in or otherwise
 award to the authority the right to possession of  property  located  or
 having  its situs in the nonforum state, then the court or courts of the
 nonforum state shall grant full faith and credit to such judgment, order
 or decree and upon petition by the authority to the court or  courts  of
 the non forum state specified in the laws thereof for the acquisition by
 the port authority of property located or having its situs in the nonfo-
 rum state pursuant to this act, presenting a true copy of such judgment,
 order  or  decree  and  proof  that it is in effect, that any conditions
 thereof have been met, that at least five days' notice of such  petition
 has  been  served by registered or certified mail upon all owners of the
 property affected who appeared in the original action or  proceeding  in
 the  forum  state  or  who  may be owners of record, and without further
 proof, a judgment, order or decree of such court or courts of the nonfo-
 rum state shall be entered granting  the  authority  possession  of  the
 property  located or having its situs in the nonforum state and confirm-
 ing any title which shall have vested in the authority or its subsidiary
 by the judgment, order or decree of the court or  courts  of  the  forum
 state.
  The  owner  of  any  property acquired for any of the purposes of this
 part shall not be awarded for such property any increment above the just
 compensation required by the constitutions of the United States  and  of
 A. 9644  106
 
 the state or states in which the property is located or has its situs by
 reason of any circumstances whatsoever.
  Nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  construed  to  prevent the port
 authority from bringing any proceedings to remove a cloud  on  title  or
 such  other  proceedings  as  it may, in its discretion, deem proper and
 necessary, or  from  acquiring  any  such  property  by  negotiation  or
 purchase.
  Where  a person entitled to an award in the proceedings to acquire any
 property for any of the purposes of this part remains in  possession  of
 such property after the time of the vesting of title in the authority or
 its  subsidiary,  the  reasonable value of his use and occupancy of such
 property subsequent to such time, as fixed by agreement or by the  court
 in  such proceedings or by any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be
 a lien against such award, subject only to liens of record at  the  time
 of the vesting of title in the authority or its subsidiary.
  15. The port authority and its duly authorized agents, and all persons
 acting  under  its  authority  and  by  its  direction, may enter in the
 daytime into and upon any real property for the purpose of  making  such
 surveys, diagrams, maps, plans, soundings or borings as the port author-
 ity  may deem necessary, convenient or desirable for any of the purposes
 of this act.
  16. Any declarations contained herein with respect to the governmental
 nature and public purpose of the world trade center,  Hudson  tubes  and
 Hudson  tubes extensions and to the exemption of the world trade center,
 Hudson tubes and Hudson tubes extensions property and instruments relat-
 ing thereto from taxation and to the discretion of  the  port  authority
 with  respect  to  said  facilities shall not be construed to imply that
 other port authority facilities, property and operations are  not  of  a
 governmental  nature  or  do not serve public purposes, or that they are
 subject to taxation, or that the determinations of  the  port  authority
 with  respect  thereto  are not conclusive.  The powers hereby vested in
 the port authority and in any subsidiary  corporation  incorporated  for
 any of the purposes of this part (including but not limited to the power
 to acquire real property by condemnation) shall be continuing powers and
 no  exercise  thereof  by the port authority or a subsidiary corporation
 incorporated for any of the purposes of this part  shall  be  deemed  to
 exhaust them or any of them.
  17.  This subdivision and the preceding subdivisions hereof constitute
 an agreement between the states of New York and New Jersey supplementary
 to the compact between the  two  states  dated  April  thirty,  nineteen
 hundred  twenty-one  and  amendatory  thereof,  and  shall  be liberally
 construed to effectuate the purposes of said compact and of the  compre-
 hensive plan heretofore adopted by the two states, and the powers grant-
 ed  to  the port authority shall be construed to be in aid of and not in
 limitation or in derogation of any  other  powers  heretofore  conferred
 upon or granted to the port authority.
  18.  If any subdivision, section, phrase, or provision of this part or
 the application thereof to  any  person  or  circumstances  be  adjudged
 invalid  by  any court of competent jurisdiction, so long as the part or
 remainder of the part shall nonetheless permit the  effectuation,  as  a
 unified  project,  of  the Hudson tubes, Hudson tubes extensions and the
 world trade center, such judgment shall be confined in its operation  to
 the  subdivision,  part,  phrase,  provision  or  application  directly
 involved in the controversy in  which  such  judgment  shall  have  been
 rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of
 this  part  or the application thereof to other persons or circumstances
 A. 9644  107
 
 and the two states hereby declare that they would have entered into this
 part or the remainder thereof had the invalidity of  such  provision  or
 application thereof been apparent.
 
  PART XXIV
  SUITS AGAINST THE PORT AUTHORITY
 
 Section 2401. Suits against the port authority.
  2402. Agreement between the states.
  §  2401. Suits against the port authority. 1.  Upon the concurrence of
 the state of New Jersey in accordance with chapter three hundred one  of
 the  laws  of  nineteen  hundred  fifty,  the states of New York and New
 Jersey consent to suits, actions or proceedings of any form or nature at
 law, in equity or otherwise  (including  proceedings  to  enforce  arbi-
 tration agreements) against the port authority, and to appeals therefrom
 and  reviews thereof, except as hereinafter provided in subdivisions two
 through five of this section.
  2.  The foregoing consent  does  not  extend  to  suits,  actions  or
 proceedings  upon  any  causes  of action whatsoever accruing before the

 connection  with, or arising out of notes, bonds or other obligations or
 securities secured by a pledge of the general reserve fund of  the  port
 authority.
  3.  The  foregoing  consent  does  not  extend  to suits, actions or
 proceedings upon any causes of action whatsoever,  upon,  in  connection
 with,  or  arising out of any contract, express or implied, entered into
 or assumed by or assigned to the port  authority  before  the  effective
 date  of this part (including any supplement to, or amendment, extension
 or renewal of any such contract, even  if  such  supplement,  amendment,
 extension  or  renewal  is  made  on or after the effective date of this
 part), regardless of whether such cause  of  action  accrued  before  or
 after that date, other than causes of action upon, in connection with or
 arising  out  of notes, bonds or other obligations or securities secured
 by a pledge of the general reserve fund of the port authority.
  4.  The foregoing consent does not extend to civil suits,  actions  or
 proceedings for the recovery of statutory penalties.
  5.  The  foregoing  consent  does  not  extend  to suits, actions or
 proceedings for judgments, orders or decrees restraining,  enjoining  or
 preventing  the  port  authority from committing or continuing to commit
 any act or acts, other than suits, actions or proceedings by the  attor-
 ney  general  of New York or by the attorney general of New Jersey--each
 of whom is hereby authorized to bring such suits, actions or proceedings
 in his discretion on behalf of any  person  or  persons  whatsoever  who
 requests  him so to do except in the cases excluded by subdivisions two,
 three and four of this section; provided, that in any such suit,  action
 or proceeding, no judgment, order or decree shall be entered except upon
 at  least  two  days'  prior written notice to the port authority of the
 proposed entry thereof.
  6.  The foregoing consent is granted upon the condition that venue  in
 any  suit, action or proceeding against the port authority shall be laid
 within a county or a judicial  district,  established  by  one  of  said
 states  or by the United States, and situated wholly or partially within
 the port of New York district. The port authority shall be deemed to  be
 a  resident  of each such county or judicial district for the purpose of
 such suits, actions or  proceedings.  Although  the  port  authority  is
 engaged  in  the  performance  of  governmental  functions, the said two
 A. 9644  108
 
 states consent to liability on the part of the port  authority  in  such
 suits,  actions or proceedings for tortious acts committed by it and its
 agents to the same extent as though it were a private corporation.
  7.  The foregoing consent is granted upon the condition that any suit,
 action  or  proceeding prosecuted or maintained under this part shall be
 commenced within one year after the cause of action therefor shall  have
 accrued,  and  upon  the further condition that in the case of any suit,
 action or proceeding for the recovery or payment of money, prosecuted or
 maintained under this part, a notice of claim  shall  have  been  served
 upon  the  port authority by or on behalf of the plaintiff or plaintiffs
 at least sixty days before such suit, action or proceeding is commenced.
 The provisions of this section shall not apply to claims arising out  of
 provisions of any workers' compensation law of either state.
  8.  The notice of claim required by subdivision seven of this section
 shall be in writing, sworn to by or on behalf of the claimant or  claim-
 ants,  and  shall set forth (1) the name and post office address of each
 claimant and of his attorney, if any, (2) the nature of the  claim,  (3)
 the  time when, the place where and the manner in which the claim arose,
 and (4) the items of damage or injuries claimed to have  been  sustained
 so  far  as then practicable. Such notice may be served in the manner in
 which process may be served, or in lieu thereof, may be sent  by  regis-
 tered  mail  to  the  port  authority at its principal office. Where the
 claimant is a person under the age of eighteen years or is  mentally  or
 physically  incapacitated  and by reason of such disability no notice of
 claim is filed or suit, action or proceeding commenced within  the  time
 specified  in subdivision seven of this section, or where a person enti-
 tled to make a claim dies and by reason of his death no notice of  claim
 is  filed or suit, action or proceeding commenced within the time speci-
 fied in subdivision seven of this section then any court in  which  such
 suit,  action  or  proceeding may be brought may in its discretion grant
 leave to serve the notice of claim and to commence the suit,  action  or
 proceeding  within a reasonable time but in any event within three years
 after the cause of action accrued. Application for such  leave  must  be
 made  upon  an  affidavit  showing the particular facts which caused the
 delay and shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposed notice of claim
 if such notice has not been served, and such application shall  be  made
 only upon notice to the port authority.
  9.  The  commissioners,  officers or employees of the port authority
 shall not be subject to suits, actions  or  proceedings  for  judgments,
 orders  or  decrees  restraining,  preventing or enjoining them in their
 official or personal capacities from committing or continuing to  commit
 any  act  or  acts  on  behalf  of  the port authority other than suits,
 actions and proceedings brought by the attorney general of New  York  or
 by  the attorney general of New Jersey or by the port authority itself--
 each of said attorneys general being hereby  authorized  to  bring  such
 suits,  actions or proceedings in his discretion on behalf of any person
 or persons whatsoever who requests him so to  do  except  in  the  cases
 excluded  by subdivisions two, three and four of this section; provided,
 that in any such suit, action or proceeding brought by  either  attorney
 general,  no  judgment,  order or decree shall be entered except upon at
 least two days' notice to the defendant of the proposed entry thereof.
  10.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to  revoke,  rescind  or
 affect  any  consents  to suits, actions or proceedings against the port
 authority heretofore given by the  two  said  states  in  chapter  eight
 hundred  two of the laws of New York of nineteen hundred forty-seven, as
 amended and continued by part XII of this article,  and  chapter  forty-
 A. 9644  109
 
 three  of  the  laws  of  New Jersey of nineteen hundred forty-seven, as
 amended; chapter six hundred thirty-one of the laws of New York of nine-
 teen hundred forty-seven, as amended and continued by part  XI  of  this
 article;  chapter  forty-four  of  the  laws  of  New Jersey of nineteen
 hundred forty-seven, as amended, and chapter five hundred thirty-four of
 the laws of New York of nineteen hundred forty-eight  and  continued  by
 part  XI  of  this  article  and chapter ninety-seven of the laws of New
 Jersey of nineteen hundred forty-eight.
  § 2402. Agreement between the states.  This part together with the act
 of the state of New Jersey concurring herein, shall constitute an agree-
 ment between the states of New York and New Jersey supplementary to  and

  PART XXVI
  MASS TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO AIR TERMINALS
 
 Section 2601. Mass transportation facilities to air terminals.
  § 2601. Mass transportation facilities  to  air  terminals.  1.  The
 states of New York and New Jersey hereby find and determine that:
  (a)  Each air terminal within the port of New York district serves the
 entire district, and the problem of furnishing proper and  adequate  air
 terminal  facilities  within  the  district is a regional and interstate
 problem;
  (b) Access by land travel to the great airports serving  the  port  of
 New York district, particularly John F. Kennedy and Newark international
 airports,  is becoming increasingly difficult, and such access is neces-
 sary for the continued development of such airports which development is
 vital and essential to the preservation of the  economic  well-being  of
 the northern New Jersey-New York metropolitan area;
  (c)  Additional  highway construction to serve these great airports is
 not feasible and creates severe  problems  in  terms  of  increased  air
 pollution and the preemption of land which might otherwise be devoted to
 park purposes and other desirable uses;
  (d)  Access  to  these  airports  by  railroads or other forms of mass
 transportation must be undertaken if they are to maintain their  preemi-
 nence  and continue to serve the economic well-being of the northern New
 Jersey-New York metropolitan area;
  (e) Such mass transportation facilities may properly  be  regarded  as
 constituting  a  part  of  each  air  terminal, the development of which
 A. 9644  111
 
 should be the responsibility of those charged with  the  duties  of  air
 terminal development;
  (f)  It  is  the purpose of this part to authorize and direct the port
 authority of New York and New Jersey  to  undertake  one  or  more  mass
 transportation  access  projects  specifically  with  respect to John F.
 Kennedy and Newark international  airports  in  order  to  preserve  and
 develop  the  economic  well-being  of  the northern New Jersey-New York
 metropolitan area, and such undertakings are found and determined to  be
 in the public interest.
  2.  In furtherance of the aforesaid findings and determinations and in
 partial effectuation of the comprehensive plan heretofore adopted by the
 two states for the development of terminal and transportation facilities
 in the port of New York district, the port authority of New York and New
 Jersey is hereby specifically authorized to undertake pursuant to  chap-
 ter forty-three of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred forty-sev-
 en, as amended, and chapter eight hundred two of the laws of New York of
 nineteen  hundred  forty-seven,  as amended and continued by part XII of
 this article, the following separate air terminal facilities:
  (a) To provide access to Newark international  airport.  A  railroad
 line  connecting Newark international airport, including (i) appropriate
 mass transportation terminal facilities at and within the said  airport;
 (ii)  construction,  reconstruction  and improvement of suitable offsite
 facilities for the  accommodation  of  air  passengers,  baggage,  mail,
 express,  freight and other users of the connecting facility;  and (iii)
 such additional rail or other mass  transportation,  terminal,  station,
 parking, storage and service facilities as operations may require.
  (b)  To  provide  access  to John F. Kennedy international airport.  A
 railroad line connecting John F. Kennedy international  airport  to  the
 main line of the Long Island railroad in the county of Queens, including
 (i)  a  spur  or  branch to the Montauk line of the said railroad in the
 said county;  (ii) appropriate mass transportation  terminal  facilities
 at  and  within the said airport;  (iii) suitable offsite facilities for
 the accommodation of air passengers, baggage, mail, express, freight and
 other users of the connecting facility; and (iv) such additional rail or
 other mass  transportation,  terminal,  station,  parking,  storage  and
 service facilities, including improvements to the railroad approaches to
 Pennsylvania  Station  and  Jamaica Terminal in the city of New York, as
 operations may require.
  3. The port authority of New York and New Jersey is hereby  authorized
 and  empowered to acquire real property located within the port district
 by condemnation or the right  of  eminent  domain  pursuant  to  and  in

  PART XXVII
  INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND FACILITIES
 
 Section 2701. Findings and determinations.
  2702. Definitions.
  2703. Industrial development projects and facilities.
  § 2701. Findings and determinations.  1. The states of  New  York  and
 New Jersey hereby find and determine:
  a.  that  to  prevent further deterioration of the economy of the port
 district and thereby to promote, preserve and protect trade and commerce
 in and through the port of New York district as defined in  the  compact
 between  the  two states dated April thirtieth, nineteen hundred twenty-
 one (hereinafter called the port district), it is the policy of each  of
 the  two  states  actively  to  promote,  attract, encourage and develop
 economically sound commerce and industry through governmental action;
  b. that in order to preserve and protect the position of the  port  of
 New  York  as  the  nation's  leading  gateway for world commerce, it is
 incumbent on the states of New York and New Jersey to make every  effort
 to  insure  that  the port receives its rightful share of interstate and
 international commerce generated by the manufacturing, industrial, trade
 and commercial segments of the economy of the nation  and  of  the  port
 district;
  c.  that  since nineteen hundred fifty the number of available jobs in
 the port district, particularly within the older central cities thereof,
 has decreased, thereby resulting in the  underutilization  of  available
 land  and  other resources, the erosion of the port district's tax bases
 and a rate of unemployment substantially in excess of the national aver-
 age;
  d. that in order to preserve the port district from  further  economic
 deterioration,  adequate  industrial development projects and facilities
 A. 9644  113
 
 must be provided, preserved and maintained to attract and retain  indus-
 try within the port district;
  e. that a number of new industrial development projects and facilities
 should be organized into industrial parks or districts;
  f.  that  the construction of such industrial parks or districts shall
 conform to the policies of the two states with  respect  to  affirmative
 action and equal employment opportunities;
  g.  that  providing  port district industrial development projects and
 facilities is in the public interest and involves the exercise of public
 and essential governmental functions which may include  appropriate  and
 reasonable limitations on competition and which must be performed by the
 two  states, or any municipality, public authority, agency or commission
 of either state and by a joint agency of the two  states  to  accomplish
 the purposes of this part;
  h.  that it is an objective of the two states, acting through the port
 authority, to facilitate reemployment of residents of the  older  cities
 through  job  training programs and employment opportunity priorities in
 connection with industrial development parks in their respective cities;
  i. that the acquisition and the use by such joint agency of abandoned,
 undeveloped or underutilized land or land owned by governmental entities
 within the port district for the generation of jobs and  to  reduce  the
 hazards  of  unemployment would promote, preserve and protect the indus-
 try, trade and commerce of the port district, and will materially assist
 in preserving for the two states and the people thereof the material and
 other benefits of a prosperous port community;
  j. that the collection, disposal  and  utilization  of  refuse,  solid
 waste  or  waste resulting from other treatment processes is an activity
 of concern to all citizens within the port district,  that  the  health,
 safety  and  general  welfare  of  the citizens within the port district
 require efficient and reasonable collection and  disposal  services  and
 efficient  utilization  of  such  refuse, solid waste or waste resulting
 from other treatment processes  with  adequate  consideration  given  to
 regional  planning  and  coordination,  and,  therefore,  that  the
 construction and operation of any port district  industrial  development
 project and facility should conform to the environmental and solid waste
 disposal  standards  and state and county plans therefor in the state in
 which such project or facility is located;
  k. that the dedication by the municipalities of the port  district  of
 refuse, solid waste or waste resulting from other treatment processes to
 resource  recovery  to  permit the generation of lower priced energy and
 the recovery of useful materials, together with the commitment  by  such
 municipalities  to  pay  fees  to  permit the delivery and removal after
 processing of such refuse or solid waste at rates  and  for  periods  of
 time  at  least  sufficient  to  assure the continued furnishing of such
 lower priced energy and material is in the public interest and would  be
 a  major  incentive  for the attraction and retention of industry within
 the port district;
  l. that the port authority of New York  and  New  Jersey  (hereinafter
 called  the  port  authority), which was created by agreement of the two
 states as a joint agent for the development of terminal,  transportation
 and  other  facilities  of  commerce  of  the  port district and for the
 promotion and protection of the commerce of the port, is a proper agency
 to act in their behalf (either directly  or  by  any  subsidiary  corpo-
 ration)  to  finance and effectuate such industrial development projects
 and facilities;
 A. 9644  114
 
  m. that it is desirable for the  port  authority,  after  consultation
 with  the governing body of each municipality and within the city of New
 York the appropriate community board or  boards  and  elsewhere  another
 government  entity  or entities designated by such municipality in which
 industrial development projects or facilities are proposed to be located
 and with other persons, including but not limited to private real estate
 developers,  to prepare and adopt a master plan providing for the devel-
 opment of such industrial development projects  and  facilities  in  the
 port  district,  which  plan  shall  give consideration to the extent of
 unemployment and the  general  economic  conditions  of  the  respective
 portions  of  the port district and shall include among other things the
 locations and the nature and scope of such projects  and  facilities  as
 may be included in the plan;
  n.  that  the  undertaking of such industrial development projects and
 facilities by the port authority has the single object of and is part of
 a unified plan to aid in preserving the economic well-being of the  port
 district and is found and determined to be in the public interest;
  o.  that  no  such  port  district industrial development projects and
 facilities are to be constructed if the sole intent of the  construction
 thereof  would be the removal of an industrial or manufacturing plant of
 an occupant of such projects and facilities from one location to another
 location or in the abandonment of one or more plants  or  facilities  of
 such occupant, unless such port district industrial development projects
 and facilities are reasonably necessary to discourage such occupant from
 removing  such plant or facility to a location outside the port district
 or are reasonably necessary to preserve the competitive position of such
 project occupant in its industry;
  p. that no such  port  district  industrial  development  projects  or
 facilities are to be constructed unless and until the port authority has
 entered  into  an agreement or agreements with the municipality in which
 any such project or facility is to be located with respect  to  payments
 in  lieu  of real estate taxes and the location, nature and scope of any
 project or facility;
  q. that, subject to entering into said agreement  or  agreements,  the
 port  authority should have the ability to acquire, lease, vacate, clear
 and otherwise develop abandoned, undeveloped or  underutilized  property
 or  property owned by governmental entities within the port district and
 to finance and construct industrial development projects and facilities.

 seven  hundred  one of this part, in partial effectuation of and supple-
 mental to the comprehensive plan heretofore  adopted  by  the  two  said
 states for the development of the said port district, and subject to the
 preparation  and  adoption  of the plan authorized in subdivision two of
 this section and the execution of an agreement or agreements  authorized
 A. 9644  117
 
 by subdivisions eleven and twelve of this section, the port authority is
 hereby  authorized,  empowered  and  directed  to  establish,  acquire,
 construct, effectuate, develop, own, lease, maintain, operate,  improve,
 rehabilitate,  sell, transfer and mortgage projects or facilities herein
 referred to as port district industrial development projects or  facili-
 ties, as defined in this part.
  The  port  authority  is hereby authorized and empowered to establish,
 levy and collect such rentals, fares, fees and other charges as  it  may
 deem  necessary,  proper or desirable in connection with any facility or
 part of any facility constituting a portion of any port district  indus-
 trial  development project or facility and to issue bonds for any of the
 purposes of this part and to provide for payment thereof, with  interest
 thereon,  and  for the amortization and retirement of such bonds, and to
 secure all or any portion of such bonds by a  pledge  of  such  rentals,
 fares,  fees,  charges and other revenues or any part thereon (including
 but not limited to the revenues of any subsidiary  corporation  incorpo-
 rated  for  any  of  the purposes of this part) and to secure all or any
 portion of such bonds by mortgages upon any property held or to be  held
 by  the port authority for any of the purposes of this part, and for any
 of the purposes of this part to exercise all appropriate powers  hereto-
 fore  or  hereafter  delegated  to  it by the states of New York and New
 Jersey, including, but not limited to, those expressly set forth in this
 part. The surplus  revenues  of  port  district  industrial  development
 projects or facilities may be pledged in whole or in part as hereinafter
 provided.
  2.  The  port  authority  is hereby authorized to initiate studies and
 prepare and adopt a master plan providing for the  development  of  port
 district  industrial  development  projects  and  facilities which shall
 include the location of such projects and facilities as may be  included
 in  the  plan  and shall to the maximum extent practicable include inter
 alia a general description of each of such projects and facilities,  the
 land  use  requirements  necessary  therefor,  and  estimates of project
 costs, of project employment potential and of a schedule  for  commence-
 ment of each such project.  Prior to adopting such master plan, the port
 authority  shall give written notice to, afford a reasonable opportunity
 for comment, consult with and consider any recommendation  made  by  the
 governing  body  of  municipalities  and within the city of New York the
 appropriate community board or boards and elsewhere another governmental
 entity or entities designated by such municipality in  which  industrial
 development  projects  or facilities are proposed to be located and with
 such other persons, including but not limited  to  private  real  estate
 developers,  which in the opinion of the port authority is either neces-
 sary or desirable.  The master plan shall include the  port  authority's
 estimate  of the revenues to be derived by municipalities from each such
 industrial development project or facility and also a description of the
 proposed additional arrangements with municipalities necessary or desir-
 able for each such project or facility.  The port authority  may  modify
 or  change any part of such plan in the same form and manner as provided
 for the adoption of such original plan.  At the time the port  authority
 authorizes  any  industrial  development  project  or facility, the port
 authority shall include with such authorization a statement  as  to  the
 status  of  each  project included in such master plan and any amendment
 thereof.
  3. No industrial development project proposed to be located within the
 city of New York may be included in such master plan  unless  and  until
 the mayor of the city of New York requests the port authority to conduct
 A. 9644  118
 
 a  comprehensive  study of the feasibility of the effectuation of one or
 more industrial development projects or  any  parts  thereof  (including
 resource  recovery  or  industrial pollution control facilities) in such
 city,  which  request shall specify the borough in which such comprehen-
 sive study is to take place; provided, however, that  the  president  of
 any  borough  in  which an industrial development project or facility is
 proposed to be located may within sixty days of  receipt  of  notice  of
 such  request, and after consulting with and considering any recommenda-
 tion made by the  local  borough  improvement  board,  notify  the  port
 authority  not to include any proposed industrial development project or
 facility within that county in such feasibility study.  Any such request
 by the mayor of the city of New York may specify the  facilities  to  be
 included in such industrial park project.
  4.  The  moneys in the general reserve fund may be pledged in whole or
 in part by the port authority as security for or applied by  it  to  the
 repayment  with  interest  of  any  moneys which it may raise upon bonds
 issued or incurred by it from time to time for any of  the  purposes  of
 this part or upon bonds secured in whole or in part by the pledge of the
 revenues  from  any  industrial  development  project or facility or any
 portion thereof or upon bonds both so issued or incurred and so secured;
 and the moneys in said general reserve fund may be applied by  the  port
 authority  to  the  fulfillment  of  any other undertakings which it may
 assume to or for the benefit of the holders of any such bonds.
  Subject to prior liens and pledges (and to the obligation of the  port
 authority  to  apply  revenues to the maintenance of its general reserve
 fund in the amount prescribed by the general reserve fund statutes), the
 revenues from facilities established, constructed, acquired or otherwise
 effectuated through the issuance or sale of bonds of the port  authority
 secured  in  whole or in part by a pledge of its general reserve fund or
 any portion thereof may be pledged in whole or in part as  security  for
 or  applied  by  it  to  any of the purposes of this part, including the
 repayment with interest of any moneys which  it  may  raise  upon  bonds
 issued  or  incurred  from  time to time for any of the purposes of this
 part or upon bonds secured in whole or in part  by  the  pledge  of  the
 revenues  of  the port authority from any industrial development project
 or facility or any portion thereof or  upon  bonds  both  so  issued  or
 incurred  and  so secured;  and said revenues may be applied by the port
 authority to the fulfillment of any  other  undertakings  which  it  may
 assume to or for the benefit of the holders of such bonds.
  5. In all cases where the port authority has raised or shall hereafter
 raise  moneys for any of the purposes of this part by the issue and sale
 of bonds which are secured in whole or in part by a pledge of the gener-
 al reserve fund or any portion thereof, the surplus revenues from indus-
 trial development projects or facilities financed in whole  or  in  part
 out  of  the  proceeds  of  such bonds and the surplus revenues from any
 other port authority facility the surplus revenues of which at such time
 may be payable into the general reserve fund shall be pooled and applied
 by the port authority to the establishment and maintenance of the gener-
 al reserve fund in an amount equal to one-tenth of the par value of  all
 bonds legal for investment, as defined in the general reserve fund stat-
 utes,  issued by the port authority and currently outstanding, including
 such bonds issued for any of the purposes of this part;  and  all  such
 moneys  in  said  general reserve fund may be pledged and applied in the
 manner provided in the general reserve fund statutes.
  In the event that any time the balance of moneys theretofore paid into
 the general reserve fund and  not  applied  therefrom  shall  exceed  an
 A. 9644  119
 
 amount equal to one-tenth of the par value of all bonds upon the princi-
 pal  amount  of  which  the amount of the general reserve fund is calcu-
 lated, by reason of the retirement of bonds issued or incurred from time
 to  time for any of the purposes of this part the par value of which had
 theretofore been included in the  computation  of  said  amount  of  the
 general  reserve  fund, then the port authority may pledge or apply such
 excess for and only for the purposes for which it is authorized  by  the
 general  reserve  fund  statutes  to  pledge  the  moneys in the general
 reserve fund and such pledge may be made in advance  of  the  time  when
 such excess may occur.
  6.  The  two  states  covenant  and agree with each other and with the
 holders of any bonds issued by the port authority for  the  purposes  of
 this  part,  that  so  long  as any of such bonds remain outstanding and
 unpaid and the holders thereof shall not have  given  their  consent  as
 provided  in their contract with the port authority, the two states will
 not diminish or impair the power of the  port  authority  to  establish,
 levy  and  collect  rentals,  fares, fees or other charges in connection
 with industrial development projects or facilities or any other facility
 owned or operated by the port authority the revenues of which have  been
 or  shall  be  pledged  in  whole  or in part as security for such bonds
 (directly or indirectly, or through the medium of  the  general  reserve
 fund  or otherwise), or to determine the quantity, quality, frequency or
 nature of any services provided by the port authority in connection with
 the operation of each project or facility.  This subdivision  shall  not
 affect or diminish the provisions of subdivision twelve of this section.
  7.  The  port authority is authorized and empowered to co-operate with
 the states of New York and New Jersey, with  any  municipality  thereof,
 with any person, with the federal government and with any agency, public
 authority or commission or any one or more of the foregoing, or with any
 one  or more of them, for and in connection with the acquisition, clear-
 ance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction or redevelopment of any
 industrial development project or facility or of any other area  forming
 part  of  any industrial development project or facility for the purpose
 of renewal and improvement of said area and for any of the  purposes  of
 this  part,  and to enter into an agreement or agreements (and from time
 to time to enter into agreements amending  or  supplementing  the  same)
 with  any  such  person,  municipality,  commission, public authority or
 agency and with the states of New York  and  New  Jersey  and  with  the
 federal  government, or with any one or more of them, for or relating to
 such purposes, including but not limited to agreements with  respect  to
 the  dedication  by  the  municipalities of the port district of refuse,
 solid waste  or  waste  resulting  from  other  treatment  processes  to
 resource  recovery  to  permit the generation of lower priced energy and
 the recovery of useful materials;  with respect to a commitment by  such
 municipalities  to  pay  fees  to  permit the delivery and removal after
 processing of such refuse or solid waste at rates  and  for  periods  of
 time  at  least  sufficient to assure the continued availability of such
 energy and recovered materials; with respect  to  financial  assistance,
 loans and grants pursuant to any federal law now in effect or hereinaft-
 er  enacted  which  would  provide  such financial assistance, loans and
 grants in connection with any of the purposes of  this  part,  provided,
 that  if  either state shall have or adopt general legislation governing
 applications for such federal aid by municipalities, public authorities,
 agencies or commissions of such state or the receipt or disbursement  of
 such federal aid by or on behalf of such municipalities, public authori-
 ties, agencies or commissions, then such legislation shall at the option
 A. 9644  120
 
 of  such  state  apply  to  applications  by the port authority for such
 federal aid in connection with  an  industrial  development  project  or
 facility  located  in  such state and to the receipt and disbursement of
 such  federal  aid  by  or  on behalf of the port authority, in the same
 manner and to the same extent as other municipalities,  public  authori-
 ties, agencies or commissions of such state;  and, with respect to occu-
 pancy  of  space in any industrial development project or facility.  The
 port authority is hereby authorized  and  empowered  to  apply  for  and
 accept  financial  assistance,  loans and grants for such purposes under
 federal, state or local laws, and to make application  directly  to  the
 proper  officials  or  agencies  for and receive federal, state or local
 loans or grants in aid of any of the  purposes  of  this  part.  Nothing
 contained  in  this part shall be construed to limit or impair the power
 of the governor of the state of New York and the governor of  the  state
 of  New  Jersey  to  review the actions of the commissioners of the port
 authority as provided for in chapter seven hundred of the  laws  of  New
 York  of  nineteen  hundred twenty-seven, as amended and as continued by
 part IV of this article, and in chapter three  hundred  thirty-three  of
 the  laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-seven, as amended, or
 to authorize the port authority to  commence  the  effectuation  of  any
 industrial  development project or facility unless and until the munici-
 pality in which such project or facility is to be located has  consented
 to  the  commencement  of  such  effectuation,  with  such consent to be
 provided for in the agreement authorized by subdivision eleven or subdi-
 vision twelve of this section. The  port  authority  is  authorized  and
 empowered  to  enter  into  an agreement or agreements (and from time to
 time to enter into agreements amending or supplementing the  same)  with
 any  public  authority, agency or commission of either or both states to
 provide for the effectuation of any of the purposes of this part through
 a subsidiary corporation owned jointly by the  port  authority  and  any
 such public authority, agency or commission, and any such public author-
 ity, agency or commission is authorized and empowered to enter into such
 agreement or agreements with the port authority.
  8.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, general, special or
 local, either state and any municipality  thereof  and  any  commission,
 public  authority  or  agency  of  either  or both of said two states is
 authorized and empowered to co-operate with the port  authority  and  to
 enter  into  an  agreement or agreements (and from time to time to enter
 into agreements amending  or  supplementing  the  same)  with  the  port
 authority  or with any other person for and in connection with or relat-
 ing to the acquisition, clearance,  replanning,  rehabilitation,  recon-
 struction,  redevelopment,  sale, transfer or mortgage of any industrial
 development project or facility or of any other area forming part of any
 industrial development project or facility for the  purpose  of  renewal
 and  improvement  of  said  area  as  aforesaid  or for any of the other
 purposes of this part, including but not limited to  the  dedication  by
 the  municipalities of the port district of refuse, solid waste or waste
 resulting from other treatment processes to resource recovery to  permit
 the generation of lower priced energy and the recovery of useful materi-
 als  and  a  commitment by such municipalities to pay fees to permit the
 delivery and removal after processing of such refuse or solid  waste  at
 rates  and for periods of time at least sufficient to assure the contin-
 ued availability of such  energy  and  recovered  materials,  upon  such
 reasonable  terms  and  conditions  as  may be determined by such state,
 municipality, public  authority,  agency  or  commission  and  the  port
 authority.  Such agreement may, without limiting the generality of the
 A. 9644  121
 
 foregoing, further include consent to the use by the port  authority  or
 any  other  person  of any real property owned or to be acquired by said
 state, municipality, public authority, agency or commission and  consent
 to  the  use  by  such  state, municipality, public authority, agency or
 commission of any real property owned or to  be  acquired  by  the  port
 authority  or  by  any  other  person which in either case is necessary,
 convenient or desirable in the opinion of the port authority for any  of
 the  purposes  of  this  part, including such real property, improved or
 unimproved, as has already been devoted to or  has  been  or  is  to  be
 acquired  for  urban  renewal or other public use, and as an incident to
 such consent such  state,  municipality,  public  authority,  agency  or
 commission  may grant, convey, lease or otherwise transfer any such real
 property to the port authority or to  any  other  person  and  the  port
 authority  may  grant, convey, lease or otherwise transfer any such real
 property to such state, municipality, public authority, agency,  commis-
 sion  or  any other person for such term and upon such conditions as may
 be agreed upon.  If real property of such  state,  municipality,  public
 authority,  agency  or  commission be leased to the port authority or to
 any other person for any of the purposes of this part, such state, muni-
 cipality, public authority, agency or commission may consent to the port
 authority or any other person having the right to mortgage  the  fee  of
 such property and thus enable the port authority or such other person to
 give as security for its bond or bonds a lien upon the land and improve-
 ments, but such state, municipality, public authority, agency or commis-
 sion  by consenting to the execution by the port authority or such other
 person of a mortgage upon the leased property shall not  thereby  assume
 and  such  consent  shall  not be construed as imposing upon such state,
 municipality, public authority, agency or commission any liability  upon
 the  bond  or  bonds secured by the mortgage.  In connection with any of
 the purposes of this part, either state and  any  municipality  thereof,
 any commission, public authority or agency of either or both of said two
 states,  the  port authority and any other person are empowered to enter
 into any other agreement or agreements (and from time to time  to  enter
 into  agreements amending or supplementing same) which may provide inter
 alia for the establishment of prices or rates, a  requirement  that  any
 person  sell,  lease or purchase any commodity or service from any other
 person, or any other similar arrangement.
  Nothing contained in this subdivision shall  impair  or  diminish  the
 powers  vested in either state or in any municipality, public authority,
 agency or commission to acquire, clear, replan,  reconstruct,  rehabili-
 tate  or  redevelop abandoned, undeveloped or underutilized land and the
 powers herein granted  to  either  state  or  any  municipality,  public
 authority,  agency  or commission shall be construed to be in aid of and
 not in limitation or in derogation of  any  such  powers  heretofore  or
 hereafter  conferred upon or granted to such state, municipality, public
 authority, agency or commission.
  Nothing contained in this part shall be  construed  to  authorize  the
 port  authority to acquire, by condemnation or the exercise of the right
 of eminent domain, property now or hereafter vested in or held by either
 state or by any municipality, public  authority,  agency  or  commission
 without  the  authority  or  consent by such state, municipality, public
 authority, agency or commission, provided that  the  state  under  whose
 laws  such  public  authority, agency or commission has been created may
 authorize by appropriate legislation the port authority to  acquire  any
 such  property vested in or held by any such public authority, agency or
 commission by condemnation or the  exercise  of  the  right  of  eminent
 A. 9644  122
 
 domain  without  such  authority or consent;  nor shall anything herein
 impair or invalidate in any way any bonded indebtedness of either  state
 or  any  such  municipality, public authority, agency or commission, nor
 impair  the  provisions of law regulating the payment into sinking funds
 of revenues derived from  such  property,  or  dedicating  the  revenues
 derived from such property to a specific purpose.
  The port authority, subject to the express authority or consent of any
 such  state,  municipality,  public  authority, agency or commission, is
 hereby authorized and empowered to acquire from any such state or  muni-
 cipality,  or  from  any  other  public  authority, agency or commission
 having jurisdiction in the premises, by agreement  therewith,  and  such
 state  or municipality, public authority, agency or commission, notwith-
 standing any  contrary  provision  of  law,  is  hereby  authorized  and
 empowered to grant and convey, upon reasonable terms and conditions, any
 real property which may be necessary, convenient or desirable for any of
 the  purposes  of this part, including such real property as has already
 been devoted to a public use.
  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section or part  or
 any  compact  or  general  or  special  law,  the port authority may not
 acquire any park lands for industrial development projects or facilities
 unless each such conveyance of such land is specifically  authorized  by
 the legislature of the state wherein the land is located.
  Any consent by a municipality shall be given and the terms, conditions
 and  execution  by a municipality of any agreement, deed, lease, convey-
 ance or other instrument pursuant  to  this  subdivision  or  any  other
 subdivision  of  this section shall be authorized in the manner provided
 in article twenty-two  of  the  compact  of  April  thirtieth,  nineteen
 hundred  twenty-one  between the two states creating the port authority,
 except that as to towns in the state of New York, such consent shall  be
 authorized  in the manner provided in the town law and as to counties in
 the state of New Jersey, such consent shall be authorized in the  manner
 provided  in  New Jersey statutes annotated, forty: one-one, et seq. Any
 consent by either state shall be effective if given, and the  terms  and
 conditions  and  execution  of any agreement, deed, lease, conveyance or
 other instrument pursuant to this section or any other section  of  this
 part  shall  be  effective  if authorized by the governor of such state.
 Any consent by a public authority, agency or commission shall be  effec-
 tive if given by such public authority, agency or commission.
  9.  The  states  of  New  York and New Jersey hereby consent to suits,
 actions or proceedings by any municipality, public authority, agency  or
 commission  against the port authority upon, in connection with or aris-
 ing out of any agreement, or any amendment thereof, entered into for any
 of the purposes of this part, as follows:
  a. for judgments, orders or decrees restraining or enjoining the  port
 authority  from  transferring title to real property to other persons in
 cases where it has agreed  with  said  municipality,  public  authority,
 agency,  or  commission  for transfer of such title to the municipality,
 public authority, agency or commission;  and
  b. for judgments, orders or decrees restraining or enjoining the  port
 authority from committing or continuing to commit other breaches of such
 agreement or any amendment thereof;  provided, that such judgment, order
 or  decree  shall  not  be  entered  except upon two days' prior written
 notice to the port  authority  of  the  proposed  entry  thereof;  and
 provided  further that upon appeal taken by the port authority from such
 judgment, order or decree the service of  the  notice  of  appeal  shall
 A. 9644  123
 
 perfect  the  appeal  and  stay the execution of such judgment, order or
 decree appealed from without an undertaking or other security.
  Nothing  herein contained shall be deemed to revoke, rescind or affect
 any consent to suits, actions, or proceedings against the port authority
 heretofore given by the two said states in chapter three hundred one  of
 the laws of New York of nineteen hundred fifty and continued by part XIV
 of  this article, and chapter two hundred four of the laws of New Jersey
 of nineteen hundred fifty-one.
  10. The effectuation of industrial development projects or  facilities
 of  any such projects or facilities constituting a portion of any indus-
 trial development project or facility, are and will be in  all  respects
 for  the benefit of the people of the states of New York and New Jersey,
 for the increase of their commerce and prosperity and for  the  improve-
 ment  of their health and living conditions;  and the port authority and
 any subsidiary corporation incorporated for any of the purposes of  this
 part  shall be regarded as performing an essential governmental function
 in undertaking  the  effectuation  thereof,  and  in  carrying  out  the
 provisions of law relating thereto.
  11.  The  port  authority shall be required to pay no taxes or assess-
 ments upon any of the property acquired and used by it for  any  of  the
 purposes  of  this  part  or upon any deed, mortgage or other instrument
 affecting such property or upon the recording of  any  such  instrument.
 However,  to the end that no taxing jurisdiction shall suffer undue loss
 of taxes and assessments by reason of the acquisition and  ownership  of
 property by the port authority for any of the purposes of this part, the
 port authority is hereby authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to
 enter  into  a  voluntary  agreement  or agreements with any city, town,
 township or village whereby the port authority will undertake to pay  in
 lieu  of  taxes  a  fair and reasonable sum, if any, or sums annually in
 connection with any real property acquired and owned by the port author-
 ity for any of the purposes of this part and to provide for the  payment
 as  a  rental  or  additional  rental charge by any person occupying any
 portion of any industrial development  project  or  facility  either  as
 lessee,  vendee  or otherwise of such reasonable sum, if any, or sums as
 hereinafter provided.  Such sums in connection with  any  real  property
 acquired and owned by the port authority for any of the purposes of this
 part  shall  not  be more than the sum last paid as taxes upon such real
 property prior to the time of its acquisition  by  the  port  authority;
 provided, however, that in connection with any portion of any industrial
 development project or facility, which is owned by the port authority or
 another  governmental  entity  and  improved  pursuant to this part with
 buildings, structures or improvements greater in value than  the  build-
 ings,  structures or improvements in existence at the time of its acqui-
 sition, development or improvement by the  port  authority,  any  person
 occupying such portion of such industrial development project or facili-
 ty either as lessee, vendee or otherwise shall, as long as title thereto
 shall  remain  in  the port authority or in another governmental entity,
 pay as a rental or additional rental charge an amount in lieu of  taxes,
 if  any, not in excess of the taxes on such improvements and on personal
 property, including water and  sewer  service  charges  or  assessments,
 which  such person would have been required to pay had it been the owner
 of such property during the period  for  which  such  payment  is  made;
 provided  further,  however,  that neither the port authority nor any of
 its projects, facilities, properties, monies or bonds and notes shall be
 obligated, liable or subject to lien of  any  kind  whatsoever  for  the
 enforcement, collection or payment thereof.  Each such city, town, town-
 A. 9644  124
 
 ship  or  village  is hereby authorized and empowered to enter into such
 agreement or agreements with  the  port  authority  which  agreement  or
 agreements  may also include provisions with respect to the joint review
 of  categories  of tenants proposed as occupants for industrial develop-
 ment projects  or  facilities  with  the  cities,  towns,  townships  or
 villages  in  which  they  are proposed to be located, and to accept the
 payment or payments which the port authority is  hereby  authorized  and
 empowered  to  make  or  which  are  paid by a person occupying any such
 portion of such industrial development project or facility as rental  or
 as  additional rental in lieu of taxes, and the sums so received by such
 city, town, township or village shall be devoted to  purposes  to  which
 taxes  may  be  applied  in all affected taxing jurisdictions unless and
 until otherwise directed by law of the state in which such  city,  town,
 township  or village is located. At least ten days prior to the authori-
 zation by the port authority of  any  agreement  provided  for  in  this
 subdivision, the port authority shall notify the chief executive officer
 of each city in the port district within which an industrial development
 project or facility has been included in the master plan provided for in
 subdivision  two  of  this section of the proposed authorization of such
 agreement, shall seek their comments and shall include with such author-
 ization any comments received from such city.  The port authority  shall
 not sell or lease substantially all of an industrial development project
 or facility to a proposed purchaser or lessee without the prior approval
 by  the  municipality wherein the project or facility is located of such
 purchaser or lessee.
  12. Except as otherwise specifically  provided,  all  details  of  the
 effectuation,  including  but not limited to details of financing, leas-
 ing, rentals, fees and other charges, rates, contracts and  service,  of
 industrial  development  projects  or  facilities  by the port authority
 shall be within its sole discretion and its decision in connection  with
 any and all matters concerning industrial development projects or facil-
 ities  shall  be  controlling  and  conclusive;  provided  that  the
 construction and operation of any such project or facility shall conform
 to the environmental and solid waste disposal standards  and  any  state
 and county plans therefor in the state in which such project or facility
 is located.  At least ninety days prior to the authorization by the port
 authority  of  the first contract for the construction of any industrial
 development project or facility, the port authority  shall  transmit  to
 the  governor  of  the  state in which such project or facility is to be
 located a statement as to the conformance of such industrial development
 project or facility with such environmental  and  solid  waste  disposal
 standards  and  any  state  and county plans therefor, and shall consult
 with such governor or his designee  with  respect  thereto.  The  port
 authority  and  the  city, town, township or village in which any indus-
 trial development project or facility is to be  located  and  for  whose
 benefit such project or facility is undertaken are hereby authorized and
 empowered  to  enter  into  an  agreement or agreements to provide which
 local laws, resolutions, ordinances, rules and regulations, if  any,  of
 such  city,  town, township or village affecting any industrial develop-
 ment project or facility shall apply to such project or facility.  All
 other  existing  local  laws, resolutions, ordinances or rules and regu-
 lations not provided for in such agreement shall be applicable  to  such
 industrial  development  projects  or facilities.  All such local laws,
 resolutions, ordinances or rules and regulations enacted after the  date
 of such agreement or agreements shall not be applicable to such projects
 A. 9644  125
 
 or  facilities unless made applicable by such agreement or agreements or
 any modification or modifications thereto.
  So  long  as  any  facility  constituting  a portion of any industrial
 development project or facility shall be owned, controlled  or  operated
 by  the port authority, no public authority, agency, commission or muni-
 cipality of either or both of the two  states  shall  have  jurisdiction
 over such project or facility nor shall any such public authority, agen-
 cy,  commission  or municipality have any jurisdiction over the terms or
 method of effectuation of all or any portion thereof by the port author-
 ity including but not limited to the transfer  of  all  or  any  portion
 thereof  to  or  by  the  port  authority;  provided, however, the port
 authority is authorized and empowered to submit to the jurisdiction over
 such project or facility of either state or any  department  thereof  or
 any  such  public authority, agency, commission or municipality when the
 exercise of such jurisdiction is necessary  for  the  administration  or
 implementation  of  federal environmental or solid waste disposal legis-
 lation by either state.
  Nothing in this part shall be deemed to  prevent  the  port  authority
 from  establishing, acquiring, owning, leasing, constructing, effectuat-
 ing,  developing,  maintaining,  operating,  rehabilitating,  improving,
 selling, transferring or mortgaging all or any portion of any industrial
 development  project  or facility through wholly owned subsidiary corpo-
 rations of the port authority or subsidiary corporations  owned  by  the
 port  authority  jointly with any public authority, agency or commission
 of either or both of the two states or from transferring to or from  any
 such corporations any moneys, real property or other property for any of
 the  purposes  of this part.  If the port authority shall determine from
 time to time to form such a subsidiary corporation it  shall  do  so  by
 executing  and  filing  with  the secretary of state of the State of New
 York and the secretary of state of the State of New Jersey a certificate
 of incorporation, which may be amended from  time  to  time  by  similar
 filing,  which  shall set forth the name of such subsidiary corporation,
 its duration, the location of its principal  office,  any  joint  owners
 thereof,  and  the  purposes  of the incorporation which shall be one or
 more of  the  purposes  of  establishing,  acquiring,  owning,  leasing,
 constructing, effectuating, developing, maintaining, operating, rehabil-
 itating,  improving,  selling,  transferring  or  mortgaging  all or any
 portion of any industrial development project or facility.  The  direc-
 tors  of  such  subsidiary corporation shall be the same persons holding
 the offices of commissioners of the port authority together with persons
 representing any joint owner thereof as provided for in the agreement in
 connection with the incorporation thereof.  Such subsidiary  corporation
 shall  have  all  the powers vested in the port authority itself for the
 purposes of this part except  that  it  shall  not  have  the  power  to
 contract indebtedness.  Such subsidiary corporation and any of its prop-
 erty, functions and activities shall have all of the privileges, immuni-
 ties,  tax  exemptions and other exemptions of the port authority and of
 the port authority's property, functions and activities.  Such  subsid-
 iary corporation shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations to
 which  the  port authority may be subject, including, but not limited to
 the requirement that no action taken at any  meeting  of  the  board  of
 directors  of  such  subsidiary  corporation  shall have force or effect
 until the governors of the two states shall have an opportunity, in  the
 same manner and within the same time as now or hereafter provided by law
 for approval or veto of actions taken at any meeting of the port author-
 ity itself, to approve or veto such action.  Such subsidiary corporation
 A. 9644  126
 
 shall  be  subject  to  suit in accordance with subdivision nine of this
 section and chapter three hundred one of the laws of New York  of  nine-
 teen  hundred fifty and continued by part XIV of this article, and chap-
 ter  two  hundred  four  of  the  laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred
 fifty-one as if such subsidiary  corporation  were  the  port  authority
 itself.  Such  subsidiary  corporation may be a participating employer
 under the New York retirement and social security law or any similar law
 of either state and the employees of any  such  subsidiary  corporation,
 except  those who are also employees of the port authority, shall not be
 deemed employees of the port authority.
  Whenever any state, municipality, commission, public authority,  agen-
 cy,  officer,  department, board or division is authorized and empowered
 for any of the purposes of this part to co-operate and enter into agree-
 ments with the port authority or  to  grant  any  consent  to  the  port
 authority  or to grant, convey, lease or otherwise transfer any property
 to the port authority or to execute any document,  such  state,  munici-
 pality, commission, public authority, agency, officer, department, board
 or  division shall have the same authorization and power for any of such
 purposes to co-operate and enter into agreements  with  such  subsidiary
 corporation  and to grant consents to such subsidiary corporation and to
 grant, convey, lease or otherwise transfer property to  such  subsidiary
 corporation and to execute documents for such subsidiary corporation.
  13. The bonds issued by the port authority to provide funds for any of
 the  purposes of this part are hereby made securities in which all state
 and municipal officers and bodies of both states,  all  trust  companies
 and  banks other than savings banks, all building and loan associations,
 savings and loan associations, investment companies  and  other  persons
 carrying  on  a  commercial  banking  business, all insurance companies,
 insurance associations and other persons carrying on an insurance  busi-
 ness,  and  all administrators, executors, guardians, trustees and other
 fiduciaries, and  all  other  persons  whatsoever  (other  than  savings
 banks),  who  are  now or may hereafter be authorized by either state to
 invest in bonds of such state,  may  properly  and  legally  invest  any
 funds, including capital, belonging to them or within their control, and
 said  bonds are hereby made securities which may properly and legally be
 deposited with and shall be received by any state or  municipal  officer
 or agency of either state for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds
 of  such  state is now or may hereafter be authorized.  The bonds issued
 by the port authority to provide funds for any of the purposes  of  this
 part  as  security  for  which  the general reserve fund shall have been
 pledged in whole or in part are hereby  made  securities  in  which  all
 savings  banks  also may properly and legally invest any funds including
 capital, belonging to them or within their control.
  14. Subsequent to and subject to the execution  of  the  agreement  or
 agreements  authorized by subdivisions eleven and twelve of this section
 the projects and facilities and at the locations specified  therein,  if
 the  port  authority shall find it necessary, convenient or desirable to
 acquire from time to time any real property or any property  other  than
 real  property  (including  but not limited to contract rights and other
 tangible or intangible personal property), for any of  the  purposes  of
 this  act  whether  for  immediate  or  future  use (including temporary
 construction, rehabilitation or improvement),  the  port  authority  may
 find  and determine that such property, whether a fee simple absolute or
 a lesser interest, is required for a public use, and upon such  determi-
 nation the said property shall be and shall be deemed to be required for
 such  public  use  until otherwise determined by the port authority, and
 A. 9644  127
 
 such determination shall not be affected by the fact that such  property
 has theretofore been taken for and is then devoted to a public use;  but
 the public use in the hands of or under the control of the port authori-
 ty  shall be deemed superior to the public use in the hands of any other
 person, association or corporation.
  The port authority may acquire and is hereby authorized so to  acquire
 from  time to time, for any of the purposes of this part, such property,
 whether a fee simple  absolute  or  a  lesser  estate,  by  condemnation
 (including the exercise of the right of eminent domain) under and pursu-
 ant  to  the provisions of the eminent domain procedure law of the state
 of New York in the case of property located in or having  its  situs  in
 such  state,  and  chapter  three  hundred  sixty-one of the laws of New
 Jersey of nineteen hundred seventy-one, in the case of property  located
 in  or  having  its  situs  in such state, or, at the option of the port
 authority, as provided in section fifteen of chapter forty-three of  the
 laws  of  New Jersey of nineteen hundred forty-seven, as amended, in the
 case of property located in or having its situs in such state, or pursu-
 ant to such other and alternate procedure as may be provided by  law  of
 the state in which such property is located or has its situs; and all of
 said statutes for the acquisition of real property shall, for any of the
 purposes of this part, be applied also to the acquisition of other prop-
 erty  authorized  by  this  subdivision,  except that such provisions as
 pertain to surveys, diagrams, maps, plans or  profiles,  assessed  valu-
 ation,  lis  pendens, service of notice and papers, filing in the office
 of the clerk in which the real property affected is  situated  and  such
 other  provisions  as  by  their nature cannot be applicable to property
 other than real property, shall not be applicable to the acquisition  of
 such  other  property.  In  the  event that any property other than real
 property is acquired for any of the purposes of  this  part  under  this
 section  then,  with  respect  to  such  other  property, notice of such
 proceeding and all subsequent notices or court processes shall be served
 upon the owners of such other property and upon the  port  authority  by
 personal  service  or  by registered or certified mail, except as may be
 otherwise directed by the court.
  The  port  authority  is  hereby  authorized  and  empowered,  in  its
 discretion,  from  time  to  time to combine any property which is to be
 acquired as aforesaid by condemnation for any of the  purposes  of  this
 part  for  acquisition  in a single action or proceeding notwithstanding
 that part of the property so to be  acquired  is  personal  property  or
 mixed real and personal property or may be owned by more than one owner.
  The  owner of any property acquired by condemnation or the exercise of
 the right of eminent domain for any of the purposes of  this  act  shall
 not  be  awarded  for such property any increment above the just compen-
 sation required by the constitutions of the United  States  and  of  the
 state  or  states  in  which the property is located or has its situs by
 reason of any circumstances whatsoever.
  Nothing herein contained  shall  be  construed  to  prevent  the  port
 authority  from  bringing  any proceedings to remove a cloud on title or
 such other proceedings as it may, in its  discretion,  deem  proper  and
 necessary,  or  from  acquiring  any  such  property  by  negotiation or
 purchase.
  Where a person entitled to an award in the proceedings for the  acqui-
 sition  of  property  by condemnation or the right of eminent domain for
 any of the purposes of this part remains in possession of such  property
 after  the  time  of  the  vesting  of  title in the port authority, the
 reasonable value of this use and occupancy of such  property  subsequent
 A. 9644  128
 
 to  such time, as fixed by agreement or by the court in such proceedings
 or by any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be a lien against  such
 award,  subject  only  to  liens of record at the time of the vesting of
 title in the port authority.
  15. The port authority and its duly authorized agents, and all persons
 acting  under  its  authority  and  by  its  direction, may enter in the
 daytime into and upon any real property for the purpose of  making  such
 surveys, diagrams, maps, plans, soundings or borings as the port author-
 ity  may deem necessary, convenient or desirable for any of the purposes
 of this part.
  16. Any declarations contained herein with respect to the governmental
 nature and public purpose  of  any  industrial  development  project  or
 facility  and  to the exemption of any industrial development project or
 facility property and instruments relating thereto from taxation and  to
 the  discretion  of  the port authority with respect to said projects or
 facilities shall not be construed to imply  that  other  port  authority
 facilities,  property and operations are not of a governmental nature or
 do not serve public purposes, or that they are subject to  taxation,  or
 that  the  determinations of the port authority with respect thereto are
 not conclusive.  The powers hereby vested in the port authority  and  in
 any  subsidiary corporation incorporated for any of the purposes of this
 act (including but not limited to the power to acquire real property  by
 condemnation  or  the  exercise of the right of eminent domain) shall be
 continuing powers and no exercise thereof by the  port  authority  or  a
 subsidiary corporation incorporated for any of the purposes of this part
 shall be deemed to exhaust them or any of them.
  17.  This subdivision and the preceding subdivisions hereof constitute
 an agreement between the states of New York and New Jersey supplementary
 to the compact between the two states dated  April  thirtieth,  nineteen
 hundred  twenty-one  and  amendatory  thereof,  and  shall  be liberally
 construed to effectuate the purposes of said compact and of the  compre-
 hensive plan heretofore adopted by the two states, and the powers grant-
 ed  to  the port authority shall be construed to be in aid of and not in
 limitation or in derogation of any other  powers,  heretofore  conferred
 upon or granted to the port authority.
  18.  If any section, phrase, or provision of this part or the applica-
 tion thereof to any person or circumstances be adjudged invalid  by  any
 court  of competent jurisdiction, so long as the section or remainder of
 the part  shall  nonetheless  permit  the  effectuation,  as  a  unified
 project,  of  any industrial development project or facility, such judg-
 ment shall be confined in its operation to the  section,  part,  phrase,
 provision  or  application directly involved in the controversy in which
 such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not  affect  or  impair
 the  validity of the remainder of this act or the application thereof to
 other persons or circumstances and the two states  hereby  declare  that
 they  would have entered into this part or the remainder thereof had the
 invalidity of such provision or application thereof been apparent.
  19. A copy of the minutes of any action taken at any  meeting  of  the
 port authority in connection with any modification, addition or deletion
 in  or  to  any  or  all of the covenants with or pledges to bondholders

  PART XXVIII
  BUS TRANSPORTATION
 
 Section 2801. Findings and determinations.
  2802. Definitions.
  2803. Bus transportation.
  § 2801. Findings and determinations.  The states of New York  and  New
 Jersey hereby find and determine that:
  1.  The  efficient,  economical  and convenient mass transportation of
 persons to, from and within the port district as defined in the  compact
 between  the  two states dated April thirtieth, nineteen hundred twenty-
 one is vital and essential to the preservation and economic  well  being
 of the northern New Jersey-New York metropolitan area;
 A. 9644  130
 
  2.  In  order  to deter the economic deterioration of the northern New
 Jersey-New York metropolitan  area  adequate  facilities  for  the  mass
 transportation of persons must be provided and buses are and will remain
 of extreme importance in such transportation;
  3.  The  provision of mass transportation including bus transportation
 in urban areas has become financially burdensome and may result  in  the
 additional  curtailment of significant portions of this essential public
 service;
  4. The economic viability of the existing facilities operated  by  the
 port authority is dependent upon the effective and efficient functioning
 of the transportation network of the northern New Jersey-New York metro-
 politan area and access to and proper utilization of such port authority
 facilities  would  be  adversely affected if users of bus transportation
 were to find such transportation unavailable or significantly curtailed;
  5. Buses serving regional bus routes and feeder bus routes and  ancil-
 lary  bus  facilities  constitute an essential part of the mass commuter
 facilities of the port district;
  6. The continued availability of bus transportation requires  substan-
 tial  replacement  of  and additions to the number of buses presently in
 use in the northern New Jersey-New York metropolitan area;
  7. The port authority which was created by agreement of the two states
 as their joint agent for the development of transportation and  terminal
 facilities and other facilities of commerce of the port district and for
 the  promotion and protection of the commerce of their port, is a proper
 agency to provide such  buses  to  each  of  the  two  states  and  such
 provision  of  buses  by  the  port  authority is in the interest of the
 continued viability of the facilities of the port authority, and  is  in
 the public interest;
  8.  The  operation  of the facilities of the port authority, including
 but not limited to the port authority bus terminal at forty-first street
 and eighth avenue in New York county in the city and state of  New  York
 and  the  extension  thereto  currently  under construction (hereinafter
 called the "bus terminal"), the George Washington bridge bus station and
 the provision of buses and ancillary bus  facilities  pursuant  to  this
 part involve the exercise of public and essential governmental functions
 which  must  be  performed by the two states or any municipality, public
 authority, agency, or commission of either or both states;
  9. The revision to the port authority bridge and tunnel toll schedules
 which  was  effective  May  fifth,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-five,  is
 expected  to  result in additional revenues to the port authority suffi-
 cient to support the financing  with  consolidated  bonds  of  the  port
 authority  of  approximately  four hundred million dollars for passenger
 mass transportation  capital  projects  (hereinafter  called  "passenger
 facilities"),  approximately  one  hundred sixty million dollars thereof
 being allocated to the extension to the bus terminal, with the remaining
 two hundred forty million dollars to be allocated on the  basis  of  one
 hundred  twenty  million dollars in each state for passenger facilities,
 including but not limited to the acquisition, development and  financing
 of  buses  and  related facilities, as determined by each such state and
 the port authority acting  pursuant  to  legislative  authorization  and
 commitments to the holders of port authority obligations; and
  10.  The  port  authority's  function  as a regional agency of the two
 states makes it appropriate that line-haul regional bus route  passenger
 facilities  be  equipped  pursuant to this part with buses and ancillary
 bus facilities and that the need for development and equipment  of  such
 routes be satisfied on a priority basis.
 A. 9644  131
 
  § 2802. Definitions.  For the purpose of this part:
  1.  "Ancillary bus facilities" shall mean any facilities useful in the
 provision of service for line-haul regional or feeder bus routes includ-
 ing but not limited to (a) fare collection,  communication,  signal  and
 identification  equipment,  (b) equipment to aid in the provision of bus
 service to the elderly and  handicapped,  (c)  maintenance,  repair  and
 storage facilities and equipment, and (d) bus stations for use primarily
 by  passengers  traveling  between  New  York and New Jersey; automobile
 parking lots for use by  people  who  transfer  to  buses  on  line-haul
 regional  bus  routes or feeder bus routes; and shelters at roadside bus
 stops to afford waiting bus passengers protection from precipitation and
 wind;
  2. "Buses" shall mean vehicles containing seats  for  twelve  or  more
 passengers which are designed for and regularly used in scheduled common
 carrier  passenger  mass transportation service on streets, highways and
 exclusive busways and which  are  not  designed  or  used  for  railroad
 purposes;
  3.  "Consolidated  bonds"  shall  mean consolidated bonds of the issue
 established by the resolution of the  port  authority,  adopted  October
 ninth, nineteen hundred fifty-two;
  4.  "Develop" shall mean plan, design, construct, improve or rehabili-
 tate;
  5. "Feeder bus routes" shall mean those bus routes entirely within the
 regional bus area which connect within the port district with a bus stop
 on a line-haul regional bus route, a  passenger  ferry,  or  a  railroad
 station;
  6.  "Line-haul  regional  bus  routes" shall mean bus routes which are
 entirely within the regional bus area and  which  extend  from  a  point
 outside  the  county  in which the bus terminal is located to a point in
 such county;
  7. "Municipality" shall mean a county, city, borough,  village,  town,
 township,  or  other  similar  political  subdivision of New York or New
 Jersey;
  8. "Person" shall mean any person, including individuals, firms, part-
 nerships, associations, societies, trusts, public utilities,  public  or
 private  corporations,  or  other  legal  entities,  including public or
 governmental bodies, which may include the port authority,  as  well  as
 natural persons;
  9.  "Railroad station" shall mean a stop on a rail or subway system at
 which passengers embark or disembark; and
  10. "Regional bus area" shall mean that area in the states of New York
 and New Jersey which lies within a radius of seventy-five miles  of  the
 bus terminal.
  §  2803.  Bus transportation. 1.  The port authority is authorized and
 empowered to acquire, develop, finance, and transfer buses and ancillary
 bus facilities for the purpose  of  leasing,  selling,  transferring  or
 otherwise  disposing  of such buses and ancillary bus facilities only to
 the state of New York and the state of  New  Jersey  or  to  any  public
 authority,  agency, commission, city or county thereof and designated by
 such state (hereinafter called the "lessee"). Such  buses  may  be  used
 only  on  line-haul regional bus routes or on feeder bus routes and such
 ancillary bus facilities shall be developed for and used  in  connection
 with  buses  which travel on line-haul regional bus routes or feeder bus
 routes; provided, however, that (a) such buses may be used  for  charter
 bus  trips  which  originate  in the regional bus area, which take place
 when such buses are not needed for service  on  line-haul  regional  bus
 A. 9644  132
 
 routes  or  feeder  bus  routes,  and  which  comply with all applicable
 requirements including but not limited to those of  the  port  authority
 and the lessee; and (b) provided that fare collection, communication and
 identification  equipment and maintenance, repair and storage facilities
 and  equipment  acquired  pursuant  to  this  act  may  be  utilized  in
 connection with bus service which is not on line-haul regional or feeder
 bus  routes  to  the  extent that such utilization shall comply with all
 applicable requirements including but not limited to those of  the  port
 authority and the lessee. Ancillary bus facilities which are not located
 on  buses  or which are not otherwise intended to be moved from place to
 place shall be located only within the port district.
  2. Any such lease, sale, transfer or other disposition  of  buses  and
 ancillary  bus facilities shall be on such terms and conditions, includ-
 ing consideration, consistent with this part as the port authority shall
 deem in the public interest and which shall be acceptable  to  the  port
 authority and the lessee. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law,
 general,  special or local, part of the consideration for any such lease
 or transfer shall consist of an agreement by the lessee to maintain  and
 use  such  buses  and  ancillary bus facilities, or cause such buses and
 ancillary bus facilities to be  maintained  and  used  by  others  under
 agreement with the lessee, in the effective and efficient transportation
 of  passengers  in  accordance  with this act and the port authority may
 accept such agreement in lieu of any other consideration for such  lease
 or  transfer.  The lessee shall be responsible for the proper operation,
 maintenance, repair and use of the buses and  ancillary  bus  facilities
 and  the  port authority shall not be liable in any respect by reason of
 the ownership, development, operation, maintenance,  repair  or  use  of
 such buses and ancillary bus facilities. Anything contained in this part
 to the contrary notwithstanding, development of such buses and ancillary
 bus  facilities  and  introduction  into  service of such buses shall be
 subject to the approval of the lessee.
  3. The two states covenant and agree with  each  other  and  with  the
 holders of the present and future obligations of the port authority that
 (a)  the lessee of buses or ancillary bus facilities leased, transferred
 or otherwise disposed of pursuant to this  part  shall  be  required  to
 defend  and to provide for indemnification, subject to appropriations or
 other funds which are or become legally available for this  purpose,  of
 the port authority against any liability of whatsoever form or nature as
 may  be  imposed  upon  the  port  authority by reason of the ownership,
 development, operation, maintenance, repair or use  thereof  or  arising
 otherwise  out  of the port authority's interest therein; (b) the lessee
 shall be required to provide for and be responsible for the proper oper-
 ation, maintenance, repair, and use of  such  buses  and  ancillary  bus
 facilities leased, transferred or otherwise disposed of pursuant to this
 part  and  the  port  authority  shall have no responsibility as to such
 operation, maintenance, repair or use; and (c) neither  the  states  nor
 the  port  authority  will  apply  to  any purpose in connection with or
 relating to the operation, maintenance, repair or use  of  such  bus  or
 ancillary  bus  facilities  leased, transferred or otherwise disposed of
 pursuant to this part, other than purposes in connection with the utili-
 zation of other port authority facilities by such  buses  and  passenger
 information  purposes,  any of the rentals, tolls, fares, fees, charges,
 revenues, reserves or other funds of the port authority which have  been
 or  shall  be pledged in whole or in part as security for obligations as
 security for which there may be or shall be pledged, in whole or in part
 the general reserve fund of the port authority.
 A. 9644  133

  4. Any capital expenditures by the port authority for buses and ancil-
 lary bus  facilities  to  be  leased,  sold,  transferred  or  otherwise
 disposed  of  pursuant  to  this part shall be made with the proceeds of
 consolidated bonds of the port authority, which may be issued to finance
 such capital expenditures, and such capital expenditures shall be a part
 of  and  shall not exceed the allocations for passenger facilities to be
 made from time to time as determined in accordance with subdivision nine
 of section twenty-eight hundred one of this part.
  5. The port authority is authorized and empowered  to  cooperate  with
 the  states  of  New York and New Jersey, with any municipality thereof,
 with the federal government and any public authority, agency or  commis-
 sion  of the foregoing or with any one or more of them or with any other
 person to the extent that it finds it necessary and desirable to  do  so
 in  connection  with  the  acquisition, development, financing, leasing,
 sale, transfer or other disposition of buses and ancillary  bus  facili-
 ties and to enter into an agreement or agreements (and from time to time
 to  enter  into agreements amending or supplementing the same) with said
 states, municipalities, federal government,  public  authorities,  agen-
 cies,  commissions  and  persons  or with any one or more of them for or
 relating to such purposes.
  6. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, general, special  or
 local,  either  state  or any municipality, public authority, agency, or
 commission of either or both of said two states or any other  person  is
 authorized  and  empowered  to  cooperate with the port authority and to
 enter into an agreement or agreements (and from time to  time  to  enter
 into  agreements  amending  or  supplementing  the  same)  with the port
 authority including but not limited to the agreements  with  respect  to
 buses  and  ancillary  bus  facilities  leased, transferred or otherwise
 disposed of pursuant to this part, upon such reasonable terms and condi-
 tions as determined by such state, municipality, public authority, agen-
 cy, commission or person and the port authority.
  7. Any consent by a municipality shall be given and the terms,  condi-
 tions  and  execution  by  a municipality of any agreement, deed, lease,
 conveyance or other instrument pursuant to this subdivision or any other
 subdivision of this section shall be authorized in the  manner  provided
 in  article  twenty-two  of  the  compact  of  April thirtieth, nineteen
 hundred twenty-one between the two states creating the  port  authority,
 except  that as to towns in the state of New York, such consent shall be
 authorized in the manner provided in the town law and as to counties  in
 the  state of New Jersey, such consent shall be authorized in the manner
 provided in New Jersey statutes annotated,  title  forty:  chapter  one,
 section  one,  et  seq. The terms and conditions and execution by either
 state of  any  agreement,  consent,  designation,  determination,  deed,
 lease,  conveyance  or  other instrument pursuant to this subdivision or
 any other subdivision of this section shall be effective  if  authorized
 by the governor of such state. The powers herein granted to either state
 or  any  municipality,  public  authority, agency or commission shall be
 construed to be in aid of and not in limitation or in derogation of  any
 such  powers  heretofore  or hereafter conferred upon or granted to such
 state, municipality, public authority, agency or commission. Any consent
 by a public authority, agency or commission shall be effective if  given
 by such public authority, agency or commission.
  8. The port authority shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments
 upon  any  of the property, real or personal, acquired or used by it for
 any purpose of this part or upon any  lease,  deed,  mortgage  or  other
 instrument  affecting such property or upon the recording of any instru-
 A. 9644  134
 
 ment made in connection with the  acquisition,  development,  financing,
 lease, sale, transfer or other disposition or use of such property.
  9.  The port authority shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of any
 municipality, public authority, agency or commission of either  or  both
 of  the  two  states  in  connection  with the acquisition, development,
 financing, lease, sale, transfer or other disposition of  buses,  ancil-
 lary bus facilities or otherwise in connection with the purposes of this
 part.
  10.  The  acquisition, development, financing, leasing, sale, transfer
 or other disposition by the port authority of buses  and  ancillary  bus
 facilities  in accordance with this part are and will be in all respects
 for the benefit of the people of the said two states, for  the  increase
 of  their  commerce  and  prosperity  and  for  the improvement of their
 health, safety and living conditions and shall be deemed  to  be  public
 purposes;  and  the  port  authority  shall be regarded as performing an
 essential governmental function in undertaking such acquisition,  devel-
 opment,  financing,  leasing,  sale,  transfer  or  other disposition or
 otherwise carrying out the provisions of this part.
  11. Any declarations contained herein with respect to the governmental
 nature and public purposes of the facilities authorized by this part and
 to the exemption of such facilities  and  instruments  relating  thereto
 from  taxation  and to the discretion of the port authority with respect
 to said facilities shall not be  construed  to  imply  that  other  port
 authority  facilities, property and operations are not of a governmental
 nature or do not serve public purposes, or  that  they  are  subject  to
 taxation,  or that the determinations of the port authority with respect
 thereto are not conclusive.
  12. This subdivision and the preceding subdivisions hereof  constitute
 an agreement between the states of New York and New Jersey supplementary
 to  the  compact  between the two states dated April thirtieth, nineteen
 hundred twenty-one  and  amendatory  thereof,  and  shall  be  liberally
 construed  to effectuate the purposes of said compact and of the compre-
 hensive plan heretofore adopted by the two states, and the powers grant-
 ed to the port authority shall be construed to be in aid of and  not  in
 limitation  or  in  derogation  of any other powers heretofore conferred
 upon or granted to the port authority.

  §  3001.  Compact.  The "waterfront and airport commission of New York
 and New Jersey compact" as first enacted by chapter eight hundred eight-
 y-two of the laws of nineteen hundred fifty-three is hereby continued to
 read as follows. The state of New York hereby agrees with the  state  of
 New Jersey, upon the enactment by the state of New Jersey of legislation
 having the same effect as this section, to the following compact.
  §  3002.  Findings and declarations. 1. The states of New York and New
 Jersey hereby find and declare that the conditions  under  which  water-
 front  labor  is  employed  within  the  port  of  New York district are
 depressing and degrading to such labor, resulting from the lack  of  any
 systematic  method of hiring, the lack of adequate information as to the
 availability of employment, corrupt hiring practices and the  fact  that
 persons  conducting  such  hiring  are  frequently criminals and persons
 notoriously lacking in moral character and integrity and neither respon-
 sive or responsible to the employers nor to the uncoerced  will  of  the
 majority  of  the  members  of the labor organizations of the employees;
 that as a result waterfront laborers suffer from irregularity of employ-
 ment, fear and insecurity, inadequate earnings, an unduly high  accident
 rate,  subjection  to borrowing at usurious rates of interest, exploita-
 tion and extortion as the price of securing employment  and  a  loss  of
 respect  for  the law;  that not only does there result a destruction of
 the dignity of an important segment of  American  labor,  but  a  direct
 encouragement  of  crime which imposes a levy of greatly increased costs
 on food, fuel and other necessaries handled in and through the  port  of
 New York district.
  2.  The states of New York and New Jersey hereby find and declare that
 many of the evils above described result not only from the causes  above
 described  but  from  the practices of public loaders at piers and other
 waterfront terminals;  that such public loaders serve no valid  economic
 purpose and operate as parasites exacting a high and unwarranted toll on
 the  flow  of commerce in and through the port of New York district, and
 have used force and engaged in  discriminatory  and  coercive  practices
 including  extortion  against  persons not desiring to employ them;  and
 that the function of loading and unloading trucks and other  land  vehi-
 cles  at  piers  and  other  waterfront  terminals  can  and  should  be
 performed, as in every other major American port, without the evils  and
 abuses  of  the  public loader system, and by the carriers of freight by
 water, stevedores and operators  of  such  piers  and  other  waterfront
 terminals or the operators of such trucks or other land vehicles.
  3.  The states of New York and New Jersey hereby find and declare that
 many of the evils above described result not only from the causes  above
 described  but  from  the lack of regulation of the occupation of steve-
 dores;  that such stevedores have engaged in corrupt practices to induce
 their hire by carriers of freight by water and to  induce  officers  and
 A. 9644  137
 
 representatives  of  labor  organizations  to  betray their trust to the
 members of such labor organizations.
  4.  The states of New York and New Jersey hereby find and declare that
 the  occupations  of  longshoremen,  stevedores,  pier  superintendents,
 hiring  agents  and  port  watchmen  are affected with a public interest
 requiring their regulation and that such regulation shall be  deemed  an
 exercise of the police power of the two states for the protection of the
 public  safety, welfare, prosperity, health, peace and living conditions
 of the people of the two states.
  § 3003. Definitions. As used in this compact:
  1. "The port of New York district" shall mean the district created  by

 hundred twenty-one and continued by article I of this chapter, and chap-

 more of the foregoing.
  6. "Carrier of freight by water" shall mean  any  person  who  may  be
 engaged or who may hold himself out as willing to be engaged, whether as
 a  common  carrier,  as  a  contract  carrier  or  otherwise (except for
 carriage of liquid cargoes in bulk in  tank  vessels  designed  for  use
 exclusively  in  such  service  or  carriage  by  barge  of bulk cargoes
 consisting of only a single commodity loaded or carried without wrappers
 or containers and delivered by the carrier without  transportation  mark
 or  count)  in the carriage of freight by water between any point in the
 port of New York district and a point outside said district.
  7. "Waterborne freight" shall mean freight carried by or consigned for

 the  state  of New Jersey and two to be chosen by the state of New York.
 The members representing each state shall be appointed by  the  governor
 of such state with the advice and consent of the senate thereof, without
 regard  to  the  state  of  residence of such members, and shall receive
 compensation to be fixed by the governor of such state.  The  term  of
 office  of  each member shall be for four years; provided, however, that
 the two present members of the  commission  heretofore  appointed  shall
 continue  to  serve  as  members  until the expiration of the respective
 terms for which they were appointed,  that  the  term  of  the  two  new
 members  shall expire on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-three,

 diately preceding chairman.
  §  3005.  General powers of commission.  In addition to the powers and

 conditions of waterfront labor within the port of New York district, for
 the  alleviation of the evils described in section three thousand two of

 request any such department, division,  bureau,  board,  commission,  or

  § 3006. Pier superintendents and hiring agents.  1. On or  after  the
 first day of December, nineteen hundred fifty-three, no person shall act
 as  a  pier  superintendent  or as a hiring agent within the port of New
 York district without  first  having  obtained  from  the  commission  a
 license  to act as such pier superintendent or hiring agent, as the case
 may be, and no person shall employ or engage another person to act as  a
 pier superintendent or hiring agent who is not so licensed.
  2.  A license to act as a pier superintendent or hiring agent shall be
 issued only upon the written application,  under  oath,  of  the  person

 intendent or hiring agent, verified by the prospective  licensee  as  to
 the matters concerning him, and shall state the following:

 sion  to ascertain the character, integrity and identity of the prospec-
 tive licensee;  and

 applicant  will  employ  such  licensee as pier superintendent or hiring
 agent, as the case may be.
  3. No such license shall be granted
  (a) Unless the commission shall  be  satisfied  that  the  prospective
 licensee possesses good character and integrity;
  (b)  If  the prospective licensee has, without subsequent pardon, been
 convicted by a court of the United States, or  any  state  or  territory
 thereof,  of  the commission of, or the attempt or conspiracy to commit,
 treason, murder, manslaughter or any felony or high misdemeanor  or  any
 of  the following misdemeanors or offenses: illegally using, carrying or
 possessing a pistol or other  dangerous  weapon;  making  or  possessing
 burglar's  instruments;  buying  or  receiving stolen property; unlawful

 ing,  possessing  with  intent  to distribute, sale or distribution of a

 for a license by reason of any such conviction may  submit  satisfactory
 evidence  to  the  commission  that he has for a period of not less than
 A. 9644  141
 
 five years, measured as hereinafter provided, and  up  to  the  time  of
 application,  so  conducted  himself  as  to  warrant  the grant of such
 license, in which event the commission may, in its discretion, issue  an
 order  removing  such  ineligibility. The aforesaid period of five years
 shall be measured either from the date of payment of  any  fine  imposed
 upon  such  person or the suspension of sentence or from the date of his
 unrevoked release from custody by parole, commutation or termination  of
 his sentence;
  (c)  If  the  prospective licensee knowingly or wilfully advocates the
 desirability of overthrowing or destroying the government of the  United
 States  by force or violence or shall be a member of a group which advo-
 cates such desirability, knowing the purposes of such group include such
 advocacy.
  4. When the application shall have  been  examined  and  such  further
 inquiry  and  investigation made as the commission shall deem proper and
 when the commission shall be satisfied therefrom  that  the  prospective
 licensee  possesses  the  qualifications  and requirements prescribed in
 this section, the commission shall issue and deliver to the  prospective
 licensee a license to act as pier superintendent or hiring agent for the
 applicant,  as  the  case  may be, and shall inform the applicant of his
 action.  The commission may issue a temporary permit to any  prospective
 licensee  for  a  license  under  the provisions of this section pending
 final action on an application made for such a license.  Any such permit
 shall be valid for a period not in excess of thirty days.
  5. No person shall be licensed to act  as  a  pier  superintendent  or
 hiring  agent  for  more  than  one employer, except at a single pier or
 other  waterfront  terminal,  but  nothing  in  this  section  shall  be
 construed  to  limit  in  any  way the number of pier superintendents or
 hiring agents any employer may employ.
  6. A license granted pursuant to this section shall  continue  through
 the duration of the licensee's employment by the employer who shall have
 applied for his license.
  7.  Any  license  issued  pursuant  to  this section may be revoked or
 suspended for such period as the commission deems in the public interest
 or the licensee thereunder may be reprimanded for any of  the  following
 offenses:
  (a)  Conviction of a crime or act by the licensee or other cause which
 would require or permit his disqualification from  receiving  a  license
 upon original application;
  (b)  Fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in securing the license, or in
 the conduct of the licensed activity;

  (g) Consorting with known criminals for an unlawful purpose;
  (h) Transfer or surrender of possession of the license to  any  person
 either temporarily or permanently without satisfactory explanation;
 A. 9644  142
 
  (i) False impersonation of another licensee under this section;

 than  the  licensee's  employer  as  consideration  for the selection or
 retention for employment of any longshoreman;
  (k) Coercion of a longshoreman by threat of discrimination or violence
 or economic reprisal, to make purchases from or to utilize the  services
 of any person;

 for which there is a charge of interest or other consideration;  and
  (m) Membership in a labor organization which  represents  longshoremen
 or  port  watchmen;  but nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to
 prohibit pier superintendents or hiring agents from being represented by
 a labor organization or organizations which do not also represent  long-
 shoremen  or  port  watchmen.  The  American  Federation of Labor, the
 Congress of Industrial Organizations and any other  similar  federation,
 congress or other organization of national or international occupational
 or  industrial  labor organizations shall not be considered an organiza-
 tion which represents longshoremen or port watchmen within  the  meaning
 of  this  section  although  one  of  the federated or constituent labor
 organizations thereof may represent longshoremen or port watchmen.
  § 3007. Stevedores.  1. On or after the first day of  December,  nine-
 teen  hundred fifty-three, no person shall act as a stevedore within the

 services as such within the port of New York district unless the  steve-
 dore is so licensed.
  2.  Any  person intending to act as a stevedore within the port of New
 York district shall file in the  office  of  the  commission  a  written

 signed  and  verified  by such person and if the applicant is a partner-
 ship, the application shall be  signed  and  verified  by  each  natural
 person  composing or intending to compose such partnership. The applica-
 tion shall state the full name, age,  residence,  business  address  (if
 any), present and previous occupations of each natural person so signing
 the  same,  and  any  other facts and evidence as may be required by the
 commission to ascertain the character, integrity and  identity  of  each
 natural person so signing such application.
  (b) If the applicant is a corporation, the application shall be signed
 and  verified  by  the  president,  secretary and treasurer thereof, and

 owning 5 per cent or more of any of the stock thereof, and of all  offi-
 cers  (including  all  members of the board of directors).  The require-
 ments of paragraph (a) of this subdivision as to a natural person who is
 a member of a partnership, and such requirements as may be specified  in
 rules and regulations promulgated by the commission, shall apply to each
 such  officer  or stockholder and their successors in office or interest
 as the case may be.
  (c) In the event of the death, resignation or removal of any  officer,
 and in the event of any change in the list of stockholders who shall own

 the commission, certified by said secretary.
 A. 9644  143
 
  3. No such license shall be granted:
  (a)  If  any person whose signature or name appears in the application

 section  to sign or to be identified in the application or if the person
 so signing or named in the application is an undisclosed agent or  trus-
 tee for any such real party in interest;
  (b)  Unless  the  commission shall be satisfied that the applicant and
 all members, officers and stockholders required by  subdivision  two  of
 this  section  to  sign  or be identified in the application for license
 possess good character and integrity;
  (c) Unless the applicant is either a natural  person,  partnership  or
 corporation;
  (d)  Unless the applicant shall be a party to a contract then in force
 or which will take effect upon the issuance of a license, with a carrier
 of freight by water for the loading and unloading by  the  applicant  of
 one  or  more  vessels  of such carrier at a pier within the port of New
 York district;
  (e) If the applicant or any member, officer or stockholder required by
 subdivision two of this section to sign or be identified in the applica-
 tion for license has, without subsequent pardon,  been  convicted  by  a
 court  of  the  United  States  or any state or territory thereof of the
 commission of, or the attempt or conspiracy to commit, treason,  murder,
 manslaughter  or  any felony or high misdemeanor or any of the misdemea-
 nors or offenses described in paragraph (b) of subdivision three of this
 section. Any applicant ineligible for a license by reason  of  any  such
 conviction  may  submit satisfactory evidence to the commission that the
 person whose conviction was the basis of ineligibility has for a  period
 of  not less than five years, measured as hereinafter provided and up to
 the time of application, so conducted himself as to warrant the grant of
 such license, in which event the commission may, in its discretion issue
 an order removing such ineligibility. The aforesaid period of five years
 shall be measured either from the date of payment of  any  fine  imposed
 upon  such  person or the suspension of sentence or from the date of his
 unrevoked release from custody by parole, commutation or termination  of
 his sentence;
  (f)  If,  on  or  after  July first, nineteen hundred fifty-three, the

 carrier for the performance of stevedoring services;
  (g)  If,  on  or  after  July first, nineteen hundred fifty-three, the
 applicant has paid, given, caused to be paid or given or offered to  pay
 or  give  to  any  officer or representative of a labor organization any
 valuable consideration for an improper or unlawful purpose or to  induce
 such  officer  or  representative  to  subordinate the interests of such
 labor organization or its members in the management of  the  affairs  of
 such labor organization to the interests of the applicant.
  4.  When  the  application  shall  have been examined and such further
 inquiry and investigation made as the commission shall deem  proper  and
 when  the  commission  shall  be  satisfied therefrom that the applicant
 possesses  the  qualifications  and  requirements  prescribed  in  this
 section, the commission shall issue and deliver a license to such appli-
 cant.  The commission may issue a temporary permit to any applicant for
 a license under the provisions of this article pending final  action  on
 A. 9644  144
 
 an  application made for such a license.  Any such permit shall be valid
 for a period not in excess of thirty days.
  5.  A  license granted pursuant to this section shall be for a term of
 two years or fraction of such two year period, and shall expire  on  the
 first  day  of  December  of each odd numbered year. In the event of the
 death of the licensee, if  a  natural  person,  or  its  termination  or
 dissolution by reason of the death of a partner, if a partnership, or if
 the  licensee  shall  cease  to  be  a party to any contract of the type
 required by paragraph (d) of subdivision  three  of  this  section,  the
 license shall terminate ninety days after such event or upon its expira-
 tion  date,  whichever  shall be sooner. A license may be renewed by the
 commission for successive two year  periods  upon  fulfilling  the  same
 requirements  as  are set forth in this section for an original applica-
 tion.
  6. Any license issued pursuant to  this  section  may  be  revoked  or
 suspended for such period as the commission deems in the public interest
 or  the  licensee thereunder may be reprimanded for any of the following
 offenses on the part of the licensee or of any person required by subdi-
 vision two of this section to sign  or  be  identified  in  an  original
 application for a license:
  (a) Conviction of a crime or other cause which would permit or require

 receipts and disbursements arising out of his activities within the port
 of New York district;
  (d)  Failure  to keep said books and records available during business
 hours for inspection by the commission and its duly designated represen-

  § 3008.  Prohibition of public loading.  1. The states of New York and
 New  Jersey  hereby  find  and declare that the transfer of cargo to and
 from trucks at piers and other waterfront terminals in the port  of  New
 York  district  has  resulted in vicious and notorious abuses by persons
 commonly known as "public loaders." There is  compelling  evidence  that
 such  persons  have  exacted the payment of exorbitant charges for their
 services, real and alleged, and otherwise extorted  large  sums  through
 force,  threats  of  violence, unauthorized labor disturbances and other
 coercive activities, and that they had been responsible for and  abetted
 criminal  activities  on  the  waterfront.  These practices which have
 developed in the port of New York district impose unjustified  costs  on
 the  handling of goods in and through the port of New York district, and
 increase the prices paid by consumers for food, fuel  and  other  neces-
 saries,  and  impair  the  economic  stability  of  the port of New York
 district.  It is the sense of the legislatures of the states of New York
 and New Jersey that these practices and conditions must be eliminated to
 prevent grave injury to the welfare of the people.
  2. It is hereby declared to be against the public policy of the states
 of New York and New Jersey and to be unlawful for any person to load  or
 unload waterborne freight onto or from vehicles other than railroad cars
 at  piers  or  at other waterfront terminals within the port of New York
 A. 9644  145
 
 district, for a fee or other  compensation,  other  than  the  following
 persons and their employees:
  (a)  Carriers  of  freight  by water, but only at piers at which their
 vessels are berthed;
  (b) Other carriers of freight (including but not limited to  railroads
 and  truckers), but only in connection with freight transported or to be
 transported by such carriers;
  (c) Operators of piers or other waterfront terminals (including  rail-
 roads,  truck  terminal  operators, warehousemen and other persons), but
 only at piers or other waterfront terminals operated by them;
  (d) Shippers or consignees of freight, but  only  in  connection  with
 freight shipped by such shipper or consigned to such consignee;
  (e)  Stevedores  licensed  under  section three thousand eight of this
 part whether or not such waterborne freight has been or is to be  trans-
 ported  by a carrier of freight by water with which such stevedore shall
 have a contract of the type prescribed by paragraph (d) of subdivision 3
 of section three thousand seven of this part.
  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to permit any such loading or
 unloading of any waterborne freight at any place by any such  person  by
 means  of  any  independent contractor, or any other agent other than an
 employee, unless such independent contractor is a  person  permitted  by
 this  section  to  load  or unload such freight at such place in his own
 right.
  §  3009.  Longshoremen.  1.  The  commission  shall  establish  a
 longshoremen's  register  in which shall be included all qualified long-
 shoremen eligible, as hereinafter provided, for employment  as  such  in
 the  port  of  New York district. On or after the first day of December,
 nineteen hundred fifty-three, no person  shall  act  as  a  longshoreman
 within  the  port of New York district unless at the time he is included
 in the longshoremen's register, and no person shall  employ  another  to
 work  as  a  longshoreman within the port of New York district unless at
 the time such other person is included in the longshoremen's register.
  2. Any person applying for inclusion in  the  longshoremen's  register
 shall  file  at  such  place  and in such manner as the commission shall
 designate a written statement,  signed  and  verified  by  such  person,
 setting  forth his full name, residence address, social security number,
 and such further facts and evidence as the commission may  prescribe  to
 establish the identity of such person and his criminal record, if any.
  3. The commission may in its discretion deny application for inclusion
 in the longshoremen's register by a person
  (a)  Who  has  been  convicted  by a court of the United States or any
 state or territory  thereof,  without  subsequent  pardon,  of  treason,
 murder,  manslaughter  or of any felony or high misdemeanor or of any of
 the misdemeanors or offenses described in paragraph (b)  of  subdivision
 three  of  section  three  thousand  six  of  this part or of attempt or
 conspiracy to commit any of such crimes;
  (b) Who knowingly or willingly advocates  the  desirability  of  over-
 throwing  or  destroying the government of the United States by force or
 violence or who shall be a member of a group which advocates such desir-
 ability knowing the purposes of such group include such advocacy;
  (c) Whose presence at the piers or other waterfront terminals  in  the
 port of New York district is found by the commission on the basis of the
 facts and evidence before it, to constitute a danger to the public peace
 or safety.
  4. Unless the commission shall determine to exclude the applicant from
 the  longshoremen's  register on a ground set forth in subdivision three
 A. 9644  146
 
 of this section it shall  include  such  person  in  the  longshoremen's
 register. The commission may permit temporary registration of any appli-
 cant  under  the  provisions  of this section pending final action on an
 application made for such registration.  Any such temporary registration
 shall be valid for a period not in excess of thirty days.
  5.  The  commission  shall  have  power  to reprimand any longshoreman
 registered under this section or to remove him from  the  longshoremen's
 register  for such period of time as it deems in the public interest for
 any of any following offenses:
  (a) Conviction of a crime or other cause which would permit  disquali-
 fication  of  such  person from inclusion in the longshoremen's register
 upon original application;
  (b) Fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in securing  inclusion  in  the
 longshoremen's register;
  (c) Transfer or surrender of possession to any person either temporar-
 ily  or  permanently of any card or other means of identification issued
 by the commission as evidence of inclusion in the longshoremen's  regis-
 ter, without satisfactory explanation;
  (d)  False impersonation of another longshoreman registered under this
 article or of another person licensed under this compact;
  (e) Wilful commission of or wilful attempt to commit at or on a water-
 front terminal or adjacent highway any act of  physical  injury  to  any
 other  person  or  of  wilful damage to or misappropriation of any other
 person's property, unless justified or excused by law;  and
  (f) Any other offense described in subdivisions (c) to  (f)  inclusive
 of subdivision seven of section three thousand six of this part.
  6.  The  commission  shall have the right to recover possession of any
 card or other means of identification issued as evidence of inclusion in
 the longshoremen's register in the event that  the  holder  thereof  has
 been removed from the longshoremen's register.
  7.  Nothing  contained  in this article shall be construed to limit in
 any way any rights of labor reserved by section three  thousand  sixteen
 of this part.
  §  3010.  Regularization  of longshoremen's employment. 1. On or after
 the first day of December, nineteen hundred fifty-four,  the  commission
 shall, at regular intervals, remove from the longshoremen's register any
 person  who  shall have been registered for at least nine months and who
 shall have failed during the preceding six  calendar  months  either  to
 have  worked  as  a  longshoreman in the port of New York district or to
 have applied for employment as a longshoreman at an employment  informa-
 tion  center  established  under section three thousand thirteen of this
 part for such minimum number of days as shall have been  established  by
 the commission pursuant to subdivision two of this section.
  2. On or before the first day of June, nineteen hundred fifty-four and
 on  or before each succeeding first day of June or December, the commis-
 sion shall, for the purposes of subdivision one of this section,  estab-
 lish  for  the  six-month  period  beginning on each such date a minimum
 number of days and the distribution of such days during such period.
  3. In establishing any such minimum number  of  days  or  period,  the
 commission shall observe the following standards:
  (a)  To  encourage  as  far  as  practicable the regularization of the
 employment of longshoremen;
  (b) To bring the number of eligible  longshoremen  more  closely  into
 balance  with  the demand for longshoremen's services within the port of
 New York district without reducing the number of  eligible  longshoremen
 A. 9644  147
 
 below  that  necessary  to  meet the requirements of longshoremen in the
 port of New York district;
  (c)  To eliminate oppressive and evil hiring practices affecting long-
 shoremen and waterborne commerce in the port of New York district;
  (d) To eliminate unlawful practices  injurious  to  waterfront  labor;
 and
  (e) To establish hiring practices and conditions which will permit the
 termination  of governmental regulation and intervention at the earliest
 opportunity.
  4. A longshoreman who has been removed from the longshoremen's  regis-
 ter  pursuant to this section may seek reinstatement upon fulfilling the
 same requirements as for initial inclusion in the longshoremen's  regis-
 ter, but not before the expiration of one year from the date of removal,
 except  that  immediate  reinstatement shall be made upon proper showing
 that the registrant's failure to work or  apply  for  work  the  minimum
 number  of  days  above described was caused by the fact that the regis-
 trant was engaged in the military service of the United  States  or  was
 incapacitated by ill health, physical injury, or other good cause.
  5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission
 shall at any time have the power to register longshoremen on a temporary
 basis to meet special or emergency needs.
  § 3011. Port watchmen. 1. On or after the first day of December, nine-
 teen  hundred fifty-three, no person shall act as a port watchman within
 the port of New York district without first having  obtained  a  license
 from  the  commission, and no person shall employ a port watchman who is
 not so licensed.
  2. A license to act as a port watchman shall be issued only upon writ-
 ten application, duly verified, which shall state the following:
  (a) The full name, residence, business address  (if  any),  place  and
 date of birth and social security number of the applicant;
  (b)  The  present and previous occupations of the applicant, including
 the places where he was employed and the names of his employers;
  (c) The citizenship of the applicant and, if he is a naturalized citi-
 zen of the United States, the court and date of his naturalization;  and
  (d) Such further facts and evidence as may be required by the  commis-
 sion  to  ascertain  the character, integrity and identity of the appli-
 cant.
  3. No such license shall be granted
  (a) Unless the  commission  shall  be  satisfied  that  the  applicant
 possesses good character and integrity;
  (b) If the applicant has, without subsequent pardon, been convicted by
 a court of the United States or of any state or territory thereof of the
 commission  of, or the attempt or conspiracy to commit, treason, murder,
 manslaughter or any felony or high misdemeanor or any of  the  misdemea-
 nors  or  offenses  described  in  paragraph (b) of subdivision three of
 section three thousand six of this part;
  (c) Unless the applicant shall meet such reasonable standards of phys-
 ical and mental fitness for the discharge of his duties as may from time
 to time be established by the commission;
  (d) If the applicant shall be a member of any labor organization which
 represents longshoremen or pier superintendents or  hiring  agents;  but
 nothing  in  this section shall be deemed to prohibit port watchmen from
 being represented by a labor organization or organizations which do  not
 also  represent  longshoremen  or pier superintendents or hiring agents.
 The American Federation of Labor, the Congress of  Industrial  Organiza-
 tions  and  any other similar federation, congress or other organization
 A. 9644  148
 
 of national or international occupational or industrial labor  organiza-
 tions  shall  not  be  considered an organization which represents long-
 shoremen or pier superintendents or hiring agents within the meaning  of
 this  article  although one of the federated or constituent labor organ-
 izations thereof may represent longshoremen or pier  superintendents  or
 hiring agents;
  (e)  If the applicant knowingly or wilfully advocates the desirability
 of overthrowing or destroying the government of  the  United  States  by
 force  or  violence or shall be a member of a group which advocates such
 desirability, knowing the purposes of such group include such advocacy.
  4. When the application shall have  been  examined  and  such  further
 inquiry  and  investigation made as the commission shall deem proper and
 when the commission shall be  satisfied  therefrom  that  the  applicant
 possesses the qualifications and requirements prescribed by this section
 and  regulations issued pursuant thereto, the commission shall issue and
 deliver a license to the applicant.  The commission may issue  a  tempo-
 rary  permit to any applicant for a license under the provisions of this
 section pending final action on an application made for such a  license.
 Any  such  permit  shall  be  valid for a period not in excess of thirty
 days.
  5. A license granted pursuant to this section  shall  continue  for  a
 term  of  three  years.  A license may be renewed by the commission for
 successive three-year periods upon fulfilling the same  requirements  as
 are set forth in this section for an original application.
  6.  Any  license  issued  pursuant  to  this section may be revoked or
 suspended for such period as the commission deems in the public interest
 or the licensee thereunder may be reprimanded for any of  the  following
 offenses:
  (a) Conviction of a crime or other cause which would permit or require
 his disqualification from receiving a license upon original application;
  (b) Fraud, deceit or misrepresentation in securing the license;  and
  (c)  Any  other  offense  described  in  subdivisions (c) through (i),
 inclusive, of subdivision seven of section three thousand  six  of  this
 part.
  §  3012.  Hearings, determinations and review. 1. The commission shall
 not deny any application for a license or  registration  without  giving
 the  applicant  or  prospective  licensee reasonable prior notice and an
 opportunity to be heard.
  2.  Any  application  for  a  license  or  for  inclusion  in  the
 longshoremen's  register,  and  any license issued or registration made,
 may be denied, revoked, cancelled, suspended as the case may be, only in
 the manner prescribed in this section.
  3. The commission may on its own initiative or  on  complaint  of  any
 person,  including  any public official or agency, institute proceedings
 to revoke, cancel or suspend any license or registration after a hearing
 at which the licensee or registrant and any person making such complaint
 shall be given an opportunity to be heard, provided that  any  order  of
 the  commission revoking, cancelling or suspending any license or regis-
 tration shall not become effective until fifteen days subsequent to  the
 serving  of notice thereof upon the licensee or registrant unless in the
 opinion of the commission the continuance of the license or registration
 for such period would be inimicable to the public peace or safety.  Such
 hearings shall be held in such manner and upon such  notice  as  may  be
 prescribed  by  the rules of the commission, but such notice shall be of
 not less than ten days and shall state the nature of the complaint.
 A. 9644  149
 
  4. Pending the determination of such hearing pursuant  to  subdivision
 three  of  this section the commission may temporarily suspend a license
 or registration if in the opinion of the commission the  continuance  of
 the  license or registration for such period is inimicable to the public
 peace or safety.
  5.  The  commission, or such member, officer, employee or agent of the
 commission as may be designated by  the  commission  for  such  purpose,
 shall  have  the  power  to  issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of
 witnesses and the giving of testimony or production  of  other  evidence
 and to administer oaths in connection with any such hearing. It shall be
 the  duty  of the commission or of any such member, officer, employee or
 agent of the commission designated by the commission for such purpose to
 issue subpoenas at the request of  and  upon  behalf  of  the  licensee,
 registrant  or  applicant.  The commission or such person conducting the
 hearing shall not be bound by common law or statutory rules of  evidence
 or  by  technical  or  formal  rules of procedure in the conduct of such
 hearing.
  6. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall take  such
 action upon such findings and determination as it deems proper and shall
 execute  an order carrying such findings into effect.  The action in the
 case of an application for a license or registration shall be the grant-
 ing or denial thereof.  The action in the case of a  licensee  shall  be
 revocation  of  the  license or suspension thereof for a fixed period or
 reprimand or a dismissal of the charges.  The action in the  case  of  a
 registered  longshoreman shall be dismissal of the charges, reprimand or
 removal from the longshoremen's register for a fixed  period  or  perma-
 nently.
  7.  The  action  of  the  commission  in denying any application for a
 license or in refusing to  include  any  person  in  the  longshoremen's
 register under this compact or in suspending or revoking such license or
 removing  any person from the longshoremen's register or in reprimanding
 a licensee or registrant shall  be  subject  to  judicial  review  by  a
 proceeding  instituted in either state at the instance of the applicant,
 licensee or registrant in the manner provided by the law of  such  state
 for review of the final decision or action of administrative agencies of
 such  state, provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
 of law the court shall have power to stay for not more than thirty  days
 an  order of the commission suspending or revoking a license or removing
 a longshoreman from the longshoremen's register.
  § 3013. Employment information centers. 1. The states of New York  and
 New  Jersey  hereby  find  and  declare that the method of employment of
 longshoremen and port watchmen in the port of New York district, common-
 ly known as the  "shape-up",  has  resulted  in  vicious  and  notorious
 abuses,  of which such employees have been the principal victims.  There
 is compelling evidence that the "shape-up" has permitted and  encouraged
 extortion  from  employees as the price of securing or retaining employ-
 ment and has subjected such employees to threats of violence,  unwilling
 joinder  in  unauthorized  labor disturbances and criminal activities on
 the waterfront.  The "shape-up" has thus resulted in a loss of fundamen-
 tal rights and liberties of labor, has impaired the  economic  stability
 of  the  port of New York district and weakened law enforcement therein.
 It is the sense of the legislatures of the states of New  York  and  New
 Jersey that these practices and conditions must be eliminated to prevent
 grave  injury to the welfare of waterfront laborers and of the people at
 large and that the elimination of the "shape-up" and  the  establishment
 A. 9644  150
 
 of  a  system  of  employment  information  centers  are  necessary to a
 solution of these public problems.
  2.  The commission shall establish and maintain one or more employment
 information centers in each state within the port of New  York  district
 at  such  locations  as it may determine.  No person shall, directly or
 indirectly, hire any person for work as a longshoreman or port  watchman
 within  the  port  of  New York district, except through such particular
 employment information center or centers as may  be  prescribed  by  the
 commission.  No person shall accept any employment as a longshoreman or
 port watchman within the port of New York district, except through  such
 an  employment  information center.  At each such employment information
 center the commission shall keep and exhibit the longshoremen's register
 and any other records it shall determine to the  end  that  longshoremen
 and  port  watchmen  shall  have the maximum information as to available
 employment as such at any time within the port of New York district  and
 to  the  end  that  employers shall have an adequate opportunity to fill
 their requirements of registered longshoremen and port watchmen  at  all
 times.
  3.  Every employer of longshoremen or port watchmen within the port of
 New York district shall furnish such information as may be  required  by
 the  rules  and  regulations prescribed by the commission with regard to
 the name of each person hired as a longshoreman or  port  watchman,  the
 time  and  place  of  hiring, the time, place and hours of work, and the
 compensation therefor.
  4. All wage payments to longshoremen or port watchmen for work as such
 shall be made by check or cash evidenced by a written voucher  receipted
 by  the person to whom such cash is paid. The commission may arrange for
 the provision of facilities for cashing such checks.
  § 3014. Expenses  of  administration.  1.  By  concurrent  legislation
 enacted  by  their  respective  legislatures, the two states may provide
 from time to time for meeting the commission's expenses.  Until  other
 provision shall be made, such expense shall be met as authorized in this
 section.
  2.  The  commission  shall annually adopt a budget of its expenses for
 each year.  Each budget shall be submitted to the governors of  the  two
 states  and shall take effect as submitted provided that either governor
 may within thirty days disapprove or reduce any item or items,  and  the
 budget shall be adjusted accordingly.
  3. After taking into account such funds as may be available to it from
 reserves,  federal  grants or otherwise, the balance of the commission's
 budgeted expenses shall be assessed upon employers of persons registered
 or licensed under this compact. Each such  employer  shall  pay  to  the
 commission  as  assessment computed upon the gross payroll payments made
 by such employer to longshoremen, pier  superintendents,  hiring  agents
 and  port  watchmen  for  work or labor performed within the port of New
 York district, at a rate, not in excess of two per cent, computed by the
 commission in the following manner; the commission shall annually  esti-
 mate  the  gross  payroll  payments  to  be made by employers subject to
 assessment and shall compute a rate thereon which  will  yield  revenues
 sufficient to finance the commission's budget for each year.  Such budg-
 et  may  include a reasonable amount for a reserve but such amount shall
 not exceed ten per cent of the total of all other items  of  expenditure
 contained  therein.  Such reserve shall be used for the stabilization of
 annual assessments, the payment of operating deficits and for the repay-
 ment of advances made by the two states.
 A. 9644  151
 
  4. The amount required to balance the commission's budget,  in  excess
 of  the estimated yield of the maximum assessment, shall be certified by
 the commission, with the approval of the respective  governors,  to  the
 legislatures  of  the two states, in proportion to the gross annual wage
 payments  made to longshoremen for work in each state within the port of
 New York district.  The legislatures shall annually appropriate  to  the
 commission the amount so certified.
  5.  The  commission  may  provide by regulation for the collection and
 auditing of assessments.  Such assessments hereunder  shall  be  payable
 pursuant  to such provisions for administration, collection and enforce-
 ment as the states may provide by concurrent legislation.  In  addition
 to  any  other  sanction  provided  by law, the commission may revoke or
 suspend any license held by any person under this compact, or his privi-
 lege of employing persons registered or licensed hereunder, for non-pay-
 ment of any assessment when due.
  6. The assessment hereunder shall be in lieu of any other  charge  for
 the  issuance  of  licenses  to stevedores, pier superintendents, hiring
 agents and pier watchmen or for the registration of longshoremen or  the
 use of an employment information center.  The commission shall establish
 reasonable  procedures  for  the  consideration  of protests by affected
 employers concerning the  estimates  and  computation  of  the  rate  of
 assessment.
  §  3015.  General violations; prosecutions; penalties.  1. The failure
 of any witness, when  duly  subpoenaed  to  attend,  give  testimony  or
 produce other evidence, whether or not at a hearing, shall be punishable
 by the superior court in New Jersey and the supreme court in New York in
 the  same  manner  as said failure is punishable by such court in a case
 therein pending.
  2. Any person who, having been sworn or affirmed as a witness  in  any
 such  hearing, shall wilfully give false testimony or who shall wilfully
 make or file any false or fraudulent report  or  statement  required  by
 this compact to be made or filed under oath, shall be guilty of a misde-
 meanor,  punishable  by  a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or
 imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
  3. Any person who violates or attempts or  conspires  to  violate  any
 other  provision  of this compact shall be punishable as may be provided
 by the two states by action of the legislature of either state concurred
 in by the legislature of the other.
  4. Any person who interferes with or impedes the orderly  registration
 of longshoremen pursuant to this compact or who conspires to or attempts
 to interfere with or impede such registration shall be punishable as may
 be  provided  by  the  two states by action of the legislature of either
 state concurred in by the legislature of the other.
  5. Any person who directly or  indirectly  inflicts  or  threatens  to
 inflict  any  injury,  damage, harm or loss or in any other manner prac-
 tices intimidation upon or against any person  in  order  to  induce  or
 compel  such  person  or  any  other  person to refrain from registering
 pursuant to this compact shall be punishable as may be provided  by  the
 two  states by action of the legislature of either state concurred in by
 the legislature of the other.
  6. In any prosecution under this compact, it shall  be  sufficient  to
 prove  only a single act (or a single holding out or attempt) prohibited
 by law, without having to prove a general course of conduct, in order to
 prove a violation.
  § 3016. Collective bargaining safeguarded.  1. This  compact  is  not
 designed  and  shall  not  be  construed  to limit in any way any rights
 A. 9644  152
 
 granted or derived from any other statute or any rule of law for employ-
 ees to organize in labor organizations, to bargain collectively  and  to
 act  in  any  other  way  individually,  collectively, and through labor
 organizations  or  other representatives of their own choosing.  Without
 limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  nothing  contained  in  this
 compact shall be construed to limit in any way the right of employees to
 strike.
  2. This compact is not designed and shall not be construed to limit in
 any  way any rights of longshoremen, hiring agents, pier superintendents
 or port watchmen or their employers to bargain  collectively  and  agree
 upon any method for the selection of such employees by way of seniority,
 experience,  regular  gangs  or  otherwise, provided that such employees
 shall be licensed or registered hereunder and such longshoremen and port
 watchmen shall be hired only through the employment information  centers
 established  hereunder  and that all other provisions of this compact be
 observed.
  § 3017. Amendments; construction; short  title.  1.  Amendments  and
 supplements  to  this  compact  to implement the purposes thereof may be
 adopted by the action of the legislature of either state concurred in by
 the legislature of the other.
  2. If any part or provision of this compact or the application thereof
 to any person or circumstances be  adjudged  invalid  by  any  court  of
 competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation
 to  the  part, provision or application directly involved in the contro-
 versy in which such judgment shall have  been  rendered  and  shall  not
 affect  or  impair  the validity of the remainder of this compact or the
 application thereof to other persons or circumstances and the two states
 hereby declare that they would have entered into  this  compact  or  the
 remainder  thereof  had  the invalidity of such provision or application
 thereof been apparent.
  3. In accordance with the ordinary rules for  construction  of  inter-
 state  compacts  this  compact shall be liberally construed to eliminate
 the evils described therein and to effectuate the purposes thereof.

  §  3101.  Waterfront commission compact.  This compact shall be known
 and may be cited as the "Waterfront Commission Compact."
  § 3102. Expenses of administration.  1. Every person  subject  to  the
 payment  of  any assessment under the provisions of subdivision three of
 section three thousand fourteen of this article shall file on or  before
 the  fifteenth  day  of  the first month of each calendar quarter-year a
 separate return, together with the payment of the  assessment  due,  for
 the  preceding  calendar  quarter-year during which any payroll payments
 were made to longshoremen, pier superintendents, hiring agents  or  port
 watchmen for work performed as such within the district.  Returns cover-
 ing  the amount of assessment payable shall be filed with the commission
 on forms to be furnished for such purpose and shall contain  such  data,
 information or matter as the commission may require to be included ther-
 ein.  The commission may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing
 returns,  or  for the payment of assessment, whenever good cause exists.
 Every return shall have annexed thereto a certification  to  the  effect
 that the statements contained therein are true.
  2.  Every  person subject to the payment of assessment hereunder shall
 keep an accurate record of his employment of longshoremen,  pier  super-
 intendents,  hiring agents or port watchmen, which shall show the amount
 of compensation paid and such other information as  the  commission  may
 require.  Such  records shall be preserved for a period of three years
 and be open for inspection at reasonable  times.  The  commission  may
 consent  to  the  destruction of any such records at any time after said
 period or may require that they be kept longer, but not in excess of six
 years.
  3. (a) The commission shall audit and determine the amount of  assess-
 ment  due  from the return filed and such other information as is avail-
 able to it.  Whenever a deficiency in  payment  of  the  assessment  is
 determined the commission shall give notice of any such determination to
 the  person  liable  therefor.  Such  determination  shall finally and
 conclusively fix the amount due, unless the person against  whom  it  is
 assessed  shall,  within  thirty days after the giving of notice of such
 determination, apply in writing to the  commission  for  a  hearing,  or
 unless  the  commission  on its own motion shall reduce the same.  After
 such hearing, the commission shall give notice of its  decision  to  the
 person  liable  therefor.  A determination of the commission under this
 section shall be subject to judicial review,  if  application  for  such
 review  is  made  within  thirty days after the giving of notice of such
 decision.  Any determination under this section  shall  be  made  within
 five years from the time the return was filed and if no return was filed
 such determination may be made at any time.
  (b)  Any notice authorized or required under this section may be given
 by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended  at  the  last
 address  given  by him to the commission, or in the last return filed by
 him with the commission under this section, or, if no  return  has  been
 A. 9644  154

 filed  then  to  such address as may be obtainable.  The mailing of such
 notice shall be presumptive evidence of  the  receipt  of  same  by  the
 person  to  whom  addressed.  Any  period of time, which is determined
 according  to  the  provision  of this section, for the giving of notice
 shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
  4. Whenever any person shall fail to  pay,  within  the  time  limited
 herein,  any  assessment  which  he is required to pay to the commission
 under the provisions of this section the commission may enforce  payment
 of  such  fee  by  civil  action  for the amount of such assessment with
 interest and penalties.
  5. The employment by a nonresident of a longshoreman,  or  a  licensed
 pier  superintendent,  hiring  agent or port watchman in either state or
 the designation by a nonresident of a longshoreman, pier superintendent,
 hiring agent or port watchman to perform work in  such  state  shall  be
 deemed equivalent to an appointment by such nonresident of the secretary
 of  state of such state to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may
 be served the process in any action or proceeding  against  him  growing
 out  of  any  liability  for  assessments,  penalties or interest, and a
 consent that any such process against him which is so served shall be of
 the same legal force and validity as if served on him personally  within
 such  state  and  within  the territorial jurisdiction of the court from
 which the process issues.  Service of process within either state  shall
 be  made  by  either  (1)  personally delivering to and leaving with the
 secretary of state or a deputy secretary of state of such  state  dupli-
 cate  copies  thereof  at  the  office of the department of state in the
 capitol city of such state, in which event such secretary of state shall
 forthwith send by registered mail one of such copies to  the  person  at
 the  last  address  designated  by him to the commission for any purpose
 under this section or in the last return filed by him under this section
 with the commission or as shown on the records of the commission, or  if
 no  return  has  been filed, at  his last known office address within or
 without such state, or (2) personally delivering to and leaving with the
 secretary of state or a deputy secretary of state of such state  a  copy
 thereof  at the office of the department of state in the capitol city of
 such state and by delivering a copy thereof to  the  person,  personally
 without  such state.  Proof of such personal service without such state
 shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which the process is pend-
 ing within thirty days after such service  and  such  service  shall  be
 complete ten days after proof thereof is filed.
  6. Whenever the commission shall determine that any moneys received as
 assessments  were  paid  in error, it may cause the same to be refunded,
 provided an application therefor is filed with the commission within two
 years from the time the erroneous payment was made.
  7. In addition to any other powers authorized hereunder,  the  commis-
 sion shall have power to make reasonable rules and regulations to effec-
 tuate the purposes of this section.
  8. When any person shall wilfully fail to pay any assessment due here-
 under  he shall be assessed interest at a rate of one per cent per month
 on the amount due and unpaid and penalties  of  five  per  cent  of  the
 amount  due  for  each  thirty  days or part thereof that the assessment
 remains unpaid.  The commission, may, for good cause shown, abate all or
 part of such penalty.
  9. Any person who shall wilfully furnish false or fraudulent  informa-
 tion  or  shall  wilfully  fail  to  furnish  pertinent  information, as
 required, with respect to the amount of assessment due, shall be  guilty
 A. 9644  155
 
 of  a  misdemeanor,  punishable  by a fine of not more than one thousand
 dollars, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
  10. All funds of the commission shall be deposited with such responsi-
 ble  banks  or  trust  companies as may be designated by the commission.
 The commission may require that all such deposits be  secured  by  obli-
 gations  of the United States or of the states of New York or New Jersey

 notice  to  the appropriate attorney general of the state of New York or
 the state of New Jersey, and to the  appropriate  district  attorney  or
 prosecutor having an official interest therein, by the unanimous vote of
 A. 9644  158

 the provisions of subdivision three of section three  thousand  four  of
 this  article,  that  such  person  answer  the  question or produce the

 or  produce evidence of any other kind and complies with such order, and

 for  less  than  nine  months) who shall have failed to have worked as a
 longshoreman in the port of New York district for such minimum number of
 days during a period of time as  shall  have  been  established  by  the
 commission.  In  administering  this  section,  the  commission,  in its
 discretion, may count applications for employment as a  longshoreman  at
 an  employment  information center established under section three thou-
 sand thirteen of this article as constituting actual  work  as  a  long-
 shoreman,  provided,  however, that the commission shall count as actual
 work the compensation received by any longshoreman pursuant to the guar-
 anteed wage provisions of any collective bargaining  agreement  relating
 to  longshoremen. Prior to the commencement of any period of time estab-
 lished by the commission pursuant to this section, the commission  shall
 establish  for  such  period the minimum number of days of work required
 and the distribution of such days during  such  period  and  shall  also
 determine  whether  or  not application for employment as a longshoreman
 shall be counted as constituting actual  work  as  a  longshoreman.  The
 commission may classify longshoremen according to length of service as a
 longshoreman  and such other criteria as may be reasonable and necessary
 to carry out the provisions of this part.  The commission shall have the
 power to vary the requirements of this section  with  respect  to  their
 application  to the various classifications of longshoremen. In adminis-
 tering this section, the commission  shall  observe  the  standards  set
 forth  in  section  thirty-one hundred eighteen of this part. Nothing in
 this section shall be construed to modify, limit or restrict in any  way
 any  of the rights protected by article XV of the compact established by
 part I of this article.
  § 3109. Additional violations.  Any person who, having been duly sworn
 or affirmed as a  witness  in  any  investigation,  interview  or  other

 this part, shall wilfully give false testimony  shall  be  guilty  of  a
 misdemeanor  punishable  by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars
 or imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
  § 3110. Hearings.  1. At hearings conducted by the commission pursuant
 to section three thousand twelve of this article,  applicants,  prospec-
 tive  licensees,  licensees  and  registrants shall have the right to be
 accompanied and represented by counsel.
  2. After the conclusion of a hearing but prior to  the  making  of  an
 order  by  the  commission,  a  hearing  may,  upon  petition and in the
 discretion of the hearing officer, be reopened for the  presentation  of
 A. 9644  160

 additional evidence.  Such petition to reopen the hearing shall state in
 detail  the nature of the additional evidence, together with the reasons
 for the failure to submit such evidence prior to the conclusion  of  the
 hearing.  The  commission  may upon its own motion and upon reasonable
 notice reopen a hearing for the presentation of additional evidence.
  Upon petition, after the making of an order of the commission, rehear-
 ing may be granted in the discretion of the commission.  Such a petition
 for rehearing shall state in detail the grounds upon which the  petition
 is  based  and  shall  separately  set  forth each error of law and fact
 alleged to have been  made  by  the  commission  in  its  determination,
 together with the facts and arguments in support thereof.  Such petition
 shall  be  filed  with  the  commission not later than thirty days after
 service of such order, unless the commission for good cause shown  shall
 otherwise direct.
  The  commission  may  upon  its own motion grant a rehearing after the
 making of an order.
  § 3111. Denial of applications.  In addition to the grounds  elsewhere

 section,  the  commission  shall  include  the  applicant  in  the
 longshoremen's  register as a checker.  The commission may permit tempo-
 rary registration as a checker to any applicant under this section pend-

 such  terms  and conditions as the commission may prescribe, which shall
 be valid for a period to be fixed by the commission, not  in  excess  of

 under  this section or to remove him from the longshoremen's register as
 a checker for such period of time as it deems in the public interest for

 give  to  any  person  any  valuable  consideration to induce such other
 person to violate any provision of the compact or to induce  any  public
 officer,  agent  or  employee  to  fail  to  perform  his duty under the

 thereof has been removed from the longshoremen's register as a checker.
  7. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed  to  limit  in
 any  way  any  rights of labor reserved by section three thousand six of
 this article.
  § 3117. Supplementary violations.  Any person who, without  justifica-
 tion  or  excuse  in law, directly or indirectly intimidates or inflicts
 any injury, damage, harm, loss or  economic  reprisal  upon  any  person
 licensed  or  registered  by  the  commission,  or  any other person, or
 attempts, conspires or threatens so to do, in order to  interfere  with,
 impede  or  influence such licensed or registered person in the perform-
 ance or discharge of his duties or obligations shall  be  punishable  as
 provided in section thirty-one hundred four of this part.
  §  3118.  Suspension  of  acceptance  of applications for inclusion in
 longshoremen's register; exceptions. 1. The commission  shall  have  the
 power  to  make  determinations to suspend the acceptance of application
 for inclusion in the longshoremen's register for such periods of time as
 the commission may from time to time establish and, after any such peri-
 od of suspension, the commission shall have the power to  make  determi-
 nations to accept applications for such period of time as the commission
 may  establish  or  in  such  number as the commission may determine, or
 both. Such determinations to suspend or  accept  applications  shall  be
 made  by the commission: (a) on its own initiative or (b) upon the joint
 recommendation in writing of stevedores and  other  employers  of  long-
 shoremen  in  the port of New York district, acting through their repre-
 sentative for the purpose of collective bargaining with a  labor  organ-
 ization  representing  such longshoremen in such district and such labor
 organization or (c) upon the petition  in  writing  of  a  stevedore  or
 another  employer of longshoremen in the port of New York district which
 does not have a representative for the purpose of collective  bargaining
 with a labor organization representing such longshoremen. The commission
 shall  have  the  power to accept or reject such joint recommendation or
 petition.
  All joint recommendations or petitions filed  for  the  acceptance  of
 applications  with  the  commission  for inclusion in the longshoremen's
 register shall include:
  (a) the number of employees requested;
  (b) the category or categories of employees requested;
  (c) a detailed statement setting forth  the  reasons  for  said  joint
 recommendation or petition;
  (d)  in cases where a joint recommendation is made under this section,
 the collective bargaining representative of stevedores and other employ-
 A. 9644  165

 ers of longshoremen in the port of  New  York  district  and  the  labor
 organization representing such longshoremen shall provide the allocation
 of  the number of persons to be sponsored by each employer of longshore-
 men in the port of New York district; and
  (e) any other information requested by the commission.
  2.  In  administering  the  provisions of this section, the commission
 shall observe the following standards:
  (a) To encourage as far  as  practicable  the  regularization  of  the
 employment of longshoremen;
  (b) To bring the number of eligible longshoremen into balance with the
 demand  for longshoremen's services within the port of New York district
 without reducing the number of eligible longshoremen below  that  neces-
 sary  to  meet  the requirements of longshoremen in the port of New York
 district;
  (c) To encourage the mobility and full  utilization  of  the  existing
 work force of longshoremen;
  (d)  To  protect  the job security of the existing work force of long-
 shoremen by considering the wages and employment benefits of prospective
 registrants;
  (e) To eliminate oppressive and evil  hiring  practices  injurious  to
 waterfront  labor  and  waterborne  commerce  in  the  port  of New York
 district, including, but not  limited  to,  those  oppressive  and  evil
 hiring  practices  that  may result from either a surplus or shortage of
 waterfront labor;
  (f) To consider the effect of technological change and automation  and
 such  other economic data and facts as are relevant to a proper determi-
 nation;
  (g) To protect the public interest of the port of New York district.
  In observing the foregoing standards and before determining to suspend
 or accept applications for inclusion in the longshoremen's register, the
 commission shall consult with and consider the views of,  including  any
 statistical data or other factual information concerning the size of the
 longshoremen's  register  submitted  by,  carriers  of freight by water,
 stevedores, waterfront terminal owners and operators, any  labor  organ-
 ization  representing  employees  registered  by the commission, and any
 other person whose  interests  may  be  affected  by  the  size  of  the
 longshoremen's register.
  Any  joint  recommendation  or  petition  granted  hereunder  shall be
 subject to such terms and conditions as the commission may prescribe.
  3. Any determination by the commission pursuant  to  this  section  to
 suspend  or  accept  applications  for  inclusion  in the longshoremen's
 register shall be made upon a record, shall not become  effective  until
 five  days  after  notice thereof to the collective bargaining represen-
 tative of stevedores and other employers of longshoremen in the port  of
 New  York district and to the labor organization representing such long-
 shoremen and/or the petitioning stevedore or  other  employer  of  long-
 shoremen  in the port of New York district and shall be subject to judi-
 cial review for being arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of  discretion
 in a proceeding jointly instituted by such representative and such labor
 organization  and/or  by  the petitioning stevedore or other employer of
 longshoremen in the port of New  York  district.  Such  judicial  review
 proceeding  may  be instituted in either state in the manner provided by
 the law of such state for review of the  final  decision  or  action  of
 administrative  agencies  of  such  state,  provided, however, that such
 proceeding shall be decided directly by the appellate  division  as  the
 court of first instance (to which the proceeding shall be transferred by
 A. 9644  166
 
 order  of  transfer  by the supreme court in the state of New York or in
 the state of New Jersey by notice of appeal from the commission's deter-
 mination) and provided further that notwithstanding any other  provision
 of  law  in  either  state no court shall have power to stay the commis-
 sion's determination prior to final  judicial  decision  for  more  than
 fifteen  days.  In the event that the court enters a final order setting
 aside the determination by the commission  to  accept  applications  for
 inclusion  in the longshoremen's register, the registration of any long-
 shoremen included in the longshoremen's register as  a  result  of  such
 determination by the commission shall be cancelled.
  This  section shall apply, notwithstanding any other provision of this
 article, provided however, such section shall not in any  way  limit  or
 restrict  the  provisions  of subdivision five of section three thousand
 ten of this article empowering the commission to  register  longshoremen
 on  a  temporary  basis  to  meet  special  or  emergency  needs  or the
 provisions of subdivision four of section three  thousand  ten  of  this
 article  relating to the immediate reinstatement of persons removed from
 the longshoremen's register pursuant to section three  thousand  ten  of
 this  article.  Nothing  in this section shall be construed to modify,
 limit or restrict in any way any of  the  rights  protected  by  section
 three thousand sixteen of this article.
  4.  Upon  the  granting  of any joint recommendation or petition under
 this section for the acceptance of applications  for  inclusion  in  the
 longshoremen's  register,  the commission shall accept applications upon
 written sponsorship from the prospective employer of  longshoremen.  The
 sponsoring  employer shall furnish the commission with the name, address
 and such other identifying or category information as the commission may
 prescribe for any person so sponsored.  The  sponsoring  employer  shall
 certify  that  the  selection  of the persons so sponsored was made in a
 fair and non-discriminatory basis in accordance with the requirements of
 the laws of the United States and the states of New York and New  Jersey
 dealing with equal employment opportunities.
  Notwithstanding  any of the foregoing, where the commission determines
 to accept applications for inclusion in the longshoremen's  register  on
 its own initiative, such acceptance shall be accomplished in such manner
 deemed appropriate by the commission.
  5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the commission
 may  include  in the longshoremen's register under such terms and condi-
 tions as the commission may prescribe:
  (a) a person issued registration on a temporary basis to meet  special
 or emergency needs who is still so registered by the commission;
  (b)  a  person defined as a longshoreman in subdivision six of section
 thirty-one hundred six of this part  who  is  employed  by  a  stevedore
 defined in paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision one of section thirty-one
 hundred  six  of  this  part  and whose employment is not subject to the
 guaranteed annual income provisions of any collective bargaining  agree-
 ment relating to longshoremen;
  (c)  no more than twenty persons issued registration limited to acting
 as scalemen pursuant to the provisions of chapter 953  of  the  laws  of
 1969  and  chapter 64 of the laws of 1982 who are still so registered by
 the commission and who are no longer employed as scalemen on the  effec-
 tive date of this subdivision;
  (d)  a person issued registration on a temporary basis as a checker to
 meet special or emergency needs who applied for such registration  prior
 to January 15, 1986 and who is still so registered by the commission;
 A. 9644  167
 
  (e)  a person issued registration on a temporary basis as a checker to
 meet special or emergency needs in accordance with a waterfront  commis-
 sion  resolution  of September 4, 1996 and who is still so registered by
 the commission;
  (f)  a  person issued registration on a temporary basis as a container
 equipment operator to meet special or emergency needs in accordance with
 a waterfront commission resolution of September 4, 1996 and who is still
 so registered by the commission; and
  (g) a person issued registration on a temporary basis as a  longshore-
 man  to  meet special or emergency needs in accordance with a waterfront
 commission resolution of September 4, 1996 and who is  still  so  regis-
 tered by the commission.
  6.  The  commission  may include in the longshoremen's register, under
 such terms and conditions  as  the  commission  may  prescribe,  persons
 issued  registration on a temporary basis as a longshoreman or a checker
 to meet special or emergency needs and who are still  so  registered  by
 the commission upon the enactment of this section.
  §  3119.  Temporary suspension of permits, licenses and registrations.
 1.  The commission may temporarily suspend  a  temporary  permit  or  a
 permanent  license  or a temporary or permanent registration pursuant to
 the provisions of subdivision four of section three thousand  twelve  of
 this  article until further order of the commission or final disposition
 of the underlying case, only where the permittee, licensee or registrant
 has been indicted for, or otherwise  charged  with,  a  crime  which  is
 equivalent  to  a  felony  in the state of New York or to a crime of the
 third, second or first degree in the state of New Jersey or  only  where
 the  permittee  or  licensee  is  a  port watchman who is charged by the
 commission pursuant to section three thousand  twelve  of  this  article
 with  misappropriating  any  other  person's property at or on a pier or
 other waterfront terminal.
  2. In the case of a permittee, licensee or  registrant  who  has  been
 indicted  for, or otherwise charged with, a crime, the temporary suspen-
 sion shall terminate immediately upon acquittal or upon dismissal of the
 criminal charge. A person whose permit, license or registration has been
 temporarily suspended may, at  any  time,  demand  that  the  commission
 conduct  a  hearing  as provided for in section three thousand twelve of
 this article.  Within sixty days of such demand,  the  commission  shall
 commence  the hearing and, within thirty days of receipt of the adminis-
 trative judge's report and recommendation, the commission shall render a
 final determination thereon; provided, however, that these time require-
 ments, shall not apply for any period of delay caused  or  requested  by
 the permittee, licensee or registrant. Upon failure of the commission to
 commence  a  hearing  or  render  a determination within the time limits
 prescribed herein, the temporary suspension of the  licensee  or  regis-
 trant  shall  immediately terminate. Notwithstanding any other provision
 of this subdivision, if a federal, state, or local law enforcement agen-
 cy or prosecutor's office shall request the suspension or  deferment  of
 any  hearing  on the ground that such a hearing would obstruct or preju-
 dice  an  investigation  or  prosecution,  the  commission  may  in  its
 discretion, postpone or defer such hearing for a time certain or indefi-
 nitely.  Any  action  by  the  commission to postpone a hearing shall be
 subject to immediate judicial review as provided in subdivision seven of
 section three thousand twelve of this article.
  3. The commission may in addition,  within  its  discretion,  bar  any
 permittee, licensee or registrant whose license or registration has been
 suspended pursuant to the provisions of subdivision one of this section,
 A. 9644  168
 
 from  any  employment by a licensed stevedore or a carrier of freight by
 water during the period of such suspension, if the  alleged  crime  that
 forms  the  basis of such suspension involves the possession with intent
 to distribute, sale, or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance
 (controlled substance) or, in New Jersey, controlled dangerous substance
 analog  (controlled substance analog), racketeering or theft from a pier
 or waterfront terminal.
  § 3120. Continuance of port watchmen's licenses.  Notwithstanding  any
 provision  of  subdivision five of section three thousand eleven of this
 article, a license to act as a port watchman shall continue and need not
 be renewed, provided the licensee shall, as required by the commission:
  1. Submit to a medical examination and meet the  physical  and  mental
 fitness  standards established by the commission pursuant to subdivision
 three of section three thousand eleven of this article;
  2. Complete a refresher course of training;  and
  3. Submit supplementary personal history information.
  § 3121. Regularization of port watchmen's employment.  The  commission
 shall, at regular intervals, cancel the license or temporary permit of a
 port  watchman  who shall have failed during the preceding twelve months
 to have worked as a port watchman in the port of  New  York  district  a
 minimum  number  of  hours as shall have been established by the commis-
 sion, except that immediate restoration of  such  license  or  temporary
 permit shall be made upon proper showing that the failure to so work was
 caused  by  the  fact  that the licensee or permittee was engaged in the
 military service of the  United  States  or  was  incapacitated  by  ill
 health, physical injury or other good cause.
  § 3122. Duration of stevedore's license.  A stevedore's license grant-
 ed pursuant to section three thousand seven of this article shall be for
 a  term  of  five  years or fraction of such five year period, and shall
 expire on the first day of December. In the event of the  death  of  the
 licensee,  if  a  natural  person,  or its termination or dissolution by
 reason of a death of a partner, if a partnership,  or  if  the  licensee
 shall  cease to be a party to any contract of the type required by para-
 graph (d) of subdivision three of section three thousand seven  of  this
 article,  the  license  shall  terminate ninety days after such event or
 upon its expiration date, whichever shall be sooner. A  license  may  be
 renewed by the commission for successive five year periods upon fulfill-
 ing  the  same  requirements  as are set forth in section three thousand
 seven of this article for an  original  application  for  a  stevedore's
 license.
  §  3123.  Implementation of telecommunications hiring system for long-
 shoremen and checkers  and  registration  of  telecommunications  system
 controller.  1.  The  commission  may  designate one of the employment
 information centers it is authorized to  establish  and  maintain  under
 section  three  thousand thirteen of this article for the implementation
 of a telecommunications hiring system  through  which  longshoremen  and
 checkers may be hired and accept employment without any personal appear-
 ance  at  said  center.  Any such telecommunications hiring system shall
 incorporate hiring and seniority agreements  between  the  employers  of
 longshoremen  and checkers and the labor organization representing long-
 shoremen and checkers in the port of New York  district,  provided  said
 agreements are not in conflict with the provisions of this part.
  2. The commission shall permit employees of the association represent-
 ing employers of longshoremen and checkers and of the labor organization
 representing longshoremen and checkers in the port of New York district,
 or  of  a  joint  board  of  such association and labor organization, to
 A. 9644  169
 
 participate in the operation of said telecommunications  hiring  system,
 provided  that  any  such  employee is registered by the commission as a
 "telecommunications  system  controller"  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions, standards and grounds set forth in this part with respect to
 the  registration  of  checkers.  No person shall act as a "telecommuni-
 cations system controller" unless he or  she  is  so  registered.  Any
 application  for  such  registration and any registration made or issued
 may be denied, revoked, cancelled or suspended, as the case may be, only
 in the manner prescribed in section three thousand twelve of this  arti-
 cle.  Any and all such participation in the operation of said telecommu-
 nications hiring system shall be monitored by the commission.
  3.  Any  and  all  records,  documents,  tapes,  discs  and other data
 compiled, collected or maintained  by  said  association  of  employers,
 labor  organization and joint board of such association and labor organ-
 ization pertaining to the  telecommunications  hiring  system  shall  be
 available  for  inspection, investigation and duplication by the commis-
 sion.

 any labor organization which represents employees registered or licensed
 pursuant to the provisions of this article or which derives its  charter
 from  a  labor  organization  representing  one  hundred or more of such
 registered or licensed employees, if any officer, agent or  employee  of
 such  labor  organization,  or  of  a welfare fund or trust administered
 partially or entirely by such labor organization or by trustees or other
 persons designated by such labor organization, has been convicted  by  a
 court  of  the  United  States,  or any state or territory thereof, of a
 felony, any misdemeanor  involving  moral  turpitude  or  any  crime  or

 certain employees.  If upon application to the commission by an employee
 who  has been convicted of a crime or offense specified in section thir-
 ty-two hundred three of this part the  commission,  in  its  discretion,
 determines in an order that it would not be contrary to the purposes and
 objectives  of  this  article  for such employee to work in a particular
 employment for a labor organization, welfare fund or  trust  within  the
 meaning of section thirty-two hundred three of this part, the provisions
 of  section thirty-two hundred three of this part shall not apply to the

  §  3301. Compact.  The state of New York hereby agrees with the state
 of New Jersey, upon the enactment by the state of New Jersey  of  legis-
 lation having the same effect as this section, to the following compact:
  §  3302. Findings and declarations.  1. The states of New York and New
 Jersey hereby find and declare that the movement of freight through  the
 two  states  is  vital  to  their  economies  and  prosperity; that ever
 increasing amounts of such freight are being carried by the air  freight
 industry;  that  said air freight industry in the two states constitutes
 A. 9644  172
 
 an inseparable and integral unit of the  commerce  of  the  two  states;
 that  criminal  and  racketeer elements have infiltrated the air freight
 industry;  that such criminal infiltration is threatening the growth  of
 said air freight industry;  that one of the means by which such criminal
 and  racketeer elements infiltrate the air freight industry is by posing
 as labor relations consultants and that firms handling air  freight  are
 often  forced  to  employ  or engage such persons;  that the air freight
 industry is suffering an alarming rise in the amount  of  pilferage  and
 theft of air freight;  and that it is imperative to the continued growth
 and  economic  well-being  of the states of New York and New Jersey that
 every possible effective measure be taken to prevent the  pilferage  and
 theft  of  air  freight and the criminal infiltration of the air freight
 industry.
  2. The states of New York and New Jersey hereby find and declare  that
 many  of  the evils existing in the air freight industry result not only
 from the causes above described but from the lack of regulation  of  the
 air  freight  industry in and about the port of New York district;  that
 the air freight industry is affected with a  public  interest  requiring
 regulation,  just  as the states of New York and New Jersey have hereto-
 fore found and declared in respect to the shipping industry;  and  that
 such  regulation of the air freight industry shall be deemed an exercise
 of the police power of the two states for the protection of  the  public
 safety,  welfare, prosperity, health, peace and living conditions of the
 people of the states.

 consultant within the state of New York or the state of New Jersey shall
 file in the office of the commission a written application for a license
 to engage in such occupation duly signed and verified as follows:
  (a)  If  the  applicant  is a natural person, the application shall be
 signed and verified by such person and if the applicant  is  a  partner-
 ship,  the  application  shall  be  signed  and verified by each natural
 person composing or intending to compose such partnership. The  applica-
 tion  shall  state  the  full name, age, residence, business address (if

 the same, and any other facts and evidence as may  be  required  by  the
 commission  to ascertain the character, integrity, identity and criminal
 record, if any, of each natural person so signing such application.
  (b) If the applicant is a corporation, the application shall be signed

 interest as the case may be.

 section  to sign or to be identified in the application or if the person
 so signing or named in the application is an undisclosed agent or  trus-
 tee  for  any  such  real party in interest or if any such real party in
 interest does not sign the application;

 court of the United States or any state  or  territory  thereof  of  the
 commission  of,  or  the  attempt  or  conspiracy to commit any crime or
 offense described in paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section thir-
 ty-three hundred five of this  part.  Any  applicant  ineligible  for  a
 license  by  reason  of  any  such  conviction  may  submit satisfactory
 evidence to the commission that the  person  whose  conviction  was  the
 basis  of  ineligibility  has  for a period of not less than five years,
 measured as hereinafter provided and up to the time of  application,  so
 conducted  himself  as  to  warrant  the grant of such license, in which
 A. 9644  179
 
 event the commission may, in its discretion issue an order removing such
 ineligibility.  The aforesaid period of five  years  shall  be  measured
 either  from the date of payment of any fine imposed upon such person or

 from custody by parole, commutation  or  termination  of  his  sentence.
 Such  petition may be made to the commission before or after the hearing

 give to any officer or employee of any other person employing or  engag-
 ing  him  in  his  licensed  activity  any valuable consideration for an
 improper or unlawful purpose or to induce such officer  or  employee  to
 procure the employment of the applicant in his licensed activity by such
 other person;
  (e)  If, on or after the effective date of this compact, the applicant
 has paid, given, caused to have been paid, or given or offered to pay or
 give to any officer or representative of a labor organization any  valu-
 able consideration for an improper or unlawful purpose or to induce such
 officer  or  representative  to  subordinate  the interest of such labor
 organization or its members in the management of  the  affairs  of  such
 labor  organization  to  the  interests  of  the  applicant or any other
 person;
  (f) If, on or after the effective date of this compact, the  applicant
 has  paid, given, caused to have been paid or given or offered to pay or
 give to any agent of any other person any valuable consideration for  an
 improper  or  unlawful  purpose or, without the knowledge and consent of
 such other person, to induce such agent to procure the employment of the
 applicant in his licensed activity by such other person.
  4. When the application shall have  been  examined  and  such  further
 inquiry  and  investigation made as the commission shall deem proper and

 possess  the qualifications and requirements prescribed in this section,
 the commission shall issue and deliver a license to the applicant.
  5. The commission  shall  have  the  power  to  reprimand  any  person
 licensed under this section or to revoke or suspend his license for such
 period  as  the  commission  deems in the public interest for any of the
 following causes on the part of the licensee or of any  person  required
 by  subdivision  two  of  this  section  to  sign or be identified in an
 original application for a license:
  (a) Any cause set forth in subdivision five  of  section  thirty-three
 hundred five of this part;

 hours for inspection by the commission and its duly designated represen-
 tatives until the expiration of the fifth calendar  year  following  the
 calendar year during which occurred the transactions recorded therein;
  (d)  Failure  to  pay  any assessment or fee payable to the commission
 under this compact when due.
  6. A license granted pursuant to this  section  shall  expire  on  the
 expiration  date  (which shall be at least one year from the date of its
 issuance) set forth by the commission on the  card  or  other  means  of
 identification  issued  by the commission as evidence of a license. Upon
 expiration thereof, a license may be  renewed  by  the  commission  upon
 A. 9644  180
 
 fulfilling the same requirements as are set forth in this section for an
 original application.
  §  3307.  Air freight security area. 1. On or after the effective date
 of this compact, the commission shall have the power  to  designate  any
 area  located  within  an  airport  as an air freight security area.  No
 person who is not licensed by the commission pursuant  to  this  compact
 shall  have  ingress  to  an  air  freight security area unless issued a
 permit by the commission.
  2. Any person who is not licensed by the commission pursuant  to  this
 compact  and  who  desires  upon  any occasion ingress to an air freight
 security area shall apply at the entrance to such area for a permit  for
 ingress  for  that particular occasion.  In order to secure a permit, a
 prospective permittee must show identification establishing his name and
 address and he may be required by the commission to sign  a  consent  to
 the  surrender  of  his  permit upon egress from such area and, if he is
 driving a motor vehicle, to an inspection  of  his  motor  vehicle  upon
 egress  from  such  area.  Any person desiring a permit to enter an air
 freight security area may be denied such permit by the commission in its
 discretion if the commission determines that the presence of such person
 in such area would constitute a danger to the public peace or safety.
  3. Any person whose business, employment or occupation requires him to
 have ingress upon a regular basis to an air freight security area  shall
 be  required,  in  order to obtain ingress to such area, to apply to the
 commission for a permit for a fixed period of duration to be  determined
 by  the  commission.  Such applicant for a permit of a fixed period of
 duration shall fulfill the same requirements as the prospective licensee
 for an airfreightman's license.  The commission may in the  exercise  of
 its  discretion suspend or revoke such permit of a fixed period of dura-
 tion for the same causes which would permit the commission to revoke the
 license of an airfreightman.
  4. The commission shall have the power to inspect  any  truck  or  any
 other motor vehicle within an air freight security area.
  5.  The  provisions  of  this  article  shall not be applicable to any
 person who is a member of the flight crew  or  flight  personnel  of  an
 aircraft which is operated by an air carrier and which is located within
 an  air  freight  security area upon a showing of such identification as
 may be required by the commission.
  § 3308. Hearings, determinations and review.  1. The commission  shall
 not  deny  any  application  for  a license or permit without giving the
 applicant or prospective licensee or permittee reasonable  prior  notice
 and an opportunity to be heard.
  2.  Any application for a license or permit, and any license or permit
 issued, may be denied, revoked or suspended, as the case may be, only in
 the manner prescribed in this section.
  3. The commission may on its own initiative or  on  complaint  of  any
 person,  including  any public official or agency, institute proceedings
 to revoke or suspend any license or permit after a hearing at which  the
 licensee  or  permittee  and  any  person making such complaint shall be
 given an opportunity to be heard, provided that any order of the commis-
 sion revoking or suspending any  license  or  permit  shall  not  become
 effective until fifteen days subsequent to the serving of notice thereof
 upon  the  licensee or permittee unless in the opinion of the commission
 the continuance of the license or permit for such period would be inimi-
 cal to the public peace or safety.  Such hearings shall be held in  such
 manner  and  upon  such  notice as may be prescribed by the rules of the
 A. 9644  181
 
 commission, but such notice shall be of not less than ten days and shall
 state the nature of the complaint.
  4.  Pending  the determination of such hearing pursuant to subdivision
 three of this section, the commission may temporarily suspend a  license
 or  permit  if  in  the opinion of the commission the continuance of the
 license or permit for such period is inimical to  the  public  peace  or
 safety.
  5.  The  commission, or such member, officer, employee or agent of the
 commission as may be designated by  the  commission  for  such  purpose,
 shall have the power to issue subpoenas throughout both states to compel
 the attendance of witnesses and the giving of testimony or production of
 other evidence and to administer oaths in connection with any such hear-
 ing.  It  shall  be  the duty of the commission or of any such member,
 officer, employee or agent of the commission designated by  the  commis-
 sion  for  such  purpose  to  issue subpoenas at the request of and upon
 behalf of the licensee, permittee or applicant.  The commission or  such
 person conducting the hearing shall not be bound by common law or statu-
 tory  rules  of evidence or by technical or formal rules or procedure in
 the conduct of such hearing.
  6. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall take  such
 action  upon  such  findings  and  determinations as it deems proper and
 shall execute an order carrying such findings into effect.  The  action
 in  the  case  of  an  application  for a license or permit shall be the
 granting or denial thereof.  The action in the case  of  a  licensee  or
 permittee  shall  be  revocation  of the license or permit or suspension
 thereof for a fixed period or reprimand or a dismissal of the charges.
  7. The action of the commission  in  denying  any  application  for  a
 license or permit or in suspending or revoking such license or permit or
 in  reprimanding  a  licensee  or permittee shall be subject to judicial
 review by a proceeding instituted in either state at the instance of the
 applicant, licensee or permittee in the manner provided by  the  law  of
 such  state for review of the final decision or action of administrative
 agencies of such state,  provided,  however,  that  notwithstanding  any
 other  provision  of law the court shall have power to stay for not more
 than thirty days an order of the commission  suspending  or  revoking  a
 license or permit.
  8.  At  hearings conducted by the commission pursuant to this section,
 applicants, prospective licensees and permittees, licensees and  permit-
 tees shall have the right to be accompanied and represented by counsel.
  9.  After  the  conclusion  of a hearing but prior to the making of an
 order by the commission,  a  hearing  may,  upon  petition  and  in  the
 discretion  of  the hearing officer, be reopened for the presentation of
 additional evidence.  Such petition to reopen the hearing shall state in
 detail the nature of the additional evidence, together with the  reasons
 for  the  failure to submit such evidence prior to the conclusion of the
 hearing.  The commission may upon its own  motion  and  upon  reasonable
 notice  reopen  a  hearing  for the presentation of additional evidence.
 Upon petition, after the making of an order of the commission, rehearing
 may be granted in the discretion of the commission.  Such a petition for
 rehearing shall state in detail the grounds upon which the  petition  is
 based  and shall separately set forth each error of law and fact alleged
 to have been made by the commission in its determination, together  with
 the  facts  and  arguments  in support thereof.  Such petition shall be
 filed with the commission not later than thirty days  after  service  of
 such  order  unless  the commission for good cause shown shall otherwise
 A. 9644  182

 direct.  The commission may upon its own motion grant a rehearing  after
 the making of an order.
  §  3309.  Expenses of administration.  1. In addition to the budget of
 its expenses under the waterfront  commission  compact,  the  commission
 shall  annually  adopt  a  budget of its expenses under this compact for
 each year.  The annual budget shall be submitted to the governors of the
 two states and shall take  effect  as  submitted  provided  that  either
 governor  may within thirty days disapprove or reduce any item or items,
 and the budget shall be adjusted accordingly.
  2. After taking into account such funds as may be available to it from
 reserves in excess of ten per cent of such budget  under  this  compact,
 federal  grants,  or otherwise, the balance of the commission's budgeted
 expenses shall be obtained by fees payable under  this  article  and  by
 assessments  upon  employers  of  persons licensed under this compact as
 provided in this article.
  3. With respect to airfreightmen and airfreightman supervisors who are
 employed by an air freight truck carrier regularly to move freight to or
 from an airport, the employers shall pay to the commission for each such
 airfreightman and airfreightman supervisor a license fee  to  be  deter-
 mined  by  the commission, not in excess of one hundred dollars for each
 year, commencing with the first day of April.  The  employer  of  every
 person  who  is  issued a permit of fixed duration by the commission for
 ingress to an air freight security area, or the permittee himself if  he
 is  self-employed, shall pay to the commission a fee to be determined by
 the commission, not in excess of seventy-five  dollars  for  each  year,
 commencing with the first day of April.  The commission shall reduce the
 maximum  fees  payable  under  this  section  proportionately  with  any
 reduction in the maximum assessment rate of two per cent provided for by
 this section.
  4. Every  employer  of  airfreightmen  and  airfreightman  supervisors
 licensed  by the commission, except as otherwise provided in subdivision
 three of this  section,  shall  pay  to  the  commission  an  assessment
 computed upon the gross payroll payments made by such employer to airfr-
 eightmen  and airfreightman supervisors for work performed as such, at a
 rate, not in excess of two per cent, computed by the commission, in  the
 following manner:  the commission shall annually estimate the fees paya-
 ble  under  this  section  and  the gross payroll payments to be made by
 employers subject to assessment and shall compute the fees and a rate of
 assessment which will yield revenues sufficient to finance  the  balance
 of  the commission's budget for each year as provided in subdivision two
 of this section. The commission may hold in reserve  an  amount  not  to
 exceed  ten  per cent of its total budgeted expenses for the year, which
 reserve shall not be included as part of the budget.  Such reserve shall
 be held for the stabilization of  annual  assessments,  the  payment  of
 operating deficits and for the repayment of any advances made by the two
 states.
  5. The amount required to balance the commission's budget in excess of
 the  estimated yield of the maximum fees and assessment, shall be certi-
 fied by the commission, with the approval of the  respective  governors,
 to  the  legislatures of the two states, in proportion to the respective
 totals of the assessments and fees paid to the commission by persons  in
 each  of the two states.  The legislatures shall annually appropriate to
 the commission the amount so certified.
  6. The assessments and fees hereunder shall be in lieu  of  any  other
 charge  for the issuance of licenses or permits by the commission pursu-
 ant to this compact.
 A. 9644  183
 
  7. In addition to any other sanction provided by law,  the  commission
 may  revoke  or suspend any license or permit held by any employer under
 this compact and/or the license or permit held under this compact by any
 employees of such employer, or the permit held under this compact by any
 permittee  who is self-employed, and in addition the commission may deny
 ingress to such employers, employees or permittees to air freight  secu-
 rity areas, for nonpayment of any assessment or fee when due.
  8.  Every  person  subject to the payment of any assessment under this
 compact shall file on or before the twentieth day of the first month  of
 each  calendar quarter-year a separate return, together with the payment
 of the assessment due, for the preceding  calendar  quarter-year  during
 which  any  payroll  payments  were  made  to  licensed persons for whom
 assessments are payable for work performed as such. Returns covering the
 amount of assessment payable shall be filed with the commission on forms
 to be furnished for such purpose and shall contain such  data,  informa-
 tion  or  matter  as  the commission may require to be included therein.
 The commission may grant a  reasonable  extension  of  time  for  filing
 returns,  or  for  payment  of  assessment,  whenever good cause exists.
 Every return shall have annexed thereto a certification  to  the  effect
 that the statements contained therein are true.
  9.  Every  person subject to the payment of assessment hereunder shall
 keep an accurate record of his employment of licensed persons  for  whom
 assessments  are  payable,  which  shall show the amount of compensation
 paid and such other information as the commission  may  require.  Such
 records  shall  be preserved for a period of three years and be open for
 inspection at reasonable times.  The  commission  may  consent  to  the
 destruction  of  any  such  records at any time after said period or may
 require that they be kept longer but not in excess of six years.
  10. (a) The commission shall audit and determine the amount of assess-
 ment due from the return filed and such other information as  is  avail-
 able  to  it.  Whenever  a  deficiency in payment of the assessment is
 determined the commission shall give notice of any such determination to
 the person liable  therefor.  Such  determination  shall  finally  and
 conclusively  fix  the  amount due, unless the person against whom it is
 assessed shall, within thirty days after the giving of  notice  of  such
 determination,  apply  in  writing  to  the commission for a hearing, or
 unless the commission on its own motion shall reduce the  same.  After
 such  hearing,  the  commission shall give notice of its decision to the
 person liable therefor.  A determination of the  commission  under  this
 subdivision shall be subject to judicial review, if application for such
 review  is  made  within  thirty days after the giving of notice of such
 decision.  Any determination under this section  shall  be  made  within
 five years from the time the return was filed and if no return was filed
 such determination may be made at any time.
  (b)  Any notice authorized or required under this section may be given
 by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended  at  the  last
 address  given  by him to the commission, or in the last return filed by
 him with the commission under this section, or if  no  return  has  been
 filed  then  to  such address as may be obtainable.  The mailing of such
 notice shall be presumptive evidence of  the  receipt  of  same  by  the
 person  to  whom  addressed.  Any  period  of  time, which is determined
 according to the provision of this subdivision, for the giving of notice
 shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
  11. Every person required to pay a fee for a license or a permit under
 this section shall pay the same upon filing of the application with  the
 commission  for  such  license  or permit.  The fee for such license or
 A. 9644  184
 
 permit shall be prorated for the fiscal year for which the same is paya-
 ble as of the date the application for such license or permit  is  filed
 with  the commission.  The commission shall prorate and make a refund of
 such  fee for the period between the date of application and the date of
 the issuance of such license or permit.  Upon surrender of such  license
 or permit or upon the revocation of any such license or permit issued to
 an  employee  before  the  expiration of the fiscal year, the commission
 shall make a refund prorated for the unexpired portion of the year, less
 ten per cent of such refund.  In the event of denial of any  application
 for  a  license or permit, the commission shall refund the fee paid upon
 application, less ten per cent of such refund.
  12.  Whenever any person shall fail to pay, within  the  time  limited
 herein, any assessment or fee which he is required to pay to the commis-
 sion  under  the  provisions  of this section the commission may enforce
 payment of such assessment or fee by civil action for the amount of such
 assessment or fee with interest and penalties.
  13. The employment by a nonresident of a licensed person or  permittee
 for  whom  assessments or fees are payable in either state or the desig-
 nation by a nonresident of a licensed person  or  permittee  to  perform
 work  in such state shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such
 nonresident of the secretary of state of such state to be his  true  and
 lawful  attorney  upon  whom  may be served the process in any action or
 proceeding against him growing out of any liability for  assessments  or
 fees, penalties or interest, and a consent that any such process against
 him  which is so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as
 if served on him personally within such state and within the territorial
 jurisdiction of the court from which the process  issues.  Service  of
 process  within  either  state  shall  be  made by either (1) personally
 delivering to and leaving with the secretary of state or a deputy secre-
 tary of state of such state duplicate copies thereof at  the  office  of
 the  department  of  state  in  the capital city of such state, in which
 event such secretary of state shall forthwith send  by  registered  mail
 one  of  such copies to the person at the last address designated by him
 to the commission for any purpose under this  section  or  in  the  last
 return  filed  by him under this section with the commission or as shown
 on the records of the commission, or if no return has been filed, at his
 last known office  address  within  or  without  such  state,  or  (2)
 personally  delivering  to  and leaving with the secretary of state or a
 deputy secretary of state of such state a copy thereof at the office  of
 the  department of state in the capital city of such state and by deliv-
 ering a copy thereof to  the  person,  personally  without  such  state.
 Proof  of  such  personal service without such state shall be filed with
 the clerk of the court in which the process  is  pending  within  thirty
 days  after  such  service  and  such service shall be complete ten days
 after proof thereof is filed.
  14. Whenever the commission shall determine that any  moneys  received
 as  assessments  or fees were paid in error, it may cause the same to be
 refunded, provided an application therefor is filed with the  commission
 within two years from the time the erroneous payment was made.
  15.  In addition to any other powers authorized hereunder, the commis-
 sion shall have power to make reasonable rules and regulations to effec-
 tuate the purposes of this section.
  16. When any person shall wilfully fail to pay any assessment  or  fee
 due  hereunder  he  shall be assessed interest at a rate of one per cent
 per month on the amount due and unpaid and penalties of five per cent of
 the amount due for each thirty days or part thereof that the  assessment
 A. 9644  185
 
 remains  unpaid.  The commission may, for good cause shown, abate all or
 part of such penalty.
  17.  Any person who shall wilfully furnish false or fraudulent infor-
 mation or shall  wilfully  fail  to  furnish  pertinent  information  as
 required, with respect to the amount of any assessment or fee due, shall
 be  guilty  of  a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one
 thousand dollars, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
  18. All funds of the commission shall be deposited with such responsi-
 ble banks or trust companies as may be  designated  by  the  commission.
 The  commission  may  require that all such deposits be secured by obli-
 gations of the United States or of the states of New York or New  Jersey
 of  a market value equal at all times to the amount of the deposits, and
 all banks and trust companies are authorized to give such  security  for
 such deposits.  The moneys so deposited shall be withdrawn only by check
 signed  by  two  members  of the commission or by such other officers or
 employees of the commission as it may from time to time designate.
  19. The accounts, books and records of the commission,  including  its
 receipts,  disbursements,  contracts,  leases, investments and any other
 matters relating to its financial standing shall be examined and audited
 annually by independent auditors to be retained for such purpose by  the
 commission.
  20.  The commission shall reimburse each state for any funds advanced
 to the commission exclusive of sums appropriated pursuant to subdivision
 five of this section.
  § 3310. General violations; prosecutions; penalties.  1. The  failure
 of  any  witness,  when  duly subpoenaed to attend, to give testimony or
 produce other evidence in any investigation, interview or other proceed-
 ing conducted by the commission  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this
 compact, shall be punishable by the superior court in New Jersey and the
 supreme court in New York in the same manner as said failure is punisha-
 ble by such court in a case therein pending.
  2.  Any person who, having been duly sworn or affirmed as a witness in
 any investigation,  interview  or  other  proceeding  conducted  by  the
 commission  pursuant  to  the provisions of this compact, shall wilfully
 give false testimony shall be guilty of a misdemeanor  punishable  by  a
 fine  of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more
 than one year or both.
  3. Any person who interferes with or impedes the orderly licensing  of
 or  orderly granting of any permits to any other person pursuant to this
 compact, or who attempts, conspires, or threatens so  to  do,  shall  be
 guilty  of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than one thou-
 sand dollars or imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
  4. Any person who directly or  indirectly  inflicts  or  threatens  to
 inflict  any  injury,  damage, harm or loss or in any other manner prac-
 tices intimidation upon or against any person  in  order  to  induce  or
 compel  such  person  or  any  other  person to refrain from obtaining a
 license or permit pursuant to this compact shall be guilty of  a  misde-
 meanor  punishable  by  a  fine of not more than one thousand dollars or
 imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
  5. Any person who, without justification or excuse in law, directly or
 indirectly, intimidates or inflicts any injury, damage,  harm,  loss  or
 economic  reprisal  upon any person who holds a license or permit issued
 by the commission pursuant to this compact,  or  any  other  person,  or
 attempts,  conspires  or threatens so to do, in order to interfere with,
 impede or influence such licensee or permittee  in  the  performance  or
 discharge of his duties or obligations shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
 A. 9644  186
 
 punishable  by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or imprison-
 ment of not more than one year or both.
  6. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this compact,
 for which no other penalty is prescribed, shall be guilty of a misdemea-
 nor,  punishable  by  a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by
 imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
  7. In any prosecution under this compact, it shall  be  sufficient  to
 prove  only a single act (or a single holding out or attempt) prohibited
 by law without having to prove a general course of conduct, in order  to
 prove a violation.
  §  3311.  Amendments;  construction;  short title.  1. Amendments and
 supplements to this compact to implement the  purposes  thereof  may  be
 adopted by the action of the legislature of either state concurred in by
 the legislature of the other.
  2.  If any part or provision of this compact or the application there-
 of  to  any  person or circumstances be adjudged invalid by any court of
 competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation
 to the part, provision or application directly involved in  the  contro-
 versy  in  which  such  judgment  shall have been rendered and shall not
 affect or impair the validity of the remainder of this  compact  or  the
 application thereof to other persons or circumstances and the two states
 hereby  declare  that  they  would have entered into this compact or the
 remainder thereof had the invalidity of such  provision  or  application
 thereof been apparent.
  3.  In  accordance  with the ordinary rules for construction of inter-
 state compacts this compact shall be liberally  construed  to  eliminate
 the evils described therein and to effectuate the purposes thereof.
  4.  This  compact  shall  be  known  and  may be cited as the "Airport
 Commission Compact".

 hundred  two of this part for certain employees.  If upon application to
 the commission by an employee who has  been  convicted  of  a  crime  or
 offense  specified in section thirty-four hundred one or section thirty-
 four hundred two of this part the commission, in its discretion,  deter-
 mines  in  an  order  that  it would not be contrary to the purposes and
 objectives of the airport commission compact for such employee  to  work
 in  a  particular employment otherwise prohibited by section thirty-four
 hundred one or  section  thirty-four  hundred  two,  the  provisions  of
 section  thirty-four  hundred one or section thirty-four hundred two, as
 the case may be, shall not apply to the particular  employment  of  such
 employee with respect to such conviction or convictions as are specified
 in  the  commission's  order.  This section is applicable only to those
 employees who for wages or salary perform manual, mechanical or physical
 work of a routine or clerical nature at the premises of the labor organ-
 ization, employer organization, welfare fund or trust by which they  are

 neglects to obey, observe or comply with any order or direction  of  the
 commission  issued  under  this  part, to recover a judgment for a money
 penalty not exceeding five hundred dollars for each and  every  offense.
 Every  violation  of  any  such provision, order or direction shall be a
 separate and distinct offense and, in case of  a  continuing  violation,
 every  day's  continuance  shall  be  and be deemed to be a separate and
 distinct offense. Any such action may  be  settled  or  discontinued  on

 the exercise or performance of any power or duty thereunder,  either  by
 mandamus,  injunction  or  action  or  proceeding in lieu of prerogative
 writ.
  § 3406. Exemption from arrest and service of process.  If a person  in
 obedience  to  a subpoena, issued pursuant to this part directing him to
 attend and testify comes into either state party to this part  from  the
 other  state, he shall not, while in that state pursuant to such subpoe-
 na, be subject to arrest or the service of process, civil  or  criminal,
 in  connection  with  matters  which arose before his entrance into such
 state under the subpoena.
  § 3407. Nonresident witnesses.  Any investigation, interview or  other
 proceeding  conducted  by  the  commission pursuant to the provisions of
 this compact shall be deemed to be a civil action pending in the supreme
 court in New York or in the superior court in New Jersey so as to permit
 the commission to obtain disclosure, in accordance with  the  provisions
 A. 9644  189
 
 governing  disclosure  in such civil actions, from any person who may be
 outside the states.
  § 3408. Officers and employees.  Any officer or employee in the state,
 county  or municipal civil service in either state who shall transfer to
 service with the commission may be given one or more leaves  of  absence
 without  pay  and  may, before the expiration of such leave or leaves of
 absence, and without further examination or qualification, return to his
 former position or be certified by the appropriate civil service  agency
 for retransfer to a comparable position in such state, county, or munic-
 ipal civil service if such a position is then available.
  The  commission  may,  by agreement with any federal agency from which
 any officer or employee may transfer to  service  with  the  commission,
 make similar provision for the retransfer of such officer or employee to
 such federal agency.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of any other law in either state, any
 officer or employee in the state, county or municipal service in  either
 state  who  shall  transfer  to service with the commission and who is a
 member of any existing state, county or municipal pension or  retirement
 system  in  New  Jersey  or New York, shall continue to have all rights,
 privileges, obligations and status with respect to such fund, system  or
 systems  as if he had continued in his state, county or municipal office
 or employment, but during the period of his service as a member, officer
 or employee of the commission,  all  contributions  to  any  pension  or
 retirement  fund or system to be paid by the employer on account of such
 member, officer or employee, shall be  paid  by  the  commission.  The
 commission  may,  by agreement with the appropriate federal agency, make
 similar provisions relating to continuance of retirement system  member-
 ship for any federal officer or employee so transferred.
  § 3409. Penalties.  Any person who shall violate any of the provisions
 of  this  compact,  for  which  no other penalty is prescribed, shall be
 guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thou-
 sand dollars or imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
  § 3410. Short title.  This part shall be known and may be cited as the
 "Waterfront and airport commission act".
  § 31. Chapter 28 of the consolidated laws constituting the  interstate
 authorities  law  created  by section thirty of this act shall be deemed
 for all purposes to be a continuation of the port authority of New  York
 and New Jersey as it was constituted immediately preceding the effective
 date  of this act and shall not be construed as a newly created authori-
 ty.  All unexpended balances of appropriations  of  monies  heretobefore
 made  or  allocated  to the port authority of New York and New Jersey as
 such authority was constituted immediately preceding the effective  date
 of this act, whether obligated or unobligated, are hereby transferred to
 and  made  available to the port authority of New York and New Jersey as
 created in section thirty of this act.  All rules, regulations,  orders,
 determinations,  and decisions of the port authority of New York and New
 Jersey, as it was constituted immediately preceding the  effective  date
 of  this  act,  shall  continue in full force and effect as rules, regu-
 lations, orders, determinations and decisions of the port  authority  of
 New York and New Jersey created by section thirty of this act.
  §  32. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdi-
 vision, section or part of this act shall be adjudged by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 A. 9644  190
 
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the legislature that this act would  have  been  enacted  even  if  such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  §  33.  This  act shall take effect upon the enactment into law by the
 state of New Jersey of legislation having an identical effect with  this
 act,  but  if  the  state  of New Jersey shall have already enacted such
 legislation this act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth  day
 after  it  shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition,
 amendment and/or repeal of any rule  or  regulation  necessary  for  the
 implementation  of  this  act on its effective date are authorized to be
 made and completed on or before such effective date. The chairman of the
 port authority shall notify the  legislative  bill  drafting  commission
 upon  the  enactment into law of such legislation by both such states in
 order that the commission may maintain an accurate and timely  effective
 data  base  of the official text of the laws of the state of New York in
 furtherance of effecting the provision of section 44 of the  legislative
 law and section 70-b of the public officers law.
 
  SUMMARY OF WATERFRONT COMMISSION ACT
 
  Chapter 882 of the laws of 1953, effective June 30, 1953, authorizes a
 Compact  between the States of New Jersey and New York to improve water-
 front labor conditions in the port of New York District,  establishes  a
 bi-state  commission  to  administer  the plan, and provides that in the
 interim, until Congress grants its  consent  to  the  Compact,  the  two
 states may separately but cooperatively place the program in operation.
 
  The Interim Arrangement
 
  Since  there may be some delay in procuring Congressional consent, the
 statute in each State provides for a single-state commission to  perform
 within the State the functions of the bi-state commission until Congres-
 sional  approval to the Compact is obtained. The bill is so drafted that
 the Commission will be able to function in each State from the  time  of
 enactment of the bill.
  Section  3 authorizes the Commissioners from each State to work in the
 closest possible cooperation with each other to effectuate the  purposes
 of the Act.
  The  State of New York will advance $400,000 to the Commission and the
 State of New Jersey, $200,000, to provide initial funds for  the  opera-
 tion of the Commission.
  The  licensing,  registration  and employment center provisions of the
 bill do not become operative until December 1, 1953.
 
  The Compact
 
  The proposed Compact is set forth in the sixteen articles  which  make
 up Section 1 of the bill.
  Legislative Findings
 
  Article I contains legislative declarations and findings which reflect
 the  conclusions  set  forth  in  the Report of the New York State Crime
 Commission on the port of New York Waterfront, the record of the  public
 hearings  held thereon by Governor Thomas E. Dewey on June 8 and 9, 1953
 and the companion report of the New Jersey Law Enforcement  Council.  In
 substance  the findings are that the methods now used in the Port of New
 A. 9644  191
 
 York District for hiring waterfront labor, and the conduct of the  busi-
 ness  of  public  loading  and  stevedoring  are  uneconomic, unjust and
 degrading insofar as the worker is concerned,  foster  waterfront  crime
 and  corruption,  and  adversely  affect  the economical and expeditious
 handling of port commerce.  Accordingly, it is declared that the present
 practices of public loaders must be eliminated and that the  occupations
 of  stevedores,  pier  superintendents, hiring agents, pier watchmen and
 longshoreman must be regulated in the public interest.
 
  Basic Plan
 
  The plan  to  improve  waterfront  labor  conditions  has  five  basic
 features:
  1.  Licensing  of pier superintendents and hiring agents,-only persons
 of good character (convicted criminals are  barred  for  at  least  five
 years)  will  be  licensed  for these key positions. The license must be
 requested by the employer concerned, is good only for  the  duration  of
 the employment and may be revoked for specified cause;
  2. Licensing of stevedores and port watchmen;
  3. The abolition of "public loading;"
  4.  Registration  of  longshoremen,-the  right to register is absolute
 unless the person had been convicted of a crime (but this  disqualifica-
 tion may be waived by the Commission) or is engaged in subversive activ-
 ity  or  unless  his  employment  on the waterfront is clearly likely to
 endanger the public peace or safety. Longshoremen who are  not  attached
 to  the  waterfront  labor market may be dropped from the register under
 specified conditions thus providing  more  and  steadier  work  for  and
 increasing  the  earning  capacity  of those who depend on this work for
 their livelihood;
  5. Operation  by  the  Commission  of  regionally  located  employment
 exchanges  for  registered  longshoremen  and  licensed  port  watchmen,
 replacing the wasteful and inhuman "shape-up" method, providing informa-
 tion as to  available  employment  and  flexibility  in  obtaining  such
 employment,  but  without interference with employer-employee freedom of
 selection or with provisions of collective bargaining agreements.
  The rights of licensees and registrants  are  carefully  protected  by
 procedural  safeguards set forth in Article XI including hearings, court
 review and other requirements for the protection of the individual.
 
  The Waterfront Commission
 
  Article III creates the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor.  The
 commission consists of two members, one from each State appointed by the
 Governor  with  the  consent of the Senate, to serve for a term of three
 years. It is contemplated that they may be compensated either on a  full
 time or per diem basis dependent upon whether the office will be a poli-
 cy  making one with administration delegated to an Executive Director or
 a full time executive assignment.
  Appropriate provision is  made  for  the  transfer  of  civil  service
 employees  to  service with the Commission without loss of Civil Service
 or retirement privileges.
  The general powers of the Commission as set forth in Article IV are to
 make rules and regulations to carry out the statutory plan, to  adminis-
 ter  oaths  and issue subpoenas, to have access to the waterfront in the
 performance of its duties, to investigate waterfront  practices  in  the
 port  district  and to advise and consult with other public officers and
 A. 9644  192
 
 with representatives of labor and industry on matters within its  juris-
 diction, including problems involved in rule making, in the granting and
 denial  of  registrations  and  licenses  and  in the maintenance of the
 longshoremen's  register.  The Commission is required to report annually
 to the Governors and Legislatures of both States and to make recommenda-
 tions for the improvement of the conditions of waterfront  labor  within
 the port district.
  In  order  to  insure that public regulation of waterfront labor prac-
 tices shall no unnecessarily  continue  once  law  and  order  has  been
 restored  to  the  waterfront,  the  Commission is expressly required to
 include in its Annual Report findings as to whether the public necessity
 still exists for continued registration of  longshoremen,  licensing  of
 the  other waterfront occupations and public operation of the employment
 information centers.
 
  Licensing of Pier Superintendents and Hiring Agents
 
  Article V requires that on and after December 1, 1953, any person  who
 wishes  to  act  as a pier superintendent or hiring agent for a shipping
 company or stevedore at a pier or other waterfront terminal  within  the
 port  district must be licensed. Because pier superintendents and hiring
 agents are, or should be, key supervisory representatives of the employ-
 er for whose acts the employer should be held responsible, the  applica-
 tion  for  these  licenses  is to be made by the prospective employer. A
 person is disqualified for either of theses  licenses  if  he  has  been
 convicted of a felony or high misdemeanor or of the following violations
 of  law which, while less serious in themselves, make him a bad risk for
 waterfront employment:-illegally using, carrying or possessing a danger-
 ous weapon;  making  or  possessing  burglar's  instruments;  buying  or
 receiving stolen property; unlawful entry; aiding an escape from prison;
 unlawfully  possessing  or  distributing  narcotic  drugs  and  previous
 violation of the Compact. However, if a person so  disqualified  submits
 satisfactory  evidence  of  good  conduct  for  at least five years, the
 Commission may waive this statutory disability.
  Additional grounds for disqualification for a license as a pier super-
 intendent or hiring agent include subversive activities by the applicant
 or a finding that he is not a person of good character or integrity.
  The term of a pier superintendent's or hiring agent's license is  tied
 to  his employment by the employer-applicant. However, it may be revoked
 or suspended or he may be reprimanded for the following specified  caus-
 es:-violation of the Compact; conviction of a crime or other cause which
 would  have been disqualifying originally; consorting with criminals for
 an unlawful purpose; fraud in securing the license or while acting ther-
 eunder; addition to or trafficking in narcotic drugs; violation  of  the
 Compact;  bribing public officers or anyone else to violate their duties
 under the Compact; unwarranted giving of his license  to  someone  else;
 impersonation  of another licensee; accepting a bribe in connection with
 his work; coercion of longshoremen; lending money to or borrowing  money
 from a longshoreman for a fee.
  Pier  superintendents  and hiring agents are ineligible for membership
 in any union which represent longshoremen.
 
  Stevedores
 
  Article VI requires that on and after December 1, 1953 all  stevedores
 in  the  port  district  must  be licensed. The license application must
 A. 9644  193
 
 fully disclose the real parties in interest. A license will  be  granted
 if the Commission is satisfied as to the good character and integrity of
 the  real parties in interest and if the applicant is a bona fide steve-
 dore,  that is to say that he has, or will, if licensed, have a contract
 with a shipping company to load and unload the company's ships at a pier
 in this port.
  Prior conviction of the same  serious  crimes  which  disqualify  pier
 superintendents  and  hiring  agents  also  disqualify  a stevedore. The
 Commission is authorized to waive this disqualification upon  a  showing
 of  at  least five years' good conduct. Additional grounds for disquali-
 fication in the case of stevedores are prescribed  to  accord  with  the
 Crime  Commission's  specific findings of abuses and evils now prevalent
 in this industry. These include payments made for an improper or  unlaw-
 ful purpose and are designed to reach the payment of bribes to a shipper
 to  obtain a stevedoring contract or to a union representative to betray
 his trust.
 
  Public Loading
 
  Article VII sets forth the States' policy against "public loading" and
 reviews the compelling policy reasons for abolition of the public loader
 system. Under the bill loading service will be performed in the port  of
 New  York as it is in every other major American port-by water carriers;
 operators of piers and other waterfront terminals at their  own  facili-
 ties; railroads, truckers, and other carriers in connection with freight
 being  carried  by them; shippers or consignees in connection with their
 own freight; and licensed stevedores, in the regular course of business,
 and through their own employees.
 
  Longshoremen
 
  A longshoremen's register is to be established by  the  Commission  by
 December 1, 1953. Article VIII sets forth the provisions with respect to
 the registration of longshoremen.
  There  is  no  fee  for registration and no special qualifications are
 prescribed. The applicant must provide his name, address, social securi-
 ty number and such further facts as may be needed to establish his iden-
 tity and criminal record, if any.
  Conviction of certain serious crimes or engaging in subversive  activ-
 ities  is  made basis for disqualification. The Commission, however, may
 waive the disqualification in a proper case and it may register a  long-
 shoreman even though he has previously been convicted of a crime.
  In  the  light of the Crime Commission's disclosures of the activities
 of known waterfront gangsters who have so far escaped being convicted of
 crime, provision has been inserted to  permit  the  Commission  to  deny
 registration  as a longshoreman to a person "whose presence on the piers
 or other waterfront terminals in the port of New York district is  found
 by  the Commission, on the basis of the facts and evidence before it, to
 constitute a danger to the public peace or safety."
  A longshoreman may be removed or suspended from the register only  for
 specified  cause.  In  such  case he is entitled to a hearing before the
 Commission, Counsel, his own witnesses, and  court  review.  The  causes
 specified  are  similar  to those specified for removal of hiring agents
 and wilful acts involving physical injury to a person or  damage  to  or
 misappropriation of property at a waterfront terminal.
 A. 9644  194
 
  Article  IX  contains  the  provisions  designed to permit purging the
 longshoremen's register  periodically  of  drifters  and  floaters  who,
 although  they are not bona fide longshoremen, have been permitted under
 the present system to take work away from longshoremen who depend on  it
 for their livelihood.
  For  each six month period, and in advance, the Commission will estab-
 lish the minimum number of days a man must work  or  offer  himself  for
 work  as a longshoreman in order to stay on the register. A person fail-
 ing so to qualify will be dropped on ten days' notice and  cannot  again
 be registered for one year unless he can show that his absence was occa-
 sioned by military service, sickness or other good cause.
 
  Port Watchmen
 
 Port  watchmen  will  be licensed pursuant to Article X. Applicants must
 not only possess qualifications similar to  those  prescribed  for  pier
 superintendents, but must also meet reasonable standards of physical and
 mental  fitness.  Since these port watchmen are security officers, prior
 criminal convictions is an absolute bar to a  license.  Because  of  the
 nature of their duties, port watchmen are not permitted to belong to the
 same union as longshoremen or pier superintendents or hiring agents.
  The term of the port watchmen's license is three years and is not tied
 to a particular employment. The grounds for revocation or suspension are
 basically the same as those for pier superintendents and hiring agents.
 
  Hearings and Court Review
 
  Article  XI  safeguards  the  rights  of  licensees and registrants by
 prescribing procedures for Commission hearings and assuring court review
 of Commission determinations. A registered longshoreman or any  licensee
 must  be given notice of any charges made against him and is entitled to
 a hearing at which he may have counsel and cross examine  witnesses  and
 the  licensee  or  longshoreman  can  require the Commission to subpoena
 witnesses requested by him. At least ten days advance notice of  such  a
 hearing must be provided.
  The  refusal  to  register a longshoreman or issue a license cannot be
 effective until after opportunity has been afforded for such hearing and
 any Commission determination affecting the right to work is  subject  to
 court  review.  The reviewing court is granted power to stay the Commis-
 sion's action for thirty days. No provision is incorporated in the  bill
 which  makes  refusal to testify or refusal to answer questions, without
 other cause, grounds for refusing or rescinding a license  or  registra-
 tion.
 
  Employment Information Centers
 
  Article XII authorizes the Commission to establish employment informa-
 tion centers throughout the port district to replace the "shape-up". All
 hiring  of longshoremen and port watchmen will be through these publicly
 operated centers. The employer would  have  freedom  of  choice  in  the
 selection  of  employees at such centers but there would be no interfer-
 ence with normal and proper hiring practices, including the gang or unit
 system, or procedures established under collective bargaining agreements
 not inconsistent with the requirements of the  Compact.  The  Commission
 will  establish a system of records and communication with employers and
 workers designed to provide  the  maximum  possible  information  as  to
 A. 9644  195
 
 available  employment  for  longshoremen. The Commission is empowered to
 obtain any Federal assistance that may be available  under  the  Wagner-
 Peyser Act for the operation of the employment centers.
 
  Expenses of Administration
 
  Article  XIII  and  other  sections  of the act adopt the principle of
 charging the cost of administration upon the basis of service  received.
 The  Commission  will prepare an annual budget of estimated expenses and
 assess the cost,  over  federal  or  other  contributions,  against  the
 employers of the registered and licensed waterfront employees in propor-
 tion  to  their  gross  annual  payments  to such employees. The rate of
 assessment may not be more than two percent  of  the  payroll  payments.
 Expenses of the Commission, in excess of amounts produced by two percent
 payroll  assessment  will be met by the two States, proportionately, out
 of general revenues. Until the Commission is jointly established by  the
 two  States, or July 1, 1954, whichever is earlier, the rate will be one
 and one-half percent in each State.
  The budget of the Commission may be reduced or modified by the  Gover-
 nor  of each State. In addition, the Commission may establish procedures
 to enable employers to protest budget estimates and computations of  the
 rate of assessment.
  It  is  felt that the savings to employers and consignees which may be
 obtained through a reduction in pilferage, the elimination of  "phantom"
 employees  from  the  payroll and other exactions and levies on commerce
 will greatly exceed the cost of administration of the waterfront commis-
 sion program.
 
  Violations
 
  Article XIV concerns general violations  of  the  Compact  and  prose-
 cutions  and  penalties therefor. Contempt is made punishable in accord-
 ance with normal judicial process. Wilful, false statements  under  oath
 are  constituted  as  perjury  and  other  violations  of the Compact or
 attempts or conspiracies to violate it are made punishable as is  inter-
 ference with the orderly registration of longshoremen.
  The  statute also prohibits loitering on the waterfront without satis-
 factory explanation. The language for this section is taken from  compa-
 rable provisions of law which presently apply to subways, railroads, air
 and bus terminals.
  Section  8  prohibits  the  collection  of  funds for waterfront labor
 unions having officers or agents who are convicted  felons  unless  they
 have  been  subsequently  pardoned  or have received in the State of New
 York a certificate of good conduct.
 
  Collective Bargaining Safeguarded
 
  There is nothing in the statute which is designed or can reasonably be
 construed to interfere in any way  with  the  right  of  the  waterfront
 industry  to select its own employees, or with the right of industry and
 labor to bargain collectively and agree on any method for the  selection
 of longshoremen and port watchmen by way of seniority, experience, regu-
 lar  gangs or otherwise in conformity with the license, registration and
 employment information center provisions of the statute. Because of  the
 apparent  misunderstanding  of  this point reflected at the public hear-
 A. 9644  196
 
 ings, express declaration to this effect has been included as Article XV
 in the Compact.
  Similarly,  to  obviate  any  misunderstanding, Article XV includes an
 express statement that the statute is not  designed  and  shall  not  be
 construed to limit labor's rights.
