  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 21, 2023, as Agriculture Day in the  State  of
  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the observance of
  March 2023, as National Agriculture Month
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to  support  and
promote  the  observance of Agriculture Day in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance of March 2023, as  National  Agriculture
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Agriculture  Day  is  a  time when producers, agricultural
associations,  corporations,  universities,  government  agencies,  and
countless  others  across  America gather to recognize and celebrate the
abundance provided by American agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hardworking American farmers are dedicated to providing New
York State, the Nation, and much of the  world  with  a  safe,  healthy,
affordable, and abundant food supply; this dedication is equaled only by
their commitment to protecting the land that makes it possible; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Farmers  across  the country live by this commitment every
day; as stewards of a healthy planet, they  care  for  the  soil,  their
animals,  and  the  crops  that  provide  us  food,  fuel  and  clothes;
furthermore, farmers boost our  local  economies  by  spending  locally,
attracting tourism, and keeping money in our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Agriculture is at the intersection of food, family, health,
community,  environment,  nature,  science,  homeland security, economic
concerns, and other significant things we care about; and
 
  WHEREAS, The vast majority  of  farms  and  ranches  in  the  United
States,  and especially in New York State, are family owned and operated
and have deep historical roots in their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Farmers provide fresh, locally  grown  food  to  our  urban
neighborhoods through an increasing number of farmers markets, CSAs, and
urban  farms,  improving  food options in our cities and creating better
understanding between urban and rural communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Farmers can be important stewards of our natural resources,
ensuring clean water, healthy soils,  and  increased  use  of  renewable
energy with sound, sustainable agricultural practices; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Agriculture  in New York State generates over $5 billion a
year in commodity sales and creates 196,000 jobs on and  off  the  farm;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Though  the average age of an American farmer is still 57,
young and beginning farmers are literally putting down roots to  be  the
next generation to feed our families, and returning veterans are finding
new and healing ways to rebuild their lives through agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration  of  National  Agriculture  Day  is  in
recognition of  farmers  from  all  racial,  ethnic  and  socio-economic
backgrounds  and  walks  of life, who feed us and our families every day
and of the importance of agriculture as a vital  industry  and  economic
driver in New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  21,  2023,  as
Agriculture  Day  in the State of New York, honoring and recognizing the
important contributions of  all  branches  of  farming  to  the  health,
economic  well-being, environment, beauty, and future of New York State;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the Chenango County Farm Bureau.
