  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  490 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 2-a to read as follows:
  2-A. AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. IN ADDITION TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDI-
 VISION TWO OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ENSURE THAT SPACE  IS
 PROVIDED  ON  THE APPLICATION SO THAT THE APPLICANT SHALL INDICATE IF HE
 OR SHE HAS AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER AND THAT THE FOLLOWING IS  TYPED  IN
 CLEAR AND CONSPICUOUS TYPE:
  "YOU MUST FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING SECTION: ARE YOU A PERSON WITH AUTISM
 SPECTRUM DISORDER? CHECK BOX FOR 'YES' OR 'SKIP THIS QUESTION'."
  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  MAKE  WHATEVER  PROVISIONS  ARE FEASIBLE AND
 DESIRABLE  TO  MAINTAIN  AND  ISSUE  ALL  SUITABLE  DOCUMENTS  REGARDING
 ADVANCED DIRECTIVES AT DRIVER'S LICENSE EXAMINING OFFICES.
  §  2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 3 of section 490 of the vehicle and
 traffic law, as amended by chapter 490 of the laws of 2019,  is  amended
 to read as follows:
  (b)  The  identification card shall contain a distinguishing number or
 mark and adequate space upon which an anatomical gift, pursuant to arti-
 cle forty-three of the public health law, by the holder may be  recorded
 and  shall  contain  such  other information and shall be issued in such
 form as the commissioner shall determine; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, EVERY IDEN-
 TIFICATION CARD OR RENEWAL THEREOF ISSUED TO A PERSON WITH AUTISM  SPEC-
 TRUM DISORDER SHALL CONTAIN A DISTINCTIVE MARK; provided, however, every

 identification  card or renewal thereof issued to a person under the age
 of twenty-one years shall have prominently imprinted thereon the  state-
 ment  "UNDER  21  YEARS  OF AGE" in notably distinctive print or format.
 Provided,  further, however, that every identification card issued to an
 applicant who was a member of the armed forces of the United States  and
 (i)  received  an  honorable  discharge  or was released therefrom under
 honorable conditions, or (ii) has a qualifying condition, as defined  in
 section  three  hundred  fifty  of the executive law, and has received a
 discharge other than bad conduct or dishonorable from such  service,  or
 (iii)  is a discharged LGBT veteran, as defined in section three hundred
 fifty of the executive law, and has received a discharge other than  bad
 conduct  or  dishonorable  from  such  service,  shall,  upon his or her
 request and submission of proof as set forth herein, contain  a  distin-
 guishing  mark,  in such form as the commissioner shall determine, indi-
 cating that he or she is a  veteran.  Such  proof  shall  consist  of  a
 certificate  of  release or discharge from active duty including but not
 limited to a DD Form 214 or other proof satisfactory to the  commission-
 er.  The  commissioner  shall  not require fees for the issuance of such
 identification cards or renewals thereof  to  persons  under  twenty-one
 years of age which are different from the fees required for the issuance
 of  identification cards or renewals thereof to persons twenty-one years
 of age or over, nor fees to persons requesting a veteran  distinguishing
 mark  which  are  different  from fees that would otherwise be required.
 Provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of  section  four
 hundred  ninety-one  of this article, the commissioner shall not require
 any fees for the duplication or  amendment  of  an  identification  card
 prior to its renewal if such duplication or amendment was solely for the
 purpose  of  adding a veteran distinguishing mark to such identification
 card.
  § 3.  Paragraph (b) of subdivision 3 of section 490 of the vehicle and
 traffic law, as amended by section 97 of part PP of chapter  56  of  the
 laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  (b)  The  identification card shall contain a distinguishing number or
 mark and adequate space upon which an anatomical gift, pursuant to arti-
 cle forty-three of the public health law, by the holder may be  recorded
 and  shall  contain  such  other information and shall be issued in such
 form as the commissioner shall determine; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, EVERY IDEN-
 TIFICATION CARD OR RENEWAL THEREOF ISSUED TO A PERSON WITH AUTISM  SPEC-
 TRUM DISORDER SHALL CONTAIN A DISTINCTIVE MARK; provided, however, every
 identification  card or renewal thereof issued to a person under the age
 of twenty-one years shall have prominently imprinted thereon the  state-
 ment  "UNDER  21  YEARS  OF AGE" in notably distinctive print or format.
 Provided, further, however, that every identification card issued to  an
 applicant  who was a member of the armed forces of the United States and
 (i) received an honorable discharge  or  was  released  therefrom  under
 honorable  conditions, or (ii) has a qualifying condition, as defined in
 section one of the veterans' services law, and has received a  discharge
 other  than bad conduct or dishonorable from such service, or (iii) is a
 discharged LGBT veteran, as defined in  section  one  of  the  veterans'
 services  law,  and  has  received a discharge other than bad conduct or
 dishonorable from such service, shall,  upon  his  or  her  request  and
 submission  of proof as set forth herein, contain a distinguishing mark,
 in such form as the commissioner shall determine, indicating that he  or
 she  is  a veteran. Such proof shall consist of a certificate of release
 or discharge from active duty including but not limited to a DD Form 214
 or other proof satisfactory to the commissioner. The commissioner  shall

 not  require  fees  for  the  issuance  of  such identification cards or
 renewals thereof to persons under twenty-one  years  of  age  which  are
 different  from  the  fees  required  for the issuance of identification
 cards  or  renewals  thereof to persons twenty-one years of age or over,
 nor fees to persons requesting a veteran distinguishing mark  which  are
 different from fees that would otherwise be required. Provided, however,
 that  notwithstanding  the provisions of section four hundred ninety-one
 of this article, the commissioner shall not require  any  fees  for  the
 duplication  or amendment of an identification card prior to its renewal
 if such duplication or amendment was solely for the purpose of adding  a
 veteran distinguishing mark to such identification card.

 CANT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS TO OPERATE A COMMERCIAL  MOTOR  VEHICLE,  AS
