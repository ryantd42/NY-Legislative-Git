BY: Senator PALUMBO
 
  COMMENDING Frank Greenwood and William Renten upon
  the occasion of their designation as recipients of a
  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest honor bestowed upon an
  individual by the New York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to commend Frank
Greenwood and William Renten upon the occasion of their  designation  as
recipients  of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor bestowed upon an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established  by
Resolution  and  is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have merited special
commendation for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf  of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Around  9  a.m.  on Wednesday, January 25, 2023, Riverhead
Town Highway employees Frank Greenwood and William Renten were repairing
the sidewalk on Pulaski Street and Hamilton Avenue  when  they  heard  a
woman yelling and saw her pointing at them and their fellow workers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Frank  Greenwood  and  William  Renten looked over and saw
flames coming from a second-floor  window  in  an  apartment  above  the
Western  Union  store; the men immediately ran over to the building, and
Frank yelled for someone to call 911 and  inform  the  dispatcher  there
were people inside; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Frank  Greenwood  and  William  Renten opened the door and
noticed the upstairs was completely covered in smoke and saw  flames  in
the back of the building; through the thick smoke, Frank and William saw
a woman on the stairs, and swiftly ran up and brought her down to safety
outside the burning house; and
 
  WHEREAS, Frank Greenwood then turned around and saw a second elderly
woman  in  the corner window banging on the glass; he and William Renten
went back into the smoke-filled house and helped her get down the stairs
and out the door; and
 
  WHEREAS, After safely  extricating  the  two  elderly  women,  Frank
Greenwood  and  William  Renten  went back into the house once again and
tried to put out the fire with extinguishers, however, it  was  too  far
gone; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Frank  Greenwood  and  William  Renten,  through  their
spontaneous and heroic actions, demonstrated their character  and  their
compassion  for  the welfare of others, personifying, by virtue of their
actions,  the  collective  concern  of  ordinary  citizens  across  the
community  of  the State of New York who voluntarily respond when others
are in need of help; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Frank Greenwood and William Renten upon the  occasion  of  their
designation as recipients of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed
upon an individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Frank Greenwood and William Renten.
