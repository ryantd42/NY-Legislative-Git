  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 1-7, 2024, as Public Health Week in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health  issues  that affect the lives of the citizens of New York State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 1-7, 2024, as Public Health Week
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Public Health Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Public  Health  Week  is  a United States health
awareness event backed by the American Public Health Association (APHA);
and
 
  WHEREAS, The first National Public Health Week took place  in  1995,
and has seen increasing support over the years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital  event  aims  to  highlight  public  health
achievements and improve the general health of the  American  people  by
educating  the  public about various health issues and how they can live
longer lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nearly 2.5 billion work days are lost due to illness  every
year,  with  an  estimated  fall  in  productivity  of  $1  trillion; by
improving the health of the nation, people's lives will improve and  the
country will continue to prosper; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  education,  health awareness campaigns can reduce
the effects and consequences of many health conditions and  diseases  by
preventing their onset or tackling any symptoms or issues early on; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater awareness of public
health issues, and more must be done to increase activity at the  local,
state and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 1-7, 2024, as Public
Health Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
