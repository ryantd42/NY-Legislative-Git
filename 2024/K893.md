Women's History Month, as a day to honor and salute Black women; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Black  women  have excelled in all areas of life, from the
arts, government, math, science, business,  agriculture,  teaching,  and
family;  from  Shirley  Chisholm,  Lucy  French,  and Harriet Tubman, to
Georgia Powers, Mae Street Kidd, and to the unknown Black women who have
given their all; and
 
  WHEREAS, Black women have helped to shape America's history and have
been the solid foundation of both the  Black  community  and  the  Black

are experts at making lemonade out of life's lemons; and

are staunch champions for civil rights and a world that  works  for  all
people; and
 
  WHEREAS, On February 29, 2024, we celebrate "Mama" and the ancestors
who taught Black women to be strong, resourceful, and to do good for the
greater good; and
 
  WHEREAS, February 29, 2024, connects the celebratory months of Black
History Month and Women's History Month, and symbolically represents the
intersection of being Black and being a woman; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body urges all citizens of the State of
New York to honor Black women by  acknowledging  and  celebrating  their
brilliance, beauty, and boldness; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
