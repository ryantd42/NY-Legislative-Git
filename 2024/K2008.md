  COMMENDING  volunteer  Firefighter  Wayne  Lebarge
  upon the occasion of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition  after  50 years of dedicated service to
  Lisbon Volunteer Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend  volunteer
Firefighter  Wayne  Lebarge  upon  the  occasion  of his designation for
special recognition after  50  years  of  dedicated  service  to  Lisbon
Volunteer Fire Department on Saturday, May 4, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Wayne  Lebarge  has  consistently  demonstrated a level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  steadfast  and  unwavering commitment to his fire
company, Wayne Lebarge joined Lisbon Volunteer Fire Department on May 4,
1974 and his last day will be May 4, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout his years of service, Wayne Lebarge served as  a
past  fire chief; he also served as an elected fire commissioner for the
Lisbon Fire District for four terms; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Wayne  Lebarge  is  such  a  firefighter; throughout 50 years of devoted
service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the  call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  volunteer  Firefighter  Wayne  Lebarge upon the occasion of his
designation for special recognition after 50 years of dedicated  service
to Lisbon Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to volunteer Firefighter Wayne Lebarge.
