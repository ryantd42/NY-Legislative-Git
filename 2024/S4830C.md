 AN  ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to conducting a
  highway and depot charging needs evaluation
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. In order to achieve targets set forth
 by  the  climate leadership and community protection act, zero-emissions
 vehicle sales target and regulations, including the advanced clean truck
 and advanced clean cars II rules, zero-emissions school bus mandate, and
 other relevant goals, the interests of the people of the state would  be
 served by:
  1.  Coordinating  efforts  to  plan for electric vehicle fast-charging
 deployment on New York's highways;
  2. Identifying priority sites for  the  deployment  of  fast  chargers
 along  New  York's  highways, estimating future charging demand at these
 sites for all vehicle classes, and identifying necessary  electric  grid
 transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  and  interconnection
 upgrades at these sites;
  3. Expediting electric grid transmission and distribution  infrastruc-
 ture  and  interconnection  upgrades at sites controlled by the New York
 state thruway authority, sufficient to future-proof  thruway  sites  for
 accelerated fast charger deployment to serve light duty, medium duty and
 heavy duty vehicles; and
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  4.  Identifying additional high priority areas for the deployment of
 charging for medium and heavy duty vehicles, such as school buses, tran-
 sit buses, and other light,  medium  and  heavy  duty  commercial  fleet
 depots,  including  taxi  and  ride-share  vehicle  fleets, and removing
 barriers  to  charging  deployment,  including  electric  infrastructure
 constraints.
  5. Identifying additional priority areas for  deployment  of  charging
 infrastructure designed to support building of charging in densely popu-
 lated urban areas where access to charging is currently or may be limit-
 ed.
