 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law and the public  service  law,
  in relation to establishing a highway and depot charging action plan
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. In order to achieve targets set forth
 by the climate leadership and community protection  act,  zero-emissions
 vehicle  sales  targets  and  regulations,  including the advanced clean
 truck and advanced  clean  cars  II  rules,  zero-emissions  school  bus
 mandate,  and  other  relevant goals, the interests of the people of the
 state would be served by:
  1. Coordinating efforts to plan  for  electric  vehicle  fast-charging
 deployment on New York's highways;
  2.  Identifying  priority  sites  for  the deployment of fast chargers
 along New York's highways, estimating future charging  demand  at  these
 sites  for  all vehicle classes, and identifying necessary electric grid
 transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  and  interconnection
 upgrades at these sites;
  3.  Expediting electric grid transmission and distribution infrastruc-
 ture and interconnection upgrades at sites controlled by  the  New  York
 state  thruway  authority,  sufficient to future-proof thruway sites for
 accelerated fast charger deployment to serve light duty, medium duty and
 heavy duty vehicles; and
  4.  Identifying additional high priority areas for the  deployment  of
 charging for medium and heavy duty vehicles, such as school buses, tran-
 sit  buses,  and  other  light,  medium  and heavy duty commercial fleet

  2.  TO REDUCE COSTS OF THE CAPITAL PLANS  TO  UTILITY  CUSTOMERS,  THE
 COMMISSION  SHALL  CONSIDER  MECHANISMS  INCLUDING,  BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

 INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROMOTE CHARGING DEVELOPMENT.
  4.  IN  ESTABLISHING  THE  CAPITAL  PLAN, THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES SHALL
 EVALUATE BENEFITS OF UTILIZING DISTRIBUTED ENERGY  RESOURCES,  INCLUDING
 BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO, ENERGY STORAGE OR MANAGED CHARGING PROGRAMS. SUCH
 BENEFITS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, LOWERING THE TOTAL COST OF
 THE CAPITAL PLAN, PROVIDING INCREASED RESILIENCY AT A  HIGHWAY  CHARGING
 HUB  OR  IN  A  FLEET  CHARGING ZONE, AND PROVIDING INTERIM SOLUTIONS TO
 ENABLE CHARGING DEPLOYMENT WHERE  GRID  INFRASTRUCTURE  IS  NOT  YET  IN
 PLACE.  INTERCONNECTION,  ELECTRIC  DISTRIBUTION, AND LOCAL TRANSMISSION
 UPGRADES IN THE CAPITAL PLAN MAY INCLUDE UTILITY OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION
 OF ENERGY STORAGE FACILITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  MOBILE  OR
 TEMPORARY STORAGE FACILITIES.
  5.  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "FUTURE-PROOFING UPGRADES" SHALL

 AMONG OTHER FACTORS:
  (A) REVISIONS TO UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES
 TO ENCOURAGE PROACTIVE INVESTMENTS IN THE FLEET  CHARGING  ZONES,  ESPE-
 CIALLY  WHERE INVESTMENTS SUPPORT AND ARE SUPPORTED BY DISADVANTAGED AND
 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES;
  (B) IMPLEMENTING NECESSARY TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION  UPGRADES  TO
 MEET THE CHARGING CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE FLEET CHARGING ZONES;

 A  BONA FIDE LABOR ORGANIZATION OF JURISDICTION THAT IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED
 IN REPRESENTING ELECTRIC UTILITY EMPLOYEES.
  § 4. Section 1020-gg of the public authorities law, as added by  chap-
 ter 433 of the laws of 2009, is amended to read as follows:
  § 1020-gg. Energy plan. The authority shall complete a biennial energy
 plan in accordance with the provisions of article six of the energy law.
 In  addition  to  any requirements of article six of the energy law, the
