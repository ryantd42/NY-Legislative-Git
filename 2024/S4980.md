 Introduced  by  Sen.  MURRAY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Local Government
 
 AN ACT to amend the general municipal  law,  in  relation  to  requiring
  identification numbers to be displayed on certain buildings
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent and purpose. It is the  intent  of  this
 legislature  to  ensure  the  prompt  response of designated agencies to
 emergency calls and  situations.  During  emergencies  time  is  of  the
 essence  and  precious  moments  may be lost when fire, police and other
 emergency personnel are unable to quickly  locate  those  in  need.  The
 legislature  therefore declares that it is necessary to require that all
 premises be identified through the display of their numerical address in
 a conspicuous location.
  § 2. The general municipal law is amended  by  adding  a  new  section
 125-b to read as follows:
  § 125-B.  STREET NUMBERS. 1. REQUIREMENTS. THE OWNER, AGENT, LESSEE OR
 OTHER  PERSON  IN  CHARGE  OF ANY BUILDING UPON A STREET TO WHICH STREET
 NUMBERS OF BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED, IN WHICH SUCH BUILDING IS SITU-
 ATED, SHALL CAUSE THE PROPER STREET NUMBER OR NUMBERS OF SUCH  BUILDINGS
 TO  BE DISPLAYED IN SUCH MANNER THAT THE STREET NUMBER OR NUMBERS MAY AT
 ALL TIMES BE PLAINLY LEGIBLE FROM THE SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF  SUCH  BUILD-
 ING. THE TERM "FRONT" AS USED IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO MEAN
 THAT  SIDE OF THE BUILDING WHICH FACES THE STREET ON WHICH THE NUMBER OR
 NUMBERS OF SUCH BUILDING, OR PREMISES ON WHICH SUCH  BUILDING  IS  SITU-
 ATED,  HAVE  BEEN  ALLOTTED. THE NUMBER OR NUMBERS SHALL BE DISPLAYED ON
 SUCH SIDE OF SUCH BUILDING OR PREMISES. EACH CITY SHALL HAVE  THE  POWER
 TO  ESTABLISH  AND  ENFORCE  RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE SIZE,
 FORM, VISIBILITY AND LOCATION OF STREET NUMBERS IN ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE
 REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  2.  VIOLATIONS.  IF THE OWNER, LESSEE, AGENT OR OTHER PERSON IN CHARGE
 OF ANY BUILDING IN ANY CITY UPON A STREET TO  WHICH  STREET  NUMBERS  OF
 BUILDINGS  HAVE  BEEN  ASSIGNED IN WHICH SUCH BUILDING IS SITUATED SHALL
 FAIL TO DISPLAY THE PROPER STREET NUMBER OF SUCH BUILDING,  AS  PROVIDED
 IN  THE  FOREGOING SUBDIVISION, THE CITY IN WHICH SUCH BUILDING IS SITU-
 ATED SHALL FORTHWITH SERVE SUCH PERSON OR PERSONS WITH A  COPY  OF  THIS
 SECTION,  AND  IF  AFTER THIRTY DAYS' NOTICE THE OWNER, LESSEE, AGENT OR
 OTHER PERSON IN CHARGE OF SUCH BUILDING SHALL FAIL OR NEGLECT TO  COMPLY
 WITH  THE PROVISIONS THEREOF, HE OR SHE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO A PENALTY OF
 TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS, WHICH SHALL BE SUED FOR AND COLLECTED IN  THE  NAME
 OF  THE CITY.  ANY PERSON WHO SHALL CONTINUE ANY SUCH VIOLATION SHALL BE
 PUNISHED BY AN ADDITIONAL  FINE  OF  FIVE  DOLLARS  FOR  EACH  DAY  SUCH
 VIOLATION SHALL CONTINUE.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
