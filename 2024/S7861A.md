 AN ACT in relation to authorizing  the  county  of  Nassau  assessor  to
  accept  an  application  for  a  real property tax exemption from Rock
  Community Church, Inc.
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Rock Community Church, Inc. an application for exemption from real prop-
 erty  taxes  pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax law with
 respect to the 2022-2023 assessment roll for all of the 2022-2023 school
 taxes and all of the 2023 general taxes for the  parcel  owned  by  such
 organization  located at Wheatley Road, village of Old Westbury, town of
 North Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county  tax
 map  section  19, block D, lots 221A and 221B. If accepted, the applica-
 tion shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxa-
 ble status date established for such assessment roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status date, the  assessor  of  the
 county  of  Nassau,  upon approval by the Nassau county legislature, may
 make appropriate correction to the subject roll. If  such  exemption  is
 granted  and  such organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax with
 respect to the subject  roll,  the  applicable  governing  body  or  tax
 department  may, in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of those
 taxes paid and cancel those taxes, fines, penalties, liens  or  interest
 remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
