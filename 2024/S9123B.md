 AN  ACT to amend the multiple dwelling law, in relation to the status of
  an interim multiple dwelling unit as a  protected  occupant's  primary
  residence
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  the findings in section 280 of the multiple dwelling law
 are reaffirmed; that the decision from  the  Appellate  Division,  First
 Department, in ONE DOUBLE NINE DASHING LLC V NEW YORK CITY LOFT BOARD ET
 AL.  (2022)  misinterpreted  the  relationship  of  primary residence to
 continued occupancy of potential protected occupants under  article  7-C
 of  the  multiple  dwelling law; that the unique illegal living arrange-
 ments of potential protected occupants prior to loft law coverage, with-
 out rent and eviction protections and without the applicability of mini-
 mum housing maintenance standards, necessitates  a  regulatory  approach
 which  is  not always the same as for other rent-regulated tenants; that
 the loft board properly concluded that the primary residence requirement
 in the statute is prospective from an application for protected occupan-
 cy or from registration of the unit with the loft board; that  the  loft
 board  properly considered all relevant evidence and rejected a position
 that statements on tax returns alone are determinative in making  deter-
 minations  regarding  primary  residence;  that  prior to DASHING (2022)
 neither the courts nor the loft board has looked at statements  made  on
 tax  returns  as controlling when evaluating issues of primary residence
 for loft tenants; that most  loft  tenants  use  for  business  purposes
 portions of their lofts, which the loft law envisions as being legalized
 and covered as joint live/work spaces, so long as the residential use is
 the  primary  use of the unit; and that it is necessary for the legisla-

 ture to correct the misinterpretation in DASHING (2022) and to  clarify,
 and  to codify in the law, what has been loft board policy and precedent
 based on the current law, loft board rules, and the loft board's  deleg-
 ated  expertise  for evaluating primary residence of potential protected
 occupants in possible interim multiple dwelling units.
  § 2. Paragraph (i) of subdivision 2 of section  286  of  the  multiple
 dwelling  law,  as  amended by chapter 4 of the laws of 2013, is amended
 and a new subdivision 14 is added to read as follows:
  (i) Prior to compliance with safety and fire protection  standards  of
 article  seven-B  of  this  chapter, residential occupants qualified for
 protection pursuant to this article shall be entitled to continued occu-
 pancy, provided that, SUBSEQUENT TO THE APPLICATION FOR PROTECTED  OCCU-
 PANCY WITH THE LOFT BOARD OR A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION OR REGIS-
 TRATION  WITH  THE  LOFT  BOARD  OF THE OCCUPANT'S UNIT PURSUANT TO THIS
 ARTICLE, the unit is their primary residence, and  shall  pay  the  same
 rent,  including  escalations, specified in their lease or rental agree-
 ment to the extent to which such lease or rental  agreement  remains  in
 effect  or, in the absence of a lease or rental agreement, the same rent
 most recently paid and accepted by the owner; if there is  no  lease  or
 other  rental  agreement  in  effect,  rent adjustments prior to article
 seven-B compliance shall be in conformity with guidelines to be  set  by
 the loft board for such residential occupants within six months from the
 effective date of this article.
  14.  IN  DETERMINING WHETHER A UNIT QUALIFIES FOR COVERAGE PURSUANT TO
 THIS ARTICLE, WHETHER AN OCCUPANT QUALIFIES FOR  PROTECTION  UNDER  THIS
 ARTICLE,  OR  WHETHER  A  REGISTERED INTERIM MULTIPLE DWELLING UNIT IS A
 PROTECTED OCCUPANT'S PRIMARY RESIDENCE FOR ALL PURPOSES UNDER THIS ARTI-
 CLE, NO SINGLE FACTOR SHALL BE SOLELY DETERMINATIVE, INCLUDING,  WITHOUT
 LIMITATION,  STATEMENTS  MADE  OR  ACTIONS TAKEN IN RELATION TO FEDERAL,
 STATE OR CITY TAX RETURNS.  EVIDENCE  WHICH  MAY  BE  CONSIDERED  SHALL
 INCLUDE,  BUT  NOT  BE  LIMITED  TO,  SPECIFICATION BY AN OCCUPANT OF AN
 ADDRESS OTHER THAN SUCH UNIT AS A PLACE OF RESIDENCE ON ANY TAX  RETURN,
 MOTOR  VEHICLE  REGISTRATION,  DRIVER'S  LICENSE OR OTHER DOCUMENT FILED
 WITH A GOVERNMENT AGENCY.  NO WAIVER OF RIGHTS  OTHERWISE  PROTECTED  BY
 THIS  SUBDIVISION, MADE PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION,
 SHALL BE ACCORDED ANY FORCE OR EFFECT.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately, and shall  apply  to  all
 pending actions or proceedings, including appeals.
