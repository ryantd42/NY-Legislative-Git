BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th Anniversary of Delorio's
  Foods, Inc., of Utica, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of Delorio's Foods, Inc.; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1924, Pasquale (Pat) and Giovanni (John) Delorio, with
their wives, started their own baking business; they built a  coal-fired
brick oven, purchased a mixer, and worked together in their bakery which
spanned the backyards of three two-family homes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  baking  crew expanded, and hearth-baked Italian bread
had begun sales in the bakery with house-to-house delivery; in 1926, the
first "Tomato Pie" made its debut, served at many weddings in East Utica
and sold to homes  and  stores;  the  first  bagged  Italian  bread  was
introduced in 1929; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the Great Depression, the Delorio family aided their
community by allowing local housewives to bake their own bread dough for
only  a penny per pound, and holiday turkeys and hams were baked free of
charge; also in the 1930s, the  first  traveling  stone  deck  oven  for
Italian  bread  was introduced; between 1932 and 1934, the first slice &
wrap Italian bread entered the marketplace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Delorio's  Foods,  Inc.,  moved  to  a  10,000-square-foot
facility  in 1948; to meet the growing demand, the first walk-in freezer
and stored baked bread appeared in the 1950s; and
 
  WHEREAS, To accommodate a customized automated system and three bulk
flour silos, Delorio's Foods, Inc., expanded to 22,000  square  feet  in
1970;  nine  years  later, the original ready-to-operate in-store bakery
system, including a training program, was developed and offered for sale
by the growing family business; this tremendous  stride  in  the  baking
industry  brought a unique convenience for independent grocery stores to
produce their own freshly baked breads with specialty proofers and small
ovens; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the 1980s, Delorio's Foods, Inc., added frozen dough  to
its  line  of  fresh products; this innovation launched the company into
the frozen wholesale food service  market;  throughout  the  1990s,  the
frozen  dough  and pizza market was the focal point of the industry, and
this rapidly expanding enterprise broadened its delivery from Utica, New
York, to the Mid-Atlantic region; by 1997, it was  time  to  move  to  a
90,000-square-foot facility; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over time, focusing on customers' needs and endeavoring to
meet those demands produced  a  successful  business  in  a  competitive
 
market;  during  the  2000s, there were numerous developments, including
private  labeling,  gluten-free  products,  national  locations,
international  shipping,  and  investment  in  the supply to some of the
largest retailers in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  progression  of  Delorio's  Foods, Inc., is in direct
correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its  owners  and  employees,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in all endeavors on behalf of the business and the community
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  immense  pride  that  the  hard-working  and
dedicated  staff  members  of  Delorio's  Foods,  Inc.,  celebrate  this
milestone 100th Anniversary and anticipate many more  years  of  success
for generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business, its contributions to  the  local
and  state  economies,  and its vibrant role in improving the quality of
life in its community, fully confident that it will  continue  to  enjoy
the  sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary of Delorio's Foods, Inc.; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Delorio's Foods, Inc.
