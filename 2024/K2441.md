  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2024, as Breast Cancer  Awareness  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Breast cancer is a substantial public health problem in the
United  States  and, as many recent studies point out, in New York State
particularly; and
 
  WHEREAS, Although mortality rates have fallen as knowledge about the
disease has increased, the number of breast cancer cases diagnosed  each
year still continues to rise; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Except  for skin cancers, breast cancer is the most common
type of cancer among women in the United States; it  is  estimated  that
281,550  new  cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in women in
the United States in 2021, and 43,600 women will die  from  the  disease
this  year; more than new 64,640 cases of non-invasive breast cancer are
also expected to occur among women this year; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, about 2,800 cases will  be  diagnosed  in  men
this  year  and about 530 men will die from breast cancer in 2024 in the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State  receives  more  research  awards  from  the
National  Institutes  of Health than any other state, except California;
is home to an important and  growing  biotechnology  industry;  and  has
quality  public  and  private  academic  and  research  institutions and
superior health services institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Self-administered breast examinations and  mammography  are
among the most effective and widely available methods of early detection
of breast cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Several new and promising technologies are being developed
to enhance the early detection of breast cancer, including:  ultrasound,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medi-photonics, new signal processing,
and several kinds of digital computer-enhanced images; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to emerging detection and screening techniques,
many  new  treatment  technologies are being explored, ranging from bone
marrow transplant procedures to new drug and hormone treatments; and
 
  WHEREAS, The knowledge and  understanding  of  human  genetics  have
advanced  in  the  last  decade,  and  with the identification of breast
cancer genes, information that may eventually lead to  better  detection
and treatment options may, however, raise many ethical questions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of statewide breast cancer organizations advocate
for increased funding  for  breast  cancer  research,  seek  to  promote
community and legislative awareness of breast cancer issues, and seek to
improve  access  to  breast  cancer  screening, diagnosis, treatment and
care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Concerns about how environmental factors may be related  to
the  cause  and  development  of breast cancer helped change the role of
women in the fight against breast cancer from inactive to proactive; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  enactment of New York State's Breast Cancer/Pesticide
Registry database law is aimed at finding the cause and hopefully a cure
for this tragic killer; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
reaffirm  its  commitment  to  promote  an environment that supports and
encourages vigorous research activities, and the institutions engaged in
those activities, to work toward the eradication of the disease; and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause further to reaffirm its
commitment to foster efforts directed at the advancement  of  detection,
diagnostic,  and  treatment  technologies  for  breast cancer; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause further to  reaffirm  its
commitment to provide women and their families with the resources needed
to  address  issues related to breast cancer, access to information, and
opportunity to interact with medical  experts,  researchers,  and  other
affected individuals and their families; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative Body pause further to memorialize
Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2024,  as  Breast  Cancer
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
