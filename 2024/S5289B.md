  2. THE CALCULATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH SERVICE CREDIT FOR  A  MEMBER
 WILL  BE  DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE ELIGIBLE SERVICE CREDITED IN THE
 NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN BY  A  SALARY
 MULTIPLIER,  REFLECTING  THE  RATE  OF  SALARY IN THE NEW YORK STATE AND
 LOCAL  EMPLOYEES'  RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN RELATIVE TO THE RATE OF SALARY

 AND  A BILLING RATE MULTIPLIER, REFLECTING THE ACTUARIAL LONG-TERM AVER-
 AGE BILLING RATE IN THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL  EMPLOYEES'  RETIREMENT
 SYSTEM  PLAN RELATIVE TO THE ACTUARIAL LONG-TERM AVERAGE BILLING RATE IN
 THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN. THE

  §  2. Section 343 of the retirement and social security law is amended

 SUBDIVISION, SUCH MEMBER ELECTS TO DO SO.  IF  THE  MEMBER  SUBSEQUENTLY
 TRANSFERS  BACK  TO  THE  NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT
 SYSTEM, THE FULL AMOUNT OF SERVICE CREDIT EARNED WHILE IN THE  TITLE  OF
 DEPUTY  SHERIFF  SHALL  BE  TRANSFERRED BACK TO NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL
 EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
  2. THE CALCULATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH SERVICE CREDIT FOR  A  MEMBER
 WILL  BE  DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE ELIGIBLE SERVICE CREDITED IN THE
 NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN BY  A  SALARY
 MULTIPLIER,  REFLECTING  THE  RATE  OF  SALARY IN THE NEW YORK STATE AND
 LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN RELATIVE TO THE RATE  OF  SALARY
 IN  THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN,
 AND A BILLING RATE MULTIPLIER, REFLECTING THE ACTUARIAL LONG-TERM  AVER-
 AGE  BILLING  RATE IN THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT

  3. IF THE MEMBER SUBSEQUENTLY RETIRES ON AN AGE BASED RETIREMENT  PLAN
 IN  THE  NEW  YORK  STATE  AND  LOCAL  POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM
 INSTEAD OF A TWENTY YEAR OR TWENTY-FIVE YEAR PLAN, THE  FULL  AMOUNT  OF

  4. NO MEMBER WHO RECEIVES SERVICE CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS  SUBDIVISION
 SHALL  BE  ELIGIBLE  TO  RECEIVE  ADDITIONAL  SERVICE CREDIT PURSUANT TO
 SUBDIVISION B OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR-E OF THIS ARTICLE  IF
 HIS OR HER EMPLOYER HAS ELECTED TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICE CREDIT.
  §  3. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth day after an internal
 revenue service ruling stating that the transfer and crediting of deputy
 sheriff service credit from the New  York  state  and  local  employees'
 retirement  system  into  the  New  York state and local police and fire
 retirement system special retirement plan by this act is  allowable  and
 does  not  jeopardize such retirement system's tax-qualified status, and
 shall remain in full force and effect only as long as such  transfer  is
 authorized  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of the internal revenue code;
 provided, that the state comptroller shall notify the  legislative  bill
 drafting  commission  upon  the  occurrence  of such ruling and upon any
 change in the provisions of the  internal  revenue  code  affecting  the
 provisions  of  this  act  in  order that the commission may maintain an
 accurate and timely effective data base of the official text of the laws
 of the state of New York in furtherance of effecting the  provisions  of
 section  44  of the legislative law and section 70-b of the public offi-
 cers law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would expand the  definition  of  creditable  service  under
 twenty-year and twenty-five-year retirement plans (special plans) in the
 New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS) to
 include service credit earned in the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS) for those individuals previously employed in
 the  title  of  Deputy  Sheriff.  To be eligible an individual must be a
 member of the NYSLPFRS and elect to transfer the NYSLERS service  credit
 to  the  NYSLPFRS special plan within twelve months of first joining the
 NYSLPFRS, or within twelve months of the effective date  of  this  bill,
 whichever is later. The amount of service credit granted in the NYSLPFRS
 special plan will be calculated by the Actuary of the New York State and
 Local  Retirement  System and will not exceed the service credited under
 the NYSLERS plan.
  Insofar as this bill affects the NYSLPFRS, if enacted during the  2024
 Legislative  Session,  it  is  estimated that the past service cost will
 average approximately 21 percent of an  affected  member's  compensation
 for each year of additional service credit that is granted.
  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  plan qualification issues: granting
 service credit towards retirement in a twenty-year plan in the  NYSLPFRS
 for  employment  that  was not rendered in the NYSLPFRS could jeopardize
 the governmental plan status of the Retirement System ("the System") and
 its exemption from the Employees Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).
 This development could result in the loss  of  qualified  status,  which
 would  mean  the  loss  of tax benefits. This result would substantially
 impair the System's value to our more than one million participants.
  This legislation will not become effective until the System obtains  a
 favorable  ruling  from  the IRS stating that these provisions would not
 harm the qualification status of the System. Further, the provisions  of
 this  legislation  will  only  continue  in  full force and effect while
 authorized by the IRS. It is estimated that the costs to obtain  such  a
 ruling would be $38,000 for the services of the IRS, and $1,000 per hour
 for legal consultants.
  In addition to the costs to obtain a ruling from the IRS stated above,
 if  this bill is enacted, there will be an administrative cost to imple-
 ment the provisions of this legislation.
 S. 5289--A  4
 
  All costs will be shared by the  State  of  New  York  and  the  local
 participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
