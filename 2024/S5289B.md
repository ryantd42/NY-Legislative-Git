  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  expand  the  definition of creditable service under
 twenty-year and twenty-five year retirement plans in the New York  State
 and  Local  Police  and  Fire  Retirement  System  (NYSLPFRS) to include
 service credit earned in the New York State and Local Employees' Retire-
 ment System (NYSLERS) for those individuals previously employed  in  the
 title of Deputy Sheriff and who provided police protection or correction
 officer  service.  To be eligible, an individual must be a member of the
 NYSLPFRS and must elect to transfer the NYSLERS service  credit  to  the
 NYSLPFRS  within  twelve months of first joining the NYSLPFRS, or within
 twelve months of the effective date of this bill,  whichever  is  later.
 The  amount of service credit granted in the NYSLPFRS will be calculated
 by the Actuary of the New York State and Local Retirement  System  based
 on  deputy sheriff service credited and the rate of salary earned in the
 NYSLERS and will not exceed the service credited under the NYSLERS plan.
  Insofar as this bill affects the NYSLPFRS, if enacted during the  2024
 Legislative  Session,  it  is  estimated that the past service cost will
 average approximately 21 percent of an  affected  member's  compensation
 for each year of additional service credit that is granted.
  All  costs  will  be  shared  by  the  State of New York and the local
 participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
