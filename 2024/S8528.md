  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 10 of section 210-A of the tax
 law, as added by section 16 of part A of chapter 59 of the laws of 2014,
 is amended to read as follows:
  (a)  Receipts  from  other  services  and  other  business  receipts.
 Receipts from services not addressed in subdivisions one through nine of
 this section and other business receipts not addressed in such  subdivi-
 sions  shall  be included in the numerator of the apportionment fraction
 if the location of the customer is within the state. Such receipts  from
 customers  within  and without the state are included in the denominator
 of the apportionment fraction. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS  PARAGRAPH,  TAXPAY-
 ERS, AND COMBINED GROUPS INCLUDING MEMBERS, ENGAGED IN PROVIDING PROFES-
 SIONAL  EMPLOYER  ORGANIZATION SERVICES SHALL INCLUDE WITH SUCH RECEIPTS
 AMOUNTS RECEIVED WITH RESPECT TO WAGES,  BENEFITS,  AND  OTHER  EMPLOYEE
 EXPENSES  DISBURSED TO OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF A CLIENT'S WORKSITE EMPLOY-
 EES AND THE  RELATED  EMPLOYMENT  TAXES  IF  THE  AMOUNTS  RECEIVED  ARE
 INCLUDED  IN THE CALCULATION OF THE BUSINESS INCOME BASE OR THE COMBINED
 BUSINESS INCOME BASE, RESPECTIVELY. Whether the receipts are included in
 the numerator of the apportionment fraction is determined  according  to
 the  hierarchy of method set forth in paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
 The taxpayer must exercise due diligence under each method described  in
 such paragraph (b) before rejecting it and proceeding to the next method
 in  the  hierarchy, and must base its determination on information known
 to the taxpayer or information that would be known to the taxpayer  upon
 reasonable inquiry.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all
 open tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2015.
