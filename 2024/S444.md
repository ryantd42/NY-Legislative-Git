 diction  of  the department of corrections and community supervision and

 A  population  base  for  such  a plan of [apportionment] DISTRICTING OR

 ble from an official enumeration done at the same time for all the resi-
 dents[,  citizens, or registered voters] of the local government. Such a
 plan may allocate, by extrapolation or any other rational  method,  such
 latest statistical information to representation areas or units of local
 government,  provided  that any plan containing such an allocation shall
 have annexed thereto as an appendix, a detailed explanation of the allo-
 cation.

 amended by adding a new paragraph g to read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
