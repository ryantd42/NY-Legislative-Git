  COMMEMORATING the 110th Anniversary of O'Scugnizzo
  Pizzeria of Utica, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to recognize
illustrious culinary establishments which have positively  impacted  and
substantially contributed to the vitality of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the 110th Anniversary of O'Scugnizzo Pizzeria of Utica, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The remarkable success of O'Scugnizzo Pizzeria  is  due  in
large  part  to  its  many  generations  of  prideful  owners  and their
dedicated staff, whose warmth and hospitality are easily  recognized  by
their  loyal  patrons;  this dynamic business is well-versed in customer
service and makes everyone  who  walks  through  their  door  feel  like
family; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  staff's  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,
characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
an  uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of
the business and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, O'Scugnizzo Pizzeria is  a  staple  of  the  greater  Utica
region  and  beyond;  deemed the second-oldest pizzeria in the nation in
2015, this business has  been  passed  down  through  generations  of  a
dedicated  family, all of whom have stepped up with pride and passion to
continue the enduring legacy of this revered establishment; and
 
  WHEREAS, Opened in 1914 by Eugeno Burlino, O'Scugnizzo Pizzeria came
from humble beginnings; the then-owner only sold tomato pies, which  are
pizzas without the mozzarella cheese, and each had cost only a nickel at
the time; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eugeno Burlino came to the United States from Naples, Italy
in  the late 1800's; he settled in Utica, New York, and worked hard as a
pastry chef before making the leap to  open  the  business  that  stands
today as a pillar of the Utica community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Following Eugeno's passing in 1958, his son, Angelo "Chops"
Burline  took over the business and crafted the pizzeria into the widely
known and loved establishment it is today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Angelo Burline changed the location of O'Scugnizzo Pizzeria
and expanded the menu to include sandwiches and salads in the 1960s; and
 
  WHEREAS, Current owners, Steven and Mike Burline,  sons  of  Angelo,
also have implemented updates and expansions, including franchising, and
have  licensed  the  name of the company to two outside owners for their
own Utica based restaurants; the shops receive ingredients from the same
sources  and  distributors  as  the  original  O'Scugnizzo  Pizzeria  to
maintain consistency; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, Mike Burline's son suggested bottling the O'Scugnizzo pizza
sauce and selling pizzas over the internet to any Utica natives who have
moved  from  the  region, and to fans of the pizzeria alike- a move that
has proved immensely successful for the business; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steven Burline describes one of their most  popular  pizzas
as  "upside  down";  on  a  sausage pie, the sausage goes on first, then
cheese, and is put in the oven to bake; after which,  the  sauce  and  a
sprinkling  of grated Romano cheese is added on top; this unique product
has driven several generations of fans through the doors; and
 
  WHEREAS, O'Scugnizzo Pizzeria serves as a testament  to  resilience,
strength,  dedication,  and  strong  values;  this storied establishment
deserves high praise for  its  unrelenting  commitment  to  serving  its
community  and  for  its  ability  to  adapt to changes and overcome any
adversities along the way; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional  business  and  its contributions to the
local and State economies, fully confident  that  it  will  continue  to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 110th Anniversary of O'Scugnizzo Pizzeria of Utica, New
York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to O'Scugnizzo Pizzeria.
