  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Wrestling Month in  the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  appreciate  the  great  athletic
competitions that enhance the lives of citizens in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 2024, as Wrestling
Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance  of
World Wrestling Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  May 2024 is World Wrestling Month; wrestling refers to the
sport of grappling with an opponent and trying to  throw  or  hold  them
down  on the ground; the practice dates back to ancient Sumeria, and the
Greeks introduced it to the ancient Olympics in 708  BC  as  a  form  of
soldiers' training; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  the  occasion,  United  World  Wrestling has launched
"ThisIsWrestling,"  a  social  media  campaign  asking  athletes,  fans,
coaches  and  members  of  the  wrestling  community to share photos and
videos of themselves related to wrestling; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2022, the U.S. Wrestling Foundation, a nationally  known
non-profit  organization,  officially  launched  the  first  national
"LetsWrestle" program to help more  high  school  students  prepare  for
success and overcome challenges through the principles of wrestling; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  campaign features prominent and nationally recognized
celebrities, who attribute the disciplines learned in wrestling as  part
of  their  professional success; this includes actors and actresses from
Hollywood, athletes from the NFL and other sports, business leaders  and
scientists, NASA astronauts, and IndyCar drivers, among others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Wrestling  is  currently  the sixth most popular boys high
school sport and is the fastest growing girls high school sport; and
 
  WHEREAS, This month we celebrate the over two millenniums old  sport
of wrestling worldwide and in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to celebrate the historic sport of wrestling; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 2024, as Wrestling
Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
