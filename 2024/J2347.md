BY: Senator RIVERA
 
  CELEBRATING  the  125th  Anniversary  of the Bronx
  Zoo, an iconic New York landmark that has  become  a
  cultural  and  educational  leader,  a  conservation
  giant, and a gateway to nature, for more than half a
  billion visitors
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  the anniversary of an institution that has a profound impact in
its community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the Bronx Zoo on Friday, November  8,
2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1898, the City of New York allotted 265 acres of Bronx
Park to the New York  Zoological  Society  to  build  a  park  aimed  at
preserving native animals and promoting zoology; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Bronx Zoo (formally the New York Zoological Park) first
opened  its  doors  on  November 8, 1899, and has dedicated the last 125
years to educating millions about animals and the places they live while
working to protect wildlife and nature around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Bronx Zoo has remained as the largest urban zoo in  the
United  States  and  is home to 4,000 animals representing more than 650
species; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Bronx Zoo's long standing conservation efforts have had
a number of firsts beginning in the early 1900s: in 1901, the Bronx  Zoo
became  a  pioneer  in  zoological  health  care  by  opening  the first
veterinary department at a U.S. zoological park; in 1903, the Bronx  Zoo
became  the  first  zoo  to exhibit snow leopards and the zoo has had 80
snow leopard births since, more than any other zoo in North America;  in
1905,  the  American  Bison  Society  was  founded  at the Bronz Zoo and
efforts began to breed bison at the zoo  and  reintroduce  them  to  the
wild,  preventing  the species extinction; in 1929, the Bronx Zoo opened
its first wildlife education department teaching zoology,  conservation,
and  natural  history  to  visitors and students; in 1941, the Bronx Zoo
opened  African  Plains,  the  first  ecologically  representative  open
habitat  exhibit in North America; and in 1946, the Bronx Zoo became the
first U.S. zoo to exhibit Pere David's deer and began a breeding program
for the species which was extinct in the wild, ultimately these  captive
breeding  and  reintroduction  programs  saved  this  species from total
extinction; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the late 20th  century,  the  Bronx  Zoo  continued  its
efforts  and in 1963, the Wildlife Conservation Society's Exhibition and
Graphic Arts Department became the first of  its  kind  in  any  zoo  or
aquarium to uniquely combine architecture, landscape and exhibit design,
and  interpretation  to  create  exhibits that allow visitors to observe
animals behaving as they would in  nature;  in  1985,  the  Bronx  Zoo's
Wildlife  Health  Center  opened  as  a  state-of-the-art  teaching  and
 
research hospital for zoological medicine, which also  happened  in  the
same  year  of  the  first-ever  successful zoo birth of a false gharial
(A.K.A. Sunda gharial), also taking place at the Bronx Zoo; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Now, in the 21st century, the Bronx Zoo continues to reach
milestones: in 2007, beavers began to return to the Bronx River near the
Bronx Zoo for the first  time  in  over  200  years  due  to  the  river
restoration  efforts  of the Bronx Zoo and Bronx River Alliance; by 2012
through a collaborative effort, the Bronx Zoo reintroduced  over  10,000
captive  bred  Kihansi  spray  toads to their native habitat in Tanzania
after the species went extinct in the wild a few years  earlier  due  to
placement  of  a  hydroelectric dam; in 2012, the first genetically-pure
bison born by embryo transfer was born at the Bronx Zoo; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Bronx Zoo is the largest youth employer in the  borough
of  the  Bronx,  providing  valuable  opportunities  while  helping  to
transform lives in one of the most underserved  communities;  internship
opportunities  provided  by  the  Wildlife  Conservation Society include
animal care, science research, youth advocacy, human resources,  science
education,  exhibits  and  graphic arts, veterinary and vet tech student
clinical externships, and library and archives with over 300 internships
offered each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Bronx  Zoo  remains  steadfast  in  its  commitment  to
community  service,  actively  engaging  with organizations and agencies
through partnerships and extending inclusive access to all New  Yorkers;
this  commitment  is demonstrated by providing free or pay-what-you-wish
admission on designated days, including Free Wednesdays, to  accommodate
the  diverse  needs  of  the  city's  residents, including New York City
school groups, college students, and underserved youth and seniors; and
 
  WHEREAS, On April 18, 2024, the Bronx Zoo marked 125 years with  the
opening  of  its Animal Chronicles Exhibit, a new immersive exhibit that
leads visitors through a quarter-mile ADA-accessible walking trail  that
includes  68 eco-sculptures displayed across 13 scenes; the exhibit will
be open to the public on April 20, 2024, and each scene tells  the  tale
of  how the zoo became a leader in caring for animals, saving endangered
species,  designing  exhibits  that  connect  people  to  nature,  and
protecting wildlife around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Bronx  Zoo is a world-renowned leader in the areas of
animal welfare, husbandry,  veterinary  care,  education,  science,  and
conservation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the Bronx Zoo,  an  iconic  New  York
landmark  that  has  become  a  cultural  and  educational  leader,  a
conservation giant, and a gateway  to  nature,  for  more  than  half  a
billion visitors, on November 8, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Bronx Zoo.
