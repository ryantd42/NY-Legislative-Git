  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 21, 2023, as Agriculture Day in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Hardworking  American  farmers provide New York State, the
Nation, and much of the world with  a  safe,  healthy,  affordable,  and
abundant food supply; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Farmers  boost  our  local  economies by spending locally,
attracting tourism, and keeping money in our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Agriculture is at the intersection of food, family, health,
community, environment, nature,  science,  homeland  security,  economic
concerns, and other significant things we care about; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  vast  majority  of  farms  and  ranches in the United
States, and especially in New York State, are family owned and  operated
and have deep historical roots in their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Farmers  provide  fresh,  locally  grown food to our urban
neighborhoods through an increasing number of farmers markets, CSAs, and
urban farms, improving food options in our cities  and  creating  better
understanding between urban and rural communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Farmers can be important stewards of our natural resources,
ensuring  clean  water,  healthy  soils  and  increased use of renewable
energy with sound, sustainable agricultural practices; and
 
  WHEREAS, Agriculture in New York State generates over $5  billion  a
year  in  commodity  sales and creates 196,000 jobs on and off the farm;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Though the average age of an American farmer is  still  57,
young  and  beginning farmers are literally putting down roots to be the
next generation to feed our families, and returning veterans are finding
new and healing ways to rebuild their lives through agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration  of  National  Agriculture  Day  is  in
recognition  of  farmers  from  all  racial,  ethnic  and socio-economic
backgrounds and walks of life, who feed us and our  families  every  day
and  of  the  importance of agriculture as a vital industry and economic
driver in New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  21,  2023, as
Agriculture Day in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance  of  National  Agriculture  Day, honoring and recognizing the
important contributions of  all  branches  of  farming  to  the  health,
economic  well-being, environment, beauty, and future of New York State;
and
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
