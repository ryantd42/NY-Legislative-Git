  COMMEMORATING  Niska-Day  43  in  the  Town  of
  Niskayuna on May 18, 2024
 
  WHEREAS It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize  and
commend local governments for organizing events which help promote local
business  and  provide  a  family  friendly  environment to bring people
together; and
 
  WHEREAS Attendant to  such  concern,  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 43rd Annual  Niska-Day  in  the  Town  of  Niskayuna  on
Saturday, May 18, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Niska-Day  starts  out  with  a  parade  in  Old Niskayuna
followed by a  full-day  of  family  entertainment,  rides,  games,  and
delicious food at Craig School fields, culminating with an evening grand
fireworks display; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  annual  Niska-Day  celebration, an event with over 25
sponsors, was established in 1980  by  the  Niskayuna  Community  Action
Program (N-CAP), responding to a school district report on mental health
needs, and its purpose was to reinforce shared community identification;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  When  the  County  of  Schenectady  was carved from Albany
County on March 6, 1809, much of Niskayuna's original area was ceded  to
other towns; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Niskayuna, with just 681 residents, became one of the five
towns and one  city  that  comprised  the  new  County  of  Schenectady;
adjustments  to  its  western  boundary  made  in the early 20th century
decreased the Town's area to its current 15.1 square miles; and
 
  WHEREAS, Adjustments to Niskayuna's western  boundary  made  in  the
early  20th century decreased the Town's area to its current 15.1 square
miles; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1962, Niskayuna became a town  of  the  First  Class,  a
formal  state  designation, and then in 1975, attained a status of still
higher autonomy, that of Suburban Town; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Niskayuna offers all of the services of a city  with
its population of 23,278 according to the 2020 census; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chairpersons  Jay  and  Rachel  Rourke spearhead an effort
perfectly executed  by  members  of  the  Niska-Day  Committee  to  make
Niska-Day  a successful event enjoyed by town residents as well as those
from surrounding communities in the Capital Region; now,  therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate Niska-Day 43 in the Town of Niskayuna on May 18,  2024;  and
be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the members of the 2024 Niska-Day Committee.
