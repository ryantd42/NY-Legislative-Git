  Section  1.  For  the  purposes  of  this act: "Short-term residential
 rental property" shall mean a residential home, unit therein, or  acces-
 sory building that is leased on a daily or weekly basis, with the gener-
 al  duration of rental not exceeding thirty consecutive days. Hotels and

 lation; and

  § 2. A temporary state commission, to be known as the New  York  state
 short-term rental property commission (hereafter "commission") is hereby
 created to assess the current housing stock in the state of New York and
 the  state  of short-term residential rental property. Specifically, the
 commission shall investigate:
  (a) the current housing stock in the state of New York broken down  by

 housing stock and economies;
  (f) current state, federal, and local laws relating to use of residen-
 tial property as short-term rental units;
  (g)  laws  and  policies  of  other  states  and  jurisdictions
 impacting/restricting short-term residential rental properties; and
  (h) recommendations as to the need  for  changes  to  local  or  state

 zoning law, enforcement of local code  and  remedies  to  violations  of
 applicable local or state laws.
  §  3.  The  commission shall address the impact short-term residential
 rentals have on residents, neighborhoods, as well as on crime and police
 activity and on the culture of neighborhoods and communities  of  inter-
 est.
  § 4. (a) The commission shall consist of eight members to be appointed
 as  follows:  two  shall  be appointed by the temporary president of the
 senate; two shall be appointed by the minority leader of the senate; two
 shall be appointed by the speaker of the  assembly;  and  two  shall  be
 appointed  by  the  minority  leader  of the assembly. Each member shall
 serve at the pleasure of the officer making such  appointment,  and  any
 vacancy in membership shall be filled in the same manner provided for in
 the original appointments.
  (b)  The  members shall receive no compensation for their services but
 shall be allowed their actual and necessary  expenses  incurred  in  the
 performance  of their duties hereunder. The commission may employ and at
 pleasure remove such personnel as it may deem necessary for the perform-
 ance of its functions and fix their compensation within the amounts made
 available by appropriation therefor.
  (c) Such membership on the commission shall not constitute the holding
 of a public office.

 capitol  building  at  a  time and place specified by the speaker of the
 assembly; provided that such meeting occurs no later than one year after

 shall  elect  a chair and vice-chair upon a majority vote of the member-
 ship. Following the election of such  chair,  all  future  meetings  and
 hearings of the commission shall be called at the chair's discretion. In
 the absence of the chair, such authority shall be exercised by the vice-
 chair.
  §  6.  The commission shall make recommendations and a final report of
 its findings no later than December thirteenth, two thousand twenty-six.
 The report shall be provided to the legislature  and  attorney  general.

 and/or state policy and laws relating to short-term residential rentals.
 Such report shall also provide model  local  law  language  for  munici-
 palities  to  use  if  they currently have no code for short-term rental
 property regulation, and guidance on proper mechanism on enforcement  of
 local law regarding short-term rental property ownership and use.
  §  7. This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire December
 31, 2026 when upon such date the provisions of this act shall be  deemed
 repealed.
