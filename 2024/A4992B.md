  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  criminal  procedure  law  is amended by adding a new
 section 60.77 to read as follows:
 § 60.77 RULES OF EVIDENCE; ADMISSIBILITY OF DEFENDANT COMMITTING ANOTHER
  SEXUAL OFFENSE IN A SEXUAL OFFENSE CASE.
  1. IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A DEFENDANT IS ACCUSED OF A SEXU-
 AL OFFENSE, THE COURT MAY ADMIT EVIDENCE THAT  THE  DEFENDANT  COMMITTED
 ANY  OTHER SEXUAL OFFENSE. SUCH EVIDENCE MAY BE CONSIDERED ON ANY MATTER
 TO WHICH IT IS RELEVANT, INCLUDING TO PROVE THAT THE DEFENDANT ACTED  IN
 CONFORMITY  THEREWITH  OR HAD A PROPENSITY TO ENGAGE IN SIMILAR WRONGFUL
 ACTS.
  2. THE COURT, IN ITS DISCRETION, MAY  EXCLUDE  SUCH  EVIDENCE  IF  ITS
 PROBATIVE VALUE IS OUTWEIGHED BY THE PROBABILITY THAT ITS ADMISSION WILL
 CREATE UNDUE PREJUDICE TO THE DEFENDANT.
  3. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "SEXUAL OFFENSE" SHALL INCLUDE AN ACT
 COMMITTED  IN  ANY  JURISDICTION THAT INVOLVES CONDUCT PROSCRIBED BY ANY
 SECTION OF ARTICLE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE PENAL LAW,  OR  BY  SECTION
