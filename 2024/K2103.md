  WELCOMING and paying tribute to the members of the
  Yankasa Association of New York upon the occasion of
  their  visit  to the Legislative Chambers of the New
  York State Capitol in Albany, New York,  on  May  6,
  2024
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social, and
educational  benefits  they confer, play a vital role in the development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  take  note  of
certain  individuals  and  organizations  whose spiritual lives and holy
actions serve to inspire and aid members of their ethnic  and  religious
communities,  and  indeed,  many  others across our State and Nation and
throughout the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
welcome and pay tribute to the members of the Yankasa Association of New
York upon the occasion of their visit to the Legislative Chambers of the
New York State Capitol in Albany, New York, on May 6, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Yankasa  Association  of  New  York  is  a  community-based
organization  dedicated  to  providing  a variety of resources to Muslim
immigrants from Ghana and West Africa in  the  Bronx;  operations  range
from  social  groups  to  food  distribution,  education,  and recurring
religious services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  benevolent  organization  was  founded  in  1984  in
response  to  the  confusion,  fear,  and  lack  of  knowledge regarding
immigration status and laws, as well as a confusion regarding the  civil
rights afforded to every individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Yankasa  Association of New York remains open every day to
cater to its local community's needs; it  boasts  multiple  rooms  which
serve different purposes, one of which is a mosque where local residents
can safely and comfortably pray multiple times a day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Yankasa  also has a council of elders and Islamic teachers
who provide marriage counseling and many other social services; and
 
  WHEREAS, When a  community  member  falls  ill,  the  organization's
members band together to provide help in a variety of capacities, and in
unfortunate cases of a death, they contribute to burial services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Yankasa  Association  of  New  York  pridefully hosts many
events, such as the Islamic Naming Ceremonies, a  "social  gathering  to
bless  the  kid, pray islamically" and generally celebrate the child and
his or her families; and
 
  WHEREAS, Yankasa Association of New York stands on the threshold  of
tomorrow,  prepared  to  meet the challenges of the coming decades while
retaining that spiritual resolve which characterizes its past; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the custom of this Legislative Body to take note of
enduring religious institutions and to bring such  institutions  to  the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
welcome and pay tribute to the members of the Yankasa Association of New
York upon the occasion of their visit to the Legislative Chambers of the
New York State Capitol in Albany, New York on May 6,  2024;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the visiting members of the Yankasa  Association  of  New
York.
