 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 tate the usual and special uses of the highways and other motor  vehicle
 facilities  accorded  to [severely disabled] residents WITH SEVERE DISA-
 BILITIES of this state. The commissioner is hereby empowered to issue to
 such persons, upon their application, special  motor  vehicle  registra-
 tions,  [one set of] vehicle identification plates for EACH motor [vehi-
 cles] VEHICLE owned by such persons to be used for the transportation of
 such [severely disabled] person [and one set of  vehicle  identification

 certification of registration, in such form as  the  commissioner  shall
 prescribe  and  two  number  plates  PER  VEHICLE OWNED BY SUCH PERSONS,
 called [disabled]  person  WITH  DISABILITIES  plates.  Said  [disabled]
 person  WITH  DISABILITIES  plates  shall conform to the requirements of
 section four hundred one of this chapter,  but  shall  bear  distinctive
 marks  to  distinguish  them  from  number  plates to be issued to other
 persons, qualifying  under  this  chapter.  [The  commissioner,  in  his
 discretion,  may  issue,  for any registration year, only one plate as a
 set for a motor vehicle, in which event a set of disabled person  plates
 for  a  motor vehicle shall consist of one plate. Where a severely disa-
 bled person owns more than one vehicle and such vehicle or  vehicles  is
 or  are  used  by  severely  disabled  members of the owner's family who
 reside with the owner, the commissioner shall issue one  set  of  plates
 for  each  additional  vehicle  used  by  such severely disabled person,
 provided that such user qualifies as a severely disabled person  in  the
 manner required by this section.]
  §  3.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law provided, however,  that  effective  immediately,  the
 addition,  amendment and/or repeal of any rules or regulations necessary
 for the implementation of this act on its effective date  is  authorized
 and directed to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
