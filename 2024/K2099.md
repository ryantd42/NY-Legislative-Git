  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body that the quality
of life of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched  by
its exceptional cultural, educational and recreational institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the  Pat  II, the Finger Lakes

boat to Boldt Castle in Alexandria Bay, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the Pat II traveled with

  WHEREAS,  The  success of the Pat II is in direct correlation to the
efforts of its dedicated staff and leadership, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
institutions of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought  to  our
attention,  they  should be recognized and applauded by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the  Pat  II, the Finger Lakes
Boating Museum's flagship tour boat on May 18, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
