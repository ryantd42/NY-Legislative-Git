  EXPECTED INCREASE (DECREASE) IN ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES

  Present Value (PV)  FIRE
  PV of Benefits:  277,000
  PV of Employee Contributions:  0

  Number of Payments:  1
  Fiscal Year of Last Payment:  2026
  Amortization Payment:  307,000
  Since  Mr.  Floyd  is deceased, and therefore has no remaining working
 lifetime, the entire increase in Unfunded  Accrued  Liability  would  be
 recognized immediately.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on salary data
 provided by the New York City Fire Pension  Fund  (FIRE).  The  Ordinary
 Death  Benefit estimated is based on Mr. Floyd's earnings in his last 12
 months of service of approximately $92,200.  The  salary  data  was  not
 audited but was reviewed for reasonableness.
  BACKGROUND:  Former New York City probationary firefighter Derek Floyd
 died on April 15, 2024, after his employment with the New York City Fire
 Department ceased on November 9, 2023, so that  his  beneficiaries  were
 not entitled to the Ordinary Death Benefit afforded to members in active
 service.
  This proposed legislation would treat Mr. Floyd as an active member at
 the  time  of his death, entitling his beneficiary to an additional lump
 sum death benefit equal to three times his final year's earnings, round-
 ed up to the nearest $1,000.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-

 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
