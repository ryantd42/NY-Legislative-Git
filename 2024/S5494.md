 AN ACT to amend the civil service  law,  in  relation  to  crediting  of
  probationary service
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 63 of the civil  service  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  175  of  the  laws  of 1989, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. Every original appointment to a position in the  competitive  class
 and  every interdepartmental promotion from a position in one department
 or agency to a position in another department or agency shall be  for  a
 probationary  term;  provided,  however,  that  upon  interdepartmental
 promotion the appointing officer may waive the requirement of  satisfac-
 tory  completion  of  the  probationary  term.  The  state civil service
 commission and municipal civil service commissions may provide, by rule,
 for probationary service upon intradepartmental promotion  to  positions
 in  the  competitive  class  and  upon  appointment  to positions in the
 exempt, non-competitive or labor classes.
  When probationary service is required  upon  promotion,  the  position
 formerly  held  by  the person promoted shall be held open [for him] and
 shall not be filled, except on a temporary basis, pending completion  of
 his probationary term.
  Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any other law or rule to the contra-
 ry, when a permanent appointment or  promotion  to  a  position  in  the
 competitive class is conditioned upon the completion of a term of train-
 ing  service  or  of  a period of service in a designated trainee title,
 such service and the probationary term  for  such  competitive  position
 shall run concurrently.
  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE FOREGOING OR ANY LAW OR RULE TO THE CONTRARY, ANY
 PERSON APPOINTED PROVISIONALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION SIXTY-FIVE  OF

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
