  HONORING  Lee and Marlene Carver upon the occasion
  of their designation for special recognition by  the
  New York State Office for the Aging on May 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly  proud  to  honor  Lee  and
Marlene  Carver  upon  the  occasion  of  their  designation for special
recognition by the New York State Office for the Aging on  Tuesday,  May
14,  2024,  at the Hart Theatre Lounge at The Egg Performing Arts Center
in Albany, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each May, the New York State Office for the Aging pauses to
acknowledge the outstanding contributions made by older citizens  during
National Older Americans Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of  older generations have helped build and shape
our Nation to be the greatest in  the  world;  they  have  defended  our
freedoms  and  values  to ensure that those who come after them may have
better lives; nowhere in the Nation is the legacy of their efforts  more
visible  and  more  a part of the lives of all citizens than here in the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lee  and  Marlene  Carver  have  continually  demonstrated
extreme  competence, extraordinary intelligence, and diligent leadership
in their unwavering service to the  community  and,  consequently,  have
been selected for this most prestigious honor; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ever active in their community, Lee and Marlene Carver have
been  volunteering  for  12  years  at the Dekalb Hermon Senior Citizens
Club; Marlene's role as treasurer of the Senior Citizens Club and  Lee's
tenure  as  the  activities  coordinator  highlight  their  proactive
involvement in organizing and facilitating community  events  and  their
tremendous commitment to their community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Deeply rooted in the North Country, Lee and Marlene Carver
organize picnics, host events at their camp in  Colton,  New  York,  and
spread  holiday  cheer  through  thoughtful  gestures  like distributing
Christmas bags to fellow community members; and
 
  WHEREAS, With over 40 years of service collectively, Marlene  Carver
has  volunteered as village historian for the Village of Hermon and as a
member of the Hermon Ladies Auxiliary for 20 years; Lee Carver has  been
involved  with  the  Dekalb Chamber of Commerce and has served as a fire
district commissioner and member of the Hermon Town Board; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by
individuals  for the benefit of others which Lee and Marlene Carver have
displayed throughout their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lee and Marlene Carver have enriched  the  lives  of  their
family,  friends  and  colleagues  through  their  love  and respect for
others, and through the wisdom which comes from  many  years  of  living
life to the fullest; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Lee and Marlene Carver upon the occasion of their designation  for
special  recognition  by  the New York State Office for the Aging on May
14, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Lee Carver and Marlene Carver.
