  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 21-25, 2024, as National School  Bus  Safety
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to ensure that the complete history  of
our  State  and  Nation  is  preserved  and  shared  with  the  present
generations of citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October  21-25,  2024,  as
National School Bus Safety Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Studies  have  proven  that the most dangerous part of the
school bus ride for children is when they get on and off the bus; it  is
important  to  remember  to pay close attention to school buses when you
see them driving on the street and teach children how to  be  safe  when
boarding and exiting the bus; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  October,  the  Governor's  Traffic Safety Committee
(GTSC) and state and  local  safety  partners  participate  in  National
School Bus Safety Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, National School Bus Safety Week is an opportunity to engage
parents,  students,  teachers,  motorists,  school bus operators, school
administrators, and other interested parties to join forces and  address
the importance of school bus safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State transports 2.3 million children with more
than 50,000 school buses to school every year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Operation Safe Stop is a  program  that  seeks  to  promote
school bus safety through education and enforcement efforts; the goal is
to  proactively  educate  motorists about the dangers of passing stopped
school buses; it is a cooperative project supported by  GTSC,  New  York
Association  for  Pupil  Transportation  (NYAPT),  the  New  York  State
Education Department (NYSED), the New York State School Bus  Contractors
Association,  the  student  transportation  industry, and state, county,
city and local law enforcement agencies; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim October 21-25, 2024, as
National School Bus Safety Week in the State of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
