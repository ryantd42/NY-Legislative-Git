Assembly Resolution No. 947
 
BY: M. of A. Seawright
 
  CALLING  for  ratification  of  the  Equal  Rights
  Amendment
 
  WHEREAS, The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly  guarantee  equal
rights to all persons regardless of sex; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), first proposed in 1923,
is an amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  that  guarantees
equality of rights under the law for all persons regardless of sex; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Equal  Rights  Amendment  was  written  in  1921  by
suffragist Alice Paul; it has been introduced in Congress every  session
since  1923;  it  passed Congress in the above form in 1972, but was not
ratified by the necessary thirty-eight states by the July 1982 deadline;
it was ratified by thirty-five states; and
 
  WHEREAS, The ERA has met both requirements under Article V of the US
Constitution passing 2/3rds of both houses of Congress and  ratified  by
3/4ths of the States (38); and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  1  U.S.C.  section  106b,  Congress has charged the
Archivist of the United States with the responsibility  to  publish  new
constitutional amendments upon receiving official notice of ratification
from the requisite number of states; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Article  V  of  the Constitution imposes no time limit for
ratification of amendments; Supreme Court decisions have recognized  the
power  of  Congress  to  determine  the  mode  of ratification; the 1992
ratification of the 27th ("Madison") Amendment 203 years  after  it  was
first  proposed  supports  the premise that state ERA ratification votes
since 1972 are sufficiently contemporaneous; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 17, 2021, the U.S House of Representatives  passed
HJ  Res  17  to  remove  the  deadline for the ratification of the Equal
Rights Amendment; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January 27, 2022,  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives
introduced  a  resolution recognizing the Equal Rights Amendment has met
all requirements to be affirmed as the 28th Amendment; and
 
  WHEREAS, The President of the United States Joseph R. Biden Jr.  has
urged  Congress to pass a resolution recognizing the ratification of the
Equal Rights Amendment; and
 
  WHEREAS, On July 13, 2023,  Representative  Cori  Bush  and  Senator
Kirsten  Gillibrand  submitted a Joint Resolution verifying that the ERA
is fully ratified and effective, and that it can and must  be  published
by  the  Archivist  in  the United States Constitution as the valid 28th
Amendment; and
 
  WHEREAS, A leader in advocating for women's equality, New York State
has championed paid family leave, equal pay for equal work,  and  issues
that face pregnant women in the workforce; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
call on the US Archivist to certify and  publish  the  ERA;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the President of the Senate of  the  United  States,  the
Speaker  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  and to each member of the
Congress of the United States from the State of New York.
