 AND  A NUMBER PLATE ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER WITH A NUMBER CORRESPOND-
 ING TO THAT OF THE CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
  2.  SUCH  LICENSE  PLATES  SHALL BE OF SUCH MATERIAL, FORM, DESIGN AND
 DIMENSIONS AND CONTAIN OR SET FORTH SUCH DISTINGUISHING NUMBER OR  OTHER
 IDENTIFICATION  MARKS  AS  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL PRESCRIBE, PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER, THAT THERE SHALL BE AT ALL TIMES A MARKED CONTRAST BETWEEN  THE
 COLOR  OF THE NUMBER PLATES AND THAT OF THE NUMERALS OR LETTERS THEREON,
 AND PROVIDED FURTHER THAT NO ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE  MOTORCYCLE

  3. EACH SUCH LICENSE PLATE SHALL BE  CONSPICUOUSLY  DISPLAYED  ON  THE
 REAR  OF  THE  ELECTRIC  SCOOTER  OR  LIMITED  USE  MOTORCYCLE, SECURELY
 FASTENED SO AS TO PREVENT THE SAME FROM SWINGING.
  4. THE FEE FOR SUCH LICENSE PLATES SHALL BE A NOMINAL  FEE  DETERMINED
 BY THE COMMISSIONER.
  §  1291.  LIABILITY INSURANCE. 1. IN A CITY HAVING A POPULATION OF ONE
 MILLION OR MORE, EVERY  ELECTRIC  SCOOTER  AS  DEFINED  IN  SECTION  ONE
 HUNDRED  FOURTEEN-E  OF THIS CHAPTER AND EVERY LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE AS
 DEFINED IN SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE-B  OF  THIS  CHAPTER  THAT  IS
 OPERATED ON PUBLIC ROADS OR ON PROPERTY OTHER THAN ON LANDS OF THE OWNER
 OF THE SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE SHALL BE COVERED BY A POLICY OF
 INSURANCE,  IN  SUCH LANGUAGE AND FORM AS SHALL BE DETERMINED AND ESTAB-
 LISHED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, ISSUED BY AN  INSUR-
 ANCE  CARRIER AUTHORIZED TO DO BUSINESS IN THIS STATE. SUCH POLICY SHALL
 PROVIDE FOR COVERAGES REQUIRED OF AN "OWNER'S POLICY OF LIABILITY INSUR-
 ANCE" AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION FOUR OF SECTION THREE
 HUNDRED ELEVEN OF THIS CHAPTER. IN LIEU OF SUCH  INSURANCE  COVERAGE  AS
 HEREINABOVE  PROVIDED,  THE  COMMISSIONER,  IN HIS OR HER DISCRETION AND
 UPON APPLICATION OF A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY HAVING REGISTERED IN ITS  NAME
 ONE  OR MORE ELECTRIC SCOOTERS OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLES, MAY WAIVE THE
 REQUIREMENT OF INSURANCE BY A PRIVATE  INSURANCE  CARRIER  AND  ISSUE  A
 CERTIFICATE  OF  SELF-INSURANCE,  WHEN  HE OR SHE IS SATISFIED THAT SUCH
 GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY IS POSSESSED OF  FINANCIAL  ABILITY  TO  RESPOND  TO
 JUDGMENTS  OBTAINED  AGAINST  IT,  ARISING  OUT OF THE OWNERSHIP, USE OR
 OPERATION OF SUCH ELECTRIC SCOOTERS  OR  LIMITED  USE  MOTORCYCLES.  THE
 COMMISSIONER  MAY  ALSO  WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT OF INSURANCE BY A PRIVATE
 INSURANCE CARRIER AND ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OF SELF-INSURANCE UPON  APPLI-
 CATION  OF ANY PERSON OR ANY OTHER CORPORATION, HAVING REGISTERED IN ITS
 NAME, ONE OR MORE ELECTRIC  SCOOTERS  OR  LIMITED  USE  MOTORCYCLES  AND
 FURNISHING OF PROOF THAT A CERTIFICATE OF SELF-INSURANCE HAS BEEN ISSUED
 AND  IS  IN  EFFECT  PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED
 SIXTEEN OF THIS CHAPTER.
  2. PROOF OF INSURANCE AS REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION  SHALL  BE  PRODUCED
 AND  DISPLAYED  BY  THE  OWNER  OR  OPERATOR OF SUCH ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR
 LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE UPON THE REQUEST OF ANY MAGISTRATE OR ANY  PERSON
 HAVING  AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CHAPTER. THE FAILURE
 TO PRODUCE SUCH PROOF UPON THE REQUEST OF ANY SUCH PERSON SHALL  NOT  BE
 AN  OFFENSE BUT SHALL BE PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH ELECTRIC SCOOTER
 OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE IS BEING OPERATED WITHOUT HAVING  SUCH  INSUR-
 ANCE IN FORCE AND EFFECT.
  3.  PROOF  OF  INSURANCE AS REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION SHALL BE PRODUCED
 AND DISPLAYED BY THE OWNER OR  OPERATOR  OF  SUCH  ELECTRIC  SCOOTER  OR
 LIMITED  USE MOTORCYCLE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS SUFFERED OR CLAIMS TO HAVE
 SUFFERED EITHER PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE AS A  RESULT  OF  THE
 OPERATION  OF  SUCH  ELECTRIC  SCOOTER  OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE BY THE
 OWNER OR OPERATOR, IF SUCH INSURANCE COVERAGE  WAS  REQUIRED  UNDER  THE
 A. 7982--A  3
 
 CIRCUMSTANCES  OF  SUCH OPERATION. IT SHALL BE AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO
 ANY PROSECUTION FOR A VIOLATION OF THIS SUBDIVISION THAT SUCH PROOF  WAS
 SO PRODUCED OR DISPLAYED WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF RECEIVING NOTICE OF
 SUCH INJURY OR DAMAGE, OR THE CLAIM OF SUCH INJURY OR DAMAGE.
  4.  NO  OWNER  OF  AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE SHALL
 OPERATE OR PERMIT THE SAME TO BE OPERATED ANYWHERE IN THIS  STATE  OTHER
 THAN ON LANDS OF THE OWNER OF THE ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE MOTOR-
 CYCLE  WITHOUT  HAVING  IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT THE LIABILITY INSURANCE
 COVERAGE REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION, AND NO PERSON SHALL OPERATE AN  ELEC-
 TRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE ANYWHERE IN THIS STATE OTHER THAN
 ON  LANDS OF THE OWNER OF THE ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE
 WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH INSURANCE IS NOT IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
  § 4. Subsection (f) of section 5103 of the insurance law,  as  amended
 by chapter 402 of the laws of 1986, is amended to read as follows:
  (f)  Every  owner's  policy  of  liability  insurance  issued  on  a
 motorcycle, ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE or an all terrain
 vehicle in satisfaction of the requirements of article six or  eight  of
 the  vehicle  and traffic law, SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED NINETY-ONE OF SUCH
 LAW, or section twenty-four hundred seven of such law shall also provide
 for; every owner who maintains another form of financial security  on  a
 motorcycle, ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE or an all terrain
 vehicle  in  satisfaction  of  the  requirements  of  such  articles  or
 [section] SECTIONS shall be liable for; and every owner of a motorcycle,
 ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE or  an  all  terrain  vehicle
 required  to be subject to the provisions of this article by subdivision
 two of section three hundred twenty-one of such law shall be liable for;
 the payment of first party benefits to persons, other than the occupants
 of such motorcycle, ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE  MOTORCYCLE  or  all
 terrain  vehicle,  another  motorcycle,  ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR LIMITED USE
 MOTORCYCLE or all terrain vehicle, or any motor vehicle, for loss  aris-
 ing  out  of the use or operation of the motorcycle, ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR

 insurer  and self-insurer may exclude from the coverage required by this
 subsection a person who  intentionally  causes  his  own  injury  or  is
 injured while committing an act which would constitute a felony or while
 seeking  to  avoid  lawful  apprehension  or arrest by a law enforcement
 officer.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition,  amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation  of  this act on its effective date are authorized to be made and
 completed on or before such effective date.
