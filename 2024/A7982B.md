 IN  SUCH LANGUAGE AND FORM AS SHALL BE DETERMINED AND ESTABLISHED BY THE
 SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES, ISSUED  BY  AN  INSURANCE  CARRIER
 AUTHORIZED  TO  DO BUSINESS IN THIS STATE. SUCH POLICY SHALL PROVIDE FOR
 COVERAGES  REQUIRED OF AN "OWNER'S POLICY OF LIABILITY INSURANCE" AS SET
 FORTH IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION  FOUR  OF  SECTION  THREE  HUNDRED
 ELEVEN  OF  THIS CHAPTER. IN LIEU OF SUCH INSURANCE COVERAGE AS HEREINA-
 BOVE PROVIDED, THE COMMISSIONER, IN THEIR DISCRETION AND  UPON  APPLICA-
 TION  OF A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY HAVING REGISTERED IN ITS NAME ONE OR MORE
 CLASS C LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLES, MAY WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT OF  INSURANCE
 BY  A  PRIVATE  INSURANCE  CARRIER AND ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OF SELF-INSU-
 RANCE,  WHEN  THEY  ARE  SATISFIED  THAT  SUCH  GOVERNMENTAL  AGENCY  IS
 POSSESSED  OF FINANCIAL ABILITY TO RESPOND TO JUDGMENTS OBTAINED AGAINST
 IT, ARISING OUT OF THE OWNERSHIP, USE  OR  OPERATION  OF  SUCH  CLASS  C
 LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLES. THE COMMISSIONER MAY ALSO WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT
 OF  INSURANCE  BY A PRIVATE INSURANCE CARRIER AND ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OF
 SELF-INSURANCE UPON APPLICATION OF ANY PERSON OR ANY OTHER  CORPORATION,
 HAVING  REGISTERED IN ITS NAME, ONE OR MORE CLASS C LIMITED USE MOTORCY-
 CLES AND FURNISHING OF PROOF THAT A CERTIFICATE  OF  SELF-INSURANCE  HAS
 BEEN ISSUED AND IS IN EFFECT PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION THREE
 HUNDRED SIXTEEN OF THIS CHAPTER.

 AND DISPLAYED BY THE OWNER OR OPERATOR  OF  SUCH  CLASS  C  LIMITED  USE
 MOTORCYCLE  UPON  THE  REQUEST  OF  ANY  MAGISTRATE OR ANY PERSON HAVING
 AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF  THIS  CHAPTER.  THE  FAILURE  TO
 PRODUCE  SUCH  PROOF UPON THE REQUEST OF ANY SUCH PERSON SHALL NOT BE AN
 OFFENSE BUT SHALL BE PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH CLASS C LIMITED  USE
 MOTORCYCLE  IS BEING OPERATED WITHOUT HAVING SUCH INSURANCE IN FORCE AND
 EFFECT.
  3. PROOF OF INSURANCE AS REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION  SHALL  BE  PRODUCED
 AND  DISPLAYED  BY  THE  OWNER  OR  OPERATOR OF SUCH CLASS C LIMITED USE
 MOTORCYCLE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS SUFFERED OR  CLAIMS  TO  HAVE  SUFFERED
 EITHER  PERSONAL  INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF THE OPERATION
 OF SUCH CLASS C LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE BY THE OWNER OR OPERATOR, IF SUCH
 INSURANCE COVERAGE WAS REQUIRED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF  SUCH  OPERA-
 TION.  IT  SHALL  BE  AN  AFFIRMATIVE  DEFENSE  TO ANY PROSECUTION FOR A
 VIOLATION OF THIS  SUBDIVISION  THAT  SUCH  PROOF  WAS  SO  PRODUCED  OR
 DISPLAYED WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF RECEIVING NOTICE OF SUCH INJURY OR
 DAMAGE, OR THE CLAIM OF SUCH INJURY OR DAMAGE.
  4.  NO  OWNER  OF  A  CLASS  C LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE SHALL OPERATE OR
 PERMIT THE SAME TO BE OPERATED ANYWHERE IN  THIS  STATE  OTHER  THAN  ON
 LANDS  OF THE OWNER OF THE CLASS C LIMITED USE MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT HAVING
 IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT THE LIABILITY INSURANCE  COVERAGE  REQUIRED  BY
 THIS SECTION, AND NO PERSON SHALL OPERATE A CLASS C LIMITED USE MOTORCY-
 CLE ANYWHERE IN THIS STATE OTHER THAN ON LANDS OF THE OWNER OF THE CLASS
 C  LIMITED  USE MOTORCYCLE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH INSURANCE IS NOT
 IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.
  § 2. Subsection (f) of section 5103 of the insurance law,  as  amended
 by chapter 402 of the laws of 1986, is amended to read as follows:
