  COMMEMORATING  the  175th  Anniversary  of Trinity
  Church of Rome, New York
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social  and
educational  benefits  they confer, play a vital role in the development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to celebrate  the
milestones  of  those enduring places of worship within the State of New
York which serves the spiritual needs of our citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 175th Anniversary of Trinity Church of Rome,  New  York,
to be celebrated with a myriad of events on April 15-16, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The history of Trinity Church is rooted in Rome, New York,
where the earliest congregation was created in March of 1848; and
 
  WHEREAS, After the construction of a dam in 1804, the building of  a
grist mill, cotton mill, woolen mill and sawmill brought skilled workers
familiar  with  operating these businesses to Rome; in 1819, the Village
was incorporated as a major  transportation  route  for  trades  between
early  settlers  and  Native  Americans  and  was  influenced  by  the
development of the Erie Canal; and
 
  WHEREAS, The rapid growth of then Canal Village, populated by German
immigrants in the 1800s, led to a need for a holy institution  to  bring
people  together;  during  this  time,  22  men,  representing  some  20
families, first established the early congregation of Trinity Church  in
March of 1848, under the leadership of Reverend Alexander Wetzel; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The people of the newly formed church named themselves the
United German Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of Rome,  and  one  year
after  its  inception  the  forefathers of Trinity Church erected a wood
frame building on the northwest corner of South James and Ridge  streets
on  a  lot  donated by the trustees of the estate of Dominick Lynch, the
founder of Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The official dedication of the structure, known then as the
"Little German Church," took place on October 25, 1851; and
 
  WHEREAS, Between 1851 and 1867, the congregation was independent and
secured various pastors to keep worship in the  community  thriving;  by
1893,  there  were  about  85  voting members as the church continued to
grow, and in 1927, the congregation decided they needed  a  church  more
centrally  located  to  their parishioners and purchased the property at
215 West Court Street from the Welsh Congregational Society; and
 
  WHEREAS, The dedication of the new church was held on Sunday,  April
15,  1928,  and a morning farewell service for "The Little White Church"
was led by Pastor Paul Gabler; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1928, Trinity Church became a member of the  Evangelical
and  Reformed  Church body, then in 1959 Trinity joined United Church of
Christ and became Trinity United Church of Christ; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  addition  of  five Sunday School rooms, the Zingerline
Memorial Lounge, and a new pastor's office was added  in  1959,  and  in
1990,  a  council  room, nursery, music room, administrative office, and
another new pastor's office was added to the building to accommodate the
churches growing membership; and
 
  WHEREAS, After faithfully  serving  Trinity  Church  for  25  years,
Reverend Frank Graichen retired in 2019; just one year later, the church
endured the struggles brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Overcoming  much adversity, including declining attendance
and the closings of churches, Trinity Church installed a new  electronic
system  to  allow  people  to  see and hear a service from the safety of
their own home; and
 
  WHEREAS, In October of 2022, Trinity Church  welcomed  Pastor  Karen
Marshall  as  their new full-time pastor, and she continues to carry out
the mission of this vital institution; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 175th anniversary of Trinity Church is a  testament  to
those  who  have  attended and diligently worked for the church's growth
through the years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Trinity Church stands on the threshold of  tomorrow,
prepared  to  meet the challenges of the coming decades, while retaining
that spiritual resolve which has so characterized its glorious past; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to take  note  of
enduring  religious  institutions  and to bring such institutions to the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  175th Anniversary of Trinity Church of Rome, New York,
confident that this commemoration reflects the belief  in  those  values
which enhance the dignity and purpose of life; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Trinity Church of Rome, New York.
