BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  160th  Anniversary  of  The
  Sherburne News
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute  to
those  illustrious  journalistic  entities  which  have  diligently  and
consistently, year after year, recorded the history of their communities
and brought local news and news of the larger world  to  their  readers;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 160th Anniversary of The Sherburne News; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established in March of 1864, The Sherburne News publishes
a weekly newspaper for  readers  in  Central  New  York  and  the  local
community;  The  Sherburne News prioritizes customers, and also provides
other services such as business cards or inserts; and
 
  WHEREAS, With new issues every Thursday, The Sherburne News  can  be
purchased at the following retailers: The Big M, Sherburne Skips Market,
and at The Sherburne News; and
 
  WHEREAS, Starting from humble beginnings when the price of the paper
was  just  ten  cents per month, the first edition of The Sherburne News
was printed on March 2nd, 1864; the founder of the  publication,  Simeon
B. Marsh, printed his first paper on one side of a sheet and one column;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Becoming  a  great  success,  The Sherburne News grew to a
seven column, four-page paper; this enlargement  necessitated  a  larger
press  and  a  secondhand  Washington  hand  press  was installed with a
quantity of new types added to the office; and
 
  WHEREAS, In  1872,  The  Sherburne  News  was  purchased  by  Thomas
Randall, one of the first African-American editors of a newspaper in New
York  State; he improved The Sherburne News, expanding it and carrying a
subscription rate of nearly 1000; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  November  of  1881,  John  H.  O'Brian  purchased  The
Sherburne  News  and  expanded  it to eight columns and the subscription
list was still growing; he purchased sole  ownership  of  The  Sherburne
News,  until  his death in 1912, when his nephew, Harry J. McDaniel, who
had been employed at The Sherburne News, took over publication; and
 
  WHEREAS, Moving the paper to its  present  location,  The  Sherburne
News  prospered  under  the  leadership of Harry J. McDaniel and the new
space accommodated all types of printing for the  trade;  in  1954,  his
son,  John  M.  McDaniel,  took over publication, having worked with his
father since high school; following the family  tradition,  John's  son,
James, took over publication of The Sherburne News in the 1990s; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2001, The Sherburne News was transformed from a letter
press printed  newspaper  to  offset,  using  computer  technologies  to
 
continue  publishing;  at  its beginning, the publication was set by all
hand type for many years until the invention of  the  Linotype  machine,
which  is  hot  type  and  was  installed  in the 1920s; the old Babcock
printing press, which printed The Sherburne News each Wednesday for many
years, has been preserved at the Sherburne Historic Park building; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our  newspapers  provide  a tremendous service to citizens
across the State of New York by  keeping  them  informed  about  current
events;  the  democracy  of  our  State  and Nation is strengthened by a
responsible citizenry which is actively  engaged  in  reading  and  kept
abreast of news affecting their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  The  Sherburne  News moves into the future, it carries
with it the legacy  of  a  distinguished  journalistic  history  and  an
outstanding record of growth and achievement; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 160th Anniversary of  The  Sherburne  News;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Sherburne News.
