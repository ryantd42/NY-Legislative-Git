 DAYS  PRIOR TO DEATH, SUCH MEMBER'S DESIGNATED OPTION ELECTION BENEFICI-
 ARY OR BENEFICIARIES, IF AN OPTION ELECTION  HAS  BEEN  FILED  PRIOR  TO
 DEATH,  OR  THE  BENEFICIARY  OR  BENEFICIARIES DESIGNATED FOR THE DEATH
 BENEFIT,  IF NO OPTION ELECTION WAS FILED PRIOR TO DEATH, SHALL HAVE THE
 OPTION TO CHOOSE THE BENEFIT PROVIDED BY SERVICE RETIREMENT RATHER  THAN
 THE  DEATH BENEFIT, PROVIDED, HOWEVER THAT IF THE DESIGNATED BENEFICIARY
 ELECTS THE SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT SUCH PERSON SHALL BE  REQUIRED  TO
 CHOOSE  AN  OPTION  AS  PROVIDED  BY LAW. IF THE MEMBER'S BENEFICIARY OR
 BENEFICIARIES ELECT THE SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT, THE MEMBER SHALL  BE
 DEEMED  TO HAVE RETIRED ON THE DAY BEFORE THE MEMBER'S DATE OF DEATH. IF
 THERE ARE MULTIPLE OPTION BENEFICIARIES AND  SUCH  BENEFICIARIES  CANNOT
 AGREE  ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEATH BENEFIT OR THE SERVICE RETIREMENT
 UNDER AN AGREED UPON OPTION, THE SERVICE  RETIREMENT  BENEFIT  SHALL  BE
 PAYABLE UNDER THE OPTION ELECTION FORM FILED BY THE MEMBER PRIOR TO SUCH
 MEMBER'S DEATH. IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE DEATH BENEFICIARIES AND SUCH BENE-
 FICIARIES  CANNOT  AGREE  ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEATH BENEFIT OR THE
 SERVICE RETIREMENT UNDER AN AGREED UPON OPTION, THE DEATH BENEFIT  SHALL
 BE PAYABLE.
  § 2. Subdivision a of section 370 of the retirement and social securi-
 ty  law,  as  amended  by chapter 375 of the laws of 2011, is amended to
 read as follows:
  a. Any member may retire  if  [he  or  she]  SUCH  MEMBER  shall  have
 attained  at  least  the  minimum  retirement  age while in service as a
 member, or while in federal service, or in the  service  of  the  United
 Nations  or other international organizations of which the United States
 is a member, as a member continued pursuant to paragraph one of subdivi-
 sion f of section three hundred forty of this article or while  entitled
 to  make  application  for  a  vested  retirement  allowance pursuant to
 section three hundred seventy-six of this title. Any such member  desir-
 ing to retire shall execute and file with the comptroller an application
 for  retirement,  which shall specify the effective date of [his or her]
 SUCH MEMBER'S retirement, which shall be not less than fifteen nor  more
 than  ninety  days subsequent to such date of filing. An application for
 service retirement, filed hereunder in accordance with the provisions of
 subdivision c of section sixty-two or subdivision f  of  section  sixty-
 three  of  this  chapter,  shall  be  processed  in  the regular manner,
 provided that if the application filed  simultaneously  therewith  under
 either  of  such  subdivisions  is  granted,  then and in that event the
 retirement allowance granted in accordance with the provisions  of  this
 section  shall  be  appropriately  adjusted.  Notwithstanding  any other
 provision of law, FOR any member who is eligible to  retire  [and],  who
 has  died  while in active service, and who has filed an application for
 service retirement less than [thirty] NINETY days prior to death, [shall
 be deemed to have retired and] the member's designated  OPTION  ELECTION
 beneficiary OR BENEFICIARIES, IF AN OPTION ELECTION HAS BEEN FILED PRIOR
 TO  DEATH,  OR THE BENEFICIARY OR BENEFICIARIES DESIGNATED FOR THE DEATH
 BENEFIT, IF NO OPTION ELECTION WAS FILED PRIOR TO DEATH, shall have  the
 option  to choose the benefit provided by service retirement rather than
 the death benefit, provided, however that if the designated  beneficiary
 elects  the  service retirement benefit such person shall be required to
 choose an option [under section three hundred ninety of this article] AS
 PROVIDED BY LAW. IF THE MEMBER'S BENEFICIARY OR BENEFICIARIES ELECT  THE
 SERVICE  RETIREMENT  BENEFIT, THE MEMBER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE RETIRED
 ON THE DAY BEFORE THE MEMBER'S DATE OF  DEATH.  IF  THERE  ARE  MULTIPLE
 OPTION  BENEFICIARIES  AND SUCH BENEFICIARIES CANNOT AGREE ON THE CHOICE
 BETWEEN THE DEATH BENEFIT OR THE SERVICE RETIREMENT UNDER AN AGREED UPON
 S. 9812--A  3

 OPTION, THE SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT SHALL BE PAYABLE UNDER THE OPTION
 ELECTION FORM FILED BY THE MEMBER PRIOR TO SUCH MEMBER'S DEATH. IF THERE
 ARE MULTIPLE DEATH BENEFICIARIES AND SUCH BENEFICIARIES CANNOT AGREE  ON
 THE  CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEATH BENEFIT OR THE SERVICE RETIREMENT UNDER AN
 AGREED UPON OPTION, THE DEATH BENEFIT SHALL BE PAYABLE.
  § 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary,  the
 provisions of this act shall not be subject to section 25 of the retire-
 ment and social security law.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would allow a deceased member's beneficiary the ability to
 select between the active member death benefit or a  survivor's  benefit
 payable  under any optional form of payment elected by said beneficiary,
 provided that the member
  1) was eligible to retire as of the day  immediately  prior  to  their
 death,
  2) has died in active service, and
  3)  has  FILED  an application for service retirement less than ninety
 days prior to their death.
  If an option election form was filed by the member prior to death, the
 beneficiary listed on such option election form shall  be  permitted  to
 select  between  the active death benefit or a survivor's benefit. If no
 option election form was filed by the member prior to death, the  active
 death  beneficiary shall be permitted to select between the active death
 benefit or a survivor's benefit.
  When the survivor's benefit  is  selected,  the  beneficiary  will  be
 permitted  to file their own option election form determining the survi-
 vor's benefit payable and the member will be deemed to have retired  the
 day prior to their death.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), if this bill is  enacted  during  the  2024
 Legislative  Session,  the  cost  will depend upon the deceased member's
 age, service, salary, plan, and the optional form elected by the benefi-
 ciary. For standard options, there will be an estimated additional  cost
 of  five (5) times the salary of the deceased member, including the cost
 of the post-retirement death benefit. All costs arising would be  shared
 and  spread  by the State of New York and all participating employers in
 the NYSLERS.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System  (NYSLPFRS), if this bill is enacted during the
 2024 Legislative  Session,  the  cost  will  depend  upon  the  deceased
 member's  age,  service,  salary, plan, and the optional form elected by
 the beneficiary. For standard options, no additional cost is expected to
 arise in NYSLPFRS. Any costs arising would be shared and spread  by  the
 State of New York and all participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
  The  number of beneficiaries who could be affected by this legislation
 cannot be readily determined. However, it is estimated  that  more  than
 600 beneficiaries could benefit from this provision each year.
