  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

 continued pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision f of section forty of
 this article, or while entitled to make application for a vested retire-

 his or her retirement, which shall be not less  than  fifteen  nor  more

 service retirement, filed hereunder in accordance with the provisions of

 section  shall  be  appropriately  adjusted.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER

 ARIES DESIGNATED FOR THE DEATH BENEFIT, IF NO OPTION ELECTION WAS  FILED
 PRIOR  TO DEATH, SHALL HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE THE BENEFIT PROVIDED BY
 SERVICE RETIREMENT RATHER THAN THE DEATH BENEFIT, PROVIDED, HOWEVER THAT
 IF THE DESIGNATED BENEFICIARY ELECTS THE SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT SUCH
 PERSON  SHALL BE REQUIRED TO CHOOSE AN OPTION AS PROVIDED BY LAW. IF THE
 MEMBER'S BENEFICIARY OR BENEFICIARIES ELECT THE SERVICE RETIREMENT BENE-
 FIT, THE MEMBER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE RETIRED ON THE  DAY  BEFORE  THE
 MEMBER'S  DATE  OF DEATH. IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE OPTION BENEFICIARIES AND
 SUCH BENEFICIARIES CANNOT AGREE ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEATH  BENEFIT
 OR  THE  SERVICE  RETIREMENT  UNDER  AN  AGREED UPON OPTION, THE SERVICE
 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SHALL BE PAYABLE UNDER THE OPTION ELECTION FORM FILED
 BY THE MEMBER PRIOR TO SUCH MEMBER'S DEATH. IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE  DEATH
 BENEFICIARIES  AND SUCH BENEFICIARIES CANNOT AGREE ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN
 THE DEATH BENEFIT OR THE SERVICE RETIREMENT UNDER AN AGREED UPON OPTION,
 THE DEATH BENEFIT SHALL BE PAYABLE.
  § 2. Subdivision a of section 370 of the retirement and social securi-
 ty law, as amended by chapter 375 of the laws of  2011,  is  amended  to

 continued  pursuant  to  paragraph one of subdivision f of section three
 hundred forty of this article or while entitled to make application  for
 a  vested  retirement allowance pursuant to section three hundred seven-
 ty-six of this title. Any such member desiring to retire  shall  execute
 and file with the comptroller an application for retirement, which shall
 specify  the effective date of his or her retirement, which shall be not
 less than fifteen nor more than ninety days subsequent to such  date  of
 filing.  An  application  for  service  retirement,  filed  hereunder in
 accordance with the provisions of subdivision c of section sixty-two  or
 subdivision f of section sixty-three of this chapter, shall be processed
 in the regular manner, provided that if the application filed simultane-
 ously  therewith  under either of such subdivisions is granted, then and
 in that event the retirement allowance granted in  accordance  with  the
 provisions  of  this  section  shall be appropriately adjusted. Notwith-
 standing any other provision of law, FOR any member who is  eligible  to
 retire [and], who has died while in active service, and who has filed an
 application  for service retirement less than [thirty] NINETY days prior
 to death, [shall be deemed to have retired and] the member's  designated
 OPTION  ELECTION beneficiary OR BENEFICIARIES, IF AN OPTION ELECTION HAS
 BEEN FILED PRIOR TO DEATH, OR THE BENEFICIARY  OR  BENEFICIARIES  DESIG-
 NATED  FOR  THE  DEATH BENEFIT, IF NO OPTION ELECTION WAS FILED PRIOR TO
 DEATH, shall have the option to choose the benefit provided  by  service
 retirement  rather than the death benefit, provided, however that if the
 designated beneficiary elects the service retirement benefit such person
 shall be required to choose an option [under section three hundred nine-
 ty of this article] AS PROVIDED BY LAW. IF THE MEMBER'S  BENEFICIARY  OR
 BENEFICIARIES  ELECT THE SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT, THE MEMBER SHALL BE
 DEEMED TO HAVE RETIRED ON THE DAY BEFORE THE MEMBER'S DATE OF DEATH.  IF
 THERE  ARE  MULTIPLE  OPTION BENEFICIARIES AND SUCH BENEFICIARIES CANNOT

 PAYABLE UNDER THE OPTION ELECTION FORM FILED BY THE MEMBER PRIOR TO SUCH
 MEMBER'S DEATH. IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE DEATH BENEFICIARIES AND SUCH BENE-
 FICIARIES CANNOT AGREE ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEATH  BENEFIT  OR  THE
