 AN ACT authorizing Innovative  Resources  for  Independence,  Inc.  to
  receive retroactive real property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Innovative  Resources  for  Independence,  Inc.  an  application  for
 exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real
 property  tax law with respect to the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 assessment
 rolls for all of the 2022-2023 school taxes, a portion of the  2023-2024
 school  taxes,  all  of the 2023 general taxes and a portion of the 2024
 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such  organization  located  at
 2016  Linden  Boulevard,  hamlet of Elmont, town of Hempstead, county of
 Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county parcel ID section 37 block  Q07
 lot 15. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it had been
 received on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  rolls,  the applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
