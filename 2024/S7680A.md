 AN ACT in relation to authorizing  the  county  of  Nassau  assessor  to
  accept  an  application for a real property tax exemption from Innova-

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Innovative  Resources for Independence an application for exemption from
 real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real  property  tax
 law  with  respect  to  the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 assessment rolls for
 part of the 2021 school taxes, all of the 2022-2023 school taxes and all
 of the 2022 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to  such  organization
 located  at  16  Willow Lane, hamlet of Carle Place, town of North Hemp-
 stead, county of Nassau, otherwise known  as  Nassau  county  parcel  ID
 section  10  block  279  lot  2.  If  accepted, the application shall be
 reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxable status date
 established for such rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
