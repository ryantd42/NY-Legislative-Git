 AN  ACT  in  relation  to  authorizing  the county of Nassau assessor to
  accept an application for a real property tax exemption  from  Innova-
  tive Resources for Independence
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Innovative Resources for Independence an application for exemption  from
 real  property  taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax
 law with respect to the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 assessment rolls  for  a
 portion  of the 2021 school taxes, all of the 2022-2023 school taxes and
 all of the 2022 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such  organiza-
 tion  located  at  16  Willow Lane, hamlet of Carle Place, town of North
 Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county parcel  ID
 section  10  block  279  lot  2.  If  accepted, the application shall be
 reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxable status date
 established for such rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
