 S. 4908  4

 juror  by  law  in  the  determination of a sentence pursuant to section
 400.27].
  § 19. Subdivision 2 of section 270.30 of the criminal procedure law is
 REPEALED.
  § 20. Section 270.55 of the criminal procedure law is REPEALED.
  §  21.  Section  310.80  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by

 § 310.80 Recording and checking of verdict and polling of jury.
  After a verdict has been rendered, it must be recorded on the  minutes
 and  read to the jury, and the jurors must be collectively asked whether
 such is their verdict. Even though no juror makes any declaration in the
 negative, the jury must, if either party makes such an  application,  be
 polled  and each juror separately asked whether the verdict announced by
 the foreman is in all respects his verdict. If upon either  the  collec-
 tive  or  the  separate  inquiry  any juror answers in the negative, the
 court must refuse to accept the verdict and  must  direct  the  jury  to
 resume  its deliberation. If no disagreement is expressed, the jury must
 be discharged from the case[, except as otherwise  provided  in  section

  §  22.  Section  380.60  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by

 § 380.60 Authority for the execution of sentence.
  [Except where a sentence of death is pronounced,  a]  A  sentence  and
 commitment  or certificate of conviction showing the sentence pronounced
 by the court, or a certified copy thereof, constitutes the authority for
 execution of the sentence and serves as the order of commitment, and  no
 other  warrant, order of commitment or authority is necessary to justify
 or to require execution of the sentence.
  § 23. Section 400.27 of the criminal procedure law is REPEALED.
  § 24. Subdivision 1 of section 440.20 of the criminal  procedure  law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  1  of  the laws of 1995, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. At any time after the entry of a judgment, the court in  which  the
 judgment  was  entered  may, upon motion of the defendant, set aside the
 sentence upon the ground that it was unauthorized, illegally imposed  or
 otherwise  invalid  as  a  matter of law. [Where the judgment includes a
 sentence of death, the court may also set aside the sentence upon any of
 the grounds set forth in paragraph (b), (c), (f), (g) or (h) of subdivi-
 sion one of section 440.10 as applied to a separate sentencing  proceed-
 ing  under  section  400.27,  provided,  however, that to the extent the
 ground or grounds asserted include one or more of  the  aforesaid  para-
 graphs  of  subdivision one of section 440.10, the court must also apply
 subdivisions two and three of section 440.10, other than  paragraph  (d)
 of  subdivision  two  of such section, in determining the motion. In the
 event the court enters an  order  granting  a  motion  to  set  aside  a
 sentence of death under this section, the court must either direct a new
 sentencing  proceeding  in  accordance  with  section  400.27 or, to the
 extent that the defendant cannot be resentenced to death consistent with
 the laws of this state or the constitution  of  this  state  or  of  the
 United  States,  resentence  the  defendant to life imprisonment without
 parole or to a sentence of imprisonment for  the  class  A-I  felony  of
 murder  in  the  first degree other than a sentence of life imprisonment
 without parole.  Upon granting the motion upon any of  the  grounds  set
 forth  in  the aforesaid paragraphs of subdivision one of section 440.10
 and setting aside the sentence, the  court  must  afford  the  people  a
 reasonable  period  of  time,  which shall not be less than ten days, to
 S. 4908  5

 determine whether to take an appeal from the  order  setting  aside  the
 sentence  of  death.  The  taking  of  an appeal by the people stays the
 effectiveness of that portion of the court's order that  directs  a  new
 sentencing proceeding.]
  §  25.  Section  450.10  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 chapter 671 of the laws of 1971, subdivisions 1  and  2  as  amended  by
 chapter  671 of the laws of 1984, subdivision 3 as added and subdivision
 4 as renumbered by chapter 516 of the laws of 1986 and subdivision 5  as
 added by chapter 560 of the laws of 1999, is amended to read as follows:

 by  the  defendant  from the following judgment, sentence and order of a
 criminal court:
  1. A judgment [other than one including a sentence of  death],  unless
 the  appeal is based solely upon the ground that a sentence was harsh or
 excessive when such sentence was predicated upon  entry  of  a  plea  of
 guilty  and the sentence imposed did not exceed that which was agreed to
 by the defendant as a condition of the plea and set forth on the  record
 or  filed  with  the  court  as  required by subdivision five of section
 220.50 or subdivision four of section 340.20;
  2. A sentence [other than one of death], as prescribed in  subdivision
 one of section 450.30, unless the appeal is based solely upon the ground
 that a sentence was harsh or excessive when such sentence was predicated
 upon  entry  of a plea of guilty and the sentence imposed did not exceed
 that which was agreed to by the defendant as a condition of the plea and
 set forth in the record or filed with the court as required by  subdivi-
 sion five of section 220.50 or subdivision four of section 340.20;
  3. A sentence including an order of criminal forfeiture entered pursu-
 ant  to  section 460.30 of the penal law with respect to such forfeiture
 order.
  4. An order, entered pursuant  to  section  440.40,  setting  aside  a
 sentence [other than one of death], upon motion of the People.
  5.  An  order  denying a motion, made pursuant to subdivision one-a of
 section 440.30, for forensic DNA testing of evidence.
  § 26. Section 450.15 of the criminal  procedure  law,  as  amended  by
 chapter 671 of the laws of 1984, is amended to read as follows:
 § 450.15 Appeal  by  defendant  to intermediate appellate court; in what
  cases authorized by permission.
  If an appeal by defendant is not authorized as of  right  pursuant  to
 section  450.10, the defendant may appeal from the following orders of a
 criminal court, provided that a certificate granting leave to appeal  is
 issued pursuant to section 460.15:
  1.  An  order  denying  a  motion, made pursuant to section 440.10, to
 vacate a judgment [other than one including a sentence of death];
  2. An order denying a motion by the defendant made pursuant to section
 440.20, to set aside a sentence [other than one of death];
  3. A sentence which is not otherwise appealable as of  right  pursuant
 to subdivision one or two of section 450.10.
  §  27.  Subdivisions  4,  5, 6 and 7 of section 450.20 of the criminal
 procedure law are amended to read as follows:
  4. A sentence [other than one of death,] as prescribed in subdivisions
 two and three of section 450.30;

  § 30. Section 450.80 of the criminal procedure law is REPEALED.

 sion 3 as added by chapter 1 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read  as
 follows:
 §  460.40  Effect  of  taking of appeal upon judgment or order of courts
  below; when stayed.
  [1. The taking of an appeal by the defendant directly to the court  of
 appeals,  pursuant to subdivision one of section 450.70, from a superior
 court judgment including a sentence of death stays the execution of such
 sentence.  Except as provided in subdivision two of this section, in  no
 other  case  does  the  taking  of an appeal, by either party, in and of
 itself stay the execution of any judgment, sentence or order of either a
 criminal court or an intermediate appellate court.
  2.] The taking of an appeal by the people to an intermediate appellate
 court pursuant to subdivision one-a of section  450.20,  from  an  order
 reducing  a count or counts of an indictment or dismissing an indictment
 and directing the filing of a prosecutor's information, stays the effect
 of such order.  In addition, the taking of an appeal by the people to an
 intermediate appellate court pursuant  to  subdivision  one  of  section
 450.20,  from  an  order  dismissing  a count or counts of an indictment
 charging murder in the first degree, stays the effect of such order.
  [3. Within six months of the effective date of this  subdivision,  the
 court of appeals shall adopt rules to ensure that a defendant is granted
 a  stay of the execution of any death warrant issued pursuant to article
 twenty-two-B of the correction law to allow the defendant an opportunity
 to prepare and timely file an initial motion pursuant to section  440.10
 or  440.20 seeking to set aside a sentence of death or vacate a judgment
 including a sentence of death and to allow the  motion  and  any  appeal
 from the denial thereof to be timely determined. The rules shall provide
 that  in  the event a defendant seeks to file any subsequent motion with
 respect to the judgment or sentence following a final  determination  of
 the  defendant's  initial motion pursuant to section 440.10 or 440.20, a
 motion for a stay of the execution of the  death  warrant  may  only  be
 granted  for good cause shown. The people and the defendant shall have a
 right to appeal to the court of appeals from orders granting or  denying
 such  stay  motions  and  any rules adopted pursuant to this subdivision
 shall provide that the court of appeals may affirm such orders,  reverse
 them  or  modify them upon such terms as the court deems appropriate and
 shall provide for the expeditious perfection and determination  of  such
 appeals.  Prior  to  adoption  of  the rules, the court of appeals shall
 issue proposed rules and receive written comments  thereon  from  inter-
 ested parties.]
  §  32.  Section  470.30  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 chapter 1 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:
 § 470.30 Determination by court of appeals  of  appeals  taken  directly
  thereto from judgments and orders of criminal courts.
 S. 4908  7
 
  1.  Wherever  appropriate,  the rules set forth in sections 470.15 and
 470.20, governing the consideration and  determination  by  intermediate
 appellate  courts of appeals thereto from judgments and orders of crimi-
 nal courts, and prescribing their scope of  review  and  the  corrective
 action  to be taken by them upon reversal or modification, apply equally
 to the consideration and  determination  by  the  court  of  appeals  of
 appeals  taken  directly  thereto[,  pursuant  to  sections  450.70  and
 450.80,] from judgments and orders of superior criminal courts.
  [2. Whenever a sentence of death is imposed, the judgment and sentence
 shall be reviewed on the record by the court of appeals.  Review by  the
 court  of  appeals pursuant to subdivision one of section 450.70 may not
 be waived.
  3. With regard to the sentence, the court shall, in addition to  exer-
 cising  the  powers and scope of review granted under subdivision one of
 this section, determine:
  (a) whether the sentence of death was imposed under the  influence  of
 passion,  prejudice,  or  any  other  arbitrary or legally impermissible
 factor including whether the imposition of the verdict or  sentence  was
 based  upon the race of the defendant or a victim of the crime for which
 the defendant was convicted;
  (b) whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate  to
 the  penalty imposed in similar cases considering both the crime and the
 defendant. In conducting such review the  court,  upon  request  of  the
 defendant,  in addition to any other determination, shall review whether
 the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate  to  the  penalty
 imposed  in  similar  cases  by virtue of the race of the defendant or a
 victim of the crime for which the defendant was convicted; and
  (c) whether the decision to impose the sentence of death  was  against
 the weight of the evidence.
  4. The court shall include in its decision:
  (a)  the  aggravating and mitigating factors established in the record
 on appeal; and
  (b) those similar cases it took into consideration.
  5. In addition to exercising any other corrective action  pursuant  to
 subdivision  one  of this section, the court, with regard to review of a
 sentence of death, shall be authorized to:
  (a) affirm the sentence of death; or
  (b) set the sentence aside and remand the case for resentencing pursu-
 ant to the procedures set forth in section 400.27 for a determination as
 to whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death, life  imprisonment
 without  parole or to a term of imprisonment for the class A-I felony of
 murder in the first degree other than a sentence  of  life  imprisonment
 without parole; or
  (c) set the sentence aside and remand the case for resentencing by the
 court for a determination as to whether the defendant shall be sentenced
 to life imprisonment without parole or to a term of imprisonment for the
 class  A-I felony of murder in the first degree other than a sentence of
 life imprisonment without parole.]
