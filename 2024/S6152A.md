 S. 6152--A  3
 
  § 6.  This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.-- Pursuant to  Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  provide an increase in the defined benefit cost-of-
 living adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems.  Start-
 ing with the payment in September 2024, the base benefit for computation
 of the annual COLA, currently $18,000, will be increased annually by 50%
 of the annual inflation rate not to exceed 3% or be less than 1%.
  The provisions of Section 25 of the Retirement and Social Security Law
 shall not apply.
  This proposal primarily benefits current and former members of Tiers 1
 -  5.  The  cost  of this benefit improvement will disproportionately be
 borne by current and future members of Tier 6.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be shared by the
 State of New York and the local participating employers in the  NYSLERS.
 If  this  bill  were  enacted  during  the 2024 Legislative Session, the
 increase in the present value of benefits would be  approximately  $1.30
 billion.
 
  NYSLERS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $1.03 billion  $634 million
  Tier 6  $0.27 billion  $663 million
  Total  $1.30 billion  $1.30 billion
 
  In  the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in  NYSLERS  is  0.4%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately $51 million to the State of New York and approximately $76
 million to the local participating employers. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST
 will  vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate
 and salary of the affected members.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $189 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $150 million  $80 million
  Tier 6  $39 million  $109 million
  Total  $189 million  $189 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in NYSLPFRS  is  0.4%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $3.4  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $14 million to the local participating employers. This PERMANENT  ANNUAL
 COST  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate and salary of the affected members.
  We anticipate some administrative costs to implement the provisions of
 this legislation.

  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS:  Currently  the  COLA  provides  an  annual
 increase  equal  to a percentage of the maximum annual retirement allow-
 ance, but limited to the first $18,000 of retirement allowance.
  The costs in the tables above are based on providing for  an  increase
 in  the $18,000 limit starting on September 1, 2024 and each year there-
 S. 6152--A  6

 after.  This increase would be equal to the  increase  in  the  consumer
 price  index  (CPI) in the one-year period ending on the prior March 31,
 rounded to the next higher one-tenth of one percent, but not  more  than
 3% nor less than 1%.
  IMPORTANT  NOTE:  An  alternate  interpretation of the proposed legis-
 lation could use the increasing $18,000 as the base for all retirees for
 calculating COLA rather than as the limit of  the  retirement  allowance
 subject  to  the COLA increase. To the extent that implementation of the
 proposed legislation follows this alternate  interpretation,  the  costs
 for  this  proposed  legislation  may  be as much as 75% higher than the
 costs disclosed above (i.e., a $2.7 billion total initial increase in PV
 of Benefits).
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 sky  are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of
 Actuaries. We are members of NYCERS but do not believe  it  impairs  our

 To  the  best  of  our knowledge, the results contained herein have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and
