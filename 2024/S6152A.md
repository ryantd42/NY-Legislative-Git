  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide an increase in the  defined  benefit  cost-of-
 living  adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems. Start-
 ing with the payment in September 2024, the base benefit for computation
 S. 6152  3
 
 of the annual COLA will be increased  annually  by  50%  of  the  annual
 inflation rate not to exceed 3% or be less than 1%.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), increased costs  would  be  shared  by  the
 State  of  New  York  and all participating employers in the NYSLERS. If
 this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there will  be
 an  increase in the present value of future costs of approximately $1.19
 billion.
 
  Increase in present  Increase in future

  Tiers 1 - 5  $976 million  $643 million
  Tier 6  $215 million  $549 million
  Total  $1.19 billion  $1.19 billion
 
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by  increasing
 the  billing rates charged annually. The annual contribution required of
 all participating employers in the  NYSLERS  is  approximately  0.4%  of
 billable  salary,  or approximately $49 million to the State of New York
 and $71 million to the local participating employers in the fiscal  year
 ending  March  31,  2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subse-
 quent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of  the
 affected members.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), increased costs would  be  shared  by
 the  State  of New York and all participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
 If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there  will
 be  an  increase  in  the present value of future costs of approximately
 $173 million.

  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged annually. The annual contribution required  of
 all  participating  employers  in  the NYSLPFRS is approximately 0.4% of
 billable salary, or approximately $3.4 million to the State of New  York
 and  $14 million to the local participating employers in the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will  vary  in  subse-
 quent  billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of the
 affected members.

  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate, dated March 30, 2023, and intended for use only during
 the 2023 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No.  2023-28,  prepared  by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would amend subdivision c of Section 532-a of the Education
 Law to annually increase the current  cost-of-living  adjustment  (COLA)
 base  benefit amount by fifty percent of annual inflation. Currently the
 base benefit amount to which the COLA percentage is applied is fixed  at
 $18,000  annually. The annual percentage increase shall be determined as
 fifty percent of the increase in the Consumer Price Index, published  by
 the  United  States  Bureau  of Labor Statistics, in the one-year period
 ending on the March thirty-first prior to  the  COLA  effective  on  the
 ensuing September first. The annual percentage increase shall not exceed
 three  percent nor be less than one percent. This annual COLA base bene-
 fit adjustment would be effective beginning in September 2024.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System  for this benefit is estimated to be $88.8
 million or 0.48% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System. Data distributions and statistics can be found in  the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.
  The  source  of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2023-11 dated February 7,
 2023 prepared by the Office  of  the  Actuary  of  the  New  York  State
 TeachersÆ Retirement System and is intended for use only during the 2023
 Legislative  Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the  Ameri-
 can  Academy  of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards of the
 American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation, as it relates to the New
 York City Retirement Systems and  Pension  Funds  (NYCRS),  would  amend
 Section  13-696  of  the  Administrative  Code  of  the City of New York
 (ACCNY) to increase the Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) base  limit  of
 $18,000 by 50% of CPI each year (limited to between 1% and 3%), starting
 on September 1, 2024, for the New York City Employees' Retirement System
 (NYCERS),  the  New  York City Teachers' Retirement System (NYCTRS), the
 New York City Board of Education Retirement System (BERS), the New  York
 City  Police  Pension  Fund (POLICE), and the New York City Fire Pension
 Fund (FIRE).
  Note: To the extent that the implementation  of  the  proposed  legis-
 lation  deviates from the calculation method discussed herein, the costs
 for the proposed legislation may be as much as 80% higher than the costs
 disclosed in the table below.
 S. 6152  5
 
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT  ON  BENEFITS:  Currently  the COLA provides an annual increase
 equal to a percentage of the maximum annual  retirement  allowance,  but
 limited to the first $18,000 of retirement allowance.
  The costs in the table below are based on providing for an increase in
 the  $18,000 limit starting on September 1, 2024 and each year thereaft-
 er.  This increase would be equal to the increase in the consumer  price
 index (CPI) in the one-year period ending on the prior March 31, rounded
 to  the  next  higher one-tenth of one percent, but not more than 3% nor
 less than 1%.
  The alternate cost disclosed below uses the increasing $18,000 as  the
 base  for  calculating  COLA  rather than as the limit of the retirement
 allowance subject to the COLA increase.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT: The  estimated  financial  impact  to  NYCRS  is  an
 increase  in  Present  Value  of  Future  Benefits of approximately $1.4
 billion and an increase in Fiscal Year  2024  annual  employer  contrib-
 utions of approximately $734.1 million. The increase in Fiscal Year 2024
 annual  employer  contributions  of  $734.1  million  is estimated to be
 $605.7 million for New York City and $128.4 million for the other  obli-
 gors of NYCRS. A breakdown of the financial impact by System is shown in
 the table below.
  Additional  Estimated First Year
  NYCRS  Present Value of Future Benefits  Annual Employer
  ($ Millions)  Contributions*
  ($ Millions)
 
  NYCERS  $ 576.2  $ 298.5
  NYCTRS  446.0  187.6
  BERS  40.9  14.9
  POLICE  251.8  184.2
  FIRE  79.2  48.9
  Total  $ 1,394.1  $ 734.1
  * Total employer contributions after the first year are estimated
  to be approximately $90 million per year.
 
  As noted above, to the extent that the implementation of this proposed
 legislation,  for  purposes of calculating individual COLA amounts, uses
 the increasing $18,000 base for all retirees, the increase  in  PVFB  is
 estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion.
  New  Unfunded  Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to benefit changes
 are generally amortized over the remaining  working  lifetime  of  those
 impacted  by  the  benefit changes. For purposes of this Fiscal Note, it
 has been assumed that increases in UAL attributable to current  retirees
 would  be  recognized immediately and that increases in UAL attributable
 to active members would be amortized over periods ranging from 12 to  15
 years  depending  on  the  System  (11 to 14 payments under One-Year Lag
 Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCRS to determine
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCRS.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 S. 6152  6
 
 valuations of NYCRS used to determine employer contributions for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial,  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement the
 proposed legislation.
