outstanding  professionals  in  the  boxing  industry  who distinguished
themselves  through  their  exceptional  performance,  attaining
unprecedented  success  and  the  highest level of personal achievement;
Theresa Kibby is one  such  individual  and  her  life  of  achievements

sport of boxing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor

over  Sue  Fox;  in  her  third bout, the welterweight won a hard-fought
battle with Pat Pineda in front of 1200 fans; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1976, the California  State  Athletic  Commission  began
granting  licenses  to  women and Theresa Kibby engaged in a three-fight

Michael Spinks; "Princess Red Star" compiled a  professional  record  of
10-3-4 (3 KOs); and
 
  WHEREAS,  Theresa Kibby, who along with her sister Darlene Buckskin,
were the first two Native American women to receive professional  boxing

of 68; and
 
  WHEREAS,  "Princess  Red  Star" Theresa Kibby clearly contributed to
the spirit of excellence which  is  a  tradition  of  the  International
Boxing Hall of Fame; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals of such  outstanding  accomplishments  are  brought  to  our
attention,  they  should be recognized by all the citizens of this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
