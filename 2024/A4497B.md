  Section  1.  The public service law is amended by adding a new section
 37-a to read as follows:
  § 37-A. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR PAYMENT  PLANS.  1.  THE  COMMISSION  IS
 AUTHORIZED  AND DIRECTED TO SET STANDARDS FOR PAYMENT PLANS FOR ELIGIBLE
 CUSTOMERS SET UP BY UTILITY COMPANIES. SUCH STANDARDS SHALL INCLUDE:
  (A) WHETHER A PAYMENT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY DOWN  PAYMENT  REQUIRE-
 MENTS,  IS REASONABLE. REASONABLENESS SHALL BE DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING
 THE CURRENT HOUSEHOLD INCOME, ABILITY TO PAY, PAYMENT HISTORY  INCLUDING
 PRIOR  DEFAULTS  ON SIMILAR AGREEMENTS, THE SIZE OF THE BILL, THE AMOUNT
 OF TIME AND THE REASONS WHY THE  BILL  HAS  BEEN  OUTSTANDING,  AND  ANY
 SPECIAL  CIRCUMSTANCES  CREATING EXTREME HARDSHIPS WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD.
 THE UTILITY COMPANY MAY REQUIRE THE PERSON TO CONFIRM  FINANCIAL  DIFFI-
 CULTY WITH AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM ANOTHER STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY;
  (B) REQUIRING EACH UTILITY COMPANY TO PERMIT EACH CUSTOMER A PERIOD OF
 NOT  LESS THAN TWENTY-ONE DAYS FROM THE DATE THE BILL WAS SENT TO PAY IN
 FULL, UNLESS THE CUSTOMER AND THE UTILITY AGREE ON A DIFFERENT DUE DATE.
 A UTILITY COMPANY SHALL NOT WITHDRAW FUNDS  FROM  A  CUSTOMER'S  ACCOUNT
 BEFORE  THE  DUE  DATE  IN CASES WHERE A CUSTOMER USES AN AUTOMATIC BILL
 PAYMENT PLAN UNLESS THE CUSTOMER AGREES TO A DIFFERENT PERIOD;
  (C) IN THE EVENT A RATE CHANGE  APPROVED  BY  THE  COMMISSION  BECOMES
 EFFECTIVE  OR  IN THE EVENT THE SUPPLY PORTION OF A CUSTOMER'S BILL WILL
 BE TEN PERCENT OR HIGHER THAN THE SUPPLY COST  FROM  THE  PRIOR  BILLING

 CYCLE,  WHILE  A  RESIDENTIAL  CUSTOMER IS ENROLLED IN AND IN COMPLIANCE
 WITH A PAYMENT PLAN, THE EFFECT OF THE RATE  CHANGE  SHALL  BE  INCLUDED
 RATABLY OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE PAYMENT PLAN PERIOD. INCLUDED WITH THE
 FIRST  ADJUSTED  BILL,  THE  UTILITY COMPANY SHALL PROVIDE NOTICE TO THE
 CUSTOMER EXPLAINING THE REASON FOR THE CHANGE AND SHOWING A  CALCULATION
 OF HOW THE UTILITY COMPANY ARRIVED AT THE NEW MONTHLY PAYMENT; AND
  (D) WHILE ENROLLED IN A RESIDENTIAL PAYMENT PLAN A RESIDENTIAL CUSTOM-
 ER'S  UTILITY  SERVICE  MAY  NOT  BE  TERMINATED  UNLESS THE RESIDENTIAL

 SION, DISCONNECTION IS NECESSARY FOR REASONS OF HEALTH, SAFETY, OR STATE
 OR NATIONAL EMERGENCIES, OR TERMINATION IS ORDERED  BY  THE  COMMISSION.
 PAYMENT  PLANS  SHALL  BE  OFFERED  TO  ALLOW A CUSTOMER TO PAY PAST-DUE
 AMOUNTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, UNLESS THE AMOUNTS OWING RELATE TO  THEFT
 OF  SERVICE,  TAMPERING,  AN  UNAUTHORIZED USE OF SERVICE, OR FAILURE TO
 ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF A TIME-PAYMENT PLAN. THE CUSTOMER SHALL  MAKE  THE
 INITIAL  PAYMENT WITHIN ONE BUSINESS DAY OF AGREEING TO THE TIME-PAYMENT
 PLAN.
  2. AN INDIVIDUAL OR HOUSEHOLD SHALL BE DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A
 PAYMENT PLAN UNDER THIS SECTION IF SUCH INDIVIDUAL OR HOUSEHOLD PROVIDES
