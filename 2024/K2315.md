commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in  all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the organization and the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be recognized and applauded by all  the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Finger Lakes  SPCA;  and  be  it
further
