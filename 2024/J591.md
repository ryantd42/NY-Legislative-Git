  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2, 2023, as Wrongful Conviction Day  in  the
  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
  observance of International Wrongful Conviction Day
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official days that are set aside to acknowledge vital issues that affect
the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is rightfully  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2, 2023, as
Wrongful Conviction Day in the State of New York,  in  conjunction  with
the observance of International Wrongful Conviction Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  person is endowed with human dignity and value, and
this  day  raises  awareness  for  the  innocent  who  were  unjustly
incarcerated for a crime they did not commit; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Wrongful  Conviction Day, commemorated on October 2, 2023,
is 24 hours dedicated to honor those with a life stolen; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Innocence Project, an organization  with  the  goal  of
exonerating  those serving sentences for crimes they did not commit, set
this day aside in 2013 as they recognized the necessity of taking a  day
in the calendar year to hold space for this unjust issue; and
 
  WHEREAS,  October  2nd  is  a  day  where  communities can focus on,
discuss, and hopefully find remedies for this issue that has  harmed  so
many lives, individually and collectively, around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Wrongful  convictions  have  been a shameful and pervasive
issue in the history of New  York  State's  justice  system,  especially
before the advent of DNA testing; and
 
  WHEREAS, This category of injustice not only robs an innocent person
of  their  life,  reputation,  and  dignity  while  the perpetrator of a
heinous crime walks free, it  exaggerates  existing  prejudices  against
Black and Brown communities as well as the intellectually disabled; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today  we not only honor those wrongfully convicted in New
York, but also the organizations including The Innocence Project, Policy
Research Inc., Family and Friends of the Wrongfully Convicted, LIFE Camp
Inc., King of Kings Foundation, and Man Up! U.S.A. Inc. that have fought
on behalf of these victims in our state; every day their  work  inspires
us  to  continue  to  commit our sincerest efforts to the eradication of
such occurrences; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  beneficial  that  there  be  greater  awareness  of
Wrongful Conviction Day and more should be done to increase awareness at
the  local,  State, and National levels to promote efforts and continued
commitment to the eradication of wrongful convictions;  now,  therefore,
be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2,  2023,  as
Wrongful  Conviction  Day  in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of International  Wrongful  Conviction  Day;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED  That  a  copy  of  this  Resolution,  suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
