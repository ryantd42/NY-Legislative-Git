  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Native Plant Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to set aside
official months to recognize and  pay  tribute  to  those  who  seek  to
preserve  and  celebrate native plants in the State of New York, as well
as their importance to the  environment  and  for  building  sustainable
ecosystems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 2023, as Native
Plant Month in the State of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  National
Native Plant Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Native  plants  are  indigenous  species that have evolved
alongside native wildlife and occur naturally in a particular geographic
region, ecosystem, and habitat; and
 
  WHEREAS, Essential for healthy, diverse, and sustainable ecosystems,
native plants are  critical  for  cleaning  air,  filtering  water,  and
stabilizing soils for the betterment of our environment; and
 
  WHEREAS, Plants that are native to our State are well-adapted to New
York's soils, temperatures, precipitation, and environmental conditions,
making  them  the  best  option  for  conserving  and  protecting  our
environment, and adapting to its changes; and
 
  WHEREAS, Native plants provide food including nectar, pollen, seeds,
and foliage for native birds, caterpillars, butterflies, bees, and other
wildlife in ways that non-native plants cannot; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State is home to approximately 2,000 native  plant
species,  which  include  large  shade trees, shrubs, perennials, vines,
grasses, and wildflowers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Unique to New York State, the plants thriving in our  great
State have evolved over thousands of years alongside native wildlife and
have  developed  symbiotic  relationships which can not be replaced with
non-native plants that have been transported here from distant parts  of
the world; native insects, caterpillars, and other wildlife have not had
time to evolve to be able to eat these strange and exotic foods; and
 
  WHEREAS, Some of New York's rarest plants are federally listed under
the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973; according to the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation, there  are  approximately  340
plants  in  New  York  State  listed  as endangered by the United States
Department of Interior; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is a strong and growing movement  to  protect  native
plants and to educate the public about their benefits to pollinators and
 
other  wildlife, to our economy, and to the health and sustainability of
New York's fragile ecosystems; and
 
  WHEREAS, The observation of the month of April as Native Plant Month
encourages  New  York's  citizens  to participate by removing non-native
invasive plants in our yards and  communities,  planting  native  trees,
shrubs,  and  flowers,  hosting  native plant hikes, creating pollinator
gardens, and educating our citizens about the many  benefits  of  native
plants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Native  Plant Month in New York State is meant to call for
awareness of and recognition of the importance of native plants  to  New
York's rich biological heritage, and as a source of food for pollinators
and  native  wildlife,  and  for  those who work tirelessly on behalf of
researching and protecting our natural surroundings for the  benefit  of
present and future generations of New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  2023,  as  Native
Plant  Month  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with National
Native Plant Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and The Garden Club of America.
