BY: Senator OBERACKER
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  225th  Anniversary  of  the
  Chenango County Sheriff's Office
 
  WHEREAS, The quality of life in New York State is largely reflective
of the commitment and dedication demonstrated by members of the agencies
which serve to protect, preserve and maintain public order; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
honor  those  distinguished  citizens  who  devote their life's work and
purpose to public service, contributing to the care and welfare  of  the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  225th  Anniversary  of  the  Chenango County Sheriff's
Office which was celebrated at a Ceremony on Wednesday, March 22,  2023;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Located in the courthouse, the county's first jail was made
of  wood, making it unsecure and vulnerable to fires started by escaping
convicts who endangered the lives of their fellow inmates, officers, and
staff and jeopardizing the edifice itself; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1830, the legislature authorized the supervisors to levy
and collect tax for the construction of a stone building for the custody
of prisoners, and seven years later, the courthouse was completed; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than seven decades later,  the  Board  of  Supervisors
voted  to  build  a  new  jail  and  Sheriff's  residence to replace the
deteriorating one; the plans submitted by Architect  W.J.  Beardsley  of
Poughkeepsie,  were  chosen  and the cost of the new building was raised
through the sale of bonds; on May 23, 1903, the current Chenango  County
Jail was finished and occupied; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  under the luminous leadership of Sheriff Ernest R.
Cutting, Jr., the Chenango County Sheriff's Office continues  to  remain
true  to  its  mission of providing public service and protection of the
citizens of the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each and every officer and staff member  are  committed  to
ensuring  every citizen with whom they interact is treated with dignity,
compassion and respect; the safety and well-being of the members of  the
community are truly their number one concern as they continue to protect
the  constitutional  freedoms  of  all and to continue to fairly enforce
local laws and ordinances and the laws of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, By working together with the community, the Chenango County
Sheriff's Office diligently works to solve problems, maintain the peace,
provide safety and security for citizens and reduce the fear  of  crime;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its inception, the Chenango County Sheriff's Office
has demonstrated continuous service to  the  residents  and  communities
which it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  tradition  of  altruistic public service, heroism and
leadership embodied by the Chenango County Sheriff's Office is  of  such
magnitude  as  to  be  worthy  of  special,  statewide recognition; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  225th  Anniversary  of  the  Chenango County Sheriff's
Office; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Sheriff Ernest R. Cutting, Jr., Chenango County Sheriff's
Office.
