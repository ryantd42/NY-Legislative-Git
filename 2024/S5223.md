 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to  requiring  state  and
  local law enforcement officers to identify themselves to the public
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Declaration of legislative intent and findings. The  legis-
 lature  finds that the people of the state of New York are in great debt
 to the hard work and  dedication  of  police  officers  in  their  daily
 duties.  The  legislature further finds that mistrust of law enforcement
 officers based on real or perceived discrimination hinders law  enforce-
 ment  efforts and is a threat to public safety. New York state and local
 police policy already requires that officers wear shields and nameplates
 at all times while in uniform, and that they provide their  rank,  name,
 shield number and command when asked.
  In  adopting this act, it is the intent of the legislature to increase
 transparency in police practices and to build trust between police offi-
 cers and members of the public by providing the public  with  notice  of
 the  reasons  behind  their  encounters  with  the police, and a written
 record of their interactions with the police in situations that  do  not
 result in an arrest or summons.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a new article 13-B to read
 as follows:
  ARTICLE 13-B
  IDENTIFICATION OF STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
