birdwatching;  attendees  can  take  a  bird  walk,  view eagles through

  WHEREAS, Furthermore, prior to 1995, the bald eagle was listed as an
endangered  species  and  eventually removed in 2007 after years of bald
eagle conservation programs by vital organizations such as  the  Teatown
Lake Reservation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Teatown Lake Reservation is a nonprofit, environmental
organization which has a 1,000 acre preserve in the lower Hudson Valley;
the land is utilized by  schools,  scouts,  families  and  other  groups
wishing to experience and learn about nature and wildlife; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  2002,  the  Teatown  Lake  Reservation  has  hosted
Eaglefest, where countless bird watchers come to  see  the  bald  eagles
feed  and mate; this auspicious event has allowed people to consistently
see this majestic animal in its  natural  environment,  while  providing
people  with  the  opportunity  to learn about saving and preserving the
bald eagle in American history; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition,  Eaglefest offers the chance for visitors to
speak with animal rights advocates and ambassadors, take  bus  tours  of
the  reservation,  and  learn about other wildlife in need of protection
from extinction; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  the
continuing  welfare  of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly
enriched  and  reliably  served  by  the  purposeful  endeavors  of
organizations  that  are  committed  to  the preservation of our natural
environment and the enhancement of the appreciation of  the  distinctive
features  of  our  surroundings,  and  to the economic well-being of the
areas in which they exist; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  Teatown  Lake Reservation upon the occasion of hosting its
20th Annual Eaglefest on February 3, 2024; and be it further
