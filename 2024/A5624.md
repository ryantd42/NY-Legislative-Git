 ria shall provide (a) as to hardship applications, for  a  finding  that
 the level of fair rent increase is not sufficient to enable the owner to

 ment  fees)  for the three year period ending on or within six months of
 the date of an application pursuant to such criteria  as  compared  with

 teen hundred sixty-eight through nineteen hundred seventy,  or  for  the
 first three years of operation if the building was completed since nine-
 teen  hundred  sixty-eight  or  for the first three fiscal years after a

 on  or  before July first of such year, one-quarter of such amount on or
 before October first of such year, one-quarter  of  such  amount  on  or
 before  January  first  of  the  following  year and one-quarter of such
 amount on or before March thirty-first of the following year.  After the
 close of the fiscal year of the state, the commissioner, in consultation
 with the director of the budget, shall determine the amount of all actu-
 al costs incurred in such fiscal year and shall certify such  amount  to
 such city. If such certified amount shall differ from the amount paid by
 the  city for such fiscal year, appropriate adjustments shall be made in
 the next quarterly payment to be made by such city. In  the  event  that
 the amount thereof is not paid to the commissioner, in consultation with
 the  director  of the budget, as herein prescribed, the commissioner, in
 consultation with the director of the budget, shall certify  the  unpaid
 amount  to the comptroller, and the comptroller shall, to the extent not
 otherwise prohibited by law, withhold such amount  from  any  state  aid
 payable to such city. In no event shall the amount imposed on the owners
 exceed [twenty] TEN dollars per unit per year.
  e. The failure to pay the prescribed assessment not to exceed [twenty]
 TEN  dollars  per unit for any housing accommodation subject to this act
 or the New York city rent stabilization law of nineteen  hundred  sixty-
 nine  shall constitute a charge due and owing such city, town or village
 which has imposed an annual charge for each such  housing  accommodation
 pursuant  to  subdivision  b  of  this  section.  Any such city, town or
 village shall be authorized  to  provide  for  the  enforcement  of  the
 collection of such charges by commencing an action or proceeding for the
 recovery  of  such fees or by the filing of a lien upon the building and
 lot. Such methods for the enforcement of the collection of such  charges
 shall be the sole remedy for the enforcement of this section.
