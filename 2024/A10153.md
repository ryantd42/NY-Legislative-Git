  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 352-a of the education law,

 laws of 2023 and subdivision 3 as added by section 1 of part F of  chap-
 ter 83 of the laws of 2002, are amended to read as follows:
  2.  (a)  Maritime  college  shall have a total of [two hundred eighty-
 four] FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN vacancy positions set aside  for  appli-
 cants  who are nominated by the governor, a state senator or a member of
 the assembly. Such vacancy nominations shall increase or decrease  based
 upon the number of senate districts authorized pursuant to article three
 of  the  New  York  state constitution. An applicant who receives such a
 nomination, is accepted for admission into the college and  participates
 in  the  regimental  program  shall  receive  a scholarship equal to the
 amount of the state tuition charge after the deduction of any  available
 grant  aid for the four consecutive years following his or her admission
 into the program provided, however, that  the  student  remains  in  the
 regimental/cadet degree program and remains at all times in good academ-
 ic  standing as determined by the maritime college administration. In no
 event shall a student lose [his or her]  THEIR  scholarship  based  upon
 legislative  reapportionment  or  changes  in legislative composition or
 membership.  Nothing herein shall be construed to limit  or  reduce  the
 number of vacancies available to the general population.
  (b)  To  be  eligible  to receive such nomination and scholarship, the
 applicant must be a resident of the state. For purposes of this section,
 a state resident shall be defined as a person who  has  resided  in  the
 state of New York for a period of at least one year prior to the time of
 nomination,  is  a  graduate  or  within  one year of graduation from an
 approved high school or has attained a New York state high school equiv-
 alency diploma or its equivalent as determined by the commissioner.
