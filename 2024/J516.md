  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Fair Housing Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside to increase  awareness  of  important
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  2023, as Fair
Housing Month in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Fair Housing Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Every April, we come together as a community, a State and a
Nation  to  celebrate the anniversary of the passing of the Fair Housing
Act and to recommit to that goal which inspired us in the  aftermath  of
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's assassination in 1968: to eliminate
housing  discrimination and create equal opportunity in every community;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Fundamentally, fair housing means  that  every  person  can
live  free; this means communities across the State of New York are open
and welcoming, free from housing discrimination and hostility; and
 
  WHEREAS, This also means that each one of us,  regardless  of  race,
color,  religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and disability,
has access to neighborhoods  of  opportunity,  where  our  children  can
attend  quality  schools,  our  environment allows us to be healthy, and
economic opportunities and self-sufficiency can grow; and
 
  WHEREAS, The law prohibits discrimination in the sale,  rental,  and
financing of housing, and requires Federal, State, and local governments
to  proactively  dismantle  the discriminatory structures that held back
people of color and other underserved populations from equitable  access
to the neighborhoods of their choice; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Access  to quality housing is the foundation for achieving
better educational, employment, and health outcomes, as well as  one  of
the  most  important  ways that families build wealth that they can pass
along across the generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the  Fair  Housing  Act  continues  to  serve  as  a
powerful statement about who we are as a people: the values of equality,
equity,  and  dignity  that we strive to uphold, and the places where we
still have work to do to fulfill our full promise as a Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, While there is still much work to  be  done,  the  law  has
truly  changed  the  lives  for  the  better  of  numerous  families and
communities over the last 55 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fair Housing Month is a time to raise awareness of the need
for a strong and effective Fair Housing Act to ensure  that  thoughtless
 
and  unnecessary  barriers  like  these  do  not  block  the  path  to
opportunity; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  2023,  as  Fair
Housing Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
