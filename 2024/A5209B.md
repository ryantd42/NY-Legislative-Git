  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would increase the wage ranges to which member contribution
 rates are applied for Tier 6 members effective April 1, 2024 by  $5,000.
 Beginning  on April 1, 2025, the wage ranges would increase each year by
 the annual inflation rate rounded up to the next tenth of a percent, not
 to exceed 3%.
  The current contribution rates and wage ranges for Tier 6 members are:
  3% for wages of $45,000 or less
  3.5% for wages greater than $45,000 and less than or equal to $55,000
  4.5% for wages greater than $55,000 and less than or equal to $75,000
 A. 5209--B  11
 
  5.75% for wages greater  than  $75,000  and  less  than  or  equal  to
 $100,000
  6.0% for wages greater than $100,000
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), increased costs  would  be  shared  by  the
 State  of  New  York  and all participating employers in the NYSLERS. If
 this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there will  be
 an  increase  in the present value of future costs of approximately $588
 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by  increasing
 the  billing rates charged annually. The annual contribution required of
 all participating employers in NYSLERS is approximately 0.2% of billable
 salary, or $26 million to the State of New York  and  approximately  $38
 million  to  the  local participating employers.  This PERMANENT ANNUAL
 COST will vary in subsequent billing cycles with  changes  in  the  wage
 ranges and salary of the affected members.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), increased costs would  be  shared  by
 the  State  of New York and all participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
 If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there  will
 be  an  increase  in  the present value of future costs of approximately
 $11.2 million.
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged annually. The annual contribution required  of
 all  participating  employers  in  NYSLERS is less than 0.1% of billable
 salary, or approximately $225,000 to the State of New York and  approxi-
 mately  $890,000  to  the  local participating employers. This PERMANENT
 ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes  in  the
 wage ranges and salary of the affected members.

  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated January 31,  2023,  and  intended  for  use  only
 during  the  2023  Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note  No. 2023-30,
 prepared by the Actuary for the New  York  State  and  Local  Retirement
 System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend various sections of the Retirement and Social
 Security Law and the Education Law to increase the salary ranges used in
 determining the employee contribution percentages  for  Tier  6  members
 thereby  decreasing  future required employee contributions. The current
 A. 5209--B  12
 
 salary ranges would each increase by $5,000 on April 1, 2024.  Beginning
 on  April 1, 2025, salary ranges would then be increased annually by the
 increase in the consumer price index in the one year  period  ending  on
 December thirty-first of the year prior, not to exceed 3%.
  The  annual  cost  to  the  employers of members of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System for this benefit is estimated  to  be  $30.0
 million or 0.16% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The  System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer contribution
 rate that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without  any
 assets, is equal to 5.15% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture.  This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost of
 Tier 6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed  change
 to  the  Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new entrant rate
 is estimated to increase to 5.60% of pay, an increase of 0.45% of pay.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report.  Actuar-
 ial assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valu-
 ation Report.

 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New  York  State  Teachers'
 Retirement  System and is intended for use only during the 2023 Legisla-
 tive Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the New York
 State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the American Academy
 of Actuaries and I meet the  Qualification  Standards  of  the  American
 Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL:  This proposed legislation as it relates to the New
 York City Retirement Systems and  Pension  Funds  (NYCRS),  would  amend
 Section 613 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to increase
 the salary bands used to determine contribution rates for Tier 6 members
 of the New York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS), the New York
 City  Teachers'  Retirement System (NYCTRS), and the New York City Board
 of Education Retirement System (BERS).
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS: Currently, Tier 6 members  of  NYCERS,
 NYCTRS,  and  BERS  are generally required to make Basic Member Contrib-
 utions (BMC) ranging from 3% to 6% of annual wages, determined by  wages
 for a prior defined period.
  Under the proposed legislation, the salary bands used to determine BMC
 would  be  1) increased by specified amounts as shown in the table below
 on January 1, 2024, and  2)  increased  by  the  prior  calendar  year's
 increase in consumer price index (CPI). The increase due to CPI starting
 on January 1, 2025, and every year thereafter, is not to exceed 3%.
  The  result  of an increase in Tier 6 salary bands would be an overall
 decrease in employee contribution rates.
 
  Contribution  New Salary Band as of
  Rate  Current Salary Band  January 1, 2024
  3.00%  $45,000 or less  $50,000 or less
  3.50%  $45,001 up to $55,000  $50,001 up to $60,000
  4.50%  $55,001 up to $75,000  $60,001 up to $80,000
  5.75%  $75,001 up to $100,000  $80,001 up to $105,000
  6.00%  Greater than $100,000  Greater than $105,000
 A. 5209--B  13
 
  FINANCIAL IMPACT: Based on the census data and the  actuarial  assump-
 tions  and  methods  described  herein,  the  enactment of this proposed
 legislation would result in an initial increase in the present value  of
 future  employer  contributions  of  approximately  $174.8  million  for
 NYCERS,  $84.3 million for NYCTRS, and $14.3 million for BERS, resulting
 in a total increase of approximately $273.4 million for NYCRS.
  The  financial  impact  will  increase  as  the  impacted  population
 increases  over  time.  The  estimate of the increase in annual employer
 contributions for Fiscal Years 2024 through 2028 are shown in the  table
 below.
 
  Increase in Employer Contributions
  ($ Millions)
  Fiscal  NYCERS  NYCTRS  BERS  TOTAL
  Year
  2024  $ 15.4  $ 5.9  $ 1.3  $ 22.6*
  2025  $ 17.7  $ 6.6  $ 1.9  $ 26.2
  2026  $ 20.3  $ 7.3  $ 2.5  $ 30.1
  2027  $ 23.2  $ 8.3  $ 3.1  $ 34.6
  2028  $ 26.3  $ 9.3  $ 3.8  $ 39.4
 
  *  The  increase in the employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2024 is
 estimated to be $16.0 million for New York City and $6.6 million for the
 other obligors of NYCRS.
  New Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to  benefit  changes
 are  generally  amortized  over  the remaining working lifetime of those
 impacted by the benefit changes.  The  remaining  working  lifetime  for
 impacted  Tier  6 members is approximately 16 years for those in NYCERS,
 20 years for those in NYCTRS, and 14 years for those in BERS.
  The increase in UAL for NYCERS was therefore amortized over a  16-year
 period  (15  payments  under  the  One-Year Lag Methodology) using level
 dollar payments.  Under the same methodology the increase in the UAL for
 NYCTRS and BERS was amortized over 19 and 13 payments, respectively.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used  in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuations of NYCERS, NYCTRS,
 and BERS to determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contrib-
 utions.
  The table below contains a summary of the census data for active  Tier
 6 members in NYCERS, NYCTRS, and BERS as of June 30, 2022.
 
  NYCRS  Active  Average  Average  Average
  Count  Age  Service  Salary
  NYCERS  77,127  41.9  4.2  $76,100
  NYCTRS  56,614  37.5  4.6  $77,000
  BERS  12,264  46.3  3.7  $53,100
 
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal  Year  2024  employer  contributions  of  NYCERS,
 NYCTRS, and BERS.
  New  entrants  were projected to replace the members expected to leave
 the active population to maintain a steady-state population. New entrant
 demographics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actu-
 arial judgement.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 A. 5209--B  14
 
 valuations of NYCERS,  NYCTRS,  and  BERS  used  to  determine  employer
 contributions for Fiscal Year 2024.
  It  has  been  assumed that future increases in the salary bands under
 this proposed legislation would equal 2.5%, consistent  with  the  long-
 term CPI inflation rate assumption of 2.5%.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted population, and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  * Pension costs for future members of NYCERS, NYCTRS, and  BERS  hired
 on or after 7/1/2026.
