  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:

 the annual inflation rate rounded up to the next tenth of a percent, not
 to exceed 3%.

  3% for wages of $45,000 or less
  3.5% for wages greater than $45,000 and less than or equal to $55,000
  4.5% for wages greater than $55,000 and less than or equal to $75,000

  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), increased costs  would  be  shared  by  the
 State  of  New  York  and all participating employers in the NYSLERS. If
 this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there will  be
 an  increase  in the present value of future costs of approximately $588
 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by  increasing
 the  billing rates charged annually. The annual contribution required of
 all participating employers in NYSLERS is approximately 0.2% of billable
 salary, or $26 million to the State of New York  and  approximately  $38
 million  to  the  local participating employers.  This PERMANENT ANNUAL
 COST will vary in subsequent billing cycles with  changes  in  the  wage
 ranges and salary of the affected members.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), increased costs would  be  shared  by
 the  State  of New York and all participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
 If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there  will
 be  an  increase  in  the present value of future costs of approximately
 $11.2 million.
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged annually. The annual contribution required  of
 all  participating  employers  in  NYSLERS is less than 0.1% of billable
 salary, or approximately $225,000 to the State of New York and  approxi-
 mately  $890,000  to  the  local participating employers. This PERMANENT
 ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes  in  the
 wage ranges and salary of the affected members.
