  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS: Currently, Tier 3 normal service retire-
 ment, early service  retirement,  and  vested  retirement  benefits  for
 members  in  22-Year  Plans are subject to an offset equal to 50% of the
 primary social security benefit as defined in RSSL Section 511 beginning
 at age 62.
  Under the proposed legislation, the offset for such benefits would  be
 eliminated resulting in an increase in benefits.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  *  New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so that total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
 A. 5798--A  5
