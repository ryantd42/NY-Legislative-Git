  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Sections 505,
 511, and 516 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to  elimi-
 nate  the  offset equal to 50% of the primary Social Security benefit in
 the normal service, early service, and vested  retirement  benefits  for
 Tier  3  uniformed  members  in  the  original,  revised,  modified, and
 enhanced plans (i.e., the 22-Year Plans) of the New York City Employees'
 Retirement System (NYCERS),  the  New  York  City  Police  Pension  Fund
 (POLICE), and the New York City Fire Pension Fund (FIRE) who are subject
 to Article 14 of the RSSL.
  Effective Date: Sixty days after enactment.
  IMPACT  ON  BENEFITS:  Currently,  the  RSSL Article 14 normal service
 retirement, early service retirement, and vested retirement benefits for
 members in 22-Year Plans are subject to an offset equal to  50%  of  the
 primary Social Security benefit as defined in RSSL Section 511 beginning
 at age 62.
  Under  the proposed legislation, the offset for such benefits would be
 eliminated resulting in an increase in benefits.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT: Based on the census data and the  actuarial  assump-
 tions  and  methods  described  herein,  the  enactment of this proposed
 legislation would result in an initial increase in the Present Value  of
 Future Benefits (PVFB) and the present value of future employer contrib-
 utions  of  approximately  $316.0 million for NYCERS, $675.0 million for
 POLICE, and $94.4 million for FIRE, resulting in  a  total  increase  of
 approximately $1.1 billion for NYCRS.
  The  financial  impact  will  increase  as  the  impacted  population
 increases over time. The estimate of the  increase  in  annual  employer
 contributions  for Fiscal Years 2024 through 2028 are shown in the table
 below.
 
  Increase in Employer Contributions
  ($ Millions)
  Fiscal
  Year  NYCERS  POLICE  FIRE  TOTAL
 
  2024  $ 27.3  $ 50.8  $ 6.4  $ 84.5
  2025  $ 29.3  $ 54.8  $ 7.1  $ 91.2
  2026  $ 30.9  $ 59.1  $ 7.9  $ 97.9
 A. 5798  4
 
  2027  $ 33.1  $ 63.9  $ 8.6  $ 105.6
  2028  $ 35.6  $ 69.4  $ 9.3  $ 114.3
 
  New  Unfunded  Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to benefit changes
 are generally amortized over the remaining  working  lifetime  of  those
 impacted  by  the  benefit  changes.  The remaining working lifetime for
 impacted Tier 3 members is approximately 17 years for those  in  NYCERS,
 18 years for those in POLICE, and 19 years for those in FIRE.
  The  increase in UAL for NYCERS was therefore amortized over a 17-year
 period (16 payments under the  One-Year  Lag  Methodology)  using  level
 dollar  payments. Under the same methodology the increase in the UAL for
 POLICE and FIRE was amortized over 17 and 18 payments, respectively.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used  in  the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS, POLICE,
 and FIRE to determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contrib-
 utions.
  The table below contains a summary of the census data for active  Tier
 3 members in Article 14 22-Year Plans in NYCERS, POLICE, and FIRE.

  NYCRS  Active  Average  Average  Average
  Count  Age  Service  Salary
 
  NYCERS  7,085  38.5  6.3  $96,700
  POLICE  19,375  32.2  5.7  $101,600
  FIRE  4,469  32.9  5.2  $106,300
 
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal  Year  2024  employer  contributions  of  NYCERS,
 POLICE, and FIRE.
  New  entrants  were projected to replace the members expected to leave
 the active population to maintain a steady-state population. New entrant
 demographics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actu-
 arial judgement.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of  NYCERS,  POLICE,  and  FIRE  used  to  determine  employer
 contributions for Fiscal Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial,  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement the
 proposed legislation.
  * Pension costs for future members of NYCERS, POLICE, and  FIRE  hired
 on or after 7/1/2026.
  *  Cost  analyses  relating  to  provisions  contained in RSSL Section
 500(c).
