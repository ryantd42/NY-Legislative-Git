  provisions upon expiration thereof

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Section 552 of the executive law, as added by section 3 of
 part A of chapter 501 of the  laws  of  2012,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  § 552. Organization of the justice center. 1. The justice center shall
 house  the  vulnerable persons' central register created in section four
 hundred ninety-two of the social services law and shall perform  all  of
 the necessary functions related to the receipt and acceptance of reports
 of allegations of reportable incidents involving vulnerable persons, the
 investigation  of  such accepted reports and the review of substantiated
 findings of abuse or  neglect,  as  defined  in  subdivision  eleven  of
 section  four hundred eighty-eight of the social services law, including
 conducting any disciplinary proceedings for  state  employees  resulting
 from such substantiated findings (for state entities bound by collective
 bargaining,  the  disciplinary  process  established  through collective
 bargaining shall govern). The justice center shall contain two  separate
 units,  headed by two distinct deputies, one responsible for the [prose-
 cution] INVESTIGATION of criminal matters and one for the  INVESTIGATION
 AND  resolution  of  non-criminal  matters. If, during an investigation,
 what appeared to be a non-criminal  matter  warrants  consideration  for
 criminal  charges, the matter shall be promptly referred to the criminal
 unit AS WELL AS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH
 MATTER. Information collected during such  investigations  may  only  be
 shared between such units in accordance with state and federal constitu-

 tional  protections  and  laws  and  the secrecy provisions contained in
 article one hundred ninety of the  criminal  procedure  law,  unless  so
 ordered by a court in a pending proceeding.
  2.  (a)  The justice center also shall employ a special prosecutor and
 inspector general for  the  protection  of  people  with  special  needs
 ("special  prosecutor"),  who  shall be appointed by the governor. Other
 state agencies shall be required to make facilities available for office
 space throughout the state and to assist when requested with respect  to
 the  duties  of  the office. Pursuant to the provisions of this section,
 such special prosecutor shall have the duty and power: (i)  to  investi-
 gate  and,  UPON  THE CONSENT OF A DISTRICT ATTORNEY, prosecute offenses
 involving abuse or neglect, as defined in subdivision eleven of  section
 four  hundred eighty-eight of the social services law, committed against
 vulnerable persons by  custodians  as  defined  in  subdivision  two  of
 section  four  hundred eighty-eight of the social services law; and (ii)
 to cooperate with and assist district  attorneys  and  other  local  law
 enforcement  officials in their efforts against such abuse or neglect of
 vulnerable persons.  Provided that nothing  herein  shall  DIMINISH  OR
 interfere  with the ability of district attorneys at any time to receive
 complaints, investigate [and] OR  MAINTAIN  THE  ULTIMATE  AUTHORITY  TO
 prosecute  any  OFFENSE  INVOLVING  THE  suspected abuse or neglect OF A
 VULNERABLE PERSON, or for any persons, whether a  mandated  reporter  or
 not,  to  report a complaint to a district attorney or other appropriate
 law enforcement official. The special prosecutor may request  and  shall
 receive, from any agency, department, division, board, bureau or commis-
 sion of the state, or any political subdivision thereof, cooperation and
 assistance  in  the  performance  of  his or her duties, and may provide
 technical and other assistance to any district attorney or law  enforce-
 ment  official requesting assistance in the investigation or prosecution
 of OFFENSES INVOLVING THE abuse or neglect of vulnerable persons.
  (b) The special prosecutor, OR ONE OF  HIS  OR  HER  ASSISTANTS,  DULY
 AUTHORIZED  PURSUANT  TO PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, is empowered
 to apply for search warrants pursuant to article six hundred  ninety  of
 the  criminal procedure law, and, except in exigent circumstances, shall
 give prior notice of the application to the  district  attorney  of  the
 county  in  which  such a warrant is to be executed, and in such exigent
 circumstances shall give such notice as soon thereafter as is  practica-
 ble;  provided,  however  that  the  failure  to give notice of a search
 warrant application to a district attorney shall  not  be  a  ground  to
 suppress  the  evidence  seized in executing the warrant. [He or she may
 designate an assistant to exercise any of such powers.]
  (c) The special prosecutor or  one  of  his  or  her  assistants  DULY
 AUTHORIZED  PURSUANT  TO  PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, may[, after
 consultation with the district attorney as to the time and place of such
 attendance or appearance,] attend in person any  term  of  [the  county]
 court  [or  supreme court] having appropriate jurisdiction, including an
 extraordinary special or trial term of the supreme  court  when  one  is
 appointed  pursuant  to  section one hundred forty-nine of the judiciary
 law, or appear before the grand jury thereof, for the purpose of  manag-
 ing  and  conducting in such court or before such jury a criminal action
 or proceeding concerned with an offense where any  conduct  constituting
 or requisite to the completion of or in any other manner related to such
 offense involved the abuse or neglect of a vulnerable person, as defined
 in subdivision eleven of section four hundred eighty-eight of the social
 services  law.  [In  such  case,  such  special prosecutor or his or her
 assistant so attending may exercise all the powers and perform  all  the
 A. 5066  3

 duties  in  respect  of  such  actions or proceedings which the district
 attorney would otherwise  be  authorized  or  required  to  exercise  or
 perform.]

 CONDUCTED,  all  prosecutions  for crimes and offenses cognizable by the
 courts of the county for which he or she  shall  have  been  elected  or
 appointed;  except  when  the place of trial of an indictment is changed
 from one county to another, it shall be the duty of the district  attor-
 ney  of the county where the indictment is found to conduct the trial of
 the indictment so removed, and it shall be  the  duty  of  the  district
 attorney  of the county to which such trial is changed to assist in such
 trial upon the request of the district attorney of the county where  the
