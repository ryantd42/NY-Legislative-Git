  CONGRATULATING  Sandra Jordan upon the occasion of
  her retirement as Deputy County Clerk after 27 years
  of distinguished service to Madison County, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  seeks  to  acknowledge  those
individuals  whose  professional  lives  and  civic  endeavors  serve to
enhance the stature of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, For the past 27 years,  Sandra  Jordan  rendered  faithful,
conscientious,  and  valuable service to the residents of Madison County
and its neighboring communities, beginning her  career  as  a  recording
clerk and spending more than a decade in the Treasurer's Office prior to
her retiring as Deputy County Clerk; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  the  pandemic, Sandra Jordan's sacrificial service
ensured that the Madison County Clerk's Office remained open every  day,
providing  uninterrupted  assistance  to  the  county's constituents who
needed to purchase a home or record a new mortgage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sandra Jordan became  one  of  a  small  number  of  deputy
clerks,  who  were  assigned  to  a  recording office, to cross over and
become proficient in the procedures and services of  the  Department  of
Motor Vehicles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  a  time  when  it  was imperative for other offices to
suspend their unrestricted  customer  service,  Sandra  Jordan  answered
thousands  of  phone calls to assist individuals from Madison, Onondaga,
and Oneida counties, navigating the processing of vehicle registrations;
she exceeded her duties as a public servant, distributing license plates
and registrations curbside, regardless of the weather; and
 
  WHEREAS, In her capacity  as  Deputy  County  Clerk,  Sandra  Jordan
served  with  loyalty,  honor,  and distinction; she was customarily the
first person to open the office in the morning and the last one to leave
at the end of the day; every one of her customers  was  greeted  with  a
smile; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In her official acts, Sandra Jordan was governed by a keen
sense of duty and always  showed  a  unique  grasp  of  human  problems,
assisting  others in need and providing essential services to members of
her community; and
 
  WHEREAS, During her tenure with Madison County, Sandra Jordan earned
the admiration, esteem, and affection of her colleagues; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  Sandra  Jordan,  Madison County's Deputy County Clerk, the
esteemed role from which she will retire, for 27 years of  distinguished
service; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Sandra Jordan.
