  (B)  SUCH  RELEASE  SHALL  BE  GRANTED  ONLY AFTER THE BOARD CONSIDERS
 WHETHER, IN LIGHT OF THE INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL'S  MEDICAL  CONDITION,
 THERE  IS  A REASONABLE PROBABILITY THAT THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL, IF
 RELEASED, WILL LIVE AND REMAIN AT LIBERTY WITHOUT VIOLATING THE LAW, AND

 INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL'S SENTENCE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER  PROVISION
 OF LAW.

 THE REQUEST OF AN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL, OR AN  INCARCERATED  INDIVID-
 UAL'S  SPOUSE, RELATIVE OR ATTORNEY, MAY, IN THE EXERCISE OF THE COMMIS-
 SIONER'S DISCRETION, DIRECT  THAT  AN  INVESTIGATION  BE  UNDERTAKEN  TO
 DETERMINE WHETHER A DIAGNOSIS SHOULD BE MADE OF AN INCARCERATED INDIVID-
 UAL  WHO  APPEARS  TO  REQUIRE THE LEVEL OF CARE TYPICALLY PROVIDED IN A
 NURSING HOME SETTING OR, BECAUSE OF THEIR PHYSICAL OR  COGNITIVE  CONDI-
 TION, ARE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM BASIC LIFE ACTIVITIES. ANY

 BOARD MAY POSTPONE  ITS  DECISION  PENDING  COMPLETION  OF  AN  ADEQUATE
 DISCHARGE PLAN, OR MAY DENY RELEASE BASED ON INADEQUACY OF THE DISCHARGE
 PLAN.

 NEE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE DEEMED  A  JUDICIAL  FUNCTION  AND
