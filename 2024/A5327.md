 a  member  of the New York state and local employees' retirement system,
 who for the period beginning January 1, 2006  and  ending  November  19,
 2018,  was  employed as a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals with the
 town of Orchard Park, and who, for reasons not  ascribable  to  her  own
 negligence,  failed  to become a member of such retirement system during
 such employment with the town of Orchard Park, shall be deemed  to  have
 joined  the New York state and local employees' retirement system on the
 date January 1, 2006, if within one year of the effective date  of  this
 act, she shall file a written request with the state comptroller.
  §  2. No contributions made to the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system by Kim Bowers shall be returned  or  refunded  to  her
 pursuant to this act.
  §  3.  All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this
 act shall be borne by the town of Orchard Park.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.

  This bill would grant retroactive Tier 4 status in the New York  State
 and  Local  Employees' Retirement System to Kim Bowers, a current Tier 6
 member employed by the Erie County Water Authority,  by  changing  their
 date of membership to January 1, 2006. There will be no refund of member

 annual contributions of the Erie County Water Authority for  the  fiscal
 year  ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the
 billing rates and salary of Kim Bowers change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $13,900 which will be
 borne by the Town of Orchard Park as a one-time payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
