  FISCAL NOTE.-- Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill is a technical correction to Chapter  714  of  the  Laws  of
 2023.  It would allow fire districts in Suffolk County that participate
 in the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System to elect to
 provide individuals employed in the title of emergency  medical  techni-
 cian,  advanced  emergency medical technician, critical care technician,
 or paramedic, and supervisors of these titles, the option to retire upon
 completion of twenty-five years of creditable service with a benefit  of
 one-half  of  final  average  salary  (FAS) and an additional benefit of
 one-sixtieth of FAS for each year of creditable  service  in  excess  of
 twenty-five  years.  Members in Tiers 3 - 6 would be limited to 15 years
 of additional one-sixtieths.
  As a technical amendment to Chapter 714  of  the  Laws  of  2023,  the
 fiscal  costs  quoted  for that bill still apply. There is no additional
 cost associated with this bill.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could  be  affected  by  this  legislation cannot be readily determined.
 Prior to electing to provide these benefits, an eligible  fire  district
 would be required to submit a roster of individuals in covered titles to
 the  New  York  State  and Local Retirement System. This roster would be

 used to develop an exact cost for the individual fire district  electing
 to provide these benefits.
