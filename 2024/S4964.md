 years from the date which such attorney was first employed as a district
 attorney.
  (ii)  "District  attorney"  means  the district attorney of one of the
 counties of the state or an employee of the office of any such  district
 attorney.
  (iii)  "Indigent  legal services attorney" means an attorney who is an

 who  are  financially  unable  to  obtain  counsel; (B) a not-for-profit
 corporation that is exempt from the  payment  of  federal  income  taxes
 pursuant  to  section  501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code and estab-

 permitted  by  section  four  hundred  eighty-four of the judiciary law,
 adjusted for any interruption in employment.  Any  period  of  temporary
 leave from service taken by an eligible attorney shall not be considered
 in  the  calculation of qualified service. However, the period of tempo-
 rary leave shall be considered an interruption  in  employment  and  the
 calculation  of  the  time  period of qualified service shall recommence
 when the eligible attorney returns to full time service.
  3. Awards. a. An eligible attorney may apply for  reimbursement  after
 the  completion  of each year of qualified service provided however that

 service within the time periods prescribed by the president. An eligible

 years of qualified service within an eligible period.
