  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 9, 2024, as Law Enforcement Appreciation Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, New York State has long been committed  to  supporting  its
law enforcement professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 9, 2024,  as  Law  Enforcement
Appreciation  Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the State of New York, various  law  enforcement
advocacy  organizations  will  be  observing  this  well-deserved day of
appreciation of our law enforcement members; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is increasingly being recognized  that  the  jobs  which
these  professionals  face in their lines of duty are both dangerous and
difficult; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Day of National Law Enforcement Appreciation is a  time
to  recognize and reflect on the sacrifice which so many of our friends,
family, and fellow New Yorkers make on a daily basis to keep us safe  in
our homes, places of work, and on the streets; and
 
  WHEREAS, Recognizing the importance of the work that law enforcement
conducts  on  a daily basis whether it be tackling petty crime or taking
down  foreign  terror  operations  to  keep  New  Yorkers  safe,  these
professionals  are  among  the best our State has to offer, being highly
skilled, disciplined, and well trained  to  execute  their  duties  with
courage and bravery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  increasingly  dangerous to perform these jobs in a
world where law enforcement are targeted for the uniforms they wear  and
the duties they perform in the line of service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  focusing  on  the importance of those who serve in law
enforcement, we would hope to bring attention to the difficulties  their
jobs  present  and the bravery so many exude in their everyday lives; we
may also highlight that too often New York law enforcement professionals
from across our great State are not appreciated and give them  a  moment
to know that New York stands behind them; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 9,  2024,  as  Law
Enforcement  Appreciation  Day  in the State of New York, and to applaud
those who have dedicated their lives to keeping New  Yorkers  safe  from
criminals,  terrorists,  and  those who would otherwise do harm to them;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
