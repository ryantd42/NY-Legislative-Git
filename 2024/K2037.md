Indian Arrival Day celebrates the rich history, cultural importance, and
incredible contributions of the Indo-Guyanese; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  day marks the anniversary of the arrival of the first

from  Calcutta  to work on the sugar plantations as indentured laborers;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Indian population continued to grow, with about 240,000
people coming from the Indian subcontinent to British  Guiana  by  1917;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Indian population flourished and now contributes to all
facets  of  life  in  Guyana,  constituting  almost  40  percent  of the
population and the largest ethnic group in the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York City is home to the  largest  Guyanese  expatriate
community  in  the  world, with a population of over 140,000, comprising
one of the largest  international-born  populations  in  the  city,  and
living  predominantly  in  Queens,  with  a  large  concentration  of
Indo-Guyanese residing in Richmond Hill and Ozone Park; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to Guyana, numerous nations  in  the  Americas,
Oceania,  and Africa celebrate their own versions of Indian Arrival Day,
demonstrating the worldwide reverence for the outstanding  contributions
of the global Indian diaspora; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 5, 2024, as Indian
