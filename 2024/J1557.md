  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 13, 2024, as Women's Checkup Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, Women's Checkup Day celebrates the  extraordinary  progress
in women's health and recognizes that more needs to be done to safeguard
the health of women for generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 13, 2024, as Women's  Checkup  Day
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Women's Checkup Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Held annually on the second Monday in May, Women's Checkup
Day focuses on the importance of regular checkups and  doctor's  visits,
and  encourages  all women to take more steps to maintain better health;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The history of women's health has been different from  that
of men for multiple reasons including social, biological, and behavioral
factors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Traditionally,  women have been at a disadvantage in terms
of economic and social status, and this has  affected  their  access  to
healthcare;  multiple  experts  expound  on  the need to change 'women's
health' to the term 'the health of women,' to broaden the  focus  around
the health issues women face, which historically only put an emphasis on
reproductive health; and
 
  WHEREAS, The health of women has also been impacted by the fact that
women  are  underrepresented  in  most  major research studies; however,
countries  like  the  United  States  and  other  Western  nations  are
addressing  this by setting up organizations and trials like the Women's
Health Initiative; and
 
  WHEREAS, The turning point in this  moment  ran  parallel  to  other
international  women's  movements  across  the  world;  with  the  labor
movements during the 20th Century in North America  and  across  Europe,
more  and more women began demanding equality and parity, culminating in
equal access to healthcare; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2015, the World Health Organization identified  the  top
ten women's health issues as being cancer, reproductive health, maternal
health,  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV),  sexually  transmitted
infections, violence, mental health, non-communicable  diseases,  youth,
and aging; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Women's  Checkup  Day's promotion of regular doctor visits
gives women a higher chance of identifying  underlying  health  problems
and  the  ability  to treat them on time; discussions between healthcare
providers and women can also rule out  certain  problems  and  highlight
others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  encouraging  a  healthy lifestyle, Women's Checkup Day
allows women to take control of  their  bodies  and  inspire  others  to
embrace healthy habits; furthermore, it can also reduce healthcare costs
by taking preventative action in case of illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Women's health remains a priority for families, communities
and  government, and our commitment to keeping women healthy is stronger
than ever; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 13, 2024, as Women's
Checkup Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
