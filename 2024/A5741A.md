 status date is on or before April fourteenth, income tax year shall mean
 the  twelve-month  period  for which the owner or owners filed a federal
 personal income tax return for the year before the income tax year imme-
 diately preceding the date of application and where the  taxable  status
 date  is  on  or  after  April fifteenth, income tax year shall mean the

 ty  as  provided  in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of this subdivi-
 sion, then only the income of the spouse or ex-spouse  residing  on  the

 dends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may
 be  offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the
 same income tax year, net rental income, salary  or  earnings,  and  net

 therefor. In  addition,  an  exchange  of  an  annuity  for  an  annuity
 contract,  which  resulted in non-taxable gain, as determined in section
 one thousand thirty-five of the internal revenue code, shall be excluded
 from  such income. Provided that such exclusion shall be based on satis-
 factory proof that such an exchange was solely an exchange of an annuity
 for an annuity contract that resulted in a non-taxable  transfer  deter-
 mined  by  such  section of the internal revenue code. Furthermore, such
 income shall not include the proceeds of a reverse mortgage, as  author-
 ized  by  section  six-h  of  the  banking law, and sections two hundred
 eighty and two hundred eighty-a of  the  real  property  law;  provided,
 however,  that  monies  used  to  repay  a  reverse  mortgage may not be
 deducted from income, and provided additionally  that  any  interest  or

 standing,  such  income  shall  not  include veterans disability compen-
 sation, as defined in Title 38 of the United States  Code  provided  the
 governing  board  of  such  municipality, after public hearing, adopts a
 local law, ordinance or resolution providing therefor. In computing  net

 deduction shall be allowed for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real  or

 sand dollars beginning July first, two thousand  seventeen,  as  may  be
 provided  by  the  local  law  or  resolution  adopted  pursuant to this
 section. THE MAXIMUM INCOME  THRESHOLD  PROVIDED  FOR  HEREIN  SHALL  BE
