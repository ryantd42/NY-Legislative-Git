 ing such voter to submit a signature for  identification  purposes.  The

 with  a  party  or  to  decline  to  enroll with a party and contain the
 following statement in prominent type "ONLY ENROLLED MEMBERS OF A  POLI-
 TICAL PARTY MAY VOTE IN THAT PARTY'S PRIMARIES." Such form shall provide
 a  clear  alternative for the applicant to decline to affiliate with any
