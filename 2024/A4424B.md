 AN  ACT  to  amend the agriculture and markets law, the general business
  law and the public health law, in relation to food  and  food  product
  advertising
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and  intent.  The  legislature  hereby
 finds  that  children  are an inherently vulnerable population, and that
 marketing unhealthy foods in a targeted and persistent  manner  to  this
 group  is  inconsistent with this state's efforts to curb the disastrous
 health outcomes that follow the overconsumption of these products.  Such
 marketing  is  inherently  misleading,  as  children often lack the same
 ability to resist the rewarding cues presented in unhealthy food market-
 ing as adults.  New York has  a  strong  and  substantial  interest  in
 protecting our children from negative health consequences. Additionally,
 the power of the state is at its greatest when protecting the health and
 welfare  of  its  citizens,  especially those most vulnerable. Thus, the
 legislature finds that unfair and deceptive marketing targeted at  chil-
 dren  can mislead and manipulate children into lifelong habits, and that
 such unfair and deceptive advertising should be regulated accordingly.
  § 2. Section 202-a of the agriculture and markets law  is  amended  by
 adding a new subdivision 4 to read as follows:
  4.  IN  DETERMINING  WHETHER A VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION HAS OCCURRED,
 THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER FACTORS  AND  SPECIAL  CONSIDERATION  GIVEN  TO
 ADVERTISING  DIRECTED  AT  A  CHILD  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION THREE HUNDRED
 FIFTY-A OF GENERAL BUSINESS LAW.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
