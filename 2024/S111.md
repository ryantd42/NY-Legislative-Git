 human life and property, the sheriff shall deem it necessary to hire any

  § 4. Subdivision 1 of section 150 of the town law, as amended by chap-
 ter 476 of the laws of 2018, is amended to read as follows:
  1. The town board of any town may establish a  police  department  and
 appoint  a  chief  of  police and such officers as may be needed and fix
 their compensation. The compensation of such police officers shall be  a
 town charge; providing however, no assessment on property in any village
 within any town or partially within any town shall be made for the main-
 tenance or operation of a town police department established after Janu-
 ary  first, nineteen hundred sixty, pursuant to this section if any such
 village maintains a police department of four or more police officers on
 an annual full-time basis, established and maintained under the rules of
 civil service. The town board may, at its  option,  determine  that  the
 town  shall  pay  all  or part of the cost of the uniforms and necessary
 equipment of its police officers, and may purchase  such  equipment  for
 use  by  the  police  department  as  it shall deem necessary, including
 police patrol vehicles, and emergency service vehicles for police use in
 connection with accidents, public calamities or other emergencies.  THE

 ACCEPTANCE, OR PURCHASE OF  MILITARY  WEAPONS  FROM  THE  UNITED  STATES
 GOVERNMENT.  No assessment on property in any village within any town in
 the county of Suffolk or in any village within the  town  of  Fallsburgh
 shall  be  made  for  the  maintenance  or operation of such town police
 department, if any such village maintains a police department of two  or
 more  police  officers  on an annual basis. In the event that a town has
 established a police department prior to January first, nineteen hundred
 sixty, the town board of such town may enter into an agreement with  any
 village  within  it  or  partially  within  it  which maintains a police
 department of four or more police officers on an annual full-time basis,
 established and maintained under the rules of civil service  and  deter-
 mine therein what part of the cost thereof shall be assessed against the
 property  in the village and what part thereof shall be assessed against
 the property in the town outside of the village. Thereafter such portion
 of the cost thereof determined to be assessed  outside  of  the  village
 shall  be  a charge against that part of the town outside of the village
 and assessed, levied and collected from the  taxable  property  of  that
 part  of  the  town  outside of the village. When appointed, such police
 officers shall have all the powers and be subject to all the duties  and
 liabilities  of a police officer in all criminal actions and proceedings
 and special proceedings of a criminal nature.
  § 5. Chapter 360 of the laws of 1911 relating  to  police  in  certain
 municipalities  is  amended  by  adding  a  new  section  4-a to read as
 follows:
  § 4-A. ANY COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE, CHIEF  OF
