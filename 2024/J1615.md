in New York as a nonprofit organization, thereby extending its reach and

  WHEREAS,  Fundacion  Rica  Inc.  has  been  a  crucial  sponsor  and
supporter  of  educational  excellence,  as  demonstrated  by  their

outstanding Dominican and Dominican-origin students  in  various  states
under the jurisdiction of the New York consulate; and

dedication  to  recognizing  and  encouraging academic achievement among
young learners; and

acknowledging  their  continuous  support  and  contributions;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
