  COMMEMORATING  the  25th  Anniversary  of  Abraham
  House on November 3, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  commend  those
illustrious  organizations  of  the  State  of  New York whose focus and
intent have made a substantial impact on the quality of  life  in  their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 25th Anniversary of Abraham House on Friday, November 3,
2023,  to be celebrated at the Double Tree by Hilton of Utica, New York;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Abraham House is designed to care for individuals who  have
reached  the  end  of  curative  therapy  options;  this  extraordinary
organization provides personal care,  based  closely  on  the  model  of
caring  for a loved one at home, and welcomes all individuals regardless
of diagnosis, gender, religion, race, or financial status; and
 
  WHEREAS, Abraham House was  established  in  1998,  when  the  Utica
property  was donated by Dr. and Mrs. Abraham L. Shaheen for the purpose
of caring for those who are dying; and
 
  WHEREAS, Staying true to the promise that a  young  Dr.  Abraham  L.
Shaheen  made  to  his  father  to "be a doctor for the people and not a
doctor for the money," Abraham House was founded with  the  intent  that
its guests and families would not be charged for services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Two  decades  later, Abraham House continues to honor that
promise, relying solely on donations, fundraising and grants  to  ensure
the continued success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Structured  based  on  the  model of a family caring for a
loved one's needs in a home setting, Abraham  House  offers  around  the
clock  health  and hygienic care via its surrogate caregivers, relieving
families of the responsibility of providing care for their loved one  so
they may focus on the remaining time they have together; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  its  formative  years,  Abraham  House  was run by
Reverend Frederick Daley and the Sisters of St. Joseph, primarily caring
for those who were dying from AIDS; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Abraham House cares for an equal number of  men  and
women, ranging in age from 21-99; admission is prioritized based on need
and preference is given to those who are in need of the highest level of
care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  September  of  2019,  Abraham House Rome, a 6-bed home
located on the corner  of  Washington  and  Thomas  streets,  officially
opened.  Formerly  known as the Rome Home, a facility for the elderly,
the property was donated in 2017 to provide end of  life  care  for  the
residents of Rome, New York and neighboring communities; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  true to its mission, Abraham House provides its
terminally ill guests and their families a safe and loving home with all
the support needed for dignified end-of-life care, free of any financial
burdens; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its distinguished 25-year history, Abraham  House  has
demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Abraham House is in  direct  correlation  to
the  efforts  of  its  staff  and  volunteers, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
individuals of such noble aims and accomplishments are  brought  to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  25th Anniversary of Abraham House on November 3, 2023;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Abraham House, of Utica and Rome, New York.
