 AN  ACT in relation to refunding penalties accrued on certain real prop-
  erty taxes in the town of Scarsdale, county of Westchester
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the custodian
 of taxes of the town of Scarsdale, county of  Westchester,  shall,  upon
 approval  by  the  Scarsdale town board, refund any penalties accrued on
 real property taxes owed by any owner of real  property  located  within
 such  town  who  failed  to  pay the 2023-2024 school taxes on or before
 September 30, 2023, or on or before September 30, 2023 and  January  31,
 2024  if  such person elected to pay such taxes in two installments, due
 to the specific failure by the United States Postal Service  to  deliver
 real  property tax bills in August 2023 or September 2023 for such taxes
 to such owners. In order to be  eligible  for  the  relief  contemplated
 herein,  any  owner of real property in the town of Scarsdale who failed
 to receive a 2023-2024 real property tax bill for such property that has
 not been otherwise delinquent for school, village or county taxes  bill-
 ings  for  2021,  2022, or 2023, may apply for a refund pursuant to this
 act to the Scarsdale town custodian of taxes in a manner and form to  be
 determined by the Scarsdale town board, provided that no penalties shall
 be refunded on the 2023-2024 school tax if such tax payment was not paid
 in full, including any penalties by March 31, 2024.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
