 laws  of  2014, subparagraphs 5 and 6 as amended by section 11 of part A
 of chapter 54 of the laws of 2016, and clause (B) of subparagraph  5  as
 amended  by  section 5 of part YYY of chapter 59 of the laws of 2017, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (e) In a city school district in a city having  a  population  of  one
 million  or  more  inhabitants,  charter  schools  that  [first commence
 instruction or that require additional space  due  to  an  expansion  of
 grade  level, pursuant to this article, approved by their charter entity
 for the two thousand fourteen--two thousand fifteen school year or ther-
 eafter and] request co-location in a public  school  building  shall  be
 provided  access to facilities pursuant to this paragraph for such char-
 ter schools that first commence instruction or that  require  additional
 space  due  to  an  expansion  of grade level, pursuant to this article,
 approved by their charter entity for those grades newly provided.
  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, within
 the later of (i) five months after a charter  school's  written  request
 for  co-location and (ii) thirty days after the charter school's charter
 is approved by its  charter  entity,  the  city  school  district  shall
 either: (A) offer at no cost to the charter school a co-location site in
 a  public school building approved by the board of education as provided
 by law, or (B) offer the charter school space in a  privately  owned  or

 appropriate and comparable and in the community school  district  to  be
 served by the charter school and otherwise in reasonable proximity.
  (2) No later than thirty days after approval by the board of education
 or expiration of the offer period prescribed in subparagraph one of this
 paragraph,  the  charter  school  shall  either  accept  the city school
 district's offer or appeal in accordance with subparagraph three of this
 paragraph. If no appeal is taken, the city's offer or refusal to make an
 offer shall be final and non-reviewable. The charter school  may  appeal
 as early as issuance of an educational impact statement for the proposed
 co-location.
  (3)  The  charter  school  shall have the option of appealing the city
 school district's offer or failure to offer a co-location  site  through
 binding  arbitration in accordance with subparagraph seven of this para-
 graph, an expedited appeal to the commissioner pursuant to section three
 hundred ten of this chapter and the procedures prescribed  in  paragraph
 (a-5)  of  this subdivision, or a special proceeding pursuant to article
 seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules. In any  such  appeal,
 the  standard  of  review  shall  be  the standard prescribed in section
 seventy-eight hundred three of the civil practice law and rules.
  (4) If the appeal results in a determination  in  favor  of  the  city
 school  district, the city's offer shall be final and the charter school
 may either accept such offer and move into the space offered by the city
 school district at the city school  district's  expense,  or  locate  in
 another site at the charter school's expense.
  (5)  [For  a  new  charter  school  whose charter is granted or for an
 existing charter school whose expansion of grade level, pursuant to this
 article, is approved by their charter entity, if] IF the appeal  results
 in  a  determination  in  favor  of  the charter school, the city school
 district shall pay the charter school an  amount  [attributable  to  the
 grade  level  expansion or the formation of the new charter school] that
 is equal to the lesser of:
  (A) the actual rental cost of  an  alternative  privately  owned  site
 selected by the charter school or
  (B)  thirty  percent  of  the  product  of  the charter school's basic
 tuition for the current school year and [(i) for a  new  charter  school
 that  first  commences  instruction on or after July first, two thousand
 fourteen,] the charter school's current year enrollment[; or (ii) for  a
 charter  school which expands its grade level, pursuant to this article,

 current  school year minus the charter school's enrollment in the school
 year prior to the first year of the expansion].
