  COMMEMORATING  the  60th  Anniversary  of  IMPACCT
  Brooklyn
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body that the  quality
and  character of life in this great Empire State is greatly enriched by
the faithful and diligent work of those  organizations  which  serve  to
meet the needs of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of IMPACCT Brooklyn; and
 
  WHEREAS,  IMPACCT  Brooklyn  is a community development organization
focused on the following core tenets:  preserve  and  develop  safe  and
affordable  housing, a basic human right; support vibrant local commerce
through which small businesses serve the needs of  community  residents;
sustain  and  develop economic, racial, and cultural diversity to enrich
the lives of all; promote knowledge, initiative, and concerted action to
advance individual and common interests; and foster an  ethic  that  all
members  of  the community bear personal responsibility to contribute to
the greater good; and
 
  WHEREAS, Formerly the  Pratt  Area  Community  Council  until  2015,
IMPACCT  Brooklyn  was  established  in  1964  by  three  civic  minded
individuals:  Reverend Richard Johnson, Amos Taylor, and  Furman  Walls;
their  efforts  getting  attention  from  politicians,  bureaucrats,
recalcitrant landlords, and private agencies, the people of Fort Greene,
Clinton Hill, the Wallabout Community,  and  later  Bedford  Stuyvesant,
fought  for  decent,  affordable  housing, tenants' rights, and economic
renewal; and
 
  WHEREAS, By 1966, IMPACCT Brooklyn was winning important concessions
from the New York City government, with 7,000 petition  signatures  they
contributed  to  bettering the local police protection; in 1967, IMPACCT
Brooklyn's Library Committee  submitted  5,000  signatures  to  Brooklyn
Borough  President  Abe  Stark,  asking that the Brooklyn Library open a
Clinton Hill branch, it opened in 1974; and
 
  WHEREAS, IMPACCT Brooklyn's Housing  Committee  was  established  to
create  innovative  ways to save deteriorating housing stock in 1970; an
Anti-Demolition Committee was formed, advocating for  a  change  in  New
York  City  policy,  away  from demolition and towards preservation, and
instigating a federal policy  to  arrange  for  the  sale  of  federally
financed  abandoned  buildings  to  local residents and the city seal-up
program; and
 
  WHEREAS, To address  concerns  about  housing  abandonment,  IMPACCT
Brooklyn  established  a  full-time,  professionally  staffed office and
concentrated on keeping people in their homes, developing and preserving
affordable housing, protecting  tenant  rights,  and  helping  community
residents  become  first-time  homeowners or improve the properties they
already owned in 1980; in addition, the organization initiated the Block
 
Watch Program and became a member of the newly formed  NYS  Neighborhood
Preservation Program, electing Roy Crouch as the Executive Director; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1982,  IMPACCT Brooklyn purchased 201 Dekalb Avenue as
their current administration and finance office; then in  1984,  IMPACCT
Brooklyn  encouraged  the formation of tenant associations, particularly
in buildings where conditions had become intolerable; and
 
  WHEREAS, When the Mohawk building was vacated  following  a  serious
fire,  IMPACCT  Brooklyn  partnered  with the Mohawk Action Committee to
redevelop the site, which re-opened in 1984  as  the  first  sale  of  a
city-owned building requiring community reinvestment dollars; and
 
  WHEREAS, After creating Supportive Housing in 2002, IMPACCT Brooklyn
opened  the  Gibb  Mansion;  the Gibb Mansion is now home to 50 formerly
homeless residents who receive  supportive  counseling  services;  Steve
Aronson became executive director, serving until 2004; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of IMPACCT Brooklyn is in direct correlation to
the  efforts  of its Board of Directors and staff, whose involvement is,
and always has been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the institution and the community it  serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
organizations  which  unselfishly  devote  their  energy,  talent  and
thoughtful  care  on behalf of improving the quality and dignity of life
in the community, are worthy and due full  praise  and  recognition  for
their noble and dedicated efforts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of IMPACCT Brooklyn; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to IMPACCT Brooklyn.
