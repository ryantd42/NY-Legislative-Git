  (9)  All  revenues  resulting from the imposition of the tax under the
 local law shall be paid into the treasury of the county  of  Albany  and
 shall  be  credited  to  and  deposited  into  [three]  special funds as
 follows:
  (a)  Until the completion date as defined in subparagraph four of this
 paragraph:
  (1) Revenues from the tax imposed by such local law up  to  an  amount
 equal to one-sixth of such total revenue shall be credited to and depos-
 ited  in a special fund for convention and tourist development provided,
 however, that such local law shall provide  that  the  county  shall  be
 authorized  to  retain up to a maximum of ten per centum of such revenue
 to defray the necessary expenses of the  county  in  administering  such
 tax.  The  revenue derived from this portion of the tax, after deducting
 the amount provided for administering such  tax,  as  so  authorized  by
 local  law,  shall be allocated to pay for services performed subject to
 the terms and conditions contained in contracts  which  may  be  entered
 into  between  the  county and the Albany County Convention and Visitors
 Bureau, Inc. The funds so allocated shall be used  for  the  purpose  of
 promoting  Albany  county,  its  cities, towns and villages, in order to
 increase convention/trade show and tourist business.
  (2) Revenues from the tax imposed by such  local  law  equal  to  two-
 thirds  of  such  total  revenue shall be credited to and deposited in a
 special account to be known as the "civic center debt service  fund"  to
 be  created  by the county of Albany therefor and to be maintained sepa-
 rate and apart from any other funds and accounts of the  county.  Moneys
 in  such  account  shall be deposited in one or more of the banks desig-
 nated in the manner provided by law, as a depository  of  the  funds  of
 such  county.  Pending expenditure from such fund, moneys therein may be
 invested in the manner provided in section 6-f of the general  municipal
 law  or  in a successor statute to such section authorizing the types of
 investments which may be made by political  subdivisions.  Any  interest
 earned  or  capital gain realized on the moneys so deposited or invested
 shall accrue and become part of the fund. Such  local  law  may  provide
 that  any  moneys  in such fund shall be used, subject to appropriation,
 solely for the purpose of making debt service  payments  on  obligations
 issued  by the county to finance the acquisition, development (including
 construction), operation and repair and continuing use  and  maintenance
 of  a  civic  center  and  ancillary  facilities  therefor  (the "Albany
 project") at a site located in the city of Albany, county of Albany  and
 state  of  New  York,  bounded  generally by the South Mall Arterial and
 South Pearl, Howard and Eagle streets (the "Albany site")  which  ancil-
 lary  facilities  shall  include  but  not be limited to, any buildings,
 structures, parking facilities,  machinery,  equipment,  facilities  and
 appurtenances incidental thereto.
  (3) Revenues from the tax imposed by such local law equal to one-sixth
 of  such  total  revenue shall be credited to and deposited in a special
 fund to be known as the "Albany convention center authority fund" to  be
 created  by  the county of Albany therefor and to be maintained separate
 and apart from any other funds and accounts of the county.  Moneys  in
 such  account  shall be deposited in one or more of the banks designated
 in the manner provided by law, as a depository  of  the  funds  of  such
 county.  Pending  expenditure  from  such  fund,  moneys  therein may be
 invested in the manner provided in section 6-f of the general  municipal
 law  or  in a successor statute to such section authorizing the types of
 investments which may be made by political  subdivisions.  Any  interest
 earned  or  capital gain realized on the moneys so deposited or invested
 A. 9865--A  3
 
 shall accrue and become part of the fund. Moneys in this fund  shall  be
 used  solely  and  exclusively by the Albany convention center authority
 for the development of a convention center project to be located in  the
 city  of  Albany.  The  county shall pay the moneys in such fund over to
 such authority upon application for such moneys by the authority.
  (4) As used in this subdivision, the term "completion date" shall mean
 the date on which the architect for the convention center project issues
 a certificate of substantial completion in substantial  conformity  with
 AIA  Document  G704-2000  stating that the convention center facility is
 sufficiently complete in accordance with the contract or  contracts  for
 construction  that the owner can occupy or utilize the convention center
 facility for its intended use.
  (b) On and after the completion date as defined in  subparagraph  four
 of paragraph (a) of this subdivision:

 expenses of the county in administering such tax].  The revenue  derived
 from  this  portion of the tax[, after deducting the amount provided for
 administering such tax, as so authorized by local law,] shall  be  allo-
 cated  to pay for services performed subject to the terms and conditions

 ited in one or more of the banks designated in the  manner  provided  by

 used,  subject  to  appropriation, solely for the purpose of making debt
 service payments on obligations issued by  the  county  to  finance  the

 provided  in  section 6-f of the general municipal law or in a successor
 statute to such section authorizing the types of investments  which  may
 be  made by political subdivisions.  Any interest earned or capital gain
 realized on the moneys so deposited or invested shall accrue and  become
 part  of  the  fund. Moneys in this fund shall be used solely and exclu-
