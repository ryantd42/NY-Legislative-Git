 all counties of the state, and all municipalities  which  have  a  popu-
 lation  of  ten thousand or greater, have at least one method of accept-
 ance that is available within such county or municipality.  The  depart-
 ment  may  establish  additional  requirements  to  ensure  convenient
 collection from consumers] TO MEET MINIMUM  COLLECTION  REQUIREMENTS,  A
 MANUFACTURER OR THE MANUFACTURER'S AGENT OR DESIGNEE SHALL USE GEOGRAPH-
 IC  MODELING TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERMANENT SITES

 OR  DESIGNEE  BY  A  LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR PRIVATE PARTY. THE SCHEDULE FOR
 SUCH COLLECTION EVENTS  SHALL  BE  MADE  AVAILABLE  TO  THE  PUBLIC  AND

 OUTLETS,  AND  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ORGANIZATIONS  WHICH HAVE AGREED WITH THE
 MANUFACTURER OR ITS AGENT OR DESIGNEE  TO  PROVIDE  FACILITIES  FOR  THE
 COLLECTION OF ELECTRONIC WASTE.
  NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL PROHIBIT A COUNTY OR SOLID WASTE AUTHOR-
 ITY,  AT  ITS  DISCRETION,  TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT COLLECTION SITE FOR
 ELECTRONIC WASTE TO MEET THE CONVENIENCE STANDARD, AND THE MANUFACTURER,
 OR ITS AGENT OR DESIGNEE, SHALL ACCEPT ALL COVERED ELECTRONIC  EQUIPMENT
 SO  COLLECTED AT NO COST TO THE MUNICIPALITY, AND SHALL REIMBURSE TO THE
 MUNICIPALITY THE REASONABLE COSTS OF PREPARING THE  COLLECTED  EQUIPMENT
 FOR SHIPMENT.

 TIVE ELECTRONIC WASTE ACCEPTANCE  PROGRAM  TO  ACHIEVE  THE  CONVENIENCE

 ORATION WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND THE OPERATOR OF EACH ELECTRONIC  WASTE

 acceptance program, including at a minimum ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:

 reuse, and in the case of manufacturers of computers,  hard  drives  and
 other  covered  electronic  equipment that have internal memory on which
 personal or other confidential data can be stored,  such  website  shall
 provide  instructions  for  how  consumers  can destroy such data before
 surrendering the products for recycling or  reuse;  (ii)  advertisements

 and  press releases [if any]; AND (III) POST-PURCHASE ELECTRONIC NOTIFI-

  §  3.  Subdivision 8 of section 27-2605 of the environmental conserva-
 tion law, as added by chapter 99 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read
 as follows:
  8. A manufacturer shall be responsible for all costs  associated  with
 the implementation of the electronic waste acceptance program, INCLUDING
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL COSTS OF COLLECTION, TRANSPORTATION AND RECYCLING
 OF COVERED ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT.  A MANUFACTURER SHALL CONTINUE TO COVER
 THE  FULL  COSTS  OF COLLECTION, TRANSPORTATION AND RECYCLING OF COVERED
 ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT, AND ITS COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER SUBDIVI-
 SION ONE OF THIS SECTION  SHALL  CONTINUE,  REGARDLESS  OF  WHETHER  THE
 ACCEPTANCE STANDARD IN SUBDIVISION FOUR OF SECTION 27-2603 OF THIS TITLE
 IS  ACHIEVED  FOR  THE  YEAR.  The manufacturer OR ITS AGENT shall not
 charge consumers, MUNICIPALITIES OR ELECTRONIC  WASTE  COLLECTION  SITES
 for  the  collection,  handling  and  recycling  and reuse of electronic
 waste, provided that such prohibition shall not apply  to  a  charge  on
 business  consumers or to charges for premium services. This prohibition
 shall not apply to a manufacturer's contract with  a  consumer  for  the
 collection,  handling,  recycling  or reuse of electronic waste that was
 entered into prior to the effective date of this section.  For  purposes
 of this subdivision, "business consumer" means a for-profit entity which
 has  fifty  or  more full time employees or a not-for-profit corporation
 with seventy-five or more full time employees, but not a  not-for-profit
 corporation  designated  under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue
 code. For purposes of this subdivision, "premium services" means  equip-
 ment  and data security services, refurbishment for reuse by the consum-
 er, and other custom services as may be determined by the department.
  § 4. Section 27-2603 of the environmental conservation law is  amended
 by adding a new subdivision 8 to read as follows:
  8.  A  PERSON  OPERATING AN ELECTRONIC WASTE COLLECTION SITE, AN ELEC-
 TRONIC WASTE CONSOLIDATION FACILITY OR  AN  ELECTRONIC  WASTE  RECYCLING
 FACILITY  AND  HAVING A REASONABLE GROUND TO BELIEVE THAT A MANUFACTURER
 HAS FAILED OR IS FAILING TO COVER ALL COSTS OF  COLLECTION,  TRANSPORTA-
 TION  OR  RECYCLING  OF  COVERED  ELECTRONIC  EQUIPMENT, MAY REQUEST THE
 DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE SUCH ALLEGED FAILURE AND, UPON  A  FINDING  BY
 THE  DEPARTMENT  THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS FAILED OR IS FAILING TO COVER
 SUCH COSTS, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ORDER  THE  MANUFACTURER  TO  PAY  SUCH
 COSTS.
  § 5. Paragraphs (f) and (h) of subdivision 1 of section 27-2617 of the
 environmental  conservation  law,  as added by chapter 99 of the laws of
 2010, are amended to read as follows:
  (f) the names and locations of electronic waste  recycling  facilities
 utilized  by  the manufacturer and entities to which electronic waste is
 sent for reuse, whether  SUCH FACILITIES OR ENTITIES ARE LOCATED in  the
 state  or outside the state, including details on the methods of recycl-
 ing or reuse of electronic waste, any disassembly or  physical  recovery
 operation used, and the environmental management measures implemented by
 [such]  EACH recycling facility or entity IDENTIFIED BY THE MANUFACTURER
