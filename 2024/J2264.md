  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as Adolescent  and  Young  Adult  Cancer
  Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as Adolescent
and Young Adult Cancer Awareness Month in the  State  of  New  York,  in
solidarity with all New York State residents and their families fighting
cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  annual  awareness month is an opportunity to shine a
light on the unique challenges that teen and young adult cancer patients
and survivors face; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Young  Adult  Cancer  Patients  are  identified  as  those
diagnosed between 18-39 years of age, impacting 90,000 new patients each
year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cancer  diagnosis  rates, especially for breast, prostate,
endometrial, cervical, colorectal and  other  gastrointestinal  cancers,
among  people under 50 are on the rise; the diagnosis rate increasing 13
percent in the Nation since 2000, many individuals in this age group are
too young for regular cancer screenings, meaning their  disease  can  go
undiagnosed for longer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recent data shows individuals born in the 90s are twice as
likely to develop early onset colon cancer and four times as  likely  to
develop rectal cancer as someone born in the 50s; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital  month  of  recognition is providing teens and
young adults dealing with a cancer diagnosis  opportunities  to  develop
healthy  habits during and after treatment, helping to reduce the burden
of healthcare within the local community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Awareness and education are powerful tools in the  race  to
find a cure for adolescent and young adult cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  health  and  vitality  of  the people of New York are
significantly enhanced by local efforts to  increase  communication  and
education pertaining to cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as  Adolescent
 
and  Young Adult Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
