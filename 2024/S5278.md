 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to establishing a fatali-
  ty review board and providing for such board's powers and duties
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent. The legislature hereby declares that
 domestic violence is a pervasive and frequently lethal problem in Ameri-
 can society and in New York state. Nationwide, on average, approximately
 ten women are killed by their batterers every day.  Battering  is  the
 single,  major cause of injury to women, resulting in more injuries than
 auto accidents, muggings, and rapes  combined.  Such  abuse  is  also  a
 strong  indicator that physical or sexual abuse of children is occurring
 in the family. Domestic violence devastates its  victims  and  threatens
 the  stability  of the family and negatively affects all family members,
 especially children who witness the violent abuse.  Domestic  violence
 also  affects  the  entire community. The incidence of domestic violence
 adversely affects the safety, health, and welfare of communities as well
 as societal economies by draining billions of dollars  in  social  costs
 associated  with  medical expenses, law enforcement, and lost productiv-
 ity.
  The legislature finds that multi-disciplinary domestic violence fatal-
 ity review boards have been used successfully to ensure  that  incidents
 of  domestic  violence  are  recognized  and  that agency involvement is
 reviewed to improve  the  responsiveness  of  public  agencies  for  the
 reduction  and  eradication  of  domestic violence. The establishment of
 such a board is similar to the time-honored  mortality/morbidity  review
 conference utilized by the medical profession to ensure the provision of
 quality medical care.
  The  legislature further finds that it is in the interest of the state
 to provide for the creation of a fatality review board in New York.  The

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 board will facilitate communication among courts and agencies, allow for
 the  identification  of  preventable deaths, and provide for recommenda-
 tions with a view toward improving the system's ability to prevent  such
 occurrences.  The purpose of the inter-agency, multi-disciplinary review
 is not punitive, but to increase the thoroughness and  effectiveness  of
 systematic  responses  by  developing  recommendations  for policies and
 protocols for prevention and intervention initiatives.  In  addition  to
 reviewing cases, the fatality review board may also provide guidance and
 protocols  for  the  development  and implementation of local reviews by
 counties or other jurisdictions. The board may also identify trends  and
 patterns  of  domestic  violence  deaths and recognize the prevalence of
 risk factors which exist in the population of victims and  perpetrators.
 This  data  could  be helpful in the development of system interventions
 and policy changes for persons who are at risk.
  By enacting this legislation, the legislature seeks to provide a  case
 review  process for the purpose of reducing the incidence of preventable
 deaths from domestic violence.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a  new  section  837-x  to
 read as follows:
