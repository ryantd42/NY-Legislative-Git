  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 2, 2024, as Vitamin D Day in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious health
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  November  2,  2024,  as
Vitamin  D  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
observance of World Vitamin D Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, People around the world are  losing  their  battle  against
vitamin D deficiency and more and more are becoming vitamin D deficient;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  estimated  that  more  than  one  billion  people
throughout the world have low vitamin D levels; this occurs  because  we
are  living,  working,  and spending more time indoors than ever before;
and
 
  WHEREAS, We are now told to apply sunscreens every day, year  round,
which  if applied properly prevents vitamin D production; with up to 90%
of our vitamin D coming from sunlight, without unprotected sun  exposure
our bodies cannot make vitamin D naturally; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Vitamin  D Day, now in its 15th year, is celebrated
annually on November 2nd as part of Vitamin D Awareness  Month  to  warn
the  public of vitamin D deficiency and to increase the public's ability
to take action and increase their vitamin D intake; and
 
  WHEREAS, A new World Vitamin D Day website  has  been  developed  to
help  inform  people  on the importance of maintaining optimal vitamin D
blood levels of between 40-60 ng/ml; and
 
  WHEREAS, Vitamin D helps reduce your  risk  of  cancers,  autoimmune
diseases  and  heart  problems,  and strengthens your bones and muscles,
helping you live longer; according to Dr. William B. Grant,  maintaining
optimal  vitamin D blood levels may increase your life expectancy by two
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Research has found that optimal vitamin  D  levels  reduces
your  risk  of  many major diseases; it controls the switches that guide
cellular life in your body and tells your genes and DNA what to do; and
 
  WHEREAS, To stop vitamin D deficiency, adults will need a vitamin  D
intake of approximately 4,000 IU or 100 mcg a day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, to increase your vitamin D intake through the
winter when sunshine is diminished and the  UV  index  is  below  three,
consider  using  indoor sources such as UVB emitting sunbeds or sunlamps
 
as a surrogate for summer sunshine; you can also add more fatty fish  to
your diet or take a daily D3 supplement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  November  2,  2024,  as
Vitamin D Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
