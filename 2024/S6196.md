 Where a judgment affecting the title to, or the possession, enjoyment or
 use  of,  real  property  allots to any person a distinct parcel of real
 property, or contains a direction for the  sale  of  real  property,  or
 confirms  such  an allotment or sale, it also may direct the delivery of
 the possession of the property to the person entitled  thereto,  subject
 to the rights and obligations set forth in section thirteen hundred five
 of this chapter.
  (B) UPON A FINDING BY A CIVIL OR CRIMINAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDIC-
 TION  THAT A TRANSFER OF TITLE TO REAL PROPERTY WAS EFFECTED IN WHOLE OR
 IN PART BY FRAUD, THE COURT IN ITS WRITTEN  JUDGMENT  SHALL  DIRECT  THE
 DELIVERY  OF  THE POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY TO THE PERSON WHO OR ENTITY
 THAT THE COURT FINDS TO BE THE LAST BONA  FIDE  OWNER  OF  THE  PROPERTY
 PRIOR  TO  THE  FRAUDULENT  TRANSFER AND SHALL DIRECT THAT TITLE TO SUCH
 PROPERTY BE RESTORED TO SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY. THE COURT  SHALL  ARRANGE
 FOR  THE JUDGMENT AND ORDER TO BE PROVIDED TO THE OFFICES OF THE RECORD-
 ING CLERK FOR THE COUNTY OR CITY IN WHICH THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED.  THE

 DOCUMENTS RELATING TO SUBSEQUENT CONVEYANCES OF TITLE THAT WERE  DEPEND-
 ENT  UPON  THE  FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE AND DOCUMENTS. SUCH NOTATION SHALL
 REFERENCE THE JUDGMENT AND  ORDER AND INDICATE THE NAME OF THE PERSON OR
 ENTITY LEGALLY ENTITLED TO POSSESSION OF AND TITLE TO THE PROPERTY.
  (C) AT THE TIME OF ISSUANCE OF A JUDGMENT AND ORDER NULLIFYING A FRAU-
 DULENT  TRANSFER  OF  TITLE  TO  PROPERTY  AND  DIRECTING  DELIVERY  OF
 POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY TO THE PERSON ENTITLED THERETO, AS  DESCRIBED
 IN  PARAGRAPH  (B)  OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE COURT ISSUING SUCH JUDGMENT
 AND ORDER SHALL PROVIDE NOTICE OF THE JUDGMENT AND ORDER TO  ANY  PERSON
 OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDINGS WHO OR THAT ASSERTS AN INTEREST
 OF  RECORD  IN  AND  TO THE FRAUDULENTLY TRANSFERRED PROPERTY BASED UPON
 SUBSEQUENT CONVEYANCES OF TITLE THAT WERE DEPENDENT UPON  THE FRAUDULENT
 CONVEYANCE AND DOCUMENTS. SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY SHALL BE  PROVIDED  WITH
 AN  OPPORTUNITY  TO BE HEARD BEFORE THE COURT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF BEING
 SERVED WITH THE NOTICE OF ORDER FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRESERVING HIS OR HER
 INTERESTS IN THE PROPERTY.
  2. If a party, or his OR HER representative or successor, who is bound
 by the judgment, withholds possession from the person thus  declared  to
 be  entitled  thereto,  the  court, by order, in its discretion, besides
 punishing the disobedience as a contempt, may require the sheriff to put
 that person into possession. Such an order shall be executed  as  if  it
 were an execution for the delivery of the possession of the property.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
