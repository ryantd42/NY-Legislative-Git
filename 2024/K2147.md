  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2024, as Cystic
Fibrosis Awareness Month in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with
the observance of National Cystic Fibrosis Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a donor-supported nonprofit
organization,  is the world's leader in the search for a cure for cystic
fibrosis, having raised and invested hundreds of millions of dollars  to
help develop drugs and therapies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Cystic  Fibrosis Foundation is working to cure cystic
fibrosis and to provide all  people  struggling  with  the  disease  the
opportunity to lead full, productive lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cystic fibrosis, commonly referred to as "CF", is a genetic
disease affecting approximately 40,000 children and adults in the United
States  and  more than 105,000 children and adults worldwide, over 1,600
of whom live in New York; furthermore, approximately 1,000 new cases are
diagnosed each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, A defective gene causes the body to produce  an  abnormally
thick,  sticky  mucus that clogs the lungs, and these secretions produce
life-threatening lung infections and obstruct the  pancreas,  preventing
digestive  enzymes  from  reaching the intestines to help break down and
absorb food; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 10 million Americans are symptomless carriers  of
the defective CF gene; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The median predicted age of survival for a person with CF,
born in 2019, is 48.4 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, With advances in the treatment of CF, the number of  adults
with  CF  has  steadily grown, and approximately 900 new cases of CF are
diagnosed each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, 56% of the CF population is 18 years of age and older,  and
people  with  CF  have a variety of symptoms attributed to the more than
2,000 mutations of the CF gene; and
 
  WHEREAS, Infant blood screening to detect  genetic  defects  is  the
most reliable and least costly method to identify persons likely to have
CF; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Early diagnosis of CF permits early treatment and enhances
quality of life and longevity and the treatment of  CF  depends  on  the
stage of the disease and the organs involved; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Clearing  mucus from the lungs is an important part of the
daily CF treatment  regimen,  and  other  types  of  treatments  include
inhaled antibiotics and pancreatic enzymes, among others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  21  world-class  treatment centers in New York
which specialize in the diagnosis of CF and the care of persons with CF;
and
 
  WHEREAS, A critical component of treating patients with CF  includes
access  to  innovative  treatments, which can play a crucial role in the
lives of patients with CF; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this  serious disease, and more must be done to increase activity at the
local, State and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2024, as Cystic
Fibrosis Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
