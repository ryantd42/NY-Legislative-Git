 THE DEFINITION OF  "FOOD  ADDITIVE"  UNDER  SUBDIVISION  SEVEN  OF  THIS
 SECTION  BECAUSE  IT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED, AMONG EXPERTS QUALIFIED BY
 SCIENTIFIC TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE TO EVALUATE  ITS  SAFETY,  AS  HAVING
 BEEN  ADEQUATELY  SHOWN  TO BE SAFE UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF ITS INTENDED
 USE:
  (A) THROUGH SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURES; OR
  (B) IN THE CASE OF A SUBSTANCE USED IN FOOD PRIOR  TO  JANUARY  FIRST,
 NINETEEN  HUNDRED  FIFTY-EIGHT,  THROUGH EITHER SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURES OR
 EXPERIENCE BASED ON PROLONGED USE IN FOOD.
  § 2. Subdivision 4 of section 199-a of  the  agriculture  and  markets
 law,  as  amended by chapter 671 of the laws of 1966, is amended to read

 COLOR  ADDITIVES report under this section shall be considered confiden-
 tial by the commissioner and shall not be revealed to any  person  other
 than  to  a  person authorized by the commissioner in the performance of
 his official duties under this article. In case of an actual controversy
 as to the validity of an order or decision of the commissioner  respect-
 ing  the  test  data  or report in which a proceeding to review has been
 instituted as authorized by section two hundred two-c  of  this  article
 the  petition,  data and report shall be transmitted by the commissioner

 culture and markets law, as amended by chapter 671 of the laws of  1966,

  The  commissioner may institute such action at law or in equity as may
 appear necessary to enforce compliance with sections one  hundred  nine-
 ty-nine-a, ONE HUNDRED NINETY-NINE-G, two hundred and two hundred one of
 this  article,  and  any rule or order respecting a GRAS SUBSTANCE, food
 additive, or color additive promulgated pursuant to sections one hundred
 ninety-nine-b and two hundred fourteen-b of this article and,  in  addi-
 tion  to any other remedy under this chapter or otherwise, may apply for
 relief by injunction  to  protect  the  public  interest  without  being
 A. 9295  6
 
 compelled  to  allege  or  prove that an adequate remedy at law does not
 exist. In an action instituted by the commissioner to enforce compliance
 with said sections  one  hundred  ninety-nine-a,  two  hundred  and  two
 hundred  one  the  commissioner  shall not be required to prove that the
 food, food additive or color additive  mentioned  in  the  complaint  is
 unsafe  and the claim or defense of the defendant as to its safety shall
 be immaterial, provided, however, that the recognition  by  the  federal
 food  and  drug  administration  of a food additive or color additive as
 safe may be alleged as a proper defense.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
