Senate Resolution No. 1902
 
BY: Senator STEWART-COUSINS
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  59th  Anniversary  of  Bloody
  Sunday and the Selma-to-Montgomery march across  the
  Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, which served
  as  a catalyst for passage of the 1965 Voting Rights
  Act
 
  WHEREAS, The Selma to Montgomery march was part of a series of civil
rights protests that occurred in 1965 in  Alabama,  a  state  which  was
deeply  entrenched  in  racist  policies, in an effort to register black
voters in the South; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 7, 1965, some 600 people assembled at  a  downtown
church,  knelt briefly in prayer, and began walking silently, two-by-two
through the city streets; protestors marching  the  54-mile  route  from
Selma  to  the  state  capitol of Montgomery were confronted with deadly
violence; and
 
  WHEREAS, With Hosea Williams of the  Southern  Christian  Leadership
Conference (SCLC) leading the demonstration, and John Lewis, Chairman of
the  Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), at his side, the
marchers were stopped as they were leaving Selma,  at  the  end  of  the
Edmund  Pettus  Bridge,  by  some 150 Alabama state troopers, sheriff 's
deputies, and white vigilante groups, who ordered the  demonstrators  to
disperse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One minute and five seconds after a two-minute warning was
announced, the troops advanced, wielding clubs, bullwhips, and tear gas;
John Lewis was one of 58  people  treated  for  injuries  at  the  local
hospital;  less  than one week later, John Lewis recounted the attack on
the marchers during a Federal hearing at which the demonstrators  sought
protection for a full-scale march to Montgomery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  day is remembered in history as "Bloody Sunday," when
footage of the violence collectively shocked the nation  and  galvanized
the fight against racial injustice; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  the world watched, the protesters under the protection
of federalized  National  Guard  troops  finally  achieved  their  goal,
walking  around  the  clock for three days to reach Montgomery, Alabama;
the historic march, and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s participation  in  it,
raised awareness of the difficulties faced by black voters, and the need
for a national Voting Rights Act; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Even  after  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  forbade
discrimination in voting on the basis of race, efforts by  civil  rights
organizations  such  as the Southern Christian Leadership Council (SCLC)
and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating  Committee  (SNCC)  to  register
black  voters were met with fierce resistance in southern states such as
Alabama; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 17, 1965, even as the Selma-to-Montgomery marchers
fought for the right  to  carry  out  their  protest,  President  Lyndon
Johnson  addressed  a  joint  session  of  Congress, calling for federal
 
voting rights legislation to protect  African  Americans  from  barriers
that prevented them from voting; and
 
  WHEREAS, That August, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
which guaranteed the right to vote, first awarded by the 15th Amendment,
to all African Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, Specifically, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned literacy
tests  as  a requirement for voting, mandated federal oversight of voter
registration in areas where tests had previously been used and gave  the
U.S.  attorney general the duty of challenging the use of poll taxes for
state and local elections; and
 
  WHEREAS, Along with the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act  was
one of the most expansive pieces of civil rights legislation in American
history; it greatly reduced the disparity between black and white voters
in the United States and allowed greater numbers of African Americans to
participate  in politics and government at the local, state and national
level; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 7, 2015, marchers walked over the Brooklyn  Bridge
in  solidarity  with  the  50th  Anniversary  of  Bloody  Sunday and the
Selma-to-Montgomery march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge; the Selma  is
Everywhere  march  honored  those  who  fought and continue to fight for
social injustice and to remind  all  United  States  citizens  to  never
forget  the pain which was endured in the movement to attain basic civil
rights; and
 
  WHEREAS, To commemorate the 59th Anniversary of  Bloody  Sunday  and
the  historic  march,  a myriad of events will be held from Selma to New
York, and across this great Nation to remember and recall  that  pivotal
day  which forever changed the lives of each and every American citizen;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  59th  Anniversary  of  Bloody  Sunday  and  the
Selma-to-Montgomery march across the  Edmund  Pettus  Bridge  in  Selma,
Alabama,  which  served  as  a  catalyst  for passage of the 1965 Voting
Rights Act; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Hazel N. Dukes, President, National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), New York State Conference.
