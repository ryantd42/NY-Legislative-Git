  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2024, as Great Outdoors Month in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set  aside  to  promote  the  participation  of
recreational activities in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  2024, as Great
Outdoors Month in the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Great Outdoors Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Great Outdoors Month first started as a Great Outdoors Week
under  President  Bill  Clinton  in 1998, to increase jobs and the gross
domestic product (GDP) of the country by getting  people  to  enjoy  and
appreciate  nature;  it  was  so  popular, it was expanded to the entire
month of June; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2016, the Outdoor Recreation Jobs  and  Economic  Impact
Act  was enacted in order to study America's outdoor recreation economy;
the report stated outdoor recreation  had  contributed  more  than  $412
billion,  which  is  2.2%  of the total GDP, to the economy, and outdoor
recreation had the fastest  growth  of  any  industry,  leading  to  4.5
million jobs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Great Outdoors Month is a perfect time for people to go out
and  explore  all  that  nature  has  to  offer, and is dedicated to the
country's diverse landscapes, which boast dense  forests,  long  winding
rivers, tranquil lakes, rocky mountains, and much more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Great  Outdoors Month invites us to discover a much-needed
new lease on life, both mentally and physically; and
 
  WHEREAS, Being outdoors, surrounded by  nature,  may  reduce  anger,
fear,  and stress and increase pleasant feelings; exposure to nature not
only makes a person feel better emotionally,  it  contributes  to  their
physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension,
and the production of stress hormones; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Great  Outdoors Month is a celebration of nature, taking a
break from work and our hectic lives, and the outdoors which leads us on
the paths of adventure, adrenaline rush, and so much more; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body, representing the people of the State
of New York, supports this vital month and encourages  the  citizens  of
this  great  Empire  State  to  participate  in  Great  Outdoors  Month
activities scheduled throughout the state and to bring attention to such
activities that bolster our state's  economic  and  overall  well-being;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  2024,  as  Great
Outdoors Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
