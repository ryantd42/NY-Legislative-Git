 Introduced by M. of A. KELLES -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN  ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to establishing
  the green affordable pre-electrification program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "green affordable pre-electrification fund" (GAP fund).
  § 2. Legislative intent. The  legislature  finds  that  a  significant
 portion  of  the state's residential buildings are old and in disrepair.
 This limits the eligibility of low- and moderate-income  households  for
 residential  energy efficiency, electrification, weatherization, instal-
 lation of insulation, and resiliency programs (empower+). These programs
 often do not cover the costs associated with renovations that would make
 such homes eligible for such programs. Given  the  limitation  of  these
 programs  to help make these homes eligible, there is a critical need to
 fund such improvements if the state is to comprehensively  reduce  emis-
 sions from residential buildings and achieve our climate goals.
  §  3.  The  public  authorities law is amended by adding a new section
 1872-b to read as follows:
  § 1872-B. GREEN AFFORDABLE  PRE-ELECTRIFICATION  PROGRAM.  1.  DEFI-
 NITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION:
  (A)  "HOME" SHALL MEAN A RESIDENTIAL DWELLING WHICH IS OWNER OR TENANT
 OCCUPIED.
  (B) "ELIGIBLE APPLICANT" SHALL MEAN AN OWNER OR TENANT OF  A  RESIDEN-
 TIAL  BUILDING  WHO WOULD BE INELIGIBLE FOR, OR WHO HAS BEEN DENIED, ANY
 LOCAL, STATE OR FEDERAL INCENTIVES, GRANTS OR LOANS FOR IMPROVEMENTS  OR
 PROJECTS  RELATING  TO  CLIMATE  CHANGE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY DUE TO
 STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES OR CODE VIOLATIONS WHICH MAKE  THE  BUILDING  OR
 PROPERTY INELIGIBLE OR UNSUITABLE FOR SUCH IMPROVEMENTS OR PROJECTS. THE
 AUTHORITY  MAY  ALSO  INCLUDE  AS AN ELIGIBLE APPLICANT; A CITY, TOWN OR
 VILLAGE; A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FUND  COMPANY  INCORPORATED  PURSUANT  TO
 ARTICLE  ELEVEN  OF  THE PRIVATE HOUSING FINANCE LAW WHICH HAS AS ONE OF
 ITS PRIMARY PURPOSES THE IMPROVEMENT OF  HOUSING;  A  MUNICIPAL  HOUSING

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
