 section, a prospective plaintiff shall send by certified mail a  written
 notice  to  the clerk of the political subdivision, or, if the political

 subdivision, against which the action would be brought,  asserting  that
 the  political subdivision may be in violation of this title. This writ-
 ten notice shall be referred to as a "NYVRA notification letter" in this
 title.  THE NYVRA  NOTIFICATION  LETTER  SHALL  SPECIFY  THE  POTENTIAL
 VIOLATION  OR  VIOLATIONS ALLEGED AND SHALL CONTAIN A STATEMENT OF FACTS
 TO SUPPORT SUCH ALLEGATION; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT FAILURE TO SO SPECI-
 FY SHALL NOT BE A BASIS FOR DISMISSAL OF SUCH JUDICIAL ACTION,  BUT  MAY
 AFFECT  THE  CALCULATION  OF  REIMBURSEMENT PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (E) OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION.  THE PROSPECTIVE PLAINTIFF SHALL ALSO  SEND  BY  FIRST
 CLASS MAIL OR EMAIL A COPY OF THE NYVRA NOTIFICATION LETTER TO THE CIVIL
 RIGHTS  BUREAU. For actions against a school district or any other poli-
 tical subdivision that holds elections governed by  the  education  law,
 the  prospective  plaintiff  shall also send by certified mail a copy of
 the NYVRA notification letter to the commissioner of education.

 violation of this title; (ii) specific steps the  political  subdivision
 will undertake to facilitate approval and implementation of such a reme-
 dy;  and  (iii)  a schedule for enacting and implementing such a remedy.
 Such a resolution shall be referred to as a "NYVRA resolution"  in  this
 title.  If a political subdivision passes a NYVRA resolution, such poli-
 tical subdivision shall have ninety days after such passage to enact and
 implement such remedy, during which a prospective  plaintiff  shall  not
 commence  an action to enforce this section against the political subdi-
 vision. For actions against  a  school  district,  the  commissioner  of
 education  may order the enactment of a NYVRA resolution pursuant to the
 commissioner's authority under section three hundred five of the  educa-
 tion  law.  WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF PASSING A NYVRA RESOLUTION, THE POLI-
 TICAL SUBDIVISION SHALL SEND BY FIRST CLASS MAIL OR EMAIL A COPY OF  THE

 proposal if it concludes that: (A) the political subdivision may  be  in
 violation  of this title; (B) the NYVRA proposal would remedy any poten-
 tial violation of this title CITED IN THE NYVRA NOTIFICATION LETTER  AND
