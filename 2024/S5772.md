 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to  education  on  celiac
  disease;  and  to  amend  the  tax  law  and the state finance law, in
  relation to the celiac disease awareness and research fund

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds the
 following:
  a. Celiac disease is a digestive disease that damages the small intes-
 tine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food.
  b. Celiac disease affects people in all parts of the world. Originally
 thought to be a rare childhood syndrome, celiac disease is now known  to
 be a common genetic disorder.
  c. More than two million people in the United States have the disease,
 or about 1 in 133 people.
  d. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in
 wheat,  rye, and barley. Gluten is found mainly in foods but may also be
 found in everyday products such as medicines, vitamins and lip balms.
  e. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products  contain-
 ing  gluten,  their  immune  system  responds  by damaging or destroying
 villi, the tiny, fingerlike  protrusions  lining  the  small  intestine.
 Villi  normally  allow  nutrients  from  food to be absorbed through the
 walls of the small  intestine  into  the  bloodstream.  Without  healthy
 villi, a person becomes malnourished, no matter how much one eats.
  f.  People  with  celiac  disease  may  have no symptoms but can still
 develop complications of the disease over time. Long-term  complications
 include  malnutrition which can lead to anemia, osteoporosis and miscar-
 riage, among other problems such as liver diseases and  cancers  of  the
 intestine.

  g.  For  these reasons, and because this legislation will have signif-
 icant savings to New York, the legislature finds it in the public inter-
 est to raise awareness of this disease.
