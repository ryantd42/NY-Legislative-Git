  LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION  memorializing Governor Kathy
  Hochul to proclaim October 17, 2024, as Black Poetry
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to  those  who
seek  to  preserve  and  celebrate  the African-American heritage of our
State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 17, 2024, as Black
Poetry Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance
of National Black Poetry Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  October  17,  1711,  was the birth date of the Black poet,
Jupiter Hammon, a slave of the Lloyd Family of the Plantation of  Queens
Village,  New  York,  an  area of Long Island now known as Caumset State
Park; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  December  25,  1760,  Jupiter  became  the  first
African-American to publish his own poem, "An Evening Thought: Salvation
by Christ, with Penitential Cries"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  the  fall  of  1970, through the efforts of Stanley
Ransom, former Director, Huntington Public Library, an unofficial  Black
Poetry Day has been celebrated in parts of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  date  has  been gaining popularity as an occasion to
recognize the many Black poets in our state; and
 
  WHEREAS, The noted author, Julius Lester, has suggested  "Poetry  is
the  major expression of Black experience," and the poet, Nikki Giovanni
has said, "Poetry is part of the strong oral tradition of Black people";
and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the course of American history, Black poets  and
writers  have  used  their  great  talents  to share the richness of the
African-American experience and to develop a uniquely American style  of
literature  enjoyed  throughout the world; on October 17, 2024, we honor
Jupiter Hammon, a true pioneer of African-American  poetry,  along  with
today's artists who continue his legacy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Events  which  provide a means of preserving a part of our
rich American past and which contribute to the community in  such  noble
endeavors, are held in the highest regard by this Legislative Body; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 17, 2024, as Black
Poetry Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
