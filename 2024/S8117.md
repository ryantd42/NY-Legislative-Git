 S. 8117  7
 
  a. Dismissing the petition for failure to affirmatively establish  the
 allegations  thereof  or because of the affirmative establishment by the
 owner or a mortgagee or lienor of record of a defense or defenses speci-
 fied in section seven hundred seventy-five of this article; or
  b.  Directing  that (1) the rents due on the date of the entry of such

 service  of  the  judgment  on all other residential and non-residential
 tenants occupying such dwelling from such other tenants, shall be depos-
 ited with the administrator appointed by the court, pursuant to  section

 ed  with  such  administrator as they fall due; (3) such deposited rents

 to remedy the condition or conditions OR COURSE OF  CONDUCT  alleged  in

 such  judgment, any remaining surplus shall be turned over to the owner,
 together with a complete accounting of the rents deposited and the costs
 incurred; and granting such other and further relief as to the court may
 seem just and proper. A certified copy of such judgment shall be  served
 personally,  BY  THE  ADMINISTRATOR  APPOINTED  BY THE COURT PURSUANT TO
 SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT OF THIS ARTICLE, upon each non-peti-
 tioning tenant occupying such dwelling and [upon the city of  New  York]

 receipt requested, to such tenant. Any right of the owner of such dwell-
 ing  to  collect  such  rent  moneys from any petitioning tenant of such
 dwelling on or after the date of entry of such judgment,  and  from  any
 non-petitioning  tenant of such dwelling on or after the date of service
 of such judgment on such  non-petitioning  tenant  as  herein  provided,
 shall  be  void and unenforceable to the extent that such petitioning or
 non-petitioning tenant, as the case may be, has  deposited  such  moneys
 with  the  administrator  in accordance with the terms of such judgment,
 regardless of whether such right of  the  owner  arises  from  a  lease,
 contract,  agreement  or  understanding  heretofore or hereafter made or
 entered into or arises as a matter of law from the relationship  of  the
 parties  or  otherwise.  It  shall  be  a valid defense in any action or
 proceeding against any such tenant to recover possession of real proper-
 ty for the non-payment of rent or for use or occupation  to  prove  that
 the  rent  alleged  to be unpaid was deposited with the administrator in
 accordance with the terms of a judgment entered under this section.
  C. DIRECTING THE OWNER TO PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE COURT,  COURT-
 APPOINTED  ADMINISTRATOR,  HOUSING STANDARDS DEPARTMENT, AND PETITIONING
 TENANTS WITHIN TEN DAYS OF ENTERING INTO  A  CONTRACT  OF  SALE  WITH  A
 PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER OF THE PREMISES.
  D.  NEITHER THE OWNER NOR A COURT-APPOINTED ADMINISTRATOR SHALL, WITH-
 OUT GOOD CAUSE, SERVE A NOTICE TO QUIT UPON ANY TENANT OR  COMMENCE  ANY
 ACTION  TO  RECOVER  REAL  PROPERTY  OR  SUMMARY  PROCEEDING  TO RECOVER
 POSSESSION OF REAL PROPERTY, OR  SUBSTANTIALLY  ALTER  THE  TERMS  OF  A
 TENANT'S  LEASE,  INCLUDING,  BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REFUSING TO CONTINUE A
 TENANCY OF THE TENANT UPON EXPIRATION OF THE TENANT'S  LEASE,  TO  RENEW
 THE  LEASE  OR  OFFER  A  NEW LEASE, OR OFFERING A NEW LEASE WITH A RENT
 S. 8117  8
 
 INCREASE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN FIVE PERCENT ABOVE THE CURRENT  LEASE,
 WITHIN ONE YEAR OF A JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION; PROVIDED, HOWEV-
 ER,  THAT  AN  OWNER SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED UNDER THIS SECTION TO OFFER A
 NEW LEASE OR A LEASE RENEWAL FOR A TERM GREATER THAN ONE YEAR.

 ment  of  the  housing maintenance code of the city of New York] for the

  (e)  ABATEMENTS  FOR  ALL TENANTS OF UP TO TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF RENT

 HOWEVER,  ANY  RESULTING  RELIEF  FROM SUCH CLAIM WILL BE REDUCED BY THE

 the  premises in a case where an owner would have been liable; he or she

 erty in such case.

 duties  in  a  reasonable  manner.  THE BURDEN OF SHOWING PERFORMANCE OF
 DUTIES IN A REASONABLE MANNER SHALL BE MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATOR IN SUCH
 SUMMARY PROCEEDING.
