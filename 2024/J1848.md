  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 26, 2024,  as  Students  with  Disabilities
  Advocacy Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness  of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 26, 2024, as
Students with Disabilities Advocacy Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Students with Disabilities Day is a campaign  which  raises
awareness  about  the  need  for  removing  barriers  to  key reasonable
accommodations and support services that promote access and success  for
students  with disabilities, who attend public and private institutes of
higher education in New York State at increasingly higher rates; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our great Empire State  has  a  history  of  excellence  in
education  and  values  providing  educational opportunities to students
with diverse backgrounds; students with disabilities contribute  greatly
to New York State's colleges and universities; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the New York State Education Department, as of
late  last  fall  there  were  nearly  94,735  identified  students with
disabilities attending  New  York  State  degree-granting  colleges  and
universities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is imperative that these institutes of higher learning
are provided with the  necessary  resources  to  empower  students  with
disabilities and help them achieve academically and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  Yorkers  with disabilities, like all New Yorkers, are
entitled to not only full participation in our society,  but  also  full
opportunity in our society; their talents and contributions are vital to
the strength of our State's workforce and our future prosperity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Together,  we  can ensure persons living with disabilities
are provided key reasonable accommodations  and  support  services  that
promote access and success while attending public and private institutes
of higher education in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  in the interest of New York State to recognize the
achievements which have been  made  thus  far,  and  to  continue  these
efforts  by  promoting  the awareness and fostering the understanding of
persons with disabilities; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 26, 2024, as
Students with Disabilities Advocacy Day in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
