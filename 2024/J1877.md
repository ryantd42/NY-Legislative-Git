  COMMENDING  NAMI  Westchester upon the occasion of
  celebrating its 40th Anniversary
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend NAMI Westchester upon  the  occasion  of  celebrating  its  40th
Anniversary  at  its  Find  Help, Find Hope Gala at the Surf Club on the
Sound in New Rochelle, New York, on Thursday, March 21, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Alliance on  Mental  Illness  was  founded  by
Harriet  Shetler and Beverly Young in Madison, Wisconsin; both women had
sons who were diagnosed with schizophrenia and  were  dissatisfied  with
the lack of available services and the treatment of those suffering with
mental illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, After encountering other individuals with similar concerns,
the  first  meeting was held to address mental health issues, leading to
the formation of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in 1979; the
name was changed to the acronym, NAMI, in 1997; and
 
  WHEREAS, NAMI Westchester was established by a five-person committee
under the name Westchester Advocates for the Mentally Ill  in  1980;  in
1983,  the  organization  was incorporated and granted tax exemption; in
1998, the name was changed and incorporated as National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill of Westchester, Inc.; and
 
  WHEREAS, The mission of NAMI Westchester is to  assure  that  people
who  are  mentally  ill  are afforded the same basic human rights as all
other citizens, to improve and  ensure  the  quality  of  life  for  the
mentally  ill,  and to promote positive relationships with the community
at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, Certain issues, such as  stigma,  housing,  education,  and
patients'  rights,  became  priorities of the advocates for the mentally
ill; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, NAMI Westchester has been the  leading
organization  in  Westchester  County  to  support  the  families of the
victims of mental illness, offering resources, help, and hope  to  those
individuals who require guidance and assistance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend NAMI Westchester upon  the  occasion  of  celebrating  its  40th
 
Anniversary,  and  to  honor  its  members,  past  and present, who have
labored so conscientiously to secure and improve the quality of life for
the members of the community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to NAMI Westchester.
