 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  executive  law, in relation to minimum staffing
  levels for agencies enforcing the minimum standards under the New York
  State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code Act

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative intent.  The legislature enacted the New York
 State Uniform Fire Prevention and  Building  Code  Act  ("the  Act")  to
 prevent  loss  of  life,  injury to persons, and damage to property as a
 result of fire and to provide a basic level of protection to  which  the
 people  are entitled in connection with the construction and maintenance
 of buildings.  These people include, importantly, the first  responders:
 firefighters,  police,  and  EMTs,  who are required to enter structures
 with which they are unfamiliar and sometimes navigate them in  hazardous
 conditions such as smoke and fire.
  The  legislature  has further determined it to be a public policy that
 there must be a minimum level of protection from the  hazards  of  fire,
 and a uniform set of minimum standards across the state.
  Also,  the  legislature  has  determined that local governments should
 exercise their full powers to administer and enforce the uniform code.
  It has, however, come to the attention of  the  legislature,  that  in
 some  jurisdictions,  the  agencies  responsible  for enforcement of the
 minimum standards are understaffed and cannot keep up with the mandatory
 inspections and inspections related to complaints, and the  issuance  of
 building  permits  and the follow up inspections and enforcement actions
 needed to implement the Act.  Failure to have adequate staffing has  led
 to  ineffective  enforcement of the Act and increases in the dangers the
 Act is intended to prevent.
  § 2. Paragraph b of subdivision 1 of section 381 of the executive law,
 as amended by chapter 560 of the laws of 2010, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation
