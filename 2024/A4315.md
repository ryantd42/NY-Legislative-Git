  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing an amendment to section 4 of article 4 of the constitution, in
  relation to prohibiting the governor from granting himself or  herself
  or  any  person  involved  with  furthering the illegal conduct of the
  governor a reprieve, commutation or pardon
 
  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 4 of  article
 4 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  4.  The  governor  shall  have the power to grant reprieves, commu-
 tations and pardons after conviction, for all  offenses  except  treason
 and  cases  of  impeachment,  upon  such  conditions  and  with  such
 restrictions and limitations, as he or she may think proper, subject  to
 such  regulations  as  may  be provided by law relative to the manner of
 applying for pardons. THE GOVERNOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO  GRANT  A
 REPRIEVE, COMMUTATION OR PARDON TO HIMSELF OR HERSELF, OR TO ANY PERSONS
 INVOLVED  WITH FURTHERING ANY ILLEGAL OR UNLAWFUL CONDUCT OF SUCH GOVER-
 NOR. Upon conviction for treason,  the  governor  shall  have  power  to
 suspend  the execution of the sentence, until the case shall be reported
 to the legislature at its  next  meeting,  when  the  legislature  shall
 either  pardon,  or  commute  the  sentence, direct the execution of the
 sentence, or grant a  further  reprieve.  The  governor  shall  annually
 communicate  to  the  legislature  each case of reprieve, commutation or
 pardon granted, stating the name of the convict, the crime of which  the
 convict  was  convicted,  the sentence and its date, and the date of the
 commutation, pardon or reprieve.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendment  be
 referred  to  the  first regular legislative session convening after the
 next  succeeding  general election of members of  the  assembly, and, in
 conformity  with  section 1 of  article 19 of  the  constitution,  be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
