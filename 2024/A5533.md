  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  modify  the in-service death benefit for retirement
 eligible members of the New York State and Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System  who  are  employed  by Nassau County in certain fire marshal job
 titles. The in-service death benefit will be the value  of  the  pension
 reserve as if the member had retired on their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $5,400 in the
 annual contributions of Nassau County for the fiscal year  ending  March
 31,  2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $48,700  which  will  be
 borne by Nassau County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment  will  be  made  on February 1, 2024. If Nassau County elects to
 amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for  the  first  year
 including interest would be $6,220.
 A. 5533  7
 
  These  estimated  costs  are  based on 44 affected members employed by
 Nassau County, with annual salary of approximately $5.0  million  as  of
 March 31, 2022.

  Membership  data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the impact

 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the
