 subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 622 of the laws of 2008 and subdivi-
 sion 2 as amended by chapter 376 of the laws of  2019,  are  amended  to
 read as follows:
  1.  Recipient  qualifications.  Tuition  assistance program awards are
 available for all students who are enrolled in approved programs and who
 demonstrate the ability to complete such  courses,  in  accordance  with
 standards  established  by  the  commissioner provided, however, that no
 award shall be made unless tuition (exclusive of educational fees)  and,
 if  applicable,  the  college  fee levied by the state university of New
 York pursuant to the April first, nineteen hundred sixty-four  financing
 agreements  with  the New York state dormitory authority charged for the
 program in which the student is enrolled  total  at  least  two  hundred
 dollars  a  year,  and  provided  further  that, no award can exceed one
 hundred percent of the  amount  of  tuition  charged.  NOTHING  IN  THIS
 SECTION,  SECTION  SIX  HUNDRED  SIXTY-ONE  OF  THIS  PART, OR ANY OTHER
 PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER SHALL BE READ TO EXCLUDE ANY GRADUATE  PROGRAM
 FROM  CLASSIFICATION  BY THE COMMISSIONER AS AN APPROVED PROGRAM FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.
  2. Duration. No undergraduate shall be eligible  for  more  than  four
 academic  years of study, or five academic years if the program of study
 normally requires five years. Students enrolled in a program of remedial
 study, approved by the commissioner in an institution of  higher  educa-
 tion and intended to culminate in a degree in undergraduate study shall,
 for  purposes of this section, be considered as enrolled in a program of
 study normally requiring five years. An undergraduate  student  enrolled

 STUDY. An undergraduate student enrolled in an approved two or four-year
 program of study approved by  the  commissioner  who  must  transfer  to
 another  institution  as  a result of permanent college closure shall be
 eligible for up to two additional semesters, or their equivalent, to the
 extent credits necessary to complete his or her program  of  study  were
 deemed  non-transferable  from the closed institution or were deemed not
 applicable to such student's program of study by  the  new  institution.

 sixty-seven-a  of  this  subpart shall not be counted toward the maximum
 term of eligibility under this section.
