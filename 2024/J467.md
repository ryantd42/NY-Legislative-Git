  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 1-7, 2023, as Tardive Dyskinesia Awareness  Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 1-7, 2023  as  Tardive
Dyskinesia Awareness Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many people with serious mental health conditions, such as
bipolar disorder, major depression, schizophrenia,  and  schizoaffective
disorder,  or  gastrointestinal  disorders,  including  gastroparesis,
nausea, and vomiting, may be  treated  with  medications  that  work  as
dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs), including antipsychotics; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  ongoing  treatment  with  these  medications can be
necessary, prolonged use can also lead to tardive  dyskinesia  (TD),  an
involuntary  movement  disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable,
abnormal and repetitive movements of the face, torso, and/or other  body
parts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  estimated  that  TD  affects approximately 600,000
people in the U.S., and approximately 70% of people  with  TD  have  not
been  diagnosed,  making  it  important  to  raise  awareness  about the
symptoms and impact of TD because even mild  symptoms  of  TD  can  have
physical, social and emotional consequences; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  important  that  people  taking DRBA medication be
monitored for  TD;  regular  screening  for  TD  in  these  patients  is
recommended by the American Psychiatric Association (APA); and
 
  WHEREAS,  Clinical  research  has  led  to  the  availability of two
treatments for adults with  TD  by  the  United  States  Food  and  Drug
Administration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Anyone  experiencing  symptoms  of TD should consult their
physician for support; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 1-7, 2023 as Tardive
Dyskinesia Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
