BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  COMMEMORATING  the 100th Anniversary of the Oneida
  Public Library on April 30, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the communities  across  the  great
State of New York is reflective of certain exemplary organizations whose
purpose  is  dedicated  to  serving  the  community and the needs of its
citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Oneida Public Library on  April
30, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  centennial  celebration  of the renowned Library will
honor the pillars of the Oneida  Public  Library,  featuring  historical
exhibits  in  their  art gallery, a poster contest for high schoolers, a
downtown walking tour, summer concert series, cemetery  tour  and  more;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Providing  enrichment,  enlightenment,  education,  and
entertainment to the members of the community for over  100  years,  the
Oneida Public Library was recognized by the Central NY Library Resources
Council (CLRC) with the Library of the Year Award; and
 
  WHEREAS, With humble beginnings, the history of the formation of the
Oneida  Public  Library  dates back to 1879, when Mrs. S. S. Goodwin and
the  leading  ladies  of  Oneida  Village  Society  created  the  Ladies
Circulating Library Association, Oneida's first formal library; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On April 30, 1924, the Oneida Public Library opened in the
back room of the Oneida Chamber of Commerce; Miss Nellie  Mirick  opened
the  doors  to  the newly formed institution and the Oneida Free Library
came to life as the first patron, Eugenia Potter, checked out a book  on
that date; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Library Association purchased the Woodhull House at 254
Main  Street,  where Oneida's first public reading room was established;
after the Library outgrew the Woodhull House, a new beautiful  building,
funded by community members, was built on a donated lot on Broad Street;
the new Hand-Barker Memorial Library, was dedicated on January 29, 1955;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  the 1990s, the Library had begun to once again outgrow
their facility and also started to face a period of financial  struggle;
in  1996,  with  the  support  of the New York State Legislature and the
Oneida City School District, the  Oneida  Public  Library  was  able  to
re-establish  itself  and expand its hours of operations, as well as its
holdings; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the  Oneida  Public  Library  serves  the  15,000
residents  who  live  in  the  special  library  district; it supports a
collection of about 55,000 books, periodicals, and  audio-visual  items,
 
offers frequent and diverse children's and adult's programming, provides
space  for  numerous community groups and one-on-one tutoring, and gives
residents the benefits of a membership with the Mid-York Library System;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Oneida Public Library has been an invaluable resource
for residents of Oneida, New York, for 100 years;  people  come  to  the
Library  to  connect,  discover,  and  learn  through  story times, book
groups, and various programs for all ages; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the  Oneida  Public  Library  is  in  direct
correlation  to the efforts of its dedicated Executive Director, Michele
Ryan, and its members,  whose  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,
characterized  by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and
an uncompromising standard of excellence in all endeavors on  behalf  of
the Library and the population it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Steeped  in  a proud and distinguished history, the Oneida
Public Library may take just pride in its purposeful growth, as it looks
forward  to  continuing  to  serve  the  educational,  cultural,  and
intellectual needs of the community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Oneida Public Library on  April
30, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Oneida Public Library.
