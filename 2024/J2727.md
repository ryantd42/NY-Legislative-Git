ground/airborne operation known as Market Garden by five days; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kenneth  C.  Thayer,  in  a  brave  act  of  selflessness,
volunteered  to  conduct  a one-man reconnaissance patrol into the Dutch

village is considered by many to be the first village in The Netherlands
to be liberated in World War II; and

Theater  of  Operations mainly with the United States Army 30th Infantry
Division, from July  1944  to  May  1945,  Kenneth  C.  Thayer  was  the

  WHEREAS,  This  esteemed  veteran  was  the  author  of  "The  Young
Liberators:  Volume One: From Citizen to Soldier" and "Volume Two:  From
Mortain  to  Victory  in  Europe";  he  is  also  the past National Vice
President of the Air Force Association whose mission is to  educate  the
public  about aerospace power and its importance in defending the United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS, For several decades, Kenneth C. Thayer served as  Treasurer
for the Central Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired (CABVI);
in 2023, CABVI named a new building in Utica, New York in his honor; and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with  which these men and women served their country, and must recognize
that no greater debt is owed than that owed  to  those  who  gave  their
lives  for  their beloved Nation and to those who continue to be missing
in action; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having  exhibited  his patriotism both at home and abroad,
Kenneth C. Thayer demonstrated his  love  for  his  country  and  merits
forevermore, the highest respect of his State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our  Nation's veterans deserve to be recognized, commended
and thanked by the people of the State of New York for their service and
for their dedication to their communities, their State and their Nation;

designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal; and be it further
