  COMMENDING  HOPE  Community  Services  upon  the
  occasion of  celebrating  its  40th  Anniversary  on
  April 18, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  HOPE  Community  Services  upon the occasion of celebrating its
40th Anniversary at its A Night of Hope Gala at the VIP Country Club  in
New Rochelle, New York, on Thursday, April 18, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  HOPE  (Help  Our  People  Eat)  Community  Services  is  a
not-for-profit, non-sectarian organization serving the residents of  New
Rochelle  and its surrounding communities; it provides its assistance in
an unbiased and non-discriminatory manner; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1984,  Mary  Lou  McNaney,  founder  of  HOPE  Community
Services,  in  response  to the issues of hunger and homelessness in New
Rochelle, established its Soup Kitchen with the assistance  of  a  small
number  of volunteers; the Food Pantry, which provided bagged groceries,
was created later that year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout its past four decades, HOPE  Community  Services
has  become the largest emergency food program in Westchester County; it
continues to perpetuate its  founder's  mission--striving  to  meet  the
needs of its community with warmth and respect; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a multi-faceted community organization, HOPE Community
Services manages one of the largest volunteer operations and offers  its
programs and services at no charge; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  its  outreach  to those people in need, HOPE Community
Services  provides  support,  including  mobile,  kosher,  and  senior
pantries,  community  holiday  dinners,  housing, resources for homeless
individuals,  translation  and  immigration  services,  English  and
citizenship classes, and summer camp; and
 
  WHEREAS,  HOPE  Community  Services offers an inviting atmosphere of
personal  and  respectful  service  to  the  community's  disadvantaged
individuals  by  meeting  the  needs of their bodies, minds, hearts, and
spirits; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Additionally,  HOPE  Community  Services  encourages  its
clients  to  achieve personal responsibility, self-sufficiency, a fuller
appreciation  of  dignity  and  self-worth,  and  recognition  of  the
interdependence between others and themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As HOPE Community Services continues to strengthen the New
Rochelle constituency, investing in  self-reliance  and  bolstering  its
 
programming, the aspiration of incorporating a community center may soon
become a reality; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  HOPE  Community  Services  is  in direct
correlation to the efforts of its members,  whose  involvement  is,  and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  HOPE  Community  Services, upon the occasion of celebrating its
40th Anniversary, and to honor its members, past and present,  who  have
labored so conscientiously to secure and improve the quality of life for
the citizens of the community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to HOPE Community Services.
