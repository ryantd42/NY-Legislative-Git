  COMMEMORATING  the  100th Anniversary of the Royal
  Canadian Air Force
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  military  organizations  that  contribute
substantially to the defense and safety of not only the Empire State but
also the Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Royal Canadian Air Force to  be
celebrated  at  its Annual Mess Dinner at Hart's Hill Inn in Whitesboro,
New York, on Friday, April 12, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, On April 1, 1924, the Royal Canadian Air Force  (RCAF)  was
formed  by  the Canadian Air Force after it was granted a royal sanction
by King George V; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  its  inception,  the  RCAF  was  not  an  independent
organization,  reporting  to the Chief of the General Staff, the head of
the Canadian Militia (now called  Canadian  Army);  however,  it  was  a
full-time  organization  with  its  own orders which included the King's
Regulations and Orders for the Royal Canadian Air Force; and
 
  WHEREAS, The RCAF's purpose is not only the defense  of  Canada  but
also,  more  importantly,  flying  operations  performed  for  other
governments'  departments;  it  protects  Canadian  and  North  American
airspace in partnership with the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States  and  Canada  share  a  long-standing
commitment to working together for our common defense and security,  and
the  continuation  of  this  successful  relationship  through the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is paramount  to  the  future
security  of  the  people of the United States and Canada; this includes
the Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS), a component of the New  York  Air
National Guard, in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  centennial celebration is an opportunity to showcase
Air Force personnel and their accomplishments, demonstrate air and space
power, enhance the  reputation  of  the  RCAF,  and  proudly  honor  its
distinguished  history  and heritage; the RCAF has proven its importance
through its contributions to national safety and security, international
peace, and global stability; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional  military  element, its assurance of the
defense of New York State and the Nation, and  its  invaluable  role  in
improving the freedom of the citizenry; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Royal Canadian Air  Force;  and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Royal Canadian Air Force.
