 AN ACT to amend the tax law, in relation to making the first one hundred
  thousand dollars of an individuals' private pension non-taxable
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph 3-a of subsection (c) of section 612 of  the  tax
 law,  as  amended  by  section  3 of part I of chapter 59 of the laws of
 2015, is amended to read as follows:
  (3-a) Pensions and  annuities  received  by  an  individual  [who  has
 attained  the  age  of  fifty-nine and one-half], not otherwise excluded
 pursuant to paragraph three of this subsection, to the extent includible
 in gross income for federal income tax purposes, but not  in  excess  of
 [twenty]  ONE  HUNDRED  thousand  dollars,  which  are periodic payments
 attributable to personal services performed by such individual prior  to
 his retirement from employment, which arise (i) from an employer-employ-
 ee  relationship  or  (ii) from contributions to a retirement plan which
 are deductible for federal  income  tax  purposes.  [However,  the  term
 "pensions and annuities" shall also include distributions received by an
 individual  who  has attained the age of fifty-nine and one-half from an
 individual retirement account or an individual  retirement  annuity,  as
 defined  in section four hundred eight of the internal revenue code, and
 distributions received by an individual who  has  attained  the  age  of
 fifty-nine and one-half from self-employed individual and owner-employee
 retirement  plans  which  qualify  under section four hundred one of the
 internal revenue code, whether or  not  the  payments  are  periodic  in
 nature.  Nevertheless,  the] THE term "pensions and annuities" shall not
 include any lump sum distribution, as defined in subparagraph [(D)]  (A)
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 5235  2
 
 of  paragraph  four of subsection (e) of section four hundred two of the
 internal revenue code and taxed under section six hundred three of  this
 article. Where a husband and wife file a joint state personal income tax
 return,  the  modification  provided  for  in  this  paragraph  shall be
 computed as if they were  filing  separate  state  personal  income  tax
 returns.  Where a payment would otherwise come within the meaning of the
 term "pensions and annuities" as set forth  in  this  paragraph,  except
 that  such  individual is deceased, such payment shall, nevertheless, be
 treated as a pension or annuity for purposes of this paragraph  if  such
 payment is received by such individual's beneficiary.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to
 have been in full force and effect on and after the first of January  of
 the year in which it shall have become a law.
