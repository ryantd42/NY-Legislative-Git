 chapter, an information, a simplified information, a prosecutor's infor-
 mation, a superior court information, a misdemeanor complaint or a felo-
 ny  complaint.  Every  accusatory  instrument,  regardless of the person

 the  state as plaintiff and must be entitled "the people of the state of
 New York" against a designated person, known as the defendant[; and

 that false statements made therein are punishable as a class A misdemea-
 nor, (iii) the infraction or infractions contained therein are stated in
 detail  and  not in conclusory terms so as to provide the defendant with

 type  of  the ticketed vehicle, (3) the expiration of the ticketed vehi-
 cle's  registration,  (4) the make or model of the ticketed vehicle, and
 (5) the body type of the ticketed vehicle, provided, however, that where
 the plate type or the expiration date are not shown on either the regis-
 tration plates or sticker of a vehicle or where the registration sticker

 plate  type  or  the  expiration date may be omitted, provided, further,
 however, that such condition must be so described and  inserted  on  the
 instrument].
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 150.20 of the criminal procedure law, as
 amended  by  section  1-a of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019,
 subparagraph (viii) of paragraph (b) as amended and subparagraphs  (ix),
 (x) and (xi) of paragraph (b) as added by section 1 of subpart B of part
 UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  [(a)]  Whenever a police officer is authorized pursuant to section
 140.10 of this title to arrest a person without a warrant for an offense
 other than a class A, B, C or D felony or a violation of section 130.25,
 130.40, 205.10, 205.17, 205.19 or 215.56 of the penal  law,  he  [shall,
 except  as  set  out  in  paragraph (b) of this subdivision] OR SHE MAY,
 subject to the provisions of subdivisions  three  and  four  of  section
 150.40  of  this  [title]  ARTICLE, instead issue to and serve upon such
 person an appearance ticket.
  [(b) An officer is not required to issue an appearance ticket if:
  (i) the person has one or more outstanding  local  criminal  court  or
 superior court warrants;
  (ii)  the person has failed to appear in court proceedings in the last
 two years;
  (iii) the person has been given a reasonable opportunity to make their
 verifiable identity and a method of contact known, and has  been  unable
 or  unwilling  to  do  so,  so  that  a custodial arrest is necessary to
 subject the individual  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court.  For  the
 purposes  of  this  section,  an  officer may rely on various factors to
 determine a person's identity, including but  not  limited  to  personal
 knowledge  of  such person, such person's self-identification, or photo-
 graphic identification. There is no requirement that  a  person  present
 photographic  identification  in order to be issued an appearance ticket
 in lieu of arrest where the person's identity is  otherwise  verifiable;
 however,  if offered by such person, an officer shall accept as evidence
 of identity the following: a valid driver's license or non-driver  iden-
 tification card issued by the commissioner of motor vehicles, the feder-
 al  government, any United States territory, commonwealth or possession,
 the District of Columbia, a state  government  or  municipal  government
 within  the  United States or a provincial government of the dominion of
 Canada; a valid passport issued by the United States government  or  any
 other  country; an identification card issued by the armed forces of the
 United States; a public benefit card, as defined  in  paragraph  (a)  of
 subdivision one of section 158.00 of the penal law;
  (iv)  the  person  is charged with a crime between members of the same
 family or household, as defined in subdivision one of section 530.11  of
 this chapter;
  (v)  the  person is charged with a crime defined in article 130 of the
 penal law;
  (vi) it reasonably appears the person should  be  brought  before  the
 court  for consideration of issuance of an order of protection, pursuant
 A. 5992  3

 to section 530.13 of this chapter, based on the facts of  the  crime  or
 offense that the officer has reasonable cause to believe occurred;
  (vii)  the  person  is  charged  with  a crime for which the court may
 suspend or revoke his or her driver license;
  (viii) it reasonably appears to the officer,  based  on  the  observed
 behavior  of  the individual in the present contact with the officer and
 facts regarding the person's condition that indicates a sign of distress
 to such a degree that the  person  would  face  harm  without  immediate
 medical or mental health care, that bringing the person before the court
 would  be  in  such person's interest in addressing that need; provided,
 however, that before making the  arrest,  the  officer  shall  make  all
 reasonable  efforts  to  assist  the  person  in  securing  appropriate
 services;
  (ix) the person is eighteen years of age or  older  and  charged  with
 criminal  possession of a weapon on school grounds as defined in section
 265.01-a of the penal law;
  (x) the person is eighteen years of age or older and  charged  with  a
 hate crime as defined in section 485.05 of the penal law; or
  (xi)  the offense is a qualifying offense pursuant to paragraph (t) of
 subdivision four of section 510.10 of this chapter, or pursuant to para-
 graph (t) of subdivision four of section 530.40 of this chapter.]

 read as follows:
 § 510.10 Securing  order[; when required; alternatives available; stand-
  ard to be applied].
  1. When a principal, whose  future  court  attendance  at  a  criminal
 action  or  proceeding  is or may be required, INITIALLY comes under the
 control of a court, such court shall[, in accordance with  this  title,]
 by a securing order, EITHER release the principal on the principal's own
 recognizance,  [release the principal under non-monetary conditions, or,
 where authorized,] fix bail or commit the principal to  the  custody  of
 the  sheriff.  [In all such cases, except where another type of securing
 order is shown to be required by law, the court shall release the  prin-
 cipal  pending  trial  on the principal's own recognizance, unless it is
 demonstrated and the court makes an  individualized  determination  that
 the  principal  poses  a  risk of flight to avoid prosecution. If such a
 finding is made, the court must select the least restrictive alternative
 and condition or conditions that will reasonably assure the  principal's
 return to court.  The court shall explain its choice of release, release
 with  conditions,  bail or remand on the record or in writing. In making
 its determination, the court must consider and take into account  avail-
 able information about the principal, including:
  (a) The principal's activities and history;
  (b) If the principal is a defendant, the charges facing the principal;
  (c) The principal's criminal conviction record if any;
  (d)  The  principal's  record  of  previous adjudication as a juvenile
 delinquent, as retained pursuant to section 354.1 of  the  family  court
 act,  or,  of  pending cases where fingerprints are retained pursuant to
 section 306.1 of such act, or a youthful offender, if any;
  (e) The principal's previous record with respect to  flight  to  avoid
 criminal prosecution;
  (f)  If monetary bail is authorized, according to the restrictions set
 forth in this title, the principal's individual financial circumstances,
 and, in cases where bail is authorized, the principal's ability to  post
 bail  without  posing  undue  hardship, as well as his or her ability to
 obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond;
  (g) Any violation by the principal of an order of protection issued by
 any court;
  (h) The principal's history of use or possession of a firearm;
 A. 5992  6

  (i) Whether the charge is alleged to have caused serious  harm  to  an
 individual or group of individuals; and
  (j) If the principal is a defendant, in the case of an application for
 a  securing  order  pending  appeal,  the  merit or lack of merit of the
 appeal.
  2. A principal is entitled to representation  by  counsel  under  this
 chapter  in  preparing an application for release, when a securing order
 is being considered and when a securing  order  is  being  reviewed  for
 modification, revocation or termination. If the principal is financially
 unable to obtain counsel, counsel shall be assigned to the principal.
  3.  In  cases  other  than  as  described  in subdivision four of this
 section the court shall release the principal pending trial on the prin-
 cipal's own recognizance, unless the court finds on  the  record  or  in
 writing  that  release  on  the  principal's  own  recognizance will not
 reasonably assure the principal's return to court.  In  such  instances,
 the  court  shall  release  the principal under non-monetary conditions,
 selecting the least restrictive alternative  and  conditions  that  will
 reasonably  assure  the  principal's  return  to  court. The court shall
 explain its choice of alternative and conditions on  the  record  or  in
 writing.
  4.  Where  the principal stands charged with a qualifying offense, the
 court, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may in its discretion release
 the principal pending trial on the principal's own recognizance or under
 non-monetary conditions, fix bail, or, where the  defendant  is  charged
 with  a  qualifying  offense which is a felony, the court may commit the
 principal to the custody of the sheriff. A principal stands charged with
 a qualifying offense for the purposes of this subdivision when he or she
 stands charged with:
  (a) a felony enumerated in section 70.02 of the penal law, other  than
 robbery  in  the  second degree as defined in subdivision one of section
 160.10 of the penal law, provided, however, that burglary in the  second
 degree  as defined in subdivision two of section 140.25 of the penal law

 entering the living area of the dwelling;
  (b) a crime involving witness intimidation under section 215.15 of the
 penal law;
  (c)  a  crime involving witness tampering under section 215.11, 215.12

 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a

 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned  after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a separate
 felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an  identifiable  person
 or  property,  or  any  charge  of  criminal  possession of a firearm as
 defined in section 265.01-b of the penal law,  provided,  however,  that
 the  prosecutor must show reasonable cause to believe that the defendant
 committed the instant crime and any underlying crime. For  the  purposes
 of  this subparagraph, any of the underlying crimes need not be a quali-
 fying offense as defined in this subdivision. For the purposes  of  this
 paragraph,  "harm  to  an identifiable person or property" shall include
 but not be limited to theft of or damage  to  property.  However,  based
 upon  a review of the facts alleged in the accusatory instrument, if the
 court determines that such theft is negligible and does not appear to be
 in furtherance of  other  criminal  activity,  the  principal  shall  be

 tary conditions; or
  (u) criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined  in
 subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale of
 a firearm to a minor as defined in section 265.16 of the penal law.

 this section, with respect to any charge for which bail or remand is not
 ordered, and for which the  court  would  not  or  could  not  otherwise
 require  bail  or remand, a defendant may, at any time, request that the
 court set bail in a nominal amount requested by  the  defendant  in  the
 form  specified in paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 520.10 of
 this title; if the court is satisfied that the request is voluntary, the
 court shall set such bail in such amount.
  6.] When a securing order is revoked or otherwise  terminated  in  the
 course of an uncompleted action or proceeding but the principal's future
 court  attendance still is or may be required and the principal is still
 under the control of a court, a new securing order must be issued.  When
 the court revokes or otherwise terminates a securing order which commit-
 ted  the  principal  to the custody of the sheriff, the court shall give
 written notification to the sheriff of such revocation or termination of
 the securing order.
  2. THE COURT SHALL RELEASE THE PRINCIPAL ON PERSONAL  RECOGNIZANCE  OR
 ON  BAIL  UNLESS  THE  COURT MAKES AN INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION THAT:
 (A) THE PRINCIPAL POSES A RISK OF FLIGHT TO AVOID PROSECUTION;  (B)  THE
 PRINCIPAL  POSES A RISK OF FAILING TO APPEAR IN COURT BASED ON THE PRIN-
 CIPAL'S RECORD OF A PRIOR CRIMINAL CONVICTION OR FAILURE  TO  APPEAR  IN
 PRIOR  COURT PROCEEDINGS; OR (C) THE PRINCIPAL POSES A RISK OF ENDANGER-
 ING THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY. IF THE COURT  FINDS
 THAT THE PRINCIPAL POSES A RISK OF FLIGHT OR A RISK OF FAILURE TO APPEAR
 BUT  DOES  NOT POSE A RISK OF ENDANGERING THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON
 OR THE COMMUNITY, THE COURT SHALL RELEASE THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT  TO  THE
 LOWEST REASONABLE BAIL AND/OR THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE FURTHER CONDITION OR
 COMBINATION  OF CONDITIONS THAT WILL REASONABLY ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF
 THE PRINCIPAL CONSIDERING THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES  OF  THE  CHARGED
 OFFENSE,  THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, THE HISTORY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF
 A. 5992  9
 
 THE PRINCIPAL, AND THE NATURE AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE DANGER POSED BY THE
 PRINCIPAL'S RELEASE. IF THE COURT DETERMINES THAT NO CONDITION OR COMBI-
 NATION OF CONDITIONS WILL REASONABLY ASSURE THE APPEARANCE OF THE  PRIN-
 CIPAL  AND  THE  SAFETY  OF ANY OTHER PERSON OF THE COMMUNITY, THE COURT
 SHALL ORDER DETENTION WITHOUT BAIL.
  3. IF THE PRINCIPAL IS ARRESTED DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD WHILE AWAIT-
 ING A PRELIMINARY HEARING OR TRIAL, THE COURT SHALL REVOKE OR  OTHERWISE
 TERMINATE  THE SECURING ORDER AND ISSUE A NEW SECURING ORDER TAKING INTO
 ACCOUNT THE SUBSEQUENT ARREST.
  4. (A) ALL SECURING ORDERS ISSUED UNDER THIS SECTION WHERE THE PRINCI-
 PAL IS INCARCERATED SOLELY BECAUSE OF SAID ORDER SHALL BE  REVIEWED  AND
 RE-EVALUATED BY THE COURT NO LATER THAN:
  (I)  EVERY  FOUR  WEEKS  THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS A MISDEMEANOR IS THE
 HIGHEST GRADE OFFENSE;
  (II) EVERY SIX WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS E FELONY IS THE  HIGHEST
 GRADE OFFENSE;
  (III) EVERY EIGHT WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS D FELONY IS THE HIGH-
 EST GRADE OFFENSE;
  (IV)  EVERY TEN WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS C FELONY IS THE HIGHEST
 GRADE OFFENSE; OR
  (V) EVERY TWELVE WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS B FELONY IS THE  HIGH-
 EST GRADE OFFENSE.
  (B)  UPON  SUCH  REVIEW  OR  RE-EVALUATION, THE COURT SHALL RECONSIDER
 WHETHER THE PRINCIPAL SHOULD BE RELEASED  ON  PERSONAL  RECOGNIZANCE  OR
 UPON  POSTING REDUCED BAIL IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AFTER CONSIDERING
 THE LENGTH OF TIME THE PRINCIPAL  HAS  ALREADY  BEEN  INCARCERATED,  THE
 LIKELY SENTENCE THAT WOULD BE IMPOSED IF THE PRINCIPAL WERE FOUND GUILTY
 OR  PLEAD GUILTY TO THE CHARGED OFFENSE, THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF
 THE CHARGED OFFENSE, THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, THE HISTORY AND CHARAC-
 TERISTICS OF THE PRINCIPAL, THE NATURE AND  SERIOUSNESS  OF  THE  DANGER
 POSED  BY  THE  PRINCIPAL'S RELEASE, AND WHETHER THE PRINCIPAL SHOULD BE
 RELEASED SUBJECT TO A FURTHER CONDITION, OR COMBINATION  OF  CONDITIONS,
 THAT  REASONABLY  JUSTIFIES  THE  RELEASE  OF  THE PRINCIPAL ON PERSONAL
 RECOGNIZANCE OR REDUCED BAIL, AND SUCH OTHER FACTORS IN THE INTERESTS OF
 JUSTICE AS REASONABLY DETERMINED BY THE COURT BASED ON AN INDIVIDUALIZED
 DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER  AND  TO  WHAT  EXTENT  THAT  THE  PRINCIPAL
 CONTINUES  TO  POSE  A RISK OF FLIGHT TO AVOID PROSECUTION, CONTINUES TO
 POSE A RISK OF FAILING TO APPEAR  IN  COURT  BASED  ON  THE  PRINCIPAL'S
 RECORD  OF  A  PRIOR  CRIMINAL  CONVICTION OR FAILURE TO APPEAR IN PRIOR
 COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CONTINUES TO POSE A RISK OF ENDANGERING THE SAFETY
 OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY. IF THE COURT  DETERMINES  THAT  NO
 CONDITION  OR  COMBINATION  OF  CONDITIONS  WILL  REASONABLY  ENSURE THE
 APPEARANCE OF THE PRINCIPAL AND THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER  PERSON  OF  THE
 COMMUNITY, THE COURT SHALL CONTINUE TO DETAIN THE PRINCIPAL WITHOUT BAIL
 OR WITHOUT A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF THE BAIL.
  §  11.  Section  510.20  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 section 3 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
 § 510.20 Application  for  [a  change in securing order] RECOGNIZANCE OR
  BAIL; MAKING AND DETERMINATION THEREOF IN GENERAL.
  1. Upon any occasion when a court [has issued] IS REQUIRED TO ISSUE  a
 securing  order  with  respect  to a principal [and the], OR AT ANY TIME
 WHEN A principal is confined in the custody of the sheriff as  a  result
 of the securing order or a previously issued securing order, the princi-
 pal  may  make an application for recognizance[, release under non-mone-
 tary conditions] or bail.
 A. 5992  10
 
  2. [(a) The principal is entitled to representation by counsel in  the
 making  and presentation of such application. If the principal is finan-
 cially unable to obtain counsel, counsel shall be assigned to the  prin-
 cipal.
  (b)] Upon such application, the principal must be accorded an opportu-
 nity  to  be  heard[,  present evidence] and to contend that an order of
 recognizance[, release under non-monetary conditions] or[, where author-
 ized,] bail must or should issue, that  the  court  should  release  the
 principal  on  the  principal's  own recognizance [or under non-monetary
 conditions] rather than fix bail, and that if bail is  [authorized  and]
 fixed it should be in a suggested amount and form.
  §  12.  Section  510.30  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 section 5 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019,  subdivision  1
 as  amended  by  section  2 of subpart C of part UU of chapter 56 of the
 laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
 § 510.30 Application for [securing order] RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL; rules of
  law and criteria controlling determination.
  1. DETERMINATIONS OF APPLICATIONS FOR RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL ARE NOT  IN
 ALL  CASES DISCRETIONARY BUT ARE SUBJECT TO RULES, PRESCRIBED IN ARTICLE
 FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY OF THIS TITLE AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF  LAW  RELATING
 TO  SPECIFIC  KINDS  OF  CRIMINAL ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS, PROVIDING (A)
 THAT IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AN APPLICATION MUST AS A MATTER  OF  LAW
 BE  GRANTED, (B) THAT IN OTHERS IT MUST AS A MATTER OF LAW BE DENIED AND
 THE PRINCIPAL COMMITTED TO OR RETAINED IN THE CUSTODY  OF  THE  SHERIFF,
 AND  (C)  THAT  IN  OTHERS THE GRANTING OR DENIAL THEREOF IS A MATTER OF
 JUDICIAL DISCRETION.
  2. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ISSUANCE OF AN ORDER OF RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL
 AND THE TERMS THEREOF ARE MATTERS OF DISCRETION RATHER THAN OF  LAW,  AN
 APPLICATION  IS  DETERMINED  ON  THE  BASIS OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AND
 CRITERIA:
  (A) With respect to any principal, the court  [in  all  cases,  unless
 otherwise provided by law,] must [impose the least restrictive] CONSIDER
 THE  kind  and  degree  of  control  or restriction that is necessary to
 secure the principal's return to court  when  required.  In  determining
 that  matter,  the  court  must,  on the basis of available information,
 consider and take into account [information about the principal that  is
 relevant to the principal's return to court, including]:
  [(a) The principal's activities and history;
  (b) If the principal is a defendant, the charges facing the principal;
  (c)]  (I)  THE  PRINCIPAL'S  CHARACTER,  REPUTATION, HABITS AND MENTAL
 CONDITION;
  (II) THE PRINCIPAL'S EMPLOYMENT AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES;
  (III) THE PRINCIPAL'S FAMILY TIES AND THE LENGTH OF HIS OR  HER  RESI-
 DENCE IF ANY IN THE COMMUNITY;
  (IV) The principal's criminal [conviction] record if any;
  [(d)]  (V)  The principal's record of previous adjudication as a juve-
 nile delinquent, as retained pursuant to section  354.2  of  the  family
 court act, or, of pending cases where fingerprints are retained pursuant
 to section 306.1 of such act, or a youthful offender, if any;
  [(e)]  (VI)  The  principal's  previous record IF ANY IN RESPONDING TO
 COURT APPEARANCES WHEN REQUIRED OR with respect to flight to avoid crim-
 inal prosecution;
  [(f) If monetary bail is authorized, according to the restrictions set
 forth in this title, the principal's individual financial circumstances,
 and, in cases where bail is authorized, the principal's ability to  post
 A. 5992  11

 bail  without  posing  undue  hardship, as well as his or her ability to
 obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond;
  (g)]  (VII)  WHERE  THE  PRINCIPAL  IS  CHARGED WITH A CRIME OR CRIMES
 AGAINST A MEMBER OR MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD AS THAT TERM
 IS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF  SECTION  530.11  OF  THIS  TITLE,  THE
 FOLLOWING FACTORS:
  (A) any violation by the principal of an order of protection issued by
 any court; AND
  [(h)] (B) the principal's history of use or possession of a firearm;
  [(i)  whether  the charge is alleged to have caused serious harm to an
 individual or group of individuals; and
  (j)] (VIII) If the  principal  is  a  defendant,  THE  WEIGHT  OF  THE
 EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM OR HER IN THE PENDING CRIMINAL ACTION AND ANY OTHER
 FACTOR INDICATING PROBABILITY OR IMPROBABILITY OF CONVICTION; OR, in the
 case of an application for [a securing order] BAIL OR RECOGNIZANCE pend-
 ing appeal, the merit or lack of merit of the appeal; AND
  (IX)  IF  HE  OR  SHE IS A DEFENDANT, THE SENTENCE WHICH MAY BE OR HAS
 BEEN IMPOSED UPON CONVICTION.
  [2.] (B) Where the principal is a  defendant-appellant  in  a  pending
 appeal  from  a judgment of conviction, the court must also consider the
 likelihood of ultimate reversal of the judgment.  A  determination  that
 the  appeal  is  palpably  without  merit  alone justifies, but does not
 require, a denial of the application, regardless  of  any  determination
 made  with  respect  to  the  factors specified in PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS
 subdivision [one of this section].
  3. When bail or recognizance is ordered, the court  shall  inform  the
 principal,  if  the principal is a defendant charged with the commission
 of a felony, that the release is conditional  and  that  the  court  may
 revoke  the order of release and [may be authorized] to commit the prin-
 cipal to the custody of the sheriff in accordance with the provisions of
 subdivision two of section 530.60 of this [chapter] TITLE if the princi-
 pal commits a subsequent felony while at liberty upon such order.
  § 13. Section 510.40 of the criminal  procedure  law,  as  amended  by
 section  6  of  part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019 and paragraph
 (c) of subdivision 4 as amended by section 7 of part UU of chapter 56 of
 the laws of 2020, is amended to read as follows:
 § 510.40 [Court notification to principal of conditions of  release  and
  of  alleged  violations of conditions of release] APPLICATION
  FOR RECOGNIZANCE OR  BAIL;  DETERMINATION  THEREOF,  FORM  OF
  SECURING ORDER AND EXECUTION THEREOF.
  1.  AN  APPLICATION  FOR  RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL MUST BE DETERMINED BY A
 SECURING ORDER WHICH EITHER:
  (A) GRANTS THE APPLICATION AND RELEASES THE PRINCIPAL ON  HIS  OR  HER
 OWN RECOGNIZANCE; OR
  (B) GRANTS THE APPLICATION AND FIXES BAIL; OR
  (C)  DENIES  THE  APPLICATION AND COMMITS THE PRINCIPAL TO, OR RETAINS
 HIM OR HER IN, THE CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF.
  2. Upon ordering that a principal be released on the  principal's  own
 recognizance,  [or  released  under non-monetary conditions, or, if bail
 has been fixed, upon the posting of bail,] the  court  must  direct  the
 principal  to appear in the criminal action or proceeding involved when-
 ever the principal's attendance may be required and to [be]  RENDER  THE
 PRINCIPAL  at  all  times  amenable to the orders and processes of the
 court. If such principal is in the custody of the sheriff or at  liberty
 upon bail at the time of the order, the court must direct that the prin-
 A. 5992  12
 
 cipal  be  discharged from such custody or, as the case may be, that the
 principal's bail be exonerated.
  [2.] 3. Upon the issuance of an order fixing bail[, where authorized,]
 and  upon the posting thereof, the court must examine the bail to deter-
 mine whether it complies with the order. If it does, the court must,  in
 the  absence  of  some  factor  or circumstance which in law requires or
 authorizes disapproval thereof,  approve  the  bail  and  must  issue  a
 certificate of release, authorizing the principal to be at liberty, and,
 if the principal is in the custody of the sheriff at the time, directing
 the  sheriff  to discharge the principal therefrom. If the bail fixed is
 not posted, or is not approved after being posted, the court must  order
 that  the  principal be committed to the custody of the sheriff. [In the
 event of any such non-approval, the  court  shall  explain  promptly  in
 writing the reasons therefor.
  3.  Non-monetary  conditions  of  release  shall be individualized and
 established in writing by the court. At future  court  appearances,  the
 court shall consider a lessening of conditions or modification of condi-
 tions to a less burdensome form based on the principal's compliance with
 such  conditions of release. In the event of alleged non-compliance with
 the conditions of release in an  important  respect,  pursuant  to  this
 subdivision,  additional  conditions may be imposed by the court, on the
 record or in writing, only after notice of the facts  and  circumstances
 of  such  alleged  non-compliance,  reasonable  under the circumstances,
 affording the principal and the principal's attorney and the  people  an
 opportunity to present relevant, admissible evidence, relevant witnesses
 and  to  cross-examine  witnesses, and a finding by clear and convincing
 evidence that the principal violated a condition of release in an impor-
 tant respect. Following such a finding, in determining whether to impose
 additional conditions for non-compliance, the court shall  consider  and
 may  select  conditions consistent with the court's obligation to impose
 the least restrictive  condition  or  conditions  that  will  reasonably
 assure  the  defendant's return to court. The court shall explain on the
 record or in writing the reasons  for  its  determination  and  for  any
 changes to the conditions imposed.
  4.  (a) Electronic monitoring of a principal's location may be ordered
 only if the court finds, after notice, an opportunity to be heard and an
 individualized determination explained on the record or in writing, that
 the defendant qualifies for electronic  monitoring  in  accordance  with
 subdivision  twenty-one  of  section  500.10 of this title, and no other
 realistic non-monetary condition or set of non-monetary conditions  will
 suffice to reasonably assure a principal's return to court.
  (b)  The  specific  method of electronic monitoring of the principal's
 location must be approved by the court. It must be the least restrictive
 procedure and method that will reasonably assure the principal's  return
 to court, and unobtrusive to the greatest extent practicable.
  (c)  Electronic  monitoring  of  the  location  of  a principal may be
 conducted only by a public entity under the supervision and control of a
 county or municipality or a non-profit  entity  under  contract  to  the
 county,  municipality  or  the  state. A county or municipality shall be
 authorized to enter into a contract with another county or  municipality
 in  the  state  to  monitor  principals under non-monetary conditions of
 release in its county, but counties, municipalities and the state  shall
 not  contract  with  any  private  for-profit  entity for such purposes.
 Counties, municipalities and the state may contract with a private  for-
 profit  entity  to  supply electronic monitoring devices or other items,
 provided that any interaction with persons under  electronic  monitoring
 A. 5992  13

 or  the  data  produced  by such monitoring shall be conducted solely by
 employees of a county, municipality, the state, or a  non-profit  entity
 under contract with such county, municipality or the state.
  (d) Electronic monitoring of a principal's location may be for a maxi-
 mum  period  of  sixty  days,  and may be renewed for such period, after
 notice, an opportunity to be heard and a de novo, individualized  deter-
 mination  in  accordance with this subdivision, which shall be explained
 on the record or in writing.
  A defendant subject  to  electronic  location  monitoring  under  this
 subdivision shall be considered held or confined in custody for purposes
 of  section  180.80 of this chapter and shall be considered committed to
 the custody of the sheriff for purposes of section 170.70 of  the  chap-
 ter, as applicable.
  5. If a principal is released under non-monetary conditions, the court
 shall,  on the record and in an individualized written document provided
 to the principal, notify the principal, in plain language and  a  manner
 sufficiently clear and specific:
  (a) of any conditions to which the principal is subject, to serve as a
 guide for the principal's conduct; and
  (b)  that  the possible consequences for violation of such a condition
 may include revocation of the securing order and the ordering of a  more
 restrictive securing order.]
  §  14.  Sections  510.43  and 510.45 of the criminal procedure law are
 REPEALED.
  § 15. Section 510.50 of the criminal  procedure  law,  as  amended  by
 section  9  of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended to
 read as follows:
 § 510.50 Enforcement of securing order.
  [1.] When the attendance of a principal confined in the custody of the
 sheriff is required at the criminal action or proceeding at a particular
 time and place, the court may compel such attendance  by  directing  the
 sheriff  to produce the principal at such time and place. If the princi-
 pal is at liberty on the principal's own recognizance  [or  non-monetary
 conditions]  or  on  bail, the principal's attendance may be achieved or
 compelled by various methods, including notification and the issuance of
 a bench warrant, prescribed by law in provisions governing such  matters
 with respect to the particular kind of action or proceeding involved.
  [2.  Except  when  the  principal is charged with a new crime while at
 liberty, absent relevant, credible evidence demonstrating that a princi-
 pal's failure to appear for a scheduled court  appearance  was  willful,
 the  court, prior to issuing a bench warrant for a failure to appear for
 a scheduled court appearance, shall provide at least  forty-eight  hours
 notice to the principal or the principal's counsel that the principal is
 required  to  appear,  in  order to give the principal an opportunity to
 appear voluntarily.]
  § 16. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 520.10 of the criminal
 procedure law, as amended by section 10 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the
 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (b) The court [shall] MAY direct that the bail be posted in any one of
 [three] TWO or more of the forms specified in subdivision  one  of  this
 section,  designated  in  the  alternative,  and may designate different
 amounts varying with the forms[, except that one of the forms  shall  be
 either an unsecured or partially secured surety bond, as selected by the
 court].

  §  17.  Section  530.10  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 section 11 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended  to
 read as follows:
 § 530.10 Order  of  recognizance [release under non-monetary conditions]
  or bail; in general.
  Under circumstances prescribed in this article, a court, upon applica-
 tion of a defendant charged with or convicted of an offense, is required
 [to issue a securing order] OR AUTHORIZED TO ORDER BAIL OR  RECOGNIZANCE
 for  THE  RELEASE  OR  PROSPECTIVE  RELEASE OF such defendant during the
 pendency of either:
  1. A criminal action based upon such charge; or
  2. An appeal taken by the defendant from a judgment of conviction or a
 sentence or from an order of an intermediate appellate  court  affirming
 or modifying a judgment of conviction or a sentence.
  §  18.  Subdivision 4 of section 530.11 of the criminal procedure law,
 as amended by section 12 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of  2019,
 is amended to read as follows:
  4.  When  a  person  is  arrested  for an alleged family offense or an
 alleged violation of an  order  of  protection  or  temporary  order  of
 protection  or  arrested  pursuant to a warrant issued by the supreme or
 family court, and the supreme or family court, as applicable, is not  in
 session,  such  person shall be brought before a local criminal court in
 the county of arrest or in the county in which such warrant  is  return-
 able  pursuant to article one hundred twenty of this chapter. Such local
 criminal court may issue any order authorized under  subdivision  eleven
 of  section  530.12 of this article, section one hundred fifty-four-d or
 one hundred fifty-five of the family court act or subdivision three-b of
 section two hundred forty or subdivision two-a of  section  two  hundred
 fifty-two  of  the  domestic  relations  law, in addition to discharging
 other arraignment responsibilities as set  forth  in  this  chapter.  In
 making such order, the local criminal court shall consider [de novo] the
 BAIL recommendation [and securing order], if any, made by the supreme or
 family  court  as  indicated  on  the warrant or certificate of warrant.
 Unless the petitioner or complainant requests otherwise, the  court,  in
 addition  to  scheduling further criminal proceedings, if any, regarding
 such alleged family offense or violation  allegation,  shall  make  such
 matter  returnable in the supreme or family court, as applicable, on the
 next day such court is in session.
  § 19. Subdivision 11 of section 530.12 of the criminal procedure  law,
 as  amended by section 15 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019,
 is amended to read as follows:
  11. If a defendant is brought before the court for failure to obey any
 lawful order issued under this section, or an order of protection issued
 by a court of competent jurisdiction in another  state,  territorial  or
 tribal  jurisdiction,  and  if, after hearing, the court is satisfied by
 competent proof that the defendant has willfully failed to obey any such
 order, the court may:
  (a) revoke an order of recognizance  [or  release  under  non-monetary
 conditions]  or revoke an order of bail or order forfeiture of such bail
 and commit the defendant to custody; or
  (b) restore the case to the calendar when there has been  an  adjourn-
 ment  in contemplation of dismissal and commit the defendant to custody;
 or
  (c) revoke a conditional discharge in accordance with  section  410.70

 and  impose  a sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the penal law
 based on the original conviction. In addition, if the act which  consti-
 tutes  the  violation  of  the order of protection or temporary order of
 protection is a crime or a violation the defendant may be  charged  with
 and tried for that crime or violation.
  §  20. The opening paragraph of subdivision 1 of section 530.13 of the
 criminal procedure law, as amended by section 14 of part JJJ of  chapter

 ANT  TO  THE  CUSTODY  OF  THE  SHERIFF OR AS A CONDITION OF A PRE-TRIAL
 RELEASE, OR AS A CONDITION OF RELEASE  ON  BAIL  or  an  adjournment  in
 contemplation of dismissal. In addition to any other conditions, such an
 order may require that the defendant:

 new section 530.20 is added to read as follows:
 § 530.20 ORDER  OF  RECOGNIZANCE  OR  BAIL; BY LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT WHEN
  ACTION IS PENDING THEREIN.
  WHEN A CRIMINAL ACTION IS PENDING IN  A  LOCAL  CRIMINAL  COURT,  SUCH
 COURT,  UPON  APPLICATION OF A DEFENDANT, MUST OR MAY ORDER RECOGNIZANCE
 OR BAIL AS FOLLOWS:
  1. WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED, BY INFORMATION, SIMPLIFIED  INFORMA-
 TION, PROSECUTOR'S INFORMATION OR MISDEMEANOR COMPLAINT, WITH AN OFFENSE
 OR  OFFENSES OF LESS THAN FELONY GRADE ONLY, THE COURT MUST ORDER RECOG-
 NIZANCE OR BAIL.
  2. WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED, BY FELONY COMPLAINT, WITH A  FELONY,
 THE  COURT  MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, ORDER RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL EXCEPT AS
 OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SUBDIVISION:
  (A) A CITY COURT, A TOWN COURT OR A VILLAGE COURT MAY NOT ORDER RECOG-
 NIZANCE OR BAIL WHEN (I) THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH A CLASS A FELONY,
 OR  (II)  IT  APPEARS  THAT  THE  DEFENDANT  HAS  TWO  PREVIOUS  FELONY
 CONVICTIONS;
  (B)  NO  LOCAL  CRIMINAL  COURT  MAY  ORDER  RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL WITH
 RESPECT TO A DEFENDANT CHARGED WITH A FELONY UNLESS AND UNTIL:
  (I) THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS BEEN HEARD IN THE MATTER OR, AFTER KNOW-
 LEDGE OR NOTICE OF THE APPLICATION  AND  REASONABLE  OPPORTUNITY  TO  BE
 HEARD,  HAS  FAILED  TO APPEAR AT THE PROCEEDING OR HAS OTHERWISE WAIVED
 HIS OR HER RIGHT TO DO SO; AND
  (II) THE COURT HAS BEEN FURNISHED WITH A REPORT  OF  THE  DIVISION  OF
 CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SERVICES CONCERNING THE DEFENDANT'S CRIMINAL RECORD IF
 ANY OR WITH A POLICE DEPARTMENT REPORT WITH RESPECT TO  THE  DEFENDANT'S
 PRIOR ARREST RECORD. IF NEITHER REPORT IS AVAILABLE, THE COURT, WITH THE
 CONSENT  OF  THE  DISTRICT ATTORNEY, MAY DISPENSE WITH THIS REQUIREMENT;
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN AN EMERGENCY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO  A
 SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT IN THE ABILITY OF SUCH DIVISION OR POLICE DEPART-
 A. 5992  16
 
 MENT  TO  TIMELY FURNISH SUCH REPORT, SUCH CONSENT SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED
 IF, FOR REASONS STATED ON THE RECORD, THE COURT  DEEMS  IT  UNNECESSARY.

 SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY. IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THE
 DEFENDANT POSES A RISK OF FLIGHT OR A RISK OF FAILURE TO APPEAR BUT DOES
 NOT POSE A RISK OF ENDANGERING THE SAFETY OF ANY  OTHER  PERSON  OR  THE
 COMMUNITY,  THE  COURT SHALL RELEASE THE DEFENDANT SUBJECT TO THE LOWEST
 REASONABLE BAIL AND/OR THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE FURTHER CONDITION OR COMBI-

 DEFENDANT'S RELEASE. IF THE COURT DETERMINES THAT NO CONDITION OR COMBI-
 NATION  OF  CONDITIONS  WILL  REASONABLY  ASSURE  THE  APPEARANCE OF THE
 DEFENDANT AND THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OF THE COMMUNITY, THE COURT
 SHALL ORDER DETENTION WITHOUT BAIL.
  4. IF THE DEFENDANT IS ARRESTED DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD WHILE AWAIT-
 ING A PRELIMINARY HEARING OR TRIAL, THE COURT SHALL REVOKE OR  OTHERWISE
 TERMINATE  THE  PREVIOUS ORDER AND ISSUE A NEW ORDER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

 WHETHER THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE RELEASED  ON  PERSONAL  RECOGNIZANCE  OR
 UPON  POSTING REDUCED BAIL IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AFTER CONSIDERING
 THE LENGTH OF TIME THE DEFENDANT  HAS  ALREADY  BEEN  INCARCERATED,  THE
 LIKELY SENTENCE THAT WOULD BE IMPOSED IF THE DEFENDANT WERE FOUND GUILTY
 OR  PLED  GUILTY TO THE CHARGED OFFENSE, THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF
 THE CHARGED OFFENSE, THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, THE HISTORY AND CHARAC-
 TERISTICS OF THE DEFENDANT, THE NATURE AND  SERIOUSNESS  OF  THE  DANGER
 POSED  BY  THE  DEFENDANT'S RELEASE, AND WHETHER THE PRINCIPAL SHOULD BE
 RELEASED SUBJECT TO A FURTHER CONDITION, OR COMBINATION  OF  CONDITIONS,
 THAT  REASONABLY  JUSTIFIES  THE  RELEASE  OF  THE DEFENDANT ON PERSONAL
 RECOGNIZANCE OR REDUCED BAIL, AND SUCH OTHER FACTORS IN THE INTERESTS OF
 JUSTICE AS REASONABLY DETERMINED BY THE COURT BASED ON AN INDIVIDUALIZED
 DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER  AND  TO  WHAT  EXTENT  THAT  THE  DEFENDANT

 POSE A RISK OF FAILING TO APPEAR  IN  COURT  BASED  ON  THE  DEFENDANT'S
 A. 5992  17

 RECORD  OF  A  PRIOR  CRIMINAL  CONVICTION OR FAILURE TO APPEAR IN PRIOR
 COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CONTINUES TO POSE A RISK OF ENDANGERING THE SAFETY
 OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY. IF THE COURT  DETERMINES  THAT  NO
 CONDITION  OR  COMBINATION  OF  CONDITIONS  WILL  REASONABLY  ENSURE THE
 APPEARANCE OF THE DEFENDANT AND THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER  PERSON  OF  THE
 COMMUNITY, THE COURT SHALL CONTINUE TO DETAIN THE DEFENDANT WITHOUT BAIL
 OR WITHOUT A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF THE BAIL.
  §  23.  The section heading and subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 530.30
 of the criminal procedure law, as amended by section 17 of part  JJJ  of
 chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
 Order  of recognizance[, release under non-monetary conditions] or bail;
 by superior court judge when action is pending in local criminal court.
  1. When a criminal action is pending in a local criminal court,  other
 than  one  consisting of a superior court judge sitting as such, a judge
 of a superior court holding a term thereof in the county, upon  applica-
 tion of a defendant, may order recognizance[, release under non-monetary
 conditions] or[, where authorized,] bail when such local criminal court:
  (a)  Lacks  authority to issue such an order, pursuant to the relevant
 provisions of section 530.20 of this article; or
  (b) Has denied an application for recognizance[,  release  under  non-
 monetary conditions] or bail; or
  (c) Has fixed bail[, where authorized,] which is excessive[; or
  (d)  Has set a securing order of release under non-monetary conditions
 which are more restrictive  than  necessary  to  reasonably  assure  the
 defendant's return to court].
  In  such  case, such superior court judge may vacate the order of such
 local criminal court and release the defendant on HIS OR HER OWN  recog-
 nizance  [or  under non-monetary conditions,] or [where authorized,] fix
 bail in a lesser amount or in a less burdensome form[, whichever are the
 least restrictive alternative and conditions that will reasonably assure
 the defendant's return to court. The court shall explain its  choice  of
 alternative and conditions on the record or in writing].
  2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this section,
 when the defendant is charged with a felony in a local criminal court, a
 superior court judge may not order recognizance, [release under non-mon-
 etary conditions] or[, where authorized,]  bail  unless  and  until  the
 district  attorney  has had an opportunity to be heard in the matter and
 such judge [and counsel for the defendant have] HAS been furnished  with
 a  report as described in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of subdivi-
 sion two of section 530.20 of this article.
  § 24. Section 530.40 of the criminal procedure law is REPEALED  and  a
 new section 530.40 is added to read as follows:
 § 530.40 ORDER OF RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL; BY SUPERIOR COURT WHEN ACTION IS
  PENDING THEREIN.
  WHEN  A  CRIMINAL  ACTION  IS PENDING IN A SUPERIOR COURT, SUCH COURT,
 UPON APPLICATION OF A DEFENDANT, MUST OR MAY ORDER RECOGNIZANCE OR  BAIL
 AS FOLLOWS:
  1.  WHEN  THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH AN OFFENSE OR OFFENSES OF LESS
 THAN FELONY GRADE ONLY, THE COURT MUST ORDER RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL.
  2. WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH A FELONY, THE COURT MAY, IN  ITS
 DISCRETION,  ORDER  RECOGNIZANCE  OR  BAIL. IN ANY SUCH CASE IN WHICH AN
 INDICTMENT (A) HAS RESULTED FROM AN ORDER  OF  A  LOCAL  CRIMINAL  COURT
 HOLDING THE DEFENDANT FOR THE ACTION OF THE GRAND JURY, OR (B) WAS FILED
 AT  A TIME WHEN A FELONY COMPLAINT CHARGING THE SAME CONDUCT WAS PENDING
 IN A LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT, AND IN WHICH SUCH LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT  OR  A
 SUPERIOR  COURT  JUDGE HAS ISSUED AN ORDER OF RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL WHICH
 A. 5992  18
 
 IS STILL EFFECTIVE, THE SUPERIOR COURT'S ORDER MAY BE IN THE FORM  OF  A
 DIRECTION CONTINUING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PREVIOUS ORDER.
  3.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION,
 A SUPERIOR COURT MAY NOT ORDER RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL, OR PERMIT A DEFEND-
 ANT TO REMAIN AT LIBERTY  PURSUANT  TO  AN  EXISTING  ORDER,  AFTER  THE
 DEFENDANT  HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF EITHER: (A) A CLASS A FELONY OR (B) ANY
 CLASS B OR CLASS C FELONY DEFINED IN ARTICLE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY  OF  THE
 PENAL  LAW  COMMITTED  OR ATTEMPTED TO BE COMMITTED BY A PERSON EIGHTEEN
 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER AGAINST A PERSON LESS THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF  AGE.
 IN  EITHER  CASE  THE  COURT  MUST COMMIT OR REMAND THE DEFENDANT TO THE
 CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF.
  4. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS  SECTION,
 A  SUPERIOR  COURT MAY NOT ORDER RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL WHEN THE DEFENDANT
 IS CHARGED WITH A FELONY UNLESS AND UNTIL THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS  HAD
 AN  OPPORTUNITY  TO  BE  HEARD  IN  THE  MATTER  AND SUCH COURT HAS BEEN
 FURNISHED WITH A REPORT AS DESCRIBED IN SUBPARAGRAPH (II)  OF  PARAGRAPH
 (B) OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION 530.20 OF THIS ARTICLE.
  5.  THE  COURT SHALL MAKE AN INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION IF:  (A) THE
 DEFENDANT POSES A RISK OF FLIGHT TO AVOID PROSECUTION; (B) THE DEFENDANT
 POSES A RISK OF FAILING TO APPEAR IN  COURT  BASED  ON  THE  DEFENDANT'S
 RECORD  OF  A  PRIOR  CRIMINAL  CONVICTION OR FAILURE TO APPEAR IN PRIOR
 COURT PROCEEDINGS; OR (C) THE DEFENDANT POSES A RISK OF ENDANGERING  THE
 SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY. IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THE
 DEFENDANT POSES A RISK OF FLIGHT OR A RISK OF FAILURE TO APPEAR BUT DOES
 NOT  POSE  A  RISK  OF ENDANGERING THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE
 COMMUNITY, THE COURT SHALL RELEASE THE DEFENDANT SUBJECT TO  THE  LOWEST
 REASONABLE BAIL AND/OR THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE FURTHER CONDITION OR COMBI-
 NATION  OF  CONDITIONS THAT WILL REASONABLY ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF THE
 DEFENDANT CONSIDERING  THE  NATURE  AND  CIRCUMSTANCES  OF  THE  CHARGED
 OFFENSE,  THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, THE HISTORY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF
 THE DEFENDANT, AND THE NATURE AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE DANGER POSED BY THE
 DEFENDANT'S RELEASE. IF THE COURT DETERMINES THAT NO CONDITION OR COMBI-
 NATION OF CONDITIONS  WILL  REASONABLY  ASSURE  THE  APPEARANCE  OF  THE
 DEFENDANT AND THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OF THE COMMUNITY, THE COURT
 SHALL ORDER DETENTION WITHOUT BAIL.
  6. IF THE DEFENDANT IS ARRESTED DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD WHILE AWAIT-
 ING  A PRELIMINARY HEARING OR TRIAL, THE COURT SHALL REVOKE OR OTHERWISE
 TERMINATE THE PREVIOUS ORDER AND ISSUE A NEW ORDER TAKING  INTO  ACCOUNT
 THE SUBSEQUENT ARREST.
  7.  (A)  ALL  ORDERS  ISSUED UNDER THIS SECTION WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS
 INCARCERATED SOLELY BECAUSE OF SAID ORDER SHALL BE REVIEWED AND RE-EVAL-
 UATED BY THE COURT NO LATER THAN:
  (I) EVERY FOUR WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS  A  MISDEMEANOR  IS  THE
 HIGHEST GRADE OFFENSE;
  (II)  EVERY SIX WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS E FELONY IS THE HIGHEST
 GRADE OFFENSE;
  (III) EVERY EIGHT WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS D FELONY IS THE HIGH-
 EST GRADE OFFENSE;
  (IV) EVERY TEN WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS C FELONY IS THE  HIGHEST
 GRADE OFFENSE; OR
  (V)  EVERY TWELVE WEEKS THEREAFTER WHERE A CLASS B FELONY IS THE HIGH-
 EST GRADE OFFENSE.
  (B) UPON SUCH REVIEW OR  RE-EVALUATION,  THE  COURT  SHALL  RECONSIDER
 WHETHER  THE  DEFENDANT  SHOULD  BE RELEASED ON PERSONAL RECOGNIZANCE OR
 UPON POSTING REDUCED BAIL IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AFTER  CONSIDERING
 THE  LENGTH  OF  TIME  THE  DEFENDANT HAS ALREADY BEEN INCARCERATED, THE
 A. 5992  19
 
 LIKELY SENTENCE THAT WOULD BE IMPOSED IF THE DEFENDANT WERE FOUND GUILTY
 OR PLED GUILTY TO THE CHARGED OFFENSE, THE NATURE AND  CIRCUMSTANCES  OF
 THE CHARGED OFFENSE, THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, THE HISTORY AND CHARAC-
 TERISTICS  OF  THE  DEFENDANT,  THE NATURE AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE DANGER
 POSED BY THE DEFENDANT'S RELEASE, AND WHETHER THE  PRINCIPAL  SHOULD  BE
 RELEASED  SUBJECT  TO A FURTHER CONDITION, OR COMBINATION OF CONDITIONS,
 THAT REASONABLY JUSTIFIES THE  RELEASE  OF  THE  DEFENDANT  ON  PERSONAL
 RECOGNIZANCE OR REDUCED BAIL, AND SUCH OTHER FACTORS IN THE INTERESTS OF
 JUSTICE AS REASONABLY DETERMINED BY THE COURT BASED ON AN INDIVIDUALIZED
 DETERMINATION  AS  TO  WHETHER  AND  TO  WHAT  EXTENT THAT THE DEFENDANT
 CONTINUES TO POSE A RISK OF FLIGHT TO AVOID  PROSECUTION,  CONTINUES  TO
 POSE  A  RISK  OF  FAILING  TO  APPEAR IN COURT BASED ON THE DEFENDANT'S
 RECORD OF A PRIOR CRIMINAL CONVICTION OR  FAILURE  TO  APPEAR  IN  PRIOR
 COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CONTINUES TO POSE A RISK OF ENDANGERING THE SAFETY
 OF  ANY  OTHER  PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY. IF THE COURT DETERMINES THAT NO
 CONDITION OR  COMBINATION  OF  CONDITIONS  WILL  REASONABLY  ENSURE  THE
 APPEARANCE  OF  THE  DEFENDANT AND THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OF THE
 COMMUNITY, THE COURT SHALL CONTINUE TO DETAIN THE DEFENDANT WITHOUT BAIL
 OR WITHOUT A REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF THE BAIL.
  § 25. Subdivision 1 of section 530.45 of the criminal  procedure  law,
 as  amended by section 19 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019,
 is amended to read as follows:
  1. When the defendant is at liberty in the course of a criminal action
 as a result of a prior order of recognizance[, release  under  non-mone-
 tary  conditions]  or  bail  and the court revokes such order and then[,
 where authorized,] EITHER fixes no bail  or  fixes  bail  in  a  greater
 amount  or  in  a  more  burdensome  form  than was previously fixed and
 remands or commits defendant to the custody of the sheriff, [or issues a
 more restrictive securing order,] a judge designated in subdivision  two
 of  this section, upon application of the defendant following conviction
 of an offense other than a class A felony or a class B or class C felony
 offense as defined in article  one  hundred  thirty  of  the  penal  law
 committed or attempted to be committed by a person eighteen years of age
 or  older  against  a person less than eighteen years of age, and before
 sentencing, may issue a securing order and EITHER release the  defendant
 on  the  defendant's own recognizance, [release the defendant under non-
 monetary conditions,] or[, where authorized,] fix bail or fix bail in  a
 lesser amount or in a less burdensome form[, or issue a less restrictive
 securing  order,]  than  fixed  by the court in which the conviction was
 entered.
  § 26. Subdivision 2-a of section 530.45 of the criminal procedure  law
 is REPEALED.
  §  27.  Section  530.50  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 chapter 264 of the laws of 2003, subdivision 1 as designated and  subdi-
 vision  2 as added by section 10 of part UU of chapter 56 of the laws of
 2020, and subdivision 3 as added by section 4 of subpart D of part UU of
 chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
 § 530.50 Order of recognizance or bail; during pendency of appeal.
  [1.] A judge who is otherwise authorized pursuant to section 460.50 or
 [section] 460.60 OF THIS CHAPTER to issue an order  of  recognizance  or
 bail  pending  the  determination  of  an  appeal,  may do so unless the
 defendant received a class A felony sentence or a sentence for any class
 B or class C felony offense defined in article one hundred thirty of the
 penal law committed or attempted to be committed by  a  person  eighteen
 years of age or older against a person less than eighteen years of age.
 A. 5992  20
 
  [2.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision four of section
 510.10, paragraph (b) of subdivision one of section 530.20 and  subdivi-
 sion four of section 530.40 of this title, when a defendant charged with
 an offense that is not such a qualifying offense applies, pending deter-
 mination  of  an appeal, for an order of recognizance or release on non-
 monetary conditions, where authorized, or fixing bail, a  judge  identi-
 fied  in  subdivision  two  of  section  460.50  or  paragraph  (a)  of
 subdivision one of section 460.60 of this  chapter  may,  in  accordance
 with  law,  and  except  as  otherwise provided by law, issue a securing
 order: releasing the defendant on the defendant's  own  recognizance  or
 under  non-monetary conditions where authorized, fixing bail, or remand-
 ing the defendant to the custody of the sheriff where authorized.
  3. Where an appeal by the people has been taken from an order dismiss-
 ing one or more counts of an accusatory instrument for failure to comply
 with a discovery order pursuant to subdivision twelve of section  450.20
 of  this  chapter and the defendant is charged with a qualifying offense
 in the remaining counts in the accusatory instrument,  pending  determi-
 nation  of  an  appeal, the defendant may apply for an order of recogni-
 zance or release on non-monetary conditions, where authorized, or fixing
 bail. A judge identified in subdivision two of section  460.50  of  this
 chapter  or  paragraph  (a) of subdivision one of section 460.60 of this
 chapter may, in accordance with law, and except as otherwise provided by
 law, issue a securing order releasing the defendant on  the  defendant's
 own  recognizance  or  under  non-monetary  conditions where authorized,
 fixing bail, or remanding the defendant to the custody  of  the  sheriff
 where authorized.]
  §  28.  Section  530.60  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 section 20 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended  to
 read as follows:
 § 530.60 [Certain  modifications  of a securing order] ORDER OF RECOGNI-
  ZANCE OR BAIL; REVOCATION THEREOF.
  1. Whenever in the course of a criminal action or proceeding a defend-
 ant is at liberty as a result of  an  order  of  recognizance[,  release
 under  non-monetary conditions] or bail issued pursuant to this chapter,
 and the court considers it necessary to review such order, [whether  due
 to  a  motion by the people or otherwise,] the court may, and [except as
 provided in subdivision two of section 510.50 of this title concerning a
 failure to appear in court,] by a bench warrant  if  necessary,  require
 the  defendant  to  appear  before  the court. Upon such appearance, the
 court, for good cause shown, may  revoke  the  order  of  recognizance[,
 release  under  non-monetary  conditions,]  or bail. If the defendant is
 entitled to recognizance[, release under  non-monetary  conditions,]  or
 bail  as  a matter of right, the court must issue another such order. If
 the defendant is not, the court may either issue such an order or commit
 the defendant to the custody of the  sheriff  in  accordance  with  this
 section.
  Where  the defendant is committed to the custody of the sheriff and is
 held on a felony complaint, a new period as provided in  section  180.80
 of  this  chapter shall commence to run from the time of the defendant's
 commitment under this subdivision.
  2. (a) Whenever in the course of a criminal  action  or  proceeding  a
 defendant  charged  with  the  commission of a felony is at liberty as a
 result of an order of recognizance, [release under  non-monetary  condi-
 tions]  or  bail issued pursuant to this article it shall be grounds for
 revoking such order that the court finds reasonable cause to believe the
 defendant committed one or more specified  class  A  or  violent  felony
 A. 5992  21
 
 offenses  or  intimidated  a  victim  or witness in violation of section
 215.15, 215.16 or 215.17 of the penal law while at liberty.
  [(b)  Except  as  provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision or any
 other law, whenever in the course of a criminal action or  proceeding  a
 defendant  charged  with the commission of an offense is at liberty as a
 result of an order of recognizance, release  under  non-monetary  condi-
 tions  or  bail  issued pursuant to this article it shall be grounds for
 revoking such order and fixing bail in such criminal action or  proceed-
 ing when the court has found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the
 defendant:
  (i) persistently and willfully failed to appear after notice of sched-
 uled appearances in the case before the court; or
  (ii)  violated  an  order  of  protection  in the manner prohibited by
 subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of section 215.51 of the penal law while  at
 liberty; or
  (iii)  stands  charged  in  such  criminal action or proceeding with a
 misdemeanor or violation and, after  being  so  charged,  intimidated  a
 victim  or  witness  in violation of section 215.15, 215.16 or 215.17 of
 the penal law or tampered with a witness in violation of section 215.11,
 215.12 or 215.13 of the penal law, law while at liberty; or
  (iv) stands charged in such action or proceeding with  a  felony  and,
 after being so charged, committed a felony while at liberty.
  (c)] Before revoking an order of recognizance[, release under non-mon-
 etary  conditions,] or bail pursuant to this subdivision, the court must
 hold a hearing and shall receive any relevant, admissible  evidence  not
 legally  privileged.  The  defendant may cross-examine witnesses and may
 present relevant, admissible evidence on his own  behalf.  Such  hearing
 may  be  consolidated  with, and conducted at the same time as, a felony
 hearing conducted pursuant to article one hundred eighty of  this  chap-
 ter.  A transcript of testimony taken before the grand jury upon presen-
 tation of the subsequent offense shall be admissible as evidence  during
 the  hearing.  The  district  attorney  may move to introduce grand jury
 testimony of a witness in lieu of that witness' appearance at the  hear-
 ing.
  [(d)]  (B) Revocation of an order of recognizance[, release under non-
 monetary conditions] or bail and [a new securing order fixing  bail  or]
 commitment[, as specified in this paragraph and] pursuant to this subdi-
 vision shall be for the following periods, EITHER:
  [(i)  Under paragraph (a) of this subdivision, revocation of the order
 of recognizance, release under non-monetary conditions or, as  the  case
 may  be,  bail,  and  a new securing order fixing bail or committing the
 defendant to the custody of the sheriff shall be as follows:
  (A)] (I) For a period not to exceed ninety days exclusive of any peri-
 ods of adjournment requested by the defendant; or
  [(B)] (II) Until the charges contained within the  accusatory  instru-
 ment  have  been  reduced  or dismissed such that no count remains which
 charges the defendant with commission of a felony; or
  [(C)] (III) Until reduction or  dismissal  of  the  charges  contained
 within  the  accusatory  instrument charging the subsequent offense such
 that no count remains which charges the defendant with commission  of  a
 class A or violent felony offense.
  Upon  expiration  of  any  of  the three periods specified within this
 [subparagraph] PARAGRAPH, whichever is shortest, the court may grant  or
 deny  release  upon  an order of bail or recognizance in accordance with
 the provisions of this  article.  Upon  conviction  to  an  offense  the
 A. 5992  22
 
 provisions  of  THIS article [five hundred thirty of this chapter] shall
 apply[; and].
  [(ii) Under paragraph (b) of this subdivision, revocation of the order
 of  recognizance,  release under non-monetary conditions or, as the case
 may be, bail shall result in the issuance of a new securing order  which
 may,  if  otherwise authorized by law, permit the principal's release on
 recognizance or release under non-monetary conditions,  but  shall  also
 render  the defendant eligible for an order fixing bail provided, howev-
 er, that in accordance with the principles in this title the court  must
 select  the  least  restrictive  alternative and condition or conditions
 that will reasonably assure the principal's return to court.  Nothing in
 this subparagraph shall be  interpreted  as  shortening  the  period  of
 detention,  or  requiring  or authorizing any less restrictive form of a
 securing order, which may be imposed pursuant to any other law.
  (e)] (C) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) [or  (b)]  of
 this  subdivision  a defendant, against whom a felony complaint has been
 filed which charges the defendant  with  commission  of  a  class  A  or
 violent felony offense [or violation of section 215.15, 215.16 or 215.17
 of  the penal law] committed while he OR SHE was at liberty as specified
 therein, may be committed to the custody of the sheriff pending a  revo-
 cation  hearing  for  a period not to exceed seventy-two hours. An addi-
 tional period not to exceed seventy-two hours  may  be  granted  by  the
 court  upon  application of the district attorney upon a showing of good
 cause or where the failure to  commence  the  hearing  was  due  to  the
 defendant's request or occurred with his OR HER consent. Such good cause
 must  consist  of  some  compelling fact or circumstance which precluded
 conducting the hearing within the initial prescribed period.
  § 29. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 9 of section 216.05 of the criminal
 procedure law, as amended by chapter 435 of the laws of 2021, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (a) If at any time during the defendant's participation in  the  judi-
 cial diversion program, the court has reasonable grounds to believe that
 the defendant has violated a release condition [in an important respect]
 or  has  [willfully] failed to appear before the court as requested, the
 court [except as provided in subdivision two of section 510.50  of  this
 chapter  regarding  a  failure to appear,] shall direct the defendant to
 appear or issue a bench warrant to a police officer  or  an  appropriate
 peace  officer  directing  him or her to take the defendant into custody
 and bring the defendant before  the  court  without  unnecessary  delay;
 provided,  however,  that  under  no circumstances shall a defendant who
 requires treatment for opioid use be deemed to have violated  a  release
 condition  on  the  basis  of  his  or  her  participation  in medically
 prescribed drug treatments under the care of a health care  professional
 licensed  or  certified  under  title eight of the education law, acting
 within his or her lawful scope of practice. The [relevant] provisions of
 SUBDIVISION ONE OF section 530.60 of this chapter relating to  [issuance
 of  securing  orders]  REVOCATION OF RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL shall apply to
 such proceedings under this subdivision.
  § 30. Section 410.60 of the criminal  procedure  law,  as  amended  by
 section  23 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended to

 with  be  brought  before  the  court that imposed the sentence. Where a
 A. 5992  23
 
 violation of probation petition and report has been filed and the person
 has not been taken into custody  nor  has  a  warrant  been  issued,  an
 initial  court  appearance  shall  occur within ten business days of the
 court's  issuance  of  a  notice  to appear. If the court has reasonable
 cause to believe that such  person  has  violated  a  condition  of  the
 sentence,  it may commit such person to the custody of the sheriff[,] OR
 fix bail[, release such person under non-monetary conditions] or release
 such person on such person's own recognizance for future appearance at a
 hearing to be held in accordance with section 410.70 of this article. If
 the court does not have reasonable cause to believe that such person has
 violated a condition of the sentence, it must direct that such person be
 released.
  § 31. Subdivision 3 of section 620.50 of the criminal  procedure  law,
 as  amended by section 24 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019,
 is amended to read as follows:

 written consent thereto;
  (b) If the bail is not posted, or if though posted it is not  approved
 by  the  court, the witness must, as provided in subdivision [two] THREE
 of section 510.40 of this part, be committed to the custody of the sher-
 iff.
