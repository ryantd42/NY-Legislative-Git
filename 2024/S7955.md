 AN ACT to authorize the widow of Peter  Sistrom  to  file  a  retirement
  option election form on behalf of her deceased husband
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of any  general  or  special
 law,  rule  or  regulation  to the contrary, Peter Sistrom, who was last
 employed by the metropolitan transportation authority and had over twen-
 ty-eight years of public service credited in  the  New  York  state  and
 local  employees'  retirement system and exceeded the age of sixty-five,
 shall be deemed eligible for a service retirement benefit, notwithstand-
 ing the fact that he died on September 10, 2021. On or before  one  year
 from  the  effective  date of this act, the spouse of Peter Sistrom, may
 file with the retirement system an application  for  service  retirement
 benefits on behalf of Peter Sistrom with an effective date of retirement
 of  September  9,  2021  and an option election form electing to receive
 retirement benefits pursuant to the terms of the  joint  allowance  full
 option  with Peter Sistrom's spouse as the beneficiary. Once such appli-
 cation is received, any rights or benefits payable  to  Peter  Sistrom's
 spouse  shall  be  retroactive  to  September  9,  2021. The filing of a
 service retirement application will constitute a waiver of any rights or
 benefits to the ordinary death benefit  payable  upon  the  death  of  a
 member  in  service pursuant to section 508 or 606 of the retirement and
 social security law.  Any amounts paid by the New York state  and  local
 employees' retirement system as the result of the death of Peter Sistrom
 prior  to  the  filing  of  the request for a service retirement benefit
 pursuant to this section shall be deducted from the pension reserve  and
 the  pension payable thereafter shall be the actuarial equivalent of the
 pension reserve as so reduced.
  § 2. All past service costs associated with the implementation of this
 act shall be borne by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 7955  2
 
  This bill would deem deceased member Peter Sistrom eligible to receive
 a  service  retirement  benefit  effective  September  9,  2021.  Peter
 Sistrom's spouse shall be authorized to file for this service retirement
 benefit  with an option election form electing to receive a joint allow-
 ance full option. Upon filing of the service application, all rights and
 benefits  to the ordinary death benefits the beneficiary would otherwise
 be entitled to receive will be waived. Any payments received  from  such
 ordinary  death benefit will be deducted from the benefits payable under
 this legislation.
  If this bill is enacted during the  2023  legislative  session,  there
 will  be  an  immediate past service cost of approximately $1.01 million
 which will be borne by the Metropolitan Transportation  Authority  as  a
 one-time  payment.  This  estimate  assumes that payment will be made on
 February 1, 2024.
