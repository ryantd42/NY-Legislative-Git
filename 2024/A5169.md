  23.  "RISK  AND  NEEDS  ASSESSMENT"  MEANS A RISK AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT
 INSTRUMENT, APPROVED BY THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE  OF  THE  UNIFIED
 COURT  SYSTEM.  SUCH  APPROVED ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT SHALL BE OBJECTIVE,
 STANDARDIZED AND DEVELOPED BASED ON ANALYSIS OF EMPIRICAL DATA AND  RISK
 FACTORS  RELEVANT TO THE PRINCIPAL'S DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY AND RISK OF
 FAILURE OF A PRINCIPAL TO APPEAR. SUCH  APPROVED  ASSESSMENT  INSTRUMENT
 SHALL  NOT  BE  DISCRIMINATORY  BASED ON RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN, SEX, ANY
 OTHER PROTECTED CLASS OR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS.
  § 2. Section 510.10 of the  criminal  procedure  law,  as  amended  by
 section  2  of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, subdivision 1

 § 510.10 Securing order; when required; alternatives available; standard
  to be applied.
  1.  When  a  principal,  whose  future  court attendance at a criminal
 action or proceeding is or may be required, comes under the control of a

 ELIGIBLE PRINCIPAL AND SUCH COURT SHALL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE  RISK  AND
 NEEDS  ASSESSMENT,  BUT SUCH ASSESSMENT SHALL NOT BE THE SOLE DETERMINA-
 TIVE FACTOR, FOR THE  PURPOSE  OF  DETERMINING  WHETHER  SUCH  PRINCIPAL
 SHOULD  BE  RELEASED  on  the principal's own recognizance, [release the
 principal] RELEASED under non-monetary conditions, or, where authorized,
 fix bail or commit the principal to the custody of the sheriff.  In  all
 such  cases,  except where another type of securing order is shown to be
 required by law, the court shall release the principal pending trial  on
 the  principal's own recognizance, unless [it is] THE RISK NEEDS ASSESS-
 MENT HAS demonstrated and the court [makes  an  individualized  determi-
 nation]  DETERMINES  that  the principal IS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY OR
 poses a risk of flight to avoid prosecution. If such a finding  SPECIFIC
 TO  RISK  OF  FLIGHT TO AVOID PROSECUTION is made, the court must select
 the least restrictive alternative and condition or conditions that  will
 reasonably  assure  the  principal's  return to court.  The court shall
 explain its choice of release, release with conditions, bail  or  remand
 on the record or in writing. In making its determination, the court must
 consider  and  take into account available information about the princi-
 pal, including:
  (a) The principal's activities and history;
  (b) If the principal is a defendant, the charges facing the principal;
  (c) The principal's criminal conviction record if any;
  (d) The principal's record of  previous  adjudication  as  a  juvenile
 delinquent,  as  retained  pursuant to section 354.1 of the family court
 act, or, of pending cases where fingerprints are  retained  pursuant  to
 section 306.1 of such act, or a youthful offender, if any;
  (e)  The  principal's  previous record with respect to flight to avoid
 criminal prosecution;
  (f) If monetary bail is authorized, according to the restrictions  set
 forth in this title, the principal's individual financial circumstances,
 and,  in cases where bail is authorized, the principal's ability to post
 bail without posing undue hardship, as well as his  or  her  ability  to
 obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond;
  (g) Any violation by the principal of an order of protection issued by
 any court;
  (h) The principal's history of use or possession of a firearm;
  (i)  Whether  the  charge is alleged to have caused serious harm to an
 individual or group of individuals; and
  (j) If the principal is a defendant, in the case of an application for
 a securing order pending appeal, the merit  or  lack  of  merit  of  the
 appeal.
  2.  A  principal  is  entitled to representation by counsel under this
 chapter in preparing an application for release, when a  securing  order
 is  being  considered  and  when  a securing order is being reviewed for
 modification, revocation or termination. If the principal is financially
 unable to obtain counsel, counsel shall be assigned to the principal.
  3. [In cases other than as  described  in  subdivision  four  of  this
 section the court shall release the principal pending trial on the prin-
 cipal's  own  recognizance,  unless  the court finds on the record or in
 writing that release  on  the  principal's  own  recognizance  will  not
 reasonably  assure  the  principal's return to court. In such instances,
 the court shall release the  principal  under  non-monetary  conditions,
 selecting  the  least  restrictive  alternative and conditions that will
 reasonably assure the principal's  return  to  court.  The  court  shall
 explain  its  choice  of  alternative and conditions on the record or in
 writing.

  4. Where the principal stands charged with a qualifying  offense,  the
 court, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may in its discretion release
 the principal pending trial on the principal's own recognizance or under
 non-monetary  conditions,  fix  bail, or, where the defendant is charged
 with  a  qualifying  offense which is a felony, the court may commit the

 wise  require bail or remand, a defendant may, at any time, request that
 the court set bail in a nominal amount requested by the defendant in the

 court shall set such bail in such amount.
  [6.]  4.  When  a securing order is revoked or otherwise terminated in
 the course of an uncompleted action or proceeding  but  the  principal's
 future court attendance still is or may be required and the principal is

 TO THE COMMUNITY. In determining that matter, the court [must], IN ADDI-
 TION TO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RISK AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT  CONDUCTED  BY
 THE  APPLICABLE COUNTY PRE-TRIAL SERVICES AGENCY, on the basis of avail-
 able information, consider and take into account information  about  the

 obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond;
  (g) any violation by the principal of an order of protection issued by
 any court;

 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:

 release  or  monitoring by a pretrial services agency, shall be promptly
 made available to the principal and the principal's counsel upon  [writ-
 ten]  request.  [Any  such blank form questionnaire, instrument or tool]
 ANY SUCH BLANK RISK AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT  regularly  used  in
 the county for such purpose or a related purpose shall be made available
