 financially responsible for a victim of domestic  violence  shall  reim-
 burse  a  residential  program  for victims of domestic violence for the
 costs of emergency shelter and services provided to such victim  at  the
 daily  reimbursement  rate  established by the department reduced by any
 other reimbursement available for such costs. PROVIDED HOWEVER, IF EMER-

 sixteen, any married person or any parent  accompanied  by  his  or  her
 minor  child  or  children  in  situations  in which such person or such
 person's child is a victim OR AN ALLEGED VICTIM of an  act  which  would
