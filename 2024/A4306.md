 Introduced  by  M.  of A. PAULIN, BURDICK, SIMON, COLTON, STECK, THIELE,
  FAHY -- read once and  referred  to  the  Committee  on  Environmental
  Conservation
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the environmental conservation law and the tax law, in
  relation to establishing a carbon dioxide emissions price for electric
  generation from carbon-based fuel and creating a carbon dioxide  emis-
  sions fund
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature here-
 by finds and declares that:
  1. As part of the 2020 state budget, the legislature passed the accel-
 erated renewable energy growth and  community  benefit  act  to  advance
 renewable  energy  siting  and establish tools for achieving the nation-
 leading climate change goals of the  climate  leadership  and  community
 protection act (CLCPA).
  2. a. The CLCPA passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Cuomo
 in 2019 codified into law the following requirements:
  i. 70% of electricity delivered in New York state must be derived from
 renewable resources by 2030;
  ii. 100% of the electricity consumed in New York state must be derived
 from zero-emissions resources by 2040;
  iii. 9,000 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind installed by 2035;
  iv. 6,000 MW of distributed solar energy resources installed by 2025;
  v. 3,000 MW of energy storage installed by 2030; and
  vi. Reducing building end-use energy consumption by 185 trillion Brit-
 ish thermal units by 2025.
  b.  The  CLCPA created a 22-member climate action council to establish
 an implementation plan for how the state will achieve these goals.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  3. The CLCPA amended the environmental conservation law  by  adding  a
 new  section  75-0113  to  establish  a social cost of carbon for use by
 state agencies.
  4.  Entities  other  than  state agencies have been considering how to
 account for the value of carbon  dioxide  emissions  in  their  business
 plans and operations in light of the CLCPA and the accelerated renewable
 energy  growth and community benefit act. For example, the federally-de-
 signated electric bulk system operator in New York state has developed a
 proposal to introduce a carbon pricing mechanism  into  the  competitive
 wholesale  electricity  markets.  Encouraging  the  incorporation of the
 social cost of carbon established under the CLCPA into a carbon price by
 entities beyond state agencies would facilitate programs to  incorporate
 the  social  cost  of  carbon  in energy and other sectors of New York's
 economy that emit greenhouse gases.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 75-0113 of the  environmental  conserva-
 tion  law,  as  added  by chapter 106 of the laws of 2019, is amended to
 read as follows:
  1. No later than one year after the effective date  of  this  article,
 the  department, in consultation with the New York state energy research
 and development authority, shall establish a social cost of  carbon  for
 use by state agencies, AND SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CARBON PRICING
 MECHANISM  PROGRAMS IN NEW YORK STATE, expressed in terms of dollars per
 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.
  § 3. The tax law is amended by adding a new article 12-B  to  read  as
 follows:
  ARTICLE 12-B
 CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS PRICE FOR ELECTRIC GENERATION FROM CARBON-BASED
  FUEL
 SECTION 289-G. DEFINITIONS.
  289-H. DETERMINATION  AND ESTABLISHMENT OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMIS-
  SIONS PRICE.
  289-I. CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FUND.
  289-J. REGULATIONS.
  § 289-G. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE, THE  FOLLOWING
 TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  1.  "CARBON-BASED  FUEL"  MEANS  COAL, NATURAL GAS, RENEWABLE BIOMASS,
 PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND ANY OTHER PRODUCT  THAT  EMITS  CARBON  DIOXIDE,
 METHANE,  NITROUS  OXIDE,  OR OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES WHEN COMBUSTED, AND
 THAT IS USED FOR FUEL FOR THE PURPOSES OF PRODUCING ELECTRIC ENERGY.
  2. "CARBON-GENERATED ELECTRICITY" MEANS ELECTRIC ENERGY PRODUCED USING
 A CARBON-BASED FUEL.
  3. "CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT" MEANS A UNIT OF  MEASURE  DENOTING  THE
 AMOUNT  OF  EMISSIONS  FROM A GREENHOUSE GAS, EXPRESSED AS THE AMOUNT OF
 CARBON DIOXIDE BY WEIGHT THAT PRODUCES THE SAME GLOBAL WARMING IMPACT.
  4. "CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS PRICE" MEANS A  PRICE  THAT  INCORPORATES
 THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
 CONSERVATION PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 75-0113 OF THE ENVI-
 RONMENTAL  CONSERVATION  LAW  ON  EACH TON OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENCY
 EMITTED IN THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRIC ENERGY.
  § 289-H. DETERMINATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF CARBON  DIOXIDE  EMISSIONS
 PRICE.  1. THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION SHALL DETERMINE
 AND ESTABLISH A CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS PRICE.  THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVI-
 RONMENTAL CONSERVATION MAY ALSO OBTAIN  INFORMATION  NECESSARY  FOR  THE
 DETERMINATION  OF  THE PRICE FROM OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL AGENCIES OR THE
 FEDERALLY DESIGNATED ELECTRIC BULK SYSTEM OPERATOR.
