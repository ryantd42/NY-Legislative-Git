  § 1950. Establishment of [boards of cooperative educational  services]
 NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTES  pending  the  creation  of  intermediate
 districts. 1. The boards of education and school trustees of a  supervi-
 sory  district which is not part of an intermediate district, meeting at
 a time and place to be designated  by  the  district  superintendent  of
 schools,  may,  by  a majority vote of their members present and voting,
 file with the commissioner of education a petition for the establishment
 of a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE for the purpose of carrying out a  program  of  shared  educational
 services  in  the  schools of the supervisory district and for providing
 instruction in such special subjects as the  commissioner  may  approve.
 The  commissioner,  by  order, may establish such [a board] AN INSTITUTE
 with membership of not less than five nor more than fifteen,  upon  such
 application  and  when a vacancy occurs in the office of district super-
 intendent of schools shall establish such [a board] AN INSTITUTE, unless
 the commissioner shall issue an order  pursuant  to  section  twenty-two
 hundred  one  OF  THIS CHAPTER redistricting the county so as to provide
 for a lesser number  of  supervisory  districts.  The  commissioner,  by
 order,  may  authorize [a board] AN INSTITUTE, established prior to July
 second, nineteen hundred sixty-five, to increase its membership  to  not
 less than five nor more than fifteen.
  2.  Upon  the  establishment  by the commissioner of such [a board] AN
 INSTITUTE, boards of education and school trustees, by a  vote  pursuant
 to subdivision two-a of this section shall elect [a board of cooperative
 educational  services]  THE  MEMBERS  OF THE NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
 Except for elections conducted pursuant to  subdivision  two-a  of  this
 section,  and the adoption of a public resolution regarding the approval
 or disapproval  of  the  tentative  administrative  budget  pursuant  to
 subparagraph  five  of  paragraph b of subdivision four of this section,
 component districts having more than five  board  of  education  members
 shall  be  limited to five votes on any matters relating to the district
 superintendency or  [board  of  cooperative  educational  services]  THE
 MEMBERS  OF  THE  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE. A full term shall be three
 years to serve from July first next following election. It shall be  the
 A. 9760  4
 
 duty  of  such  meeting by order of such meeting to divide into a suffi-
 cient number of classes the terms of the members of the [board of  coop-
 erative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE so that as
 nearly  as  possible  an equal number of members shall be elected to the
 board each year. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  subdivi-
 sion,  upon  the decrease of the full term of members from five to three
 years, the [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE shall direct that one or more members be elected for a term of
 one,  two  or four years in order to assure, as nearly as possible, that
 an equal number of members will be elected to the [board] INSTITUTE each
 year. Members of such [board] INSTITUTE shall be reimbursed  for  neces-
 sary  expenses  for attending meetings of such [boards] INSTITUTES.  The
 district superintendent shall be the executive officer  of  the  [board]
 INSTITUTE,  and  where  a [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE comprises two or more supervisory districts  the
 district  superintendents,  together with the president of the [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, shall  act
 as an executive committee.
  2-a.  a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, commencing on and
 after the first day of  November,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-three,  the
 members  of a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNI-
 CAL INSTITUTE shall be elected in accordance with the provisions of this
 subdivision.
  b. Not later than the first day of February of each year the president
 of the [board of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  shall  designate  a single date on or after the sixteenth day
 and on or before the thirtieth day of  April  on  which  each  component
 board,  other  than  the  board  of  education  of a central high school
 district, shall conduct a public meeting  which  may  be  a  regular  or
 special  meeting,  for  the purpose of electing members of the [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and  adopt-
 ing  a  public  resolution concerning the approval or disapproval of the
 tentative administrative budget. In the case of a  central  high  school
 district,  such public meeting shall be held on the regular business day
 next following the date designated by the president  of  the  [board  of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE. Nomination
 of  a  person  to  be  elected  [to  a  board of cooperative educational
 services] AS A MEMBER OF A NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall be  made  by
 at  least  one  component  district by board resolution. Such resolution
 shall be transmitted in writing to the clerk of the  [board  of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE at least thirty
 days prior to the date of the election as designated by the president of
 the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTI-
 TUTE.  No  nomination of a person to be elected [to a board of cooper-
 ative educational services] AS A MEMBER OF A NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 from a component district which currently has a resident serving [on] AS
 A  MEMBER  OF  such  [board]  INSTITUTE  shall  be  accepted unless such
 member's office is to expire at the end of the current year, unless  the
 [size]  NUMBER  OF MEMBERS of such [board]  INSTITUTE exceeds the number
 of component  school  districts  or  unless  an  unrepresented  district
 declines  to  make  a  nomination. For purposes of this subdivision, any
 such person or [board] INSTITUTE  member  nominated  by  a  special  act
 school district, a central high school district or any district which is
 a component of a central high school district shall be deemed a resident
 of  the  district that nominated him or her only.  Furthermore, it shall
 be the duty of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLY-
 A. 9760  5
 
 TECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  to encourage the nomination of persons residing in
 component districts not  currently  represented  [on]  IN  such  [board]
 INSTITUTE.  The  clerk shall include the name and address of each person
 nominated  on  the  election ballot to be distributed in accordance with
 paragraph c of this subdivision.
  c. Members of the [boards  of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES shall be elected by resolution of the component
 boards  on  a  ballot prepared by the clerk of the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE. Such ballot  shall  be
 mailed  to  each component district no later than fourteen days prior to
 the date designated as the day of the election by the president  of  the
 [board  of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
 Each component district shall be entitled to one vote  for  each  vacant
 office  to  be  filled. A component board [may] SHALL not cast more than
 one vote for any candidate. The candidates receiving a plurality of  the
 votes  cast for the several offices shall be elected, provided, however,
 that no more than one person residing in a particular component district
 may be elected to serve as a member of a [board  of  cooperative  educa-
 tional  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  at  one time unless the
 number of [seats on such board] MEMBERS OF SUCH  INSTITUTE  exceeds  the
 number  of  component  districts  or  unless  an  unrepresented district
 declines to make a nomination, provided further that a person  nominated
 by  a  special  act school district, a central high school district or a
 component of a central high school district shall be deemed  a  resident
 of  the  nominating  district only for this purpose. Where more than one
 position is to be filled by such election and there is a variance in the
 length of the terms for which such offices are to be filled  as  author-
 ized by this subdivision, or one or more persons are to be elected for a
 full  term  or  terms  and one or more persons are to be elected for the
 unexpired portion of a term or terms, or both, the  candidate  receiving
 the  greatest  number of votes shall be entitled to the longest term and
 candidates receiving the next highest number of votes,  to  the  several
 offices  in  decreasing  order  of the length of such terms or unexpired
 portions of such terms. Each component school  district  shall  mail  or
 deliver  its  completed ballot to the clerk of the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE no later than one busi-
 ness day after the election.
  d. In the event that more eligible persons than the  number  remaining
 to  be  elected  receive  an equal number of votes sufficient that fewer
 persons receiving such number of votes would be elected,  the  president
 of  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE shall call a run-off election to be  conducted  in  accordance
 with the provisions of paragraph c of this subdivision and to be held on
 a  date  within  twenty  days  of the initial vote. The only persons who
 shall be deemed nominated for such run-off election shall be the  candi-
 dates  who  have  received such equal number of votes. In the event that
 equal numbers of votes are received by eligible candidates  for  offices
 with  a  variance  in the length of the term of office but the number of
 votes received by such candidates is sufficient to  elect  each  of  the
 candidates [to the board of cooperative educational services] AS MEMBERS
 OF  THE  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, the candidates receiving such equal
 number of votes shall draw lots to determine who of them shall fill each
 such office.
  e. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  subdivision  to  the
 contrary,  in  the event a component school district will be transferred
 to a new supervisory district as of July first next succeeding the  date
 A. 9760  6
 
 designated  for  the annual election of the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] MEMBERS OF THE NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,  and  such
 component  district, as of April fifteenth of the current year, does not
 have a resident who is a member of the [board of cooperative educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  of  the supervisory district of
 which it is a component in the current  year,  such  component  district
 shall  be eligible to nominate candidates and vote in the annual [board]
 election of the [boards of cooperative educational services] MEMBERS  OF
 THE  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES to which the component district will be
 transferred, as if such transfer had already occurred.
  f. In the event of a vacancy in the membership of a [board of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, such [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  may  fill
 such  vacancy  by appointment, provided that notification be provided to
 all component boards of such vacancy and that the component  boards  are
 given  ten  days  to  provide any comments and/or objections to fill the
 vacancy by appointment, and the person so appointed  shall  hold  office
 until  the next annual election of the [board of cooperative educational
 services] MEMBERS OF THE NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
  2-b. Where the commissioner of education has established or  hereafter
 establishes a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNI-
 CAL INSTITUTE for the purpose of carrying out a program of shared educa-
 tional services in the schools of two or more supervisory districts, the
 commissioner  may  by  order  designate  the  number  of members of such
 [board] INSTITUTE which shall not  be  less  than  five  nor  more  than
 fifteen,  or may by order increase the number of members of such [board]
 INSTITUTE to a maximum of fifteen or decrease the number of members to a
 minimum of five. Except for elections conducted pursuant to  subdivision
 two-a of this section, and the adoption of a public resolution regarding
 the  approval  or  disapproval  of  the  tentative administrative budget
 pursuant to subparagraph five of paragraph b of subdivision four of this
 section, component districts having more than five  board  of  education
 members  shall  be  limited to five votes on any matters relating to the
 district superintendency or [board of cooperative educational  services]
 MEMBERSHIP OF THE NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
  Boards  of  education  and school trustees, shall elect the members of
 such [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE pursuant to subdivision two-a of this section. A full term shall be
 three years to serve from July first next following election.  It  shall
 be  the  duty  of such meeting by order of such meeting to divide into a
 sufficient number of classes the terms of the members of the  [board  of
 cooperative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE so that as
 nearly as possible an equal number of members shall be  elected  to  the
 board  each  year.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivi-
 sion, upon the decrease of the full term of members from five  to  three
 years,  the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE shall direct that one or more members be elected for a term of
 one, two or four years in order to assure, as nearly as  possible,  that
 an equal number of members will be elected to the [board] INSTITUTE each
 year.  Members  of [boards of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTES shall be  reimbursed  for  necessary  expenses  for
 attending  meetings of such [board] INSTITUTE. Where the [board of coop-
 erative educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  MEMBERSHIP
 comprises  two  or  more supervisory districts, the district superinten-
 dents, together with the president of the [board of  cooperative  educa-
 A. 9760  7

 tional  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, shall act as an executive
 committee.
  3.  The  [boards of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTES in any two or more supervisory districts may cooperate in the
 provision of any of the services authorized by subdivision four of  this
 section.  In  such cases, the district superintendents of the respective
 supervisory districts shall serve as an executive committee to carry out
 the decision of the [boards  of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTES  in their respective districts. Agreements may
 be made by such  [boards]  INSTITUTES  arranging  for  such  cooperative
 services  on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon and provid-
 ing the method of allocation of the cost thereof. Such agreements may be
 made for such period as may be approved by the commissioner but  not  to
 exceed ten years. The terms of such agreement shall be binding upon such
 [boards]  INSTITUTES and their component districts for the period speci-
 fied in such agreement.
  4. [The board of cooperative educational services] A NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE shall have the power and duty to:
  a.  (1)  Appoint  a  district  superintendent of schools in the manner
 provided in section twenty-two hundred four of this chapter, and in  its
 discretion  to  provide  for  the payment of supplementary salary to the
 district superintendent of schools by the supervisory district. The term
 of any employment contract or agreement between a  district  superinten-
 dent  and the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNI-
 CAL INSTITUTE that is entered into or amended on or after the  effective
 date  of  this  subparagraph  shall  not  exceed  three years. Copies of
 employment contracts and  amendments  to  such  contracts  entered  into
 pursuant  to  this paragraph shall be filed with the commissioner within
 five days of execution.
  (2) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision  of  law  in  no  event
 shall  the total salary including amounts paid pursuant to section twen-
 ty-two hundred nine of this chapter for district superintendents for the
 two thousand nineteen--two thousand twenty school year or any subsequent
 school year exceed: (i) one hundred six percent of the salary cap appli-
 cable in the preceding school year, or (ii) ninety-eight percent of that
 earned by the commissioner in the two  thousand  thirteen--two  thousand
 fourteen  state  fiscal  year,  whichever is less. In no event shall any
 district superintendent be permitted  to  accumulate  vacation  or  sick
 leave  credits  in  excess  of  the  vacation  and  sick  leave  credits
 managerial/confidential employees of the state are permitted to  accumu-
 late  pursuant  to  regulations  promulgated  by the state civil service
 commission, nor may any district superintendent at  the  time  of  sepa-
 ration from service be compensated for accrued and unused vacation cred-
 its  or  sick leave, or use accrued and unused sick leave for retirement
 service credit or to pay for health insurance in retirement, at  a  rate
 in  excess of the rate permitted to managerial/confidential employees of
 the state pursuant to regulations of the state civil service commission.
 In addition to the payment of supplementary salary, a [board of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE may provide for
 the payment of all or a portion of the cost of  insurance  benefits  for
 the  district  superintendent  of  schools, including but not limited to
 health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance or any other form
 of insurance benefit made available to managerial/confidential employees
 of the state; provided that any such  payments  for  whole  life,  split
 dollar  or  other  life  insurance policies having a cash value shall be
 included in the total salary of the district superintendent for purposes
 A. 9760  8
 
 of this subparagraph, and provided further that  any  payments  for  the
 employee  contribution,  co-pay  or  uncovered  medical expenses under a
 health insurance plan also shall be included in the total salary of  the
 district  superintendent.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law,
 payments for such insurance benefits may be based on the district super-
 intendent's total salary or the amount of his or her supplementary sala-
 ry only. Any payments for transportation or travel expenses in excess of
 actual, documented expenses incurred in the performance  of  duties  for
 the  [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE or the state, and any  other  lump  sum  payment  not  specifically
 excluded  from  total  salary  pursuant  to  this subparagraph, shall be
 included in the total salary of the district superintendent for purposes
 of this subparagraph.  Nothing herein shall prohibit a  district  super-
 intendent  from  waiving any rights provided for in an existing contract
 or agreement as hereafter prohibited in favor of revised compensation or
 benefit provisions as permitted herein. In no event shall the  terms  of
 the  district superintendent's contract, including any provisions relat-
 ing to an increase in salary, compensation or other benefits, be contin-
 gent upon the terms of any contract or collective  bargaining  agreement
 between the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  and  its  teachers  or  other employees. The commissioner may
 adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing the provisions of this
 paragraph.
  (3) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any employee
 of a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE who is appointed as the district superintendent  of  schools  shall
 vacate  his  or her prior position with the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE upon appointment as district
 superintendent, and no district superintendent shall have a contract  of
 employment with the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE other than a contract entered pursuant to this para-
 graph.
  b.  (1)  Prepare, prior to the annual meeting of members of the boards
 of education and school trustees, held as provided  in  paragraph  o  of
 this  subdivision,  a  tentative  budget of expenditures for the program
 costs, a tentative budget for capital costs, and a tentative budget  for
 the  administration  costs  of  the  [board  of  cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.  Such budgets shall  include  the
 proposed budget for the upcoming school year, the previous school year's
 actual  costs  and  the  current  school year's projected costs for each
 object of expenditure. Such program, capital and administrative  budgets
 shall  be  separately  delineated  in  accordance with the definition of
 program, capital and administrative costs which shall be promulgated  by
 the  commissioner  after consultation with school district officials and
 the director of the budget. Personal service costs for each budget shall

 and maintenance section that will include base rent  costs,  total  rent
 costs, operations and maintenance charges, cost per square foot for each
 facility  rented  or  leased  by  such [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, and any and all expenditures asso-
 ciated  with  custodial  salaries  and  benefits,  service  contracts,
 supplies,  utilities,  maintenance  and repairs for such facilities, and
 that such budget shall include the annual debt service  and  total  debt

 and  orders from administrative bodies or officers, and, to the extent a
 [board's] INSTITUTE'S administrative budget has been  adopted,  one-time
 costs  incurred  in  the  first  year  in which an employee retires. The
 administrative budget shall include, but need not be limited to,  office
 and central administrative expenses, traveling expenses and salaries and
 benefits  of supervisors and administrative personnel necessary to carry
 out the central administrative duties of the supervisory  district,  any
 and  all  expenditures associated with the [board] INSTITUTE, the office
 of district  superintendent,  general  administration,  central  support
 services, planning, and all other administrative activities. Such admin-
 istrative  budget  shall also specify the amount of supplementary salary
 and benefits, if any, which the [board] INSTITUTE determines  should  be
 paid to the district superintendent of schools and the [board] INSTITUTE
 shall  append  to  such budget a detailed statement of the total compen-
 sation to be paid the district superintendent of schools by the  [board]
 INSTITUTE,  including  a  delineation  of the salary, annualized cost of
 benefits and any in-kind or other form of remuneration to be paid, plus,
 commencing with the presentation of the budget for the nineteen  hundred
 ninety-seven--ninety-eight  school  year,  a  list  of  items of expense
 eligible for reimbursement on expense accounts  in  the  ensuing  school
 year  and  a  statement  of  the amount of expenses paid to the district
 superintendent of schools in the prior year for purposes of carrying out
 his or her official duties.
  (2) The [board of cooperative educational services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE shall provide copies of such tentative budgets and attachments
 to  the trustees or board of education of each component school district
 of the [board of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE at least ten days prior to the annual meeting held pursuant to
 paragraph  o  of  this subdivision. Such trustees or boards of education
 shall make such budgets available to the residents of  their  respective
 school districts upon request.
  (3)  The  [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE shall comply  with  any  reasonable  requests  for  additional
 information  not  contained in such budgets which may be requested prior
 to the annual meeting held pursuant to paragraph o of this subdivision.
  (4) The [board of cooperative educational services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  shall  give public notice of the annual meeting held pursuant
 to paragraph o of this subdivision by publishing a notice once each week
 within the two weeks preceding the annual meeting held  as  provided  in
 paragraph  o  of  this subdivision, the first publication to be at least
 fourteen days before such meeting, in two newspapers if there be two, or
 in one newspaper if there shall be but one, having  general  circulation
 within  the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE. If no newspaper shall have general circulation therein,  said
 A. 9760  10
 
 notice  shall  be posted in at least twenty of the most public places in
 the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTI-
 TUTE at least fourteen days before such meeting. Such notice shall state
 that  the  tentative  budgets will be presented by the [board of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to  the  trustees
 or board of education of each component school district of the [board of
 cooperative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in attend-
 ance at such meeting. Such notice shall also include a  summary  of  the
 tentative  administrative,  capital  and  program  budgets  in  a  form
 prescribed by the commissioner. The summary of the administrative budget
 shall include, but shall not be limited to, the salary and  benefits  of
 supervisors  and  administrative  personnel of the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and the  total  compen-
 sation  payable  to  the district superintendent of schools. Such notice
 shall also indicate when a copy of the tentative budgets will be  avail-
 able  for  inspection by the public during regular business hours at one
 or more locations specified in the notice.
  (5) The trustees or  board  of  education  of  each  component  school
 district of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECH-
 NICAL  INSTITUTE  shall adopt a public resolution which shall approve or
 disapprove such tentative administrative budget at a regular or  special
 meeting  to be held within the component district on the date designated
 pursuant to subdivision two-a of this section as the date  for  election
 of  members  of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, or in the case of  the  board  of  education  of  a
 central  high school district on the regular business day next following
 such designated date.
  If the resolutions adopted by the trustees or boards of education of a
 majority of the component school districts of the [board of  cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE actually voting approve
 the  tentative  administrative  budget, the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  may  adopt  the  tentative
 administrative  budget without modification. If a majority of the compo-
 nent school districts actually voting fail to adopt resolutions  approv-
 ing  such tentative administrative budget, or if the number of component
 school districts approving  the  budget  equals  the  number  of  school
 districts disapproving the budget, the [board of cooperative educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall prepare and adopt a contin-
 gency administrative budget which shall not exceed  the  amount  of  the
 administrative budget of the [board of cooperative educational services]
 NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for the previous school year except to accom-
 modate  expenditure  increases  attributable  to supplemental retirement
 allowances payable pursuant to section five hundred thirty-two  of  this
 chapter  and section seventy-eight of the retirement and social security
 law.
  (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any component
 school district which will be transferred to a new supervisory  district
 as of July first next succeeding the date designated for the vote on the
 tentative  administrative budget shall vote on the administrative budget
 of the [board of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  to  which  it  will  be  transferred, as if such transfer had
 already occurred. Where the commissioner has issued  an  order  for  the
 merger  of  two  or  more  supervisory  districts to take effect on July
 first, in the school year immediately preceding the merger, the  [boards
 of  cooperative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES to be
 merged shall jointly prepare a program, administrative and capital budg-
 A. 9760  11
 
 et for the merged [board of cooperative educational services]  NY  POLY-
 TECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  and  shall jointly conduct a vote on the tentative
 administrative budget of the merged [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in accordance with this paragraph
 as if the merger was already in effect. In the event such a merger  does
 not  take  effect on July first, the commissioner shall be authorized to
 order the [boards of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTES  to  be merged to develop program, administrative and capital
 budgets and conduct a vote  on  administrative  budgets  in  the  manner
 prescribed  by  this section on dates other than those specified in this
 section.
  (7) Each component  school  district  shall  transmit  the  resolution
 either  approving  or disapproving the [board of cooperative educational
 services'] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE'S tentative administrative  budget
 no  later  than  one business day after the adoption of such resolution.
 The [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTI-
 TUTE  shall,  no  later  than  the fifteenth day of May, adopt the final
 program, capital and administrative budgets for the ensuing year. Except
 as provided in paragraph d of  this  subdivision,  subparagraph  (a)  of
 paragraph p of this subdivision, and subdivision one of section nineteen
 hundred fifty-one of this article, such administrative and capital budg-
 ets,  when  so  adopted,  after  deducting state aid applicable thereto,
 shall be a charge against all of the component school districts  in  the
 supervisory  district and each component school district's proportionate
 share shall be determined  by  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE according to weighted average daily
 attendance  or  according  to  true  valuation  or according to resident
 public school district enrollment as defined in paragraph n of  subdivi-
 sion  one  of section thirty-six hundred two of this chapter except that
 only one method shall be applied among  the  component  districts  of  a
 [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 in any year, unless otherwise provided by law. In a  merged  supervisory
 district  in  the  county  of  Suffolk  each component school district's
 proportionate share of such administrative and capital  budgets  may  be
 determined  according to weighted average daily attendance, according to
 true valuation, or according to using the weighted average daily attend-
 ance for a certain percentage of the  cost  and  true  valuation  for  a
 certain percentage of administrative and capital costs. Such costs, in a
 merged  supervisory  district  in  the county of Suffolk, apportioned by
 using weighted average daily attendance  and  true  valuation  shall  be
 subject to adjustment by the [board of cooperative educational services]
 NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  in  a manner that will minimize the annual
 change in costs for the greatest number  of  component  districts.  Such
 percentages  shall  be  established  by the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE upon  the  approval  of  the
 component  districts  subject to the final approval of the commissioner.
 It is further provided that such administrative budget approved  by  the
 [board]  INSTITUTE  shall  be  subject  to review by the commissioner to
 determine: (i) the level of administrative savings achieved by the merg-
 er and (ii) if such administrative savings equals or exceeds  the  level
 identified  by  the merger planning task force appointed by the district
 superintendent. If the [board of cooperative  educational  services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE determines to change the method of apportioning
 administrative costs and capital expenses  from  that  followed  in  the
 previous  year,  such  determination  may  be made only if the [board of
 cooperative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  has
 A. 9760  12
 
 conducted  a  hearing  at  a  regular or special meeting of such [board]
 INSTITUTE which all members of boards of education and  school  trustees
 have  been  invited  to  attend, such hearing to be held at least thirty
 days  prior  to the annual meeting of members of boards of education and
 school trustees. In the Putnam/North Westchester [board  of  cooperative
 educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,  each  component
 district's proportionate share of such administrative and capital  budg-
 ets  may  also be determined by using the weighted average daily attend-
 ance for a certain percentage and  the  true  valuation  for  a  certain
 percentage. Such percentages shall be applied according to clause (i) of
 this subparagraph.
  (i)  The  three methods of apportionment of administrative and capital
 expenses are as follows: (1) in accordance  with  the  ratio  which  the
 component  school  district's  total full or true valuation in effect at
 the time of the adoption of the budget bears to the total true  or  full
 valuation  of all of the component school districts within the [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,  (2)  by
 dividing the total amount of such administrative and capital expenses by
 the  total  weighted  average daily attendance of pupils residing in all
 component school districts contained within the  [board  of  cooperative
 educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and attending a public
 school and multiplying by the weighted average daily attendance of  such
 resident  pupils  in  each  of the component school districts, or (3) by
 dividing the total amount of such administrative and capital expenses by
 the total resident public school district enrollment  of  all  component
 school  districts contained within the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and  multiplying  by  the  resident
 public  school district enrollment of the component school districts. In
 addition, in a merged supervisory district in  the  county  of  Suffolk,
 where  a combination of the first and second methods could be applied as
 provided in the opening paragraph of this subparagraph may be  utilized.
 In  the  Putnam/North  Westchester  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, where a combination of  the  first
 and  second  methods  is  utilized,  the  percentages  shall  be used as
 follows: for the two thousand five-two thousand six school year,  ninety
 percent  using true valuation and ten percent using the weighted average
 daily attendance; for the two thousand  six-two  thousand  seven  school
 year,  eighty  percent using true valuation and twenty percent using the
 weighted average daily attendance; for the two thousand seven-two  thou-
 sand  eight school year, seventy percent using true valuation and thirty
 percent using the weighted average daily attendance; for the  two  thou-
 sand eight-two thousand nine school year, sixty percent using true valu-
 ation and forty percent using the weighted average daily attendance; and
 for  the  two  thousand nine-two thousand ten school year and any school
 year thereafter, fifty percent using true valuation  and  fifty  percent
 using the weighted average daily attendance.
  (ii) If the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNI-
 CAL  INSTITUTE  chooses  to  apportion  administrative costs and capital
 expenses according to full or true valuation, special  school  districts
 authorized  to receive state aid in accordance with chapter five hundred
 sixty-six of the laws of nineteen hundred sixty-seven, as amended, shall
 have their full value for purposes of this section computed by multiply-
 ing the resident weighted average daily attendance by the state  average
 full valuation per pupil as established by the commissioner for the year
 in which the budget is adopted. The school authorities of each component
 school  district  shall  add such amount to the budget of such component
 A. 9760  13
 
 districts and shall pay such amount to the treasurer of  the  [board  of
 cooperative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and shall
 be paid out by the treasurer upon the orders of the  [board  of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  issued  and
 executed in pursuance of a resolution of said [board] INSTITUTE.
  c. Make or cause to be made surveys to determine the need for  cooper-
 ative  educational  services in the supervisory district and present the
 findings of their surveys to local school authorities.  Each  [board  of
 cooperative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  shall
 prepare long range program plans, including special education and career
 education program plans, to meet the projected need for such cooperative
 educational services in the supervisory district for the next five years
 as may be specified by the commissioner, and shall keep on file and make
 available for public inspection and  review  by  the  commissioner  such
 plans  and  thereafter  annual  revisions of such plans on or before the
 first day of December of each year, provided  that  such  plans  may  be
 incorporated into a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE district-wide comprehensive plan.
  d.  (1)  Aidable  shared  services. At the request of component school
 districts, and with the approval of the commissioner, provide any of the
 following services on a cooperative basis: school nurse teacher, attend-
 ance supervisor, supervisor of teachers, dental hygienist, psychologist,
 teachers of art, music, physical education, career  education  subjects,
 guidance  counsellors,  operation  of  special classes for students with
 disabilities, as such term is defined in  article  eighty-nine  of  this
 chapter;  pupil  and financial accounting service by means of mechanical
 equipment; maintenance and operation of cafeteria or restaurant  service
 for  the  use  of  pupils  and  teachers while at school, and such other
 services as the commissioner may approve. Such cafeteria  or  restaurant
 service  may  be  used by the community for school related functions and
 activities and  to  furnish  meals  to  the  elderly  residents  of  the
 district,  sixty years of age or older. Utilization by elderly residents
 or school related groups shall be subject to the approval of  the  board
 of  education.  Charges  shall  be sufficient to bear the direct cost of
 preparation and serving of such meals, exclusive of any other  available
 reimbursements.
  (2)  Certain services prohibited. Commencing with the nineteen hundred
 ninety-seven--ninety-eight school year, the commissioner  shall  not  be
 authorized  to  approve  as  an  aidable shared service pursuant to this
 subdivision any cooperative maintenance services or municipal  services,
 including  but  not limited to, lawn mowing services and heating, venti-
 lation or air conditioning repair or maintenance or trash collection, or
 any other municipal services as defined  by  the  commissioner.  On  and
 after  the  effective date of this paragraph, the commissioner shall not
 approve, as an aidable shared service, any new  cooperative  maintenance
 or  municipal services for the nineteen hundred ninety-six--ninety-seven
 school year, provided that the commissioner may approve the continuation
 of such services for one year if provided in the nineteen hundred  nine-
 ty-five--ninety-six  school year. No service provided to an out-of-state
 school district pursuant to subparagraph ten  of  paragraph  h  of  this
 subdivision shall be eligible for aid.
  (2-a)  Cost effectiveness of instructional and non-instructional tech-
 nology. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  this  section  to  the
 contrary, expenditures incurred pursuant to purchase and/or installation
 contracts  entered into on or after January fifteenth, two thousand, for
 A. 9760  14
 
 the following categories of instructional and non-instructional technol-
 ogy purchase and installation:
  (i) computer equipment,
  (ii) conduits,
  (iii) wiring,
  (iv) powering and testing of hardware installations,
  (v)  all costs associated with lease or purchase of local or wide area
 network hardware located on district property, and
  (vi) incidental costs for original purchase and installation of  hard-
 ware,  including  installation  of  basic  operating  systems  software
 required for hardware testing, shall not be considered an aidable shared
 service unless the component school district is able to demonstrate that
 such shared service would be more cost-effective than would otherwise be
 possible if such services were to be purchased without  the  involvement
 of a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE.  Any aid that may be payable for such shared service pursuant to
 subdivision five of this section shall be excluded in the  demonstration
 and  determination  of  cost-effectiveness  and cost savings pursuant to
 this subdivision. The commissioner  shall  issue  guidelines  to  advise
 component school districts in their determination of cost-effectiveness.
 Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  if  a component school
 district determines that any instructional and  non-instructional  tech-
 nology  purchase  and installation from the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE are not cost  effective,  as
 determined  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  the commissioner shall, upon
 request, assist the school district to enter into a cooperative  service
 agreement  (CO-SER)  with  another  [BOCES]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE,
 which is cost effective in the provision of  such  technology  purchases
 and installations.
  (3)  Requests  for  shared  services; operating plan; required notice.
 Requests for such shared services shall be  filed  by  component  school
 districts  with the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE not later than the first day  of  February  of  each
 year,  provided  that such requests shall not be binding upon the compo-
 nent school district. The [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall submit its proposed annual operating  plan
 for  the  ensuing  school  year to the department for approval not later
 than the fifteenth day of February of each year. Such [board]  INSTITUTE
 shall,  through  its  executive  officer,  notify  each component school
 district on or before the tenth day of  March  concerning  the  services
 which  have  been  approved by the commissioner to be made available for
 the ensuing school year. Such notice shall set forth the  local  uniform
 cost of each such service, based on (i) anticipated participation in the
 ensuing school year, or (ii) participation in the current year, or (iii)
 a two or three year average including participation in the current year,
 which  unit  cost  shall  be  the  same  for all participating component
 districts and shall be based upon a uniform methodology approved annual-
 ly by at least three-quarters  of  the  participating  component  school
 districts  after  consultation  by  local  school  officials  with their
 respective boards; provided, however, such unit cost shall be subject to
 final adjustment for programs for students with  disabilities  based  on
 actual participation in accordance with regulations of the commissioner.
 Notwithstanding the determination of the local uniform unit cost method-
 ology selected in accordance with this paragraph, each [board of cooper-
 ative  education  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE shall annually
 report to the commissioner the budgeted unit cost and,  when  available,
 A. 9760  15
 
 the  actual  unit cost of such programs and services, in accordance with
 both the local uniform unit cost methodology  and  a  statewide  uniform
 unit  cost  methodology  prescribed  by  the commissioner by regulation,
 where the budgeted statewide unit cost shall be based on the anticipated
 participation  in  the  ensuing  year and the actual statewide unit cost
 shall be based on actual participation through the end of each year.
  (4) Contracts for shared services; allocation of costs. Each component
 school district shall on or before the first day of May  following  such
 notification  notify  the [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE of  its  intention  to  participate  or  not  to
 participate in such shared services and the specific services which such
 district elects to utilize. Each participating component school district
 shall be required to pay the [board of cooperative educational services]
 NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  for  the cost of the services set forth in
 such notification, except for adjustments caused by subsequent  unantic-
 ipated  changes  in the district's enrollment. The [board of cooperative
 educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  shall  enter  into
 contracts  with  its  component  school  districts  for  such  requested
 services. A copy of each executed contract for  such  purpose  shall  be
 filed  with  the  commissioner  by the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE on or prior to  the  first  day  of
 August  of  each  year. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph b of
 this subdivision, any component school district which does not elect  to
 participate  in  any such specific cooperative services authorized under
 this paragraph shall not be required to pay  any  share  of  the  moneys
 provided  in  the  budget  as  salaries  of  teachers or other personnel
 employed in providing such service, for equipment and supplies for  such
 service or for transportation of pupils to and from the place where such
 service  is  maintained. Provided, further, that a [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE may allocate  the  cost
 of  such services to component school districts in accordance with terms
 agreed upon between such [board] INSTITUTE  and  three-quarters  of  the
 boards of education and trustees of local school districts participating
 in the service.
  (5)  Operating  plan  and  budget;  unanticipated shared services. The
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 shall  submit  to the commissioner on or before the first day of June an
 operating plan and budget based upon the request for services  which  it
 has  received from its component school districts. Such submission shall
 include the budgeted unit cost of programs and services  based  on  both
 the  local  and  the  statewide uniform unit cost methodologies for each
 program and service offered by the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE.  A [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE which receives requests  for
 unanticipated  shared  services subsequent to the adoption of its budget
 shall submit an amended operating plan including such additional  shared
 services  to  the commissioner, together with a statement from the chief
 school administrator of each school district which  has  requested  such
 services  indicating  the  availability  of  funds  in the budget of the
 school district to pay for such district's share of  the  cost  of  such
 additional  services. Such amended plan shall be submitted in the manner
 and form prescribed by regulations of the commissioner.  The  [board  of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall allo-
 cate  the  cost  of  providing such additional shared services among the
 component school districts which have requested such services, and shall
 contract with the component school districts for such services.  A  copy
 A. 9760  16
 
 of  each contract for this purpose shall be filed by the [board of coop-
 erative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  with  the
 commissioner  not  more  than  thirty days from its execution. An annual
 program  report and evaluation for each school year as prescribed by the
 commissioner, shall be submitted by the  [board  of  cooperative  educa-
 tional  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to the commissioner on or
 before the first day of September following such school year.
  e. Upon the recommendation of the district superintendent, employ such

 education  resources  than  would  be  achieved  were  such contract not
 approved. The commissioner shall issue a finding in  writing  in  making
 all determinations pursuant to this article.
  (6)  To  enter  into  contracts  with  not-for-profit  corporations to

 college, agricultural and technical college, or public  agency  for  the
 purpose  of  providing electronic data processing services to such agen-
 cies. Any such proposed contract shall be  subject  to  the  review  and
 approval  of  the  commissioner,  who  may  only  approve  such proposed
 contract when, in his opinion, such contract will not disrupt the  level
 of  services provided to component school districts and will result in a
 more economical utilization of existing  [board  of  cooperative  educa-

 commissioner shall issue a finding in writing  in  making  all  determi-
 nations pursuant to this subparagraph.
  (8)  To  enter  into  contracts with the commissioner of the office of

 ative educational service.  Services provided pursuant to such contracts
 shall  be  provided  at  cost, and the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall not be authorized  to  charge
 any  costs  incurred  in providing such services to its component school

  (6) To implement a program or service approved under this paragraph, a
 school district may transport pupils to the site of a [board of  cooper-
 ative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE program in those
 cases where a pupil otherwise would be entitled  to  transportation  but
 for  the  fact  that  the program is at the [board of cooperative educa-

 the separate identity of each such fund shall be maintained whether  its
 assets  consist  of cash or investments or both. The money in such funds

 the  general  municipal  law. The moneys so deposited shall be accounted
 for separate and apart from all other funds of the district, in the same
 manner as provided in subdivision ten of section six-c  of  the  general
 municipal  law.  The  moneys in such funds may be invested in the manner
 provided by section eleven of the general municipal  law.  Any  interest
 earned  or  capital gain realized on the money so deposited shall accrue
 and become part of such funds. Such reserve funds shall not  be  reduced
 to  amounts less than the total of the amounts estimated to be necessary
 to cover incurred but unsettled claims or suits  including  expenses  in
 connection  therewith  other  than by payments for losses for which such
 reserve amounts were established, except that such [board] NY  POLYTECH-
 NICAL INSTITUTE may authorize use of such funds other than amounts allo-
 cated  for  unsettled  claims  or suits including expenses in connection

 subsequent  losses  in  areas  previously  self-insured, in the event of
 dissolution of the self-insurance plan.

 contracts  with  one or more school districts, or [boards of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES.
  ee.  Upon  approval by a vote of the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and of the boards of education of a
 majority of the school  districts  participating  in  the  instructional
 program  of  such [board] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, establish a career
 education instructional equipment reserve fund for the  replacement  and
 purchase of advanced technology equipment used in instructional programs
 conducted  by  the  [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE.  Subject to a limitation imposed by  regulation  of
 the  commissioner  on  the  amount  of  money which may be maintained in
 equipment reserve funds established pursuant to this  paragraph,  moneys
 for  such funds shall be obtained by including depreciation expenses for
 the career education instructional equipment used in providing  instruc-
 tional services on a cooperative basis in the computation of the cost of
 such services pursuant to paragraph d of this subdivision. Proceeds from
 the  sale  of  career  education  instructional  equipment  used  in the
 instructional programs of the [board] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and any
 income earned on money deposited in a reserve fund shall become part  of
 such  fund.  The  moneys in such funds shall be deposited and secured in
 the manner provided by section ten of the  general  municipal  law.  The
 moneys  so  deposited shall be accounted for separate and apart from all
 other funds of the district, in the same manner as provided in  subdivi-
 sion  ten  of  section six-c of the general municipal law. The moneys in
 such funds may be invested by  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNIAL  INSTITUTE in the manner provided by section
 eleven of the general municipal law. In the  event  a  career  education
 instructional  equipment  reserve fund is liquidated, the moneys in such
 fund shall be allocated to the school  districts  participating  in  the
 instructional  programs  of  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in proportion to the value  of  the
 contributions  to  the  fund  made  by  the participating districts. The
 commissioner may promulgate regulations pertaining, but not limited,  to
 the  amount  of money to be retained in such reserve funds, the types of
 equipment for which depreciation expenses may be charged and  for  which
 expenditures  may be made from the reserve fund, and required documenta-
 tion of transactions relating to such funds.
  ff. In its discretion, to purchase insurance against personal injuries
 incurred by an authorized participant in  a  school  volunteer  program,
 including  but  not limited to, those authorized participants who assist

 on  school sponsored field trips or any other school sponsored activity;
 provided, however, that the injuries were incurred while the  authorized
 participant  was  functioning  either  within  the  scope  of his or her
 authorized volunteer duties or under  the  direction  of  the  board  of
 education,  trustee,  or  [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, or both.
  gg. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a  [board  of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  may provide
 training for employment to adults  on  a  space  available  basis,  with
 consideration  given to occupations and industries in demand, and estab-
 lish reduced adult tuition rates for such training. For the purposes  of
 this  section,  training  for  employment  for  adults  shall be offered
 through state approved sequences or parts thereof  of  secondary  career
 education instruction. Adults may participate in such instruction and be
 A. 9760  25
 
 awarded  certificates  of completion, but they may not earn credit based
 on their participation  towards  a  high  school  diploma.  Pursuant  to
 section  forty-six  hundred two of this chapter, a [board of cooperative
 educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  may establish such
 reduced rates for participation of adults provided that participation is
 limited to assigned instructional staff and currently used facilities in
 scheduled secondary career education programs, and provided further that
 such rates may not be less than  fifty  percent  of  the  tuition  rates
 charged  to school districts for the participation of secondary students
 in the same programs, unless waived by the commissioner based on  appli-
 cation of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNI-
 CAL  INSTITUTE.  This participation of adults at reduced tuition rates
 shall be in accordance with terms agreed upon by the [board  of  cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and the component
 school districts receiving such services but in no case shall such rates
 result  in  extraordinary  costs  assigned  to  such  component  school
 districts. [Boards of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTES which provide such training to adults  shall  submit  to  the
 commissioner annually a report which shall include but not be limited to
 the  number  of  adults  served,  referral source, training sequences or
 parts thereof taken by adult participants, the tuition rates charged  to
 them, and the gross revenues realized therefrom. For the purpose of this
 paragraph, "adult" shall mean any person under the age of twenty-one who
 has received a high school diploma or any person twenty-one years of age
 or older, whether or not they have received a high school diploma.
  hh.  Provide  for  activities and services pertaining to environmental
 education at the request of more than one school district.  Such  activ-
 ities  and  services each of which shall not exceed three weeks duration
 to be eligible for aid and shall include programs with and  performances

 activity or service, but not appropriate to full time [boards of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES  staff.  [Boards
 of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES are
 authorized to enter into contracts with  individuals,  public  agencies,
 and  not-for-profit  corporations  to  carry  out the provisions of this
 paragraph, subject to the approval of the commissioner.
  ii. Enter into agreements with  one  or  more  financing  agencies  to
 provide for the acceptance by such [board] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE of
 credit  cards  as  a  means  of  payment  of course fees or tuition when
 required for instructional programs offered by such  [board  of  cooper-
 ative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE. Any such agree-
 ment shall govern the terms and conditions  upon  which  a  credit  card
 proffered  as  a  means  of  payment  of  such  fees or tuition shall be
 accepted or declined and the manner in and  conditions  upon  which  the
 financing  agency  shall  pay to such [board] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 the amount of such fees or tuition paid by means of a credit card pursu-
 ant to such agreement. Any such agreement may provide for the payment by
 such [board] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to such financing agency of fees
 for the services provided by such financing agency. For purposes of this
 paragraph, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
  (1) "Credit card" means any credit card, credit plate,  charge  plate,

 credit  of the person issuing the credit card or a person who has agreed
 A. 9760  26

 issued to another person.
  (2) "Financing agency" means any agency defined as such in subdivision
 eighteen of section four hundred one of the personal property law;

 as  may be agreed upon pursuant to such contracts executed by the [board
 of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and  the
 trustees  or boards of education of such school districts, provided that
 any such contract entered into, extended or amended  on  or  after  July
 first, nineteen hundred ninety-six shall be consistent with the require-
 ments  of paragraph d of this subdivision and subdivision one of section
 nineteen hundred fifty-one of this article regarding the  allocation  of
 costs  to  component  school districts based upon the local uniform unit
 cost of each such service.
  kk. For the nineteen hundred  ninety-seven--ninety-eight  school  year
 and thereafter, the [board of cooperative educational services (BOCES)]
 NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE shall prepare [a BOCES] AN INSTITUTE report
 card, pursuant to regulations of the commissioner,  and  shall  make  it
 publicly  available  by  transmitting  it to local newspapers of general
 circulation, appending it to copies of the proposed administrative budg-
 et made publicly available as required by law, making it  available  for
 distribution  at  the  annual meeting, and otherwise disseminating it as
 required by the commissioner. Such report card shall include measures of
 the academic  performance  of  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, on a school by school or program
 by program basis, and measures of the fiscal performance of the supervi-
 sory district, as prescribed by  the  commissioner.  Pursuant  to  regu-
 lations  of  the  commissioner, the report card shall also compare these
 measures to statewide averages for all  [boards  of  cooperative  educa-
 tional  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES.  Such report card shall
 include any information required by the commissioner.
  ll. a. Shall require, for purposes of a criminal history record check,
 the fingerprinting of all  prospective  employees  pursuant  to  section
 three thousand thirty-five of this chapter, who do not hold valid clear-
 ance  pursuant  to  such  section  or pursuant to section three thousand
 four-b of this chapter or section five hundred nine-cc or twelve hundred
 twenty-nine-d of the vehicle and traffic law. Prior  to  initiating  the
 fingerprinting  process,  the  prospective  employer  shall  furnish the
 applicant with the form described in paragraph (c) of subdivision thirty
 of section three hundred five of  this  chapter  and  shall  obtain  the
 applicant's consent to the criminal history records search. Every set of
 fingerprints  taken pursuant to this paragraph shall be promptly submit-
 ted to the commissioner for purposes of clearance for employment.
  b. Upon the recommendation of the district superintendent, the [board]
 NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  may  conditionally  appoint  a  prospective
 employee.  A request for conditional clearance shall be forwarded to the
 commissioner along with  the  prospective  employee's  fingerprints,  as
 required  by paragraph a of this subdivision. Such appointment shall not
 commence until notification by the  commissioner  that  the  prospective
 employee  has been conditionally cleared for employment and shall termi-
 nate forty-five days after such notification of conditional clearance or
 A. 9760  27
 
 when the prospective employer is notified  of  a  determination  by  the
 commissioner  to  grant or deny clearance, whichever occurs earlier, and
 may not be extended or renewed unless  the  commissioner  issues  a  new
 conditional  clearance after finding that there was good cause for fail-
 ing to obtain clearance within such period, provided that  if  clearance
 is  granted,  the  appointment shall continue and the conditional status
 shall be removed. Prior to commencement of such conditional appointment,
 the prospective employer shall obtain a signed statement for conditional
 appointment from the prospective employee, indicating  whether,  to  the
 best of his or her knowledge, he or she has a pending criminal charge or
 criminal conviction in any jurisdiction outside the state.
  c. Upon the recommendation of the district superintendent, the [board]
 NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE may make an emergency conditional appointment
 when an unforeseen emergency vacancy has occurred. When such appointment
 is made, the process for conditional appointment pursuant to paragraph b
 of  this  subdivision  must  also  be  initiated.  Emergency conditional
 appointment may commence prior to notification from the commissioner  on
 conditional  clearance but shall terminate twenty business days from the
 date such appointment commences or  when  the  prospective  employer  is
 notified  by the commissioner regarding conditional clearance, whichever
 occurs earlier, provided that if conditional clearance is  granted,  the
 appointment  shall  continue  as a conditional appointment. Prior to the
 commencement of such appointment, the prospective employer must obtain a
 signed statement for emergency conditional appointment from the prospec-
 tive employee, indicating whether, to the best of his or her  knowledge,
 he  or  she  has a pending criminal charge or criminal conviction in any
 jurisdiction. An unforeseen emergency vacancy shall be defined as: (i) a
 vacancy that occurred less than ten business days before  the  start  of
 any  school  session,  including  summer  school,  or  during any school
 session, including summer school, without sufficient notice to allow for
 clearance or conditional clearance; (ii) when no other qualified  person
 is  available  to fill the vacancy temporarily; and (iii) when emergency
 conditional appointment is necessary  to  maintain  services  which  the
 district is legally required to provide or services necessary to protect
 the  health, education or safety of students or staff. The provisions of
 subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall not apply  if  the  [board]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE finds that the district has been unable to fill
 the vacancy despite good faith efforts to fill such vacancy in a  manner
 which  would  have  allowed sufficient time for clearance or conditional
 clearance.
  d. Shall develop a policy for the safety  of  the  children  who  have
 contact  with  an  employee holding conditional appointment or emergency
 conditional appointment.
  mm. Shall upon  commencement  and  termination  of  employment  of  an
 employee  by the [board] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, provide the commis-
 sioner with the name of and position held by such employee.
  nn. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section and  with  the
 consent  of  the  commissioner, the Madison-Oneida [board of cooperative
 educational services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  may  enter  into  a
 contract or contracts not to exceed a total period of two years with the
 Madison  Cortland  ARC  to provide transportation maintenance and repair
 services on buses owned and operated by the Madison  Cortland  ARC.  The
 Madison-Oneida  [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECH-
 NICAL INSTITUTE shall not charge any portion of costs incurred  pursuant
 to this paragraph to its component school districts.
 A. 9760  28
 
  oo.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law, a [board of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE is authorized  to
 enter  into  a memorandum of understanding with the trustees or board of
 education of a non-component  school  district,  including  city  school
 districts of cities with one hundred twenty-five thousand inhabitants or
 more,  to  participate in a recovery high school program operated by the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 for  a  period not to exceed five years upon such terms as such trustees
 or  board  of  education  and  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE may mutually agree, provided that
 such agreement may provide for a charge for administration of the recov-
 ery high school program including capital costs, but participating  non-
 component  school  districts shall not be liable for payment of adminis-
 trative expenses as defined in paragraph b of this subdivision.  Costs
 allocated to a participating non-component school district pursuant to a
 memorandum  of  understanding  shall  be aidable pursuant to subdivision
 five of this section to the same extent and on the same basis  as  costs
 allocated to a component school district.
  4-a.  The [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE shall develop a plan to ensure that all instructional  materi-
 als  to be used in the programs of the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE are available in a usable  alterna-
 tive  format  for  each student with a disability, as defined in section
 forty-four hundred one of this chapter, and for each student  who  is  a
 qualified  individual with a disability as defined in the rehabilitation
 act of nineteen hundred ninety-three (29  U.S.C.  701)  as  amended,  in
 accordance  with  his  or her educational needs and course selection, at
 the same time as such instructional materials are available to non-disa-
 bled students. As part of such plan, the [board  of  cooperative  educa-
 tional  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall amend its procurement
 policies to give a preference in the purchase of instructional materials
 to vendors who agree to provide materials in  alternative  formats.  For
 purposes of this subdivision, "alternative format" shall mean any medium
 or  format for the presentation of instructional materials, other than a
 traditional print textbook, that is needed as  an  accommodation  for  a
 disabled  student  enrolled  in  a  program of the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,  including  but  not
 limited to Braille, large print, open and closed captioned, audio, or an
 electronic  file in an approved format, as defined in the regulations of
 the commissioner. When an electronic file is provided,  the  plan  shall
 specify  how  the  format  will  be  accessed by students and/or how the
 district shall convert to an accessible format. Such plan shall identify
 the needs of students enrolled in a program of the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for alternative  format
 materials.  Such  plan  shall  also specify ordering timelines to ensure
 that alternative format materials are available  at  the  same  time  as
 regular format materials. Such plans shall include procedures to address
 the  need  to  obtain  materials in alternative format without delay for
 disabled students who enroll in a program of  a  [board  of  cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE during the school year.
  5.  a.  Upon  application  by  a  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, there  shall  be  apportioned  and
 paid  from  state  funds  to  each  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE an amount which shall be the  prod-
 uct  of  the approved cost of services actually incurred during the base
 year  multiplied  by  the  sharing  ratio  for  cooperative  educational
 A. 9760  29
 
 services  aid  which  shall equal the greater of: (i) an amount equal to
 one minus the quotient expressed as a decimal to  three  places  without
 rounding  of  eight  mills divided by the tax rate of the local district
 computed  upon  the  actual valuation of taxable property, as determined
 pursuant to subdivision one of section thirty-six hundred  two  of  this
 chapter  [and notwithstanding section three thousand six hundred three,]
 expressed in mills to the nearest tenth as determined by the commission-
 er, provided, however, that where services  are  provided  to  a  school
 district which is included within a central high school district or to a
 central  high  school  district,  such  amount shall equal one minus the
 quotient expressed as a decimal to  three  places  without  rounding  of
 three  mills divided by the tax rates, expressed in mills to the nearest
 tenth, of such districts, as determined by the commissioner or (ii)  the
 aid  ratio  of each school district for the current year, which shall be
 such component  school  district's  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE aid ratio and which shall be not
 less than thirty-six percent converted to decimals and shall be not more
 than ninety percent converted to decimals.  For  the  purposes  of  this
 paragraph,  the  tax rate of the local district computed upon the actual
 valuation of taxable property shall be the sum  of  the  amount  of  tax
 raised  by  the  school  district  plus  any  payments  in lieu of taxes
 received by the school district pursuant to section four hundred  eight-
 y-five  of the real property tax law, divided by the actual valuation of
 the school district, provided, however that the tax rate for  a  central
 high school district shall be the sum of the amount of tax raised by the
 common  and union free school districts included within the central high
 school district for the support of the central high school district plus
 any payments in lieu of taxes received for the support  of  the  central
 high school district pursuant to section four hundred eighty-five of the
 real  property  tax  law, divided by the actual valuation of the central
 high school district. The tax rate for each common or union free  school
 district  which  is included within a central high school district shall
 be the sum of the amount raised for the support of such common or  union
 free school district plus any payments in lieu of taxes received for the
 support  of the school district pursuant to section four hundred eighty-
 five of the real property tax law, exclusive of the  amount  raised  for
 the  central  high  school  district, divided by the actual valuation of
 such common or union free school district.
  b. The cost of services herein referred to shall be the  amount  allo-
 cated  to  each  component  school district by the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to defray  expenses  of
 such  [board] INSTITUTE, including approved expenses from the testing of
 potable water systems of occupied school buildings under  the  [board's]
 INSTITUTE'S  jurisdiction as required pursuant to section eleven hundred
 ten of the public health law provided that such expenses for testing  of
 potable water systems are not reimbursable from another state or federal
 source, except that that part of the salary paid any teacher, supervisor
 or  other employee of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE which is in excess of  thirty  thousand  dollars
 shall  not be such an approved expense, and except also that administra-
 tive and clerical expenses shall not exceed ten  percent  of  the  total
 expenses  for  purposes  of  this  computation.  Any gifts, donations or
 interest earned by the [board of cooperative  educational  services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE or on behalf of the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE by the dormitory authority
 or any other source shall not be deducted in  determining  the  cost  of
 A. 9760  30
 
 services  allocated to each component school district. Any payments made
 to a component school district by the [board of cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE pursuant to subdivision eleven of
 section  six-p  of the general municipal law attributable to an approved
 cost of service computed pursuant to this subdivision shall be  deducted
 from  the  cost of services allocated to such component school district.
 The expense of transportation provided  by  the  [board  of  cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE pursuant to paragraph q
 of  subdivision  four  of  this section shall be eligible for aid appor-
 tioned pursuant to subdivision seven of section thirty-six  hundred  two
 of  this  chapter  and no [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE transportation expense shall be an approved cost
 of services for the computation of aid under this subdivision.  Trans-
 portation  expense  pursuant  to paragraph q of subdivision four of this
 section shall be included in the computation of the ten percent  limita-
 tion on administrative and clerical expenses.
  c.  The  "tax  rate" as herein referred to shall not include a special
 tax levied for debt service in an existing district of a central  school
 district or a consolidated district.
  d.  Nothing  in  this act shall prevent school districts or [boards of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES  with  the
 approval  of  the  commissioner  of education from providing cooperative
 educational services for which no application for state  aid  is  to  be
 made.
  e. Any aid apportioned in accordance with section two hundred thirteen
 of  [the  education  law] THIS CHAPTER to a [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  in  connection  with  the
 production  of  educational  television  materials  and programs, or the
 acquisition by purchase, lease or otherwise of television facilities  or
 operational  expenses  in  connection therewith shall not be utilized in
 connection with computing the apportionment to such  [board  of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE. Any aid appor-
 tioned or paid by the state  to  a  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  for  experimental  or  special
 programs shall not be utilized in connection with computing  the  appor-
 tionment  to  such  [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
  f. The sum  of  the  amounts  determined  for  each  component  school
 district  as  the apportionment to the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE pursuant to the provisions of  this
 section  shall  not be less than the amount which would have been appor-
 tioned during the nineteen hundred sixty-seven--sixty-eight school  year
 under  the provisions of this subdivision as in effect on December thir-
 ty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six to the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE of which the district was  a
 component member for which such apportionment was made, except that such
 minimum apportionment shall be reduced in any year in which the expendi-
 tures  of  the component district for [board of cooperative educational]
 NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE purposes fall below the expenditure on  which
 the  nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven--sixty-eight  apportionment  to  the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 was based, such reduction to be made on a proportionate basis.
  g.  Any  payment  required  by  a  [board  of  cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to the dormitory authority  or  any
 payment  required  by  a  [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to acquire or construct a school facility of the
 A. 9760  31
 
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,
 and  any  payments  for  rental of facilities by a [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall, for the purposes
 of  apportionment  of  public moneys to the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE by the state of New York, be
 deemed to be an administrative or capital expense, as designated by  the
 commissioner, but the entire amount of such payment shall be utilized in
 making such apportionment and the limitation of ten percent of the total
 expenses  contained  in  this  subdivision  shall not be applicable. Any
 expense designated by the commissioner as a  capital  expense  shall  be
 included  in the capital budget of the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and, except as  otherwise  provided
 in  this  paragraph, shall be aided in the same manner as an administra-
 tive expense. Any such payment shall not be considered part of the total
 expenses of the [board] INSTITUTE for purposes of determining the admin-
 istrative and clerical expenses not  to  exceed  ten  percent  otherwise
 eligible  for  aid  under  this  subdivision, and such payments shall be
 considered for the purpose of apportionment during  the  current  school
 year  such payment is made. The apportionment for such payments shall be
 determined by multiplying the amount of such payment allocated  to  each
 component  school  district  in  the  [board  of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE by the aid ratio, and shall be  not
 more  than  ninety percent converted to decimals, of each such component
 computed pursuant to subdivision three of section thirty-six hundred two
 OF THIS CHAPTER and used to apportion  aid  to  that  district  in  that
 current  school  year;  provided,  however,  the  apportionment  for the
 construction, acquisition, reconstruction, rehabilitation,  or  improve-
 ment  of  [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE facilities, including payments to the dormitory authority  and
 payments  under any lease agreement, shall be based upon the cost of the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 school  facilities  but  not  to  exceed the cost allowance set forth in
 subdivision six of section thirty-six hundred two of [the education law]
 THIS CHAPTER and payments for rental facilities shall be subject to  the
 approval of the commissioner.
  h.  Each  [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE receiving a payment pursuant to paragraph a of  this  subdivi-
 sion  and  section  thirty-six  hundred  nine-d of this chapter shall be
 required to set aside from such payment an  amount  not  less  than  the
 amount of state aid received pursuant to paragraph a of this subdivision
 in  the  base  year that was attributable to cooperative services agree-
 ments (CO-SERs) for career education, as determined by the commissioner,
 and shall be required to use such amount  to  support  career  education
 programs in the current year.
  5-a.  Financial assistance for school districts first joining a [board
 of cooperative educational services (BOCES)] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
 a. Eligibility. Any school district first joining [a BOCES] AN INSTITUTE
 on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-five and prior  to  July
 second,  nineteen hundred ninety-seven shall be eligible to apply to the
 commissioner for financial assistance pursuant to the provisions of this
 subdivision and subdivision five of this section.
  b. Financial assistance. Financial assistance shall mean  an  interest
 free loan available upon application in the current year which shall not
 exceed  the product of (i) the applicable percent defined in paragraph c
 of this subdivision and (ii) the sum of the local share and  any  repay-
 ment due for the prior year loan. Such local share shall equal the posi-
 A. 9760  32
 
 tive  remainder  resulting when aid payable on behalf of the district in
 the current year  pursuant  to  subdivision  five  of  this  section  is
 subtracted  from  the district's [BOCES] INSTITUTE expenses which are or
 would  be  aidable in the current year or the next year pursuant to such
 subdivision five. The annual application for such a loan shall be  in  a
 form  prescribed  by the commissioner and shall accompany the submission
 of the final set of state aid forms required of  the  [BOCES]  INSTITUTE
 each  year  and shall be certified by the district superintendent of the
 [BOCES] INSTITUTE. The amount of the loan in any year  shall  be  deter-
 mined  by  the  commissioner  and  the payment and repayment of the loan
 shall be in accordance with the provisions of paragraph d of this subdi-
 vision.
  c. Applicable percent. The applicable percent shall be  determined  by
 the  number  of  years  that  an  eligible district has been a component
 district of a [BOCES] INSTITUTE.  In the first year, such percent  shall
 be  equal to the district's [BOCES] INSTITUTE and building aid ratio for
 aid payable in the first year in which the district  joins  the  [BOCES]
 INSTITUTE,  each  year  thereafter, such percent shall be reduced by ten
 percent until such percent would drop below ten percent at which time it
 shall be deemed to be zero.
  d. Payment and repayment. Notwithstanding any inconsistent  provisions
 of  section  thirty-six hundred nine-a of this chapter, the loan amounts
 determined by the commissioner pursuant to paragraph b of this  subdivi-
 sion  shall  be  paid to each eligible school district on or before June
 fifteenth, commencing with the first year of eligibility,  but  only  to
 the  extent  that  the repayment of the base year loan has been secured.
 Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, the state comptroller
 shall deduct the amount of any base year loan from any monies  due  such
 school  district  in March of the current year. Should the amount of any
 monies due such school district in March be insufficient  to  repay  the
 total  amount  of  the  base year loan to the school district, the state
 comptroller shall deduct any balance due the state from any other monies
 payable to such district. Should the total amount of monies due to or on
 behalf of such school district be insufficient to repay the total amount
 of the base year loan determined in paragraph  b  of  this  subdivision,
 such  school  district  shall  make a direct payment to the state before
 March first of the current year and such payment shall  be  credited  to
 the general fund local assistance account of the department.
  6.  The  [board  of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE is hereby created a body corporate. All property which is  now
 vested  in,  or  shall hereafter be transferred to the [board of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, shall be held by
 them as a corporation.
  7. In the event that two or  more  entire  supervisory  districts  for
 which  [boards  of  cooperative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTES have been  established  shall  become  a  single  supervisory
 district  by  the  redistricting  of  supervisory  districts pursuant to
 section twenty-two hundred one of this chapter, the [boards  of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTES theretofore
 established shall nevertheless remain in existence  until  August  first
 next  following  such  redistricting for the purpose of carrying out the
 programs for the current school year. For all other purposes,  from  and
 after  the  effective date of such redistricting such [boards of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES shall constitute
 a single [board of cooperative educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  for  the supervisory district as then constituted in the same
 A. 9760  33
 
 manner as though such [board] INSTITUTE had been  established  for  such
 supervisory  district  pursuant  to subdivision one of this section, and
 shall have all of the powers and  duties  of  such  [boards]  INSTITUTES
 under  this  chapter.  The  members  of  such  [boards] INSTITUTES shall
 continue to serve until the expiration of the terms of office for  which
 they  were  elected. No election shall be held to fill vacancies on such
 [board] INSTITUTE as the terms of members expire until such date as  the
 terms of sufficient members have expired to cause the membership of such
 [board]  INSTITUTE  to be not less than five nor more than fifteen, such
 number to be determined at  the  annual  meeting  of  the  trustees  and
 members  of boards of education of such supervisory district held in the
 month of April following such redistricting. Thereafter members of  such
 [board]  INSTITUTE shall be elected annually to fill vacancies occurring
 by expiration of term.  Notwithstanding any other provision  of  law,  a
 [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 may fill a vacancy on such  [board]  INSTITUTE  at  the  annual  [board]
 INSTITUTE  election  immediately  following  such annual meeting and may
 accept nominations pursuant to subdivision  two-a  of  this  section  in
 anticipation  that  one  or  more  vacancies will exist once such annual
 meeting so establishes the number  of  the  membership  of  the  [board]
 INSTITUTE,  provided  that  the  election  ballot shall state that nomi-
 nations have been accepted in anticipation  of  possible  vacancies  and
 that  the  clerk  of  the [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE will advise the component boards in  writing  of
 the  actual  number  of  vacant offices to be filled at the election, if
 any, no later than one business day after  the  annual  meeting.  Should
 such  a  supervisory  district  for which a [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  has  been  established  be
 divided  by  the  commissioner  in  the redistricting thereof, on August
 first next following such redistricting, after  paying  all  outstanding
 obligations of such [board] INSTITUTE, any balance of funds remaining in
 the  treasury of such [board] INSTITUTE shall be allocated to the credit
 of the component school districts in accordance with the ratio which the
 proportion of the cost allocated to each component school district bears
 to the total cost of services of such [board of cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE during the last full school year of
 its  operation.  In  the  event that a [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall have been established for the
 supervisory district of which such component district is  then  a  part,
 the  amount  of such balance allocated to such district shall be paid to
 the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTI-
 TUTE  established  for  such  supervisory district and any member of the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 for  such  divided  district who resides in the territory so transferred
 shall on and after the date of such redistricting become a member of the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 of  the supervisory district to which the school district in which he or
 she resides has been transferred and shall serve as  such  member  until
 the expiration of the term of office for which he or she was elected. In
 the  event  that there is no [board of cooperative educational services]
 NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for any component district the amount of such
 balance allocated to such district shall be paid  to  the  treasurer  of
 such  district.  In  such  event the state aid authorized by subdivision
 five of this section for the last year of operation of  such  [board  of
 cooperative  educational  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall be
 distributed to the component school districts in the amounts which would
 A. 9760  34
 
 have accrued to such [board  of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE by reason of their participation.
  8.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this chapter, with the
 approval of the commissioner of education, at the request of  boards  of
 education  of  union  free  school districts having a population of four
 thousand five hundred or more and employing a superintendent of schools,
 where such school districts lie within towns included in the supervisory
 district or supervisory districts comprising the territory served  by  a
 [board  of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE,
 such union free school districts may upon the consent of the  [board  of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE be included
 as  component  districts for the purposes of this section and shall have
 all of the rights and obligations of such component districts under this
 section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,  and  with
 the  consent  of the commissioner, likewise, at the request of the board
 of education of any city school district, having a  population  of  less
 than  one  hundred  twenty-five  thousand  inhabitants, such city school
 district may, upon the consent of the [board of cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,  be  included  as  a  component
 district for the purpose of this section and shall have all  the  rights
 and obligations of such component districts under this section.
  8-a.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section and with the
 consent of the commissioner, the city school district  of  the  city  of
 Syracuse  may,  upon  consent  of  the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for the sole  supervisory  district
 for  Onondaga  and Madison counties, be included as a component district
 for the sole purpose of operating a combined program and/or constructing
 a combined facility for children with developmental disabilities in  the
 city  of  Syracuse and the county of Onondaga. Such city school district
 shall add an amount to its budget and levy, collect and pay the same  to
 such [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE  to  defray the proportional expenses of constructing and operating
 such facility for such children. Such city school district shall not  be
 liable  for  payment of administrative expenses as provided for in para-
 graph b of subdivision four of this section nor shall such  city  school
 district  be  eligible  for  the payment of state aid under this section
 except such city school district shall receive state aid  based  on  its
 proportionate  share  of  building  expenses  related to this program as
 determined by the commissioner.
  Such city school district shall continue to receive aid under subdivi-
 sion five of section thirty-six hundred two for the attendance of  chil-
 dren in this program.
  8-b. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section and with the
 consent  of  the commissioner, city school districts of cities in excess
 of one hundred  twenty-five  thousand  inhabitants  but  less  than  one
 million  inhabitants,  upon  consent of the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE approved by the commissioner
 may be included as a component district of such  [board  of  cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for the sole purpose of
 purchasing student information system services consistent with standards
 established  by  the commissioner from such [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE.  Each  such  city  school
 district  shall  add an amount to its budget and shall levy, collect and
 pay the costs of such program to such [board of cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  to  defray their portion of the
 expenses of such a program. Such  city  school  district  shall  not  be
 A. 9760  35
 
 liable  for  payment of administrative expenses as provided for in para-
 graph b of subdivision four of this section nor shall such  city  school
 district be eligible for payment of state aid under this section.
  8-c.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this section, any school
 district not a  component  of  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE of the supervisory district serving
 its geographic area, including a city school district in a city having a
 population  in  excess  of one hundred twenty-five thousand inhabitants,
 upon consent of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE and with the approval of the  commissioner,  may  be
 treated  in the same manner as a component school district of the [board
 of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE  of  the
 supervisory district serving its geographic area, or an adjoining [board
 of  cooperative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in the
 case of a city school district in a city having one million  inhabitants
 or  more,  for  the  sole  purpose  of  purchasing instructional support
 services, as defined by the  commissioner.  Each  such  school  district
 shall  add  an  amount to its budget and shall levy, collect and pay the
 costs  of  such  program  to  such  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  to  defray  its  portion of the
 expenses of such program, including a charge for administration  not  to
 exceed  the  restricted  indirect cost rate, provided that the [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE  shall  not
 charge any portion of the administrative costs incurred pursuant to this
 subdivision  to  its  component  school districts. Such school districts
 shall not be liable for payment of administrative expenses  as  provided
 for  in  paragraph b of subdivision four of this section and subdivision
 one of section nineteen hundred fifty-one of this article. In  the  case
 of  city  school  districts in a city with a population in excess of one
 hundred twenty-five thousand inhabitants, such participation shall be in
 addition to the participation authorized  by  subdivisions  eight-a  and
 eight-b of this section. In the case of a city school district in a city
 with  a  population  of  one hundred twenty-five thousand inhabitants or
 more, in lieu of participation as a component district of  an  adjoining
 [board  of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE,
 the city school district may opt to provide  such  support  services  as
 shared  services  directly  or  in collaboration with one or more insti-
 tutions of higher education. The approved costs of such  services  shall
 be  eligible for state aid in accordance with the provisions of subdivi-
 sion twenty of section thirty-six hundred two of this chapter, and shall
 not be eligible for aid pursuant to subdivision five of this section.
  8-d. Notwithstanding the provision of any law, rule, or regulation  to
 the  contrary,  the  city school district of the city of Rochester, upon
 the consent of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLY-
 TECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  of the supervisory district serving its geographic
 region, may purchase from such  [board]  INSTITUTE  as  a  non-component
 school  district, services required by article nineteen of the education
 law.
  9. No person shall be eligible to be elected to the office  of  member
 of a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE  who  is  an  employee  of  a  school  district  in the supervisory
 district.
  9-a. No person shall be eligible to hold the office  of  member  of  a
 [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 who does not reside within the boundaries of a component school district
 of any such [board] INSTITUTE.
 A. 9760  36
 
  10. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this  chapter  or  of  any
 other  general  or  special law to the contrary, if and when two or more
 supervisory districts shall be combined into a new supervisory  district
 pursuant  to  the  provisions  of section twenty-two hundred one of this
 chapter,  as  a  result  of which the [boards of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES  for  such  supervisory  districts
 shall  become  a  single  [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for such redistricted supervisory district, such
 single [board of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  for  such  redistricted  supervisory  district shall, in such
 case, allocate the appropriate amounts of payments required to  be  made
 to  the dormitory authority for rental of facilities or otherwise to the
 school districts contained, respectively,  in  such  former  [boards  of
 cooperative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES for such
 supervisory districts, as if such [boards] INSTITUTES continued to exist
 in law for the sole purpose of making such payments.
  11. With the approval of the commissioner,  one  or  more  [boards  of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES and one or
 more  school  districts  may  enter  into  an agreement or agreements to
 provide for sharing costs of construction of or  leases  for  facilities
 acquired  for the purpose of housing services to be provided by a [board
 or boards of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTI-
 TUTE  OR  INSTITUTES for provision of which services such facilities are
 constructed or leased, provided, however that no new agreements for  the
 sharing  of costs of construction or leases of facilities may be entered
 into pursuant to this subdivision on or after July first,  two  thousand
 three.  No  such  agreement may be for a longer term than is required to
 retire any obligations issued by one or more  of  the  parties  to  such
 agreement  for  the  purpose of acquiring such facilities, or to pay the
 dormitory authority in full for the acquisition of such facilities.
  13. a. A [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  and  the component school districts of such [board of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE may enter into an
 agreement providing for the acquisition from the dormitory authority  of
 facilities  designed  to house services to be provided by such [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and for the
 sharing of the cost of such acquisition. Such agreement in  addition  to
 providing  for  all  other matters deemed necessary and proper shall (i)
 set forth the cost of such acquisition which shall be the amount  certi-
 fied  by  the dormitory authority as sufficient to pay the principal of,
 the redemption premium, if any, and interest to the earliest  of  either
 the  maturity date or the next redemption date on all obligations of the
 dormitory authority issued in relation  to  providing  such  facilities,
 including  all incidental expenses in relation thereto, and (ii) provide
 for an allocation and apportionment of  the  cost  of  such  acquisition
 among  the  component  school  districts  on such equitable basis as the
 parties thereto shall determine and agree, and  the  proportion  of  the
 total  cost to be provided by each such district in accordance with such
 allocation and apportionment. In those cases where construction of  such
 facilities shall not have been completed, the amount so certified by the
 dormitory  authority  shall include the amount estimated to be necessary
 by the dormitory authority to complete such construction  by  it  acting
 for and on behalf of such [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE;  provided,  however, that such agreement shall
 provide that such [board] INSTITUTE shall pay to the dormitory authority
 any additional amounts thereafter determined and certified by the dormi-
 A. 9760  37
 
 tory authority to be necessary in order to complete the construction  of
 such  facilities.  Existing contracts awarded by the dormitory authority
 for the construction of such facilities shall not be modified, nor shall
 any work not covered thereby be authorized, without the prior consent of
 an  officer  of  such [board] INSTITUTE authorized to so act by a resol-
 ution of such [board] INSTITUTE. Such agreement shall be executed by all
 the component school districts of such [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE whose allocation of  administrative
 expenses  would include a portion of the amounts required to be paid the
 dormitory authority for the rental of such facilities.
  b. The acquisition of such facilities is hereby  declared  and  deter-
 mined to be a school district purpose and an object or purpose for which
 each such component school district is hereby authorized to expend money
 and  contract  indebtedness.  The  period of probable usefulness of such
 object or purpose is hereby determined to be  thirty  years.  Each  such
 component  school  district is hereby authorized to finance its share of
 the cost of the acquisition of such facilities together with costs inci-
 dental to such financing, including, but  not  limited  to  legal  fees,
 printing,  engraving and publication of notices, either from any current
 funds legally available therefor, or  by  the  issuance  of  obligations
 pursuant  to  the  local  finance  law;  provided,  however, that (i) no
 approval of the voters  of  such  component  school  district  shall  be
 required,  (ii)  the voting of a special tax or a tax to be collected in
 installments shall not be a condition precedent to  the  adoption  of  a
 bond resolution for such object or purpose, (iii) a majority vote of the
 entire voting strength of the board of education shall be sufficient for
 adoption of such a bond resolution, which bond resolution may be adopted
 at  a  regular  meeting,  or a special meeting of the board of education
 called on not less than twelve hours oral or written notice,  which  may
 be  held  either  within or outside of such district, (iv) any such bond
 resolution shall take effect immediately and shall not be subject either
 to a mandatory or permissive referendum, and (v) no such bond resolution
 shall be adopted prior to the execution by  the  [board  of  cooperative
 educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  and  the component
 school districts of such [board of cooperative educational services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE of the agreement required by paragraph a of this
 subdivision.
  c.  Nothing  herein  contained shall be construed to permit any school
 district in a city (as defined in paragraph two-b of section 2.00 of the
 local finance law) to contract indebtedness for such object  or  purpose
 in  excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph b of section 104.00
 of such law, without a compliance with the  provisions  of  paragraph  c
 thereof.  A school district, other than a school district in a city, may
 issue bonds or bond anticipation notes for such  object  or  purpose  in
 excess  of  the  limitation  prescribed  by  paragraph d of such section
 104.00, without complying with the  requirements  of  subparagraphs  one
 through  three of such paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of
 law to the contrary, a special act school district, as defined in subdi-
 vision eight of section four thousand one of this chapter, shall not  be
 deemed  a  component school district of the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for purposes of this  subdi-
 vision.
  d.  Upon certification by the dormitory authority of the receipt by it
 of the amount set forth in the agreement as the cost of the  acquisition
 of  such  facilities,  title thereto shall vest in the [board of cooper-
 ative educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  without  any
 A. 9760  38
 
 further  action  or deed or conveyance, which title shall be held by the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 for  the  benefit and on behalf of all the component school districts of
 such [board] INSTITUTE executing such agreement.
  e.  The  validity  of any obligations issued by any school district in
 accordance with this subdivision shall not be affected  or  impaired  by
 any omission, defect or irregularity in any previous acts or proceedings
 by  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE, or by any of the component school districts of such [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in relation
 to the authorization of such facilities or the construction and  financ-
 ing thereof by the dormitory authority.
  f. State aid on account of the acquisition of such facilities shall be
 paid  to  each  component school district based upon its respective debt
 service or share thereof paid pursuant to the agreement herein  provided
 for, and upon its respective aid ratio.
  g.  Notwithstanding any provision of law, the dormitory authority, any
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 and any component school district thereof, are all hereby authorized and
 empowered  to  perform  any  and  all acts and to enter into any and all
 agreements necessary or desirable to effectuate  the  purposes  of  this
 subdivision.
  14.  a. All provisions of this subdivision shall be applicable only if
 any agreement or agreements referred to herein shall be entered into  by
 a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 and  all  of the component school districts of the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE. A  [board  of  cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and the component
 school  districts of such [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE may enter into an agreement  providing  for  the
 acquisition  or  construction,  including new construction, additions or
 reconstruction of facilities designed to house services to  be  provided
 by  such  [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE and for the  sharing  of  the  cost  of  such  acquisition  or
 construction.  Such  agreement  in  addition  to providing for all other
 matters deemed necessary and proper shall (i) set forth the cost of such
 acquisition or  construction  and  costs  incidental  thereto  and  (ii)
 provide  for an allocation and apportionment of the costs of such acqui-
 sition or construction among the  component  school  districts  on  such
 equitable  basis  as  the parties thereto shall determine and agree, and
 the proportion of the total cost to be provided by each such district in
 accordance with such allocation and apportionment. Such agreement  shall
 be  executed  by  all  the  component school districts of such [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  and  such
 [board  of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
 Such agreement may provide that each component school district of such a
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 shall  issue  an agreed upon amount of its obligations in a total amount
 sufficient to acquire or construct such facilities, or that  all  compo-
 nent  districts  of  such  [board]  INSTITUTE shall together issue joint
 obligations pledging  the  full  faith  and  credit  for  all  component
 districts  jointly  and  that  each  such district shall pay a specified
 share of annual debt service on such  joint  obligations  in  accordance
 with  the  provisions of article five-g of the general municipal law and
 applicable provisions of the local finance law.
 A. 9760  39
 
  b. The acquisition  or  construction  of  such  facilities  is  hereby
 declared  and  determined  to  be a public purpose and a school district
 purpose and a specific object or purpose for which each  such  component
 school  district  is  hereby  authorized  to  expend  money and contract
 indebtedness.  The period of probable usefulness of such specific object
 or  purpose is hereby determined to be thirty years. Each such component
 school district is hereby authorized to finance its share of the cost of
 the acquisition or construction of such facilities, together with  costs
 incidental  thereto,  either  from  any  current funds legally available
 therefor or by the issuance of obligations pursuant to the local finance
 law; provided, however, that (i) no  approval  of  the  voters  of  such
 component  school  district  shall  be  required,  (ii)  the voting of a
 special tax or a tax to be collected in  installments  shall  not  be  a
 condition  precedent  to  the  adoption  of  a  bond resolution for such
 specific object or purpose, (iii) a majority vote of the  entire  voting
 strength  of  the board of education shall be sufficient for adoption of
 such a bond resolution, which bond resolution may be adopted at a  regu-
 lar  meeting,  or  a special meeting of the board of education called on
 not less than twenty-four hours oral or written notice to the members of
 such [board] INSTITUTE as provided in section  sixteen  hundred  six  of
 [the education law] THIS CHAPTER, which meeting may be held either with-
 in or outside of such district, (iv) any such bond resolution shall take
 effect  immediately  and  shall  not be subject to either a mandatory or
 permissive referendum, and (v) no such bond resolution shall be  adopted
 prior  to  the  execution  by  [the  board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and all  of  the  component  school
 districts  of  such [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE of the agreement required by  paragraph  a  of  this
 subdivision.
  c.  No  further  approval  of the voters of such [board of cooperative
 educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  or  any  component
 district thereof shall be required other than that required by paragraph
 t of subdivision four of this section.
  d.  Such  agreement  shall  further provide that title to the facility
 shall vest in the [board of cooperative educational services]  NY  POLY-
 TECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  which title shall be held by the [board of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for  the  benefit
 and  on  behalf  of  all  the component school districts of such [board]
 INSTITUTE executing such agreement.
  e. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to  permit  any  school
 district in a city (as defined in paragraph two-b of section 2.00 of the
 local  finance law) to contract indebtedness for such specific object or
 purpose in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph b of section
 104.00 of such law, without complying with the provisions of paragraph c
 thereof. A school district, other than a school district in a city,  may
 not  issue  bonds or bond anticipation notes for such specific object or
 purpose in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph  d  of  such
 section 104.00, without complying with the requirements of subparagraphs
 one through three of such paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision
 of  law  to  the  contrary, a special act school district, as defined in
 subdivision eight of section four thousand one of  this  chapter,  shall
 not  be  deemed a component school district of the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE for  purposes  of  this
 subdivision.
  f.  State  aid  on  account of the acquisition or construction of such
 facilities shall be paid to each component school  district  based  upon
 A. 9760  40
 
 its respective debt service or share thereof paid pursuant to the agree-
 ment  herein  provided  for, and upon its respective aid ratio. Any such
 computation of state aid shall further be based upon the  cost  of  such
 acquisition,  or  construction,  and  including incidental costs, to the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 but  not  to  exceed  the cost allowance set forth in subdivision six of
 section thirty-six hundred two of this chapter.
  18. Accountability of personal property. On or before  January  first,
 nineteen  hundred  ninety-seven,  each [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall develop and  adopt  a  formal
 policy  on  personal property accountability, including the acquisition,
 sale and disposal of personal property. Such policy shall be approved by
 the commissioner consistent with regulations adopted for  such  purpose,
 which  shall include but not be limited to (a) procedures for the acqui-
 sition of personal property both by purchase and by gift, (b) procedures
 for the periodic inventory of personal property, and (c) procedures  for
 the  sale  of  valuable  personal property to the highest bidder, except
 however that vehicles received at no  cost  for  use  in  an  authorized
 welfare  to  work  program  may  be transferred at no cost or at cost of
 repairs, where repairs have been made to the vehicle at  [the  board  of
 cooperative education services] SUCH INSTITUTE, to participants who have
 met  all  the  program  requirements.  Each such [board] INSTITUTE shall
 periodically review and update such policy, provided that any amendments
 of the policy shall be subject to approval of the commissioner.
  19.  Where  the  district  has  provided  transportation  to  students
 enrolled in such district to a school sponsored field trip, extracurric-
 ular  activity  or any other similar event, it shall provide transporta-
 tion back to either the point of departure or to the appropriate  school
 in  the  district,  unless  the  parent  or  legal guardian of a student
 participating in such event has provided the school district with  writ-
 ten  notice, consistent with district policy, authorizing an alternative
 form of return transportation for such  student  or  unless  intervening
 circumstances  make  such  transportation  impractical.  In  cases where
 intervening circumstances make transportation of a student back  to  the
 point  of departure or to the appropriate school in the district imprac-
 tical, a representative of the school district  shall  remain  with  the
 student  until  such  student's  parent  or  legal guardian has been (a)
 contacted and informed of the intervening circumstances which make  such
 transportation  impractical  and  (b) such student had been delivered to
 his or her parent or legal guardian.
  § 3. Subparagraph (a) of paragraph p of subdivision 4 of section  1950
 of  the education law, as amended by chapter 602 of the laws of 1994, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a) To rent suitable land, classrooms, offices or buildings upon or in
 which to maintain and conduct such cooperative educational services  and
 administrative  offices  for  a  period  not  to exceed ten years and to
 improve, alter, equip and furnish  such  land,  classrooms,  offices  or
 buildings  in  a  suitable manner for such purposes (1) before executing
 any lease, the [board] INSTITUTE shall adopt  a  resolution  determining
 that such agreement is in the best financial interests of the superviso-
 ry  district and stating the basis of that determination; (2) the rental
 payment shall not be more than the fair market value  as  determined  by
 the  [board]  INSTITUTE;  and  (3) upon the consent of the commissioner,
 renewal of such lease may be made for a period of up to ten years. Noth-
 ing contained herein shall prevent the [board] INSTITUTE  from  entering
 into  a  lease agreement which provides for the cancellation of the same
 A. 9760  41
 
 by such [board] INSTITUTE upon: (i) a substantial increase  or  decrease
 in  pupil  enrollment;  or  (ii)  a  substantial change in the needs and
 requirements of a [board of cooperative educational services]  NY  POLY-
 TECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  with  respect  to  facilities;  or (iii) any other
 change which substantially affects the needs or requirements of a [board
 of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE  or  the
 community  in  which  it  is located. No lease or other contract for the
 occupancy of such  land,  classrooms,  offices  or  buildings  shall  be
 enforceable  against  the [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE unless  and  until  the  same  shall  have  been
 approved in writing by the commissioner.
  § 4. Section 1951 of the education law, as added by chapter 795 of the
 laws  of  1967  and  as  renumbered  by chapter 378 of the laws of 1972,
 subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 474 of the laws of 1996, paragraph a
 of subdivision 2 as amended by chapter 722 of the laws of 2005, subpara-
 graph (2) of paragraph c of subdivision 2 as amended by chapter  919  of

 of  the laws of 2005, and subdivision 3 as added by section 15 of part A
 of chapter 436 of the laws of 1997, is amended to read as follows:
  § 1951. Budget of [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE. 1. The final administrative and capital budgets  of
 the  [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE as adopted shall be a charge against all of  the  school  districts
 contained  in  the  [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,  provided,  however,  that  any  component  school
 district which does not elect to participate in any specific educational
 service  authorized  to be furnished by the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall not be required to pay
 any share of the moneys provided in the program budget  as  salaries  of
 teachers  or  other  personnel  employed  in providing such service, for
 equipment and supplies for such service or for transportation of  pupils
 to and from the place where such service is maintained, provided, howev-
 er,  expenditures for the [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE program, including office and  central  adminis-
 trative expenses, traveling expenses and salaries and benefits of super-
 visors and all other central administrative personnel necessary to carry
 out its program shall be deemed administrative expenses which shall be a
 charge upon all component school districts notwithstanding the fact that
 such  a  component  school  district  elects  to  not participate in any
 specific program  offered  by  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.  Each school district's propor-
 tionate share of administrative and capital expenses shall be determined
 in accordance with subparagraph seven of paragraph b of subdivision four
 of section nineteen hundred fifty of this article. The [board] INSTITUTE
 shall allocate the cost of other  services  to  participating  component
 school  districts  in  accordance  with  terms  agreed upon between such
 [board] INSTITUTE and the boards  of  education  and  trustees  of  each
 component school district using the local uniform unit cost of each such
 service,  based  on  (i) anticipated participation in the ensuing school
 year, or (ii) participation in the current year, or (iii) a two or three
 year average including participation in the  current  year,  which  unit
 cost  shall be the same for all participating component school districts
 and shall be computed in accordance with a uniform methodology  approved
 annually  by  at  least  three-quarters  of  the participating component
 school districts after consultation by local school officials with their
 respective boards; provided, however, such unit cost shall be subject to
 A. 9760  42

 final adjustment for programs for students with  disabilities  based  on
 actual participation in accordance with regulations of the commissioner.
 The  school authorities of each school district in the [board of cooper-
 ative  educational  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall add such
 amount to the budget of such school district and shall pay  such  amount
 to  the  treasurer of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, and shall be paid out  by  the  treasurer  upon
 orders  of  the  [board]  INSTITUTE  issued and executed pursuant to the
 resolution of said [board] INSTITUTE.
  2. a. If the [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECH-
 NICAL  INSTITUTE  determines  to  submit  a proposition to authorize the
 purchase or acquisition of sites or additions thereto and real  property
 and  to  construct  buildings  thereon  and  to  purchase  buildings and
 construct additions thereto, or to authorize the sale of any real  prop-
 erty  the  title  to which is vested in the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and  buildings  thereon  and
 appurtenances  or any part thereof, or to authorize the exchange of real
 property held by the [board  of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE for the purpose of improving or changing school
 sites, to the qualified voters of the [board of cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, then the [board] INSTITUTE shall
 call a meeting and submit to the qualified voters of the [board of coop-
 erative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE such a proposi-
 tion. The [board] INSTITUTE shall cause a notice of such meeting  to  be
 given  by  public  notice  of the time and place of such meeting once in
 each week within the four weeks next preceding such meeting,  the  first
 publication  to be at least twenty-five days before said meeting, in two
 newspapers if there shall be two, or in one newspaper if there shall  be
 but  one,  having  general  circulation within the [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, but  if  no  newspaper
 shall  then  have  general circulation therein, the said notice shall be
 posted in at least twenty of the most public places in  said  [board  of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE twenty-five
 days before the time of such meeting. Such notice shall contain a state-
 ment of the proposition or propositions to be submitted at such meeting.
  b.  Such  notice  and  all  other  notices  and reports required to be
 published in newspapers under the provisions of this  chapter  shall  be
 printed  at the rates and for the fees prescribed in section eight thou-
 sand seven of the civil practice law and rules. In the  event  that  the
 publishers  of  one or both of the newspapers having general circulation
 in such district shall refuse  to  print  and  publish  the  notices  or
 reports at the rates and for the fees so prescribed, publication in such
 newspaper  or  newspapers  so refusing may be omitted, in which case the
 notices or reports shall be posted as required by this section  in  lieu
 of such publication.
  c.  A person shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of the voters of
 the [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL  INSTI-
 TUTE who is:

  d. If a person offering to vote at any meeting of the  voters  of  the
 [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 shall be challenged as unqualified by any legal voter  of  such  [board]
 INSTITUTE  at such meeting, the chairman presiding at such meeting shall
 require  the person so offering to make the following declaration: "I do
 declare and affirm that I am, and have been, for the  thirty  days  last
 past,  an  actual  resident  of  this  [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE and that I am qualified to vote  at
 this  meeting."  Every person making such declaration shall be permitted

 the  vote  at such meeting.  Before any such machine is used at any such
 meeting, the inspectors of election shall examine it and  see  that  all
 the  counters are set at zero (000) and that the ballot labels are prop-
 erly placed, and that the machine is in all respects in proper condition
 for use. The use of such machine shall be deemed a compliance  with  any
 provision of law requiring the vote to be by ballot. The [board of coop-
 erative  educational  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE may purchase
 the necessary voting machine or machines; or  if  the  county  board  of
 elections  shall  consent thereto, such machines belonging to the county
 or belonging to the town in which any part of said [board of cooperative

 used at any such meeting, the expense  of  delivery  and  returning  and
 setting  up, and any other expense connected therewith shall be defrayed

 INSTITUTE;  but  such  machines  belonging to the county shall not be so
 used at the time or times when they may be required under  the  election
 law.
  h.  The  [board  of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL

 such meeting.  The  clerk  of  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  shall  give  written  notice of
 appointment to the person so  appointed.  If  the  person  appointed  as
 chairman  refuses  to  accept  such  appointment, or fails to serve, the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 may  appoint  a qualified voter of the [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to fill the  vacancy.  The  meeting
 shall be called to order by the chairman.

 the persons so appointed as assistant clerks.  If a person appointed  as
 assistant  clerk  refuses to accept such appointment, or fails to serve,
 the [board] INSTITUTE may appoint a qualified voter  of  the  [board  of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to fill the
 vacancy.  Each  assistant clerk shall be entitled to compensation at a
 rate to be fixed by the [board] INSTITUTE  for  each  day  actually  and
 necessarily spent upon the duties of his office. The clerk and assistant
 clerk  or  clerks of the meeting shall keep an accurate and true written
 record of all proceedings of the meeting and  shall  file  such  written
 record with the clerk of the [board of cooperative educational services]
 NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE within twenty-four hours after the meeting.
  j.  The  [board]  INSTITUTE  shall appoint two qualified voters of the
 [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE
 for  each ballot box to be used to act as inspectors of election at such
 meeting. The clerk of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall give written notice of appointment to  the
 persons  so  appointed.  If  a person appointed as inspector of election
 refuses to accept such appointment, or fails to  serve,  the  board  may
 appoint  a  qualified  voter  of  the  [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to  fill  the  vacancy.  Additional
 inspectors  of election may be appointed in the same manner when, in the
 opinion of the [board] INSTITUTE, special circumstances exist  requiring
 the  services  of such additional inspectors. The inspectors of election
 shall, before the polls are opened, organize  by  naming  one  of  their
 number  as chief inspector of election. Each inspector of election shall
 be entitled to compensation at a rate to be fixed by the [board]  INSTI-
 TUTE  for each day actually and necessarily spent upon the duties of his
 office.
  k. A poll list containing the name and legal residence of every person
 whose vote shall be received shall be kept by the  clerk  and  assistant
 clerk or clerks of the meeting.

 ative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE provide a suit-
 able box or boxes in which the ballots, folded  so  as  to  conceal  the
 marking  thereon,  shall be deposited as they are received, and shall in
 like manner provide a voting booth or booths and  the  voters  shall  be
 required  to enter such booth or booths for the purpose of marking their
 ballots.
  m. The [board] INSTITUTE shall cause printed ballots to  be  prepared,
 setting  forth  the proposition or propositions to be voted upon, in the

 the meeting is held at or before the time of closing the polls shall  be
 allowed to vote.
  o.  Immediately upon the close of the polls the inspectors of election
 shall canvass the ballots in the same manner as ballots are canvassed at
 a meeting of a union free school district. The chairman of  the  meeting
 shall  declare  to the meeting the result of each ballot as announced to
 him by the inspectors of election, and those  propositions  receiving  a
 majority  of  the votes of the voters present and voting shall be deemed
 approved.
 A. 9760  45
 
  p. The meeting of the voters of the [board of cooperative  educational
 services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  shall  be conducted in the same
 manner as a meeting of the voters of a union free school district.
  q. If the [board] INSTITUTE shall so determine it may cause the [board
 of  cooperative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to be
 divided into election districts provided  that  in  each  such  election
 district  the  number  of  qualified  voters  shall at least equal seven
 hundred. If such resolution be adopted it shall  divide  the  [board  of
 cooperative  educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE into such
 number of election districts as the  [board]  INSTITUTE  may  determine,
 provided  that if circumstances will permit there shall be a schoolhouse
 in each election district or in  as  many  such  election  districts  as
 possible.  The  election districts so formed shall continue in existence
 until modified by resolution of the [board] INSTITUTE.  Such  resolution
 shall  accurately  describe  the  boundaries  of  each  such district by
 street, alley and highway or otherwise. Meetings of the  voters  of  the
 [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 shall be held thereafter in such election districts. The [board]  INSTI-
 TUTE  shall  designate the place within each election district where the
 meetings shall be held.  When  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE is divided into election districts,
 the  [board]  INSTITUTE  shall  cause  the  meeting  to  be held in each
 election district pursuant to the provisions  of  this  subdivision  and
 shall  appoint a chairman of the meeting, clerks and assistant clerks of
 the meeting and inspectors of election for each election  district.  The
 [board]  INSTITUTE  shall  designate  the election district in which the
 clerk of the [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNI-
 CAL  INSTITUTE  shall be present. Where the [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  has  been  divided  into
 election  districts,  the  inspectors  of  election shall make a written
 report of the results of the ballot, signed by all such  inspectors,  to
 the  chief  inspector  of  election of each election district. The chief
 inspector of election of each election district shall within twenty-four
 hours file such written report with the clerk of the [board  of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.  The [board]
 INSTITUTE shall thereupon within twenty-four hours tabulate and  declare
 the results of the ballot.
  r.  All  disputes concerning the validity of any meeting of the voters
 of a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE or of any of the acts of the officers  of  such  meeting  shall  be
 referred  to  the  commissioner  of  education for determination and his
 decisions in the matter shall be final and not subject  to  review.  The
 commissioner may in his discretion order a new meeting.
  s.  The  [board  of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL

  4. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the  contrary,
 upon  rating  a  teacher  or  a  principal  as developing or ineffective
 through an annual professional performance review conducted pursuant  to
 subdivision  two of this section, the school district or [board of coop-
 erative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall formulate
 and commence implementation of a teacher or principal  improvement  plan
 for  such  teacher  or  principal  as soon as practicable but in no case
 later than ten school days after the opening of classes for  the  school
 year.  Such improvement plan shall be consistent with the regulations of
 the commissioner and developed locally  through  negotiations  conducted
 pursuant  to article fourteen of the civil service law. Such improvement
 plan shall include, but need not be limited to, identification of needed
 areas of improvement, a timeline for achieving improvement,  the  manner

 NICAL INSTITUTE'S issuance and/or implementation of  the  terms  of  the
 teacher  or  principal improvement plan, as required under this section.
 Appeal  procedures  shall  provide for the timely and expeditious resol-
 ution of any appeal under this subdivision. The specifics of the  appeal
 procedure  shall  be  locally established through negotiations conducted
 pursuant to article fourteen of the civil  service  law.  An  evaluation
 which  is  the subject of an appeal shall not be sought to be offered in
 evidence or placed in evidence in any proceeding conducted  pursuant  to
 either  section  three  thousand twenty-a of this article or any locally
 negotiated alternate disciplinary procedure, until the appeal process is
 concluded.

 deny tenure to or terminate probationary teachers or probationary build-
 ing principals during the pendency of an appeal pursuant to this section
 for statutorily and constitutionally permissible reasons  including  the

 in consultation with an advisory committee consisting of representatives
 of teachers, principals,  superintendents  of  schools,  school  boards,
 school district and [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  officials  and other interested parties. The regu-
 lations shall also take into account any (i) professional teaching stan-
 dards; (ii) standards for professional contexts; and (iii) standards for
 a continuum of system support for teachers and principals  developed  in
 consultation with the advisory committee. Regulations promulgated pursu-
 ant  to  this  section  shall be effective no later than July first, two

 the contrary, all collective bargaining agreements applicable to  class-
 room  teachers or building principals entered into after July first, two
 thousand ten shall be consistent  with  requirements  of  this  section.
 Nothing  in  this section shall be construed to abrogate any conflicting
 provisions of any collective bargaining  agreement  in  effect  on  July
 first,  two thousand ten during the term of such agreement and until the
 entry into a successor collective bargaining  agreement,  provided  that
 notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, upon expira-
 tion  of  such term and the entry into a successor collective bargaining
 agreement the provisions of this  section  shall  apply.  Furthermore,
 nothing  in  this section or in any rule or regulation promulgated here-
 under shall in any way, alter, impair or diminish the rights of a  local

 in accordance with article fourteen of the civil service  law  with  the
 school  district or [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
  9. a. The department shall annually monitor  and  analyze  trends  and
 patterns in teacher and principal evaluation results and data to identi-
 fy  school  districts,  [boards  of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES and/or schools where evidence suggests  that  a

 ness  and student learning outcomes. The criteria for identifying school
 districts, [boards of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTES  and/or schools shall be prescribed in the regulations of the
 commissioner.
  b. A school, school district  or  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE identified by the department in one
 of  the  categories enumerated in paragraph a of this subdivision may be
 highlighted in public  reports  and/or  the  commissioner  may  order  a
 corrective  action  plan,  which  may  include,  but  not be limited to,

 the public and the department the final quality  ratings  and  composite
 effectiveness scores from the annual professional performance reviews of
 its teachers and principals as provided in this subdivision.
  a.  The  commissioner  shall  fully  disclose professional performance
 review data for teachers and principals  in  each  school  district  and
 [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 on the department website and in any other  manner  to  make  such  data
 widely  available  to  the  public.  Such  data  shall  be  suitable for
 research, analysis and comparison  of  professional  performance  review
 data  for  teachers and principals. Such public disclosure shall include
 but not be limited to the final quality ratings and composite effective-
 ness scores by school district for principal evaluation data, by  school
 building  for  teacher  evaluation  data  and,  within each district and
 school building, by class, subject and grade; final quality ratings  and
 composite effectiveness scores by region, district wealth, district need
 category,  student  enrollment,  type of school (i.e. elementary, middle
 and high school), student  need  (e.g.,  poverty  level),  and  district
 spending;  final  quality  ratings and composite effectiveness scores by
 the percentage or number of teachers and principals in each final quali-
 ty rating category, moving to a higher rating category than the previous
 year, moving to a lower rating category  than  the  previous  year,  and
 retained in each rating category; and data on tenure granting and denial
 based on the final quality rating categories.
  b.  Each  school  district  and  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall fully disclose and release to
 the parents and legal guardians of a student the  final  quality  rating
 and  composite  effectiveness score for each of the teachers and for the
 principal of the school building to which the student  is  assigned  for
 the current school year upon the request of such parents and legal guar-
 dians.  The governing body of each school district and [board of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  shall  provide
 conspicuous notice to parents and legal guardians of the right to obtain
 such  information.  Parents  and  legal guardians may review and receive
 such data in any manner, including by phone or in person; shall  receive
 an  oral  or  written explanation of the composite effectiveness scoring
 ranges for final quality ratings; and be offered opportunities to under-
 stand such scores in the  context  of  teacher  evaluation  and  student
 performance.  Reasonable  efforts  shall be made to verify that any such
 A. 9760  97
 
 request is a bona fide request by  a  parent  or  guardian  entitled  to
 review and receive such data pursuant to this paragraph.
  c.  The  department and each school district and [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall ensure  that  any
 release to the public of annual professional performance review data, or
 any  other  data  that  is  used  as  a component of annual professional
 performance reviews, does not include personally identifying information
 for any teacher or principal,  provided,  however,  that  nothing  shall
 impair  the  right  of parents and legal guardians to review and receive
 the final quality rating and composite effectiveness score of individual
 teachers and principals as provided in paragraph b of this  subdivision.
 Annual professional performance reviews of individual teachers and prin-
 cipals shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to article six of the
 public officers law.

 have  been  in the district superintendent of schools' discretion quali-
 fied for appointment on tenure based upon  performance,  notwithstanding
 that  his  or  her  annual  professional performance review had not been
 completed and he or she had not received an annual professional perform-
 ance rating for the two  thousand  nineteen--two  thousand  twenty,  two
 thousand twenty--two thousand twenty-one or the two thousand twenty-one-

 twelve-c  or  section  three thousand twelve-d of this article for three
 consecutive years, no ratings shall be required for the district  super-
 intendent of schools to recommend for appointment on tenure such teacher
 or  building  principal  if the teacher or principal would have been, in
 the  district  superintendent  of  schools'  discretion,  qualified  for
 appointment  on  tenure based upon performance, notwithstanding that his
 or her annual professional performance review had not been completed and
 he or she had not received an  annual  professional  performance  review
 rating  for the two thousand nineteen--two thousand twenty, two thousand

 section  to the contrary, when a teacher or principal receives an effec-
 tive or highly effective rating in each year of his or her  probationary
 service  except  he  or  she receives an ineffective rating in the final
 year of his or her probationary period, such teacher shall not be eligi-
 ble for tenure but the board of education in its discretion, may  extend
 the  teacher's  probationary  period  for  an additional year; provided,
 however that if such teacher or  principal  successfully  appealed  such
 ineffective  rating,  such  teacher  or  principal  shall immediately be
 eligible for tenure if the rating resulting from the appeal  established
 that  such individual has been effective or highly effective in at least
 three of the preceding four years and was not ineffective in  the  final
 year. At the expiration of the probationary period, the classroom teach-
 A. 9760  101
 
 er  or  building principal shall remain in probationary status until the
 end of the school year in which such teacher or principal  has  received
 such  ratings of effective or highly effective for at least three of the
 four  preceding school years, exclusive of any breaks in service, during
 which time a [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNI-
 CAL INSTITUTE shall consider whether to grant tenure for those classroom
 teachers or building principals who otherwise have been found competent,
 efficient  and satisfactory. Provided, however, that the [board of coop-
 erative educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  may  grant
 tenure  contingent  upon  a  classroom teacher's or building principal's
 receipt of a minimum rating in the final year of the probationary  peri-
 od, pursuant to the requirements of this section, and if such contingen-
 cy is not met after all appeals have been exhausted, the grant of tenure
 shall  be void and unenforceable and the teacher's or principal's proba-
 tionary period may be extended in accordance with this subdivision. Such
 persons shall hold their respective positions during good  behavior  and
 competent  and efficient service and shall not be removed except for any
 of the following causes, after a hearing, as provided by  section  three
 thousand  twenty-a  or  section three thousand twenty-b of this article:
 (i) Insubordination, immoral character or conduct unbecoming a  teacher;
 (ii)  Inefficiency,  incompetency,  or neglect of duty; (iii) Failure to

  §  3014-b.  Teachers'  rights  as a result of a school district taking

 ant and teacher aide in such [board of cooperative educational services]
 NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, with the right  of  selection  passing  from
 such  teachers,  teaching  assistants  and  teacher  aides with the most
 seniority to such teachers, teaching assistants and teacher  aides  with

 ered  employees of such school districts, shall be placed on a preferred
 eligible list in all such school districts in the method and with all of
 the rights provided by the other provisions of this section.

 any  of  such  employees  set forth in this section granted by any other

 providers  of career education as set forth annually by the commissioner
 as eligible recipients under the federal  vocational  education  act  of

  2.  Allocations.  The  commissioner shall allocate the lesser of forty
 thousand dollars or one percent  of  the  total  appropriation  for  the
 purposes of this section to each region for administering and conducting
 employer specific skill training and employment programs and the remain-
 der  of  such  appropriation  shall  be allocated to each region for the

 employment  programs  based on the proportion of the base year full time
 teachers in the public schools of all school districts  and  [boards  of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES within the
 region  to  the  total  of such teachers in the state, provided however,
 that each region shall receive at least five percent of  the  allocation
 for  such  purposes  and provided further that the cost due to such five
 percent allowance shall be proportionally borne by the  regions  not  so

 of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE  employ-
 ing  such teacher during the same school year as such business or indus-
 try employment occurs, certify to the commissioner that the summer  work
 experience involved will directly benefit the individual's effectiveness
 as a teacher of mathematics, chemistry, biology, earth science, physics,
 computer  science,  career  education,  or  other  subject  areas as the
 commissioner may deem appropriate. If such chief administrative  officer
 so  certifies,  then  such  officer shall also file the request with the
 local education agency designated by the commissioner  for  pre-approval
 for funding under this program in the applicable region. The commission-
 er  shall not approve any requests for approval that would result in the
 maximum allocation for the applicable region being exceeded. No approval
 shall be given except for the lesser of thirty per centum of  the  total
 employment  cost  or  one  thousand  dollars  per  employed teacher. The
 remainder of  such  costs  shall  be  borne  by  the  business  employer
 involved.  Participation  in this program shall be at the option of each
 school district or [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE.

 istrative officer of the school district or [board of cooperative educa-
 tional  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  as  the case may be, as
 prescribed in this subdivision.

  2.  Each  board  of  education  or  [board  of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE which applies for funds under  this
 section  shall prepare a plan for implementation of a mentor teacher-in-
 ternship program consistent with article fourteen of the  civil  service
 law.  The  plan  shall  be developed in accordance with this section and
 regulations of the commissioner. The board of  education  or  [board  of
 cooperative  educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  shall
 submit an application and plan by May first  of  the  current  year  for
 approval  by the commissioner; provided however for the nineteen hundred
 ninety-seven--ninety-eight school year, such plan may  be  submitted  by

 from a list of persons who have demonstrated their mastery  of  pedagog-
 ical  and  subject  matter  skills,  given evidence of superior teaching
 abilities and interpersonal relationship qualities, and who  have  indi-
 cated  their  willingness  to  participate in such program. Such list of
 persons eligible to serve as mentor teachers shall  be  developed  by  a

 by  the  school  district  or  the  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, a majority of whom shall be class-
 room teachers chosen by the certified or  recognized  teachers  employee
 organization.  The  assignment of particular mentor teachers and teacher

 as a mentor teacher shall not diminish or impair the tenure and  senior-
 ity rights of the mentor teacher.
  4.  Each  board  of  education  and  [board of cooperative educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE which determines to participate  in
 the  mentor  teacher-internship  program  shall  require  those first or
 second year eligible teachers which it chooses to include in the program
 to perform their duties under the guidance  of  a  mentor  teacher,  and
 A. 9760  108
 
 shall  ensure  that  such teacher intern and mentor carry no more than a
 ninety percent classroom instruction assignment in order to  allow  such
 teacher intern time to receive special assistance from a mentor teacher.
 In  order to participate as a teacher intern in a mentor teacher-intern-
 ship program, a first or second year teacher shall hold a provisional or
 permanent teaching certificate,  temporary  emergency  license,  regular
 license,  or  temporary  per  diem  certificate  for a field in which no

 such program in the previous year.
  5. A school district or [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE participating in an approved mentor  teacher-in-
 ternship program in the current year shall be eligible for aid including
 but  not  limited  to  costs  related  to release time of the intern and
 mentor teacher up to ten percent of the mentor teacher's salary  and  up

 with  the  provisions of this subdivision. To receive such assistance, a
 school district or [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLY-
 TECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  must file a claim with the commissioner by October
 first of the current school year in a form prescribed by the commission-
 er which shall include the actual salary of each program participant  as

 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE which participates in  the  program
 shall  file  a report with the commissioner on or before August first of
 each school year concerning compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the
 program  during the preceding school year.  Such report shall be in such
 form and in such manner as the commissioner may require. The commission-
 er shall evaluate such programs and file a report with  the  legislature
 on or before December first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven.

 manner. For the purposes of this section,  the  term  "criminal  history
 record" shall mean a record of all convictions of crimes and any pending

 POLYTECHNICAL  INSITUTE, or nonpublic or private elementary or secondary
 school whether the prospective employee to which such report relates  is
 cleared  for  employment  based  upon  his  or her criminal history. All
 determinations to grant or deny clearance  for  employment  pursuant  to
 this paragraph shall be performed in accordance with subdivision sixteen
 of section two hundred ninety-six of the executive law and article twen-

 the prospective employee and the appropriate  school  district,  charter
 school,  [board  of  cooperative  educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 INSITUTE, or nonpublic or private elementary or  secondary  school  that
 the  prospective  employee to which such report relates is conditionally
 cleared for employment based upon his or her criminal  history  or  that
 more  time  is  needed  to  make  the determination. If the commissioner
 determines that more time is needed, the notification  shall  include  a
 good  faith  estimate  of  the  amount  of  additional time needed. Such
 notification shall be  made  within  fifteen  business  days  after  the
 commissioner  receives  the  prospective  employee's  fingerprints.  All
 determinations to grant or deny  conditional  clearance  for  employment
 pursuant  to this paragraph shall be performed in accordance with subdi-
 vision sixteen of section two hundred ninety-six of  the  executive  law
 and article twenty-three-A of the correction law.

 graph 1 of paragraph h as added by section 13 of part B of chapter 57 of
 the laws of 2007, subparagraph 1 of paragraph f as amended by section 12
 of  part  B  of  chapter  57 of the laws of 2008, are amended to read as
 follows:
  (4) Resident weighted average daily attendance for purposes of  deter-
 mining  the  aid ratio of a school district for any school year shall be
 the weighted average daily attendance for the  school  year  immediately
 preceding  the  base year, less the weighted average daily attendance of
 nonresident pupils attending public schools in  the  district  for  such
 school  year, plus the weighted average daily attendance of pupils resi-
 dent in the district but attending public schools in another district or
 state plus the weighted average daily attendance of pupils  resident  in
 the  district  but  attending full-time a school operated by a [board of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE or a county
 vocational education and extension  board  for  such  school  year.  The
 attendance of nonresident pupils attending public school in the district
 and resident pupils attending such schools outside of the district shall
 be determined by applying to the number of such pupils registered during
 the  school  year in each case the ratio of aggregate days attendance to
 the possible aggregate days attendance of all pupils  in  attendance  in
 the district. Indian pupils of a reservation attending public school, or
 pupils  living  on  the United States military reservation at West Point
 attending public school, shall be deemed to be resident  pupils  of  the
 district  providing such school, for purposes of this paragraph. Where a
 school district has entered into a contract with  the  state  university
 pursuant  to subdivision two of section three hundred fifty-five of this
 chapter under which the school district makes payments in the nature  of
 tuition  for the education of certain children residing in the district,
 such children for whom such tuition payments are made shall be deemed to
 be resident pupils of such district for the purposes of this paragraph.
  (1) Total wealth pupil units will be computed using the adjusted aver-
 age daily attendance for the year prior to the base year as computed  in
 this  section,  plus  the attendance of resident pupils attending public
 school elsewhere, less the attendance of  nonresident  pupils  plus  the
 attendance  of  resident pupils attending full-time in [board of cooper-
 ative educational services] A NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE (not  otherwise
 specifically  included),  plus  the  additional  aidable  pupil units as
 computed pursuant to paragraphs c and d of this  subdivision,  excluding
 summer  school  pupils,  plus  the  year prior to the base year resident
 weighted pupils with disabilities. The attendance of nonresident  pupils
 attending  public  school  in the district and resident pupils attending
 A. 9760  119
 
 such schools outside of the district shall be determined by applying  to
 the number of such pupils registered during the school year in each case
 the  ratio  of  aggregate days attendance to the possible aggregate days
 attendance  of all pupils in attendance in the district. Native American
 pupils of a reservation attending public school, or pupils living on the
 United States  military  reservation  at  West  Point  attending  public
 school,  shall be deemed to be resident pupils of the district providing
 such school, for purposes of this paragraph. Where a school district has
 entered into a contract with state university  pursuant  to  subdivision
 two  of section three hundred fifty-five of this chapter under which the
 school district makes payment in the nature of tuition for the education
 of certain children residing in the district,  such  children  for  whom
 such  tuition payments are made shall be deemed to be resident pupils of
 such district for the purposes of this paragraph.
  (1) Total wealth foundation pupil units shall  mean  the  sum  of  (i)
 average daily membership for the year prior to the base year as computed
 in  this section, plus (ii) the full-time equivalent enrollment of resi-
 dent pupils attending public school elsewhere, less the full-time equiv-
 alent enrollment of nonresident pupils, plus (iii) the full-time  equiv-
 alent  enrollment  of  resident  pupils attending full-time in [board of
 cooperative educational services]  A  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE  (not
 otherwise  specifically included).  Native American pupils of a reserva-
 tion attending public school, or pupils  living  on  the  United  States
 military  reservation  at  West  Point attending public school, shall be
 deemed to be resident pupils of the district providing such school,  for
 purposes  of  this paragraph. Where a school district has entered into a
 contract with state university pursuant to subdivision  two  of  section
 three hundred fifty-five of this chapter under which the school district
 makes  payment  in  the  nature  of tuition for the education of certain
 children residing in the district, such children for whom  such  tuition
 payments are made shall be deemed to be resident pupils of such district
 for the purposes of this paragraph.
  §  131.  Paragraph f of subdivision 3 of section 3602 of the education
 law, as added by section 13 of part B of chapter 57 of the laws of 2007,
 is amended to read as follows:
  f. The [board of cooperative educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  aid  ratio shall equal the greater of: (1) an amount equal to
 one minus the quotient expressed as a decimal to  three  places  without
 rounding  of  eight  mills divided by the tax rate of the local district
 computed upon the actual valuation of taxable  property,  as  determined
 pursuant  to  subdivision one of this section, expressed in mills to the
 nearest tenth as determined by the commissioner, provided, however, that
 where services are provided to a school district which is included with-
 in a central high school district or to a central high school  district,
 such amount shall equal one minus the quotient expressed as a decimal to
 three  places  without rounding of three mills divided by the tax rates,
 expressed in mills to the nearest tenth, of such  districts,  as  deter-
 mined  by the commissioner or (2) an amount computed by subtracting from
 one the product obtained by multiplying the  resident  weighted  average
 daily attendance wealth ratio by fifty-one percent. Such aid ratio shall
 be  expressed  as a decimal carried to three places without rounding but
 shall not be less than thirty-six percent and shall not be greater  than
 ninety percent.
  §  132.  Subdivision 10, paragraphs a, d, and f of subdivision 11, and

 opening paragraph and clause (A) of subparagraph (viii) of paragraph  b,
 subdivision  17  as  added  by section 37 of part A of chapter 58 of the
 laws of 2011, are amended to read as follows:
  10. Special services aid for large city  school  districts  and  other
 school  districts  which  were not components of a [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in the  base  year.  a.
 The  city  school districts of those cities having populations in excess
 of one hundred twenty-five thousand and any other school district  which
 was  not a component of a [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in the base year shall be entitled to an  appor-
 tionment under the provisions of this section.
  b.  Aid  for career education. There shall be apportioned to such city
 school districts and other school districts which were not components of
 a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 in the base year for pupils in grades ten through twelve  in  attendance
 in career education programs as such programs are defined by the commis-
 sioner,  subject  for  the purposes of this paragraph to the approval of
 the director of the budget, an amount for each such pupil to be computed
 by multiplying the career education aid ratio  by  three  thousand  nine
 hundred  dollars. Such aid will be payable for weighted pupils attending
 career education programs  operated  by  the  school  district  and  for
 weighted  pupils for whom such school district contracts with [boards of
 cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES to  attend
 career  education  programs  operated  by a [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.  Weighted  pupils  for  the
 purposes  of  this  paragraph  shall  mean  the sum of the attendance of
 students in grades ten through twelve in career education  sequences  in
 trade,  industrial,  technical, agricultural or health programs plus the
 product of sixteen hundredths multiplied by the attendance  of  students
 in  grades  ten through twelve in career education sequences in business
 and marketing as defined by the commissioner in regulations. The  career
 education  aid ratio shall be computed by subtracting from one the prod-
 uct obtained by multiplying fifty-nine percent by  the  combined  wealth
 ratio.  This  aid ratio shall be expressed as a decimal carried to three
 places without rounding, but not less than thirty-six percent.
  Any school district that receives aid pursuant to this paragraph shall
 be required to use such amount to support career education  programs  in
 the current year.
  A board of education which spends less than its local funds as defined
 by regulations of the commissioner for career education in the base year
 during the current year shall have its apportionment under this subdivi-
 sion  reduced  in an amount equal to such deficiency in the current or a
 succeeding school year, provided however that the commissioner may waive
 such reduction upon determination that overall expenditures per pupil in
 support of career education programs were continued at a level equal  to
 A. 9760  121
 
 or  greater than the level of such overall expenditures per pupil in the
 preceding school year.
  c. Computer administration aid for large city school districts and any
 other  school  district which was not a component of a [board of cooper-
 ative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in the base year.
 The city school districts of those cities having populations  in  excess
 of  one  hundred  twenty-five  thousand inhabitants and any other school
 district which was not a component of a  [board  of  cooperative  educa-
 tional  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in the base year shall be
 eligible for an apportionment in accordance with the provisions of  this
 subdivision.  Such  districts  shall be entitled to an additional appor-
 tionment computed by multiplying the lesser of (1) expenses for approved
 computer services in the base year or (2) the maximum allowable  expense
 equal  to  the  product  of  sixty-two  dollars and thirty cents and the
 enrollment of pupils attending the public schools of  such  district  in
 the  base  year,  by  the  computer  expenses  aid ratio.  The computer
 expenses aid ratio shall be computed by subtracting from one the product
 obtained by multiplying fifty-one per  centum  by  the  combined  wealth
 ratio.  This  aid ratio shall be expressed as a decimal carried to three
 places without rounding, but shall not be less than thirty  per  centum.
 Expenses for approved computer services in the base year up to the maxi-
 mum  allowable  expense  shall  not be used to claim aid pursuant to any
 other provisions of this section.
  d. Aid for academic improvement. There shall be  apportioned  to  such
 city  school  districts and other school districts which were not compo-
 nents of a [board of cooperative educational services] NY  POLYTECHNICAL
 INSTITUTE  in the base year, an amount per pupil for each pupil eligible
 for aid pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivision to  be  computed  by
 multiplying  the  career  education  aid ratio computed pursuant to such
 paragraph b of this subdivision by the sum of (1)  one  hundred  dollars
 plus  (2)  the quotient of one thousand dollars divided by the lesser of
 one or the combined wealth ratio. Aid for academic improvement shall  be
 unrestricted  general  aid available to support any academic programs of
 the school district.
  e. Career education data collection. Beginning  in  the  two  thousand
 seventeen--two  thousand  eighteen  school  year  the commissioner shall
 collect data from school districts receiving aid under this  subdivision
 on  the  number  of students in the base year that are in grade nine and
 enrolled in career  education  courses  in  trade/industrial  education,
 technical  education,  agricultural education, health occupations educa-
 tion, business and marketing  education,  family  and  consumer  science
 education,  and  technology education programs in a manner prescribed by
 the commissioner.
  a. School districts and [boards of  cooperative  educational  services
 (BOCES)]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES providing approved programs shall
 be eligible for aid in accordance with the provisions of  this  subdivi-
 sion  for  the attendance of persons twenty-one years of age or over who
 have not received a high school diploma or  a  high  school  equivalency
 diploma  recognized  by New York State who attend employment preparation
 education programs provided by such school districts or [BOCES] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTES, which programs lead to a high  school  diploma  or
 high school equivalency diploma as defined in regulations of the commis-
 sioner,  even  if  such  persons  attend regular day school classes with
 permission of the board of education; provided that  such  programs  are
 provided  in  accordance  with a plan of service approved by the commis-
 sioner in accordance with the provisions of paragraph f of this subdivi-
 A. 9760  122
 
 sion. Such programs may operate between July first and June thirtieth of
 a school year. Whenever a person enrolls in a program approved  pursuant
 to  this  subdivision offered by a [BOCES] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE or
 in a school district other than their district of residence, the program
 provider  shall send a notice of such enrollment to the persons district
 of residence, and shall issue a new notice if such person moves from one
 district to another. In the event that the cost of  a  program  approved
 and  provided  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of this subdivision
 exceeds all sources of funds, other than tax levy  revenues,  which  are
 available  to  defray  such  expenses, the school district or [BOCES] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE providing such program shall determine an excess
 cost per contact hour provided during the  base  year,  and  then  shall
 determine  the local share of such excess costs for each school district
 whose residents were served by such program  by  multiplying  such  base
 year  hours  by  the  excess cost per contact hour, and such local share
 shall be a charge against each such district, payable within  forty-five
 days.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of section nineteen hundred fifty
 of this chapter, a [BOCES] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE shall  be  author-
 ized  to  provide  a  program  pursuant  to this subdivision in the same
 manner as a school district.
  d. Employment preparation education aid ratio. The employment prepara-
 tion education aid ratio for the purposes of this subdivision  shall  be
 determined by subtracting from one the product of the pupil wealth ratio
 and  forty  per centum. The aid ratio shall be expressed as a decimal to
 three places without rounding but shall  not  be  less  than  forty  per
 centum.  In  the  case of a [BOCES] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, such aid
 ratio shall be determined by computing a  pupil  wealth  ratio  for  the
 [BOCES]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE using the aggregate actual valuation
 and total wealth pupil units for all component districts of such [BOCES]
 NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, but shall not be less than  the  greater  of
 forty  per centum or the product of eighty-five per centum and the high-
 est such aid ratio determined for a component school  district  of  such
 [BOCES] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE.
  f. Approved application. All school districts and [BOCES] NY POLYTECH-
 NICAL INSTITUTES desiring to operate an aidable program pursuant to this
 subdivision shall complete an application, including a budget by program
 component. Such application shall be in a form prescribed by the commis-
 sioner  and  shall  be  submitted  not  later than May fifteenth of each
 school year. Within forty-five days of such deadline,  and  upon  evalu-
 ation  of  such  applications,  the  commissioner  shall  notify  school
 districts and [BOCES] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES of those  portions  of
 such  application  that  will  be aidable in the school year ahead after
 making a determination that approval of  such  application  will  assure
 maximum  effectiveness,  geographic availability and lack of duplication
 of such programs, support for educational  initiatives,  and  compliance
 with required program and fiscal reporting requirements. No aid shall be
 payable  pursuant to this subdivision unless the application is approved
 by the commissioner.
  The gap elimination adjustment for the two thousand eleven--two  thou-
 sand  twelve  school  year  shall  be  computed  as follows, based on an
 updated electronic date file containing actual and estimated data relat-
 ing to apportionments due and owing during the current school  year  and
 projections  of  such  apportionments  for  the following school year to
 school districts and [boards of  cooperative  educational  services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTES  from  the general support for public schools,
 growth and [boards of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL
 A. 9760  123
 
 INSTITUTES appropriations produced pursuant to paragraph b  of  subdivi-
 sion  twenty-one of section three hundred five of this chapter on Febru-
 ary fifteenth of the base year. The gap  elimination  adjustment  for  a
 district  shall  equal the lesser of the district's percentage reduction
 and its TGFE check, provided, however, that in the case  of  a  district
 with  a tax effort ratio greater than four percent (0.04) and a combined
 wealth ratio for total foundation aid computed pursuant to  subparagraph
 two  of  paragraph  c  of subdivision three of this section that is less
 than one and five-tenths (1.5), the gap  elimination  adjustment  for  a
 district  shall  equal  the lesser of the percentage reduction, the TGFE
 check and the tax effort reduction, and further  provided  that  in  the
 case  of  a school district, other than a city school district of a city
 having a population in excess of one hundred twenty-five thousand,  with
 (A) an administrative efficiency ratio of less than one and eight-tenths
 percent (0.018) and (B) an administrative expense per pupil of less than
 three hundred forty-eight dollars ($348), the gap elimination adjustment
 shall  be  reduced  by  an amount equal to the administrative efficiency
 restoration, and further provided that, where applicable, the gap elimi-
 nation adjustment shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of  the
 needs-based  restoration plus the low wealth-high tax effort restoration
 plus the enrollment adjustment award.
  (A) "total aid for adjustment" shall mean the sum of the  amounts  set
 forth  for each school district as "FOUNDATION AID", "FULL DAY K CONVER-
 SION", [BOCES] "NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE +  SPECIAL  SERVICES",  "HIGH
 COST  EXCESS  COST",  "PRIVATE  EXCESS  COST",  "HARDWARE & TECHNOLOGY",
 "SOFTWARE, LIBRARY, TEXTBOOK", "TRANSPORTATION INCL SUMMER",  "OPERATING
 REORG INCENTIVE", "CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSITIONAL", "ACADEMIC ENHANCEMENT",
 "HIGH  TAX  AID"  AND  "SUPPLEMENTAL  PUB EXCESS COST" under the heading
 "2011-12 ESTIMATED AIDS" in the school aid computer listing produced  by
 the commissioner in support of the executive budget proposal for the two
 thousand eleven--two thousand twelve school year;

 having populations in excess of one hundred twenty-five thousand  inhab-
 itants  that participate in, or provide, shared services for the purpose
 of instructional support service as authorized by subdivision eight-c of
 section nineteen hundred fifty of this chapter shall be eligible for  an
 additional apportionment in accordance with the provisions of this para-
 graph.  Within  the amount appropriated for such purpose, such districts
 shall be entitled to an  additional  apportionment  for  their  expenses
 incurred  in  the  base year from their participation in or provision of
 such shared services, in an amount equal to the  amount  that  would  be
 payable  for  such expenses if the services were aidable shared services
 under subdivision five of section nineteen hundred fifty of  this  chap-
 ter;  provided that in computing such aid for such city school districts
 the tax rate shall be determined in the manner prescribed  in  [subpara-

 PARAGRAPH E OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION THIRTY-SIX HUNDRED  NINE-E  OF
 THIS  PART.  Such apportionment shall be paid in accordance with section
 thirty-six  hundred  nine-a  of  this  [chapter]  PART. In the event the
 appropriation for purposes of this subdivision in any year  is  insuffi-
 cient  to  pay  all  claims  received  pursuant to this subdivision, the
 commissioner shall determine the percentage of the total claims  submit-
 ted  that  is  represented  by  each  district's  claim on file with the

 required by subdivision twenty-one of section three hundred five of this
 chapter and shall pay such claims based on such prorated basis among all
 districts  filing  such  claims  until  the  appropriation is exhausted,
 provided that such prorated apportionment computed  and  payable  as  of
 September  one  of the school year immediately following the school year
 for which such aid is claimed shall be deemed final and not  subject  to

 subparagraph  (ii)  of  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  9 as amended by

 read as follows:
  1. Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature
 or by a local law adopted prior to  September  first,  nineteen  hundred
 fifty-three,  all  contracts for public work involving an expenditure of
 more than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase  contracts
 involving  an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall be
 awarded by the appropriate officer,  board  or  agency  of  a  political
 subdivision  or  of  any district therein including but not limited to a
 soil conservation district to the lowest responsible  bidder  furnishing
 the  required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the manner
 provided by this section, provided,  however,  that  purchase  contracts
 (including  contracts  for  service  work,  but  excluding  any purchase
 contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursu-
 ant to article eight of the labor law) may be awarded on  the  basis  of
 best  value,  as defined in section one hundred sixty-three of the state
 finance law, to a responsive and responsible bidder or  offerer  in  the
 manner  provided  by this section except that in a political subdivision
 other than a city with a population of one million inhabitants  or  more
 or  any  district, board or agency with jurisdiction exclusively therein
 the use of best value for  awarding  a  purchase  contract  or  purchase
 contracts  must be authorized by local law or, in the case of a district
 corporation,  school  district  or  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, by rule, regulation or resolution
 adopted at a public meeting. In any case where a responsible bidder's or
 responsible offerer's gross price is reducible by an allowance  for  the
 value  of  used machinery, equipment, apparatus or tools to be traded in
 by a political subdivision, the gross price  shall  be  reduced  by  the
 amount of such allowance, for the purpose of determining the best value.
 In  cases  where two or more responsible bidders furnishing the required
 security submit identical bids as to price, such officer, board or agen-
 cy may award the contract to any of such bidders. Such officer, board or
 agency may, in his or her or its discretion, reject all bids  or  offers
 and  readvertise  for  new bids or offers in the manner provided by this
 section. In determining whether a purchase is an expenditure within  the
 discretionary  threshold  amounts  established  by this subdivision, the
 officer, board or agency of a political subdivision or of  any  district
 therein  shall  consider the reasonably expected aggregate amount of all
 purchases of the same commodities, services or  technology  to  be  made
 within  the  twelve-month  period  commencing  on  the date of purchase.
 Purchases of commodities, services or  technology  shall  not  be  arti-
 ficially  divided for the purpose of satisfying the discretionary buying
 thresholds established by this subdivision. A change to or a renewal  of
 a discretionary purchase shall not be permitted if the change or renewal
 would bring the reasonably expected aggregate amount of all purchases of
 the  same  commodities,  services  or  technology from the same provider
 within the twelve-month period commencing  on  the  date  of  the  first
 purchase  to  an  amount greater than the discretionary buying threshold
 amount. For purposes of this section, "sealed bids" and "sealed offers",
 as that term applies to purchase  contracts,  (including  contracts  for
 service  work,  but  excluding  any purchase contracts necessary for the
 completion of a public works contract pursuant to article eight  of  the
 A. 9760  146
 
 labor  law)  shall  include  bids  and offers submitted in an electronic
 format including submission of the statement of  non-collusion  required
 by  section  one  hundred  three-d  of  this  article, provided that the
 governing board of the political subdivision or district, by resolution,
 has authorized the receipt of bids and offers in such format. Submission
 in  electronic format may, for technology contracts only, be required as
 the sole method for the submission of bids and offers. Bids  and  offers
 submitted  in  an  electronic format shall be transmitted by bidders and
 offerers to the receiving device designated by the political subdivision
 or district. Any method used to receive electronic bids and offers shall
 comply with article three of the state technology law, and any rules and
 regulations promulgated and guidelines developed thereunder  and,  at  a
 minimum,  must (a) document the time and date of receipt of each bid and
 offer received electronically; (b)  authenticate  the  identity  of  the
 sender;  (c) ensure the security of the information transmitted; and (d)
 ensure the confidentiality of the bid or offer until the time  and  date
 established  for the opening of bids or offers. The timely submission of
 an electronic bid or offer in compliance with instructions provided  for
 such submission in the advertisement for bids or offers and/or the spec-
 ifications  shall be the responsibility solely of each bidder or offerer
 or prospective bidder or offerer. No political subdivision  or  district
 therein shall incur any liability from delays of or interruptions in the
 receiving device designated for the submission and receipt of electronic
 bids and offers.
  9.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions of this section to the
 contrary, a board of education, on behalf of its school district,  or  a
 [board  of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE,
 may separately purchase eggs, livestock, fish, dairy products (excluding
 milk), juice, grains, and species of fresh fruit and vegetables directly
 from New York State producers or growers, or associations  of  producers
 and growers, provided that:
  (a)  (i)  such association of producers or growers is comprised of ten
 or fewer owners of farms who  also  operate  such  farms  and  who  have
 combined to fill the order of a school district or [board of cooperative
 educational  services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE as herein authorized,
 provided however, that a school district or [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE may apply to the commission-
 er of education for permission to purchase from an association  of  more
 than  ten  owners  of such farms when no other producers or growers have
 offered to sell to such school  or  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE; or
  (ii)  such  association of producers or growers is comprised of owners
 of farms who also operate such farms and have combined to fill the order
 of a school district or [board of cooperative educational  services]  NY
 POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,  and where such order is for one hundred thou-
 sand dollars or less as herein  authorized,  provided  however,  that  a
 school  district or [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLY-
 TECHNICAL INSTITUTE may apply  to  the  commissioner  of  education  for
 permission  to purchase orders of more than one hundred thousand dollars
 from an association of owners of such farms when no other  producers  or
 growers have offered to sell to such school;
  (b) the amount that may be expended by a school district in any fiscal
 year for such purchases shall not exceed an amount equal to twenty cents
 multiplied  by the total number of days in the school year multiplied by
 the total enrollment of such school district;
 A. 9760  147
 
  (b-1) the amount that may be  expended  by  a  [board  of  cooperative
 educational  services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE in any fiscal year for
 such purchases shall not exceed an amount equal to twenty  cents  multi-
 plied  by  the total number of days in the school year multiplied by the
 number  of  students  receiving  services  by such [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE at facilities  operated
 by a [board of cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTI-
 TUTE;
  (c)  all  such purchases shall be administered pursuant to regulations
 promulgated by the commissioner of education. Such regulations shall: be
 developed in consultation  with  the  commissioner  of  agriculture  and
 markets  to accommodate and promote the provisions of the farm-to-school
 program established pursuant to subdivision five-b of section sixteen of
 the agriculture and markets law and subdivision  thirty-one  of  section
 three  hundred  five of the education law as added by chapter two of the
 laws of two thousand two; ensure that the prices paid by a  district  or
 [board  of  cooperative educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE
 for any items so purchased do not exceed the prices of comparable  local
 farm  products  that  are  available  to  districts  through their usual
 purchases of such items; ensure  that  all  producers  and  growers  who
 desire to sell to school districts or [boards of cooperative educational
 services]  NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTES can readily access information in
 accordance with the farm-to-school [law] PROGRAM; include provisions for
 situations when more than one producer or grower seeks to sell the  same
 product  to a district or [board of cooperative educational services] NY
 POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE to ensure that all  such  producers  or  growers
 have  an equitable opportunity to do so in a manner similar to the usual
 purchasing practices of such districts or [boards of cooperative  educa-
 tional  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTES; develop guidelines for
 approval of purchases of items from associations of more than ten  grow-
 ers  and  producers;  and,  to  the maximum extent practicable, minimize
 additional paperwork, recordkeeping and other  similar  requirements  on
 both growers and producers and school districts.
  §  193.  Subdivision 1 of section 103 of the general municipal law, as
 amended by section 2 of chapter 2 of the laws of  2012,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  1. Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature
 or  by  a  local  law adopted prior to September first, nineteen hundred
 fifty-three, all contracts for public work involving an  expenditure  of
 more  than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  and  all  purchase contracts
 involving an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall  be
 awarded  by  the  appropriate  officer,  board  or agency of a political
 subdivision or of any district therein including but not  limited  to  a
 soil  conservation  district to the lowest responsible bidder furnishing
 the required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the  manner
 provided  by  this  section,  provided, however, that purchase contracts
 (including contracts  for  service  work,  but  excluding  any  purchase
 contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursu-
 ant  to  article  eight of the labor law) may be awarded on the basis of
 best value, as defined in section one hundred sixty-three of  the  state
 finance  law,  to  a responsive and responsible bidder or offerer in the
 manner provided by this section except that in a  political  subdivision
 other  than  a city with a population of one million inhabitants or more
 or any district, board or agency with jurisdiction  exclusively  therein
 the  use  of  best  value  of  awarding  a purchase contract or purchase
 contracts must be authorized by local law or, in the case of a  district
 A. 9760  148
 
 corporation,  school  district  or  [board  of  cooperative  educational
 services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, by rule, regulation or  resolution
 adopted  at  a  public  meeting. In determining whether a purchase is an
 expenditure  within  the  discretionary threshold amounts established by
 this subdivision, the officer, board or agency of a  political  subdivi-
 sion  or  of any district therein shall consider the reasonably expected
 aggregate amount of all purchases of the same commodities,  services  or
 technology  to  be made within the twelve-month period commencing on the
 date of purchase. Purchases of commodities, services or technology shall
 not be artificially divided for the purpose of  satisfying  the  discre-
 tionary  buying  thresholds established by this subdivision. A change to
 or a renewal of a discretionary purchase shall not be permitted  if  the
 change  or  renewal would bring the reasonably expected aggregate amount
 of all purchases of the same commodities, services  or  technology  from
 the  same provider within the twelve-month period commencing on the date
 of the first purchase to an amount greater than the discretionary buying
 threshold amount. In any case where a responsible bidder's or  responsi-
 ble  offerer's gross price is reducible by an allowance for the value of
 used machinery, equipment, apparatus or tools to be traded in by a poli-
 tical subdivision, the gross price shall be reduced  by  the  amount  of
 such  allowance,  for  the  purpose  of  determining the low bid or best
 value. In cases where two or more  responsible  bidders  furnishing  the
 required security submit identical bids as to price, such officer, board
 or  agency  may award the contract to any of such bidders. Such officer,
 board or agency may, in his, her or its discretion, reject all  bids  or
 offers  and readvertise for new bids or offers in the manner provided by
 this section.

  § 201. Subdivision 24 of section 10 of the highway law, as amended  by
 chapter 540 of the laws of 1978, is amended to read as follows:
  24.  Have power, whenever such commissioner of transportation deems it
 is necessary as a result of  work  of  construction,  reconstruction  or
 maintenance  of  state  highways, to provide at the expense of the state
 for the removal, relocation, replacement  and  reconstruction  of  water
 mains,  sewer  pipes,  communication systems, fire alarm systems, street
 lighting, traffic control systems and any other similar facilities  that
 are  owned  by any municipality and are maintained for public use and to
 participate in the expense of the removal, relocation,  replacement  and
 reconstruction  of  all  other types of facilities or parts thereof that
 are owned by any municipality and are maintained  for  public  use,  the
 state's  share of such expense not to exceed the appraised value of such
 facilities or parts thereof, as the case may be, as  determined  by  the
 commissioner  of  transportation. However, in connection with any feder-
 ally funded highway project,  the  commissioner  of  transportation  may
 agree  to  pay  an  amount not to exceed the state's share, based on its
 proportionate share of the cost of the entire highway  project,  of  the
 functional  replacement cost of any of the aforesaid facilities owned by
 any municipal corporation, school district, [board of cooperative educa-
 tional services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE, public benefit  corporation
 or  any  other  state or municipal governmental agency where the federal
 government agrees to pay its share of such functional replacement  cost,
 which  shall  be  based  on  its  proportionate share of the cost of the
 entire project. If such work requires additional property or  if  it  is
 necessary  that the relocation of such facilities be made to other prop-
 erty, he may acquire such property as may be necessary for the  purposes
 of  this  subdivision,  in the same manner as other property is acquired
 for state highway purposes pursuant to this chapter, and  he  may  enter
 into  a  written agreement with the municipality involved to convey such
 property as deemed necessary for the purposes  of  this  subdivision  to
 such  municipality on terms beneficial to the state. The expense of such
 removal, relocation, replacement and reconstruction or the state's share
 thereof, as the case may be, shall be  a  proper  charge  against  funds
 available  for  the construction, reconstruction or maintenance of state
 highways, and such work may be performed by contract in the same  manner
 as  provided for state highways in article three of this chapter, or, by
 the use of departmental forces and equipment and of materials  purchased
 therefor.  However, if the commissioner of transportation deems it to be
 in  the  interest  of the public, he may contract with the municipality,
 upon such terms as he may deem advantageous to the state, to  have  such
 work  performed  (a)  by the employment of the forces and the use of the
 equipment of such municipality and by the use of any material on hand or
 necessary to be purchased by such municipality  or  (b)  by  such  other
 method  as such commissioner of transportation shall approve or (c) by a
 combination of the methods provided in this subdivision. Any such  muni-
 cipality  is  hereby  authorized  to  enter  into  such contract for the
 purposes of this subdivision. In all  cases  pursuant  to  this  section
 where  the  state  is to pay part of the expense of removal, relocation,
 replacement and reconstruction of any facilities  that  are  municipally
 owned and that are maintained for public use, the commissioner of trans-
 portation,  if  he deems it in the best interest of the state, may offer
 to remove, relocate, replace or  reconstruct  such  facilities  and  may
 prepare  plans,  specifications  and estimates of cost of such projects,
 together with an estimate of the share of the expense to be borne by the
 municipality, which shall be submitted to the governing  board  of  such
 A. 9760  153
 
 municipality.  If  the  municipality approves such plans, specifications
 and estimates of cost and share of the expense, it shall  by  resolution
 appropriate  the  funds  necessary  to  pay  its share of the expense. A
 certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the commissioner of
 transportation and with the state comptroller and the funds shall, prior
 to  the  award  of a contract, be deposited by the municipality with the
 state comptroller subject to the draft or requisition of the commission-
 er of transportation. Upon the completion and  acceptance  of  the  work
 such facilities shall be maintained by the municipality. As used in this
 subdivision,  the  term  "municipality"  shall  include  a  public water
 authority.

 [board] INSTITUTE to the authority as shown by the  certificate  of  the
 commissioner  of  education  filed  with  the comptroller as required by
 paragraph b of this subdivision.
  d. The state of New York hereby covenants with the purchasers, holders
 and owners from time to time of the bonds of the authority that it  will

  §  254.  Subdivision  4  of section 198 of the town law, as amended by

  4. Park districts. After a park district shall have been  established,
 the  town  board shall proceed to acquire by purchase or condemnation of
 the property described in the petition or in the  final  order,  if  the
 town  board  proceeded  under  article twelve-A of this chapter, for the
 establishment of such park district, and, thereafter the board may erect
 or cause to be erected thereon non-commercial buildings  and  structures
 and it may purchase necessary equipment and otherwise improve such prop-
 erty  for  park  purposes,  as the board may determine. In existing park
 districts, the town board  may  acquire  by  purchase,  condemnation  or
 lease,  property  for  public  parking  places  and maintain the same in
 accordance with the provisions of subdivision five hereof,  without  the
 establishment  of a public parking district. No property situated within
 an incorporated village or city shall be acquired in any manner for park
 purposes, unless the permission and consent of the board of trustees  of
 such  village or the common council or legislative body of such city, is
 first obtained; provided that such permission and consent,  if  obtained
 subsequent  to  the acquisition of any such property, shall be effective
 for all purposes and to the same extent as though obtained prior to such
 acquisition. The town board may sell, convey and transfer  any  property
 acquired for park purposes at such an amount as it may determine but not
 less  than  the  original  cost  thereof, and apply the proceeds of such
 sale, conveyance or transfer to the purchase of other property for  park
 purposes  and  improve  such property in the manner provided herein. The
 town board of the town of Oyster Bay may also convey and transfer to the
 state of New York or to any municipal or district corporation as defined
 by section three of the general corporation law, any  property  acquired
 for  park  purposes,  or any part thereof, when no longer needed, either
 without consideration or for such consideration and upon such terms  and
 conditions  as the town board may determine and the resolution authoriz-
 ing such conveyance or transfer shall be subject to a permissive  refer-
 endum.  The  town board of the town of Hempstead may lease to the [board
 of cooperative educational  services]  NY  POLYTECHNICAL  INSTITUTE,  as
 defined by article forty of the education law, any property acquired for
 park  purposes, or any part thereof, when no longer needed, either with-
 out consideration or for such consideration  and  upon  such  terms  and
 conditions  as  the  town board may determine. The town board may employ
 such persons and expend such amount of money as may be necessary for the
 proper maintenance of such park for the use, convenience  and  enjoyment
 of  the  inhabitants  of such park district, and, may in its discretion,
 grant licenses and privileges for any use of such park and park property
 which contributes thereto.  The town board may fix a  reasonable  charge
 for  the  use  of  such  park  by all persons other than inhabitants and
 taxpayers of such park district, and, in addition, the board  may  adopt
 general  rules  and regulations for the government and protection of the
 park and all property therein, and, for the enforcement thereof, provide
 that the violator of any rule or regulation  relating  to  the  park  or
 A. 9760  179
 
 property  therein  shall  be  guilty  of  a  misdemeanor  and  shall, on
 conviction, in the county of Nassau  before  a  judge  of  the  district
 court,  and  elsewhere  before  a justice of the peace, be punished by a
 fine  not  exceeding  fifty  dollars,  or, in default of payment of such
 fine, by imprisonment not exceeding thirty days.

 marked  and  equipped as provided in subdivision twenty of section three
 hundred seventy-five of this chapter which has  stopped  on  the  public
 highway,  street  or  private  road  for  the  purpose  of  receiving or
 discharging any passengers, or which has stopped because a school bus in
 front of it has stopped to receive or discharge  any  passengers,  shall
 stop the vehicle before reaching such school bus when there is in opera-
 tion  on said school bus a red visual signal as specified in subdivision
 twenty of section three hundred seventy-five of this  chapter  and  said
 driver  shall not proceed until such school bus resumes motion, or until
 signaled by the driver or a police officer to proceed. For the  purposes
 of  this  section,  and  in  addition  to  the provisions of section one
 hundred thirty-four of this chapter, the  term  "public  highway"  shall
 mean any area used for the parking of motor vehicles or used as a drive-
 way  located  on  the  grounds of a school or of a [board of cooperative
 educational services] NY POLYTECHNICAL INSTITUTE facility  or  any  area
 used as a means of access to and egress from such school or facility.
