 Introduced  by  M. of A. STIRPE, THIELE -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Small Business
 
 AN ACT to amend the New York state urban development corporation act, in
  relation to creating the small business energy loan program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. The legislature hereby finds and declares that the state's
 chronically high energy costs are often cited as a key  factor  for  why
 New York-based businesses and New York-made products are not competitive
 in  national  and global markets. The legislature further finds that the
 state's economic expansion is tied to  the  growth  and  development  of
 small  businesses.  By  reducing  a  primary cost component in a rapidly
 growing sector of the state's economy,  those  businesses  are  rendered
 more competitive, and thus help to better secure New York-based jobs. In
 addition, thriving businesses and communities will augment the tax base,
 which  in  distressed  communities  is  disproportionately lower than in
 other areas of the state.
  Therefore, the legislature seeks to provide funds to reduce high ener-
 gy costs, via a zero  or  low  interest  loan,  or  loan  interest  rate
 reduction program for energy efficiency projects to stimulate the growth
 and development of small businesses and jobs in New York state.
  §  2.  Section  1 of chapter 174 of the laws of 1968, constituting the
 New York state urban development corporation act, is amended by adding a
 new section 16-bb to read as follows:
  § 16-BB. SMALL BUSINESS ENERGY LOAN PROGRAM. 1. DEFINITIONS.  FOR  THE
