  WHEREAS,  Born  in  Auburn,  New  York,  on February 29, 1924, Lloyd

Princeton  University;  he proudly served his country in World War II as
an ambulance driver in the Middle Eastern and European Theaters; and
 
  WHEREAS, After returning from the War, Lloyd  Stephen  Riford,  Jr.,

Regional  Planning  Board;  a  member of the Cayuga County Environmental

  WHEREAS,  Because  of his dedication and activities in a broad array
of civic endeavors, Lloyd Stephen Riford, Jr., was sought as a candidate
for the 125th Assembly District,  which  included  Cayuga  and  Cortland
Counties,  in  1970  and won the election in a heated four-way race in a
difficult year, defeating the incumbent; and
 
  WHEREAS, During  his  Assembly  tenure,  Assemblyman  Lloyd  Stephen
Riford,  Jr.,  became an advocate for the needs of local governments and
the agricultural sector; he was also a ranking member  of  the  Assembly
Ways and Means Committee; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  the  presence  of  a  state  maximum correctional
facility in his district, Assemblyman Lloyd Stephen Riford, Jr.,  gained
significant  knowledge  and  was  considered  an  authority  on  matters
pertaining to the State's correctional system; he was asked to chair  an
Assembly  task  force  on  New  York  State's  correctional  facilities,
particularly following the 1971 riot at the Attica Correctional Facility

correctional laws and the treatment of incarcerated individuals; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, After being re-elected to the Assembly by wide margins five

District seat, which included the counties of his Assembly district with

race handily; and
 
  WHEREAS, Acknowledged for his expertise  in  agriculture  and  broad
knowledge  of the dairy industry, Senator Lloyd Stephen Riford, Jr., was
immediately named Chairman of a new Senate  subcommittee  on  the  dairy
industry; charged with evaluating the problems of New York State's dairy
community,  he  led  the  subcommittee  to  propose  important  remedial

Legislature  to  create  the  bipartisan Legislative Commission on Dairy
Industry Development; and

on the needs of the broader  agricultural  sector,  including  New  York

  WHEREAS,  Of  particular  note during his tenure, as Chairman of the
Senate Subcommittee on the State College of Veterinary Medicine, was his
success in rescuing  the  State's  veterinary  school  from  losing  its
accreditation,  a  loss that would have devastated the health and safety
of farm animals and severely damaged efforts to research  and  eradicate
animal diseases like brucellosis and Johne's Disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On the Senate Higher Education Committee, and as a Senator
at the time, representing the district with  the  most  institutions  of
higher  education,  Senator  Lloyd  Stephen  Riford,  Jr.,  pressed  for

the late Joan Chayka; and

Auburn for several years, he and his  wife  finally  retired  to  Hawaii
where he still resides; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of  this Legislative Body to publicly
recognize those who have reached such a  remarkable  age  and  who  have
witnessed  and  celebrated  the  innovations, cultural developments, and
achievements of this country during the last century,  while  themselves

now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  former New York State Senator Lloyd Stephen Riford, Jr., upon the
occasion of celebrating his 100th Birthday,  expressing  the  collective
gratitude  of  the  Members of this body for his service to the New York
 
State Assembly and Senate and wishing him a  joyous  and  blessed  100th
