  § 1022-H. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY, INCLUDING THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER
 OF  EMINENT DOMAIN. 1. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY EXPRESSLY FINDS AND DETER-
 MINES:
  (A) THE ACQUISITION BY THE AUTHORITY, THROUGH PURCHASE OR THE EXERCISE
 OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, OF EITHER THE SECURITIES OR ASSETS OF  A
 UTILITY  CORPORATION  WHICHEVER IS LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THE RATEPAYERS, AS
 S. 9534  13
 
 THE AUTHORITY MAY DETERMINE WILL  BE  JUST  TO  THE  RATEPAYERS  IN  THE
 SERVICE AREA, IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEANS OF DEALING WITH THE EMERGEN-
 CY  INVOLVING  THE  ECONOMY,  HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS AND THE
 INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE IN THE SERVICE AREA, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT
 SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION PRESENTLY MAY BE DEVOTED TO A PUBLIC USE, SINCE
 THE  PUBLIC USE OF SUCH PROPERTY BY THE AUTHORITY IS HEREBY DEEMED TO BE
 SUPERIOR TO THE PUBLIC USE OF SUCH PROPERTY BY ANY OTHER PERSON, ASSOCI-
 ATION, OR CORPORATION.
  (B) THE AUTHORITY, PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN  TO
 ACQUIRE  THE  STOCK OR ASSETS OF A UTILITY CORPORATION, SHALL ENTER INTO
 NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF  ACQUIRING
 SUCH  STOCK  OR  ASSETS  UPON  SUCH  TERMS AS THE AUTHORITY, IN ITS SOLE
 DISCRETION, DETERMINES WILL RESULT IN AVERAGE RATES  EQUAL  TO  OR  LESS
 THAN  THE  RATES  WHICH WOULD RESULT IF SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION WERE TO
 CONTINUE IN OPERATION.
  (C) THE COMPENSATION PAID BY THE AUTHORITY TO  A  UTILITY  CORPORATION
 SHALL  BE  JUST  TO THE RATEPAYERS IN THE SERVICE AREA WHO MUST PAY SUCH
 COMPENSATION.
  (D) IF THE AUTHORITY DETERMINES THAT IT IS  THE  STOCK  OF  A  UTILITY
 CORPORATION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN, THE PROPER MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE
 THE FAIR MARKET VALUE THEREOF AS EVIDENCED BY THE PRICE OF SUCH STOCK ON
 THE  EXCHANGE ON WHICH IT IS TRADED ON THE VALUATION DATE SINCE THERE IS
 AN ESTABLISHED MARKET FOR SUCH STOCK THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF ITS VALUE. IN
 NO EVENT, HOWEVER, SHALL CONSEQUENTIAL OR SEVERANCE DAMAGES  BE  AWARDED
 IF  CONTROL  OF  SUCH  UTILITY  CORPORATION SHALL HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE
 AUTHORITY.
  (E) IF THE AUTHORITY DETERMINES THAT IT IS THE  ASSETS  OF  A  UTILITY
 CORPORATION THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN, FAIR MARKET VALUE WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE
 JUST COMPENSATION TO SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION SINCE THERE IS AN INSUFFI-
 CIENT  MARKET  IN  THE USUAL SENSE FOR ITS ASSETS TO ASCERTAIN THE VALUE
 THEREOF FROM THE MARKET. IN DETERMINING  THE  COMPENSATION  PAYABLE  FOR
 SUCH  ASSETS, THERE SHALL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE CAPITALIZATION
 OF SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION'S EXPECTED FUTURE EARNINGS.
  (F) NEITHER CONSEQUENTIAL NOR SEVERANCE  DAMAGES  ARE  PROPER  IF  THE
 AUTHORITY CONDEMNS ALL THE ASSETS OF A UTILITY CORPORATION.
  (G)  SUCH  AN ACQUISITION BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE SECURITIES OR ASSETS
 OF A UTILITY CORPORATION SERVES THE  PUBLIC  PURPOSES  OF  ASSURING  THE
 PROVISION  OF  AN  ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF GAS AND ELECTRICITY IN A RELIABLE,
 EFFICIENT AND ECONOMIC MANNER AND RETAINING EXISTING COMMERCE AND INDUS-
 TRY IN AND ATTRACTING NEW COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY TO THE SERVICE AREA, ALL
 OF WHICH ARE MATTERS OF STATE-WIDE CONCERN.
  2. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND  DETERMINATIONS  SET
 FORTH  IN  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION,  THE AUTHORITY IS HEREBY
 AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED TO ACQUIRE, THROUGH PURCHASE OR THE EXERCISE OF
 THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, ALL OR ANY PART OF THE SECURITIES OR ASSETS
 OF A UTILITY CORPORATION, AS THE AUTHORITY IN ITS  SOLE  DISCRETION  MAY
 DETERMINE;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  PRIOR TO PROCEEDING WITH ANY SUCH
 ACQUISITION UNDER THIS TITLE, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES SHALL DETERMINE,  IN
 ITS  SOLE  DISCRETION  BASED  UPON SUCH ENGINEERING, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL
 DATA, STUDIES AND OPINIONS AS IT MAY DEEM APPROPRIATE, THAT THE  AVERAGE
 RATES  PROJECTED  TO  BE  CHARGED  AFTER  SUCH  ACQUISITION AND FOR SUCH
 REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AS THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES  MAY  DETERMINE  WILL
 NOT  BE  HIGHER  THAN  THE RATES PROJECTED TO BE CHARGED BY SUCH UTILITY
 CORPORATION DURING SUCH PERIOD IF SUCH ACQUISITION HAD NOT OCCURRED.
  3. THE AUTHORITY ALSO IS AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED, IN ITS  DISCRETION,
 TO  MAKE  A  TENDER OFFER OR TENDER OFFERS FOR ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE
 S. 9534  14

 SECURITIES OF A UTILITY CORPORATION AT  SUCH  PRICE  OR  PRICES  AS  THE
 AUTHORITY  MAY  DETERMINE TO BE APPROPRIATE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER THAT SUCH
 TENDER OFFER OR TENDER OFFERS, IN THE SOLE JUDGMENT  OF  THE  AUTHORITY,
 WILL RESULT IN AVERAGE RATES LESS THAN THE RATES WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM
 CONTINUED OPERATION BY SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION.
  (A)  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL MAKE SUCH OFFER OR OFFERS OR ANY ADJUSTMENT
 THEREOF PRIOR TO ACQUIRING ANY SUCH SECURITIES OR ANY ASSETS OF A UTILI-
 TY CORPORATION THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN.  THE
 AUTHORITY  MAY PAY FOR SUCH SECURITIES IN CASH OR BY EXCHANGING THEREFOR
 THE AUTHORITY'S BONDS OR A COMBINATION THEREOF.
  (B) IN THE CASE OF A TENDER OFFER IN WHICH A SUBSIDIARY OF THE AUTHOR-
 ITY ACQUIRES AT LEAST SIXTY-SIX AND  TWO-THIRDS  PERCENT  OF  A  UTILITY
 CORPORATION'S  COMMON STOCK, SUCH SUBSIDIARY MAY MERGE WITH SUCH UTILITY
 CORPORATION AND EITHER CONTINUE IN EXISTENCE  OR  DISSOLVE,  AS  IT  MAY
 DETERMINE.
  (C)  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SECTION  FIVE  HUNDRED  THIRTEEN AND ARTICLE
 SIXTEEN OF THE BUSINESS CORPORATION LAW AND ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF  LAW
 RELATING  TO PROCEDURES IN A CORPORATE TAKEOVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMI-
 TATION CHAPTER NINE HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF  THE  LAWS  OF  NINETEEN  HUNDRED
 EIGHTY-FIVE,  SHALL  NOT  BE  APPLICABLE TO THE ACTIONS OF THE AUTHORITY
 PURSUANT TO THIS TITLE.
  (D) IN DETERMINING WHETHER ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH A TENDER  OFFER  BY  THE
 AUTHORITY  IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF A UTILITY CORPORATION, THE DIREC-
 TORS OF SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION SHALL  CONSIDER  NOT  ONLY  THE  DOLLAR
 AMOUNT OF SUCH OFFER BUT THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, RATEPAY-
 ERS,  CREDITORS  (INCLUDING  HOLDERS  OF SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION'S DEBT
 SECURITIES), AND THE ECONOMY OF THE SERVICE AREA AND THE STATE.
  4. THE AUTHORITY, SHOULD IT DETERMINE,  IN  ITS  SOLE  DISCRETION,  TO
 ACQUIRE  THE STOCK OR ASSETS OF A UTILITY CORPORATION BY THE EXERCISE OF
 THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, SHALL NOT TAKE TITLE TO NOR  POSSESSION  OF
 SUCH  STOCK  OR  ASSETS  PRIOR TO A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF
 COMPENSATION TO BE PAID FOR SUCH STOCK OR ASSETS NOR PRIOR TO A DETERMI-
 NATION BY THE AUTHORITY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION THAT THE TAKING OF  SUCH
 STOCK  OR  ASSETS WILL RESULT IN AVERAGE RATES LESS THAN THE RATES WHICH
 WOULD RESULT FROM  CONTINUED  OPERATION  BY  SUCH  UTILITY  CORPORATION.
 NOTWITHSTANDING  THE PROVISIONS OF THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEDURE LAW, THE
 PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISIONS FIVE AND SIX OF THIS SECTION SHALL  APPLY  TO
 THE  ACQUISITION OF THE STOCK OR PROPERTY OF SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION BY
 THE POWER OF  EMINENT  DOMAIN,  PROVIDED  HOWEVER,  TO  THE  EXTENT  THE
 PROVISIONS  HEREIN  DO  NOT SUPERSEDE OR CONFLICT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
 SUCH LAW THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH LAW SHALL APPLY.
  5. PROCEDURE FOR ACQUISITION OF A UTILITY CORPORATION  STOCK.  (A)  IN
 THE  EVENT  THE  AUTHORITY  DETERMINES TO ACQUIRE THE STOCK OF A UTILITY
 CORPORATION BY THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN, HAVING FIRST
 ENTERED INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION FOR THE PURCHASE
 OF SUCH STOCK, THE AUTHORITY NEED NOT HOLD ANY  PUBLIC  HEARING  ON  ITS
 INTENTION  TO CONDEMN SUCH STOCK OR ON THE QUESTION OF THE PUBLIC USE OF
 SUCH ACTION, SUCH FINDING HAVING BEEN MADE BY  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREIN.
 THE AUTHORITY SHALL COMMENCE SUCH ACQUISITION BY SERVING UPON SUCH UTIL-
 ITY  CORPORATION AND FILING WITH THE COUNTY CLERK OF THE COUNTY IN WHICH
 THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION  IS  LOCATED  A  NOTICE
 DESCRIBING  THE  STOCK BEING ACQUIRED, THE VALUATION DATE, AS DETERMINED
 BY THE AUTHORITY, AND SUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS THE  AUTHORITY  MAY
 REASONABLY  DEEM NECESSARY TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS OF CONDEMNATION AND
 PAYMENT. THE NOTICE SHALL STATE THAT IT IS A NOTICE OF  PENDENCY  OF  AN
 ACQUISITION  PROCEEDING AND THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL ELECT WHETHER OR NOT
 S. 9534  15
 
 TO PAY THE AMOUNT OF SUCH AWARD WHEN IT HAS BEEN FINALLY DETERMINED. THE
 AUTHORITY ALSO SHALL CAUSE A COPY OF SUCH NOTICE: (I) TO BE SERVED  UPON
 THE  STOCK  TRANSFER  AGENT  OR AGENTS DESIGNATED BY SUCH UTILITY CORPO-
 RATION  FOR  THE  TRANSFER AND REGISTRATION OF ITS STOCK; AND (II) TO BE
 PUBLISHED IN AT LEAST FIVE SUCCESSIVE ISSUES OF  A  DAILY  NEWSPAPER  OF
 NATIONAL CIRCULATION.
  (B)  UPON  RECEIPT OF SUCH NOTICE, THE STOCK TRANSFER AGENT OR AGENTS,
 AT THE EXPENSE OF THE AUTHORITY, SHALL FORTHWITH SERVE UPON EACH OF  THE
 REGISTERED  OWNERS OF SUCH STOCK A COPY OF SUCH NOTICE. SERVICE SHALL BE
 DEEMED SUFFICIENT IF MAILED BY  CERTIFIED  OR  REGISTERED  MAIL  TO  THE
 ADDRESS  OF  EACH  SUCH  OWNER AS SHOWN ON A UTILITY CORPORATION'S STOCK
 TRANSFER BOOKS. SERVICE OF THE NOTICE UPON THE STOCK TRANSFER  AGENT  OR
 AGENTS  AND ITS PUBLICATION SHALL NOT BE JURISDICTIONAL PREREQUISITES TO
 THE VALIDITY OF THE TAKING. FAILURE TO NOTIFY ANY OWNER OF STOCK  TO  BE
 TAKEN  SHALL  NOT  INVALIDATE  ANY  PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT HEREUNDER OR ANY
 TITLE ACQUIRED BY THE AUTHORITY.
  (C) UPON FILING OF THE NOTICE  DESCRIBED  IN  PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF  THIS
 SUBDIVISION,  THE AUTHORITY SHALL PETITION A SPECIAL TERM OF THE SUPREME
 COURT IN THE JUDICIAL DISTRICT IN WHICH SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION HAS ITS
 PRINCIPAL OFFICE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE STOCK. SUCH  PETITION  SHALL
 BE  GENERALLY IN THE FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEDURE LAW
 SO FAR AS CONSISTENT HEREWITH.
  (D) THE SUPREME COURT IN THE DISTRICT IN  WHICH  SUCH  UTILITY  CORPO-
 RATION  HAS  ITS  PRINCIPAL  OFFICE SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO
 HEAR AND DETERMINE ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF  STOCK  BY
 THE  EXERCISE  OF THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN AND SHALL HEAR SUCH CLAIMS
 WITHOUT A JURY AND WITHOUT  REFERRAL  TO  A  REFEREE  OR  COMMISSIONERS.
 NOTWITHSTANDING  THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION NINE HUNDRED ONE OF THE CIVIL
 PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, UPON MOTION TO THE COURT BY THE  AUTHORITY,  THE
 CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF STOCK SHALL BE MAINTAINED
 AS  A  CLASS ACTION, PURSUANT TO REMAINING PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE NINE OF
 THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, AND THE OWNERS OF THE STOCK  SHALL  BE
 DEEMED  A DEFENDANT CLASS ON THE BASIS OF THE FOLLOWING EXPRESS LEGISLA-
 TIVE FINDINGS:
  (I) THE CLASS OF SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION STOCK OWNERS IS SO  NUMEROUS
 THAT JOINDER OF ALL MEMBERS IS IMPRACTICABLE;
  (II)  THE  ISSUE  OF  VALUATION  OF  SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION STOCK IS
 COMMON TO ALL SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION STOCK OWNERS AND THERE ARE  QUES-
 TIONS  OF LAW OR FACT COMMON TO THE MEMBERS OF SUCH CLASS WHICH PREDOMI-
 NATE OVER ANY QUESTIONS AFFECTING ONLY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS;
  (III) THE CLAIMS OR DEFENSES, IF ANY, OF ANY REPRESENTATIVE  OWNER  OF
 SUCH  UTILITY  CORPORATION STOCK TO ACQUISITION THEREOF BY THE AUTHORITY
 ARE TYPICAL OF THE CLAIMS OR DEFENSES OF THE CLASS;
  (IV) THERE ARE REPRESENTATIVE PARTIES WHO WILL FAIRLY  AND  ADEQUATELY
 PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE CLASS; AND
  (V)  THE  PROSECUTION  OF  SEPARATE  ACTIONS  BY OR AGAINST INDIVIDUAL
 MEMBERS OF THE CLASS WOULD CREATE A  RISK  OF  INCONSISTENT  OR  VARYING
 ADJUDICATIONS  WITH  RESPECT  TO THE ISSUE OF VALUATION AND OTHER ISSUES
 COMMON TO THE CLASS.
  (E) THE PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING JUST COMPENSATION SHALL  BE  IN  THE
 MANNER  PRESCRIBED  BY  THE  EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEDURE LAW, EXCEPT TO THE
 EXTENT SUCH PROCEDURE IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE,
 IN WHICH CASE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE SHALL CONTROL.
  (F) UPON THE ENTRY OF AN AWARD FINALLY DETERMINING  JUST  COMPENSATION
 FOR  THE  STOCK,  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL HAVE SIXTY DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF
 NOTICE OF ENTRY OF SUCH AWARD WITHIN WHICH TO ELECT TO PROCEED WITH  THE
 S. 9534  16
 
 TAKING OR TO ABANDON SUCH ACQUISITION AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION NINE OF
 THIS  SUBDIVISION.  NOTICE  OF  SUCH  ELECTION  SHALL BE SERVED BY THE
 AUTHORITY AND BY THE STOCK TRANSFER AGENT IN  THE  MANNER  DESCRIBED  IN
 PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION. IF THE AUTHORITY ELECTS TO PROCEED
 WITH THE ACQUISITION, IT SHALL DEPOSIT WITH THE SUPREME COURT  IN  WHICH
 THE CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING WAS HELD AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AWARD WITHIN
 ONE  HUNDRED  EIGHTY  DAYS  AFTER  RECEIPT BY THE AUTHORITY OF NOTICE OF
 ENTRY OF SUCH AWARD. UPON THE MAKING  OF  SUCH  DEPOSIT,  THE  AUTHORITY
 SHALL  NOTIFY SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION'S STOCK TRANSFER AGENT IN WRITING
 OF SUCH DEPOSIT. THE SUM SO DEPOSITED SHALL BE APPLIED  AS  PROVIDED  IN
 THE  EMINENT  DOMAIN  PROCEDURE LAW. UPON MAKING SUCH DEPOSIT AND GIVING
 SUCH NOTICE TO THE STOCK TRANSFER AGENT, TITLE TO ALL STOCK DESCRIBED IN
 THE NOTICE OF TAKING SHALL IMMEDIATELY VEST IN  THE  AUTHORITY  AND  THE
 AUTHORITY  SHALL  HAVE  THE  IMMEDIATE  RIGHT  THERETO. IN THE EVENT THE
 AUTHORITY ELECTS TO ABANDON THE ACQUISITION, THE PROVISIONS OF  SUBDIVI-
 SION NINE OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY.
  (G)  IT  SHALL BE A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION
 FOR ANY SUCH SECURITIES THAT  SUCH  SECURITIES  BE  SURRENDERED  TO  THE
 SUPREME  COURT  OR  TO  SUCH  OTHER ENTITY, INCLUDING THE ISSUER'S STOCK
 TRANSFER AGENT, AS THE SUPREME COURT MAY DIRECT.
  6. PROCEDURE FOR ACQUISITION OF A UTILITY CORPORATION'S ASSETS. (A) IF

 WITH SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION FOR THE PURCHASE  OF  SUCH  PROPERTY,  THE
 AUTHORITY  SHALL  CAUSE  A  SURVEY  AND MAP TO BE MADE THEREOF AND SHALL

 TION  SHALL  BE  GENERALLY  IN THE FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE EMINENT DOMAIN
 PROCEDURE LAW, SO FAR AS CONSISTENT HEREWITH.  SUCH  PETITION,  TOGETHER
 WITH  A  NOTICE  OF  PENDENCY  OF  THE PROCEEDING, SHALL BE FILED IN THE
 OFFICE OF THE COUNTY CLERK OF  THE  COUNTY  IN  WHICH  THE  PROPERTY  IS
 LOCATED  AND SHALL BE INDEXED AND RECORDED AS PROVIDED BY LAW. A COPY OF
 SUCH PETITION, TOGETHER WITH A NOTICE OF  THE  PRESENTATION  THEREOF  TO

 TO  THE  CONTRARY, IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY THE AUTHORITY TO CONDEMN

 AND  COMPENSATION SHALL BE PAID ONLY UPON: (I) A DECISION BY THE SUPREME
 COURT THAT COMPENSATION FOR THE REAL PROPERTY CONDEMNED SHALL BE  DETER-
 MINED  SOLELY  BY THE INCOME CAPITALIZATION METHOD OF VALUATION BASED ON
 THE ACTUAL NET INCOME AS ALLOWED BY THE PUBLIC SERVICE  COMMISSION;  AND
 (II)  SUCH SUPREME COURT'S DETERMINATION THAT THE AMOUNT OF SUCH COMPEN-
 SATION SHALL BE BASED ON THE INCOME CAPITALIZATION METHOD,  ENTRY  OF  A
 FINAL JUDGMENT, THE FILING OF THE FINAL DECREE AND THE CONCLUSION OF ANY
 APPEAL  OR  THE  EXPIRATION OF THE TIME TO FILE AN APPEAL RELATED TO THE
 CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING. IF  ANY  COURT  SHALL  UTILIZE  ANY  METHOD  OF
 COMPENSATION  OTHER  THAN  THE  INCOME  CAPITALIZATION METHOD, OR IF THE
 PROPOSED COMPENSATION IS MORE THAN THE RATE BASE OF THE ASSETS TAKEN  IN
 CONDEMNATION,  AS  UTILIZED  BY THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION IN SETTING
 RATES AND AS CERTIFIED BY SUCH COMMISSION, THEN THE AUTHORITY MAY  WITH-
 DRAW  THE  CONDEMNATION  PROCEEDING  WITHOUT  PREJUDICE  OR COSTS TO ANY
 PARTY.
  (F) SHOULD A UTILITY CORPORATION'S PROPERTY BE TAKEN BY  THE  EXERCISE
 OF  THE  POWER  OF  EMINENT DOMAIN AND IF SUCH UTILITY CORPORATION SHALL

 THE  EMINENT  DOMAIN PROCEDURE LAW. THE OWNER OR PERSON IN POSSESSION OF
 SUCH PROPERTY SHALL DELIVER POSSESSION THEREOF  TO  THE  AUTHORITY  UPON
 DEMAND,  AND IN CASE POSSESSION IS NOT DELIVERED WHEN DEMANDED OR DEMAND
 IS NOT CONVENIENT BECAUSE OF ABSENCE OF THE OWNER OR INABILITY TO LOCATE
 OR DETERMINE THE OWNER, THE AUTHORITY MAY APPLY  TO  THE  COURT  WITHOUT
 NOTICE  FOR  AN ORDER REQUIRING THE SHERIFF TO PUT IT INTO POSSESSION OF
 SUCH REAL PROPERTY. SUCH AN ORDER SHALL BE EXECUTED AS  IF  IT  WERE  AN

 PRIATE AND PRUDENT ACTION TO RENEGOTIATE AND RESTRUCTURE  SUCH  DEBT  OR
 FROM  PURCHASING  THE PREFERRED STOCK AND DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY SUCH
 CORPORATION AT SUCH PRICES AS THE AUTHORITY MAY DETERMINE. THE AUTHORITY
