 ty-first commencing with the January first next succeeding the effective

 security law or section five hundred twenty-eight of this title provides
 that the contribution of each member of the New  York  state  employees'
 retirement  system  or the New York state teachers' retirement system in
 the employ of the state shall be reduced by at least eight per centum of
 his compensation, or (b) employee contributions to  either  such  system
 are no longer required by reason of such system becoming noncontributory
 for state employees.

 have become a law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As it relates to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System,  this
 bill  would  amend Section 613 of the Retirement and Social Security Law
 to reduce the required employee contribution  rate  for  Tier  5  and  6
 A. 5487  8
 
 members  to a flat 3.0% of salary, payable over their career. Currently,
 Tier 5 members are required to contribute at a rate of 3.5%  of  salary,
 and  Tier  6 members are required to contribute between 3.0% and 6.0% of
 salary,  according  to a salary-based schedule. No contributions made or
 collected before the effective date of this bill would be refunded.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System for this benefit is estimated to be $136.5
 million or 0.74% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer  contribution
 rate  that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without any
 assets, is equal to 5.15% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture. This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost  of
 Tier 6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the reduction to the
 Tier  6  employee  contribution  rate proposed under this bill, this new
 entrant rate would increase to 6.72% of pay, an  increase  of  1.57%  of
 pay.
  Member  data  is  from  the  System's  most recent actuarial valuation
 files, consisting of data provided by the employers  to  the  Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the System's
 Annual Report. System assets are as reported in the  System's  financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al  assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valu-
 ation Report.
  The source of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2023-03 dated February  22,
 2023  prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State Teach-
 ers' Retirement System and is intended for  use  only  during  the  2023
 Legislative  Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the  Ameri-
 can  Academy  of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards of the
