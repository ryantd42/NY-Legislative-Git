 Introduced  by  Sen. SANDERS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil rights law, in relation to  discrimination  in
  the ownership of cooperative housing
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration of intent. The  legis-
 lature  recognizes  that cooperative ownership in multi-family dwellings
 is a popular form of home  ownership  in  New  York  state.  An  ongoing
 concern  for  consumers dealing in the cooperative housing market is the
 potential for the unlawful rejection by a board of directors of a buyer.
  The legislature finds and determines that, not infrequently,  a  co-op
 board  rejects  what appears to be a well-qualified customer. Often, the
 prospective purchaser has concerns that the rejection was in fact unlaw-
 ful discrimination. Both federal and state  laws  protect  our  citizens
 from  unfair  housing practices, which include discrimination based upon
 race, ethnicity, gender, age or family status.
  For such reasons, it is the legislature's intent to require boards  of
 directors of cooperative housing to disclose to proposed purchasers, the
 reasons for rejecting a sale.
  § 2.  Section 19-a of the civil rights law, as added by chapter 376 of
 the laws of 1971, is amended to read as follows:
  §  19-a.  Prohibition  against  unreasonable withholding of consent.
 WHENEVER ANY CORPORATION FORMED  FOR  THE  PURPOSE  OF  THE  COOPERATIVE
 OWNERSHIP  OF REAL ESTATE WITHIN THE STATE WITHHOLDS CONSENT TO THE SALE
 OR PROPOSED SALE OF CERTIFICATES OF STOCK OR OTHER EVIDENCE OF OWNERSHIP
 OF AN INTEREST IN SUCH CORPORATION, SUCH CORPORATION SHALL  PROVIDE  THE
 PROSPECTIVE  PURCHASER WITH A WRITTEN STATEMENT OF ITS REASONS FOR WITH-
 HOLDING CONSENT NO LATER THAN THIRTY DAYS AFTER ITS DECISION TO WITHHOLD
 CONSENT.

 S. 5789  2
 
  1. No SUCH corporation [formed for  the  purpose  of  the  cooperative
 ownership  of  real  estate  within the state] shall withhold [its] SUCH
 consent [to the sale or proposed sale of certificates of stock or  other
 evidence of ownership of an interest in such corporation] because of the
 race, creed, national origin, or sex of the purchaser.
  2.  For the purposes of this section a "corporation" shall include the
 cooperative management, cooperative tenants,  cooperative  shareholders,
 or any appointee or successor in interest of a corporation.
  3.  This section shall apply to every sale or proposed sale whether by
 a corporation directly, its successor  in  interest,  or  by  any  other
 lawfully entitled party.
  4.  Every  agreement, negative covenant, restrictive covenant or other
 provision, whether written or oral and wherever contained,  inconsistent
 with this section shall be void and unenforceable.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
