BY: Senator PARKER
 
  COMMENDING  the  Wyckoff  House  Museum  upon  the
  occasion of hosting its Annual Pinkster Festival  on
  May 25, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
those  organizations  of  historic  significance  whose  dedicated
contributions  have  helped  further  the  cultural  enrichment  of  our
communities and our Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the Wyckoff House Museum upon the occasion of hosting its Annual
Pinkster Festival on Saturday, May 25, 2024, in Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Pinkster  Festival  is  a  350-year-old  little-known
Africanized  celebration that took place annually in New York for almost
200 years; Pinkster is Dutch for the Christian holiday of Pentecost, the
commemoration of the descent of the Holy Spirit upon  the  disciples  of
Jesus, prompting them to "speak in tongues" and go forth spreading their
joyous  message;  it  is  considered  to  be the beginning of the formal
Christian  church  and,  according  to  the  Christian  calendar,
Pentecost/Pinkster occurs annually 50 days after Easter; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  observations began here in New York and in the U.S.
as a result of the original Dutch settlers; it was a time when the Dutch
would go to church to observe the Pinkster holiday and they  would  give
their  enslaved Africans time off with the freedom to engage in normally
uncustomary activities; the Africans took this opportunity to  celebrate
with  their  own  music,  dance, and other cultural expressions of their
African heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Pinkster Festival  evolved  into  what  is  likely  the
oldest openly African holiday celebration in America; these celebrations
were outlawed in 1811 before finally disappearing around 1850; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Wyckoff  House  Museum has been dedicated to reviving
this wonderful tradition, tapping into  a  forgotten  cultural  history,
justly  earning the museum this distinct recognition for its unrelenting
dedication to its community and residents beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend the Wyckoff House Museum upon the occasion of hosting its Annual
Pinkster Festival on May 25, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Wyckoff House Museum.
