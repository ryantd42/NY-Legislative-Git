  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Section 490 of the vehicle and traffic law  is  amended  by
 adding a new subdivision 2-a to read as follows:
  2-A.  SOLICITATION  FOR  APPLICANT  TO ENROLL IN THE NATIONAL REGISTRY
 OPERATED BY THE NATIONAL MARROW DONOR  PROGRAM.  IN  ADDITION  TO  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL
 ENSURE THAT SPACE IS PROVIDED ON THE APPLICATION FOR  AN  IDENTIFICATION

 PURPOSES OF RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM THE NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM
 ABOUT ENROLLING AS A POTENTIAL VOLUNTEER BONE MARROW OR BLOOD CELL DONOR
 ON THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OPERATED BY THE NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM.
  §  2.  Subdivision 1 of section 502 of the vehicle and traffic law, as
 separately amended by chapters 158 and 440  of  the  laws  of  2021,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  Application  for license. Application for a driver's license shall
 be made to the commissioner. The fee prescribed by law may be  submitted
 with such application. The applicant shall furnish such proof of identi-
 ty,  age,  and  fitness  as  may  be  required by the commissioner. With

 acceptable proofs of age and identity approved by the commissioner as of
 January first, two thousand nineteen, acceptable proof of identity shall
 also include, but not be limited to, a valid, unexpired foreign passport
 issued  by  the  applicant's country of citizenship (which shall also be
 eligible as proof of age), a valid,  unexpired  consular  identification
 document  issued by a consulate from the applicant's country of citizen-
 ship, or a valid foreign driver's license that includes a photo image of
 the applicant and which is unexpired or expired for  less  than  twenty-
 four  months  of its date of expiration, as primary forms of such proof.
 Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be deemed  to  preclude  the
 commissioner  from approving additional proofs of identity and age.  The
 license shall display the sex designation of M, F, or X as certified  by
 the  applicant, with no additional documentation required. The applicant
 may amend the sex designation of their driver's  license  upon  request.
 Upon amendment of the sex designation, the change shall be made consist-
 ent through all affiliated records within the control of the department.
 The  commissioner  may also provide that the application procedure shall
 include the taking of a photo  image  or  images  of  the  applicant  in
 accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the commissioner. In
 addition, the commissioner also shall require that the applicant provide
 such  applicant's  social  security  number  or,  in  lieu thereof, with
 respect to an application  for  a  non-commercial  driver's  license  or
 learner's  permit  which does not meet federal standards for identifica-
 tion, an affidavit signed by such applicant  that  they  have  not  been
 issued  a  social  security  number. The commissioner also shall provide
 space on the application so that the applicant may  request  a  notation
 upon  such license that such applicant is a veteran of the United States
 armed forces, and space on the application so  that  the  applicant  may
 request  a  notation upon such license that [he or she] SUCH PERSON is a
 veteran of the United States armed forces, and space on the  application
 so  that  the  applicant  may  register  in the New York state organ and
 tissue donor registry under  section  forty-three  hundred  ten  of  the
 public  health law with the following stated on the application in clear
 and conspicuous type:
  "You must fill out the following section: Would you like to  be  added
 to  the  Donate  Life  Registry? Check box for 'yes' or 'skip this ques-
 tion'."
  The commissioner of health shall not maintain records  of  any  person
 who checks "skip this question". Except where the application is made in
 person  or  electronically,  failure to check a box shall not impair the
 validity of an application, and failure to check "yes" or checking "skip
 this question" shall not be construed to imply a wish not to donate.  In
 the  case  of  an  applicant under eighteen years of age, checking "yes"
 shall not constitute consent to make an anatomical gift or  registration
 in  the  donate  life registry, except as otherwise provided pursuant to
 the provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision  one  of  section  forty-
 three  hundred  one  of  the  public  health law. Where an applicant has
 previously consented to make an anatomical gift  or  registered  in  the
 donate  life registry, checking "skip this question" or failing to check
 a box shall not impair that consent or registration.  ADDITIONALLY,  THE
 COMMISSIONER  SHALL ENSURE THAT SPACE IS PROVIDED ON THE APPLICATION FOR
 A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR RENEWAL THEREOF TO ADVISE APPLICANTS OF THE EXIST-
 ENCE OF THE NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM AND TO ALLOW FOR APPLICANTS TO
 CONSENT TO SHARING THEIR INFORMATION  WITH  THE  NATIONAL  MARROW  DONOR
 PROGRAM  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF  RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM THE NATIONAL

 MARROW  OR  BLOOD  CELL  DONOR  ON THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OPERATED BY THE
 NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM. In addition, an applicant for  a  commer-
 cial  driver's  license  who  will operate a commercial motor vehicle in
 interstate commerce shall certify that such applicant meets the require-
 ments  to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as set forth in public law
 99-570, title XII, and title 49 of the code of federal regulations,  and
 all  regulations promulgated by the United States secretary of transpor-
 tation under the hazardous materials transportation act. In addition, an
 applicant for a commercial  driver's  license  shall  submit  a  medical
 certificate  at  such intervals as required by the federal motor carrier
 safety improvement act of 1999 and Part 383.71(h) of  title  49  of  the
 code  of  federal regulations relating to medical certification and in a
 manner prescribed by the commissioner.  For purposes of this section and
 sections five hundred three, five hundred ten-a, and five hundred ten-aa
 of this title, the terms  "medical  certificate"  and  "medical  certif-
 ication" shall mean a form substantially in compliance with the form set
 forth  in Part 391.43(h) of title 49 of the code of federal regulations.
 Upon a determination that the holder of a  commercial  driver's  license
 has  made  any false statement, with respect to the application for such
 license, the commissioner shall revoke such license.

 ly, the addition, amendment and/or repeal  of  any  rule  or  regulation
 necessary  for  the implementation of this act on its effective date are
