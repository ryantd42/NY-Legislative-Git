 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to allowing for
  individuals to enroll in the national bone marrow donor program at the
  time of application for or renewal of a driver's license or non-driver
  identification card

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  490 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 2-a to read as follows:
  2-A. ENROLLMENT IN THE NATIONAL BONE MARROW DONOR PROGRAM.  IN  ADDI-
 TION  TO  THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMIS-
 SIONER SHALL ENSURE THAT SPACE IS PROVIDED ON  THE  APPLICATION  FOR  AN
 IDENTIFICATION  CARD  OR  RENEWAL  THEREOF  TO  ADVISE APPLICANTS OF THE
 EXISTENCE OF THE NATIONAL BONE MARROW DONOR PROGRAM  AND  TO  ALLOW  FOR
 APPLICANTS TO ENROLL IN SUCH NATIONAL BONE MARROW DONOR PROGRAM.
  §  2.  Subdivision 1 of section 502 of the vehicle and traffic law, as
 separately amended by chapters 158 and 440  of  the  laws  of  2021,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  Application  for license. Application for a driver's license shall
 be made to the commissioner. The fee prescribed by law may be  submitted
 with such application. The applicant shall furnish such proof of identi-
 ty,  age,  and  fitness  as  may  be  required by the commissioner. With
 respect to a non-commercial driver's license or learner's  permit  which
 does  not  meet federal standards for identification, in addition to the
 acceptable proofs of age and identity approved by the commissioner as of
 January first, two thousand nineteen, acceptable proof of identity shall
 also include, but not be limited to, a valid, unexpired foreign passport
 issued by the applicant's country of citizenship (which  shall  also  be
 eligible  as  proof  of age), a valid, unexpired consular identification
 document issued by a consulate from the applicant's country of  citizen-
 ship, or a valid foreign driver's license that includes a photo image of
 the  applicant  and  which is unexpired or expired for less than twenty-
 four months of its date of expiration, as primary forms of  such  proof.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 9133  2
 
 Nothing  contained  in  this subdivision shall be deemed to preclude the
 commissioner from approving additional proofs of identity and age.  The
 license  shall display the sex designation of M, F, or X as certified by
 the  applicant, with no additional documentation required. The applicant
 may amend the sex designation of their driver's  license  upon  request.
 Upon amendment of the sex designation, the change shall be made consist-
 ent through all affiliated records within the control of the department.
 The  commissioner  may also provide that the application procedure shall
 include the taking of a photo  image  or  images  of  the  applicant  in
 accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the commissioner. In
 addition, the commissioner also shall require that the applicant provide
 such  applicant's  social  security  number  or,  in  lieu thereof, with
 respect to an application  for  a  non-commercial  driver's  license  or
 learner's  permit  which does not meet federal standards for identifica-
 tion, an affidavit signed by such applicant  that  they  have  not  been
 issued  a  social  security  number. The commissioner also shall provide
 space on the application so that the applicant may  request  a  notation
 upon  such license that such applicant is a veteran of the United States
 armed forces, and space on the application so  that  the  applicant  may
 request  a notation upon such license that he or she is a veteran of the
 United States armed forces, and space on the  application  so  that  the
 applicant  may  register  in  the  New York state organ and tissue donor
 registry under section forty-three hundred ten of the public health  law
 with  the  following  stated on the application in clear and conspicuous
 type:
  "You must fill out the following section: Would you like to  be  added
 to  the  Donate  Life  Registry? Check box for 'yes' or 'skip this ques-
 tion'."
  The commissioner of health shall not maintain records  of  any  person
 who checks "skip this question". Except where the application is made in
 person  or  electronically,  failure to check a box shall not impair the
 validity of an application, and failure to check "yes" or checking "skip
 this question" shall not be construed to imply a wish not to donate.  In
 the  case  of  an  applicant under eighteen years of age, checking "yes"
 shall not constitute consent to make an anatomical gift or  registration
 in  the  donate  life registry, except as otherwise provided pursuant to
 the provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision  one  of  section  forty-
 three  hundred  one  of  the  public  health law. Where an applicant has
 previously consented to make an anatomical gift  or  registered  in  the
 donate  life registry, checking "skip this question" or failing to check
 a box shall not impair that consent or registration.  ADDITIONALLY,  THE
 COMMISSIONER  SHALL ENSURE THAT SPACE IS PROVIDED ON THE APPLICATION FOR
 A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR RENEWAL THEREOF TO ADVISE APPLICANTS OF THE EXIST-
 ENCE OF THE NATIONAL BONE MARROW DONOR PROGRAM AND TO ALLOW  FOR  APPLI-
 CANTS TO ENROLL IN SUCH NATIONAL BONE MARROW DONOR PROGRAM. In addition,
 an  applicant  for  a  commercial  driver's  license  who will operate a
 commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce shall certify that  such
 applicant  meets the requirements to operate a commercial motor vehicle,
 as set forth in public law 99-570, title XII, and title 49 of  the  code
 of  federal  regulations,  and all regulations promulgated by the United
 States secretary of transportation under the hazardous materials  trans-
 portation  act.  In  addition,  an  applicant  for a commercial driver's
 license shall submit a medical certificate at such intervals as required
 by the federal motor carrier safety improvement act  of  1999  and  Part
 383.71(h)  of  title  49  of the code of federal regulations relating to
 medical certification and in a manner prescribed  by  the  commissioner.
 S. 9133  3
 
 For  purposes  of  this  section  and  sections five hundred three, five
 hundred ten-a, and five hundred ten-aa of this title, the terms "medical
 certificate" and "medical certification" shall mean a form substantially
 in  compliance  with the form set forth in Part 391.43(h) of title 49 of
 the code of federal regulations. Upon a determination that the holder of
 a commercial driver's license has made any false statement, with respect
 to the application for such license, the commissioner shall revoke  such
 license.
  § 3. Section 508 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 7 to read as follows:
  7.  THE  COMMISSIONER  IS  DIRECTED TO DEVELOP LICENSE APPLICATION AND
 RENEWAL FORMS AND THE  DIRECTIONS  ACCOMPANYING  SUCH  FORMS  TO  ADVISE
 APPLICANTS  OF  THE  EXISTENCE OF THE NATIONAL BONE MARROW DONOR PROGRAM
 AND TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR APPLICANTS TO ENROLL IN SUCH  NATIONAL
 BONE  MARROW  DONOR  PROGRAM  ON  SUCH  FORMS,  AND TO FURTHER AMEND THE
 WEBSITE OF THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE NATIONAL BONE MARROW DONOR  PROGRAM
 CONTACT INFORMATION.
  §  4. This act shall take effect January 1, 2028. Effective immediate-
 ly, the addition, amendment and/or repeal  of  any  rule  or  regulation
 necessary  for  the implementation of this act on its effective date are
 authorized to be made and completed on or before such date.
