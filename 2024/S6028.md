 AN ACT granting retroactive membership in the New York state  and  local
  police and fire retirement system to Paul Valentine Jr.
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, Paul  Valen-
 tine  Jr., an employee of the Town of Orangetown and a member of the New
 York state and local police and fire retirement system, who for  reasons
 not  ascribable  to his own negligence, failed to become a member of the
 New York state and local employees' retirement system during his employ-
 ment with the Town of Orangetown on June 26, 2001, shall  be  deemed  to
 have  joined  the  New  York  state and local police and fire retirement
 system on such date and shall be granted Tier II status in the New  York
 state  and  local police and fire retirement system, if, within one year
 of the effective date of this act, he shall file a written request  with
 the state comptroller.
  §  2. No contributions made to the New York state and local retirement
 system by Paul Valentine Jr.  shall be  returned  or  refunded  to  him
 pursuant to this act.
  § 3. All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the Town of Orangetown.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  provide  Paul Valentine Jr. a date of membership of
 June 26, 2001, resulting in Tier 2 status in  the  New  York  State  and
 Local Police and Fire Retirement System. Paul Valentine Jr. is currently
 in Tier 6. There will be no refund of member contributions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $16,000 in the
 annual contributions of the Town  of  Orangetown  for  the  fiscal  year

 ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the bill-
 ing rates and salary of Paul Valentine Jr. change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service  cost of approximately $9,940 which will be
 borne by the Town of Orangetown as a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
