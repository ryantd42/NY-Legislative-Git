 TO, (A) A FIXED CHARGE FOR DISTRIBUTION BASIC SERVICE,  (B)  A  DISTRIB-
 UTION  CUSTOMER  SERVICE  CHARGE,  (C) A CUSTOMER CHARGE, OR (D) A BASIC

 AMENDMENT OF RATE SCHEDULES PURSUANT TO ARTICLE FOUR OF THIS CHAPTER, TO
 RECOVER  ONLY  THE  FIXED  COSTS  AND OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES
 DIRECTLY RELATED TO  METERING,  BILLING,  SERVICE  CONNECTIONS  AND  THE
 PROVISION OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.
  3.  A UTILITY CORPORATION MAY NOT IMPOSE A RESIDENTIAL FIXED CHARGE IN

 EXCEEDS THE CAP ESTABLISHED IN THIS SUBDIVISION, THE EXCESS AMOUNT SHALL
 BE  CARRIED  OVER  INTO  FUTURE  BILLING PERIODS AS A CREDIT TOWARDS THE

 RECOUPED DURING THE CURRENT BILLING PERIOD MAY ALSO BE CARRIED OVER AS A
 CREDIT TOWARDS THE CUSTOMER'S FIXED FEES.
  4.  THE UTILITY CORPORATION SHALL PROVIDE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT INFOR-
 MATION ON FIXED CHARGES TO RESIDENTIAL  ELECTRIC,  GAS,  OR  COMBINATION
 ELECTRIC  AND  GAS UTILITY CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 SPECIFIC COSTS AND EXPENSES INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF SUCH CHARGES.
 THE INFORMATION SHALL  BE  EASILY  ACCESSIBLE  TO  CUSTOMERS,  INCLUDING
 THROUGH  THE  CORPORATION'S WEBSITE AND BILLING STATEMENTS, AND SHALL BE
 PROVIDED IN A CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE  MANNER.  THE  CORPORATION  SHALL
 ALSO  PROVIDE  CUSTOMERS  WITH  NOTICE  OF ANY CHANGES TO FIXED CHARGES,
 INCLUDING THE REASONS FOR SUCH CHANGES  AND  THE  IMPACT  ON  CUSTOMERS'
 BILLS, IN ADVANCE OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH CHANGES.
