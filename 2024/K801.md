  COMMENDING  Jason's  Vineyard upon the occasion of
  producing New York State's Best  Sparkling  Wine  in
  the  2023 New York Wine Classic by the New York Wine
  & Grape Foundation
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Jason's  Vineyard  of  Jamesport, New York upon the occasion of
producing New York State's Best Sparkling Wine in the 2023 New York Wine
Classic by the New York Wine & Grape Foundation on July 13, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, As  a  result  of  hard  work,  knowledge,  diligence,  and
dedication  to  the  art  of  winemaking, Jason's Vineyard's 2021 Bubbly
Rose, North Fork of Long Island, was named Best Sparkling  Wine  in  the
2023 New York Wine Classic by the New York Wine & Grape Foundation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Seeing an unprecedented growth over the past few years and
allowing wine enthusiasts to enjoy this unique  part  of  the  New  York
experience  across  the  state,  this  extraordinary  vineyard has truly
showcased why New York State is a premier wine destination; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jason's Vineyard was planted in 1996, using only the finest
clones of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc
and Petit Verdot; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rich in history on Long Island, Jason's Vineyard  pioneered
the  practice  of densely planting grapevines to intensify wine flavors;
the six feet between rows and three  feet  between  adjacent  vines  are
measurements  used in the renowned Bordeaux winemaking region of France;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Jason's Vineyard is in direct correlation to
the efforts of its dedicated owners and staff, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors  on  behalf  of the businesses and the communities they serve;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and state economies, and its vibrant role in improving  the  quality  of
life  in  its  community,  fully confident it will continue to enjoy the
same sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend Jason's Vineyard upon the occasion of producing New York State's
 
Best  Sparkling  Wine  in the 2023 New York Wine Classic by the New York
Wine & Grape Foundation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Jason's Vineyard.
