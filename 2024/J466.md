  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 29, 2023, as Vietnam Veterans Day in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is custom of this Legislative Body that those  who  give
positive definition to the profile and disposition of the American Armed
Forces  so profoundly strengthen our shared commitment in conjunction to
the exercise of freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 29, 2023, as Vietnam
Veterans Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Vietnam Veterans Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the Armed Forces from the State of New York, who
have  so honorably served this State and Nation deserve a special salute
from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of the men and women who served with dignity
and honor during this historic time period, let  us  remember  them  and
thank them for their service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States  carried  out its first combat mission
against the Viet Cong on January 12, 1962; in  Operation  Choppers,  the
United  States  Army pilots lifted more than 1,000 South Vietnam service
members over jungle and underbrush  to  capture  a  National  Liberation
Front Stronghold near Saigon; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  more than a decade of combat, over air, land, and
sea, these proud Americans upheld the highest traditions of  the  United
States Armed Forces; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than three million Americans served their country, and
more  than  58,000  sacrificed  their lives; the names of those lost are
forever engraved in the black granite Vietnam  Memorial  in  Washington,
D.C.; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Vietnam War era was a tumultuous time in America; when
our brave service members returned home, many returned with physical and
emotional scars; and
 
  WHEREAS, By the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United States  troops
in  Vietnam,  and  by  1969,  a peak of approximately 543,000 troops was
reached; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was signed,  which
required the release of all United States prisoners-of-war held in North
Vietnam and the withdrawal of all United States forces in South Vietnam;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  May 7, 1975, the last 2,500 troops were withdrawn from
South Vietnam thus ending military involvement in the Vietnam War; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, The citizens of this great State and Nation, benefactors of
the  sacrifices  and courageous acts of the men and women who served and
continue to serve in the United States Armed Forces, remain indebted and
are justly proud of the Vietnam veterans from the  State  of  New  York,
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 29, 2023, as Vietnam
Veterans Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Vietnam Veterans Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pause further to encourage the
people of the State of New York to observe  Vietnam  Veterans  Day  with
appropriate  ceremonies  and  activities  that  provide the appreciation
Vietnam War veterans deserve but did not  receive  upon  returning  home
from  the  war;  to  demonstrate  the resolve that never again shall the
Nation disregard and denigrate a  generation  of  veterans;  to  promote
awareness  of  the  faithful  service and contributions of such veterans
during their  military  service  as  well  as  their  communities  since
returning  home;  to  promote  awareness of all the importance of entire
communities empowering veterans and the families of veterans to readjust
to civilian life after military service; and  to  promote  opportunities
for  such veterans to assist younger veterans returning from the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan  in  rehabilitation  from  wounds,  both  seen  and
unseen,  and  to  support  the  reintegration  of  younger veterans into
civilian life; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and Vietnam veteran organizations.
