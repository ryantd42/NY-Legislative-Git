  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend those institutions of  commitment  and  high  achievement  whose
purpose and endeavors prove a dedication to the pursuit of excellence in
the education of the youth of this noble Empire State; and

School epitomizes these principles, putting them to  practice  each  and
every  day,  resulting in a meaningful, well-rounded education for every

language; and

Schools, and the closing of the academic year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within the 21st century, Alba Life School  stands  prepared
to  reach  out,  in  earnest  and  enthusiastic quest of its mission, to
promote  the  maximum  growth  of  every  student,  to  foster  cultural
enrichment,  and  build  skills  which  will  carry its students and the
citizens of its community into the future; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Alba Life School is in direct correlation to
the  efforts  of  its  esteemed  educators  and  staff  members,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive

the community, and planning with vision and purpose for the ebb and flow
of growth and positive change it will encounter in the  years  to  come;
