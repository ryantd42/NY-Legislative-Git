  2.  THE COMMISSION SHALL ANNUALLY PREPARE A LIST OF ALL DISCRIMINATORY
 JURISDICTIONS. THE COMMISSION SHALL ADD TO OR DELETE FROM SAID LIST  ANY
 JURISDICTION UPON CHANGES IN SUCH JURISDICTION'S LAWS THAT DEEM A CHANGE
 IN  DESIGNATION.  THE COMMISSION SHALL DELIVER A COPY OF THE LIST BY THE
 END  OF  EACH  CALENDAR YEAR TO ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF NEW
 YORK AS DEFINED IN THIS SECTION AND DETAIL THE EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  SUCH
 LIST.
  3.  UPON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF A LIST OF DISCRIMINATORY JURISDICTIONS,
 A PUBLIC EMPLOYER SHALL NOT HIRE ANY PERSON WHOSE PRIMARY  RESIDENCE  IS
 LOCATED  IN  A DISCRIMINATORY JURISDICTION.  HOWEVER, SUCH PERSON SHALL
 HAVE ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF HIRE TO CHANGE HIS OR HER  PRIMARY  RESI-
 DENCE TO A JURISDICTION THAT IS NOT DEEMED DISCRIMINATORY BY THE COMMIS-
 SION.  A  PERSON  WHO  FAILS TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION
 FOLLOWING THE ONE YEAR PERIOD FROM HIRE SHALL BE DEEMED  UNFIT  TO  HOLD
 SUCH  OFFICE,  EMPLOYMENT  OR  POSITION  AND  SUCH PUBLIC EMPLOYER SHALL
 TERMINATE THE EMPLOYMENT IMMEDIATELY.  THE PUBLIC EMPLOYER, UPON RECEIPT
 OF THE LIST OR UPDATED LIST OF ALL DISCRIMINATORY  JURISDICTIONS,  SHALL
 REVISE  ALL  RELEVANT  HIRING  STANDARDS TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH CHANGES AND
 DISSEMINATE TO ALL NECESSARY AUTHORITIES.
  4. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY PERSON WHO IS
 EMPLOYED BY A PUBLIC EMPLOYER IN THIS STATE ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE
 INITIAL LIST AND ANY SUBSEQUENT UPDATED LIST OF DISCRIMINATORY JURISDIC-
 TIONS BY THE COMMISSION AND WHERE SUCH  PERSON'S  PRIMARY  RESIDENCE  IS
 LOCATED  IN A DISCRIMINATORY JURISDICTION WHICH WAS ON THE ORIGINAL LIST
 OR HAS BEEN ADDED AND WAS NOT DESIGNATED DISCRIMINATORY ON THE LIST FROM
 THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL CONTINUE TO  NOT
 APPLY  PROVIDED  SUCH  PERSON  CONTINUES  TO HOLD EMPLOYMENT BY A PUBLIC
 EMPLOYER IN THE STATE WITHOUT A BREAK IN PUBLIC SERVICE OF GREATER  THAN
 THIRTY DAYS.
  5. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION MAY BE WAIVED THROUGH AN APPLICATION
 THAT  IS  APPROVED  BY THE COMMISSION.  THE APPLICATION MUST DEMONSTRATE
 THE UNDUE HARDSHIP CREATED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION AND  HOW  A
 WAIVER  WOULD  ALLEVIATE  SUCH  HARDSHIP.  THE APPLICATION MUST INCLUDE
 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION DETAILING THE  UNDUE  HARDSHIP,  PROVIDED,  THE
 COMMISSION MAY IN ITS DISCRETION REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE
 PERSON.  AN APPLICATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED IN A MANNER PRESCRIBED BY THE
 COMMISSION. A DETERMINATION BY THE COMMISSION MUST BE MADE IN WRITING NO
 LATER THAN NINETY DAYS AFTER IT WAS RECEIVED. THE COMMISSION MAY  EXTEND
 THE  PERIOD  OF  REVIEW  FOR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS IF IT INFORMS THE
 APPLICANT IN WRITING.  IF THE APPLICATION IS DENIED, AN  APPEAL  MAY  BE
 GRANTED  AT  THE  DISCRETION  OF THE COMMISSION.  AN APPLICANT THAT WAS
 DENIED MAY REAPPLY FOR A WAIVER NO SOONER THAN  SIX  MONTHS  AFTER  SUCH
 DENIAL.  A WAIVER THAT IS GRANTED BY THE COMMISSION SHALL BE VALID FOR A
 PERIOD OF ONE YEAR OR UNTIL SUCH APPLICANT HAS BEEN HIRED  BY  A  PUBLIC
 EMPLOYER  WHEREIN  HE  OR  SHE  SHALL  BE  CONSIDERED NOT SUBJECT TO THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION AS  PROVIDED  IN  SUBDIVISION  FOUR  OF  THIS
 SECTION.  A  PERSON  MAY REAPPLY FOR A WAIVER UPON THE EXPIRATION OF A
 PREVIOUSLY GRANTED WAIVER.

 and  regulations  necessary  for the implementation of the provisions of
