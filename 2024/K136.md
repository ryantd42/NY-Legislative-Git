  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 6, 2023, as Lymphedema Day in the State of New
  York, in conjunction  with  the  observance  of  the
  Eighth Annual World Lymphedema Day
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in recognizing days
of awareness of important medical conditions, in the hopes of increasing
education, treatment and cure; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2016, this Legislative Body was the first to establish
World Lymphedema Day on March 6th; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim March 6, 2023, as Lymphedema Day in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of the  Eighth
Annual World Lymphedema Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lymphedema is a disease that occurs when the body's natural
Lymphatic  drainage  system  is  damaged,  blocked,  or does not develop
properly and the Lymphatic fluid within a given area, such as  the  arm,
leg,  torso,  head or neck, is unable to drain properly; this results in
extreme swelling that impairs mobility, function, and can cause pain and
significantly impair quality of life for the affected person; and
 
  WHEREAS, The total number of persons living  with  or  at  risk  for
Lymphedema  is  difficult  to  establish  because  Lymphedema  is
under-reported and often misdiagnosed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under-diagnosing and under-treating of Lymphedema patients'
costs healthcare providers and healthcare insurers, including  Medicare,
untold  millions  of  dollars  every year because if left untreated, the
potential for infection is greatly increased and  may  come  on  in  the
course  of  a few hours and requires immediate treatment on an emergency
basis; and
 
  WHEREAS, The World Health Organization estimates  over  250  million
people worldwide have secondary lymphedema and an additional 120 million
people  worldwide are infected with lymphatic filariasis, which leads to
lymphedema; and Stanford University estimates up to 10 million Americans
are affected by Lymphedema; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lymphedema can be inherited, present at birth  or  manifest
itself later in life as in primary lymphedema; it can also develop after
cancer  treatment,  radiation  therapy,  major  surgery, severe burns or
other traumatic injuries such  as  those  affecting  our  combat  tested
veterans, referred to as secondary lymphedema; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Center for Disease Control estimates 20-40 percent of
all cancer survivors will develop Lymphedema  at  some  point  in  their
lifetime, with an even higher percentage among the elderly; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Cancer  Institute  predicts  a  42  percent
increase in cancer survivors 65 years of age and older, and as  many  as
 
1.5  to  3  million Medicare beneficiaries who are cancer survivors will
require treatment for their Lymphedema; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of the financial, physical and psychological
impact  Lymphedema  has  on  those  afflicted,  it is incumbent upon the
citizens of the State of New York to support the courageous  individuals
living  and  coping  with  this  debilitating condition as well as their
caregivers, both professional and lay persons; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
tireless  advocates  and healthcare providers who spend so much of their
time and resources battling this painful and  destructive  disease  that
affects so many; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  6,  2023,  as
Lymphedema  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
observance of the Eighth Annual World Lymphedema Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
