  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 18, 2024, as School Backpack Awareness Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of important
initiatives that affect the lives of the students of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  18,  2024,  as
School  Backpack  Awareness Day in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of National School Backpack Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, National School Backpack Awareness Day strives to make sure
students wear backpacks safely; improper use can lead to  back  pain  or
injury, which can impact learning; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  School  Backpack Awareness Day, teachers, students and
parents come together to make sure families are aware of the risks,  and
that backpacks are being worn properly; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1938,  Gerry Outdoors invented the modern backpack; it
was mainly used as a tool for outdoor recreation such as hiking, fishing
and camping trips; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thirty years later, in 1968,  lightweight  nylon  backpacks
were  introduced;  this expanded the use of backpacks to students across
the country; this was  also  the  year  JanSport,  the  world's  largest
backpack maker, went into business; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  2001,  the  American  Occupational Therapy Association
launched the  country's  first  ever  National  Backpack  Awareness  Day
dedicated to backpacks and safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
initiative, and more must be done to increase  activity  at  the  local,
State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  18,  2024,  as
School  Backpack  Awareness  Day  in  the  State  of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
