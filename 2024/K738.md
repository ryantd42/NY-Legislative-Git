  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 13, 2024 as Korean American Day in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
important  dates which remind us of the rich and diverse heritage of our
great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  13,  2024,  as
Korean American Day in the State of New York, and to recognize the 121st
Anniversary  of the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to the United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS, When the sons and daughters of other nations  move  to  the
United  States,  the traditions they carry with them greatly enhance and
strengthen the American population; and
 
  WHEREAS, The influence of Korean Americans may be  observed  in  all
facets  of American life, from politics to industry, entrepreneurship to
volunteerism, the arts, and education; and
 
  WHEREAS, In December of 1902, 56 men, 21 women and 25 children  left
Korea  and  traveled  across  the  Pacific  Ocean on the S.S. Gaelic and
landed in Honolulu, Hawaii, on January 13, 1903,  initiating  the  first
large wave of Korean immigration to America; and
 
  WHEREAS, These pioneer Korean immigrants faced tremendous social and
economic obstacles, as well as language barriers in America, the land of
opportunity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  pursuit  of  the  American  dream,  Korean  immigrants
initially served  as  farmworkers,  wage  laborers,  and  section  hands
throughout the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  First  generation Korean immigrants established a new home
in  a  new  land  through  resilience,  tenacious  effort,  and  immense
sacrifice,  which  became  the  bedrock  for  their  children and future
generations of Korean Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, The centennial year of 2003 marked an  important  milestone
in the history of Korean immigration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Korean Americans, like other groups of immigrants who came
to the United States before them, seeking a better life and opportunity,
have thrived in their new homeland due to a strong  work  ethic,  family
bonds, and community spirit; and
 
  WHEREAS, Korean Americans have made significant contributions to the
economic  vitality  of the United States, the State of New York, and the
global marketplace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Korean  Americans  have  invigorated  businesses,
not-for-profit  and  other  nongovernmental  organizations,  government,
technology, medicine, athletics,  arts  and  entertainment,  journalism,
churches,  academic  communities, and countless facets of American life;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Korean  Americans have built and strengthened the alliance
between the United States, the State of New York, and  the  Republic  of
Korea, fostering peace on the Korean Peninsula; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Korean  Americans  have made enormous contributions to the
military strength of the United States and served  with  distinction  in
the  Armed Forces during World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, the
conflict in Korea, and subsequent military conflicts across  the  globe;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Centennial Committees of Korean Immigration and Korean
Americans have designated January 13th of each year as  Korean  American
Day  to commemorate the first step of the long and prosperous journey of
Korean Americans in the United States: now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  January 13, 2024, as
Korean American Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
