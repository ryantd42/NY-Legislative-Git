  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February  2023,  as  Atherosclerotic  Cardiovascular
  Disease  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
  conjunction with the observance  of  American  Heart
  Month
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  February  2023,  as
Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Month in the State of  New  York,
in conjunction with the observance of American Heart Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Heart  Association  truly wants to help the
citizens of this great nation to live longer, healthier  lives  so  they
can  enjoy  all  of  life's  precious  moments;  American Heart Month, a
federally designated event, is a perfect  way  to  remind  Americans  to
focus  on their hearts and encourage them to get their families, friends
and communities involved; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year the  American  Heart  Association,  the  National
Heart,  Lung and Blood institute and other health-oriented organizations
celebrate American Heart Month to raise awareness of the seriousness  of
heart disease and to promote healthy lifestyles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States;
one in every four deaths is attributed to it, ahead of cancer,  diabetes
and  Alzheimer's  disease;  one  person dies every 37 seconds from heart
disease (also  known  as  cardiovascular  disease),  and  one  in  three
American  adults  (85  million  people)  live  with  some  form of heart
disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of us may  be  familiar  with  cardiovascular  events,
including  heart attack, stroke, and heart disease, though less familiar
with the underlying condition of atherosclerotic cardiovascular  disease
(ASCVD) causing these events; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately  21 million adults in the United States have
been diagnosed with ASCVD and are at risk of a cardiovascular event; and
 
  WHEREAS, ASCVD is linked to the build-up of low-density  lipoprotein
cholesterol  (LDL-C)  and  lipoprotein(a)  cholesterol  [Lp(a)]  in  the
arteries; and
 
  WHEREAS, Studies have shown nearly 70 million United  States  adults
had  higher  than  recommended LDL-C levels and one in five had elevated
Lp(a); and
 
  WHEREAS, Only 20  percent  of  people  with  ASCVD  who  are  taking
statins,  one  of the leading lipid-lowering therapies, actually achieve
healthy levels of LDL-C; and
 
  WHEREAS, Limited awareness of Lp(a) among providers and patients has
resulted  in  less  than  one percent of ASCVD patients being tested for
Lp(a) in  the  United  States,  leaving  them  at  risk  for  associated
cardiovascular events; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this health issue and more must be done  to  increase  activity  at  the
local,  state  and  national  levels  to  promote  screening and support
patients and their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  February  2023,  as
Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Month in the State of  New  York,
in  conjunction  with  the observance of American Heart Month; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
