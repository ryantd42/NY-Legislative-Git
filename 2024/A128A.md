 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  public  health  law, in relation to prohibiting
  virginity examinations
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1. Legislative Intent: Virginity examinations are gynecologi-
 cal examinations of the female genitalia purported to establish  whether
 a  female  has had vaginal intercourse by correlating the absence of the
 hymen or vaginal wall laxity with sexual activity. Reproductive  experts
 contend  that  there  is  no scientific merit or clinical indication for

  §  267-B.  PROHIBITION  OF VIRGINITY EXAMINATIONS.  1. FOR PURPOSES OF
