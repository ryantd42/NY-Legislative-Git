  Section 1. Section 8 of chapter 138 of the laws of 1998, amending  the

 operators born on or after January 1, 2000 and shall apply to all opera-
 tors born on or after January 1, 1981, provided  further  on  and  after
 January  1,  2001 and before January 1, 2002 such section shall apply to
 all operators born on or after January 1, 1978; provided further that on
