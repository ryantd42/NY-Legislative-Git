  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
 S. 8529  3
 
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  150
  - Average Age:  42.3
  - Average Service:  11.2
  - Average Salary:  81,500
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, a New York City Deputy Sheriff
 who becomes disabled due to a heart disease would  be  eligible  for  an
 applicable  ordinary disability retirement, generally a lifetime payment
 of 1/3 of salary.  The ordinary death benefit is  a  lump  sum  payment
 generally equal to three times the member's salary.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  the performance of duty disability
 benefit for NYCERS Deputy Sheriff members who are disabled from a  heart
 disease would be equal to:
  * 75% of Final Average Salary (FAS), where
  *  FAS  is defined as 3-Year FAS for Tier 4 and 5-Year FAS for Tier 6,
 without
  * an explicit Workers' Compensation offset.
  Under the proposed legislation, the performance of duty death  benefit
 would  generally  be  equal  to  a lifetime benefit of 50% of a member's
 wages earned during the last year of service, plus, if  applicable,  the
 Special  Accidental Death Benefit (SADB) payable under General Municipal
 Law section 208-f.
  SADB for Deputy Sheriffs was enacted by Chapter 720  of  the  Laws  of
 2023 and all accidental deaths are assumed to qualify for SADB.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  The  number  of  members and eligible retirees who will benefit in the
 future from this fiscal note is  unknown.  The  cost  of  this  proposed
 legislation could vary greatly depending on the number of future members
 who  benefit and on their length of service, age, and salary history. In
 particular, the increase would be greater for a member who  is  not  yet
 eligible  for  an  ODR benefit when the disabling heart disease is diag-
 nosed.
  The estimated financial impact for disabled members  has  been  calcu-
 lated assuming 50% would have retired under an Ordinary Disability bene-
 fit,  and  50%  would have continued working if the proposed legislation
 were not passed.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
