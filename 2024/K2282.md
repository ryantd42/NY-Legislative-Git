  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  July 2024, as Plastic Free Month in the State of New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern and in full accord with its long-
standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 2024, as Plastic Free
Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The goal of Plastic Free July Initiative is to educate the
people of New York of the importance of reusing, reducing, and recycling
plastic items; Plastic  Free  July  has  gained  momentum  in  over  100
countries, with over 1 million participants; and
 
  WHEREAS, Plastic Free July continues to accentuate the importance of
being green and continuing to reduce the amount of plastic we use in our
lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition,  Plastic  Free  July  seeks  to  stress  the
staggering amounts of plastic that have been produced globally;  studies
have  found that in the first 10 years of this century, more plastic was
produced than the entire last  century;  across  New  York  State,  9.37
billion  single-use  plastic  bags are disposed of; and in New York City
alone, 12.5 million dollars a year is spent on removing  plastic  waste;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Already,  the  ocean  is  filled  with 165 million tons of
plastic, and by 2050, plastic in the oceans will outweigh fish, predicts
a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in  partnership  with  the
World Economic Forum; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Plastic  Free July seeks to take small strides at changing
this global issue by starting  with  the  people,  challenging  them  to
refuse  to  use  single-use  plastic;  single  use plastic is defined as
plastic shopping bags, plastic  cups,  straws,  plastic  packaging,  and
anything that is expected only to be used once and then discarded; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  Yorkers  can  commemorate  this  initiative  by
participating in this challenge by giving up single  use  plastic  items
for a day, a week, or the whole month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In recognition of the great accomplishments of the Plastic
Free  July  Initiative,  an  educational  and  reaffirming  month-long
challenge is held across New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  commends  the  Plastic  Free July
Initiative for enlightening New Yorkers of the importance of reusing and
eliminating the usage of plastic items; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 2024, as Plastic Free
Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York,  and  to the events commemorating Plastic Free July throughout New
York State.
