  (r) (1) The following continuing education requirements shall apply to
 resident and non-resident persons  licensed  as  public  OR  INDEPENDENT

 ENT adjusters and any person previously so licensed  whose  license  was

  (A) Any person holding a license as a public OR  INDEPENDENT  adjuster
 shall,  during  each  full  biennial  licensing  period,  satisfactorily
 complete courses or programs of instruction or attend seminars as may be
 approved by the superintendent equivalent to  fifteen  credit  hours  of
 instruction.
  (B)  During the same calendar year biennial licensing period, a licen-
 see may  use  accumulated  continuing  education  credits  to  meet  the
 requirements  of  similar classes of licenses including those authorized
 by subsection (b) of section two thousand one hundred three, section two
 thousand one hundred four, section two thousand  one  hundred  seven  of

 uing education shall be:
  (i) Courses, programs of instruction or seminars, approved as to meth-
 od and content by the superintendent, covering portions of the principal
 branches  of  insurance related to the kinds of insurance covered by the

 education  department  at  the time the person takes the course, whether

 other institution, association,  trade  association  or  insurer,  which
 maintains  equivalent standards of instruction and which shall have been
 approved for such purpose by the superintendent.
  (ii) Continuing education as required by the state in which a  non-re-
 sident  licensee  resides  and  maintains an office, provided the super-
 intendent  deems  them  equivalent  to  New  York  continuing  education
 requirements.  If  the  state in which the non-resident licensee resides
 and maintains an office has no continuing education requirements, or the
 superintendent does not deem them equivalent, the licensee must  satisfy
 New York continuing education requirements.

 continuing education requirements for the last biennial licensing period
 were met.
  (C)  Any person whose license was not renewed pursuant to subparagraph
 (A) of this paragraph, who accumulates sufficient credit hours  for  the

 the continuing education requirements for the current biennial licensing
 period.
