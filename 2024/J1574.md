  LEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION memorializing Governor Kathy
  Hochul to proclaim May 28, 2024, as World Hunger Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help increase
awareness of serious issues that affect the lives of  many  citizens  of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul proclaim May 28, 2024, as World Hunger
Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of
World Hunger Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hunger is not just  about  food;  hunger  and  poverty  are
inextricably  linked  to a nexus of issues including: healthcare, decent
work opportunities, education, social justice, the rights of  women  and
girls, the environment and climate change; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Hunger Project, which initiated World Hunger Day, uses
an innovative, holistic approach that  tackles  all  these  issues,  and
empowers  people  living  in  hunger  to  become the agents of their own
development and lift their communities above the poverty line for good -
this is the sustainable end of poverty; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 820 million people  in  the  world  do  not  have
enough food; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hunger  is also a grave concern for the State of New York;
it is essential to eliminate this serious concern and to increase public
awareness of the extent to which it exists; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to Feeding  America,  there  are  more  than  2.6
million  New  Yorkers,  or  one in eight people, who are considered food
insecure, meaning they do not have enough food to live a  healthy  life;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  the youngest residents of the State of New York, food
insecurity  is  more  prevalent,  affecting  one  in  five  children;
furthermore, as of 2018, New York State has an estimated 91,897 citizens
experiencing homelessness on any given day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York  is  fully committed to bringing
awareness to solving hunger and homelessness in all its communities,  as
well as providing necessary resources to residents in need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  is  committed  to  working  with food pantries,
shelters, and other service  organizations  which  need  support;  these
organizations  provide  food,  secure places to sleep, and other aids to
those who need it the most; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
issue,  and  more  must be done to increase activity at the local, State
and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May  28,  2024,  as  World
Hunger Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
