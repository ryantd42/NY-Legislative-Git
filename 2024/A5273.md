  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of the law to the
 contrary, Ronald Bower,  an  employee  of  the  Genesee  County  Highway
 Department  and  a  member  of  the  New York state and local employees'
 retirement system, who was employed in the Occupational  Skills  Program
 at  Erie  1  BOCES beginning November 12, 1986 through July 6, 1988, who
 for reasons not ascribable to his own negligence,  failed  to  become  a
 member  of  such  retirement  system when first employed by Erie 1 BOCES
 beginning in 1986, shall be deemed to have been a member of the New York
 state and local employees'  retirement  system  on  such  date  that  he
 commenced  his  employment  with  Erie 1 BOCES on November 12, 1986, and
 shall be granted Tier IV status in such retirement system, provided that
 an application is filed with the head of the New York  state  and  local
 employees'  retirement system within one year from the effective date of
 this act. Upon the granting of such retroactive membership, Ronald Bower
 shall not be granted a refund of any employee contribution made  by  him

  This  bill would grant retroactive Tier 4 status in the New York State
 and Local Employees' Retirement System to Ronald Bower, a current Tier 6
 member employed by the Genesee County Highway  Department,  by  changing
 their  date  of  membership  to  November 12, 1986, when they were first
 employed  by  Erie  1  BOCES. There will be no refund of member contrib-
 utions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase  of  approximately  $3,200  in  the
 annual  contributions of Genesee County for the fiscal year ending March
 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates  and
 salary of Ronald Bower change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service  cost of approximately $8,040 which will be
 borne by Erie 1 BOCES as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes  that
 payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
