  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
citizens  of  the  State  of  New York whose lifework and civic endeavor
served to enhance the quality of life in their communities and the great
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly moved to mourn
the death of Officer Jose Colon; and

showing  a deep commitment to upholding American values and ideals while
valiantly protecting our cherished freedoms; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon returning to civilian life, his desire to protect  and
serve  found a new home as he joined the New York City Police Department
(NYPD) on March 15, 2000; Officer Jose Colon became a steadfast presence
in the 40th Precinct, his badge a symbol of safety  and  his  actions  a
source of hope for the Bronx community he so dearly protected; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the day of the attacks of September 11, 2001, one of the
most  profound  tragedies  in  our  State  and  Nation's shared history,
Officer Jose Colon of  the  NYPD  selflessly  responded  to  the  scene,
standing  shoulder to shoulder among countless first responders, working
tirelessly to aid his city when it needed his support most; and
 
  WHEREAS, Retiring in 2020 after a twenty-year career  with  the  New
York  Police  Department,  Officer  Jose Colon later joined the Brewster
Police Department in 2024, where  he  made  a  name  for  himself  as  a
professional and devoted asset to the department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The legacy which Officer Jose Colon created throughout his
lifetime lives on in all those who had the  pleasure  of  working  with,
knowing,  and  befriending  him,  with  members  of  his  large  family
continuing in his path by becoming NYPD officers themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS, He is survived by his wife,  Lilian  Colon;  sons,  Joshua,
Dean  and  Aaron;  daughters,  Amanda,  Destiny,  Larisa,  and  Elisa;
grandchildren, Isaiah, Lilyana, Juliana, Sebastian, Elijah, Zachary, and
Gabriel; and
 
  WHEREAS, Officer Jose Colon's actions always demonstrated  the  very
essence  of  heroism;  he  served his community and those laying beyond,
with pride, an unending commitment to service, integrity,  and  passion,
and  justly  merits the commendation of all citizens of this great State
and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Armed with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a  sense  of
compassion,  Officer  Jose  Colon leaves behind a legacy which will long
endure the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory to all
he served and befriended; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to

enforcement  officer,  and  active  member  of  his community; and be it
