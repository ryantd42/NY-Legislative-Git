  COMMEMORATING  the 100th Anniversary of the Rotary
  Club of Kenmore
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Rotary  Club  of  Kenmore,  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  world's first service club, Rotary International, was
founded on February 23, 1905, when Paul Harris,  a  native  of  Vermont,
found  himself  a  stranger  in  Chicago;  he  conceived  of the idea of
inviting three men  of  different  vocations  to  join  him  weekly  for
fellowship and to discuss each other's problems and business; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today, Rotary International has grown into an organization
including over 1.2 million members in approximately 29,000 clubs  across
the  163  countries;  each club is made up of professionals and business
leaders who  are  dedicated  to  humanitarian  service,  encourage  high
ethical standards in all vocations, and to help build peace and goodwill
throughout the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in 1924, the Rotary Club of Kenmore is one of
the older and larger clubs within Rotary District 7090; and
 
  WHEREAS, Locally, this vital club, together with its Kenmore  Rotary
Foundation, has generously supported organizations such as Kenmore Mercy
Hospital,  Kenmore  Paramedics,  Kenmore Meals on Wheels, and many other
initiatives which not only serve Kenmore, but the  greater  Western  New
York Community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Rotary Club of Kenmore also provides scholarships and
awards to middle and high school students in Kenmore and Tonawanda,  and
steadfastly supports The Both Your Hands - Interact Club at Kenmore West
High School; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A progressive and open club, the Kenmore Rotary is made up
of business, professional, and civic-minded men and women  who  want  to
have  a  positive  influence,  meet new people, network with others, and
have  fun;  its  members  generously  give,  but  in  return  receive
camaraderie,  business, and social networking, as well as leadership and
personal growth opportunities; and
 
  WHEREAS, In keeping with  its  motto  of  service  above  self,  the
Kenmore  Rotary  Club  has  steadfastly  supported  a  diverse  array of
programs, including those which strive to eradicate polio,  as  well  as
those  which  seek  to improve our communities and the world we live in;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The success  of  the  Kenmore  Rotary  Club  is  in  direct
correlation  to  the efforts of its dedicated members, whose involvement
is, and always has been, characterized by an impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Rotary Club of Kenmore; and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Rotary Club of Kenmore.
