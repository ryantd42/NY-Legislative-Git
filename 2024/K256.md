BY: M. of A. Walsh
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 11, 2023, as Submarine Day in the State of New
  York, in conjunction with the observance of National
  Submarine Day
 
  WHEREAS, Submarines and the brave men and women who crew them play a
critical role in the defense  of  our  Nation,  and  the  protection  of
citizens of the great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  the  American  submarine community celebrates
National Submarine Day on the anniversary of United States  government's
acquisition of its first modern commissioned submarine, the USS Holland,
on April 11, 1900; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The United States Navy was born in Whitehall, New York, in
the summer of 1775, with the establishment of an American fleet; and
 
  WHEREAS, United  States  Attack  Submarines  are  named  after  U.S.
cities, including the USS Albany and the USS Buffalo; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  City  is  home to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space
Museum, a military and maritime history  museum  with  a  collection  of
museum  ships, and the New York State Submariners Memorial is located in
the Village of  Ballston  Spa,  the  first  memorial  dedicated  to  the
Submariners  from  a  State  rather  than  the Submarine from which they
served; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  submarine  is  a  watercraft  capable  of  independent
operation  underwater,  and  differs  from a submersible, which has more
limited underwater capability; and
 
  WHEREAS, The term submarine most commonly refers to a  large  crewed
autonomous  vessel,  but historically or colloquially, can also refer to
medium-sized or smaller vessels, as well as remotely  operated  vehicles
or robots; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Named  after  its  inventor,  John Philip Holland, the USS
Holland was  designed  in  1896,  and  launched  on  May  17,  1897,  in
Elizabeth,  New  Jersey;  considered the first truly successful craft of
its kind, the vessel rendered valuable service to the United States Navy
until its decommissioning in 1905; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prior to the purchase of the USS Holland, the  first  known
military  submarine  built  in  the United States was the Turtle, a ship
which saw action in the Revolutionary War era, but before  the  creation
of the official United States Navy; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1862, the United States Navy launched the USS Alligator,
its  first  submarine and fourth Navy ship of that name during the Civil
War; however, it was never officially commissioned, and sank due to  bad
weather  while  attempting to take part in an attack on the Confederacy;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the past 123 years,  America's  submarines  have
played  a vital part in wars in which our Nation's freedom was at stake,
as well as in the preservation of naval security and strategic readiness
during peacetime; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  very  pleased  to  have  this
opportunity to express its gratitude to our exceptional submarine  fleet
and the courageous men and women, past and present, of the United States
Armed  Forces  for  their  tremendous  sacrifices  made on behalf of our
Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  11,  2023, as
Submarine Day in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Submarine Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
