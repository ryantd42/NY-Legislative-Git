  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2023, as American Heart Month in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2023, as American
Heart Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National American Heart Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Heart  Association  truly wants to help the
citizens of this great nation to live longer, healthier  lives  so  they
can  enjoy  all  of  life's  precious  moments;  American Heart Month, a
federally designated event, is a perfect  way  to  remind  Americans  to
focus  on their hearts and encourage them to get their families, friends
and communities involved; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year the  American  Heart  Association,  the  National
Heart,  Lung and Blood institute and other health-oriented organizations
celebrate American Heart Month to raise awareness of the seriousness  of
heart disease and to promote healthy lifestyles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States;
one in every four deaths is attributed to it, ahead of cancer,  diabetes
and  Alzheimer's  disease;  one  person dies every 37 seconds from heart
disease (also  known  as  cardiovascular  disease),  and  one  in  three
American  adults  (85  million  people)  live  with  some  form of heart
disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Heart disease cost the  United  States  approximately  $219
billion  each  year  from 2014 to 2015; this includes the cost of health
care services and medicines, and this figure is growing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Coronary Artery Disease is the most common  type  of  heart
disease,  with  two  in 10 deaths resulting from heart disease in people
under 65 years old; and
 
  WHEREAS, In New York, heart disease incidence is highest in Chenango
County, followed by Cattaraugus, Niagara, Orleans, Richmond, Montgomery,
and Chautauqua counties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Heart  disease  is  significantly  influenced  by  one's
environment,  specifically  by  factors  like maternal and child health,
access to educational  opportunities,  availability  of  healthy  foods,
physical  education,  extracurricular  activities  in  schools,  and
opportunities  for  physical  activity,  such  as  safe  and  walkable
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition,  it  is  vital  to  maintain quality working
conditions and worksite health, as well  as  availability  of  community
support and resources and access to affordable, quality health care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  reported  by  The National Institutes of Health, heart
disease  is  particularly  prevalent  among  the  African  American  and
Hispanic/Latino  populations,  with  African  Americans  being  30% more
likely to develop  heart  disease  than  non-Hispanic  whites;  risk  is
particularly high for African American women; and
 
  WHEREAS, Heart disease is preventable by targeting risk factors such
as  smoking,  high  cholesterol  levels,  and  maintaining  normal blood
pressure; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this  health  issue  and  more  must be done to increase activity at the
local, state and  national  levels  to  promote  screening  and  support
patients and their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2023, as American
Heart Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
