  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing an amendment to section 14 of article 3 of  the  constitution,
  in  relation  to  prohibiting  the  governor from issuing a message of
  necessity for budget related bills

  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 14 of article
 3 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 14. No bill shall be passed or become a law  unless  it  shall  have
 been  printed  and  upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at
 least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage, unless
 the governor, or the acting governor, shall have certified, under his or
 her hand and the seal of the state, the facts which in his or her  opin-
 ion  necessitate an immediate vote thereon, in which case it must never-
 theless be upon the desks of the members in final form, not  necessarily
 printed,  before  its  final  passage, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, SUCH IMMEDIATE
 VOTE SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED FOR  BUDGET  BILLS  OR  APPROPRIATION  BILLS
 RELATING  THERETO;  nor shall any bill be passed or become a law, except
 by the assent of a majority of the members elected to each branch of the
 legislature; and upon the last reading of a bill, no  amendment  thereof
 shall be allowed, and the question upon its final passage shall be taken
 immediately thereafter, and the ayes and nays entered on the journal.
  For purposes of this section, a bill shall be deemed to be printed and
 upon the desks of the members if: it is set forth in a legible electron-
 ic  format  by  electronic means, and it is available for review in such
 format at the desks of the members. For purposes of this section  "elec-
 tronic  means"  means  any method of transmission of information between
 computers or other machines designed for  the  purpose  of  sending  and
 receiving  such  transmissions  and  which:  allows  the  recipient  to
 reproduce  the  information  transmitted  in  a  tangible  medium  of
 expression; and does not permit additions, deletions or other changes to
 be made without leaving an adequate record thereof.
