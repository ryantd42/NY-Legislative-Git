 amended to read as follows:
  1. No drug for which a prescription is required by the  provisions  of
 the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or by the commissioner of health
 shall  be  distributed  or  dispensed  to  any  person  except  upon  a
 prescription written by  a  person  legally  authorized  to  issue  such
 prescription.  Such  drug shall be compounded or dispensed by a licensed
 pharmacist, and no such drug shall be dispensed without affixing to  the
 immediate container in which the drug is sold or dispensed a label bear-
 ing  the  name and address of the owner of the establishment in which it
 was dispensed, the date compounded, the number of the prescription under
 which it is recorded in the pharmacist's prescription files, the name of
 the prescriber,  the  name  and  address  of  the  patient,  A  PHYSICAL
 DESCRIPTION  OF THE DRUG INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE SIZE, SHAPE,
 COLOR, AND IMPRINT OF THE DRUG, and the directions for the  use  of  the
 drug  by  the  patient  as given upon the prescription. All labels shall
 conform to such rules and regulations as promulgated by the commissioner
 pursuant to section sixty-eight hundred twenty-nine of this article. The
 prescribing and dispensing of a drug which  is  a  controlled  substance
 shall  be subject to additional requirements provided in article thirty-
 three of the public health  law.  The  words  "drug"  and  "prescription
 required drug" within the meaning of this article shall not be construed
 to  include soft or hard contact lenses, eyeglasses, or any other device
 for the aid or correction of vision. Nothing in this  subdivision  shall
 prevent a pharmacy from furnishing a drug to another pharmacy which does
 not have such drug in stock for the purpose of filling a prescription.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
