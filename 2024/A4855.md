 Introduced  by M. of A. RAMOS -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Governmental Operations
 
 AN ACT to amend the public officers law, in relation to the  removal  of
  residency penalties related to employment by any political subdivision
  or municipal corporation of the state

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative finding and declaration. The legislature hereby
 finds and declares that there is a substantial  state  interest  in  the
 fair and equitable treatment of public officers throughout the state who
 are  permitted to reside in localities outside the political subdivision
 or municipal corporation of the state for which they work. That substan-
 tial state interest would be furthered by establishing that  any  public
 officer  who resides in a permitted locality shall not be subject to any
 levy or payment by residing in a permitted  locality.  Therefore,  the
 legislature  declares  the  necessity  for  the enactment of this act to
 establish that any public officer who is or becomes a nonresident  of  a
 political subdivision or municipal corporation of the state for which he
 or  she  is  employed  shall  not  be obligated to forgo wages or make a
 payment because he or she is or becomes a nonresident by residing  in  a
 locality permitted by state or other applicable law.
  §  2.  Section 3 of the public officers law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 73 to read as follows:
  73. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION OR OF ANY  GENERAL,
 SPECIAL  OR  LOCAL  LAW,  CHARTER,  CODE, ORDINANCE, RESOLUTION, RULE OR
 REGULATION TO THE CONTRARY, ANY PERSON SUBJECT TO THE RESIDENCY REQUIRE-
 MENTS OF THIS SECTION WHO RESIDES IN A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OR  MUNICI-
 PAL  CORPORATION  PERMITTED  BY THIS SECTION OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE LAW
 SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED OR REQUIRED TO  FORGO  OR  MAKE  ANY  PAYMENT  OR
 SATISFY  ANY  LEVY PURSUANT TO A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT OR AN AGREEMENT
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 BY SUCH PERSON IF SUCH PERSON IS OR BECOMES A NONRESIDENT OF  THE  POLI-
 TICAL SUBDIVISION OR MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF THE STATE.
  §  3. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law. Effective  immediately
 the  addition,  amendment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation neces-
 sary for the implementation of  this  act  on  its  effective  date  are
