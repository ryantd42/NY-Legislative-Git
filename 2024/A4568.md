 contracted service provider or worker placed within such school under  a
 public  assistance employment program, pursuant to title nine-B of arti-
 cle five of the social services law, and consistent with the  provisions
 of such title for the provision of services to such school, its students

 ee], as defined in this paragraph, in accordance with this section.
  b. "Volunteer" shall mean any person,  other  than  an  employee,  who

  2. [Any] EVERY nonpublic or private  elementary  or  secondary  school
 [may]  SHALL  require,  for  the  purposes  of a criminal history record

 valid clearance pursuant to such section or pursuant  to  section  three
 thousand  four-b  of  this  article  or  section five hundred nine-cc or

 initiating  the  fingerprinting  process, the prospective employer shall
 furnish the applicant with the form described in paragraph (c) of subdi-
 vision thirty of section three hundred five of this  chapter  and  shall
 obtain  the  applicant's  consent to the criminal history record search.
 Every set of fingerprints  taken  pursuant  to  this  section  shall  be
 promptly submitted to the commissioner for the purposes of clearance for
 employment.
  3.  (a)  Any  nonpublic  or private elementary or secondary school may
 conditionally appoint a prospective employee. A request for  conditional
 clearance  [may]  SHALL  be forwarded to the commissioner along with the
 prospective employee's fingerprints. Such  appointment  may  be  delayed
 until notification by the commissioner that the prospective employee has
 been  conditionally  cleared for employment and shall terminate when the
 prospective employer is notified of a determination by the  commissioner
 to  grant  or deny clearance, provided that if clearance is granted, the
 appointment shall continue and the conditional status shall be  removed.
 Prior  to  commencement of such conditional appointment, the prospective
 employer shall obtain a signed  statement  for  conditional  appointment
 from the prospective employee, indicating whether, to the best of his or
 her  knowledge,  he  or  she  has  a pending criminal charge or criminal
 conviction in any jurisdiction outside the state.

 an emergency conditional appointment when an unforeseen emergency vacan-
 cy  has  occurred. When such appointment is made, the process for condi-
 tional appointment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this  subdivision  [may]
 SHALL  also be initiated. Emergency conditional appointment may commence
 prior to notification from the commissioner on conditional clearance and
 shall terminate when the prospective employer is notified by the commis-
 sioner regarding conditional clearance,  provided  that  if  conditional
 clearance  is  granted,  the  appointment  may continue as a conditional
 appointment.  Prior  to  the  commencement  of  such  appointment,  the
 A. 4568  4
 
 prospective employer must obtain a signed statement for emergency condi-
 tional appointment from the prospective employee, indicating whether, to
 the  best  of  his  or  her  knowledge, he or she has a pending criminal
 charge  or criminal conviction in any jurisdiction. An "unforeseen emer-
 gency vacancy" shall be defined as: (i) a  vacancy  that  occurred  less
 than ten business days before the start of any school session, including
 summer  school,  or  during any school session, including summer school,
 without sufficient notice to allow for clearance or  conditional  clear-
 ance;  (ii)  when  no  other  qualified  person is available to fill the
 vacancy temporarily; and (iii) when emergency conditional appointment is
 necessary to maintain services which the school is legally  required  to
 provide or services necessary to protect the health, education or safety
 of students or staff.
  (c)  Each  nonpublic or private elementary or secondary school[, which
 elects to fingerprint prospective employees pursuant to subdivision  two
 of  this section,] shall develop a policy for the safety of the children
 who have contact with an employee  holding  conditional  appointment  or
 emergency conditional appointment.

 ments to paragraph (d) of subdivision 30 of section 305 of the education
 law made by section three of this act shall not  affect  the  expiration
 and  repeal  of  such  paragraph and shall expire and be deemed repealed
