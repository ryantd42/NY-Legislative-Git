  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would permit Suffolk  County  or  any  town  or  village  in
 Suffolk County that participates in the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees'  Retirement  System to elect to provide individuals employed in the
 title of Fire Marshal I or supervisors of  such  title,  the  option  to
 retire upon completion of twenty-five years of creditable service with a
 benefit  of  one-half  of  final  average salary (FAS) and an additional
 benefit of one-sixtieth of FAS for each year of  creditable  service  in
 excess of twenty-five years, not to exceed three-fourths (75%) of FAS.
  Additionally,  for those members covered under the provisions of Arti-
 cle 14, this bill would permit an irrevocable election  to  forfeit  the
 benefits  of  Article  14 in favor of the twenty-five-year plan benefit.
 Such election must be made within one  year  of  the  election  of  such
 member's employer to provide these benefits or within one year of enter-
 ing  employment  with  a participating Suffolk County employer in any of
 the above titles, whichever comes later.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase in the annual contributions of  any
 electing employer of approximately 5% of the salary paid to employees in
 covered  titles  for  the  fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.  In future
 years, this cost will vary as the billing rates of the affected  members
 change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service  cost  which  will be borne by the electing
 employer as a one-time payment. This cost is expected to average approx-
 imately 36% of the salary paid to employees in  covered  titles.  This
 S. 9870  6
 
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1st in the fiscal
 year following the employer election.
  Further,  we  anticipate  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 provisions of this legislation.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could  be  affected  by  this  legislation cannot be readily determined.
 Prior to electing to provide these benefits, an eligible employer  would
 be  required  to submit a roster of individuals in covered titles to the
 New York State and Local Retirement System. This roster would be used to
 develop an exact cost for the individual employer  electing  to  provide
 these benefits.
