  Section  1.  Section  2 of the volunteer firefighters' benefit law, as
 amended by chapter 476 of the laws  of  2018,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  § 2. Purpose.  One of the finest traditions of American community life
 is  the  service  which  people render to others [without remuneration].
 Volunteer firefighters have long been in the forefront of this group. In
 recognition of the unselfish service by these volunteers, government has
 undertaken to provide for  them  and  their  families  some  measure  of
 protection against loss from death or injuries in line of duty. Over the
 years there has developed a dual system of benefits when volunteer fire-
 fighters  are  killed or injured. The dual system has caused uncertainty
 and confusion. This law establishes a new single system of benefits  for
 volunteer  firefighters  and  provides  for  the  administration of such
 system by the workers' compensation  board  and  the  chairman  of  such
 board.
  It  is hereby declared that this chapter is intended to effectuate the
 objects and purposes of section eighteen of article  one  of  the  state
 constitution and that the relationship between the political subdivision
 liable for benefits under this chapter and a volunteer firefighter enti-
 tled  to such benefits is that of employer and employee within the mean-
 ing of such provision of the state constitution.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 3 of the volunteer firefighters' benefit
 law, as amended by chapter 458 of the laws of 1996, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  3.  "Line of duty" means the performance by a volunteer firefighter as
 a volunteer firefighter of the duties and activities described in subdi-
 vision one of section five of this chapter and the same such duties  and
 activities  performed for a specialized team established pursuant to the
 provisions of section two hundred nine-bb of the general  municipal  law
 for which the volunteer firefighter does not receive any remuneration or
 a  gratuity  and shall be deemed to include any date of injury as deter-
 mined by the workers' compensation board pursuant to the  provisions  of
 section  forty-one of this chapter. The following shall not be deemed to
 be remuneration or a gratuity: PAYMENT  OF  A  STIPEND  AS  OUTLINED  IN
 SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED-AA  OF THE GENERAL MUNICIPAL LAW; reimbursement of
 expenses for meals, lodging and actual and necessary travel; the receipt
 of a mileage allowance in  lieu  of  travel  expense;  reimbursement  of
 expenses  for registration and tuition fees payable under section seven-
 ty-two-g of the general municipal law, and the acceptance of transporta-
 tion, food, drink, shelter, clothing and similar items while on duty  or
 engaged in such activities.
  §  3.  The  general  municipal  law is amended by adding a new section
 200-aa to read as follows:
  § 200-AA. STIPEND FOR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS. 1. FOR PURPOSES OF  THIS

 the duties and activities described in subdivision one of  section  five
 of  the volunteer firefighters' benefit law and the same such duties and
 activities performed for a specialized team established pursuant to  the
 provisions  of section two hundred nine-bb of this article for which the
 volunteer firefighter does not receive any remuneration  or  a  gratuity
 and  shall  be deemed to include any date of injury as determined by the
 workers' compensation  board  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  section
 forty-one  of  the  volunteer  firefighters'  benefit law. The following
 shall not be deemed to be remuneration or a gratuity:  reimbursement  of

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would revise the terms of  participation  in  the  New  York
 State  and  Local Retirement Systems (NYSLRS) Contribution Stabilization
 Program (CSP). Participating employers in the NYSLRS may enter  the  CSP
 to  reduce  volatility  in  average  annual  contribution  rates. Should
 employer billing rates increase rapidly, the CSP allows a portion of the
 increase to be amortized over 10 years for the regular CSP or  12  years
 for  the alternative CSP.  Should employer billing rates decrease rapid-
 ly, the CSP requires  employers  to  make  an  additional  contribution,
 called  a graded payment. The graded payment is deposited into an inter-
 est-bearing reserve fund held within the NYSLRS for the exclusive use by
 the employer to reduce future amortizations.
  This bill revises the CSP in the following ways:
  1) Limits the value of the reserve fund assets. Graded payments  would
 cease  when  the  employer's  reserve  fund assets exceed the employer's
 actuarial contribution in the prior fiscal year. Currently, the  reserve
 fund is capped at 100% of the employer's payroll.
  2)  Creates  provisions  for  termination  from  the  CSP,  subject to
 approval by the Comptroller, provided all prior year  amortizations  are
 paid  in  full,  including interest. Beginning the fiscal year following
 termination, the employer would not be required (or allowed) to  make  a
 graded payment. Any existing reserve fund assets would be used to reduce
 future  annual  bills up to the amount the employer would have been able
 to amortize if still in the program.  The employer would be permitted to
 re-enter the regular CSP only if  eligible  to  amortize,  provided  all
 reserve fund assets are depleted.
  3)  Allows  an  employer  to  utilize its reserve fund assets to pay a
 portion of  its  annual  bill  when  the  employer's  average  actuarial
 contribution  rate  exceeds  the employer's graded rate.  Currently, the
 employer's average actuarial rate must exceed the System graded rate.

 mechanisms  which  may  be used to reduce the debt service that would be
 payable by the agency on its mental health services facilities  improve-
 ment  bonds  and notes and all other expenditures of the agency incident
 to  and  necessary or convenient to providing the facilities development
 corporation, or any successor agency, with funds for  the  financing  or
 refinancing of or for any such design, construction, acquisition, recon-

 useful life, as certified by the facilities development corporation,  of
 the  projects  for which the bonds are issued, and in any case shall not
 exceed thirty years and the maximum maturity of notes  or  any  renewals
 thereof  shall not exceed five years from the date of the original issue
 of such notes. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the agen-

  § 8. This act shall take effect immediately.

  PART EE
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "democracy
 preservation act".
  §  2.  Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds and declares
 that New York state welcomes immigrants, visitors,  and  investors  from
 around the world. However, its elections should be decided by the people
 of  New  York and not by foreign investors or the business entities over
 which they exert influence. Corporations with partial foreign  ownership
 have  been  spending money to influence state and local elections in New
 York and around the country. The public has  a  compelling  interest  in
 limiting the participation of foreign entities in activities of American
 democratic  self-government,  which  include spending money to influence
 voters and finance campaigns, in  the  interest  of  preventing  foreign
 influence over the United States political process.
  Investors are the ultimate beneficiaries of corporate interests. Where
 part  of  the shareholders' equity is attributable to foreign investors,
 spending corporate treasury funds on New York elections  means  spending
 the equity of foreign entities on New York elections.
  Business  corporations  and  similar entities have a fiduciary duty to
 their shareholders, including investors around the world, and  generally
 prioritize  the  interests  of  such  shareholders,  which  may  diverge
 substantially from the interests of the people of New York and of  citi-
 zens of the United States. In addition, both formal procedures of corpo-
 rate  democracy and informal mechanisms of influence can provide foreign
 investors with substantial  influence  even  with  only  a  minority  of
 shares.  The  United  States  Securities  and Exchange Commission, major
 capital investors, corporate managers, and corporate governance  experts
 broadly agree that ownership or control of one percent or more of shares
 can confer substantial influence on corporate decision-making.
  Political spending by foreign-influenced business entities can weaken,
 interfere with, or disrupt New York's democratic self-government and the
 faith  that  the electorate has in its elected officials. To protect the
 integrity of New York's democratic self-government, it is  necessary  to
 prevent  foreign-influenced  business entities from influencing New York
 elections through political spending.
  § 3. The election law is amended by adding a  new  section  14-117  to

  Section 1. Declaration of policy and statement of purpose. It being in
 the  vital interest of the general public that public works in the state
 of New York be administered efficiently and at a reasonable and  equita-
 ble  cost;  and, the unforeseen emergency of unanticipated escalation in
 construction materials prices having imposed substantial  inequity  upon
 contractors  who  have  heretofore  been  awarded contracts after public
 bidding; and, such inequity having threatened the ability of contractors
 to fulfill contracts so awarded; and, in order to perpetuate  the  bene-
 fits  derived  by  the general public from the existing system of public
 bidding, and to assure the continuance of  the  orderly  performance  of
 contracts heretofore awarded as a result of such public bidding; and, it
 being in the best interest to provide equitable relief to those contrac-
 tors who, having been awarded public contracts, have sustained damage by
 reason  of  such  construction  materials  price escalation, this act is
 hereby enacted.
  § 2. Whenever the terms and  conditions  of  a  construction  contract
 awarded  by  the state of New York or a public benefit corporation based
 upon bids submitted prior to April 1, 2020 but only for which  materials
 were  purchased or invoiced after March 1, 2020, require a contractor to
 furnish materials in such contract pertaining to such construction mate-
 rials may be adjusted upon a determination made by the  officer  of  the
 department,  board,  agency  or  public benefit corporation that awarded
 such contract that there has been an increase in the cost of acquisition
 by the contractor, subcontractor or supplier of materials of such  mate-
 rials in excess of five percent, determined as of the time of the award.
 Such a determination shall be based upon the available evidence, includ-
 ing  but  not  limited to, an appropriate nationally recognized economic
 index published by the United States department of labor or other appro-
 priate organization. In the case of any state department or  agency  any
 such  increase in contract price shall be subject to the approval of the
 state comptroller.  Any contractor, subcontractor or supplier of materi-
 als who receives an increase in the cost of construction materials shall
 also be subject to a downward adjustment in construction materials pric-
 es for subsequent de-escalation which may result in a price being  lower
 than  the  original  bid  price. Any contractor requesting an adjustment
 shall make application in writing submitting documentary evidence to the
 office of the department, board, agency or  public  benefit  corporation
 S. 4005--B  88
 
 that  awarded the contract establishing such increase in accordance with
 the requirements of the department,  board,  agency  or  public  benefit
 corporation, which evidence shall be subject to public inspection during
 regular  business  hours. Any subsequent decrease or de-escalation shall
 be made upon a determination by the officer of  the  department,  board,
 agency  or  public  benefit  corporation that awarded such contract that
 there has been a subsequent decrease in the cost of acquisition of  such
 construction  materials  by the contractor, subcontractor or supplier of
 materials. Such a  determination  shall  be  based  upon  the  available
 evidence, including but not limited to, an appropriate nationally recog-
 nized  economic index published by the United States department of labor
 or other appropriate organization.  Upon the agreement of  the  parties,
 the  contract  may  be  amended  in  writing to reflect the increased or
 decreased cost of acquisition of such materials insofar  as  it  exceeds
 five  percent thereof and such contract amendment shall state the amount
 of adjustment and the basis therefor, but in no event shall direct labor
 costs, additional profit or overhead be part of such adjustment. To  the
 extent a construction contract is subject to approval by the state comp-
 troller,  and  as  to  the form and manner of execution, by the attorney
 general, every such contract amendment shall be subject to the  approval
 of the state comptroller, and as to form and manner of execution, by the
 attorney  general.  No  adjustment  shall be granted in an amount which,
 together with any other sum obligated under the contract,  shall  exceed
 the money appropriated or otherwise lawfully available for the project.
  §  3.  (a)  The  commissioner  of  general services in contracting for
 commodities is authorized, with the approval of the  state  comptroller,
 to  terminate or suspend for a part of its term any state contract award
 for the purchase of commodities upon written application for such termi-
 nation or suspension by the vendor, where extraordinary  and  unforeseen
 general  market  conditions  have caused increases in the vendor's costs
 for construction materials or  other  physical  elements  consisting  of
 construction materials to be sold under the contract, where the contract
 covers  materials  which were purchased or invoiced after March 1, 2020,
 and the  commissioner  of  general  services  determines  upon  evidence
 furnished  by  the vendor as required and deemed to be sufficient by the
 commissioner that as the direct and sole result of such increases during
 the term of the contract, which exceed five percent of the  contractor's
 aggregate  acquisition costs determined as of the time of the award, the
 contractor has incurred or  will  incur  an  actual  net  loss  on  such
 contract  from  the  estimated  sales  made  under  the contract and the
 contractor would continue to incur such net losses unless  the  contract
 is suspended or terminated. Such a determination shall be based upon the
 available  evidence,  including  but  not  limited  to,  an  appropriate
 nationally recognized economic index  published  by  the  United  States
 department of labor or other appropriate organization.
  (b)  The  commissioner  of  general  services  is  further authorized,
 following the determination made pursuant to the provisions of  subdivi-
 sion  (a) of this section that the contractor has incurred or will incur
 an actual net loss on such  contract  from  the  sales  made  under  the
 contract, to grant an increase or increases in the prices of the commod-
 ities specified by the contract, in amounts necessary to prevent further
 net losses to the contractor on such contract from deliveries to be made
 thereafter  under  the  contract,  as compensation for and not exceeding
 increases of the contractor's  acquisition  costs  during  the  contract
 term.  Any  such  increase  in  contract  prices shall be subject to the
 approval of the  state  comptroller.  Any  contractor  who  receives  an
 S. 4005--B  89
 
 increase  in  the  price  of  the commodities shall also be subject to a
 downward adjustment in the  price  of  the  commodities  for  subsequent
 de-escalation  which may result in a price being lower than the original
 bid price. Any subsequent decrease or de-escalation shall be made upon a
 determination  by the officer of the department, board, agency or public
 benefit corporation that awarded such contract that  there  has  been  a
 subsequent  decrease  in  the  cost  of acquisition of such construction
 materials by the contractor, subcontractor  or  supplier  of  materials.
 Such a determination shall be based upon the available evidence, includ-
 ing  but  not  limited to, an appropriate nationally recognized economic
 index published by the United States department of labor or other appro-
 priate organization.
  (c) All records, books and  documents  of  the  contractor  which  are
 related  or  useful  to  the  determinations made by the commissioner of
 general services and to the approval of the state comptroller  hereunder
 shall be subject to audit and examination by the state comptroller.
  §  4.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed June 30, 2024.

  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation would amend subdivision c
 of section 513 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to allow
 New York City Fire Pension Fund (FIRE) members  subject  to  Article  14
 (Tier  3, Tier 3 Modified, and Tier 3 Enhanced) to obtain service credit
 for service rendered as an emergency medical technician (EMT)  with  the
 New York City Employee's Retirement System (NYCERS).
  The EMT service credit with NYCERS must immediately precede service in
 FIRE. If properly transferred or purchased, such service shall be deemed
 as  pensionable  service for purposes of determining the eligibility for
 benefits and benefit amounts in FIRE.
  Upon attaining eligible service credit with  FIRE,  the  member  would
 relinquish prior membership and applicable benefits with NYCERS.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT  ON BENEFITS/PAYABILITY: Currently, the purchase or transfer of
 service rendered as a NYCERS EMT member does not provide  an  additional
 service retirement benefit for FIRE members subject to Article 14.
  Under  the  proposed legislation, EMT service transferred or purchased
 would count for purposes of determining benefit amounts and  eligibility
 in  FIRE  and  would  increase  and/or accelerate the payability date of
 benefits.
  MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS: Member contributions as defined in  Article  14,
 plus  5.0%  annual  interest,  for  EMT service purchased or transferred
 would apply.
 S. 4005--B  104
 
  Member contributions made as a NYCERS EMT  member  in  excess  of  the
 amount  required  would, if not otherwise utilized for a separate vested
 benefit, be refunded with 5.0% annual interest.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census data and the
 actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of
 this  proposed  legislation  would  result in an increase in the present
 value of future employer contributions of approximately $19.3 million.
  This net increase is a result of an increase in the Present  Value  of
 Future  Benefits (PVFB) of approximately $16.7 million and a decrease in
 the present value of member contributions of approximately $2.6 million.
  Under the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the  employer
 contributions  to  FIRE,  there  would  be  an  increase in the Unfunded
 Accrued Liability (UAL) of  approximately  $40.6  million  offset  by  a
 decrease in the present value of future employer Normal Cost of approxi-
 mately $21.3 million.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer contributions of approximately $3.9 million which is the result
 of  a decrease in the Normal Cost offset by the UAL payment. The average
 annual employer cost per member included in this fiscal note is approxi-
 mately $3,100.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 19 years
 and the increase in UAL was therefore amortized over  a  19-year  period
 (18  payments  under  the  One-Year  Lag Methodology) using level dollar
 payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of FIRE to determine
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  There are an estimated 1,261 active FIRE Tier 3 members as of June 30,
 2022 who could potentially benefit  from  the  proposed  legislation  by
 purchasing or transferring service earned as an EMT member. These active
 members  had an average age of approximately 32.3 years, average service
 of approximately 5.3 years (before purchasing any  additional  service),
 and an average salary of approximately $98,500.
  On  average,  the  1,261  active  FIRE Tier 3 members would be able to
 purchase 3.0 years of service earned as an EMT member with an  estimated
 purchase cost of $7,400 per former EMT member as of June 30, 2022.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated  based  on  the actuarial assumptions and methods to be
 used for the Preliminary Fiscal  Year  2024  employer  contributions  of
 FIRE.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of  FIRE  used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
 S. 4005--B  105
 
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  employer  costs  for  service  purchased by future FIRE Tier 3
 members for service earned as an EMT member. However,  as  noted  above,
 the average annual employer cost per member included in this Fiscal Note
 is approximately $3,100.
  *  The  initial,  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement the
 proposed legislation.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit costs.

 Actuary for, and independent of, the New York  City  Retirement  Systems
 and  Pension  Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries and a

  PART BBB
 S. 4005--B  114
 
  Section 1. Section 212 of the retirement and social  security  law  is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 2-a to read as follows:
  2-A.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  THIS
 SECTION, THE EARNING LIMITATIONS FOR RETIRED  PERSONS  IN  POSITIONS  OF
 PUBLIC  SERVICE  SHALL  BE  INCREASED TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE
 YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE AND THEREAFTER.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend Section 212 of the Retirement and Social Securi-
 ty Law (RSSL) to set the salary a retired  person  may  earn  in  public
 employment  without  reduction in retirement allowance to $50,000 during
 the calendar year 2023 and thereafter. Currently, the  salary  limit  is
 $35,000.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Retirement
 System (NYSLRS), if enacted during the  2023  legislative  session,  the
 direct  cost  incurred  would  be the retiree's post-retirement earnings
 more than $35,000 each calendar year, not to  exceed  the  full  pension
 benefit  paid  by  the NYSLRS during the calendar year. Annually, NYSLRS
 will determine which  retirees  earned  post-retirement  income  with  a
 public employer.
  In  the  New  York  State  and  Local  Employees'  Retirement  System
 (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25 of the RSSL, these direct costs  would
 be borne entirely by the State of New York and would require an itemized
 appropriation  sufficient  to pay the cost of the provision. The benefit
 improvement will be funded by including a separate  itemized  charge  on
 the  annual  invoice  of the State of New York, beginning March 1, 2025,
 equal to the cost quoted above, plus interest.
  In the New York State and Local  Police  and  Fire  Retirement  System
 (NYSLPFRS),  those  participating employers that elect to hire a retired
 person pursuant to this legislation will incur annual costs equal to the
 additional pension payments quoted above, plus interest.
  In addition to the direct costs quoted above, insofar as this proposal
 disrupts the usual pattern and timing of employee turnover (that is,  if
 members  retire  earlier than assumed and participating employers hire a
 retiree instead of a new billable member),  shifts  in  member  behavior
 could generate losses that increase the average billing rates.
  *  In  the  20-year  and  25-year service-based plans, average billing
 rates could increase from 27.8% to 37.7%.
  * In the age-based plans, average billing rates  could  increase  from
 13.7% to 17.2%.
  The  actual  increase  in  billing  rates  will depend upon member and
 employer utilization, with the rates above representing an upper limit.
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.

 RY, FOR ANY POLICE OFFICER EMPLOYED BY THE DIVISION OF  LAW  ENFORCEMENT
 IN  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK
 TRANSFERRING FROM THE NEW YORK CITY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM TO  THE
 NEW  YORK  STATE  AND  LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM AFTER THE
 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS  SUBDIVISION  AND  ANY  POLICE  OFFICER  FORMERLY
 EMPLOYED  BY  THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVI-
 RONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK HAVING MADE SUCH  TRANSFER,
 SUCH  POLICE  OFFICER'S DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK SERVICE CREDIT SHALL BE
 DEEMED CREDITABLE SERVICE, IN SUCH POLICE OFFICER'S TWENTY YEAR OR TWEN-
 TY-FIVE YEAR RETIREMENT PLAN, IF SUCH POLICE OFFICER HAS SERVED  FOR  AT
 LEAST  TWO  YEARS IN SUCH EMPLOYMENT AND IF, WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DATE
 ON WHICH HE OR SHE FIRST BECAME A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL
 POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR WITHIN ONE YEAR  OF  THE  EFFECTIVE
 DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION, SUCH MEMBER ELECTS TO DO SO.
  2.  THE  AMOUNT OF SUCH SERVICE CREDITED TO THE MEMBER IN THE NEW YORK
 STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN SHALL NOT  EXCEED
 THE  AMOUNT  OF  SERVICE  CREDITED  TO  THE  MEMBER IN THE NEW YORK CITY
 EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN.
  3. IF THE MEMBER SUBSEQUENTLY RETIRES ON AN AGE-BASED RETIREMENT  PLAN
 IN  THE  NEW  YORK  STATE  AND  LOCAL  POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM
 INSTEAD OF A TWENTY YEAR OR TWENTY-FIVE YEAR PLAN, THE  FULL  AMOUNT  OF
 SERVICE  CREDIT  EARNED, AS A POLICE OFFICER EMPLOYED BY THE DIVISION OF
 LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF  ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION  IN  THE
 CITY OF NEW YORK SHALL BE GRANTED.
  4. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT
 OF  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK SERVICE CREDITED TO
 A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STATE AND  LOCAL  POLICE  AND  FIRE  RETIREMENT
 SYSTEM PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION EXCEED A TOTAL OF TEN YEARS.
  5.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW IN THIS SECTION TO THE
 CONTRARY, THE RESERVE ON SUCH MEMBER'S  BENEFITS  SHALL  BE  TRANSFERRED
 FROM  THE  NEW  YORK  CITY  EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM TO THE NEW YORK
 STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH
 SUBDIVISIONS C AND D OF THIS SECTION.
  6.  NO MEMBER WHO RECEIVES SERVICE CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION
 SHALL BE ELIGIBLE TO  RECEIVE  ADDITIONAL  SERVICE  CREDIT  PURSUANT  TO
 SUBDIVISION  B OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FOUR-E OF THIS ARTICLE IF
 HIS OR HER EMPLOYER HAS ELECTED TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICE CREDIT.
 S. 4005--B  116
 
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  expand  the  definition of service creditable under
 20-year and 25-year plans in the New York State  and  Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement System (NYSLPFRS) to include service transferred by any
 police officer employed or formerly employed  by  the  Division  of  Law
 Enforcement in the Department of Environmental Protection in the City of
 New  York,  provided  that such police officer has at least two years of
 such employment. The member must elect  to  obtain  the  service  credit
 within  one  year of the date on which they first became a member of the
 NYSLPFRS or within one year of the effective date of this bill, whichev-
 er occurs later. The amount of service credit received in  the  NYSLPFRS
 shall  not  exceed  the minimum of the amount of service credited to the
 member in the New York City Employees' Retirement System  (NYCERS)  plan
 or 10 years.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it is
 estimated that the past service cost will average approximately  25%  of
 an  affected member's salary for each year of additional service that is
 credited on a 20-year or 25- year plan. This cost will be offset by  any
 reserves  transferred from the NYCERS. The remaining cost will be shared
 by the State  of  New  York  and  the  participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  modify the in-service death benefit for Westchester
 County correction officers in Tiers 2 through 6.  The  in-service  death
 benefit  will  be  the value of the pension reserve as if the member had
 retired on their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $110,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of  Westchester County for the fiscal year ending
 S. 4005--B  120
 
 March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost  will  vary  as  the  billing
 rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past service cost of approximately $812,000 which will be
 borne by Westchester County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes
 that payment will be made on February 1,  2024.  If  Westchester  County
 elects  to  amortize  this  cost over a 10-year period, the cost for the
 first year including interest would be $104,000.
  These estimated costs are based on 821 affected  members  employed  by
 Westchester  County, with annual salary of approximately $103 million as
 of March 31, 2022.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  modify  the in-service death benefit for retirement
 eligible members of the New York State and Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System  who  are  employed  by Nassau County in certain fire marshal job
 titles. The in-service death benefit will be the value  of  the  pension
 reserve as if the member had retired on their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $5,400 in the
 annual contributions of Nassau County for the fiscal year  ending  March
 31,  2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $48,700  which  will  be
 borne by Nassau County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment  will  be  made  on February 1, 2024. If Nassau County elects to
 amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for  the  first  year
 including interest would be $6,220.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based on 44 affected members employed by
 Nassau County, with annual salary of approximately $5.0  million  as  of
 March 31, 2022.

  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the legislature that this act would  have  been  enacted  even  if  such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
