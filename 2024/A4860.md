  § 8860. SHORT  TITLE.  THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS
 THE "INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT".
  § 8861. PURPOSE. IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, AND  IN
 RECOGNITION  OF  THE ADVANCES IN THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE, THE MEMBER
 STATES OF THE INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT HAVE ALLIED IN COMMON
 PURPOSE TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS THAT COMPLEMENTS THE EXISTING
 LICENSING AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF STATE MEDICAL BOARDS,  PROVIDES  A
 STREAMLINED  PROCESS THAT ALLOWS PHYSICIANS TO BECOME LICENSED IN MULTI-
 PLE STATES, THEREBY ENHANCING THE PORTABILITY OF A MEDICAL  LICENSE  AND
 ENSURING  THE  SAFETY OF PATIENTS.  THE COMPACT CREATES ANOTHER PATHWAY
 FOR LICENSURE AND DOES NOT OTHERWISE CHANGE A STATE'S  EXISTING  MEDICAL
 PRACTICE ACT. THE COMPACT ALSO ADOPTS THE PREVAILING STANDARD FOR LICEN-
 SURE  AND AFFIRMS THAT THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE OCCURS WHERE THE PATIENT
 IS LOCATED AT THE TIME OF THE PHYSICIAN-PATIENT  ENCOUNTER,  AND  THERE-
 FORE,  REQUIRES  THE PHYSICIAN TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE
 MEDICAL BOARD WHERE THE PATIENT IS LOCATED. STATE  MEDICAL  BOARDS  THAT
 PARTICIPATE  IN THE COMPACT RETAIN THE JURISDICTION TO IMPOSE AN ADVERSE
 ACTION AGAINST A LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN THAT STATE ISSUED TO  A
 PHYSICIAN THROUGH THE PROCEDURES IN THE COMPACT.

 SUCH AN ACTION BY THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION SHALL BE INVALID AND HAVE NO
 FORCE OR EFFECT.

 WHERE THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION HAS ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICES, PROVIDED THAT
 THE  FILING  OF  SUCH A PETITION SHALL NOT STAY OR OTHERWISE PREVENT THE
 RULE FROM BECOMING EFFECTIVE UNLESS THE COURT FINDS THAT THE  PETITIONER
 HAS  A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS. THE COURT SHALL GIVE DEFERENCE
 TO THE ACTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION CONSISTENT  WITH  APPLICABLE
 LAW  AND SHALL NOT FIND THE RULE TO BE UNLAWFUL IF THE RULE REPRESENTS A
 REASONABLE EXERCISE OF THE AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE  INTERSTATE  COMMIS-
 SION.

 PRINCIPAL OFFICES, TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THE
 COMPACT, AND ITS PROMULGATED RULES AND BYLAWS, AGAINST A MEMBER STATE IN
 DEFAULT.  THE  RELIEF  SOUGHT  MAY  INCLUDE  BOTH  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND
 DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT IS NECESSARY, THE  PREVAILING
 PARTY SHALL BE AWARDED ALL COSTS OF SUCH LITIGATION INCLUDING REASONABLE
 ATTORNEY'S FEES.

 PROFESSION.

 COMMISSION SHALL:
  (A)  PROVIDE  WRITTEN  NOTICE TO THE DEFAULTING STATE AND OTHER MEMBER
 STATES, OF THE NATURE OF THE DEFAULT, THE MEANS OF CURING  THE  DEFAULT,
 AND  ANY  ACTION  TAKEN  BY  THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION.  THE INTERSTATE

 STATE SHALL BE TERMINATED FROM THE COMPACT UPON AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A
 MAJORITY  OF  THE COMMISSIONERS AND ALL RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES, AND BENEFITS
 CONFERRED BY THE COMPACT SHALL TERMINATE ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF TERMI-
 NATION. A CURE OF THE DEFAULT DOES NOT RELIEVE THE  OFFENDING  STATE  OF
 OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES INCURRED DURING THE PERIOD OF THE DEFAULT.
  4.  TERMINATION  OF  MEMBERSHIP  IN  THE COMPACT SHALL BE IMPOSED ONLY
 AFTER ALL OTHER MEANS OF SECURING COMPLIANCE HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED. NOTICE

 A  MEMBER  STATE MAY WITHDRAW FROM THE COMPACT BY SPECIFICALLY REPEALING
 THE STATUTE WHICH ENACTED THE COMPACT INTO LAW.
  2. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COMPACT SHALL BE BY THE ENACTMENT OF A  STATUTE
