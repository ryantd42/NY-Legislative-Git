  WHEREAS,  Through  his  diligence and rigorous efforts, Ian Cressman
has achieved Scouting's highest and most prestigious rank, Eagle  Scout;
the Eagle Court of Honor ceremony will be held on Sunday, June 23, 2024,
at the New Castle Community Center; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ian Cressman is a member of Boy Scouts of America Troop 2,
Chappaqua, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, An active member of scouting since moving to  Chappaqua  in
first  grade,  Ian Cressman has served as Patrol Leader, Troop Historian
and Senior Patrol leader; and
 
  WHEREAS, America has achieved its greatest heights of glory  through
the  dedication,  determination  and tireless efforts of the outstanding
citizens of this Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is only with the continued diligence and devotion of our
youth, tomorrow's leaders, that America will maintain its glory; and
 
  WHEREAS, Boy Scouts of America and its members are dedicated to  the
development of character and leadership in the youth of this Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  highest achievement of leadership in Scouting, earned
by approximately five percent of all Boy Scouts,  is  the  distinguished
rank of Eagle Scout; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  outstanding  young man has been involved in Scouting
for many years, has lived up to Scouting's ideals and has  attained  all
the  necessary achievements, including completion of a community service
project, which was successfully planned, developed, and executed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  his  project,  Ian  Cressman  collected  over  5,000
children's  books  from  families across New Castle through a children's
book drive; after sorting and packaging the books by reading level, Ian,
with the help of his fellow scouts, distributed over 2,000 of the  books
to  patrons  of  local  food  pantries  in  Yorktown,  Mount  Kisco, and
Elmsford; the remaining books went to 914Cares in  White  Plains,  which
will  use  the  books  to  stock a new library specifically aimed toward
families in need, as well as Darien Book Aid, which distributes books to
under-resourced communities across the nation and world; and
 
  WHEREAS, His dedication to the safety and well-being of the citizens
of his community is represented through his project and demonstrates his
devotion to both community and commitment to others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ian Cressman's perseverance in rising through the ranks  to
Eagle  Scout  is  a strong indication of his ability to master difficult
 
tasks; his accomplishment will enable him to emerge as a  leader,  fully
equipped to meet the challenges of today's complex society; and
 
  WHEREAS, This new Eagle Scout is a credit to his family, his school,
his community, his State and his Nation, and no doubt his future will be
filled with accomplishments of equal importance; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations, in
recognition of the significance  of  this  meritorious  achievement,  to
congratulate  and  honor  Ian  Cressman  on  achieving the rank of Eagle
Scout; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Ian Cressman.
