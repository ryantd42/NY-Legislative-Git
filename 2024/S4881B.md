 (iv)  of subdivision 2 as amended by chapter 656 of the laws of 1997 and
 as further amended by section 104 of part A of chapter 62 of the laws of
 2011, clause (vi) of subparagraph 2 as added by chapter 435 of the  laws
 of 2018, are amended to read as follows:
  (1)  In  establishing  standards  for  determining eligibility for and
 amount of such assistance, the department shall take into  account  only
 such income [and resources], in accordance with federal requirements, as
 [are]  IS  available  to  the applicant or recipient and as would not be
 required to be disregarded or set aside  for  future  needs,  and  there
 shall  be a reasonable evaluation of any such income [or resources]. The
 department shall not consider the  availability  of  an  option  for  an
 accelerated  payment of death benefits or special surrender value pursu-
 ant to paragraph one of subsection  (a)  of  section  one  thousand  one
 hundred  thirteen  of  the  insurance  law, or an option to enter into a
 viatical settlement pursuant to the provisions of article  seventy-eight
 S. 4881--A  4
 
 of  the insurance law, as an available resource in determining eligibil-
 ity for an amount  of  such  assistance,  provided,  however,  that  the
 payment  of such benefits shall be considered in determining eligibility
 for and amount of such assistance. There shall not be taken into consid-
 eration the financial responsibility of any individual for any applicant
 or  recipient  of  assistance  under this title unless such applicant or
 recipient is such individual's spouse or such individual's child who  is
 under twenty-one years of age. In determining the eligibility of a child
 who  is categorically eligible as blind or disabled, as determined under
 regulations prescribed by the social security act  for  medical  assist-
 ance,  the  income  [and resources] of parents or spouses of parents are
 not considered available to that child  if  she/he  does  not  regularly
 share  the  common  household  even  if  the child returns to the common
 household for periodic visits. In the application of standards of eligi-
 bility with respect to income, costs incurred for medical care,  whether
 in  the  form  of  insurance  premiums or otherwise, shall be taken into
 account. Any person who is eligible for, or reasonably appears  to  meet
 the  criteria  of  eligibility  for,  benefits  under title XVIII of the
 federal social security act shall be required to  apply  for  and  fully
 utilize such benefits in accordance with this chapter.
  (2) In evaluating the income [and resources] available to an applicant
 for  or  recipient  of  medical  assistance, for purposes of determining
 eligibility for and the amount of such assistance, the  department  must
 consider  assets [held in or] paid from trusts created by such applicant
 or recipient, as determined pursuant to the regulations of  the  depart-
 ment, in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph.
  (i) In the case of a revocable trust created by an applicant or recip-
 ient,  as  determined  pursuant  to  regulations of the department: [the
 trust corpus must be considered to be an available  resource;]  payments
 made from the trust to or for the benefit of such applicant or recipient
 must  be  considered to be available income; and any other payments from
 the trust must be considered to be assets disposed of by such  applicant
 or  recipient  for purposes of paragraph (d) of subdivision five of this
 section.
  (ii) In the case of an irrevocable trust created by  an  applicant  or
 recipient,  as determined pursuant to regulations of the department: any
 portion of the trust corpus, and of the income generated  by  the  trust
 corpus,  from  which  no  payment can under any circumstances be made to
 such applicant or recipient must be considered, as of the date of estab-
 lishment of the trust, or, if later, the date on which  payment  to  the
 applicant  or  recipient is foreclosed, to be assets disposed of by such
 applicant or recipient for purposes of paragraph (d) of subdivision five
 of this section; [any portion of the trust corpus,  and  of  the  income
 generated  by  the  trust corpus, from which payment could be made to or
 for the benefit of such applicant or recipient must be considered to  be
 an available resource;] payments made from the trust to or for the bene-
 fit  of  such  applicant or recipient must be considered to be available
 income; and any other payments from the trust must be considered  to  be
 assets  disposed of by such applicant or recipient for purposes of para-
 graph (d) of subdivision five of this section.
  (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii)  of  this
 subparagraph,  in the case of an applicant or recipient who is disabled,
 as such term is defined in section  1614(a)(3)  of  the  federal  social
 security  act,  the department must not consider as available income [or
 resources] the [corpus or] income of the following trusts  which  comply
 with the provisions of the regulations authorized by clause (iv) of this
 S. 4881--A  5
 
 subparagraph: (A) a trust containing the assets of such a disabled indi-
 vidual  which was established for the benefit of the disabled individual
 while such individual was under sixty-five years of age by the  individ-
 ual, a parent, grandparent, legal guardian, or court of competent juris-
 diction, if upon the death of such individual the state will receive all
 amounts  remaining  in  the  trust  up to the total value of all medical
 assistance paid on behalf of such individual; (B) and a trust containing
 the assets of such a disabled individual established and  managed  by  a
 non-profit association which maintains separate accounts for the benefit
 of  disabled individuals, but, for purposes of investment and management
 of trust funds, pools the accounts, provided that accounts in the  trust
 fund are established solely for the benefit of individuals who are disa-
 bled as such term is defined in section 1614(a)(3) of the federal social
 security  act  by such disabled individual, a parent, grandparent, legal
 guardian, or court of competent jurisdiction, and  to  the  extent  that
 amounts  remaining  in  the individual's account are not retained by the
 trust upon the death of the individual, the state will receive all  such
 remaining  amounts  up to the total value of all medical assistance paid
 on behalf of such individual.  Notwithstanding any law to the  contrary,
 a not-for-profit corporation may, in furtherance of and as an adjunct to
 its corporate purposes, act as trustee of a trust for persons with disa-
 bilities  established  pursuant to this subclause, provided that a trust
 company, as defined in subdivision seven of section one hundred-c of the
 banking law, acts as co-trustee.
  (iv) The department shall promulgate such regulations as may be neces-
 sary to carry out the provisions of this subparagraph. Such  regulations
 shall  include  provisions  for:  assuring  the fulfillment of fiduciary
 obligations of the trustee with respect to the remainder interest of the
 department or state; monitoring pooled trusts; applying this subdivision
 to legal instruments and other devices similar to trusts, in  accordance
 with  applicable  federal rules and regulations; and establishing proce-
 dures under which the application of this  subdivision  will  be  waived
 with  respect  to  an  applicant or recipient who demonstrates that such
 application would work an undue hardship on him or  her,  in  accordance
 with  standards  specified by the secretary of the federal department of
 health and human services. Such regulations may require: notification of
 the department of the creation or funding of such a trust for the  bene-
 fit of an applicant for or recipient of medical assistance; notification
 of the department of the death of a beneficiary of such a trust who is a
 current  or  former  recipient  of  medical assistance; in the case of a
 trust, the corpus of which exceeds one hundred thousand dollars, notifi-
 cation of  the  department  of  transactions  tending  to  substantially
 deplete  the  trust corpus; notification of the department of any trans-
 actions involving transfers from the trust corpus  for  less  than  fair
 market value; the bonding of the trustee when the assets of such a trust
 equal  or exceed one million dollars, unless a court of competent juris-
 diction waives such requirement; and the bonding of the trustee when the
 assets of such a trust are less than one million dollars, upon order  of
 a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction. The department, together with the
 department of financial services, shall promulgate regulations governing
 the establishment,  management  and  monitoring  of  trusts  established
 pursuant  to subclause (B) of clause (iii) of this subparagraph in which
 a not-for-profit corporation and a trust company serve as co-trustees.
  (v) Notwithstanding any acts, omissions or failures to act of a  trus-
 tee  of a trust which the department or a local social services official
 has determined complies with the provisions  of  clause  (iii)  and  the
 S. 4881--A  6
 
 regulations  authorized by clause (iv) of this subparagraph, the depart-
 ment must not consider the [corpus or]  income  of  any  such  trust  as
 available  income  [or  resources]  of the applicant or recipient who is
 disabled,  as  such term is defined in section 1614(a)(3) of the federal
 social security act. The department's remedy for redress  of  any  acts,
 omissions  or failures to act by such a trustee which acts, omissions or
 failures are considered by the department to be  inconsistent  with  the
 terms  of  the trust, contrary to applicable laws and regulations of the
 department, or contrary to the  fiduciary  obligations  of  the  trustee
 shall  be  the commencement of an action or proceeding under subdivision
 one of section sixty-three of the executive law to safeguard or  enforce
 the  state's  remainder  interest  in the trust, or such other action or
 proceeding as may be lawful and appropriate as to assure  compliance  by
 the  trustee  or to safeguard and enforce the state's remainder interest
 in the trust.
  (vi) The department shall provide written notice to an  applicant  for
 or  recipient  of  medical assistance who is or reasonably appears to be
 eligible for medical  assistance  except  for  having  income  exceeding
 applicable  income  levels.  The  notice  shall  inform the applicant or
 recipient, in plain language, that in certain circumstances the  medical
 assistance  program does not count the income of disabled applicants and
 recipients if it is placed in a trust described in clause (iii) of  this
 subparagraph.  The  notice shall be included with the eligibility notice
 provided to such applicants and recipients  and  shall  reference  where
 additional  information  may  be found on the department's website. This
 clause shall not be construed to change any  criterion  for  eligibility
 for medical assistance.
  §  7.  Paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  3 of section 366 of the social
 services law, as amended by chapter 110 of the laws of 1971, is  amended
 to read as follows:
  (a)  Medical  assistance  shall  be  furnished  to applicants in cases
 where, although such applicant has a responsible  relative  with  suffi-
 cient income [and resources] to provide medical assistance as determined
 by  the regulations of the department, the income [and resources] of the
 responsible relative are not available to such applicant because of  the
 absence  of  such relative or the refusal or failure of such relative to
 provide the necessary care and assistance.  In such cases, however,  the

 relative,  and  the  cost thereof may be recovered from such relative in

 applicable provisions of law.

 are REPEALED and subdivisions 7 and 8, as added by chapter  558  of  the
 laws of 1989, are renumbered subdivisions 5 and 6 and amended to read as
 follows:
  5.  (a)  At  the  beginning  or after the commencement of a continuous
 period of institutionalization, either spouse may request [an assessment
 of the total value of their resources or] a determination of the  commu-
 nity  spouse  monthly  income allowance, the amount of the family allow-
 ance, or the method of computing the amount of the family allowance,  or
 the method of computing the amount of the community spouse income allow-
 ance.
  (b)  [(i)  Upon receipt of a request pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
 subdivision together with all relevant documentation of the resources of
 both spouses, the social services district shall assess and document the
 total value of the spouses' resources and provide  each  spouse  with  a
 copy of the assessment and the documentation upon which it was based. If
 the  request  is not part of an application for medical assistance bene-
 fits, the social services district may charge a fee for  the  assessment
 which is related to the cost of preparing and copying the assessment and
 documentation which fee may not exceed twenty-five dollars.
  (ii)] The social services district shall [also] notify each requesting
 spouse  of the community spouse monthly income allowance, of the amount,
 if any, of the family allowances, and of the  method  of  computing  the
 amount of the community spouse monthly income allowance.
  (c)  The  social  services district shall also provide to the spouse a
 notice of the right to a fair hearing at the time of  provision  of  the
 information requested under paragraph (a) of this subdivision or after a
 determination  of  eligibility for medical assistance. Such notice shall
 be in the form prescribed or approved by the commissioner and include  a
 statement  advising the spouse of the right to a fair hearing under this
 section.
  6. (a) If, after a determination on an application for medical assist-
 ance has been made, either spouse is dissatisfied with the determination
 of the community spouse monthly allowance[,] OR the  amount  of  monthly
 income  otherwise available to the community spouse[, the computation of
 the spousal share of resources, the  attribution  of  resources  or  the
 determination of the community spouse's resource allocation], the spouse
 may  request  a fair hearing to dispute such determination. Such hearing
 shall be held within thirty days of the request therefor.
  (b) If either spouse  establishes  that  the  community  spouse  needs
 income  above  the  level established by the social services district as
 the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, based upon  exceptional
 circumstances which result in significant financial distress (as defined
 by  the commissioner in regulations), the department shall substitute an
 S. 4881--A  10

 amount adequate to provide additional necessary income from  the  income
 otherwise available to the institutionalized spouse.
  [(c)  If either spouse establishes that income generated by the commu-
 nity spouse resource  allowance,  established  by  the  social  services
 district,  is  inadequate  to raise the community spouse's income to the
 minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, the department shall estab-
 lish a resource allowance for the spousal share of the institutionalized
 spouse adequate to provide such minimum monthly maintenance needs allow-
 ance.]
