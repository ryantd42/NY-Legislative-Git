  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would permit members of the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees' Retirement System employed by the Unified  Court  System  as  peace
 officers,  including uniformed court officers, to retire upon completion
 of twenty-five years of creditable service with a  benefit  of  one-half
 final  average salary. Additionally, for those members covered under the
 provisions of Article 14 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, this
 bill would permit an irrevocable election to  forfeit  the  benefits  of
 Article 14 in favor of the twenty-five-year plan benefit.  Such election
 must be made within one year of the effective date of this bill or with-
 in one year of entering employment with the Unified Court System.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately $25 million in the
 annual contributions of the State of New York for the fiscal year ending
 March  31,  2025. In future years this cost will vary but is expected to
 average 3.5% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $115 million which  will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
  These estimated costs are based on 6,224 affected members employed  by
 the  Unified  Court  System,  with  annual  salary of approximately $609
 million as of March 31, 2023.
