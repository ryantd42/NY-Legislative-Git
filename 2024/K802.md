BY: M. of A. Giglio JA
 
  COMMENDING  Lieutenant  Justin  Berry  upon  the
  occasion of his designation as  Firefighter  of  the
  Year by the Firefighters Association of the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend Lieutenant
Justin  Berry upon the occasion of his designation as Firefighter of the
Year by the Firefighters Association of the State of New  York  (FASNY);
he  was  honored at a Heroes Award ceremony held on Thursday, August 10,
2023, in Niagara Falls, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, FASNY represents over  80,000  volunteer  firefighters  and
emergency  medical  personnel  in  New  York  State;  the  association
recognizes its bravest members who exemplify  commendable  fire  service
and community protection with this prestigious honor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State
with pride, valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers  are  often
the  first  to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire,
transportation accident, natural disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lieutenant  Justin  Berry,  a  seven-year  member  of  the
Riverhead Fire Department in Long Island, answered, alongside his  team,
a  call  of  a structure fire where a 77-year-old man was trapped in the
home; without hesitation, and in an act of selfless service and bravery,
this courageous Lieutenant entered a  window  on  the  backside  of  the
house, where he was met with very dark and extremely hot conditions, and
began  crawling  alongside the inner wall of the structure to locate the
victim; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to the decisiveness  and  haste  of  Lieutenant  Justin
Berry,  the  victim trapped in the fire was ultimately rescued and taken
under the care of emergency response personnel, where  medics  performed
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), ultimately reviving the man; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others, and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Lieutenant Justin Berry is one such firefighter;  throughout  his  seven
years of devoted service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
 
fire  protection,  justly  receiving  the  esteemed  designation  of
Firefighter of the Year in the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Lieutenant Justin Berry upon the occasion of his designation  as
Firefighter  of the Year by the Firefighters Association of the State of
New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Lieutenant Justin Berry.
