  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation would extend  the  eligibility  for
 the  payment  of  Transit  Police  Officers' and Transit Police Superior
 Officers' Variable Supplements Funds (VSF)  benefits  to  former  NYCERS
 members  who  retired  for service from the New York City Transit Police
 between October 1, 1968 and June 30, 1987  with  20  or  more  years  of
 service.

  The entire increase in employer contributions will be allocated to New
 York  City.  There  are  no  active Transit Police members of NYCERS and
 S. 9274  3
 
 therefore a transfer from NYCERS, via a City payment,  to  the  impacted
 VSFs would be necessary to fund the additional VSF benefit obligations.
 
  EXPECTED INCREASE (DECREASE) IN ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES
  as of June 30, 2023 ($ in Millions)
  Present Value (PV)  NYCERS
  PV of Benefits:  18.9
  PV of Employee Contributions: 0
  PV of Employer Contributions: 18.9
  Unfunded Accrued Liabilities: 18.9
 
  AMORTIZATION OF UNFUNDED ACCRUED LIABILITY
  NYCERS
  Number of Payments:  1
  Fiscal Year of Last Payment:  2025
  Amortization Payment:  20.9 M

  Since  those  that  would  benefit  are retired, and therefore have no
 remaining working lifetime, the  entire  increase  in  Unfunded  Accrued
 Liabilities would be recognized immediately.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Receiving Members
  - Number Count:  304
  - Average Age:  82.0
 
  IMPACT  ON  RETIREE  BENEFITS: Currently, Transit Police Officers' and
 Transit Police Superior Officers' VSFs provide supplemental  non-pension
 benefits  to  former  NYCERS members who retired for service on or after
 July 1, 1987 from New York City Transit Police with 20 or more years  of
 service.
  The  amount  of  VSF  benefits  paid is currently $12,000 per Calendar
 Year.  These VSF benefits are payable on an annual basis around December
 15th to eligible former NYCERS members for  their  lifetimes.  Upon  the
 death of the NYCERS retiree, VSF payments cease.
  Under  the proposed legislation, former NYCERS members who retired for
 service from New York City Transit Police between October  1,  1968  and
 June  30, 1987 with 20 or more years of service would become immediately
 eligible for VSF benefits on the December 15th following  the  Effective
 Date and for each year thereafter. For the purposes of this Fiscal Note,
 it  has  been  assumed  that benefits payable under this proposed legis-
 lation are prospective only.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.

  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
