  WHEREAS,  It is the practice of this Legislative Body to commemorate
historical events which exemplify the spirit  and  struggle  of  peoples
throughout  the  world  to  achieve  independence  and live in peace and
freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its

Republic to be celebrated on February 27, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The people of the Dominican Republic acquired autonomy and
sovereignty on the 27th day of February 1844; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Island of Quisqueya, the indigenous name for what later
became the  island  of  Hispaniola,  was  the  cradle  of  thinking  and
advancement in the western hemisphere, establishing the first university
and cathedral of the New World; and
 
  WHEREAS, Juan Pablo Duarte, along with Francisco Del Rosario Sanchez

initiated  the  movement for the independence of the Dominican Republic;
and
 
  WHEREAS, During the month of February 2024, Dominican Nationals  and
Dominican  Americans  from  throughout  the  Dominican  Republic and the
United States will celebrate the independence of the Dominican Republic;
and
 
  WHEREAS, There are over one million Dominicans  who  call  New  York
State  their home and over two million Dominican Nationals living across
the United States, comprising  one  of  the  fastest  growing  immigrant
groups in our State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, we recognize the numerous contributions of Dominican
and  Dominican  Americans  to our great State adding to the cultural and
economic vibrancy of  New  York;  Dominicans  are  leaders  of  industry
leaving  their  impact  on  music,  literature,  cuisine, fashion, film,
sports, education, government and politics; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 180th Anniversary of the Independence of the  Dominican
Republic  provides an opportunity to recognize the significance of their
contributions to the quality and character of life, and, through  events
and  activities,  for  all  people  to  gain  a  greater appreciation of
Dominican history and  traditions,  and  of  the  role  Dominicans  have
played, and will continue to play, in our society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
 
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 180th Anniversary of the Independence of  the  Dominican
Republic to be celebrated on February 27, 2024; and be it further
