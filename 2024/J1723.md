BY: Senator MAYER
 
  MOURNING the death of Richard Roundtree, actor and

  shows
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
citizens of the State of New York  whose  lifework  and  civic  endeavor
served  to  enhance  the  quality  of life in their communities and this
great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Richard Roundtree, of  New  Rochelle,  New  York,  died  on
Tuesday, October 24, 2023, at the age of 81; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  July  9, 1942, to parents John and Kathryn (Watkins)
Roundtree, Richard Roundtree went to New Rochelle High School, and later
Southern Illinois University; he enjoyed successful football careers  at
both  schools before moving onto modeling with the Ebony Fashion Fair of
Ebony magazine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Richard Roundtree moved back  to  New  York  following  his
modeling  career,  and  began  his  theater  career by joining the Negro
Ensemble Company; and
 
  WHEREAS, His first role was in a 1967 production of Howard Sackler's
"The Great White Hope," starring as  a  fictionalized  version  of  Jack
Johnson,  the  early  20th  century's  first  Black  heavyweight  boxing
champion; and

Jackson  (now  said  to  be the original character's son); like the 2000
"Shaft," it included Richard Roundtree in the cast; and
 
  WHEREAS, The "Shaft" movies were trailblazers of their  time,  being
of  the  first  major  movies  to  shift  from  a  common  stereotypical
narrative, and rather, highlighted the pros of the Black  experience  in
America;  the  character,  John  Shaft,  was noted to be the first Black
character who led his life free from racial torment, truly  opening  the
industry  to  a  wealth of possibilities for narratives that truly honor
Black people in cinema; and

a Time... When We Were Colored" (1996); and

of "Cherish the Day," Ava DuVernay's romantic drama series; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Richard  Roundtree's  commitment  to  excellence,  and his
