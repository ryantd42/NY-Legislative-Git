 unless modified or abrogated by statute prior to April first of the year
 as to which such determination  applies  to  judicial  compensation  and

  § 2. 1. Cost of  living  adjustment.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision  of  law,  regulation, rule, or report, the salaries and addi-
 tions to salary established by law of judges and justices of the unified
 court system shall be increased as of January 1, 2020, and annually each
 year thereafter by a cost of living adjustment  (COLA).  Any  limitation
 established  by law for allowable travel and transportation expenses for

 adjusted  by  the  same proportion on the same date as the annual salary
 adjustment.

 of  this  subdivision shall be equal to the percentage increase, rounded
 to the nearest tenth of one percent, in the average Consumer Price Index
 for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)  determined  by  the
 United  States  Bureau  of Labor Statistics for the third quarter of the
 preceding calendar year compared to the average for the third quarter of
 the calendar year before the preceding  calendar  year.  If  the  CPI-W
 declines  or  the increase is less than 0.05 percent during such period,
 the COLA shall be zero.
  2. Catch-Up Payments. (a) The COLAs under paragraph (b) of subdivision
 one of this section for January 1, 2020, 2021, 2022, and  2023  are  1.6

  (b)  Any amount of salary or addition to salary due under paragraph (a)
 of this subdivision for a year prior to the effective date of  this  act
 shall  be  paid  in two equal installments on April 1, 2023 and April 1,
 2024.
  § 3. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the legislature that this act would  have  been  enacted  even  if  such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that section two
 of this act shall be deemed to have been in full force and effect on and
 after January 1, 2020.
