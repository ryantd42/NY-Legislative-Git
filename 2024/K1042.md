  COMMEMORATING  the  150th  Anniversary  of  the

  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  those  institutions  of true purpose and high achievement whose
exemplary programs and accomplishments clearly demonstrate  an  enduring
pursuit of excellence in the education of the youth of this noble Empire
State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such concern, and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  150th  Anniversary  of  the  Waterville Central School
District on Thursday, May 16, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Waterville Central School District, after 150 years  of
service to its community, continues to create an educational environment
which  ensures  opportunities  for learning, personal growth, and social
responsibility; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the Waterville Historical Society,  the  first
schoolhouse in the district was built between 1787 and 1789; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  1929  edition  of Waterville's yearbook, The Academic
Union, states the "educational institution now known as  the  Waterville
High School" was founded on September 15, 1813; the documentation in the
yearbook  shows trustees voted for a new schoolhouse on January 7, 1814,
and it opened the following  year;  in  1871,  another  new  school  was
constructed, and it was known as Union Free School; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  May  of  1874,  the  New  York  State Board of Regents
officially recognized the Waterville Union  School  and  Academy,  which
would  later  become  the Waterville Central School District; 2024 marks
the 150th anniversary of this recognition; and
 
  WHEREAS, Waterville Central School later operated out of what is now
Schoolhouse Apartments, which was  a  school  building  built  in  1929;
later, in 1933, a school building was built in Deansboro for up to sixth
grade;  the  high  school students attended school in Waterville at this
time; and
 
  WHEREAS, Memorial Park Elementary School  was  built  in  1960;  the
current  Waterville  Jr./Sr. High School was built in 1974, and in 1983,
Oriskany Falls Union Free School was incorporated  into  the  Waterville
Central School District; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  steadfast  and  unyielding  commitment  of  parents,
educators, and administrators to provide the highest  quality  education
for  students  has  become  the hallmark and tradition of the Waterville
Central School District; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the  Waterville  Central  School  District  stands
prepared to reach out, in earnest and enthusiastic quest of its mission,
to  promote  the maximum growth of every student, establishing standards
 
and building skills which will carry its students and  the  citizens  of
its community into the future; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Waterville Central School District is proudly aware of
its distinguished past, eager  to  fulfill  its  present  commitment  to
parents,  students  and  the  community,  and  planning  with vision and
purpose for the positive growth and change  it  will  encounter  in  the
years to come; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 150th  Anniversary  of  the  Waterville  Central  School
District; and be it further
