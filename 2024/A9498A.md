 AN  ACT to amend the education law, in relation to including underrepre-
  sented ethnic groups in the admission criteria  for  the  science  and
  technology  entry  program and collegiate science and technology entry
  program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings. Representation in the workforce is
 critical, especially in New York's healthcare workforce.  A  2017  study
 published  in  the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that Black
 and Hispanic patients were more likely  to  report  feeling  comfortable
 discussing sensitive topics with a provider of the same race or ethnici-
 ty.  A 2019 study published in the Journal of Health Care Administration
 found that  culturally  competent  care  was  associated  with  improved
 patient  satisfaction,  adherence  to  treatment,  and  health outcomes.
 Further a 2020 report by the National Academies of  Sciences,  Engineer-
 ing,  and Medicine found that a diverse healthcare workforce can improve
 access to care for  underserved  populations.  These  benefits  are  not
 limited to healthcare. A 2017 study published in Nature and a 2019 study
 in  the  Harvard  Business  Review  found  that diverse teams outperform
 homogenous teams in terms of creativity and problem-solving. This  means
 that  the  health  and  economic future of our state is dependent on the
 diversity of our workforce.
  The Science and Technology Entry Program (STEP) and Collegiate Science
 and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) have a successful history of bring-
 ing underrepresented students into science, technology, engineering, and
 math (STEM), licensed professions and health professions fields.  These
 programs  create  academic  opportunities  for  students  who have faced
 disadvantages and discrimination. To  ensure  that  these  programs  can
 continue  to  fulfill their mission of delivering opportunity and equity
 to students, the programs' admissions criteria must be updated to be  in
 line with recent legal findings.

  The STEP and CSTEP admissions criteria must allow for admission of any
 student  from  any group underrepresented in a STEM, licensed profession
 field or health profession field. This will require that  the  New  York
 State  Board  of Regents identify underrepresentation in eligible career
 fields prior to the periodic release of RFPs for STEP and CSTEP.  Under-
 representation  shall be determined using available workforce statistics
 and defined in rules. This determination will provide "focused and meas-
 urable objectives" (as required by the U.S. Supreme  Court)  while  also
 having  a definable endpoint: the correction of underrepresentation in a
 specific professional field reviewed on a regular basis (the contractual
 period defined by an individual RFP).
  Every ethnic or racial group is underrepresented in various  workforce
 fields  in  New  York.  STEP  and CSTEP will help rectify that issue and
 ultimately root out the  pernicious  impact  of  underrepresentation  in
 various professions.
