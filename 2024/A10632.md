 segregation except upon request of the head of  a  department  or  other
 state  agency  and approval by the director of the budget. When approved
 by the director of the budget, he shall issue a certificate to the  head
 of the department or other state agency in which the position exists and
 to  the  state  comptroller authorizing the transfer of the position and
 the appropriation made therefor. Copies of  such  certificate  shall  be

 tion law. Whenever an appropriation is made from a fund to a  department
 or  agency  and  is  accompanied  by  a schedule showing the programs or
 purposes for which such appropriation may be expended, the amount appro-
 priated for any item or items within any program  or  purpose  for  such
 department  or  agency may be increased or decreased by interchange with
 amounts appropriated from such fund for any other item or  items  within
 the  same program or purpose, or with other items appropriated from such
 fund not in the same program or purpose but which are contained  in  the

 conditions as heretofore described except that the total  amount  appro-
 priated  for any program or purpose may not be increased or decreased by
 more than the aggregate of five per  cent  of  the  first  five  million
 dollars,  four  percent of the second five million dollars and three per
 cent of amounts in excess of ten million dollars of an appropriation for
 a program or purpose. [The allocation of lump sum appropriations from  a
 fund  made  to a department or agency for later distribution to programs
 or purposes or to the units of the state university to the allocation of
 lump sum appropriations made to all state departments and  agencies  for
 later  allocation  for specific programs or purposes shall not be deemed
 to be part of such total increase or decrease.]
  § 9. Section 42 of the  state  finance  law  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  § 42. Limitation on expenditures.  The several amounts appropriated in

 priations  and shall be paid by the division of the treasury, department
 of taxation and finance, from the respective funds as specified,  pursu-
 ant  to  the  requirements of this chapter, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH
 LIMITATION SHALL NOT APPLY TO REVENUE FROM OTHER SOURCES.  EVERY  APPRO-
 PRIATION  SHALL  STATE  A SOURCE OF REVENUE. It shall be the duty of the
 comptroller to report [annually] QUARTERLY to the legislature the detail
 of the several expenditures AND  IF  THE  AMOUNTS  APPROPRIATED  ARE  IN
 COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SECTION.
  §  10. Paragraph a of subdivision 2 of section 53 of the state finance
 law, as amended by chapter 58 of the laws of 1982, is amended and a  new
 subdivision 10 is added to read as follows:
  a.  Transfers  to the general fund or the capital projects fund estab-
 lished under section ninety-three of this chapter shall be only for  the
 purpose  and  to the extent required to meet emergency and unanticipated
 expenditures of the state which shall mean:
  (1) expenditures deemed necessary or essential to the proper and effi-
 cient functioning of the government of the state  or  the  rendering  of
 governmental  services  by  the  state, in order to meet [emergencies] A
 LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY OR STATE DECLARATION  OF  DISASTER  EMERGENCY
 PURSUANT  TO  ARTICLE  TWO-B  OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW, and unanticipated
 requirements arising from or which threaten to interfere with the lawful
 exercise of one or more of the powers of government by the state[;
  (2) expenditures deemed necessary or essential to  protect  fully  the
 New York state housing finance agency, the state university construction
 fund,  the  state  university, or the facilities development corporation
 from general public liability arising from their ownership  or  interest
 in  state university facilities or mental hygiene facilities financed by
 the New York state housing finance agency, as the case  may  be,  or  to
 repair, restore, rebuild or replace such a facility upon damage, loss or
 destruction thereof, or to pay the annual rentals for such a facility in
 the  event  of the damage, loss or destruction thereof and of the avail-
 ability and possession thereof by the state university construction fund
 and the occupancy thereof by the state university, or  the  availability
 and  possession thereof by the state university, or the availability and
 possession thereof by the facilities  development  corporation  and  the
 occupancy thereof by the department of mental hygiene; and
  (3)  expenditures  deemed  necessary  or  essential for payment of the

 A. 10632  5

 city having a population of seventy-five thousand or more inhabitants or

 providing  for  the  financing and the construction and leasing of state
 office  buildings  and other public improvements in such county or city,
 to hold such county or city and its officers, agents or employees  harm-
 less against liability, loss, cost, damage, claims, judgments or expense
 based on personal injury, death or damage to property, real, personal or
 mixed,  which because of the uncertainty of events are not clearly fore-
 seeable or predictable at the time of passage of the  budget  and  other
 appropriation  measures  during  the  regular session of the legislature
 next preceding the occurrence or  development  thereof,  and  for  which
 other appropriations are not available or are insufficient.
  Transfers  made  pursuant to subparagraphs two and three of this para-
 graph are expressly for the purpose of applying self-insurer  principles
 to the facilities therein described, consistent with the system of self-
 insurance followed by the state for real property under its jurisdiction
 and control].
  10. THE STATE AND ANY DEPARTMENT, BUREAU, BOARD, COMMISSION OR AUTHOR-
 ITY  THEREOF, AND ANY OTHER AGENCY OR INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE STATE SHALL
 NOT USE SPECIAL EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS, NOR ANY STATE OR FEDERAL GRANT

 OTHERWISE STIPULATED.

 propriation. NO APPROPRIATION SHALL BE REAPPROPRIATED FOR MORE THAN  ONE

 original  appropriation  was made, the bill as submitted by the governor
 shall show clearly any such change.
  § 12. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
