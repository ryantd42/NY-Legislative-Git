 TWO  OF  THIS  CHAPTER, his OR HER or its interest in such real property
 shall be assessed and taxed [as] FOR THE SAME AMOUNT  AND  TO  THE  SAME
 EXTENT  AS  THOUGH THE LESSEE, CONTRACTOR OR USER WERE THE OWNER OF SUCH
 real  property  and  shall be entered in the assessment roll in the same
 manner as if such person, partnership, association or  corporation  held
 the  legal  title  to  such  property,  except  for  the addition to the
 description OF THE PROPERTY OF THE NAME OF THE OWNER AND  of  the  words
 "INTEREST  UNDER  LEASE",  "interest  under  contract",  "interest under
 option", or other appropriate words descriptive of the interest  in  the
 property  so  assessed.  [Such assessment shall be at the full value of
 such interest.]
  § 3. Subdivision 2 of section 402 of the  real  property  tax  law  is
 amended to read as follows:
  2.  [The  assessors  shall  add  to  the  assessment roll opposite the
 description of any such interest a notation stating that the real  prop-
 erty itself so owned by the United States, or by the state, is not to be
 taxed.  Every  notice of sale or other process and every conveyance or
 other instrument affecting the title to any  such  property,  consequent
 upon  the  non-payment  of  any such tax, shall contain a statement that
 such legal title is not sold or to be sold or affected] TAXES  SHALL  BE
 ASSESSED  TO THE LESSEES, CONTRACTORS OR USERS OF SUCH REAL PROPERTY AND
 COLLECTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS TAXES ASSESSED TO OWNERS OF REAL PROPER-
 TY, EXCEPT THAT SUCH TAXES SHALL NOT BECOME  A  LIEN  AGAINST  THE  REAL
 PROPERTY  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES OR OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. WHEN DUE,
 SUCH TAXES SHALL CONSTITUTE A  DEBT  DUE  AND  OWING  FROM  THE  LESSEE,
 CONTRACTOR  OR USER TO THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OR SPECIAL DISTRICT FOR
 WHICH THE TAXES WERE LEVIED  AND  SHALL  BE  RECOVERABLE  BY  ACTION  IN
 SUPREME COURT.

 SHALL NOT BE AVAILABLE SUBSEQUENT TO  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF  THE  NEW
 AGREEMENT,  AND  (B)  IF  THE LEASE, CONTRACT, OPTION OR OTHER AGREEMENT

 EVENT  THAT REAL PROPERTY TAXES ARE IMPOSED, THE PARTIAL EXEMPTION SHALL
 NOT BE AVAILABLE TO POSSESSORY INTERESTS CREATED THEREUNDER.  EXCEPT  IN
