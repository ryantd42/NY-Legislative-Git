  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act enacts into law major  components  of  legislation
 necessary  to  implement  the state transportation, economic development
 and environmental conservation budget for  the  2024-2025  state  fiscal
 year.  Each  component is wholly contained within a Part identified as
 Parts A through QQ. The effective date  for  each  particular  provision
 contained  within  such  Part  is  set forth in the last section of such
 Part. Any provision in any section contained within  a  Part,  including
 the effective date of the Part, which makes a reference to a section "of
 this act", when used in connection with that particular component, shall
 be  deemed to mean and refer to the corresponding section of the Part in
 which it is found. Section three of this  act  sets  forth  the  general
 effective date of this act.
 
  PART A
 
  Section  1.  Section  3  of  part PP of chapter 54 of the laws of 2016
 amending the public authorities law and the general municipal law relat-
 ing to the New York transit authority and the  metropolitan  transporta-
 tion  authority,  as amended by section 1 of part C of chapter 58 of the
 laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that the  amend-
 ments  to  subdivision  1  of section 119-r of the general municipal law
 A. 8808--B  4
 
 made by section two of this act shall  expire  and  be  deemed  repealed
 April  1,  [2024]  2025, and provided further that such repeal shall not
 affect the validity or duration of any contract entered into before that
 date pursuant to paragraph f of such subdivision.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  Section  1.  Section  1  of part I of chapter 413 of the laws of 1999,
 relating to providing for mass transportation payments,  as  amended  by
 section  1  of  part  E of chapter 58 of the laws of 2022, is amended to
 read as follows:
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or  regulation  to  the
 contrary,  payment  of mass transportation operating assistance pursuant
 to section 18-b of the  transportation  law  shall  be  subject  to  the
 provisions  contained  herein and the amounts made available therefor by
 appropriation.
  In establishing service and usage formulas for  distribution  of  mass
 transportation  operating assistance, the commissioner of transportation
 may combine and/or  take  into  consideration  those  formulas  used  to
 distribute  mass transportation operating assistance payments authorized
 by separate appropriations in order to facilitate program administration
 and to ensure an orderly distribution of such funds.
  To improve the predictability  in  the  level  of  funding  for  those
 systems  receiving operating assistance payments under service and usage
 formulas, the commissioner of  transportation  is  authorized  with  the
 approval  of  the  director  of  the budget, to provide service payments
 based on service and usage statistics of the preceding year.
  In the case of a service payment made, pursuant to section 18-b of the
 transportation law, to a regional transportation authority on account of
 mass transportation services provided to more than one county (consider-
 ing the city of New York to be one county), the respective shares of the
 matching payments required to be made by a county to any such  authority
 shall be as follows:

  Notwithstanding any other inconsistent provisions of section  18-b  of
 the transportation law or any other law, any moneys provided to a public
 benefit  corporation constituting a transportation authority or to other
 public transportation systems in payment of state  operating  assistance
 or  such  lesser amount as the authority or public transportation system
 shall make application for, shall be paid by the commissioner of  trans-
 portation to such authority or public transportation system in lieu, and
 in full satisfaction, of any amounts which the authority would otherwise
 be entitled to receive under section 18-b of the transportation law.
  Notwithstanding  the  reporting  date provision of section 17-a of the
 transportation law, the reports of each regional transportation authori-
 ty and other major public transportation systems receiving  mass  trans-
 portation  operating  assistance shall be submitted on or before July 15
 of each year in the format prescribed by the commissioner of transporta-
 tion. Copies of such reports shall also be filed with  the  chairpersons
 of  the senate finance committee and the assembly ways and means commit-
 tee and the director of the budget. The commissioner  of  transportation
 A. 8808--B  6
 
 may withhold future state operating assistance payments to public trans-
 portation systems or private operators that do not provide such reports.
  Payments may be made in quarterly installments as provided in subdivi-
 sion 2 of section 18-b of the transportation law or in such other manner
 and  at such other times as the commissioner of transportation, with the
 approval of the director of the budget, may provide; and  where  payment
 is  not  made in the manner provided by such subdivision 2, the matching
 payments required of any city, county, Indian  tribe  or  intercity  bus
 company  shall  be made within 30 days of the payment of state operating
 assistance pursuant to this section or on such other  basis  as  may  be
 agreed  upon  by the commissioner of transportation, the director of the
 budget, and the chief executive officer of  such  city,  county,  Indian
 tribe or intercity bus company.
  The commissioner of transportation shall be required to annually eval-
 uate the operating and financial performance of each major public trans-
 portation  system. Where the commissioner's evaluation process has iden-
 tified a problem related to system  performance,  the  commissioner  may
 request the system to develop plans to address the performance deficien-
 cies. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state oper-
 ating  assistance  payments  to public transportation systems or private
 operators that do not provide such operating, financial, or other infor-
 mation as may be required by the commissioner to conduct the  evaluation
 process.
  Payments  shall  be  made  contingent upon compliance with regulations
 deemed necessary and appropriate, as prescribed by the  commissioner  of
 transportation  and  approved by the director of the budget, which shall
 promote the economy, efficiency, utility, effectiveness, and coordinated
 service delivery of public transportation systems. The  chief  executive
 officer  of  each public transportation system receiving a payment shall
 certify to the commissioner of transportation, in addition  to  informa-
 tion  required  by  section  18-b  of the transportation law, such other
 information as the commissioner of  transportation  shall  determine  is
 necessary to determine compliance and carry out the purposes herein.
  Counties,  municipalities  or  Indian  tribes that propose to allocate
 service payments to operators on a basis other than the amount earned by
 the service payment formula shall be required to describe  the  proposed
 method  of  distributing  governmental  operating  aid and submit it one
 month prior to the start of the operator's fiscal year  to  the  commis-
 sioner of transportation in writing for review and approval prior to the
 distribution of state aid. The commissioner of transportation shall only
 approve  alternate  distribution  methods  which are consistent with the
 transportation needs of the people to be  served  and  ensure  that  the
 system  of private operators does not exceed established maximum service
 payment limits. Copies of such  approvals  shall  be  submitted  to  the
 chairpersons  of  the senate finance and assembly ways and means commit-
 tees.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 18-b of the
 transportation law, the commissioner of transportation is authorized  to
 continue  to  use  prior quarter statistics to determine current quarter
 payment amounts, as initiated in the April to June quarter of  1981.  In
 the  event  that  actual  revenue  passengers and actual total number of
 vehicle, nautical or car miles are not available for the preceding quar-
 ter, estimated statistics may be used  as  the  basis  of  payment  upon
 approval  by  the  commissioner  of  transportation.  In such event, the
 succeeding payment shall be adjusted to reflect the  difference  between
 the actual and estimated total number of revenue passengers and vehicle,
 A. 8808--B  7
 
 nautical  or  car  miles used as the basis of the estimated payment. The
 chief executive officer may apply for less aid than the system is eligi-
 ble to receive. Each quarterly payment shall be attributable to  operat-
 ing expenses incurred during the quarter in which it is received, unless
 otherwise  specified  by such commissioner.  In the event that a public
 transportation system ceases to participate in  the  program,  operating
 assistance  due  for the final quarter that service is provided shall be
 based upon the actual total number of revenue passengers and the  actual
 total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles carried during that quar-
 ter.
  Payments  shall  be  contingent  on compliance with audit requirements
 determined by the commissioner of transportation.
  In the event that an  audit  of  a  public  transportation  system  or
 private  operator receiving funds discloses the existence of an overpay-
 ment of state operating assistance, regardless of whether such an  over-
 payment  results  from  an  audit  of  revenue passengers and the actual
 number of revenue vehicle miles statistics, or an audit of private oper-
 ators in cases where more than a reasonable return based  on  equity  or
 operating revenues and expenses has resulted, the commissioner of trans-
 portation,  in  addition  to  recovering  the  amount of state operating
 assistance overpaid, shall also recover  interest,  as  defined  by  the
 department of taxation and finance, on the amount of the overpayment.
  Notwithstanding  any  other  law,  rule or regulation to the contrary,
 whenever the commissioner of transportation is  notified  by  the  comp-
 troller  that  the  amount  of  revenues  available  for payment from an
 account is less than the total amount of money for which the public mass
 transportation systems  are  eligible  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 section 88-a of the state finance law and any appropriations enacted for
 these  purposes,  the  commissioner  of transportation shall establish a
 maximum payment limit which is proportionally lower than the amounts set
 forth in appropriations.
  Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) of subdivisions 5 and 7 of section 88-a
 of the state finance law and any other general or special law,  payments
 may  be  made  in  quarterly installments or in such other manner and at
 such other  times  as  the  commissioner  of  transportation,  with  the
 approval of the director of the budget may prescribe.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2024.

  § 534. SHORT  TITLE.  THIS  ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS
 THE "WATERFRONT COMMISSION ACT".
  § 534-A. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS. 1. THE  STATE  OF  NEW
 YORK HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES THAT:
  (A)  IN 1953, THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WATERFRONT LABOR WAS EMPLOYED
 WITHIN THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT WERE DEPRESSING  AND  DEGRADING  TO
 SUCH  LABOR, RESULTING FROM THE LACK OF ANY SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF HIRING,
 THE LACK OF ADEQUATE INFORMATION AS TO THE AVAILABILITY  OF  EMPLOYMENT,
 CORRUPT  HIRING  PRACTICES  AND  THE  FACT  THAT PERSONS CONDUCTING SUCH
 HIRING WERE FREQUENTLY CRIMINALS  AND  PERSONS  NOTORIOUSLY  LACKING  IN
 MORAL  CHARACTER  AND INTEGRITY AND NEITHER RESPONSIVE OR RESPONSIBLE TO
 THE EMPLOYERS NOR TO THE UNCOERCED WILL OF THE MAJORITY OF  THE  MEMBERS
 OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEES; THAT AS A RESULT WATERFRONT
 LABORERS  SUFFERED FROM IRREGULARITY OF EMPLOYMENT, FEAR AND INSECURITY,
 INADEQUATE EARNINGS, AN UNDULY HIGH ACCIDENT RATE, SUBJECTION TO BORROW-
 ING AT USURIOUS RATES OF INTEREST, EXPLOITATION  AND  EXTORTION  AS  THE
 PRICE OF SECURING EMPLOYMENT AND A LOSS OF RESPECT FOR THE LAW; THAT NOT
 ONLY  DID  THERE  RESULT  A  DESTRUCTION  OF THE DIGNITY OF AN IMPORTANT
 SEGMENT OF AMERICAN LABOR, BUT A DIRECT  ENCOURAGEMENT  OF  CRIME  WHICH
 IMPOSED A LEVY OF GREATLY INCREASED COSTS ON FOOD, FUEL AND OTHER NECES-
 SARIES HANDLED IN AND THROUGH THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT.
 A. 8808--B  10
 
  (B)  MANY  OF  THESE  EVILS  RESULTED  NOT  ONLY FROM THE CAUSES ABOVE
 DESCRIBED BUT FROM THE PRACTICES OF PUBLIC LOADERS AT  PIERS  AND  OTHER
 WATERFRONT  TERMINALS.  SUCH  PUBLIC  LOADERS  SERVED  NO VALID ECONOMIC
 PURPOSE AND OPERATED AS PARASITES EXACTING A HIGH AND  UNWARRANTED  TOLL
 ON  THE  FLOW  OF COMMERCE IN AND THROUGH THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT,
 AND USED FORCE AND ENGAGED  IN  DISCRIMINATORY  AND  COERCIVE  PRACTICES
 INCLUDING  EXTORTION  AGAINST  PERSONS  NOT DESIRING TO EMPLOY THEM. THE
 STATES OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY FOUND THAT THE FUNCTION OF LOADING AND
 UNLOADING TRUCKS AND OTHER LAND VEHICLES AT PIERS AND  OTHER  WATERFRONT
 TERMINALS  SHOULD  BE  PERFORMED, AS IN EVERY OTHER MAJOR AMERICAN PORT,
 WITHOUT THE EVILS AND ABUSES OF THE PUBLIC LOADER  SYSTEM,  AND  BY  THE
 CARRIERS OF FREIGHT BY WATER, STEVEDORES AND OPERATORS OF SUCH PIERS AND
 OTHER WATERFRONT TERMINALS OR THE OPERATORS OF SUCH TRUCKS OR OTHER LAND
 VEHICLES.
  (C)  MANY  OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED EVILS ALSO RESULTED FROM THE LACK OF
 REGULATION OF THE OCCUPATION OF STEVEDORES, WHO ENGAGED IN CORRUPT PRAC-
 TICES TO INDUCE THEIR HIRE BY CARRIERS OF FREIGHT BY WATER AND TO INDUCE
 OFFICERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF  LABOR  ORGANIZATIONS  TO  BETRAY  THEIR
 TRUST TO THE MEMBERS OF SUCH LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.
  (D)  THE  METHOD OF EMPLOYMENT OF LONGSHORE WORKERS AND PORT WATCHERS,
 COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE "SHAPE-UP",  RESULTED  IN  VICIOUS  AND  NOTORIOUS
 ABUSES,  OF  WHICH  SUCH EMPLOYEES WERE THE PRINCIPAL VICTIMS. THERE WAS
 COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THE SHAPE-UP PERMITTED AND ENCOURAGED EXTORTION
 FROM EMPLOYEES AS THE PRICE OF  SECURING  OR  RETAINING  EMPLOYMENT  AND
 SUBJECTED  SUCH  EMPLOYEES  TO THREATS OF VIOLENCE, UNWILLING JOINDER IN
 UNAUTHORIZED LABOR DISTURBANCES AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES  ON  THE  WATER-
 FRONT.  THE SHAPE-UP RESULTED IN A LOSS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBER-
 TIES OF LABOR, IMPAIRED THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF THE PORT OF  NEW  YORK
 DISTRICT  AND  WEAKENED  LAW ENFORCEMENT THEREIN. THE STATES OF NEW YORK
 AND NEW JERSEY FOUND THAT THESE PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS MUST BE  ELIMI-
 NATED  TO PREVENT GRAVE INJURY TO THE WELFARE OF WATERFRONT LABORERS AND
 OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE AND THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE SHAPE-UP AND  THE
 ESTABLISHMENT  OF A SYSTEM OF EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION CENTERS WERE NECES-
 SARY TO A SOLUTION FOR THESE PUBLIC PROBLEMS.
  (E) THE TWO STATES FOUND THAT THE OCCUPATIONS  OF  LONGSHORE  WORKERS,
 STEVEDORES,  PIER  SUPERINTENDENTS, HIRING AGENTS AND PORT WATCHERS WERE
 AFFECTED WITH A PUBLIC INTEREST REQUIRING THEIR REGULATION AND THAT SUCH
 REGULATION WAS DEEMED AN EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER OF THE TWO  STATES
 FOR  THE  PROTECTION  OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY, WELFARE, PROSPERITY, HEALTH,
 PEACE AND LIVING CONDITIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE TWO STATES. THE  WATER-
 FRONT  COMMISSION  OF NEW YORK HARBOR ("BI-STATE COMMISSION") WAS FORMED
 THROUGH A CONGRESSIONALLY APPROVED COMPACT TO INVESTIGATE, DETER, COMBAT
 AND REMEDY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND INFLUENCE IN THE  PORT  AND  TO  ENSURE
 FAIR  HIRING  AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES SO THAT THE PORT AND REGION COULD
 GROW AND PROSPER.
  (F) THE BI-STATE COMMISSION WORKED TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF CORRUPTION AT
 THE PORT, AND EFFECTUATED TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGES ON THE WATERFRONT.  ITS
 EFFORTS  LED TO THE CONVICTION OF ORGANIZED-CRIME MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES
 FOR MURDER, EXTORTION, DRUG TRAFFICKING,  THEFT,  RACKETEERING,  ILLEGAL
 GAMBLING,  AND  LOANSHARKING,  AMONG  OTHER CRIMES. IN RECENT YEARS, ITS
 INVESTIGATIONS LED TO PROSECUTIONS OF UNION OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE
 TRADITIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME FAMILIES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CONTROL OR
 EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE UNION OF DOCKWORKERS AND COMMERCIAL
 ACTIVITY ON THE WATERFRONT.  THE  BI-STATE  COMMISSION'S  INVESTIGATIONS
 ALSO LED TO THE EXCLUSION OR REMOVAL FROM THE PORT WORKFORCE OF INDIVID-
 UALS WHO WERE CONVICTED OF SERIOUS CRIMES OR WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ORGAN-
 A. 8808--B  11
 
 IZED CRIME. IT WORKED TO OVERCOME DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER UNFAIR HIRING
 PRACTICES  AND CONTINUED TO EXTIRPATE CORRUPTION AND RACKETEERING IN THE
 PORT OF NEW  YORK  DISTRICT  UNTIL  NEW  JERSEY'S  WITHDRAWAL  FROM  THE
 BI-STATE  COMPACT  PURSUANT  TO  CHAPTER  324 OF THE LAWS OF 2017 OF THE
 STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
  (G) ALTHOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S EFFORTS AGAINST  TRADITIONAL  ORGANIZED
 CRIME  INFLUENCE  HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL, SUCH INFLUENCE REMAINS A SIGNIF-
 ICANT THREAT IN THE NEW YORK  METROPOLITAN  AREA,  PARTICULARLY  IN  THE
 PORT. CONTINUED OVERSIGHT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE FAIR AND NONDISCRIMINA-
 TORY  HIRING PRACTICES, TO ELIMINATE LABOR RACKETEERING AND THE VICTIMI-
 ZATION OF LEGITIMATE UNION MEMBERS AND PORT BUSINESSES, AND  TO  PREVENT
 ORGANIZED  CRIME  FIGURES FROM DIRECTLY OPERATING AT THE CRITICAL POINTS
 OF INTERSTATE AND INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would create the New York Waterfront Commission and revise
 the Retirement and Social Security Law to make permanent the changes  of
 Chapter  187  Laws  of  2023, which added the titles of investigator and
 sworn officer employed by the Waterfront Commission Act,  to  the  defi-
 nition  of  membership  in  Section  381-b including making such service
 creditable under RSSL §381-b, and further expand creditable  service  to
 include service as an investigator-trainee.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we do not
 anticipate  any  additional cost to the State of New York or the partic-
 ipating employers in the New  York  State  and  Local  Police  and  Fire
 Retirement System.
  To  the  extent  that new members gain coverage under Section 381-b of
 the RSSL, we anticipate a contribution of 26.4% of salary paid to  newly
 eligible  members  for  the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. In future
 years, this cost will vary but is expected to average  20.6%  of  salary
 annually.
 A. 8808--B  45
 
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.

  PART O
 
  Section 1. Short title, legislative findings and declaration. This act
 shall be known and may be cited as the "renewable action through project
 interconnection  and  deployment  (RAPID) act".  The legislature hereby
 finds and declares that:
  1. To timely achieve the renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction
 targets established pursuant to the  climate  leadership  and  community
 protection  act ("CLCPA"), while contemporaneously maintaining the reli-
 ability of the state's electric transmission system, action is needed to
 consolidate and expedite the  environmental  review  and  permitting  of
 major  renewable  energy  facilities  and  major electric utility trans-
 mission facilities.
 A. 8808--B  51
 
  2. Since enactment of the CLCPA,  it  has  become  apparent  that  the
 State's  bulk and local transmission facilities need to be significantly
 upgraded to  deliver  renewable  energy  to  load.  These  significant
 upgrades in the bulk and local transmission system must be undertaken in
 an  expedited  timeframe  consistent  with  the timeframe to achieve the
 CLCPA targets.
  3. In the context of achieving the  CLCPA  targets,  a  public  policy
 purpose  would be served and the interests of the people of the state of
 New York would be advanced by transferring the Office of Renewable Ener-
 gy Siting ("ORES"), currently under the auspices of  the  Department  of
 State,  to  the  Department of Public Service ("DPS") and providing such
 office with additional responsibilities for the review and permitting of
 major electric transmission facilities as set forth in this act.
  4. The legislature finds that such a transfer would combine the  long-
 standing  expertise  of DPS related to transmission siting, planning and
 compliance with environmental  and  reliability  standards  with  ORES's
 expertise related to the siting of renewable energy resources and, in so
 doing, create synergies, and otherwise provide for more efficient siting
 of major renewable energy and transmission facilities.
  § 2. Section 94-c of the executive law is REPEALED.
  §  3.  Transfer  of Office of Renewable Energy Siting. ORES, an office
 established in the Department of  State  by  the  Accelerated  Renewable
 Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act, enacted under part JJJ of chap-
 ter  58  of  the  laws of 2020, is hereby transferred to and established
 within the DPS, and shall  continue  to  have  all  existing  functions,
 powers,  duties and obligations of ORES together with the new additional
 functions, powers, duties and obligations set forth in this act.
  § 4.  Continuity of existing  functions,  powers,  duties  and  obli-
 gations.  All of the existing functions, powers, obligations, and duties
 granted  to  ORES by section 94-c of the executive law now repealed, are
 hereby transferred, and shall be deemed to and held  to  constitute  the
 continuation  of such functions, powers, duties and obligations of ORES,
 and not a different agency, authority, department or office.  All appli-
 cations pending before ORES on the effective date of this act  shall  be
 considered  and treated as applications filed pursuant to this act as of
 the date of filing of such applications.
  § 5. Transfer of employees.  1. Upon the transfer of  such  functions,
 powers,  duties and obligations pursuant to this act, provision shall be
 made for the transfer of all  employees  of  ORES  situated  within  the
 department  of state into DPS pursuant to subdivision 2 of section 70 of
 the civil service law.  Employees so transferred  shall  be  transferred
 without  further  examination  or  qualification  to the same or similar
 titles, shall remain in the same collective bargaining units  and  shall
 retain their respective civil service classifications, status and rights
 pursuant  to their collective bargaining units and collective bargaining
 agreements.
  2.  All  employees hired after the effective  date  of  this  section
 shall, consistent with the provisions of article 14 of the civil service
 law,  be  classified  in the same bargaining units. Employees other than
 management or confidential persons as defined in article 14 of the civil
 service law serving positions in newly created titles shall be  assigned
 to  the  appropriate  bargaining unit. Nothing contained herein shall be
 construed to affect:
  (a) the rights of employees pursuant to a collective bargaining agree-
 ment; or
 A. 8808--B  52
 
  (b) the representational relationships among employee organizations or
 the bargaining relationships between the state and an employee organiza-
 tion.
  §  6.  Transfer of records. All records, including but not limited to,
 books, papers, and property of ORES shall be transferred  and  delivered
 to DPS.
  § 7. Transfer and continuation of regulations; conforming changes. All
 rules  and  regulations of ORES adopted at 19 NYCRR part 900 in force at
 the time of the transfer of ORES to DPS shall continue in full force and
 effect as rules and regulations of the department until duly modified or
 abrogated by such department; 19 NYCRR part 900 shall be and  hereby  is
 transferred  to 16 NYCRR part XXX, with such conforming changes as shall
 be required to reflect the transfer and relocation of  ORES  to  DPS  as
 provided  in  this  act,  and  shall  continue in full force and effect.
 Provided, however, that such conforming  changes  are  limited  to  such
 substitutions  of numbering, names, titles, citations and other non-sub-
 stantive amendments that are necessary only to effectuate  the  transfer
 and  relocation of ORES to DPS, the changes may be filed with the secre-
 tary of state without the need  for  additional  proceedings  under  the
 state  administrative  procedure  act  or section 101-a of the executive
 law, and shall continue in full force and effect.
  § 8. Promulgation of rules and regulations. The ORES  in  consultation
 with  DPS  shall be authorized to promulgate regulations on an emergency
 basis to ensure the implementation of this act.
  § 9. Intentionally omitted.

  1. Commencing January first, two thousand [fifteen]  TWENTY-SEVEN  and
 every year thereafter, all sources of regulated air contaminants identi-
 fied  pursuant  to  subdivision  one  of section 19-0311 of this chapter
 shall submit to the department an annual base fee of [two]  THREE  thou-
 sand  [five  hundred]  dollars PER FACILITY.  This base fee shall be in
 addition to the fees listed below.  Commencing January first,  [nineteen
 hundred  ninety-four]  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-SEVEN  and  every  year
 thereafter, all sources of regulated air contaminants identified  pursu-
 ant  to  subdivision one of section 19-0311 of this chapter shall submit
 to the department an annual fee not to exceed the per ton fees described
 below. The per ton fee is assessed  on  each  ton  of  emissions  up  to
 [seven]  TEN thousand tons annually of each regulated air contaminant as
 follows:  [sixty] EIGHTY dollars per ton for facilities with total emis-
 sions less  than  one  thousand  tons  annually;  [seventy]  NINETY-FIVE
 dollars  per  ton for facilities with total emissions of one thousand or
 more but less than two thousand tons annually; [eighty] ONE HUNDRED  TEN
 dollars  per  ton for facilities with total emissions of two thousand or
 more but less than five thousand tons annually; and [ninety] ONE HUNDRED
 TWENTY dollars per ton for facilities with total emissions of five thou-
 sand or more tons annually.  Such [fee] FEES  shall  be  sufficient  to
 support  an appropriation approved by the legislature for the direct and
 A. 8808--B  80
 
 indirect costs associated with the operating permit program  established
 in section 19-0311 of this chapter. Such [fee] FEES shall be established
 by  the department and shall be calculated by dividing the amount of the
 current  year appropriation from the operating permit program account of
 the clean air fund by the total  tons  of  emissions  of  regulated  air
 contaminants  that are subject to the operating permit program fees from
 sources subject to the operating  permit  program  pursuant  to  section
 19-0311 of this chapter up to [seven] TEN thousand tons annually of each
 regulated  air  contaminant  from  each source; provided that, in making
 such calculation, the  department  shall  adjust  their  calculation  to
 account  for  any  deficit  or  surplus  in the operating permit program
 account of the clean air fund established pursuant  to  section  ninety-
 seven-oo  of  the  state  finance  law;  AND any loan repayment from the
 mobile source account of the clean  air  fund  established  pursuant  to
 section  ninety-seven-oo  of  the  state  finance  law[; and the rate of
 collection by the department of the bills issued for  the  fee  for  the
 prior year].
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of the state administrative procedure
 act, such calculation and [fee] FEES shall be established as a  rule  by
 publication  in  the  Environmental Notice Bulletin no later than thirty
 days after the budget bills making appropriations  for  the  support  of
 government  are  enacted  or July first, whichever is later, of the year
 such [fee] FEES will be effective. In no  event  shall  the  [fee]  FEES
 established herein be any greater than the maximum fee identified pursu-
 ant  to  this  section. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ANY EXISTING REGULATIONS
 THAT CONTAIN OUTDATED FEE AMOUNTS SHALL BE REVISED TO REFLECT THE  MAXI-
 MUM FEES ESTABLISHED IN THIS TITLE.
  5.  Any regulated air contaminant subject to the fees imposed pursuant
 to this section which qualifies as both a volatile organic compound  and
 a  hazardous air pollutant regulated pursuant to section 7412 of the Act
 shall not be counted under both categories AND SHALL ONLY BE COUNTED  AS
 A HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANT for the purpose of assessing fees.

  Section  1.  Legislative intent. (a) The legislature finds that access
 to affordable and reliable  energy  is  essential  for  maintaining  the
 health, safety, and welfare of New Yorkers.
  (b) The legislature further finds that low and fixed-income households
 are  disproportionately  burdened  by  high  energy costs, and that such
 costs can have significant adverse impacts.
  (c) The legislature recognizes the need to provide  additional  finan-
 cial support to ensure such households have access to affordable energy.
  (d)  The legislature recognizes the energy burden standard established
 through an Order Adopting Low Income Program Modifications and Directing
 Utility Filings issued and effective May 20, 2016, in Case No 14-M-0565,
 that requires low-income residential customers not spend more  than  six
 percent of their income on energy bills.
  (e)  The  legislature further finds that the passage of chapter 764 of
 the laws of 2023, which requires data  matching  between  utilities  and
 affordability  program  participants,  will facilitate the enrollment of
 eligible  households,  likely  increasing  the  number  of  utilities
 constrained  by the Order's limitation that each utility only spend two-
 percent of their annual revenue on the program and  thereby  potentially
 decreasing the available benefits for all participants unless additional
 funding is provided.
  § 2. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 66-x to
 read as follows:
  §  66-X.  ENERGY  AFFORDABILITY  PROGRAM.  1. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS

  (C) "COMBINATION GAS AND ELECTRIC CORPORATION"  SHALL  HAVE  THE  SAME
 MEANING  AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION FOURTEEN OF SECTION TWO OF THIS CHAP-
 TER.
