memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October  20-26,  2024,  as
Respiratory  Care Week in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Respiratory Care Week; and

primarily  in  the  United  States  and  Canada,  care for patients with
breathing difficulties due to chronic conditions like asthma; and
 
  WHEREAS, Celebrated annually, Respiratory Care Week  highlights  the
information  we  need  to keep us breathing well so we can enjoy a great
quality of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Therapists and departments organize events and  festivities
within  their  workplaces  and  communities  to:  celebrate  by  hosting
activities  to  honor  and  reward  respiratory  therapists  for  their
contributions;  motivate  by  encouraging patients and their families in
their battles against lung disease; educate by taking awareness of  lung
diseases  like COPD and asthma to the community; inspire by building the
desire in others to enter the respiratory care profession; and learn  by
maximizing personal and professional skills with new resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State and national levels; now, therefore, be it
