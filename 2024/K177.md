  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Irish American Heritage Month in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  From  America's  earliest days, Irish immigrants and their
descendants  have  contributed  leadership,  wisdom,  and  vitality  to
America,  through nine signers of the Declaration of Independence and 22
Presidents with  Irish  roots  as  well  as  the  indelible  mark  Irish
Americans  have  made  in the shaping of the great State and City of New
York,  through  numerous  Governors,  Legislators,  Mayors  and  public
officials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  their long history, the Irish have been ardent
in their passion for liberty, hatred  of  oppression  and  renowned  for
their  loyalty  and  thus,  the  Irish  have,  from  the beginning, been
prominent in the defense of this Nation, with 20 of George  Washington's
generals  and  an  estimated quarter of his Army being composed of Irish
Americans, among them Timothy Murphy, a hero of the  pivotal  battle  of
Saratoga, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Irish  Americans  have distinguished themselves ever since
whenever their country has called on them, as typified  in  the  storied
"Fighting 69th" of New York who fought with courage and sacrifice on the
Battlefields  of  the  American  Civil War, World War I and whose Gaelic
battle cry of "Faugh an Beallach" is still heard this day  in  Iraq  and
Afghanistan in defense of our country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first  Congressional  Medal  of Honor for the current
conflict in Afghanistan was awarded to Navy Seal Lieutenant  Michael  P.
Murphy  of  Smithtown,  New York, who made the supreme sacrifice for his
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Millions of Irish arrived in New York City in the  mid-19th
Century,  escaping hunger and injustice in their homeland, and where New
York has long been a haven for immigrants, being the home of the "golden
door" of Ellis Island, where the first immigrant to  enter  through  its
passages  to  a new life in America was 15 year-old Annie Moore of Cork,
Ireland; and
 
  WHEREAS, Irish immigrants and their descendants have contributed  to
the  building  of this great society not only by the laying of railroads
and the building of physical bridges, but also by  building  bridges  of
the  mind  amongst  all people through the founding of numerous schools,
colleges and universities, enhancing the quality of every phase of  life
for all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Irish  American  women  have a long and proud tradition of
being visionaries and trailblazers, whether it be  Annie  Sullivan,  the
teacher  of  Helen  Keller, crusading journalist Nelly Bly or New York's
own Colonel Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a Space  Shuttle;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  1762,  Irish  New  Yorkers  have  been  faithfully
celebrating the feast of St. Patrick  every  March  17th,  wherein  they
renew  their  connections  to  the land of their ancestry, pass on their
traditions to the next generation, and share their pride through  joyous
festivities enjoyed by all New Yorkers irrespective of ethnicity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Irish  Americans  have  made  an indelible impression upon
every human endeavor in art, music, literature,  science,  film,  dance,
theatre,  sports,  education,  law,  finance,  and  politics  and  shall
continue to embellish New York's shining future,  reflecting  the  noble
past  of  this mighty race, with all the strength, resilience, humor and
hospitality of the Irish character; it is most fitting to set aside this
month to highlight and honor the  history  and  heritage  of  the  Irish
Americans and to remember and pay tribute to the contributions they have
made to our State and our Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2023,  as  Irish
American Heritage Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
