 traffic  infraction  punishable  by a fine of not more than five hundred
 dollars or by imprisonment for not more than fifteen  days  or  by  both
 such fine and imprisonment.
  2.  If  such  driver  of  a motor vehicle causes physical injury while
 failing to exercise due care in violation of  subdivision  (a)  of  this

 vehicle in a manner that caused such physical injury.
