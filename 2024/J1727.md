  WHEREAS, Stefan and Jenny Hespeler are advocates for service members

population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  2020, this benevolent and humanitarian organization
has promoted programs which  concentrate  on  awareness  of  the  tragic
problem  that  impacts  so  many  of  our  active  service personnel and
veterans and the removal of the stigma associated with mental health  to
promote  healing and survival for those who sacrificed significantly for
their Nation and fellow citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having  exhibited  their  patriotism,  Stefan  and  Jenny
Hespeler  continue  to  demonstrate their love for their country and its
veterans and merit forevermore the highest respect of  their  State  and
Nation; and

their State, and their Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to

as recipients of the Awareness and Remembrance Award by the Tribute  and
Honor Foundation on February 3, 2024; and be it further
