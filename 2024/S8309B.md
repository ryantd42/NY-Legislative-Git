 thorized amount.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  PART P
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision  1  of  section  1003  of  the
 racing,  pari-mutuel  wagering and breeding law, as amended by section 1
 of part BB of chapter 59 of the laws of 2023,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (a)  Any  racing  association  or  corporation  or  regional off-track
 betting corporation, authorized to conduct  pari-mutuel  wagering  under
 this  chapter, desiring to display the simulcast of horse races on which
 pari-mutuel betting shall be permitted in the manner and subject to  the
 conditions  provided for in this article may apply to the commission for
 a license so to do. Applications for licenses shall be in such  form  as
 may  be  prescribed by the commission and shall contain such information
 or other material or evidence as the commission may require. No  license
 shall be issued by the commission authorizing the simulcast transmission
 of  thoroughbred  races  from a track located in Suffolk county. The fee
 for such licenses shall be five hundred dollars per  simulcast  facility
 and  for  account wagering licensees that do not operate either a simul-
 cast facility that is open to the public within the state of New York or
 a licensed racetrack within the state, twenty thousand dollars per  year
 payable  by  the licensee to the commission for deposit into the general
 fund. Except as provided in  this  section,  the  commission  shall  not
 approve any application to conduct simulcasting into individual or group
 residences,  homes  or  other areas for the purposes of or in connection
 with pari-mutuel wagering. The commission may approve simulcasting  into
 residences,  homes or other areas to be conducted jointly by one or more
 regional off-track betting corporations and one or more of  the  follow-
 ing:  a  franchised  corporation,  thoroughbred  racing corporation or a
 harness racing corporation or association; provided (i) the simulcasting
 consists only of those races on which pari-mutuel betting is  authorized
 by  this  chapter  at  one  or more simulcast facilities for each of the
 contracting off-track betting corporations which  shall  include  wagers
 made  in  accordance  with  section  one  thousand fifteen, one thousand
 sixteen and one thousand seventeen of  this  article;  provided  further
 that  the  contract  provisions or other simulcast arrangements for such
 simulcast facility shall be no less favorable than those  in  effect  on
 January  first,  two  thousand  five;  (ii)  that each off-track betting
 corporation having within its  geographic  boundaries  such  residences,
 homes  or  other  areas  technically  capable of receiving the simulcast
 signal shall be a contracting party; (iii) the distribution of  revenues
 shall  be  subject  to  contractual agreement of the parties except that
 statutory payments to  non-contracting  parties,  if  any,  may  not  be
 reduced;  provided,  however,  that nothing herein to the contrary shall
 prevent a track from televising its races on an irregular basis primari-
 ly for promotional or marketing purposes as found by the commission. For
 purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of section one thousand thir-
 teen of this article shall  not  apply.  Any  agreement  authorizing  an
 S. 8309--B  15  A. 8809--B
 
 in-home simulcasting experiment commencing prior to May fifteenth, nine-
 teen hundred ninety-five, may, and all its terms, be extended until June
 thirtieth,  two  thousand  [twenty-four] TWENTY-FIVE; provided, however,
 that  any  party to such agreement may elect to terminate such agreement
 upon conveying written notice to all other parties of such agreement  at
 least  forty-five  days  prior to the effective date of the termination,
 via registered mail. Any party to an agreement receiving such notice  of
 an  intent  to  terminate, may request the commission to mediate between
 the parties new terms and conditions in a replacement agreement  between
 the  parties  as will permit continuation of an in-home experiment until
 June thirtieth, two thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE;  and  (iv)  no
 in-home  simulcasting in the thoroughbred special betting district shall
 occur without the approval of the regional thoroughbred track.
  § 2. Subparagraph (iii) of paragraph d of  subdivision  3  of  section
 1007 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, as amended by
 section  2  of  part BB of chapter 59 of the laws of 2023, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (iii) Of the sums retained by a receiving track located in Westchester
 county on races received from a franchised corporation, for  the  period
 commencing January first, two thousand eight and continuing through June
 thirtieth,  two  thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE,  the  amount used
 exclusively for purses to be awarded at races conducted by such  receiv-
 ing track shall be computed as follows: of the sums so retained, two and
 one-half  percent  of the total pools. Such amount shall be increased or
 decreased in the amount of fifty percent  of  the  difference  in  total
 commissions  determined  by  comparing  the  total commissions available
 after July twenty-first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  to  the  total
 commissions  that  would have been available to such track prior to July
 twenty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-five.
  § 3. The opening paragraph of subdivision 1 of  section  1014  of  the

  (a) The  franchised  corporation  authorized  under  this  chapter  to
 conduct pari-mutuel betting at a race meeting or races run thereat shall
 distribute  all sums deposited in any pari-mutuel pool to the holders of
 winning tickets therein, provided such tickets are presented for payment
 before April first of the year following the  year  of  their  purchase,
 less an amount that shall be established and retained by such franchised
 corporation of between twelve to seventeen percent of the total deposits
 in  pools  resulting from on-track regular bets, and fourteen to twenty-

 of part QQ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2022,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (a)  The  franchised corporation shall maintain a separate account for
 all funds held on deposit in trust by  the  corporation  for  individual
 horsemen's  accounts.  Purse  funds  shall be paid by the corporation as
 required to meet its purse payment obligations. Funds held in horsemen's
 accounts shall only be released or applied as requested and directed  by
 the  individual  horseman.  Through  calendar year [two thousand twenty-
 five] TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SEVEN the New York Jockey Injury  Compensation
 Fund,  Inc.  may  use  up to two million dollars from the account estab-
 lished pursuant to this subdivision to pay the annual costs required  by

  §  2.  The  opening  paragraph  of subdivision 7 of section 221 of the
 racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, as amended by  section  1
 of  part  QQ  of  chapter  59 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as

  In order to pay the costs of the insurance required  by  this  section

 and duties and to pay for any of its  liabilities  under  section  four-
 teen-a  of  the  workers'  compensation  law, the New York Jockey Injury
 Compensation Fund, Inc. shall ascertain the total funding necessary  and
 establish  the  sums  that  are  to  be  paid by all owners and trainers
 licensed or required to be licensed under section two hundred twenty  of
 S. 8309--B  19  A. 8809--B
 
 this  article,  to obtain the total funding amount required annually. In
 order to provide that any sum required to be paid by an owner or trainer
 is equitable, the fund shall establish payment  schedules  that  reflect
 such  factors  as  are  appropriate,  including  where  applicable,  the
 geographic location of the racing corporation  at  which  the  owner  or
 trainer  participates, the duration of such participation, the amount of
 any purse earnings, the number of horses involved, or such other factors
 as the fund shall determine to be fair, equitable and in the best inter-
 ests of racing. In no event shall the amount deducted  from  an  owner's
 share  of purses exceed two percent; provided, however, through calendar
 year [two thousand twenty-five] TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SEVEN, the New  York
 Jockey Injury Compensation Fund, Inc.  may use up to two million dollars
 from the account established pursuant to subdivision nine of section two
 hundred  eight  of this article to pay the annual costs required by this
 section and the funds from such account shall not count against the  two
 percent  of  purses deducted from an owner's share of purses. The amount
 deducted from an owner's share of purses shall not  exceed  one  percent
 after April first, [two thousand twenty-four] TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SEVEN.
 In  the cases of multiple ownerships and limited racing appearances, the
 fund shall equitably adjust the sum required.

 uing  through  August thirty-first, [two thousand twenty-four] TWO THOU-
 SAND TWENTY-SEVEN, two percent of all purses shall be withheld, and,  in
 the  case  of  the  franchised  corporation,  to  pay  such  sum  to the
 horsemen's organization or its successor  that  was  first  entitled  to
 receive  payments  pursuant  to this section in accordance with rules of
 the commission adopted effective November third, nineteen hundred eight-
 y-three representing at least fifty-one percent of the owners and train-
 ers using the facilities of such franchised corporation, on  the  condi-
 tion  that  such  horsemen's  organization  shall  expend  as much as is
 necessary, but not to exceed one-half of one percent of such total  sum,
 to acquire and maintain the equipment required to establish a program at
 a  state  college  within  this  state  with  an approved equine science
 program to test for the presence of steroids in horses, provided further
 that the qualified organization shall also, in an amount  to  be  deter-
 mined  by  its  board of directors, annually include in its expenditures
 for benevolence programs, funds to  support  an  organization  providing
 services  necessary  to backstretch employees, and, in the case of every
 other corporation, to  pay  such  one  percent  sum  of  purses  to  the

 receive payments pursuant to this section in accordance  with  rules  of
 the  commission  adopted  effective  May  twenty-third, nineteen hundred
 eighty-six representing at least fifty-one percent  of  the  owners  and

  Section  1.  Subdivision  1  of section 220 of the racing, pari-mutuel
 wagering and breeding law, as amended by chapter  243  of  the  laws  of
 2020, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  For the purpose of maintaining a proper control over race meetings
 conducted pursuant to sections two hundred five and two hundred  six  of
 this  article,  the commission shall license owners, which term shall be
 deemed to include part-owners and lessees, trainers, assistant  trainers
 and  jockeys, jockey agents, stable employees, and such other persons as
 the commission may by rule prescribe at running races  and  at  steeple-
 chases,  provided,  however,  that no such license shall be required for
 seasonal employees hired solely to work for no  longer  than  six  weeks
 during  the  summer meet at Saratoga racetrack, AND ANY SUCH OTHER TIMES
 AS RACE DATES HISTORICALLY ASSIGNED TO BELMONT PARK ARE CONDUCTED AT THE
 SARATOGA RACETRACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND  TWENTY-
 FIVE  AS  APPROVED  IN  WRITING  BY  THE COMMISSION. In the event that a
 proposed licensee is other than a natural person, the  commission  shall
 require  by  regulation  disclosure  of  the  names and addresses of all
 owners of an interest in such entity. The commission may retain,  employ
 or appoint such officers, employees and agents, as it may deem necessary
 to  receive,  examine and make recommendations, for the consideration of
 the commission, in respect of applications for such licenses;  prescribe
 their  duties in connection therewith, and fix their compensation there-
 for within the limitations prescribed  by  law.  Each  applicant  for  a
 license  shall  pay  to the commission an annual license fee as follows:
 owner's license, if a renewal, fifty dollars, and if an original  appli-
 cation,  one hundred dollars; trainer's license, thirty dollars; assist-
 ant trainer's license, thirty dollars; jockey's license, fifty  dollars;
 jockey  agent's  license, twenty dollars; and stable employee's license,
 five dollars. Each applicant may apply  for  a  two-year  or  three-year
 license  by payment to the commission of the appropriate multiple of the
 annual fee. The commission may by rule fix the license fees to  be  paid
 by other persons required to be licensed by the rules of the commission,
 not  to  exceed  thirty  dollars  per  category. The application for the
 license shall  be  in  writing  in  such  form  as  the  commission  may
 prescribe,  and  contain such information as the commission may require.
 The commission shall henceforth cause all applicants for licenses to  be
 photographed  and  fingerprinted  and  may issue identification cards to
 licensees. Such fingerprints shall be submitted to the division of crim-
 inal justice services for a state  criminal  history  record  check,  as
 defined  in subdivision one of section three thousand thirty-five of the
 education law, and may be submitted to the federal  bureau  of  investi-
 gation  for a national criminal history record check. A fee equal to the
 actual cost of issuance shall be charged for  the  initial  issuance  of
 such  identification  cards.  Each such license unless revoked for cause
 shall be for the period of no more than one, two or three years,  deter-
 mined by rule of the commission, expiring on the applicant's birth date.
 Licenses  current  on  the effective date of this provision shall not be
 reduced in duration by this provision. An applicant who  applies  for  a
 license that, if issued, would take effect less than six months prior to
 the  applicant's  birth  date  may, by payment of a fifty percent higher
 fee, receive a license which shall  not  expire  until  the  applicant's
 second  succeeding  birth  date.  All receipts of the commission derived
 from the operation of this section shall be paid by it  into  the  state
 treasury  on  or  before  the  tenth  day  of  each month. All officials
 connected with the actual conduct of racing shall be subject to approval
 by the commission.
