 DIATELY PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE JUDGMENT OF FORECLOSURE MAY FILE  A
 CLAIM  WITH  THE  COURT  HAVING  JURISDICTION FOR A SHARE OF ANY SURPLUS
 RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF SUCH PROPERTY.  SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE ADMINIS-

 FOR THE PROPERTY SHALL BE ACCEPTED AS THE FULL VALUE  OF  THE  PROPERTY.

 SUPPORTS  THE  CLAIMANT'S  POSITION,  THE COURT MAY DIRECT THE ENFORCING
 OFFICER TO RECALCULATE THE SURPLUS BASED UPON THE  PROPERTY'S  VALUE  AS
 DETERMINED  BY  THE  COURT OR REFEREE.  THE COURT MAY FURTHER DIRECT THE
 ENFORCING OFFICER TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE INTO COURT TO BE DISTRIBUTED  AS
 REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION.

  E.  Prior  to a corporation being able to utilize the funds authorized
 by paragraph c OR D of this subdivision,  the  corporation  must  attest
 that  the  surcharge monies from section five hundred thirty-two of this
 chapter are being held separate and apart  from  any  amounts  otherwise
 authorized  to  be  retained  from  pari-mutuel  pools and all surcharge
 monies have been and will continue to  be  paid  to  the  localities  as
 prescribed  in  law.  Once this condition is satisfied, the corporation
 must submit an expenditure plan to the  gaming  commission  for  review.
 Such  plan  shall  include  the  corporation's  outstanding liabilities,
 projected revenue for the upcoming year, a detailed explanation  of  how
 the  funds  will  be used, and any other information necessary to detail
 such plan as determined by the commission. Upon review,  the  commission
 shall  make a determination as to whether the requirements of this para-
 graph have been satisfied and notify the corporation of expenditure plan
 approval. In the event the commission  determines  the  requirements  of
 this  paragraph have not been satisfied, the commission shall notify the
 corporation of all deficiencies necessary for approval. As  a  condition
 of  such  expenditure  plan  approval,  the  corporation shall provide a
 report to the commission no later  than  [October  first,  two  thousand

 At  such  time,  the  commission  may  cause  an independent audit to be
 conducted of the corporation's books to  ensure  that  all  moneys  were
 spent  as  indicated  in such approved plan. The audit shall be paid for
 from money in the fund established by this section. If the audit  deter-
 mines  that  a  corporation used the money authorized under this section
 for a purpose other than one listed in their expenditure plan, then  the
 corporation  shall  reimburse the capital acquisition fund for the unau-
 thorized amount.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART P
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision  1  of  section  1003  of  the
 racing,  pari-mutuel  wagering and breeding law, as amended by section 1
 of part BB of chapter 59 of the laws of 2023,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (a)  Any  racing  association  or  corporation  or  regional off-track
 betting corporation, authorized to conduct  pari-mutuel  wagering  under
 this  chapter, desiring to display the simulcast of horse races on which
 pari-mutuel betting shall be permitted in the manner and subject to  the
 conditions  provided for in this article may apply to the commission for
 a license so to do. Applications for licenses shall be in such  form  as
 may  be  prescribed by the commission and shall contain such information
 or other material or evidence as the commission may require. No  license
 shall be issued by the commission authorizing the simulcast transmission
 of  thoroughbred  races  from a track located in Suffolk county. The fee
 for such licenses shall be five hundred dollars per  simulcast  facility
 and  for  account wagering licensees that do not operate either a simul-
 cast facility that is open to the public within the state of New York or
 a licensed racetrack within the state, twenty thousand dollars per  year
 payable  by  the licensee to the commission for deposit into the general
 fund. Except as provided in  this  section,  the  commission  shall  not
 approve any application to conduct simulcasting into individual or group
 S. 8309--A  41
 
 residences,  homes  or  other areas for the purposes of or in connection
 with pari-mutuel wagering. The commission may approve simulcasting  into
 residences,  homes or other areas to be conducted jointly by one or more
 regional  off-track  betting corporations and one or more of the follow-
 ing: a franchised corporation,  thoroughbred  racing  corporation  or  a
 harness racing corporation or association; provided (i) the simulcasting
 consists  only of those races on which pari-mutuel betting is authorized
 by this chapter at one or more simulcast  facilities  for  each  of  the
 contracting  off-track  betting  corporations which shall include wagers
 made in accordance with  section  one  thousand  fifteen,  one  thousand
 sixteen  and  one  thousand  seventeen of this article; provided further
 that the contract provisions or other simulcast  arrangements  for  such
 simulcast  facility  shall  be no less favorable than those in effect on
 January first, two thousand  five;  (ii)  that  each  off-track  betting
 corporation  having  within  its  geographic boundaries such residences,
 homes or other areas technically  capable  of  receiving  the  simulcast
 signal  shall be a contracting party; (iii) the distribution of revenues
 shall be subject to contractual agreement of  the  parties  except  that
 statutory  payments  to  non-contracting  parties,  if  any,  may not be
 reduced; provided, however, that nothing herein to  the  contrary  shall
 prevent a track from televising its races on an irregular basis primari-
 ly for promotional or marketing purposes as found by the commission. For
 purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of section one thousand thir-
 teen  of  this  article  shall  not  apply. Any agreement authorizing an
 in-home simulcasting experiment commencing prior to May fifteenth, nine-
 teen hundred ninety-five, may, and all its terms, be extended until June
 thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE;  provided,  however,
 that  any  party to such agreement may elect to terminate such agreement
 upon conveying written notice to all other parties of such agreement  at
 least  forty-five  days  prior to the effective date of the termination,
 via registered mail. Any party to an agreement receiving such notice  of
 an  intent  to  terminate, may request the commission to mediate between
 the parties new terms and conditions in a replacement agreement  between
 the  parties  as will permit continuation of an in-home experiment until
 June thirtieth, two thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE;  and  (iv)  no
 in-home  simulcasting in the thoroughbred special betting district shall
 occur without the approval of the regional thoroughbred track.
  § 2. Subparagraph (iii) of paragraph d of  subdivision  3  of  section
 1007 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, as amended by

 read as follows:
  (iii) Of the sums retained by a receiving track located in Westchester
 county on races received from a franchised corporation, for  the  period
 commencing January first, two thousand eight and continuing through June
 thirtieth,  two  thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE,  the  amount used
 exclusively for purses to be awarded at races conducted by such  receiv-
 ing track shall be computed as follows: of the sums so retained, two and
 one-half  percent  of the total pools. Such amount shall be increased or
 decreased in the amount of fifty percent  of  the  difference  in  total
 commissions  determined  by  comparing  the  total commissions available
 after July twenty-first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  to  the  total
 commissions  that  would have been available to such track prior to July
 twenty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-five.

  (A)  Notwithstanding  any contrary provisions of this article or other
 law, with respect to any lease for a term of one year or more of  (1)  a
 motor  vehicle,  as  defined  in  section one hundred twenty-five of the
 vehicle and traffic law, with a gross vehicle  weight  of  ten  thousand
 pounds  or  less,  [or]  (2)  a vessel, as defined in section twenty-two
 hundred fifty of such law (including any inboard or outboard  motor  and

 HAVING  A  SEATING CAPACITY OF LESS THAN TWENTY PASSENGERS AND A MAXIMUM

 ation given or contracted to be given for such property  under  and  for

 shall  be subject to tax, and any such tax due shall be collected, as of
 the date of first payment under such lease, option to renew  or  similar
 provision,  or combination of them, or as of the date of registration of
 S. 8309--A  48
 
 such property with the commissioner  of  motor  vehicles,  whichever  is

 or  of other law, for purposes of such a lease, option to renew or simi-
 lar provision originally entered into outside this state,  by  a  lessee

 remaining receipts due or consideration to be given  after  such  lessee
 brings  such  property into this state shall be subject to tax as if the
 lessee had entered into or exercised such  lease,  option  to  renew  or
 similar  provision,  or  combination thereof, for the first time in this
 state and  the  relevant  provisions  of  sections  eleven  hundred  ten
 concerning  imposition  and  computation of tax, eleven hundred eighteen

 ing  use  tax  paid by the lessee before the lessee brought the property

 sistent  with  a  provision  of  this  subdivision. For purposes of this
 subdivision, (1) a lease for a term of one year or  more  shall  include
 any  lease for a shorter term which includes an option to renew or other

 where  the cumulative period that the lease, with or without such option
 or provision, may be in effect upon exercise of such option or provision

  § 2. Subdivision (q) of section 1111 of the tax  law,  as  amended  by
 section  2  of  part TT of chapter 59 of the laws of 2015, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (q) (1) The exclusions from the definition of retail sale in  subpara-
 graph  (iv)  of  paragraph  four  of  subdivision  (b) of section eleven
 hundred one of this article shall not apply to transfers, distributions,
 or contributions of AN AIRCRAFT OR a vessel, except where, in  the  case
 of  the  exclusion  in  subclause (I) of clause (A) of such subparagraph
 (iv), the two corporations to be merged or consolidated are  not  affil-
 iated  persons with respect to each other. For purposes of this subdivi-
 sion, corporations are affiliated persons with  respect  to  each  other
 where  (i)  more than five percent of their combined shares are owned by
 members of the same family, as defined by paragraph four  of  subsection
 (c)  of  section two hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code of
 nineteen hundred eighty-six; (ii) one of the corporations has an  owner-
 ship  interest of more than five percent, whether direct or indirect, in
 the other; or (iii) another person or a group of other persons that  are
 affiliated persons with respect to each other hold an ownership interest
 of  more  than  five percent, whether direct or indirect, in each of the
 corporations.
  (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, in relation to  any
 transfer,  distribution, or contribution of AN AIRCRAFT OR a vessel that
 qualifies as a retail sale as a result of paragraph one of this subdivi-
 sion, the sales tax imposed by subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred
 five of this part shall be computed based on  the  price  at  which  the
 seller purchased the tangible personal property, provided that where the
 S. 8309--A  49
 
 seller  or purchaser affirmatively shows that the seller owned the prop-
 erty for six months  prior  to  making  the  transfer,  distribution  or
 contribution covered by paragraph one of this subdivision, such AIRCRAFT
 OR vessel shall be taxed on the basis of the current market value of the
 AIRCRAFT  OR  vessel  at  the  time  of  that transfer, distribution, or
 contribution. For the purposes of the prior  sentence,  "current  market
 value" shall not exceed the cost of the AIRCRAFT OR vessel. See subdivi-
 sion  (b)  of  this section for a similar rule on the computation of any
 compensating use tax due under section eleven hundred ten of  this  part
 on such transfers, distributions, or contributions.
  (3) A purchaser of AN AIRCRAFT OR a vessel covered by paragraph one of
 this  subdivision  will  be  entitled  to a refund or credit against the
 sales or compensating use tax due as a result of  a  transfer,  distrib-
 ution,  or  contribution of such AIRCRAFT OR vessel in the amount of any
 sales or use tax paid to this state or any other state on  the  seller's
 purchase or use of the AIRCRAFT OR vessel so transferred, distributed or
 contributed,  but  not  to  exceed the tax due on the transfer, distrib-
 ution, or contribution of the AIRCRAFT OR vessel or on  the  purchaser's
 use  in  the state of the AIRCRAFT OR vessel so transferred, distributed
 or contributed. An application for a refund or credit under this  subdi-
 vision  must  be filed and shall be in such form as the commissioner may
 prescribe. Where an application for credit has been filed, the applicant
 may immediately take such credit on the return which is  due  coincident
 with or immediately subsequent to the time the application for credit is
 filed.  However,  the taking of the credit on the return shall be deemed
 to be part of the application for credit. Provided that the commissioner
 may, in his or her discretion and notwithstanding any other  law,  waive
 the  application requirement for any or all classes of persons where the
 amount of the credit or refund is equal to the amount  of  the  tax  due
 from  the purchaser. The provisions of subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of
 section eleven hundred thirty-nine of this article shall apply to appli-
 cations for refund or credit under this subdivision. No  interest  shall
 be  allowed  or  paid  on  any  refund made or credit allowed under this
 subdivision. If a refund is granted or a credit allowed under this para-
 graph, the seller or purchaser shall not be eligible  for  a  refund  or
 credit  pursuant to subdivision seven of section eleven hundred eighteen
 of this article with regard to the same purchase or use.
  § 3. Paragraph 21-a of subdivision (a) of section 1115 of the tax  law
 is REPEALED.

 shall be read as a reference to this subsection.
  (1) For resident married individuals filing joint returns and resident
 surviving spouses:
  (A) If New York adjusted gross income is greater  than  $107,650,  but
 not over $25,000,000:

 the  taxpayer  is less than one hundred seven thousand six hundred fifty
 dollars, the supplemental tax shall equal  the  difference  between  the

 computation on the New York taxable income set forth in paragraph one of
 subsection (b) of this section, multiplied by a fraction, the  numerator
 of  which  is  the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or New York adjusted
 gross income minus one hundred seven thousand six hundred fifty dollars,
 and the denominator of which is fifty thousand dollars.
  (B) If New York adjusted gross  income  is  greater  than  twenty-five
 million  dollars,  the  supplemental  tax due shall equal the difference
