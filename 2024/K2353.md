  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 8, 2024, as Grandparents Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of the vital role
grandparents play in the lives of countless children throughout New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions, this Legislative Body is moved to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 8, 2024, as Grandparents Day
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Grandparents Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, Grandparents Day  is  celebrated  on  the  first
Sunday  of  September  after  Labor  Day,  by  honoring the bond between
grandparents and grandchildren; and
 
  WHEREAS, Grandparents and children have a special connection that is
proven  to  both  make  grandparents  live  longer,  and  children  more
emotionally  resilient;  Grandparents  Day is an opportunity to treasure
that connection and spend some quality family time together; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1969, nine-year-old Russell Capper sent President  Nixon
a letter suggesting a day be set aside to celebrate grandparents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  this  letter,  Marian  McQuade,  known  for her
activism with senior citizens, was recognized  nationally  by  the  U.S.
Senate  and  by  President  Jimmy  Carter  as  the  founder  of National
Grandparents Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Marian McQuade  wanted  to  educate  the  youth  about  the
importance  of  seniors  and the contributions they have made throughout
history; she urged the youth to "adopt" a  grandparent  and  learn  more
about their lives, challenges, and desires for the future; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1977, United States Senator Randolph, with the help of
other Senators, introduced a joint resolution in the  Senate  requesting
the  President  to  "issue annually a proclamation designating the first
Sunday  of  September  after  Labor  Day  of  each  year  as  National
Grandparents' Day"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Congress passed the legislation and President Jimmy Carter
signed  the  proclamation  on  August  3,  1978;  Grandparents  Day  was
officially celebrated the following year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Grandparents  Day  remains  a  day  to  honor  the
priceless roll grandparents play in the lives of the children they love;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout our State and Nation, it  is  vitally  important
that  the  public  acknowledges  grandparents  and their significance as
 
voices of the past and role models for the future of our  most  precious
resource, our youth; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  September  8,  2024,  as
Grandparents Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
