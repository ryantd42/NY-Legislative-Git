  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  150
  - Average Age:  42.3
  - Average Service:  11.2
  - Average Salary:  81,500
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, a New York City Deputy Sheriff
 who becomes disabled due to lung disease would be eligible for an appli-
 cable ordinary disability retirement, generally a  lifetime  payment  of
 1/3  of salary.  The ordinary death benefit is a lump sum payment gener-
 ally equal to three times the member's salary.
  Under the proposed legislation, the  performance  of  duty  disability
 benefit  for  NYCERS  Deputy  Sheriff members who are disabled from lung
 disease would be equal to:
  * 75% of Final Average Salary (FAS), where
  * FAS is defined as 3-Year FAS for Tier 4 and 5-Year FAS for  Tier  6,
 without
  * an explicit Workers' Compensation offset.
  Under  the proposed legislation, the performance of duty death benefit
 would generally be equal to a lifetime benefit  of  50%  of  a  member's
 wages  earned  during the last year of service, plus, if applicable, the
 Special Accidental Death Benefit (SADB) payable under General  Municipal
 Law section 208-f.
  SADB  for  Deputy  Sheriffs  was enacted by Chapter 720 of the Laws of
 2023 and all accidental deaths are assumed to qualify for SADB.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  The number of members and eligible retirees who will  benefit  in  the
 future  from  this  fiscal  note  is  unknown. The cost of this proposed
 legislation could vary greatly depending on the number of future members
 who benefit and on their length of service, age, and salary history.  In
 particular,  the  increase  would be greater for a member who is not yet
 eligible for an ODR benefit when the disabling  lung  disease  is  diag-
 nosed.
  The  estimated  financial  impact for disabled members has been calcu-
 lated assuming 50% would have retired under an Ordinary Disability bene-
 fit, and 50% would have continued working if  the  proposed  legislation
 were not passed.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 A. 9391  4
 
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 sky  are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of
 Actuaries. We are members of NYCERS but do not believe  it  impairs  our
 objectivity  and  we  meet  the  Qualification Standards of the American
 Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained  herein.
 To  the  best  of  our knowledge, the results contained herein have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and
 procedures  and  with  the Actuarial Standards of Practice issued by the

 2024 was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City  Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
