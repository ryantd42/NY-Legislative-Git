  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary of America's
  Greatest Heart Run/Walk
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
organizations  of  noble  aims  and accomplishments for their charitable
endeavors which serve New York communities at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of America's Greatest Heart Run/Walk of
Utica, New York, on Saturday, March 2, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Utica, New York, is home to  this  much-anticipated  annual
event,  with  roots  running  back  to 1947, when one lone runner, Larry
Lewicki, collected $65 from co-workers at  Jay-K  Lumber  and  ran  five
miles to support the American Heart Association; four friends joined him
the next year and raised $274; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1988,  the  Heart Run became the Run/Walk when walkers
were added to the mix; today, walkers make up most of the  participants,
a  result of making this esteemed event more accessible to people of all
abilities and interests; and
 
  WHEREAS, The various routes of this walk and run  are  comprised  of
the traditional 18-mile run, 3-mile run, and the 3-mile walk; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Millions  of  dollars  raised through the years because of
this charitable event have helped save countless lives, many of them  in
Central  New  York;  research and development have remained paramount in
combatting heart disease and have resulted in new  leases  on  life  for
people of all ages who have faced life-and-death situations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This commendable charitable event is an asset to the State
of New York, supporting such a widely  impactful  and  important  cause,
while  providing opportunities for community to grow and thrive together
for a greater good; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  50th Anniversary of America's Greatest Heart Run/Walk;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  organizers of America's Greatest Heart Run/Walk of
Utica, New York.
