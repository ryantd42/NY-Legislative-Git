  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  legislature  hereby finds and determines that fire
 protection is one of the most significant and vital  municipal  services
 provided to the citizens of the state.  Any proposed action by municipal
 officers  which  threatens  to  alter the manner or level of delivery of
 fire services ought to be on notice to the community since it  is  quite
 often of significant concern to the affected community.
  In  order to enable the community to have sufficient public discussion
 through the use of existing community boards and their established abil-
 ity to effectively notify the members of the community  and  to  conduct
 public hearings on the proposal, the within provisions are enacted.
  §  2.  The  general  municipal  law is amended by adding a new section
 209-h to read as follows:
  § 209-H. REDUCTION OF FIRE SERVICES IN CERTAIN  MUNICIPALITIES;  PRIOR
 NOTICE  REQUIRED.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  INCONSISTENT PROVISION OF ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL OR LOCAL LAW, OR RULE OR REGULATION  TO  THE  CONTRARY,
 THE  FIRE  COMMISSIONER  OF ANY FIRE DEPARTMENT IN CITIES HAVING A POPU-
 LATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE SHALL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY ALTER THE  BOUNDA-
 RIES  OF FIRE COMPANIES, ONCE FIXED, CLOSE A BOROUGH FIRE COMMUNICATIONS
 OFFICE, REMOVE OR DISMANTLE A FIRE ALARM BOX, OR CLOSE, REMOVE, OR RELO-
 CATE A FIRE COMPANY UNLESS AT LEAST THIRTY  DAYS  PRIOR  TO  THE  TAKING
 EFFECT  OF  SUCH  ACTION  WRITTEN  NOTICE THEREOF HAS BEEN GIVEN TO EACH
 LOCAL COMMUNITY BOARD OR BOARDS HAVING JURISDICTION OVER  THAT  PART  OF
 THE CITY DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY SUCH PROPOSED ACTION OR SERVICE REDUCTION.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
