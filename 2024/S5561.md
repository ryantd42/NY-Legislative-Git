  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  division  of  homes  and community renewal, in conjunction with the
 office of community renewal  and  the  affordable  housing  corporation,
 shall  conduct  a  pilot program to provide people in New York state who
 are  presently  and  who  have  been  historically  underrepresented  in
 homeownership  with  the resources they need, including outreach, educa-
 tion, and financial assistance, to achieve the dream of homeownership in
 a sustainable manner.
  § 2. Such pilot program shall be conducted in three areas  around  our
 state  that  have  seen declines in homeownership among underrepresented
 persons and groups.  The division of homes and community  renewal  shall
 choose  the  three  areas  in which the pilot program will be conducted,
 considering such factors  including,  but  not  limited  to,  population
 growth among underrepresented persons or groups that is not reflected in
 an  increase in homeownership among those same persons and groups, popu-
 lation changes that have resulted in  displacement  of  underrepresented
 persons and groups, and declines in homeownership among underrepresented
 persons or groups during the period since the financial crisis of 2008.
  § 3. Such pilot program shall make use of up to two million dollars of
 existing  funding  from the affordable housing corporation, section 45-b
 of the private housing finance law, to ensure equity in the  utilization

 homeownership more broadly to low- and moderate-income residents of  New
 York  state, and shall increase the amount of the downpayment assistance
 to  up  to $75,000 per eligible homebuyer as is needed and deemed neces-
 sary without imposing an increase to the existing regulatory period.
  § 4. The division of homes and community renewal  shall  also  utilize
 the state's existing network of nonprofit housing organizations, includ-
 ing,  but not limited to, the Neighborhood and Rural Preservation Compa-
 nies, local community development  corporations,  and  other  community-
 based  housing  organizations,  that  provide  financial  management and
 housing counseling services to support low- and moderate-income homebuy-
 ers.
  § 5. The division of homes and community renewal shall issue  a  joint
 report  on  the status of the pilot program to the chair of the New York
 state senate standing committee on housing, construction  and  community
 development,  and  the  chair  of  the  New York state assembly standing
 committee on housing by December 31, 2023.
  § 6. Such report shall include, but not be limited to, the  status  of
 the  program,  the areas identified for the pilot, the nonprofit housing
 organizations identified as service providers, and the number of  people
 participating in the program.
  §  7. This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire April 1,
 2024 when upon such date the provisions of  this  act  shall  be  deemed
 repealed.
