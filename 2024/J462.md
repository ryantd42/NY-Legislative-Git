  COMMEMORATING  the  70th  Anniversary  of Alteri's
  Restaurant
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
illustrious  culinary  establishments which have positively impacted and
substantially contributed to the vitality of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 70th Anniversary of Alteri's Restaurant; and
 
  WHEREAS, The remarkable success of Alteri's  Restaurant  is  due  in
large  part  to  its  generations  of  owners,  including John and Laura
Alteri, John's  son  and  daughter-in-law,  Fernando  and  Beverly,  and
current  owner,  Fran  Alteri,  their dedicated staff, whose warmth, and
hospitality are easily recognized by their loyal patrons;  this  dynamic
business is well-versed in customer service and truly makes everyone who
walks through their door feel like family; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Opened  on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1953, by John and
Laura Alteri, the  restaurant  remained  under  their  management  until
John's passing in 1960; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  restaurant  was rebuilt after a fire in 1963, and the
family-owned business tradition was then passed to John Alteri's son and
daughter-in-law, Fernando, and Beverly, until 1998; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today,  third-generation  owner  Fran  Alteri  manages  his
family's  warm,  home-style restaurant and seasoned bar, bringing people
together with their famous pizza, pasta, sandwiches, soup,  beer,  wine,
and spirits; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  staff's  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,
characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
an  uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of
the business and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, For seven decades,  Alteri's  Restaurant  has  stood  as  a
beloved  establishment  which  has provided a friendly, open environment
for patrons to collectively gather and share their thoughts, ideas,  and
life experiences; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business  and  its  contributions  to  the
local  and  State  economies,  fully  confident that it will continue to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 70th Anniversary of Alteri's Restaurant,  and  to  offer
its best wishes for continued success in all their future endeavors; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
