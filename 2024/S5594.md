 AN  ACT  to  amend  the public authorities law, in relation to exempting
  mass transit authorities from bond issuance charges

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "statewide  transportation  authority  reinvestment  (STAR)  act  of
 2023".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  The  public authorities that provide mass
 transit service in the areas of  New  York  City,  Long  Island,  Hudson
 Valley, Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Syracuse and their suburbs are given
 the  power to issue debt, which they can use to fund capital projects or
 operations. However, state law requires these  authorities  to  pay  the
 state  a  fee  each  time  they issue bonds, totaling up to almost 1% of
 bonds issued depending on the amount of the  issuance.  The  legislature
 finds that in a time when these authorities face increasing fiscal chal-
 lenges,  the  fees  these  authorities must pay to the state rob them of
 resources to maintain reliable, attractive bus and rail service which is
 an inherent public good. It is the intent of the legislature to  relieve
 transportation  authorities  of the burden of acting as a revenue source
 for the state when they invest in their operations and  capital  infras-
 tructure,  and  that  these  authorities  use  the  savings accrued from
 exemptions from this fee to maintain service levels and prevent  service
 cuts, or for transformative capital projects.
  §  3.  Section  2 of the public authorities law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 7 to read as follows:
  7. "MASS TRANSIT AUTHORITY" SHALL MEAN THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION
 AUTHORITY, NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT AUTHORITY, TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE AND TUNNEL
 AUTHORITY, CAPITAL DISTRICT TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, CENTRAL  NEW  YORK
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 AND MEMBERS ALSO SERVE AS THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF A LOCAL  OR  STATE
 AUTHORITY CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF OPERATING TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO RAILROAD AND/OR OMNIBUS FACILITIES.
  §  4.  Subdivision 4 of section 2976 of the public authorities law, as
 added by section 12 of part E of chapter 494 of the  laws  of  2009,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  4.  The  provisions  of subdivisions one and two of this section shall
 not apply TO BONDS ISSUED BY MASS TRANSIT AUTHORITIES  AND  to  recovery
 act  bonds issued by the state of New York municipal bond bank agency in
 connection with local American Recovery and Reinvestment Act pursuant to
 section two thousand four hundred thirty-six-b of this chapter.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
