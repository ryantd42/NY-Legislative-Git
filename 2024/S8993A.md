 Introduced  by  Sen.  RAMOS  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance
 
 AN ACT to amend the private housing finance law, in relation  to  estab-
  lishing  a  jobs  and  housing  pilot  program  to  create jobs in the
  construction industry and address the housing crisis;  and  making  an
  appropriation therefor

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "jobs and housing act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent. 1. The legislature finds and declares that
 New York state is in the midst of a jobs and housing crisis.  More  than
 half  of  renters statewide are rent-burdened, spending more than 30% of
 their income on rent. Over 60,000 New Yorkers are homeless. Home  owner-
 ship  has  slipped  out  of reach for an entire generation, cracking the
 foundation of the American Dream and threatening to  deepen  the  racial
 wealth gap. The backbone of New York state's existing supply of afforda-
 ble  housing  is  in  jeopardy;  new  unfunded renewable energy mandates
 threaten to impose extraordinary  capital  costs  on  Mitchell-Lama  and
 similar limited equity cooperatives built by labor unions that will push
 them out of affordability.
  2.  The housing crisis has also become a labor crisis due to shortages
 of workforce housing. Over 500,000 people left New York state  in  2022,
 driven  out  of  the  state  by high housing costs. Working families and
 talented professionals are leaving New York  in  search  of  a  path  to
 homeownership,  or  at  least housing they can afford. In New York city,
 civil service positions that require residency, once highly sought-after
 as a ticket to middle-class stability, have now become harder  to  fill.
 New York state must dramatically expand its supply of affordable housing
 to remain competitive in the global economy.
  3.  The housing crisis is exacerbating a crisis of good jobs, which in
 turn exacerbates the housing crisis. Median real  household  income  has
 declined  by  7.2% in New York state since 2019. Workers are squeezed by
 skyrocketing housing costs on the one hand, and stagnant real  wages  on

 the other. Historically, union careers in the construction industry have
 been a pathway to the middle class for thousands of New Yorkers, partic-
 ularly  immigrant workers, workers of color, and workers without college
 degrees,  but  since 2019, the industry lost over 44,400 jobs due to the
 pandemic. Public spending on residential housing construction is urgent-
 ly needed to close the gap by creating good jobs for working  people  in
 New  York  state,  which  will  result  in a virtuous cycle of increased
 consumer spending to sustain economic growth.
  4. The housing crisis threatens to deepen the racial wealth gap in New
 York state. White households are more than twice as likely to own  their
 own  homes than Black or Latino households in New York state. Decades of
 racial discrimination through redlining, restrictive covenants, and most
 recently, predatory lending have prevented  Black  and  Latino  families
 from  accessing  the  wealth-building engine of home ownership. This has
 contributed to a massive racial wealth gap: in New  York  state,  median
 White  household net worth is $276,900, while Black median household net
 worth is $18,870. The housing crisis threatens to deepen this  disparity
 by  pushing  home  ownership  further  out of reach for Black and Latino
 households.
  5. The current model of housing development is not working for working
 people and threatens the economic vitality of our state. It is therefore
 in the interests of the people of New York to pilot a  new  approach  to
 creating good jobs and affordable workforce housing.
