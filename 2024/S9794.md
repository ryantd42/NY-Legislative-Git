  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Section 8-306 of the election law, paragraph (c) of subdi-
 vision 2 and subdivision 9 as amended by chapter 9 of the laws of  1978,
 subdivision  3  as amended by section 10 of part XX of chapter 55 of the
 laws of 2019, and subdivisions 4 and 7 as amended by chapter 647 of  the
 laws of 1982, is amended to read as follows:
  §  8-306.  Voters; assistance to. 1. A voter who [states under oath to
 the board of inspectors that he requires] REQUESTS assistance [may]  DUE
 TO  BLINDNESS,  DISABILITY,  OR  INABILITY  TO  READ  OR  WRITE SHALL be
 assisted in the manner and subject to the  conditions  and  requirements
 provided for in this section.
  2. [A board of inspectors of election shall assist any voter:
  (a) who informs such board, under oath, that he cannot read and there-
 fore requires assistance, or
  (b)  who  cannot even with the aid of glasses see the names printed on
 the official ballot, or
  (c) who is so physically handicapped that he cannot do what is  needed
 at  that  election  to  turn down the levers or use a write-in slot on a
 voting machine, or mark a paper ballot, or
  (d) who, unless aided by another person, cannot enter a voting booth.
  3.] Any voter who requires assistance to vote by reason of  blindness,
 disability  or  inability  to read or write may be given assistance by a
 person of the voter's choice, other than the voter's employer  or  agent
 of the employer or officer or agent of the voter's union. A voter [enti-
 tled  to  assistance in voting] WHO REQUESTS ASSISTANCE TO VOTE who does
 not select a particular person may be assisted by two  election  inspec-
 tors not of the same political faith. The inspectors or person assisting
 a voter shall enter the voting machine or booth with the voter, help the

 voter in the preparation of the voter's ballot and, if necessary, in the
 return  of  the voted ballot to the inspectors for deposit in the ballot
 box. The inspectors shall enter in the space provided for such voter  in
 the  computer  generated  registration list, the name of each officer or
 person rendering such assistance.
  [4.] 3. An election officer or other person assisting  a  voter  shall
 not  in  any  manner  request or seek to persuade or induce the assisted
 voter to vote any particular ticket, or for any particular candidate, or
 for or against any particular ballot proposal, and  shall  not  keep  or
 make  any  memorandum  or  entry of anything occurring within the voting
 booth and shall not, directly or indirectly, reveal to any other  person
 the  name of any candidate voted for by such voter, or which ticket [he]
 SUCH VOTER has voted, except when  required  pursuant  to  law  to  give
 testimony as to such matter in a judicial proceeding.
  [5.]  4.  A  person  other  than  an inspector, who assists a voter in
 voting, shall make an oath before entering  the  booth  that  [he]  SUCH
 PERSON  "will  not  in any manner request, or seek to persuade or induce
 the voter to vote any particular ticket or for any particular candidate,
 and that [he] SUCH PERSON will not keep or make any memorandum or  entry
 of  anything  occurring within the booth, and that [he] SUCH PERSON will
 not, directly or indirectly, reveal to any person the name of any candi-
 date voted for by the voter, or which ticket [he] SUCH VOTER had  voted,
 or  anything  occurring  within  the  voting booth, except when required
 pursuant to law to give testimony as to such  a  matter  in  a  judicial
 proceeding."
  [6.  If a voter makes any false representation to obtain assistance in
 voting, he shall be punishable therefor as prescribed by law.
  7.] 5. For the instruction of voters, there may be so far as practica-
 ble, in each polling place, a mechanically operated model of  a  portion
 of  the  face  of the voting machine. Such model, if furnished, shall be
 located during the election on the inspectors' table or  in  some  other
 place  which  the  voters  must  pass  to reach the machine. Each voter,
 before entering the machine, shall, upon request, be instructed  regard-
 ing  its operation and such instruction illustrated on the model and the
 voter given opportunity personally to operate  the  model.  The  voter's
 attention shall also be called to the facsimile ballot so that the voter
 can  become  familiar with the location of the ballot proposals, if any,
 and the location of the respective offices to be filled at the election.
 If any voter, after entering the voting machine  booth  and  before  the
 closing of such booth, shall ask for further instructions concerning the
 manner  of voting, two inspectors of opposite political faith shall give
 such instructions to [him] SUCH VOTER.  No inspector or  other  election
 officer  or  other  person  instructing  a  voter, shall, in any manner,
 request, suggest or seek to persuade or induce any such  voter  to  vote
 any particular ticket, or for any particular candidate or for or against
 any  particular  ballot  proposal.  After  giving such instructions, the
 inspectors shall retire and such voter shall then close  the  booth  and
 vote as in the case of an unassisted voter.
  [8.]  6.  In  no  event shall an inspector or any other person enter a
 voting machine or booth for the purpose  of  giving  instructions  to  a
 voter,  after the voter has closed such booth, except as permitted here-
 in.
  [9.] 7. Any voter requesting a sample ballot shall be furnished one if
 available and [he] SUCH VOTER may take it away from the polling place.

  § 2. Subdivision 2 of section 8-304 of the election law, as amended by
 section 9 of part XX of chapter 55 of the laws of 2019,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  2.  If  a  person  who  alleges an inability to sign [his or her] SUCH
 PERSON'S name presents [himself or herself] THEMSELF to vote, the  board
 of  inspectors  shall  permit  such person to vote, unless challenged on
 other grounds, provided the voter had been permitted to register without
 signing the voter's name. The board shall enter  the  words  "Unable  to
 Sign"  in the space on the voter's registration poll record reserved for
 the voter's signature or on the line or  space  the  computer  generated
 registration  list  reserved for the voter's signature at such election.
 If the voter's signature appears upon the voter's registration record or
 in the computer generated registration list the  board  shall  challenge
 the  voter  forthwith,  except  that if such a person claims that [he or
 she] SUCH PERSON is unable to sign [his or her] SUCH  PERSON'S  name  by
 reason of a physical disability incurred since the voter's registration,
 the  board[,  if  convinced  of the existence of such disability,] shall
 permit [him or her] SUCH VOTER to vote, shall enter the words "Unable to
 Sign" [and a brief description of such disability] in the space reserved
 for the voter's signature at such election. At each subsequent election,
 if such disability still exists, the voter shall  be  entitled  to  vote
 without  signing their name and the board of inspectors, without further
 notation, shall enter the words "Unable to Sign" in the  space  reserved
 for the voter's signature at such election.
  §  3.  Paragraph (e) of subdivision 2 of section 8-508 of the election
 law, as amended by section 11 of part XX of chapter 55 of  the  laws  of
 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (e)  At  the  foot  of  such report or at the end of any such computer
 generated registration list, if applicable, shall be a certificate  that
 such  report  or  list  contains the names of all persons who were chal-
 lenged on the day of election, and that each voter so reported as having
 been challenged took the oaths as required, that  such  report  or  list
 contains  the  names  of all voters to whom such board gave [or allowed]
 assistance [and lists the nature of the disability which  required  such
 assistance  to  be given] and the names and family relationship, if any,
 to the voter of the persons by whom such assistance was  rendered;  that
 each such assisted voter informed such board [under oath] that [he] SUCH
 ASSISTED  VOTER  required such assistance and that each person rendering
 such assistance took  the  required  oath;  that  such  report  or  list
 contains  the  names  of  all voters who were permitted to vote although
 their registration poll records were missing; that the entries  made  by
 such  board  are  a  true  and  accurate  record of its proceedings with
 respect to the persons named in such report or list.
  § 4. Subdivision 4 of section 15-122 of the election law, as separate-
 ly amended by chapters 58 and 78 of the laws of  1984,  are  amended  to
 read as follows:
  4.  Any elector who is duly registered and who is permanently disabled
 may make application to the village clerk for a form  which  such  clerk
 shall  supply  for  the purpose of providing for the mailing of absentee
 ballots to permanently disabled voters.  [Such  form  shall  contain  an
 affidavit  to  be executed by the elector showing the particulars of his
 disability.] Upon the filing  of  such  application  the  inspectors  of
 election shall [investigate the facts stated therein and if satisfied as
 to  the  truth  thereof  may  approve such application and in such event
 shall] cause the registration record of the voter, if any, to be  marked
 "PERMANENTLY  DISABLED".  The  inspectors  shall also cause to be marked
 S. 9794  4
 
 "PERMANENTLY DISABLED", the registration poll records  of  those  voters
 who  are  indicated  as  permanently  disabled on the list of registered
 voters received from the board of  elections.  Thereafter,  the  village
 clerk  shall  send  an absentee voter's ballot for each election to such
 elector by first class mail to [his] SUCH ELECTOR'S last  known  address
 with  a request to the postal authorities not to forward such ballot but
 to return it in five days in the event that it cannot  be  delivered  to
 the  addressee.  The mailing of such ballot or ballots for each election
 shall continue as long as the elector remains a qualified voter  of  the
 village and unless it appears that such person has failed to return such
 ballot  for  the last two successive general village elections. Upon the
 mailing of such ballot or ballots, the village  clerk  shall  cause  the
 fact and the date of such mailing to be recorded next to the name of the
 voter  in  the register of the village or appropriate election district.
 If the inspectors of election shall determine that such elector  is  not
 entitled  to an absentee voter's ballot, or if they shall determine that
 such elector is no longer entitled to receive such ballot without appli-
 cation they shall notify such elector in writing giving [him] SUCH ELEC-
 TOR the reason for such rejection or decision.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
