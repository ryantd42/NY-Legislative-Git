  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 9, 2024, as P.S. I  Love  You  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious mental
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 9, 2024, as  P.S.
I Love You Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  P.S.  I  Love  You  Day,  this  year  celebrating its 14th
Anniversary, is held annually on the second Friday of February  in  over
100 communities across New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  P.S.  I  Love  You  Day  was initiated in 2010 by founders
Jaimie and Brooke DiPalma, along with their family and  the  West  Islip
High  School  Class of 2014, to celebrate the memory of their father and
anyone in the State of New York who has been lost to suicide; they  used
the  last  three  words  their father said to them, "I Love You," as the
inspiration for this significant day; and
 
  WHEREAS, An active member of his community, Joseph DiPalma, Jr.  was
a  former  NYPD officer, ex-Chief of the West Islip Fire Department, and
President of his Local Chamber of Commerce; tragically, he  passed  away
on April 23, 2010; and
 
  WHEREAS,  P.S. I Love You Day invites all New Yorkers to wear purple
on February 9, 2024, to bring awareness  to  the  importance  of  mental
health, to stand up to bullying, and to spread kindness; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater awareness of serious
mental  health conditions, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 9, 2024, as P.S.
I Love You Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and founders, Jaimie and Brooke DiPalma.
