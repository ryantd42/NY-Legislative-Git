  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Youth Art Month in the State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
programs and individuals who devote themselves to the welfare  of  young
people and their futures; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2023, as Youth Art Month in  the
State  of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National Youth
Art Month; this year's theme is "Your Art, Your Voice"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Youth Art Month is  an  annual  observance  each  March  to
emphasize the value of art education for all children, encourage support
for quality school art programs, and promote art material safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Created  in  1961  by  the  Art  and  Creative  Materials
Institute, Youth Art Month is a nonprofit association of art  and  craft
materials  manufacturers, in cooperation with the National Art Education
Association; and
 
  WHEREAS, Art education contributes viable education benefits to  all
elementary  and  secondary  students  including:  developing  students'
creative problem-solving and critical abilities; teaching sensitivity to
beauty, order, and other expressive qualities; providing students with a
stronger  understanding  of  multicultural  values  and  beliefs;  and
interrelating  student  learning  in  art  production,  art history, art
criticism, and aesthetics; and
 
  WHEREAS, To promote Youth Art Month, the Council for Arts  Education
coordinates  Youth  Art  Month  activities  at  the  national level; the
primary way to participate in New York State  is  the  Youth  Art  Month
Flagship  Event,  which  features  the  New  York  State  Art  Teachers
Association (NYSATA) Legislative Exhibit, co-sponsored by New York State
United Teachers (NYSUT), and NYSATA's largest public display of  student
artwork  in  a  government  building;  founded in 1990, this student art
exhibit is held in  the  Legislative  Office  Building  in  Albany  each
spring,  providing  an  exciting  opportunity  for  students  and  their
families to connect with their legislators; and
 
  WHEREAS, Youth Art chairs also  create  digital  scrapbook  reports,
documenting local observances, events, exhibits, proclamations, funding,
and  community  support;  these reports are submitted to the Council for
Art Education, and  several  programs  are  recognized  for  outstanding
achievement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  benefits  of art education form the basis of "World
Class Standards" developed by the United States Department of  Education
and the National Endowment for the Arts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body recognizes the importance of art in
education as being necessary  for  full  development  of  all  children,
challenging  the  intellect  while  teaching  lessons  about proportion,
composition, and creativity; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2023, as  Youth  Art
Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and the New York State Art Teachers Association.
