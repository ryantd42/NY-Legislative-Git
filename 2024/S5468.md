 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to  review of  poli-
  cies and practices relating to infectious disease outbreaks in correc-

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 26 of section 206 of the public health law,  as
 separately  amended  by  chapters  45  and  322  of the laws of 2021, is
 amended to read as follows:
  26. The commissioner is hereby authorized and directed to  review  any
 policy  or  practice instituted in facilities operated by the department
 of corrections and community supervision, and in all local  correctional
 facilities,  as  defined  in  subdivision  sixteen of section two of the
 correction law, regarding human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV),  acquired
 immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis C (HCV), [and] COVID-19, AND
 EMERGING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASES,  including  the prevention of the trans-
 mission of and the treatment  of  such  infections  and  diseases  among
 incarcerated  individuals. Such review shall be performed at least annu-
 ally, and shall focus on whether such policy or practice  is  consistent
 with  current,  generally accepted medical standards and procedures used
 to prevent the  transmission  of  and  to  treat  those  infections  and
 diseases  among the general public. In performing such reviews, in order
 to determine the quality and adequacy of care  and  treatment  provided,
 department personnel are authorized to enter correctional facilities and
 inspect  policy  and  procedure manuals and medical protocols, interview
 health services providers and incarcerated  individual-patients,  review
 medical  grievances,  and  inspect  a  representative  sample of medical
 records of incarcerated individuals known to be infected with  any  such
 infections  or  diseases. Prior to initiating a review of a correctional
 system, the commissioner shall inform the  public,  including  patients,

 their families and patient advocates, of the scheduled review and invite
 them  to  provide  the  commissioner with relevant information. Upon the
 completion of such review, the department  shall,  in  writing,  approve
 such  policy  or  practice  as  instituted in facilities operated by the
 department of corrections and community supervision, and  in  any  local
 correctional  facility,  or, based on specific, written recommendations,
 direct the department of corrections and community supervision,  or  the
 authority  responsible for the provision of medical care to incarcerated
 individuals in local correctional facilities to prepare and implement  a
 corrective  plan  to  address deficiencies in areas where such policy or
 practice fails to conform to current, generally accepted medical  stand-
 ards  and procedures.  The commissioner shall monitor the implementation
 of such corrective plans and shall conduct such further reviews  as  the
 commissioner  deems  necessary to ensure that identified deficiencies in
 those policies and practices are corrected. All written reports pertain-
 ing to reviews provided for in this  subdivision  shall  be  maintained,
 under  such  conditions  as  the commissioner shall prescribe, as public
 information available for public inspection.  AS USED IN  THIS  SUBDIVI-
 SION,  "EMERGING  INFECTIOUS  DISEASE"  MEANS  AN  INFECTION  THAT  HAD
 INCREASED RECENTLY OR IS THREATENING TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
