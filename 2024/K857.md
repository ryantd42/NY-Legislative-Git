Assembly Resolution No. 857
 
BY: M. of A. Palmesano
 
  COMMEMORATING  the 75th Anniversary of the Watkins
  Glen Area Chamber of Commerce
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the communities  across  the  great
State of New York is reflective of certain exemplary organizations whose
purpose  is  dedicated  to  serving  the  community and the needs of its
citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Watkins  Glen  Area  Chamber  of
Commerce  on Saturday, March 2, 2024, to be celebrated at a Diamond Gala
at the Watkins Glen Harbor Hotel; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its founding 75 years  ago,  the  Watkins  Glen  Area
Chamber  of  Commerce has spoken to the needs of the business community,
creatively promoting and advocating for business in the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to its role as  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  for
Watkins  Glen and Schuyler County area, it is also the Tourism Promotion
Agent, operating two visitor centers in Watkins Glen that  welcome  more
than 100,000 visitors each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Watkins  Glen  Area  Chamber of Commerce has over 400
members,  with  many  businesses  fueling  tourism  in  the  area;  the
international  auto  racing  facility and the Finger Lakes wine industry
being perhaps the most notable economic engines in the region; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the late 1940s, Cameron Argetsinger, a  law  student  at
Cornell  University,  proposed  an  amateur  road race, the Watkins Glen
Grand Prix, and reached out to the then newly-formed Watkins  Glen  Area
Chamber  with  the idea of a road race in Watkins Glen to bring tourists
to the area; this eventually led to Watkins  Glen  International,  which
now hosts NASCAR, and an array of other motorsports competitions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  it honors its history, the Chamber looks to the future
with  a  vision  of  advancing  the  Watkins  Glen  area  as  a  premier
destination  that  intertwines  its  unique  scenic beauty with economic
diversity and prosperity; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Watkins Glen Area Chamber of Commerce is
in  direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its  dedicated  Board  of
Directors,  staff,  and volunteers, whose involvement is, and always has
been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud and distinguished history,  the  Watkins
Glen  Area  Chamber  of  Commerce  may take just pride in its purposeful
growth, as it  looks  forward  to  continuing  to  serve  the  business,
cultural, and intellectual needs of the community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Watkins  Glen  Area  Chamber  of
Commerce; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Watkins Glen Area Chamber of Commerce.
