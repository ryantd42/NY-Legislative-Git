  COMMENDING  the Brooklyn Chapter of the NAACP upon
  the  occasion  of  hosting  its  2024  Spring  Fling
  Membership Soiree on June 1, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  enduring  organizations  which  devote  their
purposeful  energies  to  improving  the  quality and dignity of life of
those they serve, to preserving their heritage, and to  fostering  pride
among them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Brooklyn Chapter of the NAACP upon the occasion of hosting
its 2024 Spring Fling Membership Soiree on Saturday, June  1,  2024,  at
the Major R. Owens Health and Wellness Center in Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first  meeting  of  the  Branch, held at the Brooklyn
Academy of  Music  in  December  1920,  was  an  anti-lynching  meeting;
attending  that  first  meeting  were  Congressman  Leonidas  C. Dyer of
Missouri, who introduced the Anti-Lynching Bill in Congress, as well  as
Senator  Joseph  Frank  of  Maryland,  an  unwavering  anti-lynching
campaigner; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the years, the Brooklyn Branch of the NAACP has gained
a reputation as one of the  largest,  most  effective,  and  influential
branches  of  the  NAACP; it was chartered in 1922, and at its peak, the
branch boasted a membership of some 10,000 people; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its reorganization in  June  of  2005,  the  Brooklyn
Branch  of  the  NAACP has emerged with a young and committed leadership
determined to  build  on  the  branch's  rich  legacy  of  activism  and
defending the social, economic, political, and legal rights of people of
color; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The NAACP's Spring Membership Soiree is both a celebration
and a call to action for people who uphold the NAACP's mission to ensure
the  political,  educational,  social,  and  economic  equality  of  all
citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Brooklyn  Branch  and  the  NAACP  as a whole work to
achieve equality of rights and  eliminate  racial  prejudice  among  the
citizens  of  the  United  States,  remove  all  barriers  of  racial
discrimination  through  democratic  processes,  seek  enactment  and
enforcement  of  federal,  state,  and local laws securing civil rights,
inform the public of the adverse effects of racial discrimination and to
seek its elimination, and to educate persons as to their  constitutional
rights and to take all lawful action to secure the exercise thereof, and
to  take any other lawful action in furtherance of these objectives true
to their heart; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
 
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Brooklyn Chapter of the NAACP upon the occasion  of  hosting
its  2024  Spring  Fling  Membership  Soiree  on June 1, 2024; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Brooklyn Chapter of the NAACP.
