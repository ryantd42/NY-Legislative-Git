  §  2.  Section  203  of  the  workers' compensation law, as amended by
 section 3 of part SS of chapter 54 of the laws of 2016,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  § 203.  Employees eligible for benefits under section two hundred four
 of  this article.  1. Employees in employment of a covered employer for
 four or more consecutive weeks and employees in  employment  during  the
 work  period usual to and available during such four or more consecutive
 weeks in any trade or business in which they are regularly employed  and
 in  which  hiring from day to day of such employees is the usual employ-
 ment practice shall be eligible for disability benefits as  provided  in
 section  two  hundred four of this article. Employees in employment of a
 covered employer for twenty-six or more consecutive weeks and  employees
 in  employment during the work period usual to and available during such
 twenty-six or more consecutive weeks in any trade or business  in  which
 they  are regularly employed and in which hiring from day to day of such
 employees is the usual employment practice shall be eligible for  family
 leave  benefits as provided in section two hundred four of this article.
 Every such employee shall continue to be eligible for family leave bene-
 fits only during employment with a covered employer. Every such employee
 shall continue to  be  eligible  for  disability  benefits  during  such
 employment  and  for a period of four weeks after such employment termi-
 nates regardless of whether the employee performs any work for remunera-
 tion or profit in non-covered employment. If during such four week peri-
 od the employee performs any work for remuneration or profit for another
 covered employer the employee shall become eligible for disability bene-
 fits immediately with respect to that employment. In addition every such
 employee who has previously completed four or more consecutive weeks  in
 employment  with  the  covered employer for purposes of disability bene-
 fits, or twenty-six or more consecutive weeks  in  employment  with  the
 covered  employer for purposes of paid family leave, and returns to work
 with the same employer after an agreed and  specified  unpaid  leave  of
 absence or vacation without pay shall become eligible for benefits imme-
 diately with respect to such employment. An employee who during a period
 in which he or she is eligible to receive benefits under subdivision two
 of  section two hundred seven of this article returns to employment with
 a covered employer and an employee who is currently receiving  unemploy-
 ment  insurance  benefits or benefits under section two hundred seven of
 this article and who returns to employment with a covered employer shall
 become eligible for disability benefits immediately with respect to such
 employment. An employee regularly in the employment of a single employer
 on a work schedule less than  the  employer's  normal  work  week  shall
 become eligible for disability leave benefits on the twenty-fifth day of
 such regular employment and for purposes of paid family leave an employ-
 er  shall  become eligible for benefits on the one hundred seventy-fifth
 day of such regular employment. An employee who is eligible for disabil-
 ity and family leave benefits in the employment of  a  covered  employer
 shall  not  be  deemed,  for  the purposes of this article, to have such
 employment terminated during any period he or she is eligible to receive
 benefits under section two hundred four of this article with respect  to
 such employment.
