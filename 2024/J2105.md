  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  10th Anniversary of InclusiveU of Syracuse University;
and
 
  WHEREAS, InclusiveU  calls  the  Lawrence  B.  Taishoff  Center  for
Inclusive  Higher  Education  its home at Syracuse University, a leading

and  inclusion  for  individuals  with  intellectual  and  developmental
disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, InclusiveU brings students of all  ages  with  intellectual

fully inclusive setting to Syracuse University; the organization  offers
meaningful  and  impactful opportunities for our students to participate

  WHEREAS, InclusiveU has 100 enrolled students, making it the largest
inclusive campus in the country; about forty of these students  live  in

the U.S. Department of Education in 2018; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2020, InclusiveU and the Lawrence B. Taishoff Center for
Inclusive  Higher  Education helped to establish the Syracuse University
Center on Disability and Inclusion,  which  undoubtedly  has,  and  will
continue  to  have,  an  immeasurable  positive  impact  on the lives of
individual students and the campus community as a  whole  for  years  to
come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  so effectively carrying out its mission, InclusiveU of
Syracuse University has demonstrated the value  of  providing  equitable
and  inclusive  opportunities  to  people  with  intellectual  and
developmental  disabilities,  which,  in  turn,  enriches  the  social,
cultural,  moral,  and  economic  state  of New York and the Nation as a

  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
