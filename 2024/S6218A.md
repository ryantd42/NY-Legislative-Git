## Summary

Enacts "the planned offshore wind transmission act"; requires the New York state energy and research development authority to establish a plan for improved transmission planning and coordinating systems for an offshore grid; requires the authority conduct a benefit-cost-analysis and ratepayer impact study to determine the overall costs of implementing planned transmission and coordinated systems for an offshore grid.

 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to enacting "the
  planned offshore wind transmission act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 "the planned offshore wind transmission act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. In 2019, the Climate Leadership and Community
 Protection Act was signed into law, requiring that New York reduce econ-
 omy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030
 and  by  no  less than 85 percent by 2050. In addition, the law requires
 9,000 megawatt (MW) of offshore wind  development  by  2035.  In  antic-
 ipation  that  the  state's  mandated  offshore wind goal will increase,
 improved planning and coordination is needed to reduce costs  and  mini-
 mize  community  and environmental impacts of offshore wind expansion in
 New York state. In addition, a more cohesive approach is needed  now  to
 build  on the momentum of the Inflation Reduction Act and other once-in-
 a-generation measures to start the build-out of a lower-cost,  lower-im-
 pact offshore wind transmission system.
  Independent,  shared  transmission  will  minimize  seabed cabling and
 shore crossings, reduce overall costs and  impacts  to  ratepayers,  and
 build an ocean grid that complements the resiliency of the onshore grid.
 This  planned  approach is already happening in Europe, and it is imper-
 ative that New York follows  suit.  Standards  must  be  established  to
 ensure  that  offshore  wind  transmission systems can connect with each
 other to operate in a network.
  § 3. The public authorities law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 1885 to read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 6218  2
 
  §  1885. THE PLANNED OFFSHORE WIND TRANSMISSION ACT. 1. THE AUTHORITY,
 IN CONSULTATION WITH THE  NEW  YORK  INDEPENDENT  SYSTEM  OPERATOR,  THE
 DEPARTMENT  OF  PUBLIC  SERVICE,  AND  OTHER RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES AND
 AUTHORITIES, SHALL, UPON THE EXPANSION  OF  THE  STATE'S  OFFSHORE  WIND
 MEGAWATT  (MW) GOAL ABOVE THE CURRENT NINE THOUSAND MW, ESTABLISH A PLAN
 FOR IMPROVED TRANSMISSION  PLANNING  AND  COORDINATION  SYSTEMS  FOR  AN
 OFFSHORE GRID.
  2.  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL  OVERSEE PROCUREMENTS FOR INDEPENDENT TRANS-
 MISSION SYSTEMS TO INTEGRATE THE NEXT ROUND OF  OFFSHORE  WIND  PROJECTS
 AND  INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PLAN, ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SUBDI-
 VISION ONE OF THIS SECTION, TO:
  A. PRIORITIZE COMMUNITY PROTECTION BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE;
  B. MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM;
  C. MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES; AND
  D. STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR THE PLANNED TRANSMISSION PROCESS.
  3. THE AUTHORITY, IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHER RELEVANT  STATE  AGENCIES
 AND  AUTHORITIES,  SHALL  CONDUCT  A BENEFIT-COST-ANALYSIS AND RATEPAYER
 IMPACT STUDY TO DETERMINE THE  OVERALL  COSTS  OF  IMPLEMENTING  PLANNED
 TRANSMISSION AND COORDINATED SYSTEMS FOR AN OFFSHORE GRID.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
