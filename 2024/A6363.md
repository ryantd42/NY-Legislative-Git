 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "child custody reform act".
  §  2.  Declaration  of  purposes.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares that it is in the best interests of a child whose  parents  are
 in dispute over his or her custody that:
  Parents resolve their dispute as expeditiously as possible in a child-
 centered manner;
  Parents  be  encouraged to recognize the continuing interest that each
 has in the welfare of their child and resolve any differences  they  may
 have  concerning  custody, parenting and child support obligations prior
 to engaging in the adversarial process;
  Courts undertake an active role in promoting parental  settlements  in
 custody,  parenting and child support disputes, and in educating parents
 about the needs of their child resulting from divorce or separation;
  The child centered mediation process, in suitable cases, is an  appro-
 priate  way  to  help parents resolve child custody, parenting and child
 support disputes;
  Mediation of custody, parenting and child support disputes  should  be
 conducted  in  collaboration  with the courts, in a safe environment, by
 well-trained, experienced mediators during which the parents attempt  to
 plan cooperatively for the welfare of their child; and
  Uniform  statewide  standards  for  mediation  should be formulated in
 order to ensure the safety, quality  and  usefulness  of  the  mediation
 process to the court as well as to the parents, and to assure compliance
