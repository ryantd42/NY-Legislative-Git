  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 6, 2023, as Missing Persons Day in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to create public
awareness concerning the  devastation  occurring  as  a  result  of  the
unexplained disappearances of loved ones; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 6, 2023, as Missing
Persons Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wednesday, April 6, 2023, is the  observance  of  the  45th
birthday of Suzanne Gloria Lyall, a University at Albany student who has
been  missing  since  1998; this year, March 2, 2023, will mark the 25th
Anniversary of when she disappeared; and
 
  WHEREAS, A bright, creative and talented computer  science  student,
Suzanne  G.  Lyall  touched  countless  lives  with  her poetry, radiant
personality and cheerful, infectious smile; and
 
  WHEREAS, The youngest of the three children of  Mary  and  the  late
Doug Lyall, Suzanne of Ballston Spa, New York, disappeared at the age of
19 in the prime of her life, while preparing for a brilliant future; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1999, legislation was enacted that required all colleges
to  adopt plans for the investigation of reports of missing students and
of violent felony offenses occurring  on  their  campuses,  and  further
required  that  such plans include agreements with local police agencies
for coordination of these investigations; the legislation also  required
the Division of Criminal Justice Services to operate a toll free 24-hour
telephone  number  that  members  of  the  public  may  call  to  obtain
information as to resources available to the public  to  assist  in  the
location and recovery of missing persons; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2000,  New  York  State  passed  legislation  known as
"Suzanne's Law," which provides  for  increased  penalties  for  certain
crimes committed on school grounds; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The State of New York intends to make April 6, 2023, a day
of recognition of the need to further enhance efforts to locate  missing
persons  in New York, noting the missing persons epidemic in this State,
and the impact this epidemic has on the  families,  people  close  to  a
missing individual, and the community as a whole; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Several thousand people are labeled as missing in New York
State, many of whom are 18 years of age or older; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  we  should
attempt to bring comfort to the family members of missing persons in the
State  of  New  York  who  suffer  from  continuous grieving and who are
condemned to carry the burden of uncertainty as a result of not  knowing
 
the  true  circumstances  of  their  loved  one's  disappearance  or
whereabouts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  reaffirms  its ongoing crusade by
observing April 6, 2023, as Missing Persons Day  in  the  State  of  New
York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 6, 2023, as  Missing
Persons Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
