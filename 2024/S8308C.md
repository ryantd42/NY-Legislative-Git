  Section  1.  Section  1  of part I of chapter 413 of the laws of 1999,
 relating to providing for mass transportation payments,  as  amended  by
 section  1  of  part  E of chapter 58 of the laws of 2022, is amended to
 read as follows:
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or  regulation  to  the
 contrary,  payment  of mass transportation operating assistance pursuant
 to section 18-b of the  transportation  law  shall  be  subject  to  the
 provisions  contained  herein and the amounts made available therefor by
 appropriation.
  In establishing service and usage formulas for  distribution  of  mass
 transportation  operating assistance, the commissioner of transportation
 may combine and/or  take  into  consideration  those  formulas  used  to
 distribute  mass transportation operating assistance payments authorized
 by separate appropriations in order to facilitate program administration
 and to ensure an orderly distribution of such funds.
  To improve the predictability  in  the  level  of  funding  for  those
 systems  receiving operating assistance payments under service and usage
 formulas, the commissioner of  transportation  is  authorized  with  the
 approval  of  the  director  of  the budget, to provide service payments
 based on service and usage statistics of the preceding year.
  In the case of a service payment made, pursuant to section 18-b of the
 transportation law, to a regional transportation authority on account of
 mass transportation services provided to more than one county (consider-
 ing the city of New York to be one county), the respective shares of the
 matching payments required to be made by a county to any such  authority
 shall be as follows:

  Notwithstanding any other inconsistent provisions of section  18-b  of
 the transportation law or any other law, any moneys provided to a public
 benefit  corporation constituting a transportation authority or to other
 public transportation systems in payment of state  operating  assistance
 or  such  lesser amount as the authority or public transportation system
 shall make application for, shall be paid by the commissioner of  trans-
 portation to such authority or public transportation system in lieu, and
 in full satisfaction, of any amounts which the authority would otherwise
 be entitled to receive under section 18-b of the transportation law.
  Notwithstanding  the  reporting  date provision of section 17-a of the
 transportation law, the reports of each regional transportation authori-
 ty and other major public transportation systems receiving  mass  trans-
 portation  operating  assistance shall be submitted on or before July 15
 of each year in the format prescribed by the commissioner of transporta-
 tion. Copies of such reports shall also be filed with  the  chairpersons
 of  the senate finance committee and the assembly ways and means commit-
 tee and the director of the budget. The commissioner  of  transportation
 may withhold future state operating assistance payments to public trans-
 portation systems or private operators that do not provide such reports.
  Payments may be made in quarterly installments as provided in subdivi-
 sion 2 of section 18-b of the transportation law or in such other manner
 and  at such other times as the commissioner of transportation, with the
 approval of the director of the budget, may provide; and  where  payment
 is  not  made in the manner provided by such subdivision 2, the matching
 payments required of any city, county, Indian  tribe  or  intercity  bus
 company  shall  be made within 30 days of the payment of state operating
 assistance pursuant to this section or on such other  basis  as  may  be
 agreed  upon  by the commissioner of transportation, the director of the
 budget, and the chief executive officer of  such  city,  county,  Indian
 tribe or intercity bus company.
  The commissioner of transportation shall be required to annually eval-
 uate the operating and financial performance of each major public trans-
 portation  system. Where the commissioner's evaluation process has iden-
 tified a problem related to system  performance,  the  commissioner  may
 S. 8308--B  18
 
 request the system to develop plans to address the performance deficien-
 cies. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state oper-
 ating  assistance  payments  to public transportation systems or private
 operators that do not provide such operating, financial, or other infor-
 mation  as may be required by the commissioner to conduct the evaluation
 process.
  Payments shall be made contingent  upon  compliance  with  regulations
 deemed  necessary  and appropriate, as prescribed by the commissioner of
 transportation and approved by the director of the budget,  which  shall
 promote the economy, efficiency, utility, effectiveness, and coordinated
 service  delivery  of public transportation systems. The chief executive
 officer of each public transportation system receiving a  payment  shall
 certify  to  the commissioner of transportation, in addition to informa-
 tion required by section 18-b of  the  transportation  law,  such  other
 information  as  the  commissioner  of transportation shall determine is
 necessary to determine compliance and carry out the purposes herein.
  Counties, municipalities or Indian tribes  that  propose  to  allocate
 service payments to operators on a basis other than the amount earned by
 the  service  payment formula shall be required to describe the proposed
 method of distributing governmental operating  aid  and  submit  it  one
 month  prior  to  the start of the operator's fiscal year to the commis-
 sioner of transportation in writing for review and approval prior to the
 distribution of state aid. The commissioner of transportation shall only
 approve alternate distribution methods which  are  consistent  with  the
 transportation  needs  of  the  people  to be served and ensure that the
 system of private operators does not exceed established maximum  service
 payment  limits.  Copies  of  such  approvals  shall be submitted to the
 chairpersons of the senate finance and assembly ways and  means  commit-
 tees.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 18-b of the
 transportation  law, the commissioner of transportation is authorized to
 continue to use prior quarter statistics to  determine  current  quarter
 payment  amounts,  as initiated in the April to June quarter of 1981. In
 the event that actual revenue passengers  and  actual  total  number  of
 vehicle, nautical or car miles are not available for the preceding quar-
 ter,  estimated  statistics  may  be  used  as the basis of payment upon
 approval by the commissioner  of  transportation.  In  such  event,  the
 succeeding  payment  shall be adjusted to reflect the difference between
 the actual and estimated total number of revenue passengers and vehicle,
 nautical or car miles used as the basis of the  estimated  payment.  The
 chief executive officer may apply for less aid than the system is eligi-
 ble  to receive. Each quarterly payment shall be attributable to operat-
 ing expenses incurred during the quarter in which it is received, unless
 otherwise specified by such commissioner.  In the event  that  a  public
 transportation  system  ceases  to participate in the program, operating
 assistance due for the final quarter that service is provided  shall  be
 based  upon the actual total number of revenue passengers and the actual
 total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles carried during that quar-
 ter.
  Payments shall be contingent on  compliance  with  audit  requirements
 determined by the commissioner of transportation.
  In  the  event  that  an  audit  of  a public transportation system or
 private operator receiving funds discloses the existence of an  overpay-
 ment  of state operating assistance, regardless of whether such an over-
 payment results from an audit  of  revenue  passengers  and  the  actual
 number of revenue vehicle miles statistics, or an audit of private oper-
 S. 8308--B  19

 ators  in  cases  where more than a reasonable return based on equity or
 operating revenues and expenses has resulted, the commissioner of trans-
 portation, in addition to  recovering  the  amount  of  state  operating
 assistance  overpaid,  shall  also  recover  interest, as defined by the
 department of taxation and finance, on the amount of the overpayment.
  Notwithstanding any other law, rule or  regulation  to  the  contrary,
 whenever  the  commissioner  of  transportation is notified by the comp-
 troller that the amount  of  revenues  available  for  payment  from  an
 account is less than the total amount of money for which the public mass
 transportation  systems  are  eligible  pursuant  to  the  provisions of
 section 88-a of the state finance law and any appropriations enacted for
 these purposes, the commissioner of  transportation  shall  establish  a
 maximum payment limit which is proportionally lower than the amounts set
 forth in appropriations.
  Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) of subdivisions 5 and 7 of section 88-a
 of  the state finance law and any other general or special law, payments
 may be made in quarterly installments or in such  other  manner  and  at
 such  other  times  as  the  commissioner  of  transportation,  with the
 approval of the director of the budget may prescribe.

 vehicle  and  traffic  law,  paragraph  26  as added and paragraph 27 as
 amended by chapter 248 of the laws of  2014,  are  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  26.  (a) With respect to highways (which term for the purposes of this
 paragraph shall include private roads open to public motor vehicle traf-
 fic) in such city, other than state highways maintained by the state  on
 which  the department of transportation shall have established higher or
 lower speed limits than the statutory fifty-five miles  per  hour  speed
 limit as provided in section sixteen hundred twenty of this title, or on
 which  the  department of transportation shall have designated that such
 city shall not establish any maximum speed limit as provided in  section
 sixteen  hundred  twenty-four  of this title, subject to the limitations
 imposed by section sixteen hundred eighty-four of this title, establish-
 ment of maximum speed limits at which vehicles may proceed  within  such
 city  or  within  designated areas of such city higher or lower than the
 fifty-five miles per hour maximum statutory limit. [No] EXCEPT FOR HIGH-
 WAYS THAT CONSIST OF THREE OR MORE THROUGH  TRAVEL  LANES  IN  THE  SAME
 DIRECTION, NO such speed limit applicable throughout such city or within
 designated  areas  of such city shall be established at less than [twen-
 ty-five] TWENTY miles per hour, [except] PROVIDED  THAT  THIS  EXCEPTION
 S. 8308--B  23
 
 SHALL  NOT  APPLY  IN  A  COUNTY  WITH  A POPULATION OF NO LESS THAN ONE
 MILLION SIX HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR THOUSAND AND NO MORE  THAN  ONE  MILLION
 SIX HUNDRED NINETY-FIVE THOUSAND AS OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY DECENNIAL
 CENSUS,  AND  PROVIDED,  FURTHER, that school speed limits may be estab-
 lished at no less than fifteen miles per hour pursuant to the provisions
 of section sixteen hundred forty-three of this article.
  (b) A city shall not lower OR RAISE a speed limit [by more  than  five
 miles  per  hour]  pursuant  to this paragraph unless such city provides
 written notice and an opportunity to comment to the community  board  or
 community boards established pursuant to section twenty-eight hundred of
 the  New  York city charter with jurisdiction over the area in which the
 lower OR HIGHER speed limit shall apply. Such notice may be provided  by
 electronic mail and shall be provided sixty days prior to the establish-
 ment of such lower OR HIGHER speed limit.
  27.  (a)  Establishment  of  maximum  speed limits below [twenty-five]
 TWENTY miles per hour at which motor vehicles may proceed  on  or  along
 designated  highways within such city for the explicit purpose of imple-
 menting traffic  calming  measures  as  such  term  is  defined  herein;
 provided,  however, that no speed limit shall be set below [fifteen] TEN
 miles per hour nor shall such speed limit be established where the traf-
 fic calming measure to be  implemented  consists  solely  of  a  traffic
 control sign.  Establishment of such a speed limit shall, where applica-
 ble,  be  in  compliance with the provisions of sections sixteen hundred
 twenty-four and sixteen hundred eighty-four  of  this  [chapter]  TITLE.
 Nothing  contained  herein shall be deemed to alter or affect the estab-
 lishment of school speed limits pursuant to the  provisions  of  section
 sixteen  hundred  forty-three  of this article. For the purposes of this
 paragraph, "traffic calming measures" shall mean any physical  engineer-
 ing  measure or measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehi-
 cle use, alter driver behavior and improve conditions for  non-motorized
 street users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.
  (b)  Any  city  establishing  maximum speed limits below [twenty-five]
 TWENTY miles per hour pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph  shall
 submit  a  report to the governor, the temporary president of the senate
 and the speaker of the assembly on or before March first,  two  thousand
 fifteen  and biannually thereafter on the results of using traffic calm-
 ing measures and speed limits lower than [twenty-five] TWENTY miles  per
 hour  as  authorized  by  this paragraph. This report shall also be made
 available to the public by such city on its website. Such  report  shall
 include, but not be limited to the following:
  (i)  a  description  of  the designated highways where traffic calming
 measures and a lower speed limit were established [and];
  (ii) a description of the specific traffic calming measures  used  and
 the maximum speed limit established [and];
  (iii)  AN  EXPLANATION  OF THE REASONS FOR SETTING LOWER SPEED LIMITS,
 HOW THOSE LOWER SPEED LIMITS COMPLY WITH ENGINEERING STANDARDS, AND  HOW
 THEY  WILL  ENSURE  THAT  MOTOR VEHICLES CAN OPERATE AT SAFE SPEEDS IN A
 MANNER THAT OPTIMIZES ALL ROAD USERS' SAFETY AND CONVENIENCE; AND
  (IV) a comparison of the aggregate type, number, and severity of acci-
 dents reported on streets on which street  calming  measures  and  lower
 speed  limits  were implemented in the year preceding the implementation
 of such measures and policies and the year following the  implementation
 of  such  measures and policies, to the extent this information is main-
 tained by any agency of the state or the city.

 agent OF SUCH COMMISSIONER  to  immediately  secure  possession  of  the

 has  been  to evade the purposes of this paragraph and where the commis-
 sioner of motor vehicles has reasonable grounds  to  believe  that  such
 registration  or  renewal will have the effect of defeating the purposes
 of this paragraph. The procedure on any such  suspension  shall  be  the
 same  as  in the case of a suspension under the vehicle and traffic law.
 Operation of such motor vehicle while under suspension  as  provided  in
 this  subdivision shall constitute a class A misdemeanor. OPERATING SUCH
 MOTOR VEHICLE WHILE UNDER SUSPENSION AS  PROVIDED  IN  THIS  SUBDIVISION

  PART P
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "NY Home Energy Affordable Transition Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares that:
  1. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act  (the  "CLCPA")
 created  legal  mandates for dramatic greenhouse gas emission reductions
 from all sectors of New York's economy. The CLCPA also emphasizes equity
 in addressing climate change by requiring all state agencies and author-
 ities to prioritize reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollu-
 tants in disadvantaged communities and by mandating that  certain  state
 investments deliver benefits to these communities.
  2.  Buildings  are  New  York's largest source of greenhouse gas emis-
 sions, accounting for approximately  one-third  of  the  greenhouse  gas
 emissions  in  our  state.  New York state's buildings also produce more
 local air pollution than any other state in the  country,  resulting  in
 negative health outcomes such as increased rates of asthma, particularly
 among  children,  and  heart disease. Therefore, reducing greenhouse gas
 emissions and toxic air pollution emitted  from  New  York's  buildings,
 especially  in disadvantaged communities, is necessary to meet the CLCPA
 mandates.
 S. 8308--B  56
 
  3. To meet the state's bold climate and equity mandates, New York will
 need to update how it regulates  gas  utility  service.  Doing  so  will
 enable strategic planning and investments in neighborhood-scale building
 decarbonization  and  help  bring  the statewide gas distribution system
 into  alignment  with  the  two  thousand  thirty and two thousand fifty
 greenhouse gas emission reduction  mandates  in  the  CLCPA  through  an
 orderly  and equitable process, coordinated with appropriate investments
 in the electric system to ensure all New Yorkers have  non-discriminato-
 ry,  affordable  access  to  the energy needed for heating, cooling, and
 powering the buildings in which they live and work.
  4. The New York public service  law  not  only  contains  barriers  to
 neighborhood-scale  building  decarbonization  solutions such as thermal
 energy networks, but also works  at  cross  purposes  with  the  state's
 climate  and  affordability  goals,  by  requiring  and  subsidizing the
 continued expansion of natural gas infrastructure.
  a. The gas utility obligation to serve codified in the public  service
 law  is  a  major  obstacle  to  utilities developing neighborhood-scale
 building decarbonization projects that would facilitate bringing the gas
 system into alignment with the two  thousand  thirty  and  two  thousand
 fifty  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  mandates  in the CLCPA in a
 manner that can mitigate costs for all utility customers, reduces green-
 house gas emissions and co-pollutants impacting local air  quality,  and
 provides a transition for impacted workers.
  b.  Statutorily  mandated  utility system extension allowances require
 existing ratepayers to subsidize  gas  infrastructure  hookups  for  new
 customers.  According  to  a recent joint filing with the Public Service
 Commission by the New York state gas utilities,  these  required  allow-
 ances  cost  gas  utilities  hundreds  of  millions of dollars per year.
 These costs are passed directly to existing gas customers.
  c. Gas utilities in New York are on track to collectively  spend  $150
 billion  to  replace thousands of miles of leak prone pipe in the coming
 years. These investments pose a risk of becoming stranded  assets,  with
 $77  billion of the total cost coming due after 2050, but can be avoided
 in many cases by strategically investing in neighborhood-scale decarbon-
 ization projects.
  5. New Yorkers are suffering from dramatic fossil  fuel  price  spikes
 driven  by  the increasingly integrated global commodity market, subject
 to the whims of foreign dictators such as  Russia's  Vladimir  Putin  or
 Saudi  Arabia's  Prince  Mohammed  bin  Salman.  Fossil fuel prices have
 spiked to historic high levels, making both electricity and gas  utility
 service  unaffordable  for  many  New  Yorkers.  Decarbonizing buildings
 through the strategic development of neighborhood-scale building  decar-
 bonization  projects,  along  with  investing  in  energy efficiency and
 renewable electricity, will save  New  Yorkers  money  now  and  in  the
 future,  protect against price volatility, and promote true energy inde-
 pendence for New York state.
  6. Fossil fuel price spikes are exacerbating the affordability impacts
 of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Over a million  households  in  New  York  now
 struggle  to  pay their utility bills. The Public Service Commission has
 declared, but not yet achieved, a goal that  customers  should  not  pay
 more than 6% of their income for utility energy services, a number based
 on a nationally accepted standard.
  7.  Thus,  it  is  the  intent of the legislature to enact the NY Home
 Energy Affordable Transition Act for the following purposes:
  a. to ensure that the public  service  law  regarding  regulation  and
 oversight  of  gas  utilities  will provide for the timely and strategic
 S. 8308--B  57
 
 decarbonization and right-sizing of the gas  distribution  system  in  a
 just  and  affordable manner as required to meet the climate justice and
 emission reduction mandates of the CLCPA, appropriately balancing  rate-
 payers'  needs  and  interests with the maintenance of financially sound
 utilities, prioritizing low-to-moderate income customers  and  disadvan-
 taged communities, and encouraging neighborhood-scale transitions;
  b. to provide the Public Service Commission with the statutory author-
 ity  and  direction  to  align utility regulations and planning with the
 CLCPA climate justice and emission reduction mandates and to require the
 Public Service Commission to take a proactive role in the  timely  iden-
 tification  and  amendment of such regulations or rulings as may pose an
 impediment to achieving CLCPA mandates, and to identify  any  laws  that
 may pose an impediment;
  c.  to  maintain the affordability of services for all utility custom-
 ers, create good paying, family sustaining jobs, and facilitate achieve-
 ment of the CLCPA climate justice and  emission  reduction  mandates  by
 enabling  gas  utilities to minimize the need for new investments in gas
 infrastructure;
  d. to facilitate a well-planned and strategic downsizing  of  the  gas
 system  by  redirecting  ratepayer  funds  that would have been spent on
 costly new investments to maintain or expand the gas system  to  instead
 fund  job-creating  neighborhood-scale  decarbonization  projects  that
 provide alternative clean energy solutions for efficient heating,  cool-
 ing,  cooking,  hot  water,  and  other uses that effectively transition
 customers away from dependence on fuels with  greenhouse  gas  emissions
 and equipment that produces on-site co-pollutant emissions;
  e.  to  end  statutorily mandated, ratepayer-subsidized incentives for
 the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure while maintaining the  equi-
 table  provision  of  electric  service  for efficient heating, cooling,
 cooking, hot water, and other uses;
  f. to provide affordable access to electricity for heating and cooling
 and to protect  low-income  and  moderate-income  customers  from  undue
 burdens as they decarbonize their buildings; and
  g.  to  clarify that municipal building codes regulating on-site emis-
 sions are not preempted under New York state law.
  8. Transitioning gas customers  to  alternative  heating  and  cooling
 services  is  likely  to  be most cost-effective from the perspective of
 individual customers and New York state as a whole if undertaken as part
 of a neighborhood-scale  project.  Such  projects  would  help  minimize
 stranded  costs  in  gas  system  infrastructure and support coordinated
 investments on the part of customers, utilities, and others, potentially
 including but not limited to electrification make-ready measures, equip-
 ment located on the premises of customers, and thermal energy networks.
  9. This legislation does not establish a ban on the use of gas. It  is
 neither  the  intent  nor  would it be the effect of this legislation to
 require the immediate transition of existing gas customers  to  alterna-
 tive heating and cooling services.

 the laws of 1948, subdivision 1 as amended and subdivision 3 as added by
 chapter 582 of the laws of 1975, and subdivision 2 as amended by chapter
 722 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
  § 66-a. Conservation  of  gas,  declaration  of  policy, delegation of
 power.  1. It is hereby declared to be the policy  of  this  state  that
 when  there  develops  in  any area a situation under which a gas corpo-
 ration supplying gas to such area is unable to meet the reasonable needs
 of its consumers and of persons or  corporations  applying  for  new  or
 additional  gas  service, the available supply of gas shall be allocated
 among the customers of such gas corporation, in such manner  as  may  be
 necessary  to  protect public health and safety and to avoid undue hard-
 ship, PARTICULARLY FOR  LOW-TO-MODERATE  INCOME  RESIDENTIAL  CUSTOMERS,
 ELECTRIC  GENERATION NEEDED FOR ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY, AND CUSTOM-
 S. 8308--B  64
 
 ERS WITH HARD-TO-ELECTRIFY INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USES,  pursuant  to
 rules  and  regulations as may be adopted by the commission, and that to
 carry out this declared policy the jurisdiction of  the  public  service
 commission should be clarified.  IT IS FURTHER DECLARED TO BE THE POLICY
 OF THIS STATE THAT GAS SERVICE TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS MUST BE PROVIDED IN
 A MANNER THAT IS SAFE AND ADEQUATE, NOT UNJUSTLY DISCRIMINATORY OR UNDU-
 LY PREFERENTIAL, AND IN ALL RESPECTS JUST AND REASONABLE, SUBJECT TO THE
 PROVISIONS OF SECTION THIRTY OF THIS CHAPTER.
  2. Notwithstanding the provisions of any statute or any franchise held
 by  a gas corporation, the commission shall have power, upon the finding
 that CONTINUED GAS SERVICE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE
 CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN CHAPTER  ONE  HUNDRED
 SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND
 FUNCTION  AS  MAY  ARISE  FROM TIME TO TIME, OR THAT there exists such a
 shortage of gas in any area in  the  state,  that  the  gas  corporation
 supplying  such  area  is unable and will be unable to secure or produce
 sufficient gas to meet the reasonable needs  of  its  customers  and  of
 persons  or  corporations applying for new or additional gas service, to
 require such corporation to immediately discontinue the supplying of gas
 to additional customers or of supplying additional  service  to  present
 customers,  for  such  purpose  or  purposes as may be designated by the
 commission, or to customers using gas for a purpose  prohibited  by  the
 commission  pursuant  to  this  act,  and that upon the finding that the
 supply of gas available is  and  will  be  insufficient  to  supply  the
 demands  of  all consumers receiving service, to require such gas corpo-
 ration to curtail or discontinue  service  to  any  or  all  classes  of
 customers  of  such  gas  corporation.  In  imposing such a direction or
 requirement, the commission shall give consideration first  to  existing
 domestic  uses  and  uses  deemed  to  be necessary by the commission to
 protect public health and safety and to avoid undue hardship [and  shall
 be  limited  to the period of the emergency provided that the gas corpo-
 ration affected shall make such restriction,  curtailing  or  discontin-
 uance  applicable  to  all customers or applicants for service in a like
 class. If the commission determines that good cause exists for supplying
 service to additional customers or for supplying additional  service  to
 some  existing  customers, notwithstanding the curtailment or discontin-
 uance of service to other existing customers, it shall,  to  the  extent
 feasible, allocate gas with equal priority to new or additional domestic
 uses  of  gas  and  commercial or industrial processes which require gas
 because there is no practical substitute for it in  such  proportion  as
 the  commission  determines to be reasonable.  Provided that the commis-
 sion shall be permitted, after public hearing, to authorize any  natural
 gas  produced  from  lands  under the waters of Lake Erie to be used for
 process or feedstock requirements].  The  commission  is  authorized  to
 adopt such rules, regulations and orders as are necessary or appropriate
 to carry out these delegated powers.
  3.  In carrying out the delegated powers provided for in this section,
 the commission shall, to the extent practicable, determine and establish
 gas conservation measures or standards, INCLUDING ENERGY EFFICIENT ELEC-
 TRIFICATION OF GAS END USES. The commission may require compliance  with
 such measures or standards as a condition of receiving service.
  4.  THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NEW OR ADDI-
 TIONAL GAS SERVICE IS WARRANTED NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  NEED  TO  CONSERVE
 RESOURCES  FOR  SERVICE  TO EXISTING GAS CUSTOMERS.  SUCH DETERMINATION
 SHALL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND
 EMISSION  REDUCTION  MANDATES  IN CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF
 S. 8308--B  65

 TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN, AND SUCH SUCCESSORS IN LAW AND  FUNCTION  AS  MAY
 ARISE  FROM  TIME  TO  TIME, AND MAY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS INCLUDING
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IMPACTS ON NEW AND  EXISTING  CUSTOMERS  INCLUDING

  § 2. Subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of section 72-0303 of  the  environmental
 conservation law, subdivisions 1 and 3 as amended by section 1 of part D
 of chapter 413 of the laws of 1999, the opening paragraph of subdivision
 1  as  amended  by section 1 of part Y of chapter 58 of the laws of 2015
 and subdivision 2 as added by chapter 608  of  the  laws  of  1993,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  Commencing  January first, two thousand [fifteen] TWENTY-SEVEN and
 every year thereafter, all sources of regulated air contaminants identi-
 fied pursuant to subdivision one of  section  19-0311  of  this  chapter
 shall  submit to the department an annual base fee of [two] TEN thousand
 [five hundred] dollars PER FACILITY.  This base fee shall be in addition
 to the fees listed below.  Commencing January first,  [nineteen  hundred
 ninety-four]  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-SEVEN and every year thereafter, all
 sources of regulated air contaminants identified pursuant to subdivision
 one of section 19-0311 of this chapter shall submit to the department an
 annual fee not to exceed [the] TWO HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE  DOLLARS  per  ton
 [fees  described below. The per ton fee is assessed on each ton of emis-
 sions up to seven thousand tons annually of each regulated  air  contam-
 inant as follows:  sixty dollars per ton for facilities with total emis-
 sions  less than one thousand tons annually; seventy dollars per ton for
 facilities with total emissions of one thousand or more  but  less  than
 two  thousand  tons annually; eighty dollars per ton for facilities with
 total emissions of two thousand or more but less than five thousand tons
 annually; and ninety dollars per ton for facilities with total] OF emis-
 sions of [five thousand or more tons  annually]  REGULATED  AIR  CONTAM-
 INANTS.  Such [fee] FEES shall be sufficient to support an appropriation
 approved by the legislature for the direct and indirect costs associated
 with the operating permit program established in section 19-0311 of this
 S. 8308--B  74
 
 chapter.  Such  [fee]  FEES  shall  be established by the department and
 shall be calculated by dividing the amount of the current year appropri-
 ation from the operating permit program account of the clean air fund by
 the  total  tons  of  emissions of regulated air contaminants, INCLUDING
 HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS, that  are  subject  to  the  operating  permit
 program fees from sources subject to the operating permit program pursu-
 ant  to section 19-0311 of this chapter [up to seven thousand tons annu-
 ally of each regulated air contaminant from each source]; provided that,
 in making such calculation, the department  shall  adjust  their  calcu-
 lation  to  account  for  any deficit or surplus in the operating permit
 program account of the clean air fund established  pursuant  to  section
 ninety-seven-oo  of  the state finance law[; any loan repayment from the
 mobile source account of the clean  air  fund  established  pursuant  to
 section  ninety-seven-oo  of  the  state  finance  law;] and the rate of
 collection by the department of the bills issued for the [fee] FEES  for
 the prior year.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of the state administrative procedure
 act, such calculation and [fee] FEES shall be established as a  rule  by
 publication  in  the  Environmental Notice Bulletin no later than thirty
 days after the budget bills making appropriations  for  the  support  of
 government  are  enacted  or July first, whichever is later, of the year
 such [fee] FEES will be effective. In no  event  shall  the  [fee]  FEES
 established herein be any greater than the maximum fee identified pursu-
 ant to this section.
  2.  Bills  issued for the [fee] FEES ESTABLISHED BY SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 THIS SECTION shall be based on actual emissions for the  prior  calendar
 year,  as  demonstrated  to  the  department's  satisfaction,  or in the
 absence of such demonstration, on permitted emissions, or,  where  there
 is  no permit, on potential to emit. Persons required to submit an emis-
 sions statement to the department shall use  such  statement  to  demon-
 strate actual emissions under this section.
  3.  Effective  January  first,  [nineteen hundred ninety-seven through
 December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight] TWO THOUSAND TWEN-
 TY-SEVEN AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER, and notwithstanding the  requirements
 of  the  state  administrative  procedure  act,  the [cap of twenty-five
 dollars] per ton FEE ESTABLISHED BY  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION
 shall  increase  by  the percentage, if any, by which the consumer price
 index exceeds the consumer price index for the [calendar] PRIOR CALENDAR
 year [nineteen hundred eighty-nine].
  a. The consumer price index for any PRIOR calendar year is the average
 of the consumer price index for all urban  consumers  published  by  the
 United  States  department of labor, as of the close of the twelve-month
 period ending on August thirty-first of each calendar year.
  b. The [revision of the] DEPARTMENT SHALL USE THE MOST RECENT consumer
 price index [for the calendar year nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall be
 used in the event] PUBLISHED BY the department  of  labor  [revises  its
 method of determining the consumer price index].
  §  3.  Subdivision 7 of section 72-0303 of the environmental conserva-
 tion law is REPEALED.
  § 4. Subdivisions 8, 9 and 10 of section 72-0303 of the  environmental
 conservation law are renumbered subdivisions 7, 8 and 9.
  §  5.  Paragraph  c  of  subdivision  2  of section 97-oo of the state
 finance law, as added by chapter 608 of the laws of 1993, is REPEALED.

  PART JJ
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Consumer
 and Small business Protection Act (CSPA)".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The  Legislature  declares  that
 the  State  has  a  responsibility to protect individuals and businesses
 within the State from unfair and abusive business  acts  and  practices.
 The  Legislature  further  declares  that the State's law, which guarded
 only against deceptive business acts and practices,  has  been  insuffi-
 cient  to  meet  this responsibility and has become out of date as other
 states' laws provide far greater protections. Consumers and small  busi-
 nesses have long been vulnerable to unscrupulous business practices that
 are unfair and abusive without being expressly deceptive. The State must
 not  allow  bad actors to peddle predatory products and services as long
 as they are clever enough not to get caught in a lie. To that  end,  and
 to  better  level  the  playing  field for the State's many honest busi-
 nesses, this legislation defines unfair and abusive acts  and  practices
 expansively.
  The  State  must  also  ensure that this protection covers small busi-
 nesses, which are frequent targets of predatory loans and other forms of
 exploitation, along with all  consumer  transactions.  This  legislation
 therefore  rejects  the  limitation,  imposed by courts, that prohibited
 conduct be "consumer oriented," have an impact on the public  at  large,
 S. 8308--B  80
 
 or  be  part  of  a  broader pattern. Consumers and small businesses are
 entitled to redress whenever they are harmed by  deceptive,  unfair,  or
 abusive conduct.
  For  any  of these protections to be meaningful, the State must ensure
 that the remedies for prohibited conduct provide an effective deterrent.
 This legislation therefore updates the statutory damages for  violations
 for the first time in decades, from $50 to $1,000, and allows meaningful
 punitive  damages  for  particularly egregious behavior. The Legislature
 recognizes that unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices have a  partic-
 ular  impact on poor individuals, people of color, and those affected by
 natural disasters and health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandem-
 ic. For this reason, the State must ensure that  limited  resources  not
 prevent  individuals  and  small  businesses from seeking remedies. This
 legislation therefore opens access to  justice  by  making  recovery  of
 attorney's  fees  mandatory  for  a prevailing plaintiff and authorizing
 class actions.
  Lastly, the legislature also finds that  children  are  an  inherently
 vulnerable  population, and that marketing unhealthy foods in a targeted
 and persistent manner to this group is inconsistent  with  this  state's
 efforts  to curb the disastrous health outcomes that follow the overcon-
 sumption of these products. Such marketing is inherently misleading,  as
 children  often  lack  the  same  ability  to  resist the rewarding cues
 presented in unhealthy food marketing as adults. New York has  a  strong
 and substantial interest in protecting our children from negative health
 consequences.  Additionally,  the  power of the state is at its greatest
 when protecting the health and welfare of its citizens, especially those
 most vulnerable. Thus, the legislature finds that unfair  and  deceptive
 marketing  targeted at children can mislead and manipulate children into
 lifelong habits, and that such unfair and deceptive  advertising  should
 be regulated accordingly.
  §  3.  Section 349 of the general business law, as added by chapter 43
 of the laws of 1970, subdivision (h) as amended by chapter  157  of  the
 laws  of  1984,  and subdivision (j) as added by section 6 of part HH of
 chapter 55 of the laws of 2014, is amended to read as follows:
  § 349. [Deceptive acts] UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE, OR ABUSIVE ACTS  and  prac-
 tices unlawful. (a) [Deceptive] ANY UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE acts or
 practices  in  the  conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the
 furnishing of any service in this state are hereby declared unlawful.
  (1) FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, AN ACT  OR  PRACTICE  IS  UNFAIR
 WHEN  IT  CAUSES OR IS LIKELY TO CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL INJURY, THE INJURY IS
 NOT REASONABLY AVOIDABLE, AND THE INJURY IS NOT OUTWEIGHED  BY  COUNTER-
 VAILING BENEFITS.
  (2)  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, AN ACT OR PRACTICE IS DECEPTIVE

  (2)  The  amount  of  any  class  B  or class C assessment, except for
 assessments related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated  for

 ums  received  by  the  impaired or insolvent insurer on the policies or
 contracts covered by each account for the last calendar  year  preceding

 account  for  the three calendar years preceding the assessment bears to
 such premiums received on business in this state for such calendar years
 by all assessed member insurers.  CLASS  B  AND  CLASS  C  ASSESSMENTS
 AGAINST  MEMBER  INSURERS  FOR  THE  HEALTH  INSURANCE  ACCOUNT SHALL BE
 FURTHER REDUCED FOR NOT-FOR-PROFIT MEMBER INSURERS PURSUANT TO A METHOD-
 OLOGY INCLUDED IN THE PLAN OF OPERATION AND APPROVED BY THE  SUPERINTEN-
 DENT.  SUCH METHODOLOGY SHALL OFFSET THE ASSESSMENTS IMPOSED ON NOT-FOR-
 PROFIT  MEMBER INSURERS IN A MANNER THAT HAS AN EQUIVALENT IMPACT AS THE
 TAX CREDITS APPLICABLE TO MEMBER FOR-PROFIT INSURERS  PURSUANT  TO  THIS
 ARTICLE.

  Section  1.  Subdivisions  b  and c of section 5 of chapter 537 of the
 laws of 1976, relating to paid, free and  reduced  price  breakfast  for
 eligible  pupils in certain school districts, as amended by section 22-b
 of part A of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022,  are  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  b.  Notwithstanding  any  monetary  limitations with respect to school
 lunch programs contained in any law  or  regulation,  for  school  lunch
 meals  served in the school year commencing July 1, 2022 and each July 1
 thereafter, a school food authority shall be eligible for a  lunch  meal
 State  subsidy  of  AN ADDITIONAL twenty-five cents, which shall include
 any annual State subsidy received by such school  food  authority  under
 any  other  provision  of State law, for any school lunch meal served by
 such school food authority; provided  that  the  school  food  authority
 certifies  to  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and Markets through the
 application submitted pursuant to subdivision c  of  this  section  that
 such  food  authority has purchased at least thirty percent of its total
 cost of food products for its school lunch service program from New York
 state farmers, growers, producers or processors in the preceding  school
 year. COMMENCING JULY 1, 2024, AND EACH JULY 1 THEREAFTER, A SCHOOL FOOD
 AUTHORITY  SHALL  BE  ALLOWED  TO ATTRIBUTE MONEYS SPENT ON PURCHASES OF
 FOOD PRODUCTS FROM NEW YORK STATE FARMERS, GROWERS, PRODUCERS OR PROCES-
 SORS MADE FOR ITS SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM AND SCHOOL SNACK PROGRAMS  TO

 State  farmers, growers, producers or processors in the preceding school
 year. The application shall also include an attestation from the  school
 food  authority's  chief  operating  officer  that it purchased at least
 thirty percent of its total cost  of  food  products,  PERMITTED  TO  BE

 service program from New  York  State  farmers,  growers,  producers  or
 processors  in  the  preceding school year in order to meet the require-
 ments for this additional State subsidy. School food  authorities  shall
 be  required  to annually apply for this subsidy. After reviewing school
 food authorities' completed applications for an additional State subsidy
 pursuant to this section, the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Markets
 shall certify to the State Education Department the school food authori-
 ties  approved for such additional State subsidy and the State Education
 Department shall pay such additional State subsidy to such  school  food
 authorities.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART VV
 S. 8308--B  119
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Farebox Assistance to Relieve Essential Straphangers  Act"  or  the
 "FARES Act".
  §  2.  This act enacts into law major components of legislation neces-
 sary to implement the FARES Act.  Each  component  is  wholly  contained
 within  a Subpart identified as Subparts A through C. The effective date
 for each particular provision contained within such Subpart is set forth
 in the last section of  such  Subpart.  Any  provision  in  any  section
 contained within a Subpart, including the effective date of the Subpart,
 which  makes  a  reference  to  a  section  "of  this act", when used in
 connection with that particular component, shall be deemed to  mean  and
 refer  to the corresponding section of the Subpart in which it is found.
 Section four of this act sets forth the general effective date  of  this
 act.
 
  SUBPART A
 
  Section  1. Legislative findings. The New York state legislature finds
 that the City of New York's "Fair Fares" program, which provides reduced
 fares on New York City Transit Authority subways and buses for  individ-
 uals earning under one hundred twenty percent of the poverty level, is a
 tool  that  can help ensure that mass transit remains affordable for all
 New Yorkers. However, Fair Fares does not currently apply  to  intracity
 commuter  rail  trips  taken in the City, and the legislature finds that
 expanding this discount to include commuter rail could  provide  signif-
 icant  affordability  benefits for New Yorkers below or near the poverty
 level and improve the quality of life for many outer borough New Yorkers
 lacking easy access to subways.
  § 2. Section 1266 of the public authorities law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 16-a to read as follows:
  16-A.  (A) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW OR THE TERMS OF
 ANY CONTRACT, THE AUTHORITY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE CITY OF NEW  YORK,
 SHALL  EXPAND  THE  FAIR FARES NYC PROGRAM TO PERMIT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE
 ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM TO RECEIVE A FIFTY PERCENT  DISCOUNT  ON  TRIPS
 USING  THE LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD OR METRO-NORTH RAILROAD WITHIN THE CITY
 OF NEW YORK.
  (B) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, "FAIR FARES NYC  PROGRAM"  SHALL
 HAVE  THE SAME MEANING AND ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS AS SET FORTH IN CHAPTER
 TWELVE OF TITLE SIXTY-EIGHT OF THE RULES OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK,  WHICH
 PROVIDES A FIFTY PERCENT FARE DISCOUNT FOR DESIGNATED TRANSIT OPTIONS.
  (C)  ADDITIONALLY,  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL CONSULT WITH THE CITY OF NEW
 YORK IN CONDUCTING A PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE PUBLIC  AWARE-
 NESS AND EXPAND USAGE OF THE FAIR FARES NYC PROGRAM BY ELIGIBLE INDIVID-
 UALS.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
 
  SUBPART B
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The New York state legislature  finds
 that  the  Metropolitan  Transportation  Authority's "City Ticket" which
 provides reduced fares on commuter rail trips within New York City,  has
 been incredibly successful in promoting New Yorkers' use of the commuter
 rail  system, and has particularly helped the MTA fill seats during off-
 peak trips. City Ticket is an important  tool  for  ensuring  that  mass
 transit  remains  affordable  for  New Yorkers, as well as improving the
 S. 8308--B  120
 
 quality of life for many outer borough New Yorkers lacking  easy  access
 to  subways.  Additional analysis since City Ticket's implementation and
 expansion has found that providing a weekly ticket option, similar to  a
 previous  Atlantic  Ticket  option,  could  assist riders with financial
 planning, ensure greater access to transit,  and increase commuter  rail
 ridership.
  § 2. Section 1266 of the public authorities law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 16-b to read as follows:
  16-B.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW OR THE TERMS OF ANY
 CONTRACT,  THE AUTHORITY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD
 AND METRO-NORTH RAILROAD SHALL OFFER A WEEKLY TICKET AT A REDUCED  RATE,
 INCLUDING FREE TRANSFERS TO METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY SUBWAY
 AND BUS SERVICE, FOR TRIPS WITHIN THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
 
  SUBPART C
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The New York state legislature  finds
 that  the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority's reduced commuter rail
 fares for seniors and individuals with disabilities during off-peak  and
 evening  peak  hours  have  been  successful  in  promoting mass transit
 affordability and accessibility for some of the New Yorkers who rely  on
 the  public  transportation system the most. The state legislature addi-
 tionally finds that it has been nearly thirty-five years  since  passage
 of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act or "ADA". Finally, the state
 legislature finds that it is an appropriate time for  extending  morning
 peak fare discounts to seniors and individuals with disabilities, demon-
 strating  its  respect  and  appreciation for their contributions to the
 workforce and our communities.
  § 2. Section 1266 of the public authorities law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 16-c to read as follows:
  16-C.  (A) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW OR THE TERMS OF
 ANY CONTRACT, THE AUTHORITY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE LONG  ISLAND  RAIL
 ROAD  AND METRO-NORTH RAILROAD, SHALL IMPLEMENT A HALF FARE RATE PROGRAM
 FOR ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS DURING MORNING PEAK FARE  TIME  PERIODS  ACROSS
 THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY'S COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM.
  (B)  FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION, "ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS" SHALL
 INCLUDE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE SIXTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER, HAVE A DISA-
 BILITY, OR ARE MEDICARE RECIPIENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY  ELIGIBLE  FOR  THE
 AUTHORITY'S  HALF-FARE  PROGRAMS  ON  TRIPS  OTHER  THAN WEEKDAY MORNING
 INBOUND PEAK TRAINS.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
  § 3. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion,  section,  subpart  or  part  of this act shall be adjudged by any
 court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not
 affect,  impair,  or  invalidate  the  remainder  thereof,  but shall be
 confined in its operation to the clause, sentence,  paragraph,  subdivi-
 sion,  section, subpart or part thereof directly involved in the contro-
 versy in which such judgment shall have  been  rendered.  It  is  hereby
 declared  to  be  the intent of the legislature that this act would have
 been enacted even if such invalid provisions had not been included here-
 in.
 S. 8308--B  121
 
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately  provided,  however,  that
 the  applicable effective date of Subparts A through C of this act shall
 be as specifically set forth in the last section of such Subpart.

  PART WW
 
  Section  1.  Legislative intent. In 2019, New York enacted the Climate
 Leadership and Community Protection Act to reduce the state's volume  of
 greenhouse  gas  emissions by at least 85% as compared to 1990 levels by
 the year 2050.  According to the Climate Action  Council  Scoping  Plan,
 the  transportation  sector  is responsible for approximately 28% of New
 York's total greenhouse gas emissions. Statewide  conversion  of  public
 transit  bus  fleets  is  an important undertaking required to meet this
 emission reduction mandate.
  The legislature recognizes that such a conversion will  entail  fiscal
 obligations  on  the  part  of  transit systems and utility providers in
 order to purchase new buses, renovate  or  replace  bus  depots,  expand
 utility  infrastructure  and  generation  capacity,  and other necessary
 investments to ensure reliable delivery of zero-emission  bus  services.
 Furthermore,  the legislature recognizes that there are existing revenue
 sources which currently fund public transit that rely on the consumption
 of fossil fuels and which will diminish as  the  number  of  gas-powered
 cars decreases.
  It is the expectation of the legislature that there will be sufficient
 funding  to  support a statewide conversion of public transit bus fleets
 to zero-emission buses, including continued federal support such as what
 has been provided in the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infras-
 tructure Law, the Low or No Emission Vehicle Program, the  Diesel  Emis-
 sions  Reduction  Act,  and  other  federal funding programs, as well as
 state and miscellaneous funding such  as  the  New  York  Truck  Voucher
 Incentive Program and the Volkswagen Clean Air Act Civil Settlement.
  Additionally,  the  legislature  recognizes that current zero-emission
 bus technology is still developing, particularly with respect to  travel
 range,  cold  weather  performance,  and bus availability. Technological
 advances will continue accelerating leading up to and during the covered
 period for zero-emission bus fleet conversion.  Finally,  one  of  the
 greatest  harms  to local communities are localized emissions which have
 an acutely negative impact, particularly to disadvantaged communities as
 defined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.  There-
 fore  a  coordinated  statewide  effort  to  purchase,  manufacture, and
 utilize zero-emission buses and paratransit vehicles will  help  facili-
 tate  technological  advancement,  reduce overall costs, and help reduce
 harm to our local communities.

  PART XX
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "harmful algal bloom monitoring and prevention act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and declarations. The legislature finds that
 the  state  of  New York has a responsibility to maintain the health and
 safety of its abundant clean water resources, upon which  the  residents
 of  New  York state, as well as its many visitors, rely on for drinking,
 agriculture, tourism, recreation, and  their  livelihoods.  Because  the
 waters  of the state are under threat by harmful algal blooms, which are
 known to be toxic and even fatal to  humans,  pets,  and  wildlife,  the
 state has a responsibility to provide coordinated, statewide monitoring,
 evaluation,  prevention and mitigation, going beyond water body-specific
 data collection and isolated mitigation efforts.  While  the  causes  of
 harmful  algal  blooms  are  complex  and varied, with a coordinated and
 S. 8308--B  133
 
 standardized approach to monitoring and evaluation,  patterns  can  more
 readily  be  identified  to  isolate  the combination of relevant causes
 specific to different bodies of water across the state and determine the
 most effective targeted interventions. To address this threat, the state
 must  develop  and maintain a comprehensive state clearinghouse to bring
 together existing and new available statewide cross-sectional and longi-
 tudinal data and information on  harmful  algal  blooms,  potential  and
 known  causes,  best  practice  interventions,  expertise,  and  funding
 resources. This data and subsequent report  will  enable  the  state  to
 effectively  and efficiently administer a central grant program support-
 ing data-driven best practices in prevention and mitigation  of  harmful
 algal blooms.
  §  3.  The  environmental  conservation law is amended by adding a new
 section 15-0519 to read as follows:
 § 15-0519. HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM MONITORING AND PREVENTION PROGRAM.
  1. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING  TERMS

 served  upon the owner of the motor vehicle if the operator is not pres-
 ent, by affixing such notice to said vehicle  in  a  conspicuous  place.
 Whenever such notice is so affixed, in lieu of inserting the name of the
 person  charged  with  the violation in the space provided for the iden-
 tification of said person, the  words  "owner  of  the  vehicle  bearing
 license"  may  be  inserted  to be followed by the plate designation and

 ers, or could  with  reasonable  diligence  have  discovered,  that  the

 misrepresentation, or other misconduct, or the knowing alteration  of  a
 notice  of  parking  violation, by the person so charged or [his or her]
 SUCH PERSON'S agent, employee, or representative. Such notice shall  fix
 a  time  when  and  place where a hearing shall be held before a hearing
 examiner to determine whether or not  dismissal  of  a  charged  parking
 violation  shall be set aside. Such notice shall set forth the basis for
 setting aside the dismissal and advise the owner that failure to  appear

 sion of liability and shall result in the setting aside of the dismissal
