 empowered  by  law,  rule and regulation to serve such notices. The form
 and wording of the notice of violation shall be prescribed by the execu-
 tive director, and it may be the same as any other notice  of  violation
 or summons form already in use if said form meets the requirements here-
 of. The notice of violation may include provisions to record information
 which  will  facilitate  the identification and location of respondents,
 including but not limited to name, address, telephone numbers,  date  of
 birth,  social  security  number if otherwise permitted by law, place of
 employment or school, and name and address of parents or guardian  if  a
 minor.  Notices  of  violation  shall  be issued only to persons who are
 sixteen years of age or over, and shall  be  served  by  delivering  the
 notice  within  the  state  to  the  person to be served. A copy of each
 notice of violation served hereunder shall be filed and retained by said
 bureau, and shall be deemed a record kept  in  the  ordinary  course  of
 business, and, if sworn to or affirmed, shall be prima facie evidence of
 the  facts  contained  therein.  Said  notice of violation shall contain
 information advising the person charged of the manner and the time with-
 in which such person may either admit or deny the offense charged in the
 notice. Such notice of violation shall also contain a warning to  advise
 the  person  charged  that failure to plead in the manner and within the
 time stated in the notice may result in a  default  decision  and  order
 being  entered  against  such person, and the imposition of supplemental
 penalties as provided in subdivision five-a of  section  twelve  hundred
 four  OR  SUBDIVISION  FOUR  OF SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX of this
 chapter. A notice of violation shall not be deemed to  be  a  notice  of
 liability  issued  pursuant to section two thousand nine hundred eighty-
 five of this chapter.
  6. Defaults. Where a respondent has failed to plead  to  a  notice  of
 violation  or  to  a  notice of liability issued pursuant to section two
 thousand nine hundred  eighty-five  of  this  chapter  within  the  time
 allowed  by the rules of said bureau or has failed to appear on a desig-
 nated hearing date or a subsequent date following an  adjournment,  such
 failure  to  plead or appear shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be an
 admission of liability and shall be  grounds  for  rendering  a  default
 decision  and  order  imposing  a  penalty  in  such  amount  as  may be
 prescribed by the authority OR THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT AUTHORITY OR A
 SUBSIDIARY THEREOF.
  7. Hearings. a. (1) A  person  charged  with  a  transit  OR  RAILROAD
 infraction  returnable to the bureau or a person alleged to be liable in
 accordance with the provisions of  section  two  thousand  nine  hundred
 eighty-five  of  this  chapter  who  contests  such  allegation shall be
 advised of the date on or by which he or she must appear to  answer  the
 charge  at  a hearing.  Notification of such hearing date shall be given
 either in the notice of violation or in a form,  the  content  of  which
 shall  be prescribed by the executive director or in a manner prescribed
 in section two thousand nine hundred eighty-five of  this  chapter.  Any
 such  notification  shall contain a warning to advise the person charged
 that failure to appear on or by the date designated, or  any  subsequent
 rescheduled  or  adjourned  date,  shall  be deemed for all purposes, an
 S. 8308--A  9  A. 8808--A
 
 admission of liability, and that a default judgment may be rendered  and
 penalties may be imposed.  Where notification is given in a manner other
 than in the notice of violation, the bureau shall deliver such notice to
 the  person  charged,  either  personally  or by registered or certified
 mail.
  (2) Whenever a person charged with a transit OR RAILROAD infraction or
 alleged to be liable in accordance with the provisions  of  section  two
 thousand  nine  hundred  eighty-five  of  this chapter returnable to the
 bureau requests an alternate hearing date and is not then in default  as
 defined in subdivision six of this section, the bureau shall advise such
 person  personally, or by registered or certified mail, of the alternate
 hearing date on or by which he or she must appear to answer  the  charge
 or allegation at a hearing. The form and content of such notice of hear-
 ing  shall  be prescribed by the executive director, and shall contain a
 warning to advise the person charged or alleged to be liable that  fail-
 ure  to  appear  on  or by the alternate designated hearing date, or any
 subsequent rescheduled or  adjourned  date,  shall  be  deemed  for  all
 purposes  an  admission of liability, and that a default judgment may be
 rendered and penalties may be imposed.
  (3) Whenever a person charged with a transit OR RAILROAD infraction or
 alleged to be liable in accordance with the provisions  of  section  two
 thousand  nine  hundred  eighty-five  of  this chapter returnable to the
 bureau appears at a hearing and obtains an adjournment  of  the  hearing
 pursuant to the rules of the bureau, the bureau shall advise such person
 personally, or by registered or certified mail, of the adjourned date on
 which  he  or  she  must  appear to answer the charge or allegation at a
 continued hearing. The form and content of such notice  of  a  continued
 hearing shall be prescribed by the executive director, and shall contain
 a  warning  to  advise  the  person charged or alleged to be liable that
 failure to appear on the adjourned hearing date shall be deemed for  all
 purposes  an  admission of liability, and that a default judgment may be
 rendered and penalties may be imposed.
  b. Every hearing for the adjudication of a  charge  of  a  transit  OR
 RAILROAD  infraction  or  an  allegation  of liability under section two
 thousand nine hundred eighty-five of this  chapter  hereunder  shall  be
 held  before  a  hearing  officer in accordance with the rules and regu-
 lations promulgated by the bureau.
  c. The hearing officer shall not be bound by the rules of evidence  in
 the conduct of the hearing, except rules relating to privileged communi-
 cations.
  d.  The  hearing  officer  may,  in  his  or her discretion, or at the
 request of the person charged or alleged to be liable on  a  showing  of
 good  cause  and need therefor, issue subpoenas to compel the appearance
 of any person to give testimony, and  issue  subpoenas  duces  tecum  to
 compel  the  production for examination or introduction into evidence of
 any book, paper or other thing relevant to the charges.
  e. In the case of a refusal to obey a subpoena, the  bureau  may  make
 application  to  the  supreme  court  pursuant  to  section twenty-three
 hundred eight of the civil practice law and rules, for an order  requir-
 ing such appearance, testimony or production of materials.
  f.  The  bureau  shall  make  and  maintain a sound recording or other
 record of every hearing.
  g. After due consideration of the evidence and arguments, the  hearing
 officer  shall  determine  whether  the charges or allegations have been
 established. No charge may be established except upon proof by clear and
 convincing evidence except allegations of civil liability for violations
 S. 8308--A  10  A. 8808--A
 
 of triborough bridge and tunnel authority rules and regulations will  be
 established  in  accordance  with the provisions of section two thousand
 nine hundred eighty-five of this chapter. Where  the  charges  have  not
 been  established,  an order dismissing the charges or allegations shall
 be entered. Where a determination is made that a  charge  or  allegation
 has  been established or if an answer admitting the charge or allegation
 has been received, the hearing officer shall set a penalty in accordance
 with the penalty schedule established by the authority OR THE  METROPOL-
 ITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, or for allegations of
 civil  liability  in accordance with the provisions of section two thou-
 sand nine hundred eighty-five of this chapter and an  appropriate  order
 shall  be  entered in the records of the bureau. The respondent shall be
 given notice of such entry in person or by certified  mail.  This  order
 shall constitute the final determination of the hearing officer, and for
 purposes  of  review  it shall be deemed to incorporate any intermediate
 determinations made by said officer in the  course  of  the  proceeding.
 When  no  appeal  is  filed  this  order shall be the final order of the
 bureau.
  10. Funds. All penalties collected pursuant to the provisions of  this
 section  shall be paid to the authority to the credit of a transit crime
 fund which the authority shall establish. Any sums in this fund shall be
 used to pay for programs selected  by  the  board  of  the  METROPOLITAN
 TRANSPORTATION  authority, in its discretion, to reduce the incidence of
 crimes and infractions on transit AND RAILROAD facilities, or to improve
 the enforcement of laws against such crimes and infractions. Such  funds
 shall  be  in addition to and not in substitution for any funds provided
 by the state or the city of New York for such purposes.
  § 3. Subdivision 4 of section 1266 of the public authorities  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  460  of  the  laws  of 2015, is amended to read as
 follows:
  4. The authority may establish and,  in  the  case  of  joint  service
 arrangements,  join  with  others in the establishment of such schedules
 and standards of operations and such other rules and regulations includ-
 ing but not limited to rules and regulations governing the  conduct  and
 safety  of  the public as it may deem necessary, convenient or desirable
 for the use and operation of any  transportation  facility  and  related
 services  operated  by  the  authority or under contract, lease or other
 arrangement, including joint service arrangements, with  the  authority.
 Such  rules  and  regulations  governing  the  conduct and safety of the
 public shall be filed  with  the  department  of  state  in  the  manner
 provided by section one hundred two of the executive law. In the case of
 any  conflict  between  any  such  rule  or  regulation of the authority
 governing the conduct or the safety of the public  and  any  local  law,
 ordinance,  rule or regulation, such rule or regulation of the authority
 shall prevail. Violation of any such rule or regulation of the authority
 OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES governing the conduct or the  safety  of  the
 public  in  or  upon any facility of the authority OR ANY OF ITS SUBSID-
 IARIES shall constitute an offense [and shall be] punishable by  a  fine
 not  exceeding  fifty  dollars  or imprisonment for not more than thirty
 days or both or may be punishable by the imposition of a  civil  penalty
 by  the  transit  adjudication  bureau  established  pursuant  to  the

 INTEREST  OR  COSTS  ASSESSED THEREON), IN ACCORDANCE WITH A SCHEDULE OF
 SUCH PENALTIES AS MAY FROM TIME TO TIME  BE ESTABLISHED BY RULES OF  THE

 S. 8308--A  11  A. 8808--A
 
 OR  A  SUBSIDIARY  RELATING  TO  THE  PAYMENT OF FARES IS THE FIRST SUCH
 VIOLATION BY AN INDIVIDUAL, THE VIOLATION MAY BE PUNISHABLE BY AN  OFFI-
 CIAL  WRITTEN  WARNING  ISSUED ACCORDING TO AND GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF
 THE  AUTHORITY  OR  A  SUBSIDIARY  IN ALL RESPECTS, PROVIDED THAT SUCH A
 WARNING ISSUED TO AN INDIVIDUAL SHALL NOT BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE  OTHER
 THAN AS A PREDICATE TO THE IMPOSITION BY THE TRANSIT ADJUDICATION BUREAU
 OF  A  CIVIL  PENALTY ON SUCH INDIVIDUAL PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION IN
 THE EVENT OF A SUBSEQUENT VIOLATION.  SUCH  SCHEDULE  OF  PENALTIES  MAY
 PROVIDE  FOR  THE  IMPOSITION OF SUPPLEMENTAL PENALTIES, NOT TO EXCEED A
 TOTAL OF FIFTY DOLLARS  FOR  EACH  VIOLATION,  UPON  THE  FAILURE  OF  A
 RESPONDENT  IN  ANY  PROCEEDING  COMMENCED  WITH  RESPECT  TO  ANY  SUCH
 VIOLATION TO MAKE TIMELY RESPONSE TO OR APPEARANCE IN CONNECTION WITH  A
 NOTICE  OF  VIOLATION  OF SUCH RULE OR TO ANY SUBSEQUENT NOTICE OR ORDER
 ISSUED BY THE AUTHORITY OR A SUBSIDIARY IN SUCH PROCEEDING. THERE  SHALL
 BE  NO  PENALTY  OR INCREMENT IN FINE BY VIRTUE OF A RESPONDENT'S TIMELY
 EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHT TO A HEARING OR APPEAL. THE RULES  MAY  PROVIDE,
 IN  ADDITION  TO  ANY  OTHER  SANCTIONS, FOR THE CONFISCATION OF TOKENS,
 TICKETS, CARDS OR OTHER FARE MEDIA THAT HAVE BEEN  FORGED,  COUNTERFEIT,
 IMPROPERLY  ALTERED OR TRANSFERRED, OR OTHERWISE USED IN A MANNER INCON-
 SISTENT WITH SUCH RULES.

 based on service and usage statistics of the preceding year.

  Notwithstanding any other inconsistent provisions of section  18-b  of
 the transportation law or any other law, any moneys provided to a public
 benefit  corporation constituting a transportation authority or to other
 public transportation systems in payment of state  operating  assistance
 or  such  lesser amount as the authority or public transportation system
 shall make application for, shall be paid by the commissioner of  trans-
 portation to such authority or public transportation system in lieu, and
 in full satisfaction, of any amounts which the authority would otherwise
 be entitled to receive under section 18-b of the transportation law.
  Notwithstanding  the  reporting  date provision of section 17-a of the
 transportation law, the reports of each regional transportation authori-
 ty and other major public transportation systems receiving  mass  trans-
 portation  operating  assistance shall be submitted on or before July 15
 of each year in the format prescribed by the commissioner of transporta-
 tion. Copies of such reports shall also be filed with  the  chairpersons
 of  the senate finance committee and the assembly ways and means commit-
 tee and the director of the budget. The commissioner  of  transportation
 may withhold future state operating assistance payments to public trans-
 portation systems or private operators that do not provide such reports.
  Payments may be made in quarterly installments as provided in subdivi-
 sion 2 of section 18-b of the transportation law or in such other manner
 and  at such other times as the commissioner of transportation, with the
 approval of the director of the budget, may provide; and  where  payment
 is  not  made in the manner provided by such subdivision 2, the matching
 payments required of any city, county, Indian  tribe  or  intercity  bus
 company  shall  be made within 30 days of the payment of state operating
 assistance pursuant to this section or on such other  basis  as  may  be
 agreed  upon  by the commissioner of transportation, the director of the
 budget, and the chief executive officer of  such  city,  county,  Indian
 tribe or intercity bus company.
  The commissioner of transportation shall be required to annually eval-
 uate the operating and financial performance of each major public trans-
 portation  system. Where the commissioner's evaluation process has iden-
 tified a problem related to system  performance,  the  commissioner  may
 request the system to develop plans to address the performance deficien-
 cies. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state oper-
 ating  assistance  payments  to public transportation systems or private
 operators that do not provide such operating, financial, or other infor-
 mation as may be required by the commissioner to conduct the  evaluation
 process.
  Payments  shall  be  made  contingent upon compliance with regulations
 deemed necessary and appropriate, as prescribed by the  commissioner  of
 transportation  and  approved by the director of the budget, which shall
 S. 8308--A  17  A. 8808--A
 
 promote the economy, efficiency, utility, effectiveness, and coordinated
 service delivery of public transportation systems. The  chief  executive
 officer  of  each public transportation system receiving a payment shall
 certify  to  the commissioner of transportation, in addition to informa-
 tion required by section 18-b of  the  transportation  law,  such  other
 information  as  the  commissioner  of transportation shall determine is
 necessary to determine compliance and carry out the purposes herein.
  Counties, municipalities or Indian tribes  that  propose  to  allocate
 service payments to operators on a basis other than the amount earned by
 the  service  payment formula shall be required to describe the proposed
 method of distributing governmental operating  aid  and  submit  it  one
 month  prior  to  the start of the operator's fiscal year to the commis-
 sioner of transportation in writing for review and approval prior to the
 distribution of state aid. The commissioner of transportation shall only
 approve alternate distribution methods which  are  consistent  with  the
 transportation  needs  of  the  people  to be served and ensure that the
 system of private operators does not exceed established maximum  service
 payment  limits.  Copies  of  such  approvals  shall be submitted to the
 chairpersons of the senate finance and assembly ways and  means  commit-
 tees.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 18-b of the
 transportation  law, the commissioner of transportation is authorized to
 continue to use prior quarter statistics to  determine  current  quarter
 payment  amounts,  as initiated in the April to June quarter of 1981. In
 the event that actual revenue passengers  and  actual  total  number  of
 vehicle, nautical or car miles are not available for the preceding quar-
 ter,  estimated  statistics  may  be  used  as the basis of payment upon
 approval by the commissioner  of  transportation.  In  such  event,  the
 succeeding  payment  shall be adjusted to reflect the difference between
 the actual and estimated total number of revenue passengers and vehicle,
 nautical or car miles used as the basis of the  estimated  payment.  The
 chief executive officer may apply for less aid than the system is eligi-
 ble  to receive. Each quarterly payment shall be attributable to operat-
 ing expenses incurred during the quarter in which it is received, unless
 otherwise specified by such commissioner.  In the event  that  a  public
 transportation  system  ceases  to participate in the program, operating
 assistance due for the final quarter that service is provided  shall  be
 based  upon the actual total number of revenue passengers and the actual
 total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles carried during that quar-
 ter.
  Payments shall be contingent on  compliance  with  audit  requirements
 determined by the commissioner of transportation.
  In  the  event  that  an  audit  of  a public transportation system or
 private operator receiving funds discloses the existence of an  overpay-
 ment  of state operating assistance, regardless of whether such an over-
 payment results from an audit  of  revenue  passengers  and  the  actual
 number of revenue vehicle miles statistics, or an audit of private oper-
 ators  in  cases  where more than a reasonable return based on equity or
 operating revenues and expenses has resulted, the commissioner of trans-
 portation, in addition to  recovering  the  amount  of  state  operating
 assistance  overpaid,  shall  also  recover  interest, as defined by the
 department of taxation and finance, on the amount of the overpayment.
  Notwithstanding any other law, rule or  regulation  to  the  contrary,
 whenever  the  commissioner  of  transportation is notified by the comp-
 troller that the amount  of  revenues  available  for  payment  from  an
 account is less than the total amount of money for which the public mass
 S. 8308--A  18  A. 8808--A
 
 transportation  systems  are  eligible  pursuant  to  the  provisions of
 section 88-a of the state finance law and any appropriations enacted for
 these purposes, the commissioner of  transportation  shall  establish  a
 maximum payment limit which is proportionally lower than the amounts set
 forth in appropriations.
  Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) of subdivisions 5 and 7 of section 88-a
 of  the state finance law and any other general or special law, payments
 may be made in quarterly installments or in such  other  manner  and  at
 such  other  times  as  the  commissioner  of  transportation,  with the
 approval of the director of the budget may prescribe.

 follows:
  26.  (a) With respect to highways (which term for the purposes of this
 paragraph shall include private roads open to public motor vehicle traf-
 fic) in such city, other than state highways maintained by the state  on
 which  the department of transportation shall have established higher or
 lower speed limits than the statutory fifty-five miles  per  hour  speed
 limit as provided in section sixteen hundred twenty of this title, or on
 which  the  department of transportation shall have designated that such
 city shall not establish any maximum speed limit as provided in  section
 sixteen  hundred  twenty-four  of this title, subject to the limitations
 imposed by section sixteen hundred eighty-four of this title, establish-
 ment of maximum speed limits at which vehicles may proceed  within  such
 city  or  within  designated areas of such city higher or lower than the
 fifty-five miles per hour maximum statutory limit. No such  speed  limit
 applicable  throughout such city or within designated areas of such city
 shall be established at less than [twenty-five] TWENTY miles  per  hour,
 except  that  school  speed  limits  may  be established at no less than
 [fifteen]  TEN  miles  per  hour  [pursuant  to]  NOTWITHSTANDING  the
 provisions of section sixteen hundred forty-three of this article.
  (b)  A  city  shall not lower OR RAISE a speed limit by more than five

 written  notice  and an opportunity to comment to the community board or
 community boards established pursuant to section twenty-eight hundred of

 designated highways within such city for the explicit purpose of  imple-
 menting  traffic  calming  measures  as  such  term  is  defined herein;
 provided, however, that no speed limit shall be set below [fifteen]  TEN
 miles per hour nor shall such speed limit be established where the traf-
 fic  calming  measure  to  be  implemented  consists solely of a traffic
 control sign.  Establishment of such a speed limit shall, where applica-
 ble, be in compliance with the provisions of  sections  sixteen  hundred
 twenty-four  and  sixteen  hundred  eighty-four of this [chapter] TITLE.
 Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to alter or affect  the  estab-

 measures and a lower speed limit were established [and];
  (ii)  a  description of the specific traffic calming measures used and
 the maximum speed limit established; and
  (iii) a comparison of the aggregate  type,  number,  and  severity  of
 accidents reported on streets on which street calming measures and lower
 speed  limits  were implemented in the year preceding the implementation
 of such measures and policies and the year following the  implementation
 of  such  measures and policies, to the extent this information is main-
 tained by any agency of the state or the city.

 read as follows:
  b.  (i)  Whenever  [an altered motor vehicle commonly referred to as a
 "stretch limousine"] ONE OF THE MOTOR VEHICLES ENUMERATED IN PARAGRAPH A
 OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION has failed  an  inspection  and  been
 placed  out-of-service,  the commissioner may direct a police officer or
 his or her agent to immediately secure possession of the  number  plates
 of  such  vehicle and return the same to the commissioner of motor vehi-
 cles. The commissioner shall notify the commissioner of  motor  vehicles
 to  that  effect, and the commissioner of motor vehicles shall thereupon
 suspend the registration of such vehicle until such time as the  commis-
 sioner  gives  notice  that the out-of-service defect has been satisfac-
 S. 8308--A  24  A. 8808--A
 
 torily adjusted. Provided, however, that  the  commissioner  shall  give
 notice  and  an opportunity to be heard within not more than thirty days
 of the suspension. Failure of the holder or  of  any  person  possessing
 such  plates  to  deliver  to  the  commissioner or his or her agent who
 requests the same pursuant to this paragraph shall be a misdemeanor. The
 commissioner of motor vehicles shall have the authority to deny a regis-
 tration or renewal application to any other person for the same  vehicle
 where  it  has been determined that such registrant's intent has been to
 evade the purposes of this paragraph and where the commissioner of motor
 vehicles has reasonable grounds to believe  that  such  registration  or
 renewal  will  have  the  effect of defeating the purposes of this para-
 graph. The procedure on any such suspension shall be the same as in  the
 case  of  a  suspension under the vehicle and traffic law.  Operation of
 such motor vehicle while under suspension as provided in  this  subdivi-
 sion shall constitute a class A misdemeanor AND SHALL BE PUNISHABLE BY A
 FINE OF NOT LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ASSESSED TO THE HOLDER OR
 OF  ANY  PERSON  POSSESSING  SUCH  PLATES FOR EACH OFFENSE COMMITTED, IN
 ADDITION TO ANY OTHER FINES, PENALTIES OR ACTIONS TAKEN WITH RESPECT  TO
 SUCH CONDUCT.
  (ii)  (a)  Upon  the seizure of number plates pursuant to subparagraph
 (i) of this paragraph, if the out-of-service defect is of a  type  where
 pursuant  to  the  commissioner's  regulations no inspection certificate
 will be issued until the defect  is  repaired  and  a  re-inspection  is
 conducted,  or  is  related to its horn, and the commissioner determines
 that allowing the [altered] motor vehicle to leave the  inspection  area
 would  be contrary to public safety, the commissioner may: (A) remove or
 arrange for the removal of, or may direct any police officer  to  remove
 or  arrange  for  the  removal of, the [altered] motor vehicle to a non-
 public garage or other place of safety where it shall remain  impounded,
 subject  to the provisions of this section; or (B) immobilize or arrange
 for the immobilization of the [altered] motor vehicle on premises  owned
 or  under  the  control  of  the  owner of such [altered] motor vehicle,
 subject to the provisions of this section. The [altered]  motor  vehicle

 THE "WATERFRONT COMMISSION ACT".
  § 534-A. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS. 1. THE  STATE  OF  NEW
 YORK HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES THAT:
  (A)  IN 1953, THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WATERFRONT LABOR WAS EMPLOYED
 WITHIN THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT WERE DEPRESSING  AND  DEGRADING  TO
 SUCH  LABOR, RESULTING FROM THE LACK OF ANY SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF HIRING,
 THE LACK OF ADEQUATE INFORMATION AS TO THE AVAILABILITY  OF  EMPLOYMENT,
 CORRUPT  HIRING  PRACTICES  AND  THE  FACT  THAT PERSONS CONDUCTING SUCH
 HIRING WERE FREQUENTLY CRIMINALS  AND  PERSONS  NOTORIOUSLY  LACKING  IN
 MORAL  CHARACTER  AND INTEGRITY AND NEITHER RESPONSIVE OR RESPONSIBLE TO
 THE EMPLOYERS NOR TO THE UNCOERCED WILL OF THE MAJORITY OF  THE  MEMBERS
 OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OF THE EMPLOYEES; THAT AS A RESULT WATERFRONT
 LABORERS  SUFFERED FROM IRREGULARITY OF EMPLOYMENT, FEAR AND INSECURITY,
 INADEQUATE EARNINGS, AN UNDULY HIGH ACCIDENT RATE, SUBJECTION TO BORROW-
 ING AT USURIOUS RATES OF INTEREST, EXPLOITATION  AND  EXTORTION  AS  THE
 PRICE OF SECURING EMPLOYMENT AND A LOSS OF RESPECT FOR THE LAW; THAT NOT
 ONLY  DID  THERE  RESULT  A  DESTRUCTION  OF THE DIGNITY OF AN IMPORTANT
 SEGMENT OF AMERICAN LABOR, BUT A DIRECT  ENCOURAGEMENT  OF  CRIME  WHICH
 IMPOSED A LEVY OF GREATLY INCREASED COSTS ON FOOD, FUEL AND OTHER NECES-
 SARIES HANDLED IN AND THROUGH THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT.
  (B)  MANY  OF  THESE  EVILS  RESULTED  NOT  ONLY FROM THE CAUSES ABOVE
 DESCRIBED BUT FROM THE PRACTICES OF PUBLIC LOADERS AT  PIERS  AND  OTHER
 WATERFRONT  TERMINALS.  SUCH  PUBLIC  LOADERS  SERVED  NO VALID ECONOMIC
 PURPOSE AND OPERATED AS PARASITES EXACTING A HIGH AND  UNWARRANTED  TOLL
 ON  THE  FLOW  OF COMMERCE IN AND THROUGH THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT,
 AND USED FORCE AND ENGAGED  IN  DISCRIMINATORY  AND  COERCIVE  PRACTICES
 INCLUDING  EXTORTION  AGAINST  PERSONS  NOT DESIRING TO EMPLOY THEM. THE
 STATES OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY FOUND THAT THE FUNCTION OF LOADING AND
 UNLOADING TRUCKS AND OTHER LAND VEHICLES AT PIERS AND  OTHER  WATERFRONT
 TERMINALS  SHOULD  BE  PERFORMED, AS IN EVERY OTHER MAJOR AMERICAN PORT,
 S. 8308--A  29  A. 8808--A
 
 WITHOUT THE EVILS AND ABUSES OF THE PUBLIC LOADER  SYSTEM,  AND  BY  THE
 CARRIERS OF FREIGHT BY WATER, STEVEDORES AND OPERATORS OF SUCH PIERS AND
 OTHER WATERFRONT TERMINALS OR THE OPERATORS OF SUCH TRUCKS OR OTHER LAND
 VEHICLES.
  (C)  MANY  OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED EVILS ALSO RESULTED FROM THE LACK OF
 REGULATION OF THE OCCUPATION OF STEVEDORES, WHO ENGAGED IN CORRUPT PRAC-
 TICES TO INDUCE THEIR HIRE BY CARRIERS OF FREIGHT BY WATER AND TO INDUCE
 OFFICERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF  LABOR  ORGANIZATIONS  TO  BETRAY  THEIR
 TRUST TO THE MEMBERS OF SUCH LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.
  (D)  THE  METHOD  OF  EMPLOYMENT  OF  LONGSHOREMEN  AND PORT WATCHMEN,
 COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE "SHAPE-UP",  RESULTED  IN  VICIOUS  AND  NOTORIOUS
 ABUSES,  OF  WHICH  SUCH EMPLOYEES WERE THE PRINCIPAL VICTIMS. THERE WAS
 COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THE SHAPE-UP PERMITTED AND ENCOURAGED EXTORTION
 FROM EMPLOYEES AS THE PRICE OF  SECURING  OR  RETAINING  EMPLOYMENT  AND
 SUBJECTED  SUCH  EMPLOYEES  TO THREATS OF VIOLENCE, UNWILLING JOINDER IN
 UNAUTHORIZED LABOR DISTURBANCES AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES  ON  THE  WATER-
 FRONT.  THE SHAPE-UP RESULTED IN A LOSS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBER-
 TIES OF LABOR, IMPAIRED THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF THE PORT OF  NEW  YORK
 DISTRICT  AND  WEAKENED  LAW ENFORCEMENT THEREIN. THE STATES OF NEW YORK
 AND NEW JERSEY FOUND THAT THESE PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS MUST BE  ELIMI-
 NATED  TO PREVENT GRAVE INJURY TO THE WELFARE OF WATERFRONT LABORERS AND
 OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE AND THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE SHAPE-UP AND  THE
 ESTABLISHMENT  OF A SYSTEM OF EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION CENTERS WERE NECES-
 SARY TO A SOLUTION FOR THESE PUBLIC PROBLEMS.
  (E) THE TWO STATES FOUND THAT THE OCCUPATIONS OF LONGSHOREMEN,  STEVE-
 DORES,  PIER  SUPERINTENDENTS,  HIRING  AGENTS  AND  PORT  WATCHMEN WERE
 AFFECTED WITH A PUBLIC INTEREST REQUIRING THEIR REGULATION AND THAT SUCH
 REGULATION WAS DEEMED AN EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER OF THE TWO  STATES
 FOR  THE  PROTECTION  OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY, WELFARE, PROSPERITY, HEALTH,
 PEACE AND LIVING CONDITIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE TWO STATES. THE  WATER-
 FRONT  COMMISSION  OF NEW YORK HARBOR ("BI-STATE COMMISSION") WAS FORMED
 THROUGH A CONGRESSIONALLY APPROVED COMPACT TO INVESTIGATE, DETER, COMBAT
 AND REMEDY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND INFLUENCE IN THE  PORT  AND  TO  ENSURE
 FAIR  HIRING  AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES SO THAT THE PORT AND REGION COULD
 GROW AND PROSPER.
  (F) THE BI-STATE COMMISSION WORKED TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF CORRUPTION AT
 THE PORT, AND EFFECTUATED TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGES ON THE WATERFRONT.  ITS
 EFFORTS  LED TO THE CONVICTION OF ORGANIZED-CRIME MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES
 FOR MURDER, EXTORTION, DRUG TRAFFICKING,  THEFT,  RACKETEERING,  ILLEGAL
 GAMBLING,  AND  LOANSHARKING,  AMONG  OTHER CRIMES. IN RECENT YEARS, ITS
 INVESTIGATIONS LED TO PROSECUTIONS OF UNION OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE
 TRADITIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME FAMILIES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CONTROL OR
 EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE UNION OF DOCKWORKERS AND COMMERCIAL
 ACTIVITY ON THE WATERFRONT.  THE  BI-STATE  COMMISSION'S  INVESTIGATIONS
 ALSO LED TO THE EXCLUSION OR REMOVAL FROM THE PORT WORKFORCE OF INDIVID-
 UALS WHO WERE CONVICTED OF SERIOUS CRIMES OR WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ORGAN-
 IZED CRIME. IT WORKED TO OVERCOME DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER UNFAIR HIRING
 PRACTICES  AND CONTINUED TO EXTIRPATE CORRUPTION AND RACKETEERING IN THE
 PORT OF NEW  YORK  DISTRICT  UNTIL  NEW  JERSEY'S  WITHDRAWAL  FROM  THE
 BI-STATE  COMPACT  PURSUANT  TO  CHAPTER  324 OF THE LAWS OF 2017 OF THE
 STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
  (G) ALTHOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S EFFORTS AGAINST  TRADITIONAL  ORGANIZED
 CRIME  INFLUENCE  HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL, SUCH INFLUENCE REMAINS A SIGNIF-
 ICANT THREAT IN THE NEW YORK  METROPOLITAN  AREA,  PARTICULARLY  IN  THE
 PORT. CONTINUED OVERSIGHT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE FAIR AND NONDISCRIMINA-
 TORY  HIRING PRACTICES, TO ELIMINATE LABOR RACKETEERING AND THE VICTIMI-
 S. 8308--A  30  A. 8808--A
 
 ZATION OF LEGITIMATE UNION MEMBERS AND PORT BUSINESSES, AND  TO  PREVENT
 ORGANIZED  CRIME  FIGURES FROM DIRECTLY OPERATING AT THE CRITICAL POINTS
 OF INTERSTATE AND INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would create the New York Waterfront Commission and revise
 the Retirement and Social Security Law to make permanent the changes  of
 Chapter  187  Laws  of  2023, which added the titles of investigator and
 sworn officer employed by the Waterfront Commission Act,  to  the  defi-
 nition  of  membership  in  Section  381-b including making such service
 creditable under RSSL §381-b, and further expand creditable  service  to
 include service as an investigator-trainee.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we do not
 anticipate  any  additional cost to the State of New York or the partic-
 ipating employers in the New  York  State  and  Local  Police  and  Fire
 Retirement System.
  To  the  extent  that new members gain coverage under Section 381-b of
 the RSSL, we anticipate a contribution of 26.4% of salary paid to  newly
 eligible  members  for  the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. In future
 years, this cost will vary but is expected to average  20.6%  of  salary
 annually.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.

  PART N
 S. 8308--A  64  A. 8808--A
 
  Section  1.  Expenditures  of  moneys  by  the  New  York state energy
 research and development authority for  services  and  expenses  of  the
 energy  research,  development  and  demonstration  program,  including
 grants, the energy policy and planning program, and the Fuel NY  program
 shall be subject to the provisions of this section.  Notwithstanding the
 provisions of subdivision 4-a of section 18-a of the public service law,
 all  moneys committed or expended in an amount not to exceed $28,725,000
 shall be reimbursed by assessment against gas corporations,  as  defined
 in  subdivision  11  of section 2 of the public service law and electric
 corporations as defined in subdivision 13 of section  2  of  the  public
 service  law, where such gas corporations and electric corporations have
 gross revenues from intrastate utility operations in excess of  $500,000
 in  the  preceding calendar year, and the total amount assessed shall be
 allocated to each electric corporation and gas corporation in proportion
 to its intrastate electricity and gas  revenues  in  the  calendar  year
 2022.  Such  amounts  shall  be  excluded  from the general assessment
 provisions of subdivision 2 of section 18-a of the public  service  law.
 The  chair  of  the public service commission shall bill such gas and/or
 electric corporations for such amounts on or before August 10, 2024  and
 such  amounts  shall  be  paid to the New York state energy research and
 development authority on or before September 10, 2024.  Upon  receipt,
 the  New  York  state  energy  research  and development authority shall
 deposit such funds in the energy research and development operating fund
 established pursuant to section 1859 of the public authorities law.  The
 New  York  state energy research and development authority is authorized
 and directed to: (1) transfer up to $4 million to the state general fund
 for climate change related services and expenses of  the  department  of
 environmental  conservation  from the funds received; and (2) commencing
 in 2016, provide to the chair of the public service commission  and  the
 director of the budget and the chairs and secretaries of the legislative
 fiscal  committees,  on or before August first of each year, an itemized
 record, certified by the president and chief executive  officer  of  the
 authority,  or  his  or her designee, detailing any and all expenditures
 and commitments ascribable to  moneys  received  as  a  result  of  this
 assessment  by the chair of the department of public service pursuant to
 section 18-a of the public service law.  This  itemized  record  shall
 include  an  itemized  breakdown  of  the  programs being funded by this
 section and the amount committed to each program.  The  authority  shall
 not  commit  for any expenditure, any moneys derived from the assessment
 provided for in this section, until the chair of  such  authority  shall
 have  submitted,  and  the director of the budget shall have approved, a
 comprehensive financial plan encompassing all moneys  available  to  and
 all  anticipated commitments and expenditures by such authority from any
 source for the operations of such authority.  Copies  of  the  approved
 comprehensive financial plan shall be immediately submitted by the chair
 to  the chairs and secretaries of the legislative fiscal committees. Any
 such amount not committed by such authority to contracts or contracts to
 be awarded or otherwise expended by the authority during the fiscal year
 shall be refunded by such authority on a  pro-rata  basis  to  such  gas
 and/or  electric  corporations,  in  a  manner  to  be determined by the
 department of public service, and any refund amounts must be  explicitly
 lined out in the itemized record described above.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2024.
 
  PART O
 S. 8308--A  65  A. 8808--A
 
  Section 1. Short title, legislative findings and declaration. This act
 shall be known and may be cited as the "renewable action through project
 interconnection and deployment (RAPID) act."  The  legislature  hereby
 finds and declares that:
  1. To timely achieve the renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction
 targets  established  pursuant  to  the climate leadership and community
 protection act ("CLCPA"), while contemporaneously maintaining the  reli-
 ability of the state's electric transmission system, action is needed to
 consolidate  and  expedite  the  environmental  review and permitting of
 major renewable energy facilities  and  major  electric  utility  trans-
 mission facilities.
  2.  Since  enactment  of  the  CLCPA,  it has become apparent that the
 State's bulk and local transmission facilities need to be  significantly
 upgraded  to  deliver  renewable  energy  to  load.  These significant
 upgrades in the bulk and local transmission system must be undertaken in
 an expedited timeframe consistent with  the  timeframe  to  achieve  the
 CLCPA targets.
  3.  In  the  context  of  achieving the CLCPA targets, a public policy
 purpose would be served and the interests of the people of the state  of
 New York would be advanced by transferring the Office of Renewable Ener-
 gy  Siting  ("ORES"),  currently under the auspices of the Department of
 State, to the Department of Public Service ("DPS")  and  providing  such
 office with additional responsibilities for the review and permitting of
 major electric transmission facilities as set forth in this act.
  4.  The legislature finds that such a transfer would combine the long-
 standing expertise of DPS related to transmission siting,  planning  and
 compliance  with  environmental  and  reliability  standards with ORES's
 expertise related to the siting of renewable energy resources and, in so
 doing, create synergies, and otherwise provide for more efficient siting
 of major renewable energy and transmission facilities.
  § 2. Section 94-c of the executive law is REPEALED.
  § 3. Transfer of Office of Renewable Energy Siting.  ORES,  an  office
 established  in  the  Department  of  State by the Accelerated Renewable
 Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act, enacted under part JJJ of chap-
 ter 58 of the laws of 2020, is hereby  transferred  to  and  established
 within  the  DPS,  and  shall  continue  to have all existing functions,
 powers, duties and obligations of ORES together with the new  additional
 functions, powers, duties and obligations set forth in this act.
  §  4.  Continuity  of  existing  functions, powers, duties and obli-
 gations.  All of the existing functions, powers, obligations, and duties
 granted to ORES by section 94-c of the executive law now  repealed,  are
 hereby  transferred,  and  shall be deemed to and held to constitute the
 continuation of such functions, powers, duties and obligations of  ORES,
 and not a different agency, authority, department or office.  All appli-
 cations  pending  before ORES on the effective date of this act shall be
 considered and treated as applications filed pursuant to this act as  of
 the date of filing of such applications.
  §  5.  Transfer of employees.  1. Upon the transfer of such functions,
 powers, duties and obligations pursuant to this act, provision shall  be
 made  for  the  transfer  of  all  employees of ORES situated within the
 department of state into DPS pursuant to subdivision 2 of section 70  of
 the  civil  service law.  Employees so transferred shall be transferred
 without further examination or qualification  to  the  same  or  similar
 titles,  shall  remain in the same collective bargaining units and shall
 retain their respective civil service classifications, status and rights
 S. 8308--A  66  A. 8808--A
 
 pursuant to their collective bargaining units and collective  bargaining
 agreements.
  2.  All  employees  hired after the effective date of this section
 shall, consistent with the provisions of article 14 of the civil service
 law, be classified in the same bargaining units.  Employees  other  than
 management or confidential persons as defined in article 14 of the civil
 service  law serving positions in newly created titles shall be assigned
 to the appropriate bargaining unit. Nothing contained  herein  shall  be
 construed to affect:
  (a) the rights of employees pursuant to a collective bargaining agree-
 ment; or
  (b) the representational relationships among employee organizations or
 the bargaining relationships between the state and an employee organiza-
 tion.
  §  6.  Transfer of records. All records, including but not limited to,
 books, papers, and property of ORES shall be transferred  and  delivered
 to DPS.
  §  7.  Transfer  and  continuation of regulations; conforming changes.
 Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of the  state  administrative
 procedure  act:  all  rules  and regulations of ORES adopted at 19 NYCRR
 part 900 in force at the time of the  transfer  of  ORES  to  DPS  shall
 continue  in  full  force  and  effect  as  rules and regulations of the
 department until duly modified or abrogated by such department; 19 NYCRR
 part 900 shall be and hereby is transferred to 16 NYCRR part  XXX,  with
 such conforming changes as shall be required to reflect the transfer and
 relocation  of ORES to DPS as provided in this act, without the need for
 additional proceedings under the state administrative procedure act, and
 shall continue in full force and effect; and notwithstanding  article  8
 of  the environmental conservation law and its implementing regulations,
 the transfer of 19 NYCRR part 900 to 16 NYCRR part XXX  as  provided  in
 this  section  shall  be excluded from review for all purposes under the
 state environmental quality review act, and  shall  not  be  subject  to
 review  or  otherwise  actionable under article 78 of the civil practice
 law and rules.
  § 8. Promulgation of rules and regulations. Notwithstanding any incon-
 sistent provision of the state administrative procedure act, the ORES in
 consultation with DPS shall be authorized to promulgate  regulations  on
 an  emergency  basis to ensure the implementation of this act absent any
 finding of an emergency.
  § 9. Subdivisions 3, 4 and 13 of section 2 of the public service  law,
 subdivisions  3  and 4 as amended by chapter 843 of the laws of 1981 and
 subdivision 13 as amended by chapter  375  of  the  laws  of  2022,  are

  PART P
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "affordable gas transition act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares that:
  1. The public service law (the "PSL") establishes the  public  service
 commission  ("commission")  and  department  of public service ("depart-
 ment") and charges them to ensure that New York residents have safe  and
 reliable  access  to energy at rates that are just and reasonable. These
 bedrock principles have persisted and guided commission  decisions  even
 as policy priorities and the technologies relied upon by regulated util-
 ities and their customers have changed.
  2.  The  climate leadership and community protection act (the "CLCPA")
 requires significant greenhouse gas emission reductions from all sectors
 of New York's economy and directs  state  agencies  and  authorities  to
 prioritize equity for the communities and workers most directly affected
 as they pursue those reductions.
  3. Buildings account for approximately one-third of the greenhouse gas
 emissions  in  New  York  state  and  produce  local air pollution, with
 significant adverse health impacts. Reducing the  greenhouse  gas  emis-
 sions  and  local air pollution emitted from New York's buildings, espe-
 cially in disadvantaged communities, is necessary  to  comply  with  the
 CLCPA.
  4.  Consumers' growing adoption of new electric technologies for space
 heating, water heating, cooking, and other functions  will  increasingly
 require responsive changes on the part of electric and gas corporations.
 The trend toward electrification is expected to eventually pose a funda-
 mental  challenge  to gas corporations' longstanding business model and,
 in particular, make it difficult for gas  corporations  to  recover  the
 full costs of their extensive infrastructure networks from consumers.
  5.  To  enable the commission to plan effectively for a changing legal
 and technological landscape, New York must update how it  regulates  the
 service provided by gas corporations. Appropriate statutory updates will
 enable  alignment  between  energy  infrastructure investments, changing
 technological options and consumer preferences,  and  the  two  thousand
 thirty and two thousand fifty greenhouse gas emission reduction mandates
 in  article  seventy-five of the environmental conservation law. Without
 such updates, it will become increasingly difficult to  ensure  all  New
 Yorkers  have  access  to the energy they need for heating, cooling, and
 powering the buildings in which they live and work at just  and  reason-
 able rates.
  6.  The New York State public service law requires utilities to expand
 natural gas infrastructure in response to requests from consumers,  even
 when the foreseeable costs of such expansion promise to become unmanage-
 able,  and  alternatives  would be more cost-effective. In this way, the
 public service law constrains the commission and department from  ensur-
 S. 8308--A  85  A. 8808--A
 
 ing  that  utilities respond appropriately to a changing marketplace and
 the CLCPA's emission reduction requirements.
  a.  Statutorily mandated utility system extension allowances shift the
 significant costs of new customer hookups to existing customers,  creat-
 ing  strong incentives to expand reliance on natural gas and the infras-
 tructure that delivers it while obscuring the costs of such expansion to
 all stakeholders.
  b. Citing their obligation under the public service  law,  gas  corpo-
 rations  in  New York continue investing in the expansion of gas infras-
 tructure despite the risk of that  infrastructure  becoming  a  stranded
 asset.  These  investments  are  made  at  the  expense  of  alternative
 solutions available to utility customers today.
  c. Gas corporations' obligation  to  serve,  codified  in  the  public
 service  law,  is  a major obstacle to development of neighborhood-scale
 building decarbonization projects that would help  align  energy  system
 investments  with  the two thousand thirty and two thousand fifty green-
 house gas emission reduction mandates in  article  seventy-five  of  the
 environmental  conservation law in a manner that mitigates costs for all
 utility customers and ensures a just transition for impacted workers.
  7. Now that multiple liquified natural gas export terminals have inte-
 grated domestic sources of natural gas into  the  international  market,
 New  Yorkers  that  rely  on  natural gas may face generally higher fuel
 prices and greater price volatility. Decarbonizing buildings,  investing
 in  energy  efficiency,  and developing renewable sources of electricity
 will all yield greater energy security and savings for New  York  energy
 consumers.
  8.  Thus,  it is the intent of the legislature to enact the affordable
 gas transition act for the following purposes:
  a. to ensure that regulation and oversight of gas  utilities  pursuant
 to  the  public  service  law  will provide for the timely and strategic
 management of the gas system  in  light  of  changing  technologies  and
 consumer  preferences,  greenhouse  gas emission reduction requirements,
 the need to keep energy affordable for all consumers, and  the  need  to
 ensure a just transition for affected communities and workers;
  b. to provide the commission with statutory authority and direction to
 align  its  regulations  and  gas  and  electric  corporations' planning
 efforts with ongoing changes in technology and consumer  preferences  as
 well as the CLCPA's requirements;
  c.  to end statutorily mandated incentives for the expansion of fossil
 fuel infrastructure while maintaining the equitable provision  of  elec-
 tric  service  for  efficient  heating, cooling, cooking, hot water, and
 other uses;
  d. to address barriers to the provision of affordable access to  elec-
 tricity  for  heating  and  cooling  for  low-income and moderate-income
 consumers; and
  e. to clarify that municipal building codes regulating  on-site  emis-
 sions are not preempted under New York state law.
  9.  This legislation does not establish a ban on the use of gas. It is
 neither the intent nor would it be the effect  of  this  legislation  to
 require  the immediate transition of any existing gas customer to alter-
 native heating and cooling services.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 4 of the public service law, as  amended
 by chapter 594 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  1. There shall be in the department of public service a public service
 commission, which shall possess the powers and duties hereinafter speci-
 fied,  and also all powers necessary or proper to enable it to carry out
 S. 8308--A  86  A. 8808--A
 
 the purposes of this chapter AND TO ENABLE ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE
 JUSTICE  AND  EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN ARTICLE SEVENTY-FIVE OF THE
 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW. The commission  shall  consist  of  five
 members,  to  be  appointed  by the governor, by and with the advice and
 consent of the senate. A commissioner shall be designated as  [chairman]
 CHAIRPERSON  of the commission by the governor to serve in such capacity
 at the pleasure of the governor or until [his] THEIR term as commission-
 er expires whichever first occurs. At least one commissioner shall  have
 experience  in utility consumer advocacy. No more than three commission-
 ers may be members of the  same  political  party  unless,  pursuant  to

 by  chapter 877 of the laws of 1953, is amended and two new subdivisions
 2-b and 12-e are added to read as follows:
  2. Investigate and ascertain, from time to time, the  quality  of  gas
 supplied  by persons, corporations and municipalities; examine or inves-
 tigate the methods employed by such persons,  corporations  and  munici-
 palities in manufacturing, distributing and supplying gas or electricity
 for  light,  heat,  COOLING,  or power and in transmitting the same, and
 have power to order such reasonable improvements as  will  best  promote
 the  public interest, preserve the public health and protect those using
 such gas or electricity  and  those  employed  in  the  manufacture  and
 distribution  thereof,  and  have power to order reasonable improvements
 and extensions of the works, wires, poles, lines,  conduits,  ducts  and
 other  reasonable  devices,  apparatus and property of gas corporations,
 electric corporations and municipalities; and have power after an inves-
 tigation and a hearing to order any corporation having  authority  under
 any  general  or  special  law or under any charter or franchise, to lay
 down, erect or maintain wires, pipes, conduits, ducts or other  fixtures
 in, over or under the streets, highways and public places of any munici-
 pality  for  the  purpose  of supplying, selling or distributing natural
 gas, to augment its supply of natural gas, whenever the commission deems
 necessary and whenever artificial gas can  be  reasonably  obtained,  by
 acquiring  by  purchase, manufacture or otherwise a supply thereof to be
 mixed with such natural gas, in order to render adequate service to  the
 customers  of such corporation or to maintain a proper and uniform pres-
 sure; and have power after an investigation and a hearing to  order  any
 corporation  having  authority under any general or special law or under
 any charter or franchise, to lay down, erect or maintain  wires,  pipes,
 conduits,  ducts  or other fixtures in, over or under the streets, high-
 ways and public places of any municipality for the purpose of supplying,
 selling or distributing artificial gas, to augment its supply of artifi-
 cial gas, whenever the commission deems necessary and  whenever  natural
 gas  can be reasonably obtained, by acquiring by purchase or otherwise a
 supply thereof to be mixed with such artificial gas, in order to  render
 adequate  service  to the customers of such corporation or to maintain a
 proper and uniform pressure; and to fix such rate for the  supplying  of
 mixed  gas  as  shall  secure to such corporation a fair return; and may
 order the curtailment or discontinuance of the use of  natural  gas  for
 manufacturing  or  industrial  purposes,  for periods aggregating not to
 exceed four months in any calendar year, if it  is  established  to  the
 satisfaction  of  the  commission  that the supply of natural gas is not
 S. 8308--A  90  A. 8808--A
 
 adequate to meet the reasonable demands of domestic consumption [and may
 prohibit the use of natural gas in wasteful devices and practices].
  2-B. HAVE POWER TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF NATURAL GAS IN WASTEFUL DEVICES
 AND PRACTICES, AND TO ORDER THE CURTAILMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF THE USE
 OF  ALL  OR  PORTIONS  OF THE WORKS, PIPES, AND OTHER GAS PLANT OF A GAS
 CORPORATION, WHERE THE COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT  SUCH  CURTAILMENT
 OR DISCONTINUANCE IS REASONABLY REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATE ENERGY POLI-
 CY, PROVIDED THAT SUCH CURTAILMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE SHALL BE CONSISTENT
 WITH  A  COMMISSION-APPROVED  PROGRAM  TO  ACHIEVE  CONSISTENCY WITH THE
 CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN ARTICLE  SEVENTY-FIVE
 OF  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL  CONSERVATION  LAW, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
 RECOVERY OF THE GAS CORPORATION'S INVESTMENT IN SUCH SYSTEM AT JUST  AND
 REASONABLE RATES.
  12-E.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL  REVIEW THE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PLAN OF
 EACH GAS CORPORATION AND ESTABLISH A PROCESS TO EXAMINE FEASIBLE  ALTER-
 NATIVES  TO SUCH CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO ALIGN WITH THE CLIMATE JUSTICE
 AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN ARTICLE SEVENTY-FIVE OF THE  ENVIRON-
 MENTAL  CONSERVATION  LAW.  THE  COMMISSION MAY REQUIRE PARTICIPATION IN
 SUCH PROCESS BY EACH ELECTRIC CORPORATION WITH A SERVICE  AREA  OVERLAP-
 PING THE SERVICE AREA OF THE GAS CORPORATION.
  § 10. Section 66-a of the public service law, as added by chapter 7 of
 the laws of 1948, subdivision 1 as amended and subdivision 3 as added by
 chapter 582 of the laws of 1975, subdivision 2 as amended by chapter 722
 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
  § 66-a. Conservation  of  gas,  declaration  of  policy, delegation of
 power.  1. It is hereby declared to be the policy  of  this  state  that
 when  there  develops  in  any area a situation under which a gas corpo-
 ration supplying gas to such area is unable to meet the reasonable needs
 of its consumers and of persons or  corporations  applying  for  new  or
 additional  gas  service, the available supply of gas shall be allocated
 among the customers of such gas corporation, in such manner  as  may  be
 necessary  to  protect public health and safety and to avoid undue hard-
 ship, PARTICULARLY FOR  LOW-TO-MODERATE  INCOME  RESIDENTIAL  CUSTOMERS,
 ELECTRIC  GENERATION NEEDED FOR ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY, AND CUSTOM-
 ERS WITH HARD-TO-ELECTRIFY INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USES,  pursuant  to
 rules  and  regulations as may be adopted by the commission, and that to
 carry out this declared policy the jurisdiction of  the  public  service
 commission should be clarified.
  2. Notwithstanding the provisions of any statute or any franchise held
 by  a gas corporation, the commission shall have power, upon the finding
 that CONTINUED GAS SERVICE IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE
 CLIMATE JUSTICE AND EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN ARTICLE  SEVENTY-FIVE
 OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW, OR THAT there exists such a shor-
 tage of gas in any area in the state, that the gas corporation supplying
 such  area  is unable and will be unable to secure or produce sufficient
 gas to meet the reasonable needs of its  customers  and  of  persons  or
 corporations applying for new or additional gas service, to require such
 corporation  to  immediately  discontinue  the supplying of gas to addi-
 tional customers or of supplying additional service to  present  custom-
 ers,  for  such  purpose or purposes as may be designated by the commis-
 sion, or to  customers  using  gas  for  a  purpose  prohibited  by  the
 commission  pursuant  to  this  act,  and that upon the finding that the
 supply of gas available is  and  will  be  insufficient  to  supply  the
 demands  of  all consumers receiving service, to require such gas corpo-
 ration to curtail or discontinue  service  to  any  or  all  classes  of
 customers  of  such  gas  corporation.  In  imposing such a direction or
 S. 8308--A  91  A. 8808--A
 
 requirement, the commission shall give consideration first  to  existing
 domestic  uses  and  uses  deemed  to  be necessary by the commission to
 protect public health and safety and to avoid undue hardship [and  shall
 be  limited  to the period of the emergency provided that the gas corpo-
 ration affected shall make such restriction,  curtailing  or  discontin-
 uance  applicable  to  all customers or applicants for service in a like
 class. If the commission determines that good cause exists for supplying
 service to additional customers or for supplying additional  service  to
 some  existing  customers, notwithstanding the curtailment or discontin-
 uance of service to other existing customers, it shall,  to  the  extent
 feasible, allocate gas with equal priority to new or additional domestic
 uses  of  gas  and  commercial or industrial processes which require gas
 because there is no practical substitute for it in  such  proportion  as
 the  commission  determines to be reasonable.  Provided that the commis-
 sion shall be permitted, after public hearing, to authorize any  natural
 gas  produced  from  lands  under the waters of Lake Erie to be used for
 process or feedstock requirements].  The  commission  is  authorized  to
 adopt such rules, regulations and orders as are necessary or appropriate
 to carry out these delegated powers.
  3.  In carrying out the delegated powers provided for in this section,
 the commission shall, to the extent practicable, determine and establish
 gas conservation measures or standards, INCLUDING ENERGY-EFFICIENT ELEC-
 TRIFICATION OF GAS END USES. The commission may require compliance  with
 such measures or standards as a condition of receiving service.
  4.  THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NEW OR ADDI-
 TIONAL GAS SERVICE IS WARRANTED NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  NEED  TO  CONSERVE
 RESOURCES  FOR  SERVICE  TO  EXISTING  GAS CUSTOMERS. SUCH DETERMINATION
 SHALL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT  OF  THE  CLIMATE  JUSTICE  AND
 EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN ARTICLE SEVENTY-FIVE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL
 CONSERVATION  LAW,  AND MAY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS INCLUDING ECONOMIC
 DEVELOPMENT, IMPACTS ON NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS INCLUDING LOW-TO-MOD-
 ERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS, IMPACTS ON SYSTEM SAFETY  AND  ADEQUACY,  EQUITY
 TOWARD  EXISTING CUSTOMERS WITH LIMITED CONVERSION ALTERNATIVES, AND THE
 FEASIBILITY OF NEIGHBORHOOD-SCALE ALTERNATIVES TO USAGE  OF  FUELS  WITH
 HIGH  LIFE-CYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ON-SITE CO-POLLUTANT EMIS-
 SIONS, INCLUDING THERMAL ENERGY NETWORKS.
  § 11. Section 66-b of the public service law is REPEALED.
  § 12. The public service law is amended by adding a new  section  66-w
 to read as follows:
  §  66-W.  EXPANSION OF GAS PLANT INTO NEW AREAS. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN
 THIS SECTION, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF  THIS  CHAPTER,
 AFTER  DECEMBER  THIRTY-FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE, NO GAS CORPO-
 RATION SHALL COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW GAS PLANT THAT WOULD  EXPAND
 THE  AVAILABILITY OF SERVICE INTO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE GAS SERVICE WAS
 NOT AVAILABLE PRIOR TO THAT DATE AS DEFINED BY THE APPLICABLE  UTILITY'S
 CERTIFICATE  OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY APPROVED BY THE COMMIS-
 SION. THE COMMISSION MAY AUTHORIZE EXCEPTIONS ON A  CASE-BY-CASE  BASIS,
 PROVIDED  THAT  THE  COMMISSION  FINDS THAT SUCH CONSTRUCTION SERVES THE
 PUBLIC INTEREST OR ALTERNATIVES TO GAS SERVICE ARE EITHER NOT TECHNICAL-
 LY FEASIBLE OR PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE.
  § 13. Severability clause. The provisions of this act shall be severa-
 ble and if the application of any clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivi-
 sion,  section,  or  part thereof to any person or circumstance shall be
 adjudged by any court of competent  jurisdiction  to  be  invalid,  such
 judgment  shall not necessarily affect, impair, or invalidate the appli-
 cation of any such clause, sentence,  paragraph,  subdivision,  section,

 lation  to  account  for  any deficit or surplus in the operating permit
 program account of the clean air fund established  pursuant  to  section
 ninety-seven-oo  of  the state finance law[; any loan repayment from the
 mobile source account of the clean  air  fund  established  pursuant  to
 section  ninety-seven-oo  of  the  state  finance  law;] and the rate of
 collection by the department of the bills issued for the [fee] FEES  for
 the prior year.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of the state administrative procedure
 act, such calculation and [fee] FEES shall be established as a  rule  by
 publication  in  the  Environmental Notice Bulletin no later than thirty
 days after the budget bills making appropriations  for  the  support  of
 government  are  enacted  or July first, whichever is later, of the year
 such [fee] FEES will be effective. In no  event  shall  the  [fee]  FEES
 established herein be any greater than the maximum fee identified pursu-
 ant to this section.
  3.  Effective  January  first,  [nineteen hundred ninety-seven through
 December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight] TWO THOUSAND TWEN-
 S. 8308--A  97  A. 8808--A
 
 TY-SEVEN AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER, and notwithstanding the  requirements
 of  the  state  administrative  procedure  act,  [the cap of twenty-five
 dollars] EACH per ton FEE shall increase by the percentage, if  any,  by
 which  the consumer price index exceeds the consumer price index for the
 [calendar] PRIOR CALENDAR year [nineteen hundred eighty-nine].
  a. The consumer price index for any PRIOR calendar year is the average
 of the consumer price index for all urban  consumers  published  by  the
 United  States  department of labor, as of the close of the twelve-month
 period ending on August thirty-first of each calendar year.
  b. The [revision of the] DEPARTMENT SHALL USE THE MOST RECENT consumer
 price index [for the calendar year nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall be
 used in the event] PUBLISHED BY the department  of  labor  [revises  its
 method of determining the consumer price index].
  5.  Any regulated air contaminant subject to the fees imposed pursuant
 to this section which qualifies as both a volatile organic compound  and
 a  hazardous air pollutant regulated pursuant to section 7412 of the Act
 shall not be counted under both categories AND SHALL ONLY BE COUNTED  AS
 A HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANT for the purpose of assessing fees.
  §  3.  Subdivision 7 of section 72-0303 of the environmental conserva-
 tion law is REPEALED.

 POWER TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF ALL RELEVANT BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTS,

 CONSPICUOUS MANNER.

 SUPERINTENDENT,  A  BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER  LENDER SHALL, BEFORE PROVIDING OR
 CAUSING TO BE PROVIDED A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LOAN TO A CONSUMER, MAKE,  OR
 CAUSE  TO BE MADE, A REASONABLE DETERMINATION THAT SUCH CONSUMER HAS THE
 ABILITY TO REPAY THE BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LOAN.
  3. CREDIT REPORTING. A  BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER  LENDER  SHALL  MAINTAIN  OR
 CAUSE  TO BE MAINTAINED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR MAINTAINING ACCURATE
 DATA THAT MAY BE REPORTED TO CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES. THE  SUPERINTEN-

 CONSUMERS. A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER SHALL  MAINTAIN  OR  CAUSE  TO  BE
 MAINTAINED  POLICIES  AND PROCEDURES REGARDING SUCH HANDLING OF RETURNS,
 REFUNDS, AND CREDITS. A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER SHALL DISCLOSE OR CAUSE

 MATERIAL RISKS, COSTS, OR CONDITIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE; (II) THE
 INABILITY  OF  THE  CONSUMER TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE CONSUMER IN
 SELECTING OR USING A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCT OR SERVICE; OR (III) THE
 REASONABLE RELIANCE BY THE CONSUMER ON A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER TO ACT
 IN THE INTERESTS OF THE CONSUMER; AND (C) EXCESSIVE SHALL  MEAN  GREATER
 THAN  IS REASONABLY NECESSARY, CONSIDERING THE COST INCURRED BY THE BUY-
 NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER IN PROVIDING  ANY  SERVICES  ASSOCIATED  WITH  SUCH
 PENALTY  OR FEE, THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF THE BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LEND-
 ER, AND THE MAINTENANCE OF A SAFE  AND  SOUND  BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER  LENDER
 THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
  7.  USE OF CONSUMER DATA. A BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER LENDER SHALL CLEARLY AND
 CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLOSE OR CAUSE TO BE DISCLOSED TO A CONSUMER  TO  WHICH
 IT  PROVIDES A LOAN HOW SUCH CONSUMER'S DATA MAY BE USED BY THE BUY-NOW-
 PAY-LATER LENDER AND PROVIDE THE CONSUMER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE  OR
 WITHDRAW  CONSENT  TO SUCH USE. THE SUPERINTENDENT, IN THEIR DISCRETION,
 MAY BY REGULATION PROHIBIT CERTAIN USES OF CONSUMER  DATA  IF  SUCH  USE
 POSES AN UNDUE RISK TO CONSUMERS.
  8.  UNAUTHORIZED  USE.  THE  SUPERINTENDENT  MAY ISSUE RULES AND REGU-
 LATIONS REGARDING TREATMENT OF UNAUTHORIZED USE, SO THAT  CONSUMERS  ARE
 LIABLE  FOR  USE  OF  BUY-NOW-PAY-LATER  LOANS  IN THEIR NAME ONLY UNDER
 CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SUCH LIABILITY WOULD BE FAIR AND REASONABLE.
