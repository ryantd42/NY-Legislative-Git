  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 S. 8308--C  4  A. 8808--C
 
  Section  1.  This  act enacts into law major components of legislation
 necessary to implement the state  transportation,  economic  development
 and  environmental  conservation  budget  for the 2024-2025 state fiscal
 year. Each component is wholly contained within  a  Part  identified  as
 Parts  A  through  TT.  The effective date for each particular provision
 contained within such Part is set forth in  the  last  section  of  such
 Part.  Any  provision  in any section contained within a Part, including
 the effective date of the Part, which makes a reference to a section "of
 this act", when used in connection with that particular component, shall
 be deemed to mean and refer to the corresponding section of the Part  in
 which  it  is  found.  Section  three of this act sets forth the general
 effective date of this act.
 
  PART A
 
  Section 1. Section 3 of part PP of chapter 54  of  the  laws  of  2016
 amending the public authorities law and the general municipal law relat-
 ing  to  the New York transit authority and the metropolitan transporta-
 tion authority, as amended by section 1 of part C of chapter 58  of  the
 laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  §  3. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that the amend-
 ments to subdivision 1 of section 119-r of  the  general  municipal  law
 made  by  section  two  of  this act shall expire and be deemed repealed
 April 1, [2024] 2025, and provided further that such  repeal  shall  not
 affect the validity or duration of any contract entered into before that
 date pursuant to paragraph f of such subdivision.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART B

  PART C
 
  Intentionally Omitted
 
  PART D
 
  Intentionally Omitted
 
  PART E
 
  Section  1.  Section  1  of part I of chapter 413 of the laws of 1999,
 relating to providing for mass transportation payments,  as  amended  by
 section  1  of  part  E of chapter 58 of the laws of 2022, is amended to
 read as follows:
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or  regulation  to  the
 contrary,  payment  of mass transportation operating assistance pursuant
 to section 18-b of the  transportation  law  shall  be  subject  to  the
 provisions  contained  herein and the amounts made available therefor by
 appropriation.
  In establishing service and usage formulas for  distribution  of  mass
 transportation  operating assistance, the commissioner of transportation
 S. 8308--C  5  A. 8808--C
 
 may combine and/or  take  into  consideration  those  formulas  used  to
 distribute  mass transportation operating assistance payments authorized
 by separate appropriations in order to facilitate program administration
 and to ensure an orderly distribution of such funds.
  To  improve  the  predictability  in  the  level  of funding for those
 systems receiving operating assistance payments under service and  usage
 formulas,  the  commissioner  of  transportation  is authorized with the
 approval of the director of the  budget,  to  provide  service  payments
 based on service and usage statistics of the preceding year.
  In the case of a service payment made, pursuant to section 18-b of the
 transportation law, to a regional transportation authority on account of
 mass transportation services provided to more than one county (consider-
 ing the city of New York to be one county), the respective shares of the
 matching  payments required to be made by a county to any such authority
 shall be as follows:

  Notwithstanding any other inconsistent provisions of section  18-b  of
 the transportation law or any other law, any moneys provided to a public
 benefit  corporation constituting a transportation authority or to other
 public transportation systems in payment of state  operating  assistance
 or  such  lesser amount as the authority or public transportation system
 shall make application for, shall be paid by the commissioner of  trans-
 portation to such authority or public transportation system in lieu, and
 in full satisfaction, of any amounts which the authority would otherwise
 be entitled to receive under section 18-b of the transportation law.
  Notwithstanding  the  reporting  date provision of section 17-a of the
 transportation law, the reports of each regional transportation authori-
 ty and other major public transportation systems receiving  mass  trans-
 portation  operating  assistance shall be submitted on or before July 15
 of each year in the format prescribed by the commissioner of transporta-
 tion. Copies of such reports shall also be filed with  the  chairpersons
 of  the senate finance committee and the assembly ways and means commit-
 tee and the director of the budget. The commissioner  of  transportation
 may withhold future state operating assistance payments to public trans-
 portation systems or private operators that do not provide such reports.
  Payments may be made in quarterly installments as provided in subdivi-
 sion 2 of section 18-b of the transportation law or in such other manner
 and  at such other times as the commissioner of transportation, with the
 approval of the director of the budget, may provide; and  where  payment
 is  not  made in the manner provided by such subdivision 2, the matching
 payments required of any city, county, Indian  tribe  or  intercity  bus
 company  shall  be made within 30 days of the payment of state operating
 assistance pursuant to this section or on such other  basis  as  may  be
 agreed  upon  by the commissioner of transportation, the director of the
 budget, and the chief executive officer of  such  city,  county,  Indian
 tribe or intercity bus company.
  The commissioner of transportation shall be required to annually eval-
 uate the operating and financial performance of each major public trans-
 portation  system. Where the commissioner's evaluation process has iden-
 tified a problem related to system  performance,  the  commissioner  may
 request the system to develop plans to address the performance deficien-
 cies. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state oper-
 ating  assistance  payments  to public transportation systems or private
 operators that do not provide such operating, financial, or other infor-
 mation as may be required by the commissioner to conduct the  evaluation
 process.
  Payments  shall  be  made  contingent upon compliance with regulations
 deemed necessary and appropriate, as prescribed by the  commissioner  of
 transportation  and  approved by the director of the budget, which shall
 promote the economy, efficiency, utility, effectiveness, and coordinated
 service delivery of public transportation systems. The  chief  executive
 officer  of  each public transportation system receiving a payment shall
 certify to the commissioner of transportation, in addition  to  informa-
 tion  required  by  section  18-b  of the transportation law, such other
 information as the commissioner of  transportation  shall  determine  is
 necessary to determine compliance and carry out the purposes herein.
  Counties,  municipalities  or  Indian  tribes that propose to allocate
 service payments to operators on a basis other than the amount earned by
 S. 8308--C  7  A. 8808--C
 
 the service payment formula shall be required to describe  the  proposed
 method  of  distributing  governmental  operating  aid and submit it one
 month prior to the start of the operator's fiscal year  to  the  commis-
 sioner of transportation in writing for review and approval prior to the
 distribution of state aid. The commissioner of transportation shall only
 approve  alternate  distribution  methods  which are consistent with the
 transportation needs of the people to be  served  and  ensure  that  the
 system  of private operators does not exceed established maximum service
 payment limits. Copies of such  approvals  shall  be  submitted  to  the
 chairpersons  of  the senate finance and assembly ways and means commit-
 tees.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 18-b of the
 transportation law, the commissioner of transportation is authorized  to
 continue  to  use  prior quarter statistics to determine current quarter
 payment amounts, as initiated in the April to June quarter of  1981.  In
 the  event  that  actual  revenue  passengers and actual total number of
 vehicle, nautical or car miles are not available for the preceding quar-
 ter, estimated statistics may be used  as  the  basis  of  payment  upon
 approval  by  the  commissioner  of  transportation.  In such event, the
 succeeding payment shall be adjusted to reflect the  difference  between
 the actual and estimated total number of revenue passengers and vehicle,
 nautical  or  car  miles used as the basis of the estimated payment. The
 chief executive officer may apply for less aid than the system is eligi-
 ble to receive. Each quarterly payment shall be attributable to  operat-
 ing expenses incurred during the quarter in which it is received, unless
 otherwise  specified  by such commissioner.  In the event that a public
 transportation system ceases to participate in  the  program,  operating
 assistance  due  for the final quarter that service is provided shall be
 based upon the actual total number of revenue passengers and the  actual
 total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles carried during that quar-
 ter.
  Payments  shall  be  contingent  on compliance with audit requirements
 determined by the commissioner of transportation.
  In the event that an  audit  of  a  public  transportation  system  or
 private  operator receiving funds discloses the existence of an overpay-
 ment of state operating assistance, regardless of whether such an  over-
 payment  results  from  an  audit  of  revenue passengers and the actual
 number of revenue vehicle miles statistics, or an audit of private oper-
 ators in cases where more than a reasonable return based  on  equity  or
 operating revenues and expenses has resulted, the commissioner of trans-
 portation,  in  addition  to  recovering  the  amount of state operating
 assistance overpaid, shall also recover  interest,  as  defined  by  the
 department of taxation and finance, on the amount of the overpayment.
  Notwithstanding  any  other  law,  rule or regulation to the contrary,
 whenever the commissioner of transportation is  notified  by  the  comp-
 troller  that  the  amount  of  revenues  available  for payment from an
 account is less than the total amount of money for which the public mass
 transportation systems  are  eligible  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 section 88-a of the state finance law and any appropriations enacted for
 these  purposes,  the  commissioner  of transportation shall establish a
 maximum payment limit which is proportionally lower than the amounts set
 forth in appropriations.
  Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) of subdivisions 5 and 7 of section 88-a
 of the state finance law and any other general or special law,  payments
 may  be  made  in  quarterly installments or in such other manner and at
 S. 8308--C  8  A. 8808--C
 
 such other  times  as  the  commissioner  of  transportation,  with  the
 approval of the director of the budget may prescribe.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2024.

  § 534-A. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS. 1. THE  STATE  OF  NEW
 YORK HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES THAT:
  IN  1953,  THE  CONDITIONS  UNDER  WHICH WATERFRONT LABOR WAS EMPLOYED
 WITHIN THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT WERE DEPRESSING  AND  DEGRADING  TO
 SUCH  LABOR, RESULTING FROM THE LACK OF ANY SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF HIRING,
 THE LACK OF ADEQUATE INFORMATION AS TO THE AVAILABILITY  OF  EMPLOYMENT,
 CORRUPT  AND  DISCRIMINATORY  HIRING  PRACTICES, CRIMINAL PRACTICES, AND
 COERCION OF EMPLOYEES OR EMPLOYERS.  NOW, IT CONTINUES TO BE IN THE BEST
 INTEREST OF THE STATE TO REGULATE ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE PORT OF NEW YORK
 DISTRICT IN THIS STATE TO PREVENT SUCH CONDITIONS AND TO PREVENT CIRCUM-
 STANCES THAT RESULT IN WATERFRONT LABORERS SUFFERING  FROM  IRREGULARITY
 OF  EMPLOYMENT, FEAR AND INSECURITY, INADEQUATE EARNINGS, AN UNDULY HIGH
 ACCIDENT RATE, SUBJECTION TO BORROWING AT USURIOUS  RATES  OF  INTEREST,
 EXPLOITATION  AND  EXTORTION AS THE PRICE OF SECURING EMPLOYMENT, A LOSS
 OF RESPECT FOR THE LAW, AND DESTRUCTION OF THE DIGNITY OF  AN  IMPORTANT
 SEGMENT  OF  AMERICAN  LABOR,  AND  TO PREVENT A DIRECT ENCOURAGEMENT OF
 S. 8308--C  14  A. 8808--C
 
 CRIME WHICH IMPOSES A LEVY OF GREATLY INCREASED COSTS ON FOOD, FUEL  AND
 OTHER  NECESSARIES  HANDLED IN AND THROUGH THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT
 IN THIS STATE.
  IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNCTION OF
 LOADING  AND UNLOADING TRUCKS AND OTHER LAND VEHICLES AT PIERS AND OTHER
 WATERFRONT TERMINALS SHOULD BE PERFORMED, AS IN EVERY OTHER MAJOR AMERI-
 CAN PORT, WITHOUT THE ABUSES OF THE PUBLIC LOADER  SYSTEM,  AND  BY  THE
 CARRIERS OF FREIGHT BY WATER, STEVEDORES AND OPERATORS OF SUCH PIERS AND
 OTHER WATERFRONT TERMINALS OR THE OPERATORS OF SUCH TRUCKS OR OTHER LAND
 VEHICLES.  THEREFORE, IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE TO REGU-
 LATE THE OCCUPATIONS OF LONGSHORE WORKERS, STEVEDORES, PIER  SUPERINTEN-
 DENTS,  HIRING  AGENTS,  AND  SECURITY OFFICERS, WHO ARE AFFECTED WITH A
 PUBLIC INTEREST, WHICH IS AN EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER OF THIS STATE.
 IT IS FURTHER IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THE METH-
 OD OF EMPLOYMENT OF LONGSHORE WORKERS AND SECURITY OFFICERS BE CONDUCTED
 THROUGH EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION CENTERS TO PREVENT GRAVE  INJURY  TO  THE
 WELFARE  OF WATERFRONT LABORERS AND OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE AND TO ENSURE
 THE PRESERVATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF  LABOR,  THE
 ECONOMIC  STABILITY  OF THE PORT OF NEW YORK DISTRICT IN THIS STATE, AND
 THE ADVANCEMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THEREIN.
  ALTHOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S EFFORTS AGAINST TRADITIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME
 INFLUENCE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL, SUCH  INFLUENCE  REMAINS  A  SIGNIFICANT
 THREAT  IN  THE  NEW  YORK  METROPOLITAN AREA, PARTICULARLY IN THE PORT.
 CONTINUED OVERSIGHT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE  FAIR  AND  NONDISCRIMINATORY
 HIRING  PRACTICES, TO ELIMINATE LABOR RACKETEERING AND THE VICTIMIZATION
 OF LEGITIMATE UNION MEMBERS AND PORT BUSINESSES, AND TO  PREVENT  ORGAN-
 IZED  CRIME  FIGURES  FROM  DIRECTLY OPERATING AT THE CRITICAL POINTS OF
 INTERSTATE AND INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING.
  TO PRESERVE THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE STATE, IT IS THE  INTENT  OF
 THIS  ACT  TO PREVENT AND ERADICATE MISMANAGEMENT, ABUSE OF LABOR, COER-
 CION, CORRUPTION,  PREVALENCE OF ORGANIZED  CRIME  AND  OTHER  CRIMINAL
 ACTIVITY,  TO  EXCLUDE OR REMOVE FROM THE PORT WORKFORCE INDIVIDUALS WHO
 WERE CONVICTED OF SERIOUS CRIMES OR WHO ASSOCIATE WITH  ORGANIZED  CRIME
 IN  VIOLATION  OF  THIS ACT, TO OVERCOME DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER UNFAIR
 HIRING PRACTICES, AND TO EXTIRPATE CORRUPTION AND  RACKETEERING  IN  THE
 PORT OF NEW  YORK DISTRICT IN THIS STATE.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would create the New York Waterfront Commission  and  revise
 the  Retirement and Social Security Law to make permanent the changes of
 Chapter 187 Laws of 2023, which added the  titles  of  investigator  and
 sworn  officer  employed  by the Waterfront Commission Act, to the defi-
 nition of membership in Section  381-b  including  making  such  service
 creditable  under  RSSL §381-b, and further expand creditable service to
 include service as an investigator-trainee.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we do not
 anticipate any additional cost to the State of New York or  the  partic-
 ipating  employers  in  the  New  York  State  and Local Police and Fire
 Retirement System.
  To the extent that new members gain coverage under  Section  381-b  of
 the  RSSL, we anticipate a contribution of 26.4% of salary paid to newly
 eligible members for the fiscal year ending March 31,  2025.  In  future
 years,  this  cost  will vary but is expected to average 20.6% of salary
 annually.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.

  Section 1. Expenditures  of  moneys  by  the  New  York  state  energy
 research  and  development  authority  for  services and expenses of the
 energy  research,  development  and  demonstration  program,  including
 grants,  the energy policy and planning program, and the Fuel NY program
 shall be subject to the provisions of this section.  Notwithstanding the
 provisions of subdivision 4-a of section 18-a of the public service law,
 all  moneys committed or expended in an amount not to exceed $28,725,000
 shall be reimbursed by assessment against gas corporations,  as  defined
 in  subdivision  11  of section 2 of the public service law and electric
 corporations as defined in subdivision 13 of section  2  of  the  public
 service  law, where such gas corporations and electric corporations have
 gross revenues from intrastate utility operations in excess of  $500,000
 in  the  preceding calendar year, and the total amount assessed shall be
 allocated to each electric corporation and gas corporation in proportion
 to its intrastate electricity and gas  revenues  in  the  calendar  year

 provisions of subdivision 2 of section 18-a of the public  service  law.
 The  chair  of  the public service commission shall bill such gas and/or
 electric corporations for such amounts on or before August 10, 2024  and
 such  amounts  shall  be  paid to the New York state energy research and
 development authority on or before September 10, 2024.  Upon  receipt,

 established pursuant to section 1859 of the public authorities law.  The
 New  York  state energy research and development authority is authorized
 and directed to: (1) transfer up to $4 million to the state general fund
 for climate change related services and expenses of  the  department  of
 environmental  conservation  from the funds received; and (2) commencing
 in 2016, provide to the chair of the public service commission  and  the
 director of the budget and the chairs and secretaries of the legislative
 fiscal  committees,  on or before August first of each year, an itemized
 record, certified by the president and chief executive  officer  of  the
 authority,  or  his  or her designee, detailing any and all expenditures
 and commitments ascribable to  moneys  received  as  a  result  of  this
 assessment  by the chair of the department of public service pursuant to
 section 18-a of the public service law.  This  itemized  record  shall
 include  an  itemized  breakdown  of  the  programs being funded by this
 section and the amount committed to each program.  The  authority  shall
 not  commit  for any expenditure, any moneys derived from the assessment
 provided for in this section, until the chair of  such  authority  shall
 have  submitted,  and  the director of the budget shall have approved, a
 comprehensive financial plan encompassing all moneys  available  to  and
 all  anticipated commitments and expenditures by such authority from any
 source for the operations of such authority.  Copies  of  the  approved
 comprehensive financial plan shall be immediately submitted by the chair
 to  the chairs and secretaries of the legislative fiscal committees. Any
 such amount not committed by such authority to contracts or contracts to
 be awarded or otherwise expended by the authority during the fiscal year
 shall be refunded by such authority on a  pro-rata  basis  to  such  gas
 and/or  electric  corporations,  in  a  manner  to  be determined by the
 department of public service, and any refund amounts must be  explicitly
 lined out in the itemized record described above.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to

  PART O
 S. 8308--C  53  A. 8808--C
 
  Section 1. Short title, legislative findings and declaration. This act
 shall be known and may be cited as the "renewable action through project
 interconnection and deployment (RAPID) act".  The  legislature  hereby
 finds and declares that:
  1. To timely achieve the renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction
 targets  established  pursuant  to  the climate leadership and community
 protection act ("CLCPA"), while contemporaneously maintaining the  reli-
 ability of the state's electric transmission system, action is needed to
 consolidate  and  expedite  the  environmental  review and permitting of
 major renewable energy facilities  and  major  electric  utility  trans-
 mission facilities.
  2.  Since  enactment  of  the  CLCPA,  it has become apparent that the
 State's bulk and local transmission facilities need to be  significantly
 upgraded  to  deliver  renewable  energy  to  load.  These significant
 upgrades in the bulk and local transmission system must be undertaken in
 an expedited timeframe consistent with  the  timeframe  to  achieve  the
 CLCPA targets.
  3.  In  the  context  of  achieving the CLCPA targets, a public policy
 purpose would be served and the interests of the people of the state  of
 New York would be advanced by transferring the Office of Renewable Ener-
 gy  Siting  ("ORES"),  currently under the auspices of the Department of
 State, to the Department of Public Service ("DPS")  and  providing  such
 office with additional responsibilities for the review and permitting of
 major electric transmission facilities as set forth in this act.
  4.  The legislature finds that such a transfer would combine the long-
 standing expertise of DPS related to transmission siting,  planning  and
 compliance  with  environmental  and  reliability  standards with ORES's
 expertise related to the siting of renewable energy resources and, in so
 doing, create synergies, and otherwise provide for more efficient siting
 of major renewable energy and transmission facilities.
  § 2. Section 94-c of the executive law is REPEALED.
  § 3. Transfer of Office of Renewable Energy Siting.  ORES,  an  office
 established  in  the  Department  of  State by the Accelerated Renewable
 Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act, enacted under part JJJ of chap-
 ter 58 of the laws of 2020, is hereby  transferred  to  and  established
 within  the  DPS,  and  shall  continue  to have all existing functions,
 powers, duties and obligations of ORES together with the new  additional
 functions, powers, duties and obligations set forth in this act.
  §  4.  Continuity  of  existing  functions, powers, duties and obli-
 gations.  All of the existing functions, powers, obligations, and duties
 granted to ORES by section 94-c of the executive law now  repealed,  are
 hereby  transferred,  and  shall be deemed to and held to constitute the
 continuation of such functions, powers, duties and obligations of  ORES,
 and not a different agency, authority, department or office.  All appli-
 cations  pending  before ORES on the effective date of this act shall be
 considered and treated as applications filed pursuant to this act as  of
 the date of filing of such applications.
  §  5.  Transfer of employees.  1. Upon the transfer of such functions,
 powers, duties and obligations pursuant to this act, provision shall  be
 made  for  the  transfer  of  all  employees of ORES situated within the
 department of state into DPS pursuant to subdivision 2 of section 70  of
 the  civil  service law.  Employees so transferred shall be transferred
 without further examination or qualification  to  the  same  or  similar
 titles,  shall  remain in the same collective bargaining units and shall
 retain their respective civil service classifications, status and rights
 S. 8308--C  54  A. 8808--C
 
 pursuant to their collective bargaining units and collective  bargaining
 agreements.
  2.  All  employees  hired  after the effective date of this act shall,
 consistent with the provisions of article 14 of the civil  service  law,
 be classified in the same bargaining units. Employees other than manage-
 ment  or  confidential  persons  as  defined  in article 14 of the civil
 service law serving positions in newly created titles shall be  assigned
 to  the  appropriate  bargaining unit. Nothing contained herein shall be
 construed to affect:
  (a) the rights of employees pursuant to a collective bargaining agree-
 ment; or
  (b) the representational relationships among employee organizations or

 fied pursuant to subdivision one of  section  19-0311  of  this  chapter
 S. 8308--C  81  A. 8808--C
 
 shall  submit  to the department an annual base fee of [two] EIGHT thou-
 sand five hundred dollars PER FACILITY.  This base fee shall be in addi-
 tion to the fees listed below.  Commencing  January  first,  [nineteen
 hundred  ninety-four]  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-SEVEN  and  every  year
 thereafter, all sources of regulated air contaminants identified  pursu-
 ant  to  subdivision one of section 19-0311 of this chapter shall submit
 to the department an annual fee not to exceed the per ton fees described
 below. The per ton fee is assessed on each ton of emissions [up to seven
 thousand tons annually] of each regulated air  contaminant  as  follows:
 [sixty]  TWO HUNDRED dollars per ton for facilities with total emissions
 less than one thousand tons annually; [seventy] TWO HUNDRED  TWENTY-FIVE
 dollars  per  ton for facilities with total emissions of one thousand or
 more but less than two thousand  tons  annually;  [eighty]  TWO  HUNDRED
 FIFTY  dollars  per ton for facilities with total emissions of two thou-
 sand or more but less than five thousand  tons  annually;  and  [ninety]
 THREE  HUNDRED  dollars  per  ton for facilities with total emissions of

 cient  to  support  an appropriation approved by the legislature for the
 direct and indirect costs associated with the operating  permit  program
 established in section 19-0311 of this chapter. Such [fee] FEES shall be
 established  by  the  department and shall be calculated by dividing the
 amount of the current  year  appropriation  from  the  operating  permit
 program  account of the clean air fund by the total tons of emissions of
 regulated air contaminants, INCLUDING HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS, that are
 subject to the operating permit program fees from sources subject to the
 operating permit program pursuant to section 19-0311 of this chapter [up
 to seven thousand tons annually of each regulated air  contaminant  from
 each  source]; provided that, in making such calculation, the department
 shall adjust their calculation to account for any deficit or surplus  in
 the  operating  permit program account of the clean air fund established
 pursuant to section ninety-seven-oo of the state finance law[; any  loan
 repayment  from  the  mobile source account of the clean air fund estab-
 lished pursuant to section ninety-seven-oo of the  state  finance  law;]
 and the rate of collection by the department of the bills issued for the
 [fee] FEES for the prior year.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of the state administrative procedure
 act, such calculation and [fee] FEES shall be established as a  rule  by
 publication  in  the  Environmental Notice Bulletin no later than thirty
 days after the budget bills making appropriations  for  the  support  of
 government  are  enacted  or July first, whichever is later, of the year
 such [fee] FEES will be effective. In no  event  shall  the  [fee]  FEES
 established herein be any greater than the maximum fee identified pursu-
 ant to this section.
  2.  Bills  issued for the [fee] FEES ESTABLISHED BY SUBDIVISION ONE OF
 THIS SECTION shall be based on actual emissions for the  prior  calendar
 year,  as  demonstrated  to  the  department's  satisfaction,  or in the
 absence of such demonstration, on permitted emissions, or,  where  there
 is  no permit, on potential to emit. Persons required to submit an emis-
 sions statement to the department shall use  such  statement  to  demon-
 strate actual emissions under this section.

  (2) The amount of any class  B  or  class  C  assessment,  except  for
 assessments  related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for
 assessment purposes among the accounts in the proportion that the premi-
 S. 8308--C  88  A. 8808--C
 
 ums received by the impaired or insolvent insurer  on  the  policies  or
 contracts  covered  by each account for the last calendar year preceding
 the assessment in which  the  impaired  or  insolvent  insurer  received

 PROFIT  MEMBER  INSURERS  IN  AN  AMOUNT  THAT,  WHEN  ACCOUNTING  FOR
 APPROPRIATE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VALUE OF THE TAX CREDITS AND A FACTOR
 FOR  THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY, RESULTS IN A PERCENTAGE OF NET ASSESSMENTS

  SUBPART B
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the  state
 university  of  New York at Buffalo ("UB") seeks to use a portion of the
 grounds and facilities on UB's campus for the purposes of the empire  AI
 consortium  to  create and launch a state-of-the-art artificial intelli-
 gence computing center. The legislature further finds that housing  this
 consortium  on the UB campus will allow the consortium to bring together
 artificial  intelligence  researchers  and  scientists  to  accelerate
 research  and  innovation.  Finally, the legislature finds that granting
 the trustees of the state university of New York the authority and power
 to lease and otherwise contract  to  make  available  such  grounds  and
 facilities  for  such  purpose will serve the interests of the people of
 New York state by  expanding  educational  and  research  opportunities,
 spurring innovation, and strengthening the economy.
  §  2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the state univer-
 sity trustees are authorized and empowered, without any public  bidding,
 to  lease  and  otherwise  contract  to  make available to the empire AI
 S. 8308--C  107  A. 8808--C
 
 consortium (the "ground lessee") a portion of the lands of the universi-
 ty generally described in  this  act  for  the  purpose  of  developing,
 constructing,  maintaining  and  operating  a  facility  situated on the
 campus  of  the  state  university of New York at Buffalo for use by the
 empire AI consortium, an artificial intelligence data science technology
 hub and computing center. The lease shall permit the construction  of  a
 facility  by  the university at Buffalo, its affiliates or related enti-
 ties at the direction of the consortium, or the  empire  AI  consortium.
 Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  act  to the contrary, the empire AI
 consortium and/or any subsidiary  of  such  consortium  is  specifically
 authorized  to  operate  on  the  leased  real  property.  Such lease or
 contract shall be without any fee simple conveyance and  otherwise  upon
 terms  and  conditions  determined  by  such  trustees,  subject  to the
 approval of the director of the division of  the  budget,  the  attorney
 general  and  the state comptroller. In the event that the real property
 that is the subject of such lease or contract shall cease to be used for
 the purpose described in this act, such lease or  contract  shall  imme-
 diately  terminate,  and  the real property and any improvements thereon
 shall revert to the state university of New York. Any lease or  contract
 entered  into  pursuant  to this act shall be for a period not exceeding
 twenty years, and provide that the real property that is the subject  of
 such  lease or contract and any improvements thereon shall revert to the
 state university of New York on  the  expiration  of  such  contract  or
 lease.

 deemed to be a state contract for purposes of article 15-A of the execu-
 tive law, and any contractor, subcontractor, lessee or sublessee  enter-
 ing into such contract or lease for the construction, demolition, recon-
 struction, excavation, rehabilitation, repair, renovation, alteration or
 improvement  authorized  pursuant  to  this  act shall be deemed a state
 agency for the purposes of article 15-A of the executive law and subject
 to the provisions of such article.
  § 4. Notwithstanding any general, special or  local  law  or  judicial
 decision  to the contrary, all work performed on a project authorized by
 this act where all or any portion thereof involves a lease or  agreement
 for  construction,  demolition,  reconstruction,  excavation,  rehabili-
 tation, repair, renovation, alteration or improvement  shall  be  deemed
 public work and shall be subject to and performed in accordance with the
 provisions  of  article 8 of the labor law to the same extent and in the
 same manner as a contract of the state,  and  compliance  with  all  the
 provisions  of  article  8  of  the  labor  law shall be required of any
 lessee, sublessee, contractor or subcontractor on the project, including
 the enforcement of prevailing wage requirements by the fiscal officer as
 defined in paragraph e of subdivision 5 of section 220 of the labor  law
 to the same extent as a contract of the state.
  §  5. Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the
 state university of New York shall not contract out to the ground lessee
 or any subsidiary for the instruction or any  pedagogical  functions  or
 services,  or  any  administrative  services,  and  similar professional
 services currently being exclusively performed by state  employees.  All
 such functions and services shall be performed by state employees pursu-
 ant  to  the  civil service law. Nothing in this act shall result in the
 displacement of any currently employed state worker or the loss of posi-
 tion (including partial displacement such as reduction in the  hours  of
 non-overtime, wages or employment benefits), or result in the impairment
 of  existing  contracts  for  services  or  collective bargaining rights

 bargaining  agreement  between  a  contractor  and a labor organization,
 establishing the labor organization as the collective bargaining  repre-
 sentative  for  all  persons  who  will perform work on the project, and
 which provides that only contractors and subcontractors who sign a  pre-
 negotiated  agreement  with  the  labor organization can perform project
 work.
  § 7. Nothing in this act shall be deemed to waive or impair any rights
 or benefits of employees of the state university of New York that other-
 wise would be available to them pursuant  to  the  terms  of  agreements
 between the certified representatives of such employees and the state of
 New  York  pursuant to article 14 of the civil service law, and all work
 performed on such property that ordinarily would be performed by employ-
 ees subject to article 14 of the civil service law shall continue to  be
 performed by such employees.
  §  8. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special, or local
 law or judicial decision  to  the  contrary,  the  ground  lessee  shall

 ments with regard to such grounds and facilities by the  ground  lessee,
 and  parties  contracting with the ground lessee, and in connection with
 such activities, the obtaining of funding or financing,  whether  public
 or private, unsecured or secured (including, but not limited to, secured
 by  leasehold  mortgages  and  assignments  of rents and leases), by the
 ground lessee and parties contracting with the  ground  lessee  for  the
 purposes of completing the project described in this act.
  §  10.  Such  lease  shall  include an indemnity provision whereby the
 lessee or sublessee promises to indemnify, hold harmless and defend  the
 lessor  against all claims, suits, actions, and liability to all persons
 on the leased premises, including tenant, tenant's agents,  contractors,
 subcontractors,  employees,  customers,  guests, licensees, invitees and
 members of the public, for damage to any such person's property, whether
 real or personal, or for personal injuries arising out of  tenant's  use
 or occupation of the demised premises.
  §  11.  Any  construction  contracts entered into pursuant to this act
 between the ground lessee and parties contracting with the ground lessee
 shall be awarded by a competitive process.

 lessee is generally described as within one of two parcels of real prop-
 erty  with  improvements  thereon consisting of a total of approximately
