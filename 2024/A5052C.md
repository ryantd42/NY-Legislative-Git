 Introduced  by M. of A. WOERNER -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law and the public  service  law,
  in relation to establishing a highway and depot charging action plan
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. In order to achieve targets set forth
 by the climate leadership and community protection  act,  zero-emissions
 vehicle sales target and regulations, including the advanced clean truck
 and advanced clean cars II rules, zero-emissions school bus mandate, and
 other  relevant goals, the interests of the people of the state would be
 served by:
  1. Coordinating efforts to plan  for  electric  vehicle  fast-charging
 deployment on New York's highways;
  2.  Identifying  priority  sites  for  the deployment of fast chargers
 along New York's highways, estimating future charging  demand  at  these
 sites  for  all vehicle classes, and identifying necessary electric grid
 transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  and  interconnection
 upgrades at these sites;
  3.  Expediting electric grid transmission and distribution infrastruc-
 ture and interconnection upgrades at sites controlled by  the  New  York
 state  thruway  authority,  sufficient to future-proof thruway sites for
 accelerated fast charger deployment to serve light duty, medium duty and
 heavy duty vehicles; and
  4.  Identifying additional high priority areas for the  deployment  of
 charging for medium and heavy duty vehicles, such as school buses, tran-
 sit  buses,  and  other  light,  medium  and heavy duty commercial fleet
 depots, and removing barriers to charging deployment, including electric
 infrastructure constraints.
  § 2. The public authorities law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 1885 to read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROMOTE CHARGING DEVELOPMENT.
  4.  IN  ESTABLISHING  THE  CAPITAL  PLAN, THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES SHALL

 ENERGY  STORAGE OR MANAGED CHARGING PROGRAMS. SUCH BENEFITS MAY INCLUDE,
 BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, LOWERING THE TOTAL COST  OF  THE  CAPITAL  PLAN,
 PROVIDING  INCREASED RESILIENCY AT A HIGHWAY CHARGING HUB, AND PROVIDING
 INTERIM SOLUTIONS TO ENABLE CHARGING DEPLOYMENT WHERE  GRID  INFRASTRUC-
 TURE  IS  NOT  YET IN PLACE. INTERCONNECTION, ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION, AND
 LOCAL TRANSMISSION UPGRADES IN THE  CAPITAL  PLAN  MAY  INCLUDE  UTILITY

  § 1020-gg. Energy plan. The authority shall complete a biennial energy
 plan in accordance with the provisions of article six of the energy law.
 In  addition  to  any requirements of article six of the energy law, the
 authority shall provide copies of its biennial energy plan to the gover-
 nor, the temporary president of the senate, the speaker of the assembly,
 the chair of the assembly committee on  energy  and  the  chair  of  the

 SERVICE  LAW.  THE AUTHORITY AND THE NEW YORK STATE ENERGY RESEARCH AND
 DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY SHALL IDENTIFY NO FEWER THAN TWO HIGHWAY  CHARGING
 HUBS IN THE AUTHORITY'S SERVICE TERRITORY WHERE FUTURE-PROOFING UPGRADES
 SHALL  BE  IMPLEMENTED  ON A SIMILAR TIMELINE AS AT THE THRUWAY CHARGING
