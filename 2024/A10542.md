 adopted plans for the area, and historic preservation requirements.

 the final plan.
  §  7.  Ownership of property. 1. Ownership interest of the receiver. A
 receiver appointed under section five of this act  shall  be  deemed  to
 have  an ownership interest in and legal control of the property for the

 A. 10542  8
 
 obtaining construction permits and other approvals and submitting appli-
 cations for financing or other assistance to public or private entities.
  2.  Liability  of owner. Notwithstanding the appointment of a receiver
 under section five of this act, nothing in this act shall  be  construed
 to  relieve the owner of any civil or criminal liability or of any obli-
 gation to pay taxes, municipal liens  and  charges,  mortgages,  private
 liens  or  other  fees  or charges, whether incurred before or after the
 appointment of the receiver and no such liability shall  be  transferred
 to the receiver.
  3.  Limitation of the receiver's environmental liability. (a) Notwith-
 standing any law to the contrary, the receiver shall not be held  liable
 for  any  environmental damage to the building or the real property upon
 which the building is located that existed prior to the  appointment  by
 the court of the receiver.
  (b)  Paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall not apply to the owner or
 any other person or entity regarding the building and its real  property
 that is subject to an appointed receiver under this act.
  §  8.  Incurring  indebtedness.  1.  Borrowing.  From  time to time, a
 receiver may borrow money or incur indebtedness in order  to  cover  the
 costs  of rehabilitation or otherwise fulfill the receiver's obligations
 under this act.
  2. Liens. In order to facilitate the borrowing of funds for the  costs
 of  rehabilitation,  the court may grant priority status to a lien given
 to secure payment on a debt incurred for purposes authorized under  this
 act, provided that:
  (a)  the  receiver  sought  to obtain the necessary financing from the
 senior, nongovernmental  lienholder,  but  the  lienholder  declined  to
 provide financing for reasonable improvements or other costs of rehabil-
 itation on reasonable terms; and
  (b)  lien  priority  is necessary in order to induce another lender to
 provide financing on reasonable terms.
  3. Lien status of rehabilitation expenses. Should the senior lienhold-
 er agree to provide financing for the costs of rehabilitation, any funds
 lent to cover the costs shall be  deemed  to  be  added  to  the  senior
 lienholder's preexisting first lien.
  4.  Approval  of  financing.  The  court may approve financing for the
 costs of rehabilitation, the terms of which may include deferred  repay-
 ment  and  use  restrictions. The terms of the financing may remain with
 the property after the receivership has ended and be assumed by  any  of
 the following:
  (a)  the  owner, if the owner regains possession of the property under
 section ten of this act; or
  (b) the buyer who takes title under section nine of this act.
  § 9. Sale of property. 1. Sale by owner or lienholder. If  a  property
 subject  to  receivership  is  sold by the owner or foreclosed upon by a
 lienholder or if any interest therein is transferred, such  sale,  fore-
 closure, or transfer shall be subject to the receivership.
  2.  Sale  by receiver. Upon application of the receiver, the court may
 order the sale of the property if the court finds that:
  (a) notice and an opportunity to provide  comment  to  the  court  was
 given to each record owner of the property and each lienholder;
  (b)  the  receiver  has  been in control of the building for more than
 three months and the owner has not successfully petitioned to  terminate
 the receivership under section ten of this act; and
  (c)  the  terms and conditions of the sale are acceptable to the court
 and the buyer has a reasonable likelihood of maintaining the property.
 A. 10542  9

  3. Sale free and clear. (a) The court may authorize  the  receiver  to
 sell the building free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances,
 provided  that  the  proceeds  of  the  sale are distributed pursuant to
 subdivision four of this section at settlement.
  (b) In the event that the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to pay
 all  existing  liens,  claims,  and  encumbrances, the proceeds shall be
 distributed according to the priorities set forth in subdivision four of
 this section and all unpaid liens, claims, or  encumbrances  which  have
 not  been  assumed  under  subdivision four of section eight of this act
 shall be extinguished.
  4. Distribution. The proceeds of the sale shall be applied in  accord-
 ance with the following priorities to:
  (a) all court costs;
  (b)  liens  of the state, liens for unpaid property taxes and properly
 recorded municipal liens;
  (c) costs and expenses of sale;
  (d) principal and interest on any borrowing or incurrence  of  indebt-
 edness granted priority over existing liens and security interests under
 subdivision two of section eight of this act;
  (e) costs incurred by the petitioner in preparing and filing the peti-
 tion in accordance with the requirements of section four of this act;
  (f)  costs of rehabilitation and any fees and expenses incurred by the
 receiver in connection with the sale or the safeguarding of the property
 for which the lien authorized under subdivision seven of section five of
 this act was filed;
  (g) valid liens and security interests in accordance with their prior-
 ity;
  (h) any unpaid obligations of the receiver; and
  (i) the owner.
  5. Owner's proceeds as unclaimed property.  In  the  event  the  owner
 cannot  be located, any proceeds from the sale which belong to the owner
 shall be presumed to be abandoned and unclaimed and shall be subject  to
 the  custody  and  control of the New York state comptroller's office of
 unclaimed funds pursuant to the abandoned property law.
  § 10. Termination of the receivership. Upon  request  of  a  party  in
 interest  or  the  receiver,  the court may order the termination of the
 receivership if it determines:
  1. The conditions that were the grounds for the petition and all other
 code violations have been abated  or  corrected,  and  the  obligations,
 expenses,  and  improvements of the receivership, including all fees and
 expenses of the receiver, have been fully paid or provided for  and  the
 purposes of the receivership have been fulfilled;
  2.  The owner, mortgagee, or lienholder has requested that the receiv-
 ership be terminated and has provided adequate assurances to  the  court

 promptly abated, all obligations,  expenses,  and  improvements  of  the
 receivership  including all fees and expenses of the receiver, have been
 fully paid or provided for and the purposes  of  the  receivership  have
 been fulfilled;
