  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom of this Legislative Body to foster the

commitment  to  advancing  the  safety and advocacy for individuals with
disabilities across this great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the Resource Center for  Independent
Living (RCIL); and
 
  WHEREAS,  Individuals  and  organizations  devoted  to improving the
quality of life for others, enabling them to build lives of dignity  and
self-worth are deserving of the highest praise and recognition; and
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time, society calls upon these individuals and
organizations  to  be  recognized  for  the  significance  of  their
contributions and efforts to assist  others  in  developing  the  skills
necessary to be successful, productive citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  October  13, 1983, RCIL has served the residents of

other services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  RCIL  mission  is  to  ensure  a  fully  accessible,
integrated  society  that  enables  full  participation  by  people with
disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Promoting a  dynamic  environment  where  society  and  the
individual  benefit  from a world with no limitations, the RCIL achieves
excellence in consumer-controlled, self-directed services  in  programs,
education,  advocacy,  research,  and  information  retrieval  and

  WHEREAS, The  services  provided  by  the  RCIL  are  geared  toward
increasing  awareness  of an individual's rights and options, as well as
the various methods to achieve desired goals; and
 
  WHEREAS, The core values of the RCIL are based upon the belief  that
the  widespread  poverty,  segregation,  and  isolation  of  people with
disabilities is unacceptable, should  not  be  tolerated,  and  requires
change;  the  RCIL  has answered the call to this issue and works toward
making positive systemic changes through education  and  legislation  to
provide  full  access,  power,  and  self-determination  to  those  with
disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a focus on integration, assisting people  reach  their
greatest  potential,  and  a  culture  that  encourages  risk-taking,
creativity, and innovation, the RCIL is an organization that adheres  to
 
a  code  of  ethics mandating respect, appreciation, honesty, integrity,
empathy, trust, and accountability; and
 
  WHEREAS, With unwavering commitment to their community, the Resource
Center  for Independent Living listens to its clients and their families
to help create a plan for individuals to live out the life they  imagine
for themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This occasion presents an opportunity for this Legislative
Body to recognize and pay tribute to the Resource Center for Independent
Living  for  their  commendable  commitment  to  the  Utica,  New  York
