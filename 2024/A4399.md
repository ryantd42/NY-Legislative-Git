 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  FITZPATRICK -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Housing
 
 AN ACT to amend the private housing finance law, in relation to creating
  a demonstration program establishing a system of community improvement
  grants to  be  administered  by  and  through  neighborhood  citizens'
  participation committees

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The private housing finance law is amended by adding a  new
 article 6-B to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 6-B
  DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM: CITIZENS' PARTICIPATION COMMITTEES
 SECTION 270. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
  271. DEFINITIONS.
  272. COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT GRANTS.
  273. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.
  §  270. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES
 THAT IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE STATE A SUPPLY OF HOUSING STOCK IN EXCESS
 OF THAT NEEDED BY THE POPULATION OF THOSE  REGIONS  HAS  ACCUMULATED  IN
 RECENT YEARS, MUCH OF WHICH IS OLD, DETERIORATED, SUBSTANDARD, UNMARKET-
 ABLE, AND OFTEN ABANDONED.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER  FINDS  THAT  THIS  EXCESS HOUSING HAS HAD A
 BLIGHTING EFFECT UPON THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT  IS  LOCATED,  REDUCES
 THE  VALUE  OF OTHER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBOR-
 HOODS, AND MAY CAUSE PERSONS, FAMILIES, AND BUSINESSES TO ABANDON  THOSE
 MUNICIPALITIES  CONTAINING AN OVERABUNDANCE OF EXCESS AND BLIGHTED HOUS-
 ING STOCK.
  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT IT IS IN  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST  TO
 ENCOURAGE PERSONS, FAMILIES, AND BUSINESSES TO LOCATE OR REMAIN IN THOSE
 MUNICIPALITIES,  IN ORDER TO BOTH UTILIZE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK AND TO
 PRESERVE THE OPEN SPACES OF THE STATE, AND THAT IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 LIFE WITHIN THOSE MUNICIPALITIES IS A MOST EFFECTIVE  METHOD  OF  ACCOM-
 PLISHING  THIS GOAL. IN ADDITION, DECLINING HOME VALUES IN THESE MUNICI-
 PALITIES DISCOURAGES HOME OWNERSHIP BY ADVERSELY AFFECTING  THE  ABILITY
 OF  FAMILIES OF MODERATE INCOME TO BUILD AND/OR MAINTAIN EQUITY IN THEIR
 HOMES.
  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT THE RESIDENTS OF  A  COMMUNITY  ARE
 OFTEN  IN  THE  BEST  POSITION TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THEIR
 COMMUNITY, AND HAVE THE GREATEST STAKE IN THE FUTURE OF THEIR COMMUNITY.
  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT NO STATE PROGRAM  PRESENTLY  EXISTS
 WITH  THE  PRIMARY  PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING AND FUNDING THE IDENTIFICATION
 AND DEMOLITION OF SURPLUS HOUSING STOCK OR FOR  DISPOSING  OF  THE  REAL
 ESTATE UPON WHICH THAT HOUSING STOCK IS LOCATED.
