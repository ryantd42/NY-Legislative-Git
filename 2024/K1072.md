  HONORING  Christine  Vollmer  and  Karen  Fedor in
  recognition of their heroic actions  in  saving  the
  life of an elderly man on March 11, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring, concern and heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action in emergency situations, remaining calm
under pressure, in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Christine Vollmer and Karen Fedor in recognition of their heroic actions
in saving the life of an elderly man on Monday, March 11, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Westmoreland Central School District Bus Driver Karen Fedor
and  Bus  Aide Christine Vollmer had just dropped off their last student
on Monday, March 11, 2024, and were driving back to  their  garage  when
Christine  noticed  an  elderly man lying in his driveway and instructed
Karen to stop the bus; and
 
  WHEREAS, Without hesitation, Christine Vollmer ran from the bus  and
checked  the  man's  pulse  before  running back to the bus to ask Karen
Fedor to dial  911;  Christine  performed  CPR  until  first  responders
arrived on the scene; and
 
  WHEREAS, The man regained his pulse by the time EMTs took him to the
hospital; he is expected to make a full recovery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Justly  recognized  as  heroes,  these extraordinary women
should be meritoriously commended for remaining calm under pressure  and
for  showing  valor and true courage while performing a lifesaving deed;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Through their spontaneous  and  heroic  actions,  Christine
Vollmer  and  Karen  Fedor  demonstrated  their  character  and  their
compassion for the welfare of others, personifying, by virtue  of  their
actions,  the collective concern of citizens across the community of New
York State who voluntarily respond without  the  thought  of  danger  or
reward when others are in need of help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Christine Vollmer and Karen Fedor in recognition of  their  heroic
actions  in  saving the life of an elderly man on March 11, 2024; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Christine Vollmer and Karen Fedor.
