BY: Senator MATTERA
 
  COMMENDING  William Parmenter upon the occasion of
  his designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Shane  Mathis upon the occasion of his designation as recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established  by
Resolution  and  is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have merited special
commendation for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf  of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  Wednesday, July 3, 2024, William Parmenter, along with
his friends and son, was fishing over 80  miles  due  south  of  Hampton
Bays,  New  York  when  he heard a frantic mayday call over his vessel's
radio; the emergency request for help indicated a man profusely bleeding
from lacerations in his leg; and
 
  WHEREAS, With extensive knowledge in emergency  first  response  and
maritime  travel,  William  Parmenter  sprang to action, racing his boat
approximately 5 miles away to the coordinates of  the  vessel  in  need;
once  anchored  next  to  the vessel in need, he jumped aboard and began
treating the man in need with tourniquets to stop  the  bleeding  caused
from large fish hooks stuck in his leg; and
 
  WHEREAS,  William  Parmenter,  utilizing  the combined training he'd
received from the U.S. Coast Guard, the  State  of  New  York,  and  the
Suffolk  County  Police  Department,  was  able  to  properly  apply the
emergency  tourniquets  to  both  of  the  victim's  legs;  his  action
effectively  slowed  the  bleeding  and  activated  the  body's  natural
clotting process, which is necessary for a wound to heal; and
 
  WHEREAS, As  soon  as  the  man  in  need  was  stabilized,  William
Parmenter  radioed  both the Suffolk County Police Department's Aviation
Section and the U.S. Coast Guard Command Center, providing both entities
with a status update on the victim's condition, while the owner  of  the
boat  headed  straight  towards  the Shinnecock Inlet, heading closer to
land; and
 
  WHEREAS, An aviation survival  technician  from  the  United  States
Coast  Guard  later dropped from a helicopter to further help with first
aid and to arrange the medical evacuation; the  victim  was  resultantly
airlifted  and  flown  to  Stony  Brook University Hospital where he was
 
released the very next day, due in part  to  the  prompt  and  effective
response of William Parmenter; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  member  of  the  Suffolk County Police Department since
October 2023, William Parmenter now serves  as  a  P.O.  in  the  Second
Precinct,  located in Huntington, New York; prior to his service in this
capacity, he was an active member  of  the  United  States  Coast  Guard
(U.S.C.G.) for nine years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  William  Parmenter  is  an  avid seaman and has earned his
100-Ton Master Captain's License, one of the highest  levels  a  mariner
can  reach,  requiring  extensive  training and knowledge to satisfy all
requirements of the U.S.C.G. National Maritime Center; he  also  trained
extensively,  and  fulfilled  all  his  requirements, to earn his expert
status as a New York State certified EMT; and
 
  WHEREAS, A truly brave and courageous man, William Parmenter  played
a  vital role in this extraordinary rescue effort, and should be praised
by the people of this great Empire  State  for  his  astute  actions  in
working to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  William  Parmenter, in his spontaneous and heroic act, has
so aptly demonstrated his character and compassion for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without  thought of danger or reward when others are in need of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  William  Parmenter  upon  the  occasion  of  his designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to William Parmenter.
