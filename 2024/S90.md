 expulsion of [such fetus] A FETUS OF  ANY  GESTATIONAL  AGE,  by  filing

 district in which the fetal death occurred.
  3. IN THE CASE OF A SPONTANEOUS FETAL DEATH AT  ANY  GESTATIONAL  AGE,
 THE  ATTENDING  PHYSICIAN  OR  A PERSON DESIGNATED BY THE HOSPITAL SHALL

 CREMATION OF THE FETAL REMAINS.

 as a birth and as a death except that, for a fetal death, separate birth
 and death  certificates  shall  not  be  required  to  be  prepared  and
