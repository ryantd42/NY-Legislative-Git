  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 7-13, 2023, as Heart Rhythm Week in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 7-13, 2023, as Heart
Rhythm Week in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of World Heart Rhythm Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Organized by the Arrhythmia Alliance,  World  Heart  Rhythm
Week is a chance for people across the globe to take part in the world's
biggest  awareness  campaign  about  arrhythmias  and  the importance of
understanding our heart rates; and
 
  WHEREAS, Arrhythmias,  also  known  as  cardiac  arrhythmias,  heart
arrhythmias, or dysrhythmias, are irregularities of the heartbeat, which
include conditions where the heartbeat is too fast or too slow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tachycardia  is  used  to describe heartbeats that are too
fast, above 100 beats per  minute  in  adults,  and  bradycardia,  which
refers to a significantly slow heart rate below 60 beats per minute; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ventricular  fibrillation  is  the  deadliest heart rhythm
during which your ventricles quiver with your atria, thereby,  hindering
blood supply throughout your body, including heart muscles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Symptoms  may include palpitations or a feeling of a pause
between heartbeats,  however,  certain  types  of  arrhythmias  have  no
symptoms; in more serious cases, lightheadedness, passing out, shortness
of breath, or chest pain, among others, may occur; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  vast majority of arrhythmia cases are readily managed
and cured, though some individuals have complications such as stroke  or
heart  failure,  and  sometimes  death;  arrhythmia  can  also  occur in
children, and regular smokers are prone to it; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the past four  decades,  there  has  been  significant
progress  in  efforts  to understand and manage cardiac arrhythmias; the
combination of programmed  electrical  stimulation  of  the  heart  with
intracardiac  activation  reading  and  recording  was  an  important
development in this effort near the end of the 1960s; and
 
  WHEREAS, This procedure helped in the localization of the exact site
of the obstruction in the atrioventricular conduction system in patients
suffering from bradycardia and the identification of the  original  site
and the mechanism of supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Everyone  experiences  arrhythmia  at  some point in their
lives; while it may be harmless for those free of  heart  disease,  some
irregular heartbeats can be serious or fatal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One-fifth  of  all  arrhythmic  deaths  are  sudden  and
unexpected; the most important issue remains focusing on the  prevention
of the occurrence of these unnecessary deaths; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are many ways for individuals to get involved, from
getting their heart examined, donating to the  cause,  making  time  for
more physical exercise, to learning more about the condition and sharing
their knowledge with others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this devastating medical condition and more must  be  done  to  increase
activity  at  the  local, state and national levels to promote screening
and support patients and their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 7-13, 2023, as Heart
Rhythm Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York, and to the Arrhythmia Alliance.
