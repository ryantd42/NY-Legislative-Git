  2.  Where a proceeding is commenced pursuant to this article to review
 the assessment of a parcel of real property which solely contains  prop-
 erty  which  is not subject to the provisions of subdivision one of this
 section, a note of issue shall be filed in accordance with this subdivi-

  (a) Where a real property assessment challenge  commenced  under  this
 article  has  been  pending for at least [two years] SIX MONTHS from the
