 AN ACT to authorize the city of Binghamton to offer an optional  twenty-
  five year retirement plan to firefighter Scott Pavlick
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the city of Binghamton, in the county of Broome, a participating employ-
 er in the New York state and local police and  fire  retirement  system,
 which  previously elected to offer the optional twenty-five year retire-
 ment plan, established pursuant to section 384  of  the  retirement  and
 social  security  law,  to firefighters employed by such city, is hereby
 authorized to  make  participation  in  such  plan  available  to  Scott
 Pavlick,  a  firefighter  employed  by  the city of Binghamton, who, for
 reasons not ascribable to his own negligence, failed to  make  a  timely
 application  to participate in such optional twenty-five year retirement
 plan. The city of Binghamton may so elect by filing with the state comp-
 troller, within nine months of the effective date of this act, a  resol-
 ution  of  its  own common council together with certification that such
 firefighter did not bar himself from participation  in  such  retirement
 plan as a result of his own negligence. Thereafter, such firefighter may
 elect  to  be covered by the provisions of section 384 of the retirement
 and social security law, and shall be entitled to the  full  rights  and
 benefits  associated  with  coverage  under  such  section,  by filing a
 request to that effect with the state comptroller within one year of the
 effective date of this act.
  § 2. All employer past service costs associated with implementing  the
 provisions  of this act shall be borne by the city of Binghamton and may
 be amortized over a ten year period.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  This bill would allow the City of Binghamton to elect  to  reopen  the
 provisions  of section 384 of the Retirement and Social Security Law for
 firefighter Scott Pavlick.
  If  this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session and Scott
 Pavlick becomes covered under the provisions of section 384,  we  antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $5,300 in the
 annual contributions of the City  of  Binghamton  for  the  fiscal  year
 ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the bill-
 ing rates and salary of Scott Pavlick change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $42,500 which will be
 borne by the City of Binghamton as a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes  that  payment  will be made on February 1, 2024. If the City of
 Binghamton elects to amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the  cost
 for the first year including interest would be $5,420.
