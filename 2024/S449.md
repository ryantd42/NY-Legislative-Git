 WITHOUT ARRAIGNMENT, WAS AVOIDABLE, UNNECESSARY AND UNLAWFUL AS  DEFINED
 IN  SECTION  140.20 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, UNTIL AND UNLESS SUCH
 PRESUMPTION IS REBUTTED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE  OF  COMPELLING
 FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCE DEMONSTRATING THAT SUCH DELAY WAS UNAVOIDABLE AND
 ACTUALLY  NECESSARY  FOR  EACH  INDIVIDUAL  PETITIONER IDENTIFIED IN THE
