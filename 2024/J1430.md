Senate Resolution No. 1430
 
BY: Senator RYAN
 
  COMMENDING Jayden Gersitz upon the occasion of his
  designation  as  recipient  of  a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in emergency  situations,  acting  swiftly
and selflessly to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Jayden Gersitz of Tonawanda, New York, upon the occasion of his
designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor  bestowed
upon an individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Responding  without  hesitation,  Jayden  Gersitz,  a
fifth-grade student at Franklin Middle School, was riding his bicycle to
an  after-school  baseball  game  when  he was met by his cousin who was
rushing to retrieve the emergency fire department radio in his  father's
truck;  a  spectator  of the sporting event had a medical emergency, and
the radio was needed to call paramedics; and
 
  WHEREAS, After securing the radio, Jayden Gersitz  delivered  it  by
bicycle  to  his  uncle,  who  in  turn called emergency responders; the
paramedics arrived but  parked  in  a  different  parking  area;  Jayden
Gersitz,  thinking  quickly,  hopped  on his bike again and sped over to
where the ambulance was located  and  directed  the  paramedics  to  the
correct location, truly making a positive difference in their ability to
respond efficiently; and
 
  WHEREAS, This act of selflessness has resulted in Jayden Gersitz now
carrying  a  small pager radio with him in case of an emergency; even in
his adolescence, he is already following in the footsteps of his father,
a Kenilworth Fire Department firefighter;  Jayden  Gersitz  has  already
taken  part in various activities at the fire station, observed numerous
drills, and even has his own locker and tasks at the station; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jayden Gersitz, in his spontaneous and heroic act,  has  so
aptly  demonstrated  his  character  and  compassion  for the welfare of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond without thought of danger or reward when others need help;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Jayden Gersitz upon the occasion of his designation as recipient
 
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Jayden Gersitz.
