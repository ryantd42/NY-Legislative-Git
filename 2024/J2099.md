  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proud  to  commemorate  the  100th
Anniversary  of the Libson Volunteer Fire Department to be celebrated at
its Annual Banquet on Saturday, May 4, 2024, at the Quality of Work Life
Building in Ogdensburg, New York, and to  honor  its  past  and  present
firefighting members for 100 years of fire protection to the citizens of
Libson, New York, and its surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection services in every locality of our State; during the past  100
years,  the  courageous and devoted firefighters of the Libson Volunteer
Fire  Department  have  valiantly  responded  to  all  types  of  fire
emergencies  and  have won the praise and respect of the community which
they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established on December 5, 1923, the Lisbon Volunteer  Fire
Department  is  an  all-volunteer fire department in the Town of Lisbon,
St.  Lawrence County, State of New York, and serves a rural community of
approximately 3,200 residences; its response area is  100  square  miles
and  borders  12.5  miles  of  the  St.  Lawrence  River shared with the
Providence of Ontario, Canada; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  department's  earliest  roster  shows  a  starting
membership  of 31 volunteers, and the first firefighting apparatus was a
used motorized soda-acid chemical truck from the early 1900s; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 29, 1928, the  Libson  Volunteer  Fire  Department
held  its  First  Annual Banquet honoring its members at the Town Public
Library; during this time, fire trucks were housed in a two-stall garage
on Main Street, County Route 10 at the current site of the Town  Clerk's
Office; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  department  was  incorporated as the Lisbon Volunteer
Fire Corporation on March 12, 1952, and six years later, the  first  new
fire  engine,  a  1958  Chevrolet pumper, was purchased; in the 1960s, a
used ambulance  was  acquired  and  the  departments  Emergency  Medical
Services were formed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1966, the current property of 7002 County Route 10 was
acquired and a metal building was erected  to  house  up  to  four  fire
trucks;  in  2002,  an  expansion  and  upgrade  were  completed and the
facility now houses 10 emergency response vehicles; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a membership of dedicated firefighters, the record  of
the  Libson  Volunteer  Fire  Department  in  public  service  and  fire
protection is one to be envied; for 24 hours a day, for 365 days a year,
for 100 years, whenever the alarm sounded, these noble  volunteers  left
their homes and went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave  firefighters  of  the  Libson  Volunteer  Fire
Department are prepared to risk their lives every day to help  save  the
lives  of  others and to protect homes and property from the destruction
caused by fire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to the skill and devoted service demonstrated
by  individual  firefighters,  the  Libson  Volunteer  Fire  Department
reflects  the  history and development of firefighting over the past 100
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
good works performed by the volunteer fire  departments  of  this  great
Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
proudly commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Libson  Volunteer  Fire
Department to be celebrated on May 4, 2024; and be it further

transmitted to the Libson Volunteer Fire Department.
