 of  service  credit  allowed  by  the  retirement plan in which they are
 enrolled. The state comptroller shall promulgate such regulations as may
 be necessary and appropriate with  respect  to  the  deduction  of  such
 contribution  from members' wages and for the maintenance of any special
 fund or funds with respect to amounts so contributed. In  no  way  shall
 the  member  contributions  made  pursuant  to  this  section be used to
 provide for pension increases or annuities of any kind.

 chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  Employee  contributions.  In  the  case  of any electing employee,
 contributions at the rate of three per centum of his state salary  shall
 be  deducted  by  the  state  comptroller  as the employee contribution,
 provided however, that such employee contribution shall be made  by  the
 state  in  accordance  with  subdivision one of this section during such
 period as (a) either section seventy-a  of  the  retirement  and  social
 security law or section five hundred twenty-eight of this title provides
 that  the  contribution  of each member of the New York state employees'
 retirement system or the New York state teachers' retirement  system  in
 the employ of the state shall be reduced by at least eight per centum of
 his  compensation,  or  (b) employee contributions to either such system
 are no longer required by reason of such system becoming noncontributory
 for state employees.
  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, [beginning April first,
 two thousand thirteen any electing employee appointed on or after  April
 first,  two  thousand twelve, the rate at which each such employee shall
 contribute in any current plan year (January first to  December  thirty-
 first)  shall  be determined by reference to the wages of such member in

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would change the member contribution  rates,  and  the  wage
 ranges  to  which  member  contribution  rates  are  applied, for Tier 6
 members effective April 1, 2024.
  The proposed contribution rates and wage ranges  for  Tier  6  members
 are:
  * three (3) percent for wages of $75,000 or less,
  *  four (4) percent for wages greater than $75,000 but not more than
 $100,000, or
  * five (5) percent for wages greater than $100,000.
  The current contribution rates and wage ranges for Tier 6 members are:
  * three (3) percent for wages of $45,000 or less,
  * three and one-half (3.5) percent for wages  greater  than  $45,000
 but not more than $55,000,
  * four and one-half (4.5) percent for wages greater than $55,000 but
 not more than $75,000,
  *  five  and  three-quarters  (5.75)  percent for wages greater than
 $75,000 but not more than $100,000, or
  * six (6) percent for wages greater than $100,000.
  It is anticipated that this proposal will not become law  until  after
 the  effective  date of April 1, 2024, in which case member contribution
 rates will need to be revised retroactively. This will result in signif-
 icant administrative costs to the New York State  and  Local  Retirement
 System and its more than 3,000 participating employers.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), if this legislation is enacted  during  the
 2024  Legislative  Session,  there  would  be an increase in the present
 value of future costs of  approximately  $1.6  billion  which  would  be
 shared by the State of New York and all local participating employers in
 the  NYSLERS.  These  costs  will be funded by increasing Tier 6 billing
 rates by an average 0.9% of salary.
  The increased billing rates will result  in  a  recurring,  increasing
 annual  contribution  beginning in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026
 of approximately $67 million to the State of New York and  approximately
 $90 million to local participating employers in the NYSLERS. THESE ANNU-
 AL COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FUTURE YEARS and will
 S. 8757  13
 
 vary  by  employer  based  upon the plan coverage and salary reported in
 Tier 6.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), if this legislation is enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, there would be an increase in the  present
 value  of  future  costs  of  approximately  $255 million which would be
 shared by the State of New York and all local participating employers in
 the NYSLPFRS. These costs will be funded by increasing  Tier  6  billing
 rates by an average 1.0% of salary.
  The  increased  billing  rates  will result in a recurring, increasing
 annual contribution beginning in the fiscal year ending March  31,  2026
 of  approximately  $5 million to the State of New York and approximately
 $18 million to local participating  employers  in  the  NYSLPFRS.  THESE
 ANNUAL  COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FUTURE YEARS and
 will vary by employer based upon the plan coverage and  salary  reported
 in Tier 6.
  These  estimated costs are based on 265,533 Tier 6 members with annual
 salary of approximately $12 billion in the NYSLERS  and  16,538  Tier  6
 members  with  annual  salary  of  approximately  $1.5  billion  in  the
 NYSLPFRS, as of March 31, 2023.
  Summary of relevant resources:

 al  valuation.  Distributions  and  other statistics can be found in the
 2023 Report of the Actuary and the 2023 Annual  Comprehensive  Financial
 Report.
  The  actuarial  assumptions and methods used are described in the 2023

  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate,  dated March 4, 2024, and intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No.  2024-96,  prepared  by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend various sections of the Retirement and Social
 Security Law and the Education  Law  to  reduce  the  required  employee
 contribution for Tier 6 members. The salary ranges and employee contrib-
 ution  rates  for Tier 6 members would be changed to the following as of
 April 1, 2024:
  Salary  Employee Contribution Rate
 $75,000 and less  3.00%
 More than $75,000 to $100,000  4.00%
 More than $100,000  5.00%
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System  for this benefit is estimated to be $81.5
 million or 0.42% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer  contribution
 rate  that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without any
 S. 8757  14
 
 assets, is equal to 5.31% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture. This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost  of
 Tier  6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed change
 to  the  Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new entrant rate
 is estimated to increase to 6.13% of pay, an increase of 0.82% of pay.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can
 be found in the System's Annual Report for fiscal year  ended  June  30,
 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial statements
 and  can also be found in the System's Annual Report.  Actuarial assump-
 tions and methods are  provided  in  the  System's  Actuarial  Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.

 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2024
 Legislative Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary  for  the

  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary

 impacted population is summarized below.

 - Average Service:  4.4  5.0  4.0
 - Average Salary:  78,900  80,000  56,200
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS: Currently, Tier 6 members of NYCERS,
 TRS, and BERS are generally required to make Basic Member  Contributions
 (BMC)  ranging from 3% to 6% of annual wages, determined by the member's
 annual wages for the second prior calendar year.
  Under the proposed legislation, effective April 1, 2024:
  * The required BMC rates for each salary band above $45,000  would  be
 reduced as shown in the table below.
 
  Salary Band  Current Rate  Proposed Rate
  $45,000 or less  3.00%  3.00%
  $45,001 up to $55,000  3.50%  3.00%
  $55,001 up to $75,000  4.50%  3.00%
  $75,001 up to $100,000  5.75%  4.00%
  Greater than $100,000  6.00%  5.00%
 
  *  The determination of the member's rate will use a one-year lookback
 instead of a two-year lookback.
  * The annual wages used for the determination of the  member's  salary
 band  would exclude overtime and compensation earned for extracurricular
 activities for all years. Currently, this exclusion is set to expire  on
 January 1, 2025.
 S. 8757  16
 
  *  New  members  would  use a projection of wages for their first year
 instead of their first three years.
  For  purposes  of  this  Fiscal Note, it has been assumed that members
 will retain rights to current rules  for  determining  the  contribution
 rate  for  a  given calendar year if they result in a lower contribution
 rate than under the proposed legislation.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
