  COMMEMORATING  the 75th Anniversary of the Village
  Library of Cooperstown
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the communities  across  the  great
State of New York is reflective of certain exemplary organizations whose
purpose  is  dedicated  to  serving  the  community and the needs of its
citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Village Library of  Cooperstown;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Village  of Cooperstown supported a myriad of private
libraries until the Village Library of Cooperstown was established at 22
Main Street in 1898; funded by Elizabeth Scriven Clark as a gift to  her
son,  Robert  Sterling  Clark,  the intention was for the building to be
utilized as a YMCA, library, and museum; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1932, Robert Sterling Clark donated the building to  the
village; the Women's Club of Cooperstown supported the library from 1939
until its charter by the State of New York in 1949; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Village Library of Cooperstown joined the Four County
Library System (4CLS), a consortium of 42  public  libraries,  in  1964;
members  may check out books from any library in the four-county service
area and today, the library has a choice of a total of  23,186  physical
items in their collection to choose from; and
 
  WHEREAS, In May of 2014, the Village Library of Cooperstown received
a  more  consistent  and  stable  support  through  school district levy
funding; the library is now chartered to  serve  the  residents  of  the
Cooperstown Central School District; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originally  housed  in  the circulation and main room, the
Village Library of Cooperstown has since expanded  across  the  hall  to
include  a  children's room and the Director's office in 1978, and later
added a large print book area in 1991; and
 
  WHEREAS, Growing from humble  beginnings,  the  Village  Library  of
Cooperstown held 157 programs, with over 3900 in attendance in 2023; the
library  hosts weekly sensory play sessions and a baby and toddler story
time, along with  monthly  book  clubs,  special  book  related  events,
lectures, and their long-standing Sunday Speaker Series; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Providing over 144,000 users with wireless internet access
annually,  the  Village  Library  of  Cooperstown  works  to  maintain
traditional  and  modern  library  services, including print and digital
books; databases; computers and expanded WIFI  access;  lendable  laptop
kits; and many other initiatives to serve the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A vital part of its community, this remarkable institution
has continually strived to  provide  outstanding  service,  focusing  on
education,  recreation, and social inclusion, to a diverse population of
neighborhood residents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success enjoyed by the Village Library of Cooperstown
is in direct correlation to the efforts of the  Board  of  Trustees  and
many  individuals who have supported the development of the library over
the years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud and distinguished history,  the  Village
Library  of Cooperstown may take just pride in its purposeful growth, as
it looks forward to continuing to serve the  educational,  cultural  and
intellectual needs of the community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
