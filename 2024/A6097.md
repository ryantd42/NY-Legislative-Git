 death  of, the victim, and (c) criminal justice agency records show that
 such crime was promptly reported to the proper authorities;  and  in  no
 case may an award be made where the criminal justice agency records show
 that  such  report  was  made more than one week after the occurrence of
 such crime unless the office, for good cause shown, finds the  delay  to

 subdivision, in cases involving an alleged sex offense as  contained  in
 article  one  hundred  thirty  of  the penal law or incest as defined in

 chargeable  as  a  family  offense as described in section eight hundred
 twelve of the family court act or section 530.11 of the criminal  proce-
 dure  law, the criminal justice agency report need only be made within a
 reasonable  time  considering  all  the  circumstances,  including  the
 victim's  physical, emotional and mental condition and family situation.
 For the purposes of this subdivision, "criminal  justice  agency"  shall
 include,  but  not be limited to, a police department, a district attor-
 ney's office, and any other governmental  agency  having  responsibility
 for the enforcement of the criminal laws of the state provided, however,
 that  in  cases  involving such sex offense or family offense a criminal
 justice agency shall also mean a family  court,  a  governmental  agency
 responsible for child and/or adult protective services pursuant to title
 six  of article six of the social services law and/or title one of arti-
 cle nine-B of the social services law, and any medical  facility  estab-
 lished  under  the  laws  of the state that provides a forensic physical
 examination for victims of rape and sexual assault OR A  FORENSIC  EXAM-

 VICTIM SHALL BE ADVISED ORALLY AND IN WRITING THAT HE OR SHE MAY DECLINE
 TO  PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION REGARDING PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS

 INSURANCE INFORMATION, HE OR SHE SHALL INDICATE  SUCH  DECISION  ON  THE
 FORM  PROVIDED  BY  THE  HOSPITAL,  SEXUAL  ASSAULT  EXAMINER PROGRAM OR
