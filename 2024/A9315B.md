  §  2.  The  opening  paragraph  of subdivision 1 of section 218 of the
 labor law, as amended by chapter 43 of the laws of 2023, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  If  the  commissioner  determines  that  an  employer  has  violated a
 provision of article six (payment of wages), article  nineteen  (minimum
 wage  act),  article  nineteen-A  (minimum wage standards and protective
 labor practices for farm workers), article twenty-one-A (warehouse work-
 er protection act), ARTICLE THIRTY-SIX (BOUNDARIES ON  TECHNOLOGY  ACT),
 section  two hundred twelve-a, section two hundred twelve-b, section one
 hundred sixty-one (day of rest) or section one hundred  sixty-two  (meal
 periods)  of  this  chapter,  or a rule or regulation promulgated there-
 under, the commissioner shall issue to the employer an  order  directing
 compliance  therewith,  which  shall describe particularly the nature of
 the alleged violation. A copy of such order shall  be  provided  to  any
 employee  who has filed a complaint and any authorized representative of
 [him or her] SUCH EMPLOYEE. In addition to directing payment  of  wages,
 benefits  or wage supplements found to be due, and liquidated damages in
 the amount of one hundred percent of unpaid wages, such order, if issued
 to an employer who previously has  been  found  in  violation  of  those
 provisions,  rules  or regulations, or to an employer whose violation is
 willful or egregious, shall direct payment to  the  commissioner  of  an
 additional  sum as a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed double the
 total amount of wages, benefits, or wage supplements found to be due. In
 no case shall the order direct payment of an amount less than the  total
 wages, benefits or wage supplements found by the commissioner to be due,
 plus  the  liquidated  damages  in  the amount of one hundred percent of
 unpaid wages, the appropriate civil penalty, and interest at the rate of
 interest then in effect, as prescribed by the superintendent  of  finan-
 cial  services  pursuant  to  section  fourteen-a of the banking law per
 annum from the date of the underpayment to  the  date  of  the  payment.
 Where the violation is for a reason other than the employer's failure to
 pay wages, benefits or wage supplements found to be due, the order shall
 direct  payment  to the commissioner of a civil penalty in an amount not
 to exceed one thousand dollars  for  a  first  violation,  two  thousand
 dollars  for a second violation or three thousand dollars for a third or
 subsequent violation. In  assessing  the  amount  of  the  penalty,  the
 commissioner  shall give due consideration to the size of the employer's
 business, the good faith basis of  the  employer  to  believe  that  its
 conduct  was  in  compliance with the law, the gravity of the violation,
 the history of previous violations and, in the case of  wages,  benefits
 or  supplements  violations, the failure to comply with recordkeeping or
 other non-wage requirements.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition,  amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation  of  this act on its effective date are authorized to be made and
 completed on or before such effective date.
