  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with

Roundup from September 6-8, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tugboats  have  been  an  indispensable  part  of maritime
transportation for nearly 200 years, maneuvering  larger  watercraft  in
tight areas, and towing unpowered vessels from port to port; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tugs were invented in the 1810s, shortly after steam-power
was successfully applied to watercraft, and  during  the  1800s  on  the
Hudson  River  and  Lake  Champlain,  old stripped-downside-wheelers and
propeller-driven towboats were used to move ever-increasing  numbers  of
watercraft, especially canal boats; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Tugboat Roundup is a gathering of tugboats, workboats
and barges to celebrate the maritime heritage of  the  Northeast  Inland
Waterways; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Tugboat Roundup, which takes place annually the weekend
after Labor Day features a tug parade, tug tours, boat rides, tug talks,
competitions, fireworks, children's activities, vendors, food, and more;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Waterford  sits at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk
Rivers and is the gateway to the Erie and Champlain Canals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Waterford is home to Waterford Flight,  a  flight  of  five
locks,  which  spans the greatest height in the shortest distance of any
set of locks in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Village of Waterford was founded in 1794,  and  is  the
oldest  continually incorporated village in the United States, while the
Town of Waterford was founded in 1816; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Canal System is a successor to the  Erie
Canal  and  other canals within New York; currently, the 525-mile system
is composed of the Erie  Canal,  the  Oswego  Canal,  the  Cayuga-Seneca
Canal, and the Champlain Canal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend cultural events which  symbolize  the  historical,  social,  and
cultural  development  of this great State, its waterways and embody the
 
spirit of the principles  upon  which  this  Nation  was  founded;  now,
therefore, be it

Annual Tugboat Roundup from September 6-8, 2024; and be it further
