  Section 1. Subparagraph (ii)  of  paragraph  a  of  subdivision  1  of
 section  191  of  the labor law, as amended by chapter 38 of the laws of
 1989 and the opening paragraph as amended by chapter 168 of the laws  of

  (ii)  The  commissioner  may  authorize  an employer [which has in the
 three years preceding the application employed an average of  one  thou-
 sand  or  more  persons  in this state or has for one year preceding the
 application employed an average of one thousand or more persons in  this
 state  and  has  for  three  years preceding the application employed an
 average of three thousand or more persons outside the state] to pay less
 frequently than weekly but not less frequently than semi-monthly if  the

 er's history meeting its payroll responsibilities in New York  state  or

 commissioner  in determining the likelihood of the employer's continuing
 ability to meet payroll responsibilities; (B) proof  of  the  employer's
 coverage  for workers' compensation and disability; (C) proof that there
 are no outstanding warrants of the department of taxation and finance or
 the department of labor against the employer for failure to remit  state

  §  2.  Subdivision  1-a of section 198 of the labor law, as amended by
 chapter 362 of the laws of 2015, is amended to read as follows:
  1-a. On behalf of any employee paid less than the wage to which [he or
 she] SUCH EMPLOYEE is entitled under the provisions of this article, the
 commissioner may bring any legal action necessary, including administra-
 tive action, to collect such claim and as part of such legal action,  in
 addition  to  any other remedies and penalties otherwise available under
 this article, the commissioner shall assess  against  the  employer  the
 full amount of any such underpayment, and an additional amount as liqui-

 Liquidated damages shall be calculated by the commissioner  as  no  more
 than  one  hundred percent of the total amount of wages found to be due,
 except such liquidated damages may be up to three hundred percent of the

 A PREVIOUS ORDER ISSUED UNDER SECTION TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN OF THIS CHAP-
 TER  FOR  VIOLATIONS  OF  PARAGRAPH  A OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION ONE
 HUNDRED NINETY-ONE OF THIS ARTICLE FOR WHICH NO PROCEEDING FOR  ADMINIS-
 TRATIVE  OR  JUDICIAL  REVIEW AS PROVIDED IN THIS CHAPTER IS PENDING AND
 THE TIME FOR INITIATION OF SUCH PROCEEDING SHALL HAVE EXPIRED AND RELAT-
 ING TO EMPLOYEES PERFORMING THE SAME WORK; OR
  (III) FOR A VIOLATION OCCURRING AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE  CHAP-
 TER  OF  THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR THAT AMENDED THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES EQUAL  TO  TWENTY-FIVE  PERCENT  OF  THE  TOTAL

 hundred percent of the total amount of the wages found to be due, except
 such  liquidated damages may be up to three hundred percent of the total
