 Introduced  by  M. of A. RAMOS, DICKENS -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the penal law, the civil practice  law  and  rules,  the
  state  finance  law,  the  correction  law,  the education law and the
  mental hygiene law, in relation to defining offenses involving  crimi-
  nal  street  gangs, creating the criminal street gang prevention fund,
  and providing for gang prevention services in schools; and  to  repeal
  sections  120.06  and 120.07 of the penal law, relating to offenses of
  gang assault
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings and purpose. The legislature hereby
 finds that New York laws are insufficient regarding the  prosecution  of
 criminal  street gangs and the protection of public order and individual
 safety against gang-related violence, because of the  lack  of  programs
 and  activities  specifically designed to prevent the growth of criminal
 street gangs, facilitate prosecution and punishment of members of crimi-
 nal street gangs, and punish those who solicit others to participate  in
 criminal  street  gangs  and  in  acts  of  gang-related violence or who
 provide support or resources  to  those  who  commit  or  encourage  the
 commission of such acts.
  The  legislature  further  finds  that  the threat of violence and the
 disruption of public order and safety presented by criminal street gangs
 have reached a crisis point that threatens the  right  of  residents  of
 this state to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation, and phys-
 ical harm.
  The legislature therefore finds and declares that it is in every sense
 in  the  public  interest  to  establish a comprehensive approach to the
 protection of public order and individual safety against criminal street
 gangs and gang-related violence, by severely criminalizing  such  activ-
 ities,  by creating anti-crime programs that focus on patterns of crimi-
