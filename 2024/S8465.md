 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  participation  by  public or quasi-public organizations in the retire-
  ment system
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  a of section 31 of the retirement and social
 security law, as amended by chapter 379 of the laws of 1989, is  amended
 to read as follows:
  a. Any public or quasi-public organization created wholly or partly or
 deriving  its powers by the legislature of the state and which organiza-
 tion employs persons engaged in service to the public or any state agen-
 cy as defined in section fifty-three-a of the state finance law, or  the
 New  York state association of town superintendents of highways, inc. or
 any school board association,  by  resolution  legally  adopted  by  its
 governing  body  and  approved by the comptroller, may elect to have its
 officers and employees become eligible to participate in the  retirement
 system.  Acceptance  of the officers and employees of such an employer
 for membership in the retirement system shall be optional with the comp-
 troller. If he shall approve  their  participation,  such  organization,
 except  as  specifically provided in this article to the contrary, shall
 thereafter be treated as a participating  employer.  Any  election  made
 pursuant  to  this  subdivision  by  a school board association shall be
 applicable to current employees of such  association.  NOTWITHSTANDING
 THE  FOREGOING PROVISIONS, ANY OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE NEW YORK STATE
 ASSOCIATION OF TOWN SUPERINTENDENTS OF  HIGHWAYS,  INC.,  THE  NEW  YORK
 STATE SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION, THE NEW YORK STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUN-
 TIES,  THE  ASSOCIATION  OF TOWNS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, THE NEW YORK
 CONFERENCE OF MAYORS AND OTHER MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS, OR ANY SCHOOL  BOARD
 ASSOCIATION,  FIRST EMPLOYED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAP-
 TER OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR WHICH AMENDED THIS  SUBDIVI-
 SION, SHALL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE AND/OR RECEIVE SERVICE CREDIT
 IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM BASED ON SUCH EMPLOYMENT.

  §  2. Section 609 of the retirement and social security law is amended
 by adding a new subdivision i to read as follows:
  I.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS SECTION OR ANY OTHER
 LAW, RULE OR REGULATION, AN OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE  NEW  YORK  STATE
 ASSOCIATION  OF  TOWN  SUPERINTENDENTS  OF  HIGHWAYS, INC., THE NEW YORK
 STATE SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION, THE NEW YORK STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUN-
 TIES, THE ASSOCIATION OF TOWNS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,  THE  NEW  YORK
 CONFERENCE  OF MAYORS AND OTHER MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS, OR ANY SCHOOL BOARD
 ASSOCIATION, SHALL NOT RECEIVE SERVICE CREDIT FOR EMPLOYMENT  WITH  SUCH
 ORGANIZATION ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 3. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate  the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in
 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would deny eligibility for membership in the New York  State
 and  Local  Employees'  Retirement  System  (NYSLERS)  to  persons first
 employed by the following organizations on or after the effective date:
  1. The New York State Association of Town Superintendents of Highways,
 Inc.,
  2. The New York State School Boards Association,
  3. The New York State Association of Counties,
  4. The Association of Towns of the State of New York,
  5. The New York Conference of Mayors and  Other  Municipal  Officials,
 and
  6. any school board association.
  Further,  this  legislation  would  disallow  future  service  credit
 accruals for employment rendered on and  after  the  effective  date  by
 current  members  of  the NYSLERS employed by such organizations. There-
 fore, if enacted into law, this bill is likely to face a  constitutional
 challenge  based  upon the guarantee that a member's benefits may not be
 diminished.
  If this bill is enacted into  law,  there  will  be  no  cost  to  the
 NYSLERS.
