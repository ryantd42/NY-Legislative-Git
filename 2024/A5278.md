 entitled to reimbursement for such service whether the said  service  is
 performed  by a physician or through a duly licensed physical or occupa-
 tional therapist, provided however, that nothing contained herein  shall

 cian, PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT SUCH TERMS SHALL NOT IMPOSE CO-PAYMENTS IN

  (i)  a  policy  of  hospital,  medical, surgical, or prescription drug

 disability,  as  defined in the mental hygiene law, or physical handicap
 and who became so incapable prior to attainment  of  the  age  at  which
 coverage  would  otherwise  terminate  and who is chiefly dependent upon
 such employee or member for support and maintenance, while the insurance
 of the employee or member remains in force and the child remains in such
 condition, if the insured employee or member has within thirty-one  days
 of  such  child's  attainment  of the termination age submitted proof of
 such child's incapacity as described herein[.]; AND

 PERCENT  OF THE TOTAL REIMBURSEMENT TO THE PROVIDER OF CARE.

 lawful scope of practice of a licensed physical and occupational  thera-
 pist, a subscriber to such policy shall be entitled to reimbursement for
