long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the Partnership for After School Education upon the occasion of

  WHEREAS,  For  three  decades,  the  Partnership  for  After  School

afterschool  educators  whose commitment, energy and creativity have had
an indelible impact on the children and youth of New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS, PASE is a  child-focused  organization  that  promotes  and
supports  quality afterschool programs, particularly those serving young
people from underserved communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, An innovative pioneer in the development and advancement of
the afterschool field, PASE  was  formed  in  1993,  to  professionalize
afterschool  services  so  that  providers  could  deliver  consistent,
high-quality programming to youth and increase their  capacity  to  meet
the needs of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, PASE's core program areas include College Prep and Success,
STEM,  Leadership  Development,  Youth Outcomes, Summer Learning, Global
Learning, and Principles and Practices; and
 
  WHEREAS, Currently, PASE is the platform  for  a  broad  network  of
individuals  and  institutions  who  can  play  a  role in improving the
opportunities available to young people living in poverty  in  New  York
City;  its  network  includes  1,600  community-based  organizations and
hundreds  of  higher  education  institutions,  researchers,  corporate
partners,  city and state policymakers, and philanthropic organizations;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining  true  to  its  mission,  PASE  is  committed  to
providing  the  500,000  young  people  in  New  York City's afterschool
programs with the high-quality services they truly deserve; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of PASE is in direct correlation to the efforts
of its administration led by Chief Executive Officer,  Alison  Overseth,
staff  and  members  whose  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,
characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
 
an  uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of
this vital institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations and individuals of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
