 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  CUNNINGHAM  -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Energy
 
 AN ACT to amend the energy law, in relation to directing the state ener-
  gy planning board to conduct a study of  the  technical  and  economic
  feasibility  of  a  one  hundred percent renewable energy system and a
  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. The energy law is amended by adding a new section 6-110 to
 read as follows:
  § 6-110. SUPPLEMENTAL STUDY ON THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC  FEASIBILITY
 OF  A  ONE  HUNDRED  PERCENT  RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM AND A REDUCTION IN
 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. 1. ON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER FIRST, TWO  THOUSAND
 TWENTY-FOUR,  AND  EVERY  FOUR YEARS THEREAFTER, THE BOARD SHALL PUBLISH
 AND UPDATE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC
 FEASIBILITY OF MEETING THE FOLLOWING GOALS:
  (A) ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF  THE  ELECTRICITY  CONSUMED  IN  THE  STATE
 GENERATED  BY  RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THIR-
 TY-FOUR, AND, ALTERNATIVELY, THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIFTY-FOUR.
  (B) REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM ALL  ANTHROPOGENIC  SOURCES
 ONE  HUNDRED PERCENT BELOW THE LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE
 YEAR NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETY BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND  FIFTY-FOUR,  WITH
 AN  INCREMENTAL  TARGET  OF AT LEAST A FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN GREEN-
 HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BELOW THE LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN  THE
 YEAR NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETY BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THIRTY-FOUR.
  2.  SUCH  STUDY  SHALL INCLUDE, AT A MINIMUM, AN ASSESSMENT OF EACH OF
 THE FOLLOWING:
  (A) THE TIMING, COSTS, ECONOMIC IMPACTS,  AND  FEASIBILITY  ASSOCIATED
 WITH  PATHWAYS TO MEET THESE GOALS. IN TERMS OF THE EVALUATION OF COSTS,
 THE STUDY SHALL:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 A. 4999  2
 
  (I) EVALUATE, USING THE BEST AVAILABLE ECONOMIC MODELS, EMISSION ESTI-
 MATION TECHNIQUES AND OTHER  SCIENTIFIC  METHODS,  THE  TOTAL  POTENTIAL
 COSTS  AND POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND NON-ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF MEETING THESE
 GOALS;
  (II)  EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MEETING THE GOALS ON THE STATE'S
 BUSINESSES, JOBS, RATEPAYERS AND RESIDENTS ASSUMING:
  (A) THE RENEWABLE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GOALS OF  OTHER  STATES
 AND  REGIONS  IN THE UNITED STATES ARE AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT LOWER THAN
 NEW YORK STATE'S GOALS;
  (B) THE RENEWABLE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GOALS OF  OTHER  STATES
 AND REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE AS THOSE IN PLACE AS OF THE DATE OF
 THE STUDY;
  (C) THE EXISTENCE OF TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE AS OF THE DATE OF THE STUDY.
  (B) THE TECHNICAL AND COST IMPACT ON MAINTAINING ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELI-
 ABILITY,  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE NEED FOR AND TYPE OF BACK-UP
 POWER SUPPLIES AND OF ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS TO MAINTAIN ELECTRIC SYSTEM
 RELIABILITY.
  (C) THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM ACTIONS TO FEASIBLY  MEET  THE  GOALS
 ACROSS  ALL  ECONOMIC SECTORS, INCLUDING INDUSTRY, TRANSPORTATION, AGRI-
 CULTURE, BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ENERGY PRODUCTION, INCLUDING:
  (I) AN ANALYSIS  OF  THE  ANTICIPATED  EMISSION  REDUCTIONS,  AND  THE
 ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS THEREOF, AS A RESULT OF EACH ACTION.
  (II) IDENTIFICATION OF THE ANTICIPATED LIFE-CYCLE IMPLICATIONS, CONSE-
 QUENCES,  BENEFITS  AND  COSTS  OF  IMPLEMENTING  EACH ACTION, INCLUDING
 IMPLICATIONS, CONSEQUENCES, BENEFITS AND COSTS TO NEW YORK STATE,  LOCAL
 GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESSES, RATEPAYERS AND RESIDENTS FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF
 EACH ACTION.
  (D) ESTIMATED TIMELINES FOR CONSIDERING AND IMPLEMENTING SUCH ACTIONS.
  (E)  EXPLORATION OF VARIOUS RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY
 DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS.
  (F) A REQUIREMENT FOR ANY NEW VEHICLES SOLD IN THE STATE TO BE POWERED
 BY ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES OR  OTHERWISE  TO
 BE FREE OF EMISSIONS.
  (G)  PROPOSALS  FOR  NEW STRUCTURES CONSTRUCTED IN THE STATE TO BE NET
 ZERO EMISSION STRUCTURES.
  (H) TRANSITION TO RENEWABLE HEATING AND COOLING PROVIDED BY HEAT PUMPS
 POWERED BY RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES OR OTHER MEANS  RESULTING  IN  NET
 ZERO EMISSIONS.
  (I)  THE  ECONOMIC  AND  SOCIAL  BENEFITS  OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
 REDUCTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FEDERAL SOCIAL COST OF  CARBON,  ANY
 OTHER TOOLS THAT THE BOARD DEEMS USEFUL AND PERTINENT FOR THIS ANALYSIS,
 AND  ANY  ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH CO-BENEFITS (SUCH AS
 THE REDUCTION OF CO-POLLUTANTS AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF ENERGY  SOURC-
 ES).
  3.  SUCH  STUDY  SHALL  BUILD  UPON  RELEVANT EXPERTISE ALREADY AT THE
 BOARD'S DISPOSAL.
  4. THE BOARD  MAY  CONTRACT  WITH  AN  INDEPENDENT  AND  COMPETITIVELY
 SELECTED CONTRACTOR TO UNDERTAKE SUCH STUDY.
  5.  THE  BOARD,  AND  ANY CONTRACTORS IT MAY RETAIN FOR SUCH PURPOSES,
 SHALL CONSULT WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE TO  ASSIST
 IN  SUCH  STUDY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACADEMIC PARTNERS, ELEC-
 TRIC CORPORATIONS, ELECTRICITY  GENERATING  COMPANIES,  TRADE  ORGANIZA-
 TIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS.
  6.  THE  BOARD  SHALL  PREPARE A REPORT ON SUCH STUDY'S FINDINGS.  THE
 BOARD SHALL TRANSMIT SUCH REPORT ALONG WITH THE STUDY TO  THE  GOVERNOR,
 THE  SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY, THE TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, THE

 CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY ENERGY COMMITTEE, AND  THE  CHAIR  OF  THE  SENATE
 ENERGY  AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE NO LATER THAN THIRTY DAYS AFTER
 THE STUDY'S COMPLETION.
  7.  THE  LONG  ISLAND  POWER  AUTHORITY AND THE POWER AUTHORITY OF THE
 STATE OF NEW YORK ARE AUTHORIZED, AS DEEMED FEASIBLE  AND  ADVISABLE  BY
