 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  CUNNINGHAM  -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Energy -- committee  discharged,  bill  amended,  ordered
  reprinted as amended and recommitted to said committee
 
 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to directing the
  New  York state energy research and development authority to conduct a
  study of the technical and economic feasibility and  ratepayer  impact
  of a zero-emission electrical system and a reduction in greenhouse gas
  emissions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The public authorities law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 1885 to read as follows:
  §  1885.  SUPPLEMENTAL STUDY ON THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY
 OF A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY  SYSTEM  AND  A  REDUCTION  IN
 GREENHOUSE  GAS  EMISSIONS.  1. ON OR BEFORE JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND
 TWENTY-FOUR, AND EVERY FOUR YEARS THEREAFTER, THE AUTHORITY, IN  CONSUL-
 TATION  AND  COORDINATION  WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE
 DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION, AND THE  FEDERALLY  DESIGNATED
 ELECTRIC  BULK SYSTEM OPERATOR, SHALL PUBLISH AND UPDATE A COMPREHENSIVE
 STUDY TO DETERMINE THE TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY AND  RATEPAYER
 IMPACT OF MEETING THE FOLLOWING GOALS:
  (A) HAVING THE STATEWIDE ELECTRICAL DEMAND SYSTEM BE ZERO-EMISSIONS BY
 THE  YEAR  TWO  THOUSAND  FORTY  PURSUANT  TO SECTION SIXTY-SIX-P OF THE
 PUBLIC SERVICE LAW AND ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE  ELECTRICITY  CONSUMED
 IN  THE  STATE  GENERATED  BY RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES BY THE YEAR TWO
 THOUSAND THIRTY-FOUR, AND, ALTERNATIVELY, THE YEAR TWO  THOUSAND  FIFTY-
 FOUR.
  (B)  REDUCING  STATEWIDE  GREENHOUSE  GAS EMISSIONS BY A PERCENTAGE OF
 NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETY EMISSIONS FROM GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION  SOURCES,
 PURSUANT  TO  CHAPTER  ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINE-
 TEEN, AS FOLLOWS:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
  LBD06331-05-3
 A. 4999--A  2
 
  (I) BY TWO THOUSAND THIRTY: SIXTY PERCENT OF NINETEEN  HUNDRED  NINETY
 EMISSIONS; AND
  (II) BY TWO THOUSAND FIFTY: FIFTEEN PERCENT OF NINETEEN HUNDRED NINETY
 EMISSIONS.
  2.  SUCH  STUDY  SHALL INCLUDE, AT A MINIMUM, AN ASSESSMENT OF EACH OF
 THE FOLLOWING:
  (A) THE TIMING, COSTS, ECONOMIC IMPACTS, RATEPAYER IMPACTS AND  FEASI-
 BILITY  ASSOCIATED  WITH  PATHWAYS  TO  MEET THESE GOALS PURSUANT TO THE
 FINAL SCOPING PLAN ADOPTED BY THE NEW YORK STATE CLIMATE ACTION  COUNCIL
 PURSUANT  TO  CHAPTER  ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINE-
 TEEN.  IN TERMS OF THE EVALUATION OF COSTS, THE STUDY SHALL:
  (I) EVALUATE, USING THE BEST AVAILABLE ECONOMIC MODELS, EMISSION ESTI-
 MATION TECHNIQUES AND OTHER  SCIENTIFIC  METHODS,  THE  TOTAL  POTENTIAL
 COSTS  AND POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND NON-ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF MEETING THESE
 GOALS;
  (II) EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MEETING THE GOALS ON THE  STATE'S
 BUSINESSES, JOBS, RATEPAYERS AND RESIDENTS ASSUMING:
  (A)  THE  RENEWABLE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GOALS OF OTHER STATES
 AND REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT  LOWER  THAN
 NEW YORK STATE'S GOALS;
  (B)  THE  RENEWABLE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS GOALS OF OTHER STATES
 AND REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE AS THOSE IN PLACE AS OF THE DATE OF
 THE STUDY;
  (C) THE EXISTENCE OF TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE AS OF THE DATE OF THE STUDY.
  (B) THE TECHNICAL AND COST IMPACT ON MAINTAINING ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELI-
 ABILITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE NEED FOR AND TYPE OF  BACK-UP
 POWER  SUPPLIES  AND  OF  ENERGY  STORAGE  SYSTEMS  AND OF ZERO-EMISSION
 DISPATCHABLE RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY.
  (C) THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM ACTIONS TO FEASIBLY  MEET  THE  GOALS
 ACROSS  ALL  ECONOMIC SECTORS, INCLUDING INDUSTRY, TRANSPORTATION, AGRI-
 CULTURE, BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ENERGY PRODUCTION, INCLUDING:
  (I) AN ANALYSIS  OF  THE  ANTICIPATED  EMISSION  REDUCTIONS,  AND  THE
 ECONOMIC  IMPLICATIONS AND RATEPAYER IMPACT THEREOF, AS A RESULT OF EACH
 ACTION.
  (II) IDENTIFICATION OF THE ANTICIPATED LIFE-CYCLE IMPLICATIONS, CONSE-
 QUENCES, BENEFITS AND  COSTS  OF  IMPLEMENTING  EACH  ACTION,  INCLUDING
 IMPLICATIONS,  CONSEQUENCES, BENEFITS AND COSTS TO NEW YORK STATE, LOCAL
 GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESSES, RATEPAYERS AND RESIDENTS FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF
 EACH ACTION.
  (III) DETAILED ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE ANNUAL AND TOTAL  COST  IMPACT
 ON  ELECTRIC  AND  NATURAL GAS BILLS FOR ALL CUSTOMER SECTORS ACROSS THE
 STATE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RESIDENTIAL, SMALL AND LARGE BUSI-
 NESS CUSTOMERS, ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADOPTED  SCOP-
 ING PLAN, ALONG WITH A RANGE OF COSTS, BASED UPON THE SELECTION OF VARI-
 OUS  POTENTIAL  DECARBONIZATION  PATHWAYS,  TO  MINIMIZE  COSTS  AND  TO
 MAXIMIZE THE TOTAL BENEFITS TO NEW YORK STATE.
  (IV) SPECIFIC COST STUDY SCENARIOS THAT SHOW RESIDENTIAL,  COMMERCIAL,
 INDUSTRIAL,  AND  INSTITUTIONAL  ENERGY  CONSUMERS',  ALONG  WITH  LOCAL
 GOVERNMENTS,  INCREASED COSTS, NOT ONLY ON THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM, BUT ALSO
 ON THE GAS SYSTEM.
  (A) THE ANALYSIS SHALL  SPECIFY  CONSUMERS'  COSTS  OF  INSTALLING  OR
 ACCESSING  RENEWABLE  ENERGY AND ENERGY STORAGE, REPLACING THEIR HEATING
 SYSTEMS, UPGRADING THEIR ELECTRIC SERVICE, PURCHASING ELECTRIC CARS, AND
 CHARGING THEM.
  (B) THE ANALYSIS SHALL DETAIL HOW CONSUMERS WILL PAY FOR  THESE  MEAS-
 URES,  ASSESS WHETHER THE ADOPTED SCOPING PLAN INCLUDES SUFFICIENT MEAS-
 A. 4999--A  3
 
 URES TO AVOID OR REDUCE UPFRONT COSTS ON CONSUMERS, AND RECOMMEND  ADDI-
 TIONAL AFFORDABILITY MEASURES.
  (D) ESTIMATED TIMELINES FOR CONSIDERING AND IMPLEMENTING SUCH ACTIONS.
  (E) EXPLORATION OF VARIOUS RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY, ENERGY STORAGE, ZERO-

 (SUCH AS THE REDUCTION OF CO-POLLUTANTS AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF ENER-
 GY SOURCES), AND AVOIDING, LOWERING, MINIMIZING, OFFSETTING, OR MITIGAT-
 ING,  TO  THE  MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE USING VERIFIABLE MEASURES, ANY
 SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF THE  EXISTING  DISPROPORTIONATE POLLUTION BURDEN
 ON A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY, PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE  OF  SECTION
 SEVEN  OF  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN,
 PROVIDED THAT THE TERM  "POLLUTION"  SHALL  HAVE  THE  SAME  MEANING  AS
