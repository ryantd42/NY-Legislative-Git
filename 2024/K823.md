  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  Friday, February 2, 2024, as Wear Red for Women  Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Friday, February 2, 2024, as Wear  Red
for Women Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the American
Heart Association's Go Red For Women National Campaign; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Heart  disease  is the number one killer of women, killing
more women than men with about one in five deaths each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Among females 20 years and older,  nearly  45%  are  living
with  some  form  of  cardiovascular  disease and less than 50% of women
entering pregnancy in the United States have good heart health; and
 
  WHEREAS, Overall, 10% to 20% of  women  will  have  a  health  issue
during  pregnancy, and high blood pressure, preeclampsia and gestational
diabetes during pregnancy greatly increase a woman's risk for developing
cardiovascular disease later in life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over half of high blood pressure deaths, otherwise known as
hypertension or the "silent killer," are in women, and out of all women,
57.6% of Black females have hypertension - more than any other  race  or
ethnicity; and
 
  WHEREAS, February is designated as American Heart Month, and Friday,
February  2,  2024,  is  National  Wear  Red  Day  in recognition of the
importance of the ongoing fight against heart disease and stroke; and
 
  WHEREAS, Go Red  For  Women  is  the  American  Heart  Association's
national  call  for  women  by women, to take charge of their health and
live stronger, healthier lives; Go Red For  Women  combines  style  with
substance,  and  the  red dress and the color red are the American Heart
Association's symbols for women and heart disease;  the  campaign  helps
raise donations to fund research to help save lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Heart  Association,  the  largest voluntary
health organization dedicated to  fighting  heart  disease  and  stroke,
continues  to  take a leadership role in educating women about the risks
of this devastating disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Heart Association launched Go Red  For  Women,
driving  home  the  message to women that heart disease is their leading
cause of death, a fact most women still do not know; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Go Red For  Women  movement  empowers  women  with  the
knowledge  and  tools they need to take charge of their health and urges
women to take action now; and
 
  WHEREAS, Go Red For Women helps to provide women with information on
healthy eating, exercise, and risk factor  reduction,  such  as  smoking
 
cessation,  weight  maintenance,  blood  pressure  control  and  blood
cholesterol management; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of  this Legislative Body to join the
American Heart Association in encouraging women across New York State to
Go Red For Women so they have the best chance at fighting heart disease,
the number one killer of women, and to make heart health a top  priority
so they can live longer, stronger lives; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Friday, February  2,  2024
as Wear Red For Women Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
