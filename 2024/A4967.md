 Introduced  by M. of A. ROZIC -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Science and Technology
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation  to  enacting  the
  New York child data privacy and protection act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "New  York
 child data privacy and protection act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  The legislature hereby finds that 95% of
 individuals under the age of 18 in the United States enjoy access to the
 Internet in their residences.
  The legislature further finds  that  American  teenagers  spend  seven
 hours  and 22 minutes on average per day browsing social media, and that
 53% of children will own a smartphone by the time they're  11  years  of
 age.
  The  legislature  recognizes  that,  while  broadband access is a core
 component of modern life and critical to the  ability  of  children  and
 young  people  to  feel  socially, emotionally, economically, and educa-
 tionally connected to the world around them, it is not without its risks
 and detriments.
  The legislature finds, for example, that teenagers who  spend  between
 five  to seven hours a day on the Internet are twice as likely to suffer
 from depression compared to those logged in for one hour a day.
  The legislature  further  finds  that,  according  to  recent  surveys
 conducted by a prominent social media platform, 34% of young adults feel
 uneasy  when they are not online, 40.6% complain that their sleep habits
 have been negatively affected by social  media,  and  35%  report  being
 cyberbullied on the Internet.
  The  legislature  further  finds  that,  according  to  the  2021 U.S.
 Surgeon General Advisory on  Protecting  Youth  Mental  Health,  digital
 public  spaces  are  frequently  designed to maximize user engagement as

 opposed to safeguarding user health,  leading  to  negative  impacts  of
 digital  technologies and social media on the mental health and well-be-
 ing of adolescents.
  The  legislature  further  finds that the pitfalls of the Internet are
 not limited to teenagers, with young  children  potentially  exposed  to
 unsettling, dangerous, or age inappropriate content if not closely moni-
 tored by an adult.
  The legislature further finds that young children run a higher risk of
 coming  into  contact  with  strangers  online,  inadvertently  sharing
 personal information online, inadvertently making  in-app  purchases  or
 signing  contracts,  terms,  or  conditions online, becoming subject to,
 witnessing, or participating in potentially harmful conduct  online,  or
 purchasing  drugs and other dangerous products advertised online or sold
 through online platforms.
  The legislature recognizes the role of lawmakers to guard against  and
 mitigate these risks for children under the age of 18 wherever possible.
  The  legislature  finds that, while Congress passed the landmark Chil-
 dren's Online Privacy  Protection  Act  (COPPA)  in  1998  limiting  the
 collection, use, and disclosure of data collected from children under 13
 years  of  age,  requiring  operators  to retain such data for a limited
 amount of time, and restricting certain marketing to children  under  13
 years  of age, multiple studies have found the vast majority of applica-
 tion developers to be out of compliance with these rules.
  The legislature further finds that recent studies show at  least  two-
 thirds  of applications transmit data about very young children to third
 party marketing companies.
  The legislature further finds that President Biden  recently  declared
 the need to "strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to
 children,  [and]  demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on
 our children" in his 2022 State of the Union Address.
  The legislature further finds that, subsequent to  this  address,  the
 Federal  Trade Commission announced that it will prioritize the enforce-
 ment and modernization of COPPA to "crack down on companies  that  ille-
 gally surveil children online".
  The  legislature  further finds that there has been a flurry of recent
 legislative activity at the state, federal, and international levels  to
 address this issue, including the California Age-Appropriate Design Code
 Act,  the  Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy
 Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, the Utah  Consumer  Privacy  Act,
 several  federal proposals to strengthen and improve COPPA, and the UK's
 Age Appropriate Design Code.
  The legislature hereby concludes that the state of New York too has  a
 role to play in better preventing the exploitation of children's data in
 the  modern  era,  and thus presents the New York Child Data Privacy and
 Protection Act.
  § 3. The article heading of article 39-F of the general business  law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  117 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as
