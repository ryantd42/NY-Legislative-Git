 with  the  concurrence of the legislative body of such local government,
 or the legislative body by a vote of  two-thirds  of  its  total  voting
 power  without the approval of such officer, may request the legislature
 to  pass a specific bill relating to the property, affairs or government
 of such local government which does not in terms  and  in  effect  apply
 alike  to  all  counties,  all counties other than those wholly included
 within a city, all cities, all towns or all villages, as  the  case  may
 be.  Such  a request may be made separately by two or more local govern-
 ments affected by the same bill. Every such request shall declare that a
 necessity exists for the passage of such bill  by  the  legislature  and
 shall  recite the facts establishing such necessity. The form of request
 and the manner of its communication to the legislature shall conform  to
 rules  promulgated  by  concurrent resolution of the senate and assembly
 pursuant to article three-A of the legislative law. In adopting  such  a
 request  the  legislative  body  shall  be governed by the provisions of
 subdivision one of section twenty of this chapter  with  regard  to  the
 adoption  of  a local law. The validity of an act passed by the legisla-
 ture in accordance with such a request shall not be subject to review by
 the courts on the ground that the necessity alleged in the  request  did
 not  exist  or  was  not  properly  established  by  the  facts recited.
 PROVIDED HOWEVER, ANY REQUEST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR ENACTMENT OF LAWS
 WHICH INCREASES, EXTENDS, IMPOSES OR REVIVES ANY TAX, FEE, ASSESSMENT OR
 SURCHARGE SHALL REQUIRE THE VOTE OF TWO-THIRDS OF THE TOTAL VOTING POWER
 OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF SUCH LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
