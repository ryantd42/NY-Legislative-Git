  § 2.  Section 131 of the alcoholic beverage control law, as  added  by
 section  1  of  part  J of chapter 56 of the laws of 2006, is amended to
 read as follows:
  §  131.  New  York  alcoholic  beverage  control problem premises task
 force. 1. There is hereby created within  the  authority  the  New  York
 alcoholic  beverage  control  problem  premises  task force (hereinafter
 "task force"), which shall consist of  employees  of  the  authority  as
 designated  by  the members of the authority, provided however, that the
 task force shall include at least one investigator EACH from the  Albany
 office,  [one  investigator  from] the Buffalo office, and [one investi-
 gator from] the New York city office.
  2. In any case where the  authority  receives  notification  from  the
 mayor,  chief of police, police commissioner, sheriff, or local legisla-
 tive body of any city, town or village which  certifies  that  continued
 operation  of an on-premises establishment poses [a] AN ACTUAL OR POTEN-
 TIALLY significant threat to  the  public  health,  safety,  or  welfare
 [requiring] OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY THAT REQUIRES immediate action,
 the  authority  shall  assign  responsibility for conducting an investi-
 gation concerning such premises to the task force. In the  city  of  New
 York,  the  community board established pursuant to section twenty-eight
 hundred of the New York city charter with jurisdiction over the area  in
 which such premises is located shall be considered the appropriate local
 legislative body.
  3. Not more than fourteen calendar days after receipt by the authority
 of  a  notification  as  provided  in this section, the task force shall
 commence an investigation into the operation of the  establishment.  The
 task  force  shall  complete  its  investigation and the authority shall
 commence a disciplinary hearing proceeding pursuant to this chapter  for
 revocation  or other appropriate action within forty-five calendar days,
 unless the task force determines in written findings that MORE  TIME  IS
 NEEDED  TO  SATISFACTORILY COMPLETE SUCH INVESTIGATION OR THAT no disci-
 plinary charges are warranted. SUCH EXTENSION OF TIME FOR COMPLETION  OF
 THE  INVESTIGATION SHALL BE FOR NO MORE THAN SIXTY CALENDAR DAYS. A copy
 of any such determination shall be sent to the mayor, chief  of  police,
 police  commissioner,  sheriff,  or  local legislative body of the city,
 town or village that filed the  notification  with  the  authority.  The
 authority  shall notify the mayor, chief of police, police commissioner,
 sheriff, or local legislative body of the city,  town  or  village  that
 filed  the notification to the authority of the final disposition of the
 disciplinary proceeding within ten business days of  the  completion  of
 this process.
  §  3.  This  act  shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day
 after it shall have become a law.
