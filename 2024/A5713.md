 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  implementing a presumption of performance of duty disability for post-
  traumatic stress disorder in certain employees of Suffolk county

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding
 a new section 605-g to read as follows:
  § 605-G. ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY RETIREMENT  FOR  CERTAIN  EMPLOYEES  IN
 SUFFOLK  COUNTY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER OR OF ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL OR LOCAL LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY MEMBER WHO SERVES  IN
 SUFFOLK COUNTY AS A PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHER I, PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHER
 II, PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHER III, INCLUDING SPANISH SPEAKING DISPATCHERS
 IN  SUCH  TITLES,  EMERGENCY  SERVICE  DISPATCHER  I,  EMERGENCY SERVICE

 CER  I,  PUBLIC  SAFETY OFFICER II, PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER III, INCLUDING
 SPANISH SPEAKING OFFICERS IN SUCH TITLES, AND CASE WORKER OR CASE WORKER
 TRAINEE IN THE DEPARTMENT  OF  SOCIAL  SERVICES  FAMILY  AND  CHILDREN'S

 MEMBER, PRESENTLY EMPLOYED, AND WHO SHALL HAVE SUSTAINED SUCH DISABILITY
 WHILE SO EMPLOYED, SHALL BE PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE  THAT  SUCH  DISABILITY
 WAS  INCURRED  IN  THE PERFORMANCE AND DISCHARGE OF DUTY AND THE NATURAL
 AND PROXIMATE RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT, UNLESS THE CONTRARY  BE  PROVED  BY
 COMPETENT EVIDENCE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT PRIOR TO ENTRY INTO SERVICE,
 SUCH  MEMBER  WAS  NOT  PREVIOUSLY  DIAGNOSED WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS
 DISORDER.

  § 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to section 25 of the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would grant improved disability eligibility to any Tier 3,
 4, 5 or 6 member of the New York State and Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System  (NYSLERS)  employed  by  any municipality within Suffolk County,
 including Suffolk County itself, in the title of
  1. public safety dispatcher,
  2. public safety officer,
  3. emergency complaint operator,
  4. emergency service dispatcher, or
  5. case worker with the Department of Social Services.
  For any member so employed who is diagnosed with post-traumatic stress
 disorder, resulting in disability, such diagnosis shall be considered as
 presumptive evidence that the disability was incurred in the performance
 of the member's duties and the result of an accident, unless the contra-
 ry be proven by competent evidence and provided no  such  diagnosis  was
 made  prior  to  employment  with  Suffolk County. The annual accidental
 disability benefit for these members would be 1/3 of final average sala-
 ry (FAS). Currently, in order to receive a disability benefit of 1/3  of
 FAS, members must have at least ten years of service.
  Insofar  as this bill would affect the NYSLERS, if this legislation is
 enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it would lead to more disa-
 bilities being classified as "accidental". The cost will depend upon the
 applicant's age, service, and salary. It is estimated that the  per-per-
 son cost will be up to five and one half (5.5) times salary.
  All  costs  will  be  shared  by  the  State of New York and all local
 participating employers in the NYSLERS.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
