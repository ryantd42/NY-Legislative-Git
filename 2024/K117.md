BY: M. of A. Brown K
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 17, 2023, as Random Acts of Kindness Day in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set aside to promote and encourage positivity
which benefit the lives of the citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  February  17,  2023,  as
Random  Acts  of  Kindness  Day in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of National Random Acts of Kindness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Random Acts of Kindness Day, observed on February 17th each
year, originated in New Zealand in 2004; the  Random  Acts  of  Kindness
Foundation  (RAK),  created  in  1995  in  the  United  States,  is  an
internationally recognized  non-profit  organization  founded  upon  the
powerful  belief  in  kindness  and dedicated to providing resources and
tools that encourage acts of kindness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Everybody has the potential to  change  the  world;  Random
Acts of Kindness Day celebrates and inspires compassion and benevolence,
and the pay it forward mentality; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  popular  day  is observed by individuals, groups and
organizations nationwide to encourage acts of kindness,  some  of  which
may  include:  pay  for  the  person behind you in the drive-thru; allow
someone to go ahead of you in line; purchase extra items at the  grocery
store  to  donate to a local food pantry; give flowers to someone to let
them know they are appreciated;  leave  uplifting  messages  around  for
people  to  find;  compliment  a  work colleague; let a car into traffic
ahead of you; or pay the bus fare for the passenger behind you; and
 
  WHEREAS, Random Acts of Kindness Day should be celebrated  not  only
on  February  17th, but the other 364 days of the year as an inspiration
to all people because, as purported by Aesop, "No act  of  kindness,  no
matter how small, is ever wasted"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Individuals  who  choose  to  practice  this  unselfish
expression of generosity live and breathe kindness, share knowledge  and
lead  by example; they tend to leave a trail of positive and progressive
feelings in their wake; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kindness  and  respect  for  others  is  contagious;  this
rippling  effect  no matter how slight, can truly leave a lasting impact
on not only the receiver but the giver as well; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative to promote days in which love, acceptance,
non-violence and tolerance  are  observed,  and  to  encourage  all  New
Yorkers to practice this simple philosophy and incorporate it into their
lifestyle; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  February  17,  2023,  as
Random Acts of Kindness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
