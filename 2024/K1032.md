Assembly Resolution No. 1032
 
BY: M. of A. Jackson
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  30th  Anniversary  of  Nas'
  "Illmatic" album
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor  and  pay
just  tribute  to  those  musical geniuses whose commitment and creative
talents contribute to the entertainment and cultural enrichment of their
community, the State of New York, and the entire Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 30th Anniversary of Nas' "Illmatic" album; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nas' debut album "Illmatic"  is  the  crown  jewel  of  the
mid-90s  classics  that  still  define  the  genre;  unlike other albums
released in its wake,  "Illmatic"  was  the  game-changer  that  forever
transformed the landscape of East Coast hip-hop; and
 
  WHEREAS, Released on April 19, 1994, by Columbia Records, "Illmatic"
raised  the  stakes  for hip-hop production, lyrical technique, content,
and overall artistic ambition; and
 
  WHEREAS, Styled as a hardcore  hip-hop  album,  "Illmatic"  features
multi-syllabic  internal  rhymes and inner-city narratives based on Nas'
experiences growing up in Queens, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The album debuted at number 12  on  the  US  Billboard  200
chart, selling 63,000 copies in its first week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its initial reception, "Illmatic" has been recognized
by  writers and music critics as a landmark album in East Coast hip hop;
its influence on subsequent hip hop artists has been attributed  to  the
album's  production and Nas' lyricism, and contributed to the revival of
the New York City rap scene, introducing a number of stylistic trends to
the region; and
 
  WHEREAS, The album is widely regarded as one  of  the  greatest  and
most  influential hip hop albums of all time, appearing on numerous best
album lists by critics and publications; Billboard wrote  in  2015  that
"Illmatic"  is  widely seen as the best hip-hop album ever; in 2020, the
album was ranked by Rolling Stone at number 44 on its list  of  The  500
Greatest  Albums  of  All Time, and in the same year, it was selected by
the Library of Congress  for  preservation  in  the  National  Recording
Registry  for  being  "culturally,  historically,  or  aesthetically
significant"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the last 30 years, the taut  ten-track  meditation  on
the  universal  struggle  of  a young man growing up in the Queensbridge
Houses  has  remained  resonant  and  relevant,  truly  revolutionizing
hip-hop;  its  precise  poetry  introduced  new  terms  and phrases that
infiltrated hip-hop's lexicon, making Nas' debut album one of  the  most
technically masterful rap albums of the half-century; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A man of colossal talent, Nas is a brilliant artist and an
inspiration to millions around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  arts are the building blocks of civilization, and are
central  to  human  expression;  they  enlighten  us  and  inspire  the
imagination; individuals which further such worthy purposes richly merit
the recognition and appreciation of this Legislative Body and the people
of the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 30th Anniversary of Nas' "Illmatic"  album;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Nas.
