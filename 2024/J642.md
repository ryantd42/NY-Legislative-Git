  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official weeks that are dedicated to increasing awareness of serious and

  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 23-31,  2023,  as  Red  Ribbon
Week  in  the  State  of New York, in conjunction with the observance of

  WHEREAS, In 1980, The National Family Partnership was established as

committed  to  playing  an  active role in drug prevention education and
advocacy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Family  Partnership  organized  the  first
Nationwide  Red  Ribbon  Campaign  after the murder of DEA Agent Enrique

wearing  Red  Ribbons  to  represent  their  commitment  to  increasing
awareness of the killing and destruction caused by drugs in the country;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Enrique Camarena believed that  one  person  could  make  a
difference;  this  belief  was used as the model at the start of the Red
Ribbon Campaign and it continues  to  be  the  belief  as  the  campaign
reaches the lives of millions of American children and families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  leadership  of  President  Peggy  B. Sapp, the
National Red Ribbon Campaign has become an annual  national  event  that
acts as a major force in raising awareness and mobilizing communities in
the fight against drugs; and
 
  WHEREAS, "Be Drug Free, Love Yourself," is the winning theme for the
2023  Red  Ribbon Week; created by Emily King, Chelsea Abbott and Celise

York,  the  theme  will  continue  to  be  used  all  throughout 2023 in
thousands of schools and communities across the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  Red
Ribbon  Week  in  order  to raise awareness regarding the serious issues
surrounding drugs today and to promote the betterment of drug  education
and prevention in New York State and beyond; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October  23-31,  2023,  as
Red Ribbon Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
