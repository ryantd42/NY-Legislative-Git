BY: M. of A. Fall
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  16th  Anniversary  of Kosovo's
  Independence
 
  WHEREAS, Kosovo Independence Day  is  a  national  holiday  observed
annually every February 17th, in commemoration of the declaration of the
Balkan nation's independence in 2008; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kosovo,  as  the  second-youngest  country in Southeastern
Europe, on February 17, 2008, made a declaration  of  Independence  from
Serbia  following  a deadly war which lasted from March 5, 1998, to June
11, 1999; and
 
  WHEREAS, The conflict came to a halt following  the  North  Atlantic
Treaty  Organization's  (NATO) intervention by airstrikes in March 1999;
Yugoslav forces then withdrew from Kosovo; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Republic of Kosovo, which derives  its  name  from  the
Serbian  region  "field of the blackbirds," a former province in Serbia,
is majorly described as an ethnic Albanian territory; and
 
  WHEREAS, Present-day Kosovo traces its origin to  Dardania,  forming
an  independent  polity known as the Kingdom of Dardania (fourth century
B.C.); and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its independence, Kosovo citizens are  rightly  proud
of  the  progress  Kosovo has made in promoting and advancing democratic
values and strengthening institutions to deliver good  governance,  rule
of law, and economic opportunity for all Kosovans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  agreement  proposed under the EU-facilitated Dialogue
will advance Kosovo toward greater regional stability and  European  and
Euro-Atlantic integration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  this  day, the enduring partnership between the United
States and Kosovo is rooted in the  mutual  understanding,  values,  and
friendship  between  our  countries;  normalization  of  relations  with
Serbia, centered on eventual mutual recognition,  remains  essential  to
peace and prosperity in this region of the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kosovars  in  New  York,  having arrived both pre and post
Kosovo's independence, have significantly contributed  to  the  cultural
diversity  and  economic  vitality  of  the  State, enriching its social
fabric  through  their  unique  heritage,  entrepreneurial  spirit,  and
commitment to community development; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  presence  of  the  Kosovar  community in New York has
fostered deeper  bilateral  ties,  promoting  mutual  understanding  and
cooperation  between  Kosovo  and  the  United  States, and has played a
pivotal role in advocating for Kosovo's interests and recognition on the
international stage; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is with immense  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  and  congratulates  the  people  of  Kosovo,  our  friend,
 
partner, and ally, on this significant day of independence,  recognizing
their achievements and supporting their future endeavors; now therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pauses in its deliberations to
commemorate the 16th Anniversary of Kosovo's  independence,  celebrating
its  past,  acknowledging its present, and looking forward with optimism
to its future.
