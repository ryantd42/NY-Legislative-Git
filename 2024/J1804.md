BY: Senator RHOADS
 
  COMMENDING  Lieutenant  Brendan  Mullaney upon the
  occasion  of  his  designation  as  recipient  of  a
  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest honor bestowed upon an
  individual by the New York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
honor those distinguished officers and citizens who devote themselves to
public  service,  demonstrating great courage and diligence in providing
for the care and welfare of the citizens of their communities  and  this
great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Within  every community of the State of New York there are
certain individuals who, by virtue of their commitment  and  dedication,
command  the  respect  and  admiration  of  their  community  for  their
exemplary contributions and service on behalf of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Lieutenant Brendan Mullaney upon the occasion of his designation
as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the evening of Wednesday, December 20, 2023,  Lieutenant
Brendan  Mullaney,  of  Seaford,  New York, was returning home after his
workday at the State Criminal  Court  in  Manhattan  when  he  witnessed
six-foot flames in his neighbors' driveway across the street; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Without hesitation, Lieutenant Brendan Mullaney ran to the
burning residence and pounded on the front door to alert the  family  of
five  who  resided  there;  Kevin  Kalyan  was  bathing two of his young
children upstairs when the blaze ascended the garage  and  engulfed  the
front of the house; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  fortunate  family  was able to escape without harm to
anyone because of the bravery and fearless heroism of Lieutenant Brendan
Mullaney who not only alerted them but also entered the home  to  obtain
clothes for the two children who had escaped wearing only towels; and
 
  WHEREAS, Approximately 60 firefighters from Massapequa, Seaford, and
Wantagh  responded  to  the  alarm;  the  flames  took almost an hour to
extinguish, bringing awareness of the potential tragedy to the residents
of  the  neighborhood  who  recognize  the  courage,  compassion,  and
selflessness  of  Lieutenant  Brendan Mullaney and those individuals who
don uniforms and perform their civic duties  without  consideration  for
themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A truly courageous man, Lieutenant Brendan Mullaney played
a vital role in this extraordinary rescue effort and should  be  praised
 
by  the  people  of  this  great  Empire State for his astute actions in
attempting to preserve the lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  his  spontaneous  and  heroic  act, Lieutenant Brendan
Mullaney has so aptly demonstrated  his  character  and  compassion  for
others,  personifying,  by virtue of his actions, the collective concern
of ordinary  citizens  across  the  community  of  New  York  State  who
voluntarily  respond  without  thought  of  danger or reward when fellow
constituents are in need of aid; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  those
dedicated  public  servants  who  unselfishly  devote their lives to the
preservation of order and the protection of others are  worthy  and  due
full praise for their commitment and noble endeavors; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Lieutenant Brendan Mullaney upon the occasion of his designation
as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Lieutenant Brendan Mullaney.
