BY: M. of A. Berger
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  115th  anniversary  of  Mount
  Hebron  Cemetery,  honoring  its  historical
  significance and service to the community
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those esteemed institutions that have long  served  their
communities  and  contributed  to  the rich tapestry of New York State's
history and heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mount Hebron Cemetery, located in the vibrant community  of
Flushing,  Queens,  stands as a venerable institution, marking its 115th
anniversary this year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1909, Mount Hebron Cemetery has provided a final
resting place for generations of New Yorkers, offering  a  tranquil  and
respectful  environment that honors the memory of those who have passed;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The cemetery is not only a  place  of  repose  but  also  a
cultural  and  historical  landmark, reflecting the diverse heritage and
traditions of the people it serves, including a substantial  portion  of
the Jewish community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the past century and more, Mount Hebron Cemetery has
been meticulously maintained, preserving the dignity of the interred and
providing comfort to the families and loved ones who visit; and
 
  WHEREAS, The cemetery is home to numerous  notable  individuals  who
have made significant contributions to the arts, sciences, business, and
public service, thus adding to the rich historical narrative of New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Raphael  Lemkin, a distinguished lawyer and the originator
of the term "genocide," is interred at Mount Hebron  Cemetery;  Lemkin's
pioneering  work  in international law has left an indelible mark on the
global human rights movement; in his 1944 book, "Axis Rule  in  Occupied
Europe,"  Lemkin  wrote,  "Generally  speaking,  genocide  does  not
necessarily mean the immediate destruction  of  a  nation,  except  when
accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended
rather  to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the
destruction of essential foundations of the  life  of  national  groups,
with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. Genocide is directed
against  the  national  group as an entity, and the actions involved are
directed against individuals, not in their individual capacity,  but  as
members of the national group"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Julius Schwartz, an influential editor and publisher in the
comic  book  industry,  also  rests  at  Mount Hebron Cemetery; Schwartz
played a key role in  the  development  of  some  of  the  most  beloved
characters  and  stories in comic book history, including the revival of
superheroes such as The Flash, Green Lantern, and the Justice League  of
America,  and  his  work  significantly  shaped  the modern era of comic
books; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Nathan Perlman, who served as a U.S. Congressman and was a
prominent advocate for Jewish causes  and  social  justice,  is  another
notable  figure  buried  at  Mount Hebron Cemetery; his contributions to
public service  and  the  Jewish  community  are  deeply  respected  and
remembered;  during World War II, Nathan Perlman was a vocal opponent of
the Nazi regime and used his platform to advocate for the United States'
intervention in Europe to stop the atrocities being  committed;  he  was
involved  in  various  efforts  to  support  Jewish  refugees and worked
tirelessly to raise awareness about the plight of  European  Jews  under
Nazi occupation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fred  Lebow, the founder of the New York City Marathon, is
also buried at Mount Hebron  Cemetery;  Lebow's  vision  and  dedication
transformed  the  marathon  into  one  of  the  world's premier sporting
events, fostering a spirit of endurance and community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mount Hebron Cemetery continues to play a crucial  role  in
the  community  by  offering educational programs, historical tours, and
participating in events that promote cultural awareness and remembrance;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The dedication and hard work of the management and staff of
Mount Hebron Cemetery deserve to  be  recognized  for  their  unwavering
commitment  to maintaining the highest standards of care and respect for
the departed and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is fitting that this  Legislative  Body  recognizes  the
enduring  significance  of Mount Hebron Cemetery, commends its 115 years
of service, and celebrates its ongoing contributions to the heritage  of
New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 115th anniversary of Mount Hebron Cemetery, honoring its
historical significance and service to the community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Mount Hebron Cemetery.
