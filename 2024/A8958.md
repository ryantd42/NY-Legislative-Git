 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  DeSTEFANO  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Real Property Taxation
 
 AN ACT authorizing the Mount Olive Pentecostal Church of Faith  to  file
  an application for retroactive real property tax exemption
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Brookhaven in the county of Suffolk is here-
 by authorized to accept from Mount Olive Pentecostal  Church  of  Faith,
 Inc.,  an application for exemption from real property taxes pursuant to
 section 420-a  of  the  real  property  tax  law  with  respect  to  the
 2019--2020  assessment  roll for the parcels owned by such organization,
 with such parcels being located at 17 Sander Court,  in  the  hamlet  of
 Middle Island, town of Brookhaven, county of Suffolk, otherwise known as
 Suffolk  county  tax map district 0200, section 504.00, block 01.00, lot
 003.004. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed  as  if  it  had
 been received on or before the taxable status dates established for such
 rolls.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption if such organization had acquired  the  subject  property
 and filed an application for exemption by the appropriate taxable status
 date, the assessor, upon approval by the town board, may grant exemption
 from all taxation beginning on the date of the conveyance of such parcel
 to  such  organization,  and make appropriate corrections to the subject
 rolls. If such exemption is  granted  and  such  organization  therefore
 shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the governing
 body  or  tax  department  may,  in its sole discretion, provide for the
 refund of those taxes paid  and  cancel  any  taxes,  fines,  penalties,
 interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
