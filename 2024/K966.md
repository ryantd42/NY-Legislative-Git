  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 18, 2024, as Transit Employee Appreciation Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Transit employees are a crucial component to our  State  as
they  are  responsible  for  connecting  us  to  different locations and
ensuring we get safely to our final destinations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Transit employee titles range from bus drivers  to  railway
conductors,  but also anyone who is involved in any aspect of the public
transit operation including supervisors, mechanics, operators, cleaners,
mechanic helpers, bus attendants, and dispatchers,  and  so  many  other
incredible roles that make contributions to our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  the  State of New York, there are over 200,000
individuals who are considered transit employees who ensure  the  safety
of  travelers,  keep  a  track  of  the  stops,  while  also holding the
responsibility of dropping passengers off at the right location; and
 
  WHEREAS, Transit employees serve as frontline workers, who report to
work and keep public transit running through natural  disasters,  global
health pandemics, and other emergency situations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  2009  blog  post  spurred  the  creation of "Bus Driver
Appreciation  Day"  that  would  soon  expand  to  rail  operators,  and
eventually all transit employees, while also designating March 18 as the
official  day because it correlates with the opening of the first public
bus line, Blaise Pascal's Carrosses a cinq sols, in Paris in 1662; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  recognizes  the  indispensable
contributions that all transit employees make every day to get residents
of  the  State  of New York from Point A to Point B in a safe and secure
manner, and seeks to honor all transit employees; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 18, 2024, as Transit
Employee Appreciation Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  and  all transportation-based unions and organizations throughout
the State of New York.
