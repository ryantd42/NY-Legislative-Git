Senate Resolution No. 2217
 
BY: Senator WALCZYK
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the
  completion of the Northville-Placid Trail
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  the
continuing  welfare  of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly
enriched  and  reliably  served  by  the  purposeful  endeavors  of
organizations  and  individuals who are committed to the preservation of
our natural environment and the enhancement of the appreciation  of  the
distinctive features of our surroundings, and to the economic well-being
of the areas in which they exist; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern and in full accord with its long-
standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the  completion  of  the
Northville-Placid  Trail,  to  be  celebrated  with  a  myriad of events
throughout the year along the trail route in Northville, Piseco and Lake
Placid, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  Northville-Placid  Trail  (NPT)  is  a  long  distance
north-south  hiking  trail  that  runs  nearly  the entire length of the
Adirondack Park, winding through the river valleys and accessing some of
the wildest areas of  the  Northeast;  for  those  who  value  solitude,
human-powered  recreation, and the restorative powers of wilderness, the
NPT represents a rare experience; and
 
  WHEREAS, The NPT is one of the oldest hiking trails  in  the  United
States;  its  construction  began  in  1922  as  one  of the first major
projects of the newly formed  Adirondack  Mountain  Club;  completed  in
1924,  this 138-mile route transverses the Adirondack Park from the Town
of Northville to Lake Placid; and
 
  WHEREAS, Initially  called  the  Long  Trail,  its  designation  was
changed  to  avoid  confusion  with  Vermont's  recently undertaken long
distance trail of the same  name;  both  of  these  trails  predate  the
Appalachian Trail, and are part of the legacy of protecting and enjoying
the wild spaces of this country through foot-travel; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  initial process of building the trail was made easier
by the history of logging in the Adirondack Park; much of the paths were
former logging roads, leading to camps deep in the  woods;  one  of  the
most  famous  characters of the NPT, the hermit Noah John Rondeau, was a
former logger who set up his 'Cold River City'  at  one  such  abandoned
camp  he  had  previously  worked  in;  his hermitage is one of the most
iconic landmarks along the trail, nestled in an area  as  far  from  any
road as possible; and
 
  WHEREAS, The low-lying nature of the river valleys the trail follows
also  allowed for an almost organic passage between the various mountain
ranges in the area; the highest the trail ever climbs is a modest  3,008
feet  near  Blue  Mountain  Lake;  instead  of  expansive views into the
distance, the hiker witnesses quiet backcountry ponds and lakes, massive
old- and second-growth forests, and the rugged terrain of  truly  remote
places; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  between  the  stretches of wild walking, the
hiker passes through or close  to  Adirondack  towns  with  options  for
resupply and supporting local economies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since its completion, the NPT has undergone a few reroutes
and is now maintained by the Northville-Placid Chapter of the Adirondack
Mountain Club  and  the  New  York  State  Department  of  Environmental
Conservation  (DEC);  it  is  primarily  used  for  hiking, backpacking,
snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the NPT runs through some of the most  remote  areas
of  the  Adirondack  Park,  making its way through forests and up hills,
around rivers and ponds; a few sections will  also  bring  you  to  road
walks  in  Piseco,  Wakely  Dam,  and  Long  Lake;  the  scenery changes
constantly as you make your way along the NPT, and traversing this trail
is  a  wonderful  way  to  experience  the  beauty  of  nature  and  the
Adirondacks; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  the Northville-Placid Trail is in direct
correlation to the efforts  of  the  Northville-Placid  Chapter  of  the
Adirondack  Mountain  Club  and  the  New  York  State  Department  of
Environmental Conservation, whose involvement is, and always  has  been,
characterized  by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and
an uncompromising standard of excellence in all endeavors on  behalf  of
the trail and the visitors it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is incumbent upon all citizens to recognize and applaud
the efforts of organizations such as the  Northville-Placid  Chapter  of
the  Adirondack  Mountain  Club  and  the  New  York State Department of
Environmental Conservation which work tirelessly on behalf of protecting
our  natural  surroundings  for  the  benefit  of  present  and  future
generations of New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the  completion  of  the
Northville-Placid Trail; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Northville-Placid Chapter of the Adirondack  Mountain
Club and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.
