 AN ACT directing the commissioner of transportation to conduct  a  study

  a high volume of visual and hearing impaired pedestrians

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The commissioner of transportation shall conduct a study on
 the feasibility and process for installing pedestrian control devices at
 traffic intersections involving a state-owned public  road  where  there
 may be a high volume of pedestrians with visual and hearing impairments.
 Such  study  shall  include  an  estimate  of how many intersections may
 require such devices, the method used for determining such  estimate,  a
 process  for  implementation,  and  the  estimated  costs  involved. For
 purposes of this act, "pedestrian control device" shall  mean  an  elec-
 tronically operated traffic control device composed of one or more indi-
 cations  which  directs  pedestrian  traffic at signalized locations and
 assists the visual and hearing impaired in  safely  crossing  a  traffic
 intersection.
  §  2.  Upon completion of the study but no later than the thirty-first
 of December next succeeding the date on which this act shall have become
 a law, the commissioner of transportation shall submit a report based on
 the findings of the study to the governor, the  temporary  president  of
 the  senate,  the  speaker  of  the assembly, the minority leader of the
 senate, the minority leader of the assembly, the  chair  of  the  senate
 transportation  committee,  and the chair of the assembly transportation
 committee which shall include the findings and  recommendations  of  the
 study described in section one of this act.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
