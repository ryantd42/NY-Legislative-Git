BY: M. of A. Fitzpatrick
 
  COMMENDING  Margaret  C. Timoney upon the occasion
  of her designation as Grand Marshal of the 2024  New
  York City St.  Patrick's Day Parade
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
individuals  of  true  purpose  and  worthy  accomplishment  who  work
diligently to preserve and celebrate their rich cultural heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Margaret C. Timoney, also known as Maggie, upon the occasion  of
her designation as Grand Marshal of the 2024 New York City St. Patrick's
Day Parade; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  acknowledgment  of  this most prestigious appointment,
Maggie Timoney will have the honor of leading the 263rd consecutive  New
York  City  St.  Patrick's Day Parade up Fifth Avenue on Saturday, March
16, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Organizers of the historic parade  are  using  this  year's
theme  to  celebrate  the  role of women within the Irish community, who
form the backbone of so many different societies; and
 
  WHEREAS, A native of Ballina, County Mayo, Ireland,  Maggie  Timoney
currently resides in Connecticut with her husband and two children; and
 
  WHEREAS, A well-educated and well-rounded individual, Maggie Timoney
received  both  her  B.A. and M.B.A. at Iona University; during her time
there, she was a standout player on  the  women's  basketball  team  and
often  credits  her  time  spent  on  the  court  for  helping shape her
leadership skills; and
 
  WHEREAS, An extraordinary woman, Maggie Timoney  immigrated  to  the
United  States  from Ireland on a basketball scholarship; she is now the
fifth woman to lead the parade since  its  inception  in  1762  and  the
second that is from Ireland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rising to success, Maggie Timoney is the current President
& CEO of HEINEKEN USA based in White Plains, New York; during  her  over
20-year  tenure  with  the  HEINEKEN  Group  in  the  United  States,
Netherlands, Canada and Ireland, Maggie has been recognized for being  a
transformational  leader  as  demonstrated  through her results at a P&L
level, combined with a high impact in both cultural and  social  change;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Prior to joining HEINEKEN, Maggie Timoney worked for Gallo
and Anheuser-Busch; with a truly impressive work ethic, she continues to
trailblaze  as  a  senior  female  executive  in  a  traditionally
male-dominated  industry;  today, she is the first woman to serve as CEO
of a major beer company in the Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
 
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Margaret C. Timoney upon the  occasion  of  her  designation  as
Grand Marshal of the 2024 New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Margaret C. Timoney.
