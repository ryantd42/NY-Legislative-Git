  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow any non-seasonally  appointed  sworn  member  or
 officer  of  the  division of law enforcement, police officer, or forest
 ranger in the department of  environmental  conservation;  any  regional
 state  park  police  officer; or any university police officer to become
 covered by the provisions of a special 20-year  retirement  plan,  which
 will  provide a benefit of one-half of final average salary upon retire-
 ment and an additional benefit of one-sixtieth of final  average  salary
 for each year of creditable service in excess of 20 years, not to exceed
 12 years.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $6.6 million in
 the annual contributions of the State of New York for  the  fiscal  year
 ending  March  31,  2025.  In  future  years  this cost will vary but is
 expected to average 3.9% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $70.3 million which will
 be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment.  This  estimate
 assumes  that payment will be made on March 1, 2025. If the State of New
 York elects to amortize this cost over a 10-year period,  the  cost  for
 each year including interest would be $8.98 million.
 S. 8472  4
 
  These  estimated costs are based on 1,228 affected members employed by
 the State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $131  million
 as of March 31, 2023.
