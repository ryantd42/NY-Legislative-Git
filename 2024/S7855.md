 SHALL remain open for at  least  six  consecutive  hours  between  eight
 o'clock  in  the  forenoon  and eight o'clock in the evening. The voting
 upon a proposition shall be by ballot  and  each  proposition  submitted
 shall  be  separately  stated and numbered thereon. The town clerk shall
 give notice of such special town election at the expense of the town  by
 the  publication  of  a notice in a newspaper published in said town, if
 there be any, or, if there be none, in  a  newspaper  published  in  the
 county  having general circulation in the town, specifying the time when

 which  the  polls will remain open for the purpose of receiving ballots,
 and setting forth in full all propositions to be voted upon.  The  first
 publication  of such notice shall be at least ten days prior to the time
 of such special election. In addition, the  town  clerk  shall  post  or
