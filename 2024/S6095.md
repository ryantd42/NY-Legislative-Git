  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

 exemption pursuant to this section on the  latest  completed  assessment
 roll  an  application  form  and  a notice that such application must be
 filed on or before the taxable status date and be approved in order  for
 the  exemption  to  be  granted.  THE ASSESSING AUTHORITY SHALL MAIL A
 SECOND COPY OF THE APPLICATION AND NOTICE REQUIRED BY  THIS  SUBDIVISION
 THIRTY  DAYS  PRIOR  TO  THE  APPROPRIATE  TAXABLE  STATUS DATE WHEN THE
 ASSESSING AUTHORITY HAS NOT YET RECEIVED A  COMPLETED  APPLICATION.  The
 assessing  authority  shall,  within  three  days  of the completion and
 filing of the tentative assessment roll, notify by  mail  any  applicant
 who  has included with his application at least one self-addressed, pre-
 paid envelope, of the approval or denial of the  application;  provided,
 however, that the assessing authority shall, upon the receipt and filing
 of  the  application, send by mail notification of receipt to any appli-
 cant who has included two of such envelopes with the application.  Where

 shall state the reasons for such denial and shall further state that the
 applicant may have such determination reviewed in the manner provided by
 law. Failure to mail any such application [form] FORMS or notices or the
