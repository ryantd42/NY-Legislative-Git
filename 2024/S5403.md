 S. 5403  3

 APPLY  TO  ANY  EMPLOYEE  WHO  IN GOOD FAITH REASONABLY BELIEVES THAT AN

 BUSINESS; (B) there is an imminent and  serious  danger  to  the  public

 principal place of business. In any such action, the  parties  shall  be
 entitled to a jury trial.
  (c)  [It  shall  be  a  defense to any action brought pursuant to this
 section that the retaliatory action was predicated  upon  grounds  other

 SECTION IS ESTABLISHED WHEN THE COMPLAINANT DEMONSTRATES THAT A MOTIVAT-
 ING  FACTOR  FOR THE RETALIATORY ACTION VIOLATES SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS
 SECTION. REMEDIES FOR VIOLATION OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION SHALL
 BE LIMITED SOLELY TO THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPHS (E), (F)  AND  (G)  OF

 ish  the rights, privileges, or remedies of any employee under any other

 performance  of such agent's official duties, whether or not such action

  (C) PRIOR TO DISCLOSING INFORMATION PURSUANT TO  SUBPARAGRAPH  (I)  OF
 PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION, AN EMPLOYEE SHALL HAVE MADE A GOOD
 FAITH EFFORT TO PROVIDE THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY OR HIS OR HER  DESIGNEE
 THE INFORMATION TO BE DISCLOSED AND SHALL PROVIDE THE APPOINTING AUTHOR-
 ITY  OR  DESIGNEE  A  REASONABLE  TIME TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION UNLESS
 THERE  IS  IMMINENT  AND SERIOUS DANGER TO PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY.  FOR
 THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, AN EMPLOYEE  WHO  ACTS  PURSUANT  TO
 THIS  PARAGRAPH  SHALL  BE  DEEMED  TO HAVE DISCLOSED INFORMATION TO A

 SCOPE OF SUCH PERSON'S EMPLOYMENT, AND WHICH IS: (I) IN VIOLATION OF ANY
 LAW, RULE OR REGULATION REGARDING GOVERNMENTAL ACTION; OR  (II)  CREATES
 AND  PRESENTS  A SUBSTANTIAL AND SPECIFIC DANGER TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH OR
 SAFETY. "LAW, RULE OR REGULATION" INCLUDES: (I) ANY DULY ENACTED  FEDER-
 AL,  STATE  OR  LOCAL  STATUTE OR ORDINANCE; (II) ANY RULE OR REGULATION
 PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO ANY SUCH STATUTE  OR  ORDINANCE;  OR  (III)  ANY
 JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION, RULING OR ORDER.
  3. (a) Where an employee is subject to dismissal or other disciplinary
 action  under a final and binding arbitration provision, or other disci-
 plinary procedure contained in a collectively negotiated  agreement,  or
 under section seventy-five of this title or any other provision of state
 or  local law, OR TO THE ELIMINATION OF JOB TITLE OR CLASSIFICATION THAT
 UNIQUELY FITS AND SINGLES OUT SUCH EMPLOYEE and the employee  reasonably
 believes  THAT  SUCH  dismissal [or], other disciplinary action OR OTHER
 ADVERSE ACTION would not have been taken but for the  conduct  protected
 under  subdivision  two  of this section, he or she may assert such as a
 defense before the designated arbitrator or hearing officer. The  merits
 of  such defense shall be considered and determined as part of the arbi-
 tration award or hearing officer decision of the matter. If there  is  a
 finding  that the dismissal or other disciplinary action is based solely
 on a violation by the employer of such subdivision,  the  arbitrator  or
 hearing officer shall dismiss or recommend dismissal of the disciplinary
 proceeding,  as appropriate, and, if appropriate, reinstate the employee
 with back pay, and, in the case of an arbitration  procedure,  may  take
 other  appropriate action as is permitted in the collectively negotiated
 agreement.
  (b) Where an employee is subject to a collectively  negotiated  agree-
 ment  which  contains  provisions  preventing  an  employer  from taking
 adverse [personnel] actions and which contains a final and binding arbi-
 tration provision to resolve alleged violations of  such  provisions  of
 the agreement and the employee reasonably believes that such [personnel]
 action  would  not  have  been taken but for the conduct protected under
 subdivision two of this section, he or she may assert such  as  a  claim
 S. 5403  6
 
 before  the  arbitrator.  The  arbitrator  shall consider such claim and
 determine its merits and shall, if a determination  is  made  that  such
 adverse  [personnel]  action  is based on a violation by the employer of
 such subdivision, take such action to remedy the violation as is permit-
 ted by the collectively negotiated agreement.
  (c)  [Where]  IN ADDITION TO OR IN LIEU OF THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN
 PARAGRAPHS (A) AND (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, OR WHERE an employee is  not
 subject to any of the provisions of [paragraph (a) or (b) of this subdi-
 vision]  SUCH PARAGRAPHS, the employee may commence an action in a court
 of competent jurisdiction under the same terms and  conditions  AND  FOR
 THE SAME RELIEF as set forth in article twenty-C of the labor law.
  5.  EVERY PUBLIC EMPLOYER SHALL INFORM EMPLOYEES OF THEIR PROTECTIONS,
 RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS SECTION, BY POSTING A NOTICE  THEREOF.
 SUCH  NOTICES  SHALL  BE  POSTED  CONSPICUOUSLY IN EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND
 WELL-LIGHTED PLACES CUSTOMARILY FREQUENTED BY EMPLOYEES  AND  APPLICANTS
 FOR EMPLOYMENT.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
