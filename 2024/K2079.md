BY: M. of A. Otis
 
  CONGRATULATING  the  Rye  High School Boys Varsity
  Football Team for winning the New York State Class B
  Championship
 
  WHEREAS, The fabled tradition of gridiron success at Rye High School
has continued with the Rye Boys Varsity Football Team's victory  in  the
New  York  State  Class  B  Championship game topping defending champion
Maine-Endwell 28-7 at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse,  NY  on  October  3,
2023,  capturing the program's fourth state title in its history and its
first since 2008; and
 
  WHEREAS, The achievement follows the building of  one  of  the  most
solid  and  consistent  high school programs in the state, finishing the
regular season winning four straight games with a 6-2 record, outscoring
opponents 152 to 40, and amassing a  staggering  1,507  yards  of  total
offense through an explosive offense and a stingy defense throughout the
season; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This championship season was made possible with the Garnet
combination  of  explosive  offense,  big  play  defense,  and  physical
strength  at  the  line  that powered point production and shutting down
opponents, strategic muscle that was apparent regardless of the size  of
opposing teams; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The 2023 Garnets used these strengths, play execution, and
great game strategy to move through the successive rounds  of  sectional
and  state  playoff  tournament  competition  against  worthy opponents;
sectional victories began  with  an  impressive  33-18  victory  against
Nyack,  which was followed by a 41-13 victory over the Ardsley Panthers,
and later, a Section 1  Class  B  Final  against  Pleasantville  with  a
convincing win of 35-21; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rye's  tremendous  offense continued to shine in the State
Regional Final against Section 9 champion Port Jervice with a victory of
28-14; this was followed by the Class B State Semifinal playoff win over
Section 2 champion Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk with  a  score  of  24-10  to
clinch their spot in the state championship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  team, finishing the season with an outstanding record
of 12-2, including winning their last 10 consecutive games, were loyally
and  enthusiastically  supported  by  family,  fans,  friends,  and  the
community  at  large,  all treated to the contact, sights, and sounds of
high school football at the highest level; and
 
  WHEREAS, We congratulate the Rye High School Boys  Varsity  Football
Team  and  its members, James Kennedy; Ameer White; Aka Udeagha; Charlie

Proudian, AJ Thompson, and Director of  Athletics,  Susan  Reid  Dullea,
their  commitment  and collaboration with the team's outstanding players
combined to make the championship possible and the new page in Rye  High
football history possible; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  season also marked the fourth Rye High School Varsity
Football State Championship for Rye's legendary Head Coach,  Dino  Garr,
whose  Rye  teams  have  appeared  in  seven state title games; the team
benefiting from Coach Garr's 354 career victories, 10 shy of  the  state
record,  and  from  Coach Garr's reputation for building squads built on
the principles of teamwork, preparation, strategy and  the  belief  that
every  player  can  be part of an effort that they will remember for the
rest of their lives; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate and honor the Rye High School Boys Varsity Football Team on
this  New  York  State  Title; the winning of a state championship is an
enormous achievement, made  possible  this  season  through  the  team's
exceptional  skill,  resiliency,  teamwork, and energy, delivered in the
spirit of the best collegiate  and  professional  championship  football
teams; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the members, coaches, and administrators of the Rye  High
School Boys Varsity Football Team.
