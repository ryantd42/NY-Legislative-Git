  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 7, 2024, as Girls and Women in  Sports  Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is with noble admiration that this Legislative Body pays
just  tribute  to  those  venerable  female  athletes  who  distinguish
themselves through notable achievements and represent  their  State  and
Nation with pride and determination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body hereby memorializes Governor Kathy
Hochul to proclaim February 7, 2024, as Girls and Women in Sports Day in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  National
Girls and Women in Sports Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year, National Girls and Women in Sports Day (NGWSD)
is observed on February 7th with the purpose of promoting the  narrative
of  women in every aspect of sports, and breaking the gender stereotypes
built around the sports industry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, National Girls and Women in Sports Day aims to
motivate girls and women to play sports and be energetic, and to realize
their full potential, seizing each day as an opportunity to  play  their
favorite sport for a mental and physical boost; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Girls and Women in Sports Day was first observed
in  1987  to  remember  the  Olympic  volleyball  player  Flo  Hyman,
acknowledging  her  as the best female volleyball player of her time and
recognizing her tireless work in promoting equal representation of women
in sports; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since Flo Hyman's death, the day has evolved to commemorate
all  women  athletes,  their  achievements,  the  positive  impacts  of
inclusion  of  women  in sports, and to address the challenges regarding
equal  participation  of  women  in  sports  activities;  the  day  also
appreciates the progression made since the enactment of the civil rights
law, Title IX; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Title IX was a public law passed in 1972, which completely
changed the women's narrative in sports; this vital  legislation  called
for equal participation of everyone in all federally funded programs and
activities;  subsequently,  all  public  schools  would ensure equitable
sports opportunities to the students, regardless of their gender; and
 
  WHEREAS, A true breakthrough in women's sports, prior  to  Title  IX
only  one  in  27  girls  had  access  to sports activities; today, that
statistic has lowered to two in  five  girls,  which  is  a  commendable
improvement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Celebrated  in  all 50 states, National Girls and Women in
Sports  Day  is  celebrated  by  organizing  community  events,  award
ceremonies, and other sports activities which inspire girls and women to
play sports and be active; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sports  competition instills the values of teamwork, pride
and accomplishment, and the outstanding girls  and  women  in  athletics
across  this  great Empire State have clearly made a contribution to the
spirit of excellence which is their tradition; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 7, 2024 as  Girls
and Women in Sports Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
