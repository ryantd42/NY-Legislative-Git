BY: Senator STEC
 
  COMMENDING  Tanner Varden upon the occasion of his
  designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Tanner Varden upon the occasion of his designation as  recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, A 15-year-old sophomore of Saranac Lake High School and the
Adirondack Education Center, Tanner Varden, and  his  stepfather,  Glenn
Strack, were driving home on Friday, February 16, 2024, when they neared
the  scene  of  an accident, evidenced by tire tracks going off the road
and a downed sign; Ana Candelli, a senior at Paul Smith's College,  slid
off  the  snow-covered  roadway during her commute to her job at the Red
Cross in Morrisonville; and
 
  WHEREAS, While Ana slowed her car to negotiate a curve in the  road,
the  brakes were not working; she tried to use the emergency brake to no
avail; the vehicle flipped after swerving and hitting a  pole,  becoming
wedged  between  two  trees on an embankment; she was able to call 9-1-1
before losing consciousness, suspended upside down by her seatbelt; and
 
  WHEREAS, This remarkable teen shouted for  his  stepfather  to  pull
over  after  which  he  slid  down  the embankment to reach the stranded
victim; at this time, two other people stopped to help; knocking on  the
window  twice  without receiving a response, Tanner Varden knew everyone
had to act quickly to pry open the door; and
 
  WHEREAS, When Ana Candelli  regained  consciousness,  Tanner  Varden
asked her the appropriate questions to ascertain whether she had serious
injuries, assisted her while she exited the vehicle, and talked with her
until  the  ambulance  arrived;  he  helped a member of the Saranac Lake
Volunteer Rescue Squad to apply a neck brace;  Ana  was  later  released
from the hospital with only a concussion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately 24 hours after the rescue, Tanner Varden and
his stepfather were driving home when they  observed  a  woman  who  was
taking  photos  of  the crash site; stopping to ask whether she knew the
young woman involved in the accident, they learned  that  she  is  Karen
Candelli  who  will  always  be  grateful to the selfless and courageous
 
young man who saved her daughter's life and prevented a  parent's  worst
nightmare; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After graduating high school in 2026, Tanner Varden's goal
is to be an emergency medical  technician  (EMT),  emergency  department
doctor,  or  registered  nurse  (RN),  focusing  on  trauma  response; a
full-time student and part-time employee of McDonald's, he  is  also  an
active participant in the Upward Bound program at SUNY Plattsburgh where
he  prepares  himself  for  a  future  of  opportunity  through  college
preparation activities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Whether he is crunching numbers for an algebra examination,
serving smiles with every order, or meeting with  Upward  Bound,  Tanner
Varden  approaches  each  day with enthusiasm and determination; passion
for helping others and satisfaction in making a positive impact on their
lives provide him with the ultimate  goal  of  spreading  happiness  and
making the world a better place one interaction at a time; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tanner  Varden,  in his spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated his character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without thought of danger or reward when others need help; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Tanner Varden upon the occasion of his designation as recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Tanner Varden.
