  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute  to
those  organizations  of  artistic  significance  whose  creative
contributions  have  helped  further  the  cultural  enrichment  of  our
communities and our Nation; and

  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  mission  of  the  Disabled  Persons  Action
Organization  (DPAO)  to  provide  quality  and effective individualized
services to developmentally disabled children and  adults  in  Jefferson
and  Lewis  County;  the  services  are  primarily geared toward helping
families cope with the stress of caring for their disabled  loved  ones;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The concert series now known as "DPAO Concerts for a Cause"
is  the  principal  fundraising  activity  for  Disabled  Persons Action
Organization, ultimately allowing this esteemed organization the ability
to reliably provide services for the approximately  600  families  under
its purview; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The concert series, in conjunction with its 50th year, has
been seen as a series rebirth by the DPAO Foundation Executive Director,
Michael W. Campbell, who intends on introducing new genres and  acts  to
the lineup; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  series  began  unofficially with a Pink Floyd tribute
band concert at the Dulles State Office Building and has since grown  to
host  a  myriad  of  internationally  recognized  artists,  including
Foreigner, Journey, Johnny Cash, Reba, Train, The Doobie Brothers, Keith
Urban, Tony Bennett, and countless other incredible acts; and
 
  WHEREAS, Notable upcoming concerts include hard rock  bands  Warrant

yet-to-be-revealed band in August; and
 
  WHEREAS, The remarkable success of this renowned concert  series  is
due  in  large  part  to  its  loyal sponsors, area businesses, generous
musicians, and dedicated patrons and concert attendees; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is most fitting that  we  take  time  to  celebrate  the
musical  arts  of  our State and Nation and those esteemed organizations
who give of themselves unstintingly to foster  positive  and  expressive
environments  which promotes such art, to honor our musical artists, and
to express  our  appreciation  to  everyone  who  patronizes  the  arts,
acknowledging  that musical art is a profound expression of the soul and
the ultimate unifier; now, therefore, be
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  Disabled  Persons  Action
Organization's Annual Concert Series; and be it further
