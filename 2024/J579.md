  COMMEMORATING  the  75th Anniversary of the Junior
  League of Bronxville
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative  Body  to  acknowledge
and  celebrate  outstanding  organizations  that  work  to  promote  the
wellbeing of the citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Junior League of  Bronxville  on
Saturday, March 25, 2023, at the Bronxville Field Club; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  event will celebrate a "Mosaic of Members & Mission,"
highlighting the League's impact across the  communities  it  serves  in
Bronxville, Eastchester, Mount Vernon, Tuckahoe, and Yonkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Junior League of Bronxville (JLB) has been in operation
for  75  years,  serving the local community through promoting literacy,
health, wellness and  safety  for  children,  women,  and  families;  it
continues  to  hold  true and strong to their educational and charitable
mission:  commitment to promoting voluntarism, developing the  potential
of  women  and  improving  communities  through the effective action and
leadership of trained volunteers; since its inception, the Junior League
of Bronxville has remained true to its core mission and values; and
 
  WHEREAS, Some of the Bronxville Junior  League's  earliest  projects
included  sewing  for the Red Cross, sponsoring a mobile library cart at
Lawrence Hospital, and running regular social events  for  seniors;  the
organization  has been passionate about helping children from the start,
with members in the 1940s volunteering at a well-baby clinic; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additional early endeavors of the JLB include  the  Musical
Participation  program  for  children  with cerebral palsy, bringing the
region's children together for theater performances such as  Hansel  and
Gretal,  free  public  lecture  series,  and fashion shows in support of
small businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, Historically, these Junior League members utilized  profits
from  their  self-run thrift store, The Penny Wise Shop in Mount Vernon,
to provide free classes, such as French Language, Art Appreciation,  and
Creative  Writing,  to  children  who  otherwise  could  not  afford the
opportunity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Continuing their legacy of service, in the late 1970s,  the
Junior  League  of Bronxville began a partnership with the Yonkers Court
Assistance  Program  for  Abused  Spouses;  the  program  involved  50
volunteers  who  assisted  victims  of abuse in more than 850 individual
cases; and
 
  WHEREAS, The JLB drafted a position statement on  domestic  violence
which  was later adopted by the New York State Junior Leagues and led to
the creation of the Domestic Violence Task Force; soon  thereafter,  the
statement  was  also  adopted  by the larger AJLI; a few years after the
 
program's inception, the JLB received  the  Yonkers  Soroptimist  Club's
Women-Helping-Women Award; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1981,  Bessie Jansen pitched the idea of compassionate
end-of-life care to the League; the JLB formed a Hospice Task Force  led
by  Sandra  Rueb,  providing  seed funds; Jansen Memorial Hospice joined
forces with the Home  Nursing  Association  of  Westchester  to  provide
patient care, and throughout the decade, the JLB continued their support
of  the  Jansen  Memorial  Hospice, and in 1984 established an endowment
fund to ensure the long-term financial success of the organization; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the 1990s, the Junior League of Bronxville  founded  the
Bereavement Center of Westchester; the Tree House, a special program for
children  who  are  grieving  the  loss  of  a  parent  or  sibling, was
established in 1995; this was one of the  first  grief  centers  created
solely for children and their families in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recent years, the JLB took initiative to battle hunger
by providing dinner for 100 guests of the Project Family Dinner  Program
of Community Service Associates in Mount Vernon, New York, launching its
Mobile Food Pantry partnership with Feeding Westchester, and by creating
a  program called "Feeding the Frontlines," where the League raised over
$55,000  to  purchase  meals  from  restaurants  struggling  during  the
pandemic  lockdown,  to  feed  first  responders  and essential workers,
including medical professionals, police  and  fire  departments,  public
works departments, and others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2022,  the  JLB also launched its Joyful Closet at the
Edward  Williams  School  in  Mount  Vernon,  in  partnership  with  the
nonprofit  organization  Bundles  of  Joy,  to  provide  children  the
opportunity  to  "shop"  for  essentials  such  as  school  supplies,
toiletries, clothing, and blankets; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2023,  the  Junior League of Bronxville is focusing on
three core pillars food insecurity, education, and family wellness;  the
organization  serves two Mobile Food Pantry locations, organizes cooking
events to supply meals for local soup kitchens, plans  to  continue  its
JLB  Book  Nook, and looks forward to hosting its 11th Annual Dorm Drive
to prepare high school girls for college; The JLB is also proud to offer
several scholarship awards to girls pursuing higher education, including
two scholarships that honor the memory of  cherished  and  admired  past
members, Cara Kealy and Erica Sevilla; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional organization and its role in improving the
quality of life in its community, fully confident that it will  continue
to  enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has experienced thus far; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  75th  Anniversary  of  the  Junior  League  of Central
Westchester; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Junior League of Bronxville.
