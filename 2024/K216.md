  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Kidney Disease Awareness Month in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2023,  as  Kidney  Disease
Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Kidney Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD)  is a major health problem
affecting 1.5 million New Yorkers and an  estimated  30  million  people
nationwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, CKD is a progressive condition in which kidneys do not work
as  well  as  they  should to filter waste, toxins, and fluids from your
body; and
 
  WHEREAS, CKD can progress quickly or take years to  worsen,  and  is
described  as having five stages, and progression through each stage can
eventually lead to kidney failure, also known as End Stage Renal Disease
(ESRD), which can be treated with a kidney replacement or dialysis; and
 
  WHEREAS, The incidence of  ESRD  is  rising  fast,  with  more  than
546,000  Americans  currently  receiving  treatment, including more than
500,000 dialysis patients  and  over  200,000  people  with  functioning
kidney transplants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  nearly  10,000  New  Yorkers are on the transplant
waiting list; New York State encourages all to join the  State's  tissue
and organ donation registry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  the fact that there are little to no signs of the
condition, most individuals are not aware they have kidney disease until
it reaches the later stages, thus making laboratory  tests  critical  in
the  diagnosis;  some  symptoms of CKD can include changes in urination,
swelling of the feet, ankles, hands,  and/or  face,  fatigue,  weakness,
shortness  of  breath,  ammonia  breath  or ammonia or metallic taste in
mouth, back or flank pain, itching, loss of appetite, nausea,  vomiting,
and if diabetic, more hypoglycemic episodes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tragically, in 2016, more than 100,000 Americans died from
end stage kidney disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Diabetes and hypertension are the  two  leading  causes  of
chronic kidney disease which strikes minorities disproportionately; and
 
  WHEREAS,  African  Americans  are affected at a rate of nearly three
times that of Caucasians; the number of new cases of kidney failure  per
million  is  783  for  African  Americans and 295 for whites; Hispanics,
Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans are  also  at  increased
risk; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Also  at particular risk are the elderly, as the chance of
developing kidney disease increases significantly with age; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People  afflicted  with  chronic  kidney disease typically
develop  other  chronic  and  life-threatening  conditions  such  as
cardiovascular disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Early  intervention  is  the  best method for managing the
complications of chronic kidney disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Northeast  Kidney  Foundation  provides  early
intervention,  community  education  and  support  programs  for  those
suffering from chronic kidney disease; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 2023, as Kidney
Disease Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
