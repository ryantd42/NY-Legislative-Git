Assembly Resolution No. 263
 
BY: M. of A. Joyner
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Oral Cancer Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Oral Cancer
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Oral Cancer Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Oral cancer is any cancerous tissue growth located  in  the
oral cavity (the mouth), on the lip, and the oropharynx (the part of the
throat at the back of the mouth); and
 
  WHEREAS, Oral cancer most commonly involves the tongue, the floor of
the mouth, the lip, and the minor salivary glands; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Most  oral  cancers look very similar under the microscope
and are called "squamous cell" carcinomas which are malignant  and  tend
to spread rapidly; and
 
  WHEREAS, While smoking and tobacco use are still major risk factors,
the  fastest  growing segment of oral cancer patients in young, healthy,
nonsmoking individuals is exposure to the HPV-16 virus (human  papilloma
virus), the same virus which is responsible for the majority of cervical
cancers in women; and
 
  WHEREAS, From a gender perspective, for decades oral cancer affected
six  men  for  every  woman;  that ratio has now become two men to every
woman; and
 
  WHEREAS, While  published  studies  do  not  exist  to  draw  finite
conclusions,  it  is  understood  that this increase is due to lifestyle
changes, primarily the increased number of women smokers over  the  last
few decades; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  oral  cancer  occurs  twice  as often in the
African-American population as in Caucasians,  and  survival  statistics
for African-Americans over five years are also poorer at 33%, versus 55%
for Caucasians; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Oral  cancer  frequently  has  no  symptoms; however, when
symptoms do occur, the most common include a sore or ulcer on the lip or
in the mouth that does not heal; a lump on the lip, in the mouth, or  in
the  neck;  a  white  or red patch on the gums, tongue, or lining of the
mouth; unusual bleeding, pain, or numbness in the mouth; oral pain  that
does  not  go  away; difficulty or pain with chewing, swallowing, or jaw
opening; swelling of the jaw that causes dentures to fit  poorly  or  to
 
become  uncomfortable;  tooth loosening; bad breath; sensory loss in the
face; abnormal taste in the mouth; or tongue problems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When detected early, oral cancer patients have an 80 to 90
percent survival rate; and
 
  WHEREAS, Oral cancer screening should be a  routine  part  of  every
annual  dental  examination; regular check-ups, including an examination
of the entire mouth, are essential in the early detection  of  cancerous
and  pre-cancerous  conditions; an individual may have a very small, but
dangerous, oral spot or sore and not  be  aware  of  it;  when  abnormal
tissue or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to the Centers of Disease Control (CDC), anyone
over the age of 17 should get an annual screening for  oral  cancer  and
anyone  with  a history of oral cancer should have a screening every six
months; and
 
  WHEREAS, The health and well-being of the people of the State of New
York is of paramount importance to this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, The observance of Oral Cancer Awareness Month  provides  an
opportunity  to focus on this significant and complex medical condition,
to provide information on and raise public awareness  and  understanding
of  its causes, effects, and treatments, and to highlight its importance
to citizens of the State of New York of all ages; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Oral Cancer
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
