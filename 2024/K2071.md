  HONORING  Sharon  Kelly  upon  the occasion of her
  designation for special recognition by the New  York
  State Office for the Aging on May 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Sharon Kelly
upon the occasion of her designation for special recognition by the  New
York  State  Office  for the Aging on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at the Hart
Theatre Lounge at The Egg Performing Arts Center in  Albany,  New  York;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Each May, the New York State Office for the Aging pauses to
acknowledge  the outstanding contributions made by older citizens during
National Older Americans Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of older generations have helped  build  and  shape
our  Nation  to  be  the  greatest  in the world; they have defended our
freedoms and values to ensure that those who come after  them  may  have
better  lives; nowhere in the Nation is the legacy of their efforts more
visible and more a part of the lives of all citizens than  here  in  the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sharon  Kelly  has  continually  demonstrated  extreme
competence, extraordinary intelligence, and diligent leadership  in  her
unwavering service to her community and, consequently, has been selected
for this most prestigious honor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ever active in her community, Sharon Kelly volunteers at a
myriad of organizations in Lewis County, such as the Lewis County Taking
Care of Our Own, where she helps to  raise  money  for  Beta  Sigma  Phi
Sorority's charitable efforts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Truly  valuing  community  welfare  and  literacy  amongst
residents,  Sharon  Kelly  worked  with  the  Greater  Thousand  Islands
Literacy  Council  and  the Lewis County General Hospital Auxiliary; she
has also served as a member of the New York State  Reading  Association,
St.  Theresa's  Guild,  Lowville Food pantry, and Lewis County Christmas
Sharing/Santa for Seniors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by
individuals  for  the benefit of others which Sharon Kelly has displayed
throughout her life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sharon Kelly has enriched the lives of her family,  friends
and  colleagues through her love and respect for others, and through the
wisdom which comes from many years of living life to the  fullest;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Sharon Kelly upon the occasion  of  her  designation  for  special
recognition  by  the  New  York  State  Office  for the Aging; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
