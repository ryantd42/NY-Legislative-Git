 AN ACT authorizing the county of Nassau assessor to accept  an  applica-
  tion for a real property tax exemption from Lubavitch of Old Westbury

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Lubavitch of Old Westbury an application for exemption from real proper-
 ty taxes pursuant to section 420-a and 462 of the real property tax  law
 with  respect to the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 assessment rolls for all of
 the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school taxes and all of the  2022  and  2023
 general  taxes  for the parcel owned by such organization located at 153
 Bacon Road, town of Old Westbury, county of Nassau, otherwise  known  as
 Nassau  county  tax  map section 19, block E, lot 2000. If accepted, the
 application shall be reviewed as if it had been received  on  or  before
 the taxable status date established for such assessment roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the  subject roll. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  roll,  the  applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
