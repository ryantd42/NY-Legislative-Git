 AN ACT to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to paid fami-
  ly medical leave
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 120 of the workers' compensation law, as amended by
 chapter 61 of the laws of  1989,  the  section  heading  as  amended  by
 section  31  of  part  SS of chapter 54 of the laws of 2016, the opening
 paragraph as amended by chapter 105 of the laws of 2019, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  §  120.  Discrimination against employees. 1. It shall be unlawful for
 any employer or his or her duly authorized agent to discharge or fail to
 reinstate pursuant to section two hundred three-b of this chapter, or in
 any other manner discriminate against an  employee  as  to  his  or  her
 employment  because  such  employee  has  claimed  or attempted to claim
 compensation from such employer, requested a  claim  form  for  injuries
 received  in  the course of employment, or claimed or attempted to claim
 any benefits provided under this chapter or because he or she has testi-
 fied or is about to testify in a proceeding under this  chapter  and  no
 other valid reason is shown to exist for such action by the employer.
  2.  Any  complaint  alleging  such an unlawful discriminatory practice
 must be filed within two years of the commission of such practice.  Upon
 finding that an employer has violated this section, the board shall make
 an order that any employee so discriminated against shall be restored to
 employment or otherwise restored to the position or privileges he or she
 would  have  had  but  for  the discrimination, IF SUCH REINSTATEMENT IS
 REQUESTED BY SUCH EMPLOYEE, and shall  be  compensated  by  his  or  her
 employer for any loss of compensation arising out of such discrimination
 together with such fees or allowances for services rendered by an attor-
 ney  or  licensed representative as fixed by the board. Any employer who
 violates this section shall be liable to a penalty of not less than  one
 hundred  dollars or more than five hundred dollars, as may be determined
 by the board. All such penalties shall be paid into the state  treasury.

 All  penalties, compensation and fees or allowances shall be paid solely
 by the employer. The employer alone and not his or her carrier shall  be
 liable  for  such penalties and payments.  Any provision in an insurance
 policy  undertaking  to  relieve  the  employer  from liability for such
 penalties and payments shall be void.
  3. An employer found to be  in  violation  of  this  section  and  the
 aggrieved  employee  must  report  to  the board as to the manner of the
 employer's compliance within thirty days of receipt of a final  determi-
 nation. In case of failure to report on compliance, or failure to comply
 with an order or penalty of the board within thirty days after the order
 or  notice  of penalty is served, except where timely application to the
 board for a modification, rescission or review of such order or  penalty
 has  been filed under section twenty-three of this chapter, the chair in
 any such case or, on the chair's consent,  any  party  may  enforce  the
 order or penalty in a like manner as an award of compensation.
  4. PURSUANT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED THREE-B OF THIS
 CHAPTER,  AN  EMPLOYEE SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO REQUEST REINSTATEMENT TO
 SUCH EMPLOYEE'S FORMER POSITION OF EMPLOYMENT BEFORE FILING A  COMPLAINT
 OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICE AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.
  §  2.  Section  203-a  of  the workers' compensation law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 3 to read as follows:
  3. AN ACTION MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST ANY COVERED EMPLOYER, AS DESCRIBED
 IN SECTION TWO HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE, WHO VIOLATES THE  PROVISIONS
 OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY OR TWO HUNDRED THREE-B OF THIS CHAPTER, BY
 OR ON BEHALF OF AN EMPLOYEE, AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION FIVE
 OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE, WHO HAS CLAIMED OR ATTEMPTED
 TO CLAIM PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS. A PLAINTIFF WHO PREVAILS ON A CLAIM
 ALLEGING  A  VIOLATION  OF  SECTION  ONE  HUNDRED  TWENTY OR TWO HUNDRED
 THREE-B OF THIS CHAPTER WITH REGARDS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE SHALL BE ENTI-
 TLED TO COMPENSATORY, ACTUAL, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES,  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF,
 REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS, AND OTHER SUCH REMEDIES AS A COURT
 MAY DEEM APPROPRIATE.
  §  3.  Section  203-b  of  the  workers' compensation law, as added by
 section 4 of part SS of chapter 54 of the laws of 2016,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  §  203-b.  Reinstatement following family leave. Any eligible employee
 of a covered employer who takes leave under this article shall be  enti-
 tled,  on  return from such leave, to be restored by the employer to the
 position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced, or
 to be restored to a comparable position with comparable employment bene-
 fits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment, PROVIDED, HOWEV-
 ER, THAT SUCH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO  REQUEST  REIN-
 STATEMENT  TO  ANY  SUCH  POSITION. The taking of family leave shall not
 result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to  the  date
 on which the leave commenced. Nothing in this section shall be construed
 to  entitle  any  restored  employee  to the accrual of any seniority or
 employment benefits during any period of leave, or any right, benefit or
 position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee
 not taken the leave. FURTHERMORE,  NOTHING  IN  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  BE
 CONSTRUED  TO REQUIRE AN EMPLOYEE TO REQUEST REINSTATEMENT TO HIS OR HER
 FORMER POSITION OF EMPLOYMENT, OR TO A COMPARABLE POSITION WITH COMPARA-
 BLE EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, PAY, AND OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF  EMPLOY-
 MENT,  BEFORE INITIATING A COMPLAINT AGAINST A COVERED EMPLOYER PURSUANT
 TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY OF THIS CHAPTER.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
