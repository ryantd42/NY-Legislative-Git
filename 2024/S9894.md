 Introduced  by  Sen.  STEC  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend  the  environmental  conservation  law  and  the  public
  service law, in relation to directing the public service commission to
  conduct  a  full  cost  benefit analysis of the technical and economic
  feasibility of renewable energy systems in the state of New  York  and
  to  compare such directly with other methods of electricity generation
  and makes certain changes relating to greenhouse gas emissions limits
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  1  of section 75-0107 of the environmental
 conservation law, as added by chapter  106  of  the  laws  of  2019,  is
 amended and a new subdivision 5 is added to read as follows:
  1.  No  later  than one year after the effective date of this article,
 the department shall, pursuant  to  rules  and  regulations  promulgated
 after  at least one public hearing, establish a statewide greenhouse gas
 emissions limit as a percentage of 1990 emissions, as estimated pursuant
 to section 75-0105 of this article, as follows:
  a. [2030] 2040: 60% of 1990 emissions.
  b. [2050] 2060: 15% of 1990 emissions.
  5. THE DEPARTMENT MAY TEMPORARILY SUSPEND OR  MODIFY  THE  GREENHOUSE
 GAS  EMISSIONS  LIMITS UNDER  SUCH  PROGRAM  PROVIDED  THAT  THE DEPART-
 MENT, AFTER CONDUCTING A PUBLIC HEARING, MAKES A FINDING THAT THE GREEN-
 HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS IMPEDES THE PROVISION OF  SAFE  AND  ADEQUATE
 ELECTRIC  SERVICE AND/OR THE DEPARTMENT, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE PUBLIC
 SERVICE COMMISSION, FINDS THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF  THE  LIMITS  WILL
 INCREASE UTILITY RATES IN EXCESS OF FIVE PERCENT.
  §  2.  Subdivisions 2 and 4 of section 66-p of the public service law,
 as added by chapter 106 of the laws of 2019,  are  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  2.  No later than June thirtieth, two thousand twenty-one, the commis-
 sion shall establish a program to require that: (a) a minimum of seventy
 percent of the state wide electric generation secured by  jurisdictional
 load  serving entities to meet the electrical energy requirements of all

 end-use customers in New York state in two thousand [thirty] FORTY shall
 be generated by renewable energy systems; and (b) that by the  year  two
 thousand [forty] FIFTY (collectively, the "targets") the statewide elec-
 trical  demand  system  will  be  zero  emissions.  In establishing such
 program, the commission shall consider and  where  applicable  formulate
 the program to address impacts of the program on safe and adequate elec-
 tric  service  in the state under reasonably foreseeable conditions. The
 commission may, in designing the  program,  modify  the  obligations  of
 jurisdictional  load  serving entities and/or the targets upon consider-
 ation of the factors described in this subdivision.
  4. The commission may temporarily suspend or  modify  the  obligations
 under  such  program  provided  that  the commission, after conducting a
 hearing as provided in section twenty of this chapter, makes  a  finding
 that  the  program  impedes  the provision of safe and adequate electric
 service; the program is likely to impair existing obligations and agree-
 ments; and/or that there is a significant increase in arrears or service
 disconnections that the commission determines is related to the program;
 AND/OR THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM  WILL
 INCREASE UTILITY RATES IN EXCESS OF FIVE PERCENT.
  §  3. Subdivision 1 of section 137 of the public service law, as added
 by section 11 of part O of chapter 58 of the laws of 2024, is amended to
 read as follows:
  1. "CLCPA targets" shall mean the public policies established  in  the
 climate  leadership  and community protection act enacted in chapter one
 hundred six of the laws of two  thousand  nineteen,  including  but  not
 limited  to  the  requirement  that  a minimum of seventy percent of the
 statewide electric generation be produced by renewable energy systems by
 two thousand [thirty] FORTY, that by the year two thousand [forty] FIFTY
 the statewide electrical demand system will generate zero emissions, and
 the procurement of at least nine gigawatts of offshore wind  electricity
 generation  by  two  thousand thirty-five, six gigawatts of photovoltaic
 solar generation by two thousand twenty-five and to support three  giga-
 watts of statewide energy storage capacity by two thousand thirty.
  § 4. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 66-x to
 read as follows:
