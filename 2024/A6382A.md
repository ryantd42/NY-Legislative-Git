  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow, with the approval of the Commissioner of Educa-
 tion, retired police officers, retired state troopers, and retired depu-
 ty sheriffs who are employed as school resource officers with an  annual
 salary  of  $65,000 or less to continue to receive their full retirement
 benefit, provided that such  employment  is  by  any  of  (1)  a  school
 district,  (2)  a board of cooperative educational services, or (3) by a
 county, city, town or village police department pursuant to  a  contract
 with a school district to provide such services. Currently, only retired
 police  officers  employed  as  school  resource  officers  by  a school
 district are allowed enhanced post-retirement earning.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Retirement
 System  (NYSLRS),  if this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative
 Session, the direct cost incurred would be the retiree's pension benefit
 paid while post-retirement earnings are between $35,000 and $65,000 each
 calendar year. The pension benefit expected to be  paid  by  the  NYSLRS
 during that 2-month period is estimated to be $15,000 per person.
 A. 6382--A  4
 
  In addition to the direct cost quoted above, there would be additional
 costs  in  the  form  of lost employer contributions due to non-billable
 post-retirement earnings, which is estimated to be $4,500 per person.
  Pursuant  to Section 25 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, the
 increased costs would be borne entirely by the State  of  New  York  and
 would  require  an  itemized appropriation sufficient to pay the cost of
 the provision.
  The number of members and retirees  who  could  be  affected  by  this
 legislation  cannot  be  readily  determined.  For  each retiree rehired
 pursuant to this proposal, an annual cost of  $19,500  is  expected.  If
 large  numbers  of retirees are rehired into such positions, significant
 annual costs would result.
