 factors, including, but not limited to: the quality [and practicability]
 of coverage on automotive accidents covered under such  insurance  poli-
 cies,  the  magnitude  of  need and interest in these types of insurance
 policies across the state,  [customer  satisfaction  and  fiscal  surety

 nonprofits  that  could  be  covered  by the expansion of eligibility of
 these policies for  organizations  that  are  tax-exempt  under  section
 501(c)(3)  of  the  federal  internal  revenue code. Such superintendent
 shall report the findings and any recommendations of such study  to  the
 governor  and the legislature no later than [four years after the effec-
 tive date of this act] SEPTEMBER 1, 2027.  A RISK RETENTION  GROUP  NOT
