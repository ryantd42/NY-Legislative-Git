  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  4140  of the public health law, subdivision 1 as
 amended by chapter 352 of the laws of 2013 and subdivision 3 as  amended
 by chapter 476 of the laws of 2002, is amended to read as follows:
  § 4140. Deaths; registration. 1. The death of each person who has died
 in  this state shall be registered immediately and not later than seven-
 ty-two hours after death or the finding of a dead human body, by  filing
 with  the  registrar  of the district in which the death occurred or the
 body was found a certificate of such death, in a manner  and  format  as
 prescribed  by  the commissioner, which shall include through electronic
 means in accordance with section forty-one hundred forty-eight  of  this
 title.
  2. WHEN A REGISTRAR FILES A CERTIFICATE OF DEATH UNDER SUBDIVISION ONE
 OF  THIS  SECTION, SUCH REGISTRAR SHALL ALSO FILE A CERTIFICATE OF DEATH
 WITH EACH BOARD OF ELECTIONS WITHIN THE STATE IN A MANNER PRESCRIBED  BY
 SUCH BOARD OF ELECTIONS.
  3.  If the certificate of death is properly executed and complete, the
 registrar of the district in which the death occurred shall then issue a
 burial or removal permit to the funeral director or undertaker. In  case
 the  death  occurred  from a disease which is designated in the sanitary
 code as a communicable disease, no  permit  for  the  removal  or  other
 disposition  of  the  body shall be issued by the registrar, except to a
 funeral  director  or  undertaker  licensed  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions  of  this chapter, under such conditions as may be prescribed
 in the sanitary code.
