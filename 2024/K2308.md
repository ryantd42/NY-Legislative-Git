  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 3-9, 2024, as Veterans  Awareness  Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of the Armed Services from the State of New York,
who have served so  valiantly  and  honorably  in  wars  in  which  this
country's  freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation of peace
in peacetime, deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative Body to commend  those
who  have  served in times of active conflict, as well as those who have
served in times of peace; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November  3-9,  2024,  the
week prior to our national Veteran's Day, held yearly on November 11, as
Veterans Awareness Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, November 11th is a national holiday set aside for Americans
to pay homage to the veterans of our military service organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  our  Nation's  history,  the  men and women of
America's  Armed  Forces  have  preserved  our  freedom,  protected  our
security  and  upheld  our  democratic  values;  from the battles of the
American Revolution through the  crucible  of  two  world  wars  to  the
present  war  on  terrorism,  our  men  and  women in uniform have stood
proudly in defense of the United States and for the  cause  of  liberty;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  true  meaning  of  our  Veteran's Day may not receive
enough attention on the one-day holiday set aside for this  purpose;  it
is  felt  that  an official week-long period is needed in which schools,
veterans organizations, and the general public could more broadly  focus
on, and show their appreciation for the veterans still with us; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  this  week in which we honor our veterans, schools
may spend more time on programs describing the reasons our men and women
were asked to serve our country; patients in  veterans  hospitals  could
receive  special visits; and attendance at various memorial services for
those lost in war could be encouraged and increased; and
 
  WHEREAS, Having exhibited their patriotism both at home and  abroad,
these  men and women demonstrated their love for their country and merit
forevermore, the highest respect of their State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our Nation's veterans deserve to be  recognized,  commended
and thanked by the people of the State of New York for their service and
for their dedication to their communities, their State and their Nation;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November  3-9,  2024,  the
 
week prior to our national Veteran's Day, held yearly on November 11, as
Veterans Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
