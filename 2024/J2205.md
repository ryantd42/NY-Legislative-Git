BY: Senator MURRAY
 
  COMMEMORATING August 26, 2024 as National Dog Day
 
  WHEREAS,  National Dog Day is annually celebrated on August 26th and
serves to galvanize the public to recognize the number of dogs that need
to be rescued each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 2004 by pet lifestyle expert and author, Colleen
Paige,  National  Dog  Day  was  created  in  response  to  a  lack  of
acknowledgement  about the selfless service of search and rescue dogs at
Ground Zero; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Dog Day honors dogs by giving them "a day" to show
deep appreciation for our long connection to each other; and  for  their
endearing  patience,  unquestioning  loyalty,  for  their  work,  their
capacity for love and their ability to impact our lives every day in the
most miraculous ways; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dogs put their lives on the line every day; for  their  law
enforcement  partner,  for  their  blind  companion,  for a child who is
disabled, for our freedom and safety by detecting bombs and  drugs,  and
also, by pulling victims of tragedy from wreckage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Dog  Day  also acknowledges family dogs and dogs
that work selflessly each day to save lives, keep  us  safe,  and  bring
comfort; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the first National Dog Day in 2004, approximately one
million  dogs  have been saved through adoptions nationwide; this effort
is now expanding to other countries, seeking to make National Dog Day an
international goal to save dogs around the globe; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, National  Dog  Day  wishes  to  encourage  dog
ownership  of  all  breeds, mixed and pure, and embraces the opportunity
for all dogs to live a happy, safe and abuse-free life; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  most  appropriate  that  this  great  Empire  State
recognizes  the  worthy  and beneficial purposes of celebrating National
Dog Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to call  attention
to  events that serve to bring people together for the united purpose of
actively pursuing improvements in their communities; now, therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate August 26, 2024, as National Dog Day.
