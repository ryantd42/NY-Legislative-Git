  tee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to  a  moratorium  on
  new  licensed  home care service agency approvals; and to amend part B
  of chapter 57 of the laws of 2018 amending the public health  law  and
  other laws relating to limitations on licensed home care service agen-
  cy contracts and registration of licensed home care services agencies,
  in relation to the moratorium on the processing and approval of appli-
  cations seeking licensure of a licensed home care services agency
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  local small business are the very lifeblood and economic
 building blocks of the empire state. These businesses are  important  to
 every  community  throughout  our  state:  they hire locally, they spend
 resources locally, they pay state and local taxes and they offer  essen-
 tial  services  that  improve  the quality of life of individuals at the
 local level. Without such local small businesses, our economy would  not
 be  able  to  function  in  a manner that benefits all our residents and
 reaches them in a very direct and personal  way.  A  quintessential  and
 leading example of the type of local, small business that provides life-
 changing services can be found in the form of licensed home care service
 agencies  (LHCSAs).  LHCSAs  are  a vital and essential component of our
 health care delivery system, interacting with patients on a daily basis,
 attending to their needs and standing on the very frontline  of  quality
 care. Furthermore, LHCSAs are very often small, local businesses started
 by  compassionate social entrepreneurs who saw a need in their community
 and who have succeeded because of the very personal,  trusting,  compas-
 sionate  and nurturing relationship they have with the individuals under
 their care.  Additionally, the range of  services  provided  by  LHCSAs,
 including  language  and cultural competency, is unique and valuable, to

 them, to the employees they hire and to our overall community and health
 care system. The need for home care services for our  senior  population
 is rising exponentially and local, small business LHCSAs have rationally
 grown  to meet this demand and provide skillful care for our loved ones.
 Moreover, LHCSAs often save the state money because they allow  individ-
 uals  to  remain  at  home, instead of moving to institutionalized care.
 However, puzzlingly, the department of health constantly  seems  focused
 on  threatening  LHCSAs ability to operate, as exemplified by a two year
 moratorium enacted in 2008 and  a  series  of  potentially  catastrophic
 provisions enacted as part of the 2018-19 New York state budget, includ-
 ing:  another  two  year  moratorium  on  new  LHCSA  approvals;  the
 construction of a limit on the number of LHCSAs with which managed  long
 term  care  plans  (MLTCP) can contract; and authorization of a forward-
 looking requirement that could be enacted in the future,  post  the  two
 year  moratorium, that will mandate that LHCSA applicants need to demon-
 strate "public need" and "financial feasibility" to receive approval. In
 sum, these changes have simply gone too far in terms  of  overregulating
 local small businesses that are trying to provide quality of life health
 services  to  some  of  our  most needy and vulnerable citizens. The new
 changes threaten the very social and economic existence of  the  locally
 centered  LHCSAs  that generations of New Yorkers have come to count on,
 letting them into their homes in times of  trial  and  perseverance.  In
 hindsight,  the recently enacted provisions have proven to be overreach-
 ing, unwise and onerous, and consequently must be modified.
  § 2. Subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (v) and (x) of paragraph  (j)  of
 subdivision  7  of  section 4403-f of the public health law, as added by
 section 9-a of part B of chapter 57 of the laws of 2018, are amended  to
 read as follows:
  (i)  The  commissioner may establish methodologies to limit the number
 of licensed home care services agencies  licensed  pursuant  to  article
 thirty-six  of  [the  public health law] THIS CHAPTER with which managed
 long term care plans may enter into contracts, provided that such  limi-
 tations  are  consistent with the specifications set forth in this para-
 graph. HOWEVER, BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ANY SUCH METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS,
 THE DEPARTMENT MUST HOLD A MINIMUM OF SIX PUBLIC HEARINGS  INCLUDING  AT
 LEAST  ONE  IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING REGIONS: THE CITY OF NEW YORK, LONG
 ISLAND, WESTCHESTER COUNTY, THE CAPITAL REGION,  CENTRAL  NEW  YORK  AND
 WESTERN NEW YORK TO HEAR FROM INTERESTED PARTIES THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY
 ANY  PROPOSED  METHODOLOGIES. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL WIDELY PUBLICIZE SUCH
 HEARINGS ONCE SCHEDULED, AND MUST SEND NOTICE OF SUCH  HEARINGS  TO  ALL
 LICENSED  HOME  CARE  SERVICES AGENCIES AT LEAST TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF
 EACH HEARING. THE HEARINGS MUST BE OFFICIALLY  TRANSCRIBED  AND  WRITTEN
 TESTIMONY AND COMMENTS MUST BE PERMITTED BOTH IN PERSON AND VIA MAIL AND
 ELECTRONIC  MEANS.  THE  DEPARTMENT SHALL FORMALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE
 PUBLIC HEARING COMMENTS AND WRITTEN TESTIMONY  BEFORE  PROMULGATING  ANY
 FINAL METHODOLOGIES.
  (ii)  Managed  long  term care plans operating in the city of New York
 and/or the counties of Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester may  enter  into
 contracts  with licensed home care services agencies in such region in a
 maximum number calculated based upon the following methodology:
  (A) As of October first,  two  thousand  [eighteen]  TWENTY-FIVE,  one
 contract  per  seventy-five  members  enrolled  in  the plan within such
 region; and
  (B) As of October  first,  two  thousand  [nineteen]  TWENTY-SIX,  one
 contract  per  one  hundred  members  enrolled  in  the plan within such
 region.
 A. 5426  3
 
  (iii) Managed long term care plans operating in  counties  other  than
 those  in  the city of New York and the counties of Nassau, Suffolk, and
 Westchester may enter into contracts with licensed  home  care  services
 agencies  in  such  region in a maximum number calculated based upon the
 following methodology:
  (A)  As  of  October  first,  two thousand [eighteen] TWENTY-FIVE, one
 contract per forty-five members enrolled in the plan within such region.
  (B) As of October  first,  two  thousand  [nineteen]  TWENTY-SIX,  one
 contract per sixty members enrolled in the plan within such region.
  (v) When calculating the number of additional contracts that a managed
 long term care plan may enter using the methodologies established pursu-
 ant to this paragraph, any fractional result shall be rounded [down] UP.
  (x)  This  subparagraph  applies where implementation of the limits on
 contracts with licensed home care service agencies of this paragraph (i)
 would otherwise require an enrollee's care to be  transferred  from  the
 enrollee's current licensed home care service agency to another licensed
 care service agency, and (ii) the enrollee (or the enrollee's authorized
 representative) wants the enrollee to continue to be cared for by one or
 more  employees  of  the  current licensed home care service agency, and
 that continuation would otherwise be  provided.  In  such  a  case:  the
 enrollee's  managed long term care plan may contract with the enrollee's
 current licensed home care service agency for the purpose of  continuing
 the  enrollee's  care  by  such  employee or employees, and the contract
 shall not count towards the limits on contracts under this paragraph for
 a period of [three months] ONE YEAR.
  § 3. Subdivisions 4 and 6 of section 3605 of the public health law, as
 amended by section 9-b of part B of chapter 57 of the laws of 2018,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  4.  The public health and health planning council shall not approve an
 application for licensure unless it is satisfied as to[: (a) the  public
 need  for  the existence of the licensed home health care service agency
 at the time and place and under the  circumstances  proposed;  (b)]  the
 character,  competence  and standing in the community of the applicant's
 incorporators, directors, sponsors, stockholders or operators[; (c)  the
 financial  resources  of  the proposed licensed home health care service
 agency and its sources of financial revenues; and (d) such other matters
 as it shall deem pertinent].
  6. Neither PUBLIC NEED, tax status nor profit-making status  shall  be
 criteria for licensure.
  §  4. Section 3605-b of the public health law, as added by section 9-d
 of part B of chapter 57 of the laws of  2018,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  §  3605-b.  Registration  of  licensed home care services agencies. 1.
 [(a)] Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no  licensed
 home  care  services agency (LHCSA) licensed pursuant to section thirty-
 six hundred five of this article  shall  be  operated,  provide  nursing
 services,  home  health  aide  services,  or  personal care services, or
 receive reimbursement from any source for the provision of such services
 during any period of time on or after January first, two thousand [nine-
 teen] TWENTY-SIX, unless it has registered with the  commissioner  in  a
 manner prescribed by the department.
  [(b)]  2.  A LHCSA that fails to submit a complete and accurate set of
 all required registration materials by the deadline established  by  the
 commissioner  [shall] MAY be required to pay a fee of [five] ONE hundred
 dollars for each FULL month [or part  thereof]  that  the  LHCSA  is  in
 default.  A LHCSA that failed to register in the prior year by the dead-
 A. 5426  4
 
 line of the current year shall not be  permitted  to  register  for  the
 upcoming registration period unless it submits any unpaid late fees.
  [(c)] 3. The department shall post on its public website a list of all
 LHCSAs,  which  shall  indicate  the current registration status of each
 LHCSA.
  [(d)] 4. The department shall  institute  proceedings  to  revoke  the
 license  of any LHCSA that fails to register for [two] THREE CONSECUTIVE
 annual registration periods[, whether or not such  periods  are  consec-
 utive.  The department shall have the discretion to pursue revocation of
 the license of a LHCSA on grounds that it evidences a  pattern  of  late
 registration over the course of multiple years].
  §  5. Section 9-e of part B of chapter 57 of the laws of 2018 amending
 the public health law and other laws relating to limitations on licensed
 home care service agency contracts and  registration  of  licensed  home
 care services agencies is amended to read as follows:
  §  9-e.  Effective  April  1,  [2018] 2025, the commissioner of health
 shall place a moratorium on the processing and approval of  applications
 seeking  licensure  of  a licensed home care services agency pursuant to
 section 3605 of the public health law that have not received  establish-
 ment  approval or contingent establishment approval by the public health
 and health planning council, except  for:  (a)  an  application  seeking
 licensure of a licensed home care services agency that is submitted with
 an  application  for  approval  as an assisted living program authorized
 pursuant to section 461-l of the social services law; (b) an application
 seeking approval to transfer ownership for  an  existing  licensed  home
 care  services agency that has been licensed and operating for a minimum
 of five years for the purpose of consolidating ownership of two or  more
 licensed  home  care  services  agencies; and (c) an application seeking
 licensure of a home care services  agency  where  the  applicant  demon-
 strates  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  commissioner  of  health  that
 submission of the application to the public health and  health  planning
 council  for  consideration  would  be  appropriate  on grounds that the
 application addresses a serious concern such as a lack of access to home
 care services in the geographic area or a lack of adequate and appropri-
 ate care, language and cultural competence, or special  needs  services.
 Such  moratorium  shall expire on March 31, [2020] 2027. In implementing
 the provisions of this section, the commissioner shall,  to  the  extent
 practicable,  review  and, where appropriate, prioritize presentation to
 the public health and health planning council of  complete  applications
 under paragraph (b) of this section where the applicants demonstrate, to
 the satisfaction of the commissioner, that the proposed change in owner-
 ship  is  consistent with the goals of paragraph (j) of subdivision 7 of
 section 4403-f of the public health law.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 the  amendments  to  section  4403-f  of  the  public health law made by
 section two of this act shall not affect  the  repeal  of  such  section
 pursuant  to  chapter  659 of the laws of 1997, as amended, and shall be
 deemed repealed therewith.
