 AN ACT to amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law,  in
  relation  to increasing the mandatory retirement age of New York state
  regional park police

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 4 of section 13.17 of the parks, recreation and
 historic  preservation  law,  as  amended  by chapter 662 of the laws of
 1972, is amended to read as follows:
  4. Any member appointed on or  after  April  first,  nineteen  hundred
 sixty-five  shall  be separated from such service upon attaining [sixty-
 two] SIXTY-FIVE years of age.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would increase the mandatory retirement age from  62  to  65
 for  members  of the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement
 System (NYSLPFRS) covered under the provisions of section 383-a  of  the
 Retirement and Social Security Law.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 would be additional benefits for certain  members  who  remain  employed
 beyond  age  62  which  would  be funded by the normal employer contrib-
 utions. If members delay retirement due to the enactment of  this  bill,
 we  do not anticipate any increases in the annual contribution rates for
 any of the participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
