  law relating thereto

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The opening paragraph of subdivision 1 and subdivision 2 of
 section 334 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering  and  breeding  law,  as
 amended by a chapter of the laws of 2023 amending the racing, pari-mutu-
 el  wagering  and breeding law relating to allowing New York sire stakes
 eligibility for foals sired by New York state stallions, as proposed  in
 legislative  bills  numbers  S. 2779 and A. 3528, are amended to read as
 follows:
  The fund is further authorized and directed to conduct each  year,  at

 and fillies and horses complying with the following standards  shall  be
 eligible for such nomination:
  2.  The fund is further authorized and directed in each year, in coop-
 eration with each licensee harness track in this state, to  provide  for
 the  running  of stake events conditioned to admit only two year old and
 three year old colts and fillies sired by a stallion owned or leased and
 permanently standing for service at and within this state at the time of
 the said foal's conception, at each gait of trotting and pacing,  to  be
 known  as "New York sire stakes" and to contribute to the purses, stakes
 or prizes to be awarded in such "New York sire stakes", such sums as the

 STATE AND WITH A MARE BRED OUTSIDE THIS STATE, AND (C) FOALS SIRED BY  A

 YEAR OF CONCEPTION. THE FUND SHALL PROVIDE BONUS PAYMENTS TO THOSE FOALS
 BRED  WITHIN  THE  STATE THAT MEET OTHER CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE FUND.
 The fund may prescribe a starting fee for such  "New  York-bred  harness
 horse stakes" but in no event shall such fee be less than two per centum
 of the estimated purse for each entry. The fee prescribed shall be added
 to the purses awarded.

 ing and breeding law, as added by a chapter of the laws of 2023 amending
 the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law relating  to  allowing
 New York sire stakes eligibility for foals sired by New York state stal-
 lions,  as proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 2779 and A. 3528, is
 REPEALED.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the  same  date  and  in  the  same
 manner as a chapter of the laws of 2023 amending the racing, pari-mutuel
 wagering  and  breeding  law  relating  to allowing New York sire stakes
 eligibility for foals sired by New York state stallions, as proposed  in
 legislative bills numbers S. 2779 and A. 3528, takes effect.
