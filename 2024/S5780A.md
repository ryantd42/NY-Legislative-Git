  § 253-Z. RECORDING TAX IMPOSED BY THE COUNTY OF CHENANGO. 1.  CHENANGO
 COUNTY,  ACTING THROUGH ITS LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY, IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED
 AND EMPOWERED TO ADOPT AND AMEND LOCAL LAWS IMPOSING IN  SUCH  COUNTY  A
 TAX OF TWENTY-FIVE CENTS FOR EACH ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND EACH REMAINING
 MAJOR FRACTION THEREOF OF PRINCIPAL DEBT OR OBLIGATION WHICH IS OR UNDER
 ANY  CONTINGENCY  MAY BE SECURED AT THE DATE OF EXECUTION THEREOF, OR AT
 ANY TIME THEREAFTER, BY A MORTGAGE ON REAL PROPERTY SITUATED WITHIN SUCH
 COUNTY AND RECORDED ON OR AFTER THE  DATE  UPON  WHICH  SUCH  TAX  TAKES
 EFFECT  AND A TAX OF TWENTY-FIVE CENTS ON SUCH MORTGAGE IF THE PRINCIPAL
 DEBT OR OBLIGATION WHICH IS OR BY ANY CONTINGENCY MAY BE SECURED BY SUCH
 MORTGAGE IS LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS.
  2. THE TAXES IMPOSED UNDER THE AUTHORITY  OF  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  BE
 ADMINISTERED AND COLLECTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE TAXES IMPOSED UNDER

 NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, THE TAX SO
 IMPOSED AND PAID UPON MORTGAGES COVERING REAL PROPERTY SITUATED  IN  TWO
