  MEMORIALIZING Governor Kathy Hocul to proclaim May
  21, 2024, as Telepractice Awareness Day in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hocul to proclaim May 21, 2024, as Telepractice Awareness
Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Telepractice  is  the  application  of  telecommunications
technology  to  deliver  professional  services at a distance by linking
clinician  to  client,  or  clinician  to  clinician  for  assessment,
intervention, and/or consultation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Less  than  27%  of speech and language services are being
delivered due to COVID-19, leaving many patients without  the  direction
they  need to achieve their therapy goals, potentially setting them back
months in development; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many households in the State New York do not have  adequate
internet services to support telepractice; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Telepractice may be used to overcome barriers of access to
services  caused  by  distance,  unavailability  of  specialists  or
subspecialists, and impaired mobility; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the position of the American Speech-Language-Hearing
Association (ASHA) that telepractice is an appropriate model of  service
delivery for the professions of speech-language pathology and audiology;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Lehman College Chapter of the National Student Speech
Language and Hearing Association (NSSLHA) in the  County  of  the  Bronx
supports  and  advocates  for  Medicare  coverage  for  audiology  and
speech-language pathology services delivered via telehealth to  be  made
permanent; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Lehman  College Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences
Department and the Speech and Hearing Center of Lehman College  supports
the  needs  of  our  community in its offering of telehealth services to
improve communication disorders including speech, language, feeding, and
swallowing disorders; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body urges all New Yorkers to join in  the
effort  to  improve  telehealth  access  to  enhance  hearing,  speech,
language,  feeding,  swallowing,  and  cognition-related  health  care
services for those in medically underserved areas; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hocul  to  proclaim  May  21,  2024,  as
Telepractice Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hocul, Governor of the State of  New
 
York;  The  Lehman  College  Speech,  Language  and  Hearing  Sciences
Department; and The Speech and Hearing Center of Lehman College.
