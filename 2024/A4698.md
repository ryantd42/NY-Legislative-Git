 AN  ACT to establish a rental assistance loan-to-grant program to assist
  landlords of small rental properties who have lost rental  income  due
  to  the  inability  of  the  landlords' tenants to pay rent during the
  COVID-19 state disaster emergency; and providing  for  the  repeal  of
  such provisions upon the expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. 1. (a) There shall be established in the New York  Division
 of  Housing  and  Community  Renewal  a  rental assistance loan-to-grant
 program ("the program") to assist landlords of small  rental  properties
 who  have  lost  rental  income  due  to the inability of the landlord's
 tenants to pay rent during the period of  the  COVID-19  state  disaster
 emergency  declared pursuant to executive order 202 of 2020. The program
 shall be administered by the Commissioner of the New  York  Division  of
 Housing and Community Renewal.
  (b)  The program shall provide loans to landlords of residential prop-
 erties containing up to six rental units for  the  purpose  of  covering
 rent  arrearages  owed by tenants of the building who were unable to pay
 rent during the COVID-19 state disaster emergency due to unemployment or
 medical emergency  and  accrued  during  the  state  disaster  emergency
 declared  pursuant  to  executive  order 202 of 2020. If a tenant subse-
 quently pays the landlord the arrearages in rent, in whole or  in  part,
 the  landlord  shall  pay  such  funds to the program as full or partial
 repayment of the loan. If a tenant does not pay the landlord the arrear-
 ages in rent, that portion  of  the  loan  from  the  program  shall  be
 converted  by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal into a grant
 to the landlord and the landlord shall be held harmless from  any  obli-
 gation to repay such portion of the loan, absent any fraud.

 Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-136) for the Emergency Rent Relief  Act  of  2020,
 pursuant  to chapter one hundred twenty-five of the laws of two thousand
 twenty, such that the sum of such funds actually  expended  pursuant  to
 such  chapter  and  that such funds reallocated and expended pursuant to
 this article shall equal one hundred million dollars; and
  (c) any additional funds allocated by the federal  government  to  the
 state  of New York for emergency rental or utility assistance related to
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
  3. The Commissioner of the New York  State  Division  of  Housing  and

 ment or understanding.

 have become a law and shall expire and be  deemed  repealed  January  1,
