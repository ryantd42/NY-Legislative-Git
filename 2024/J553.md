  COMMENDING  Life  of  Hope  upon  the  occasion of
  hosting  its  Haitian  Culture  Day  Parade  and
  Celebration
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize the
profound impact of those exemplary organizations within the great  State
of  New  York  which  proactively  work  for the empowerment of cultural
communities, and the importance of such work which benefits all citizens
of this State, and  indeed,  all  citizens  of  the  Nation,  should  be
rightfully commended; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Life  of  Hope upon the occasion of hosting its Haitian Culture
Day Parade and Celebration on Saturday, May 13, 2023, in  Brooklyn,  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Life  of  Hope  was founded in 2006, and is a multifaceted
organization that positively impacts the lives of  youth  and  immigrant
families in a manner that reflects both their identity and needs through
innovative  programs and services while fostering greater opportunities;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This illustrious organization serves over 45,000 youth  and
immigrant  families,  preparing  them  for  success  in  obtaining  and
maintaining meaningful careers; and
 
  WHEREAS, The mission of Life of Hope is to be  the  central  hub  of
hope, access, critical resources, and prosperity for youth and immigrant
families  in Central Brooklyn; the organization is working to expand and
develop the Life of Hope Community Center to better transform the  lives
of  residents  who  continue  to  suffer  from  historical  and  ongoing
inequities; and
 
  WHEREAS, As a champion for the legacy and contributions  of  Haitian
Americans  in  the  Diaspora,  Life of Hope creates a safe space for the
marginalized  immigrant  community  whose  status  is  exceptionally
vulnerable,  specifically  including  Haitian  Americans,  to  celebrate
heritage and culture while connecting individuals with one  another  and
the community at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Haitian Culture Day Parade and Celebration is a day off
celebration  with  the  goal  of  honoring  and  uplifting  the  Haitian
community and the contributions they have made to New York  and  beyond;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our society is greatly benefited by the purposeful efforts
of individuals who unite for the cause of improving the quality of  life
for others, and who proactively work toward the goal of dignity for all;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Life of Hope upon the occasion of hosting  its  Haitian  Culture
Day Parade and Celebration; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Life of Hope organization.
