  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Subdivision 5 of section 89 of the public officers law, as
 added by chapter 890 of the laws of 1981, paragraph (a)  as  amended  by
 chapter  403 of the laws of 2003 and paragraph (d) as amended by chapter
 707 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  5. (a) (1) A person acting pursuant to law or regulation  who,  subse-
 quent to the effective date of this subdivision, submits any information
 to  any  state  agency  may, at the time of submission, request that the
 agency except such information from disclosure under  paragraph  (d)  of
 subdivision  two  of  section  eighty-seven  of  this article. Where the
 request itself contains information which if disclosed would defeat  the
 purpose  for  which the exception is sought, such information shall also
 be excepted from disclosure.
  (1-a) A person or entity who submits or otherwise makes available  any
 records  to  any  agency,  may,  at  any time, identify those records or
 portions thereof that may contain critical  infrastructure  information,
 and  request  that  the  agency  that maintains such records except such
 information from disclosure under subdivision two of section eighty-sev-
 en of this article. Where the request itself contains information  which
 if disclosed would defeat the purpose for which the exception is sought,
 such information shall also be excepted from disclosure.
  (2)  (I)  The  request  for  an  exception  shall be in writing, SHALL
 SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY WHICH PORTIONS OF THE RECORD ARE  THE  SUBJECT  OF
 THE  REQUEST  FOR  EXCEPTION  and  state the reasons why the information
 should be excepted, FOR A DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME, from disclosure.  THE
 SUBMITTER  MAY ALSO PROVIDE A DATE BY WHICH SUCH EXCEPTION SHALL EXPIRE,
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  (II)  NOT  LESS  THAN  SIXTY  DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN

 SHALL REVIEW THE APPLICATION AND EITHER  GRANT  OR  DENY  THE  EXTENSION
 REQUEST. A DENIAL OF AN EXTENSION REQUEST MAY BE APPEALED BY THE SUBMIT-

 further time as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.

  (2) permit the person who requested the exception, within ten business
 days  of  receipt  of  notification from the agency, to submit a written
 statement of the necessity for the  granting  or  continuation  of  such
 exception;
  (3)  within  seven business days of receipt of such written statement,
 or within seven business days of the expiration of the period prescribed
 for submission of such statement, issue a written  determination  grant-
 ing,  continuing  or  terminating such exception and stating the reasons
 therefor; copies of such determination shall be served upon the  person,
 if  any,  requesting the record, the person who requested the exception,
 and the committee on [public access to records] OPEN GOVERNMENT.
  (c) A denial of an exception from disclosure under  paragraph  (b)  of
 this  subdivision  may be appealed by the person submitting the informa-
 tion and a denial of access to the record may be appealed by the  person
 requesting the record in accordance with this subdivision:
  (1)  Within  seven  business days of receipt of written notice denying
 the request, the person may file a written appeal from the determination
 of the agency with the head of the agency, the chief  executive  officer
 or governing body or their designated representatives.
  (2)  The  appeal  shall  be determined within ten business days of the
 receipt of the appeal. Written notice  of  the  determination  shall  be
 served  upon  the  person, if any, requesting the record, the person who
 requested the exception and the committee on [public access to  records]

  (ii) Appeal to the appellate division of the  supreme  court  must  be
 made  in  accordance  with subdivision (a) of section fifty-five hundred
 thirteen of the civil practice law and rules.
