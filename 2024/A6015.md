  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend subdivision c of Section 532-a of the  Education
 Law  to  apply the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) percentage to a base
 benefit amount not to exceed $21,000 of annual retirement  benefit.  The
 current  cap  on  the  annual  base  benefit amount for COLA purposes is
 $18,000. This benefit improvement would be effective in September 2024.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers'  Retirement  System  for this benefit is estimated to be $78.6
 million or .43% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
