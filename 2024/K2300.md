  LEGISLTIVE  RESOLUTION  memorializing Governor Kathy
  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2024,  as  Ehler  Danlos
  Syndrome Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health  conditions  that affect the lives of citizens of New York State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as Ehler  Danlos
Syndrome  Awareness  Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of National Ehler Danlos Syndrome Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Caused by genetic changes that  affect  connective  tissue,
the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of 13 heritable connective
tissue disorders; symptoms of this life-altering condition include joint
hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  most common form of EDS is hypermobile EDS, and other
types include classical EDS, vascular EDS, and kyphoscoliotic  EDS;  for
some,  the  symptoms  can  be  relatively  mild,  while  for  others the
condition can be disabling; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People  with  hypermobile  EDS  (hEDS)  experience  joint
hypermobility,  loose  and  unstable joints that dislocate easily, joint
pain and clicking joints, extreme tiredness, skin that  bruises  easily,
digestive problems, dizziness and an increased heart rate after standing
up,  problems  with  internal organs, and problems with bladder control;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Classical EDS (cEDS) affects the skin and people with  cEDS
may  have joint hypermobility, loose and unstable joints, stretchy skin,
fragile skin that can split easily, smooth and velvety skin that bruises
easily, wounds that are slow to heal and leave wide scars,  and  hernias
and organ prolapse; and
 
  WHEREAS, Vascular EDS (vEDS) is a rare type of EDS and is considered
to be the most serious, affecting the blood vessels and internal organs;
people  with  vEDS  may  have  skin  that bruises easily, thin skin with
visible small blood vessels, fragile blood vessels  that  can  bulge  or
tear, internal bleeding, risk of organ problems, and hypermobile fingers
and toes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kyphoscoliotic  EDS  (kEDS)  is  a rare type of EDS, where
people may have curvature of the spine, joint hypermobility,  loose  and
unstable  joints,  weak  muscle  tone,  fragile  eyes that can be easily
damaged, and soft and velvety skin that is stretchy and bruises  easily;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  There is no specific treatment for EDS, but it is possible
to manage symptoms with the help of support and advice  from  healthcare
professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious disease, and more must be  done  to  increase  activity  at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as Ehler  Danlos
Syndrome Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
