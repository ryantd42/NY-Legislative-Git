  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 3-11, 2024, as Adirondack Water Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Healthy  rivers  and  lakes  have  been  essential for the
spiritual, cultural and physical  wellbeing  of  Indigenous  people  for
centuries;  in  1892 the Adirondack Park was created to protect New York
State's water resources; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today  clean  Adirondack  water  is  critical  for  health,
safety,  recreational  enjoyment,  spiritual relationships, tourism, and
economic vitality for all; it also provides important habitat for plants
and animals and supports ecosystem functions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Adirondack Water Week is held the first week of August; and
 
  WHEREAS, Adirondack Water Week is an annual week-long celebration of
the region's freshwater resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  events,  programs,  field  trips  and  hands-on
projects,  Adirondack  Water  Week  is  an opportunity for the public to
reflect on the importance of our lakes,  rivers  and  wetlands,  gaining
greater  awareness  about  watershed  issues, as well as getting out and
enjoying the region's waterways; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Started  by  Paul  Smith's  College  Adirondack  Watershed
Institute  in  2020,  Adirondack  Water  Week  is a collaborative effort
involving  local  businesses,  community  members,  visitors,  nonprofit
organizations,  municipalities,  lake  associations,  state  and  county
agencies,  and  colleges  and  universities;  the  event  strengthens
partnerships through collaborative events and actions that highlight our
region's waters; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  August  3-11,  2024,  as
Adirondack Water Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
