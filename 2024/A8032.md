 OF DETERMINING THE ALCOHOLIC AND/OR DRUG CONTENT OF THE  BLOOD  PROVIDED
 THAT  SUCH TEST IS ADMINISTERED BY OR AT THE DIRECTION OF A POLICE OFFI-

  (1) HAVING REASONABLE GROUNDS  TO  BELIEVE  SUCH  PERSON  POSSESSED  A
 FIREARM,  RIFE  OR SHOTGUN IN VIOLATION OF SUBDIVISION TWELVE OF SECTION
 A. 8032  9
 
 265.01 OF THIS ARTICLE AND WITHIN TWO HOURS AFTER SUCH PERSON  HAS  BEEN

  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PARAGRAPH, "REASONABLE  GROUNDS"  TO  BELIEVE
 THAT  A  PERSON  POSSESSED  A  FIREARM, RIFLE OR SHOTGUN IN VIOLATION OF
 SUBDIVISION TWELVE OF SECTION 265.01 OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE DETERMINED
 BY VIEWING THE TOTALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE INCIDENT WHICH,
 WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, INDICATE THAT THE POSSESSION VIOLATED SUCH SUBDIVI-
 SION.  SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MAY INCLUDE ANY VISIBLE  OR  BEHAVIORAL  INDI-
 CATION  OF  ALCOHOL OR DRUG CONSUMPTION BY SUCH PERSON, THE EXISTENCE OF
 AN OPEN CONTAINER CONTAINING OR HAVING CONTAINED AN  ALCOHOLIC  BEVERAGE
 IN  OR  AROUND  THE  VICINITY  OF  SUCH  PERSON,  OR  ANY OTHER EVIDENCE
 SURROUNDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INCIDENT WHICH INDICATES  THAT  THE

 CONSUMED ALCOHOL OR DRUGS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.
  (B) REPORT OF REFUSAL. (1) IF: (A)  SUCH  PERSON  HAVING  BEEN  PLACED
 UNDER ARREST; OR (B) AFTER A BREATH TEST INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF ALCO-
 HOL  IN  THE  PERSON'S  SYSTEM;  AND  THE  PERSON HAVING THEREAFTER BEEN
 REQUESTED TO SUBMIT TO SUCH CHEMICAL TEST AND HAVING BEEN INFORMED  THAT
 ANY  LICENSE  HELD BY SUCH PERSON TO POSSESS A FIREARM, RIFLE OR SHOTGUN
 SHALL BE SUBJECT TO SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION FOR REFUSAL  TO  SUBMIT  TO
 SUCH  TEST  WHETHER  OR NOT THE PERSON IS FOUND GUILTY OF THE CHARGE FOR
 WHICH SUCH PERSON IS ARRESTED OR DETAINED, THEN IF SUCH  PERSON  REFUSES
 TO  SUBMIT  TO SUCH CHEMICAL TEST OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, UNLESS A COURT
 ORDER HAS BEEN GRANTED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE  OF  THIS  SECTION,
 THE  TEST  SHALL NOT BE GIVEN AND A WRITTEN REPORT OF SUCH REFUSAL SHALL
 BE IMMEDIATELY MADE BY THE POLICE OFFICER BEFORE WHOM SUCH  REFUSAL  WAS
 MADE.  SUCH  REPORT MAY BE VERIFIED BY HAVING THE REPORT SWORN TO, OR BY
 AFFIXING TO SUCH REPORT A FORM NOTICE THAT FALSE STATEMENTS MADE THEREIN
 ARE PUNISHABLE AS A CLASS A MISDEMEANOR PURSUANT TO  SECTION  210.45  OF
 THIS  CHAPTER AND SUCH FORM NOTICE TOGETHER WITH THE SUBSCRIPTION OF THE
 DEPONENT SHALL CONSTITUTE A VERIFICATION OF THE REPORT.
  (2) THE REPORT OF  THE  POLICE  OFFICER  SHALL  SET  FORTH  REASONABLE
 GROUNDS  TO  BELIEVE SUCH ARRESTED PERSON HAD POSSESSED A FIREARM, RIFLE
 OR SHOTGUN IN VIOLATION OF SUBDIVISION TWELVE OF SECTION 265.01 OF  THIS
 ARTICLE,  THAT  SAID PERSON HAD REFUSED TO SUBMIT TO SUCH CHEMICAL TEST,
 AND THAT NO CHEMICAL TEST WAS ADMINISTERED PURSUANT TO THE  REQUIREMENTS
 OF  SUBDIVISION  THREE OF THIS SECTION. THE REPORT SHALL BE PRESENTED TO
 THE COURT UPON ARRAIGNMENT OF AN ARRESTED PERSON, AND SHALL BE TRANSMIT-
 TED BY SUCH COURT TO THE APPROPRIATE LICENSING AUTHORITY  WITHIN  FORTY-

 ITY PENDING THE DETERMINATION OF A HEARING, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES
 AND PROCEDURES OF SUCH AUTHORITY, FOR REFUSAL TO SUBMIT  TO  A  TEST  IN
 EITHER THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION OR
 THE  CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN SUBPARAGRAPH ONE OF THIS PARAGRAPH.  ANY
 SUCH REFUSAL MAY, AFTER  SUCH  HEARING  OR  IF  UNCONTESTED,  CONSTITUTE
 GROUNDS  FOR  CONTINUED  SUSPENSION  OR  REVOCATION  OF  SUCH LICENSE IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH RULES AND PROCEDURES.
  (4) NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE DEEMED TO RESTRICT THE DISCRETION
 OF ANY LICENSING AUTHORITY OR THE DISCRETION OF ANY JUDGE OR JUSTICE  OF
 A  COURT  OF  RECORD  UNDER SUBDIVISION ELEVEN OF SECTION 400.00 OF THIS
 A. 8032  10
 
 CHAPTER TO SUSPEND OR REVOKE A LICENSE BECAUSE OF AN  ALLEGED  VIOLATION

 ANY  PORTION  THEREOF  SHALL  BE  ADMISSIBLE IN ANY TRIAL, PROCEEDING OR
 HEARING BASED UPON AN ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION
 TWELVE OF SECTION 265.01 OF THIS ARTICLE BUT ONLY UPON  A  SHOWING  THAT
 THE  PERSON  WAS  GIVEN  SUFFICIENT  WARNING,  IN  CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL
 LANGUAGE, OF THE EFFECT OF SUCH REFUSAL AND THAT THE PERSON PERSISTED IN
 THE REFUSAL. SUCH SHOWING SHALL BE SATISFIED BY SUBMISSION OF A VERIFIED
 REPORT OF REFUSAL AS PROVIDED IN SUBPARAGRAPH ONE OF  PARAGRAPH  (B)  OF
 THIS  SUBDIVISION  CONTAINING  A STATEMENT THAT SUCH PERSON WAS INFORMED
 THAT HIS OR HER LICENSE SHALL BE SUBJECT  TO  SUSPENSION  OR  REVOCATION
 WHETHER  OR  NOT THE PERSON IS FOUND GUILTY OF THE CHARGE FOR WHICH SUCH
 PERSON IS ARRESTED OR DETAINED IF SUCH PERSON REFUSES TO SUBMIT TO  SUCH

 PERSON SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION TWELVE OF SECTION 265.01
 OF THIS ARTICLE WHO POSSESSES A FIREARM, RIFLE OR SHOTGUN (OTHER THAN IN

 SALIVA, FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE ALCOHOLIC AND/OR DRUG CONTENT
 OF  THE  BLOOD WHEN A COURT ORDER FOR SUCH CHEMICAL TEST HAS BEEN ISSUED
 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (B) WHEN AUTHORIZED. UPON REFUSAL BY ANY PERSON TO SUBMIT TO A  CHEMI-
 CAL  TEST  OR  ANY PORTION THEREOF AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS
 SUBDIVISION, THE TEST SHALL NOT BE GIVEN UNLESS A POLICE  OFFICER  OR  A
 DISTRICT  ATTORNEY, AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION THIRTY-TWO OF SECTION 1.20
 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, REQUESTS AND OBTAINS  A  COURT  ORDER  TO
 COMPEL  A PERSON TO SUBMIT TO A CHEMICAL TEST TO DETERMINE THE ALCOHOLIC
 OR DRUG CONTENT OF THE PERSON'S BLOOD UPON A FINDING OF REASONABLE CAUSE
 TO BELIEVE THAT:
  (1) SUCH PERSON POSSESSED A  FIREARM,  RIFLE  OR  SHOTGUN  WITH  WHICH
 ANOTHER PERSON WAS KILLED OR SUFFERED PHYSICAL INJURY; AND
  (2)  (A) EITHER SUCH PERSON POSSESSED THE FIREARM, RIFLE OR SHOTGUN IN
 VIOLATION OF SUBDIVISION TWELVE OF SECTION 265.01 OF THIS ARTICLE, OR

  (4)  SUCH  PERSON  HAS  REFUSED  TO  SUBMIT  TO A CHEMICAL TEST OR ANY
 PORTION THEREOF, REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE  PROVISIONS  OF  PARA-
 GRAPH  (A)  OF  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  THIS  SECTION OR IS UNABLE TO GIVE
 CONSENT TO SUCH A TEST.
  (C) REASONABLE CAUSE; DEFINITION. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS  SUBDIVISION
 "REASONABLE  CAUSE"  SHALL  BE  DETERMINED  BY  VIEWING  THE TOTALITY OF
 CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE INCIDENT WHICH, WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, INDI-
 CATE THAT THE PERSON POSSESSED A FIREARM, RIFLE OR SHOTGUN IN  VIOLATION
 A. 8032  11
 
 OF  SUBDIVISION  TWELVE  OF SECTION 265.01 OF THIS ARTICLE. SUCH CIRCUM-
 STANCES MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: EVIDENCE THAT  SUCH  PERSON

 law,  as  amended by chapter 371 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read
 as follows:
  (a) The conviction of a licensee  anywhere  of  a  felony  or  serious
 offense  or  a  licensee  at  any  time  becoming ineligible to obtain a
 license, including engaging in conduct that would have resulted  in  the
 denial  of  a license, under this section shall operate as or be grounds
 for, a revocation of the license.  A license may be revoked or suspended
 as provided for in SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION 265.70  OF  THIS  CHAPTER,
 section  530.14  of  the criminal procedure law or section eight hundred
 forty-two-a of the family court act. Except for a license issued  pursu-
 ant  to  section  400.01  of  this article, a license may be revoked and
 cancelled at any time in the city of New York, and in  the  counties  of
 Nassau  and Suffolk, by the licensing officer, and elsewhere than in the
 city of New York by any judge or justice of a court of record; a license
 issued pursuant to section 400.01 of this article  may  be  revoked  and
 cancelled  at  any time by the licensing officer or any judge or justice
 of a court of record. A license to engage in the business of dealer  may
 be  revoked  or suspended for any violation of the provisions of article
 thirty-nine-BB of the general business  law.  The  official  revoking  a
 license  shall  give written notice thereof without unnecessary delay to
 the executive department, division of state police,  Albany,  and  shall
 also  notify  immediately the duly constituted police authorities of the
 locality. The licensing officer shall revoke any license issued in which
 an applicant knowingly made a material false statement on  the  applica-
 tion.  Notice  of a revocation under this subdivision shall be issued in
 writing and shall include the basis for the determination,  which  shall
 be  supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Such notice shall also
 include information regarding the ability to  appeal  such  decision  in
 accordance with subdivision four-a of this section.
  § 9. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall  have  become  a  law.  Provided, however, that any actions,
 including but not limited to the promulgation of rules and  regulations,
 necessary  to implement the provisions of this act on its effective date
 are authorized and directed to be made and completed on or  before  such
 date.
