 able  person  or  property,  or  any  charge of criminal possession of a
 firearm as defined in section 265.01-b of  the  penal  law,  where  such
 charge  arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released on
 [his or her] SUCH DEFENDANT'S own recognizance,  released  under  condi-

 ance ticket for a separate felony or class A misdemeanor involving  harm
 to  an  identifiable  person  or  property,  or  any  charge of criminal
 possession of a firearm as defined in section 265.01-b of the penal law,

 nizance or under appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]
