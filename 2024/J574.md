  WHEREAS,  Born  in  the capital city of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, Mario

throughout his entire life; and
 
  WHEREAS, In June of 1999, Mario Nelson began his illustrious  career
of  service  after  graduating from Westinghouse High and enlisting with
the National Guard; and
 
  WHEREAS, Answering the call to help those in need after the  tragedy
of September 11, 2001, Mario Nelson participated in the recovery efforts
at  Ground Zero in New York City, New York; his experience from 9/11 led
him  to  making  the  difficult  decision  to  go  on  active  duty  to
patriotically fight for the United States in a time of uncertainty; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sergeant  Mario  Nelson was assigned to the 1st Battalion,

compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the most heroic magnitude; his sacrifices and selfless dedications merit
tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Survived  by  his  wife,  Mecca,  and  his  daughter,  Mia,
Sergeant Mario Nelson exists in the loving memory of those close to him;
Mecca and Mia, were with him throughout and both feel privileged to have
been a part of his life and to have rejoiced in his accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS, The freedoms and security we cherish as Americans come at a
very  high price for those serving in the military in times of conflict;
 
it is fitting and proper that we who are the beneficiaries of those  who
risk  their  lives,  leaving  their  families  behind,  express  our
appreciation and eternal gratitude for their sacrifices  and  courageous
acts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Sergeant Mario  Nelson  posthumously  upon  the  occasion  of  the
renaming of a street in Brooklyn, New York, in recognition of his heroic
and remarkable life; and be it further
