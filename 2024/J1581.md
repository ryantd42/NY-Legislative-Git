  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 1,  2024,  as  International  Day  of  Older
  Persons in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 1, 2024, as International Day
of Older Persons in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The International Day of Older Persons is celebrated  every
year  on  October 1st; on December 14, 1990, the General Assembly of the
United Nations voted to declare October 1st as the International Day  of
Older  Persons  as  stated  in  Resolution 45/106; the holiday was first
celebrated on October 1, 1991; and
 
  WHEREAS, The world's population is aging fast; the United Nations is
estimating that one in five people will  be  over  60  by  2050;  it  is
estimated  that  the number of aged over 80 will triple from 143 million
in 2019 to 426 million in 2050; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State is now home  to  more  people  aged  65  and
older,  3.2  million, than the entire population of 21 states; about one
in six New Yorkers now stands at 65 and beyond (16 percent),  a  greater
share of the State's population than ever; and
 
  WHEREAS,  76  in 1,000 older New Yorkers are victims of elder abuse,
and in recent years, the number of reported  cases  of  elder  abuse  is
growing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  July  of 2018, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced $8.4
million in state and federal funding to expand services  for  vulnerable
adults  through  the  Elder  Abuse  Interventions  and  Enhanced
Multidisciplinary Teams Initiative; this helped to expand resources  for
older New Yorkers and ultimately put an end to elder abuse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  October  1,  2019, The World Health Organization (WHO)
launched a package of tools to observe  the  day,  including  a  digital
application  (App) to help health and social workers provide better care
for elderly people; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year on International Day of Older Persons, the  State
of  New York aims at enshrining and upholding the rights of older people
and supporting and mobilizing activists to  protect  those  rights;  the
event  features  a  panel  addressing  sub-themes  including care sector
inequalities,  work/life  balance  in  lifelong  learning,  and  social
protection; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Elderly have raised, coached, taught, and shared with
younger generations; many were hard  working  folks  who  comprised  the
 
backbone  of  America's  "Greatest"  generation;  they  were the history
makers and today, they are our neighbors who often need help in order to
remain independent and to continue to live in the homes they love;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  1,  2024,  as
International  Day  of Older Persons in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
