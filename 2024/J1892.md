prowess,  speed and agility, Head Coach Clay Russell worked hard to hone
the skills of this champion, teaching this outstanding  athlete  lessons
since  he  was in 5th grade, which will prove invaluable both on and off
the mat; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tavian  Camper  has  clearly  utilized  dedication,
determination  and  teamwork  in providing a lasting contribution to the
spirit of excellence which is a tradition of his school; now, therefore,
