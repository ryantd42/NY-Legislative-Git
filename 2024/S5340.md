 added  by section 2 of subpart B of part UU of chapter 56 of the laws of
 2022, are amended and a new paragraph (v) is added to read as follows:
  (t)  any  felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifi-
 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a
 firearm  as  defined  in  section  265.01-b of the penal law, where such
 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned  after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a separate
 felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an  identifiable  person
 or  property,  or  any  charge  of  criminal  possession of a firearm as
 defined in section 265.01-b of the penal law,  provided,  however,  that
 the  prosecutor must show reasonable cause to believe that the defendant
 committed the instant crime and any underlying crime. For  the  purposes
 of  this subparagraph, any of the underlying crimes need not be a quali-
 fying offense as defined in this subdivision. For the purposes  of  this
 paragraph,  "harm  to  an identifiable person or property" shall include
 but not be limited to theft of or damage  to  property.  However,  based
 upon  a review of the facts alleged in the accusatory instrument, if the
 court determines that such theft is negligible and does not appear to be
 in furtherance of  other  criminal  activity,  the  principal  shall  be
 released  on  his or her own recognizance or under appropriate non-mone-
 tary conditions; [or]
  (u) criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined  in
 subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale of

 agraph (xxii) is added to read as follows:

 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a
 firearm  as  defined  in  section  265.01-b  of the penal law where such
 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned  after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a separate
 felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an  identifiable  person
 or property, provided, however, that the prosecutor must show reasonable
 cause  to believe that the defendant committed the instant crime and any
 underlying crime. For the purposes of  this  subparagraph,  any  of  the
 underlying  crimes  need  not be a qualifying offense as defined in this
 subdivision. For the purposes of this paragraph, "harm to  an  identifi-
 able person or property" shall include but not be limited to theft of or
 damage to property. However, based upon a review of the facts alleged in
 the  accusatory  instrument,  if the court determines that such theft is
 negligible and does not appear to be in furtherance  of  other  criminal
 activity, the principal shall be released on his or her own recognizance
 or under appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]
  (xxi)  criminal  possession of a weapon in the third degree as defined
 in subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale
