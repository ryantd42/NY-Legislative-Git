 AN ACT in relation to authorizing  Lawrence  Ecker  to  receive  certain
  service credit with the New York state and local employees' retirement
  system
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Notwithstanding any provision of  law  to  the  contrary,
 Lawrence Ecker, who retired from the New York state and local employees'
 retirement  system  on  January  1,  2021 and whom, post retirement, was
 again employed as a state supreme court judge from approximately June of
 2021 through June of 2022, shall have his  pension  with  the  New  York
 state  and  local  employees'  retirement system recalculated to include
 additional full-time service credit for the period beginning January  1,
 2021  and  ending  December 31, 2022 if, on or before one year after the
 effective date of this act, he shall file  a  written  request  to  that
 effect with the New York state and local employees' retirement system.
  § 2. All costs associated with implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the Office of Court Administration.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  grant 2 years of service credit under Article 15 of
 the Retirement and Social Security Law  to  Lawrence  Ecker,  a  current
 retiree  of  the  New  York State and Local Employees' Retirement System
 (NYSLERS), for the period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending  December
 31, 2022.  Lawrence Ecker retired effective January 1, 2021 and rejoined
 the  NYSLERS  for  one  year before resuming their retirement. This bill
 would therefore grant service credit for a period during which  Lawrence
 Ecker  was  retired  and  collecting a pension benefit. Per the New York
 State and Local Retirement System's policies, Lawrence Ecker is ineligi-

 ble to receive service credit while they  were  collecting  the  pension
 benefit and while the retirement and pension benefit were paused.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of approximately  $226,000  which
 will  be borne by the New York State Office of Court Administration as a
 one-time payment. This estimate assumes that payment  will  be  made  on
 March 1, 2024.
