 SPECIAL  PROCEEDING  TO  ISSUE  AN  INJUNCTION,  AND  UPON NOTICE TO THE
 DEFENDANT OF NOT LESS THAN FIVE DAYS, TO ENJOIN AND RESTRAIN THE CONTIN-
 UANCE OF SUCH VIOLATION; AND IF IT SHALL APPEAR TO THE  SATISFACTION  OF
 THE  COURT  OR  JUSTICE  THAT  THE DEFENDANT HAS, IN FACT, VIOLATED THIS
 SECTION, AN INJUNCTION MAY BE ISSUED BY THE COURT OR JUSTICE,  ENJOINING
 AND RESTRAINING ANY FURTHER VIOLATIONS, WITHOUT REQUIRING PROOF THAT ANY
