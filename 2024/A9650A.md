 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  education law, in relation to contracts for the
  transportation of school children
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Paragraph a of subdivision 14 of section 305 of the educa-
 tion law, as amended by chapter 273 of the laws of 1999, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  a.  (1)  All  contracts for the transportation of school children, all
 contracts to maintain school buses owned or leased by a school  district
 that  are  used for the transportation of school children, all contracts
 for mobile instructional units, and all contracts to  provide,  maintain
 and  operate  cafeteria  or restaurant service by a private food service
 management company shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner,
 who may disapprove a proposed contract if, in [his] SUCH  COMMISSIONER'S
 opinion,  the  best  interests of the district will be promoted thereby.
 Except as  provided  in  paragraph  e  of  this  subdivision,  all  such
 contracts involving an annual expenditure in excess of the amount speci-
 fied  for  purchase contracts in the bidding requirements of the general
 municipal law shall be awarded to the lowest responsible  bidder,  which
 responsibility  shall  be  determined  by  the board of education or the
 trustee of a district, with power hereby vested in the  commissioner  to
 reject  any  or  all  bids if, in [his] SUCH COMMISSIONER'S opinion, the
 best interests of the district will be promoted thereby and,  upon  such
 rejection  of all bids, the commissioner shall order the board of educa-
 tion or trustee of  the  district  to  seek,  obtain  and  consider  new
 proposals.  All  proposals  for such transportation, maintenance, mobile
 instructional units, or cafeteria and restaurant  service  shall  be  in
 such  form  as  the commissioner may prescribe.  Advertisement for bids
 shall be published in a newspaper or newspapers designated by the  board
 of education or trustee of the district having general circulation with-
 in  the  district  for  such purpose. Such advertisement shall contain a

 statement of the time when and place where all bids received pursuant to
 such advertisement will be publicly opened and read either by the school
 authorities or by a person or  persons  designated  by  them.  All  bids
 received  shall  be  publicly  opened  and read at the time and place so
 specified. At least five days shall elapse between the first publication
 of such advertisement and the date so  specified  for  the  opening  and
 reading of bids. The requirement for competitive bidding shall not apply
 to an award of a contract for the transportation of pupils or a contract
 for  mobile instructional units, if such award is based on an evaluation
 of proposals in response to a request for proposals  pursuant  to  para-
 graph  e  of  this  subdivision. The requirement for competitive bidding
 shall not apply to  annual,  biennial,  or  triennial  extensions  of  a
 contract  nor  shall  the  requirement  for competitive bidding apply to
 quadrennial or quinquennial year  extensions  of  a  contract  involving
 transportation of pupils, maintenance of school buses or mobile instruc-
 tional units secured either through competitive bidding or through eval-
 uation  of  proposals in response to a request for proposals pursuant to
 paragraph e of this subdivision, when such extensions [(1)] (I) are made
 by the board of education or the trustee of a district, under rules  and
 regulations  prescribed  by  the  commissioner,  and,  [(2)] (II) do not
 extend the original contract period beyond  five  years  from  the  date
 cafeteria and restaurant service commenced thereunder and in the case of
 contracts  for  the  transportation  of  pupils,  for the maintenance of
 school buses or for mobile instructional units, that such contracts  may
 be  extended, except that power is hereby vested in the commissioner, in
 addition to [his] SUCH COMMISSIONER'S existing  statutory  authority  to
 approve or disapprove transportation or maintenance contracts, [(i)] (A)
 to reject any extension of a contract beyond the initial term thereof if
 [he]  SUCH  COMMISSIONER finds that amount to be paid by the district to
 the contractor in any year of such proposed extension fails  to  reflect
 any  decrease  in  the  regional  consumer  price  index  for  the N.Y.,
 N.Y.-Northeastern, N.J. area, based upon the index for all urban consum-
 ers (CPI-U) during the preceding twelve month period; and [(ii)] (B)  to
 reject  any extension of a contract after ten years from the date trans-
 portation  or  maintenance  service  commenced  thereunder,  or  mobile
 instructional units were first provided, if in [his] SUCH COMMISSIONER'S
 opinion,  the  best  interests of the district will be promoted thereby.
 Upon such rejection of any  proposed  extension,  the  commissioner  may
 order  the board of education or trustee of the district to seek, obtain
 and consider bids pursuant to the provisions of this section. The  board
 of  education  or  the trustee of a school district electing to extend a
 contract as provided herein, may, in its discretion, increase the amount
 to be paid in each year of the contract extension by an  amount  not  to
 exceed  the  regional  consumer  price  index  increase  for  the  N.Y.,
 N.Y.-Northeastern, N.J. area, based upon the index for all urban consum-
 ers (CPI-U), during the preceding twelve month period, provided  it  has
 been satisfactorily established by the contractor that there has been at
 least  an  equivalent  increase in the amount of [his] SUCH CONTRACTOR'S
 cost of operation, during the period of the contract.
