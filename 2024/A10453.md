  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing an amendment to section 5 of article 3, section 1  of  article
  5,  sections  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
  24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35 and 36-a of article  6,  section  1  of
  article 7, sections 5, 7 and 7-a of article 8, section 1 of article 9,
  section  13  of  article  13, section 5 of article 14 and section 4 of
  article 18 of the constitution, in relation to  renaming  the  supreme
  court the superior court and the court of appeals the supreme court
 
  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the closing paragraph
 of  section  5  of  article  3 of the constitution be amended to read as
 follows:
  An apportionment by the legislature, or other body, shall  be  subject
 to  review  by the [supreme] SUPERIOR court, at the suit of any citizen,
 under such reasonable regulations as the legislature may prescribe;  and
 any  court  before  which a cause may be pending involving an apportion-
 ment,  shall  give  precedence  thereto  over  all  other  causes  and
 proceedings,  and  if  said  court  be  not  in session it shall convene
 promptly for the disposition of the same.  The court shall  render  its
 decision  within  sixty  days after a petition is filed. In any judicial
 proceeding relating to redistricting of congressional or state  legisla-
 tive  districts, any law establishing congressional or state legislative
 districts found to violate the  provisions  of  this  article  shall  be
 invalid  in  whole  or  in  part. In the event that a court finds such a
 violation, the legislature shall have a full and reasonable  opportunity
 to correct the law's legal infirmities.
  §  2.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 1 of article 5 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  Section 1. The comptroller and attorney-general shall be chosen at the
 same general election as the governor and hold office for the same term,
 and shall possess the qualifications provided in section  2  of  article
 IV. The legislature shall provide for filling vacancies in the office of
 comptroller  and of attorney-general. No election of a comptroller or an
 attorney-general shall be had except at the time of electing a governor.

 The comptroller shall be required: (1)  to  audit  all  vouchers  before
 payment  and  all  official  accounts;  (2)  to  audit  the  accrual and
 collection of all revenues and receipts; and (3) to prescribe such meth-
 ods  of accounting as are necessary for the performance of the foregoing
 duties. The payment of any money of the state, or of any money under its
 control, or the refund of any money paid to the state, except upon audit
 by the comptroller, shall be void, and may be restrained upon  the  suit
 of  any  taxpayer  with  the  consent of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court in
 appellate division on notice to the attorney-general.  In  such  respect
 the  legislature  shall define the powers and duties and may also assign
 to him or her: (1) supervision of the accounts of any political subdivi-
 sion of the state; and (2) powers and duties pertaining to or  connected
 with the assessment and taxation of real estate, including determination
 of ratios which the assessed valuation of taxable real property bears to
 the  full  valuation  thereof, but not including any of those powers and
 duties reserved to officers of a county, city, town or village by virtue
 of sections seven and eight of article nine of  this  constitution.  The
 legislature shall assign to him or her no administrative duties, except-
 ing such as may be incidental to the performance of these functions, any
 other provision of this constitution to the contrary notwithstanding.
  §  3.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 1 of article 6 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  Section 1. a. There shall be a unified court system for the state. The
 state-wide courts shall consist of the SUPREME court [of  appeals],  the
 [supreme]  SUPERIOR court including the appellate divisions thereof, the
 court of claims, the county court, the surrogate's court and the  family
 court,  as  hereinafter provided. The legislature shall establish in and
 for the city of New York, as part of the unified court  system  for  the
 state,  a  single,  city-wide  court of civil jurisdiction and a single,
 city-wide court of criminal jurisdiction, as hereinafter  provided,  and
 may  upon the request of the mayor and the local legislative body of the
 city of New York, merge the two courts into one city-wide court of  both
 civil  and criminal jurisdiction. The unified court system for the state
 shall also include the district, town, city and village  courts  outside
 the city of New York, as hereinafter provided.
  b.  The  SUPREME  court  [of  appeals],  the  [supreme] SUPERIOR court
 including the appellate divisions thereof,  the  court  of  claims,  the
 county  court,  the  surrogate's  court, the family court, the courts or
 court of civil and criminal jurisdiction of the city of  New  York,  and
 such  other  courts  as the legislature may determine shall be courts of
 record.
  c. All processes, warrants and other mandates of the SUPREME court [of
 appeals], the [supreme] SUPERIOR court including the appellate divisions
 thereof, the court of claims, the county court,  the  surrogate's  court
 and  the  family  court  may  be  served and executed in any part of the
 state. All processes, warrants and other mandates of the courts or court
 of civil and criminal jurisdiction of the city of New York may,  subject
 to  such  limitation  as may be prescribed by the legislature, be served
 and executed in any part of the state. The legislature may provide  that
 processes,  warrants  and  other  mandates  of the district court may be
 served and executed in  any  part  of  the  state  and  that  processes,
 warrants and other mandates of town, village and city courts outside the
 city of New York may be served and executed in any part of the county in
 which such courts are located or in any part of any adjoining county.
  §  4.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 2 of article 6 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
 A. 10453  3
 
  § 2. a. The SUPREME court [of appeals] is continued. It shall  consist
 of  the  chief judge and the six elected associate judges now in office,
 who shall hold their offices until the expiration  of  their  respective
 terms, and their successors, and such justices of the [supreme] SUPERIOR
 court  as  may  be  designated  for service in said court as hereinafter
 provided. The official terms of the chief judge and  the  six  associate
 judges shall be fourteen years.
  Five  members  of the court shall constitute a quorum, and the concur-
 rence of four shall be necessary to a decision; but no more  than  seven
 judges  shall  sit  in  any  case.  In  case of the temporary absence or
 inability to act of any judge of the SUPREME  court  [of  appeals],  the
 court may designate any justice of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court to serve
 as associate judge of the court during such absence or inability to act.
 The  court  shall  have  power  to  appoint and to remove its clerk. The
 powers and jurisdiction of the court shall not be suspended for want  of
 appointment  when  the  number  of  judges is sufficient to constitute a
 quorum.
  b. Whenever and as often as  the  SUPREME  court  [of  appeals]  shall
 certify to the governor that the court is unable, by reason of the accu-
 mulation of causes pending therein, to hear and dispose of the same with
 reasonable  speed,  the governor shall designate such number of justices
 of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court as may be so certified to be  necessary,
 but  not  more  than  four,  to serve as associate judges of the SUPREME
 court [of appeals]. The justices so designated shall be relieved,  while
 so  serving,  from  their  duties  as justices of the [supreme] SUPERIOR
 court, and shall serve as associate judges  of  the  SUPREME  court  [of
 appeals] until the court shall certify that the need for the services of
 any  such  justices no longer exists, whereupon they shall return to the
 [supreme] SUPERIOR court. The governor may  fill  vacancies  among  such
 designated  judges.  No  such justices shall serve as associate judge of
 the SUPREME court [of  appeals]  except  while  holding  the  office  of
 justice of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court. The designation of a justice of
 the  [supreme] SUPERIOR court as an associate judge of the SUPREME court
 [of appeals] shall not be deemed to affect his or  her  existing  office
 any  longer  than until the expiration of his or her designation as such
 associate judge, nor to create a vacancy.
  c. There shall be a commission on judicial nomination to evaluate  the
 qualifications  of  candidates  for appointment to the SUPREME court [of
 appeals] and to prepare a written report and recommend to  the  governor
 those persons who by their character, temperament, professional aptitude
 and  experience  are  well  qualified  to hold such judicial office. The
 legislature shall provide by law for the organization and  procedure  of
 the judicial nominating commission.
  d.  (1)  The commission on judicial nomination shall consist of twelve
 members of whom four shall be appointed by the  governor,  four  by  the
 chief  judge  of  the  SUPREME  court  [of appeals], and one each by the
 speaker of the assembly, the temporary  president  of  the  senate,  the
 minority  leader of the senate, and the minority leader of the assembly.
 Of the four members appointed by the governor, no more than two shall be
 enrolled in the same political party, two shall be members of the bar of
 the state, and two shall not be members of the bar of the state. Of  the
 four  members  appointed  by  the  chief  judge of the SUPREME court [of
 appeals], no more than two shall  be  enrolled  in  the  same  political
 party,  two  shall be members of the bar of the state, and two shall not
 be members of the bar of the state. No member of  the  commission  shall
 hold  or have held any judicial office or hold any elected public office
 A. 10453  4
 
 for which he or she receives compensation during his or  her  period  of
 service,  except  that the governor and the chief judge may each appoint
 no more than one former judge or justice of the unified court system  to
 such  commission.  No  member of the commission shall hold any office in
 any political party.  No member of the  judicial  nominating  commission
 shall be eligible for appointment to judicial office in any court of the
 state during the member's period of service or within one year thereaft-
 er.
  (2) The members first appointed by the governor shall have respective-
 ly  one, two, three and four year terms as the governor shall designate.
 The members first appointed by the chief judge of the SUPREME court  [of
 appeals]  shall have respectively one, two, three and four year terms as
 the chief judge shall designate.  The  member  first  appointed  by  the
 temporary president of the senate shall have a one-year term. The member
 first  appointed  by the minority leader of the senate shall have a two-
 year term. The member first appointed by the  speaker  of  the  assembly
 shall  have a four-year term. The member first appointed by the minority
 leader of the assembly shall have a  three-year  term.  Each  subsequent
 appointment shall be for a term of four years.
  (3)  The  commission  shall  designate one of their number to serve as
 chairperson.
  (4) The commission shall consider the qualifications of candidates for
 appointment to the offices of judge and chief judge of the SUPREME court
 [of appeals] and, whenever a vacancy  in  those  offices  occurs,  shall
 prepare  a  written report and recommend to the governor persons who are
 well qualified for those judicial offices.
  e. The governor shall appoint, with the  advice  and  consent  of  the
 senate,  from among those recommended by the judicial nominating commis-
 sion, a person to fill the office of chief judge or associate judge,  as
 the  case  may  be,  whenever  a vacancy occurs in the SUPREME court [of
 appeals]; provided, however, that no person may be appointed a judge  of
 the  SUPREME  court [of appeals] unless such person is a resident of the
 state and has been admitted to the practice of law in this state for  at
 least  ten  years. The governor shall transmit to the senate the written
 report of the commission on judicial nomination relating to the nominee.
  f. When a vacancy occurs in the office of  chief  judge  or  associate
 judge of the SUPREME court [of appeals] and the senate is not in session
 to  give  its  advice and consent to an appointment to fill the vacancy,
 the governor shall fill the vacancy  by  interim  appointment  upon  the
 recommendation  of  a  commission  on judicial nomination as provided in
 this section. An interim appointment shall  continue  until  the  senate
 shall  pass  upon  the  governor's  selection. If the senate confirms an
 appointment, the judge shall serve a term as provided in  subdivision  a
 of  this section commencing from the date of his or her interim appoint-
 ment. If the senate rejects an appointment,  a  vacancy  in  the  office
 shall  occur  sixty days after such rejection. If an interim appointment
 to the SUPREME court [of appeals] be made from among the justices of the
 [supreme] SUPERIOR  court  or  the  appellate  divisions  thereof,  that
 appointment shall not affect the justice's existing office, nor create a
 vacancy in the [supreme] SUPERIOR court, or the appellate division ther-
 eof, unless such appointment is confirmed by the senate and the appoint-
 ee shall assume such office. If an interim appointment of chief judge of
 the  SUPREME court [of appeals] be made from among the associate judges,
 an interim appointment of associate judge shall be made in like  manner;
 in such case, the appointment as chief judge shall not affect the exist-
 A. 10453  5
 
 ing office of associate judge, unless such appointment as chief judge is
 confirmed by the senate and the appointee shall assume such office.
  g.  The provisions of subdivisions c, d, e and f of this section shall
 not  apply  to  temporary  designations  or  assignments  of  judges  or
 justices.
  §  5.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 3 of article 6 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 3. a. The jurisdiction of the SUPREME court [of  appeals]  shall  be
 limited  to  the review of questions of law except where the judgment is
 of death, or where the appellate division, on reversing or  modifying  a
 final or interlocutory judgment in an action or a final or interlocutory
 order in a special proceeding, finds new facts and a final judgment or a
 final  order  pursuant thereto is entered; but the right to appeal shall
 not depend upon the amount involved.
  b. Appeals to the SUPREME court [of  appeals]  may  be  taken  in  the
 classes of cases hereafter enumerated in this section;
  In  criminal  cases,  directly  from  a court of original jurisdiction
 where the judgment is of death, and in  other  criminal  cases  from  an
 appellate division or otherwise as the legislature may from time to time
 provide.
  In civil cases and proceedings as follows:
  (1) As of right, from a judgment or order entered upon the decision of
 an  appellate  division  of  the  [supreme] SUPERIOR court which finally
 determines an action or special proceeding wherein is directly  involved
 the  construction  of  the  constitution  of  the state or of the United
 States, or where one or more of the justices of the  appellate  division
 dissents  from the decision of the court, or where the judgment or order
 is one of reversal or modification.
  (2) As of right, from a judgment or order of  a  court  of  record  of
 original  jurisdiction  which  finally  determines  an action or special
 proceeding where the only question involved on the appeal is the validi-
 ty of a statutory provision of the state or of the United  States  under
 the  constitution  of the state or of the United States; and on any such
 appeal only the constitutional question shall be considered  and  deter-
 mined by the court.
  (3)  As  of  right, from an order of the appellate division granting a
 new trial in an action or a new hearing in a  special  proceeding  where
 the  appellant  stipulates  that,  upon affirmance, judgment absolute or
 final order shall be rendered against him or her.
  (4) From a determination of the appellate division  of  the  [supreme]
 SUPERIOR  court  in any department, other than a judgment or order which
 finally determines an action or special proceeding, where the  appellate
 division allows the same and certifies that one or more questions of law
 have  arisen  which, in its opinion, ought to be reviewed by the SUPREME
 court [of appeals], but in such case  the  appeal  shall  bring  up  for
 review  only  the  question  or  questions so certified; and the SUPREME
 court [of appeals] shall certify to the appellate division its  determi-
 nation upon such question or questions.
  (5)  From an order of the appellate division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR
 court in any department, in a proceeding instituted by or against one or
 more public officers or a board, commission  or  other  body  of  public
 officers  or  a  court  or  tribunal,  other than an order which finally
 determines such proceeding, where the SUPREME court [of  appeals]  shall
 allow  the  same upon the ground that, in its opinion, a question of law
 is involved which ought to be reviewed by it, and without regard to  the
 availability of appeal by stipulation for final order absolute.
 A. 10453  6
 
  (6) From a judgment or order entered upon the decision of an appellate
 division  of  the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR court which finally determines an
 action or special proceeding but which is not appealable under paragraph
 (1) of this subdivision where the  appellate  division  or  the  SUPREME
 court  [of  appeals] shall certify that in its opinion a question of law
 is involved which  ought  to  be  reviewed  by  the  SUPREME  court  [of
 appeals].  Such  an  appeal  may  be allowed upon application (a) to the
 appellate division, and in case of refusal, to  the  SUPREME  court  [of
 appeals],  or  (b)  directly  to the SUPREME court [of appeals]. Such an
 appeal shall be allowed when required in  the  interest  of  substantial
 justice.
  (7)  No appeal shall be taken to the SUPREME court [of appeals] from a
 judgment or order entered upon the decision of an appellate division  of
 the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR court in any civil case or proceeding where the
 appeal to the appellate division was from a judgment or order entered in
 an appeal from another court, including an appellate or special term  of
 the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR court, unless the construction of the constitu-
 tion of the state or of the United States is directly involved  therein,
 or  unless  the appellate division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court shall
 certify that in its opinion a question of law is involved which ought to
 be reviewed by the SUPREME court [of appeals].
  (8) The legislature may abolish an appeal to  the  SUPREME  court  [of
 appeals]  as  of  right  in  any or all of the cases or classes of cases
 specified in paragraph (1)  of  this  subdivision  wherein  no  question
 involving  the  construction  of the constitution of the state or of the
 United States is directly involved, provided, however, that  appeals  in
 any such case or class of cases shall thereupon be governed by paragraph
 (6) of this subdivision.
  (9)  The  SUPREME court [of appeals] shall adopt and from time to time
 may amend a rule to permit the court to answer questions of New York law
 certified to it by the Supreme Court of the United States,  a  court  of
 appeals  of  the  United  States or an appellate court of last resort of
 another state, which may be determinative of the cause then  pending  in
 the  certifying  court  and which in the opinion of the certifying court
 are not controlled by precedent in the decisions of the  courts  of  New
 York.
  § 6. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That subdivisions b, c, h, j and
 k  of  section  4 of article 6 of the constitution be amended to read as
 follows:
  b. The appellate divisions of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court are contin-
 ued, and shall consist of seven justices of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court
 in each of the first and second departments, and five justices  in  each
 of  the  other  departments.  In each appellate division, four justices
 shall constitute a quorum, and the concurrence of three shall be  neces-
 sary to a decision. No more than five justices shall sit in any case.
  c.  The  governor shall designate the presiding justice of each appel-
 late division, who shall act as such during his or her  term  of  office
 and  shall  be  a  resident of the department. The other justices of the
 appellate divisions shall be designated by the governor,  from  all  the
 justices  elected  to  the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR court, for terms of five
 years or the unexpired portions of their respective terms of office,  if
 less than five years.
  h. A justice of the appellate division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court
 in any department may be temporarily designated by the presiding justice
 of  his  or her department to the appellate division in another judicial
 A. 10453  7
 
 department upon agreement by the presiding  justices  of  the  appellate
 division of the departments concerned.
  j.  No  justice of the appellate division shall, within the department
 to which he or she may be designated to perform the duties of an  appel-
 late  justice,  exercise any of the powers of a justice of the [supreme]
 SUPERIOR court, other than those of a justice out of  court,  and  those
 pertaining to the appellate division, except that the justice may decide
 causes  or proceedings theretofore submitted, or hear and decide motions
 submitted by consent of counsel, but any such justice, when not actually
 engaged in performing the  duties  of  such  appellate  justice  in  the
 department  to  which  he or she is designated, may hold any term of the
 [supreme] SUPERIOR court and exercise any of the powers of a justice  of
 the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR  court  in  any  judicial district in any other
 department of the state.
  k. The appellate divisions of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court shall  have
 all  the  jurisdiction  possessed  by them on the effective date of this
 article and such additional jurisdiction as may be  prescribed  by  law,
 provided,  however,  that the right to appeal to the appellate divisions
 from a judgment or order which does not finally determine an  action  or
 special proceeding may be limited or conditioned by law.
  §  7. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That subdivisions c, d and e of
 section 6 of article 6  of  the  constitution  be  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  c. The justices of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court shall be chosen by the
 electors  of the judicial district in which they are to serve. The terms
 of justices of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court shall be fourteen years from
 and including the first day of January next after their election.
  d. The [supreme] SUPERIOR court is continued. It shall consist of  the
 number  of  justices  of  the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR  court  including the
 justices designated to the appellate divisions of the [supreme] SUPERIOR
 court, judges of the county court  of  the  counties  of  Bronx,  Kings,
 Queens  and  Richmond and judges of the court of general sessions of the
 county of New York authorized by law on the thirty-first day  of  August
 next  after  the  approval  and  ratification  of  this amendment by the
 people, all of whom shall be justices of the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR  court
 for  the  remainder  of  their  terms.  The legislature may increase the
 number of justices of the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR  court  in  any  judicial
 district,  except that the number in any district shall not be increased
 to exceed one justice for fifty thousand, or fraction over thirty  thou-
 sand,  of  the population thereof as shown by the last federal census or
 state enumeration. The legislature may decrease the number  of  justices
 of  the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR court in any judicial district, except that
 the number in any district shall not be less than the number of justices
 of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court authorized by law on the effective  date
 of this article.
  e. The clerks of the several counties shall be clerks of the [supreme]
 SUPERIOR  court,  with  such powers and duties as shall be prescribed by
 law.
  § 8. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 7 of article  6  of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  7.  a.  The  [supreme]  SUPERIOR  court shall have general original
 jurisdiction in law and equity and  the  appellate  jurisdiction  herein
 provided.  In the city of New York, it shall have exclusive jurisdiction
 over crimes prosecuted by indictment, provided, however, that the legis-
 lature may grant to the city-wide court of criminal jurisdiction of  the
 city of New York jurisdiction over misdemeanors prosecuted by indictment
 A. 10453  8
 
 and to the family court in the city of New York jurisdiction over crimes
 and  offenses  by or against minors or between spouses or between parent
 and child or between members of the same family or household.
  b.  If  the  legislature  shall  create  new  classes  of  actions and
 proceedings, the [supreme] SUPERIOR court shall have  jurisdiction  over
 such classes of actions and proceedings, but the legislature may provide
 that another court or other courts shall also have jurisdiction and that
 actions  and proceedings of such classes may be originated in such other
 court or courts.
  § 9. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 8 of article  6  of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 8. a. The appellate division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court in each
 judicial  department  may  establish  an  appellate term in and for such
 department or in and for a judicial district or districts or in and  for
 a  county  or  counties  within  such department. Such an appellate term
 shall be composed of not less than three nor more than five justices  of
 the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR court who shall be designated from time to time
 by the chief administrator of  the  courts  with  the  approval  of  the
 presiding  justice  of the appropriate appellate division, and who shall
 be residents of the department or of the judicial district or  districts
 as  the  case  may  be  and  the chief administrator of the courts shall
 designate the place or places where such appellate terms shall be held.
  b. Any such appellate term may be discontinued and  re-established  as
 the  appellate  division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court in each depart-
 ment shall determine from time to time and any  designation  to  service
 therein may be revoked by the chief administrator of the courts with the
 approval of the presiding justice of the appropriate appellate division.
  c. In each appellate term no more than three justices assigned thereto
 shall  sit  in  any  action  or  proceeding.  Two of such justices shall
 constitute a quorum and the concurrence of two shall be necessary  to  a
 decision.
  d.  If so directed by the appellate division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR
 court establishing an appellate  term,  an  appellate  term  shall  have
 jurisdiction  to  hear and determine appeals now or hereafter authorized
 by law to be taken to the [supreme] SUPERIOR court or to  the  appellate
 division  other than appeals from the [supreme] SUPERIOR court, a surro-
 gate's court, the family court or appeals in criminal  cases  prosecuted
 by  indictment  or  by information as provided in section six of article
 one.
  e. As may be provided by law, an appellate term shall  have  jurisdic-
 tion  to  hear  and determine appeals from the district court or a town,
 village or city court outside the city of New York.
  § 10. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 11 of article 6 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 11. a. The county court shall have jurisdiction over  the  following
 classes  of  actions  and  proceedings which shall be originated in such
 county court in the manner provided by  law,  except  that  actions  and
 proceedings  within  the  jurisdiction  of the district court or a town,
 village or city court outside the city of New York may, as  provided  by
 law,  be originated therein: actions and proceedings for the recovery of
 money, actions and proceedings for the recovery of chattels and  actions
 and  proceedings  for  the  foreclosure  of mechanics liens and liens on
 personal property where the amount sought to be recovered or  the  value
 of  the  property does not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars exclusive
 of interest and costs; over all crimes and other violations of law; over
 summary proceedings to recover possession of real property and to remove
 A. 10453  9
 
 tenants therefrom; and over such  other  actions  and  proceedings,  not
 within  the  exclusive  jurisdiction of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court, as
 may be provided by law.
  b.  The county court shall exercise such equity jurisdiction as may be
 provided by law and its jurisdiction to enter judgment upon  a  counter-
 claim for the recovery of money only shall be unlimited.
  c.  The county court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all
 appeals arising in the county in the following actions and  proceedings:
 as  of  right, from a judgment or order of the district court or a town,
 village or city court which finally determines an action  or  proceeding
 and,  as  may  be  provided by law, from a judgment or order of any such
 court which does not finally determine  an  action  or  proceeding.  The
 legislature  may  provide,  in accordance with the provisions of section
 eight of this article, that any or all of such appeals be  taken  to  an
 appellate  term  of  the  [supreme] SUPERIOR court instead of the county
 court.
  d. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit or impair  the
 jurisdiction  of  the  [supreme]  SUPERIOR court as set forth in section
 seven of this article.
  § 11. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That subdivisions d  and  f  of
 section  12  of  article  6  of  the  constitution be amended to read as

 city court outside the city of New  York  may  transfer  any  action  or
 proceeding,  other than one which has previously been transferred to it,
 to any court, other than the county court or the  surrogate's  court  or
 the family court or the [supreme] SUPERIOR court, having jurisdiction of
 the subject matter in the same or an adjoining county provided that such
 other  court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  classes  of persons named as
 parties.

 ing transferred to it pursuant to this section.

 are transferred if that limitation be lower than that of  the  court  in
 which the actions and proceedings were originated.

 justice in the armed forces;
  (2)  be  eligible  to  be a candidate for any public office other than

 provided, however, that the legislature shall require a course of train-
 ing and education to be completed by justices of town and village courts
 selected after the effective date of this  article  who  have  not  been
 admitted to practice law in this state. Judges of such courts shall also
 be subject to such rules of conduct not inconsistent with laws as may be
 promulgated  by  the chief administrator of the courts with the approval
 of the SUPREME court [of appeals].
  § 16. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That subdivision a  of  section

  § 17. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 22 of article 6 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  22. a. There shall be a commission on judicial conduct. The commis-
 sion on judicial conduct shall receive, initiate, investigate  and  hear
 complaints  with  respect  to  the  conduct,  qualifications, fitness to
 perform or performance of official duties of any judge or justice of the
 unified court system, in the manner provided by law; and, in  accordance
 A. 10453  13
 
 with  subdivision  d  of  this  section,  may  determine that a judge or
 justice be admonished,  censured  or  removed  from  office  for  cause,
 including,  but not limited to, misconduct in office, persistent failure
 to  perform his or her duties, habitual intemperance, and conduct, on or
 off the bench, prejudicial to the administration of justice, or  that  a
 judge or justice be retired for mental or physical disability preventing
 the  proper  performance  of  his or her judicial duties. The commission
 shall transmit [an] ANY such determination to the  chief  judge  of  the
 SUPREME court [of appeals] who shall cause written notice of such deter-
 mination  to  be  given  to the judge or justice involved. Such judge or
 justice may either accept the commission's determination or make written
 request to the chief judge, within thirty days  after  receipt  of  such
 notice,  for  a  review  of  such determination by the SUPREME court [of
 appeals].
  b. (1) The commission on judicial  conduct  shall  consist  of  eleven
 members,  of  whom  four  shall be appointed by the governor, one by the
 temporary president of the senate, one by the  minority  leader  of  the
 senate,  one  by the speaker of the assembly, one by the minority leader
 of the assembly and three by the chief judge of the  SUPREME  court  [of
 appeals]. Of the members appointed by the governor one person shall be a
 member of the bar of the state but not a judge or justice, two shall not
 be  members of the bar, justices or judges or retired justices or judges
 of the unified court system, and one shall be a judge or justice of  the
 unified  court  system.  Of the members appointed by the chief judge one
 person shall be a justice of the appellate  division  of  the  [supreme]
 SUPERIOR  court and two shall be judges or justices of a court or courts
 other than the SUPREME court [of appeals] or appellate  divisions.  None
 of  the  persons  to  be  appointed  by the legislative leaders shall be
 justices or judges or retired justices or judges.
  (2) The persons first appointed by the governor shall have respective-

 sion shall be appointed thereafter for a term of four years.  Commission
 membership  of a judge or justice appointed by the governor or the chief
 judge shall terminate if such member ceases to hold the  judicial  posi-
 tion  which  qualified him or her for such appointment. Membership shall
 also terminate if a member attains a position which would have  rendered
 him  or  her  ineligible  for  appointment at the time of appointment. A
 vacancy shall be filled by the appointing officer for the  remainder  of
 the term.
  c.  The  organization  and  procedure  of  the  commission on judicial
 conduct shall be as provided by law. The commission on judicial  conduct
 may  establish  its  own rules and procedures not inconsistent with law.
 Unless the legislature shall provide otherwise, the commission shall  be
 empowered  to  designate  one  of  its  members or any other person as a
 referee to hear and report concerning any matter before the commission.

 the SUPREME court [of appeals] may admonish, censure, remove or  retire,
 for the reasons set forth in subdivision a of this section, any judge of
 A. 10453  14
 
 the unified court system. In reviewing a determination of the commission
 on  judicial  conduct,  the  SUPREME court [of appeals] shall review the
 commission's findings of fact and conclusions of law on  the  record  of
 the proceedings upon which the commission's determination was based. The
 SUPREME  court  [of  appeals]  may impose a less or more severe sanction
 prescribed by this section than the one determined by the commission, or
 impose no sanction.
  e. The SUPREME court [of appeals] may suspend a judge or justice  from
 exercising  the  powers  of  his  or her office while there is pending a
 determination by the commission on  judicial  conduct  for  his  or  her
 removal  or retirement, or while the judge or justice is charged in this
 state with a felony by an indictment or an information filed pursuant to
 section  six  of  article  one.  The  suspension  shall  continue  upon
 conviction  and,  if  the conviction becomes final, the judge or justice
 shall be removed from office. The suspension shall  be  terminated  upon
 reversal  of  the conviction and dismissal of the accusatory instrument.
 Nothing in this subdivision shall prevent  the  commission  on  judicial
 conduct  from  determining  that  a  judge  or  justice  be  admonished,
 censured, removed, or retired pursuant to subdivision a of this section.
  f. Upon the recommendation of the commission on judicial conduct or on
 its own motion, the SUPREME court [of appeals] may suspend  a  judge  or
 justice from office when he or she is charged with a crime punishable as
 a felony under the laws of this state, or any other crime which involves
 moral  turpitude.  The suspension shall continue upon conviction and, if
 the conviction becomes final, the judge or justice shall be removed from
 office.  The  suspension  shall  be  terminated  upon  reversal  of  the
 conviction  and  dismissal of the accusatory instrument. Nothing in this
 subdivision shall prevent the commission on judicial conduct from deter-
 mining that a judge or justice  be  admonished,  censured,  removed,  or
 retired pursuant to subdivision a of this section.
  g.  A  judge  or  justice  who is suspended from office by the SUPREME
 court [of appeals] shall receive his or her judicial salary during  such
 period  of  suspension, unless the court directs otherwise. If the court
 has so directed and such suspension is thereafter terminated, the  court
 may direct that the judge or justice shall be paid his or her salary for
 such period of suspension.
  h.  A judge or justice retired by the SUPREME court [of appeals] shall
 be considered to have retired voluntarily. A judge or justice removed by
 the SUPREME court [of appeals] shall be ineligible to hold  other  judi-
 cial office.
  i.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this section, the legisla-
 ture may provide by law for review of determinations of  the  commission
 on  judicial conduct with respect to justices of town and village courts
 by an appellate division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court. In such event,
 all references in this section to the SUPREME court [of appeals] and the
 chief judge thereof shall be deemed references to an appellate  division
 and the presiding justice thereof, respectively.
  j.  If  a  court  on the judiciary shall have been convened before the
 effective date of this section and the proceeding shall not be concluded
 by that date, the court on the judiciary shall have continuing jurisdic-
 tion beyond the effective date of this section to conclude the  proceed-
 ing.  All  matters  pending  before  the  former  commission on judicial
 conduct on the effective date of this section shall be  disposed  of  in
 such manner as shall be provided by law.

 [of  appeals], or the major part of them. On the trial of an impeachment

 ernor nor the temporary president of the senate shall act as a member of
 the court. No judicial officer shall exercise his or  her  office  after
 articles  of impeachment against him or her shall have been preferred to
 the senate, until he or she shall have been acquitted.  Before the trial
 of an impeachment, the members of the court shall take an oath or affir-
 mation truly and impartially to try the  impeachment  according  to  the
 evidence,  and  no  person shall be convicted without the concurrence of
 two-thirds of the members present.  Judgment  in  cases  of  impeachment
 shall  not  extend  further than to removal from office, or removal from

 of  which  is affected, shall have consented thereto upon the basis of a
 determination that the annexation is in the  over-all  public  interest.
 The  consent  of  the governing board of a county shall be required only

 vacancies  shall require; the sheriff and the clerk of each county shall
 be chosen by the electors once in every  three  or  four  years  as  the
 legislature shall direct. Sheriffs shall hold no other office.  They may
 be  required  by  law to renew their security, from time to time; and in
 default of giving such new  security,  their  offices  shall  be  deemed
 vacant.  The  governor  may  remove  any elective sheriff, county clerk,

 division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court in the judicial  department  in
 which the county is located. In addition to his or her powers and duties
 as  clerk of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court, he or she shall have power to
 select, draw, summon and empanel grand and petit jurors  in  the  manner

  § 35. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the opening  paragraph  of
 section  4  of  article  18  of  the  constitution be amended to read as
 follows:
  To effectuate any of the purposes of this article, the legislature may
 authorize  any  city,  town  or  village  to contract indebtedness to an
 amount which shall not exceed two per centum  of  the  average  assessed
 valuation  of  the  real estate of such city, town or village subject to
 taxation, as determined by the last completed assessment  roll  and  the
 four preceding assessment rolls of such city, town or village, for city,
 town  or village taxes prior to the contracting of such indebtedness. In
 ascertaining the power of a city, or village having a population of five
 thousand or more as determined by the last federal census,  to  contract
 indebtedness  pursuant  to  this  article there may be excluded any such
 indebtedness if the project or projects aided by guarantees representing
 such indebtedness or by loans for which such indebtedness was contracted
 shall have yielded during the preceding year net revenue  to  be  deter-
 mined  annually by deducting from the gross revenues, including periodic
 subsidies therefor, received from such project or projects, all costs of
 operation, maintenance, repairs and replacements, and  the  interest  on
 such  indebtedness and the amounts required in such year for the payment
 of such indebtedness; provided that  in  the  case  of  guarantees  such
 interest and such amounts shall have been paid, and in the case of loans
 an  amount  equal to such interest and such amounts shall have been paid
 to such city or village. The legislature shall prescribe the  method  by
 which the amount of any such indebtedness to be excluded shall be deter-
 mined,  and  no such indebtedness shall be excluded except in accordance
 with such determination. The legislature may confer  appropriate  juris-
 diction on the appellate division of the [supreme] SUPERIOR court in the
 judicial  departments  in  which such cities or villages are located for
 the purpose of determining the amount of any such indebtedness to be  so
 excluded.
  §  36.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendments
 be referred to the first regular legislative session convening after the
 next succeeding general election of members of  the  Assembly,  and,  in
 conformity  with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution, be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
