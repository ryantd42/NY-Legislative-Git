 mental hygiene facility to a hospital or from a hospital to a  different
 hospital, any such order or plan shall remain effective until an attend-
 ing  practitioner  first  examines the transferred patient, whereupon an

 Such  orders may be issued without obtaining another consent to withhold
 or withdraw life-sustaining treatment pursuant to this article; or
  [2.] (B) Cancel such order, if the attending  practitioner  determines

 the order the attending practitioner shall make  reasonable  efforts  to
 notify  the  person who made the decision to withhold or withdraw treat-
 ment and the hospital staff directly responsible for the patient's  care
 of any such cancellation. If such notice cannot reasonably be made prior
 to  canceling  the  order or plan, the attending practitioner shall make
 such notice as soon as reasonably practicable after cancellation.

 REMAIN  EFFECTIVE  AND NO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BY A GENERAL HOSPITAL SHALL

 ation system]  AN  ETHICS  REVIEW  COMMITTEE,  established  pursuant  to
 S. 8009  3

 such as a patient's advocate's office,  hospital  chaplain's  office  or
 ethics  committee,  as described in writing and adopted by the governing
 authority of such hospice, for non-binding mediation. In the event  that
 such  dispute  cannot  be  resolved  within seventy-two hours or no such
