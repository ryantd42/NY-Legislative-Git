  ties and Commissions
 
 AN  ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to establishing
  a wireless electric vehicle charging program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The legislature recognizes electric
 vehicles are crucial to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, reducing reli-
 ance on fossil fuels,  strengthening  the  economy,  and  combating  the
 climate crisis. As of 2019, the transportation sector accounts for twen-
 ty-nine  percent  of  all greenhouse gas emissions, which is the most of
 any sector. Increasing the adoption of  electric  vehicles  will  reduce
 pollution  and  increase  air quality for communities located near roads
 with high traffic density  or  high-volume  routes.  As  the  automotive
 industry  shifts  towards  electric  vehicles, investing in new electric
 vehicle technologies will be crucial to enhancing  New  York's  competi-
 tiveness, creating jobs, and ensuring continued economic growth.
  Range  anxiety  is  one  of  the  chief  barriers  to electric vehicle
 adoption.  If deployed strategically, static and dynamic wireless  elec-
 tric vehicle charging options could help by providing drivers convenient
 opportunities to charge and extend the range of electric vehicles. Wire-
 less  charging  technologies  could  be  invaluable for electric transit
 buses, trucking,  fleet  vehicles,  and  autonomous  electric  vehicles,
 allowing  for  convenient  and  hands-free charging, while also lowering
 costs, as effective wireless charging would reduce the need  for  larger
 and  heavier  batteries.  Wireless  and dynamic charging can also reduce
 pressure on the grid, allowing vehicles  to  charge  through  space  and
 time,  shaving peak demand and reducing the need to build massive charg-
 ing capacity at any given location  to  meet  growing  electric  vehicle
 charging demand.
  Wireless  can  enhance electrification of fleets, including medium and
 heavy-duty vehicles, helping them meet operational needs that cannot  be
 met  solely  by  traditional charging systems. Wireless electric vehicle

 charging has the potential to make electric vehicles more accessible and
 allow all people, regardless of physical ability, to enjoy the  benefits
 of electric vehicles.
  §  2.  The  public  authorities law is amended by adding a new section
 1885 to read as follows:
  § 1885. WIRELESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING PROGRAM. 1.  THE  AUTHORITY
 SHALL ESTABLISH A PROGRAM, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANS-
 PORTATION,  TO  RESEARCH AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO ELIGIBLE ENTITIES FOR
 PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCT, INSTALL, OR IMPROVE EXISTING STATIC  AND  DYNAMIC
 WIRELESS  CHARGING  INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES,
 INCLUDING PERFORMANCE, SAFETY, ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY, INTEROPER-
 ABILITY, DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING OF STATIC AND DYNAMIC WIRELESS  CHARG-
 ING.
  2.  THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH SHALL
 INCLUDE CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY, INCENTIVES  AND  GOVERNING
 DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS PURSUANT TO THE PROGRAM. SUCH INCENTIVES SHALL NOT
 BE LIMITED TO FUNDS APPROPRIATED THEREFOR AND MAY CONSIST OF MONIES FROM
 ANY SOURCE, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, MADE AVAILABLE FOR SUCH INCENTIVES.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
 on or before such effective date.
