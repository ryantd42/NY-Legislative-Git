  COMMENDING  Firefighter  Charles  Gaffney upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  60 years of dedicated service to the Sauquoit
  Volunteer Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  commend
Firefighter  Charles  Gaffney  upon  the occasion of his designation for
special recognition after 60 years of dedicated service to the  Sauquoit
Volunteer Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Charles Gaffney is one such firefighter; throughout 60 years of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Firefighter Charles Gaffney upon the occasion of his designation
for special recognition after 60  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
Sauquoit Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter Charles Gaffney.
