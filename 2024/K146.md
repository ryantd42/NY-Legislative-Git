BY: M. of A. Hawley
 
  COMMEMORATING the 200th Anniversary of the Town of
  Newstead, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the Town of Newstead, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded  in 1823 and located in the northeastern corner of
Erie County in Western New  York,  the  Town  of  Newstead  is  a  rural
community with over 40% of the area devoted to agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Town  of  Newstead  is  split  in  two  by  a  unique
geographical feature, the Onondaga escarpment,  and  a  portion  of  the
Tonawanda  Indian Reservation is in the northeastern corner of the Town;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Town government headquarters is located in the  Village
of  Akron,  and  as of the 2010 Census, the population is estimated just
below 9,000; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout its history, elected officials held meetings  in
town halls in various locations; in the 1900s, they met at a location on
the  east side of Buffalo Street between Main and John Streets, and then
moved to the corner of Church and John Streets in the Village  where  it
stayed until 2005; in 2004, the Town purchased the old Strippit training
center  located  at  5  Clarence  Center  Road and converted it into the
current Town Hall, where it remains today; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the 1970s, the Town Seal was created by Lanis Ritecz
and assisted  by  Supervisor  Kelsey  Webster  and  Board  member  Terry
Newcomb,  and in 2015, it was replaced with a symbol of a white pine and
headdress with  a  single  feather  that  more  accurately  portrayed  a
headdress worn by the local Tribesmen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  a  period  of uncertainty, the Board took several
measures to help guide the future of the Town; it  developed  its  first
Town Master Plan, bought vacant land through grant money for future use,
started  to  expand  the  water  districts  and  purchased the rights to
various abandoned railroads; and
 
  WHEREAS, The railroad property has enhanced the  Town  by  improving
electric  service  to  the  Village, and the construction of a bike path
which extends all the way to the Town of Clarence in two locations; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Town  also  partnered  with  other  municipalities  and
businesses  to  make  its  community a better place for its residents to
live, work and play; three Town Sewer Districts, a refuse district,  and
both  a  Conservation  Advisory  Committee  and a Library Committee were
 
created; currently, the Town is predominately watered through  the  Erie
County Water Authority; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2011, the Town Highway Department and Village Department
of Public Works moved into a new Joint Municipal Facility together under
one  roof  at  12707 Clarence Center Road; today, the Highway Department
efficiently maintains its roads with help from both Erie County and  New
York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  fruitful  over  the  ebb and flow of decades of
growth and change, the Town of  Newstead  continues  its  commitment  to
enhancing  the  quality  of  life  of  its citizens, ensuring a positive
business, institutional  and  educational  climate,  and  providing  all
essential services; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the Town  of  Newstead,  New  York,
recognizing  the  significance  of  the role it continues to play in the
life of the community of the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to David L. Cummings, Supervisor, Town of Newstead.
