  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 2024, as Cervical Cancer Awareness Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  January  2024,  as  Cervical  Cancer
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Cervical Cancer Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer and fourth
most frequent cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nearly 13,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each
year in the United States, and more than 4,000 die as a result; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2022, there were about 812 new cases of cervical  cancer
in the State of New York, and 216 women died from the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hispanic  women  have the highest rate of cervical cancer,
and Black, non-Hispanic women are more likely to die of cervical  cancer
than any other group; and
 
  WHEREAS, The disease is almost totally treatable or preventable with
routine  screening,  which  the American Cancer Society recommends women
begin at the age of 25; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mortality from cervical cancer  is  associated  with  being
diagnosed  at  a  later  stage,  which  can stem from poor access to and
uptake of preventative services and a lack of follow-up  care  after  an
abnormal screening result; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Awareness  of  the  disease,  its  risk  factors,  and the
importance  of  access  to  preventative  measures  are  critical  to
perpetuating  the continual decrease of the incidence of cervical cancer
in women in the State of New York and across the Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cervical cancer has affected residents from each and  every
county  in  this great Empire State; Cervical Cancer Awareness Month not
only brings attention  to  this  preventable,  life-threatening  disease
affecting  so  many  of  our  friends, family, and neighbors in New York
State, but also honors those who have succumbed to it; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the  local, State and national levels to support the patients as well as
their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2024, as Cervical
Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
