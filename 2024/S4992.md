 detectors, and security cameras, and the approved expenditures shall not
 exceed  such cost allowance. The commissioner shall annually prescribe a
 special cost allowance for partition and room  divider  safety  devices,
 and the approved expenditures shall not exceed such cost allowance.

 other  security  devices shall be limited to electronic security systems
 and hardened doors, and provided  that  for  projects  approved  by  the
 commissioner on or after the first day of July two thousand thirteen and

 c of subdivision six of this section plus ten percentage points,  except
 that  in  no case shall this amount exceed one hundred percent, and (ii)
 the  actual  approved expenditures incurred in the base year pursuant to
 this subdivision, provided  that  the  limitations  on  cost  allowances
 prescribed  by  paragraph a of subdivision six of this section shall not
 apply, and provided further that any projects aided under this paragraph
 must be included in a district's school safety  plan.  The  commissioner
