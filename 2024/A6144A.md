 AN ACT to amend the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and  breeding  law,  in
  relation to the tax on gaming revenues in certain regions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 1351 of  the  racing,  pari-mutuel
 wagering  and breeding law, as amended by section 1 of part OOO of chap-
 ter 59 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  1. (a) For a gaming facility in zone two, there is  hereby  imposed  a
 tax on gross gaming revenues. The amount of such tax imposed shall be as
 follows;  provided,  however,  should  a licensee have agreed within its
 application to supplement  the  tax  with  a  binding  supplemental  fee
 payment exceeding the aforementioned tax rate, such tax and supplemental
 fee shall apply for a gaming facility:
  (1)  in  region  two,  forty-five percent of gross gaming revenue from
 slot machines and ten percent of gross gaming  revenue  from  all  other
 sources.
  (2)  in  region  one, thirty-nine percent of gross gaming revenue from
 slot machines and ten percent of gross gaming  revenue  from  all  other
 sources.
  (3)  in region five, thirty-seven percent of gross gaming revenue from
 slot machines and ten percent of gross gaming  revenue  from  all  other
 sources.  IT  SHALL BE REQUIRED THAT BOTH CASINOS LOCATED IN SUCH REGION
 SHALL BE TAXED ON GROSS GAMING REVENUE AT THE SAME PERCENTAGES  AS  EACH
 OTHER AT ALL TIMES.
  (b)  (1)  Notwithstanding  the rates in paragraph (a) of this subdivi-
 sion, a gaming facility may petition the commission  to  lower  the  tax
 rate applicable to its slot machines to no lower than thirty percent. In
 analyzing such request, the commission shall evaluate the petition using
 the following criteria:

 A. 6144  2
 
  (i)  the  ability  of the licensee to satisfy the license criterion of
 financial stability absent the tax rate reduction;
  (ii)  a  complete examination of all financial projections, as well as
 gaming revenues generated for the prior annual period;
  (iii) the licensee's intended use of the funds resulting  from  a  tax
 adjustment;
  (iv)  the  inability  of  the operator to remain competitive under the
 current tax structure;
  (v) positions advanced by other  gaming  operators  in  the  state  in
 response to the petition;
  (vi) the impact on the competitive landscape;
  (vii)  other  economic  factors  such  as employment and the potential
 impact upon other businesses in the region; and
  (viii) the public interest to be served by a tax adjustment, including
 the impact upon the state in the event the operator is unable to  remain
 financially viable.
  (2)  The  commission shall report their recommendation solely based on
 the criteria listed in subparagraph one of this paragraph to the  direc-
 tor of the division of budget who will make a final approval.
  (3) (i) As a condition of the lower slot machine tax rate, such gaming
 facility shall provide an initial report to the governor, the speaker of
 the  assembly, the temporary president of the senate, and the commission
 detailing the projected use of funds resulting from such tax  adjustment
 and  a  plan  that  prescribes  the  manner in which the licensed gaming
 facility potentially receiving the reduction in  its  slot  machine  tax
 rate  will rebuild their economic infrastructure through the rehiring of
 laid-off employees or the creation of new jobs.  Such  plan  shall  also
 clearly  establish  quarterly  and annual employment goals of increasing
 full-time employees. Such initial report and accompanying plan shall  be
 due  at  the time a facility is granted a tax adjustment. Thereafter, an
 annual report shall be made to the governor, the speaker of  the  assem-
 bly, the temporary president of the senate, and the commission detailing
 actual use of the funds resulting from such tax adjustment.  Such report
 shall  include,  but  not be limited to, any impact on employment levels
 since receiving the funds, an accounting of the use of such  funds,  any
 other  measures  implemented  to  improve the financial stability of the
 gaming facility, any relevant information that helped  in  the  determi-
 nation  of  such  slot  tax rate reduction, and any other information as
 deemed necessary by the commission. Such report shall be  due  no  later
 than  the  first  day of the fourth quarter after such tax rate has been
 granted.
  (ii) (A) At the conclusion of each year, a  licensed  gaming  facility
 shall  provide  an  affirmation in writing to the commission stating the
 employment goal in clause (i) of this subparagraph was either met or not
 met as described in the initial report. If the licensed gaming  facility
 is  found  to  have  not adhered to the plan by the commission, then the
 applicable slot tax rate shall be adjusted  at  the  discretion  of  the
 commission as follows:
  1.  If  the  actual  employment number is more than fifty percent less
 than the employment goal, then the slot tax rate shall be  increased  by
 ten percentage points.
  2.  If  the  actual  employment number is more than forty percent less
 than the employment goal, then the slot tax rate shall be  increased  by
 eight percentage points.
 A. 6144  3
 
  3.  If  the  actual employment number is more than thirty percent less
 than the employment goal, then the slot tax rate shall be  increased  by
 six percentage points.
  4.  If  the  actual employment number is more than twenty percent less
 than the employment goal, then the slot tax rate shall be  increased  by
 four percentage points.
  5.  If the actual employment number is more than ten percent less than
 the employment goal, then the slot tax rate shall be  increased  by  two
 percentage points.
  (B)  Such  finding and the reasoning thereof shall occur no later than
 thirty days following submission of the written affirmation.
  (iii) A licensed gaming facility may petition the commission to  lower
 the  tax  rate  applicable  to its slot machines to no lower than thirty
 percent no more than once annually after the effective date of the chap-
 ter of the laws of two thousand twenty-one which amended  this  subdivi-
 sion.  A  licensed gaming facility may request a revision to its plan in
 its initial report due to unforeseen circumstances.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 1351 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering
 and breeding law, as added by chapter  174  of  the  laws  of  2013,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  1. For a gaming facility in zone two, there is hereby imposed a tax on
 gross  gaming  revenues.  The  amount  of  such  tax imposed shall be as
 follows; provided, however, should a licensee  have  agreed  within  its
 application  to  supplement  the  tax  with  a  binding supplemental fee
 payment exceeding the aforementioned tax rate, such tax and supplemental
 fee shall apply for a gaming facility:
  (a) in region two, forty-five percent of  gross  gaming  revenue  from
 slot  machines  and  ten  percent of gross gaming revenue from all other
 sources.
  (b) in region one, thirty-nine percent of gross  gaming  revenue  from
 slot  machines  and  ten  percent of gross gaming revenue from all other
 sources.
  (c) in region five, thirty-seven percent of gross gaming revenue  from
 slot  machines  and  ten  percent of gross gaming revenue from all other
 sources. IT SHALL BE REQUIRED THAT BOTH CASINOS LOCATED IN  SUCH  REGION
 SHALL  BE  TAXED ON GROSS GAMING REVENUE AT THE SAME PERCENTAGES AS EACH
 OTHER AT ALL TIMES.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  be  deemed  to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2022; provided,
 however,  that  the  amendments  to subdivision 1 of section 1351 of the
 racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law made  by  section  one  of
 this act shall be subject to the expiration and reversion of such subdi-
 vision  pursuant  to  section 2 of part OOO of chapter 59 of the laws of
 2021, when upon such date the provisions of  section  two  of  this  act
 shall take effect.
