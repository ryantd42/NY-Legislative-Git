 Introduced  by  Sens. JACKSON, COMRIE, SALAZAR -- read twice and ordered
  printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Labor
 
 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to enacting the  safeguarding
  employees and accountability for termination act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The labor law is amended by adding a new  article  20-D  to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 20-D
  SAFEGUARDING EMPLOYEES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR TERMINATION ACT
 SECTION 745. SHORT TITLE.
  746. DEFINITIONS.
  747. ELEMENTS OF WRONGFUL DISCHARGE.
  748. REMEDIES.
  749. PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
  750. LIMITATION OF ACTIONS.
  751. EXEMPTIONS.
  752. ARBITRATION.
  753. EFFECT OF REJECTION OF OFFER TO ARBITRATE.
  §  745.  SHORT  TITLE. THIS ACT SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS THE
 "SAFEGUARDING EMPLOYEES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR TERMINATION ACT" OR  "THE
 SEAT ACT".
  § 746. DEFINITIONS. WHEN USED IN THIS ARTICLE, THE TERM:
  1. "CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE" MEANS THE VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF EMPLOY-
 MENT BY AN EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF A SITUATION CREATED BY AN ACT OR OMISSION
 OF THE EMPLOYER WHICH A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD FIND SO INTOLERABLE THAT
 VOLUNTARY  TERMINATION  IS THE ONLY REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE. CONSTRUCTIVE
 DISCHARGE DOES NOT MEAN VOLUNTARY TERMINATION BECAUSE OF  AN  EMPLOYER'S
 REFUSAL  TO  PROMOTE  THE EMPLOYEE OR IMPROVE WAGES, RESPONSIBILITIES OR
 OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 5459  2
 
  2. "DISCHARGE" INCLUDES A CONSTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE AS DEFINED IN  SUBDI-
 VISION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION  AND ANY OTHER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT,
 INCLUDING RESIGNATION, ELIMINATION OF THE  JOB,  FAILURE  TO  RECALL  OR
 REHIRE AND ANY OTHER CUTBACK IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FOR A LEGITIMATE
 BUSINESS REASON.
  3.  "FRINGE  BENEFITS"  MEANS  THE VALUE OF ANY EMPLOYER-PAID VACATION
 LEAVE, SICK LEAVE, MEDICAL INSURANCE PLAN,  DISABILITY  INSURANCE  PLAN,
 AND LIFE INSURANCE PLAN IN FORCE ON THE DATE OF THE TERMINATION.
  4.  "GOOD  CAUSE"  MEANS  ANY  REASONABLE  JOB-RELATED  GROUNDS FOR AN
 EMPLOYEE'S DISMISSAL BASED ON:
  (A) THE EMPLOYEE'S FAILURE TO SATISFACTORILY PERFORM JOB DUTIES;
  (B) THE EMPLOYEE'S DISRUPTION OF THE EMPLOYER'S OPERATION EXCEPT  WHEN
 ENGAGING IN CONCERTED ACTIVITY;
  (C)  THE  EMPLOYEE'S  MATERIAL  OR  REPEATED  VIOLATION  OF AN EXPRESS
 PROVISION OF THE EMPLOYER'S WRITTEN POLICIES; OR
  (D) OTHER LEGITIMATE BUSINESS REASONS DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYER WHILE
 EXERCISING THE EMPLOYER'S REASONABLE BUSINESS JUDGMENT. THE LEGAL USE OF
 A CONSUMABLE PRODUCT BY AN EMPLOYEE OFF THE EMPLOYER'S  PREMISES  DURING
 NONWORKING HOURS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS REASON; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
 THAT THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT APPLY TO:
  (I)  THE  USE  OF  A  CONSUMABLE PRODUCT THAT AFFECTS IN ANY MANNER AN
 EMPLOYEE'S ABILITY TO PERFORM JOB-RELATED EMPLOYMENT RESPONSIBILITIES OR
 THE SAFETY OF OTHER EMPLOYEES;
  (II) AN EMPLOYEE WHO, ON A PERSONAL BASIS, HAS A PROFESSIONAL  SERVICE
 CONTRACT WITH AN EMPLOYER AND THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED
 AUTHORIZES  THE  EMPLOYER, AS PART OF THE SERVICE CONTRACT, TO LIMIT THE
 USE OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS;
  (III) AN EMPLOYER THAT IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT, AS ONE OF ITS
 PRIMARY PURPOSES OR OBJECTIVES, DISCOURAGES  THE  USE  OF  ONE  OR  MORE
 LAWFUL PRODUCTS BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC; OR
  (IV)  AN  EMPLOYER  THAT  TAKES  ACTION  BASED  ON THE BELIEF THAT THE
 EMPLOYER'S ACTIONS ARE PERMISSIBLE UNDER AN ESTABLISHED SUBSTANCE  ABUSE
 OR  ALCOHOL  PROGRAM  OR  POLICY,  PROFESSIONAL  CONTRACT  OR COLLECTIVE
 BARGAINING AGREEMENT.
  6. "LEAVE OF ABSENCE" MEANS AN EMPLOYEE'S  ABSENCE  FROM  WORK  FOR  A
 PERIOD  OF  MORE THAN FIVE CONSECUTIVE WORKING DAYS FOR ANY REASON OTHER
 THAN HOLIDAYS AND VACATIONS.
  7. "LOST WAGES" MEANS THE GROSS AMOUNT OF WAGES THAT WOULD  HAVE  BEEN
 REPORTED TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AS GROSS INCOME ON FORM W-2 AND
 INCLUDES  OVERTIME  PAYMENTS,  ANY  BONUSES, AND ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION
 DEFERRED AT THE OPTION OF THE EMPLOYEE.
  § 747. ELEMENTS OF WRONGFUL DISCHARGE. 1. A DISCHARGE IS WRONGFUL ONLY
 IF:
  (A) THE DISCHARGE  WAS  NOT  FOR  GOOD  CAUSE  AND  THE  EMPLOYEE  HAD
 COMPLETED THE EMPLOYER'S PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT; OR
  (B)  THE  EMPLOYER MATERIALLY VIOLATED AN EXPRESS PROVISION OF ITS OWN
 WRITTEN PERSONNEL POLICY PRIOR  TO  THE  DISCHARGE,  AND  THE  VIOLATION
 DEPRIVED  THE EMPLOYEE OF A FAIR AND REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO REMAIN IN
 A POSITION OF EMPLOYMENT WITH THE EMPLOYER.
  2. DURING A PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT, THE EMPLOYMENT  MAY  BE
 TERMINATED AT THE WILL OF THE EMPLOYER ON NOTICE TO THE EMPLOYEE FOR ANY
 REASON OR FOR NO REASON.
  3.  THE  EMPLOYER  HAS  BROAD  DISCRETION  WHEN  MAKING  A DECISION TO
 DISCHARGE ANY MANAGERIAL OR SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEE.
  § 748. REMEDIES. 1. IF AN EMPLOYER HAS COMMITTED A WRONGFUL DISCHARGE,
 THE EMPLOYEE MAY BE AWARDED LOST WAGES AND FRINGE BENEFITS FOR A  PERIOD
 S. 5459  3
 
 NOT  TO  EXCEED  FOUR  YEARS  FROM  THE DATE OF DISCHARGE, TOGETHER WITH
 INTEREST ON THE LOST WAGES AND FRINGE BENEFITS. THE  EMPLOYEE'S  INTERIM
 EARNINGS,  DERIVED  FROM  ANY  NEW  KIND, NATURE, OR TYPE OF WORK, HIRE,
 CONTRACTOR  STATUS  OR  EMPLOYMENT  THAT  DID  NOT  EXIST AT THE TIME OF
 DISCHARGE, INCLUDING AMOUNTS THE EMPLOYEE COULD HAVE EARNED WITH REASON-
 ABLE DILIGENCE FROM THE WORK, HIRE,  CONTRACTOR  STATUS  OR  EMPLOYMENT,
 SHALL BE DEDUCTED FROM THE AMOUNT AWARDED FOR LOST WAGES.  BEFORE INTER-
 IM  EARNINGS  ARE DEDUCTED FROM LOST WAGES, THERE SHALL BE DEDUCTED FROM
 THE INTERIM EARNINGS ANY REASONABLE AMOUNTS EXPENDED BY THE EMPLOYEE  IN
 SEARCHING FOR, OBTAINING, OR RELOCATING TO NEW EMPLOYMENT.
  2. FOLLOWING ANY VERDICT OR AWARD IN FAVOR OF THE DISCHARGED EMPLOYEE,
 A  COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION SHALL CONSIDER ANY MONETARY PAYMENTS,
 COMPENSATION OR BENEFITS THE EMPLOYEE RECEIVED ARISING FROM  OR  RELATED
 TO  THE  DISCHARGE, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION OR BENEFITS, AND
 SHALL DEDUCT THOSE PAYMENTS, COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FROM  THE  AMOUNT
 AWARDED FOR LOST WAGES BEFORE ENTERING JUDGMENT.
  §  749.  PROBATIONARY  PERIOD.  1. IF AN EMPLOYER DOES NOT ESTABLISH A
 SPECIFIC PROBATIONARY PERIOD OR PROVIDE THAT THERE  IS  NO  PROBATIONARY
 PERIOD  PRIOR  TO  OR  AT  THE TIME THE EMPLOYEE BEGINS WORK, THERE IS A
 PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF ONE MONTH COMMENCING ON  THE  DATE  THE  EMPLOYEE
 BEGINS WORK.
  2.  AN  EMPLOYER MAY EXTEND A PROBATIONARY PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EXPIRA-

 EMPLOYEE DURING THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD AND REHIRING THE EMPLOYEE WITHIN
 THREE MONTHS AFTER SUCH DISCHARGE.
  3.  IF  AN  EMPLOYEE  HAS  ONE  OR  MORE  LEAVES OF ABSENCE DURING THE
 ORIGINAL PROBATIONARY PERIOD OR ANY EXTENSION OF THE PROBATIONARY  PERI-
 OD,  THE TIME OF EACH LEAVE OF ABSENCE SHALL NOT BE A PART OF THE PROBA-
 TIONARY PERIOD UNLESS THE EMPLOYER AFFIRMATIVELY ELECTS TO INCLUDE  EACH
 LEAVE OF ABSENCE AS PART OF THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD WITH THE AFFIRMATIVE
 WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE EMPLOYEE.
  § 750. LIMITATION OF ACTIONS. 1. AN ACTION UNDER THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE
 FILED WITHIN SIX YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF DISCHARGE.
  2.  IF  AN  EMPLOYER MAINTAINS WRITTEN INTERNAL PROCEDURES, OTHER THAN
 THOSE SPECIFIED IN SECTION SEVEN  HUNDRED  FIFTY-ONE  OF  THIS  ARTICLE,
 UNDER WHICH AN EMPLOYEE MAY APPEAL A DISCHARGE WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONAL
 STRUCTURE OF THE EMPLOYER, THE EMPLOYEE SHALL FIRST EXHAUST THOSE PROCE-
 DURES PRIOR TO FILING AN ACTION UNDER THIS ARTICLE. THE EMPLOYEE'S FAIL-
 URE TO INITIATE OR EXHAUST AVAILABLE INTERNAL PROCEDURES IS A DEFENSE TO
 AN  ACTION BROUGHT UNDER THIS ARTICLE. IF THE EMPLOYER'S INTERNAL PROCE-
 DURES ARE NOT COMPLETED WITHIN NINETY DAYS FROM THE  DATE  THE  EMPLOYEE
 INITIATES THE INTERNAL PROCEDURES, THE EMPLOYEE MAY FILE AN ACTION UNDER
 THIS  ARTICLE AND FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION THE EMPLOYER'S INTER-
 NAL PROCEDURES ARE CONSIDERED EXHAUSTED. THE STATUTE OF  LIMITATIONS  IN
 SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION  IS  TOLLED UNTIL THE PROCEDURES ARE
 EXHAUSTED. IN NO CASE MAY THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THE  EMPLOYER'S  INTERNAL
 PROCEDURES  EXTEND  THE  LIMITATION  PERIOD  IN  SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS
 SECTION MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS.
  3. IF THE EMPLOYER MAINTAINS WRITTEN INTERNAL PROCEDURES  UNDER  WHICH
 AN  EMPLOYEE  MAY APPEAL A DISCHARGE WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
 OF THE EMPLOYER, THE EMPLOYER SHALL WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF THE DATE  OF
 THE  DISCHARGE  NOTIFY  THE  DISCHARGED EMPLOYEE IN WRITING OR ELECTRON-
 ICALLY OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE INTERNAL PROCEDURES.  THE  TIMEFRAME  FOR
 THE  EMPLOYEE TO INITIATE THE PROCEDURES, IF ANY, BEGINS TO RUN FROM THE
 S. 5459  4
 
 DATE THE EMPLOYER SENDS OR PROVIDES A COPY OF THE INTERNAL PROCEDURES IN
 WRITING OR ELECTRONICALLY. A COPY OF THE PROCEDURES SHALL BE  CONSIDERED
 PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEE, IF THE EMPLOYER SENDS A COPY OF THE PROCEDURES
 TO THE EMPLOYEE'S LAST-KNOWN POSTAL MAILING ADDRESS AND ELECTRONIC MAIL-
 ING  ADDRESS,  IF  PROVIDED, OR THE EMPLOYEE'S ATTORNEY. IF THE EMPLOYER
 FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THIS SUBDIVISION, THE DISCHARGED EMPLOYEE NEED  NOT
 COMPLY WITH SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION.
  4.  IF  A  PLAINTIFF  COMMENCES  A CIVIL ACTION FOR WRONGFUL DISCHARGE
 UNDER THIS ARTICLE, THE PLAINTIFF SHALL MAKE SERVICE OF PROCESS PURSUANT
 TO SECTION THREE HUNDRED SIX-B OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES AFTER
 FILING THE COMPLAINT. IF THE PLAINTIFF FAILS TO MAKE SERVICE OF PROCESS,
 THE COURT, ON MOTION OR ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE, SHALL DISMISS THE  ACTION
 WITHOUT  PREJUDICE  AS  TO A DEFENDANT UNLESS THAT DEFENDANT HAS MADE AN
 APPEARANCE IN THE CIVIL ACTION. IF THE PLAINTIFF FAILS TO  MAKE  SERVICE
 OF  PROCESS,  THE  REMAINING SIX-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR A CIVIL
 ACTION UNDER THIS ARTICLE RESUMES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CIVIL ACTION
 IS DISMISSED.
  § 751. EXEMPTIONS. 1. THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT APPLY TO A DISCHARGE:
  (A) THAT IS SUBJECT  TO  ANY  OTHER  STATE  OR  FEDERAL  STATUTE  THAT
 PROVIDES  A PROCEDURE OR REMEDY FOR CONTESTING THE DISPUTE. THE STATUTES

  (B)  OF  AN EMPLOYEE COVERED BY A WRITTEN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREE-
 MENT OR A WRITTEN CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT FOR A SPECIFIC TERM.
  2. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, A "CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT  FOR  A
 SPECIFIC  TERM"  MAY  CONTAIN  A PROBATIONARY PERIOD PURSUANT TO SECTION
 SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-NINE OF THIS ARTICLE AND MAY  CONTAIN  AN  AUTOMATIC
 RENEWAL  CLAUSE THAT AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS THE CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT FOR
 ONE OR MORE SUCCESSIVE TERMS.
  § 752. ARBITRATION. 1. A PARTY MAY MAKE A WRITTEN OFFER TO ARBITRATE A
 DISPUTE THAT OTHERWISE COULD BE ADJUDICATED UNDER THIS ARTICLE.
  2. AN OFFER TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE IN WRITING AND CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING
 PROVISIONS:

 THE  ABSENCE OF AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SEVENTY-FIVE OF THE CIVIL
 PRACTICE LAW AND RULES.

 ENTITLED  TO HAVE THE ARBITRATOR'S FEE AND ALL COSTS OF ARBITRATION PAID
 BY THE EMPLOYER.
  5. IF A VALID OFFER TO ARBITRATE IS MADE AND ACCEPTED, ARBITRATION  IS
 THE  EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR THE WRONGFUL DISCHARGE DISPUTE AND THERE IS NO
 S. 5459  5
 
 RIGHT  TO  BRING  OR  CONTINUE  A  LAWSUIT  UNDER  THIS  ARTICLE.  THE
 ARBITRATOR'S  AWARD  IS  FINAL  AND  BINDING,  SUBJECT  TO REVIEW OF THE
 ARBITRATOR'S DECISION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF  ARTICLE  SEVENTY-FIVE  OF
 THE  CIVIL  PRACTICE LAW AND RULES.  HOWEVER, THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL NOT
 APPLY IF THE EMPLOYER MAINTAINS WRITTEN INTERNAL PROCEDURES THAT REQUIRE
 ARBITRATION UNDER SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY OF THIS
 ARTICLE.
  § 753. EFFECT OF REJECTION OF OFFER  TO  ARBITRATE.  IF  A  DISCHARGED

 NEYS' FEES INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE OF THE OFFER.
  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be confined in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the legislature that this act would  have  been  enacted even  if  such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.

 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
