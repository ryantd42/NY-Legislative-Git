  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 1202-dd of the tax law,  as  added
 by chapter 465 of the laws of 2016, is amended to read as follows:
  (1)  Notwithstanding  any other provisions of law to the contrary, the
 city of Hudson, Columbia county, is hereby authorized and  empowered  to
 adopt  and  amend local laws imposing in such city a tax, in addition to
 any other tax authorized and imposed pursuant to this  article  such  as
 the legislature has or would have the power and authority to impose upon
 persons occupying hotel or motel rooms in such city. For the purposes of
 this  section,  the  term  "hotel" or "motel" shall mean and include any
 facility or building or portion thereof providing lodging  on  an  over-
 night  basis  and shall include facilities designated and commonly known
 as "bed and breakfast" and "tourist" facilities. The rates of  such  tax
 shall  not  exceed  [four]  FIVE percent of the per diem rental rate for
 each room, provided however, that such tax shall not be applicable to  a
 permanent resident of a hotel or motel. For the purposes of this section
 the  term "permanent resident" shall mean a person occupying any room or
 rooms in a hotel or motel for at least thirty consecutive days.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 the  amendments  to subdivision 1 of section 1202-dd of the tax law made
 by section one of this act shall not affect the repeal of such  subdivi-
 sion and shall be deemed to be repealed therewith.
