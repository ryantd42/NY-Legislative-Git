 TY,  and select a securing order consistent with its determination under
 this subdivision. The court shall explain the  basis  for  its  determi-
 nation  and its choice of securing order on the record or in writing. In

 charge  arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released on
 [his or her] SUCH DEFENDANT'S own recognizance,  released  under  condi-
 tions,  or  had yet to be arraigned after the issuance of a desk appear-
 ance ticket for a separate felony or class A misdemeanor involving  harm
 to  an  identifiable  person  or  property,  or  any  charge of criminal
 possession of a firearm as defined in section 265.01-b of the penal law,

 nizance or under appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]

 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on

 tions, or had yet to be arraigned after the issuance of a  desk  appear-
 ance  ticket for a separate felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm
 to an identifiable person  or  property,  provided,  however,  that  the
 prosecutor  must  show  reasonable  cause  to believe that the defendant
 committed the instant crime and any underlying crime. For  the  purposes
 of  this subparagraph, any of the underlying crimes need not be a quali-
 fying offense as defined in this subdivision. For the purposes  of  this
 paragraph,  "harm  to  an identifiable person or property" shall include
 but not be limited to theft of or damage  to  property.  However,  based
 upon  a review of the facts alleged in the accusatory instrument, if the

 released  on  [his  or  her]  SUCH PRINCIPAL'S own recognizance or under
 appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]
  (xxi) criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree  as  defined

 restriction necessary to reasonably assure  the  principal's  return  to
