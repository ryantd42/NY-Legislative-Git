BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  HONORING  Luis  Angel  Firpo posthumously upon the
  occasion of his  induction  into  the  International
  Boxing Hall of Fame and Museum
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge
outstanding professionals  in  the  boxing  industry  who  distinguished
themselves  through  their  exceptional  performance,  attaining
unprecedented success and the highest  level  of  personal  achievement;
Luis  Angel  Firpo was one such individual, and his life of achievements
inspired others and contributed to the respect  and  admiration  of  the
sport of boxing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Luis Angel Firpo posthumously upon the occasion of  his  induction  into
the  International  Boxing  Hall  of Fame and Museum; he will be honored
within  the  Old-Timer  category  of  boxers  at  the  35th  Anniversary
celebration from June 6-9, 2024, in Canastota, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Luis  Angel Firpo was born in Junin, Argentina, on October
11, 1894; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1917,  in  Buenos  Aires,  Luis  Angel  Firpo  turned
professional;  in 1920, he won the South American heavyweight title with
a first-round defeat of previous champion, Dave Mills; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 6'3" heavy hitter scored victories over "Gunboat" Smith
(W 12 and KO 12), Bill Brennan (KO 12),  and  Jess  Willard  (KO  8)  to
catapult  him to the heavyweight title bid against champion Jack Dempsey
in 1923; on September 14, 1923, at the Polo Grounds in  New  York  City,
the  battle  for  the  title  commenced  before 80,000 cheering fans and
became known as one of the most dramatic fights in history; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the first round, "The  Wild  Bull  of  the  Pampas"  was
knocked  down  seven times, responding by launching the champion through
the ropes, nearly capturing the title, only to be dropped two more times
by Jack Dempsey who retained his title in the monumental face-off; and
 
  WHEREAS, Until 1926, Luis Angel Firpo continued his  boxing  career,
including  a no-decision fight with Harry Wills in 1924; from 1927-1935,
he was inactive but returned to the ring in 1936; in July of that  year,
following  a  defeat  by  Arturo  Godoy  (TKO  3), "The Wild Bull of the
Pampas" officially retired with a 31-4 record (26  KOs),  including  one
no-decision determination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At the age of 64, Luis Angel Firpo died on August 7, 1960;
prized in his home country of Argentina, a statue of "The Wild  Bull  of
the  Pampas"  was  erected in Buenos Aires to commemorate his death, and
Boxing Day in Argentina is September 14th,  the  date  of  his  fearless
fight against Jack Dempsey; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Luis  Angel  Firpo  clearly  contributed  to the spirit of
excellence which is a tradition of  the  International  Boxing  Hall  of
Fame; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals of such  outstanding  accomplishments  are  brought  to  our
attention,  they  should be recognized by all the citizens of this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Luis  Angel Firpo posthumously upon the occasion of his induction
into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and Museum; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of Luis Angel Firpo.
