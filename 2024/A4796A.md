  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Subdivision 1 of section 396-z of the general business law
 is amended by adding a new paragraph (m) to read as follows:
  (M) "VEHICLE COST RECOVERY FEE" MEANS THE ALLOWABLE RECOVERY, PURSUANT
 TO THIS SECTION, BY A RENTAL VEHICLE COMPANY FROM ITS  RENTERS  FOR  THE
 ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO TITLE, REGISTER, PLATE AND INSPECT RENTAL VEHI-
 CLES  IN  THE  STATE  AND  WHICH  FEE SHALL BE DETERMINED INITIALLY BY A
 RENTAL VEHICLE COMPANY'S GOOD  FAITH  ESTIMATE  OF  THE  RENTAL  VEHICLE
 COMPANY'S  DAILY CHARGE TO RECOVER ITS ACTUAL TOTAL ANNUAL MOTOR VEHICLE
 TITLING, REGISTRATION, PLATING AND INSPECTION COSTS, AND  THEREAFTER  BY
 AN  INTERNAL AUDIT OF THE PRECEDING YEAR'S ACTUAL COSTS CONDUCTED BY THE
 RENTAL VEHICLE COMPANY FROM ADJUSTING THE EXPENSE LEVEL DURING A  CALEN-
 DAR  YEAR  TO  MORE CLOSELY REFLECT ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED.  IF THE TOTAL
 AMOUNT OF THE VEHICLE COST RECOVERY FEES COLLECTED BY A  RENTAL  VEHICLE
 COMPANY  UNDER  THIS SECTION IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR EXCEEDS THE CAR RENTAL
 COMPANY'S ACTUAL COSTS TO LICENSE,  TITLE,  REGISTER,  AND  PLATE  MOTOR
 VEHICLES  AND  HAVE  THE  SAME INSPECTED FOR THAT CALENDAR YEAR, THE CAR
 RENTAL COMPANY MAY RETAIN THE EXCESS AMOUNT, AND  ADJUST  THE  ESTIMATED
 AVERAGE  PER  VEHICLE TITLING, LICENSING, PLATING, INSPECTING AND REGIS-
 TRATION CHARGE FOR  THE  FOLLOWING  CALENDAR  YEAR  BY  A  CORRESPONDING
 AMOUNT.  EACH SUCH AUDIT SHALL BE RETAINED FOR A PERIOD OF NOT LESS THAN
 FIVE  YEARS,  AND  SHALL  BE  MADE AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
 DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND ATTORNEY GENERAL UPON WRITTEN REQUEST.

  § 2. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision 10 of section 396-z of  the
 general business law, as amended by chapter 109 of the laws of 2018, are
 amended to read as follows:
  (a)  A  rental  vehicle  company  shall  not charge in addition to the
 rental rate, taxes, and mileage charge, if any, any fee  which  must  be
 paid as a condition of renting the vehicle, such as, but not limited to,
 required  fuel  surcharges,  each of which shall be separately stated on
 the rental agreement. In addition, a rental  vehicle  company  may  also
 state separately and charge, where applicable, airport fees as such term
 is  defined  herein. PROVIDED FURTHER, THAT A RENTAL VEHICLE COMPANY MAY
 ALSO SEPARATELY STATE THE VEHICLE COST RECOVERY  FEE  AS  SUCH  TERM  IS
 DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH (M) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION.
  (b)  In  addition  to the rental rate, taxes, applicable airport fees,
 VEHICLE COST RECOVERY FEE, and mileage charge, if any, a rental  vehicle
 company  may charge for an item or service provided in connection with a
 particular rental transaction if the renter could have avoided incurring
 the charge by not choosing to obtain or utilize  the  optional  item  or
 service,  such  as, but not limited to, optional accessories or services
 requested by the  renter,  service  charges  incident  to  the  renter's
 optional  return  of  the  vehicle to a location other than the location
 where the vehicle was rented, and charges for refueling the vehicle with
 as much fuel as was in the fuel tank at the beginning of the rental.
  § 3.  Nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize or require a
 rental vehicle company to  charge  for  incurred  costs  that  were  not
 authorized  pursuant  to section 396-z of the general business law prior
 to the effective date of this act.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall
 have  become a law, provided that the amendments to section 396-z of the
 general business law made by sections one and two of this act shall  not
 affect  the  expiration  of  such  section and shall be deemed to expire
 therewith.
