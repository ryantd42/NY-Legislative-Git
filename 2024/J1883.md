  COMMEMORATING  the  75th  Anniversary  of  the
  Sherburne Pageant of Bands
 
  WHEREAS, Festivals empower communities to attract new visitors while
capitalizing on local commercial and cultural value; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
support events of significance which contribute to the entertainment and
vitality  of  the communities they serve and which exemplify the history
and development of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Sherburne Pageant  of  Bands  on
Saturday, June 1, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The oldest pageant of bands in New York State commenced in
1949 as the Sherburne Band Festival; Albert Whitney,  a  local  business
owner,  and Frank L. Miller, a former Sherburne music teacher, initiated
the pageant; for their pioneer endeavor, both men were inducted into the
Sherburne-Earlville Central School District's Wall of Fame in 2010; and
 
  WHEREAS, That inaugural year the high  school  bands  of  Earlville,
Gilbertsville,  Greene,  Hamilton, New Berlin, Norwich, Oxford, and West
Winfield competed; Norwich placed first  in  both  the  parade  and  the
concert-band contest; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  band/musical  exhibition, sponsored by the Sherburne
Fire Department, is a free competition which  is  open  to  the  public;
hosted  by  Sherburne-Earlville High School annually, this event is part
of a three-day festival, attracting tens of thousands  of  visitors  the
first weekend of June; and
 
  WHEREAS,  High  school  bands from Central New York are evaluated by
professional judges, competing for ratings and trophies; jazz  ensemble,
small  ensemble, concert, parade, color guard, drum line, and drum major
performances  take  place  on  the  Sherburne-Earlville  Central  School
District campus in the village of fewer than 1,400 residents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These performances culminate into the main event, a parade
featuring dozens of marching bands through downtown Sherburne;  on  this
final  day  of  competition,  the  Awards  Ceremony  is held at the high
school's stadium; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend those organizations that have brought entertainment and cultural
enrichment  to the citizens of the State of New York; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 75th Anniversary of the Sherburne Pageant of Bands; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Sherburne-Earlville High School.
