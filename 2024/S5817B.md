  (1) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following  terms
 shall have the following meanings:
  (a)  ["Biodiesel"]  "BIOFUEL"  shall  mean  a fuel, designated B100 OR

 of [biodiesel] BIOFUEL blended with petroleum heating oil that meets the
 requirements  of  the  ASTM  international  specification  D396,  a fuel
 comprised of domestically-produced [renewable hydrocarbon  diesel]  R100
 with  petroleum heating oil that meets the specifications of ASTM inter-
 national specification D975, or other specifications  as  determined  by

 specification D396 or other specifications as determined by the  commis-
 sioner.
  [(e)]  (D)  "Feedstock"  shall mean soybean oil, oil from annual cover
 crops, algal oil, biogenic waste oils,  fats  or  greases,  or  non-food
 grade  corn  oil, provided that the commissioner may, by rules and regu-
 lations, modify the definition of feedstock based on the vegetable oils,
 animal fats or cellulosic biomass listed in  table  1  of  40  C.F.R.  §
 80.1426.
  (2)  On  and  after July first, two thousand eighteen, all heating oil
 sold for use in any building within the counties of Nassau, Suffolk  and
 Westchester shall be bioheating fuel that contains at least five percent
 [biodiesel] BIOFUEL.
  (3)  On  or after July first, two thousand twenty-two, all heating oil
 sold for use in any building within the state shall be  bioheating  fuel
 that contains at least five percent [biodiesel] BIOFUEL.
  (4)  On or after July first, two thousand twenty-five, all heating oil
 sold for use in any building within the state shall be  bioheating  fuel
 that contains at least ten percent [biodiesel] BIOFUEL.
  (5)  On or after July first, two thousand thirty, all heating oil sold
 for use in any building within the state shall be bioheating  fuel  that
 contains at least twenty percent [biodiesel] BIOFUEL.
  (6)  The  minimum content requirements of this section shall not apply
 to kerosene.
  (7) The governor may,  by  issuing  an  executive  order,  temporarily
 suspend  the  applicability  of  this  section  at any time based on the
 governor's determination, after consulting with the New York state ener-
 gy research and development authority and the department,  that  meeting
 the  requirement  of subdivision two of this section is not feasible due
 to lack of adequate supply of [biodiesel] BIOFUEL or  that  meeting  the
 requirement would result in financial hardship to consumers.
  (8)  The requirements of this section shall not: (a) prohibit the sale
 and use of bioheating fuel with the same or any  greater  percentage  of
 [biodiesel] BIOFUEL blended with heating oil, or the sale and use of one
 hundred  percent  [biodiesel]  BIOFUEL,  for  space and/or water heating
 purposes in the state; and (b) preempt any laws of the city of New  York
 with respect to mandated percentage levels of [biodiesel] BIOFUEL blends
 with  heating  oil  provided  that such laws require the same or greater
 percentage of [biodiesel] BIOFUEL blended with heating oil  as  required
 by this section.
  (9) No bioheating fuel shall be sold to a customer that would void the
 manufacturer's  warranty  for  that  burner  or  boiler  type unless the
 bioheat provider warranties in writing to the customer that the  use  of
 such  bioheating  fuel  will be covered to the extent and time limits of
 the warranty then covering such burner or boiler.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
