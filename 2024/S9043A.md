 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to implementing
  a residential parking system in the village of Port Chester

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 there  is  a lack of parking for residents of the Washington Park neigh-
 borhood in the village of Port Chester and residents  have  increasingly
 found it difficult to park their automobiles overnight on the streets in
 their  own neighborhoods given the scarcity of available parking spaces.
 Vehicles are parked across sidewalks and blocking driveways as  well  as
 creating hazardous conditions on street corners. This has caused signif-
 icant  safety  issues,  refuse and sanitation problems, traffic hazards,
 congestion, air and noise pollution and other disturbances.  The village
 of Port Chester is the second most  dense  municipality  in  Westchester
 county  and  a  residential  parking permit program is a tool that would
 assist in mitigating this important issue.
  The legislature, therefore, hereby declares the necessity of this  act
 to authorize the village of Port Chester in the county of Westchester to
 adopt  a  residential  parking  permit  system  in  accordance  with the
 provisions of this act.
  § 2. The vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 1640-s to read as follows:
  §  1640-S.  RESIDENTIAL PARKING SYSTEM IN THE VILLAGE OF PORT CHESTER.
 1.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ANY  LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,  THE
 VILLAGE  BOARD  OF  TRUSTEES  OF  THE  VILLAGE  OF  PORT CHESTER MAY, BY
 ADOPTION OF A LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE, PROVIDE FOR A RESIDENTIAL  PARKING
 PERMIT  SYSTEM  AND  FIX  AND  REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF FEES APPLICABLE TO
 PARKING WITHIN THE AREA IN WHICH SUCH PARKING SYSTEM  IS  IN  EFFECT  IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
