  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Subdivision  1  of  section  807 of the education law, as
 amended by section 2 of part B of chapter 54 of the  laws  of  2016,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  It shall be the duty of the principal or other person in charge of
 every public or private school or  educational  institution  within  the
 state,  other  than  colleges or universities, to instruct and train the
 pupils by means of drills, so that they may in  a  sudden  emergency  be
 able  to respond appropriately in the shortest possible time and without
 confusion or panic. Such drills shall be held at least twelve  times  in
 each  school  year, eight of which required drills shall be held between
 September first and December thirty-first of each such  year.  Eight  of
 all  such  drills  shall  be  evacuation  drills, four of which shall be
 through use of the fire escapes on  buildings  where  fire  escapes  are
 provided  or  through  the  use of identified secondary means of egress.
 Four of all such required drills shall be EMERGENCY ATTACK DRILLS,  WITH
 TWO  OF  SUCH DRILLS BEING lock-down drills AND TWO OF SUCH DRILLS BEING
 ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS. UPON REQUEST OF THE PRINCIPAL OR OTHER PERSON  IN
 CHARGE  OF  SUCH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, THE NEW YORK
 STATE SCHOOL SAFETY IMPROVEMENT TEAMS, ESTABLISHED PURSUANT  TO  SECTION
 TWENTY-EIGHT  HUNDRED  ONE-B  OF THIS CHAPTER, SHALL PROVIDE RECOMMENDA-
 TIONS ON HOW TO PERFORM SUCH LOCK-DOWN AND ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS AT SUCH
 PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.  Drills shall be conducted at
 different times of the school day. Pupils shall  be  instructed  in  the
 procedure  to  be  followed  in  the event that a fire occurs during the
 lunch  period  or  assembly,  provided  however,  that  such  additional
 instruction  may  be  waived  where  a  drill is held during the regular
 school lunch period or assembly. Four additional drills shall be held in
 each school year during the hours after sunset  and  before  sunrise  in
