 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  penal law, in relation to justifying the use of
  force by police officers and peace officers and to the  excessive  use
  of police force
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 35.30 of the penal law, as added by chapter  73  of
 the laws of 1968, the opening paragraph of subdivision 1, subdivisions 2
 and  3,  the  opening  paragraph  and paragraph (a) of subdivision 4 and
 subdivision 5 as amended by chapter 511 of the laws of  2004,  paragraph
 (c)  of subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 843 of the laws of 1980, and
 paragraph (b) of subdivision 4 as amended by chapter 264 of the laws  of
 2003, is amended to read as follows:
 § 35.30 Justification;  use  of physical force in making an arrest or in
  preventing an escape.
  1. A police officer or a peace officer, in the course of effecting  or
 attempting  to  effect an arrest THAT THE OFFICER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS
 LAWFUL, or of preventing or attempting to prevent the escape from custo-
 dy, of a person whom he or she reasonably believes to have committed  an
 offense, may use physical force when and to the extent he or she reason-
 ably  believes  such to be necessary to effect the arrest, or to prevent
 the escape from custody, or in self-defense or to defend a third  person
 from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of
 physical  force;  except that deadly physical force may be used for such
 purposes only when he or she reasonably believes that:
  (a) [The offense committed by such person was:
  (i) a felony or an attempt to commit a felony  involving  the  use  or
 attempted  use  or  threatened  imminent use of physical force against a
 person; or
  (ii) kidnapping, arson, escape in the first degree,  burglary  in  the
 first  degree  or  any attempt to commit such a crime] THERE IS PROBABLE
 CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON HAS COMMITTED A FELONY INVOLVING  DEATH
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 OR  SERIOUS  BODILY INJURY, AND THE OFFICER REASONABLY BELIEVES (I) SUCH
 PERSON IS ARMED WITH A FIREARM OR OTHER DEADLY WEAPON, (II) THE INDIVID-
 UAL WOULD CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO ANOTHER IF  NOT  IMME-
 DIATELY  APPREHENDED,  (III)  THAT  NO LESS-LETHAL FORCE ALTERNATIVES OR
 NON-FORCE TACTICS OR TECHNIQUES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SUBDUE THE PERSON, AND
 (IV) THAT THE OFFICER'S USE OF DEADLY FORCE DOES NOT CREATE  A  SUBSTAN-
 TIAL  RISK OF SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO ANY PERSONS OTHER THAN THE PERSON
 AGAINST WHOM THE DEADLY FORCE IS DIRECTED; or
  (b) [The offense committed or attempted by such person  was  a  felony
 and  that,  in  the course of resisting arrest therefor or attempting to
 escape from custody, such person is armed with a firearm or deadly weap-
 on; or
  (c)] Regardless of the particular offense which is the subject of  the
 arrest  or  attempted escape, the use of deadly physical force is neces-
 sary to defend the police officer or peace  officer  or  another  person
 from  what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use
 of deadly physical force.
  2. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, A PERSON  REASONABLY  BELIEVES  A
 USE OF FORCE IS NECESSARY WHEN (A) HE OR SHE ACTUALLY HOLDS THAT BELIEF,
 AND (B) A REASONABLE PERSON UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HOLD THAT
 BELIEF.
  3.  FOR  THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, PHYSICAL FORCE SHALL BE CONSID-
 ERED NECESSARY WHEN THERE ARE NO REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO  EFFECT
 THE  LAWFUL  OBJECTIVE AND AVOID THE USE OF FORCE OR REDUCE THE SEVERITY
 OF THE FORCE USED, INCLUDING THE USE OF LESS-LETHAL FORCE  ALTERNATIVES,
 NON-FORCE TACTICS OR TECHNIQUES THAT ARE INTENDED TO STABILIZE THE SITU-
 ATION  AND  REDUCE THE IMMEDIACY OF THE THREAT, SUCH AS DISTANCE, COVER,
 CONTAINMENT, TACTICAL REPOSITIONING, REQUESTING ADDITIONAL OFFICERS, AND
 SURVEILLANCE, VERBAL COMMUNICATION OR DE-ESCALATION AND  THE  DEPLOYMENT
 OF  SPECIALIZED  EQUIPMENT  OR  RESOURCES,  SUCH  AS OFFICERS TRAINED IN
 CRISIS INTERVENTION, OR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AN  ALTERNATIVE  TO
 THE  USE  OF  PHYSICAL  FORCE MAY BE A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE EVEN IF IT
 EXTENDS THE OVERALL DURATION OF THE INTERACTION.
  4. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION,  A  THREAT  SHALL  BE  CONSIDERED
 IMMINENT WHEN THE PERSON REASONABLY APPEARS TO HAVE THE PRESENT ABILITY,
 OPPORTUNITY, AND APPARENT INTENT TO IMMEDIATELY INFLICT INJURY.
  5.  THE USE OF ANY LEVEL OF FORCE BY A POLICE OFFICER OR PEACE OFFICER
 MAY BE DEEMED NOT JUSTIFIED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS  SECTION
 IF SUCH OFFICER ENGAGED IN CONDUCT THAT CREATED A SUBSTANTIAL AND UNJUS-
 TIFIABLE RISK THAT FORCE WOULD BECOME NECESSARY.
  6.  THE USE OF ANY LEVEL OF FORCE BY A POLICE OFFICER OR PEACE OFFICER
 SHALL BE PRESUMPTIVELY NOT JUSTIFIED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS
 SECTION IF APPLIED TO A  PERSON  WHO  HAS  BEEN  RENDERED  INCAPABLE  OF
 RESISTING ARREST.
  7.  The  fact that a police officer or a peace officer is justified in
 using deadly physical force under  circumstances  prescribed  in  [para-
 graphs  (a) and (b) of] subdivision one OF THIS SECTION does not consti-
 tute justification for reckless conduct by such police officer or  peace
 officer  amounting  to  an  offense  against or with respect to innocent
 persons whom he or she is not seeking to arrest or retain in custody.
  [3.] 8. A person who has been directed by a police officer or a  peace
 officer  to  assist  such  police  officer or peace officer to effect an
 arrest or to prevent an escape from  custody  may  use  physical  force,
 other  than deadly physical force, when and to the extent that he or she
 reasonably believes such to be necessary to carry out such police  offi-
 cer's  or  peace  officer's  direction,  unless he or she knows that the
 S. 8449  3
 
 arrest or prospective arrest is not or was not authorized  and  may  use
 deadly physical force under such circumstances when:
  (a)  He  or  she reasonably believes such to be necessary for self-de-
 fense or to defend a  third  person  from  what  he  or  she  reasonably
 believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force; or
  (b)  He  or  she  is  directed or authorized by such police officer or
 peace officer to use deadly physical force unless he or she  knows  that
 the  police  officer  or  peace  officer is not authorized to use deadly
 physical force under the circumstances.
  [4.] 9. A private person acting on his or  her  own  account  may  use
 physical  force,  other  than deadly physical force, upon another person
 when and to the extent that he or she reasonably  believes  such  to  be
 necessary to effect an arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of a
 person  whom  he or she reasonably believes to have committed an offense
 and who in fact has committed such offense; and may use deadly  physical
 force  for  such  purpose  when he or she reasonably believes such to be
 necessary to[:
  (a) Defend] DEFEND himself, herself or a third person from what he  or
 she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical
 force[; or
  (b)  Effect  the  arrest  of  a  person  who  has  committed  murder,
 manslaughter in the first degree, robbery,  forcible  rape  or  forcible
 criminal sexual act and who is in immediate flight therefrom].
  [5.]  10. A guard, police officer or peace officer who is charged with
 the duty of guarding prisoners in a detention facility, as that term  is
 defined  in  section  205.00  OF THIS CHAPTER, or while in transit to or
 from a detention facility, may use physical force when and to the extent
 that he or she reasonably believes such to be necessary to  prevent  the
 escape  of a prisoner from a detention facility or from custody while in
 transit thereto or therefrom.
