 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  enacting the "State Police  Retention  act";  and  providing  for  the
  repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title.  This act shall be known and may be  cited  as
 the "State Police Retention act".
  § 2. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding a new
 section 381-c to read as follows:
  §  381-C. DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN PAYABLE TO MEMBERS AND OFFI-
 CERS OF THE DIVISION OF STATE  POLICE.  A.  DEFERRED  RETIREMENT  OPTION
 PLAN.  DEFERRED  RETIREMENT  OPTION  PLAN, (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS
 "DROP"), IS A RETIREMENT PLAN UNDER WHICH AN ELIGIBLE MEMBER  MAY  ELECT
 TO  PARTICIPATE, DEFERRING RECEIPT OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS WHILE CONTINU-
 ING EMPLOYMENT WITH THE DIVISION OF STATE POLICE. FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF
 THIS  SECTION, AN "ELIGIBLE MEMBER" IS ANY MEMBER OR OFFICER EMPLOYED BY
 THE DIVISION OF STATE POLICE. DURING THE PERIOD OF CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT,
 THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER'S MONTHLY RETIREMENT BENEFIT SHALL BE  DEFERRED  AND
 HELD  BY  THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBER PLUS INTEREST AT
 AN EFFECTIVE RATE OF ONE AND ONE-HALF PERCENT FOR THE SPECIFIC PERIOD OF
 PARTICIPATION IN DROP AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION C OF THIS SECTION. UPON
 COMPLETION OF THE DROP PERIOD, THE ELIGIBLE  MEMBER  SHALL  RECEIVE  THE
 TOTAL AMOUNT OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS DEFERRED UNDER DROP WITHOUT OPTIONAL
 MODIFICATION  AS  PERMITTED  BY SUBDIVISIONS D AND E OF THIS SECTION AND

 A. 5737--A  2
 
 MENT BENEFIT WITH OPTIONAL MODIFICATION AS FURTHER PROVIDED IN  SUBDIVI-
 SION D OF THIS SECTION.
  B.  PARTICIPATION  IN  DROP.  ANY  ELIGIBLE  MEMBER  WHO  IS CURRENTLY
 EMPLOYED BY THE DIVISION OF STATE POLICE AND QUALIFIES TO RETIRE  PURSU-
 ANT  TO  SECTION  THREE  HUNDRED EIGHTY-ONE-B OF THIS TITLE BY REASON OF
 COMPLETING TWENTY YEARS OF CREDITABLE SERVICE MAY ELECT  TO  PARTICIPATE
 IN DROP.
  C.  ELECTION IN DROP. SUCH ELECTION SHALL BE ON A FORM PREPARED BY THE
 COMPTROLLER AND MAY BE FOR ANY PERIOD  OF  TIME  NOT  LESS  THAN  TWELVE
 MONTHS OR MORE THAN THIRTY-SIX MONTHS DURATION. ANY MEMBER WHO ELECTS TO
 PARTICIPATE IN DROP SHALL BE CONSIDERED RETIRED ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE
 EXPIRATION  OF  THE  DROP  PERIOD, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT ALL LOANS AND
 EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE RESOLVED BY THE DATE OF ENTRY  INTO  DROP.
 UPON EXPIRATION OF THE TIME PERIOD SELECTED BY THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER, SUCH
 MEMBER'S PARTICIPATION IN DROP SHALL TERMINATE.
  D. BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER DROP. (1) EFFECTIVE WITH THE DATE OF PARTIC-
 IPATION IN DROP, THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER'S NORMAL SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT
 SHALL  BE  CALCULATED, USING CREDITABLE SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE SALARY
 AS IF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF RETIREMENT WAS THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO  DROP.
 THE  AMOUNT DEFERRED PURSUANT TO DROP SHALL BE CALCULATED BASED UPON THE
 ELIGIBLE MEMBER'S ZERO OPTION RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE UNTIL SUCH MEMBER HAS
 OBTAINED THE APPLICABLE MAXIMUM  SERVICE  RETIREMENT  LIMIT  BASED  UPON
 YEARS  OF  SERVICE.  ANY ADDITIONAL PARTICIPATION IN DROP AFTER A MEMBER
 HAS OBTAINED THE MAXIMUM SERVICE RETIREMENT LIMIT BASED  UPON  YEARS  OF
 SERVICE  SHALL  BE  CALCULATED  BASED UPON SIXTY PERCENT OF THE MEMBER'S
 FULL ANNUAL RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE. IN ADDITION, FOR THE PURPOSES OF  THIS
 SECTION,  THE  ANNUAL  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE FOR ANY MEMBER ELECTING DROP
 SHALL BE CALCULATED USING A THREE-YEAR FINAL AVERAGE SALARY  AS  DEFINED
 ELSEWHERE IN THIS ARTICLE. THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER SHALL, HOWEVER, ELECT HIS
 OR HER OPTIONAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT AT THE COMPLETION OF THE DROP PERIOD.
  (2)  IF  THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER DIES PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE PERIOD OF
 PARTICIPATION IN DROP, THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER SHALL BE TREATED AS  IF  SUCH
 DROP  ELECTION DID NOT EXIST. IN LIEU OF THE DROP PAYMENT, A DEATH BENE-
 FIT SHALL BE PAYABLE CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS OF THIS CHAPTER  AND  ALL
 SALARY  AND  SERVICE  REPORTED  FOR SUCH ELIGIBLE MEMBER DURING THE DROP
 PERIOD SHALL BE CONSIDERED IN CALCULATING THE  ELIGIBLE  MEMBER'S  DEATH
 BENEFIT.
  (3)  IF  THE  ELIGIBLE  MEMBER  IS  APPROVED  FOR  DISABILITY BENEFITS
 PROVIDED IN THIS CHAPTER DURING THE DROP  PERIOD,  THE  ELIGIBLE  MEMBER
 SHALL  BE  TREATED AS IF THE DROP ELECTION DID NOT EXIST. IN LIEU OF THE
 DROP PAYMENT, A DISABILITY RETIREMENT BENEFIT SHALL BE PAYABLE  CONSIST-
 ENT  WITH  THE TERMS OF THIS CHAPTER AND ALL SALARY AND SERVICE REPORTED
 FOR SUCH ELIGIBLE MEMBER DURING THE DROP PERIOD SHALL BE  CONSIDERED  IN
 CALCULATING THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER'S DISABILITY RETIREMENT BENEFIT.
  (4) IF AN ELIGIBLE MEMBER OTHERWISE FAILS TO COMPLETE HIS OR HER PERI-
 OD  OF SERVICE AS ELECTED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION C OF THIS SECTION, THE
 ELIGIBLE MEMBER SHALL BE TREATED AS IF SUCH DROP ELECTION DID NOT EXIST.
 IN LIEU OF THE DROP PAYMENT, THE NORMAL SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT SHALL
 BE PAYABLE CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS OF THIS CHAPTER AND ALL SALARY  AND
 SERVICE  REPORTED  FOR SUCH ELIGIBLE MEMBER DURING THE DROP PERIOD SHALL
 BE CONSIDERED IN CALCULATING THE ELIGIBLE  MEMBER'S  SERVICE  RETIREMENT
 BENEFIT.
  (5)  IF  AN  ELIGIBLE MEMBER REMAINS EMPLOYED AFTER HIS OR HER PARTIC-
 IPATION IN DROP IS TERMINATED, SUCH MEMBER SHALL FORFEIT ALL DROP  BENE-
 FITS  AND  CONTINUE  EMPLOYMENT  AS IF SUCH DROP ELECTION DID NOT EXIST.
 A. 5737--A  3
 
 SUCH MEMBER SHALL THEN BE ELIGIBLE TO ELECT  DROP  CONSISTENT  WITH  THE
 TERMS OF THIS SECTION.
  (6)  IF  AN  ELIGIBLE MEMBER IS APPROVED FOR DISABILITY BENEFITS AFTER
 BENEFITS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO DROP HAVE BEEN PAID,  THE  ELIGIBLE  MEMBER
 MAY  ELECT  TO RECEIVE THE DISABILITY BENEFITS IN LIEU OF DROP BENEFITS,
 BUT SUCH DISABILITY BENEFITS SHALL BE ACTUARIALLY ADJUSTED FOR ANY BENE-
 FITS PAID UNDER DROP.
  E. METHOD OF PAYMENT. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEMBER'S  PARTICIPATION
 IN DROP, THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM SHALL PAY THE DEFERRED SERVICE RETIREMENT
 BENEFITS IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS AS ELECTED BY THE MEMBER:
  (1) LUMP SUM: ALL ACCRUED DROP BENEFITS, PLUS INTEREST, LESS WITHHOLD-
 ING  AS  REQUIRED  BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, SHALL BE PAID TO THE
 DROP PARTICIPANT OR ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY OR AS OTHERWISE  DETERMINED  BY
 OPERATION OF LAW;
  (2)  DIRECT  ROLLOVER: ALL ACCRUED DROP BENEFITS, PLUS INTEREST, SHALL
 BE PAID FROM THE RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  TO  A  CUSTODIAN  OF  THE  ELIGIBLE
 RETIREMENT  PLAN  OR OTHER ELIGIBLE PLAN OR ACCOUNT AS PROVIDED PURSUANT
 TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AS DIRECTED BY THE MEMBER OR ELIGIBLE BENE-
 FICIARY;
  (3) PARTIAL LUMP SUM: A PORTION OF THE DROP BENEFITS SHALL BE PAID  TO
 THE  DROP PARTICIPANT OR ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY, LESS WITHHOLDING REQUIRED
 BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND THE REMAINING DROP BENEFITS  MAY  BE
 ROLLED OVER AS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
  FOR  PURPOSES  OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE TERM "ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY" IS
 ONE WHO QUALIFIES TO ROLLOVER BENEFITS FROM A QUALIFIED BENEFIT PLAN  OR
 ACCOUNT  AS  PROVIDED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE FORMS OF PAYMENT
 PROVIDED BY THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL COMPLY WITH THE MINIMUM  DISTRIBUTION
 REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
  F.  REGULATIONS.  THE COMPTROLLER SHALL PRESCRIBE SUCH RULES AND REGU-
 LATIONS AS MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION AND  IMPLE-
 MENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  §  3.  This  act  shall  take effect immediately and shall expire five
 years after it  shall  have  become  a  law  when  upon  such  date  the
 provisions of this act shall be deemed repealed; provided, however, that
 the  expiration  of  this  act  shall  not prevent a member who has duly
 elected to participate in DROP pursuant to the provisions  of  this  act
 from completing the full period of DROP selected.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would allow police officers employed by the New York State
 Division of State Police to elect to participate in a  Deferred  Retire-
 ment  Option Plan (DROP), deferring receipt of retirement benefits while
 continuing their current employment. The main features of this DROP are:
  1. Members may elect to participate in the DROP upon the attainment of
 retirement eligibility.
  2. The service retirement benefit shall be the single  life  allowance
 determined  based  on  the  service  and  final  average  salary  at the
 commencement of DROP  participation.  However,  once  a  member's  total
 service  credit  (including  service  during the DROP period) exceeds 32
 years, the monthly payment into the DROP account will be limited to  60%
 of the single life allowance.
  3.  The  New  York  State  and Local Police and Fire Retirement System
 (NYSLPFRS) shall consider DROP participants active members,  and  annual
 employer  contributions  shall  continue  to be made by the State of New
 York to the NYSLPFRS on behalf of such members.  All  loans  and  excess
 contributions shall be resolved by the date of entry into DROP.
 A. 5737--A  4
 
  4.  The  length  of participation in the DROP must be specified at the
 time of election, and may not be less than one year,  nor  exceed  three
 years.  However, if the affected member should leave employment before
 or after the scheduled DROP termination date, such member shall  forfeit
 all  DROP  benefits,  and  shall be treated as though there were no DROP
 election.
  5. During the DROP  period,  the  monthly  pension  of  such  affected
 members  will  be  deferred and held by the NYSLPFRS on their behalf and
 shall accrue interest at 1.5%. Such account, with interest accumulation,
 must be distributed in full at the end of the specified DROP period.
  6. If an affected member should die or become disabled during the DROP
 period, such member would be  treated  as  though  there  were  no  DROP
 election.
  7.  Upon  termination  from  DROP, such affected members shall receive
 their deferred payments, and shall also begin to receive their previous-
 ly determined pensions.
  8. This legislation will expire five years after the date it becomes a
 law with the provision that all members who  entered  into  DROP  before
 that date will be allowed to finish their elected DROP period.
  Section  212  of  the  Retirement  and  Social  Security Law generally
 prevents service retirees from receiving salaries of more  than  $35,000
 for public employment before attaining age 65. This proposal would allow
 members  to receive a full salary and retirement benefits SIMULTANEOUSLY
 for up to three years.
  The Partial Lump Sum program  currently  allows  NYSLPFRS  members  to
 receive  lump  sums up to 25% of the present value of their pensions. In
 combination with this proposal, an  affected  member  could  potentially
 receive  a lump sum exceeding 50% of the present value of their pension.
 This significantly reduces the value of ongoing  pension  payments  over
 the member's remaining lifetime.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be past service costs which would depend on the
 current salary, age, and length of service of the affected members.  It
 is estimated that the past service cost per member would average approx-
 imately  100% of salary for the affected members. This past service cost
 of approximately $392 million will be borne by the State of New York  as
 a  one-time  payment  and  assumes that payment will be made on March 1,
 2025.
  If the anticipated retirement experience of members who  are  eligible
 for  this  benefit  changes  significantly in the future, there would be
 additional increases in employer costs.
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  These  estimated costs are based on 2,274 affected members employed by
 the New York State Division of  State  Police,  with  annual  salary  of
 approximately $373 million as of March 31, 2023.
