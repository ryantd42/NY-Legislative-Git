 accept any fee for representing the person for whom  [he  or  she]  SUCH
 COUNSEL  is  assigned  without approval of the court as herein provided.
 Whenever it appears that such person is financially able to obtain coun-
 sel or make partial payment for the representation, counsel  may  report
 this  fact  to  the  court and the court may terminate the assignment or
 authorize payment, as the interests of  justice  may  dictate,  to  such
