have brought to our shores; and

Caribbean  Americans and immigrants who have made the great State of New

in the American experience; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Bajan  Americans have prospered in every sector of
our society and enhanced our national character  while  maintaining  the
multi-ethnic  and  multi-cultural traditions of their homeland; they are
doctors and lawyers, public servants and scientists,  and  athletes  and
service  members;  their  successes  inspire  individuals  in the United

Charles  Gittens,  the  first  African-American  secret  service  agent;

  WHEREAS,  During  Barbados  Heritage  Month,  we  also recognize the
important friendship between the United States and Barbados as we expand
our partnership to promote economic development, democratic  governance,
 
citizen security, and improved health and education in the region, these
