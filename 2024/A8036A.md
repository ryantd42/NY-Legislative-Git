 POOLS WHICH MAY CAUSE UNSANITARY CONDITIONS,  UNLESS  DUE  PROVISION  IS
 MADE  FOR DRAINING SUCH POOLS INTO THE LOWEST WATER LEVEL OF SUCH RESER-
 VOIR, DAM OR OTHER FLOOD MITIGATION STRUCTURE. IT SHALL BE UNLAWFUL  FOR
 ANY  OFFICER  OR  PERSON  IN CHARGE OF ANY RESERVOIR, DAM OR OTHER FLOOD
 MITIGATION STRUCTURE TO VIOLATE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.

 RIVER  AT  A  RESERVOIR, DAM OR OTHER FLOOD MITIGATION STRUCTURE THEREON
 SHALL NOT BE RESTRICTED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE OWNER OF  SUCH  POWER
 PLANT.
  5.  NO  RESERVOIR,  DAM  OR  OTHER FLOOD MITIGATION STRUCTURE SHALL BE
 CONSTRUCTED PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  TITLE  OF  A  CAPACITY
 GREATER THAN IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE AVERAGE FLOW.

 DETERMINATION,  NOTICE SHALL BE GIVEN BY THE AUTHORITY OF PUBLICATION OF
 A TIME AND PLACE WHERE THE AUTHORITY WILL MEET TO HEAR ANY PUBLIC CORPO-
 RATION OR PERSON AGGRIEVED BY THE SAME.  THE  AFFIDAVIT  OF  THE  PERSON

 FLOOD  MITIGATION  STRUCTURE  SHALL  EXCEED THE ESTIMATE MADE AND APPOR-
 TIONED AS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS TITLE, THE  AMOUNT  OF  SUCH  EXCESS
 COST,  LESS  THE  AMOUNT  WHICH MAY BE CHARGEABLE TO THE STATE, SHALL BE

 AND BY THE SAME PROCEDURE AS THE ORIGINAL APPORTIONMENT,  AND  SHALL  BE

 BECOMES LIABLE EQUITABLY FOR  SUCH  SUBSEQUENT  EXPENSES,  A  SUBSEQUENT
 APPORTIONMENT  MAY  BE  MADE  IN THE SAME MANNER AND SUBJECT TO THE SAME
 REVIEW AS THE ORIGINAL APPORTIONMENT. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT BEFORE ANY
 SUCH APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS OR ANY ASSESSMENT IS MADE BY THE  AUTHORITY,

 EDGED  IN LIKE MANNER AS A DEED, BY WHICH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE
 THE PUBLIC CORPORATIONS AND OWNERS OF PROPERTY BENEFITED BY THE IMPROVE-
 MENT AND CONSENT TO BEAR THE  COST  THEREOF,  LESS  ANY  SUM  PREVIOUSLY
 A. 8036  23
 
 APPROPRIATED  BY  THE STATE THEREFOR, TOGETHER WITH CHARGES PROVIDED FOR
 IN SECTION TWENTY-SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-NINE-QQQQQ OF THIS TITLE, AND  TO
 HAVE THE SAME ASSESSED AGAINST THEM OR THEIR PROPERTY AS PROVIDED FOR IN

 ACCEPTANCE BY THE AUTHORITY, FOR THE BASIS ON WHICH THE  ASSESSMENT  FOR
 THE IMPROVEMENT SHALL BE MADE UPON THE PARTIES CONSENTING.
  8. THE AUTHORITY MAY ACCEPT OR REJECT SUCH CONSENT. IF IT ACCEPTS SUCH
 CONSENT  IT  SHALL,  BY  RESOLUTION,  PROVIDE FOR THE LEVY OF THE ENTIRE
 ASSESSMENT UPON THE PUBLIC CORPORATIONS  AND  PROPERTY  OF  THE  PARTIES
 FILING  SUCH  CONSENT, ON THE BASIS OF BENEFITS RECEIVED, IF ANY, DETER-
 MINED BY THE TERMS OF THE CONSENT, OR IF NO BASIS OF ASSESSMENT BE FIXED
