 AN  ACT  to  amend the election law, in relation to the authority of the

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision 1 of section 3-104 of the
 election law, as amended by section 4 of subpart B of part H of  chapter
 55 of the laws of 2014,  is amended to read as follows:
  (b)  The  state  board of elections shall have jurisdiction of, and be
 responsible for, the execution and  enforcement  of  the  provisions  of
 article fourteen of this chapter and other statutes governing campaigns,
 elections  and  related  procedures;  provided  however  that  the chief
 enforcement counsel shall have sole authority within the state board  of
 elections  to  investigate  on  his  or  her  own  initiative,  or  upon
 complaint, alleged violations  of  such  statutes,  and  all  complaints
 alleging  violations  shall be forwarded to the division of election law
 enforcement.
  § 2.  Subdivision 3 of section 3-104 of the election law,  as  amended
 by  section  4 of subpart B of part H of chapter 55 of the laws of 2014,
 is amended to read as follows:
  3. Upon receipt of a complaint and supporting information alleging any
 violation of this chapter, or upon his or her own initiative, the  chief
 enforcement counsel shall determine if an investigation should be under-
 taken.  The  chief enforcement counsel shall, if necessary, obtain addi-
 tional information from the complainant or from other sources to  assist
 such  counsel  in making this determination. Such analysis shall include

 a violation of this chapter and, second,  whether  the  allegations  are
 supported by credible evidence. The chief enforcement counsel may at any
 time  ask  that  the  board  authorize him or her to exercise the powers
 which the board is otherwise authorized to exercise pursuant to subdivi-
 sions five and six of section 3-102 of this title.  The board shall vote
 on  whether  to  grant  or  refuse to grant such authority no later than
 twenty days after the chief enforcement counsel makes such request.  For
 purposes  of considering and voting on such request, QUORUM REQUIREMENTS
 ARE MET IF TWO BOARD MEMBERS AND THE CHIEF ENFORCEMENT COUNSEL ARE PRES-
 ENT AT THE VOTE, AND the chief enforcement counsel shall be entitled  to
 participate in all matters related thereto and shall vote on the board's
 granting  or  refusal  to  grant  such request only when there is a tie.
 Should the board not vote on such request  within  twenty  days  of  its
 submission,  or grant the chief enforcement counsel's request, the chief
 enforcement counsel shall be so empowered to act  pursuant  to  subdivi-
 sions five and six of section 3-102 of this title.
  §  3.  Within thirty days of the effective date of this act, the state
 board of elections shall issue any rules and regulations  necessary  for
 the implementation of this act.
  § 4.  This act shall take effect immediately.
