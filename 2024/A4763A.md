 ment on such website for a period not to exceed  five  years  after  the
 expiration  of  such person's sentence of imprisonment and any period of
 parole or post-release supervision arising from the most recent  commit-
 ment to the department; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, THAT ANY SUCH WEBSITE
 THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO SEARCH FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION
 SHALL  BE  PROGRAMMED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE SEARCH MAY BE SUCCESSFUL
