  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 20, 2024, as World Refugee Day in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days which are set aside to increase awareness of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of the State of New York and the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored  traditions,  it  is the intent of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Thursday, June  20,  2024,
as World Refugee Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States should honor refugees around the globe
and celebrate the strength and courage of people who have been forced to
flee their home countries to escape conflict or persecution due to their
race, religion, nationality,  political  opinion,  or  membership  to  a
particular social group; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are more than 100 million displaced people who have
been forced from their homes worldwide, more  than  any  other  time  in
recorded  history; this number includes over 31 million refugees and 4.4
million asylum seekers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Welcoming the oppressed and persecuted is a core  tenet  of
our  country,  as  well  as  this great Empire State, which is home to a
diverse population of refugees and immigrants who integrate and  quickly
become  self-sufficient  by  paying  taxes,  supporting  local commerce,
joining the workforce, and providing jobs; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States refugee resettlement program,  which  was
established  over  40  years  ago,  is  a  lifesaving  pillar  of global
humanitarian efforts, advancing  United  States  foreign  policy  goals,
strengthening  United  States national security, and supporting regional
stability; and
 
  WHEREAS, Resettlement to the United States is available for only the
most vulnerable refugees who undergo rigorous  security  vetting  and  a
medical screening process; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  continue  to be individuals and families in need of
refuge and the support of the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim June 20, 2024, as World
Refugee Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
