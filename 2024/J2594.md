BY: Senator ASHBY
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the
  Incorporation of the Village of Menands on  June  1,
  2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate the proud and distinguished  histories  of  the  communities
which comprise the essence of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and fully in accord with its
longstanding traditions, it is the intent of this  Legislative  Body  to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Incorporation of the Village of
Menands; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Village  of  Menands was incorporated after a special
election was held in the Old Menands Hall on Lyons Avenue on August  15,
1924;  rumor  has  it  that  the City of Albany was looking to annex the
lands of Menands  since  the  area  was  rich  in  industry,  recreation
facilities  and fine homes; the residents of the village voted 167 to 47
for incorporation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The City of Albany and its surrounding area played a  vital
part  in  both  the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary
War; many troops would camp and march through areas which  would  become
part of Menands; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  the wars, one of the first major developments north
of  Albany  and  through  what  would  later  become  Menands,  was  the
construction of the Erie Canal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  Governor  DeWitt Clinton strongly supported the
construction of the canal; the canal was completed in the  Menands  area
in  1823;  the Erie Canal would prove to be an important part of Menands
history; and
 
  WHEREAS, The construction of one of the area's first railroads to be
built north of Albany would  be  the  next  major  project;  the  Albany
Northern  Railroad  was  incorporated  on  February  20,  1851,  and was
intended  to  run  from  Albany  through  the  town  on  Watervliet  and
eventually  connect  with  the  Rutland  Railroad at Eagle Bridge; after
several delays, the railroad was completed in 1856; and
 
  WHEREAS, Menands takes  its  name  from  one  of  the  area's  early
residents,  Louis  Menand;  Louis  Menand was born on August 2, 1807, in
Burgundy, France; when he was quite young,  he  formed  a  love  growing
things  and  turned  to that avocation for a livelihood; he reached that
ambition when he was employed at the Botanical Gardens in Paris; and
 
  WHEREAS, Being an ambitious man, Louis Menand was anxious to improve
his stature and in 1841 he left France for America; in 1842, he and  his
wife  traveled  to the Albany area where they rented a plot of ground at
the site of the Home for Aged Men (now the Center  Manor,  part  of  the
Center  for  the  Disabled);  he  specialized  in  growing  orchids  and
decorative plants; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  By the time Louis Menand came to this area, the Erie Canal
was in full swing, the Watervliet Turnpike was still nearly  brand  new;
Louis  Menand  continued  to  gain notice in the communities surrounding
Albany; the many people who traveled the turnpike would make it a  point
to visit what would become known as "Menands Gardens"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Louis  Menand's  business  would  continue  to grow as the
population of Albany and the surrounding area  grew;  a  large  railroad
station would eventually be built at the crossing where his gardens were
planted;  this  would later become known as the Menands stop, or Menands
Station; and
 
  WHEREAS, As Albany began to expand, and the  area  of  the  Town  of
Colonie  still largely farmland, it was natural for business enterprises
to look toward the Menands area to estab-lish themselves; after all, the
area had four major methods of transportation by the mid-19th century  -
The  Hudson  River,  the  Erie  Canal,  the Watervliet Turnpike, and the
Albany Northern  Railroad  which  were  all  well-established  means  of
transporting people and goods throughout the region; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Some  of  the early businesses located in the Menands area
were the  Albany  Felt  Company,  a  producer  of  paper  makers  felts,
established  in  1895  and  eventually grew to international proportions
with  their  world  headquarters  located  here  in  Menands;  Albany
International  and  the  Albany  Felt  Company  are probably the longest
continuously operating companies in Menands today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many other businesses would  locate  along  the  Watervliet
Turnpike  in  the  late  part  of  the  19th  and early part of the 20th
Centuries; these would include the:  Crane  Co.,  Albany  Steel,  Ramsey
Chain,  Simmons  Machine,  Morgan  Linen  Company, Albany Car Wheel Co.,
Taylor Electric Truck Co., Williams Press, International Harvester, J.B.
Lyon Printers, Boyertown Casket Co., Hawkins Baseball  Stadium  and  Mid
City  Park; of these, Simmons Machine, Morgan Linen and Albany Steel are
still in business here in Menands; and
 
  WHEREAS, Built in an art deco style popular in the 1920s, Montgomery
Wards chose Menands because of its location between Albany and Troy; the
ease of bringing customers to the store by means of  the  trolley  route
and paved road, currently Broadway; and the direct access to the railway
were definite pluses; and
 
  WHEREAS, Another major addition to the business community in Menands
was  the  construction  of  the  Capital District Regional Market in the
mid-1930s; as the areas surrounding the cities of Albany and  Troy  were
still  largely rural in the early to mid-1900s, the farming industry was
as important as heavy industry; and
 
  WHEREAS, The regional market was formed so that local farmers had  a
large  and  spacious  area  in  which to sell their produce; the Capital
District Regional Market also had a rail spur to the Delaware and Hudson
Railway which brought in produce from all parts of  the  country;  fresh
produce was even flown into the market by small airplanes; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the years Menands has boasted many firsts in the
capital  area; Menands was one of the first to have a horse racing track
 
(Island Park Association formed in the 1860s);  a  second  horse  racing
track was located near present day Rt. 378 and Broadway; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A town of quiescent, yet noble history, a region of scenic
natural beauty, the Village of Menands today stands  as  impressive  and
promising as it undoubtedly appeared in the eyes of its Native Americans
and early settlers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Incorporation of the Village of
Menands on June 1, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitable  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Village of Menands.
