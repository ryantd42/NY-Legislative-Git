  HONORING  Stephen  Lindridge  upon the occasion of
  his designation  as  recipient  of  the  President's
  Volunteer  Service  Silver  Award by the President's
  Council on Service and Civic Participation
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time, this  Legislative  Body  takes  note  of
certain  extraordinary  individuals  it  wishes  to  recognize for their
valued contributions to the success and progress of society and publicly
acknowledge their endeavors which have enhanced the basic humanity among
us all; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is  justly  proud  to  honor  Stephen
Lindridge,  the  Technology  Chairperson  and  Manufacturing  CTE Course
Instructor at Candor High School, upon the occasion of  his  designation
as  recipient  of  the President's Volunteer Service Silver Award by the
President's Council on Service and Civic Participation; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2003, the  President's  Council  on  Service  and  Civic
Participation  founded  the  President's  Volunteer  Service  Award  to
recognize the important role of volunteers  in  America's  strength  and
national  identity;  this  award  honors  individuals  whose  service
positively impacts  communities  in  every  corner  of  the  nation  and
inspires those around them to take action; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the course of the school year, a group of 39 students,
with  the  assistance  of  Mr. Lindridge, have been engaged in machining
parts  for  prosthetic  legs  with  the  guidance  of  Life  Changer
Manufacturing and SKY (Skilled Knowledgeable Youth) program; SKY aims to
expose  youth to STEM projects that will enhance their abilities through
challenging projects that interest them in engineering and skilled trade
jobs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mr. Lindridge decided to become involved with Brian  Copes'
program, who teaches at Chickasaw High School in Mobile, Alabama and has
been  working  on  prosthetic leg designs for the past 12 years with his
students;  Candor  students  developed  a  mass-production  model  to
streamline  the  creation of 206 ankle and knee joints and 24 adjustable
shin bones, which will ultimately help amputees in developing countries;
and
 
  WHEREAS, With the leadership of  Mr.  Lindridge,  students  involved
with  the project have interfaced with other students across the country
to solve manufacturing issues, work with Solidworks to solidify designs,
use Mastercam to program CNC machines and operate machine  tools;  also,
several  of the students have been invited to join him and Brian Cope to
fly to Latin America and fit the legs to the recipients; and
 
  WHEREAS, Stephen Lindridge was selected as one of six finalists  for
the 2021 Harbor Freight Tools for Schools Prize for Teaching Excellence,
which  honors excellent teaching in skilled trades; he also has received
recognition for his projects and instruction with WETM Golden  Apple  in
2011,  the  2013  NYS  Tech and Engineering Educators Association Region
Teacher of the Year, the 2015 NYSTEEA State Teacher of the Year, and the
 
2016 International  Technology  and  Engineering  Educators  Association
Teacher of Excellence Award; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their
profession,  certainly  have  earned the recognition and applause of all
the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Stephen  Lindridge  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient of the President's  Volunteer  Service  Silver  Award  by  the
President's  Council  on  Service  and  Civic  Participation;  and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Stephen Lindridge.
