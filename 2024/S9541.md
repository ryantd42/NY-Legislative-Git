  In  case  the  governor-elect shall decline to serve or shall die, the
 lieutenant-governor-elect shall become governor for the full term.
  In case the governor is impeached[, is absent from the  state]  or  is
 otherwise  unable  to  discharge  the powers and duties of the office of
 governor, the  lieutenant-governor  shall  act  as  governor  until  the
 inability shall cease or until the term of the governor shall expire.
  In  case  of  the  failure  of  the governor-elect to take the oath of
 office at the commencement of [his or her] SUCH  GOVERNOR-ELECT'S  term,
 the  lieutenant-governor-elect  shall act as governor until the governor

  THE LEGISLATURE MAY BY LAW PROVIDE  FOR  THE  CASE  WHEREIN  BOTH  THE
 GOVERNOR-ELECT AND THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR-ELECT SHALL DECLINE TO SERVE,
 DIE,  BE  INELIGIBLE FOR OFFICE, OR OTHERWISE BE UNABLE TO TAKE THE OATH

  In case of vacancy in the offices of both governor and lieutenant-gov-
 ernor,  a  governor  and  lieutenant-governor  shall  be elected for the
 remainder of the term at the next general election  happening  not  less

  In case of vacancy in the offices of both governor and lieutenant-gov-

 governor,  the  temporary  president of the senate shall act as governor
 until the EARLIER OF THE CESSATION OF THE VACANCY  OR  inability  [shall
 cease]  OF  THE  GOVERNOR OR LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR or until a NEW governor
 shall be elected.
  [In case of vacancy in the office of lieutenant-governor alone, or  if
 the  lieutenant-governor  shall  be  impeached, absent from the state or
 otherwise unable to discharge the duties of office, the temporary presi-
 dent of the senate shall perform all the duties  of  lieutenant-governor
 during such vacancy or inability.]
  If,  when  the  duty of acting as governor devolves upon the temporary
 president of the senate, there be a vacancy in such office or the tempo-

 wise]  unable to discharge the POWERS AND duties of THE OFFICE OF gover-
 nor, the speaker of the assembly shall act  as  governor  [during  such]

 THE ASSEMBLY POSITION UNTIL THAT PERSON IS NO LONGER ACTING AS GOVERNOR.
 HOWEVER,  IF THE TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE OR THE SPEAKER OF THE
 ASSEMBLY ACTS AS GOVERNOR BEYOND SIXTY CONSECUTIVE  DAYS,  THAT  OFFICER
 SHALL  THEN BE REQUIRED TO VACATE THAT OFFICER'S SEAT IN THE LEGISLATURE
 AND THE TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE OR  SPEAKER  OF  THE  ASSEMBLY
 POSITION,  AND  SUCH VACANCY SHALL NOT RENDER THAT OFFICER INELIGIBLE TO
 CONTINUE TO ACT AS GOVERNOR. THE TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF  THE  SENATE  OR

 exercise  [his  or her] SUCH OFFICER'S office after articles of impeach-
 ment against [him or her] SUCH OFFICER shall have been preferred to  the
 senate,  until  [he  or  she]  SUCH  OFFICER  shall have been acquitted.

 an  oath  or  affirmation  truly  and impartially to try the impeachment
 according to the evidence, and no person shall be convicted without  the
