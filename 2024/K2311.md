  HONORING  Rose Isabel Baral Brown posthumously for
  a lifetime of dedicated  service  to  the  field  of
  reproductive healthcare and rights
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
citizens  of  the  State  of  New York whose lifework and civic endeavor
served to enhance the quality of life in their communities and the great
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Rose Isabel Baral Brown posthumously for a lifetime of dedicated service
to the field of reproductive healthcare and rights; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rose Isabel Baral Brown grew up in the Bronx, New York, and
attended  The  High  School  of  Music  and  Art in New York City before
attending Harpur College,  now  known  as  SUNY  Binghamton,  where  she
graduated  with  a  bachelor's degree in 1963; she later enrolled in the
Master of Social Work program at Adelphi University in the early  1970s;
and
 
  WHEREAS, After earning her Master of Social Work degree, Rose Isabel
Baral  Brown  began  her  lifework  in  safeguarding  women's  rights,
particularly  women's  reproductive  rights;  she  began  this  lifelong
journey  with  her  serving  as Executive Director of Planned Parenthood
Nassau  County  where  she  hired  the  affiliate's  first  director  of
development,  thereby  greatly  expanding  the  affiliate's  financial
resources and its services while also creating a highly successful  Teen
Education  Program,  the  sponsor  of  an  annual Teen Health Conference
attended by scores  of  young  people,  including  pregnant  teens,  who
received the kind of education and support many could not get at home or
at  school  at  a  time  when  teen  pregnancy  rates  in  the area were
escalating; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rose Isabel Baral Brown later became the Executive Director
of Planned Parenthood Suffolk County, a larger affiliate  with  a  wider
reach, where she established the County's only outpatient, Comprehensive
Reproductive  Health  Care  Center that included surgical abortions, and
which, for the first time in the county, provided abortions to women  on
Medicaid  who  were  living  at or near the poverty level whose need for
abortion services had long been completely ignored; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rose Isabel Baral Brown provided a  regional  and  national
model  for other Planned Parenthood affiliates by establishing exemplary
advocacy and education programs for young  people,  including  garnering
national  recognition  for the creation of a Teen Theater; pioneering an
annual fundraising event on the East End of Suffolk County; and  working
to  address  the  emerging  AIDS crisis, especially the special needs of
women and children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  mid-1990s,  Rose  became  instrumental  in  the
years-long process of creating a strong new Planned Parenthood affiliate
in  New York State--Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, the result of the
 
merger  between  Planned  Parenthood  of  Suffolk  County  and  Planned
Parenthood  of Westchester and Rockland, which was certified by New York
State in 1997; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As Executive Vice President of the newly developed Planned
Parenthood Hudson Peconic from 1997-2001, Rose Isabel Baral Brown helped
steer this second-largest Planned Parenthood to success; her  leadership
helped  in  providing  a  host of reproductive health services through a
network  of  16  medical  centers,  creating  a  newly  formed  Planned
Parenthood  Hudson  Peconic Action Fund for statewide social welfare and
legislative issues that impact Planned Parenthood's patients as well  as
Planned  Parenthood's  ability to provide care, as well as participation
in the initial university-led medical trial of medication abortion; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rose Isabel  Baral  Brown  helped  to  define,  strengthen,
defend, and extend the reach of reproductive health services in New York
State  and  the  nation;  she  has  stood up countless time, in numerous
venues, many hostile, to advocate for women's  reproductive  rights  and
for  the  support of Planned Parenthood in New York State and throughout
the country, and assumed leadership of  critical  bodies,  such  as  the
Planned Parenthood National Executive Directors Council; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  retirement, Rose Isabel Baral Brown devoted herself
to helping guide Catskill area organizations, serving on the  boards  of
the  local NPR affiliate and the local library, as well as spending time
with her beloved family and friends; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rose Isabel Baral Brown died at the age of 80 on Wednesday,
June 7, 2023;  infinite  selflessness  and  benevolence  will  shine  on
through  her family's vivid and happy memories; her insight and strength
will forever serve as a beacon of love, light, and hope to the countless
lives she touched; and
 
  WHEREAS, Her valued support system throughout her life had been  her
husband,  Lester  Mattis;  cherished  daughter,  Chloe;  son-in-law, Hal
Friedlander; adored grandson, August; and the many friends,  colleagues,
and  associates  who  cherished  Rose Isabel Baral Brown's wise counsel,
support,  and  love  through  the  years,  and  rejoice  in  her  many
achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Her passion, courage, and unwavering commitment to justice
will continue to inspire the individuals with whom she worked  for  many
years  to come; her legacy of boundless compassion and her inspirational
spirit are worthy of the highest praise from the citizens of this  State
and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Armed  with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a sense of
compassion, Rose Isabel Baral Brown leaves behind a  legacy  which  will
long  endure  the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory
to all she served and befriended; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Rose  Isabel Baral Brown posthumously for a lifetime of dedicated
service to the field of reproductive healthcare and rights;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Rose Isabel Baral Brown.
