  on March 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their
profession,  certainly  have  earned the recognition and applause of all
the citizens of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Scott  Wenzel  upon  the  occasion  of  his  special designation for his
exemplary service to his community and State by Pace University,  to  be
celebrated  on  Thursday,  March  14, 2024, at the 29th Annual Elisabeth
Haub School of Law Leadership Award Dinner at  the  Westchester  Country
Club in Rye, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Law Leadership Dinner is the signature fundraiser for
the Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University and a celebration to
honor  individuals  or  organizations  that  have  made  outstanding
contributions  to  the legal community, the Law School, and the practice
of Law; and
 
  WHEREAS, Formerly a professional cyclist on the Geox-Fuji Test  Team
based in Belgium, Scott Wenzel connects to his competitive spirit in the
practice  of  law, advocating for clients in the New York and New Jersey
state and federal courts, private arbitrations, and mediations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Drawing from his experience as a federal law clerk  and  Am
Law  100 associate, Scott Wenzel combines a keen analytical mind, an eye
for factual detail, and a powerful pen to create work product that makes
complex arguments clear and persuasive to judges and clients alike; and
 
  WHEREAS, Scott Wenzel is  particularly  adept  at  unearthing  novel
defenses  and  procedural  mechanisms  that opposing counsel often miss,
which can help resolve cases quickly and save clients  time  and  money;
clients  also  appreciate  Scott's responsiveness and his sensitivity to
finding resolutions that align with their business objectives; and
 
  WHEREAS, While a student at Pace Haub Law, Scott  Wenzel  served  as
Managing  Editor  of  the  Pace Environmental Law Review, was a teaching
assistant to Professor Emily Gold Waldman and a  research  assistant  to
Professor  Leslie Y. Garfield Tenzer; he also interned for the Honorable
Patty Schwartz of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Third  Circuit  and
the  Honorable  Cathy Seibel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
