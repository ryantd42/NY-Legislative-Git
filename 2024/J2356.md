  COMMEMORATING  the  100th Anniversary of the Delta
  Lake Bible Conference Center of Rome, New York
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social, and
educational benefits they confer, play a vital role in  the  development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the tradition of this State and this Nation to pay
tribute to those institutions and individuals who  have  contributed  to
the ethical and spiritual values of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body is justly proud to commemorate the
100th Anniversary of the Delta Lake Bible Conference Center of Rome, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr. A.  B.  Simpson,  the  founder  of  the  Christian  and
Missionary  Alliance,  began  a yearly Convention of people whose hearts
desired deeper Biblical study and supported his missions worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1923,  the  CMA  District  Superintendent,  Reverend  G.
Verner  Brown,  was  informed  of  a  grove  north  of  Rome,  New York,
overlooking Delta Lake; other interested parties offered more money, but
the farmer believed it should be used for a Godly purpose; and
 
  WHEREAS, When the Conventions began at Delta  Lake,  there  were  no
buildings on the property, just tents for sleeping, eating, and praying;
through  World War II, Conventions were held even through the expense of
wartime gas rationing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  the  war,  the  leadership  developed  youth
ministries  with  more  than  one  thousand teens and children attending
summer camp in 1970; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1971, Reverend William Moon, who served  as  an  aid  to
students  with  disabilities,  developed a camp for persons with special
needs; that emphasis became a new focused outreach as  his  Haven  Camps
developed over the following years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  these  changes,  ministries  touch hearts, and
building lives continues unabated; since its inception, the expansion of
Delta's programming, guest groups, and side businesses has expanded  its
purpose; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  its  current  programs include: Youth Camps,
Family Camp, Haven Camps, Teen Chill, Night to Shine, and Delta Men; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the  Delta  Lake  Bible  Conference  Center  is  a
year-round  ministry  which continues to embrace the purpose and mission
for which it was created 100 years ago, "Welcoming Guests  to  Encounter
Jesus Christ!"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  past 100 years, the Delta Lake Bible Conference
Center has made an indelible impact on the Rome community; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Delta  Lake  Bible  Conference  Center  stands on the
threshold of tomorrow, prepared to meet the  challenges  of  the  coming
decades  while  retaining that spiritual resolve which characterizes its
past; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to take  note  of
enduring  religious  institutions  and to bring such institutions to the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of the Delta Lake Bible Conference
Center of Rome,  New  York,  fully  confident  that  this  commemoration
reflects  the  belief  in  those  values  which  enhance the dignity and
purpose of life; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Delta Lake Bible Conference Center of Rome, New York.
