  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2024, as Caribbean Heritage Month in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored  traditions,  it  is the intent of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June  2024,  as  Caribbean
Heritage  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
observance of National Caribbean Heritage Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Caribbean Heritage Month commemoration was adopted  by  the
United  States  House  of  Representatives  in  2005,  to  recognize the
significance of Caribbean people and their descendants  in  the  history
and culture of the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  resolution passed the Senate in February of 2006, and
President George H.W. Bush issued the proclamation in June of  the  same
year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the declaration, the White House has issued an annual
proclamation recognizing June as Caribbean-American Heritage Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, The commemoration of Caribbean-American Heritage Month aims
to  remind Americans that our greatness lies in our diversity; Caribbean
immigrants from founding  father,  Alexander  Hamilton,  to  journalist,
Malcolm Gladwell, have helped to shape the American dream; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the practice of this Legislative Body to recognize
those important months which remind us of the rich and diverse  heritage
of our great State and Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June  2024,  as  Caribbean
Heritage Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
