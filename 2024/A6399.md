  1. Upon [the] conviction of a defendant for the offense of  murder  in
 the  first  degree as defined by SUBPARAGRAPH (I), (II), (II-A) OR (III)
 OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF section 125.27 of the penal  law,
 the  court  shall  promptly  conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to
 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death or  to  life
 imprisonment  without  parole  pursuant  to  subdivision five of section
 70.00 of the penal law. Nothing in  this  section  shall  be  deemed  to
 preclude  the people at any time from determining that the death penalty
 shall not be sought in a particular case, in  which  case  the  separate
 sentencing  proceeding shall not be conducted and the court may sentence
 such defendant to life imprisonment without parole [or to a sentence  of
 imprisonment  for  the  class  A-I  felony of murder in the first degree
 other than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole].
  10. (A) At the conclusion of all the  evidence,  the  people  and  the
 defendant  may present argument in summation for or against the sentence
 sought by the people. The people may deliver the first summation and the
 defendant may then deliver the last  summation.  Thereafter,  the  court
 shall  deliver  a  charge  to the jury on any matters appropriate in the
 circumstances. In its charge, the court must instruct the jury that with
 respect to each count of murder in  the  first  degree,  AS  DEFINED  IN
 SUBPARAGRAPH  (I), (II), (II-A) OR (III) OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION
 ONE OF SECTION 125.27 OF THE PENAL LAW, the jury should consider whether
 or not a sentence of death should  be  imposed  and  whether  or  not  a
 sentence  of  life  imprisonment  without parole should be imposed[, and
 that the jury must be unanimous with respect  to  either  sentence.  The
 court  must  also  instruct the jury that in the event the jury fails to
 reach unanimous agreement with respect to the sentence, the  court  will
 sentence  the defendant to a term of imprisonment with a minimum term of
 A. 6399  4

 between twenty and twenty-five years and a maximum term of life. Follow-
 ing the court's charge, the jury shall retire to consider  the  sentence
 to  be imposed. Unless inconsistent with the provisions of this section,
 the  provisions  of  sections 310.10, 310.20 and 310.30 shall govern the
 deliberations of the jury].
  (B) THE COURT MUST INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT THE JURY MUST  BE  UNANIMOUS
 WITH RESPECT TO THE SENTENCE TO BE IMPOSED. THE COURT MUST ALSO INSTRUCT
 THE  JURY  THAT IN THE EVENT THE JURY FAILS TO REACH UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT
 WITH RESPECT TO THE SENTENCE, THE COURT WILL SENTENCE THE DEFENDANT TO A
 TERM OF LIFE IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT PAROLE.
  (C) FOLLOWING THE COURT'S CHARGE, THE JURY SHALL  RETIRE  TO  CONSIDER
 THE  SENTENCE  TO BE IMPOSED. UNLESS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
 THIS SECTION, THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 310.10, 310.20  AND  310.30  OF
 THIS PART SHALL GOVERN THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE JURY.
  §  5.  This  act  shall  take  effect  immediately  and shall apply to
 offenses committed on or after such date.
