  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  is  one  of the fastest growing cancer
diagnoses in the United States; in 2023, roughly 21,560  new  esophageal
cancer  cases  were  diagnosed  (17,030  in men and 4,530 in women), and
16,120 people died from esophageal cancer (12,920 in men  and  3,200  in
women); and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal cancer kills one American every 36 minutes each
and every day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer is among the deadliest of  cancers,  with
fewer than one in five patients surviving five years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  has  low  survival rates because it is
usually discovered at advanced stages when treatment outcomes are  poor;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer in the United States is most often caused
by  persistent  heartburn or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), yet
many who are at risk are  unaware  of  the  potential  danger  GERD  can
present when it occurs over several weeks or months; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  can  be  a silent killer with patients
often unaware that the cough, hoarse voice, sore throat  or  chest  pain
they  suffer  can  be signs of GERD and are reasons to discuss screening
for esophageal cancer with their health care professional; and
 
  WHEREAS, Esophageal cancer can develop from GERD  when  fluids  from
the  stomach  splash  up  to  create  cellular  change  in the esophagus
resulting in a precancerous condition known as Barrett's Esophagus which
can lead to a 125-fold  increase  in  a  patient's  risk  of  developing
esophageal cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal cancer can be prevented through early detection
of its precursor, Barrett's Esophagus, which can be  treated  with  new,
curative outpatient techniques; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  Cancer  Action  Network  (ECAN)  is working to
improve public awareness of the link between heartburn  and  cancer  and
supports progress in early detection and treatment of esophageal cancer;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Esophageal  cancer  awareness,  along with improvements in
prevention, early detection and treatment strategies, will  enhance  the
health and well-being of all Americans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024, as  Esophageal
Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
