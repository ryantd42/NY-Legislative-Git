  (b)  The  term  "disabled veteran" means a veteran who is certified by
 the United States veterans' administration or a military  department  as
 entitled  to  receive disability payments upon the certification of such

 bility exists to an extent of ten per centum  or  more,  notwithstanding
 the fact that such veteran has not been examined by a medical officer of
 such  veterans'  administration  within  one  year of either the time of
 application for appointment or promotion or the date of filing  applica-
 tion  for competitive examination for original appointment or promotion,
 or within one year of the time of retention, as the case may be.
