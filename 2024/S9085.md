 AN ACT authorizing the county of Nassau assessor to accept  an  applica-
  tion  for  a  real  property tax exemption from the Korean Evangelical
  Church
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the  Korean  Evangelical  Church  an application for exemption from real
 property taxes pursuant to section 462 of the real property tax law  for
 the 2022-2023 assessment rolls for all of the 2022-2023 school taxes and
 all  of  the 2022 and 2023 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such
 organization located at 42 Belmont Circle, hamlet of  Syosset,  town  of
 Oyster Bay, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county parcel ID
 section  15  block  113  lot  1.  If  accepted, the application shall be
 reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxable status date
 established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  County  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
