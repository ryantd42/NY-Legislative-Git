  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 21- 27, 2024, as Enrolled Agent Week in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 21-27, 2024, as Enrolled Agent
Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Enrolled Agent profession  dates  back  to  1884  when,
after  questionable  claims  had  been  presented  for Civil War losses,
Congress acted to regulate persons who  represented  citizens  in  their
dealings with the U.S. Treasury Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Enrolled Agents have been important assets to both the
New York taxpayers and the New York State  Department  of  Taxation  and
Finance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Enrolled Agents assist taxpayers with a variety of federal
and state taxation issues from the annual filing of their tax return  to
more  complex  issues of audits, liens, levies, appeals and collections;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative  Body  particularly  wishes  to  recognize
Enrolled  Agents  for  their  knowledge, professionalism, and integrity;
this professionalism and expertise makes Enrolled Agents, "America's Tax
Experts"; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim January 21-27, 2024, as
Enrolled Agents Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
