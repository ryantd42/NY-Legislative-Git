  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  vehicle  and  traffic law is amended by adding a new
 section 404-ff to read as follows:
  § 404-FF. DISTINCTIVE PLATES FOR COMBAT VETERANS. 1. ANY COMBAT VETER-
 AN HAVING SERVED IN THE NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AIR FORCE OR COAST GUARD, OR
 THE SPOUSE OF ANY SUCH VETERAN SHALL, UPON REQUEST, BE ISSUED A  LICENSE
 PLATE  BEARING THE WORDS "AIR FORCE COMBAT VETERAN", "NAVY COMBAT VETER-
 AN", "MARINE COMBAT VETERAN" OR  "COAST  GUARD  COMBAT  VETERAN".  IF  A
 DISTINCTIVE  PLATE IS ISSUED TO A VETERAN PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, SUCH
 A DISTINCTIVE PLATE SHALL NOT BE ISSUED TO THE SPOUSE OF  SUCH  VETERAN.
 APPLICATION  FOR SAID LICENSE PLATE SHALL BE FILED WITH THE COMMISSIONER
 IN SUCH FORM AND DETAIL AS THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PRESCRIBE.
  2. THE DISTINCTIVE PLATE AUTHORIZED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL BE ISSUED UPON PROOF, SATISFACTORY TO THE COMMISSIONER,  THAT  THE
 APPLICANT  OR  THE  SPOUSE  OF  THE APPLICANT IS A COMBAT VETERAN HAVING
 SERVED IN THE NAVY, MARINE CORPS, AIR FORCE OR COAST GUARD.  THE  BRANCH
 OF  MILITARY  SERVICE ON THE LICENSE PLATE SHALL MATCH THE BRANCH LISTED
 IN THE PROOF OF COMBAT PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION.
  3. A DISTINCTIVE PLATE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE ISSUED
 IN THE SAME MANNER AS OTHER NUMBER PLATES UPON PAYMENT  OF  THE  REGULAR
 REGISTRATION  FEE PRESCRIBED BY SECTION FOUR HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT AN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME  SERVICE  CHARGE  OF  TEN
 DOLLARS SHALL BE CHARGED FOR SUCH PLATE.
  4.  NOTHING  CONTAINED  HEREIN SHALL REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF A SPECIAL
 NUMBER PLATE UNDER THIS SECTION UNLESS  THE  COMMISSIONER  IS  SATISFIED

 THAT  THE  AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGES COLLECTED PURSUANT
 TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO  RECOVER  THE
 COSTS OF THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF SUCH SPECIAL PLATES.
  §  2. 1. A distinctive plate established pursuant to section 404-ff of
 the vehicle and traffic law, as added by section one of this act,  shall
 only  be  designed, produced and issued upon the delivery to the depart-
 ment of motor vehicles of a surety bond in the amount  of  six  thousand
 dollars,  which  shall be executed by a surety company authorized by the
 department of financial services to transact  business  in  this  state.
 Provided, however, that if the commissioner of motor vehicles shall have
 received  prior  to  plate  design, production and issuance at least two
 hundred orders for such distinctive plate together with  the  additional
 annual  service  charge  applicable  to  each such order, which shall be
 non-refundable, no such surety  bond  shall  be  required.  All  service
 charges  collected  pursuant to this section shall be deposited pursuant
 to the provisions of section 404-oo of the vehicle and  traffic  law  to
 the  credit of the department of motor vehicles distinctive plate devel-
 opment fund established by section 95-g of the  state  finance  law  and
 shall  be  used for the design, production, advertising and distribution
 of distinctive license plates in accordance with such section 95-g.
  2. If, upon the expiration of two years following the date upon  which
 distinctive  plates  in  the  series  are  first  available for sale two
 hundred or more sets of such plates are sold, a bond delivered  pursuant
 to this section shall be discontinued. If fewer than two hundred sets of
 such  plates  are  sold  by  such time, the department of motor vehicles
 shall be entitled to recover against the bond in an amount proportionate
 to such shortfall.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that
 section  one  of this act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth
 day after it shall have become a law. Effective immediately,  the  addi-
 tion,  amendment  and/or  repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for
 the implementation of this act on its effective date are authorized  and
 directed to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
