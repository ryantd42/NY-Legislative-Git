 S. 5085--C  2
 
 THE  RETAIL  LABOR  TIME GUIDE REASONABLY UTILIZED BY A FRANCHISED MOTOR
 VEHICLE DEALER FOR NON-WARRANTY  CUSTOMER  PAID  LABOR  OPERATIONS.  All
 warranty claims and/or claims under a franchisor's service contract made
 by  franchised  motor  vehicle  dealers shall be paid within thirty days
 following their approval. For DIAGNOSIS WORK, parts reimbursement, other
 than components, systems, fixtures, appliances, furnishings, accessories
 and features of a house coach that are  designed,  used  and  maintained
 primarily  for  nonvehicular  residential  purposes,  and  for  labor
 reimbursement, reasonable compensation shall not be less than the  price
 and  rate  charged  by  the  franchised  motor  vehicle  dealer for like
 services to non-warranty and/or non-service  contract  customers.  For
 purposes  of  this section, the price and rate charged by the franchised
 motor vehicle dealer for parts may be established by submitting  to  the
 franchisor  one  hundred  sequential  nonwarranty  customer-paid service
 repair orders or the  number  of  sequential  nonwarranty  customer-paid
 service  repair  orders written within a ninety day period, whichever is
 less, covering repairs made no more than one hundred eighty days  before
 the  submission,  and  declaring  the  price and rate, including average
 markup for the franchised motor  vehicle  dealer  as  its  reimbursement
 rate.  The  reimbursement  rate  so declared shall go into effect thirty
 days following the declaration and shall be presumed to  be  reasonable,
 however  a  franchisor  may  rebut such presumption by showing that such
 rate so established is unreasonable in light of  the  practices  of  all
 other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the vicinity offering the same
 line  make.  The  franchised  motor  vehicle  dealer shall not request a
 change in the reimbursement rate more often than once in  each  calendar
 year. In establishing the labor reimbursement rate, the franchisor shall
 not  require a franchised motor vehicle dealer to establish said rate by
 a methodology, or by requiring information, that is unduly burdensome or
 time consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, a  transaction
 by  transaction  calculation.  For  the  purposes  of  this section, the
 following parts or types of repairs shall be  excluded  from  the  parts
 and/or  labor  calculations  and the franchisor's reimbursement require-
 ments under this section: (a) parts sold at wholesale;  (b)  tires;  (c)
 routine  maintenance not covered under any retail customer warranty such
 as fluids, filters and belts not provided in the course of repairs;  (d)
 vehicle  reconditioning; and (e) batteries replaced as part of a routine
 maintenance operation. If the  franchisor  rejects  the  declaration  or
 attempts  to  rebut  the declaration because of an error in the dealer's
 submission, the franchisor shall identify with  specificity  the  reason
 for rejection and identify the error or errors within the submission. In
 the event the franchisor rejects or rebuts the dealer's initial declara-
 tion, the dealer shall have the opportunity, within sixty days to resub-
 mit  the  full and corrected declaration addressing the alleged error or
 errors identified by the franchisor. The franchisor shall respond within
 sixty days. The one hundred eighty day requirement for the repair orders
 shall be stayed from the date of initial submission. In  any  action  or
 proceeding  held pursuant to this subdivision, the franchisor shall have
 the burden of proving that the rate declared by the dealer was unreason-
 able as described in this subdivision and that the  proposed  adjustment
 of  the  average  percentage  markup  or  rejection of the submission is
 reasonable pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.  A  WARRANTY
 CLAIM TIMELY MADE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED INVALID SOLELY BECAUSE UNAVAILABLE
 PARTS CAUSE ADDITIONAL USE AND MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
