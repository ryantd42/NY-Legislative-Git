  COMMENDING  Global  Kids  upon  the  occasion  of
  hosting its 3rd Annual Teen Battle Chef Challenge on
  June 6, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
organizations and individuals who devote themselves to  the  welfare  of
the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Global  Kids  upon  the occasion of hosting its 3rd Annual Teen
Battle Chef Challenge on  Thursday,  June  6,  2024,  at  730  Concourse
Village W, Bronx, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1989, Carole Artigiani, award-winning educator, founded
Global Kids to address the urgent need for young people,  especially  in
under-resourced  schools  and  neighborhoods,  to develop the knowledge,
skills, and values necessary to participate in  the  democratic  process
and  achieve  leadership  in  an  interdependent,  technologically
sophisticated global society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Incorporated  in  1991,  Global  Kids  is  a  nonprofit
organization  that  has  been  devoted  to  developing  and implementing
culturally  relevant,  anti-racist  youth  development,  and  academic
enrichment programs for over three decades; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Growing  from  humble beginnings, Global Kids has received
national recognition for exemplary practices in international education,
digital media programming, experiential learning, and youth development;
the organization has reached more than 100,000 young people through both
direct services and peer education activities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Launched in the  summer  of  2020,  Teen  Battle  Chef  was
developing  during Global Kid's Summer Rising Program and has been since
integrated as a club; the program is  DYCD-funded  through  after-school
programs  at  six  middle  schools  across  New  York City; through this
program, participants develop an appreciation for eating healthy and are
encouraged to explore new cultures and history through cuisine; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  its  distinguished  history,  Global  Kids  has
demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Global Kids is in direct correlation to  the
efforts  of  its  dedicated  leadership,  past  and  present, staff, and
volunteers, whose involvement is, and always has been, characterized  by
an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard  of  excellence  in all endeavors on behalf of the organization
and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, This auspicious occasion presents an opportunity  for  this
Legislative  Body  to  recognize  and pay tribute to Global Kids for the
organization's efforts  to  educate,  inspire,  and  mobilize  youth  to
succeed  in  school,  achieve  postsecondary success, and take action on
critical issues facing their communities and the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Global Kids upon the occasion of hosting  its  3rd  Annual  Teen
Battle Chef Challenge on June 6, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Global Kids.
