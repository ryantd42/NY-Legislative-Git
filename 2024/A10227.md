 court outside the city of New York may, as provided by  law,  be  origi-
 nated  therein:  actions  and  proceedings  for  the  recovery of money,
 actions and proceedings for the recovery of  chattels  and  actions  and

 recovery  of money, actions and proceedings for the recovery of chattels
 and actions and proceedings for the foreclosure of mechanics  liens  and
