 AN ACT authorizing the commissioner of transportation to conduct a study
  relating to airborne ultrafine particles
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Protect New York Airport Communities from Particle Emissions Act".
  § 2. 1. Definitions. a. For the purpose of  this  section,  "ultrafine
 particles"  "UFP"  and  "UFP's" shall mean particles with diameters less
 than or equal to 100 nanometers.
  2. Airborne ultrafine particle study. The commissioner of  transporta-
 tion  shall  conduct  a  study  relating to airborne ultrafine particles
 ("UFP's"). The scope of such study shall include:
  (a) summarizing the relevant literature and studies done  on  airborne
 UFP's worldwide;
  (b)  analyzing the impacts of certain large hub commercial airports on
 airborne UFP's, including, but not limited to:
  (i) John F. Kennedy International Airport;
  (ii) LaGuardia Airport;
  (iii) Buffalo Niagara International Airport;
  (iv) Syracuse Hancock International Airport;
  (v) Greater Rochester International Airport;
  (vi) Albany International Airport; and
  (vii) any other metropolitan  large  hub  airport  identified  by  the
 commissioner of transportation.
  (c) investigating the characteristics of airborne UFP's, including but
 not limited to:
  (i) the spatial and temporal distributions of UFP concentrations;
  (ii) the primary sources of UFP's;

  (iii) the extent to which aircraft and airport operations are contrib-
 uting  to  the distribution of UFP concentrations when compared to other
 sources;
  (iv)  the  potential health effects associated with elevated UFP expo-
 sure, including heart and lung diseases, asthma, nervous  system  disor-
 ders  and  other  health  effects  that have been considered in previous
 studies; and
  (v) the potential UFP exposure by susceptible and vulnerable groups.
  (d) identifying measures, including the use  of  sustainable  aviation
 fuels, intended to reduce emissions from aircraft and airport operations
 and to assess potential impacts on UFP-related emissions; and
  (e)  identifying  information  gaps  related  to  understanding  the
 relationships between UFP exposure and health effects, contributions  of
 aviation-related  emissions  to  UFP  exposure  and the effectiveness of
 mitigation measures.
  3. Coordination. The commissioner of transportation  shall  coordinate
 with the commissioner of environmental conservation, the commissioner of
 health  and  any  other  agency the commissioner of transportation deems
 appropriate to provide data and  other  assistance  necessary  for  such
 study.
  4.  Report. The commissioner shall submit a report including recommen-
 dations and findings based on this study to the governor, the  temporary
 president  of  the  senate and the speaker of the assembly no later than
 two years after the effective date of this act.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
