Senate Resolution No. 1839
 
BY: Senator SERRANO
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of the New
  York State Office of Parks, Recreation and  Historic
  Preservation
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those organizations which  are  dedicated  to  increasing
public  awareness  of,  and  appreciation for, the natural resources and
stewardship of New York, recognizing  the  role  all  citizens  have  in
protecting the environment and the quality of life in this Empire State;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the New York State Office of Parks,
Recreation and Historic Preservation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The very first publicly owned historic site in the Nation,
Washington's Headquarters, was acquired by and opened  in  New  York  in
1850,  and  35  years  later  in  1885,  Niagara  Falls  State  Park was
established, and is now the oldest state park in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, With great foresight and understanding  of  how  vital  the
protection  of  our  natural  world  is to furthering the enrichment and
health of the citizenry of this State and Nation, while also  preserving
the rich and complex history of New York, the State Council of Parks was
justly established in 1924; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  Council  of  Parks  provided the leadership to
create a statewide system of new parks for all New Yorkers which  served
as a foundation for what is now known as the Office of Parks, Recreation
and Historic Preservation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After 100 years of service, New York's system of parks and
historic sites is one of  the  State's  most  important  assets  and  is
operated  and  supported  by  dedicated  New  Yorkers  who  reflect  the
population and rich culture of New York; together, New York State Parks'
staff, volunteers, and benefactors work hard to offer new experiences to
New Yorkers and travelers from around the  world  while  continuing  the
mission  to  restore  and  revitalize  our  public  spaces  for  future
generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Starting with the earliest museum caretakers, many of  whom
lived  at  their  historic sites, opening these special locations to the
public has also meant creating a place for learning; each  year,  almost
200 swim instructors, environmental educators, and historic interpreters
bring  their passions to the public through lessons, programs, and tours
that inspire visitors with new skills and knowledge; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, with more than 250 properties  encompassing  360,000
acres  of  beaches,  campgrounds, trails, forests, and so much more, the
Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation remains  committed
to  protecting  and  promoting public access to the State's rich natural
resources; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Staff  and  support networks know that parks and protected
sites are economic drivers in their local  communities,  and  they  give
their  all  to provide world-class experiences for each visitor; in some
cases, this devotion to the park system has even been multigenerational,
and the people who support the Office of Parks, Recreation and  Historic
Preservation  may  be  able to credit their parents and grandparents who
earlier cared for these special places for their  current  passions  and
interest in perpetuating this important care; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the welfare of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched
and  reliably  served by the purposeful endeavors of organizations which
are committed to the preservation of our  natural  environment  and  the
enhancement  of  the  appreciation  of  the  distinctive features of our
surroundings, and to the economic well-being of the areas in which  they
exist; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the New York State Office of Parks,
Recreation and Historic Preservation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  various  members  of  the  State Council of Parks,
Recreation and Historic Preservation.
