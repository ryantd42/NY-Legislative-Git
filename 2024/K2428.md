  LEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION  memorializing  Governor
  Kathy Hochul to proclaim June  8,  2024  as  Belmont
  Stakes Day in the State of  New York, and commending
  the  New  York Racing  Association upon the occasion
  of the 156th running  of the Belmont Stakes
 
  WHEREAS, The Belmont Stakes is one of the  most  important  sporting
events  in New York State; it is the conclusion of thoroughbred racing's
prestigious three-contest Triple Crown; and
 
  WHEREAS, Preceded by the Kentucky Derby and  Preakness  Stakes,  the
Belmont  Stakes  is  nicknamed  the  "Test  of  the Champion" due to its
grueling mile and a half distance; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Triple Crown has only been completed 13 times;  the  13
horses  to  accomplish this historic feat are: Sir Barton, 1919; Gallant
Fox, 1930; Omaha, 1935; War Admiral, 1937; Whirlaway, 1941; Count Fleet,
1943; Assault, 1946; Citation, 1948; Secretariat,  1973;  Seattle  Slew,
1977; Affirmed, 1978; American Pharoah, 2015; and Justify, 2018; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Belmont Stakes has drawn some of the largest sporting
event crowds in New York history, including 120,139 people for the  2004
running of the race; and
 
  WHEREAS, This historic event draws tens of thousands of horse racing
fans  annually to Belmont Park and generates millions of dollars for New
York State's economy; and
 
  WHEREAS, This year, the Belmont Stakes will be held in  Saratoga  to
the redevelopment of Belmont Park, after a large investment by the state
of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Belmont  Stakes  is  shown  to  a national television
audience of millions of people on network television; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Belmont Stakes is  named  after  August  Belmont  I,  a
financier  who made a fortune in banking in the middle to late 1800s; he
also branched out into politics and New York society; and
 
  WHEREAS, The fourth oldest stakes race in North America, the Belmont
Stakes was first run in 1867 at Jerome Park for a purse of $1500; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1973, Secretariat  put  together  one  of  the  greatest
performances  in  sports  history  by  taking  the  Belmont Stakes by 31
lengths in stakes record time to complete the Triple Crown; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 2015 Triple Crown winner, American Pharoah, is the 12th
horse to win the Triple Crown, and the first to win the Triple Crown  in
37 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Justify  was  the first Triple Crown winner since American
Pharoah won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont  Stakes  in
2015; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Horse  racing  is  an integral part of New York as well as
American history; on May 5, 1905, Thomas Edison made one  of  the  first
recorded videos in history at the grand opening of Belmont Park; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is fitting and proper for this Legislative Body to take
note of such a prestigious sporting event which brings  great  pride  to
the  horse  racing  industry  as  well as all the citizens of this great
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is, in addition, of utmost importance to honor the sport
of horse racing in New York State on its biggest day; now, therefore, be
It
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 8, 2024, as Belmont
Stakes Day in the State of New York, and to commend the New York  Racing
Association  upon  the  occasion  of  the  156th  running of the Belmont
Stakes; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York, and to the New York Racing Association.
