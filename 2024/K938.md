BY: M. of A. Brook-Krasny
 
  HONORING  members  of  the American Association of
  Invalids and Veterans of  World  War  II  for  their
  dedicated military service
 
  WHEREAS,  Members of Armed Services and those American allied forces
who have served so valiantly  and  honorably  in  the  interest  of  our
Nation, deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to commend those
who have served in times of active conflict, as well as those  who  have
served in times of peace; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  period  of  June  22, 1941, through May 8, 1945, saw,
arguably, the most ferocious fighting in history during the invasion  of
the Soviet Union by the armed forces of Nazi Germany and its allies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  men  and  women  of the Red Army operated during that
time-period in full alliance with the men and women of the armed  forces
of the United States, the United Kingdom, and of other allied nations to
end the scourge of National Socialism; and
 
  WHEREAS, Of the estimated 70 to 85 million deaths suffered worldwide
during  the  second World War, most estimates suggest total losses of 30
million lives on the Eastern Front, and this includes approximately  80%
of all German losses in that War; and
 
  WHEREAS, The soldiers of the Red Army displayed measures of courage,
perseverance,  toughness and resolve rarely equaled in military history;
and
 
  WHEREAS, These soldiers earned victory in what is called  in  Russia
"The  Great  Patriotic  War,"  despite  shortages, personal privation, a
skilled, ruthless, and fearsome enemy, sometimes erratic or  indifferent
leadership, and often horrendous weather conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, The efforts of these soldiers helped to bring an end to one
of the most evil and murderous regimes in human history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  word  "hero"  can, and should be, honestly applied to
these veterans who, even after the 79 long years since VE day, are  owed
a debt of gratitude by persons born long after their sacrifices; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Within  Brooklyn,  New  York,  there  still lives numerous
veterans of this War, all having reached the remarkable age of 100 years
or greater; and
 
  WHEREAS, These veterans are all members of the American  Association
of Invalids and Veterans of World War II; and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with  which  these  men served their country, and must recognize that no
greater debt is owed than that owed to those who gave  their  lives  for
 
their  beloved Nation and to those who continue to be missing in action;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having exhibited their patriotism both at home and abroad,
these men and women demonstrated their love for  their  country,  proved
true and dedicated allyship to the United States, and merit forevermore,
the highest respect of this State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  veterans  deserve  to be recognized, commended, and
thanked by the people of the State of New York and all citizens of  this
Nation  for  their  honorable  service and for their proven successes in
allyship to the Unites States and Britain; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
acknowledge  and  honor  the  services  of  the following members of the
American Association of Invalids and Veterans of  World  War  II:  Roman
