 Introduced  by  Sen. MATTERA -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Consumer Protection
 
 AN ACT to amend the general  business  law,  in  relation  to  requiring
  towers  to  clean up any debris in the surrounding area resulting from
  the vehicles they are towing

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent. The legislature finds and determines
 that often the delay caused by  investigation  and  removal  process  of
 damaged  and  disabled motor vehicles from vehicle accident crash scenes
 results in congestion of traffic and can cause additional accidents.
  The legislature further finds and  determines  that  it  is  of  vital
 importance  to  remove  damaged  and disabled vehicles from the roads as
 promptly as possible.
  The legislature also finds and determines that motor vehicle  accident
 and disablement sites, are often left in an unsafe and unclean condition
 after tow truck operators and emergency personnel leave the scene.
  The legislature determines that clean up standards and enforcement are
 needed  to ensure public/vehicle safety is maintained and to ensure that
 accident and disablement scenes are left free of  debris  and  are  safe
 thoroughfares.
  Therefore,  the  purpose of this law is to ensure that following motor
 vehicle accidents and disablements, and as part of the  towing  services
 involved,  that  the surrounding area/scene will be swept and left clean
 and free from debris so as to protect the  public  and  future  vehicles
 traveling in the area.
  §  2. The general business law is amended by adding a new section 399-
 xxx to read as follows:
