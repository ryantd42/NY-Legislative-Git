 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to review of projects
  affecting the availability of maternity services
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subparagraph (v) of  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  2  of
 section  2803  of  the public health law, as added by chapter 807 of the
 laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  (v) standards and procedures relating to  hospital  operating  certif-
 icates,  provided  however,  that  the  council  shall establish minimum
 acceptable standards and procedures equal to the  standards  and  proce-
 dures  which federal law and regulation require for hospitals to qualify
 as providers pursuant to titles XVIII and  XIX  of  the  federal  social
 security  act.  The existing state standards and procedures in effect on
 the date that this subdivision becomes  effective  shall  be  deemed  to
 constitute  maximum  standards  and  procedures for purposes of limiting
 medical assistance reimbursement pursuant to the  social  services  law.
 Such  standards  and procedures may thereafter be changed or added to by
 the council only upon the recommendation of the  commissioner.  For  the
 purposes  of  ensuring  that  the  health and safety of the residents of
 hospitals are not endangered, the council may promulgate changes in  the
 minimum  acceptable  standards  and  procedures  referred to herein upon
 recommendation of the commissioner.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE COMMISSIONER
 SHALL PROMULGATE REGULATIONS REQUIRING THAT THE ADDITION  OF,  DECERTIF-
 ICATION  OF,  OR CHANGES IN THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF PERINATAL SERVICES
 BY A GENERAL HOSPITAL SHALL BE SUBJECT  TO  AN  APPLICATION  UNDER  THIS
 ARTICLE THAT REQUIRES REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY THE COUNCIL, and
  § 2.  This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
