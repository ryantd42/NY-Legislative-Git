  Section 1. Section 275 of the education law  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  § 275. Librarians of school libraries.  In a school district maintain-
 ing  an  academic  department  or high school the board of education may
 employ, and fix the compensation of, a person to act as school librarian
 who may be engaged for all or a part of the time in performance  of  the
 duties of the position as may be directed by the said board.  The person
 so  employed,  who  may  be  the librarian of the free library, shall be
 possessed of the  qualifications  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  [of
 education].  In all other districts the trustees or board of education
 may appoint a competent person to act as librarian.  In case of a  fail-
 ure  of  a  city  or  union free school district maintaining an academic
 department or high school to employ a librarian as above  provided,  the
 teacher  of English in such school shall be the librarian.  In case of a
 failure to appoint a librarian in any other district, the teacher, or if
 there be more than one teacher  the  principal  teacher,  shall  act  as
 librarian.  The  trustees  or  board  of education shall report to the
 commissioner [of education] the name and address of the person  employed
 or  appointed  as librarian.  IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, EVERY ELEMENTARY
 SCHOOL, MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL SHALL HAVE A SCHOOL LIBRARIAN.
