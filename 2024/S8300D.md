 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. a) The several amounts specified in this chapter for state
 operations, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to accomplish  the
 purposes  designated  by the appropriations, are hereby appropriated and
 authorized to be paid as hereinafter provided, to the respective  public
 officers and for the several purposes specified.
  b)  Where applicable, appropriations made by this chapter for expendi-

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

  LBD12650-10-4
  2  12650-10-4
 
  c)  The  several  amounts named herein, or so much thereof as shall be
 sufficient to accomplish the purpose designated, being  the  undisbursed
 and/or unexpended balances of the prior year's appropriations, are here-
 by  reappropriated  from  the same funds and made available for the same
 purposes  as the prior year's appropriations, unless herein amended, for
 the fiscal year beginning April 1,  2024.  Certain  reappropriations  in
 this  chapter  are  shown using abbreviated text, with three leader dots
 (an ellipsis) followed by three spaces (...  ) used to  indicate  where
 existing  law  that  is  being continued is not shown. However, unless a
 change is clearly indicated by the use of brackets [ ] for deletions and
 underscores for additions, the purposes, amounts, funding source and all
 other aspects pertinent to each item of appropriation shall be  as  last
 appropriated.
  For  the  purpose  of  complying with the state finance law, the year,
 chapter and section of the last act reappropriating  a  former  original
 appropriation  or any part thereof is, unless otherwise indicated, chap-
 ter 50, section 1, of the laws of 2023.
  d) No moneys appropriated by  this  chapter  shall  be  available  for
 payment  until a certificate of approval has been issued by the director
 of the budget, who shall file such certificate with  the  department  of
 audit  and  control, the chairperson of the senate finance committee and
 the chairperson of the assembly ways and means committee.
  e) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, for  purposes
 of  any  appropriation made by this chapter which authorizes spending in
 an amount net of refunds, rebates, reimbursements, credits,  repayments,
 and/or  disallowances,  "refunds" shall mean funds received to the state
 resulting from the overpayment of monies,  "rebates"  shall  mean  funds
 received  to  the  state  resulting  from  a return of a full or partial
 amount  previously  paid,  as  for  goods  or  services,  serving  as  a
 reduction,  discount  or  rebate  to  the  original  payment  amount,
 "reimbursements" shall mean funds received to the state as repayment  in
 an equivalent amount for goods or services, including but not limited to
 personal  service  costs,  incurred  by  the state in the first instance
 being provided to a third party for their benefit and  partially  or  in
 full  financed  by  such  third  party,  "credit" shall mean monies made
 available to the state that reduce the amount owed  to  a  third  party,
 including but not limited to billing errors, rebates, and prior overpay-
 ments,  "repayment"  shall  mean  the  return  of monies as pay back for
 expenses incurred, and "disallowance" shall mean monies  made  available
 to  the  state  that  were  not  allowed  or  accepted officially by the
 intended recipient, based on a determination the payment is not accepta-
 ble and/or valid. When the office of the state comptroller receives  any
 such  refunds,  rebates,  reimbursements,  credits,  repayments,  and/or
 disallowances, he or she shall credit the refunded, rebated, reimbursed,
 credited, repaid, and disallowed amount back to the  original  appropri-
 ation  and reduce expenditures in the year which such credit is received
 regardless of the timing of the initial expenditure.
  f) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,  upon  enact-
 ment of this chapter of the laws of 2024 containing the state operations
 budget  bill for the state fiscal year 2024-2025, all appropriations and
 reappropriations, except for appropriations  and  reappropriations  from

  exceed $31,634,010,000 except as  provided
  below  provided,  however,  such aggregate

  cause medicaid spending for such period to

  in for such  period,  the  state  medicaid
  director,  in consultation with the direc-
  tor of the budget and the commissioner  of
  health,  shall  develop a medicaid savings
  allocation adjustment to limit such spend-
  ing to the aggregate limit specified here-
  in for such period.
 Such medicaid savings allocation  adjustment
  shall  be designed, to reduce the expendi-
  tures  authorized  by  the  appropriations
  herein  in  compliance  with the following
  guidelines: (1) reductions shall  be  made
  in compliance with applicable federal law,
  including  the  provisions  of the Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law No. 111-148, and the Health  Care  and
  Education  Reconciliation  Act  of  2010,
  Public  Law  No.  111-152  (collectively
  "Affordable  Care Act") and any subsequent
  amendments thereto or regulations  promul-
  gated  thereunder; (2) reductions shall be
  made in a manner that  complies  with  the
  state medicaid plan approved by the feder-
  al  centers  for  medicare  and  medicaid
  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner  of  health  is authorized to
  submit any state plan  amendment  or  seek
  other  federal  approval, including waiver
  authority, to implement the provisions  of
  the medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  that  meets  the  other criteria set forth
  herein; (3) reductions shall be made in  a
  manner  that  maximizes  federal financial
  participation, to the extent  practicable,
  including  any  federal  financial partic-
  ipation that is available or is reasonably
  expected  to  become  available,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, under the
  Affordable Care Act; (4) reductions  shall
  be  made  uniformly  among  categories  of
  services and  geographic  regions  of  the
  state,  to  the  extent  practicable,  and
  shall be made uniformly within a  category
  of  service,  to  the  extent practicable,
  except where the  commissioner  determines
  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for
  non-uniformity, including but not  limited
  to:  the  extent to which specific catego-
  ries of services contributed to department
  of health medicaid state funds spending in
  419  12650-10-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  STATE OPERATIONS  2024-25
 
  excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need to maintain safety  net  services  in
  underserved  communities; or the potential
  benefits  of  pursuing  innovative payment
  models contemplated by the Affordable Care
  Act, in which case such grounds  shall  be
  set  forth  in  the medicaid savings allo-
  cation  adjustment;  and  (5)  reductions
  shall  be  made  in a manner that does not
  unnecessarily  create  administrative
  burdens to medicaid applicants and recipi-
  ents or providers.
 The commissioner shall seek the input of the
  legislature,  as  well  as  organizations
  representing  health  care  providers,
  consumers,  businesses,  workers,  health
  insurers, and others with relevant  exper-
  tise,  in developing such medicaid savings
  allocation adjustment, to the extent  that
  all  or  part  of  such adjustment, in the
  discretion of the commissioner, is  likely
  to  have  a material impact on the overall
  medicaid program, particular categories of
  service or particular  geographic  regions
  of the state.
 (a) The commissioner shall post the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  on  the
  department of health's website  and  shall
  provide  written copies of such adjustment
  to the chairs of the  senate  finance  and
  the  assembly ways and means committees at
  least 30 days before  the  date  on  which
  implementation is expected to begin.
 (b) The commissioner may revise the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment subsequent
  to the provisions of notice and  prior  to
  implementation  but  need  provide  a  new
  notice pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  of
  this  paragraph  only  if the commissioner
  determines, in his or her discretion, that
  such  revisions  materially  alter  the
  adjustment.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  the
  commissioner  need  not  seek  the  input
  described  in paragraph (a) of this subdi-
  vision or provide notice pursuant to para-
  graph (b) of this subdivision if,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, expedited
  development and implementation of a  medi-
  caid  savings  allocation  adjustment  is
  420  12650-10-4

  necessary due to a public health  emergen-
  cy.
 For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  public
  health emergency  is  defined  as:  (i)  a
  disaster,  natural  or  otherwise,  that
  significantly increases the immediate need
  for health care personnel in  an  area  of
  the state; (ii) an event or condition that
  creates a widespread risk of exposure to a
  serious  communicable  disease,  or  the
  potential  for  such  widespread  risk  of
  exposure;  or  (iii)  any  other  event or
  condition determined by  the  commissioner
  to constitute an imminent threat to public
  health.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
  prevent  all  or  part  of  such  medicaid
  savings allocation adjustment from  taking
  effect retroactively to the extent permit-
  ted  by  the  federal centers for medicare
  and medicaid services.
 In  accordance  with  the  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment, the commissioner of
  the  department  of  health  shall  reduce
  department of health state funds  medicaid
  spending  by  the  amount of the projected
  overspending through,  actions  including,
  but not limited to modifying or suspending
  reimbursement  methods,  including but not
  limited to all fees,  premium  levels  and
  rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding  any
  provision of  law  that  sets  a  specific
  amount  or  methodology  for  any  such
  payments or rates  of  payment;  modifying
  medicaid  program  benefits;  seeking  all
  necessary  federal  approvals,  including,
  but  not  limited  to  waivers, and waiver
  amendments; and suspending time frames for
  notice, approval or certification of  rate
  requirements,  notwithstanding  any
  provision of law, rule  or  regulation  to
  the contrary, including but not limited to
  sections  2807  and  3614  of  the  public
  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the

 The department of  health  shall  prepare  a
  quarterly  report  that  sets  forth:  (a)
  known and projected department  of  health
  medicaid  expenditures  as  described  in

  that could result  in  medicaid  disburse-

 Notwithstanding  section  40  of  the  state
  finance law or any provision of law to the
  contrary,  subject  to  federal  approval,
  department  of health state funds medicaid
  spending, excluding payments  for  medical
  services  provided  at  state  facilities
  operated by the office of  mental  health,
  the  office  for people with developmental
  disabilities and the office  of  addiction
  services  and supports and further exclud-
  ing any payments which are  not  appropri-
  ated  within  the department of health, in
  the aggregate, for  the  period  April  1,
  2024  through  March  31,  2025, shall not
  exceed $31,634,010,000 except as  provided
  below  provided,  however,  such aggregate
  limits may be adjusted by the director  of
  the  budget  to account for any changes in
  the New York state federal medical assist-
  ance percentage amount established  pursu-
  ant  to  the  federal social security act,
  increases in provider revenues, reductions
  in local social services district payments
  for  medical  assistance  administration,
  minimum  wage  increases,  and  beginning
  April 1, 2013 the operational costs of the
  New York  state  medical  indemnity  fund,
  pursuant  to  chapter  59  of  the laws of
  2011, and state costs or savings from  the
  essential  plan.  Such  projections may be
  adjusted by the director of the budget  to
  account for increased or expedited depart-
  ment  of  health  state  funds  medicaid
  expenditures as a result of a  natural  or
  other  type  of  disaster,  including  a
  governmental declaration of emergency.
 The director of the budget, in  consultation
  with  the  commissioner  of  health, shall
  assess on  a  quarterly  basis  known  and
  projected medicaid expenditures by catego-
  ry of service and by geographic region, as
  determined  by the commissioner of health,
  incurred both prior to and  subsequent  to
  429  12650-10-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  STATE OPERATIONS  2024-25
 
  such  assessment for each such period, and
  if the director of the  budget  determines
  that  such  expenditures  are  expected to
  cause medicaid spending for such period to
  exceed the aggregate limit specified here-
  in  for  such  period,  the state medicaid
  director, in consultation with the  direc-
  tor  of the budget and the commissioner of
  health, shall develop a  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment to limit such spend-
  ing to the aggregate limit specified here-
  in for such period.
 Such  medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  shall be designed, to reduce the  expendi-
  tures  authorized  by  the  appropriations
  herein in compliance  with  the  following
  guidelines:  (1)  reductions shall be made
  in compliance with applicable federal law,
  including the provisions  of  the  Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law  No.  111-148, and the Health Care and
  Education  Reconciliation  Act  of  2010,
  Public  Law  No.  111-152  (collectively
  "Affordable Care Act") and any  subsequent
  amendments  thereto or regulations promul-
  gated thereunder; (2) reductions shall  be
  made  in  a  manner that complies with the
  state medicaid plan approved by the feder-
  al  centers  for  medicare  and  medicaid
  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner of health  is  authorized  to
  submit  any  state  plan amendment or seek
  other federal approval,  including  waiver
  authority,  to implement the provisions of
  the medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  that meets the other  criteria  set  forth
  herein;  (3) reductions shall be made in a
  manner that  maximizes  federal  financial
  participation,  to the extent practicable,
  including any  federal  financial  partic-
  ipation that is available or is reasonably
  expected  to  become  available,  in  the
  discretion of the commissioner, under  the
  Affordable  Care Act; (4) reductions shall
  be  made  uniformly  among  categories  of
  services  and  geographic  regions  of the
  state,  to  the  extent  practicable,  and
  shall  be made uniformly within a category
  of service,  to  the  extent  practicable,
  except  where  the commissioner determines
  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for
  non-uniformity,  including but not limited
  430  12650-10-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  STATE OPERATIONS  2024-25
 
  to: the extent to which  specific  catego-
  ries of services contributed to department
  of health medicaid state funds spending in
  excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need  to  maintain  safety net services in
  underserved communities; or the  potential
  benefits  of  pursuing  innovative payment
  models contemplated by the Affordable Care
  Act, in which case such grounds  shall  be
  set  forth  in  the medicaid savings allo-
  cation  adjustment;  and  (5)  reductions
  shall  be  made  in a manner that does not
  unnecessarily  create  administrative
  burdens to medicaid applicants and recipi-
  ents or providers.
 The commissioner shall seek the input of the
  legislature,  as  well  as  organizations
  representing  health  care  providers,
  consumers,  businesses,  workers,  health
  insurers, and others with relevant  exper-
  tise,  in developing such medicaid savings
  allocation adjustment, to the extent  that
  all  or  part  of  such adjustment, in the
  discretion of the commissioner, is  likely
  to  have  a material impact on the overall
  medicaid program, particular categories of
  service or particular  geographic  regions
  of the state.
 (a) The commissioner shall post the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  on  the
  department of health's website  and  shall
  provide  written copies of such adjustment
  to the chairs of the  senate  finance  and
  the  assembly ways and means committees at
  least 30 days before  the  date  on  which
  implementation is expected to begin.
 (b) The commissioner may revise the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment subsequent
  to the provisions of notice and  prior  to
  implementation  but  need  provide  a  new
  notice pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  of
  this  paragraph  only  if the commissioner
  determines, in his or her discretion, that
  such  revisions  materially  alter  the
  adjustment.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  the
  commissioner  need  not  seek  the  input
  described  in paragraph (a) of this subdi-
  vision or provide notice pursuant to para-
  graph (b) of this subdivision if,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, expedited
  431  12650-10-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  STATE OPERATIONS  2024-25
 
  development and implementation of a  medi-
  caid  savings  allocation  adjustment  is
  necessary due to a public health  emergen-
  cy.
 For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  public
  health emergency  is  defined  as:  (i)  a
  disaster,  natural  or  otherwise,  that
  significantly increases the immediate need
  for health care personnel in  an  area  of
  the state; (ii) an event or condition that
  creates a widespread risk of exposure to a
  serious  communicable  disease,  or  the
  potential  for  such  widespread  risk  of
  exposure;  or  (iii)  any  other  event or
  condition determined by  the  commissioner
  to constitute an imminent threat to public
  health.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
  prevent  all  or  part  of  such  medicaid
  savings allocation adjustment from  taking
  effect retroactively to the extent permit-
  ted  by  the  federal centers for medicare
  and medicaid services.
 In  accordance  with  the  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment, the commissioner of
  the  department  of  health  shall  reduce
  department of health state funds  medicaid
  spending  by  the  amount of the projected
  overspending through,  actions  including,
  but not limited to modifying or suspending
  reimbursement  methods,  including but not
  limited to all fees,  premium  levels  and
  rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding  any
  provision of  law  that  sets  a  specific
  amount  or  methodology  for  any  such
  payments or rates  of  payment;  modifying
  medicaid  program  benefits;  seeking  all
  necessary  federal  approvals,  including,
  but  not  limited  to  waivers, and waiver
  amendments; and suspending time frames for
  notice, approval or certification of  rate
  requirements,  notwithstanding  any
  provision of law, rule  or  regulation  to
  the contrary, including but not limited to
  sections  2807  and  3614  of  the  public
  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the
  laws of 1988, and 18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
 The department of  health  shall  prepare  a
  quarterly report that sets forth:(a) known
  and  projected  department of health medi-
  caid expenditures as described in subdivi-
  sion 1 of this section, and  factors  that
  432  12650-10-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  STATE OPERATIONS  2024-25
 
  could result in medicaid disbursements for
  the  relevant  state fiscal year to exceed
  the projected department of  health  state
  funds  disbursements in the enacted budget
  financial plan pursuant to  subdivision  3
  of  section  23  of the state finance law,
  including spending increases or  decreases
  due  to:  enrollment  fluctuations,  rate
  changes, utilization changes, MRT  invest-
  ments,  and  shift  of  beneficiaries  to
  managed care; and  variations  in  offline
  medicaid  payments;  and  (b)  the actions
  taken to implement  any  medicaid  savings
  allocation  plan  implemented  pursuant to
  subdivision 4 of this  section,  including
  information  concerning the impact of such
  actions on each category  of  service  and
  each  geographic region of the state. Each
  such quarterly report shall be provided to
  the chairs of the senate finance  and  the
  assembly  ways  and  means  committees and
  shall  be  posted  on  the  department  of
  health's website in a timely manner.
 Notwithstanding  any other provision of law,
  the  money  hereby  appropriated  may  be
  increased  or  decreased  by  interchange,
  with any appropriation of  the  department
  of  health,  and  may  be  increased  or

 The appropriation made by chapter 50, section 1, of the laws of 2023, is
  hereby amended and reappropriated to read:
  Notwithstanding  section  40 of the state finance law or any other law
  to the contrary, all medical  assistance  appropriations  made  from
  this account shall remain in full force and effect in accordance, in
  the  aggregate with the following schedule: not more than 49 percent
  for the period April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024;  and  the  remaining
  amount for the period April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025.
  Notwithstanding  section  40 of the state finance law or any provision
  of law to the 22 contrary, subject to federal  approval,  department
  of  health  state  funds  medicaid  spending, excluding payments for
  medical services provided at state facilities operated by the office
  of mental health, the office for people with developmental disabili-
  ties and the office of addiction services and supports  and  further
  excluding any payments which are not appropriated within the depart-
  ment  of  health,  in  the  aggregate,  for the period April 1, 2023
  through March 31, 2024, shall not exceed $28,109,771,000  except  as
  provided  below and state share medicaid spending, in the aggregate,
  for the period April 1, 2024  through  March  31,  2025,  shall  not
  exceed  [$31,020,880,000]  $31,634,010,000,  but  in  no event shall
  department of health state funds medicaid spending  for  the  period
  April  1,  2023  through  March  31,  2025  exceed [$59,130,651,000]
  $59,743,781,000 provided, however,  such  aggregate  limits  may  be
  adjusted by the director of the budget to account for any changes in
  the  New  York  state  federal  medical assistance percentage amount
  established pursuant to the federal social security  act,  increases
  in  provider  revenues, reductions in local social services district
  payments  for  medical  assistance  administration,  minimum  wage
  increases,  and beginning April 1, 2013 the operational costs of the
  New York state medical indemnity fund, pursuant to chapter 59 of the
  laws of 2011, and state costs or savings from  the  essential  plan.
  Such  projections  may  be adjusted by the director of the budget to
  account for increased or expedited department of health state  funds
  medicaid  expenditures  as  a  result  of a natural or other type of
  disaster, including a governmental declaration of emergency.
  The director of the budget, in consultation with the  commissioner  of
  health,  shall assess on a quarterly basis known and projected medi-
  caid expenditures by category of service and by  geographic  region,
  as  determined by the commissioner of health, incurred both prior to
  and subsequent to such assessment for each such period, and  if  the
  director  of  the  budget  determines  that  such  expenditures  are
  expected to cause medicaid spending for such period  to  exceed  the
  aggregate limit specified herein for such period, the state medicaid
  director,  in  consultation  with the director of the budget and the
  commissioner of health, shall develop a medicaid savings  allocation
  adjustment  to  limit such spending to the aggregate limit specified
  herein for such period.
  Such medicaid savings allocation  adjustment  shall  be  designed,  to
  reduce  the  expenditures authorized by the appropriations herein in
  457  12650-10-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  STATE OPERATIONS - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25
 
  compliance with the following guidelines: (1)  reductions  shall  be
  made  in  compliance  with  applicable  federal  law,  including the
  provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law  No.  111-148,  and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
  Act of 2010, Public Law No. 111-152 (collectively  "Affordable  Care
  Act")  and  any subsequent amendments thereto or regulations promul-
  gated thereunder; (2) reductions shall be made in a manner that  com
  plies  with  the state medicaid plan approved by the federal centers
  for medicare and medicaid  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner of health is authorized to submit any state plan amend-
  ment  or seek other federal approval, including waiver authority, to
  implement the provisions of the medicaid savings allocation  adjust-
  ment  that meets the other criteria set forth herein; (3) reductions
  shall be made in a manner that maximizes federal  financial  partic-
  ipation,  to the extent practicable, including any federal financial
  participation that is available or is reasonably expected to  become
  available, in the discretion of the commissioner, under the Afforda-
  ble  Care  Act; (4) reductions shall be made uniformly among catego-
  ries of services and geographic regions of the state, to the  extent
  practicable,  and  shall  be  made  uniformly  within  a category of
  service, to the extent practicable, except  where  the  commissioner
  determines  that  there  are  sufficient grounds for non-uniformity,
  including but not limited to: the extent to which  specific  catego-
  ries  of services contributed to department of health medicaid state
  funds spending in excess of the limits specified herein; the need to
  maintain safety net services in underserved  com  munities;  or  the
  potential  benefits  of  pursuing  innovative payment models contem-
  plated by the Affordable Care Act, in which case such grounds  shall
  be  set forth in the medicaid savings allocation adjustment; and (5)
  reductions shall be made in a manner  that  does  not  unnecessarily
  create  administrative burdens to medicaid applicants and recipients
  or providers.
  The commissioner shall seek the input of the legislature, as  well  as
  organizations  representing  health care providers, consumers, busi-
  nesses, workers, health insurers, and others  with  relevant  exper-
  tise,  in developing such medicaid savings allocation adjustment, to
  the extent that all or part of such adjustment, in the discretion of
  the commissioner, is likely to have a material impact on the overall
  medicaid program, particular categories  of  service  or  particular

  For purposes of this section, a public health emergency is defined as:
  (i) a disaster, natural or otherwise, that  significantly  increases

  exposure  to  a  serious  communicable disease, or the potential for
  such widespread risk of exposure; or (iii) any other event or condi-
  tion determined by the commissioner to constitute an imminent threat

  Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prevent all  or  part  of
  such  medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment  from  taking effect
  retroactively to the extent permitted by  the  federal  centers  for
  medicare and medicaid services.
  In  accordance  with  the  medicaid savings allocation adjustment, the
  commissioner of the department of health shall reduce department  of
  health  state funds medicaid spending by the amount of the projected
  overspending through, actions including, but not limited to  modify-
  ing  or  suspending reimbursement methods, including but not limited
  to all fees, premium levels and rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding
  any  provision of law that sets a specific amount or methodology for
  any such payments or rates of payment;  modifying  medicaid  program
  benefits;  seeking  all  necessary federal approvals, including, but
  not limited to waivers, and waiver amendments; and  suspending  time
  frames  for  notice, approval or certification of rate requirements,
  notwithstanding any provision of law,  rule  or  regulation  to  the
  contrary, including but not limited to sections 2807 and 3614 of the
  public  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the laws of 1988, and
  18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
  The department of health shall prepare a quarterly  report  that  sets
  forth: (a) known and projected department of health medicaid expend-
  itures  as  described  in subdivision 1 of this section, and factors
  that could result in medicaid disbursements for the  relevant  state
  fiscal year to exceed the projected department of health state funds
  disbursements  in the enacted budget financial plan pursuant to sub-
  division 3 of section 23 of the state finance law, including  spend-
  ing  increases  or  decreases  due to: enrollment fluctuations, rate
  changes, utilization changes, MRT investments, and shift of  benefi-
  ciaries  to  managed  care;  and  variations  in  offline  medicaid
  payments; and (b)  the  actions  taken  to  implement  any  medicaid
  savings  allocation adjustment implemented pursuant to subdivision 4
  of this section, including information concerning the impact of such
  actions on each category of service and each  geographic  region  of
  the  state.  Each  such  quarterly  report  shall be provided to the

  tees and shall be posted on the department of health's website in  a

  contrary, the institute shall  be  author-
  ized  to contract with third parties as it
  deems  necessary  and  appropriate  to
  complete  the  study.  The institute shall
  gather and consider feedback provided by a
  broad and diverse range  of  stakeholders,
  including  but  not  limited  to education
  organizations, teachers,  parents,  school
  administrators,  and  school  boards.  The
  institute shall hold at least three public
  hearings across the state to gather  input
  from such stakeholders.
 The  results,  findings, and recommendations
  of the study shall be for  study  purposes
  only, shall not be considered binding upon
  the  executive  or  the legislature in any
  manner,  and  shall  not  establish  the
  constitutional  minimum cost to provide an
  opportunity for a sound basic education.
 The foundation aid formula, as  modified  by
  the  recommendations  of  the study, shall
  achieve the following:
 (a) be fiscally sustainable for  the  state,
  local taxpayers, and school districts; and
 (b) calculate foundation aid payable for all
  school  districts  consistently using only
  the most recent year or years of available
  data  on  pupil  counts,  student  needs,
  district  income  and property wealth, and
  other formula components.
 The study shall evaluate each current compo-
  nent of the  foundation  aid  formula  and
  recommend  whether  to  retain, modify, or
  eliminate the component, and may  evaluate
  and recommend new components to add to the
  formula.  Such  evaluation  shall consider
  relevant data and research. The components
  to be so evaluated shall include  but  not
  be limited to the following:
 (a)  the  foundation amount of instructional
  spending per pupil;
 (b)  the  additional  weightings  for  pupil
  needs,  such as for free and reduced-price
  lunch, census  poverty,  English  language
  learners,  sparsity, and pupils with disa-
  bilities;
 (c) the adjustment for regional cost differ-
  ences;
 (d) the  calculation  of  school  districts'
  relative wealth;
 (e)  the expected minimum local contribution
  toward the adjusted foundation amount; and
  743  12650-10-4
 
  STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK

  STATE OPERATIONS  2024-25
 
 (f) the pupil counts, such as public enroll-
  ment and average daily membership.
 In support of its recommendations, the study
  shall at a minimum examine the following:
 (a)  New  York's  overall  state  and  local
  system  of  funding  public  education
  compared to those of other states, includ-
  ing  but  not limited to the methodologies
  and levels of funding;
 (b) the extent to which the  current  calcu-
  lation  of the foundation amount is incon-
  sistent with current adjustments for pupil
  needs and regional  cost  differences  and
  includes  costs supported by other non-lo-
  cal revenues;
 (c) the additional instructional costs asso-
  ciated  with  addressing  the  needs  of
  certain  groups  of  students,  including
  whether  and  how  to  properly  weight
  students  belonging  to  multiple  such
  groups;
 (d) the extent to  which  teacher  salaries,
  other  professional  salaries, the cost of
  living, and school district  spending  per
  pupil vary by region;
 (e) the formula's adjusted foundation amount
  compared  to  school  districts'  actual
  spending  on  the  costs  intended  to  be
  supported by such amount;
 (f)  the  formula's  expected  minimum local
  contribution compared to school districts'
  actual  local  contribution  and  fiscal
  capacity,  including  but  not  limited to
  property tax levy, unexpended  surplus  in
  excess of the limit established by section
  1318  of  the  real  property tax law, and
  other potential offsets;
 (g) the extent to  which  school  districts'
  property  tax  rates  vary  by  districts'
  relative income; and
 (h)  school  districts'  overall  financial
  condition,  including  annual  operating
  deficits or surpluses and accumulated fund
  balances and reserves.
 The institute shall submit a report  of  its
  findings and recommendations to the gover-
  nor,  the  temporary  president  of  the
