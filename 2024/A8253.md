 AND VEHICLE SUSPENSION OR SUSPENSIONS SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT AS LONG  AS
 THE SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF SUCH DRIVER'S LICENSE.
  2.  ALL  MOTOR  VEHICLES REGISTERED TO SUCH PERSON SHALL NOT BE REGIS-
 TERED OR REREGISTERED IN THE NAME OF SUCH PERSON, OR IN ANY  OTHER  NAME

 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, AND NO OTHER MOTOR VEHICLE SHALL BE REGISTERED
 IN THE NAME OF SUCH PERSON DURING THE PERIOD OF SUCH SUSPENSION.
  3.  EXCEPT  AS  PROVIDED  IN  SUBDIVISION FIVE OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED

 OR  NUMBERS  WHICH  ARE  SUSPENDED,  THE NUMBER PLATES OF THE VEHICLE OR
 VEHICLES WHICH MUST BE SURRENDERED, THE INFRACTION, INFRACTIONS, OFFENSE

  E.  SUCH  PERSON SHALL SURRENDER ANY NUMBER PLATES FOR ANY VEHICLE FOR
 WHICH THE PERSON IS THE REGISTRANT WITHIN  FOURTEEN  DAYS  OF  RECEIVING
 NOTICE  FROM  THE  DEPARTMENT.  FAILURE  TO SURRENDER NUMBER PLATES UPON

 FINE  NOT LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS NOR MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED
 DOLLARS OR IMPRISONMENT FOR NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN DAYS OR BOTH SUCH FINE
 AND IMPRISONMENT.
  5. A WAIVER OF THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISIONS  ONE  AND  TWO  OF  THIS
 SECTION  SHALL BE AVAILABLE FOR MOTOR VEHICLES WHICH ARE JOINTLY USED BY
 SPOUSES OR OTHER IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS IF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF  SUCH
 SUBDIVISION WOULD RESULT IN AN EXTREME HARDSHIP FOR THE SPOUSE OR FAMILY
 MEMBER  WHOSE LICENSE HAS NOT BEEN SUSPENDED OR REVOKED.  TO BE ELIGIBLE
 FOR AN EXTREME HARDSHIP EXCEPTION, A DULY LICENSED SPOUSE  OR  IMMEDIATE
 FAMILY  MEMBER  MUST FURNISH PROOF ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMMISSIONER OR HIS
 OR HER DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT THAT HE OR SHE JOINTLY USES A MOTOR VEHICLE
 WHOSE REGISTRATION AND NUMBER  PLATES  WOULD  OTHERWISE  BE  SUBJECT  TO
 SUSPENSION  OR  SURRENDER  PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  ONE OR TWO OF THIS
 SECTION. ACCEPTABLE PROOF SHALL INCLUDE WITHOUT LIMITATION THE SPOUSE OR
 IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER BEING NAMED IN A POLICY OF  LIABILITY  INSURANCE
 FOR  THE  MOTOR VEHICLE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SEVEN OF THIS CHAPTER BEFORE
 THE DATE OF CONVICTION, AND ANY ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT THE COMMISSIONER
 OR HIS OR HER DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT DEEMS NECESSARY TO  ESTABLISH  JOINT
 USE.  THE  COMMISSIONER OR HIS OR HER DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT SHALL DETER-
 MINE WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL QUALIFIES  AS  AN  IMMEDIATE  FAMILY  MEMBER,
 PROVIDED  THAT SUCH DEFINITION OF IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS SHALL INCLUDE
 WITHOUT LIMITATION DOMESTIC PARTNERS AS DEFINED IN SECTION FOUR  OF  THE
 WORKERS' COMPENSATION LAW AND ANY CHILDREN OF THE REGISTRANT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
