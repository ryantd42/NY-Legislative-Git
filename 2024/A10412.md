 AN  ACT  in  relation to permitting Agudath Israel Youth of Boro Park to
  file an application for a real property tax exemption
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  commissioner  of  the New York city department of finance is hereby
 authorized to accept from Agudath Israel Youth of Boro Park an  applica-
 tion  for  exemption  from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a
 and 462 of the real property tax law  with  respect  to  the  tax  years
 2019-2020,  2020-2021,  2021-2022,  2022-2023,  and 2023-2024 assessment
 rolls for all of the school taxes and all of the general taxes  for  the
 parcel  owned  by such organization located at 1561 50th Street, borough
 of Brooklyn, county of Kings, otherwise known as block 05453, lot 51. If
 accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it had  been  received
 on  or  before  the  taxable status date established for such assessment
 roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status date,  the  commissioner  of
 the New York city department of finance, upon approval by the city coun-
 cil  of  the  city  of  New  York, may grant exemption from all taxation
 beginning with the date of acquisition of the property  by  such  entity
 and  make  appropriate correction to the subject roll. If such exemption
 is granted and such organization, therefore, shall  have  paid  any  tax
 with respect to the subject roll, the department of  finance may, in its
 sole  discretion,  provide for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel
 those taxes, fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
