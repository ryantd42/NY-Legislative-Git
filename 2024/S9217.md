 limited  to, federal small business administration standards pursuant to
 13  CFR part 121 and any amendments thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, NOTWITH-
 STANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW TO THE  CONTRARY,  FOR  PURPOSES  OF
 CERTIFICATION  OF  A  MINORITY-OWNED  BUSINESS  ENTERPRISE UNDER SECTION

 LATION OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION AND WHERE EIGHTY PERCENT OR MORE OF  ITS
 EMPLOYEES  THAT  WORK  AT  SUCH LOCATION IN SUCH CITY ARE MINORITY GROUP
 MEMBERS AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION EIGHT OF THIS SECTION.  The  director
 may  issue  regulations  on  the construction of the terms in this defi-
 nition. For purposes of this subdivision, an  employee  may  break  from
 employment  for up to thirteen weeks without the fifty-two week lookback
 period resetting.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 314 of the executive law, as amended  by
 chapter 567 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  The  director shall promulgate rules and regulations providing for
 the establishment of a statewide certification program  including  rules
 and regulations governing the approval, denial or revocation of any such
 certification  including  revocations  for  convictions for fraudulently
 misrepresenting the status of minority or  women-owned  business  enter-
 prises.  Such  rules shall set forth the maximum personal net worth of a
 minority group member or woman who may be relied upon to certify a busi-
 ness as a minority-owned business  enterprise  or  women-owned  business
 enterprise  with  a  minimum  personal  net  worth  threshold of fifteen
 million dollars, and may thereafter establish different  maximum  levels
 of  personal net worth for minority group members and women on an indus-
 try-by-industry basis for such industries as the director  shall  deter-
 mine.  Such  regulations relating to the classification of the industry-
 by-industry personal net worth  thresholds  above  the  fifteen  million
 dollar  threshold shall consider the personal net worth of the owners of
 both certified and non-certified businesses, including but  not  limited
 to,  prime  contractors  and  subcontractors,  as well as any such other
 factors needed to establish such thresholds. Such rules and  regulations
 shall include, but not be limited to, such matters as may be required to
 ensure  that  the established procedures thereunder shall at least be in
 compliance with the code of fair procedure set forth in  section  seven-
 ty-three  of the civil rights law, and consistent with the provisions of
 article twenty-three-A of  the  correction  law.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY
 PROVISION  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  OR  ANY  OTHER PROVISION OF LAW TO THE
 CONTRARY, FOR PURPOSES OF CERTIFICATION  OF  A  MINORITY-OWNED  BUSINESS
 ENTERPRISE,  THE  PERSONAL NET WORTH LIMIT OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR
 MORE SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE THAT  MANUFACTURES
 METAL OR VINYL WINDOWS AND DOORS (NAICS CODES 332321 AND 326199) THAT IS
 LOCATED  IN  A CITY WITH A POPULATION OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION AND WHERE
 EIGHTY PERCENT OR MORE OF ITS EMPLOYEES THAT WORK AT  SUCH  LOCATION  IN
 SUCH  CITY ARE MINORITY GROUP MEMBERS AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION EIGHT OF
 SECTION THREE HUNDRED TEN OF THIS ARTICLE.
  § 4. Subparagraph (vi) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 2-a of  section
