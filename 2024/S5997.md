  real  property  taxes  on  certain residential real property in a city
  having a population of one million or more

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The section heading of section 467-e of the real property
 tax law, as added by section 1 of part V of chapter 60 of  the  laws  of
 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  Rebate  for  owners  or  tenant-stockholders  of one, two [or], three,
 FOUR, FIVE OR SIX family residences or residential property held in  the
 condominium  or  cooperative  form of ownership in a city having a popu-
 lation of one million or more.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 467-e of the real property tax  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  483  of  the  laws  of 2007, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. Generally. Notwithstanding any provision of any general, special or
 local law to the contrary, any city having a population of  one  million
 or more is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and amend local laws
 in accordance with this section to grant a rebate of real property taxes
 for  THE  fiscal  years  beginning  on  the  first of July, two thousand
 [three] TWENTY-ONE and ending on the thirtieth  of  June,  two  thousand
 [nine]  TWENTY-THREE in the amount of [the lesser of] UP TO four hundred
 dollars [or] BUT IN NO CASE MORE THAN the annual tax  liability  imposed
 on the property. [No such local law may be adopted unless, as originally
 adopted, it authorizes such rebate to be granted in accordance with this
 section  for  three  consecutive  fiscal years beginning with the fiscal
 year beginning on the first of July, two thousand three. No such  rebate
 shall  be granted by local law for any fiscal year beginning on or after
 the first of July, two thousand nine, unless the council of  such  city,

 in  fixing  the  annual  tax  rates for any such fiscal year, shall have
 uniformly reduced such rates for all classes of  property  in  order  to
 produce  real  property  tax relief among such classes of property in an
 amount  not  less than, in the aggregate, the aggregate amount of rebate
 paid in such fiscal year. No such local law implementing the  provisions
 of  this  section, as amended by the chapter of the laws of two thousand
 seven which added this sentence, may be adopted  unless,  as  originally
 adopted,  such local law authorizes such rebate to be granted in accord-
 ance with this section for three consecutive fiscal years beginning with
 the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand  six.]  Any
 rebate  authorized by local law in accordance with this section shall be
 paid in the fiscal year following the fiscal year for which  the  rebate
 is  granted. [If, with respect to the fiscal year of such city beginning
 on the first of July, two thousand eight and ending on the thirtieth  of
 June,  two thousand nine, an increase in average real property tax rates
 would otherwise be necessary in the  resolution  of  such  city  council
 fixing  real  property  tax  rates  for such fiscal year pursuant to the
 charter of such city, then the rebate to be paid for  such  fiscal  year
 shall be reduced or eliminated as follows: where the sum to be raised by
 such  increase  is  less  than seven hundred fifty million dollars, then
 such rebate shall be reduced by fifty cents for each dollar of increase,
 and where the sum to be raised by such increase is seven  hundred  fifty
 million  dollars  or  more,  then  such  rebate shall be eliminated. The
 determination of the reduction or elimination of such  rebate  shall  be
 set  forth  in such resolution after consultation with the department of
 finance of such city and shall take effect upon the  final  adoption  of
 such resolution.] Such rebate shall be paid to an owner or tenant-stock-
 holder  who,  as of the date the application provided for in subdivision
 four of this section is due, owns a one, two [or], three, FOUR, FIVE  OR
 SIX  family residence or a dwelling unit in residential property held in
 the condominium or cooperative form of ownership that is  the  owner  or
 tenant-stockholder's  primary  residence and meets all other eligibility
 requirements of this section, UNLESS THE LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY PROVIDES
 BY LOCAL LAW THAT ONLY OWNERS OR  TENANT-STOCKHOLDERS  OF  A  SUBSET  OF
 THOSE  PROPERTY  TYPES  ARE  ELIGIBLE  TO  BE PAID THE REBATE. THE LOCAL
 LEGISLATIVE BODY MAY BY LOCAL LAW RESTRICT ELIGIBILITY ON THE  BASIS  OF
 WHETHER  AN  OWNER OR TENANT-STOCKHOLDER IS RECEIVING A PARTICULAR OTHER
 BENEFIT PURSUANT TO THIS CHAPTER OR THE  PRIVATE  HOUSING  FINANCE  LAW.
 [Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sections four hundred twen-
 ty-one-a, four hundred twenty-one-b or four hundred twenty-one-g of this
 title,  an owner or tenant-stockholder whose property is receiving bene-
 fits pursuant to such sections shall not be prohibited from receiving  a
 rebate  pursuant  to this section if such owner or tenant-stockholder is
 otherwise eligible to  receive  such  rebate.  Tenant-stockholders  of
 dwelling  units in a cooperative apartment corporation incorporated as a
 mutual company pursuant to article two, four,  five  or  eleven  of  the
 private  housing finance law shall not be entitled to the rebate author-
 ized by this section.] Such rebate shall be paid by the commissioner  of
 finance  to  eligible  owners  or tenant-stockholders in accordance with
 rules promulgated by the commissioner of finance.
  § 3. Subparagraph 1 of paragraph a of subdivision 2 of  section  467-e
 of the real property tax law, as added by section 1 of part V of chapter
 60 of the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  (1)  the  property  must  be a one, two [or], three, FOUR, FIVE OR SIX
 family residence or residential property  held  in  the  condominium  or
 cooperative  form  of  ownership UNLESS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THE LOCAL

 LAW ADOPTED BY THE LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBDIVISION
 ONE OF THIS SECTION;
  §  4.  Subparagraph 3 of paragraph a of subdivision 2 of section 467-e
 of the real property tax law, as added by section 1 of part V of chapter
 60 of the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  (3) the owner must not be in arrears in the payment of  real  property
 taxes  in an amount in excess of twenty-five dollars for the fiscal year
 for which the rebate is claimed and all  prior  fiscal  years,  and  for
 residential  property  held  in the cooperative form of ownership, there
 must be no arrears in the payment of real property taxes in an amount in
 excess of an average of twenty-five dollars per dwelling  unit  in  such
 cooperative  apartment  corporation  for  the  fiscal year for which the
 rebate is claimed and all prior fiscal years, EXCEPT THAT IF  THE  OWNER
 HAS  ENTERED INTO AN INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY TO ADDRESS SUCH
 ARREARS AND IS NOT IN DEFAULT ON SUCH AGREEMENT,  SUCH  OWNER  WOULD  BE
 ELIGIBLE  TO RECEIVE THE REBATE, HOWEVER THE AMOUNT OF SUCH REBATE SHALL
 FIRST BE APPLIED TO THE INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT  WITH  ANY  EXCESS  AMOUNT
 PROVIDED TO THE OWNER IN THE FORM OF A REBATE.
  § 5. Paragraph c of subdivision 3 of section 467-e of the real proper-
 ty tax law, as added by section 1 of part V of chapter 60 of the laws of
 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  c.  "Property"  means a one, two [or], three, FOUR, FIVE OR SIX family
 residence or a dwelling unit in residential property held in the  condo-
 minium  or cooperative form of ownership OR SUCH SUBSET OF PROPERTY TYPE
 AS SET FORTH IN THE LOCAL LAW ADOPTED BY THE LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY.
  § 6. Paragraph a of subdivision 4 of section 467-e of the real proper-
 ty tax law, as amended by chapter 483 of the laws of 2007, is amended to
