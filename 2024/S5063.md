 AN  ACT to direct the division of housing and community renewal to study
  state and locally aided housing programs and make recommendations  for
  the  preservation,  modernization  and  increase in the supply of such
  housing; to amend the private housing  finance  law,  in  relation  to
  providing a moratorium on the voluntary dissolution of limited profit,
  limited  dividend  and  redevelopment housing companies; and providing

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent.  New York state and its localities have
 invested  for more than a half century in the creation of low and middle
 income housing to benefit those most in need and to the general  benefit
 of state and local economies. In many cases such housing has fallen into
 disrepair  or  is  being  lost  as  affordable  housing due to statutory
 provisions allowing owners to dissolve housing companies. The unmet need
 for affordable housing is presently greater than  at  any  time  in  the
 state's  history. A temporary moratorium on the dissolution of any hous-
 ing company is necessary for  the  division  of  housing  and  community
 renewal to complete its work and make recommendations.
  §  2.  The division of housing and community renewal shall undertake a
 comprehensive study of the present status of state and locally aided low
 and middle income housing programs and make recommendations with respect
 to the preservation, modernization and expansion of the number of  hous-
 ing units provided by such programs. Such recommendations shall include,
 but  not  be limited to, methods that may be employed by state and local
 governments to retain and expand the existing  inventory  of  state  and
 locally  aided  low  and  middle  income  housing so as to preserve such

 inventory of affordable housing for the persons and families such  hous-
 ing is designed to serve.
  § 3. The division of housing and community renewal shall make a report
 to  the  governor  and  the legislature of its findings, conclusions and
 recommendations no later than one year after the effective date of  this
 act  and  shall  submit with its report such legislative proposals as it
 deems necessary to implement its recommendations.
  § 4. To the maximum extent  feasible,  the  division  of  housing  and
 community  renewal  shall  be  entitled to request and receive and shall
 utilize and be provided with such facilities, resources and data of  any
 court,  department, division, board, bureau, commission or agency of the
 state or any political subdivision thereof as it may reasonably  request
 to carry out properly its responsibilities pursuant to this act.
  §  5.  Section  35  of  the  private housing finance law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 5 to read as follows:
  5. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF  THIS  SECTION,  NO  COMPANY
 SHALL  BE VOLUNTARILY DISSOLVED, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE COMMISSIONER
 OR SUPERVISING AGENCY, AS THE CASE MAY BE.
  § 6. Section 96 of the private  housing  finance  law  is  amended  by
 adding a new subdivision 3 to read as follows:
  3.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER  PROVISION OF THIS SECTION, NO COMPANY
 SHALL BE VOLUNTARILY DISSOLVED OR TERMINATED, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE
 COMMISSIONER.
  § 7. Section 123 of the private housing  finance  law  is  amended  by
 adding a new subdivision 8 to read as follows:
  8.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS SECTION, NO REDEVELOP-
 MENT COMPANY SHALL DISSOLVE OR TERMINATE, WITHOUT  THE  CONSENT  OF  THE
 LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY.
  §  8.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, that sections
 five, six and seven of this act shall  expire  and  be  deemed  repealed
 twenty-four months after it shall have become a law.
