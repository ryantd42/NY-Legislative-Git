 Introduced  by  Sen. SKOUFIS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Housing, Construction  and
  Community Development
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the executive law, in relation to adopting the inter-
  state compact on industrialized/modular buildings
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The executive law is amended by adding a new section 613 to
 read as follows:
  § 613. THE INTERSTATE COMPACT ON INDUSTRIALIZED/MODULAR BUILDINGS. THE
 INTERSTATE COMPACT ON INDUSTRIALIZED/MODULAR BUILDINGS IS HEREBY ENTERED
 INTO  AND ENACTED INTO LAW WITH ALL JURISDICTIONS LEGALLY JOINING THERE-
 IN, IN THE FORM SUBSTANTIALLY AS FOLLOWS:
 
  ARTICLE I. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF POLICY
 
  (1) THE COMPACTING STATES FIND THAT:
  (A) INDUSTRIALIZED/MODULAR BUILDINGS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN  FACTORIES  IN
 THE  VARIOUS STATES AND ARE A GROWING SEGMENT OF THE NATION'S AFFORDABLE
 HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL BUILDING STOCK.
  (B) THE REGULATION OF  INDUSTRIALIZED/MODULAR  BUILDINGS  VARIES  FROM
 STATE  TO  STATE  AND  LOCALITY TO LOCALITY, WHICH CREATES CONFUSION AND
 BURDENS  STATE  AND  LOCAL  BUILDING  OFFICIALS  AND  THE
 INDUSTRIALIZED/MODULAR BUILDING INDUSTRY.
  (C)  REGULATION  BY  MULTIPLE  JURISDICTIONS IMPOSES ADDITIONAL COSTS,
 WHICH  ARE  ULTIMATELY  BORNE  BY  THE  OWNERS  AND  USERS  OF
 INDUSTRIALIZED/MODULAR  BUILDINGS, RESTRICTS MARKET ACCESS, AND DISCOUR-
 AGES THE DEVELOPMENT AND INCORPORATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
  (2) IT IS THE POLICY OF EACH OF THE COMPACTING STATES TO:
  (A) PROVIDE THE STATES WHICH REGULATE THE DESIGN AND  CONSTRUCTION  OF
 INDUSTRIALIZED/MODULAR  BUILDINGS  WITH  A  PROGRAM  TO  COORDINATE  AND
 UNIFORMLY ADOPT AND ADMINISTER THE STATES'  RULES  AND  REGULATIONS  FOR
 SUCH BUILDINGS, ALL IN A MANNER TO ASSURE INTERSTATE RECIPROCITY.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  (B)  PROVIDE  TO  THE  UNITED  STATES  CONGRESS  ASSURANCES THAT WOULD
 PRECLUDE THE NEED FOR A VOLUNTARY PREEMPTIVE FEDERAL  REGULATORY  SYSTEM
 FOR  MODULAR  HOUSING,  AS  OUTLINED  IN  SECTION 572 OF THE HOUSING AND
 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1987, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OF MODEL STAND-
 ARDS  FOR MODULAR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, SUCH THAT DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE
