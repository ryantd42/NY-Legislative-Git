 AN  ACT  to amend the state administrative procedure act, in relation to
  requiring housing affordability impact notes in  relation  to  certain
  rules

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The state administrative procedure act is amended by adding
 a new section 202-g to read as follows:
  § 202-G. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IMPACT  NOTES.  1.  EVERY  RULE,  THE
 PURPOSE  OR  EFFECT  OF  WHICH  IS  TO  INCREASE OR DECREASE THE COST OF
 CONSTRUCTING, PURCHASING, OWNING OR SELLING A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE OR
 A MULTI-UNIT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, EITHER DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY,  SHALL
 BE  ACCOMPANIED  BY  A  BRIEF  EXPLANATORY  STATEMENT OR NOTE THAT SHALL
 INCLUDE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT ON  SUCH  HOUSING.
 THESE STATEMENTS OR NOTES SHALL BE KNOWN AS HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IMPACT
 NOTES.
  2. EVERY STATE AGENCY, EXCLUDING THE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY
 RENEWAL, THE NEW YORK STATE HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, AND THE STATE OF NEW
 YORK MORTGAGE AGENCY, PROPOSING THE ADOPTION, REPEAL OR AMENDMENT OF ANY
 RULE  TO  WHICH SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION APPLIES, SHALL PRESENT A
 COPY OF THE PROPOSAL, WITH  THE  REQUEST  FOR  A  HOUSING  AFFORDABILITY
 IMPACT  NOTE  TO  THE  NEW  YORK STATE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY
 RENEWAL. THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IMPACT NOTE SHALL BE PREPARED BY  THE
 DIVISION  AND  SUBMITTED  TO  THE  AGENCY PROPOSING THE RULE WITHIN FIVE
 CALENDAR DAYS, EXCEPT WHERE, BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF  THE  MEASURE,
 ADDITIONAL  TIME IS REQUIRED FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE HOUSING AFFORDA-
 BILITY IMPACT NOTE. IN SUCH CASE, THE DIVISION MAY INFORM THE AGENCY AND
 THE AGENCY MAY APPROVE AN EXTENSION OF THE TIME WITHIN WHICH THE NOTE IS
 TO BE SUBMITTED, NOT TO EXCEED, HOWEVER, MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS FOLLOWING
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 4835  2
 
 THE DATE OF THE REQUEST. THE DIVISION MAY SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM A  STATE-
 WIDE  TRADE  ORGANIZATION  REPRESENTING THE REAL ESTATE OR HOME BUILDING
 INDUSTRY IN THE PREPARATION OF A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IMPACT NOTE.  IF,
 IN  THE  OPINION  OF  THE DIVISION, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO
 PREPARE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT,  A  STATEMENT  TO
 THAT  EFFECT  CAN  BE  FILED  AND  SHALL  MEET  THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS
 SECTION.
  3. THE NOTE SHALL BE FACTUAL IN NATURE, AS BRIEF AND CONCISE AS POSSI-
 BLE, AND SHALL PROVIDE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE IN DOLLARS  OF  THE  RULE'S
 HOUSING  IMPACT. IN ADDITION, IT SHALL INCLUDE BOTH THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT
 AND, IF DETERMINABLE OR REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, THE LONG  RANGE  EFFECTS
 OF THE MEASURE. A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IMPACT NOTE SHALL BE PREPARED ON
 THE  BASIS OF A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE OR A MULTI-UNIT HOUSING DEVELOP-
 MENT AND MAY INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE FOR A LARGER DEVELOPMENT AS AN ANALYSIS
 OF THE LONG RANGE EFFECT OF A MEASURE. IF, AFTER CAREFUL  INVESTIGATION,
 IT  IS  DETERMINED  THAT  NO DOLLAR ESTIMATE IS POSSIBLE, THE NOTE SHALL
 CONTAIN A STATEMENT TO THAT EFFECT SETTING  FORTH  THE  REASONS  WHY  NO
 DOLLAR  ESTIMATE CAN BE GIVEN. A BRIEF SUMMARY OR WORK SHEET OF COMPUTA-
 TIONS USED IN ARRIVING AT  HOUSING  AFFORDABILITY  IMPACT  NOTE  FIGURES
 SHALL BE INCLUDED.
  4. NO COMMENT OR OPINION SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE HOUSING AFFORDABILI-
 TY  IMPACT  NOTE  WITH REGARD TO THE MERITS OF THE MEASURE FOR WHICH THE
 HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IMPACT NOTE IS  PREPARED;  HOWEVER,  TECHNICAL  OR
 MECHANICAL DEFECTS MAY BE NOTED.
  §  2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
