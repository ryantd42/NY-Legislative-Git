  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 22, 2023, as Water Day in  the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of  environmental
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 22, 2023, as Water
Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
World Water Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Water  holds immense value and is one of the planet's most
precious resources; people utilize water for a variety of purposes every
day, including drinking,  agriculture,  industry,  recreation,  hygiene,
sanitation, and health care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Water  resources  are  limited  and  valuable;  warming
temperatures,  as  well  as  other  natural  and  human-made  stressors,
threaten  to  further  impact the quantity and quality of our water on a
large scale; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Water Day emphasizes the  importance  of  water,  the
role it plays in our lives, and how we can better protect it; this vital
day  of recognition celebrates water while also raising awareness of the
2.2 billion people who do not have access to safe drinking water; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  year  on  March  22nd,  people  and  organizations
commemorate World Water Day by taking action to address the global water
crisis;  a  core  focus  of  this  day  is to support the achievement of
Sustainable Development Goal 6, water and sanitation for all,  by  2030;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Global  access  to  safe  water,  adequate sanitation, and
adequate hygiene resources reduce  disease-related  illness  and  death,
resulting  in  improved  health,  poverty  reduction,  and socioeconomic
development; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  COVID-  19  pandemic  has  highlighted  the  critical
importance  of  universal access to safe water, as handwashing with soap
and water is one of the most effective ways to  prevent  the  spread  of
COVID-  19;  despite  this, many people lack access to these fundamental
necessities,  putting  them  at  risk  of  diseases  related  to  water,
sanitation, and hygiene; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Globally,  2  billion  people  do  not have safely managed
drinking  water  services,  3.6  billion  do  not  have  safely  managed
sanitation services, and 2.3 billion do not have access to a handwashing
facility with water and soap at home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  water  is crucial in daily life, many people are
unaware that much of their water comes from the ground; an estimated 145
million Americans  get  their  tap  water  from  a  groundwater  source;
statewide,  New  Yorkers  use  almost  900  million  gallons  per day of
groundwater; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Life would not be possible without groundwater and we must
therefore protect it from overexploitation; most the world's dry regions
rely solely on groundwater; a considerable percentage of  the  water  we
use for drinking, sanitation, food production, and industrial operations
comes  from  groundwater;  it is also vital for ecosystems like wetlands
and rivers to function properly; and
 
  WHEREAS, Accounting for  approximately  99  percent  of  all  liquid
freshwater  on Earth, groundwater has the potential to provide societies
with  tremendous  social,  economic,  and  environmental  benefits  and
opportunities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  groundwater  already  provides  half  of the
volume of water withdrawn for domestic use  by  the  global  population,
including  the  drinking  water  for  the  vast  majority  of  the rural
population who do not get their water delivered to them  via  public  or
private supply systems, and around 25 percent of all water withdrawn for
irrigation; and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital natural resource is often poorly understood, and
consequently  undervalued,  mismanaged,  and  even  abused, rendering it
vulnerable to depletion and pollution; in the context of  growing  water
scarcity  across  many  parts  of  the  world,  the  vast  potential  of
groundwater and the need to manage  it  sustainably  can  no  longer  be
overlooked; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Small  steps  and local actions collectively improve water
quality for people, wildlife, and the environment; it is imperative that
there be greater awareness of this environmental issue, and more must be
done to increase activity at the local, State and National levels;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 22, 2023,  as  Water
Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of
World Water Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
