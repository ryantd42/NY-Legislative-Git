  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  February  27,  2024,  as  Canadian
Heritage  Day  in  the  State  of New York, in celebration of this great
Empire State's long-standing economic  and  cultural  relationship  with
Canada; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  and Canada share many additional deep economic,
historical, cultural, and familial ties; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York and Canada share an international border measuring
445 miles in length with 17 international  border  crossings,  including
three  of the United States' top 10 busiest border crossings; the border
features many important international  trade  corridors,  including  the
Quebec-New  York Corridor, the Capitol Corridor, and Continental One, as
well as the second-busiest crossing between Canada and the United States
at the Peace Bridge; and
 
  WHEREAS, Canada is New York's  primary  export  market,  with  $24.9
billion in exports and over $42 billion in bilateral trade in 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  relationship has led to 829 Canadian-owned companies
operating in the State of New York employing 58,750 New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, The economies of Canada and New  York  are  tightly  linked
through  integrated  cross-border  supply  chains  that  keep  our firms
competitive; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Canada  and  the  United  States'  mutual  security  and
prosperity rely upon these predictable and secure trading relationships;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States  and  Canada  share  a  long-standing
commitment to working together for our common defense and  security  and
the  continuation  of  this  successful  relationship  through the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is paramount  to  the  future
security  of  the  people of the United States and Canada; this includes
the NORAD Eastern Air Defense Sector, in Rome, NY; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States and Canada have a  shared  commitment  to
protecting the health and well-being of Americans and Canadians and have
agreed  through  a  joint  roadmap  to  strengthen  comprehensive  and
cross-sectoral efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic, collaborate  on
public  health responses, and build resilience against future outbreaks;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Canada and New York also  share  a  commitment  to  equity,
inclusion, and diversity, highlighting it as a source of strength and as
 
a  force  that  can  vanquish intolerance, hate, and radicalism, both at
home and across the globe; this shared virtue can  only  strengthen  the
already robust ties that exist between Canadians and New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  and Canada are committed partners in addressing
the  challenge  of  climate  change  and  creating  a  stronger,  more
sustainable economy through energy trade, shared innovation development,
and aligned policies and goals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Canada  and  New York recently celebrated this partnership
with the groundbreaking of the Champlain Hudson Power Express, a project

million  homes  in New York City, reduce climate emissions equivalent to
removing half a million cars from  New  York's  roads  annually,  create
1,400  jobs during construction and $3.5 billion in economic benefits to
New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 27, 2024, as
