  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Subdivision  1 of section 168-a of the correction law, as

  1. "Sex offender" includes (A) any person who is convicted of  any  of
 the  offenses  set forth in subdivision two or three of this section; OR
 (B) ANY PERSON AGAINST WHOM A VERDICT OF NOT RESPONSIBLE  BY  REASON  OF

 SECTION.  Convictions that result from or are connected  with  the  same
 act, or result from offenses committed at the same time, shall be count-

 pursuant  to  an examination order, the court must direct the sheriff to
 obtain custody of the defendant from the commissioner and to confine the
 defendant pending further order of the court, except that the court  may
 direct  the  sheriff  to confine the defendant in an institution located
 near the place where the court sits if that institution has been  desig-
 nated  by  the  commissioner  as  suitable  for the temporary and secure

 detention of mentally disabled persons. At  such  initial  hearing,  the
 district  attorney  must establish to the satisfaction of the court that
 the defendant has a dangerous mental disorder or is mentally ill. If the

 issue a commitment order, PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT  WHERE  THE  OFFENSE  OR
 OFFENSES  CHARGED IN THE INDICTMENT OR ACCUSATORY INSTRUMENT AGAINST THE

 disorder but is mentally ill, the provisions  of  subdivision  seven  of
 this section shall apply.

 of  the proceedings and at all subsequent proceedings. Having found that
 the defendant is mentally ill, the court must issue an order  of  condi-
 tions  and  an  order  committing  the  defendant  to the custody of the
 commissioner. The latter order shall be deemed an order made pursuant to
 the mental hygiene law and not pursuant to  this  section,  and  further
 retention,  conditional  release or discharge of such defendant shall be
 in accordance with the provisions of the mental  hygiene  law,  PROVIDED
 HOWEVER  THAT WHERE THE OFFENSE OR OFFENSES CHARGED IN THE INDICTMENT OR

 SET  FORTH  IN  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OR THREE OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-
 EIGHT-A OF THE CORRECTION LAW THE ORDER SHALL REQUIRE THE  DEFENDANT  TO

 hearing,  the  court  finds that the defendant does not have a dangerous
 mental disorder and is not mentally ill, the court  must  discharge  the
 defendant  either  unconditionally or subject to an order of conditions,
 PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT WHERE THE  OFFENSE  OR  OFFENSES  CHARGED  IN  THE
 INDICTMENT OR ACCUSATORY INSTRUMENT AGAINST THE DEFENDANT INCLUDE ANY OF
 THE  OFFENSES  SET  FORTH  IN  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OR THREE OF SECTION ONE
 HUNDRED SIXTY-EIGHT-A OF THE CORRECTION LAW THE ORDER SHALL REQUIRE  THE
 DEFENDANT  TO  COMPLY  WITH  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  ARTICLE  SIX-C  OF THE
