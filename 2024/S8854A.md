 MEDICAL  TECHNICIAN  RELATED  SERVICES,  OR A POLICE MEDIC, POLICE MEDIC
 COORDINATOR, POLICE MEDIC SUPERVISOR, BUREAU DIRECTOR  POLICE  EMERGENCY
 AMBULANCE  SERVICES - COUNTY, ASSISTANT BUREAU DIRECTOR POLICE EMERGENCY
 AMBULANCE SERVICES - COUNTY, OR A MEMBER WHO PERFORMS  POLICE  MEDIC  OR
 POLICE  EMERGENCY  AMBULANCE  RELATED  SERVICES  AND  IS EMPLOYED IN THE

 INCURRED  IN  THE PERFORMANCE AND DISCHARGE OF DUTY, UNLESS THE CONTRARY
 CAN BE PROVED BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE.
  § 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to the appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow certain members who are employed in  the  Nassau
 County  police  department  who perform police medic or police emergency
 ambulance related services to receive a performance of  duty  disability
 benefit if the member is impaired due to a condition of the heart, which
 shall  be  presumed  to  have  been incurred in the performance of their
 duties, unless the  contrary  be  proven  by  competent  evidence.  Such
 presumption will benefit the members who currently have the 50% of final
 average  salary  benefit  available  pursuant  to  Section  607-j of the
 Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL).
  The provisions of Section 25 of the RSSL shall not apply.
  If this legislation is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, it
 would likely lead to more disabilities being classified as "in  perform-
 ance of duty."
  We  anticipate  that  there  will be a total increase of approximately
 $27,000 in the annual contributions of Nassau County for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the  bill-
 ing  rates and salary of the affected members change, but is expected to
 average 0.2% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $48,200  which  will  be
 shared by the State of New York and the local participating employers in
 the NYSLERS. This estimate assumes that payment will be made on February
 1, 2025.
  Further,  we  anticipate that there could be some administrative costs
 to implement the provisions of this legislation.
  These estimated costs are based on 110 affected  members  employed  by
 Nassau  County,  with  annual  salary of approximately $15 million as of
 March 31, 2023.
