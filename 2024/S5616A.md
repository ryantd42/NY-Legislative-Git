 AN  ACT  to  amend  the education law, in relation to tuition assistance
  program awards for dual or concurrent enrollment coursework
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The education law is amended by adding a new article 13-D
 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 13-D
  TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AWARDS FOR DUAL ENROLLMENT
  COURSEWORK
 SECTION 645. TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AWARDS FOR  DUAL  OR  CONCURRENT
  ENROLLMENT COURSEWORK.
  §  645.  TUITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM  AWARDS  FOR  DUAL OR CONCURRENT
 ENROLLMENT COURSEWORK. 1. LEGISLATIVE  INTENT.  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY
 FINDS  AND DECLARES IT NECESSARY TO PROMOTE ON TIME AND EARLY GRADUATION
 THROUGH SUPPORTING ACCESS TO COLLEGE-LEVEL COURSES  AND  COLLEGE  DEGREE
 CREDITS  AT  THE  SECONDARY  LEVEL  WITH  INNOVATIVE  PARTNERSHIPS AMONG
 SECONDARY AND POST-SECONDARY SCHOOLS, STAFF AND RESOURCES. THE  LEGISLA-
 TURE  ALSO  VALUES  EARLY COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS, P-TECH PROGRAMS,
 AND OTHER DUAL OR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS WHICH NOT ONLY INCREASE
 STUDENTS' ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT ALSO  REDUCE  POTENTIAL  COSTS
 FOR  STUDENTS  IN  COMPLETING COLLEGE DEGREES BY ALLOWING THEM TO EITHER
 COMPLETE A DEGREE UPON GRADUATION FROM HIGH SCHOOL  OR  TO  APPLY  THEIR
 EARNED  COLLEGE  CREDITS TOWARD A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE. THIS LEGISLATION
 PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO PROCEED TO  COLLEGE  AND
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 5616--A  2
 
 TO  EARN  A  COLLEGE  DEGREE BY ACCELERATING THEIR OVERALL COMPLETION OF
 SUCH A  DEGREE.  IT  ALSO  BETTER  PREPARES  HIGH  SCHOOL  STUDENTS  FOR
 COLLEGE-LEVEL  COURSEWORK,  WHICH  WILL IN TURN, INCREASE THEIR ACADEMIC
 PERFORMANCE. ULTIMATELY, DUAL OR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS INCREASE
 GRADUATION RATES BOTH AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEVELS.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY  FINDS  AND  DECLARES IT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
 FUNDING FOR DUAL OR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS TO ENSURE  ACCESS  TO
 HIGH  QUALITY  PROGRAMMING  THAT  CONTINUES TO INNOVATE AND CONTINUES TO
 GROW THROUGH PERFORMANCE BASED RESULTS.  STUDENTS  WILL  REQUIRE  LESS
 TUITION ASSISTANCE FUNDS (TAP) TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE AT THE POST-SEC-
 ONDARY LEVEL AND POTENTIALLY AVOID  NEW DEBT.
  2.  ESTABLISHMENT  OF DUAL OR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT TUITION ASSISTANCE
 PROGRAM AWARDS.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY RULE, REGULATION,  OR  LAW  TO  THE
 CONTRARY, THE PRESIDENT IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO AWARD DUAL OR CONCURRENT
 ENROLLMENT  PROGRAM  AWARDS FOR PAYMENT ANNUALLY, BEGINNING WITH THE TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE--TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR  ACADEMIC  YEAR  AND  IN
