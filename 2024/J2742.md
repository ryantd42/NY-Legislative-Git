BY: Senator HELMING
 
  COMMENDING  Jack  Crabbe  upon the occasion of his
  designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action in emergency situations to preserve the
lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Jack Crabbe upon the occasion of his designation as recipient of
a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an  individual  by  the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Saturday, August 31, 2024, Jack Crabbe, of  Victor,  New
York,  his  father, and a friend, were enjoying a game of golf at nearby
Ravenwood Golf Course when the 15-year-old's father  suddenly,  with  no
indication  of  a problem, collapsed on the green and stopped breathing;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Without hesitation, high  school  sophomore,  Jack  Crabbe,
shouted  for  help  and called 9-1-1, providing important information to
the operator; following the operator's instructions,  this  brave  young
man  commenced  CPR,  an  important  skill he had learned at Victor High
School just the previous year; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the only individual on the golf course who knew  how  to
administer  this  life-saving  technique,  Jack  Crabbe  maintained  the
recommended rhythm of  100-120  chest  compressions  per  minute;  other
golfers  and golf course staff members lent support, counting along with
the teen hero for three or four minutes; and
 
  WHEREAS, First responders arrived and employed an automated external
defibrillator (AED) to restart  the  49-year-old  father's  heart  after
which  he  was  transported to University of Rochester Medicine's Strong
Memorial Hospital where  experts  restored  his  heart's  function;  the
cardiologists  credited  Jack  Crabbe on his quick and decisive actions,
providing a successful outcome; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  a  well-established  fact  that  the  first  several
minutes  of  cardiac  arrest  are  the most crucial in the prevention of
long-lasting symptoms and potential fatality; according to the  American
Heart  Association,  more  than 350,000 individuals in the United States
experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrests annually,  and  the  survival
rate  is  only 10 percent; CPR can double a victim's chances of survival
but, unfortunately, is administered in less than half of the cases; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  This  noble  and  heroic teenager can now continue to play
golf  with  his  father;  enjoying  baseball  and  football,  he  has
participated  in  various  baseball  leagues  outside  of school; he was
recently honored as the inaugural Blue Devil of the Day, a program  that
recognizes  and  celebrates  student-athletes,  coaches,  fans,  and
supporters of Victor Athletics, all of whom champion  courage,  respect,
and resilience while inspiring and empowering others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jack  Crabbe's mother credits her son with saving not only
his father's life but also the family; the  Crabbe  family  hopes  their
story will inspire others to learn and become certified in CPR training;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  Jack  Crabbe's  noble  and  courageous actions, a
precious life was saved, and a seemingly  dire  situation  had  positive
results;  this  humble hero's intervention is a reminder of the profound
impact which kindness and preparedness can have in our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jack Crabbe, in his spontaneous  and  heroic  act,  has  so
aptly  demonstrated  his  character  and  compassion  for the welfare of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond without thought of danger or reward when others need help;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Jack Crabbe upon the occasion of his designation as recipient of
a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an  individual  by  the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Jack Crabbe.
