  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 5-11, 2023, as School Social  Worker  Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  School social workers serve as vital members of a school's
education team, playing a central role in creating partnerships  between
the home, school, and community to ensure student academic success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  social workers are especially skilled in providing
services to students who face  serious  challenges  to  school  success,
including  disability,  poverty,  discrimination, abuse, neglect, mental
illness, homelessness, bullying, familial stressors, and other  barriers
to learning; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School social workers are more necessary now than any time
in recent memory, as  more  students  are  struggling  with  mental  and
behavioral  health  disorders,  with  nearly one in six children, two to
eight years old (17.4%),  having  a  diagnosed  mental,  behavioral,  or
developmental disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Those  who wish to access community mental health services
often find them unavailable, inaccessible, or inadequate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  mental  health  programs  are  critical  to  early
identification of and early intervention for mental health problems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  social  workers,  being  licensed  mental  health
professionals  in  our  schools,  provide  necessary  assessment,
interventions, counseling, family outreach, and community referrals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  social workers are part of the New York State Safe
Schools Task Force because their knowledge of school culture and  school
climate are necessary for responsible school safety planning; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  social workers contribute to increasing graduation
rates in  New  York,  including  an  eighty-three  percent  high  school
graduation rate in 2020, and a dropout rate of just six percent; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Research  indicates  that  school  mental  health programs
improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, dropout  rates  and
discipline referrals, while improving academic achievement; and
 
  WHEREAS, The celebration of School Social Worker Week highlights the
vital  role  school  social workers play in the lives of students in New
York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March 5-11, 2023, as
School Social Worker Week in the State of New York,  and  to  honor  and
recognize  the  contributions of school social workers to the success of
students in schools across the State, as well as encourage the people of
New York State to observe School Social  Worker  Week  with  appropriate
activities  that  promote  awareness  of the vital role of school social
 
workers, in schools and in the community helping  students  prepare  for
their futures as productive, engaged citizens; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
