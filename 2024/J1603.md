  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2024, as Preparedness Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2024, as Preparedness  Month
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Preparedness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  the month of September, the American Red Cross
encourages individuals to  take  action  to  plan  and  prepare  for  an
emergency and to donate blood; and
 
  WHEREAS, Disasters can strike at any time and being prepared is both
a  family's and an individual's best defense; supporting Red Cross blood
donation or giving blood is  also  critical  to  community  preparedness
since hospitals need blood to respond to patient need; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Red Cross was founded in 1881, by Clara Barton
and is the United States' premier emergency response organization; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  United  States, approximately four million people
give blood to the Red Cross, making it the largest supplier of blood and
blood products in the Nation; all types are needed  daily,  but  type  O
negative, the universal blood type, is frequently in high demand; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  years,  the American Red Cross, which relies on
donations of time, money and blood, has expanded its services, including
Disaster Services, with which this vital organization  supports  victims
of  disasters  such  as  fires,  floods,  earthquakes,  heat  waves  and
hurricanes; and
 
  WHEREAS, This much needed support helps to pick up the pieces  after
the  disaster  and may take the form of medical help, food safety, water
treatment, financial help, and emergency accommodation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Red Cross recommends three simple  actions  to
prepare  for  weather-related  disaster events and emergencies such as a
house fire: make a plan, build a kit, and be informed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hurricane Ida was  a  deadly  and  destructive  Category  4
Atlantic  hurricane  that  became  the  second-most damaging and intense
hurricane to strike the  U.S.  state  of  Louisiana  on  record,  behind
Hurricane Katrina; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  August  29,  2021,  the  18th anniversary of Hurricane
Katrina,  Ida  made  landfall  near  Port  Fourchon,  Louisiana;  as  of
September  7th,  a total of 97 deaths have been confirmed in relation to
Ida, including 77 in the United States and 20 in Venezuela; and
 
  WHEREAS, After the storm passed,  thousands  of  crew  members  were
deployed  in  Louisiana,  and  hundreds were rescued; power outages were
 
expected to last weeks, possibly up to a month and states  of  emergency
were declared for Louisiana and portions of the Northeast; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  extremely  important  that  this  Legislative Body
properly informs all New Yorkers to observe Preparedness Month by taking
action and having a plan before disaster happens; it is also  imperative
to  keep  pets  safe  from  danger  and communicate efficiently during a
disaster; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2024,  as
Preparedness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
