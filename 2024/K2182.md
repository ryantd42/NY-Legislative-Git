  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 15, 2024, as Water Safety Day in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness  of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 15, 2024, as Water Safety  Day  in
the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
International Water Safety Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, International Water Safety Day is an opportunity  to  raise
awareness  of  the  vital  necessity  for  water safety and the critical
impact water education can have on individuals when in and around water;
and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the World Health Organization, drowning is the
3rd leading cause of unintentional injury  death  worldwide,  accounting
for  7% of all injury-related deaths, and there are an estimated 236,000
annual drowning deaths worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recent  years,  the  United  States  Center  of  Disease
Control  estimated  an  average  of  3,536 fatal unintentional drownings
(non-boating related) annually in the United States, resulting in  about
10 deaths per day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Research has found that early swimming skills help prevent
drowning, including  from  The  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics  which
recommends  swim lessons for many children starting at age 1; a study in
the journal,  JAMA  Pediatrics  and  Adolescent  Medicine  found  formal
swimming  lessons  reduced  the likelihood of childhood drowning by 88%;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages  1
to  4,  and  the  second leading cause of unintentional injury death for
children ages 5-14; for every child that dies from drowning,  there  are
approximately  seven non-fatal drownings that require emergency care and
can result in long-term health problems; and
 
  WHEREAS, Drowning death rates for Black people are 1.5 times  higher
than  the  rates  for  white people, with this disparity even higher for
children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People  with  disabilities,  special  needs,  and  certain
medical  conditions are at an even higher risk of drowning; awareness of
risks, land-based water safety education, and  formal  swim  instruction
can collectively reduce drowning; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New York is dedicated to taking tremendous
steps to help promote water  safety  and  increase  drowning  prevention
through  legislation  and  shall  continue to advocate and promote water
 
safety, whether it be at a pool, lake, ocean, or anywhere where a person
may swim; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Simple  water  safety  tips  like  utilizing  caution when
walking near water, always swimming with a buddy, making sure there is a
lifeguard or someone watching you in the water, jumping into water  feet
first,  wearing  a  lifejacket  if  needed,  and  of course, learning to
properly swim, among other tips, can save lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fatal and non-fatal drowning are  serious  health  problems
and  epidemics,  and  National Water Safety Month is an annual awareness
campaign to highlight water awareness and swim safety with the  hope  of
reducing harm and casualties relating to swimming and drowning; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body reaffirms its commitment to fostering
continuing  attention  to water safety in New York State, and encourages
all New Yorkers to participate in Water Safety Day in the State  of  New
York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May  15,  2024,  as  Water
Safety Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York,  and various water safety-based organizations throughout the State
of New York.
