Senate Resolution No. 1758
 
BY: Senator RHOADS
 
  COMMENDING  Carter  Santelmo  upon the occasion of
  his designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Carter  Santelmo  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On  April  1,  2023,  seven-year-old  Carter  Santelmo,  of
Levittown,  New  York, his four-year-old brother, Maxwell, their mother,
aunt, and two cousins were enjoying recreation in a swimming pool  while
on  vacation  in  Florida; both mothers conscientiously supervised their
children, especially since there was no lifeguard present; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  Carter  Santelmo's  mother  was  vigilant,  her
attention was temporarily diverted; no one noticed that Maxwell Santelmo
removed  his  swim  vest and jumped into the deep end of the pool; there
were no witnesses to the frightening battle for survival that  was  soon
followed by stillness; and
 
  WHEREAS, It was Carter Santelmo, wearing goggles and swimming in the
deep end, who discovered his unconscious younger brother's body floating
in  the  water; without hesitation, he pulled his sibling to the wall of
the pool and cried out to his mother for help; and
 
  WHEREAS, The small child was held upright until the  rescue  service
personnel  arrived  on  the  scene  just  a  few  minutes  after  being
dispatched; Carter Santelmo's brother  was  admitted  to  the  Pediatric
Intensive  Care  Unit  (PICU)  for  observation  and discharged two days
later; there was no accurate determination of the  amount  of  time  the
little boy was submerged in the water; and
 
  WHEREAS, For the expediency with which Carter Santelmo acted to save
his  brother,  the  Northside  Elementary  School  second-grade  student
received a standing ovation  from  family  members  and  loved  ones  in
attendance  at  the  Levittown Board of Education's meeting; his bravery
was acknowledged throughout the  school;  for  his  quick  thinking  and
selfless deed, he now has the nickname "Captain" Carter; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  was  even a post by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's
Office (PBSO), honoring this young hero's bravery  and  decisive  action
with the Samaritan Award as part of the PBSO Annual Awards ceremony; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Carter Santelmo, in his spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated his character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without thought of danger or reward when others need help; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Carter  Santelmo  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Carter Santelmo.
