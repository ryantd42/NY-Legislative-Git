  2.  No sooner than thirty days and not later than sixty days after the
 receipt by a local government of an application,  and  after  notice  of
 application has been published by the applicant in two newspapers having
 a  general  circulation in the area, the local government OR THE COMMIS-
 SIONER  shall  hold  a  public hearing on such application at a suitable
 location in the local government where the affected wetland is  situated
 unless  no  notice  of  objection  has  been  filed or unless the [local
 government finds the] activity HAS BEEN FOUND to  be  of  such  a  minor
 nature  as  not  to affect or endanger the balance of systems within the
 wetlands, in which case the local government OR THE COMMISSIONER may, in
 the exercise of discretion, dispense with such hearing. Where the  local
 government  OR THE COMMISSIONER finds that a hearing is not necessary, a

 rules  and  regulations  adopted  thereunder,  the rules and regulations
 adopted by the department pursuant to  this  article  to  implement  its

 and revocations shall govern permit  administration  by  the  department
 under  this  article,  provided  however,  that after the department has
 given notice to an applicant that an application  is  complete,  or  the
 application  is  deemed  complete, the applicant shall cause a notice of
