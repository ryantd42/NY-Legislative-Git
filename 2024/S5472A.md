 APPROPRIATE PERIOD OF TIME, BUT IN NO EVENT BEYOND AN ADDITIONAL  THIRTY
 DAYS.
  §  2.  Subdivision  7  of section 460-d of the social services law, as
 added by chapter 669 of the laws of 1977, paragraph (a)  as  amended  by
 chapter 719 of the laws of 1989, paragraph (b) as amended by chapter 524
 of the laws of 1984, subparagraph 2 of paragraph (b) as amended by chap-
 ter 733 of the laws of 1994, is amended to read as follows:
  7.  (a)  The  department  shall  adopt  regulations establishing civil
 penalties of up to [one] TWO thousand dollars PER VIOLATION,  per  day
 AND  FOR  REPEAT  VIOLATIONS, UNDER SUBPARAGRAPH TWO OF PARAGRAPH (C) OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION FOR WHICH A PRIOR PENALTY WAS ASSESSED, AN AMOUNT UP TO
 FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION, PER DAY to be assessed against  all
 adult  care  facilities [except facilities operated by a social services
 district] for violations of (i) regulations of the department pertaining
 to the care of residents in  such  facilities,  (ii)  paragraph  (a)  of
 subdivision  three of section four hundred sixty-one-a of this [chapter]
 ARTICLE, or (iii) an order issued pursuant to subdivision eight of  this
 section. The regulations shall specify the violations subject to penalty
 and  the  amount  of  the penalty to be assessed in connection with each
 such violation and shall specify that only  civil  penalties  of  up  to
 [one]  TWO  thousand  dollars [per day] per violation, PER DAY, shall be
 assessed pursuant to this paragraph against an adult care facility found
 responsible for an act of retaliation or reprisal against any  resident,
 employee,  or  other  person for having filed a complaint with or having
 provided information to any long term care [patient] ombudsman function-
 ing in accordance with section [five hundred forty-four or five  hundred
 forty-five] TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN of the [executive] ELDER law.
  (b)  [(1)] In addition to any other civil or criminal penalty provided
 by law, the department shall have the power to assess civil penalties in
 accordance with its regulations adopted pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of
 this  subdivision,  after  a  hearing  conducted  in accordance with the
 procedures established by regulations of the department. Such procedures
 shall require that notice of the time and place of the hearing, together
 with a statement of charges of violations, shall be served in person  or
 by  certified  mail addressed to the facility at least thirty days prior
 to the date of the hearing. The statement of charges of violations shall
 set forth the existence of the violations, the  amount  of  penalty  for
 which  it may become liable and the steps which must be taken to rectify
 the violation and, where applicable, a  statement  that  the  department
 contends  that  a penalty may be imposed under this paragraph regardless
 of rectification. An answer to the charges of  violations,  in  writing,
 shall  be filed with the department, not less than ten days prior to the
 date of hearing. The answer shall notify the department of  the  facili-
 ty's  position with respect to each of the charges and shall include all
 matters which if not disclosed in the answer would be likely to take the
 department by surprise. The commissioner, or  a  member  of  [his]  SUCH
 COMMISSIONER'S  staff  who  is  designated  and authorized by [him] SUCH
 COMMISSIONER to hold such hearing,  may  in  [his]  SUCH  COMMISSIONER'S
 discretion  allow  the  facility to prove any matter not included in the
 answer.
  (C) (1) Where the facility satisfactorily demonstrates that it  either
 had  rectified  the  violations  within thirty days of receiving written
 notification of the results of the inspection pursuant to  section  four
 hundred  sixty-one-a  of this [chapter] ARTICLE, or had submitted within
 thirty days an acceptable plan for rectification and was rectifying  the
 violations  in accordance with the steps and within the additional peri-
 S. 5472--A  3
 
 ods of time as accepted by the department in such plan, no penalty shall
 be imposed, except as provided in subparagraph two of this paragraph.
  (2)  Rectification  shall  not preclude the assessment of a penalty if
 the department establishes at a hearing  that  a  particular  violation,
 although  corrected[,  endangered or resulted in harm to any resident as
 the result of]:
  (i) ENDANGERED ANY RESIDENT. ENDANGERMENT IS DEFINED AS:
  (A) the total or substantial failure of the facility's fire  detection
 or  prevention systems, or emergency evacuation procedures prescribed by
 department safety standard regulations;
  [(ii)] (B) the retention of any resident who has been evaluated by the
 resident's physician as being medically or mentally unsuited for care in
 the facility or as requiring placement  in  a  hospital  or  residential
 health  care facility and for whom the operator is not making persistent
 efforts to secure appropriate placement;
  [(iii)] (C) the failure in systemic  practices  and  procedures  WHICH
 SHALL  BE  DEFINED AS WIDESPREAD OR CHRONIC, AND MATERIAL, NONCOMPLIANCE
 WITH STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO
 THE  RIGHTS  OF RESIDENTS UNDER SECTION FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE-D OF THIS
 ARTICLE;
  [(iv)] (D) the failure of the operator to take actions as required  by
 department regulations in the event of a resident's illness or accident;
  [(v)]  (E)  the failure of the operator to provide at all times super-
 vision of residents by numbers of staff at least equivalent to the night
 staffing requirement set forth in department regulations; or
  [(vi)] (F) [unreasonable] threats of retaliation or taking  reprisals,
 including  but  not  limited  to  [unreasonable]  threats of eviction or
 hospitalization, against any resident,  employee  or  other  person  who
 makes  a  complaint  concerning the operation of an adult care facility,
 participates in the investigation of a complaint or is the subject of an
 action identified in a complaint[.
  The department shall specify in its regulations those  regulations  to
 which this subparagraph two shall apply.
  (3)  In assessing penalties pursuant to this paragraph, the department
 shall consider promptness of  rectification,  delay  occasioned  by  the
 department, and the specific circumstances of the violations as mitigat-
 ing factors.
  (c)]; OR
  (II) RESULTED IN HARM TO ANY RESIDENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

 ONE-O OF THIS CHAPTER; OR

 DEPARTMENT, AND THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VIOLATIONS AS MITIGAT-
 ING FACTORS.
  (E) Upon the request of  the  department,  the  attorney  general  may
 commence  an  action  in any court of competent jurisdiction against any

 person  or  corporation operating such facility, for the recovery of any
 penalty assessed by the department in accordance with the provisions  of
 this subdivision.
  [(d)]  (F) Any such penalty assessed by the department may be released
 or compromised by the department, SUBJECT TO AND CONSISTENT  WITH  PARA-
 GRAPH  (C)  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION, before the matter has been referred to
 the attorney general, and where such matter has  been  referred  to  the

 by the attorney general, AFTER CONSIDERING PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS  SUBDI-
 VISION AND with the consent of the department.
  §  3.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision 9 of section 460-d of the

  (a) The department shall have authority to impose a civil penalty [not
 exceeding  one  thousand dollars per day] CONSISTENT WITH SECTION TWELVE

 closing of, after notice and opportunity to be heard, any facility which
 does  not possess a valid operating certificate issued by the department
 and is an adult care facility subject to the provisions of this  article
 and  the  regulations of the department. A hearing shall be conducted in
 accordance with procedures established by department  regulations  which
 procedures  shall  require  that  notice  of  the determination that the
 facility is an adult care facility and the  reasons  for  such  determi-
 nation  and  notice  of  the  time and place of the hearing be served in
 person on the operator, owner or prime lessor, if any, or  by  certified
 mail, return receipt requested, addressed to such person and received at
 least  twenty  days  prior to the date of the hearing. If such operator,
 owner or prime lessor, if any, is not  known  to  the  department,  then
 service  may  be  made  by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place
 within the facility or by sending a  copy  thereof  by  certified  mail,
 return receipt requested, addressed to the facility. A written answer to
 the  notice  of violation may be filed with the department not less than
 five days prior to the date of the hearing.  Demonstration by the facil-
 ity that it possessed an operating certificate issued pursuant  to  this
 article,  article  twenty-eight  of  the  public  health  law or article
 sixteen, [twenty-three,] thirty-one or thirty-two of the mental  hygiene
 law  at  the  time the hearing was commenced shall constitute a complete
 defense to any charges made pursuant to this subdivision.

 days  after  the  department  provides  the operator, in writing, with a
 summary of the inspection of the facility by which the department deter-
 mined that he or she is operating an uncertified adult  care  facility.]
 The  submission  of  an  application  by  the  operator for an operating
 certificate for the facility shall not act as a bar to the imposition of
 a penalty against the operator OF AN UNLICENSED ADULT CARE FACILITY.

 services  law  is  amended  by adding a new subparagraph (iv) to read as

 INSPECTION AND MAY TAKE ANY APPROPRIATE ACTION  IF  IT  DETERMINES  THAT
 SUCH  DANGER  EXISTS  OR IS LIKELY TO ARISE, INCLUDING ISSUING A WRITTEN
 NOTICE DIRECTING THE OPERATOR, ADMINISTRATOR OR OTHER PERSON  IN  CHARGE
 OF SUCH FACILITY TO CEASE OR CORRECT THE CONDITION OR ACTIVITY AT ISSUE.
 AS  PROMPTLY  AS  POSSIBLE  THEREAFTER,  WITHIN  A  PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED
