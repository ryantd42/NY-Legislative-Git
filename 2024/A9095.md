  §  2.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 1 of article 5 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  Section 1. The comptroller and attorney-general shall be chosen at the
 same general election as the governor and hold office for the same term,
 and shall possess the qualifications provided in section  2  of  article
 IV. The legislature shall provide for filling vacancies in the office of
 comptroller  and of attorney-general. No election of a comptroller or an
 attorney-general shall be had except at the time of electing a governor.
 NO PERSON SHALL BE ELECTED TO THE OFFICE OF COMPTROLLER OR ATTORNEY-GEN-
 ERAL WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ELECTED TO  SUCH  OFFICE  MORE  THAN  THREE
 TIMES,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  ANY  TERM ALREADY SERVED BY A SITTING COMP-
 TROLLER OR ATTORNEY-GENERAL PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS  TO  THIS  SECTION
 BEING  APPROVED  AND RATIFIED BY THE PEOPLE AND COMING INTO EFFECT SHALL
 BE EXCLUDED FROM THE LIMITS ON SERVICE SET FORTH BY  THIS  SECTION.  The
 comptroller  shall be required: (1) to audit all vouchers before payment
 and all official accounts; (2) to audit the accrual  and  collection  of
 all revenues and receipts; and (3) to prescribe such methods of account-
 ing  as  are  necessary for the performance of the foregoing duties. The
 payment of any money of the state, or of any money under its control, or
 the refund of any money paid to the state,  except  upon  audit  by  the
 comptroller,  shall  be void, and may be restrained upon the suit of any
 taxpayer with the consent of the supreme court in appellate division  on
 notice  to  the  attorney-general. In such respect the legislature shall
 define the powers and duties and may also assign  to  him  or  her:  (1)
 supervision  of  the accounts of any political subdivision of the state;
 and (2) powers and duties pertaining to or connected with the assessment
 and taxation of real estate, including determination of ratios which the
 assessed valuation of taxable real property bears to the full  valuation
 thereof,  but  not  including any of those powers and duties reserved to
 officers of a county, city, town or village by virtue of [sections seven
 and eight] SECTION ONE of article nine AND SECTION THIRTEEN  OF  ARTICLE
 THIRTEEN  of  this  constitution. The legislature shall assign to him or
 her no administrative duties, excepting such as may be incidental to the
 performance of these functions, any other provision of this constitution
 to the contrary notwithstanding.
  § 3.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing be  referred
 to  the  first  regular  legislative  session  convening  after the next
 succeeding general election of members of the assembly, and, in conform-
 ity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3
 months previous to the time of such election.
