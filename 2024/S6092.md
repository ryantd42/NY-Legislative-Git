  Section  1.  Section  168-a of the correction law is amended by adding
 two new subdivisions 19 and 20 to read as follows:
  19. "HOMELESS SEX OFFENDER" MEANS A PERSON REQUIRED TO REGISTER  AS  A
 SEX  OFFENDER  WHO  DOES  NOT  HAVE  A  REGISTERABLE  RESIDENCE. FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION A REGISTERABLE RESIDENCE IS  AN  ADDRESS  WHERE
 THE SEX OFFENDER ACTUALLY RESIDES AND WHERE THE SEX OFFENDER MAY RECEIVE
 MAIL.  SHOULD  A  SEX  OFFENDER HAVE AN ADDRESS WHERE HE OR SHE ACTUALLY
 RESIDES THAT THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE DOES NOT DELIVER MAIL, BUT
 SUCH SEX OFFENDER DOES MAINTAIN A VALID POSTAL BOX TO RECEIVE HIS OR HER
 MAIL, THEN SUCH OFFENDER  SHALL  NOT  BE  CONSIDERED  HOMELESS  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.
  20.  "SEX  OFFENDER REGISTRATION OFFICER" MEANS A PERSON DESIGNATED BY
 THE COUNTY TO COLLECT INFORMATION REGARDING THE LOCATION OF HOMELESS SEX
 OFFENDERS AND REPORT SUCH TO THE  DIVISION  FOR  INCLUSION  ON  THE  SEX
 OFFENDER  REGISTRY.  THE  SEX  OFFENDER  REGISTRATION OFFICER SHALL ALSO
 PROVIDE, ON BEHALF OF THE  DIVISION,  NECESSARY  NOTIFICATIONS  TO  SUCH
 OFFENDERS.  SEX  OFFENDER  REGISTRATION OFFICERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO SHARE
 INFORMATION REGARDING THE LOCATION OF HOMELESS SEX OFFENDERS WITH  OTHER
 SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION OFFICERS WITHIN THE STATE, AS WELL AS WITH THE
 DIVISION AND ANY AND ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, PROBATION AND PAROLE.
 THE  SEX  OFFENDER  REGISTRATION OFFICER MAY DESIGNATE AGENTS, INCLUDING
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO A LAW  ENFORCEMENT  AGENCY  HAVING  JURISDICTION,  TO
 FACILITATE THE COLLECTION OF LOCATION INFORMATION, AS WELL AS FACILITATE
