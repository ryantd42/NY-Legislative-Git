  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph 1 of subdivision  g  of  section  26-405  of  the
 administrative  code  of the city of New York is amended by adding a new
 subparagraph (p) to read as follows:
  (P) ADJUSTMENTS MADE PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (G)  OF  THIS  PARAGRAPH
 SHALL  BE  COLLECTIBLE  UPON  THE LANDLORD'S FILING OF A REPORT WITH THE
 CITY RENT AGENCY, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBPARAGRAPH (E) OF PARA-
 GRAPH TWO OF SUBDIVISION A OF THIS SECTION AND VERIFICATION BY THE  CITY
 RENT  AGENCY,  IN  COLLABORATION  WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR
 INSPECTING BUILDINGS, THAT THE APPLICANT DOES NOT HAVE MORE THAN  THIRTY
 CLASS A HOUSING CODE VIOLATIONS OR A CLASS B OR C HOUSING CODE VIOLATION
 ON  THE  PROPERTY.  OUTSTANDING  HOUSING  CODE VIOLATIONS THAT ARE FOUND
 SHALL BE CLEARED, CORRECTED OR ABATED BY THE LANDLORD  AND  VERIFIED  BY
 THE  CITY  RENT  AGENCY  PRIOR TO AUTHORIZATION OF A RENT INCREASE UNDER

 increase established under this law provided, however, that such  crite-
 ria  shall  provide  (a) as to hardship applications, for a finding that
 the level of fair rent increase is not sufficient to enable the owner to
 maintain  approximately  the same average annual net income (which shall
 be computed without regard to debt service, financing costs  or  manage-
 ment  fees)  for the three year period ending on or within six months of
 the date of an application pursuant to such criteria  as  compared  with
 annual  net income, which prevailed on the average over the period nine-
 teen hundred sixty-eight through nineteen hundred seventy,  or  for  the
 first three years of operation if the building was completed since nine-
 teen  hundred  sixty-eight  or  for the first three fiscal years after a
 transfer of title to a new owner provided the new owner can establish to
 the satisfaction of the commissioner that he or she  acquired  title  to
 the  building as a result of a bona fide sale of the entire building and
 that the new owner is unable to obtain requisite records for the  fiscal
 years  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight  through  nineteen hundred seventy
 despite diligent efforts to obtain same from predecessors in  title  and
 further  provided that the new owner can provide financial data covering
 a minimum of six years under his or  her  continuous  and  uninterrupted
 operation  of  the building to meet the three year to three year compar-
 ative test periods herein provided; and (b) as  to  completed  building-
 wide  major  capital  improvements, for a finding that such improvements
 are deemed depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code and that the cost
 is to be amortized over a twelve-year period for a building  with  thir-
 ty-five  or  fewer housing accommodations, or a twelve and one-half-year
 period for a building with more than thirty-five housing accommodations,
 for any determination issued by the division of  housing  and  community
 renewal  after  the effective date of the the chapter of the laws of two
 thousand nineteen that amended this paragraph and shall be removed  from
 the  legal regulated rent thirty years from the date the increase became
 effective inclusive of any increases  granted  by  the  applicable  rent
 guidelines board. Temporary major capital improvement increases shall be
 collectible  prospectively on the first day of the first month beginning
 sixty days from the date of mailing notice of approval  to  the  tenant.
 Such  notice  shall  disclose the total monthly increase in rent and the
 first month in which the tenant would be required to pay  the  temporary
 increase. An approval for a temporary major capital improvement increase
 shall  not  include retroactive payments. The collection of any increase
 shall not exceed two percent in any year from the effective date of  the
 order  granting  the increase over the rent set forth in the schedule of
 gross rents, with collectability of any dollar excess above said sum  to
 be  spread forward in similar increments and added to the rent as estab-
 lished or set in future years.  Upon vacancy, the landlord may  add  any
 remaining balance of the temporary major capital improvement increase to
 the  legal  regulated  rent.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the
 law, for any renewal lease commencing on or after  June  14,  2019,  the
 collection  of  any rent increases due to any major capital improvements
 approved on or after June 16, 2012 and before June 16,  2019  shall  not
 exceed  two  percent in any year for any tenant in occupancy on the date
 the major capital improvement was approved or based upon  cash  purchase
 price  exclusive of interest or service charges. THE DIVISION OF HOUSING
 AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL SHALL REQUIRE THE SUBMISSION OF A REPORT BY  LAND-
 LORDS APPLYING FOR A RENT INCREASE FOR MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PURSU-
 ANT  TO  THIS  PARAGRAPH  AND SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY THE DIVISION OF
 HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL, IN COLLABORATION WITH  LOCAL  AUTHORITIES
 RESPONSIBLE FOR INSPECTING BUILDINGS, CERTIFYING THAT THERE ARE NOT MORE
 S. 6043  3
 
 THAN  THIRTY  CLASS A HOUSING CODE VIOLATIONS NOR A CLASS B OR C HOUSING
 CODE VIOLATION ON THE PROPERTY, PRIOR TO  RECEIVING  APPROVAL  FOR  SUCH
 RENT  INCREASE.  Where  an  application  for  a  temporary major capital
 improvement increase has been filed, a tenant shall have sixty days from
 the  date  of  mailing of a notice of a proceeding in which to answer or
 reply. The state division of housing and community renewal shall provide
 any responding tenant with the reasons for the  division's  approval  or
 denial  of  such  application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
 contained herein, no hardship increase granted pursuant  to  this  para-
 graph  shall, when added to the annual gross rents, as determined by the
 commissioner, exceed the sum of, (i) the annual operating expenses, (ii)
 an allowance for management services as determined by the  commissioner,
 (iii) actual annual mortgage debt service (interest and amortization) on
 its  indebtedness  to  a  lending  institution,  an insurance company, a
 retirement fund or welfare fund which is operated under the  supervision
 of  the banking or insurance laws of the state of New York or the United
 States, and (iv) eight and one-half percent of that portion of the  fair
 market  value  of the property which exceeds the unpaid principal amount
 of the mortgage indebtedness referred to in subparagraph (iii)  of  this
 paragraph. Fair market value for the purposes of this paragraph shall be
 six  times  the annual gross rent. The collection of any increase in the
 stabilized rent for any apartment pursuant to this paragraph  shall  not
 exceed  six  percent  in  any  year from the effective date of the order
 granting the increase over the rent set forth in the schedule  of  gross
 rents,  with  collectability  of  any dollar excess above said sum to be
 spread forward in similar increments and added to the stabilized rent as
 established or set in future years;
  § 3. Subdivision d of section 6 of section 4 of  chapter  576  of  the
 laws  of 1974, constituting the emergency tenant protection act of nine-
 teen seventy-four, is amended by adding a new paragraph  6  to  read  as
 follows:
  (6)  ADJUSTMENTS  MADE  PURSUANT  TO PARAGRAPH (3) OF THIS SUBDIVISION
 SHALL BE COLLECTABLE UPON THE LANDLORD'S FILING OF  A  REPORT  WITH  THE
 STATE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL AND SUBJECT TO VERIFICA-
 TION  BY THE STATE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL, IN COLLAB-
 ORATION WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES  RESPONSIBLE  FOR  INSPECTING  BUILDINGS,
 THAT  THE  APPLICANT DOES NOT HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY CLASS A HOUSING CODE
 VIOLATIONS OR A CLASS B OR C HOUSING CODE  VIOLATION  ON  THE  PROPERTY.
 OUTSTANDING  HOUSING  CODE  VIOLATIONS  THAT ARE FOUND SHALL BE CLEARED,
 CORRECTED OR ABATED BY THE LANDLORD AND VERIFIED BY THE  STATE  DIVISION
 OF  HOUSING  AND  COMMUNITY  RENEWAL  PRIOR  TO  AUTHORIZATION OF A RENT
 INCREASE UNDER PARAGRAPH (3) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 4. The second undesignated paragraph of paragraph (a) of subdivision
 4 of section 4 of chapter 274 of the  laws  of  1946,  constituting  the
 emergency  housing  rent control law, as amended by section 25 of part B
 of chapter 97 of the laws of 2011, subparagraph 5 as amended by  section
 36  of  part  Q  of  chapter 39, subparagraph 7 as separately amended by
 section 25 of part Q of chapter 39 and section 14 of part K  of  chapter
 36 and subparagraph 8 as amended by section 8 of part K of chapter 36 of
 the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  No application for adjustment of maximum rent based upon a sales price
 valuation  shall  be filed by the landlord under this subparagraph prior
 to six months from the date of such sale of the property.  In  addition,
 no  adjustment  ordered  by  the  commission based upon such sales price
 valuation shall be effective prior to one year from  the  date  of  such
 sale.  Where,  however,  the assessed valuation of the land exceeds four
 S. 6043  4
 
 times the assessed valuation of the buildings  thereon,  the  commission
 may determine a valuation of the property equal to five times the equal-
 ized  assessed  valuation  of  the  buildings,  for the purposes of this
 subparagraph. The commission may make a determination that the valuation
 of  the  property  is  an  amount different from such equalized assessed
 valuation where there is a request for  a  reduction  in  such  assessed
 valuation  currently pending; or where there has been a reduction in the
 assessed valuation for the year next preceding the effective date of the
 current assessed valuation in effect at the time of the  filing  of  the
 application.  Net  annual return shall be the amount by which the earned
 income exceeds the operating expenses of the property,  excluding  mort-
 gage  interest  and  amortization, and excluding allowances for obsoles-
 cence and reserves, but including an allowance for depreciation  of  two
 per  centum  of the value of the buildings exclusive of the land, or the
 amount shown for depreciation of the buildings in  the  latest  required
 federal  income  tax return, whichever is lower; provided, however, that
 (1) no allowance for depreciation of the  buildings  shall  be  included
 where  the  buildings have been fully depreciated for federal income tax
 purposes or on the books of the owner; or (2) the landlord who  owns  no
 more  than four rental units within the state has not been fully compen-
 sated by increases in rental income  sufficient  to  offset  unavoidable
 increases  in property taxes, fuel, utilities, insurance and repairs and
 maintenance, excluding mortgage interest and amortization, and excluding
 allowances for  depreciation,  obsolescence  and  reserves,  which  have
 occurred since the federal date determining the maximum rent or the date
 the  property  was acquired by the present owner, whichever is later; or
 (3) the landlord operates a hotel or rooming house or owns a cooperative
 apartment and has not been fully  compensated  by  increases  in  rental
 income  from  the controlled housing accommodations sufficient to offset
 unavoidable increases in property taxes and other costs as are allocable
 to such controlled housing accommodations, including costs of  operation
 of  such  hotel  or  rooming  house, but excluding mortgage interest and
 amortization, and excluding allowances  for  depreciation,  obsolescence
 and reserves, which have occurred since the federal date determining the
 maximum  rent  or  the  date the landlord commenced the operation of the
 property, whichever is later; or (4) the landlord and tenant voluntarily
 enter into a valid written lease in good faith with respect to any hous-
 ing accommodation, which lease provides for an increase in  the  maximum
 rent not in excess of fifteen per centum and for a term of not less than
 two  years,  except  that  where  such lease provides for an increase in
 excess of fifteen  per  centum,  the  increase  shall  be  automatically
 reduced  to fifteen per centum; or (5) the landlord and tenant by mutual
 voluntary written informed agreement agree to a substantial increase  or
 decrease in dwelling space, furniture, furnishings or equipment provided
 in  the housing accommodations; provided that an owner shall be entitled
 to a rent increase where there has been a  substantial  modification  or
 increase of dwelling space, or installation of new equipment or improve-
 ments or new furniture or furnishings provided in or to a tenant's hous-
 ing  accommodation.  The  temporary increase in the maximum rent for the
 affected housing accommodation shall be one-one hundred sixty-eighth, in
 the case of a building with thirty-five or fewer housing accommodations,
 or one-one hundred eightieth, in the case of a building with  more  than
 thirty-five  housing  accommodations where such increase takes effect on
 or after the effective date of the chapter of the laws of  two  thousand
 nineteen  that  amended  this  subparagraph,  of  the  total actual cost
 incurred by the landlord up to fifteen  thousand  dollars  in  providing
 S. 6043  5
 
 such  reasonable  and  verifiable  modification  or increase in dwelling
 space, furniture, furnishings,  or  equipment,  including  the  cost  of
 installation  but  excluding  finance  charges and any costs that exceed
 reasonable costs established by rules and regulations promulgated by the
 division  of  housing  and community renewal. Such rules and regulations
 shall include:  (i) requirements  for  work  to  be  done  by  licensed
 contractors  and  a prohibition on common ownership between the landlord
 and the contractor or vendor; and (ii)  a  requirement  that  the  owner
 resolve  within  the  dwelling  space all outstanding hazardous or imme-
 diately hazardous violations of the uniform fire prevention and building
 code (Uniform Code), New York city fire code, or New York city  building
 and  housing  maintenance codes, if applicable. Provided further that an
 owner who is entitled to a rent increase pursuant to this  clause  shall
 not  be  entitled to a further rent increase based upon the installation
 of similar equipment, or new furniture or furnishings within the  useful
 life  of  such  new equipment, or new furniture or furnishings. Provided
 further that the recoverable costs incurred by the landlord, pursuant to
 this subparagraph, shall be limited to  an  aggregate  cost  of  fifteen
 thousand  dollars  that  may  be expended on no more than three separate
 individual apartment improvements in a  fifteen  year  period  beginning
 with  the  first individual apartment improvement on or after June four-
 teenth, two thousand nineteen. Provided further that  increases  to  the
 legal  regulated  rent  pursuant to this paragraph shall be removed from
 the legal regulated rent thirty years from the date the increase  became
 effective  inclusive  of  any  increases  granted by the applicable rent
 guidelines board. The owner shall give written notice to the  commission
 of  any  such adjustment pursuant to this clause; or (6) there has been,
 since March first, nineteen hundred fifty, an  increase  in  the  rental
 value  of  the housing accommodations as a result of a substantial reha-
 bilitation of the building or housing accommodation therein which  mate-
 rially  adds  to  the  value of the property or appreciably prolongs its
 life, excluding ordinary repairs, maintenance and replacements;  or  (7)
 there  has been since March first, nineteen hundred fifty, a major capi-
 tal improvement essential for the preservation, energy efficiency, func-
 tionality, or infrastructure of the entire building, improvement of  the
 structure  including  heating,  windows, plumbing and roofing, but shall
 not be for operational costs or unnecessary cosmetic improvements; which
 for any order of the commissioner issued after the effective date of the
 chapter of the laws of two thousand nineteen that amended this paragraph
 the cost of such improvement shall be amortized over a twelve-year peri-
 od for buildings with thirty-five or fewer units or a  twelve  and  one-
 half  year  period  for  buildings with more than thirty-five units, and
 shall be removed from the legal regulated rent  thirty  years  from  the
 date the increase became effective inclusive of any increases granted by
 the  applicable  rent guidelines board. Temporary major capital improve-
 ment increases shall be collectible prospectively on the  first  day  of
 the  first month beginning sixty days from the date of mailing notice of
 approval to the tenant. Such notice shall  disclose  the  total  monthly
 increase  in  rent  and  the  first  month  in which the tenant would be
 required to pay the temporary increase.  An  approval  for  a  temporary
 major  capital  improvement  increase  shall  not  include  retroactive
 payments. The collection of any increase shall not exceed two percent in
 any year from the effective date of the order granting the increase over
 the rent set forth in the schedule of gross rents,  with  collectability
 of  any  dollar  excess  above  said sum to be spread forward in similar
 increments and added to the rent as established or set in future  years.
 S. 6043  6
 
 Upon  vacancy,  the landlord may add any remaining balance of the tempo-
 rary major capital improvement increase to  the  legal  regulated  rent.
 Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of the law, for any renewal lease
 commencing  on  or  after  June  14,  2019,  the  collection of any rent
 increases due to any major capital improvements  approved  on  or  after
 June  16,  2012 and before June 16, 2019 shall not exceed two percent in
 any year for any tenant in occupancy  on  the  date  the  major  capital
 improvement  was approved; provided, however, where an application for a
 temporary major capital improvement increase has been  filed,  a  tenant
 shall have sixty days from the date of mailing of a notice of a proceed-
 ing  in  which  to  answer  or  reply. The state division of housing and
 community renewal shall provide any responding tenant with  the  reasons
 for  the division's approval or denial of such application; or (8) there
 has been since  March  first,  nineteen  hundred  fifty,  in  structures
 containing  more  than  four  housing accommodations, other improvements
 made with the express informed consent of the tenants in occupancy of at
 least seventy-five per centum of the housing  accommodations,  provided,
 however,  that  no  adjustment  granted  hereunder  shall exceed two per
 centum unless  the  tenants  have  agreed  to  a  higher  percentage  of
 increase,  as herein provided; OR (9) there has been, since March first,
 nineteen hundred fifty, a subletting without written  consent  from  the
 landlord  or  an  increase  in the number of adult occupants who are not
 members of the immediate family of the tenant, and the landlord has  not
 been  compensated therefor by adjustment of the maximum rent by lease or
 order of the commission or pursuant to the  federal  act;  or  (10)  the
 presence  of  unique  or peculiar circumstances materially affecting the
 maximum rent has resulted in a maximum rent which is substantially lower
 than the rents generally prevailing in the same area  for  substantially
 similar  housing accommodations.  ADJUSTMENTS MADE PURSUANT TO SUBPARA-
 GRAPH (7) OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE  COLLECTIBLE  UPON  THE  LANDLORD'S
 FILING  OF  A  REPORT WITH THE COMMISSION AND SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY
 THE COMMISSION, IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE  FOR
 INSPECTING  BUILDINGS, THAT THE APPLICANT DOES NOT HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY
 CLASS A HOUSING CODE VIOLATIONS OR A CLASS B OR C HOUSING CODE VIOLATION
 ON THE PROPERTY. OUTSTANDING HOUSING  CODE  VIOLATIONS  THAT  ARE  FOUND
 SHALL  BE  CLEARED,  CORRECTED OR ABATED BY THE LANDLORD AND VERIFIED BY
 THE COMMISSION PRIOR TO AUTHORIZATION OF A RENT INCREASE UNDER  SUBPARA-
 GRAPH (7) OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
  §  5.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law; provided that:
  (a) the amendments to section 26-405 of the city  rent  and  rehabili-
 tation  law  made  by section one of this act shall remain in full force
 and effect only as long as the public emergency requiring the regulation

 subdivision 3 of section 1 of the local emergency housing  rent  control
 act; and
  (b)  the amendments to section 26-511 of the rent stabilization law of

 of such law as provided under section 26-520 of such law, as  from  time
 to time amended.
