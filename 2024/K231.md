  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 27, 2023, as Amniotic Fluid Embolism Awareness
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York  takes  great  pride  in  recognizing
official days established to increase awareness of serious health issues
that affect the lives of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  27,  2023, as
Amniotic Fluid Embolism Awareness Day in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National Amniotic Fluid Embolism
Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Amniotic Fluid Embolism Awareness Day  was  established  to
bring  attention  to  this  devastating  and  often-fatal  pregnancy
complication and the importance of reducing maternal mortality resulting
from it; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the Centers for Disease Control, the  maternal
mortality  rate in the United States increased from 20.1 in 2019 to 23.8
in 2020 per 100,000 live births; and
 
  WHEREAS, As of 2018, the maternal mortality rate in the State of New
York was 18.1 deaths per 100,000 live births;  by  2024,  the  New  York
State  Health  Plan  aims  to  substantially lower that figure to 16 per
100,000; and
 
  WHEREAS, AFE is  thought  to  be  the  result  of  an  allergic-like
reaction  to  the  amniotic  fluid  or fetal cells that have entered the
circulatory system  during  childbirth,  a  normal  part  of  the  birth
process; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  2008,  the  AFE  Foundation,  working  in
collaboration with key stakeholders in  New  York,  provides  meaningful
education  and  life-saving  skills  to  properly  prepare  healthcare
providers to manage and treat patients, increase lives saved,  and  gain
submissions to the AFE Registry and Biorepository; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently  under  the  luminous  leadership  of  Executive
Director Miranda Klassen, the AFE Foundation has served  1,500  families
globally,  educated more than 10,000 clinicians, and submitted more than
250 cases to the AFE Registry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Awareness of  AFE  and  commensurate  data  collection  and
research  will promote understanding of this disorder, expand the search
for an effective treatment, and accelerate the increase of the number of
lives saved; and
 
  WHEREAS, After losing his wife Ali to this tragic birth complication
in  2019,  Justin  Waclawek  founded  the  Alison  Rose  Foundation  the
 
following  year  to  raise  funds  for  AFE  awareness  initiatives  and
research, and medical care for children and mothers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  the  Alison  Rose  Foundation  has
sponsored numerous events which have raised significant funds that  were
donated  to  the  AFE Foundation, Golisano Children's Hospital, Sister's
Hospital  Foundation,  and  Oishei  Children's  Hospital  of  Buffalo
Foundation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  27,  2023,  as
Amniotic  Fluid  Embolism Awareness Day in the State of New York, and to
urge the citizens of this great Empire State to learn about the  causes,
symptoms,  diagnoses  and treatments for Amniotic Fluid Embolism; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; Miranda Klassen, Executive Director, AFE  Foundation;  and  Justin
Waclawek, President, Alison Rose Foundation.
