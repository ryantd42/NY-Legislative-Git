  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subparagraph  3  of  paragraph (c) of section 1402 of the
 not-for-profit corporation law, as separately amended by  chapters  383,
 424, 431 and 463 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  (3)  In towns outside of villages and fire districts, the consent of a
 majority of the members of the town board to the  formation  of  a  fire
 corporation  shall constitute an appointment of the persons named in the
 certificate of incorporation as  town  firefighters.  Thereafter,  other
 eligible  persons  may  be elected as members pursuant to the by-laws of
 the fire corporation, but the election of a member must be  approved  by
 the town board of each town which consented to the formation of the fire
 corporation.  Such  a person shall be a resident of the territory speci-
 fied in the certificate of incorporation or of  territory  outside  such
 boundaries  which  is  afforded  fire protection by the fire corporation
 pursuant to a contract for fire protection under which a cash  consider-
 ation  is  received  by  the  corporation  or for which negotiations for
 renewal of such a contract are pending. The membership of any  volunteer
 member shall terminate when [he or she] SUCH MEMBER ceases to be a resi-
 dent  of  such  inside or outside territory, except that the corporation
 may authorize [his or her] THEIR continued membership where [he or  she]
 SUCH  MEMBER notifies the secretary of the fire corporation (a) that [he
 or she plans] THEY PLAN to change [his or  her]  THEIR  residence  to  a
 territory which is not in such inside or outside territory, and (b) that
 by  reason  of  [his  or her] SUCH MEMBER'S residence in the vicinity or
 [his or her] SUCH MEMBER'S usual occupation [he or  she]  THEY  will  be
 available  to render active service as a volunteer firefighter in either
 such inside or such outside territory.  Voting  for  such  authorization

 shall  be  pursuant  to the by-laws. Such authorization shall not become
 effective unless approved by resolution of the town board of  each  town
 which  consented  to the formation of the corporation. Any membership so
 continued  shall  terminate  when  the  member  can  no  longer meet the
 requirements of this subparagraph. A person who cannot  meet  the  resi-
 dence  requirements of this subparagraph may be elected to membership as
 a volunteer member if by reason of [his or her] SUCH MEMBER'S  residence
 in  the  vicinity  or [his or her] SUCH MEMBER'S usual occupation [he or
 she] THEY will be available to render  active  service  as  a  volunteer
 firefighter  in  such  inside  or  outside  territory.  Voting  for such
 election shall be pursuant to  the  by-laws.  Such  election  shall  not
 become effective unless approved by resolution of the town board of each
 town  which  consented to the formation of the corporation. Such member-
 ship shall terminate when the member can no longer meet the requirements
 of this subparagraph. The election or continuance of  any  person  as  a
 member  shall be deemed to have been approved by the town board pursuant
 to this subparagraph in the event that no action is taken  by  the  town
 board,  either  approving or disapproving, within forty days in the case
 of residents of the territory specified in the certificate  of  incorpo-
 ration  or of outside contract territory, and within seventy days in the
 case of all others, after service of written notice of such election  or
 continuance  of  membership shall have been made by the secretary of the
 corporation upon the town clerk,  either  personally  or  by  mail.  The
 membership  of any volunteer firefighter shall not be continued pursuant
 to this subparagraph, and persons who do not  reside  in  the  territory
 specified  in the certificate of incorporation or in territory protected
 pursuant to a contract for fire  protection  shall  not  be  elected  to
 membership,  if, by so doing, the percentage of such nonresident members
 in the fire corporation would exceed forty-five per centum of the actual
 membership thereof, provided, however, that the forty-five percent limit
 on non-resident members shall not apply to the membership of the Huguen-

 uance of membership shall be contrary to the  by-laws,  rules  or  regu-
 lations of the fire corporation.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
