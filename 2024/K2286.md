  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 2024, as  Veterans  and  Military  Families
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside to pay tribute to the family  members
of  the  United  States  Military  who  have  so faithfully served their
community and country with courage and commitment, contributing  to  the
safety  and  welfare  of others and the preservation of the freedoms and
democratic principles upon which this State and Nation are founded; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as Veterans
and Military Families Month in the State of  New  York,  in  conjunction
with  the  observance  of National Veterans and Military Families Month;
and
 
  WHEREAS, November is National Veterans and Military Families  Month;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception  in 1996 by the Armed Services YMCA,
November has been a time to acknowledge the  tremendous  sacrifices  our
military families make; they contend with separation from their families
and make adjustments to new living situations and communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Military Families embody strength, resilience, and courage;
care  of military families and children sustains our fighting force, and
strengthens the health, security, and safety of  our  Nation's  families
and communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York  recognizes the significant role
military families  and  transitioning  veterans  have  in  supporting  a
stronger force; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To the nearly 5.2 million service members and families, we
celebrate and thank you for the support you give to our State and Nation
each day; and
 
  WHEREAS, While November is a time to honor our families, it is  also
critical to acknowledge the everyday challenges they face, and make it a
top priority to ensure they have the support they need to thrive; and
 
  WHEREAS, A strong military relies not only on training and education
to  ensure  readiness; it relies on strong families supporting our fight
for freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our Nation's fighting force is the greatest in  the  world,
in  no  small  part  because  year  after  year and decade after decade,
military and veteran families have had their loved  ones'  backs;  as  a
country and as a state, we owe it to these families to have their backs;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year,  as  we  celebrate  more  than  50 years of an
all-volunteer force, may we also recognize the bravery and dedication of
our military and veteran  families,  and  work  to  repay  the  debt  of
gratitude we owe each one of them; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as Veterans
and Military Families Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
