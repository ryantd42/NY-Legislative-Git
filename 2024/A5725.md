 AN  ACT  providing  for  the  extension of NYSLRS service credit for any
  service credit lost due to either furlough or layoff of a member  from
  the  period  beginning  when  executive  order  202 of 2020 was issued
  through December 31, 2020

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, any
 member of the New York state and local retirement system  who  has  been
 furloughed  or dismissed from employment between the period beginning on
 the date a state disaster emergency was declared pursuant  to  executive
 order  202 of 2020 through December 31, 2020 and has lost New York state
 and local retirement system service credit as a result, shall be  eligi-
 ble  for  service  credit  for  the  amount of time such member has been
 furloughed or dismissed during such period. Such  extension  of  service
 credit  shall  apply to full-time, part-time and seasonal members.  Such
 members shall have at least five years of credited service, not  includ-
 ing  service  credited in this act, to be eligible to receive the credit
 authorized pursuant to this act.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, none of the
 provisions of this act shall be subject to section 25 of the  retirement
 and social security law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  allow  any  member  of the New York State and Local
 Retirement System (NYSLRS) who was furloughed or dismissed from  employ-
 ment  during  the  period  beginning  March 7, 2020, the date a disaster
 emergency was declared in the State of New York  pursuant  to  Executive
 Order 202 of 2020, and ending on December 31, 2020 to be granted service
 credit  with  the NYSLRS as if no period of unemployment occurred. To be

 eligible for this additional service credit, a member must have  accrued
 at least 5 years of service credit, not including service credited under
 this bill. This bill would not be consistent with the NYSLRS's policy of
 granting service credit only when a salary has been paid.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System, if this legislation is enacted during the 2023 legis-
 lative session it is estimated that the past service cost  will  average
 approximately  21  percent of an affected member's compensation for each
 year of additional service that is granted.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System, if this legislation is enacted during the 2023
 legislative session it is estimated that  the  past  service  cost  will
 average  approximately  25  percent of an affected member's compensation
 for each year of additional service that is granted.
  All costs arising from this bill would be shared by the State  of  New
 York and all the participating employers in the NYSLRS.
