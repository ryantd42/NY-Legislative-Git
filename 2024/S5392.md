 SERVE AS WATCHERS. PARTISAN AFFILIATION, OR LACK THEREOF, SHALL NOT BE A
 VALID CRITERION TO DETERMINE QUALIFICATION OR LACK THEREOF.
  §  11.  Subdivision 9 of section 5-210 of the election law, as amended
 by chapter 44 of the laws of 2016, is amended to read as follows:
  9. The county board of elections shall, promptly and in any event, not
 later than twenty-one days after receipt by it of the application, veri-
 fy the identity of the applicant. In order to do so, the county board of
 elections shall utilize the information provided in the application  and
 shall  attempt  to verify such information with the information provided
 by the department of motor vehicles, social security administration  and
 any  other  lawful  available information source. If the county board of
 elections is unable to verify the identity of the applicant within twen-
 ty-one days of the receipt of the application, it shall immediately take
 steps to confirm that the information  provided  by  the  applicant  was
 accurately  utilized  by  such county board of elections, was accurately
 verified with other information sources and that no data entry error, or
 other similar type of  error,  occurred.  Following  completion  of  the
 preceding  steps,  the county board of elections shall mail (a) a notice
 of its approval, (b) a notice of its approval which  includes  an  indi-
 cation  that  such board has not yet been able to verify the identity of
 the applicant and a request for more information so that such  verifica-
 tion  may be completed, or (c) a notice of its rejection of the applica-
 tion to the  applicant  in  a  form  approved  by  the  state  board  of
 elections.  Notices  of  approval, notices of approval with requests for
 more information or notices of rejection shall be sent by nonforwardable
 first class or return postage guaranteed mail on which is endorsed  such
 language  designated  by  the  state board of elections to ensure postal
 authorities do not forward such mail but  return  it  to  the  board  of
 elections  with  forwarding  information, when it cannot be delivered as
 addressed and which contains a request that any such mail  received  for
 persons  not  residing  at  the address be dropped back in the mail. The
 voter's registration and enrollment shall be complete  upon  receipt  of
 the  application by the appropriate county board of elections. The fail-
 ure of a county board of elections to  verify  an  applicant's  identity
 S. 5392  5

 shall  not  be  the  basis  for  the rejection of a voter's application,
 provided, however, that such verification failure shall be the basis for
 requiring county board of elections to take the additional  verification
 steps  provided by this chapter. The notice shall also advise the regis-
 trant of the date when his registration and enrollment is effective,  of
 the date and the hours of the next regularly scheduled primary or gener-
 al election in which he will be eligible to vote, of the location of the
 polling  [place]  PLACES of the election district AND COUNTY in which he

 election, may obtain an absentee ballot and the phone number to call for
 absentee ballot applications, the phone numbers to call for location  of
 polling  places,  to  obtain  registration forms and the phone number to
 call to indicate that the voter is willing to serve on election  day  as
 an  inspector, poll clerk or interpreter. The notice of approval, notice
 of approval with request for more information  or  notice  of  rejection
 shall  also  advise  the  applicant  to notify the board of elections if
 there is any inaccuracy. The form of such  mail  notification  shall  be
 prescribed  by the state board of elections and shall contain such other
 information and instructions as it may reasonably require to  carry  out
 the  purposes  of this section.  The request for more information shall
 inform the voter that "THE FAILURE TO CONTACT THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS AND
 CORRECT ANY INACCURACIES IN THE APPLICATION OR PROVIDE  REQUESTED  ADDI-
 TIONAL  INFORMATION  MAY  RESULT  IN A REQUEST FOR IDENTIFICATION AT THE
 POLLS IN ORDER TO CAST A VOTE ON A VOTING MACHINE." If  such  notice  is
 returned  undelivered  without  a new address, the board shall forthwith
 send such applicant a confirmation notice pursuant to the provisions  of
 section  5-712  of  this  article  and  place such applicant in inactive
