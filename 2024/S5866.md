 AN ACT to amend the workers' compensation law, in relation to permitting

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph (e) of subdivision 1 of section 25 of the work-
 ers' compensation law, as amended by chapter 635 of the laws of 1996, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (e) If the employer  or  insurance  carrier  shall  fail  to  pay  any
 installments  of  compensation  within [twenty-five] FOURTEEN days after
 the same become due, there shall be paid by the employer or, if insured,
 its insurance carrier, an additional amount of  twenty  percent  of  the
 compensation  then due which shall accrue for the benefit of the injured
 worker or his or her dependents and shall be paid to him or her or  them
 with  the  compensation,  unless such delay or default is excused by the
 board upon the application of the employer or insurance carrier upon the
 ground that owing to conditions over which  the  employer  or  insurance
 carrier  had no control, such payment could not be made. The employer in
 each such instance shall also be  assessed  the  sum  of  three  hundred
 dollars, which shall be paid to the claimant.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
