 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  LEVENBERG  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Election Law
 
 AN ACT to amend the election law, in relation to public school buildings
  designated as polling places
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  3  of  section 4-104 of the election law, as
 amended by chapter 694 of the laws  of  1989,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  3.  A building exempt from taxation shall be used whenever possible as
 a polling place if it is situated in the same or a  contiguous  election
 district,  and may contain as many distinctly separate polling places as
 public convenience may require. The expense, if any, incidental  to  its
 use,  shall be paid like the expense of other places of registration and
 voting. If a board or body empowered to designate polling places chooses
 a public school building for such purpose, the  board  or  agency  which
 controls  such  building  must  make  available  a room or rooms in such
 building which are suitable for registration and voting and which are as
 close as possible to a convenient entrance to  such  building  and  must
 make  available any such room or rooms which the board or body designat-
 ing such building  determines  are  accessible  to  physically  disabled
 voters as provided in subdivision one-a OF THIS SECTION. Notwithstanding
 the  provisions of any general, special or local law, if a board or body
 empowered to designate polling places chooses a publicly owned or leased
 building[, other than a public school building,] for such  purposes  the
 board or body which controls such building must make available a room or
 rooms  in  such  building which are suitable for registration and voting
 and which are as close as possible to  a  convenient  entrance  to  such
 building, and must make available any such room or rooms which the board
 or  body  designating  such  building determines are accessible to phys-
 ically disabled voters unless, not later than thirty days  after  notice
 of  its  designation  as  a polling place, the board or body controlling
 such building, files a written request for a cancellation of such desig-
 nation with the board or body empowered to designate polling  places  on

 such  form  as shall be provided by the board or body making such desig-
 nation. The board or body empowered to so designate shall, within twenty
 days after such request is filed, determine  whether  the  use  of  such
 building  as a polling place would unreasonably interfere with the usual
 activities conducted in such building and upon such  determination,  may
 cancel such designation.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
