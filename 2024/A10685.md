 Introduced by COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Novakhov) --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to reporting requirements
  regarding  financial expenditures related to certain teacher discipli-
  nary proceedings
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "3020-a arbitration process reporting act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and declaration of purpose.  It  is  in  the
 public  interest to ensure transparency and accountability in the finan-
 cial expenditures of  school  districts  in  cities  with  a  population
 exceeding  250,000  that  have  a  collective  bargaining agreement. The
 3020-a arbitration process, as established under section 3020-a  of  the
 education  law,  involves significant financial expenditures that should
 be disclosed to ensure responsible fiscal management. The  citizens  and
 elected  officials  of such cities have a right to be informed about the
 financial aspects of the 3020-a arbitration process  to  promote  public
 trust  and informed decision-making. Further, detailed financial report-
 ing can help identify  trends,  inefficiencies,  and  opportunities  for
 reform  in  the  arbitration process and transparency in the arbitration
 process can contribute to better  labor  relations  and  more  effective
 governance.
  §  3.  The  education law is amended by adding a new section 3020-b to
 read as follows:
