  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  July 25, 2024, as Afro-Latina,  Afro-Caribbean,  and
  African  Diaspora  Women's  Day  in the State of New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body hereby memorializes Governor Kathy
Hochul to proclaim July 25, 2024, as  Afro-Latina,  Afro-Caribbean,  and
African  Diaspora  Women's  Day in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of International  Afro-Latina,  Afro-Caribbean,  and
African Diaspora Women's Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year  on  July 25th, women of African descent across
Latin America and the Caribbean, from Argentina to Puerto  Rico,  gather
to  celebrate  International  Afro-Latina,  Afro-Caribbean,  and African
Diaspora Women's Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital holiday was created on July 25, 1992, when Black
women from 32 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean  gathered  in
Santo  Domingo,  Dominican Republic, for the First Meeting of Afro-Latin
American and Afro-Caribbean Women; and
 
  WHEREAS, The meeting was  called  to  celebrate  Black  culture  and
identity,  to  honor  the legacy and contributions of Black women and to
combat racism and sexism; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over 130 million people of African descent  live  in  Latin
America;  Afro-descendant  women  have  and  continue  to  face  racial
discrimination, poverty, abuse,  and  marginalization;  many  have  less
access to quality education, housing, employment, and healthcare; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Afro-descendant women are also affected by policies, laws,
and  practices  that  intentionally  or  unintentionally  create
discrimination;  acknowledging  these  injustices,  The  United  Nations
General Assembly declared 2015-2024  as  the  International  Decade  for
People of African Descent: Recognition, Justice and Development; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  declaration  aims to acknowledge the contribution of
Afro-descendants, increase understanding and respect for Black  heritage
and culture, and create opportunities for Afro-descendants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
(IACHR) calls on countries, "to  promote  and  strengthen  this  group's
participation through special measures and affirmative action, promoting
safe  spaces  for  their  effective  impact  and  combating all forms of
discrimination and violence against them in all  political  institutions
and spaces."; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  International  Afro-Latina,
Afro-Caribbean, and African Diaspora Women's Day has been celebrated  in
various  ways  in  countries throughout Latin America, the United States
and Spain; and
 
  WHEREAS, Black women in many countries have been able to promote the
creation  of  laws against racial discrimination and segregation through
their  continued  activism  and  intellectual  discussions  on  racial
discrimination  since  the  First  Meeting  of  Afro-Latin  American and
Afro-Caribbean women; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the practice of this Legislative  Body  to  recognize
those important days which remind us of the rich and diverse heritage of
our great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  duly  fitting  that  all New Yorkers join in these
important celebrations of one of our State's most  vibrant  communities;
this  much  anticipated  observance and its accompanying activities will
foster greater appreciation for  women  of  African  descent  and  their
culture,  and  will  serve  to promote the spirit of cooperation that is
characteristic of all citizens of New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  July  25,  2024,  as
Afro-Latina, Afro-Caribbean, and African Diaspora  Women's  Day  in  the
State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
