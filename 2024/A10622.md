 Introduced  by COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Bronson) --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN ACT to authorize the granting of retirement  service  credit  in  the
  optional  twenty year retirement plan to Duane A. Palma for service as
  a correction officer
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, Duane A.
 Palma,  a  deputy  sheriff currently employed by the Monroe county sher-
 iff's office who was employed as a  correction  officer  by  the  Monroe
 county  sheriff's  office  jail  bureau  beginning on February 22, 1999,
 shall be given full credit in the optional twenty year retirement  plan,
 established  pursuant  to  sections  552  and  553 of the retirement and
 social security law, for such employment as a correction officer at  the
 Monroe  county  sheriff's  office  jail  bureau upon the election of the
 county of Monroe to assume the additional cost of such service  and  his
 election  to participate in such plan. The county of Monroe may so elect
 within one year of the effective date of this act, by  filing  with  the
 state  comptroller  a  resolution of its local legislative body together
 with certification that such member did not  bar  himself  from  partic-
 ipation in such retirement plan as a result of his own negligence.
  §  2. Such deputy sheriff may elect to be covered by the provisions of
 sections 552 and 553 of the retirement and social security law and shall
 be entitled to the full rights and  benefits  associated  with  coverage
 under  such  section  by  filing a request to that effect with the state
 comptroller within eighteen months of the effective date of this act.
  § 3. All employer past service costs associated with  the  implementa-
 tion of this act shall be borne by the county of Monroe and may be amor-
 tized over a period of five years.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow Duane A. Palma, a current member of the New York
 State  and  Local  Employees'  Retirement System (NYSLERS) employed as a
 deputy sheriff by the County of Monroe and  covered  under  the  25-year

 retirement  plan  of  Section 89-p of the Retirement and Social Security
 Law (RSSL), to elect to be covered under the 20-year  plan  of  Sections
 552  and  553  of  the  RSSL  retroactive to February 22, 1999. All past
 service costs will be borne by the County of Monroe and may be amortized
 over a period of five years.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of approximately  $177,000  which
 will  be borne by the County of Monroe as a one-time payment. This esti-
 mate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025. If the Coun-
 ty of Monroe elects to amortize this cost over a five-year  period,  the
 cost for each year including interest would be $39,600.
  This  bill  will  not  increase the future annual contributions of the
 County of Monroe.
