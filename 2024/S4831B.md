  (b) In addition to any other tax imposed by this chapter or other law,
 there  is hereby imposed a tax of nine percent of the amount charged for

 of this chapter shall apply to the taxes imposed by section four hundred
 ninety-three  of this article in the same manner and with the same force
 and effect as if the language of such article had been  incorporated  in
