  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 6, 2023, as Tartan Day in  the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 6, 2023,  as  Tartan
Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Tartan Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, The people of this great State and Scotland  enjoy  a  deep
and  abiding  relationship  rooted  in kinship and culture, and many New
Yorkers proudly trace their roots to Scotland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tartan  Day  parades  and  celebrations  have  grown
exponentially  in New York State since 1999 to celebrate the heritage of
Scottish New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, National Tartan Day  is  celebrated  across  the
country  on  April  6th  to  recognize  the outstanding achievements and
contributions made by Scottish Americans to the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Scotland and the United States have  long  shared  ties  of
family  and friendship, and many of our country's most cherished customs
and ideals first grew to maturity on Scotland's soil; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Declaration of Arbroath, the  Scottish  Declaration  of
Independence  signed  on  April  6,  1320,  embodied  the  Scots' strong
dedication to liberty, and the Scots brought that tradition  of  freedom
with them to the New World; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sons  and  daughters of many Scottish clans were among the
first immigrants to settle  in  America,  and  their  determination  and
optimism helped build our Nation's character; nearly half of the signers
of  the  Declaration  of  Independence  were of Scottish descent and the
Governors in nine of the original 13 States were of  Scottish  ancestry;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  Scottish  Americans  were  instrumental  in
shaping the United States in its formative years and guiding the  Nation
through its most troubled times; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  monumental  achievements and invaluable contributions
made by Scottish Americans have led  to  America's  preeminence  in  the
fields  of  science,  technology,  medicine,  government,  politics,
economics, architecture, literature, media, and  visual  and  performing
arts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  Scottish  Americans,  such  as Andrew Carnegie, were
great philanthropists,  founding  and  supporting  numerous  scientific,
educational, and civic institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  the  evocative  sounds  of the bagpipes to the great
sport of golf, the Scots have also left an indelible  mark  on  American
culture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  more  than 200 organizations throughout the United
States honor Scottish heritage, tradition, and culture, representing the
hundreds of thousands of Americans  of  Scottish  descent,  residing  in
every  State,  who  continue  to  make  the  observance  of Tartan Day a
success; and
 
  WHEREAS, By recognizing the  accomplishments  and  contributions  of
Scottish  Americans, this great Empire State reaffirms our commitment to
diversity and equal opportunity  for  all,  thereby  ensuring  a  bright
future for all New Yorkers and Americans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 6, 2023,  as  Tartan
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
