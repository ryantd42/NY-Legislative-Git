 lations  and  existing  programs involving reentry and re-integration of
 incarcerated individuals released  from  state  and  local  correctional
 facilities.  The  commission  shall  investigate all factors that impede
 successful re-integration into society and  obviate  the  concept  of  a
 second  chance.  The  commission  shall analyze the impact of existing
 policies on successful reentry, identify specific obstacles to  re-inte-
 gration  and compare policies of this state to those of other states and
 the federal government. The commission shall collect data from state and
 federal agencies and may analyze any current  research  deemed  relevant
 and appropriate.
  §  2.  a. The commission shall consist of eighteen members as follows:
 three members shall be appointed by the speaker of the  assembly;  three
 members shall be appointed by the temporary president of the senate; two
 members shall be appointed by the minority leader of the senate; and two
 members  shall  be  appointed  by  the  minority leader of the assembly.
 Members so appointed shall be representative of community based  provid-
 ers of employment, education, housing and other services needed by indi-
 viduals  returning  to  society from prison, criminal justice advocates,
 and academic professionals in the field of criminal justice. The remain-
 ing members shall be the heads of the following departments or  agencies

 commission shall meet and hold public hearings or private meetings with-
 in  or without the state, and shall have all the powers of a legislative
 committee pursuant to the legislative law.
  § 6. The commission may request and shall receive from  any  court  in
 the  state  and from any subdivision, department, board, bureau, commis-
 sion, office, agency or other instrumentality of the  state  or  of  any
 political subdivision thereof such facilities, assistance and data as it
 deems  necessary or desirable for the proper execution of its powers and
 duties and to effectuate the purposes set forth in this act.
  § 7. The commission shall make a report of its findings, including any
 recommendations for legislative action as  it  may  deem  necessary  and

 act shall have become a law.
