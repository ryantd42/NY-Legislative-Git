 AN  ACT  granting  retroactive  tier IV status in the New York state and

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Dana  Kerstanski,  who  was  employed as a substitute custodian with the
 Warwick Valley school district with a start date of May  10,  2006,  and
 who  is  currently  a  member of the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system, who through no fault of his  own  did  not  become  a
 member  of  the New York state and local employees' retirement system on
 May 10, 2006 when first employed by the Warwick Valley  school  district
 shall  be  deemed  to have been a member of the New York state and local
 employees' retirement system on such date he  commenced  his  employment
 and  shall  be  granted  Tier IV status, provided that an application is
 filed with the head of the New York state and local  employees'  retire-
 ment  system  within one year from the effective date of this act.  Upon
 the granting of such retroactive membership, Dana Kerstanski  shall  not
 be  granted  a refund of any employee contributed made by him to the New
 York state and local employees' retirement system.

 this act shall be borne by the Warwick Valley school district.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  grant Tier 4 status in the New York State and Local
 Employees' Retirement System to Dana Kerstanski, a current Tier 6 member
 employed by the Monroe Woodbury Central  School  District,  by  changing
 their  date  of  membership  to May 10, 2006. There will be no refund of

  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase  of  approximately  $3,700  in  the
 annual  contributions of the Monroe Woodbury Central School District for
 the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this  cost  will
 vary as the billing rates and salary of Dana Kerstanski change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $50,300 which will be
 borne by the Warwick  Valley  Central  School  District  as  a  one-time
 payment.  This estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1,
 2024.
