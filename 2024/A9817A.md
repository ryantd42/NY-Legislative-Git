  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 4 of chapter 18 of the laws of 2020 authorizing the

  3. IN THE EVENT THAT THE MONITOR OR  MONITORS  FIND  THAT  AN  ADOPTED
 RESOLUTION  OR  MOTION,  A  PROPOSED  RESOLUTION  OR MOTION, OR THAT THE
 BOARD'S FAILURE TO ACT VIOLATES STATE LAW, THE RULES  OF  THE  BOARD  OF
 REGENTS,  THE  REGULATIONS  OF THE COMMISSIONER, OR IS INCONSISTENT WITH
 THE TERMS OF THE LONG TERM STRATEGIC  ACADEMIC  AND  FISCAL  IMPROVEMENT
 PLAN, THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MAY:
  (A)  OVERRIDE  ADOPTED OR PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS OR MOTIONS BY THE BOARD
 THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF A DIRECTIVE WHICH  SHALL  CONTAIN  THE  SPECIFIC
 FINDINGS  AS TO THE NECESSITY OF SUCH OVERRIDE AND ANY POTENTIAL CORREC-
 TIVE ACTION BY THE BOARD THAT  WOULD  ADDRESS  THE  DEFICIENCY  IN  SUCH
 ADOPTED  OR PROPOSED RESOLUTION OR MOTION. THE MONITOR OR MONITORS SHALL
 PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE BOARD, SUPERINTENDENT AND COMMISSIONER  OF
 THEIR INTENTION TO OVERRIDE THE ADOPTED OR PROPOSED RESOLUTION OR MOTION

 MOTION WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD UNLESS THE COMMISSIONER HAS EXTENDED THE
 PERIOD  TO  OVERRIDE  DUE  TO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NECESSITATE

 SCHEDULED BOARD MEETING TO TAKE UP SUCH RESOLUTION. THE MONITOR OR MONI-
 TORS MAY WITHDRAW THE RESOLUTION PRIOR TO, OR  DURING,  THE  NEXT  BOARD
 MEETING,  IF  THE  BOARD  TAKES  SUFFICIENT ACTION TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES
 CONTAINED IN THE RESOLUTION. IF THE  RESOLUTION  IS  NOT  WITHDRAWN,  IT
 SHALL  BE  DEEMED  TO  BE  ADOPTED AT THE NEXT BOARD MEETING THROUGH ITS
 SUBMISSION AND SHALL HAVE THE FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AS ANY OTHER  RESOL-
 UTION ADOPTED BY THE BOARD.

 RESOLUTION OR MOTION  OR  SUBMIT  A  RESOLUTION  RELATED  TO  COLLECTIVE
 BARGAINING  AGREEMENTS  NEGOTIATED  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 14 OF THE

  5.  THE  MONITOR OR MONITORS SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO APPROVE OR DISAP-
 PROVE THE APPOINTMENT OF A SUPERINTENDENT BY THE BOARD OF  EDUCATION  ON
 OR  AFTER  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF THIS ACT. THE BOARD SHALL SUBMIT THE
 RECOMMENDATION  FOR  SUPERINTENDENT  TO  THE  MONITOR  OR  MONITORS  FOR
 APPROVAL.  THE  MONITOR  OR  MONITORS  SHALL  HAVE 10 DAYS TO APPROVE OR

 IN  THE POSITION OF SUPERINTENDENT DUE TO THE DISAPPROVAL OF A RECOMMEN-
 DATION, THE MONITOR OR MONITORS MAY APPOINT A CURRENT SCHOOL EMPLOYEE AS
 INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT UNTIL  A  RECOMMENDATION  FOR  SUPERINTENDENT  IS
 APPROVED.

 sioner of education to appoint a monitor to oversee the Wyandanch  union
