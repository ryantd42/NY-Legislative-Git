  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 28, 2023, as  Workers'  Memorial  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year  across the Nation, the Labor Movement observes
Workers' Memorial Day to remember workers killed, injured, or  made  ill
on  the  job  and  to  renew  the  fight  for  strong  safety and health
protections; and
 
  WHEREAS, For decades workers have  struggled  for  improved  working
conditions, dignity, and respect on the job; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York, the Empire State, has been built and made great
through the hard work and effort of working people; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many men and women work each day in dangerous environments,
at times under arduous and perilous conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Labor Movement organized for safer  working  conditions
and demanded action from the government to protect working people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than  50  years  ago on April 28, as a result of the
tireless efforts of the Labor  Movement,  the  Occupational  Safety  and
Health Act went into effect, granting all citizens the fundamental right
to  a  safe  job  and  creating  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health
Administration; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since that impactful day, unions and allies  of  the  Labor
Movement  have  won  several  protections  for workers to make jobs less
dangerous and to save lives; however, thousands  of  workers  are  still
killed each year and millions more suffer from injury and illness due to
unsafe working conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  was a two percent increase in work-related injuries
in 2018, and in 2007, approximately 53,445 workers died of  work-related
illnesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Aside from the unfathomable grief caused by the death of a
person, there are long-term social and economic impacts on the  workers'
families and the society at large; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  members  of  this  Legislative Body are determined to
ensure that a safe workplace be the norm for all working men  and  women
and  pause  in  remembrance of those who have imperiled their health and
safety or sacrificed their lives in the performance of their work;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  28,  2023,  as
Workers' Memorial Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
