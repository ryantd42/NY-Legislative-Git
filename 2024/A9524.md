 Introduced by M. of A. LUNSFORD -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Local Governments
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the town law, in relation to requiring the appointment
  of assessors
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraphs  (b) and (f) of subdivision 1 of section 20 of
 the town law, paragraph (b) as amended by chapter 513  of  the  laws  of
 2022  and  paragraph  (f) as amended by chapter 472 of the laws of 1984,
 are amended to read as follows:
  (b) Except as otherwise provided by law,  every  town  of  the  second
 class shall have a supervisor, two justices of the peace, two town coun-
 cil  members,  a  town  clerk,  a town superintendent of highways, three
 assessors, a collector, and, if there be no town police  department,  as
 many  constables  as the town board may determine necessary. In any such
 town in which a town police department has been established pursuant  to
 law,  the  town  board may appoint not more than four civil officers who
 shall possess all the powers and duties of constables in  civil  actions
 and  proceedings  only,  except that the town board of the town of Sout-
 hold, county of Suffolk, may appoint  four  additional  constables,  who
 shall possess all the powers and duties of constables in civil and crim-
 inal  actions  and proceedings, solely for the benefit of Fishers Island
 located in such town; provided, however, that nothing in this  paragraph
 shall be deemed to authorize such constables to carry, repair or dispose
 of  a  firearm  unless the appropriate license therefore has been issued
 pursuant to section 400.00 of the penal law; and shall be paid no salary
 by the town board but shall be entitled to collect  the  statutory  fees
 allowed by law in such civil actions and proceedings.  Every town of the
 second class may have in addition such other employees as the town board
 may  determine  necessary  for  the proper conduct of the affairs of the
 town. The supervisor, justices of the peace, town council members,  town
 clerk,  town  superintendent  of  highways[, assessors] and collector in
 every such town shall be elected. All other town officers and  employees
 in such a town shall be appointed by the town board, except as otherwise

 provided  by  law.  Provided,  however,  that in a town having less than
 three hundred inhabitants according to the  latest  federal  census  and
 having  a  taxable  property valuation of less than one hundred thousand
 dollars  according to the latest assessment roll, there shall be elected
 one justice of the peace for a term of four years [and one assessor  for
 a  term  of  two years,] but no town council member.  Successors to such
 officers shall be elected for like terms at the biennial  town  election
 prior  to  the  expiration  of their terms of office.  The clerk of the
 court of a town shall be employed and discharged  from  employment  only
 upon the advice and consent of the town justice or justices.
  (f)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of paragraph (b) of this subdivi-
 sion, every town of the second class [which has not exercised the option
 to retain elective assessors in the manner provided  by  former  section
 fifteen  hundred  fifty-six of the real property tax law] shall have one
 assessor to be appointed in the manner and for the  term  prescribed  by
 section three hundred ten of the real property tax law.
  § 2. An elected assessor who cannot be reelected due to section one of
 this act may complete his or her term as an elected assessor.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
