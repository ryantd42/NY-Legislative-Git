BY: Senator KENNEDY
 
  MOURNING  the death of Mary C. Heneghan, a devoted
  wife and mother, and tireless champion for the Irish
  American community
 
  WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding members of our community who,
through their selfless commitment and dedication, have served to  better
the  quality of life in our community and have had a measurable positive
impact on the lives of its residents; Mary  C.  Heneghan  was  one  such
individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  profound  sorrow  and  deep regret that this
Legislative Body records the passing of Mary  C.  Heneghan,  noting  the
significance of her purposeful life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary  C.  Heneghan of Orchard Park, New York, died on July
31, 2022, at the age of 76; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a steadfast and unwavering  commitment  to  her  Irish
culture, Mary C. Heneghan was the longtime Director of the Buffalo Irish
Center,  an  organization  dedicated  to  preserving  traditional  Irish
heritage and culture; she became chair of the Board  of  Directors  more
than  two decades ago, and was its longest tenured leader at the time of
her death; and
 
  WHEREAS, A charismatic leader who did everything with love, Mary  C.
Heneghan  helped  forge or improve the Irish Center's Emerald Room, pub,
library, Gaelic language and cultural classes, as  well  as  its  Annual
Buffalo Irish Center Civic Luncheon; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  this extraordinary woman served as president
of the Gaelic American Athletic Association, and was the  driving  force
behind  nearly every local Irish event, including the reinvention of the
Buffalo Irish Festival on Buffalo's Outer  Harbor  which  she  organized
from a hospital bed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary  C.  Heneghan's  final  hours  truly  symbolized  a
decades-long determination to  assure  that  those  with  roots  on  the
Emerald Isle honor their ancestry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  on  March  1, 1946, in Mercy Hospital, Mary C. Breen
grew up in South Buffalo; her father, John Breen, who moved in 1922 from
Kilmihil, County Clare, and mother, Katherine Scanlon,  instilled  their
cultural heritage at an early age, both at home and on frequent trips to
Ireland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Love  for  her father's homeland and the family's roots in
her own  South  Buffalo  community  intensified  after  she  met  Thomas
Heneghan,  who  had  moved  to  the  neighborhood in 1955 from Kilmaine,
County Mayo; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thomas Heneghan and Mary C. Breen were united  in  marriage
at  St.  Teresa's  in  1965 and moved to West Seneca a couple of years
later; the couple moved to East Aurora in the mid-1970s, and  along  the
 
way,  instilled  the  love  of  all things Irish in their four wonderful
children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary  C.  Heneghan  was a teacher at Winchester Elementary
School in West Seneca before leaving the profession in 1980 to open Tara
Gift Shoppe; located across from the Irish  Center  on  Abbott  Road  in
South  Buffalo,  the  shop  was  named  after the Hill of Tara in County
Meath, seat of the high kings of Ireland in the early Christian era, and
offered Irish crystal and  other  collectibles,  knitwear,  jewelry  and
more;  under  her  able  leadership,  the  gift  shop  became a regional
touchstone for all things Irish; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Predeceased  by  her  beloved  husband,  Thomas,  Mary  C.
Heneghan  is  survived  by her four children, Mary Kay, Thomas (Debbie),
Shannon (Vincent) and Barry  (Tracy);  and  three  grandchildren,  Lucy,
Jonas and Allie; as well as many cousins, nieces and nephews; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary  C.  Heneghan's infinite selflessness and benevolence
will shine on through her family's vivid and happy memories; her insight
and strength will forever serve as a beacon of love, light and  hope  to
the countless lives she touched; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Armed  with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a sense of
compassion, Mary C. Heneghan leaves behind  a  legacy  which  will  long
endure the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory to all
who  were  privileged to have known and loved such an amazing woman; she
will be deeply missed and truly merits  the  grateful  tribute  of  this
Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
mourn the death  of  Mary  C.  Heneghan,  and  to  express  its  deepest
condolences to her family; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Mary C. Heneghan.
