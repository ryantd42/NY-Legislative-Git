 AN ACT to amend the public health law, the education law and  the  labor
  law,  in relation to prohibiting participation in torture and improper
  treatment of incarcerated individuals by health care professionals
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  policy and intent. This legislation is based
 on, and is intended to give effect to, international treaties and stand-
 ards; federal, state and local law; and professional standards  relating
 to  torture, improper treatment of incarcerated individuals, and related
 matters. It is guided by two basic principles: (1) health  care  profes-
 sionals  shall  be dedicated to providing the highest standard of health
 care, with compassion and respect for human dignity and rights; and  (2)
 torture and improper treatment of incarcerated individuals are wrong and
 inconsistent  with  the  practice  of  the  health care professions. The
 legislature finds that the conduct prohibited by this act  violates  the
 ethical  and  legal  obligations  of licensed health care professionals.
 This legislation will further protect the professionalism  of  New  York
 state  licensed  health care professionals by authorizing and obligating
 them to refuse to participate  in  torture  and  improper  treatment  of
 incarcerated individuals, which in turn will protect the life and health
 of  the people of the state and those with whom New York licensed health
 care professionals interact.  A health care professional  who  comes  to

 A. 4863--A  2
 
 the  aid  of  an incarcerated individual should not be presumed to be in
 violation when they are fulfilling the ethical principle of beneficence.
 In contrast, a health care professional who, for example, attends to  an
 incarcerated  individual in order to allow torture or improper treatment
 to commence or continue is not acting beneficently.  Such practices  are
 inconsistent  with  professional ethics and standards and are violations
 of this legislation.  The legislature is mindful that  ordinarily  there
 are  limits on New York state's jurisdiction relating to conduct outside
 the state or under federal authority. However,  it  is  proper  for  the
 state  to  regulate  health care professional licensure in relation to a
 professional's conduct, even where the conduct occurs outside the state;
 certain wrongful out-of-state conduct is  already  grounds  for  profes-
 sional  discipline.  Therefore, it is the legislature's intent that this
 legislation be applied to the fullest extent possible.
  § 2. The public health law is amended by adding a new  section  25  to
 read as follows:
