  HONORING  the  life and legacy of Dr. Mary Edwards
  Walker in conjunction with the March 2024 observance
  of Women's History Month
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge and
celebrate individuals and events  of  historic  significance  which  add
vitality,  sensitivity,  understanding  and inspiration to the diversity
and value of the people of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the  life  and legacy of Dr. Mary Edwards Walker in conjunction with the
March 2024 observance of Women's History Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, An American feminist, suffragist, suspected  spy,  prisoner
of  war and surgeon, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker remains the only women ever
to receive the Medal of Honor, which she was  awarded  for  her  service
during the Civil War; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  in  Oswego,  New  York, in 1832, Mary Walker was the
fifth daughter of abolitionists Alvah  and  Vesta  Whitcomb  Walker  who
encouraged her to think freely; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  Mary  Edwards  Walker graduated from Syracuse Medical
College in 1855, and set up her own medical practice in Rome, New  York,
shortly thereafter; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1860,  Dr.  Mary Edwards Walker briefly attended Bowen
Collegiate Institute in Hopkinton, Iowa, but was swiftly suspended  from
the  college  for  refusing  to resign from the school's all-male debate
team; and
 
  WHEREAS, At the onset of the Civil  War,  Dr.  Mary  Edwards  Walker
traveled  to  Washington  to  join  the  Union  Army;  she  was denied a
commission as  a  medical  officer,  but  served  anyway  as  an  unpaid
volunteer surgeon at the U.S. Patent Office Hospital in Washington; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1862, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker worked as an unpaid field
surgeon near the front  lines  at  Fredericksburg  and  Chattanooga;  in
September  of  the following year, she became the first female U.S. Army
surgeon  following  her  commission  as  a  "Contract  Acting  Assistant
Surgeon" by the Army of the Cumberland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  serving  as an assistant surgeon with the 52nd Ohio
Infantry, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker routinely crossed the lines  to  treat
civilians;  on  one  such foray in 1864, she was detained by Confederate
troops and arrested for suspicion of spying; she was eventually freed in
a prisoner exchange; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the remainder of the war, Dr.  Mary  Edwards  Walker
served at the Louisville Women's Prison Hospital and at an orphan asylum
in Clarksville, Tennessee; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  the  completion of her valiant military service, Dr.
Mary Edwards Walker  was  awarded  a  disability  pension  for  muscular
atrophy  which  she suffered while in prison in Castle Thunder; based on
the recommendation of  Major  Generals  Sherman  and  Thomas,  President
Andrew  Johnson  signed a bill on November 11, 1865, to present her with
the Medal of Honor for Meritorious Service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker was  a  fierce  suffrage  advocate,
testifying  before  Congress on the issue multiple times and engaging in
efforts of civil disobedience; in her later years, she opened  her  home
to  those  who  were  also  ostracized,  harassed,  and arrested for not
conforming to traditional ideas of how people should dress; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker died at her home  on  February  21,
1919;  she was laid to rest in a black suit at Rural Cemetery in Oswego,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker  was  inducted  into  the  National
Women'sHall of Fame in 2000; she also had a Liberty ship named after her
in  World  War  II,  called the SS Mary Walke; furthermore, in 2012, her
hometown  unveiled  a  900-pound  bronze  statue  in  honor  of  her
contributions and advocacy on behalf of women; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body recognizes that New York State is the
home  to  countless women such as Dr. Mary Edwards Walker who are strong
and colorful threads, vital to the fabric of our rich heritage, who have
contributed, and continue to add  to  the  advancement  of  our  culture
through  their  traditional  and  non-traditional roles in society; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor the life and legacy of Dr. Mary Edwards Walker in conjunction with
the observance of Women's History Month.
