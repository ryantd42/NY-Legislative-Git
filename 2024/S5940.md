  Section 1. Resolved (if the Assembly concurs), That section 2 of arti-

  § 2. Annually, on or before the first day of  February  in  each  year
 following  the year fixed by the constitution for the election of gover-
 nor and lieutenant governor, and on or before the second Tuesday follow-
 ing the first day of the annual meeting of the legislature, in all other
 years, the governor shall submit to the legislature a budget  containing
 a  complete plan of expenditures proposed to be made before the close of
 the ensuing fiscal year and all moneys  and  revenues  estimated  to  be
 available  therefor,  together  with an explanation of the basis of such
 estimates and recommendations as to proposed legislation, if any,  which
 the  governor  may  deem necessary to provide moneys and revenues suffi-
 cient to meet such proposed expenditures. It  shall  also  contain  such
 other  recommendations  and  information as the governor may deem proper
 and such additional information as may be required by law.  THE TOTAL OF
 SUCH PROPOSED EXPENDITURES CONTAINED IN SUCH  BUDGET  SHALL  NOT  EXCEED

 next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly,  and,  in
 conformity  with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution, be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
