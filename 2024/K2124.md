Assembly Resolution No. 2124
 
BY: M. of A. Levenberg
 
  COMMEMORATING  the 10th Anniversary of the Lincoln
  Depot Museum
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that  the  quality
of  life of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched by
its exceptional cultural, educational and recreational institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the  Lincoln  Depot  Museum,  to  be
celebrated  with  a  ceremony on Saturday, April 27, 2024; additionally,
later in the year, an Anniversary Reception will be  held  on  Saturday,
September 21, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Located  by  Peekskill  Bay on the east bank of the Hudson
River, The Lincoln Depot Museum is  a  3,000  square  foot  freight  and
passenger  rail  depot  where President-elect Abraham Lincoln stopped to
greet New Yorkers on February 19, 1861 during his inaugural  train  ride
between Springfield, Illinois and Washington, DC.; and
 
  WHEREAS, This historic event still resonates today as an inspiration
to  the study of local history and historic preservation; it resulted in
the formation of  the  Lincoln  Society  in  Peekskill  in  1903,  which
continues to be the oldest continually active such society in the United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  National  Park  Service highlighted the
importance of Lincoln's  Peekskill  stop  in  2011  when  Peekskill  was
included  as  one  of their few reenacted events commemorating the 150th
Anniversary of Lincoln's Inaugural Journey; and
 
  WHEREAS, The historic building was acquired in 2003, and the Lincoln
Depot Foundation was established in 2007 with the goal  to  restore  the
Depot  as  a  museum  that  would  illuminate  and  celebrate  Lincoln's
relationship to New York and to New Yorkers before and during the  Civil
War; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remembering and recounting Lincoln's ties to Peekskill has
special resonance for those who  treasure  the  history  of  the  Hudson
Valley as well as lovers of Civil War history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Utilizing  New  York  State  grants,  the  Lincoln  Depot
Foundation was able to reach their goal and a new structure, the Lincoln
Depot Visitor's Center, was completed  in  2019;  the  Visitor's  Center
houses the museum offices, additional exhibits, a small gift shop and an
open meeting room to hold events; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  on  display for 2024, the museum's exhibit, "New York
and Abraham Lincoln: The Indispensable Relationship," not only shows the
impact of Lincoln to Peekskill and the Hudson Valley region, but to  New
York as a whole; the importance of New York to Lincoln's success is also
highlighted;  it  is  the  only  such museum in the entire state and has
gained national attention and interest; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Under the able leadership of its President, John G. Testa,
the  museum  project  was  recognized  by  The  American  Institute  of
Architects  with  their  Design  Award  and  named  "Best  Museum  in
Westchester" by Westchester Magazine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining true to its mission,  the  Lincoln  Depot  Museum
explores, remembers, and educates audiences about the role local history
played on the national stage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  the  Lincoln  Depot  Museum is in direct
correlation to the efforts of  its  dedicated  staff  and  board,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in  all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the organization and the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
institutions  of  such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be recognized and applauded by all  the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the Lincoln Depot Museum; and be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable John G. Testa,  President  of  the  Lincoln
Depot Museum.
