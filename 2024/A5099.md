 AN ACT to amend the labor law,  in  relation  to  collective  bargaining
  rights  for  college  athletes,  and  authorizes the public employment
  relations board to exercise jurisdiction over institutions  of  higher
  education  and  college student athlete employees of such institutions
  in relation to all collective bargaining matters
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "New York
 college athlete right to organize act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. (a) The  National  Labor  Relations  Act  (29
 U.S.C.  151 et seq.) seeks to remedy the inequality of bargaining power
 between employees  and  employers  primarily  through  establishing  and
 protecting the rights of employees to self-organize and designate repre-
 sentatives  of  their  own  choosing  for the purpose of negotiating the
 terms and  conditions  of  their  employment  or  other  mutual  aid  or
 protection.  Labor  organizations  often  originate to remedy unfair and
 exploitative labor practices by employers through assisting employees in
 securing more  equitable  terms  and  conditions  of  their  employment,
 including  fair compensation and safe working conditions, which individ-
 ual employees would be unlikely to negotiate successfully for  on  their
 own. Labor organizations serve unique and essential purposes for profes-
 sional  athletes  competing  in sports leagues, where it is desirable to
 establish uniform rules and standards across multiple  employers.  These
 rules  and  standards  bear  significant consequences to the athletes in
 terms of compensation, health and safety, and the ability or lack there-
 of for athletes to choose their employer, among other issues related  to
 the  athletes'  well-being. The formation of labor organizations repres-
 enting athletes in professional sports leagues in the United States  has
 helped end exploitative practices by team owners and management, partic-

 ularly  through  establishing collective bargaining agreements that have
 secured athletes a fair share of the revenues  their  talent  and  labor
 produces,  as  well  as  more  equitable  terms  of their employment and
 protections for their short- and long-term health.
  (b)  College  athletes face exploitative and unfair labor practices by
 the National  Collegiate  Athletic  Association  (referred  to  in  this
 section  as  the  "NCAA") and its member institutions, primarily through
 the denial of the basic economic and  labor  rights  of  such  athletes,
 which  the  NCAA  and its member institutions have justified by defining
 college athletes as amateurs. The NCAA and its member institutions  have
 denied  college athletes a fair wage for their labor by colluding to cap
 compensation; they maintain strict and exacting control over  the  terms
 and conditions of college athletes' labor; and they exercise the ability
 to terminate an athlete's eligibility to compete if the athlete violates
 these  terms  and  conditions.  College  athletes exhibit the markers of
 employment as established under the common law definition  of  the  term
 "employee":  They  perform  a  valuable  service  for their respective
 colleges under a contract for hire in the form  of  grant-in-aid  agree-
 ments;  these  agreements  assert  significant control over how athletes
 perform their work and the conditions under which they  work;  and  they
 receive  compensation  in  the  form  of  grant-in-aid  and  stipends in
 exchange for their athletic services.
  (c) To establish more  equitable  terms  and  conditions  for  college
 athletes'  labor,  college  athletes  need  representation  of their own
 choosing  to  negotiate  collective  bargaining  agreements  with  their
 respective colleges and the athletic conferences that help set rules and
 standards  across  the  state. To organize effectively, college athletes
 must be able to form collective bargaining units across institutions  of
 higher  education  that  compete  against  each  other, including within
 athletic conferences in the state.
  § 3. Section 718 of the labor law is renumbered section  700-a  and  a
 new section 718 is added to read as follows:
  § 718. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS FOR COLLEGE ATHLETES. 1. THE BOARD

 ESTABLISHING A BARGAINING UNIT FOR SUCH EMPLOYEES AND ANY LABOR DISPUTE,
 INVOLVING SUCH INSTITUTIONS AND EMPLOYEES.
  2.  FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING AN APPROPRIATE BARGAINING UNIT FOR
 COLLEGE ATHLETE EMPLOYEES AT INSTITUTIONS  OF  HIGHER  EDUCATION  IN  AN
 INTERCOLLEGIATE  ATHLETIC CONFERENCE, THE BOARD SHALL RECOGNIZE MULTIPLE
 INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER  EDUCATION  WITHIN  AN  INTERCOLLEGIATE  ATHLETIC
 CONFERENCE  AS A MULTIEMPLOYER BARGAINING UNIT, BUT ONLY IF CONSENTED TO
 BY THE EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORTS  BARGAIN-
 ING  UNITS AT THE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT WILL BE INCLUDED

  3. NO PERSON SHALL ENTER INTO OR INDUCE ANY PERSON TO ENTER  INTO  ANY

  §  5.  Subdivision  3  of  section  701 of the labor law is amended by
 adding a new paragraph (d) to read as follows:

  (I) THE INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES ANY FORM OF DIRECT COMPENSATION, INCLUDING
 GRANT-IN-AID, FROM THE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION; AND
  (II)  ANY  TERMS  OR  CONDITIONS  OF SUCH COMPENSATION REQUIRE PARTIC-

 the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 152(3)) that was not  previ-
 ously  treated as income for which a tax may be imposed under the Inter-
 nal Revenue Code of 1986 to become a type  of  direct  compensation  for
 which a tax may be imposed under the New York state tax law;
  (b)  cause  any  individual to be treated as an employee, or cause any

 amounts would not otherwise be so treated;
  (c)  affect  the treatment of qualified scholarships under section 117
