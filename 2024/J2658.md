and  publicly  acknowledge individuals who have distinguished themselves
through their exemplary careers, accomplishments, and  purposeful  lives
of service to their community and their profession; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its

executives  representing  24  states and 50 major cities gathered in the
Washington, D.C. area to participate; they  exchanged  views  about  the
critically  high  rate  of  crime in the Black urban communities and the
socio-economic conditions that lead to crime and violence; and
 
  WHEREAS, NOBLE's mission of ensuring  equity  in  Law  Enforcement's
approach  to  the  communities it serves is also reflected in its annual
honoring and conferral of scholarships and awards to gifted students who
exemplify that goal and empower themselves to  excel  for  the  good  of
their community; and
