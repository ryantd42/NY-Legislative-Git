 AN ACT to authorize Jeffrey Alva Beall eligibility to apply for military
  service credit in the New York state teachers' retirement system
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Notwithstanding  subdivision  5  of  section  1000 of the
 retirement and social security law, Jeffrey Alva Beall, a retired member
 of the New York state teachers' retirement system,  who  was  on  active
 duty  in  the  United States Army from April 17, 1984 until February 27,
 1987, shall be eligible to apply for  military  service  credit,  to  be
 applied  retroactively  to  the  date of his retirement, in the New York
 state teachers' retirement system as otherwise provided pursuant to  the
 provisions  of  section  1000 of the retirement and social security law.
 To obtain such credit Mr. Beall shall pay the New York  state  teachers'
 retirement  system  a sum equal to the product of the number of years of
 military service he served, and three percent  of  Mr.  Beall's  compen-
 sation  earned  during  the  last  twelve consecutive months of credited
 service preceding the date of his retirement.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow Jeffrey Alva Beall, a retired Tier 4  member  of
 the  New York State Teachers' Retirement System, to purchase three years
 of service credit for his military service when he was on active duty in
 the United States Army from April 17, 1984 until February 27, 1987.  Mr.
 Beall  must  pay  a  sum  equal to the product of the number of years of
 military service credit and three percent  of  his  compensation  earned
 during  the last twelve consecutive months of credited service preceding
 his retirement. The increase in Mr. Beall's  pension  would  be  payable
 retroactively to his date of retirement. He was not eligible to purchase
 this  military  service  credit  upon  his  retirement in 2016 as it was
 before the law was changed to allow credit for military service rendered
 at any time, rather than during specified periods of war.

  The cost of this benefit is equal to the increase in the present value
 of liabilities minus Mr. Beall's contribution, which is estimated to  be
 $70,000. This cost would be borne by the employers of members of the New
 York State Teachers' Retirement System.
