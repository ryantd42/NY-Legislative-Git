 statistics for that college. Whenever an individual requests such campus
 crime  statistics,  the  college shall provide a hard copy mailed to the
 individual within ten days of the  request  and  that  information  will
 include  all  of the statistics that the campus is required to ascertain
 under Title 20 of the U.S. Code Section 1092(f).
