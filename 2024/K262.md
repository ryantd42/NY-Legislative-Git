BY: M. of A. Seawright
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 25, 2023, as Cerebral Palsy Awareness  Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
conditions  that  affect  the  lives  of  citizens of New York State and
across the Nation and World; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  25,  2023,  as
Cerebral  Palsy  Awareness  Day in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Cerebral Palsy Awareness  Day  is  observed  every
year  on  March  25th, and was first established in 2006 by Reaching for
the Stars (RFTS), a non-profit educational advocacy group run by  parent
volunteers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  the  entire  month  of March is considered National
Cerebral Palsy Awareness Month, March 25th is  a  nationally  recognized
holiday  intended to focus support for those affected by this condition;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital day of recognition serves to  provide  those  in
the  community  with  a platform to come forward and share their stories
while supporting one another; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Cerebral Palsy  Awareness  Day  also  provides  an
opportunity  to  educate  those  outside  of  the  cerebral  palsy  (CP)
community about the condition; those who wish to support  the  community
can  learn  about  life  with CP and determine ways to be more inclusive
towards those who live with it; most importantly, it allows  for  people
to learn how they can become long-term allies of the CP community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cerebral  palsy  is  a  group  of  neurological  disorders
affecting motor and developmental skills; according to the  Centers  for
Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC), about 1 in 345 children in the
United States have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy; it  is  the  most
common motor disability in children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cerebral  palsy  is not a genetic or contagious condition,
rather it is caused due to brain damage or  abnormal  brain  development
during  gestation,  during  birth  or  soon  after;  symptoms of CP vary
greatly from individual to individual; and
 
  WHEREAS, With nearly one million people living with  cerebral  palsy
in  the  United States, 75% of individuals with cerebral palsy also have
one or more developmental disabilities, including epilepsy, intellectual
disability, autism, visual impairment, or blindness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Days  of  recognition  which  bring  greater  awareness  to
disorders  and  neurological  health  issues, and assist people in their
quest to overcome these obstacles, are a great benefit to the health and
welfare of all citizens; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  25,  2023,  as
Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
