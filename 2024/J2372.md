  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that  the  quality
of  life of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched by
its exceptional cultural, educational,  and  recreational  institutions;
these  institutions  give  positive  definition  to  the  profile  and
disposition of the communities of the State of New York  and  profoundly
strengthen our society with their commitment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Yaphank  Historical Society in the Town of Brookhaven, New
York, in Suffolk County, upon  the  occasion  of  celebrating  its  50th
Anniversary  to  be  celebrated  by  a  series  of  monthly  events  and
culminating with its Anniversary Party on Saturday, August 10, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its founding in 1974, the Yaphank Historical  Society
has been a dedicated organization; its mission is to collect, interpret,
and  preserve  the  rich  history  of  the  Hamlet  of  Yaphank  and its
surrounding area; and
 
  WHEREAS, Seeing a need to preserve this rich heritage,  the  Yaphank
Historical  Society's  founding  members  acquired  the  mission  of
encouraging and supporting the preservation of historical buildings  and
landmarks,  as well as housing and preserving extensive special archival
exhibits and library collections; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  Yaphank  Historical  Society  was  founded  under  the
leadership of its first President, Eugene T. Dooley, who helped advocate
for  and  establish  an  official  designation  for the Yaphank Historic
District; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Yaphank Historical Society maintains and  manages  four
historic  houses,  three  of  which  are now on the National Register of
Historic Places, and it provides ongoing stewardship for  several  small
historic  burial grounds and the Carmans River Nature Trail & Sanctuary;
and
 
  WHEREAS, One of  the  historic  houses  the  Society  maintains  and
manages  is  the  Swezey-Avey  House which is designated as a Brookhaven
Town Historic Landmark and serves as the Headquarters  for  the  Yaphank
Historical Society; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Yaphank Historical Society educates the public, working
with  local  schools  and  other  community organizations to teach about
Yaphank's historic beginnings as an early American culture  of  sawmills
and gristmills; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The preservation efforts of the Yaphank Historical Society
include making publicly available archives and  library  collections  of
 
the  Yaphank  Hamlet  area  for study and research and offering tours of
historic period homes from the 18th and 19th centuries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  series  of  special events planned for the community,
which will culminate with the  Anniversary  Party  in  August  of  2024,
showcases the rich history of the Hamlet of Yaphank and demonstrates the
commitment  of  the  members of the Yaphank Historical Society to ensure
that this rich history will be passed on to the next generation; and
 
  WHEREAS, For the past 50 years, the Yaphank Historical  Society  has
allowed  citizens  to effectively learn about their local history and to
help the public appreciate and enjoy the Yaphank Historic District  with
all its natural and cultural heritage; now therefore, be it
