 Introduced  by  Sens. THOMAS, MATTERA -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to career  and  technical
  education  courses  provided  by  boards  of  cooperative  educational
  services

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The legislature hereby finds that
 career and technical education courses operated by a  board  of  cooper-
 ative  educational services provide unique educational and career oppor-
 tunities for students. Students from local  districts  should  have  the
 opportunity  to  enroll in such courses offered by boards of cooperative
 educational services. Therefore, it is in  the  best  interests  of  the
 students  in each local district to apply and, if accepted, to enroll in
 career and technical education programs operated by  boards  of  cooper-
 ative  educational  services without prior approval from the local board
 of education.
  § 2. Section 4602 of the education law is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 subdivision 6 to read as follows:
  6.  EACH BOARD OF COOPERATIVE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES SHALL BE AUTHORIZED
 TO ENROLL STUDENTS FROM EACH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CAREER AND TECHNI-
 CAL EDUCATION COURSES IF SUCH STUDENTS ARE ACCEPTED TO SUCH COURSES.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
