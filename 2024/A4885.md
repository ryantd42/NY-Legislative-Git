 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  participation by free association libraries in the New York state  and
  local employees' retirement system

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding
 a new section 31-g to read as follows:
  § 31-G. PARTICIPATION BY FREE ASSOCIATION LIBRARIES.  A  FREE  ASSOCI-
 ATION  LIBRARY  AS  DEFINED  IN  SECTION  TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE OF THE
 EDUCATION LAW AND WHICH MEETS THE CRITERIA SET FORTH  IN  THIS  SECTION,
 MAY  BY RESOLUTION ADOPTED AS PROVIDED IN SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT OF
 THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION LAW BY ITS BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND  SUBJECT
 TO  THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPTROLLER, ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RETIRE-
 MENT SYSTEM. ACCEPTANCE OF ITS EMPLOYEES FOR MEMBERSHIP IN  THE  RETIRE-
 MENT SYSTEM SHALL BE MANDATORY WITH THE COMPTROLLER, WHO SHALL DETERMINE
 THE  AMOUNTS  OF CONTRIBUTION PAYABLE BY SUCH LIBRARY AND ITS EMPLOYEES,
 SHALL RESOLVE QUESTIONS OF CREDIT FOR PRIOR SERVICE, AND  SHALL  IN  ALL
 OTHER  RESPECTS  ASSURE THAT SUCH EMPLOYEES SHARE THE SAME RIGHTS, OBLI-
 GATIONS AND BENEFITS AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM.  A  FREE
 ASSOCIATION  LIBRARY  SHALL  BE  ELIGIBLE  TO JOIN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM
 UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:
  (A) SUCH LIBRARY SHALL BE CHARTERED BY THE STATE BOARD OF REGENTS;
  (B) SUCH LIBRARY SHALL SERVE THE ENTIRE POPULATION  OF  ITS  CHARTERED
 SERVICE AREA;
  (C)  THE  BOARD  OF  TRUSTEES  OF SUCH LIBRARY SHALL BE ELECTED BY THE

  (E) AT LEAST FIFTY-ONE PERCENT OF SUCH LIBRARY'S BUDGET  SHALL  DERIVE
 FROM PUBLIC SOURCES; AND
  (F)  SUCH LIBRARY SHALL FILE THE ANNUAL REPORT WITH THE COMPTROLLER AS
 REQUIRED OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES BY SECTION THIRTY OF THE GENERAL  MUNICIPAL
 LAW.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would permit any free association public library which meets
 certain  specific  criteria to elect participation in the New York State
 and Local Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS).
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative  session,  and  an
 eligible  corporation elects participation, the future annual cost would
 depend on the retirement plan adopted and the  billable  salary  of  the
 electing corporation.
  As  a  percentage  of  payroll, we anticipate that the annual contrib-
 utions of the affected corporation for the fiscal year ending March  31,
 2024, will be as follows:
 
  Tier  Rate
  1  9.8% to 19.7%
  2  9.1% to 18.0%
  3  14.8%
  4  14.8%
  5  12.8%
  6  9.4%

  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 a  deficiency cost to the affected corporation which will be payable for
 a 25-year period. This cost will depend on  the  age,  service,  salary,
 tier status and plan of the affected employees.
  Internal  Revenue  Service (IRS) plan qualification issues: permitting
 participation of non-governmental employees in the NYSLERS  could  jeop-
 ardize  the  Retirement  System's  governmental  plan  status  and  its
 exemption from ERISA. This development could result in the loss of qual-
 ified status, which would mean the loss of  tax  benefits.  This  result
 would  substantially  impair  the  System's  value  to our more than one
 million participants.
  Prior to the enactment of this legislation, we recommend that a favor-
 able ruling be obtained from the IRS stating that these provisions would
 not harm the qualification status of the System. It  is  estimated  that
 the  costs  to obtain such a ruling would be $28,000 for the services of
 the IRS, and $800 per hour for legal consultants
