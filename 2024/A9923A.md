  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "college student suicide prevention act".
  § 2. The education law is amended by adding a new article 4 to read as

  ARTICLE 4
  COLLEGE STUDENT SUICIDE PREVENTION
 
 SECTION 190. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
  191. DEFINITIONS.
  192. POLICIES,  PROCEDURES,  AND  GUIDELINES  FOR  COLLEGES  AND
  UNIVERSITIES.
  193. APPLICATION.

 SECOND  LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS TEN TO TWENTY-
 FOUR YEARS OF AGE, INCLUSIVE, ACROSS BOTH THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND  THE
 UNITED  STATES  AND  SUICIDE  RATES  NEARLY DOUBLED AMONG NEW YORK STATE

 TY-FOUR  YEARS  OF AGE, THE LARGEST AGE DEMOGRAPHIC ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES,

 A. 9923  2
 
 LUMINA  FOUNDATION'S  NATIONAL STATE OF HIGHER EDUCATION SURVEY, AND THE
 AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH ASSOCIATION'S NATIONAL COLLEGE HEALTH ASSESSMENT
 DECLARED THAT UNITED STATES COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE EXPERIENCING  HISTORIC
 LEVELS  OF  DEPRESSION,  ANXIETY,  SUICIDAL IDEATION, FREQUENT EMOTIONAL
 STRESS, OVERALL MODERATE TO SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS,  AND  LONELI-
 NESS.
  3.  ACCORDING  TO  THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION, NEW
 YORK STATE IS NOT AMONG THE TWENTY-ONE  STATES  THAT  UNIFORMLY  REQUIRE
 INSTITUTIONS  OF  HIGHER  EDUCATION  TO  ADOPT  SPECIFIC, EVIDENCE-BASED
 SUICIDE PREVENTION POLICIES BY LAW. SUCH POLICIES  INCLUDE  THE  REGULAR
 DISSEMINATION  OF  INFORMATION  ON AVAILABLE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AND
 SERVICES TO STUDENTS, AS WELL AS THE INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF  GUIDELINES
 AND PROTOCOLS TO INFORM STAFF ON HOW TO RESPOND TO A STUDENT IN SUICIDAL
 CRISIS,  IN  ORDER TO MOST EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT THOSE AT RISK AND EMPOWER
 STUDENTS TO PROACTIVELY SEEK HELP.
  4. ACCORDING TO DATA FROM HEALTHY CUNY, AS REPORTED IN  THE  YEAR  TWO
 THOUSAND  TWENTY-ONE,  MORE THAN HALF OF ALL CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
 STUDENTS REPORT EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. WHILE  NEARLY  EVERY
 CITY  UNIVERSITY  OF  NEW  YORK  INSTITUTION  HOUSES  ITS OWN COUNSELING
 CENTER, DATA REPORTED BY THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK BOARD OF  TRUS-
 TEES  IN  THE  BOARD'S FOUR-YEAR FINANCIAL PLAN RELEASED IN THE YEAR TWO
 THOUSAND NINETEEN STATED THAT  THE  AVERAGE  STUDENT-TO-COUNSELOR  RATIO
 ACROSS  THE  CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK SYSTEM IS AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND
 FOUR HUNDRED-TO-ONE. UNTIL ADEQUATE STAFFING  LEVELS  OF  MENTAL  HEALTH
 PROFESSIONALS  CAN  BE  SUSTAINABLY  FUNDED,  UNIFORMLY REQUIRING HIGHER
 EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY  PROVIDERS
 IS  IMPERATIVE  TO  MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AT SUCH INSTITUTIONS WITH
 LARGE STUDENT-TO-COUNSELOR RATIOS OR WHOSE STUDENT POPULATIONS PRIMARILY
 LIVE OFF-CAMPUS.
  5. ESTABLISHING GATEKEEPER SUICIDE PREVENTION  OR  MENTAL  HEALTH  AID
 TRAINING  REQUIREMENTS  AND  OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLEGE RESIDENTIAL STAFF
 AND OTHER STUDENT-FACING POSITIONS HAS BEEN  RECOMMENDED  BY  THE  STATE
 UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS TASK FORCE AND
 ADOPTED BY DOZENS OF STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER,
 THESE  REQUIREMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN MODELED BY MANY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSI-
 TIES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE  UNIVERSITY  OF  NEW  YORK  SYSTEM,  WEAKENING
 PREPAREDNESS  FRAMEWORKS FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING OTHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
 INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION ALIKE.  AS  STUDENTS  MOST  OFTEN  SEEK
 EMOTIONAL  SUPPORT FROM PEERS AND THOSE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY, INSTITUTIONS
 MUST COMPEL RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANTS AND STAFF TO UTILIZE THE  FREE  QUES-
 TION,  PERSUADE,  AND  REFER  SUICIDE  PREVENTION TRAINING ALREADY FULLY
 FUNDED BY STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK FOR ALL NEW  YORK  STATE  COLLEGE
 STUDENTS  IN  ORDER  TO  BOLSTER  THEIR  PREPAREDNESS FOR SUCH EMERGENCY
 SCENARIOS.
  6. NEW YORK STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES  ARE  FACING  A  DEEPENING
 MENTAL  HEALTH  CRISIS AMONG STUDENTS, MARKED BY INCREASES IN THE PREVA-
 LENCE OF THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE AND  ATTEMPTS.  ALL  LEVELS  OF  COLLEGIATE
 STAFF  MUST  BE  EQUIPPED  BY  THEIR  RESPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS' POLICIES,
 GUIDELINES AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO EFFECTIVELY  AND  APPROPRIATELY
 PREVENT  STUDENT  SUICIDE,  INTERVENE  IN CRISIS SITUATIONS, AND SUPPORT
 THEIR COLLEGE COMMUNITIES IN POSTVENTION.
