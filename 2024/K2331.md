BY: M. of A. Rules (Sayegh)
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 28, 2024, as Albanian-American Heritage Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions,  to  recognize and pay tribute to all who
foster ethnic pride and enhance the profile of cultural diversity  which
thereby strengthens the fabric of the communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim November 28, 2024, as
Albanian-American Heritage Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Albania fought for its cultural and political autonomy from
the Ottoman rule and were successful on November 28, 1912; as is typical
of New York, the state has served as a place for many to come in  search
of  opportunities  for upward mobility; this has remained consistent for
Albanian-Americans as there are an estimated 500,000  Albanians  in  New
York according to a CUNY report; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States  and Albania continue to have a stable
relationship as they are involved in many  of  the  same  organizations;
Albania  joined  the  North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2009
which continued to strengthen the foreign relationship; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  acknowledge  various
cultures  of  people who add to the overall diversity of our State, and,
on this occasion, we take the opportunity to recognize the contributions
made by the Albanian-American community and extend best wishes to all of
its members as they hold  appropriate  ceremonies  to  commemorate  this
historic milestone; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  November  28,  2024,  as
Albanian-American  Heritage  Day  in  the  State  of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
