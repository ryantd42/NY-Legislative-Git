  HONORING  the  Utica  Oneida  County Branch of the
  NAACP upon the occasion of hosting its  40th  Annual
  Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute March on January
  15, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  enduring  organizations  which  devote  their
purposeful energies to improving the quality  and  dignity  of  life  of
those  they  serve, to preserving their heritage, and to fostering pride
among them; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the  Utica  Oneida  Branch of the NAACP upon the occasion of hosting its
40th Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute March on Monday,  January
15, 2024, at St. Paul's Baptist Church, Utica, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This annual observance is a time to celebrate, commemorate
and honor the life, legacy and impact of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; the
event gives citizens of the community the unique  opportunity  to  learn
and unite in celebration of Dr. King's groundbreaking work; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  as  we  witness  nations  around  the  world
continue to struggle under the weight of  violence,  hate  and  poverty,
todays,  social,  political,  and  economic landscape reveals the urgent
necessity of Dr.  King's philosophy and methodology of non-violence,  as
a sustainable solution to injustice and violence in our world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The oldest and largest civil rights organization, the NAACP
was  founded  in  1909,  in  New York City by a group of black and white
citizens  committed  to  improving  the  quality  of  life  for
African-Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1962,  after  observing  that the political and social
mores in Oneida County  did  not  support  the  needs  of  the  minority
population,  Ed  Bass began working tirelessly to organize a local NAACP
branch to assist minority groups in obtaining equal rights; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the years, the Utica Oneida County Branch's  effective
utilization  of  the  NAACP  committee  system  has  kept an eye out for
minority participation in all areas  of  the  community,  and  has  sent
leadership  delegations  to State conventions in Buffalo, New York City,
Syracuse, Rochester, Geneva, Westchester, and  Albany,  as  well  as  to
National Conventions in Indianapolis, Baltimore, and New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  the  Utica Oneida County NAACP has
hosted countless initiatives and events, including Black History  Month,
Soul  Day,  Juneteenth,  and Kwanzaa celebrations, as well as Dr. Martin
Luther King Tributes, Freedom Fund Dinners, Diversity  Affairs,  Poverty
Symposiums,  League  of  Women Political Debates, and Voter Registration
Drives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally, this vital organization has worked to address
environmental issues through organized cleanups and tree plantings,  and
established  a  direct link to the Chief of Police to keep communication
lines open between the community and local law enforcement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the  Utica  Oneida  County  Branch  of  the  NAACP
continues to fulfill its mission to ensure the  political,  educational,
social,  and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate
racial hatred and racial discrimination; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of the great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
commends the Utica Oneida County Branch of the NAACP for its  excellence
and  for  its  commitment  and contributions to the community it so ably
serves; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  the  Utica Oneida County Branch of the NAACP upon the occasion of
hosting its 40th Annual Dr. Martin Luther  King  Jr.  Tribute  March  on
January 15, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Utica Oneida County Branch of the NAACP.
