 law, as amended by chapter 717 of the laws of 1967, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  1.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of any other law, the terms of any
 contract or franchise, the authority shall have the power at  all  times
 to  fix or adjust the rate or rates of fare to be charged for the use of
 any transit facility operated by the authority as may in the judgment of
 the authority be necessary to maintain the operations of  the  authority
 on  a  self-sustaining  basis,  UPON  APPROVAL  OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER
 PURSUANT TO SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE-C OF THIS  ARTICLE.  The
 operations  of  the authority shall be deemed to be on a self-sustaining
 basis, as required by this title, when the authority is able to pay from
 revenue, from any funds granted or transferred to the authority pursuant
 to any provision  of  law,  including  funds  granted  pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of  section ninety-eight-b of the general municipal law, and

 ough bridge and tunnel  authority  shall  have  outstanding  and  unpaid
 bonds,  notes  or other obligations secured by or payable from, in whole
 or in part, the revenues, assets or other monies of the authority or its
 subsidiary corporations, the authority shall have the power at all times
 to  fix or adjust the rate or rates of fare to be charged for the use of
 any transit facility operated by the authority,  UPON  APPROVAL  OF  THE
 STATE  COMPTROLLER  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE-C OF
 THIS ARTICLE, as may, in the judgment of  the  board,  be  necessary  to
 produce  sufficient  revenues  to pay, as the same shall become due, the
 principal of and interest on such bonds, notes and other obligations  of
 the  authority,  metropolitan  transportation  authority  and Triborough
 bridge and tunnel authority, together with  the  maintenance  of  proper
 reserves  therefor,  in  addition to paying as the same shall become due

 transportation  authority  and  Triborough  bridge and tunnel authority,
 shall be authorized to contract with the holders of  such  bonds,  notes
 and  other obligations with respect to the exercise of the power author-
 ized by this section. In furtherance of the mandate of the  metropolitan
 transportation  authority to develop and implement a unified mass trans-
 portation policy for the metropolitan commuter  transportation  district

 bonds and other obligations secured in whole or in part by the  revenues
 of  the  authority  and  its  subsidiaries,  metropolitan transportation
 authority and its subsidiaries, and the  Triborough  bridge  and  tunnel
 authority, the authority shall join with the metropolitan transportation
 authority  in  connection with the establishment, levy and collection of
 fares, tolls, rentals, rates, charges and other fees for the transporta-
 tion of passengers on any transit facilities operated by  authority  and
 its subsidiaries, including any changes thereto.
  §  3.  Subdivision 3 of section 1266 of the public authorities law, as
 amended by chapter 314 of the laws  of  1981,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  3.  [The] EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE-C OF
 THIS TITLE, THE authority may establish, levy and collect or cause to be
 established, levied and collected and, in the case of  a  joint  service
 arrangement,  join with others in the establishment, levy and collection
 of such fares, tolls, rentals, rates, charges and other fees as  it  may
 deem necessary, convenient or desirable for the use and operation of any
 transportation  facility  and related services operated by the authority
 or by a subsidiary corporation of the authority or under contract, lease
 or other arrangement, including joint  service  arrangements,  with  the
 authority.  Any such fares, tolls, rentals, rates, charges or other fees
 for the transportation of passengers shall be  established  and  changed
 only if approved by resolution of the authority adopted by not less than
 a  majority vote of the whole number of members of the authority then in
 office, with the chairman having one additional vote in the event  of  a
 tie  vote,  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE-C OF
 THIS TITLE, and only after a  public  hearing,  provided  however,  that
 fares,  tolls, rentals, rates, charges or other fees for the transporta-
 tion of passengers on any transportation facility which are in effect at
 the time that the then owner of such transportation facility  becomes  a
 subsidiary corporation of the authority or at the time that operation of
 such  transportation  facility  is  commenced  by  the  authority  or is
 commenced under contract, lease or other  arrangement,  including  joint
 service  arrangements,  with  the  authority  may be continued in effect
 without such a hearing. Such fares, tolls, rentals, rates,  charges  and

 other  fees shall be established as may in the judgment of the authority
 be necessary to maintain the combined operations of  the  authority  and
 its  subsidiary corporations on a self-sustaining basis.  The said oper-
 ations  shall  be deemed to be on a self-sustaining basis as required by
 this title, when the authority is able to pay or cause to be  paid  from
 revenue  and  any  other  funds  or  property  actually available to the
 authority and its subsidiary corporations (a) as the same  shall  become
 due,  the  principal  of  and  interest on the bonds and notes and other
 obligations of  the  authority  and  of  such  subsidiary  corporations,
 together  with the maintenance of proper reserves therefor, (b) the cost
 and expense of keeping the properties and assets of  the  authority  and
 its  subsidiary  corporations  in good condition and repair, and (c) the
 capital and operating expenses  of  the  authority  and  its  subsidiary
 corporations.  The  authority may contract with the holders of bonds and
 notes with respect to the exercise of  the  powers  authorized  by  this
 section.  No  acts  or  activities  taken or proposed to be taken by the
 authority or any subsidiary of the authority pursuant to the  provisions
 of  this subdivision shall be deemed to be "actions" for the purposes or
 within the meaning of article eight of  the  environmental  conservation
 law.

 1265-c to read as follows:
