 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The education law is amended by adding a new section  689-b

  §  689-B.  NET  PRICE  CALCULATOR  CENTER. 1. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS
 SECTION:

 INCLUDING  GRANTS  AND  SCHOLARSHIPS, THAT IT COSTS TO ATTEND A COLLEGE,
 WHICH MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER EXPENSES, TUITION AND FEES,  HOUSING  AND
 MEALS,  ALLOWANCES  FOR  BOOKS,  SUPPLIES, TRANSPORTATION, AND DEPENDENT
 CARE.
  (B) "NET PRICE" SHALL MEAN THE ESTIMATED COST OF ATTENDANCE AT A GIVEN
 COLLEGE AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL AID WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE REPAY-
 MENT.

 A COLLEGE.
  2. (A) THE PRESIDENT SHALL,  IN  CONJUNCTION  WITH  THE  COMMISSIONER,
 CREATE A NET PRICE CALCULATOR CENTER WHICH PROVIDES A NET PRICE CALCULA-
 TOR  TOOL  FOR  ALL  COLLEGES  IN  THIS STATE. SUCH NET PRICE CALCULATOR
 CENTER SHALL BE PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED ON AND EASILY ACCESSED THROUGH THE
 CORPORATION'S WEBSITE.
  (B) THE PRESIDENT AND COMMISSIONER MAY  INCORPORATE  INFORMATION  FROM
 EXISTING NET PRICE CALCULATORS ON A COLLEGE'S WEBSITE WHEN DESIGNING THE
 NET PRICE CALCULATOR TOOL TO BE HOSTED ON THE CORPORATION'S WEBSITE, BUT
 SUCH CALCULATOR SHALL EXIST AS A SINGULAR CALCULATOR ABLE TO PROVIDE NET

  (D)  THE  PRESIDENT  AND  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  UTILIZE THE TUITION AND
 RELATED COST INFORMATION  MOST  RECENTLY  REPORTED  BY  A  COLLEGE  WHEN
 DESIGNING  THE  NET  PRICE  CALCULATOR  DESCRIBED  HEREIN.  IF A COLLEGE
 UPDATES ITS ESTIMATED COST OF  ATTENDANCE,  EITHER  ON  ITS  WEBSITE  OR
 OTHERWISE, THE NET PRICE CALCULATOR SHALL INCORPORATE SUCH UPDATED COSTS
 INTO ITS CALCULATIONS.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
 on or before such effective date.
