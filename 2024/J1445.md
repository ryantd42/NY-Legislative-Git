  COMMEMORATING  the 50th Anniversary of Long Island
  Wine Country on August 19, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the practice of this Legislative  Body  to  recognize
and support organizations and events of significance which contribute to
the  entertainment  and vitality of the communities they serve and which
exemplify the history and development of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Long Island Wine Country, celebrated
on Saturday, August 19, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  50th  Anniversary  Grand  Celebration  celebrates  the
founding  of  the  Long Island wine region when Louisa and Alex Hargrave
planted the first wine grapes in 1973; in attendance was Louisa  herself
along  with  other  pioneers  of  the  industry,  including  many of the
winemakers who have dedicated their entire careers  creating  the  wines
residents and visitors have come to love; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  1989,  the  Long  Island  Wine  Country
Organization was initially formed to help prospective  growers  navigate
the  challenges  of  starting  businesses  on  Long Island; it has since
evolved into an  organization  designed  to  help  Long  Island  achieve
recognition as a premium winegrowing region; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Long  Island's  oldest  vineyard  took  root  in  1973, in
Cutchogue, New York, with the radical vision of Alex and Louisa Hargrave
who became pioneers of the viticulture industry of the East End; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Soon  after,  pioneering  investors,  grape-growers,  and
winemakers  followed  suit;  their shared vision, unique experience, and
expertise created a rich, diverse culture dedicated to  the  pursuit  of
making exceptional wine; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Five  decades  after  its  inception, the Long Island wine
region is one of the most exciting rising stars of the winemaking world,
boasting 57 distinct wine producers, who are divided between  the  North
Fork, South Fork, and western Suffolk County; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion presents an opportunity for this
Legislative Body to recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  Long  Island  Wine
Country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  50th Anniversary of Long Island Wine Country on August
19, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Long  Island  Wine Country Organization, Riverhead, New
York.
