  RECOGNIZING  the  celebration  of  the Festival of
  Diwali on November 12, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body, in keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to those who
foster ethnic pride and enhance the profile of cultural diversity  which
strengthens  the  fabric  of the communities of this great Empire State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is  justly  proud  to  recognize  the
celebration of the Festival of Diwali on Sunday, November 12, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Festival of Diwali, commonly known as the Festival of
Lights, is a major holiday  which  has  both  religious  and  historical
significance for Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains; and
 
  WHEREAS, The word Diwali is a shortened version of the Sanskrit term
Deepavali  and  symbolizes the spiritual victory of light over darkness,
of good over evil, and of knowledge over ignorance; and
 
  WHEREAS, Celebrants of Diwali believe the "rows of lamps"  symbolize
the  light  within  the individual that rids the soul of the darkness of
ignorance; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Festival  of  Diwali  also  celebrates  the  coming  of
monsoon  season  and  the  end  of  the  summer harvest; each faith that
celebrates this holiday connects it with different stories and religious
significances; and
 
  WHEREAS, Diwali, which falls on the last day of  the  month  in  the
lunar  calendar,  is  celebrated  as  both a day of thanksgiving and the
beginning of the new year for many Hindus; and
 
  WHEREAS, For Sikhs, Diwali is feted as the day  the  sixth  founding
Sikh  Guru,  or  revered  teacher,  Guru Hargobind ji, was released from
captivity from the ruling Mughal Emperor; and
 
  WHEREAS, For Jains, Diwali marks the anniversary of  the  attainment
of  moksha  or liberation by Mahavira, the last of the Tirthankaras, who
were the great teachers of Jain dharma, at the end of his  life  in  527
B.C.; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  festival is celebrated over five days, with the third
day being the most significant, as it coincides with the  darkest  night
of the lunar month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People begin the celebration on the first day of Diwali by
cleaning,  decorating  and  renovating  their  homes  and  workplaces;
celebrators  also  wear  their  finest  clothing,  participate in family
feasts, and illuminate lamps in their homes; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the second day, celebrators pray for peace  and  perform
rituals  to  liberate  souls  who  suffer  and  to  promote  spiritual
auspiciousness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  the  third  day,  the youngest members of families
visit with elders, and celebrate the harvest with  friends,  family  and
colleagues;  at  dusk  followers  recite  prayers and perform rituals to
welcome prosperity and happiness in the coming year; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the fourth  day,  families  celebrate  the  bounties  of
marriage,  with  couples  providing  gifts  to  one  another and parents
inviting  children  and  their  spouses  to  celebrate;  the  final  day
celebrates the bond between siblings; and
 
  WHEREAS, A longstanding holiday, Diwali is mentioned by Indian Kings
in Sanskrit documents dating back to the 7th and 9th centuries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the practice of this Legislative Body to recognize
those who celebrate their rich ethnic flavor and who strive to  preserve
their cultural heritage; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize the celebration of the Festival of Diwali; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the South Asian community of the State of New York.
