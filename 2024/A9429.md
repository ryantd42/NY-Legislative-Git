 local laws, rules, licensing requirements, where applicable, and  execu-

 that such businesses be concurrently certified as  minority-  or  women-

  (d)  "Design-build  contract" shall mean a contract for the design and
 construction of a public work with a single entity, which may be a  team

  (D-1)  "PROGRESSIVE  DESIGN-BUILD  CONTRACT" SHALL MEAN A CONTRACT FOR
 THE  DESIGN  AND CONSTRUCTION  OF A PUBLIC WORK WITH  A  SINGLE  ENTITY,
 WHICH  MAY  BE  A  TEAM COMPRISED OF SEPARATE ENTITIES, THAT IS SELECTED
 THROUGH A QUALIFICATIONS-BASED SELECTION AT THE EARLIEST FEASIBLE  STAGE
 OF THE PROJECT.
  (e)  "Project  labor  agreement"  shall  have the meaning set forth in
 subdivision 1 of section 222 of the labor law. A project labor agreement
 shall require participation in apprentice training programs  in  accord-
 ance with paragraph (e) of subdivision 2 of such section.
  (F)  "QUALIFICATIONS-BASED  SELECTION"  MEANS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE
 AUTHORIZED  ENTITY SOLICITS FOR SERVICES FROM  THE  PROGRESSIVE  DESIGN-
 A. 9429  3
 
 BUILD  ENTITIES  AND  THAT  PRICE IS NOT THE SOLE FACTOR AS THE BASIS OF
 AWARD, OR THE COST RANGE IS NOT YET DETERMINED.
  §  3.  Any contract for a public work undertaken pursuant to a project

 design-build contract OR A PROGRESSIVE DESIGN-BUILD CONTRACT in  accord-
 ance with this act.

 lation to the contrary, including but not limited to section 7210 of the
 education law, article 5-A of the general municipal law,  article  8  of
 the  public  housing law, sections 1734 and 1735 of the public authori-
 ties law and section 8 of the New York city health and hospitals  corpo-
 ration act, and in conformity with the requirements of this act, for any
 public  work  that  has  an  estimated  cost of not less than 10 million
 dollars and is undertaken pursuant  to  a  project  labor  agreement  in
 accordance  with  section  222  of  the  labor law, an authorized entity
 charged with awarding a contract for public work may use the alternative
 delivery [method] METHODS referred to  as  design-build  OR  PROGRESSIVE
 DESIGN-BUILD  contracts.  Provided, however, that any authorized entity
 charged with awarding a contract for  public  work  in  connection  with
 property  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the New York city department of
 parks and recreation or the New York city housing authority  is  author-
 ized  to use the alternative delivery method referred to as design-build
 OR PROGRESSIVE DESIGN-BUILD contracts for any such public work that  has
 an  estimated  cost  of  not  less than one million two hundred thousand
 dollars if such public work is otherwise in conformity with the require-
 ments of this act. Provided further that any authorized entity  may  use
 the  alternative delivery method referred to as design-build OR PROGRES-
 SIVE DESIGN-BUILD contracts for any public work that  has  an  estimated
 cost  of  not less than one million two hundred thousand dollars if such
 public work is otherwise in conformity with the requirements of this act
 and primarily consists of: pedestrian ramps and  similar  infrastructure
 to  improve  access to sidewalks in the city of New York for people with
 disabilities;  renovation  and  construction  of  cultural  institutions
 located  on  publicly owned real property and of public libraries in the
 city of New York; or security infrastructure, including bollards,  plan-
 ters and other physical structures, designed to protect life and proper-
 ty from acts of terror or mass violence.
  (a) A contractor selected by such an authorized entity to enter into a
 design-build  contract  shall  be selected through a two-step method, as
 follows:
  (1) Step one. Generation of a list of responding  entities  that  have
 demonstrated  the  general  capability  to  perform  the  design-build
 contract. Such list shall consist of a specified  number  of  responding
 entities,  as determined by an authorized entity, and shall be generated
 based upon the authorized entity's review of  responses  to  a  publicly
 advertised  request  for qualifications. The authorized entity's request
 for qualifications shall include a general  description  of  the  public
 work,  the  maximum  number of responding entities to be included on the
 list, the selection criteria to be used and the relative weight of  each
 criteria  in generating the list.  Such selection criteria shall include
 the qualifications and experience of the design and  construction  team,
 organization,  demonstrated  responsibility, ability of the team or of a
 member or members of the team to comply  with  applicable  requirements,
 including  the  provisions of articles 145, 147 and 148 of the education
 law, past record of compliance with the labor law, and such other quali-
 fications the authorized entity deems appropriate, which may include but
 A. 9429  4
 
 are not limited  to  project  understanding,  financial  capability  and
 record  of  past  performance.  The authorized entity shall evaluate and
 rate all responding entities to the request for qualifications.  Based
 upon such ratings, the authorized entity shall list the responding enti-
 ties that shall receive a request for proposals in accordance with para-
 graph  two of this subdivision. To the extent consistent with applicable
 federal law, the authorized entity shall  consider,  when  awarding  any
 contract  pursuant  to this section, the participation of (i) responding
 entities that are certified as minority- or women-owned business  enter-
 prises  pursuant  to  article  15-A  of  the executive law, or certified
 pursuant to local law as minority- or women-owned business  enterprises,
 or,  where  the  New York city school construction authority acts as the
 authorized entity, certified pursuant to  section  1743  of  the  public
 authorities law; and (ii) small business concerns identified pursuant to
 subdivision  (b) of section 139-g of the state finance law. In addition,
 nothing in this section shall be deemed to supersede any  pre-qualifica-
 tion  guidelines  or  requirements  otherwise  authorized  by law for an
 authorized entity.
  (2) Step two. Selection of the proposal which is the best value to the
 authorized entity.  The authorized entity shall  issue  a  request  for
 proposals to the responding entities listed pursuant to paragraph one of
 this  subdivision.  If  such  a  responding entity consists of a team of
 separate entities, the entities that comprise such a  team  must  remain
 unchanged from the responding entity as listed pursuant to paragraph one
 of  this subdivision unless otherwise approved by the authorized entity.
 The request for proposals shall set forth the  public  work's  scope  of
 work,  and  other  requirements, as determined by the authorized entity,
 which may include separate goals for  work  under  the  contract  to  be
 performed  by  businesses certified as minority- or women-owned business
 enterprises pursuant to article 15-A of the  executive  law  or  section
 1743  of  the public authorities law, or certified pursuant to local law
 as minority-  or  women-owned  business  enterprises.  The  request  for
 proposals  shall  also  specify  the criteria to be used to evaluate the
 responses and the relative weight of each of such criteria. Such  crite-
 ria  shall  include  the  proposal's cost, the quality of the proposal's
 solution, the qualifications and experience of the proposer,  and  other
 factors  deemed  pertinent  by the authorized entity, which may include,
 but shall not be limited to,  the  proposal's  manner  and  schedule  of
 project implementation, the proposer's ability to complete the work in a
 timely  and  satisfactory  manner,  maintenance  costs  of the completed
 public work, maintenance of traffic approach, and community impact.  Any
 contract  awarded  pursuant to this act shall be awarded to a responsive
 and responsible proposer, which, in consideration  of  these  and  other
 specified  criteria  deemed  pertinent, offers the best value, as deter-
 mined by the authorized entity. The request for proposals shall  include
 a  statement that proposers shall designate in writing those portions of
 the proposal that contain trade secrets or other proprietary information
 that are to remain confidential; that the material designated as  confi-
 dential  shall  be  readily separable from the proposal. Nothing in this
 subdivision shall be construed to prohibit the  authorized  entity  from
 negotiating  final  contract  terms  and  conditions including cost. All
 proposals submitted shall be scored according to the criteria listed  in
 the  request  for  proposals and such final scores shall be published on
 the authorized entity's website after registration of such  contract  or
 the  date  upon  which such contract may be implemented, if registration
 requirements do not apply.

 of work comprising the public work.
  § 5. Any contract entered into pursuant to this act  shall  include  a

 sealed, where appropriate, by a professional licensed in accordance with
 the appropriate article.
  § 6. Construction with respect to each contract  entered  into  by  an
 authorized  entity  pursuant to this act shall be deemed a "public work"
 to be performed in accordance with the provisions of article  8  of  the
 labor  law, as well as subject to sections 200, 240, 241 and 242 of such
 law and enforcement of prevailing wage requirements pursuant to applica-

 enterprises.
  §  8. Public works undertaken by an authorized entity pursuant to this
 act shall be subject to the requirements of article 8  of  the  environ-

 rights  or  benefits,  including terms and conditions of employment, and
 protection of civil service and  collective  bargaining  status  of  all
 employees  of  authorized entities solely in connection with public work
 undertaken by an authorized  entity  pursuant  to  this  act,  shall  be
 preserved and protected.
  (b)  Nothing  in this act shall result in the: (1) displacement of any
 currently  employed  worker  or  loss  of  position  (including  partial
 displacement  such  as  a  reduction  in the hours of non-overtime work,

 ment  act  shall  continue  to be governed by the provisions of such act
 while such provisions are in effect.
