  HONORING  Isabelle  Ilan  for  her  outstanding
  education,  research,  advocacy,  and  fundraising
  efforts for lymphatic disease awareness
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body that the quality
and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York  State  are
reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of organizations and
individuals committed to helping to improve the lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern and  fully  in  accord  with  its
long-standing  tradition, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
and pay tribute to Isabelle Ilan, a dedicated  medical  student  at  the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Lymphedema  Day  is  an annual celebratory event to
raise awareness and encourage collaboration  among  people  living  with
lymphatic  diseases,  healthcare  professionals,  policymakers,  and the
public to collectively strive towards a world where  lymphatic  diseases
are a global priority and ultimately cured; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Up  to  ten  million  Americans,  and  250  million people
worldwide, live with lymphedema and lymphatic diseases,  including  many
that have received treatment for cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Isabelle  Ilan's advocacy began with a personal connection
to lymphangiectasia, a rare lymphatic disease  affecting  the  digestive
system,  which  was  diagnosed  in  her  family member, inspiring her to
become a passionate advocate for those affected  by  lymphatic  diseases
through  her  exceptional  service to the Lymphatic Education & Research
Network (LE&RN); and
 
  WHEREAS, Along with her family, Isabelle Ilan fundraised for the New
York Run/Walk to Fight Lymphedema & Lymphatic Diseases and  LE&RN's  New
York City Marathon Team; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Isabelle  Ilan  is  an  early  investigator  demonstrating
dedication to the lymphatic field through  her  internship  at  Memorial
Sloan  Kettering Cancer Center and her research contributions to The Lee
Lab at Cornell University, culminating in the publication of  her  work,
an exceptional achievement for a college student; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Isabelle  Ilan  has  promoted lymphatic disease education,
research,  and  advocacy  as  an  Ambassador  of  LE&RN,  and  her
accomplishments  amplify  the mission of World Lymphedema Day, inspiring
the next generation of researchers and healthcare providers; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  those  who
enhance  the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown a
long and sustained commitment to excellence certainly  have  earned  the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Isabelle Ilan  for  her  outstanding  advocacy  and  promotion  of
lymphedema education and awareness; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Isabelle Ilan and LE&RN.
