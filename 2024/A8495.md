  § 2. Section 1200 of the private housing finance law, as amended by  a
 chapter  of  the  laws  of 2023 amending the private housing finance law
 relating to requiring the division of housing and community  renewal  to
 provide  an  annual  report  on the New York access to home programs, as
 proposed in legislative bills  numbers  S.  3139-A  and  A.  1686-A,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  § 1200. Statement of legislative findings and purpose. The legislature
 hereby  finds and declares that there exists in New York state a serious
 need for financial and technical resources to assist renters and proper-
 ty owners to make dwelling units accessible for low and moderate  income
 persons  with disabilities. Providing assistance with the cost of adapt-
 ing homes will enable many New Yorkers with disabilities to  safely  and
 comfortably  continue to, or return to, live in their residences instead
 of residing in an institutional setting. The  division  of  housing  and
 community  renewal  shall  undertake  an  ongoing  effort to promote the
 availability of the access to home programs to all POTENTIALLY  eligible
 [applicants  and  persons  with  eligible properties, as those terms are
 defined under this article,  both]  LOCAL  ADMINISTRATORS  to  encourage
 participation in the program [and gauge unmet need].  Such actions shall
 include  working  with any other state agencies that provide services to
 persons with disabilities to promote the access to home  programs.  Such
 actions  shall also include but are not limited to providing contact and
 application information on the website for the division of  housing  and
 community  renewal  for  eligible  [applicants] LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS and
 [persons with eligible properties]  POTENTIALLY  ELIGIBLE  BENEFICIARIES
 which shall be updated annually.
  §  3.  This  act  shall  take  effect on the same date and in the same
 manner as a chapter of the laws of 2023  amending  the  private  housing
 finance  law relating to requiring the division of housing and community
 renewal to provide an annual report on  the  New  York  access  to  home
 programs,  as  proposed  in  legislative  bills numbers S. 3139-A and A.
 1686-A, takes effect.
