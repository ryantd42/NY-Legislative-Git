 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  McDONOUGH  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Real Property Taxation
 
 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the John Theissen Children Foundation,
  Inc.  to receive retroactive real property tax exempt status
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the John Theissen Children Foundation, Inc. an application for exemption
 from  real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real property
 tax law for the 2022-2023 assessment roll for a portion of the 2022-2023
 school taxes and a portion of the 2022  general  taxes  for  the  parcel
 conveyed  to such organization located at 1492 Wantagh Avenue, hamlet of
 Wantagh, town of Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as  Nassau
 county  tax map section 56, block H, lot 2319. If accepted, the applica-
 tion shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxa-
 ble status dates established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject roll. If such exemption is  granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject roll, the applicable governing body or tax  department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
