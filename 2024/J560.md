  HONORING  Annfiera  McPherson upon the occasion of
  her  designation  as  recipient  of  a  2023

  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  take  note  of
and  publicly  acknowledge individuals who have distinguished themselves
through their exemplary careers, accomplishments, and  purposeful  lives
of service to their community and their profession; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Annfiera McPherson upon the occasion of her designation as recipient  of
a  2023  Women-N-Motion  Empowerment  Award by the Young, Gifted & Black
Entrepreneurial Awards Program to be celebrated at its Awards Brunch  on
Sunday, March 26, 2023, at the Simpson Restaurant and Bar, Brooklyn, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded  by  Carl O. Gray, the Young, Gifted & Black (YGB)
Entrepreneurial Awards Program recognizes individuals  who  continue  to
reach  levels  of  great  success  through  hard work and determination,
proving to be inspiring role models to their community and peers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, in conjunction with the observance of  Women's
History  Month,  this  auspicious  occasion features several outstanding
women who are leaders, motivators,  business  professionals,  innovators
and entrepreneurs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Annfiera McPherson grew up as an only child who would work
for hours on various craft  projects  with  her  grandmother,  including
crocheting,  embroidery,  designing and creating straw hats, and various
delicious desserts; and
 
  WHEREAS, These craft projects allowed Annfiera McPherson to  explore
her  creative abilities from an early age, and ultimately paved the path
to her embracing a successful career  in  the  design  and  construction
field; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Later  in  life,  Annfiera  McPherson developed a love for
healing crystals and started  researching  their  different  properties,
leading  her  to discover the artform of crystal copper wrapped jewelry;
this passion quickly evolved into something unexpected which  eventually
gave birth to her own business, ModernRelx, in 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  artistic  direction  of  Annfiera  McPherson,
ModernRelx's jewelry merges the gap between antiques and everyday pieces
while  incorporating  healing  crystals  which  carry  high  vibrational
frequencies  and  when  worn,  provide many benefits for the human body;
when crystals are  merged  with  pure  copper,  the  healing  properties
increase one's vibrational frequency; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The designs from ModernRelx allow individuals to enjoy one
of a kind handmade creations  while  embracing  healing  energy  emitted
 
throughout  the  body;  this  vital  business  will  continue to explore
various  limitless  boundaries  while  incorporating  innovative  design
utilizing copper and healing crystals for everyday use; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown by an
individual for the  benefit  of  others  which  Annfiera  McPherson  has
displayed throughout her life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative Body to commend
individuals of outstanding character,  who  have  shown  initiative  and
commitment  toward  constantly pursuing higher goals for themselves, and
acting as role models of leadership to be emulated  by  both  peers  and
young people; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Annfiera  McPherson  upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation  as
recipient  of  a  2023  Women-N-Motion  Empowerment  Award by the Young,
Gifted & Black Entrepreneurial Awards Program; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Annfiera McPherson.
