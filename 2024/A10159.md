  §  2. Subdivision 1 of section 202 of the education law, as amended by
 chapter 547 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  1. The University of the State of New York shall be governed  and  all
 its corporate powers exercised by a board of regents the number of whose
 members  shall at all times be AT LEAST four more than the number of the
 then existing judicial districts of the state and shall not be less than
 fifteen.  BASED ON ANNUAL ENROLLMENT DATA  COLLECTED  AS  PART  OF  THE
 EDUCATION  DEPARTMENT'S  STUDENT INFORMATION REPOSITORY SYSTEM, JUDICIAL
 DISTRICTS CONTAINING K-TWELVE STUDENT ENROLLMENT WHICH  EXCEEDS  FIFTEEN
 PERCENT OF THE STATE'S TOTAL K-TWELVE ENROLLMENT SHALL BE REPRESENTED BY

 ty-four shall hold office, in the order  of  their  election,  for  such
 times  that  the term of one such regent will expire in each year on the
 first day of April. Commencing April first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-
 four,  each regent shall be elected for a term of seven years, each such
 term to expire on the first day of April.  Commencing  on  April  first,
 nineteen hundred ninety-four, each regent shall be elected for a term of
 five  years,  each  such term to expire on the first day of April.  Each
 regent shall be elected by the legislature by concurrent  resolution  in
 the  preceding March, on or before the first Tuesday of such month.  If,
 however, the legislature fails to agree on such concurrent resolution by
 the first Tuesday of such month, then the two houses shall meet in joint
 session at noon on the second Tuesday of such month and proceed to elect
 such regent by joint ballot.
