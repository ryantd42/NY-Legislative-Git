  21.  (a) Each electric corporation subject to section twenty-five-a of
 this chapter shall annually, on or before December fifteenth, submit  to
 the  commission  an emergency response plan for review and approval. The
 emergency response plan shall be  designed  for  the  reasonably  prompt
 restoration  of  service  in the case of an emergency event, defined for
 purposes of this subdivision as an event where widespread  outages  have
 occurred  in  the  service territory of the company due to storms, cyber
 attack, or other causes beyond the control of the company. The emergency
 response plan shall include, but need not be limited to, the  following:
 (i) the identification of management staff responsible for company oper-
 ations  during  an  emergency; (ii) a communications PLAN THAT INCLUDES:
 (A) A system [with] THAT COMMUNICATES SERVICE INFORMATION  TO  customers
 during  an emergency that extends beyond normal business hours and busi-
 ness conditions; [(iii)] (B) identification of  and  outreach  plans  to
 customers  who  had  documented their need for essential electricity for
 medical needs, which shall include but not be limited to, apnea monitors
 for infants, cuirass  respirators,  hemodialysis  machines,  IV  feeding
 machines,  IV  medical infusion machines, oxygen concentrators, positive
 pressure respirators, respirator/ventilators, rocking  bed  respirators,
 suction  machines,  tank type respirators, as well as any medical equip-
 ment or equipment necessary for an individual whose diagnosis is  likely
 to  be significantly triggered or significantly exacerbated by a contin-
 ued loss of power that will adversely impact that  individual's  health;
 [(iv)]  (C)  identification  of  and outreach plans to customers who had
 documented their need for  essential  electricity  to  provide  critical
 telecommunications,  critical transportation, critical fuel distribution
 services or other large-load customers  identified  by  the  commission;
 [(v)]  (D)  designation of company staff to communicate with local offi-
 cials and appropriate regulatory agencies; [(vi)]  AND  (E)  IDENTIFIES,
 TESTS  AND  VERIFIES  REDUNDANCIES  IN  COMMUNICATIONS  SYSTEMS;  (III)
 provisions regarding how the company  will  assure  the  safety  of  its
 employees and contractors; [(vii)] (IV) procedures for deploying company
 and  mutual aid crews to work assignment areas; [(viii)] (V) identifica-
 tion of additional supplies and equipment needed  during  an  emergency;
 [(ix)]  (VI)  the  means of obtaining additional supplies and equipment;
 [(x)] (VII) procedures to practice the emergency response  plan;  [(xi)]
 (VIII)  appropriate  safety  precautions  regarding  electrical hazards,
 including plans to promptly secure downed wires within thirty-six  hours
 of  notification  of  the location of such downed wires from a municipal
 emergency official; [(xii)] (IX) plans setting forth  how  the  communi-
 cation  and  coordination  of  efforts between the electric corporation,
 electric corporation  employees,  electric  corporation  company  crews,
 mutual aid crews, other utilities, local governments and any other enti-
 ty  performing services to assist such electric corporation shall occur;
 and [(xiii)] (X) such other additional information as the commission may
 require.  Each such corporation shall, on  an  annual  basis,  undertake
 drills  implementing  procedures  to  practice  its emergency management
 plan. The commission may adopt additional requirements  consistent  with
 ensuring  the reasonably prompt restoration of service in the case of an
 emergency event.
  (b) After review of  a  corporation's  emergency  response  plan,  the
 commission  may  require such corporation to amend the plan. The commis-
 sion may also open an investigation of the corporation's plan to  deter-
 S. 4882  8
 
 mine  its  sufficiency to respond adequately to an emergency event.  If,
 after hearings, the commission finds a material deficiency in the  plan,
 it  may  order  the  company  to  make  such modifications that it deems
 reasonably necessary to remedy the deficiency.
  (c)  The  commission  is authorized to open an investigation to review
 the performance of any corporation in  restoring  service,  IMPLEMENTING
 COMMUNICATIONS  PLANS or otherwise meeting the requirements of the emer-
 gency response plan during an emergency  event.  If,  after  evidentiary
 hearings  or  other investigatory proceedings, the commission finds that
 the corporation failed to [reasonably] implement its emergency  response
 plan  or the length of such corporation's outages were materially longer
 than they would have been, because  of  such  corporation's  failure  to
 [reasonably]  implement  its emergency response plan, the commission may
 deny the recovery of any part of the service restoration costs caused by
 such failure, commensurate with the degree and  impact  of  the  service
 outage;  provided,  however, that nothing herein limits the commission's
 authority to otherwise commence a proceeding pursuant to sections  twen-
 ty-four, twenty-five and twenty-five-a of this chapter.
  (d) The commission shall certify to the department of homeland securi-
 ty  and  emergency  services  that  each  such  corporation's  emergency
 response plan is sufficient to ensure to the  greatest  extent  feasible
 the timely and safe restoration of energy services after an emergency in
 compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
  (e)  The  filing  of each emergency response plan required under para-
 graph (a) of this subdivision shall also include a copy of  all  written
 mutual assistance agreements among utilities.
  (f)  Each electric corporation shall file with the county executive or
 the chief elected official of  a  county  for  each  county  within  its
 service  territory  the  most  recent  approved  copy  of  the emergency
 response plan required pursuant to this section. For the purposes of  an
 electric  corporation operating within the city of New York, such corpo-
 ration shall file the most recent approved emergency response plan  with
 the emergency management office of the city of New York.
  (g)  The  commission  shall  provide access to such emergency response
 plan pursuant to article six of the public officers law.
  § 5. Section 94 of the public service law is amended by adding  a  new
 subdivision 5 to read as follows:
  5.  (A) EACH CORPORATION SUBJECT TO THIS ARTICLE SHALL ANNUALLY, ON OR
 BEFORE  DECEMBER  FIFTEENTH,  SUBMIT  TO  THE  COMMISSION  AN  EMERGENCY

 THE COMPANY DUE TO STORMS OR OTHER CAUSES  BEYOND  THE  CONTROL  OF  THE
 COMPANY.  THE  EMERGENCY  RESPONSE  PLAN  SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NEED NOT BE
 LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: (I) THE IDENTIFICATION  OF  MANAGEMENT  STAFF

 CATIONS PLAN THAT INCLUDES (A) A SYSTEM THAT COMMUNICATES SERVICE INFOR-

 REQUIREMENTS CONSISTENT WITH ENSURING THE REASONABLY PROMPT  RESTORATION
 OF SERVICE IN THE CASE OF AN EMERGENCY EVENT.
  (B)  AFTER  REVIEW  OF  A  CORPORATION'S  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN, THE
 COMMISSION MAY REQUIRE SUCH CORPORATION TO AMEND THE PLAN.  THE  COMMIS-
 SION  MAY ALSO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CORPORATION'S PLAN TO DETER-
 MINE ITS SUFFICIENCY TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO AN  EMERGENCY  EVENT.  IF,
