  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would modify the service retirement benefit for members of
 the New York State and  Local  Employees'  Retirement  System  (NYSLERS)
 covered  by the provisions of Retirement and Social Security Law section
 89-p. The modified service retirement benefit will be one-half of  final
 average  salary (FAS) upon completion of twenty-five years of creditable
 service with additional sixtieths for each year of creditable service in
 excess of twenty-five years but not more than fifteen  such  years.  The
 current service retirement benefit is one-half of FAS upon completion of
 twenty-five years of creditable service.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $4.4 million in
 the annual contributions of the affected counties for  the  fiscal  year
 ending  March  31,  2025.  In  future  years  this cost will vary but is
 expected to average 1.1% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $41.2 million which will
 be shared by the affected counties and  will  be  borne  as  a  one-time
 payment.  This estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1,
 2025.
  Detailed costs with a breakdown by affected counties are as follows:
