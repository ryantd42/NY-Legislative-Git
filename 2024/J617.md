significant contributions to the quality of life therein; and

commendation for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf  of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  February  1, 2023, Helen B. Duffield Elementary School
teacher aide Stella Tsimis was working in the cafeteria during lunchtime
when she heard two students yelling "Seren is choking" and saw the young
girl running toward her, with a red face, and  pointing  to  herself  to
show she was struggling; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Without  hesitation,  Stella Tsimis performed the Heimlich
maneuver on the terrified 7-year-old, successfully dislodging  the  food
from her esophagus; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Seren Mavruk immediately and gratefully gave Stella Tsimis
a hug and she and her friends drew her a picture on a poster board  that
was surrounded by stars and hearts and read "Thank You HERO"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Those who have the privilege of knowing Stella Tsimis, know
she  is  always ready and willing to lend a helping hand and always puts
others first; she has a heart of gold and is known for the kindness  and
generosity she bestows upon everyone she meets, especially children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  longtime  resident  of  Nesconset,  Long Island, Stella
Tsimis is a  loving,  supportive  wife  to  her  husband  George  and  a
dedicated  mother  to  her  four  boys,  Elias,  Alexander,  Zachary and
Michael; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prior to her employment with Helen B.  Duffield  Elementary
School, Stella Tsimis spent many years working in the healthcare sector,
serving  in  a  variety  of  roles  for  sundry medical fields including
dermatology, neurology and cardiology; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fortunately for Seren and each and every  student,  teacher
and  staff  member  at  the  elementary  school,  Stella Tsimis has been
trained in CPR and various life-saving techniques; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Stella  Tsimis  also  volunteers  her  time  and energy to

consummate courage and heroic actions; now, therefore, be it
