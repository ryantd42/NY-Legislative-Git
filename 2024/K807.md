  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 2024, as Mentoring Month in the State of New
  York, in conjunction with the observance of National
  Mentoring Month
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months that are set aside to increase awareness of issues that
affect the lives of the citizens of this State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it is the intent of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2024, as Mentoring
Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance  of
National Mentoring Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Mentoring  Month  is  a  campaign run throughout
January by MENTOR and MENTOR Affiliates across the country; launched  in
2002,  the  campaign  aims  to  unify and expand the mentoring movement,
celebrate the power of relationships, and  raise  awareness  around  the
importance of youth mentoring in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mentoring  is an essential part of closing the opportunity
gap that exists across  our  society,  talent  is  equally  distributed,
however,  opportunity  is not; mentoring gives every young person a fair
chance to graduate college and fulfill their potential; and
 
  WHEREAS, Young people who  were  at-risk  for  not  completing  high
school,  but  who  had  a  mentor were 55% more likely to be enrolled in
college than those who did not have a mentor; they were also:  81%  more
likely  to  report  participating regularly in sports or extracurricular
activities, 78% more likely to volunteer regularly in their communities,
and more than twice as likely to say they held a leadership position  in
a club or sports team; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mentoring provides support and instills confidence in first
generation  college students, which can make all the difference on their
path to a successful life; first generation students  with  mentors  are
far  more  likely  to  attend  and  graduate  from college than students
without; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mentoring  is  a  tool  to  uplift  historically  oppressed
communities  where  New  York's  most  vulnerable  populations  reside,
providing guidance,  support  and  access  to  resources  otherwise  not
available to these communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  benefits  of  mentorship  uplifts  a  variety  of
enterprises, including the development of employees,  support  of  young
people, and inspiration and preparation of college students; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mentoring  not  only  has positive impacts on mentees, but
also provides an opportunity for mentors to expand their  own  knowledge
and  experience,  making  for  a  more  compassionate society; mentoring
 
enables people to unleash their full potential by learning from  others;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2024, as Mentoring
Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance  of
National Mentoring Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
