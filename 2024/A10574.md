 ably practicable, and subject to such deviation as may be necessary,  in

 a differing amount is  required  for  an  innovative  technology  demon-
 stration  project;  provided,  however,  that in the case of any munici-

 ble to the portion of such project financed with  such  loan  shall  be,
 subject  to  maximum financial limitations as may otherwise be necessary
 and prescribed by the commissioner and the director of the  division  of
 the  budget,  fifty percent of the principal balance outstanding on such
 loan at any time for such eligible project,  to  the  extent  reasonably
 practicable,  and  subject  to  such  deviation  as may be necessary, in
 connection with the administration and investment of moneys in the fund,
 unless allocations in differing amounts  are  necessary  to  preclude  a
 determination  by  the commissioner or the corporation pursuant to para-
 graph e of subdivision eight of this section or unless an allocation  in
 a  differing  amount  is  required  for  an innovative technology demon-

 ted by federal or state law, moneys in the drinking water revolving fund
 may be transferred to and used for the purposes authorized for the water
 pollution  control  revolving  fund,  and  moneys in the water pollution
 control revolving fund may be transferred to and used for  the  purposes

 drinking water revolving fund shall  be  applied  to  or  paid  out  for

 this section and title four of article eleven of the public health  law.
 To the extent approved by the commissioner of health and the commission-
 er  of  environmental conservation and notwithstanding the provisions of

 to the transfer of moneys between such  accounts  or  subaccounts.  With
 respect  to  each  eligible project, the corporation shall establish and
 maintain a record of the allocation provided for  the  benefit  of  such
 project  in accordance with the terms of the applicable financing agree-
 ment. MONEYS OF THE FUND SHALL BE ALLOCATED TO MUNICIPALITIES FOR ELIGI-
