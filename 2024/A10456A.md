 Introduced  by COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Fahy, McDo-
  nald) -- read once and referred to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the lease of  certain  lands  for  the
  Albany NanoTech Complex
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the  state
 university  of  New York at Albany ("UAlbany") seeks to use a portion of
 the grounds and facilities on the UAlbany campus for the purposes of the
 Albany NanoTech Complex. The New  York  Center  for  Research,  Economic
 Advancement, Technology, Engineering and Science Corporation (hereinaft-
 er referred to as "NY CREATES"), is the owner and operator of the Albany
 NanoTech  Complex,  the nation's largest and most advanced semiconductor
 R&D facility that brings together industry leaders, academia and  inter-
 national  partners to develop next-generation chips and chip fabrication
 processes, and is focused on facilitating  industry  and  public-private
 partnerships  for  next-generation semiconductor technology R&D, commer-
 cialization, regional economic  development  and  workforce  development
 projects.  NY  CREATES  is  the parent company of Fuller Road Management
 Corporation, a 501(c)(25) corporation established  for  the  purpose  of
 holding  real estate for projects of the State University of New York at
 Albany. UAlbany is one of the most diverse public research  institutions
 in  the  nation  and  a national leader in educational equity and social
 mobility. As a Carnegie-classified R1 institution, UAlbany  faculty  and
 students  advance our understanding of the world in fields such as arti-
 ficial  intelligence,  semiconductors,  atmospheric  and  environmental
 sciences, public health, emergency preparedness, engineering, the social
 sciences,  humanities,  and  social  welfare.  At  its founding in 2004,
 UAlbany's College of Nanotechnology, Science, and  Engineering  was  the
 first  in the nation devoted specifically to the study of nanotechnology
 and was a critical academic partner in the development  of  NY  CREATES'
 Albany  NanoTech Complex. The University's diverse student body combined
 with its broad research portfolio put it in a uniquely  strong  position

 to  play  a major role in diversifying the next generation of New York's
 STEM workforce.
  The  legislature further finds that UAlbany and NY CREATES have under-
 gone long-term collaborations in: (i) fundamental and  applied  research
 projects  utilizing the equipment and expertise available in both organ-
 izations; (ii) workforce development and training programs to  grow  the
 next  generation  of semiconductor engineers and technicians; and, (iii)
 joint technology commercialization efforts  to  expand  the  market  for
 intellectual property.
  The legislature further finds that the ground lease authorized by this
 legislation  would  benefit  UAlbany, SUNY, and the State of New York by
 advancing: (1) Opportunities for UAlbany  and  other  SUNY  faculty  and
 students to collaborate with NY CREATES, industry and government profes-
 sionals  to develop innovative academic programing and advance workforce
 development initiatives while  promoting  NY  CREATES'  Albany  NanoTech
 Complex  nationally  and  globally to grow its reputation; (2) Continued
 support of UAlbany's and other SUNY academic partnerships with  external
 consortiums with industry, and government agencies nationally and inter-
 nationally; (3) Collaboration on programs to train next generation semi-
 conductor  engineers  and  technicians, providing students with hands-on
 experience  and  industry-relevant  skills  through  internships,  co-op
 programs,  and  collaborative  research  projects, and to cohost events,
 workshops, and seminars aimed at fostering entrepreneurship, creativity,
 and innovation; and (4) Pursuit of opportunities for public and  private
 partnerships  to  fund  joint  and  collaborative  research initiatives,
 economic development opportunities, technology  transfer  programs,  and
 infrastructure  development  projects that benefit UAlbany, SUNY, and NY
 CREATES.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the state  univer-
 sity  trustees are authorized and empowered, without any public bidding,
 to lease and otherwise contract to make available  to  the  Fuller  Road
 Management Corporation a portion of the lands of the university general-
 ly  described  in  this  act  for  the  purposes  of the Albany NanoTech
 Complex.  Such lease or contract shall be without any fee simple convey-
 ance and otherwise upon terms and conditions determined  by  such  trus-
 tees,  subject  to  the  approval of the director of the division of the
 budget, the attorney general and the state  comptroller.  In  the  event
 that  the  real  property  that is the subject of such lease or contract
 shall cease to be used for the purpose described in this act, such lease
 or contract shall immediately terminate, and the real property  and  any
 improvements  thereon  shall revert to the state university of New York.
 Any lease or contract entered into pursuant to this act shall be  for  a
 period  not  exceeding  forty  years, and provide that the real property
 that is the subject of such lease or contract and any improvements ther-
 eon shall revert to the state university of New York on  the  expiration
 of such contract or lease.
  §  3. Any contract or lease entered into pursuant to this act shall be
