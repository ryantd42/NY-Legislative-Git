 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  real property law, in relation to requiring the
  disclosure of lead-based paint test  reports  in  real  estate  trans-
  actions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  lead  poisoning  of children persists as one of the most
 prevalent and preventable environmental  diseases  in  New  York  State.
 Nearly  100,000  children  were  newly identified with levels of lead in
 their blood at five micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) in New York  state
 between  2011  and  2015.  Medical research indicates that children can
 suffer permanent brain damage at blood levels even lower  than  5mcg/dL,
 and  that  there  is  no level of lead ingestion that is without adverse
 impact.  The predominant cause of lead poisoning in  young  children  is
 the ingestion of lead particles from deteriorating or abraded lead-based
 paint  from  older  and poorly maintained residences.  Although New York
 state banned the sale of lead-based paint in 1970, (l.1970, ch. 338) 74%
 of New York's housing stock was constructed prior to 1970 and lead-based
 paint was available outside of the state until 1978. New York state  has
 both  the  nation's  greatest number (over 4 million units), the highest
 percentage (55.08%) of pre-1960 and pre-1950 (41.0%)  housing,  and  the
 oldest housing inventory among the fifty states. At least ninety percent
 of  lead-based paint still exists in occupied housing built before 1960.
 New York state's older housing stock places residents at great  risk  of
 exposure to lead hazards, with low-income children living in older hous-
 ing  having  the highest risk of lead poisoning. Knowledge of lead-based

 paint hazards, their control, mitigation, abatement, and risk  avoidance
 is  not sufficiently widespread. In addition, while federal law requires
 the disclosure by sellers of real property of knowledge of the existence
 of  lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards, and encourages poten-
 tial buyers to conduct inspections for  lead-based  paint,  these  mech-
 anisms  neither mandate that such inspections take place either by sell-
 ers  or  buyers.  This  gap  in  disclosure  requirements  results  in
 residential  property  being  transferred  without  any knowledge of the
 potential for such property to cause lead poisoning  and  the  attendant
 liabilities.
  Local  county  health  departments  lack  sufficient information as to
 which housing contains lead-based paint and the locations of such  lead-
 based paint, resulting in less cost-effective prevention of lead poison-
 ing,  avoidable  harm to children's health, and wasted public resources.
 The purposes of this act are to assure that  properties  that  have  not
 been  previously  tested for lead-based paint are not simply transferred
 to new owners without knowledge of whether  there  is  lead-based  paint
 present,  and  to  better utilize the existing federal laws that mandate
 disclosure of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards and  to  aid
 in  the  prevention  of lead poisoning.  This act is not intended to and
 does not diminish the responsibility of buyers to carefully examine  the
 property  which they intend to purchase and public records pertaining to
 the property. This act is not intended to and does  not  limit  existing
 responsibilities by a seller, buyer or agent concerning the condition of
 the  property or potential liabilities or remedies at law, statute or in
 equity.
  This act will significantly improve the transfer  process  and  better
 serve  the interests of all parties to a home purchase. It will increase
 clarity regarding the nature of the property and  will  provide  greater
 certainty  to contracts entered into by better informed buyers and sell-
 ers. As well, it will provide incentive to owners  to  voluntarily  test
 their property prior to sale.
  §  2.  The  real property law is amended by adding a new article 16 to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 16
