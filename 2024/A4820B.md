 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  real property law, in relation to requiring the
  disclosure of lead-based paint test  reports  in  real  estate  trans-
  actions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. a.  The legislature hereby finds  and
 declares  that  lead  poisoning  of children persists as one of the most
 prevalent and preventable environmental  diseases  in  New  York  state.
 Nearly  100,000  children  were  newly identified with levels of lead in
 their blood at five micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) in New York  state
 between 2011 and 2015.
  b. Medical research indicates that children can suffer permanent brain
 damage  at  blood  levels even lower than 5 mcg/dL, and that there is no
 level of lead ingestion that is without adverse impact; indeed, in  2021
 the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised the blood
 lead reference level downward to 3.5 mcg/dL.
  c. Black children and children from low-income households are consist-
 ently  found  to  have  higher  levels of lead in their blood than their
 white peers or their peers from higher income households.
  d. The predominant cause of lead poisoning in young  children  is  the
 ingestion  of  lead  particles  from deteriorating or abraded lead-based

 paint from older and poorly maintained residences.  Although  New  York
 state banned the sale of lead-based paint in 1970, (l.1970, ch. 338) 74%
 of New York's housing stock was constructed prior to 1970 and lead-based
 paint  was available outside of the state until 1978. New York state has
 both the nation's greatest number (over 4 million  units),  the  highest
 percentage  (55.08%)  of  pre-1960 and pre-1950 (41.0%) housing, and the
 oldest housing inventory among the fifty states. At least ninety percent
 of lead-based paint still exists in occupied housing built before  1960.
 New  York  state's older housing stock places residents at great risk of
 exposure to lead hazards, with low-income children living in older hous-
 ing having the highest risk of lead poisoning.
  e. Knowledge of lead-based paint hazards, their  control,  mitigation,
 abatement,  and  risk avoidance is not sufficiently widespread. In addi-
 tion, while federal law requires the disclosure by sellers of real prop-
 erty of knowledge of the existence of lead-based  paint  and  lead-based
 paint  hazards,  and  encourages potential buyers to conduct inspections
 for  lead-based  paint,  these  mechanisms  neither  mandate  that  such
 inspections  take place either by sellers or buyers. This gap in disclo-
 sure requirements results  in  residential  property  being  transferred
 without  any  knowledge of the potential for such property to cause lead
 poisoning and the attendant liabilities.
  f. Local county health departments lack sufficient information  as  to
 which  housing contains lead-based paint and the locations of such lead-
 based paint, resulting in less cost-effective prevention of lead poison-
 ing, avoidable harm to children's health, and wasted public resources.
  g. The purposes of this act are to assure that  properties  that  have
 not  been  previously  tested for lead-based paint are not simply trans-
 ferred to new owners without knowledge of whether  there  is  lead-based
 paint  present,  and  to  better  utilize the existing federal laws that
 mandate disclosure of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards  and
 to aid in the prevention of lead poisoning.  This act is not intended to
 and  does not diminish the responsibility of buyers to carefully examine
 the property which they intend to purchase and public records pertaining
 to the property. This act is not intended to and does not limit existing
 responsibilities by a seller, buyer or agent concerning the condition of
 the property or potential liabilities or remedies at law, statute or  in
 equity.
  This  act  will  significantly improve the transfer process and better
 serve the interests of all parties to a home purchase. It will  increase
 clarity  regarding  the  nature of the property and will provide greater
 certainty to contracts entered into by better informed buyers and  sell-
 ers.  As  well,  it will provide incentive to owners to voluntarily test
 their property prior to sale.
  h. This act will complement existing state  and  local  laws  on  lead
 poisoning  prevention. Section 1377 of the public health law, enacted in
 2023, requires the department of health to develop  a  registry  of  all
 rental  residential  dwellings  with two or more units built before 1980
 within communities of concern outside the city of New York,  which  will
 also require such dwellings be inspected for lead hazards at least every
 three  years.  This act will ensure equity of information for purchasers
 of all residential property built prior to 1978 regardless  of  location
 or  number  of units by ensuring that they receive information about the
 presence of lead-based paint in dwellings they purchase.
  i. This act will require inspection  reports  that  are  developed  to
 comply  with this act to be included on the registry of lead inspections
 that the department of health is creating pursuant to  section  1377  of
 A. 4820--B  3
 
 the  public  health  law so that future renters and purchasers can learn
 about lead-based paint in homes they are considering renting or purchas-
 ing.
  j.  New  York city has already added a requirement, subdivision a-1 of
 section 27-2056.4 of the administrative code of the city  of  New  York,
 that all rental residential properties be tested one time for lead-based
 paint  by  August  2025.  This  act will not require re-testing of these
 residences when rental properties are sold; but will ensure  equity  and
 protect purchasers of residential properties across the state (including
 New York city) by requiring one-time testing for lead-based paint before
 any residential property is sold.
