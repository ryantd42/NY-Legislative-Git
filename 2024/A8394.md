 follows:
  1.  Within fifteen days after each general or special election, within
 thirteen days after every primary election, and within seven days  after
 every village election conducted by the board of elections, the board of
 elections  or a bipartisan committee appointed by such board shall audit
 the voter verifiable audit records from three percent of voting machines
 or systems within the jurisdiction of  such  board.  Such  audits  [may]

 RECOUNT. Voting machines or systems shall be selected for audit  through
 a random, manual process. At least five days prior to the time fixed for

 entitled to have had watchers present  at  the  polls  in  any  election
 district  in such board's jurisdiction. Such notice shall state the time
 and place fixed for such random selection process. The  audit  shall  be
 conducted  in the same manner, to the extent applicable, as a canvass of
 paper ballots. Each candidate, political party or independent body enti-
 tled to appoint watchers to attend at a polling place shall be  entitled
 to appoint such number of watchers to observe the audit.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
