 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure  law,  in  relation  to  youthful
  offender determinations
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 720.20 of the  criminal  procedure
 law,  as  amended by chapter 652 of the laws of 1974, is amended to read
 as follows:
  1.  Upon conviction of an eligible youth, the court must order a  pre-
 sentence  investigation  of  the defendant.  After receipt of a written
 report of the investigation and at the time of pronouncing sentence  the
 court  must  determine  whether  or not the eligible youth is a youthful
 offender.  Such determination shall be in accordance with the  following
 criteria:
  (a)  If in the opinion of the court the interest of justice would be
 served by relieving the eligible youth  from  the  onus  of  a  criminal
 record and by not imposing an indeterminate term of imprisonment of more
 than  four  years,  the  court may, in its discretion, find the eligible
 youth is a youthful offender; and
  (b)  Where the conviction is [had in a local criminal court and] FOR A
 MISDEMEANOR AND PROVIDED the eligible youth had not prior  to  commence-
 ment  of trial or entry of a plea of guilty been convicted of a crime or
 found a youthful offender, the court must find he is a  youthful  offen-
 der.
  §  2.  This  act  shall  take effect immediately and apply to criminal
 convictions of eligible youths entered into on and after such date.
