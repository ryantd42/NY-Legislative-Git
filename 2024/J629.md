  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2023, as Children's Dental Health Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to the  dental
societies,  teachers,  and  parents  who seek to promote the benefits of
pediatric oral health early on and throughout a child's life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  February  2023,  as
Children's  Dental Health Month in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of National Children's Dental Health Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Children's Dental  Health  Month  (NCDHM)  is  the
American  Dental  Association's  annual  health  observance  month which
brings together and engages  devoted  dental  professionals,  healthcare
providers,  and  teachers  from  around  the  country  in  promoting the
benefits of pediatric oral health early  on  and  throughout  a  child's
life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Month  of  pediatric  oral  health  will be
celebrating its Annual Children's Dental Health Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Children's Dental Health Month began in 1941, as  a  single
citywide  Advocacy  Day  and  celebration in Dayton, Ohio, and has since
grown to become a month-long celebration of pediatric oral health across
the country and at numerous military bases; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year during this month, local observances of pediatric
oral health occur in a variety of  activities  including  health  fairs,
coloring  and  essay contests, classroom presentations, museum exhibits,
and most notably free dental screenings through Give Kids A Smile; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial  Research
report  42% of children ages 2 to 11 have had dental cavities and nearly
23% of these cases go untreated; it is events such as Children's  Dental
Health  Month  that  allow  for  parents  and  children  to learn proper
pediatric oral health and the lifelong benefits of oral hygiene; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, the encouragement of pediatric oral health  is
of  the  utmost importance in securing a solid foundation of the overall
health and well-being of every family and child  in  New  York  and  the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Events  which  provide  a means of promoting the health of
America's future generations and which contribute to the prosperity  and
excellence of our great State and Nation, are held in the highest regard
by this Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  February  2023,  as
 
Children's  Dental  Health  Month  in  the  State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
