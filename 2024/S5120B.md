  §  66-U.  ELECTRIC  VEHICLE CHARGING STATION RELIABILITY REPORTING AND
 MAINTENANCE STANDARDS. 1. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS  SECTION,  THE  FOLLOWING
 TERMS HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A) "UPTIME" MEANS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGER'S HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
 ARE  BOTH  OPERATIONAL  AND  THE  ELECTRIC  VEHICLE CHARGER SUCCESSFULLY
 DISPENSES ELECTRICITY;
  (B) "CHARGING STATION" MEANS AN ELECTRICAL COMPONENT ASSEMBLY OR CLUS-
 TER OF COMPONENT ASSEMBLIES DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY  TO  CHARGE  BATTERIES
 WITHIN ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY PERMITTING THE TRANSFER OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY
 TO A BATTERY OR OTHER STORAGE DEVICE IN AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE; AND
  (C)  "EXCLUDED  TIME"  MEANS  THE  TIME  NOT INCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING
 UPTIME, AS DETERMINED PURSUANT TO THE DETERMINATION MADE BY THE  COMMIS-
 SION PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION.

 ING  STANDARDS  FOR  ELECTRIC  VEHICLE CHARGERS AND CHARGING STATIONS BY
 JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE, PROVIDED SUCH STANDARDS SHALL:

  (C)  FIRST  APPLY  TO  ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGERS AND CHARGING STATIONS
 INSTALLED ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE.
  3. THE COMMISSION SHALL CREATE A FORMULA TO CALCULATE UPTIME AND SHALL
 APPLY  IT  TO  EACH  ELECTRIC  VEHICLE  CHARGER  AND CHARGING STATION TO
 PROVIDE CONSISTENT, STANDARDIZED REPORTING OF INFORMATION ANNUALLY.
  4. THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE WHAT EVENTS THAT  MAKE  AN  ELECTRIC
 VEHICLE  CHARGER  INOPERABLE  CONSTITUTE  EXCLUDED  TIME FOR PURPOSES OF
 DEVELOPING THE FORMULA CREATED IN SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION. THE
 COMMISSION SHALL ONLY CONSIDER EVENTS THAT ARE OUTSIDE  OF  AN  ELECTRIC
 VEHICLE  CHARGER OPERATOR'S CONTROL FOR PURPOSES OF MAKING SUCH DETERMI-
 NATION WHICH MAY INCLUDE UPSTREAM ISSUES RELATED TO THE ELECTRICAL GRID,
 INTERNET AND CELLULAR CONNECTIVITY, AND VANDALISM, AS DETERMINED THROUGH
 A PROCESS FOR PUBLIC INPUT.
  5. THE COMMISSION SHALL DEVELOP MINIMUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONAL STANDARDS
 WHICH MAY VARY BY TECHNOLOGY TYPE,  POWER  LEVELS,  NUMBER  OF  ELECTRIC
 VEHICLE  CHARGERS  PER  SITE,  AND  SITE  OWNERSHIP. FACTORS MAY INCLUDE
 WHETHER ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGERS ARE NETWORKED, WHETHER ELECTRIC  VEHI-
 CLE CHARGERS ARE LEVEL 1 OR 2, DIRECT CURRENT FAST CHARGERS, AND WHETHER
 ELECTRIC  VEHICLE  CHARGERS  ARE  ALL  INCLUSIVE  MOBILE  SOLAR CHARGING
 STATIONS.
  6. BEGINNING JANUARY FIRST, TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-SIX  AND  EVERY  TWO
 YEARS THEREAFTER, THE COMMISSION SHALL ASSESS THE UPTIME OF THE ELECTRIC
 VEHICLE  CHARGING  STATION  INFRASTRUCTURE,  INCLUDING  AT  MINIMUM,  AN
 ASSESSMENT OF EQUITABLE ACCESS TO RELIABLE CHARGING  STATIONS  IN  LOW-,
 MODERATE-, AND HIGH-INCOME COMMUNITIES. ANY DATA PUBLISHED OR MAINTAINED
 FOR  ANY  PUBLIC  FACING  PURPOSE BY THE COMMISSION SHALL BE AGGREGATED,
 ANONYMIZED, AND NOT COMPANY SPECIFIC.
  7. BEGINNING JANUARY FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FIVE,  ALL  FUNDING
 RECIPIENTS  PARTICIPATING  IN  PROGRAMS  PRESCRIBED  IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF
 SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION SHALL MAINTAIN A MINIMUM  SERVICE  LEVEL
 AGREEMENT  TO  REPAIR  AND MAINTAIN THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING EQUIP-
 MENTS' HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. TO REACH CONSISTENT RELIABILITY  AND  HIGH
 UPTIME,  A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT SHALL BE IN EFFECT ONCE THE APPLICANT
 IS APPROVED. THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT SHALL BE IMPLEMENTED BEFORE THE
 CHARGER IS COMMISSIONED FOR  USE.  THE  SERVICE  LEVEL  AGREEMENT  SHALL
 REMAIN  IN  EFFECT FOR A MINIMUM OF SIX YEARS. THE COMMISSION MAY DETER-
 MINE IF MORE TIME SHALL BE REQUIRED.
  8. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO  THE  CONTRARY,  THE
