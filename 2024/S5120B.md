 WITHIN ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY PERMITTING THE TRANSFER OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY
 TO A BATTERY OR OTHER STORAGE DEVICE IN AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE;
  (B)  "EXCLUDED  TIME"  MEANS  THE  TIME  NOT INCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING
 UPTIME, AS DETERMINED PURSUANT TO THE DETERMINATION MADE BY THE  COMMIS-
 SION PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION; AND
  (C) "UPTIME" MEANS THE TIME A CHARGING STATION'S HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
 ARE  BOTH  OPERATIONAL  AND THE CHARGING STATION IS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY
 DISPENSE ELECTRICITY. "UPTIME" SHALL NOT INCLUDE EXCLUDED TIME.
  2. BEGINNING APRIL FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, AN ENTITY THAT  IS
 RECEIVING  AN  INCENTIVE FUNDED BY A STATE AGENCY OR THROUGH A CHARGE ON
 RATEPAYERS TO INSTALL, OWN, OR OPERATE A CHARGING STATION, IN  WHOLE  OR
 IN  PART,  SHALL  REPORT  CHARGING STATION UPTIME TO THE COMMISSION. THE
 SERVICE PROVIDER SELECTED BY SUCH ENTITY TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY FOR SUCH
 CHARGING STATIONS SHALL PROVIDE THIS DATA ON BEHALF OF  THE  ENTITY  AND

 UNLESS THE COMMISSION DETERMINES MORE TIME IS NEEDED TO COLLECT DATA.
  3. THE COMMISSION SHALL DEVELOP  A  FORMULA  TO  CALCULATE  UPTIME  TO
 PROVIDE  CONSISTENT,  STANDARDIZED REPORTING OF OVERALL CHARGING STATION
 UPTIME.  THE COMMISSION SHALL  DETERMINE  WHAT  EVENTS  THAT  RENDER  A
 STATION  INOPERABLE  CONSTITUTE EXCLUDED TIME FOR PURPOSES OF DEVELOPING

 PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SUBDIVISION  EVERY  TWO  YEARS. THE COMMISSION SHALL
 PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION OF THE REPORTING  PERSONS  AND
 ENTITIES,  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANONYMIZING AND AGGREGATING THE

 ASSESSMENTS AND REPORTS.
  5.  ON  OR BEFORE JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE, THE COMMIS-
