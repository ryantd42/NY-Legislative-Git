 MAINTAIN  ACTIONS IN  THE COURTS OF THIS STATE UPON ASSIGNED CLAIMS AND
 JUDGMENTS  FOR  WAGES  ARISING  IN  SUCH  OTHER STATE IN THE SAME MANNER

 AUTHORIZED  WHEN  ARISING  IN  THIS  STATE. HOWEVER, SUCH ACTIONS MAY BE
 MAINTAINED  ONLY  IN CASES WHERE  SUCH OTHER STATE BY LAW OR RECIPROCAL
 AGREEMENT EXTENDS A LIKE COMITY TO  CASES ARISING IN THIS STATE.
  (D) NOTHING IN  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  BE  CONSTRUED  AS  REQUIRING
