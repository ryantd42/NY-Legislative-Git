  COMMENDING  Augustine  Classical  Academy upon the
  occasion  of  winning  the  New  York  State  Bar
  Association Mock Trial Competition on May 21, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those young people who, by achieving outstanding  success
in  educational  competition,  have  inspired  and  brought pride to our
majestic Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Augustine Classical Academy upon the occasion of winning the New
York State Bar Association Mock Trial Competition on  Tuesday,  May  21,
2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  statewide program involves thousands of New York high
school students competing at the local, county, and regional levels; the
eight regional champions compete over two days in Albany each  May;  the
top  two  teams  face  off in the final match held at the James T. Foley
Federal Courthouse in Albany; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Augustine  Classical  Academy,  a  small  Saratoga  County
Christian  school,  bested  an impressive prosecution put on by Clarence
High School from Erie County to win the New York State  Bar  Association
Mock Trial Competition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  fictional  criminal case, "the People of the State of
Nivana v. Lindsay Gordon," involved a business owner  charged  with  3rd
degree  Arson  following  the  destruction of her business, Gordon Paint
Supplies; the mock criminal investigation revealed that  Gordon  was  in
debt and facing bankruptcy while also maintaining a $2 million insurance
policy on the business; and
 
  WHEREAS, The courtroom was filled to capacity with students, parents
and  advisers  watching  the  final  match  as  the  defense team used a
strategy focusing on tearing apart the arson investigation and attacking
the credibility of its investigator;  the  defense  also  focused  on  a
disgruntled  former  employee,  as  a  potential  suspect  in the crime;
Lindsay Gordon's attorney accused the investigator of confirmation  bias
and  having  tunnel  vision  in focusing on his client as a suspect; for
nearly three hours,  the  teams  examined  and  cross  examined  several
witnesses  including  Lindsay  Gordon  who  took  the  stand  in her own
defense; and
 
  WHEREAS, The student attorneys from both teams handled  examinations
and  objections  with  confidence  and  stamina  before Justice Eddie J.
McShan of the Appellate Division, Third  Department;  following  closing
arguments,  Justice  McShan  found  Lindsay  Gordon not guilty of arson,
handing the win to the Augustine Classical Academy team; and
 
  WHEREAS, Justice McShan gave high  praise  to  both  student  teams,
giving  due praise to the witnesses in the case for their commitment and
dedication to their part; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  In  a  show  of  team unity and celebration, the Augustine
Classical team, still gathered in the  courtroom,  sang  a  sacred  harp
hymn,  "Antioch,"  used  as  their  fight  song  this year; Coach Thomas
Trouwborst believes it speaks to the goals they set for  the  team  each
year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals of such impressive academic achievement are brought  to  our
attention,  they should be revered and celebrated by all the citizens of
this great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  the  members of the Augustine Classical Academy Mock Trial
Team: Hannah Trouwborst, Nora Catalano,  Carter  Van  Amburgh,  Isabelle
West,  Dominic  Marra,  Effie  MacKenzie,  Sophie  Van  Amburgh,  Caleb
Gascoyne, David Zhao, Ethan Gossman, Elliot Gorss, Ethan West, and Coach
Thomas Trouwborst upon their momentous win; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  aforementioned  members of the Augustine Classical
Academy Mock Trial Team and Coach Thomas Trouwborst.
