  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Brain Injury Awareness Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York  takes  great  pride  in calling
attention to serious medical conditions which affect  thousands  of  New
Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2023, as Brain Injury  Awareness
Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Brain Injury Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Social Brain Organization was  developed  and  launched  in
January  of  2019,  for  brain  injury  survivors and families to have a
community to come together; and
 
  WHEREAS, Social Brain Organization has relieved these survivors  and
their  families  of  this  burden  by creating a community to bring them
together; through  monthly  and  weekly  meetups,  both  in  person  and
virtually,  a  brain injury survivor can find a friend, listen to music,
participate with local college students, enjoy a picnic on a  nice  day,
and be with others who understand their similarities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  this  vital
organization created a  medical  supply  closet  to  provide  the  local
community with basic items of necessity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  educating, training, advocating, and supporting people
with brain injury, Social Brain Organization ensures that no  individual
has to face brain injury alone; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  New  York  State, more than 500 people sustain a brain
injury every day and it is estimated that brain injuries occur 50%  more
often and are not reported; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, an estimated 2,200 New York residents die from a
traumatic brain injury and another 19,000 are hospitalized; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A brain injury is an injury to the brain that occurs after
birth and is  not  congenital,  degenerative,  or  hereditary;  examples
include  stroke,  exposure  to  toxic  substances,  oxygen  deprivation,
infectious disease, trauma from motor vehicle  and  other  high-velocity
accidents and even concussions resulting from mild trauma; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  of the complexities about brain injury is that no two
brain injuries are alike; and
 
  WHEREAS, A brain injury may produce a diminished or altered state of
consciousness and can result in an impairment of cognitive abilities  or
physical  functioning;  it  can  also  result  in  the  disturbance  of
behavioral or emotional functioning; and
 
  WHEREAS, The impairments that result from traumatic brain injury can
be temporary or permanent and can  cause  partial  or  total  functional
disability or psychosocial maladjustment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Brain Injury Awareness Month is dedicated to educating the
public about brain injuries and de-stigmatizing brain injury, empowering
those who have survived brain injury and their caregivers, and promoting
the many types of support that are available to people living with brain
injuries; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is in the custom of this Legislative Body  to  recognize
the  achievements  made  and  to continue these efforts by promoting the
prevention and educating the public about the dangers of  brain  injury;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2023,  as  Brain
Injury Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and Social Brain Organization.
