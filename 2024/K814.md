such  as  New  York  City's  Grand  Central Terminal and Buffalo's Union

facilities and military bases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Union  Station  is  exquisite, featuring ornate stone

elegant marble floors and towering columns; in recent years, the Station

  WHEREAS, As a symbol of Utica's rich history and cultural  heritage,
the  Union  Station  remains  a beloved landmark in the city; its ornate
architecture and storied past serve as a reminder of the important  role
that  train  travel played in the development of American cities and the
enduring legacy of historic buildings; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  A vital part of its community, this remarkable institution
has continually strived to  provide  outstanding  service,  focusing  on
education,  recreation, and social inclusion, to a diverse population of
neighborhood residents; and
