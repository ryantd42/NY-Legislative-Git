 Introduced  by M. of A. TAGUE -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Governmental Operations
 
 AN ACT to amend the legislative law, in relation to creating a  legisla-
  tive child care facility; and making an appropriation therefor
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Legislative intent. The Legislature finds that there is a
 need to provide a licensed and regulated day care service to the members
 of the Senate and Assembly and the staff of the Senate and  Assembly  on
 site  at cost to be paid for by the members and staff of the legislature
 who use the child care service. With  members  and  staff  often  having
 irregular  working  hours it is found that providing child care services
 that are flexible to those non-traditional hours and at  a  location  on
 site  is  necessary for the child care needs of members and staff. It is
 the intent that offering  this  service  would  entice  recruitment  and
 retention  of  staff  and legislators as the public service sector has a
 workforce shortage. It is the hope that this  program  could  act  as  a
 guide  to  other  public  or private sector businesses to offer day care
 services to its employees as an additional benefit.
  § 2. The legislative law is amended by adding a  new  section  7-h  to
 read as follows:
  § 7-H. LEGISLATIVE CHILD CARE. THERE SHALL BE A LEGISLATIVE CHILD CARE
 FACILITY  FOR  USE BY MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE LEGISLATURE TO BE LOCATED
 IN A PART OF THE EMPIRE STATE PLAZA COMPLEX THAT HAS LEGISLATIVE OFFICES
 AND IN ROOMS ASSIGNED BY THE  COMMISSIONER  OF  THE  OFFICE  OF  GENERAL
 SERVICES,  CONVENIENTLY  ACCESSIBLE TO THE LEGISLATORS AND STAFF OF BOTH
 HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE, AND SUCH CHILD CARE FACILITY  SHALL  BE  OPEN
 THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
  SUCH  CHILD  CARE FACILITY SHALL BE CONTRACTED BY A PRIVATE CHILD CARE
 PROVIDER WHICH IS LICENSED SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTIONS THREE
 HUNDRED NINETY, THREE HUNDRED NINETY-A, AND THREE  HUNDRED  NINETY-B  OF
 THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW. SUCH CHILD CARE FACILITY SHALL BE OPEN AT HOURS
 SUBJECT  TO  THE  NEEDS  OF  THE  LEGISLATURE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 PROVISION. SUCH CHILD CARE PROVIDER SHALL BE  CHOSEN  BY  THE  TEMPORARY
 PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE AND SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY.
  THE  COST  OF  THE  CHILD CARE SERVICES SHALL BE SET BY THE CONTRACTED
 CHILD CARE PROVIDER.
  § 3. The sum of $100,000, or so much thereof as may be  necessary,  is
 hereby appropriated to support the design and construction of a legisla-
 tive  child  care facility as established by section 7-h of the legisla-
 tive law from any moneys in the state treasury not  otherwise  appropri-
 ated  and  made  immediately  available  to the New York state office of
 general services or to the dormitory authority of the state of New  York
 for  the  purpose  of  preparation  and review of plans, specifications,
 estimates, services, inspection studies,  appraisals,  surveys,  testing
 and  environmental  impact  statements  and  for  the cost of consultant
 design service.
  § 4. This act shall take effect April 1, 2024.
