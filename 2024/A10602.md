  CENSUS DATA: The number of members who will benefit in the future from

  - Number Count:  76  187
  - Average Age:  34.0  41.0

  * Members with less than 10 years of service
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER BENEFITS: Under the proposed legislation, an active
 member, or retiree (within five years  of  their  respective  retirement
 date)  of  NYCERS who is employed as a Fire Alarm Dispatcher and becomes
 disabled or dies due to heart disease would be eligible for  a  perform-
 ance of duty disability or death benefit.
  Currently,  an active member of NYCERS who is employed as a Fire Alarm
 Dispatcher and becomes disabled due to heart disease would  be  eligible
 for  an applicable ordinary disability retirement benefit, after attain-
 ing 10 years of credited service. Members with less  than  10  years  of
 service  may be eligible for a performance of duty disability benefit if
 current eligibility requirements are satisfied.
  The disability benefit is generally a lifetime payment  equal  to  the
 greatest  of  1/3  of Final Average Salary (FAS), 1/60th of FAS for each
 year of service, or the service retirement benefit, if eligible.
  The ordinary death benefit for Tier 4 and Tier  6  NYCERS  Fire  Alarm
 Dispatchers  is  generally  a  lump sum payment equal to three times the
 member's salary.  The performance of duty  death  benefit  is  generally
 equal to a lifetime benefit of 50% of a member's wages earned during the
 last year of service, payable to certain beneficiaries.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  The  number  of  members and eligible retirees who will benefit in the
 future from this fiscal note is  unknown.  The  cost  of  this  proposed
 legislation could vary greatly depending on the number of future members
 who benefit and on their length of service, age, and salary history.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
