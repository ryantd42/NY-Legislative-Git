 Introduced  by  Sen.  CANZONERI-FITZPATRICK  --  read  twice and ordered
  printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to improving  the  trans-
  portation of children with special needs
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 3635 of the education law is amended  by  adding  a
 new subdivision 9 to read as follows:
  9.  A. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, RULE OR REGULATION,
 WHERE A CHILD WITH SPECIAL NEEDS LEGALLY ATTENDS A SCHOOL DISTRICT, SUCH
 CHILD SHALL BE PROVIDED FREE TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN HOME AND SCHOOL.
  B. EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH A CHILD WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SHALL  HAVE  A
 CHILDREN  WITH SPECIAL NEEDS LIAISON WHO SHALL WORK WITH EACH CHILD WITH
 SPECIAL NEEDS AND THE CHILD'S FAMILY TO ENSURE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS  OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION ARE MET.
  C.  SUCH  TRANSPORTATION  SHALL  NOT  EXCEED  ONE  AND ONE-HALF HOURS,
 INCLUDING FLEXIBLE WAIT TIMES AT HOMES TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH CHILDREN WITH
 SPECIAL NEEDS POTENTIALLY REQUIRING MORE TIME  TO  GET  ON  AND  OFF  OF
 TRANSPORTATION.  IF  THE  TRANSPORTATION CANNOT BE COMPLETED WITHIN THIS
 TIMEFRAME, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL EITHER: (I) REDUCE THE  TRANSPORTA-
 TION  TIME  BY  ADDING  MORE TRANSPORTATION WITHIN THE DISTRICT; OR (II)
 REIMBURSE, IN FULL, THE CARETAKER OF THE CHILD FOR ANY AND ALL TRANSPOR-
 TATION EXPENSES FOR THE SAFE AND TIMELY TRANSPORTATION OF THE  CHILD  TO
 AND  FROM THE SCHOOL INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FUEL COSTS, MILEAGE,
 TOLLS, AND FARES.
  D. SUCH TRANSPORTATION USED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO TRANSPORT  CHIL-
 DREN  WITH  SPECIAL NEEDS SHALL INCLUDE CAMERAS AND BUS TRACKING SYSTEMS
 SO THE CHILD AND THE CHILD'S FAMILY CAN KNOW WHEN THE BUS WILL ARRIVE AT
 THE HOME.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
