 Introduced  by Sen. STAVISKY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing an exper-
  iential learning degree requirement in the  state  university  of  New
  York and the city university of New York

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative  findings  and  intent.  Experiential  learning
 encompasses  service-learning  activities,  paid  or unpaid internships,
 research projects, and other programs that  allow  students  to  develop
 work  experience  and practical skills necessary for life after college.
 Students who participate in internships, for example, are 15% less like-
 ly to be unemployed in the first years after graduation and earn 6% more
 than students who did not participate in internships. Despite the proven
 benefits of experiential learning, not all students have access to these
 programs, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds are the most like-
 ly to miss out.  This  legislation  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  all
 students  at the state university of New York and the city university of
 New York are able to participate  in  experiential  learning,  enhancing
 their education and preparing them for careers after college.
  §  2.  Subdivision 2 of section 355 of the education law is amended by
 adding a new paragraph f-3 to read as follows:
  F-3. (1) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO THE  CONTRARY,
 THE  STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK BOARD OF TRUSTEES SHALL DEVELOP A PLAN
 FOR REQUIRING THAT ALL STUDENTS COMPLETE  AN  APPROVED  EXPERIENTIAL  OR
 APPLIED  LEARNING ACTIVITY, AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH F-1 OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION, AS A REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DEGREE PROGRAMS.
  (2) SUCH PLAN SHALL:
  (I) DEFINE APPROVED EXPERIENTIAL OR APPLIED LEARNING ACTIVITIES;
  (II) DEFINE METHODS OF FACULTY OVERSIGHT AND ASSESSMENT;
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 INCLUDE A  WAIVER  PROCESS  THROUGH  WHICH  A  STUDENT  CAN  REQUEST  AN
 EXEMPTION  FROM  THE  EXPERIENTIAL  LEARNING  DEGREE  REQUIREMENT DUE TO
 DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL HARDSHIP OR EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES.
  (4) WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS PARAGRAPH, THE BOARD
