  WHEREAS,  The  Ed.  Foundation  is  an  independent,  nonprofit,

educational opportunities for all students in the Port Washington  Union

educational  opportunities  for  Port  Washington  students;  through
school-based  fundraisers,  each  organization strives to bring exciting
educational opportunities in the form of equipment  and  programming  to
their student bodies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Special  Education Parent Teacher Association (SEPTA)
exists to address the needs of children in special  education  programs,
both  in  and out of the school district; its goals are to keep parents,
teachers, and other related personnel informed of issues and changes  in
programs, and to promote better awareness of Special Education; and

  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
work  diligently  to  enhance  the  well-being  and  vitality  of  their
community  and  have shown a long and sustained commitment to excellence
certainly have earned the recognition and applause of all  the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
