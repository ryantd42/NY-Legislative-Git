  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2024, as Deep Vein  Thrombosis  and  Pulmonary
  Embolism Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2024, as  Deep  Vein
Thrombosis  and  Pulmonary  Embolism Awareness Month in the State of New
York,  in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National  Deep  Vein
Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Blood clots are a major health threat in New York State and
around the country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States Congress has designated March as Blood
Clot Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the National Blood Clot Alliance, every minute
someone is diagnosed with a blood clot; and every six  minutes  a  blood
clot kills someone; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Blood  clots do not discriminate by age, gender, ethnicity
or race; they  affect  everyone,  infants,  young  children,  teenagers,
people  in  middle  age and senior citizens; across New York State, they
affect people from all walks of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Blood clots are the number one killer  of  new  mothers  in
childbirth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Blood  clots  affect  people  being treated for cancer and
other chronic diseases, and people undergoing joint replacement  surgery
and other surgical procedures; and
 
  WHEREAS, Blood clots can be triggered by a genetic predisposition or
by  lengthy  immobility;  they  can  affect  the  more than five million
Americans with heartbeat problems, which places them at heightened  risk
of a clot in the heart that can travel to the brain and cause stroke and
death; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Blood  clots are the leading cause of unnecessary hospital
readmissions at an estimated cost of more than $10 billion  of  the  $16
billion  expended  in  the treatment of blood clots at hospitals nation-
wide; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many of the risks for life-threatening blood clots increase
as people age and so too will the public health challenge; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fortunately, many blood clots can  be  prevented  but  when
they  do  occur,  poor outcomes including death, disease and recurrence,
can be preventable with early and accurate diagnosis and management; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 2024, as  Deep  Vein
Thrombosis  and  Pulmonary  Embolism Awareness Month in the State of New
York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
