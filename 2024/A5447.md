  (B) THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ANY ACT ESTABLISHING A MANDATE SHALL PROVIDE
 A  REASONABLE TIME FOR THE STATE AND ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PLAN IMPLE-
 MENTATION THEREOF AND SHALL  BE  CONSISTENT  WITH  THE  AVAILABILITY  OF

  § 2. Section 51 of the legislative law, as added by chapter 985 of the
 laws of 1983, is amended to read as follows:
  § 51. Fiscal [impact] notes on bills affecting political subdivisions.

 means any county,  city,  town,  village,  special  district  or  school
 district.
  2.  [The  legislature shall by concurrent resolution of the senate and
 assembly prescribe rules requiring fiscal notes to accompany, on a sepa-
 A. 5447  3

 rate form, bills and amendments to bills, except as otherwise prescribed
 by such rules, which] A BILL THAT would substantially affect the  reven-
 ues  or  expenses, or both, of any political subdivision SHALL CONTAIN A
 FISCAL  NOTE STATING THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL COST TO THE POLITICAL SUBDIVI-
 SION AFFECTED AND THE SOURCE OF SUCH ESTIMATE.
  3. Fiscal notes shall not, however, be required for bills: (a) subject
 to the provisions of section fifty of this  [chapter]  ARTICLE,  or  (b)

 visions, or (c)  which  provide  discretionary  authority  to  political
 subdivisions,  or  (d)  submitted pursuant to section twenty-four of the

 rate, such inaccuracies shall not  affect,  impair  or  invalidate  such
 bill.
  §  3.  This act shall take effect immediately, provided, however, that
 section one of this act shall only apply  to  laws  enacted  after  such
 effective date.
