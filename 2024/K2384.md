  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  December 3, 2024, as International  Day  of  Persons
  with Disabilities in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of  New  York  State  and  across  the
Nation and World; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Tuesday, December 3, 2024,
as  International  Day  of Persons with Disabilities in the State of New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The International Day  of  Persons  with  Disabilities  was
proclaimed  in  1992,  by  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly;  the
observance of the day aspires to promote an understanding of  disability
issues  and  mobilize  support for the dignity, rights and well-being of
persons with disabilities and to seek to  increase  awareness  of  gains
derived  from  the  integration  of  persons  with disabilities in every
aspect of political, social, economic and cultural life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, International Day of Persons with Disabilities
is a day to help everyone become more compassionate and understanding of
the challenges faced by people  with  disabilities;  the  day  does  not
discriminate between mental and physical disabilities, and the spirit of
the  day  is to ensure that all people in New York State, the Nation, as
well as the World have equal opportunities for work, play,  health,  and
success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  global  crisis  of  COVID-19  deepened  pre-existing
inequalities, exposed the extent of exclusion and highlighted that  work
on  disability inclusion is imperative; approximately one billion people
with disabilities are among the most excluded groups in our society  and
were among the hardest hit in this crisis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Even under normal circumstances, persons with disabilities
are less likely to access health  care,  education,  employment  and  to
participate  in  the  community;  an  integrated approach is required to
ensure that persons with disabilities are not left behind; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the world recovers from the pandemic, it  is  imperative
that  we  must  ensure  that  the aspirations and rights of persons with
disabilities are included and accounted for in an inclusive,  accessible
and  sustainable  post COVID-19 world; this vision will only be achieved
through active consultation with persons  with  disabilities  and  their
representative organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals and organizations which bring greater awareness
to  physical health issues, and assist people in their quest to overcome
these obstacles, are a great benefit to the health and  welfare  of  all
citizens; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  December  3,  2024,  as
International Day of Persons with Disabilities in the State of New York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
