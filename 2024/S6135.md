 amended to read as follows:

 issuing  policies that are subject to article fifty-one of this chapter,
 including policies of motor vehicle personal injury liability  insurance
 or  policies  of  motor  vehicle  property damage liability insurance or
 insurance for loss or damage to a motor vehicle, shall establish a fair,
 practicable, and nondiscriminatory plan for refunding or otherwise cred-
 iting to those purchasing such policies their  share  of  the  insurer's
 excess  profit,  if  any,  on such policies. An excess profit shall be a
 profit beyond a percentage rate of return on net worth  attributable  to
 such  policies,  computed  in accordance with the regulation required by
 section two thousand three hundred twenty-three  of  this  article,  and
 determined by the superintendent to be so far above a reasonable average
 profit  as  to amount to an excess profit, taking into consideration the
 fact that losses or profits below a reasonable average profit  will  not
 be  recouped  from  such  policyholders. Each plan shall apply to policy
 periods for the periods January  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-four
 through  August  second, two thousand one, and the effective date of the
 property/casualty insurance availability act through June thirtieth, two
 thousand twenty-three. In prescribing such regulations  the  superinten-

 refund or credit that he or she determines to be de minimis or impracti-
 cable, adopt forms of returns that shall be made to him or her in  order
 to  establish  the amount of any refund or credit due, establish periods
 and times for the determination and distribution of refunds and credits,

 refunds  or credits required by any such plan for policyholder dividends
 and for return premiums that may be due under rate credit or  retrospec-
 tive rating plans based on experience.

 OF  THE  POINTS  FOR REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN AND EXCESS PROFITS ESTAB-
 LISHED UNDER THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, USING

 RECALCULATION,  EXCESS  PROFITS  HAVE  BEEN  REALIZED, SHALL IMMEDIATELY
