  during pregnancy and parental leave for railroad employees

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares that pregnant employees and new parents in the railroad  indus-
 try  face  unique  challenges  that necessitate specific protections and
 accommodations. The intent of this legislation is to ensure  that  preg-
 nant  employees  are  provided  with  suitable light duty assignments to
 safeguard their health and well-being, and to  establish  paid  parental
 leave  benefits to support employees bonding with their newborn or newly
 adopted children. These measures aim to promote  a  safe  and  inclusive
 work environment while balancing the operational needs of employers.
  §  2.  The  labor  law is amended by adding two new sections 167-a and
 167-b to read as follows:
  § 167-A. LIGHT DUTY FOR PREGNANT RAILROAD  EMPLOYEES.  1.  SHOULD  ANY
 EMPLOYEE  ENGAGED IN THE SERVICE OF ANY RAILROAD, INCLUDING ANY COMMUTER
 RAIL SERVICE, AS DEFINED BY SECTION NINETY-SEVEN-A OF THE RAILROAD  LAW,
 OWNED  OR OPERATED BY A STATE AUTHORITY OR ITS SUBSIDIARY, AS DEFINED BY
 SECTION TWO OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES LAW, WHO IS PREGNANT BE  PREVENTED
 BY SUCH PREGNANCY FROM PERFORMING THE ACTIVITIES INVOLVED IN THE EMPLOY-
 EE'S  REGULAR  ASSIGNED  DUTIES  DUE,  BUT IS ABLE, AS DETERMINED BY THE
 EMPLOYEE'S MEDICAL PROVIDER, TO PERFORM SPECIFIED TYPES OF  LIGHT  DUTY,
 THE  EMPLOYER  SHALL  MAKE  AVAILABLE  SUCH  LIGHT DUTY TO THE EMPLOYEE,
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH LIGHT DUTY SHALL  ENABLE  THE  EMPLOYEE  TO
 CONTINUE  TO  BE  ENTITLED TO THE EMPLOYEE'S CONCURRENT ASSIGNMENT EARN-
 INGS, INCLUDING INCREASES THEREOF AND  FRINGE  BENEFITS,  TO  WHICH  THE
 EMPLOYEE  WOULD  HAVE BEEN ENTITLED IF THE EMPLOYEE WERE ABLE TO PERFORM
 THE EMPLOYEE'S REGULAR ASSIGNED DUTIES.
