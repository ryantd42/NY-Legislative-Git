 Introduced  by  Sen. SANDERS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to establish a Green New  Deal  for  New  York  task  force;  and
  providing for the repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. 1. The legislature  recog-
 nizes  the  duty  of the New York state government to create a Green New
 Deal for New York. An October 2018 report entitled  "Special  Report  on
 Global  Warming  of  1.5°C"  by  the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
 Change and the November 2018 Fourth National Climate  Assessment  report
 found that:
  (a)  human  activity  is the dominant cause of observed climate change
 over the past century;
  (b) a changing climate is causing sea levels to rise and  an  increase
 in  wildfires, severe storms, droughts, and other extreme weather events
 that threaten human life, healthy communities, and critical  infrastruc-
 ture;
  (c) global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius beyond preindustrial-
 ized levels will cause:
  (i) mass migration from the regions most affected by climate change;
  (ii)  more than $500,000,000,000 in lost annual economic output in the
 United States by the year 2100;
  (iii) wildfires that, by 2050, will annually burn at  least  twice  as
 much  forest area in the western United States than was typically burned
 by wildfires in the years preceding 2019;
  (iv) a loss of more than 99 percent of all coral reefs on earth;
  (v) more than 350,000,000 more people to be exposed globally to deadly
 heat stress by 2050; and
  (vi) a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of  public  infrastructure
 and coastal real estate in the United States; and

  (d)  global  temperatures must be kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius above
 preindustrialized levels to avoid the most severe impacts of a  changing
 climate, which will require:
  (i)  global  reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from human sources
 of 40 to 60 percent from 2010 levels by 2030; and
  (ii) net-zero global emissions by 2050.
  2. As the United States, including New  York,  has  historically  been
 responsible  for  a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions,
 having emitted 20 percent of global  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through
 2014,  and  has a high technological capacity, the United States and New
 York must take a leading role in  reducing  emissions  through  economic
 transformation.
  3. The United States is currently experiencing several related crises,
 with:
  (a)  life  expectancy  declining while basic needs, such as clean air,
 clean water, healthy food, and adequate health care, housing,  transpor-
 tation,  and education, are inaccessible to a significant portion of the
 United States population;
  (b) a 4-decade trend  of  wage  stagnation,  deindustrialization,  and
 antilabor policies that has led to:
  (i) hourly wages overall stagnating since the 1970's despite increased
 worker productivity;
  (ii)  the third-worst level of socioeconomic mobility in the developed
 world before the Great Recession;
  (iii) the erosion of the earning and bargaining power  of  workers  in
 the United States; and
  (iv)  inadequate  resources  for public sector workers to confront the
 challenges of climate change at local, state, and federal levels; and
  (c) the greatest income inequality since the 1920's, with:
  (i) the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 percent of gains  in  the
 first few years of economic recovery after the Great Recession;
  (ii)  a  large  racial  wealth  divide amounting to a difference of 20
 times more wealth between the average white family and the average black
 family; and
  (iii) a gender earnings gap that results in women earning approximate-
 ly 80 percent as much as men, at the median.
  4. Climate  change,  pollution,  and  environmental  destruction  have
 exacerbated  systemic  racial,  regional,  social,  environmental,  and
 economic injustices (hereinafter referred to as  "systemic  injustices")
 by  disproportionately  affecting  indigenous  peoples,  communities  of
 color, migrant communities,  deindustrialized  communities,  depopulated
 rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the
 unhoused,  people  with disabilities, and youth (hereinafter referred to
 as "frontline and vulnerable communities").
  5. Climate change constitutes a direct threat to the national security
 of the United States:
  (a) by impacting the economic, environmental, and social stability  of
 countries and communities around the world; and
  (b) by acting as a threat multiplier.
  6.  The  federal  government-led mobilizations during World War II and
 the New Deal created the greatest middle class that  the  United  States
 has  ever seen, but many members of frontline and vulnerable communities
 were excluded from many of the economic and societal benefits  of  those
 mobilizations.
 S. 5788  3
 
  7.  The  New  York  state  government  recognizes that a new national,
 social, industrial, and economic mobilization on a scale not seen  since
 World War II and the New Deal era is a historic opportunity:
  (a) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in New York state;
  (b) to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic securi-
 ty for all people of New York state; and
  (c) to counteract systemic injustices.
  8. Now, therefore, be it resolved that it is the sense of the New York
 state legislature that:
  (a)  it is the duty of the New York state government to create a Green
 New Deal:
  (i) to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through  a  fair  and
 just transition for all communities and workers;
  (ii)  to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity
 and economic security for all people of New York state;
  (iii) to invest in the infrastructure and industry of New  York  state

  (v) to promote justice and  equity  by  stopping  current,  preventing
 future,  and  repairing  historic oppression of frontline and vulnerable
 communities;
  (b) the goals described in clauses (A)  through  (E)  of  subparagraph
 (iv)  of  paragraph  (a) of this subdivision (hereinafter referred to as

 S. 5788  8
 
  (vii)  making  "green"  technology,  industry, expertise, products and
 services a major export of New York state, with the aim of becoming  the
 undisputed  international  leader  in helping other states and countries
 transition to completely greenhouse gas neutral economies  and  bringing
 about a global Green New Deal; and
  (viii) explain how these actions will be financed and what the econom-
 ic  impact  will be if we take these actions and if we do not take these
 actions.
  (b) The plan for a Green New Deal  and  the  draft  legislation  shall
 recognize  that a state, industrial, economic mobilization of this scope
 and scale is a historic opportunity to virtually  eliminate  poverty  in
 New  York  state  and  to  make prosperity, wealth and economic security
 available to everyone participating in the transformation.  In  further-
 ance of the foregoing, the plan and the draft legislation shall:
  (i)  provide  all  members  of our society, across all regions and all
 communities, the opportunity, training and education to be  a  full  and
 equal  participant  in the transition, including through a job guarantee
 program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one;
  (ii) diversify local and regional economies, with a  particular  focus
 on  communities where the fossil fuel industry holds significant control
 over the labor market, to  ensure  workers  have  the  necessary  tools,
 opportunities,  and  economic  assistance  to  succeed during the energy
 transition;
  (iii) require strong enforcement of labor, workplace safety, and  wage
 standards  that recognize the rights of workers to organize and unionize
 free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment, and creation of meaning-
 ful, quality, career employment;
  (iv) ensure a 'just transition' for all workers,  low-income  communi-
 ties,  communities  of  color,  indigenous  communities, rural and urban
 communities and the front-line  communities  most  affected  by  climate
 change,  pollution  and  other  environmental harm including by ensuring
 that local implementation of the transition is led  from  the  community
 level  and  by prioritizing solutions that end the harms faced by front-
 line communities from climate change and environmental pollution;
  (v) protect and enforce sovereign rights and  land  rights  of  tribal
 nations;
  (vi)  mitigate  deeply  entrenched  racial,  regional and gender-based
 inequalities in income and wealth including, but not limited to,  ensur-
 ing  that  state  and  other investment will be equitably distributed to
 historically impoverished, low income, deindustrialized or other  margi-
 nalized  communities  in  such a way that builds wealth and ownership at
 the community level;
  (vii) include additional  measures  such  as  basic  income  programs,
 universal health care programs and any others as the task force may deem
 appropriate  to  promote economic security, labor market flexibility and
 entrepreneurism;
  (viii) deeply involve state and local labor unions to take  a  leader-
 ship role in the process of job training and worker deployment; and
  (ix)  explain how these actions will be financed and what the economic
 impact will be if these actions are taken and if these actions  are  not
 taken.
  (c)  The  plan  for  a  Green New Deal and the draft legislation shall
 recognize that innovative public and other financing  structures  are  a
 crucial  component  in achieving and furthering the goals and guidelines
 relating to social, economic, racial, regional and gender-based  justice
 and  equality  and  cooperative  and  public ownership. The plan and the
 S. 5788  9
 
 draft legislation  shall,  accordingly,  ensure  that  the  majority  of
 financing  of  the  plan  shall be accomplished by the state government,
 using a combination of a new public bank or a  system  of  regional  and
 specialized  public  banks, public venture funds and such other vehicles
 or structures that the task force deems appropriate, in order to  ensure
 that interest and other investment returns generated from public invest-
 ments  made  in  connection with the plan will be returned to the state,
 reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed April 1, 2024.
