  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 19, 2024, as Day of Nowruz in the State of New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that are set aside to increase awareness and enhance the
profile of cultural  diversity  which  strengthens  the  fabric  of  the
communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 19, 2024, as Day of
Nowruz in the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of
International Day of Nowruz; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Persian  New  Year, Nowruz, meaning "New Day," begins
each year on the first day  of  spring  marked  by  vernal  equinox,  or
Tahvil;  on  this day, which may occur on March 19th, 20th, or 21st, the
sun crosses the celestial equator; and
 
  WHEREAS, Of all Persian holidays, the New Year  celebration  is  the
most  important,  embodying  a  wealth of ancient rites and customs, and
symbolizing the continuity of the  ancient  Persian  culture  which  has
survived many adversities; and
 
  WHEREAS, As far back as records go, Nowruz has been a celebration of
early  spring,  when  the  sun  begins  to  regain strength and overcome
winter's cold and darkness, and when there is a renewal  of  growth  and
vigor in nature; and
 
  WHEREAS, A few days prior to the New Year, a special cover is spread
onto  the  carpet  or  table  in  every  household that celebrates; this
ceremonial table is called cloth of seven  dishes,  each  one  beginning
with  the Persian letter Sin; the number seven has been sacred in Persia
since the ancient times, and  the  seven  dishes  stand  for  the  seven
angelic  heralds  of  life; rebirth, health, happiness, prosperity, joy,
patience, and beauty; and
 
  WHEREAS, The actual Nowruz ceremonies begin on the eve of  the  last
Wednesday  of  the  outgoing year and is known as Chaharshanbe Souri, or
Red Wednesday; early in the evening several large bonfires are made  and
each member of the family jumps over the fire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  jumping  over the fire is followed by a
gathering in which nuts and fruits are  served  and  stories  are  told;
while  the  party goes and the fire dies out, the ashes, a symbol of the
bad luck imposed by winter, are buried; and
 
  WHEREAS, The traditional herald  of  Nowruz,  Haji  Firuz,  oversees
celebrations  for  the  New Year as a remnant of the ancient Zoroastrian
fire-keeper; his face is covered in soot and he is clad  in  bright  red
clothes and a felt hat; and
 
  WHEREAS, While ushering in Nowruz, Haji Firuz plays a tambourine and
sings as people gather around him and his troupe of musicians, spreading
good cheer and the news of the coming New Year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  13th day of Nowruz is called Sizdah Bedar, celebrated
by spending all day outdoors in nature having picnics and parties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Day of Nowruz is a time to celebrate  the  aspirations  and
values  that  have  been shared with the Persian people for generations,
and to recognize  the  countless  contributions  of  Americans  and  New
Yorkers  of  Persian descent to every aspect of society; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 19, 2024, as Day of
Nowruz in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
