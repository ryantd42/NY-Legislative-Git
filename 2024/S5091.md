 ARTICLE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE,  ONE  HUNDRED  THIRTY  OR  TWO  HUNDRED
 SIXTY-THREE  OF THE PENAL LAW; OR MONEY LAUNDERING IN SUPPORT OF TERROR-

 ITY  FOR THE OFFENSE WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE PHYSICAL ACTIONS OR CONDUCT
 OF ANOTHER PURSUANT TO SECTION 20.00 OF THE PENAL LAW; OR
  (VII) IF DEFENDANT HAS APPEALED FROM A JUDGMENT OR  SENTENCE  THAT  IS
 THE  SUBJECT  OF  RELIEF  PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, SUCH APPEAL HAS BEEN
 FINALLY DETERMINED. NOTHING IN THIS SUBPARAGRAPH SHALL BE  CONSTRUED  TO
 REQUIRE  THAT  THE  DEFENDANT  HAS  TAKEN A DIRECT APPEAL IN ORDER TO BE
 ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.

 SION,  AN  OTHERWISE INELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL SHALL BE DEEMED ELIGIBLE UPON
 CONSENT OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

 THE PENAL LAW SHALL NOT BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (E)  A  MOTION  BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE REFERRED
 FOR DETERMINATION TO THE JUDGE  OR  JUSTICE  WHO  IMPOSED  THE  ORIGINAL
 SENTENCE  UPON  SUCH INDIVIDUAL. IF, AT THE TIME OF THE APPLICATION, THE
 ORIGINAL SENTENCING JUDGE OR JUSTICE IS NO LONGER A JUDGE OR JUSTICE  OF
 A  COURT  OF  COMPETENT  JURISDICTION,  THEN  THE  APPLICATION  SHALL BE
 ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER JUDGE OR JUSTICE OF THE COURT BY THE  ADMINISTRATIVE
 JUDGE OF THE APPLICABLE COURT.
  (F) IN DECIDING THE MOTION, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER THE PRINCIPLES OF
 REHABILITATION,  PUNISHMENT  AND  DETERRENCE,  THE REHABILITATION DEMON-
 STRATED BY THE DEFENDANT, AND THE PROMOTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S SUCCESS-
 FUL REENTRY AND REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY, AS WELL  AS  PUBLIC  SAFETY.
 THE  COURT MAY CONSIDER ANY FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES RELEVANT TO THE IMPO-
 SITION OF A NEW SENTENCE THAT ARE SUBMITTED BY SUCH  INDIVIDUAL  OR  THE
 DISTRICT ATTORNEY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
  (I)  AGE,  PERSONAL  CIRCUMSTANCES,  AND  MEDICAL CONDITION, INCLUDING
 CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE ORIGINAL SENTENCING;
  (II) THE DEFENDANT'S INSTITUTIONAL RECORD OF CONFINEMENT; AND
  (III) WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL HAS AVAILED HIMSELF OR HERSELF OF  EDUCA-
 TIONAL, THERAPEUTIC, AND VOCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WHILE IMPRISONED.
  (G)  THE  COURT  SHALL  NOT ORDER A NEW PRE-SENTENCE INVESTIGATION AND
 REPORT. THE COURT SHALL OFFER THE DEFENDANT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR  A  HEAR-
 ING.  IF  THE COURT FINDS THAT THE SENTENCE IS GREATER THAN NECESSARY TO
 ACHIEVE THE PURPOSES OF SENTENCING, THE COURT SHALL GRANT THE MOTION AND
 ENTER AN ORDER MODIFYING THE SENTENCE TO ANY LESSER AUTHORIZED  TERM  OF
 IMPRISONMENT.  THE  ORDER  MAY  ALSO  DIRECT  THAT  THE NEW SENTENCE RUN
 CONCURRENTLY WITH ANY OTHER TERM OF IMPRISONMENT  BEING  SERVED  BY  THE
 INDIVIDUAL.  THE COURT SHALL PLACE ITS REASONS ON THE RECORD FOR MODIFI-
 CATION OF THE SENTENCE, OR DENIAL OF MODIFICATION.
  (H) IN THE EVENT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IS DENIED RELIEF UNDER THIS SUBDI-
 VISION, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS DENIED THE FULL REDUCTION
 SOUGHT, HE OR SHE MAY BRING A NEW MOTION AT ANY TIME AFTER  THREE  YEARS
 FROM THE DATE OF DENIAL OF THE PREVIOUS MOTION.
