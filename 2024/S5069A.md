  Section 1. Subparagraph 1 of paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section

 chapter 39 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (1)  There is hereby created the "metropolitan transportation authori-

 public benefit corporation. The authority shall consist of a  [chairman]
 CHAIRPERSON,  sixteen  other voting members, and two non-voting and four
 alternate non-voting members, as described in subparagraph two  of  this
 paragraph  appointed  by the governor by and with the advice and consent
 of the senate. Any member appointed to a term  commencing  on  or  after

 of the following areas: transportation, public administration,  business
 management,  finance,  accounting, law, engineering, land use, urban and
 regional  planning,  management  of  large  capital  projects,  labor
 relations,  or have experience in some other area of activity central to
 the mission of the authority.  Four of the sixteen voting members  other
 than the [chairman] CHAIRPERSON shall be appointed on the written recom-
 mendation  of the mayor of the city of New York; and each of seven other
 voting members other than the [chairman] CHAIRPERSON shall be  appointed
 after  selection  from  a written list of three recommendations from the
 chief executive officer of the county in which the particular member  is

 the members appointed on recommendation of the chief  executive  officer
 of  a  county,  one  such member shall be, at the time of appointment, a
 resident of the county of Nassau,  one  a  resident  of  the  county  of
 Suffolk,  one a resident of the county of Westchester, one a resident of
 the county of Dutchess, one a resident of the county of  Orange,  one  a
 resident  of  the  county  of Putnam and one a resident of the county of
 Rockland, provided that the term of any member who is a  resident  of  a
 county  that has withdrawn from the metropolitan commuter transportation
 district pursuant to section twelve hundred seventy-nine-b of this title
 shall terminate upon the effective date of such county's withdrawal from
 such district. Of the five voting members,  other  than  the  [chairman]
 CHAIRPERSON,  appointed  by the governor without recommendation from any
 other person, three shall be, at the time of appointment,  residents  of
 the city of New York and two shall be, at the time of appointment, resi-
 dents  of  such  city  or  of  any of the aforementioned counties in the
 metropolitan  commuter  transportation  district.  Provided  however,
 notwithstanding  the  foregoing  residency  requirement, one of the five
 voting members appointed by the governor without recommendation from any
 other person, other than the [chairman] CHAIRPERSON, may be the director
 of the New York state division of the budget, and provided further that,
 in the event of such appointment, the budget  director's  membership  in
 the  authority shall be deemed ex-officio.  PROVIDED FURTHER, ONE OF THE
 FIVE VOTING MEMBERS, OTHER THAN THE CHAIRPERSON, APPOINTED BY THE GOVER-
 NOR WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION BY  ANY  OTHER  PERSON  SHALL  BE  A  TRANSIT
 DEPENDENT  INDIVIDUAL.  A  "TRANSIT  DEPENDENT INDIVIDUAL" SHALL MEAN AN
 INDIVIDUAL WHO IS LIMITED TO PUBLIC TRANSIT AS  THEIR  PRIMARY  MODE  OF
 TRANSPORTATION  BECAUSE  THE  INDIVIDUAL  HAS  A  PERMANENT  DISABILITY,
 PROVIDED THAT ANY LOCAL OR STATEWIDE TRANSIT ADVOCACY  ORGANIZATION  MAY
 RECOMMEND ONE OR MORE TRANSIT DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR
 APPOINTMENT  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION. The [chairman] CHAIRPERSON and
 each of the members shall be appointed for a term of six years, provided
 however, that the [chairman] CHAIRPERSON first appointed shall serve for
 a term ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-one, provided that
 thirty days after the effective date of the chapter of the laws  of  two
 thousand  nine  which amended this subparagraph, the term of the [chair-
 man] CHAIRPERSON shall expire; provided, further, that  such  [chairman]
 CHAIRPERSON  may  continue  to discharge the duties of his or her office
 until the position of [chairman] CHAIRPERSON is filled by appointment by
 the governor upon the advice and consent of the senate and the  term  of
 such  new  [chairman]  CHAIRPERSON  shall  terminate June thirtieth, two
 thousand fifteen. The sixteen other members first appointed shall  serve
 for  the  following  terms:  The members from the counties of Nassau and
 Westchester shall each serve for a term ending June thirtieth,  nineteen
 hundred eighty-five; the members from the county of Suffolk and from the
 counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam and Rockland shall each serve for a
 term  ending  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred ninety-two; two of the
 members appointed on recommendation of the mayor of the city of New York
 shall each serve for a term  ending  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred
 eighty-four  and, two shall each serve for a term ending June thirtieth,

 nor  without the recommendation of any other person shall each serve for
 a term ending June thirtieth, nineteen  hundred  eighty-two,  two  shall
 each serve for a term ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty and

 eighty-five. The two non-voting and four  alternate  non-voting  members
 shall  serve until January first, two thousand one. The members from the

 tive vote.
  §  2.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 the amendments to subparagraph 1 of paragraph (a) of  subdivision  1  of
 section  1263  of the public authorities law made by section one of this
 act shall not affect the expiration  of  such  paragraph  and  shall  be
 deemed expired therewith.
