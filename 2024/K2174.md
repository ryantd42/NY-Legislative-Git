  COMMEMORATING the two-year Anniversary of the mass
  shooting  at  Tops  Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New
  York, on May 14, 2024,  and  honoring  the  victims,
  survivors,  families, and community at large in wake
  of this devastating tragedy
 
  WHEREAS, The very principles of American freedom, and the safety and
security of every American at home and abroad  were  challenged  by  the
unspeakable  atrocities  committed in the East Side of Buffalo, during a
sunny afternoon on Saturday, May 14,  2022,  at  a  Tops  grocery  store
located on historic Jefferson Ave; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  we  mark  the  two-year  anniversary of this senseless
massacre, Buffalo is conducting an array of events to  honor  those  who
lost  their  lives  and to uplift the community, including the 5/14 Blue
Flag  Initiative  in  honor  of  the  lives  taken  during  the  5/14
racially-motivated  mass  shooting  at  Tops  on  Jefferson Avenue; this
initiative is sponsored by Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center  and
is  a  collaboration  between  the  Mayor's  Office, the City of Buffalo
Common Council, Buffalo Public Schools, and local artists Brandon Watson
and Brendan Bannon; the  initiative  calls  for  the  creation  of  blue
cyanotype-design  flags  that  will  be  hung along the Jefferson Avenue
corridor, and members of the  public  were  invited  to  attend  one  of
several  cyanotype flag-making workshops at various locations throughout
the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Other events in honor of the anniversary of  this  profound
tragedy  include  the  Tragedy  and Triumph 5K, sponsored by Legacy 5.14
Inc.,  benefitting  the  5/14  Memorial  Scholarship  which  awards
scholarships  to 10 college-bound seniors from Buffalo high schools, and
on May 14, 2024, the community will gather for a remembrance ceremony at
the Tops supermarket; additionally, church  bells  will  chime  at  2:28
p.m., the moment the 123-second rampage began; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, as we remember this horrific day, we honor the
10  innocent people who were killed: Roberta A. Drury, Geraldine Talley,
Celestine Chaney, Katherine Massey, Pearl Young, Ruth Whitfield,  Margus
D.  Morrison,  Andre  Mackneil,  retired Buffalo Police Lieutenant Aaron
Salter, and Heyward Patterson; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, we honor the survivors:  Jennifer  Warrington,
Zaire Goodman, and Christopher Braden; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  May  14th  Memorial  Commission  was  established  by
Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Byron Brown  to  combat  racism  in  all
forms  and work towards a future where hatred and bigotry are a thing of
the past; the Commission, led by Buffalo NAACP President  Reverend  Mark
Blue,  will have a leading role in uplifting the East Buffalo community;
and
 
  WHEREAS, For all New Yorkers, the images of this  horrific  domestic
act of terrorism rekindles heartbreaking memories and causes us to pause
and reflect on our daily lives; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The very heart and soul of America was once more shaken to
its core and this tragedy stands as a reminder that such senseless  acts
of  violence  will  not destroy the honorable values that America stands
for; and
 
  WHEREAS, The power of human compassion and the strength  and  spirit
of  the  American  people  were revealed in Buffalo as we learned of the
immediate and heroic outpouring of service and concern for  the  victims
of this act of terrorism and in its aftermath; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted  first  responders,  including  police  officers,  Erie
County  sheriff's  deputies,  and  FBI agents, as well as paramedics and
firefighters, who inspire us all by carrying out their sworn duties with
great courage and bravery; and
 
  WHEREAS, The combined and coordinated efforts of  these  individuals
and  their  swift  response  are  a testament to the spirit of unity and
fellowship in the face of adversity  which  characterizes  the  best  of
America; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  people  of  the  State of New York stand steadfast in
their solidarity with Buffalo, New  York,  honoring  all  of  whom  were
victimized  by the city's worst mass shooting on Saturday, May 14, 2022,
and standing resolute in our  obligation  to  condemn  racism,  domestic
terrorism, and all forms of hatred; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the two-year  Anniversary  of  the  mass  shooting  at  Tops
Friendly  Supermarkets,  and  to  extend  to  the  people of Buffalo the
sincerest best wishes and heartfelt prayers of all New Yorkers;  and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to survivors and families of the victims  of  this  horrific
act of domestic terrorism.
