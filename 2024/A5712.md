  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

 VISOR,  DEPUTY  SHERIFF  PATROL  OR  DEPUTY  SHERIFF  PATROL  SUPERVISOR
 SUCCESSFULLY PASSED A PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION  WHICH  FAILED  TO  DISCLOSE
 EVIDENCE  OF  ANY  METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS (MRSA) OR

  C.  THE  ANNUAL  RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE PAYABLE SHALL BE EQUAL TO THREE-
 QUARTERS OF HIS OR HER FINAL AVERAGE SALARY.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to section 25 of the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow certain members of the New York State and  Local
 Employees'  Retirement System (NYSLERS) employed as correction officers,
 correction supervisors, deputy sheriff patrol, or deputy sheriff  patrol
 supervisors  to  receive a performance of duty disability benefit of 75%
 of final  average  salary  if  they  are  disabled  due  to  job-related
 contraction  of  methicillin  resistant  staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or
 Staph/MRSA.  There will be no reduction for any benefits received  under
 Workers' Compensation.
  Insofar  as this bill would affect the NYSLERS, if this legislation is
 enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it would lead to more disa-
 bilities being classified as "in performance of  duty".  The  cost  will
 depend  upon the applicant's age, service, salary, plan, and any benefit
 type otherwise payable.
 
 Benefit without  None  Ordinary  Performance of  Service
  enactment:  Disability  Duty Disability
 
 Cost for proposed  11 times  6 times  3.5 times  3 times
  benefit:  salary  salary  salary  salary
 
  All costs will be shared by the  State  of  New  York  and  all  local
 participating employers in the NYSLERS.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
