 New  York  city uniformed correction/sanitation revised plan members and
 investigator revised plan members shall not be eligible  to  retire  for
 service prior to the attainment of twenty years of credited service, AND
 PROVIDED  FURTHER  THAT  FOR  NEW YORK CITY UNIFORMED CORRECTION REVISED

  c.  The  deferred vested benefit of police/fire members, New York city
 police/fire  revised  plan  members,  New  York  city  uniformed
 correction/sanitation  revised plan members or investigator revised plan
 members shall be a pension commencing at early retirement age  equal  to

 subject to annual escalation in the same manner as provided for an early
 retirement  benefit  pursuant  to  subdivision c of section five hundred
 five of this article.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Sections 505,
 511, and 516 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to  elimi-
 nate  the  offset equal to 50% of the primary Social Security benefit in
 the normal service, early service, and vested  retirement  benefits  for
 Tier  3  Correction members in the original, revised, and enhanced plans
 (i.e., the 22-Year Plans) of the New  York  City  Employees'  Retirement
 System (NYCERS) who are subject to Article 14 of the RSSL.
  Effective Date: Sixty days after enactment.
  IMPACT  ON  BENEFITS:  Currently,  the  RSSL Article 14 normal service
 retirement, early service retirement, and vested retirement benefits for
 Correction members in 22-Year Plans are subject to an  offset  equal  to
 50%  of  the  primary Social Security benefit as defined in RSSL Section
 511 beginning at age 62.
  Under the proposed legislation, the offset for such benefits would  be
 eliminated resulting in an increase in benefits.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT:  Based on the census data and the actuarial assump-
 tions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of  this  proposed
 legislation  would result in an initial increase in the Present Value of
 Future Benefits (PVFB) and the present value of future employer contrib-
 utions of approximately $143.3 million.
  The  financial  impact  will  increase  as  the  impacted  population
 increases  over  time.  The  estimate of the increase in annual employer
 contributions for Fiscal Years 2024 through 2028 are shown in the  table
 below.
 
  Fiscal  Increase in
  Year  Employer Contributions
  ($ Millions)
  2024  $ 13.8
  2025  $ 14.7
  2026  $ 15.4
  2027  $ 16.3
  2028  $ 17.4
 
  New  Unfunded  Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to benefit changes
 are generally amortized over the remaining  working  lifetime  of  those
 impacted by the benefit changes. The remaining working lifetime for this
 group  is  approximately  15 years and the increase in UAL was therefore
 amortized over a 15-year period (14  payments  under  the  One-Year  Lag
 Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The 3,072 active Tier 3 Correction members in Article 14 22-Year Plans
 as  of  June  30,  2022  had an average age of approximately 38.3 years,
 average service of approximately 7.0 years, and  an  average  salary  of
 approximately $107,000.

  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  New  entrants  were projected to replace the members expected to leave
 the active population to maintain a steady-state population. New entrant
 demographics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actu-
 arial judgement.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.  Costs are also dependent on the  actuarial  methods  used,  and
 therefore  different  actuarial methods could produce different results.
 Quantifying these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  * The  initial,  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  *  Pensions  costs  for  future  members  of  NYCERS hired on or after
 7/1/2026.
  * Cost analyses relating  to  provisions  contained  in  RSSL  Section
 500(c).
  STATEMENT  OF  ACTUARIAL  OPINION:  I, Marek Tyszkiewicz, am the Chief
 Actuary for, and independent of, the New York  City  Retirement  Systems
 and  Pension  Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries and a
 Member of the American Academy of Actuaries. I am a member of NYCERS but
 do not believe it impairs my objectivity and I  meet  the  Qualification
 Standards  of  the American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial
 opinion contained herein. To the  best  of  my  knowledge,  the  results
 contained  herein  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally
 accepted actuarial principles and  procedures  and  with  the  Actuarial
 Standards of Practice issued by the Actuarial Standards Board.
  FISCAL  NOTE  IDENTIFICATION:  This Fiscal Note 2023-04 dated March 1,
 2023 was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City  Employees'
 Retirement  System.  This  estimate  is intended for use only during the
 2023 Legislative Session.
