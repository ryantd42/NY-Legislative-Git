  (c)  the  property  is  used  exclusively  for  residential  purposes;
 provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is not

 or her disability.
  5. Application for such exemption shall be filed with the assessor  or
 other agency, department or office designated by the municipality offer-
 ing  such  exemption  on  or before the taxable status date on a form as
