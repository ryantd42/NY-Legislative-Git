outstanding  professionals  in  the  boxing  industry  who distinguished
themselves  through  their  exceptional  performance,  attaining
unprecedented  success  and  the  highest level of personal achievement;

  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor

honored  within  the  Modern  category of boxers at the 35th Anniversary

  WHEREAS, Born on August 25, 1977 in  Columbia,  SC,  Diego  Corrales

John  Brown  (W  12), Derrick Gainer (TKO 3) and Angel Manfredy (TKO 3);

  WHEREAS, Facing Joel Casamayor in back-to-back bouts, Diego Corrales

featherweight title; and
 
  WHEREAS, In his next notable competition, Diego Corrales won the WBO
