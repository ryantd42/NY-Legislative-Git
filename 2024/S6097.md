 certain  Tier  4 carpenter titles from the physically taxing provisions,
 which permit retirement at age 50 (with 25 years of credited service).
  Participants  in  Eligible  Carpenter Titles who started in the Age 57
 Retirement Program (57/5 Plan), but will not reach 25 years of  credited
 service  in  a physically taxing title by age 57, would be ineligible to
 take advantage of the early  retirement  provisions  of  the  physically
 taxing title.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  these  members would no longer pay
 physically taxing  Additional  Member  Contributions  (AMCs)  and  would
 receive an immediate refund of the employee portion (i.e., 50%) of their
 physically taxing AMCs plus interest.
  Eligible  Carpenter  Titles  are  participants  in  the  New York City
 Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) or the Board of Education  Retire-
 ment  System  of  the  City  of New York (BERS) in the physically taxing
 titles of carpenter, supervisor carpenter,  ship  carpenter,  supervisor
 ship carpenter, rigger, dockbuilder, supervisor dockbuilder, and general
 supervisor dockbuilder.
  Participants  would  remain  responsible  for  applicable basic member
 contributions and applicable non-physically taxing  AMCs  for  continued
 57/5 Plan participation.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on census data and the actu-
 arial assumptions and methods described herein, the  enactment  of  this
 proposed legislation would result in an increase in the present value of
 future  employer contributions for NYCERS and BERS of approximately $4.8
 million.
  Under the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the  employer
 contributions  to  NYCERS  and  BERS,  there would be an increase in the
 Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) of approximately $2.2  million  and  an
 increase in the Present Value of Future Employer Normal Cost of approxi-
 mately $2.6 million. These results are summarized in the table below:

  Change in ($ Thousands):  NYCERS  BERS  Total
  Actuarial Value of Assets (AVA)  $(5,234)  $ (89)  $(5,323)
  Accrued Liability (AL)  $(3,093)  $ (44)  $(3,137)
  Unfunded Accrued Liability (AL - AVA)  $ 2,141  $  45  $ 2,186
  Present Value of Future
  Employer Normal Cost  $ 2,535  $  61  $ 2,596
 
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer  contributions of approximately $860,000 for NYCERS and $17,000
 for BERS which is the result of an increase in the Normal Cost in  addi-
 tion  to  the UAL payment. The initial increase in the employer contrib-
 utions is estimated to be $378,000 for New York City  and  $499,000  for
 the non-New York City obligors.
  New  UAL  attributable to benefit changes are generally amortized over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The remaining working lifetime for this  group  is  approximately  seven
 years  for  NYCERS  and eight years for BERS and the increase in UAL was
 therefore amortized over a seven-year period (six payments)  for  NYCERS
 and  over  an eight-year period (seven payments) for BERS under the One-
 Year Lag Methodology using level dollar payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS and BERS to
 determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.

  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions  of  NYCERS  and
 BERS.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of  NYCERS  and BERS used to determine employer contributions
 for Fiscal Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
