  Seizure and forfeiture of vehicles used in the unlicensed operation of
 a motor vehicle AND RECKLESS DRIVING under certain circumstances.
  2.  Any  motor vehicle which has been or is being used in violation of
 paragraph (a) of subdivision  three  of  section  five  hundred  eleven,
 SECTION  TWELVE  HUNDRED  TWELVE,  OR SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED TWELVE-A of
 this [article] CHAPTER may be seized by any peace officer, acting pursu-
 ant to his or her special duties, or police officer,  and  forfeited  as
 hereinafter provided in this section.
  (ii)  The  person  seeking  to  claim  the motor vehicle has furnished
 satisfactory evidence of registration and financial security and, if the
 person was the operator of the vehicle at the time of the  violation  of
 paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  three  of  section five hundred eleven,
 SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED TWELVE, OR TWELVE HUNDRED TWELVE-A of this [arti-
 cle]CHAPTER, satisfactory evidence of payment of any fines or  penalties
 imposed in connection therewith; and
  6. Where a demand for the return of a motor vehicle is not made within
 ninety  days  after  the  termination of the criminal proceeding founded
 upon the charge of aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in
 the first degree, RECKLESS DRIVING, OR AGGRAVATED RECKLESS DRIVING, such
 motor vehicle shall be deemed to be abandoned.  Such  vehicle  shall  be
 disposed  of  by  the  county, cities of New York, Yonkers, Rochester or
 Buffalo or the state, as applicable, in accordance with  section  twelve
 hundred twenty-four of this chapter or as otherwise provided by law.
  8.  Any  owner  who receives notice of the institution of a forfeiture
 action who claims an interest in the motor vehicle subject to forfeiture
 shall assert a claim for the recovery of the motor vehicle or  satisfac-
 tion of the owner's interest in such motor vehicle by intervening in the
 forfeiture  action  in  accordance  with  subdivision (a) of section one
 thousand twelve of the civil practice law and rules. Any person  with  a
 security interest in such vehicle who receives notice of the institution
 of  the  forfeiture  action shall assert a claim for the satisfaction of
 such person's security interest in such vehicle by  intervening  in  the
 forfeiture  action  in  accordance  with  subdivision (a) of section one
 thousand twelve of the civil practice law and  rules.  If  the  action
 relates  to  a vehicle in which a person holding a security interest has
 intervened pursuant to this subdivision, the burden shall  be  upon  the
 designated  official to prove by clear and convincing evidence that such
 intervenor knew that such vehicle was or would be used for  the  commis-
 sion of a violation of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision
 three  of section five hundred eleven, SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED TWELVE, OR
 TWELVE HUNDRED TWELVE-A of [the vehicle and traffic  law]  THIS  CHAPTER
 and  either (a) knowingly and unlawfully benefitted from such conduct or
 (b) voluntarily agreed to the use of the vehicle for the  commission  of
 such  violation  by  consent freely given. For purposes of this subdivi-
 sion, such  intervenor  knowingly  and  unlawfully  benefited  from  the
 commission  of  such  violation  when  he or she derived in exchange for
 permitting the use of such vehicle by a  person  or  persons  committing
 such  specified violation a substantial benefit that would otherwise not
 have accrued as a result of the lawful use of  such  vehicle.  "Benefit"
 means  benefit  as  defined in subdivision seventeen of section 10.00 of
 the penal law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
