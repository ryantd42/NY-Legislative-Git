 Introduced  by  Sen.  COONEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Procurement and Contracts
 
 AN ACT to amend the state finance  law,  in  relation  to  comprehensive
  delivery;  to  amend  the  public  authorities law, in relation to any
  development entity for the purposes of development or operation of  an
  approved  project  for  the purposes of comprehensive delivery; and to
  amend the local finance law, in relation  to  a  municipality,  school
  district  or district corporation having the power to contract indebt-
  edness for the purposes of  implementing  the  provisions  of  article
  nine-A of the state finance law
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  there  is a public need to accelerate delivery of energy
 and infrastructure improvements to address critical needs of  the  state
 and  its political subdivisions, including: (i) achieving net zero emis-
 sions state-wide by 2050; (ii) rapid development  of  affordable  homes,
 educational  facilities  and  housing and access to high-speed broadband
 internet; (iii) replenishment and improvement  of  core  transportation,
 aviation,  transit  and  vertical  infrastructure;  (iv) clean water and
 efficient sewer systems and waste technologies; (v) climate change miti-
 gation and flood and grid  resiliency;  (vi)  generating  and  enhancing
 pro-labor  jobs  and attracting new talent to New York; (vii) bolstering
 global investment and development in New York; (viii) increasing  oppor-
 tunities  for  small,  minority-owned, women-owned and serviced disabled
 veteran owned businesses; (ix) fully unlocking and enabling  accelerated
 access  to  federal  funding for energy and infrastructure projects; and
 (x) addressing the deferred maintenance crisis across New York's infras-
 tructure. Authorizing a consolidated delivery approach that  allows  for
 one  or more of design, construction, finance, operations and/or mainte-
 nance under a single contract can, where appropriate, more  rapidly  and
 cost  effectively  result  in  the  achievement of each of the foregoing
 objectives and unlock access to federal capital requiring such statutory
 authorization.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
