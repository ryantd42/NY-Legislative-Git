 Introduced  by M. of A. BRONSON -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing  a  work-
  place readiness week for secondary school students
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as  the  "youth
 workplace readiness act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. It is the intent of the Legisla-
 ture  that New York pupils enter the workforce with a strong understand-
 ing of their rights as workers, as well  as  their  explicit  rights  as
 employed  minors.  It  is further the intent of the Legislature to equip
 pupils with this knowledge to protect them from retaliation and discrim-
 ination, to ensure that these young workers receive all wages and  bene-
 fits  to  which they are entitled, to empower them to refuse unsafe work
 when necessary, and to prepare them to assert their labor rights whenev-
 er these rights are threatened.
  The Legislature hereby finds and declares that young New Yorkers  must
 enter  the workforce having received a thorough education on their right
 to join or organize a union at their workplace. It is further the intent
 of the Legislature that secondary schools present state-approved appren-
 ticeship programs as a path towards a living wage career for all pupils.
  § 3. The education law is amended by adding a new section 818 to  read
 as follows:
  §  818.  WORKPLACE  READINESS  WEEK.  1.  THE  WEEK  OF EACH YEAR THAT
 INCLUDES MAY FIRST SHALL BE KNOWN AS  "WORKPLACE  READINESS  WEEK".  ALL
 SECONDARY SCHOOLS SHALL ANNUALLY OBSERVE THAT WEEK BY PROVIDING INFORMA-
 TION  TO  STUDENTS  ON THEIR RIGHTS AS WORKERS. THE TOPICS COVERED SHALL
 INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:
  (A) LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL LAWS REGARDING  EACH  OF  THE  FOLLOWING
