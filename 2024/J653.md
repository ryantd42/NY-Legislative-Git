  COMMENDING  Firefighter  William Richmond upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  by  the  Sea  Cliff  Fire Department in honor of his
  prompt and heroic actions on March 5, 2022
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  commend
Firefighter  William  Richmond  upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition by the Sea Cliff Fire Department  in  honor  of  his
prompt  and  heroic  actions  on  March 5, 2022, to be celebrated at its
Annual Installation Dinner on Friday, April 28, 2023,  at  the  Crescent
Beach Club in Bayville, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighter William Richmond has consistently demonstrated
a level of commitment, dedication, integrity and  professionalism  which
truly exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 5, 2022, the Sea Cliff Fire Department was alerted
for  a  person  pinned  by  a car in the rear of St Luke's Church in Sea
Cliff, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon arrival on scene, Firefighter William Richmond and his
fellow crew members located an elderly woman with her foot stuck between
the wheel of her car and brake caliper; remaining  calm  under  pressure
and  without  hesitation,  these  courageous men executed a plan and the
woman  was  successfully  extricated  and  transported  to  North  Shore
Manhasset  where doctors were able to save her foot with minimal damage;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
William  Richmond is such a firefighter; throughout his years of devoted
service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the  call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Firefighter  William  Richmond  upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation for special recognition by the Sea Cliff Fire Department  in
honor of his prompt, heroic and lifesaving actions on March 5, 2022; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter William Richmond.
