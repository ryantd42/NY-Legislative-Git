 be advertised for sale and sold at public or private sale in  a  commer-
 cially  reasonable  manner.  The [notice] FIRST AND SECOND NOTICES shall
 further include the time and place of any public or private sale and  it
 shall  state  that any person claiming an interest in the goods is enti-
 tled to bring a proceeding hereunder within  [ten]  SIXTY  days  of  the

 lien, or the amount claimed. The [notice] FIRST AND SECOND NOTICES shall
 be personally delivered to the occupant, or sent by registered or certi-
 fied mail to the occupant's last known address, or sent by verified mail
 and electronic mail to the occupant's last known address, AND  AT  LEAST
 ONE  OTHER  ADDRESS  PROVIDED  BY THE OCCUPANT TO THE OWNER, IF ANY. THE
