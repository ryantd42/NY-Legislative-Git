 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the John Theissen Children Foundation,
  Inc.  to receive retroactive real property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the John Theissen Children Foundation, Inc. an application for exemption
 from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-b of the real  property
 tax law for the 2022-2023 assessment roll for a portion of the 2022-2023
 school  taxes  and  a  portion  of the 2023 general taxes for the parcel
 conveyed to such organization located at 1492 Wantagh Avenue, hamlet  of
 Wantagh,  town of Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau
 county tax map section 56, block H, lot 2319. If accepted, the  applica-
 tion shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxa-
 ble status dates established for such roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the  subject roll. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  roll,  the  applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
