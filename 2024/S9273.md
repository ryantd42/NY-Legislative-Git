  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Subdivision  1 of section 1 of chapter 693 of the laws of
 1980, enabling the county of Albany to impose and collect taxes on occu-
 pancy of hotel or motel rooms in Albany county, as  amended  by  chapter

  (1)  Notwithstanding  any other provisions of law to the contrary, the
 county of Albany is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt  and  amend
 local  laws imposing in such county a tax in addition to any tax author-
 ized and imposed pursuant to article twenty-nine of the tax law such  as
 the  legislature  has or would have the power and authority to impose on
 persons occupying hotel or motel rooms in such county.  FOR PURPOSES  OF
 THIS  SECTION,  THE  TERM  "HOTEL" OR "MOTEL" SHALL MEAN AND INCLUDE ANY
 FACILITY CONSISTING OF RENTABLE UNITS THAT PROVIDES LODGING ON AN  OVER-

 provided, however, such tax shall not be applicable to a permanent resi-
 dent of a hotel or motel.  THE RATES OF SUCH TAX  IMPOSED  UPON  PERSONS
 OCCUPYING SHORT-TERM RENTALS SHALL BE SIX PERCENT OF THE PER DIEM RENTAL
 RATE  CHARGED  TO  OCCUPANTS  FOR EACH ROOM, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, SUCH TAX
 SHALL NOT BE APPLICABLE TO  A  PERMANENT  RESIDENT  OF  SUCH  SHORT-TERM
 RENTAL.  For  the purposes of this section the term "permanent resident"
 shall mean a person occupying any room or rooms in a hotel or  motel  OR
 SHORT-TERM RENTAL for at least thirty consecutive days.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall  have  become a law; provided, however, that the amendments to
 subdivision 1 of section 1 of chapter 693 of the laws of  1980  made  by
 section  one of this act shall not affect the repeal of such subdivision
 and shall be deemed repealed therewith.
