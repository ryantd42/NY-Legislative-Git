 MENT  ADOPTED  BY  THE BOARD TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT AN INCARCERATED

 INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL'S RISK OF RE-OFFENSE. SHOULD THE BOARD CHOOSE TO
 OVERRIDE  SUCH  RISK  AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT AN
 INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL WILL LIVE AND REMAIN AT LIBERTY WITHOUT  VIOLAT-
 ING  THE  LAW,  ITS DECISION MUST PROVIDE A DETAILED, INDIVIDUALIZED AND
 NONCONCLUSORY STATEMENT AS TO ITS REASONS FOR DEPARTING  FROM  THE  RISK
 AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT FINDINGS WHICH SHALL BE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW.
 SUCH OVERRIDE DECISION SHALL NOT BE BASED SOLELY ON INFORMATION RELATING
 TO  THE  INSTANT  OFFENSE  AND/OR  THE  PRE-SENTENCING  REPORT  FOR SUCH
 OFFENSE. PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ELEVEN OF THIS SECTION, THE BOARD SHALL

 that, if such incarcerated individual is released, he or she  will  live
 and  remain  at  liberty  without violating the law, and that his or her
 release  is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so
 deprecate the seriousness of his or her crime as  to  undermine  respect
 for  law.  In  making the parole release decision, the procedures, RULES
 AND REGULATIONS INCORPORATING RISK AND NEEDS PRINCIPLES adopted pursuant
 to subdivision four of section two hundred fifty-nine-c of this  article

 plans including community resources, employment, education and  training

 any current or prior statement made to the board by the crime victim  or
 the  victim's  representative,  where the crime victim is deceased or is

 of the offense with due consideration to the type of sentence, length of

 attorney, the attorney for the incarcerated individual, the pre-sentence
 probation report as well as consideration of any mitigating  and  aggra-
 vating  factors,  and  activities following arrest prior to confinement;
 and (viii) prior criminal record, including the nature  and  pattern  of
 offenses, adjustment to any previous probation or parole supervision and
 institutional  confinement.  The board shall provide toll free telephone
 access for crime victims. In the case  of  an  oral  statement  made  in

 dure  law, the parole board member shall present a written report of the
 statement to the parole board. A  crime  victim's  representative  shall
