 license to carry or possess a pistol or revolver,  issued  at  any  time
 pursuant  to  this  section  or prior to the first day of July, nineteen
 hundred sixty-three and not limited to expire on an earlier  date  fixed
 in the license, shall[, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of
 this  subdivision,]  expire  not more than three years after the date of
 A. 5049  5
 
 issuance. In the  counties  of  Nassau,  Suffolk  and  Westchester,  any
 license  to  carry  or  possess a pistol or revolver, issued at any time
 pursuant to this section or prior to the first  day  of  July,  nineteen
 hundred  sixty-three  and not limited to expire on an earlier date fixed
 in the license, shall expire not more than five years after the date  of

 be certified prior to the first day of April, two thousand,  in  accord-
 ance  with  a schedule to be contained in regulations promulgated by the
 commissioner of the division of criminal  justice  services,  and  every
 such  license  shall[,  except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of
 this subdivision,] be  recertified  every  five  years  thereafter.  For
 purposes  of  this  section  certification  shall mean that the licensee
 shall provide to the licensing officer the following  information  only:
 current name, date of birth, current address, and the make, model, cali-
 ber  and serial number of all firearms currently possessed. Such certif-
 ication information shall be filed by the licensing officer in the  same
 manner  as  an amendment. Elsewhere than in the city of New York and the
 counties of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester, any  license  to  carry  or
 possess  a  pistol  or  revolver,  issued  at  any time pursuant to this
 section or prior to the first day of July, nineteen hundred  sixty-three
 and  not  previously  revoked or cancelled, shall be in force and effect
 until revoked as herein provided. Any license not  previously  cancelled
 or  revoked shall remain in full force and effect for thirty days beyond
 the stated expiration date on such license. Any application to  renew  a
 license that has not previously expired, been revoked or cancelled shall
 thereby extend the term of the license until disposition of the applica-
 tion  by the licensing officer. In the case of a license for gunsmith or
 dealer in firearms, in counties having a population  of  less  than  two
 hundred  thousand  inhabitants,  photographs  and  fingerprints shall be
 submitted on original applications and upon renewal thereafter  ONLY  at
 [three]  SIX  year  intervals.  Upon satisfactory proof that a currently
 valid original license has been despoiled,  lost  or  otherwise  removed
 from  the  possession of the licensee and upon application containing an
 additional photograph of the licensee, the licensing officer shall issue
 a duplicate license.
  (b) All licensees shall be recertified to the division of state police
 every five years thereafter[, except as otherwise provided in  paragraph
 (d)  of  this subdivision]. Any license issued before the effective date
 of the chapter of the laws of two thousand  thirteen  which  added  this
 paragraph  shall  be  recertified  by  the licensee on or before January
 thirty-first, two thousand eighteen, and not less than one year prior to
 such date, the state police shall send a notice to all  license  holders
 who  have not recertified by such time. Such recertification shall be in
 a form as approved by the superintendent of state  police,  which  shall
 request the license holder's name, date of birth, gender, race, residen-
 tial address, social security number, firearms possessed by such license
 holder,  email address at the option of the license holder and an affir-
 mation that such  license  holder  is  not  prohibited  from  possessing
 firearms.  The form may be in an electronic form if so designated by the
 superintendent of state police. Failure to  recertify  shall  act  as  a
 revocation  of  such license. If the New York state police discover as a
 result of the recertification process that a licensee failed to  provide
 a  change  of  address,  the New York state police shall not require the
 licensing officer to revoke such license.
  (c) A license to purchase or take possession of a semiautomatic  rifle
 as  defined  in  subdivision two of this section shall be recertified to
 A. 5049  6
 
 the applicable licensing officer every five years following the issuance
 of such license. Failure to renew such a license shall  be  a  violation
 punishable  by  a fine not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars, and such
 failure  to  renew  shall  be  considered  by the licensing officer when
 reviewing future license applications by the license holder pursuant  to
 this chapter.
  [(d)  Licenses  issued  under paragraph (f) of subdivision two of this
 section shall be recertified or renewed in the same form and  manner  as
 otherwise  required  by  this  subdivision,  provided however, that such
 licenses shall be recertified or renewed every three years following the
 issuance of such license. For licenses issued  prior  to  the  effective
 date  of  this paragraph that were issued more than three years prior to
 such date, or will expire in less than one year from such date shall  be
 recertified or renewed within one year of such date.]
  11. License: revocation and suspension. (a) The conviction of a licen-
 see  anywhere  of  a felony or serious offense or a licensee at any time

 revoked and cancelled at any time in the city of New York,  and  in  the
 counties  of Nassau and Suffolk, by the licensing officer, and elsewhere
 than in the city of New York by any judge  or  justice  of  a  court  of
 record;  a license issued pursuant to section 400.01 of this article may

 judge  or justice of a court of record. A license to engage in the busi-
 ness of dealer may be revoked or suspended  for  any  violation  of  the
 provisions  of  article  thirty-nine-BB of the general business law. The
 official revoking a license shall give written  notice  thereof  without
 unnecessary delay to the executive department, division of state police,
 Albany,  and  shall  also notify immediately the duly constituted police
 authorities of the locality. [The licensing  officer  shall  revoke  any
 license  issued  in  which  an applicant knowingly made a material false
 statement on the application. Notice of a revocation under this subdivi-
 sion shall be issued in writing and shall  include  the  basis  for  the
 determination,  which  shall  be  supported  by  a  preponderance of the
 evidence. Such notice shall also include information regarding the abil-
 ity to appeal such decision in accordance  with  subdivision  four-a  of

 license issued pursuant to this section, to  the  appropriate  licensing
 official, who shall issue an order suspending or revoking such license.

 person  shall be surrendered to an appropriate law enforcement agency as
 provided in subparagraph (f)  of  paragraph  one  of  subdivision  a  of
 section  265.20  of  this  chapter.  In the event such license, firearm,
 shotgun, or rifle is not surrendered, such items shall  be  removed  and

 § 400.02 Statewide license and record database.
  [1.]  There  shall  be  a  statewide license and record database which
 shall be created and maintained by the division of state police the cost
 of which shall not be borne by any municipality.  Records  assembled  or
 collected  for  purposes  of  inclusion  in  such  database shall not be
 subject to disclosure pursuant to article six  of  the  public  officers
 law. [All records] RECORDS containing granted license applications [from
 all  licensing  authorities]  shall be [monthly] PERIODICALLY checked by
 the division of criminal justice services [in conjunction with the divi-
 sion of state police] against  criminal  conviction,  [criminal  indict-
 ment,]  mental  health,  [extreme  risk  protection  orders,  orders  of
 protection,] and all other records as are necessary to  determine  their
 continued accuracy as well as whether an individual is no longer a valid
 license  holder.  The  division  of criminal justice services shall also
 check pending applications made pursuant to this  article  against  such
 records  to  determine  whether a license may be granted. All state [and
 local] agencies shall cooperate with the division  of  criminal  justice
 services, as otherwise authorized by law, in making their records avail-
 able  for  such  checks. The division of criminal justice services, upon
 determining that an individual is ineligible to possess a license, or is
 no longer a valid license holder, shall notify the applicable  licensing
 official  of  such  determination  and such licensing official shall not
 issue a license or [shall] revoke such license and any weapons owned  or
 possessed  by  such  individual  shall  be  removed  consistent with the
 provisions of subdivision eleven of  section  400.00  of  this  article.
 Local  and  state  law enforcement shall have access to such database in
 the performance of their duties.  Records  assembled  or  collected  for
 purposes  of inclusion in the database established by this section shall
 be released pursuant to a court order.
  [2. There shall be a statewide license and  record  database  specific
 for  ammunition sales which shall be created and maintained by the divi-
 sion of state police the cost of which shall not be borne by any munici-
 pality no later than thirty days upon designating the division of  state
 police  as  the  point of contact to perform both firearm and ammunition
 background checks under federal and  state  law.  Records  assembled  or
 collected  for  purposes  of  inclusion  in  such  database shall not be
 subject to disclosure pursuant to article six  of  the  public  officers
 law.  All  records  containing  granted  license  applications  from all
 licensing authorities shall be monthly checked by the division of crimi-
 nal justice services in conjunction with the division  of  state  police
 against  criminal  conviction,  criminal  indictments,  mental  health,
 extreme risk protection orders, orders  of  protection,  and  all  other
 records  as  are necessary to determine their continued accuracy as well
 as whether an individual is no longer a valid license holder. The  divi-
 sion  of criminal justice services shall also check pending applications
 A. 5049  8

 made pursuant to this article against such records to determine  whether
 a  license  may be granted. All state and local agencies shall cooperate
 with the division of criminal justice services, as otherwise  authorized
 by law, in making their records available for such checks. No later than
 thirty  days after the superintendent of the state police certifies that
 the statewide license and record database established pursuant  to  this
 section  and  the  statewide license and record database established for
 ammunition sales are operational for the purposes  of  this  section,  a
 dealer  in firearms licensed pursuant to section 400.00 of this article,

 265.00  of  this  chapter shall not transfer any ammunition to any other
 person who is not a dealer in firearms as defined in subdivision nine of
 such section 265.00 or a seller of ammunition as defined in  subdivision
 twenty-four of section 265.00 of this chapter, unless:
  (a)  before  the  completion  of  the transfer, the licensee or seller
 contacts the statewide license and  record  database  and  provides  the
 database  with  information sufficient to identify such dealer or seller
 transferee based on information on the transferee's identification docu-
 ment as defined in paragraph (c) of this subdivision,  as  well  as  the
 amount,  caliber, manufacturer's name and serial number, if any, of such
 ammunition;
  (b) the licensee or seller is provided with  a  unique  identification
 number; and
  (c)  the  transferor  has  verified  the identity of the transferee by
 examining a valid state identification document of the transferee issued
 by the department of motor vehicles or if the transferee is not a  resi-
 dent of the state of New York, a valid identification document issued by
 the  transferee's  state or country of residence containing a photograph
 of the transferee.]

 amended  by section 8 of chapter 371 of the laws of 2022, are amended to
 read as follows:
  2. Any seller of ammunition or dealer in firearms shall  keep  [either
 an  electronic  record, or dataset, or an organized collection of struc-
 tured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a comput-
 er system] A RECORD BOOK approved as to form by  the  superintendent  of
 state  police.  In the record BOOK shall be entered at the time of every
 transaction involving ammunition the date,  name,  age,  occupation  and
 residence  of  any  person  from  whom ammunition is received or to whom
 ammunition is delivered, and the amount,  calibre,  manufacturer's  name
 and  serial number, or if none, any other distinguishing number or iden-
 tification mark on such ammunition.  THE RECORD BOOK SHALL BE MAINTAINED
 ON THE PREMISES MENTIONED AND DESCRIBED IN THE LICENSE AND SHALL BE OPEN
 AT ALL REASONABLE HOURS FOR INSPECTION  BY  ANY  PEACE  OFFICER,  ACTING
 PURSUANT  TO  HIS  OR  HER SPECIAL DUTIES, OR POLICE OFFICER. ANY RECORD
 PRODUCED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION AND ANY TRANSMISSION  THEREOF  TO  ANY

 checks  of  ammunition  purchasers may be conducted through the national
 instant criminal background check system [or  through  the  division  of
 state  police  once  the division has been designated point of contact],
 use of that system by a dealer or seller shall be sufficient to  satisfy
 subdivisions  four  and  five  of  this section and such checks shall be
 conducted through such system, provided that a  record  of  such  trans-
 A. 5049  9
 
 action  shall  be  forwarded to the state police in a form determined by
 the superintendent.
