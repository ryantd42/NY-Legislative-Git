 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  CUNNINGHAM  -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive  law,  in  relation  to  establishing  the
  commission  for  the  modernization  and  revitalization  of the state
  university of New York downstate medical center
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The executive law is amended by adding a new article 49-C
 to read as follows:
 
  ARTICLE 49-C
  COMMISSION FOR THE MODERNIZATION AND REVITALIZATION OF SUNY DOWNSTATE
  MEDICAL CENTER
 SECTION 996. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
  996-A. COMMISSION FOR THE MODERNIZATION  AND  REVITALIZATION  OF
  SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER.
  996-B. SEVERABILITY.
  §  996.  LEGISLATIVE  INTENT.  1.  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY  FINDS AND
 DECLARES THAT THE STATE UNIVERSITY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER (HEREINAFTER
 REFERRED TO AS "DOWNSTATE") AS ESTABLISHED  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  THREE
 HUNDRED  FIFTY-TWO  OF  THE  EDUCATION  LAW, IS A VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR
 STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AS ONE OF THREE STATE HOSPITALS AND THE ONLY
 STATE HOSPITAL IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, IT IS INCUMBENT UPON  THE  STATE
 TO  ENSURE  THAT  THIS  HOSPITAL  REMAINS FISCALLY VIABLE TO CONTINUE TO
 PROVIDE THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT THE RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL  BROOKLYN
 DESERVE  AND DEPEND ON. THE STATE UNIVERSITY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER IS
 ONE OF THE STATE'S LARGEST SAFETY-NET HOSPITALS,  WHICH  CARES  FOR  ALL
 PATIENTS,  REGARDLESS  OF  THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. IT PREDOMINANTLY SERVES
 PEOPLE OF COLOR, LOW INCOME, UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED,  UNDOCUMENTED  AND
 AT-RISK  INDIVIDUALS  WHO  HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE
 AND WHO ARE MORE PRONE TO SUFFER FROM SERIOUS DISEASE  AND  FACE  HIGHER
 MORBIDITY  RATES  THAN  OTHER PATIENTS ACROSS OUR CITY AND STATE. IN TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-TWO, THE HOSPITAL HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUTPA-
 TIENT VISITS AND HAS AN AVERAGE OF  FOURTEEN  THOUSAND  INPATIENTS  EACH

 YEAR.  IT  ALSO PROVIDES SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FREE HEALTH SCREEN-
 INGS A YEAR AND SPONSORS OVER ONE  HUNDRED  COMMUNITY  SERVICE  PROJECTS
 ANNUALLY.
  2. PROVIDED FURTHER, DOWNSTATE IS IN THE HEART OF CENTRAL BROOKLYN AND
 HAS  THE  LARGEST MEDICAL SCHOOL IN NEW YORK CITY, WHICH OFFERS TRAINING
 IN FIFTY-SIX SPECIALTIES ACROSS FIVE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES  AND  ANNUALLY
 EDUCATES  AND  TRAINS  NEARLY  ONE  THOUSAND  NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS. THE
 MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENT POPULATION IS MADE UP  OF  NEARLY  SIXTY  PERCENT
 STUDENTS OF COLOR, PRODUCES THE MOST PHYSICIANS OF COLOR IN THE STATE OF
 NEW  YORK,  AND NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-TWO GRADU-
 ATES REMAINED IN NEW YORK FOR THEIR RESIDENCY. HAVING A HOSPITAL  AFFIL-
 IATED  WITH  THE  MEDICAL  SCHOOL  IS  BOTH CRITICAL FOR THE TRAINING OF
 MEDICAL STUDENTS AND IS AN ESSENTIAL PART IN PRODUCING THE  NEXT  GENER-
 ATION  OF  HEALTH  CARE  PROFESSIONALS,  WHICH ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO
 ENHANCE THE ACCESS TO VITAL HEALTH CARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
  3. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT THE ENTIRE BROOKLYN HEALTH  CARE
 DELIVERY  SYSTEM  REMAINS  IN  NEED  OF  A CONTINUED GLOBAL EXAMINATION,
 ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF EACH OF ITS DIVERSE COMMUNITIES,  THE  ACCESS  TO
 HIGH  QUALITY OF CARE THROUGHOUT BROOKLYN, THE DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH CARE
 EQUITIES AND DISPARITIES OF EACH COMMUNITY, THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIAL-
 TY SERVICES  FOR  LOW  INCOME  POPULATIONS,  AND  THE  INTERCONNECTIVITY
 BETWEEN  THE  VARIOUS HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM FINAN-
 CIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF EACH OF  THE  VARIOUS  DELIVERY  SYSTEMS  IN  THE
 BOROUGH.  SUCH  FURTHER EXAMINATION CAN BEGIN WITH THE MODERNIZATION AND
 REVITALIZATION OF DOWNSTATE CONTINUING AS A HOSPITAL  OFFERING  CRITICAL
 HOSPITAL SPECIALTY SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY, BECOMING A CORE SPECIALTY
 HOSPITAL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THOSE CRITICAL SPECIALTY SERVICES, BUT
 SIMULTANEOUSLY  UNDERTAKING  AN  EXAMINATION  OF  THE APPROPRIATENESS OF
 CONVERTING CERTAIN DESIGNATED INPATIENT BEDS THAT ARE NOT  UTILIZED  FOR
 THE SPECIALTY HOSPITAL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE PROVIDING SPECIALTY SERVICES
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION NINE HUNDRED NINETY-SIX-A OF THIS
 ARTICLE,  TO AN OUTPATIENT SETTING, EXPANDING SERVICES TO INCLUDE ACCESS
 TO PRIMARY CARE THROUGH CLINICS, URGENT CARE OR  OTHER  HOSPITAL  AFFIL-
 IATED PRACTICES.
  4.  THE  LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE
 STATE UNIVERSITY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER AS A FREE-STANDING STATE-OPER-
 ATED PUBLIC HOSPITAL, STAFFED WITH  PUBLIC  EMPLOYEES,  AT  ITS  CURRENT
 LOCATION, WITHIN AND UNDER THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY OF THE STATE UNIVER-
 SITY  OF  NEW  YORK  IN  A MODERNIZED AND REVITALIZED FORM, IS VITAL AND
 NECESSARY, AND THE STATE SHOULD DEVELOP A  PLAN  TO  ENSURE  ITS  FUTURE
 SUSTAINABILITY  AND  SHALL  PROVIDE  STATE  FUNDING  AND OTHER RESOURCES
 NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT AND EXECUTE SUCH PLAN. SUCH PLAN SHALL  BE  BASED
 ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION FOR THE MODERNIZATION AND REVI-
 TALIZATION  OF  SUNY  DOWNSTATE  MEDICAL  CENTER ("THE COMMISSION"). THE
 COMMISSION SHALL  EXAMINE  THOSE  SERVICES  THAT  ARE  NECESSARY  TO  BE
 PROVIDED  AT DOWNSTATE, ALTERNATIVE SERVICES WHICH ARE MORE SUITABLE FOR
 THE COMMUNITY, AND WHICH ARE IN ADDITION TO THE CORE  CENTER  OF  EXCEL-
 LENCE  SPECIALTY  SERVICES  WHICH  SHALL CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED AT DOWN-
 STATE.

 REFERRED TO AS "DOWNSTATE"), OR A DOWNSTATE AFFILIATE, WHICH SHALL BE IN
 A. 9421  3
 
 ADDITION TO THE CORE SPECIALTY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE SERVICES WHICH SHALL
 CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED AT DOWNSTATE, AND  MAKE  RECOMMENDATIONS  TO  THE
 LEGISLATURE  AND  THE EXECUTIVE. IN CONDUCTING ITS STUDY AND DETERMINING

 COMMUNITY  AS  IDENTIFIED  BY  THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION SHALL ALSO
 PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT EMERGENCY ROOM  OPERATIONS,  WHICH  SHALL
 INCLUDE,  BUT SHALL NOT BE LIMITED TO, PATIENT CARE AND SERVICE CAPACITY
