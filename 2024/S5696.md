  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Chapter 15 of the laws of 1998 relating to authorizing the
 extension of state and local deadlines following a state disaster  emer-
 gency is amended to read as follows:
  Section  1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary
 which relates to the collection of  real  property  taxes,  fees,  civil
 fines  or  other  moneys  owed to a municipal or district corporation OR
 SCHOOL DISTRICT, to the imposition of penalties or interest therefor for
 a late payment, or to the filing of an  application,  report,  or  other
 document,  form or other paper necessary for the processing of an appli-
 cation or other process to fulfill requirements to qualify for, or  meet

 officer of a municipal or district corporation OR SCHOOL DISTRICT in the
 affected area, extend the deadline for payment of any such  moneys  owed

 of state operations, rescinds the executive  order  which  declared  the
 state disaster emergency; provided that the governor, after consultation
 with  the  chief  executive  officer of the municipal or district corpo-
 ration OR SCHOOL DISTRICT in the affected area, may extend such deadline
 for a period of up to thirty days by so providing in the executive order
 declaring  that  the  state  disaster  emergency  has  ceased; provided,
 further, that no interest or penalties shall accrue during  such  exten-
 sion  period;  provided,  however,  that the governor may order that the
 extension period provided for in this section shall not be applicable to
 certain reporting requirements mandated under  state  law,  the  primary
 purpose  of which is to protect the health, safety or general welfare of
 the public from an imminent threat or danger.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary,  any
 deadline or date set by state law or regulation for the payment of fees,
 civil  fines  or  other  moneys owed to the state, for the imposition of
 penalties or interest therefor for a late payment made after such  date,
 or  for  the filing of an application, report or other document, form or
 other paper necessary for the processing  of  an  application  or  other
 process  to fulfill requirements of, qualify for, or meet a condition of
 a government assistance program for persons, businesses,  municipalities
 or corporations, higher education loans, grants or financial assistance,
 licenses,  registrations  or  any  other programs, administered by state
 government agencies, divisions, departments  or  offices,  shall,  where
 such  deadline  or  date  occurs  during  a  state disaster emergency as
 defined by section 20 of the executive law,  upon  the  issuance  of  an
 executive  order  declaring  a state disaster emergency, be extended for
 persons residing or located in the affected areas OR FOR CERTAIN CLASSES
 OR CATEGORIES OF PERSONS OR ENTITIES WITHIN THE AFFECTED  AREAS,  for  a
 period  of  time  from the date of the executive order declaring a state
 disaster emergency to the date that the governor, in  consultation  with
 the director of state operations, rescinds the executive order declaring
 the state disaster emergency; provided that the governor may extend such
 deadline for a period of up to thirty days by so providing in the execu-
 tive  order  declaring  that  the  state  disaster emergency has ceased;
 provided, however, that the governor may order that the extension period
 provided for in this section shall not be applicable to certain  report-
 ing  requirements mandated under state law, the primary purpose of which
 is to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the  public  from
 an imminent threat or danger.
  §  3. Where the provisions of this act have been invoked in connection
 with a state disaster emergency declared  by  the  governor,  the  state
 shall  provide aid to each affected municipal or district corporation OR
 SCHOOL DISTRICT, whichever is appropriate, to compensate it for the loss
 of interest or other investment income reasonably  attributable  to  the
 extension  of the period for the payment of moneys; provided, that in no
 case shall such aid exceed the moneys that  would  have  been  collected
 during the extension period or periods declared by the governor pursuant
 to  section one of this act, which shall not exceed thirty days from the
 date that the governor rescinded the executive order declaring  a  state
 disaster  emergency,  multiplied  by  an annualized interest rate of six
 percent. Such aid shall be payable upon the audit  and  warrant  of  the
 comptroller.
  §  4.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS ONE THROUGH THREE OF
 THIS ACT, THE GOVERNOR MAY, WHENEVER HE OR SHE DETERMINES THAT  A  STATE
 DISASTER EMERGENCY SO REQUIRES: (1) ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER EXTENDING A
