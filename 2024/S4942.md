 AN ACT to amend the New York state urban development corporation act, in
  relation to creating the New York state innovative energy and environ-
  mental technology program

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares that the success of innovative energy and  environmental  tech-
 nology-oriented  businesses  with  growth  potential is essential to the
 continued economic health and security of New York state. It is  further
 found  that  the development of new products to assist mature industries
 undergoing dramatic changes or facing increasing international  competi-
 tion  with  reducing energy costs and complying with environmental regu-
 lations, can serve to retain, and even increase, employment.  However,
 commercialization  of  these  products  is  restrained as numerous small
 businesses are limited by lack of early stage financing.
  Therefore, the legislature seeks to provide early stage funds,  via  a
 grants program, to stimulate the creation of a substantial number of new
 businesses  and  jobs  in  the  energy  and environmental sectors of New
 York's economy.
  § 2. Section 1 of chapter 174 of the laws of  1968,  constituting  the
 New York state urban development corporation act, is amended by adding a
 new section 16-bb to read as follows:
  § 16-BB. NEW YORK STATE INNOVATIVE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
