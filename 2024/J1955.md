  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2024 as Problem Gambling  Awareness  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
problems that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 2024 as Problem
Gambling Awareness Month in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with
the observance of National Problem Gambling Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  March  2024 will be observed as Problem Gambling Awareness
Month to create awareness around problem  gambling  in  accordance  with
National Problem Gambling Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Problem  gambling  can  impact  anyone  regardless  of
background, social or economic status, cultural background or  level  of
education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  survey  conducted  by  the  New  York  State  Office of
Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) found that five  percent
of  adults, or 668,000 individuals, exhibited problem gambling behaviors
within the past year; and
 
  WHEREAS, A survey of seventh through twelfth grade students revealed
that ten percent, or 140,000 students, showed signs of problem  gambling
in  the past 12 months and ten percent of those students were in need of
treatment for problem gambling; and
 
  WHEREAS, As mobile sports betting continues  to  grow  in  New  York
State, we must take steps in making sure those who participate in sports
gambling  do  not  become addicted, and if they do, they have the proper
resources for recovery; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York has seen record-breaking amounts of revenue  since
the  introduction of mobile betting as well as the State's collection of
more than $1.55 billion in taxes on such bets; and
 
  WHEREAS, The growth and expansion of mobile betting in the State  of
New  York  requires  that we ensure that the education and resources are
available for people to responsibly engage in gambling, and  to  prevent
and mitigate problem gambling; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  March  2024  as  Problem
Gambling  Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of New York, and to urge its
citizens to increase  public  awareness  of  problem  gambling  and  the
availability  of  prevention, treatment and recovery services; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
