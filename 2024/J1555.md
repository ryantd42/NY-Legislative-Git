  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Wildfire Safety Awareness Month in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
environmental  disasters  that  affect the lives of citizens of New York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  2024,  as  Wildfire
Safety Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Wildfire Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Wildfire  Awareness  Month  dedicates the entire
month of May to increasing prevention  and  preparedness  for  wildfires
throughout the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to the National Interagency Fire Center, humans
cause an average of 68% of fires per year in the United States; of those
human-started  fires,  2.8  million  acres  burn  each  year;  in  2018,
8,767,492 acres burned due to human-started fires and lightning strikes;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  steps to take to prevent wildfires; from using
fire resisting building materials to following the safety protocols  for
handling  fire  when camping, heating your home or storing fuel, all New
Yorkers can take part in reducing wildfires; and
 
  WHEREAS, While wildfires may not be prevalent in  every  state,  the
responsibility  to be aware and alert belongs to everyone; the causes of
wildfires can occur in every state, and as mobile as our lifestyles have
become, everyone needs to be prepared; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  both
the  prevention  and preparedness of wildfires, and more must be done to
increase  activity  at  the  local,  State  and  National  levels;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  2024,  as  Wildfire
Safety Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be if further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
