 A. 5613--B  2
 
  (B) An agency shall not deny a request on the basis that  the  request
 is  voluminous  or  that  locating  or reviewing the requested RECORD OR
 records or providing the requested  copies  is  burdensome  because  the
 agency lacks sufficient staffing or on any other basis if the agency may
 engage  an  outside professional service to provide copying, programming
 or other services required to provide the copy, the costs of  which  the
 agency  may  recover  pursuant  to  paragraph  (c) of subdivision one of
 section eighty-seven of this article.
  (C) An agency may require a  person  requesting  lists  of  names  and
 addresses  to  provide a written certification that such person will not
 use such lists of names OF NATURAL PERSONS and RESIDENTIAL addresses for
 solicitation or fund-raising purposes and will not sell, give or  other-
 wise  make  available  such  lists  of  names and addresses to any other
 person for the purpose of allowing that person  to  use  such  lists  of
 names and addresses for solicitation or fund-raising purposes.
  (D)  If  [an agency determines to grant a request in whole or in part,
 and if] circumstances  prevent  AN  AGENCY  FROM  NOTIFYING  THE  PERSON
 REQUESTING THE RECORD OR RECORDS OF THE AGENCY'S DETERMINATION REGARDING
 THE  RIGHTS OF ACCESS AND disclosure to the person requesting the record
 or records within twenty business days from the date of the acknowledge-
 ment of the receipt of the request, the agency shall state, in  writing,
 both  the  reason  for the inability to [grant the request] DO SO within
 twenty business days and a date  certain  within  a  reasonable  period,
 depending  on  the  circumstances,  when [the request will be granted in
 whole or in part] A DETERMINATION REGARDING DISCLOSURE WILL BE RENDERED.
  (E) Upon payment of, or offer to pay, the fee prescribed therefor, the
 entity shall provide a copy of such record and certify to  the  correct-
 ness  of such copy if so requested, or as the case may be, shall certify
 that it does not have possession of such  record  or  that  such  record
 cannot be found after diligent search.
  (F)  Nothing  in this article shall be construed to require any entity
 to [prepare] CREATE any record not possessed or maintained by such enti-
 ty except the records specified in subdivision three of section  eighty-
 seven  and  subdivision  three  of section eighty-eight of this article.
 When an agency has the ability to retrieve or extract a record  or  data
 maintained in a computer storage system with reasonable effort, it shall
 be  required  to  do  so. When doing so requires less employee time than
 engaging in manual retrieval or redactions from non-electronic  records,
 the  agency shall be required to retrieve or extract such record or data
 electronically. [Any programming necessary to retrieve] THE RETRIEVAL OF
 a record maintained in a computer storage system and [to]  THE  transfer
 OF  that  record to the medium requested by a person or to A MEDIUM THAT
 WOULD allow the transferred record to be read or printed  shall  not  be
 deemed to be the [preparation or] creation of a new record.
  [(b)]  (G)  All  entities  shall,  provided such entity has reasonable
 means available, accept requests for records submitted in  the  form  of
 electronic  mail  and shall respond to such requests by electronic mail,
 using forms, to the extent practicable,  consistent  with  the  form  or
 forms developed by the committee on open government pursuant to subdivi-
 sion  one  of this section and provided that the written requests do not
 seek a response in some other form.
  [(c)] (H) Each state agency, as defined in subdivision  five  of  this
 section,  that maintains a website shall ensure its website provides for
 the online submission of a request for records pursuant to this article.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
