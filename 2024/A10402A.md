 required to disclose this use.
  (ii)  (1) For visual media the disclosure shall be printed or typed in

 language used on the communication to read  as  follows:  "This  (image,
 video, or audio) has been manipulated".
  (2)  For  communication  that  is auditory, such as radio or automated

  (1) materially deceptive media that constitutes satire or parody;

 THAT CAN BE EASILY READ OR HEARD BY THE AVERAGE LISTENER OR VIEWER, THAT
 THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE  MATERIALLY  DECEPTIVE
 MEDIA; or
  (3)  initial dissemination by a platform or service including, but not
 limited to, a website, regularly published newspaper, or magazine, where
 the content disseminated  is  materially  deceptive  media  provided  by
 another  information  content provider when a good faith effort has been
 made to establish that the depiction is not materially deceptive media.
  (iv) A candidate whose voice or likeness appears in materially  decep-
 tive  media  in  violation of this subdivision may seek reasonable court
 costs and attorneys' fees and injunctive relief prohibiting the distrib-
 ution, publication or broadcasting of any materially deceptive media  in
 violation  of  this  subdivision  against  such individual or entity who
 disseminated or published such media without the consent of  the  person
 depicted and who knew or should have known that it was materially decep-
 tive.  An  action  under  this paragraph shall be initiated by filing an
 application for an order to show cause in the supreme  court  where  the
 materially deceptive media at issue could deceive and influence electors
 in  an  upcoming election. Such action shall be entitled to an automatic
 calendar preference and be  subject  to  expedited  pretrial  and  trial
 proceedings.
  (v)  In any action alleging a violation of this subdivision in which a
 plaintiff seeks preliminary relief with respect to an upcoming election,
 the court shall grant relief if it determines that:
  (A) plaintiffs are more likely than not to succeed on the merits; and
  (B) it is possible to  implement  an  appropriate  remedy  that  would
 resolve the alleged violation in the upcoming election.
  (vi)  In  any  action  commenced under this subdivision, the plaintiff
 bears the burden of establishing the use of materially  deceptive  media
 by clear and convincing evidence.
  7.  NOTHING  IN  THIS  SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO REQUIRE BROADCAST
 SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CANCEL, EDIT, OR INSERT VIDEO OR AUDIO LABELS  INTO
 POLITICAL  COMMUNICATIONS WHERE SUCH ACTION IS INCONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL
 LAW.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
