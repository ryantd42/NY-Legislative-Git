 Introduced  by  Sen.  WEIK  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the penal law, in relation  to  the  unborn  victims  of
  violence act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1.  Legislative intent.  The legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  a  significant  loophole  exists  in  state law, denying
 protection to pregnant women and certain children.  Currently, an offen-
 der may not be held criminally responsible for  the  harm  caused  to  a
 child unless that child has first been born alive.  Therefore, an assai-
 lant who shoots a woman who is seven months pregnant, and kills both the
 woman and her child, may only be charged with the homicide of the mother
 since the infant is not considered a legal victim of the crime.
  New  York  state  policy lags behind most states in this area of crime
 victims' protection.  Thirty-one  states  now  provide  protection  and
 justice  for pregnant women and their unborn children who are victims of
 violence.
  The legislature further finds and  declares  that  current  statistics
 demonstrate  that  domestic  abuse  and violence against women increases
 during pregnancy.  It is estimated that one in five women will be abused
 during pregnancy.  A study in the Journal of the American Medical  Asso-
 ciation  found  that  in the state of Maryland, a pregnant woman is more
 likely to be a victim of a homicide than to  die  of  any  other  cause.
 Thus, rather than pregnancy being a peaceful time of preparation and the
 growth  of a healthy child, for many women it can be a time of violence,
 grief and loss.
  Compounding this tragedy is the loophole in current law, which  denies
 effective  protection  and  remedy  to women and their children.  When a
 woman makes a conscious choice to keep her baby and has the choice viol-
 ently taken away from her by a violent perpetrator, justice demands that

 someone be punished for that crime.  Indeed, mothers  will  bury  their
 baby's  body  and  mark  the grave for their child for the rest of their
 lives, but New York law tells them their loved one never existed.
  The  legislature  does not intend this act to apply to any abortion to
 which a woman has consented, to any act of the mother herself or to  any
 form of medical treatment.  The legislature finds that the current legal
 right  to abortion does not protect and does not confer on an assailant,
 a third-party unilateral right to destroy an unborn child.
  The legislature recognizes that a federal "unborn victims of violence"
 law was enacted in 2004, yet believes the law to be limited in  applying
 only to unborn children injured or killed during the course of specified
 federal crimes of violence.
  It  is  the  intent of the legislature that the affirmative right of a
 pregnant woman to carry her child to term be protected, and that  perpe-
 trators  of  crimes  against pregnant women and their unborn children be
 held accountable for their crimes.
  § 2. Short title.  This act shall be known as and may be cited as  the
