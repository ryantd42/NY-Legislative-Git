 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  KELLES,  THIELE, HUNTER, BRAUNSTEIN, COLTON,
  LUPARDO, L. ROSENTHAL -- read once and referred to  the  Committee  on
  Health
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the public health law, the environmental conservation
  law, the labor law and the education law, in relation to creating  the
  environmental health tracking system

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The public health law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 804 to read as follows:
  § 804. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TRACKING SYSTEM.  1. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS
 AND DECLARES ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:
  A.  THERE CURRENTLY EXIST SEVERAL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATABASES
 MAINTAINED BY THE STATE. HOWEVER, THERE IS  LITTLE  OR  NO  COORDINATION
 BETWEEN  THE  USE AND ANALYSIS OF THESE DATA AS THEY PERTAIN TO ENVIRON-
 MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, OR ACCESSIBILITY OF THIS INFORMATION BY INTERESTED
 PARTIES AND RESEARCHERS.  IN ITS FIGHT AGAINST CHRONIC DISEASES, INCLUD-
 ING BIRTH DEFECTS, THAT ARE RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT, THE  STATE  MUST
 GIVE  COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SOLID, RELIABLE INFOR-
 MATION, WHICH IS THE  MOST  BASIC  TOOL  WITH  WHICH  TO  UNDERTAKE  THE
 PREVENTION OF THESE DISEASES.
  B.  ANALYSIS  OF  AVAILABLE  DATA  USED  TO  TRACK AND MONITOR CHRONIC
 DISEASES IS CRITICAL TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:
  (1) KNOWING WHERE AND HOW TO PUT IN PLACE THE MOST  EFFECTIVE  STRATE-
 GIES TO PREVENT DISEASES;
  (2)  ASSESSING THE CONTRIBUTION OF DISEASES TO DISABILITIES AND PREMA-
 TURE MORTALITY;
  (3) MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PREVENTION STRATEGIES; AND
  (4) GENERATING HYPOTHESES THAT MAY LEAD TO  NEW  SCIENTIFIC  KNOWLEDGE
 ABOUT THE CAUSES OF, AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO FIGHT, CHRONIC DISEASES.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  C.  STATE  GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR CONSULTANTS ARE
 THE APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY INSTITUTIONS TO EXAMINE  WHETHER  OR  NOT,
 AND,  IF  SO,  THE  EXTENT  TO WHICH, PAST ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES MIGHT
 INCREASE THE RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASES, INCLUDING, BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO,
 BIRTH  DEFECTS,  DIABETES,  HEART DISEASE, THYROID DISEASE, REPRODUCTIVE
 DISORDERS, CANCER, ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS,  PARKINSON'S
 DISEASE,  ALZHEIMER'S  DISEASE,  AND  OTHER  NEUROLOGICALLY DEGENERATIVE
 DISEASES.
  D. THE INITIAL INVESTMENT TO ESTABLISH THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TRACK-
 ING SYSTEM, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS INFRASTRUCTURE TO  DEVELOP  PREVENTIVE
 STRATEGIES,  WOULD  CONSTITUTE  A  SMALL FRACTION OF THE ANNUAL COSTS OF
 CONTROLLING CHRONIC DISEASES IN THE STATE.
  E. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN CREATING  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL
 HEALTH TRACKING SYSTEM TO FORM A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO CREATE AN
 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND TRACKING SYSTEM TO DO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:

 TORING INFORMATION, INFORMATION ABOUT EXPOSURES TO  OTHER  ENVIRONMENTAL
 AGENTS,  DISEASE  TYPE  DATA  AND  OTHER DATA COLLECTED PURSUANT TO THIS

 DISEASE  CONTROL  INCLUDING  THOSE  IN  ITS NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC
 HEALTH TRACKING PROGRAM AND IN ITS BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS DATABASE,  IN
 ORDER  TO  ASSESS  THE  POTENTIAL  IMPACT  OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS
 (DEFINED AS PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS) ON THE  HUMAN  BODY
 AND TO EVALUATE SUCH IN RELATION TO ESTABLISHED DISEASE RISK FACTORS;
  (2)  ON  AN  ONGOING  BASIS,  TRACK  AND EVALUATE A VARIETY OF CHRONIC
 DISEASES IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, INCLUDING STATE,  LOCAL
 AND INTERNATIONAL DATA ON ACTUAL INCIDENCES OF CHRONIC DISEASE;
  (3) MAKE SUCH DATA AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN AN ACCESSIBLE AND USEFUL
 FORMAT; AND
  (4)  ULTIMATELY  PROVIDE SUCH DATA TO THE RELEVANT BOARD, DIVISION, OR
 OFFICE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL  CONSERVA-
 TION,  THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION BOARD, AND THE
