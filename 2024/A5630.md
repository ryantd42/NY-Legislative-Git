  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  modify  the in-service death benefit for retirement
 eligible members of the New York State and Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System  who  are  employed  by New York State as correction officers and
 security hospital treatment assistants.  The  in-service  death  benefit
 will be the value of the pension reserve as if the member had retired on
 their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $1.8 million in
 the annual contributions of the State of New York for  the  fiscal  year
 ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the bill-
 ing rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $10.6 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
  These estimated costs are based on 18,390 affected members employed by
 the State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $1.6  billion
 as of March 31, 2022.
  Summary of relevant resources:
