 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Gold Coast public library district
  to file with the county of Nassau assessor an application for a retro-
  active real property tax exemption
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the Gold Coast Public Library District an application for exemption from
 real property taxes pursuant to section 406 of the real property tax law
 for  the  2021-2022  and  2022-2023  assessment  rolls  for all of the
 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school taxes and all of the 2022 and 2023 gener-
 al taxes for the parcel conveyed to such  organization  located  at  180
 Glen  Head  Road,  hamlet  of  Glen  Head, town of Oyster Bay, county of
 Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county parcel ID section  21  block  Q
 lots  1,  70,  71,  1860 and 1861. If accepted, the application shall be
 reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxable status date
 established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  County  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
