 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  ZEBROWSKI  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Local Governments
 
 AN ACT to amend the town law and the tax law, in relation to the imposi-
  tion of an emergency telephone system  surcharge  for  service  within
  towns
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The town law is amended by adding a  new  article  10-A  to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 10-A
  ENHANCED EMERGENCY TELEPHONE SYSTEM SURCHARGE
 SECTION 160. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF INTENT.
  161. DEFINITIONS.
  162. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE.
  163. ESTABLISHMENT OF SURCHARGE FOR SYSTEM COSTS.
  164. APPLICATION; LIMITATIONS; EXEMPTIONS.
  165. COLLECTION OF SURCHARGE.
  166. LIABILITY FOR SURCHARGE.
  167. SYSTEM REVENUES; ADJUSTMENT OF SURCHARGE.
  168. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
  § 160. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF INTENT. THE LEGISLATURE
 RECOGNIZES THE PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF THE HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE OF
 THE  CITIZENS OF THE STATE AND FURTHER RECOGNIZES THAT WHEN THE LIVES OR
 PROPERTY OF ITS CITIZENS ARE IN IMMINENT DANGER THAT TIMELY  AND  APPRO-
 PRIATE  ASSISTANCE  MUST BE RENDERED. THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES FURTHER
 THAT SUCH ASSISTANCE IS ALMOST ALWAYS SUMMONED BY TELEPHONE AND  THAT  A
 MULTIPLICITY  OF  EMERGENCY  TELEPHONE NUMBERS EXIST WITHIN ANY ONE TOWN
 AND THAT UNINTENTIONAL, THOUGH AVOIDABLE, DELAYS IN REACHING APPROPRIATE
 EMERGENCY AID CAN AND DO OCCUR TO THE DETRIMENT AND JEOPARDY OF LIFE AND
 PROPERTY.
  THE LEGISLATURE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE THREE DIGIT NUMBER,  911,  IS  A
 NATIONALLY  RECOGNIZED AND APPLIED TELEPHONE NUMBER WHICH MAY BE USED TO
 SUMMON EMERGENCY AID AND TO ELIMINATE DELAYS CAUSED BY LACK OF FAMILIAR-
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 9832  2
 
 ITY WITH EMERGENCY NUMBERS AND BY UNDERSTANDABLE  CONFUSION  IN  CIRCUM-
 STANCES OF CRISIS.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FINDS  THAT THE ENHANCED EMERGENCY TELEPHONE SERVICE
 KNOWN AS E911 PROVIDES SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS  BEYOND  BASIC  911  SYSTEMS
 THROUGH  THE  PROVISION  OF  SELECTIVE  ROUTING AND AUTOMATIC NUMBER AND
 LOCATION IDENTIFICATION AND THAT THESE  ENHANCEMENTS  NOT  ONLY  SIGNIF-
 ICANTLY  REDUCE  THE RESPONSE TIME OF EMERGENCY SERVICES BUT ALSO REPRE-
 SENT THE STATE OF THE ART IN FAIL-SAFE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE SYSTEM  TECH-
 NOLOGY.
  THE  LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE ESTABLISH-
 MENT OF AN E911 SYSTEM IN THE VARIOUS TOWNS WITHIN THE STATE IS THE COST
 OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES WHICH ARE  NECESSARY  TO
 PROVIDE SUCH SYSTEM.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER FINDS AND DECLARES THAT, BY THE ENACTMENT OF
 THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE, IT IS THE INTENT OF THE  LEGISLATURE  TO
 FULFILL  ITS OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FOR THE HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE OF
 THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE BY PROVIDING TOWNS  WITHIN  THE  STATE  WITH  A
 FUNDING  MECHANISM TO ASSIST IN THE PAYMENT OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH
 ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN E911  SYSTEM  AND  THEREBY  CONSIDERABLY
 INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING ALL CITIZENS OF THIS STATE WITH THE
 VALUABLE SERVICES INHERENT IN AN E911 SYSTEM.

 COST REQUIREMENTS OF ITS E911 SYSTEM. THE BOARD MAY ALSO  BY  LOCAL  LAW
 REESTABLISH  OR  INCREASE  SUCH  SURCHARGE, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF

  3. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE SHALL REQUIRE THE IMPOSITION OF A
 SURCHARGE  BY A MUNICIPALITY WHICH HAS ESTABLISHED OR PLANS TO ESTABLISH
 AN E911 SYSTEM TO SERVE SUCH MUNICIPALITY NOR PRECLUDE  OTHER  MEANS  OF
 FUNDING  ALL  OR  PART  OF  AN  E911 SYSTEM NOR REQUIRE THE OPERATION OR
