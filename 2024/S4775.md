  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 360-m of the general business law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  507 of the laws of 2014, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. Any owner of a mark registered under this article  may  proceed  by
 suit to enjoin the manufacture, use, display or sale of any counterfeits
 or  imitations thereof and any court of competent jurisdiction may grant
 injunctions to restrain such manufacture, use, display or sale as may be
 by the said court deemed  just  and  reasonable,  and  may  require  the
 defendants  to  pay  to  such  owner all profits derived from and/or all
 damages suffered by reason of such wrongful manufacture, use, display or
 sale; and such court may  also  order  that  any  such  counterfeits  or
 imitations  in  the  possession or under the control of any defendant in
 such case be delivered to an officer of the court, or to  the  complain-
 ant, to be destroyed or donated. The court, in its discretion, may enter
 judgment  for  an  amount  [not  to exceed] three times such profits and
 damages and/or reasonable attorneys' fees of the  prevailing  party  [in
 such cases where the court finds the other party committed such wrongful
 acts  with  knowledge  or  in bad faith or otherwise as according to the
 circumstances of this case]. The enumeration  of  any  right  or  remedy
 herein  shall  not  affect  a  registrant's right to prosecute under the
 penal law.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
