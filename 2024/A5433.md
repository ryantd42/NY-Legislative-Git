 § 35.15 Justification; use of physical force in defense of a person.
  1. A person may, subject to the provisions of subdivision two OF  THIS
 SECTION,  use  physical force upon another person when and to the extent
 he or she reasonably believes such to be necessary  to  defend  himself,
 herself  or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be
 the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by such other person,
 unless:
  (a) The latter's conduct was provoked by  the  actor  with  intent  to
 cause physical injury to another person; or
  (b)  The actor was the initial aggressor; except that in such case the
 use of physical force is nevertheless justifiable if the actor has with-
 drawn from the encounter and effectively communicated such withdrawal to
 such other person but the latter persists in continuing the incident  by
 the use or threatened imminent use of unlawful physical force; or
  (c)  The  physical force involved is the product of a combat by agree-
 ment not specifically authorized by law.
  2. A person may not use deadly  physical  force  upon  another  person
 under circumstances specified in subdivision one OF THIS SECTION unless:
  (a)  The  actor reasonably believes that such other person is using or
 about to use deadly physical force. [Even in  such  case,  however,  the
 actor  may  not  use  deadly physical force if he or she knows that with

 officer or a peace officer at the latter's direction, acting pursuant to
