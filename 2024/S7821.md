 Introduced  by  Sen.  WEBER  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the public  authorities  law,  in  relation  to  certain
  construction work periods for the metropolitan transportation authori-
  ty;  and  providing  for the repeal of such provisions upon expiration
  thereof

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that the cost of
 design of public transit projects for  the  metropolitan  transportation
 authority  far  exceed national and global competitors. The metropolitan
 transportation authority's fiscal performance on recent  major  projects
 has severely limited further investment in maintaining, modernizing, and
 expanding transit service. It is imperative that public transit is oper-
 ated in a manner which delivers quality service to riders at an afforda-
 ble  cost.  While  it  is important to minimize service disruptions, the
 current process of stopping and starting  work  ends  up  extending  the
 period  of construction, and cost taxpayers millions in additional labor
 costs. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to direct that  the
 work  done  on  transit  projects  for  the  metropolitan transportation
 authority be done on a continual  basis  until  such  project  has  been
 completed.
  § 2. Section 1266-c of the public authorities law is amended by adding
 a new subdivision 16 to read as follows:
  16.  IN  THE  DESIGN,  CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE, OR RENOVATION OF ANY
 TRANSIT FACILITY, TRANSPORTATION FACILITY, OR EQUIPMENT AS DEFINED UNDER
 SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED OR TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE OF THIS CHAPTER, WORK
 SHALL TAKE PLACE OVER A CONTINUOUS PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL  SUCH  POINT  AT
 WHICH THE PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law and shall expire and be deemed repealed three
 years after such effective date.
