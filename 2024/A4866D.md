 AN ACT enacting the "just energy transition act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title.  This act shall be known and may be  cited  as
 the "just energy transition act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings and statement of purpose. The legislature
 hereby finds, determines and declares:
  (a) New York state, especially New York city,  is  reliant  on  fossil
 fuels  for energy production, making the transition to renewable sources
 for the downstate electricity system key to achieving  the  requirements
 of  section  4  of  the  New York state climate leadership and community
 protection act, including that seventy percent of the state's  electric-
 ity  be  from  renewable  energy  sources  by the year 2030 and that one
 hundred percent of the state's electricity be from zero-emission sources
 by the year 2040.
  (b) New York state is committed to  the  responsible  replacement  and
 redevelopment  of its fossil fueled generation facilities that currently
 ensure resource adequacy in the state, especially in locations where the
 health benefits to historically disadvantaged communities can  be  maxi-
 mized,  and  where the cost effective phasing-out of such facilities can
 be done while helping to ensure a just transition for the existing work-
 force.
  (c) A public policy purpose would be served and the interests  of  the
 people  of  the  state would be advanced by directing the New York state
 energy research and development  authority,  in  consultation  with  the

 department of public service and the department of environmental conser-
 vation,  to  continue the development of the study commenced in 2022, as
 referenced in the climate action council scoping plan of  strategies  to
 facilitate  the  replacement  and redevelopment of New York's oldest and
 most-polluting fossil fueled generation facilities and  their  sites  by
 2030, while ensuring resource adequacy, with renewable energy systems as
 defined  in paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 66-p of the public
 service law, energy storage systems, and  electricity  transmission  and
 distribution systems and equipment.
  (d)  It  is  the  intent  of  the  legislature in enacting this act to
 empower the New York state energy research  and  development  authority,
 department  of public service, and department of environmental conserva-
 tion, to develop a study as described  in  the  climate  action  council
 scoping  plan  and  paragraph  (c)  of  section three of this act in the
 manner authorized and directed herein, and for those  entities  and  the
 public  service commission, and any other agencies or authorities of the
 state as may be required, to commence any proceedings  or  other  initi-
 atives necessary to carry out the strategies described therein.
  §  3.  The New York state energy research and development authority is
 authorized and directed to:
  (a) develop a study of competitive options to  facilitate  the  phase-
 out,  replacement and redevelopment of New York state's oldest and most-
 polluting fossil fueled generation facilities and  their  sites  by  the
 year  2030,  with  renewable  generation  options  that  include  those
 described in the scoping plan issued by the climate action council under
 section 75-0103 of the environmental conservation law, renewable  energy
 systems  as defined in paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 66-p of
 the public service law, energy storage systems, and  electricity  trans-
 mission  and distribution systems and equipment, while ensuring resource
 adequacy and other reliability services are maintained, and to do so  in
 consultation  with  the  department of public service, the department of
 environmental conservation, Long Island power authority, and other rele-
 vant state agencies and authorities with subject matter  expertise,  the
 federally  designated  electric bulk system operator, the New York State
 Reliability Council, and the owners of such facilities. The study should
 prioritize the replacement  and  redevelopment  of  such  fossil  fueled
 generation  facilities  with  facilities  that  will  directly assist in
 achieving the energy, environmental  justice  and  emissions  reductions
 requirements  of section 66-p of the public service law. The study shall
 address the phase-out of at least four gigawatts of fossil fueled gener-
 ation statewide capacity in total and prioritize those  facilities  that
 only  operate when electricity usage is highest. The study shall include
 recommendations of standards and requirements that:
  (i) significantly reduce the state's electricity  system  reliance  on
 fossil  fuels,  taking  into  account the requirements and timing of the
 state's emission reduction programs;
  (ii) establish a competitive program to promote private sector invest-
 ment in eligible technologies that the  public  service  commission  has
 determined,  after  notice and provision for the opportunity to comment,
 ensure resource adequacy, while achieving the  requirements  of  section
 66-p of the public service law;
  (iii)  provide significant environmental, health and other benefits to
 disadvantaged communities as such  communities  will  be  defined  under
 section 75-0111 of the environmental conservation law; and
  (iv)  have  significant  potential  for  job  creation  and retention,
 economic development, and just transition opportunities  benefiting  New

 Yorkers  and  the  state's  workforce,  as described in the scoping plan
 issued by the climate action council under section 75-0103 of the  envi-
 ronmental conservation law; and
  (v)  ensure  the  availability of assistance under the electric gener-
 ation facility cessation mitigation fund established  in  section  1  of
 part BB of chapter 58 of the laws of 2016 to any local government entity
 impacted  by  the  replacement and redevelopment of fossil fueled gener-
 ation facilities under this section;
  (b) provide  public  notice  of  the  study, and ensure the results of
 the study are made easily accessible to members of disadvantaged  commu-
 nities,  as defined in section 75-0101 of the environmental conservation
 law, and provide an opportunity for public comment on the study  of  not
 less  than  sixty  days and conduct at least two  public hearings on the
 study, of which at least one shall be held in disadvantage  communities,
 as defined in section 75-0101 of the environmental conservation law with
 such public hearings offering  video participation and accessibility;
  (c)  address  public  comments  and  update the study, as appropriate,
 especially to ensure resource  adequacy  and  reliability  services  are
 maintained; and
  (d)  deliver  the  study  to  the governor, temporary president of the
 senate and speaker of the assembly within 180 days of the effective date
 of this section.
  § 4. The department of public service, the department of environmental
 conservation, and Long Island power authority shall commence proceedings
 and stakeholder processes to establish programs  and  other  initiatives
 necessary to carry out the strategies, programs, standards, and require-
 ments  described  in  the study referred to in section three of this act
 within 60 days of delivery of the study to the governor, temporary pres-
 ident of the senate and speaker of the assembly.

 dards, and requirements described in the study referred  to  in  section
 three  of this act within 90 days of delivery of the study to the gover-
 nor, temporary president of the senate and speaker of the assembly; and
  (b)  issue  an  order  regarding  implementation  of  the  strategies,
 programs, standards, and requirements described in the study referred to
 in  section  three  of  this act no later than July 30, 2024. Such order
 shall at a minimum:
  (i) direct the New York state energy research and development authori-
 ty to implement a competitive award process to facilitate  the  replace-
 ment  and  redevelopment  of  at  least  four gigawatts of fossil fueled
 generation facilities statewide while maintaining reliability consistent
 with the recommendations of the study pursuant to section three of  this
 act,  and  that as part of such competitive award process, consideration
 shall be given to security of offtake with  respect  to  generation  and
 transmission; and
  (ii)  direct  that  with  respect  to  the  competitive  award process
