 AN  ACT relating to the development of a blueprint to guide the replace-
  ment and redevelopment of New York's oldest and most-polluting  fossil
  fuel facilities and their sites by 2031

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title.  This act shall be known and may be  cited  as
 the  "fossil  fuel  facilities  replacement  and redevelopment blueprint
 act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and statement of  purpose.  The  legislature
 hereby finds, determines and declares:
  (a)  New  York  state,  especially New York city, is reliant on fossil
 fuels for energy production, making the transition to renewable  sources
 for  the  downstate electricity system key to achieving the requirements
 of section 4 of the New York  state  climate  leadership  and  community
 protection  act, including that seventy percent of the state's electric-
 ity be from renewable energy sources by  the  year  2031  and  that  one
 hundred percent of the state's electricity be from zero-emission sources
 by  the year 2041. A particular challenge is the reliance on fossil fuel
 generation facilities that only operate when  electricity  demand  peaks
 above the average usage.
  (b)  New  York  state  is committed to the responsible replacement and
 redevelopment of its fossil fuel  power  plants  that  currently  ensure
 resource adequacy in the state, especially in locations where the health
 benefits to historically disadvantaged communities can be maximized, and
 where  the  cost  effective  phasing-out  of such facilities can be done
 while helping to ensure a just transition for the existing workforce.
  (c) A public policy purpose would be served and the interests  of  the
 people  of  the  state would be advanced by directing the New York state
 energy research and development  authority,  in  consultation  with  the

 department  of  public service and department of environmental conserva-
 tion, to develop a study of strategies to facilitate the replacement and
 redevelopment of New York's oldest and most-polluting fossil fuel facil-
 ities  and  their  sites by 2031, while ensuring resource adequacy, with
 renewable energy systems as defined in paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of
 section 66-p of the public service  law,  energy  storage  systems,  and
 electricity transmission and distribution systems and equipment.
  (d)  It  is  the  intent  of  the  legislature in enacting this act to
 empower the New York state energy research  and  development  authority,
 department  of public service, and department of environmental conserva-
 tion, to develop a study as described  in  subdivision  (a)  of  section
 three of this act, and for those entities and the public service commis-
 sion,  and  any  other  agencies  or  authorities of the state as may be
 required, to commence any proceedings or other initiatives necessary  to
 carry out the strategies described therein.
  §  3.  The New York state energy research and development authority is
 authorized and directed to:
  (a) develop a study of competitive options  to  facilitate  the  phase
 out,  replacement and redevelopment of New York state's oldest and most-
 polluting fossil fuel facilities and their sites by the year 2031,  with
 renewable energy systems as defined in paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of
 section  66-p  of  the  public  service law, energy storage systems, and
 electricity transmission and distribution systems and  equipment,  while
 ensuring  resource  adequacy  and  other  reliability services are main-
 tained, and to do so in  consultation  with  the  department  of  public
 service,  department  of  environmental  conservation, Long Island power
 authority, and  other  relevant  state  agencies  and  authorities  with
 subject  matter expertise, the federally designated electric bulk system
 operator, the New York State Reliability Council, and the owners of such
 facilities. The study should prioritize the replacement  and  redevelop-
 ment  of  such fossil fuel facilities with facilities that will directly
 assist in achieving the  energy,  environmental  justice  and  emissions
 reductions  requirements  of section 66-p of the public service law. The
 study shall include recommendations of standards and requirements that:
  (i) would significantly reduce the state's electricity system reliance
 on fossil fuels, taking into account the requirements and timing of  the
 state's emission reduction programs;
  (ii)  would  establish a competitive program to promote private sector
 investment in eligible technologies that the public  service  commission
 has  determined,  after  notice  and  provision for the opportunity to
 comment, ensure resource adequacy, while achieving the  requirements  of
 section 66-p of the public service law;
  (iii)  would provide significant environmental, health and other bene-
 fits to disadvantaged communities as such communities  will  be  defined
 under section 75-0111 of the environmental conservation law; and
  (iv)  would have significant potential for job creation and retention,
 economic development, and just transition opportunities  benefiting  New
 Yorkers and the state's workforce;
  (b)  provide  public  notice  of  the  study and an opportunity for
 public comment on the study of not less than sixty days and  conduct  at
 least  two  public  hearings  on  the study, with such public hearings
 offering  video participation and accessibility;
  (c) address public comments and  update  the  study,  as  appropriate,
 especially  to  ensure  resource  adequacy  and reliability services are
 maintained; and

  (d) deliver the study to the  governor,  temporary  president  of  the
 senate and speaker of the assembly within 180 days of the effective date
 of this section.
  §  4.  The  department  of public service, department of environmental
 conservation,  and  Long  Island  power  authority  are  authorized  and
 directed  to commence proceedings and stakeholder processes to establish
 programs and other initiatives necessary to carry  out  the  strategies,
 programs, standards, and requirements described in the study referred to

 nor, temporary president of the senate and speaker of the assembly; and,
  (b)  issue  an  order  regarding  implementation  of  the  strategies,
 programs, standards, and requirements described in the study referred to
 in section three of this act, including but not limited to  any  compet-
 itive procurement processes, no later than July 30, 2024.

 establish a program in its service territory consistent with the author-
 ization and direction of the public service commission in  section  five
 of this act, and the objectives of this act.
