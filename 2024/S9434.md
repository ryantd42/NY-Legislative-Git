 Introduced  by Sen. HOYLMAN-SIGAL -- read twice and ordered printed, and
  when printed to be committed to the Committee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the real property law, in relation  to  prohibiting  the
  use  of  an algorithmic device by a landlord for the purpose of deter-
  mining the amount of rent to charge a residential tenant

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative declaration. The legislature finds that the use
 of algorithmic devices has been the subject of lawsuits that allege such
 products  pose  a  heightened  risk  of  anticompetitive  conduct, price
 fixing, and collusion, all of which allegedly result in higher rents for
 residential tenants, and allegedly poses the risk  that  landlords  will
 outsource  pricing  decisions,  which  the legislature determines should
 always be made by the landlord.
  Therefore, the legislature declares that, with certain exceptions, the
 use of an algorithmic device by a landlord to set the amount of a  resi-
 dential tenant's rent is prohibited.
  § 2. The real property law is amended by adding a new section 222-a to
 read as follows:
  § 222-A. DETERMINATION OF RENT AMOUNT; USE OF AN ALGORITHMIC DEVICE IN
 SETTING  RENT  AMOUNT PROHIBITED. 1. IN SETTING THE AMOUNT OF RENT TO BE
 CHARGED TO A TENANT FOR THE OCCUPANCY OF A RESIDENTIAL PREMISES, INCLUD-
 ING DETERMINING ANY CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF RENT TO BE CHARGED  FOR  THE
 RENEWED  OCCUPANCY  OF  A  RESIDENTIAL  PREMISES,  A  LANDLORD SHALL NOT
 EMPLOY, USE, OR RELY UPON, OR CAUSE ANOTHER PERSON TO  EMPLOY,  USE,  OR
 RELY UPON, AN ALGORITHMIC DEVICE THAT USES, INCORPORATES, OR WAS TRAINED
 WITH NONPUBLIC COMPETITOR DATA.
  2.  A  VIOLATION OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION IS A DECEPTIVE ACT
 OR PRACTICE AS PROVIDED IN  SECTION  THREE  HUNDRED  FORTY-NINE  OF  THE
 GENERAL BUSINESS LAW, AND A PERSON WHO COMMITS A VIOLATION IS SUBJECT TO
 ALL  PENALTIES  AND  REMEDIES  DESCRIBED  IN ARTICLE TWENTY-TWO-A OF THE
 GENERAL BUSINESS LAW.
  3. AS USED IN THIS SECTION:

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
