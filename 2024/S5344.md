  (e) "Feedstock" shall mean soybean oil, oil from annual  cover  crops,
 algal  oil, biogenic waste oils, fats or greases, or non-food grade corn
 oil, provided that the commissioner may, by rules and regulations, modi-
 fy the definition of feedstock based on the vegetable oils, animal  fats
 or cellulosic biomass listed in table 1 of 40 C.F.R. § 80.1426.
  (2)  On  and  after July first, two thousand eighteen, all heating oil
 sold for use in any building within the counties of Nassau, Suffolk  and
 Westchester shall be bioheating fuel that contains at least five percent
 biodiesel AND/OR RENEWABLE HYDROCARBON DIESEL.
  (3)  On  or after July first, two thousand twenty-two, all heating oil
 sold for use in any building within the state shall be  bioheating  fuel
 that contains at least five percent biodiesel AND/OR RENEWABLE HYDROCAR-
 BON DIESEL.
  (4)  On or after July first, two thousand twenty-five, all heating oil
 sold for use in any building within the state shall be  bioheating  fuel
 that  contains at least ten percent biodiesel AND/OR RENEWABLE HYDROCAR-
 BON DIESEL.
  (5) On or after July first, two thousand thirty, all heating oil  sold
 for  use  in any building within the state shall be bioheating fuel that
 contains at least twenty percent biodiesel AND/OR RENEWABLE  HYDROCARBON
 DIESEL.
  (6) ON OR AFTER JULY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND THIRTY-SEVEN, ALL HEATING OIL
 SOLD  FOR  USE IN ANY BUILDING WITHIN THE STATE SHALL BE BIOHEATING FUEL
 THAT CONTAINS AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT BIODIESEL AND/OR  RENEWABLE  HYDRO-
 CARBON DIESEL.
  (7)  The  minimum content requirements of this section shall not apply
 to kerosene.
  [(7)] (8) The governor may, by issuing an executive order, temporarily
 suspend the applicability of this section  at  any  time  based  on  the
 governor's determination, after consulting with the New York state ener-
 gy  research  and development authority and the department, that meeting
 the requirement of subdivision two of this section is not  feasible  due
 to  lack of adequate supply of biodiesel or that meeting the requirement
 would result in financial hardship to consumers.
  [(8)] (9) The requirements of this section shall not: (a) prohibit the
 sale and use of bioheating fuel with the same or any greater  percentage
 of  biodiesel  blended  with  heating  oil,  or  the sale and use of one
 hundred percent biodiesel, for space and/or water  heating  purposes  in
 the state; and (b) preempt any laws of the city of New York with respect
 to  mandated  percentage  levels  of  biodiesel  blends with heating oil
 provided that such laws require the same or greater percentage of  biod-
 iesel blended with heating oil as required by this section.
  [(9)]  (10)  No bioheating fuel shall be sold to a customer that would
 void the manufacturer's warranty for that burner or boiler  type  unless
 the  bioheat provider warranties in writing to the customer that the use
 of such bioheating fuel will be covered to the extent and time limits of
 the warranty then covering such burner or boiler.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
