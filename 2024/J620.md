  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as School Library Month in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside to increase awareness of  initiatives
which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 2023, as School
Library Month in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National School Library Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  School  Library Month was established by Lucille
Thomas in 1985, to help schools and their  local  communities  celebrate
the  library  and  in  particular the major role school library programs
play in transforming learning; and
 
  WHEREAS, The quest for knowledge  and  achievement  by  students  is
stimulated  and  developed  through the use of educational resources and
instruction provided by school library  programs  that  are  staffed  by
professional certified school librarians; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  library programs provide the means for students to
gain cultural understanding and enhance global communication skills; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lifelong learning begins and  is  systematically  developed
through  the  school  library curriculum of the elementary and secondary
schools; and
 
  WHEREAS, The school library program contributes  to  the  individual
growth  and development of all students, while fostering both excellence
and equity in education; and
 
  WHEREAS, School library programs teach  the  skills  of  effectively
locating  and  ethically using information through traditional resources
and new technologies to provide literature appreciation  activities  and
to  guide  and encourage informational and recreational reading to every
student; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  libraries  provide  materials  that  will  develop
literary, cultural, aesthetic appreciation, and ethical standards; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  school  library  program helps students learn to find
texts on any topic of interest across a range of complexity, so they are
engaged at a level that is challenging to them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  librarians  teach  students  to  inquire,  think
critically,  draw  conclusions,  make informed decisions, and create and
share knowledge in preparation for advanced study and the workplace; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is both fitting and proper that special  recognition  be
given  to  school  library  programs  and  the  role of certified school
librarians  in  education  throughout  the  State  of  New  York;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  2023,  as  School
Library Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
