  HONORING  Firefighter Reed Clair upon the occasion
  of his designation for special recognition after  50
  years  of  dedicated  service  to the Oriskany Falls
  Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
Reed  Clair upon the occasion of his designation for special recognition
after  50  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the  Oriskany  Falls  Fire
Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Reed  Clair  has  consistently  demonstrated  a  level  of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Oriskany Falls Fire Department proudly serves the Town
of Augusta, Village of Oriskany Falls, and its neighboring  communities;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighters  such  as  Reed  Clair unwaveringly serve our
great State with pride, valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers
are often the first to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is
a fire, transportation accident, natural  disaster,  act  of  terrorism,
medical crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Reed Clair is  such  a  firefighter;  throughout  50  years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Firefighter Reed Clair upon the occasion of  his  designation  for
special  recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to the Oriskany
Falls Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Firefighter Reed Clair.
