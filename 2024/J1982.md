BY: Senator THOMAS
 
  CONGRATULATING  Dr.  Deborah  L.  Wortham upon the
  occasion of receiving the  Superintendent  Award  at
  the  National Conference of the American Association
  of School Administrators
 
  WHEREAS, It is the practice of this Legislative Body to take note of
and  publicly  acknowledge  individuals  of  remarkable  integrity  and
character  whose endeavors have enhanced the quality of education in the
great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
congratulate Dr. Deborah L. Wortham upon the occasion of  receiving  the
Superintendent  Award  at  the  National  Conference  of  the  American
Association of School Administrators  (AASA)  which  was  held  February
15-17, 2024, in San Diego, California; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  AASA School Superintendent's Association is comprised
of more than 13,000 educational leaders across the globe; its mission is
to support and develop effective school system leaders who are dedicated
to equitable access to the highest  quality  public  education  for  all
students; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Conference  on Education is regarded as the
most comprehensive professional learning and networking event for school
superintendents and administrators;  about  3,000  superintendents  come
together  to  form  connections,  share  ideas,  and hear from education
thought leaders on improving student outcomes and district  performance;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  Deborah  L.  Wortham  was awarded the highest honor a
superintendent can receive  at  the  2024  Women  in  School  Leadership
Awards,  hosted  by  the  American  Association of School Administrators
(AASA) School Superintendent's Association; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr. Deborah L. Wortham,  superintendent  of  the  Roosevelt
Union  Free  School District in Long Island, New York, was awarded based
on her creativity in successfully meeting the  needs  of  her  Roosevelt
students,  strength  in  both personal and organizational communication,
consistent improvement  of  administrative  knowledge  and  skills,  the
professional development opportunities she affords to her staff, and her
active participation in the Roosevelt community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2020,  Dr.  Deborah L. Wortham began her second tenure
with the  Roosevelt  School  District  and  worked  with  the  Board  of
Education and a team of about 100 staff, students, and community members
to  create  a five-year strategic plan to improve students' performance;
and
 
  WHEREAS, These efforts proved a great success with Roosevelt  Middle
School  and  Roosevelt  High  School  being  removed  from  the  State's
needs-improvement list- a direct result  of  the  superintendent's  able
 
leadership,  ultimately  ranking  all  five  Roosevelt  schools  in good
standing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  State  assessment  performance increased over the past two
years, and graduation rates rose from 70  percent  in  2018-2019  to  86
percent in 2021-2022; furthermore, the 2023 graduating class earned $4.8
million  in scholarships, a 23 percent increase from the total earned by
the 2022 graduating class, all of which have justly earned  Dr.  Deborah
L. Wortham this esteemed award and distinction; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  Deborah L. Wortham has clearly had an enduring impact
on the youth of the Roosevelt Union Free School District, as well as  on
the community and State at large, and accordingly merits recognition and
applause for her impressive dedication to others; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Dr. Deborah L. Wortham upon the occasion of  receiving  the
Superintendent  Award  at  the  National  Conference  of  the  American
Association of School Administrators; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Dr. Deborah L. Wortham.
