 Introduced by M. of A. K. BROWN -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law and the retirement and social security
  law,  in  relation  to increasing the required number of instructional
  days in a school year to two hundred
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Section 551 of the education law, as added by chapter 414
 of the laws of 1972, is amended to read as follows:
  § 551. Apportionment. 1. In order to meet proper health,  welfare  and
 safety  standards  in  qualifying  schools for the benefit of the pupils
 enrolled therein, there shall be apportioned health, welfare and  safety
 grants  by  the  commissioner  to  each qualifying school for the school
 years beginning on and after July first, nineteen  hundred  seventy-one,
 an amount equal to the product of thirty dollars multiplied by the aver-
 age  daily attendance of pupils receiving instruction in such school, to
 be applied for costs of maintenance and repair. Such apportionment shall
 be increased by ten dollars multiplied by the average  daily  attendance
 of  pupils  receiving instruction in a school building constructed prior
 to nineteen hundred forty-seven. In no event shall the per pupil  annual
 allowance  computed  under  this  section exceed fifty per centum of the
 average per pupil cost of  equivalent  maintenance  and  repair  in  the
 public  schools of the state on a state-wide basis, as determined by the
 commissioner, and in no event shall the apportionment  to  a  qualifying
 school  exceed  the amount of expenditures for maintenance and repair of
 such school as reported pursuant to section five  hundred  fifty-two  of
 this article.
  2.  The apportionment pursuant to this section shall be reduced by one
 [one hundred eightieth] TWO  HUNDREDTH  for  each  day  less  than  [one
 hundred  eighty] TWO HUNDRED days that such school was actually in total
 session in the base year, except that  the  commissioner  may  disregard
 such  reduction  up  to five days if he finds that the school was not in
 session for [one hundred eighty] TWO HUNDRED days  because  of  extraor-
 dinary  adverse  weather  conditions,  impairment of heating facilities,

 insufficiency of water supply, shortage of fuel or the destruction of  a
 school  building, and if the commissioner further finds that such school
 cannot make up such days of instruction during the school year. No  such
 reduction  shall  be made, however, for any day on which such school was
 in session for the purpose of administering the regents examinations  or
 the  regents  scholarship  examinations, or any day, not to exceed three
 days, when such school was not in session because  of  a  conference  of
 teachers called by the principal of the school.
  § 2. Subdivision 2 of section 1704 of the education law, as amended by
 chapter 543 of the laws of 1971, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by  law, no board of education or
 community board in the city school district of  the  city  of  New  York
 shall  provide  for  a school year consisting of fewer than [one hundred
 eighty] TWO HUNDRED days of school.
  § 3. Paragraph a of subdivision 4 of section  3204  of  the  education
 law,  as  amended  by  section  7 of part A of chapter 56 of the laws of
 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  a. A full time day school or class, except  as  otherwise  prescribed,
 shall  be  in session for not less than [one hundred eighty] TWO HUNDRED
 days each year, exclusive of legal holidays that occur during  the  term
 of said school and exclusive of Saturdays.
  §  4.  Paragraph  m  of  subdivision  12 and subdivision 16 of section
 3602-e of the education law, paragraph m of subdivision 12 as amended by
 section 19 of part B of chapter 57 of the laws of 2007  and  subdivision
 16 as amended by section 18 of part A of chapter 57 of the laws of 2013,
 are amended to read as follows:
  m.  a  process  for  the  waiver  of the time requirements established
 pursuant to this subdivision in order to authorize the  operation  of  a
 summer  universal  prekindergarten program limited to the months of July
 and August, upon a finding by the commissioner that the school  district
 is  unable  to  operate  the  program  during the regular school session
 because of a lack of available space  pursuant  to  regulations  of  the
 commissioner. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the
 contrary,  such  process  shall  provide  for a reduction of the aid per
 prekindergarten pupil payable for pupils served pursuant to such  waiver
 by  one  [one-hundred eightieth] TWO HUNDREDTH of the aid per prekinder-
 garten pupil determined pursuant to paragraph a of subdivision  ten  [or
 subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph b of subdivision ten-a] of this section
 for each day less than [one hundred eighty] TWO HUNDRED  days  that  the
 summer program is in session.
  16. The grant payable to a school district pursuant to this section in
 the  current  year  shall  be reduced by [one one-hundred eightieth] TWO
 HUNDREDTH for each day less than [one hundred eighty] TWO  HUNDRED  days
 that the universal prekindergarten classes of the district were actually
 in  session,  except  that the commissioner may disregard such reduction
 for any deficiency that may be disregarded in computing total foundation
 aid pursuant to subdivision seven or eight of section thirty-six hundred
 four of this [chapter] PART and in addition may  disregard  a  reduction
 for  any  deficiency  that is caused by a delay in the opening of public
 school classes due to  extraordinarily  adverse  weather  conditions  or
 other  cause  cited  in  such  subdivision  seven  of section thirty-six
 hundred four that results in cancellation of the prekindergarten program
 or of transportation to such program.
  § 5. Subdivisions 7 and 8 of section 3604 of the education law, subdi-
 vision 7 as amended by chapter 107 of the laws of 2020 and subdivision 8
 A. 9101  3
 
 as amended by chapter 359 of the laws of 2023, are amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  7.  No district shall be entitled to any portion of such school moneys
 on such apportionment unless the report of  the  trustees  or  board  of
 education  for  the  preceding  school  year  shall show that the public
 schools were actually in session in the district and taught by a  quali-
 fied  teacher or by successive qualified teachers or by qualified teach-
 ers for not less than [one hundred eighty] TWO HUNDRED days. The  moneys
 payable  to  a  school  district  pursuant to section thirty-six hundred
 nine-a of this part in the current year shall be reduced  by  one  [one-
 hundred  eightieth] TWO HUNDREDTH of the district's total foundation aid
 for the base year for each  day  less  than  [one  hundred  eighty]  TWO
 HUNDRED  days that the schools of the district were actually in session,
 except that the commissioner may disregard such reduction in the  appor-
 tionment  of  public money: (i) for any day or days on which session had
 been previously scheduled but the superintendent was required  to  close
 the  school or schools due to a properly executed declaration of a state
 or local state of emergency pursuant to article two-B of  the  executive
 law;  or (ii) for up to five days if he or she finds that the schools of
 the district were not in session for [one hundred  eighty]  TWO  HUNDRED
 days  because  of extraordinarily adverse weather conditions, impairment
 of heating facilities, insufficiency of water supply, shortage of  fuel,
 lack  of electricity, natural gas leakage, unacceptable levels of chemi-
 cal substances, a credible threat to student safety as reasonably deter-
 mined by a lead school official or the destruction of a school  building
 either in whole or in part, and if, further, the commissioner finds that
 such  district  cannot make up such days of instruction by using for the
 secondary grades all scheduled vacation days which occur  prior  to  the
 first  scheduled regents examination day in June, and for the elementary
 grades all scheduled vacation days which occur prior to the last  sched-
 uled  regents  examination  day in June; or (iii) for any day or days in
 the two thousand nineteen -- two thousand twenty school  year  on  which
 session  had  been  previously  scheduled but the chancellor of the city
 school district of the city of New  York  or  the  superintendent  of  a
 district  closed  the  school  or  schools due to a determination by the
 chancellor or superintendent that it was in the best interest of  public
 health  or  safety of the school district to close the school or schools
 in response to the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. For the purposes of this
 subdivision, "scheduled vacation days" shall  mean  days  on  which  the
 schools  of the district are not in session and for which no prohibition
 exists in subdivision eight of this section for them to be in session.
  8. No school shall be in session on a Saturday, the first day  of  the
 second  lunar  month after the winter solstice in the preceding calendar
 year known as Asian Lunar New Year, or a legal holiday,  except  general
 election  day,  Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday, and except
 that driver education classes may be conducted on a  Saturday.  A  defi-
 ciency  not  exceeding four days during any school year caused by teach-
 ers' attendance upon conferences held by superintendents of  schools  of
 city  school  districts  or other school districts employing superinten-
 dents of schools shall be excused by the  commissioner,  notwithstanding
 any  provision  of  law,  rule  or  regulation to the contrary, a school
 district may elect to schedule such conference days in the [last]  FIRST
 two  weeks  of  August,  subject  to  collective bargaining requirements
 pursuant to article fourteen of the civil service  law,  and  such  days
 shall  be  counted towards the required [one hundred eighty] TWO HUNDRED
 days of session, provided however, that such scheduling shall not  alter
 A. 9101  4
 
 the  obligation  of  the  school  district  to provide transportation to
 students in non-public  elementary  and  secondary  schools  or  charter
 schools. At least two such conference days during such school year shall
 be dedicated to staff attendance upon conferences providing staff devel-
 opment relating to implementation of the new high learning standards and
 assessments,  as  adopted  by the board of regents.  Notwithstanding any
 other provision of law, rule  or  regulation  to  the  contrary,  school
 districts may elect to use one or more of such allowable conference days
 in  units  of  not  less than one hour each to provide staff development
 activities relating to implementation of the new high learning standards
 and assessments. A district making such election may provide such  staff
 development  on any day during which sessions are allowed and apply such
 units to satisfy a deficiency  in  the  length  of  one  or  more  daily
 sessions  of  instruction  for pupils as specified in regulations of the
 commissioner. The commissioner shall assure that  such  conference  days
 include  appropriate  school violence prevention and intervention train-
 ing, and may require that up to one such conference day be dedicated for
 such purpose.
  § 6. Subdivision 2-a of section 3635 of the education law, as  amended
 by chapter 359 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  2-a. The superintendent of each city school district, in a city having
 a  population  in  excess  of one million, shall prepare a public school
 calendar and shall notify officials of nonpublic schools to which trans-
 portation has been requested not later than the first  day  of  June  in
 each year, of the days on which the public schools will be in session in
 the following school year. Such school district which provides transpor-
 tation  to  nonpublic  schools shall provide such transportation for the
 same number of days as the public schools are open but shall not provide
 transportation services for more than [one hundred eighty]  TWO  HUNDRED
 days.  Officials  of  each nonpublic school to which transportation is
 provided by a city school district of a  city  having  a  population  in
 excess of one million may notify such district, not later than the first
 day of July of each school year, of a maximum of five days, exclusive of
 Saturdays,  Sundays  or  legal  holidays  upon  which public schools are
 required to be closed, on which the public schools are scheduled  to  be
 closed,  except that in any year in which the first or last day of Pass-
 over and Easter Sunday are separated by more than seven days, such offi-
 cials may notify the district of a maximum of ten days, but such  school
 district  will be required to provide for transportation to such nonpub-
 lic school provided that such five or ten additional days, whichever  is
 applicable, are limited to the following: the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs-
 day  and  Friday after Labor Day, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, the week in
