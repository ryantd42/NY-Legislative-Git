  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of the safety and
protection of our journalists; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  Thursday,  February  23,
2023,  as  Student  Press  Freedom  Day  in  the  State  of New York, in
conjunction with the observance of National Student Press  Freedom  Day;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 2018 by the Student Press Law Center to mark
the  30th  anniversary  of the Kuhlmeier decision, Student Press Freedom
Day is an occasion to celebrate the  field  of  student  journalism  and
advocate for freedom of speech, and liberty from censorship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Observed annually, Student Press Freedom Day is a national
day of action when  student  journalists  in  the  United  States  raise
awareness  of the challenges they face, celebrate their contributions to
their schools and communities, and take actions to protect  and  restore
their First Amendment freedoms; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  Thursday,  February  23,  2023,  the Student Press Law
Center is holding a day of action, with this year's theme  being,  "Bold
Journalism & Brave Advocacy"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Student  Press  Law  Center  will  host  and  promote
trainings and community building  opportunities  that  are  designed  to
uplift  student  journalists'  voices  and  prepare them to advocate for
press freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, The integrity of journalism is derived  from  the  Code  of
Ethics as determined by the Society of Professional Journalists; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Student  reporters are the next generation of journalists;
it is a difficult time for journalists as media across the  country  has
come  under  attack;  recognizing  the importance of the profession will
support journalistic integrity and independence which  is  needed  in  a
democratic society; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  February  23,  2023,  as
Student Press Freedom Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  the Student Press Law Center; and New Voices of New York chapters
throughout the State of New York.
