  COMMENDING  FACE  Africa  upon  the  occasion  of
  hosting its Annual WASH Gala, a Clean Water Benefit,
  on March 25, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to call attention
to those events which serve  to  enhance  the  cultural  enrichment  and
preserve the heritage of Africa; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend FACE Africa upon the occasion of hosting its Annual WASH Gala, a
Clean  Water  Benefit,  on  Saturday,  March 25, 2023, at Current in New
York, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The FACE  Africa  WASH  Gala  is  held  annually  to  raise
awareness  and  funds  for  clean  water  projects  for  marginalized
communities in remote regions  of  Sub-Saharan  Africa;  it  is  also  a
celebration  of  Africans  and  Friends of Africa making a difference in
their respective industries and communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, FACE Africa was established after the  Liberian  civil  war
that  took  the  lives  of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced
millions; the country suffered massive destruction and the  very  fabric
of society was torn apart; and
 
  WHEREAS, With an 80% unemployment rate, extreme poverty with average
earnings of $1 a day, no electricity, no running water or sewage system,
and an inadequate education system, the country had enormous needs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  the  young  age of eight, Saran Kaba Jones and her own
family were forced to flee the devastation; in 2008, she returned to her
homeland and  was  deeply  distressed  by  the  acute  poverty  and  the
debilitating effect it had on the young, elderly, weak and strong; and
 
  WHEREAS, Saran Kaba Jones and other volunteers formed FACE Africa to
help  the  people of Liberia to reclaim the means to build a better life
and proper; they discovered one of the major  impediments  to  education
was  the  lack  of access to safe drinking water; it was estimated there
would be 272 million more school attendance days per  year  if  adequate
investment were made in drinking water and sanitation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  Africa alone, people spend over 40 billion hours every
year,  walking  for  water;  poverty  is  directly  related  to  the
accessibility  of  clean  drinking  water,  without  it,  the chances of
breaking out of the poverty trap are extremely slim; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  social  and  economic  consequences  of  unsafe  water
penetrate  into  realms  of  education,  opportunities  for  gainful
employment, physical strength and health,  agricultural  and  industrial
development,  and  thus the overall productive potential of a community,
nation, and/or region; the United Nations estimates  Sub-Saharan  Africa
alone  loses  40 billion potential work hours per year collecting water;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS, Team FACE Africa is part of a generation that shares a deep
commitment  to  creating  an  equitable  and  sustainable world in which
everyone has access to opportunity and basic human needs; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend FACE Africa upon the occasion of hosting its Annual WASH Gala, a
Clean Water Benefit, on March 25, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to FACE Africa.
