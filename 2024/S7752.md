  1. Recipient qualifications. Tuition  assistance  program  awards  are
 available for all students who are enrolled in approved programs and who
 demonstrate  the  ability  to  complete such courses, in accordance with
 standards established by the commissioner  provided,  however,  that  no
 award  shall be made unless tuition (exclusive of educational fees) and,
 if applicable, the college fee levied by the  state  university  of  New
 York  pursuant to the April first, nineteen hundred sixty-four financing
 agreements with the New York state dormitory authority charged  for  the
 program  in  which  the  student  is enrolled total at least two hundred
 dollars a year, [and provided further that,] no  award  can  exceed  one
 hundred percent of the amount of tuition charged; AND PROVIDED, FURTHER,
 THAT  NO  TUITION  ASSISTANCE AWARD SHALL BE PROVIDED TO ANY STUDENT, IN

  1.  Legislative  intent.  The legislature hereby finds that to further
 the goal of equal opportunity it is necessary to assure the availability
 of supplemental assistance for  the  successful  remediation  of  educa-
 tionally  disadvantaged  students  in  addition  to assistance currently
 available under existing  statute  for  students  with  financial  need.
 Accordingly, tuition assistance shall be extended to students whose need
 for  remediation  precludes them from fulfilling the program pursuit and
 academic progress requirements of the tuition  assistance  program;  AND
 PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  THAT NO SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION ASSISTANCE AWARD SHALL
 BE PROVIDED TO ANY STUDENT, IN ANY  ACADEMIC  YEAR,  WHO  HAS  KNOWINGLY
 ENGAGED IN PROMOTING ANTISEMITISM IN A MANNER THAT IS DIRECTED TO INCIT-

 credit  by  the  state  university of New York or city university of New
 York upon matriculation into  a  degree  program  at  such  institution,
 provided  that  such  credit  shall be equal to the corresponding credit
 hours  earned  in  the  non-degree  workforce  credential  program;  AND
