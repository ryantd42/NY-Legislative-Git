October, and November; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  devastating  impact  of  hurricanes  have  taken  a
financial, physical and emotional toll on  the  citizenry  of  New  York
State in recent years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  August  28,  2011,  Hurricane  Irene  tragically  made
landfall in the State of New York as a tropical storm with winds  of  70

  WHEREAS,  On  October  29,  2012,  one  of  the darkest times in our

  WHEREAS, Hurricane Sandy caused a record 14.41 foot storm  surge  at

emergency  response  and  recovery  plans  in  accordance  with  local

and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Weather Service has designated the week of May
1, 2023, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week; now, therefore, be it
