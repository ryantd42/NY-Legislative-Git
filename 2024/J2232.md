her purposeful life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  on  October  14,  1953,  in Norfolk, Virginia, Diane

certified nursing skills to heal and care for others; and
 
  WHEREAS, In her spare time, Diane Robinson took Tae Kwon Do classes;

  WHEREAS,  While  she was passionate about many things, above all her
greatest joy came from spending time with her family, creating  memories
and never taking life too seriously; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Diane  Robinson  is survived by her children, Ebony, Dawn,

compassion, Diane Robinson leaves behind a legacy which will long endure
the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory  to  all  who
were  privileged to have known and loved such an amazing woman; she will
be  deeply  missed  and  truly  merits  the  grateful  tribute  of  this
Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
