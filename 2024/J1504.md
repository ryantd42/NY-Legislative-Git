and  a  T-bar,  the  area offered skiing for the beginner, advanced, and
expert skier; and

more  than  4,000 feet of new snowmaking pipe and over 20 new snow guns;
Woods Valley Ski Area's friendly staff, well-groomed trails,  and  clean
and comfortable lodge have remained consistent throughout the years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success of Woods Valley Ski Area over the years is in
direct correlation to the efforts  of  its  President,  Tim  Woods,  and
previous  generations  and  staff,  whose involvement is, and always has
been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
