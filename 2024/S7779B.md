 poor maternal and infant health outcomes, especially when  it  comes  to
 racial disparities, are a public health crisis that pose a threat to the
 health,  welfare,  and  quality of life of child bearing people, infants
 and their families. The legislature hereby acknowledges that  community-
 based  doula  care  is  one  solution  in  addressing this public health
 crisis. The legislature also acknowledges imbalances in how  doula  care
 is  accessed in different communities. The legislature also acknowledges
 how doulas in the BIPOC community are integrated,  or  lack  integration
 into  the  maternal  health continuum. The legislature acknowledges that
 those seeking to become  community-based  doulas  face  a  multitude  of
 barriers,  including  institutional  barriers,  within  the  healthcare
 continuum. The legislature hereby finds the importance in establishing a
 dedicated fund to support  community-based  doulas  and  community-based
 doula  organizations. This fund would be assisting those trying to navi-
 gate the Federal and State Medicaid frameworks for doula care to  become
 community-based  doulas. Which would be one step in solving the existing
