  MEMORIALIZING Governor Kathy C. Hochul to proclaim
  September  15 - October 15, 2024, as Hispanic Latino
  Heritage Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of  this  Legislative  Body  to  set  aside
months  which  foster  ethnic  pride and enhance the profile of cultural
diversity which strengthens the fabric of the communities of  the  great
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy C. Hochul to proclaim September 15 - October
15, 2024, as Hispanic Latino Heritage Month in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance of  National  Hispanic  Latino  Heritage
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Hispanic Heritage Month began in 1968, when Public
Law  90-498  was  approved  by  Congress, authorizing and requesting the
President  to  issue  an  annual  proclamation  designating  the  week
comprising  September  15th  and  16th as the National Hispanic Heritage
Week; President  Lyndon  Johnson  issued  the  first  one,  Presidential
Declaration 3869; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1988,  Congress  passed  Law 100-402 which amended Law
90-498 and created the Month of National Hispanic Heritage; between 1990
and  2023,  President  George  H.W.  Bush,  President  William  Clinton,
President George W. Bush, President Barack Obama and President Donald J.
Trump  have  issued  annual proclamations for National Hispanic Heritage
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hispanic Latino Heritage Month celebrates the  independence
days  of  several  Latin  American  countries  including: Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua on September  15th,  Mexico
on September 16th, and Chile on September 18th; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In addition, Hispanic Latino Heritage Month highlights all
the Hispanic and Latino cultures found within the Americas, as  well  as
the  diversity  and  the positive contributions of their Hispanic/Latino
brothers and sisters to their communities and congregations; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2019, the Library of  Congress,  National  Archives  and
Records  Office,  National  Humanities  Endowment, National Art Gallery,
National Park Service, Smithsonian Institution, and  the  United  States
Holocaust Memorial Museum joined in paying tribute to the generations of
Hispanic  Americans  who have profoundly shaped and enriched our country
and our culture; and
 
  WHEREAS, As of 2020, the Hispanic population in  the  United  States
was  62.5  million,  the  largest  minority group in the country, and is
projected to reach 111 million by 2060; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mexicans,  Salvadorans  and  Guatemalans  are  largely
concentrated  in western states, while Cubans, Colombians, Hondurans and
 
Peruvians are largely concentrated in the South; the largest numbers  of
Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Ecuadorians are in the Northeast; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  top  states  of  the  largest  number  of  Hispanic
populations are in  California,  Texas,  Florida,  New  York,  Illinois,
Pennsylvania,  Ohio,  Georgia  and  North  Carolina; in 2022, New York's
Hispanic population reached 3,721,000 according  to  the  United  States
Census Bureau; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Latinos continue to advance communities throughout
the country, including many other occupations as small business  owners,
veterans, teachers and public servants; artists; lawmakers; in organized
labor, and in other capacities; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is most fitting to set aside this month to highlight and
honor  the  history  and heritage of the Hispanic Latino and to remember
and pay tribute to the contributions they have made to our State and our
Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy C. Hochul to proclaim September 15 - October
15 2024, as Hispanic Latino Heritage Month in the State of New York; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  The Honorable Kathy C. Hochul, Governor of the State of
New York.
