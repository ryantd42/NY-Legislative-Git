 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation  to  establishing  family
  literacy  programs  for  economically disadvantaged families living in
  poverty areas or in areas served by low-performing public schools

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Legislative findings and declaration. It is the purpose of
 this act to help break the cycle of poverty and illiteracy by  improving
 the  educational  opportunities  for  New  York's low-income families by
 funding family literacy programs that integrate early childhood develop-
 ment, adult literacy or adult basic education, inter-generational learn-
 ing and parenting education. The legislature finds and declares that the
 provision of comprehensive  family  literacy  programs  will  help  many
 parents  and  children  living  in  poverty  to improve their lives. The
 legislature finds that, based on national  and  state  surveys,  persons
 with  low  literacy  levels  are  most  likely to live in poverty and be
 dependent on public assistance. The legislature  finds  that  a  compar-
 atively  high  percentage  of  students  attending low-performing public
 schools live in poverty or have parents with  limited  English  language
 proficiency or poor literacy skills. The legislature finds that there is
 inadequate  funding  to address the illiteracy problem in these communi-
 ties.  Therefore, the legislature finds that it  is  necessary  to  fund
 family literacy programs targeted to economically disadvantaged families
 residing  in poverty areas or in attendance zones served by low-perform-
 ing public schools to assist adults and children living in these  commu-
 nities  to obtain the skills they need to lead successful and productive
 lives.
  § 2. Section 3641 of the education law is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 subdivision 18 to read as follows:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
