  PART B
 
  Section 1. Subparagraph (g) of paragraph 1 of subdivision g of section

 section  27  of  part Q of chapter 39 of the laws of 2019, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (g) There has been since July first, nineteen hundred seventy, a major
 capital improvement essential for the  preservation  energy  efficiency,
 functionality,  or infrastructure of the entire building, improvement of
 the structure including heating, windows, plumbing and roofing but shall
 not be for operational costs or unnecessary cosmetic  improvements.  The
 temporary  increase  based  upon  a major capital improvement under this
 subparagraph for any order of the commissioner issued after  the  effec-
 tive  date  of  the  chapter  of  the laws of two thousand nineteen that
 amended this subparagraph shall be in an amount sufficient  to  amortize
 the  cost  of  the improvements pursuant to this subparagraph (g) over a
 twelve-year period for buildings with thirty-five or fewer  units  or  a
 twelve and one-half year period for buildings with more than thirty-five
 units,  and  shall be removed from the legal regulated rent thirty years
 from the date the increase became effective inclusive of  any  increases
 granted by the applicable rent guidelines board. Temporary major capital
 improvement  increases  shall  be collectible prospectively on the first
 day of the first month beginning sixty days from  the  date  of  mailing
 notice  of  approval to the tenant. Such notice shall disclose the total
 monthly increase in rent and the first month in which the  tenant  would
 be  required  to pay the temporary increase. An approval for a temporary
 major  capital  improvement  increase  shall  not  include  retroactive
 payments. The collection of any increase shall not exceed two percent in
 any year from the effective date of the order granting the increase over
 the  rent  set forth in the schedule of gross rents, with collectability
 of any dollar excess above said sum to  be  spread  forward  in  similar
 increments  and added to the rent as established or set in future years.
 Upon vacancy, the landlord may add any remaining balance of  the  tempo-
 rary  major  capital  improvement  increase to the legal regulated rent.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, for  any  renewal  lease
 commencing  on  or  after  June  14,  2019,  the  collection of any rent

 A. 6216--A  6
 
 any year for any tenant in occupancy  on  the  date  the  major  capital
 improvement  was  approved[,];  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, NO APPLICATION FOR A
 MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RENT INCREASE SHALL BE APPROVED BY  THE  DIVI-
 SION  OF  HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL UNLESS THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY
 HAS FILED ALL COPIES OF PERMITS PERTAINING TO THE MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVE-
 MENT WORK WITH SUCH APPLICATION.  ANY APPLICATION SUBMITTED WITH FRAUDU-
 LENT PERMITS OR WITHOUT REQUIRED PERMITS SHALL BE DENIED; or
  § 2. Paragraph 6 of subdivision c of section 26-511 of the administra-
 tive code of the city of New York, as separately amended by  section  12
 of  part  K  of chapter 36 and section 28 of part Q of chapter 39 of the
 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (6) provides criteria whereby the commissioner may act  upon  applica-
 tions  by  owners  for  increases  in  excess  of the level of fair rent
 increase established under this law provided, however, that such  crite-
 ria  shall  provide  (a) as to hardship applications, for a finding that
 the level of fair rent increase is not sufficient to enable the owner to
 maintain approximately the same average annual net income  (which  shall
 be  computed  without regard to debt service, financing costs or manage-
 ment fees) for the three year period ending on or within six  months  of
 the  date  of  an application pursuant to such criteria as compared with
 annual net income, which prevailed on the average over the period  nine-
 teen  hundred  sixty-eight  through nineteen hundred seventy, or for the
 first three years of operation if the building was completed since nine-
 teen hundred sixty-eight or for the first three  fiscal  years  after  a
 transfer of title to a new owner provided the new owner can establish to
 the  satisfaction  of  the commissioner that he or she acquired title to
 the building as a result of a bona fide sale of the entire building  and
 that  the new owner is unable to obtain requisite records for the fiscal
 years nineteen hundred  sixty-eight  through  nineteen  hundred  seventy
 despite  diligent  efforts to obtain same from predecessors in title and
 further provided that the new owner can provide financial data  covering
 a  minimum  of  six  years under his or her continuous and uninterrupted
 operation of the building to meet the three year to three  year  compar-
 ative  test  periods  herein provided; and (b) as to completed building-
 wide major capital improvements, for a finding  that  such  improvements
 are deemed depreciable under the Internal Revenue Code and that the cost
 is  to  be amortized over a twelve-year period for a building with thir-
 ty-five or fewer housing accommodations, or a twelve  and  one-half-year
 period for a building with more than thirty-five housing accommodations,
 for  any  determination  issued by the division of housing and community
 renewal after the effective date of the [the] chapter of the laws of two
 thousand nineteen that amended this paragraph and shall be removed  from
 the  legal regulated rent thirty years from the date the increase became
 effective inclusive of any increases  granted  by  the  applicable  rent
 guidelines board. Temporary major capital improvement increases shall be
 collectible  prospectively on the first day of the first month beginning
 sixty days from the date of mailing notice of approval  to  the  tenant.
 Such  notice  shall  disclose the total monthly increase in rent and the
 first month in which the tenant would be required to pay  the  temporary
 increase. An approval for a temporary major capital improvement increase
 shall  not  include retroactive payments. The collection of any increase
 shall not exceed two percent in any year from the effective date of  the
 order  granting  the increase over the rent set forth in the schedule of
 gross rents, with collectability of any dollar excess above said sum  to
 be  spread forward in similar increments and added to the rent as estab-
 lished or set in future years.  Upon vacancy, the landlord may  add  any
 A. 6216--A  7
 
 remaining balance of the temporary major capital improvement increase to
 the  legal  regulated  rent.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the
 law, for any renewal lease commencing on or after  June  14,  2019,  the
 collection  of  any rent increases due to any major capital improvements
 approved on or after June 16, 2012 and before June 16,  2019  shall  not
 exceed  two  percent in any year for any tenant in occupancy on the date
 the major capital improvement was approved or based upon  cash  purchase
 price exclusive of interest or service charges. Where an application for
 a  temporary major capital improvement increase has been filed, a tenant
 shall have sixty days from the date of mailing of a notice of a proceed-
 ing in which to answer or reply.  The  state  division  of  housing  and
 community  renewal  shall provide any responding tenant with the reasons
 for the division's approval or denial of such application. THE  DIVISION
 OF  HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL SHALL REQUIRE THE SUBMISSION OF COPIES
 OF ALL PERMITS PERTAINING TO MAJOR CAPITAL  IMPROVEMENT  WORK  WITH  ANY
 APPLICATION  FOR A MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RENT INCREASE. ANY APPLICA-
 TION SUBMITTED WITH FRAUDULENT PERMITS OR WITHOUT REQUIRED PERMITS SHALL
 BE DENIED. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
 hardship increase granted pursuant to this paragraph shall,  when  added
 to the annual gross rents, as determined by the commissioner, exceed the
 sum of, (i) the annual operating expenses, (ii) an allowance for manage-
 ment  services  as  determined  by the commissioner, (iii) actual annual
 mortgage debt service (interest and amortization) on its indebtedness to
 a lending institution,  an  insurance  company,  a  retirement  fund  or
 welfare  fund  which is operated under the supervision of the banking or
 insurance laws of the state of New York or the United States,  and  (iv)
 eight  and  one-half percent of that portion of the fair market value of
 the property which exceeds the unpaid principal amount of  the  mortgage
 indebtedness  referred  to in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. Fair
 market value for the purposes of this paragraph shall be six  times  the
 annual gross rent. The collection of any increase in the stabilized rent
 for  any  apartment  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall not exceed six
 percent in any year from the effective date of the  order  granting  the
 increase  over  the  rent set forth in the schedule of gross rents, with
 collectability of any dollar excess above said sum to be spread  forward
 in similar increments and added to the stabilized rent as established or
 set in future years;

 commencing  on  or  after  June  14,  2019,  the  collection of any rent
 increases due to any major capital improvements  approved  on  or  after
 June  16,  2012 and before June 16, 2019 shall not exceed two percent in
 any year for any tenant in occupancy  on  the  date  the  major  capital
 improvement  was approved; provided, however, where an application for a
 temporary major capital improvement increase has been  filed,  a  tenant
 shall have sixty days from the date of mailing of a notice of a proceed-
 ing  in  which  to  answer  or  reply. The state division of housing and
 community renewal shall provide any responding tenant with  the  reasons
 for  the  division's  approval  or denial of such application; PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER, NO APPLICATION FOR A MAJOR CAPITAL  IMPROVEMENT  RENT  INCREASE
 SHALL  BE  APPROVED  BY  THE  DIVISION  OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL
 UNLESS THE OWNER OF  THE  PROPERTY  HAS  FILED  ALL  COPIES  OF  PERMITS
 PERTAINING  TO THE MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT WORK WITH SUCH APPLICATION.
 ANY APPLICATION SUBMITTED WITH FRAUDULENT PERMITS  OR  WITHOUT  REQUIRED
 PERMITS SHALL BE DENIED; or
  §  5. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that the amend-
 ments to section 26-405 of the city rent and rehabilitation law made  by
 section  one  of  this act shall remain in full force and effect only as
 long as the public emergency requiring the  regulation  and  control  of
 residential  rents and evictions continues, as provided in subdivision 3
 of section 1 of the local emergency housing rent control act;  provided,
 further, that the amendments to section 26-511 of the rent stabilization
 law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine made by section two of this act shall
 expire  on  the  same  date as such law expires and shall not affect the
 expiration of such law as provided under section 26-520 of such law,  as
 from time to time amended.
 
  PART C
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  3  of section 302-a of the multiple dwelling
 law, as added by chapter 911 of the laws of 1965, is amended to read  as
 follows:
  3.  a. If (i) the official records of the department shall note that a
 rent impairing violation exists OR EXISTED  in  respect  to  a  multiple
 dwelling and that notice of such violation has been given by the depart-
 ment, by mail, to the owner last registered with the department and (ii)
 such  note  of the violation [is] WAS not cancelled or removed of record
 within [six] THREE  months  after  the  date  of  such  notice  of  such
 violation,  then  for the period that such violation remains uncorrected
 after the expiration of said [six] THREE months, no rent shall be recov-
 ered by any owner for any premises in such multiple dwelling used  by  a
 resident  thereof for human habitation in which the condition constitut-
 ing such rent impairing violation exists, provided, however, that if the
 violation is one that requires approval of plans by the  department  for
 the  corrective  work  and  if plans for such corrective work shall have
 been duly filed within [three months] ONE MONTH from the date of  notice
 of  such  violation  by the department to the owner last registered with
 the department, the [six-months] THREE MONTH period aforementioned shall
 not begin to run until the date that plans for the corrective  work  are
 approved  by  the department; if plans are not filed within said [three-
 months] ONE MONTH period or if so filed, they are disapproved and amend-
 ments are not duly filed within thirty days after the date of  notifica-
 tion of the disapproval by the department to the person having filed the
 plans,  the  [six-months]  THREE MONTH period shall be computed as if no
 A. 6216--A  10
 
 plans whatever had been filed under this proviso. If a condition consti-
 tuting a rent impairing violation exists  in  the  part  of  a  multiple
 dwelling  used  in  common  by  the  residents  or in the part under the
 control  of the owner thereof, the violation shall be deemed to exist in
 the respective premises of each resident of the multiple dwelling.
  b. The provisions of subparagraph a shall not apply if (i) the  condi-
 tion referred to in the department's notice to the owner last registered
 with  the department did not in fact exist, notwithstanding the notation
 thereof in the records of the department; (ii) the  condition  which  is
 the subject of the violation has in fact been corrected WITHIN THE THREE
 MONTH  PERIOD REQUIRED BY SUBPARAGRAPH A OF THIS SUBDIVISION, though the
 note thereof in the department has not been removed or cancelled;  (iii)
 the  violation  has been caused by the resident from whom rent is sought
 to be collected or by members of his family  or  by  his  guests  or  by
 another  resident  of the multiple dwelling or the members of the family
 of such other resident or by his guests, or (iv) the resident  proceeded
 against  for  rent  has  refused  entry  to the owner for the purpose of
 correcting the condition giving rise to the violation.
  c. To raise a defense under subparagraph a in any  action  to  recover
 rent or in any special proceeding for the recovery of possession because
 of  non-payment of rent, the resident must affirmatively plead and prove
 the material facts under subparagraph a[, and must also deposit with the
 clerk of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending  at  the
 time  of filing of the resident's answer the amount of rent sought to be
 recovered in  the  action  or  upon  which  the  proceeding  to  recover
 possession  is  based,  to be held by the clerk of the court until final
 disposition of the action or proceeding at which time the rent deposited
 shall be paid to the owner, if the owner prevails, or be returned to the
 resident if the resident prevails. Such deposit of  rent  shall  vitiate
 any  right  on  the  part  of the owner to terminate the lease or rental
 agreement of the resident because of nonpayment of rent].
  d. If a resident voluntarily pays rent or an installment of rent  when
 he OR SHE would be privileged to withhold the same under subparagraph a,
 he  OR  SHE shall [not thereafter] have [any] A claim or cause of action
 to recover back the rent or installment of rent so paid.  A  voluntary
 payment within the meaning hereof shall mean payment other than one made
 pursuant to a judgment in an action or special proceeding.
  e.  [If  upon  the  trial of any action to recover rent or any special
 proceeding for the recovery of possession because of non-payment of rent
 it shall appear that the  resident  has  raised  a  defense  under  this
 section  in  bad faith, or has caused the violation or has refused entry
 to the owner for the purpose of correcting the condition giving rise  to
 the  violation,  the court, in its discretion, may impose upon the resi-
 dent the reasonable costs of the owner, including counsel fees, in main-
 taining the action or proceeding not to exceed one hundred dollars.] THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL NOTIFY THE RESIDENT AND OWNER  WHEN  A  RENT  IMPAIRING
 VIOLATION  HAS  BEEN  PLACED  IN THEIR APARTMENT. THE NOTIFICATION SHALL
 INCLUDE A LIST OF THE RENT IMPAIRING VIOLATIONS PLACED AND  AN  EXPLANA-
 TION OF THE RESIDENT'S RIGHT TO RAISE THE RENT IMPAIRING VIOLATIONS AS A
 DEFENSE  IN  ANY ACTION TO RECOVER RENT OR IN ANY SPECIAL PROCEEDING FOR
 THE RECOVERY OF POSSESSION BECAUSE OF NON-PAYMENT OF RENT.
  § 2. Subdivisions 10 and 11  of  section  713  of  the  real  property
 actions and proceedings law, subdivision 10 as amended by chapter 467 of
 the  laws of 1981 and subdivision 11 as added by chapter 312 of the laws
 of 1962, are amended to read as follows:
 A. 6216--A  11
 
  10. The person in possession has entered the property  or  remains  in
 possession by force or unlawful means and he or SHE OR his OR HER prede-
 cessor  in  interest  was not in quiet possession for three years before
 the time of the forcible or unlawful entry or detainer and the petition-
 er  was  peaceably  in  actual possession at the time of the forcible or
 unlawful entry or in constructive possession at the time of the forcible
 or unlawful detainer. ANY LAWFUL OCCUPANT, PHYSICALLY OR  CONSTRUCTIVELY
 IN  POSSESSION,  WHO  HAS BEEN EVICTED OR DISPOSSESSED WITHOUT THE COURT
 PROCESS MANDATED BY SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN OF  THIS  ARTICLE,  MAY
 COMMENCE  A  PROCEEDING  UNDER  THIS  SUBDIVISION  TO  BE  RESTORED  TO
 POSSESSION, AND SHALL BE SO RESTORED UPON PROOF THAT THEIR EVICTION  WAS
 UNLAWFUL;  no  notice  to  quit shall be required in order to maintain a
 proceeding under this subdivision.
  11. The person in possession entered into possession as an incident to
 employment by petitioner, and the time agreed upon for  such  possession
 has expired or, if no such time was agreed upon, the employment has been
 terminated[;  no  notice  to quit shall be required in order to maintain
 the proceeding under this subdivision].
  § 3. Subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 732 of the real property  actions
 and proceedings law, as amended by section 14 of part M of chapter 36 of
 the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  2.  If the respondent answers, the clerk shall fix a date for trial or
 hearing not less than three nor more than eight days  after  joinder  of
 issue,  and shall immediately notify by mail the parties or their attor-
 neys of such date. If the determination be for the petitioner, the issu-
 ance of a warrant shall not be stayed for more than five days from  such
 determination,  except  as provided in section seven hundred fifty-three
 of this article.  IF THE RESPONDENT FAILS TO APPEAR ON  SUCH  DATE,  THE
 COURT,  AFTER  MAKING  AN  ASSESSMENT,  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION THIRTY-TWO
 HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, MAY ISSUE  A  JUDG-
 MENT IN FAVOR OF THE PETITIONER AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE WARRANT SHALL BE
 STAYED  FOR  A  PERIOD  NOT TO EXCEED TEN DAYS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE,
 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE OF THIS ARTICLE.
  3. If the respondent fails to answer within ten days from the date  of
 service,  as  shown  by  the  affidavit or certificate of service of the
 notice of petition and petition, [the judge  shall  render  judgment  in
 favor  of the petitioner and] THE PETITIONER MAY MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR
 A DEFAULT JUDGMENT.  UPON THIS APPLICATION, THE CLERK SHALL FIX  A  DATE
 FOR  INQUEST  AND IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY BY MAIL THE PARTIES OR THEIR ATTOR-
 NEYS OF SUCH DATE.  IF THE RESPONDENT FAILS TO APPEAR ON SUCH DATE,  THE
 COURT,  AFTER  MAKING  AN  ASSESSMENT,  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION THIRTY-TWO
 HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, MAY ISSUE  A  JUDG-
 MENT IN FAVOR OF THE PETITIONER AND may stay the issuance of the warrant
 for  a period of not to exceed ten days from the date of service, except
 as provided in section seven hundred fifty-three of this article.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  apply  to  all
 pending proceedings on and after such date.

  PART D
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature hereby finds and
 declares that:
  (a) the pool of rent regulated apartments in New York  state  contains
 an unacceptably high number of apartments in which the current rents are
 based  on prior rents that exceeded the legal regulated rent at the time
 they were charged, but for which remedies were limited under the law  in
 A. 6216--A  12
 
 effect  before  the  effective  date of the Housing Stability and Tenant
 Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA);
  (b)  it is public policy prospectively to reduce, insofar as possible,
 those rents to a level in line with what they would  have  been  in  the
 absence of the unlawful rent setting and deregulations that were permit-
 ted  under  prior law to go unremedied, and therefore to impose the rent
 calculation standards of the HSTPA prospectively from the  date  of  its
 enactment,  including in cases where the pre-HSTPA rent has already been
 established by a court or administrative agency;
  (c) the purpose of the prospective  application  of  the  penalty  and
 record  review  provisions  of  the  HSTPA  is  to prevent the perpetual
 collection of unlawful and inflated rents, and to encourage  the  volun-
 tary  registration  of any rent stabilized apartment for which any prior
 annual registration statement has not been filed, and to  encourage  the
 voluntary recalculation of unreliable pre-HSTPA rents;
  (d)  in  light  of  court decisions arising under the HSTPA, including
 REGINA METRO V. DHCR, it is public policy that  the  legislature  define
 clearly  the  prospective  reach  of  that law, and limit, to the extent
 required by the constitution, the retroactive reach of that law;
  (e) despite REGINA, the scope of the fraud exception to the  pre-HSTPA
 four-year  rule  for calculating rents remains unsettled and the subject
 of litigation, and it is therefore public policy  that  the  legislature
 codify,  without  expanding or reducing the liability of landlords under
 pre-HSTPA law, the standard for applying that exception;
  (f) the New York state  division  of  housing  and  community  renewal
 (DHCR) misinterpreted the rent stabilization law for a significant peri-
 od  of  time with respect to the regulatory obligations arising from the
 receipt of J-51 and 421-a tax benefits resulting in the unlawful deregu-
 lation of tens of thousands of rent-stabilized apartments,  the  setting
 of  unlawful  rents,  and  the collection of millions of dollars of rent
 overcharges, during a housing  emergency.  Both  landlords  and  tenants
 relied  upon  the  DHCR's  misinterpretation  of the law. In REGINA, the
 Court of Appeals settled many of  the  issues  arising  from  overcharge
 claims by tenants who were misled into refraining from filing overcharge
 cases  during the period when DHCR's erroneous interpretation of the law
 was in effect, but left open the issue of whether a  landlord's  ongoing
 collection  of overcharges and failure to return apartments to rent-sta-
 bilization, after the law was clarified, should be treated as fraud;
  (g) the integrity of the registration system for rent regulated  hous-
 ing  has  been  eroded  by  the  use of base date rents, rather than the
 service and filing of reliable registration  statements,  to  set  rents
 under  the  law  in  effect between the enactment of the Rent Regulation
 Reform Act of 1997 and the HSTPA.  It  is  therefore  public  policy  to
 impose,  prospectively  from  the  date of the enactment of the HSTPA, a
 rent calculation formula that, insofar as possible,  derives  the  legal
 regulated  rents  for  apartments  from reliable registration statements
 served upon tenants and made available to the public; and
  (h) because pre-HSTPA law with respect to the maintenance by landlords
 of rent records was complex, and has an ongoing impact upon  the  calcu-
 lation  of post-HSTPA rents, it is necessary to codify the pre-HSTPA law
 that applied to the destruction of rent records prior to  the  enactment
 of  the  HSTPA,  and  to  define clearly the impact of such law upon the
 prospective calculation of rents under the HSTPA.
  § 2. (a) The legal rent for all rent  stabilized  apartments  for  the
 period  from  July 1, 2019 and thereafter shall be determined in accord-
 ance with Part F of the HSTPA. Where the legal regulated rent for a rent
 A. 6216--A  13
 
 stabilized apartment for the period prior to  June  14,  2019  has  been
 determined  by  any  court  or administrative agency, that determination
 shall not foreclose a recalculation of the post-HSTPA rent, except  that
 any  pre-HSTPA  rent  that,  as of June 14, 2019, is lower than the rent
 that would be permitted to be charged under the HSTPA, shall  be  deemed
 to  be  the  lawful  rent under the HSTPA on June 15, 2019, and shall be
 used as the basis for calculating subsequent rents under the HSTPA;
  (b) Subdivision (a) of this section shall apply to all cases,  includ-
 ing those pending as of June 14, 2019 before any court, appellate tribu-
 nal,  or  administrative agency in which a claim for rent overcharges or
 rent arrears has been asserted with respect to rent stabilized  housing,
 the legal regulated rent for the period from June 14, 2019 and thereaft-
 er shall be determined in accordance with Part F of the HSTPA. The legal
 regulated  rent  for the portion of any overcharge claim involving rents
 paid prior to June 14, 2019 shall be  determined  under  pre-HSTPA  law,
 including the default formula in cases of fraud, as codified herein.
  (c)  Nothing  in  this  act,  or  the  HSTPA,  or  prior law, shall be
 construed as restricting, impeding or diminishing the use of records  of
 any  age  or  type,  going  back  to  any date that may be relevant, for
 purposes of determining the status  of  any  apartment  under  the  rent
 stabilization law;
  (d)  The legal regulated rent payable for the period prior to June 14,
 2019 shall be calculated in accordance with the law in effect  prior  to
 the HSTPA, including the prior four-year limitation on the consideration
 of  rent  records,  and including the fraud exception to such limitation
 and such other exceptions as existed under prior law and under the regu-
 lations of the New York state division of housing and community renewal.
 Nothing in this act shall be construed as limiting such exceptions or as
 limiting the application of any equitable doctrine that extends statutes
 of limitations generally. With respect to the calculation of legal rents
 for the period prior to June 14, 2019, an owner shall be deemed to  have
 committed  fraud  if the owner shall have committed a material breach of
 any duty, arising under statutory,  administrative  or  common  law,  to
 disclose  truthfully  to  any  tenant,  government agency or judicial or
 administrative tribunal, the rent, regulatory status, or lease  informa-
 tion,  for  purposes  of  claiming  an unlawful rent or claiming to have
 deregulated an apartment. The following conduct  shall  be  presumed  to
 have  been  the  product of such fraud: (1) the unlawful deregulation of
 any apartment, including such deregulation as results from  claiming  an
 unlawful  increase  such as would have brought the rent over the deregu-
 lation threshold that existed under prior law, unless the  landlord  can
 prove  good faith reliance on a directive or ruling by an administrative
 agency or court; or (2) beginning October 1, 2011, failing to  register,
 as  rent stabilized, any apartment in a building receiving J-51 or 421-a
 benefits;
  (e) In accordance with the practice of the New York state division  of
 housing and community renewal prior to June 14, 2019, where fraud is not
 established,  base  rents  of apartments unlawfully deregulated shall be
 calculated as the average of rents for comparable rent stabilized apart-
 ments in the building, rather than the  default  formula  applicable  to
 cases involving fraud;
  (f)  For  the  period  prior  to June 14, 2019, neither the version of
 subdivision g of section 26-516 of the administrative code of  the  city
 of  New  York  then  in effect, nor the version of section 2523.7 of the
 rent stabilization code  (9  NYCRR  2523.7)  then  in  effect  shall  be
 construed  as  permitting the destruction of rent records for units that
 A. 6216--A  14
 
 have not been properly and timely registered. Where  records  have  been
 permitted to be destroyed by virtue of proper registration, and no other
 law  required  the  maintenance of such records, and where the owner has
 proven  that  such  records  were  actually destroyed in accordance with
 prior law and that such destruction took place prior to June  15,  2019,
 the  registration  served  and filed prior to such lawful destruction of
 records shall be presumed to be reliable, for purposes of any post-HSTPA
 calculation of the rent, but that presumption shall be  rebuttable.  The
 parties  shall  be  entitled  to  discovery  of any evidence found to be
 reasonably necessary to demonstrate the  legal  rent.  Nothing  in  this
 subdivision  shall  be interpreted as authorizing the destruction of any
 record, that under prior law was relevant to establishing (1) the status
 of an apartment as regulated or unregulated; (2) the presence or absence
 of fraud with respect to renting  any  housing  accommodation;  (3)  the
 presence or absence of willfulness in the collection of overcharges; (4)
 the  useful life of any item, the replacement of which is claimed by the
 owner to qualify an apartment for a rent increase; (5) the  duration  of
 any tenancy, such as would establish whether an owner was entitled under
 prior  law to a longevity increase; or (6) compliance with any law that,
 independently of the rent stabilization law, required  or  requires  the
 maintenance  of  such  records.  Where  the  calculation  of the rent is
 dependent upon records that the owner has improperly destroyed,  includ-
 ing  where  the records were destroyed without the apartment having been
 registered, the rent shall be calculated in accordance with the  default
 formula.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  § 2. Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part
 of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to
 be invalid and after exhaustion of  all  further  judicial  review,  the
 judgment  shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof,
 but shall be confined in its operation to the  clause,  sentence,  para-
 graph,  section or part of this act directly involved in the controversy
 in which the judgment shall have been rendered.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately  provided,  however,  that
 the  applicable effective date of Parts A through D of this act shall be
 as specifically set forth in the last section of such Parts.
