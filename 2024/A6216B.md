  Section 1.  Subdivision c of section 26-511 of the administrative code

 as follows:
  (15) (A) WHERE AN OWNER COMBINES TWO OR MORE VACANT  HOUSING  ACCOMMO-
 DATIONS  OR  COMBINES  A  VACANT  HOUSING ACCOMMODATION WITH AN OCCUPIED
 HOUSING ACCOMMODATION, SUCH INITIAL RENT FOR SUCH NEW  HOUSING  ACCOMMO-
 DATION SHALL BE THE COMBINED LEGAL RENT FOR BOTH PREVIOUS HOUSING ACCOM-
 MODATIONS,  SUBJECT  TO ANY APPLICABLE GUIDELINE INCREASES AND ANY OTHER
 INCREASES AUTHORIZED BY THIS CHAPTER INCLUDING ANY INDIVIDUAL  APARTMENT
 IMPROVEMENT  INCREASES APPLICABLE FOR BOTH HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS. IF AN
 OWNER COMBINES A RENT REGULATED  ACCOMMODATION  WITH  AN  APARTMENT  NOT
 SUBJECT  TO RENT REGULATION, THE RESULTING APARTMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO
 THIS CHAPTER. IF AN OWNER INCREASES THE AREA OF AN APARTMENT NOT SUBJECT
 TO RENT REGULATION BY ADDING SPACE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PART  OF  A  RENT
 REGULATED APARTMENT, EACH APARTMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THIS CHAPTER.
  (B)  WHERE  AN  OWNER SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE OUTER DIMENSION OF A
 VACANT HOUSING ACCOMMODATION, SUCH INITIAL RENT SHALL BE THE PRIOR  RENT
 OF  SUCH  HOUSING ACCOMMODATION, INCREASED BY A PERCENTAGE THAT IS EQUAL
 TO THE  PERCENTAGE  INCREASE  IN  THE  DWELLING  SPACE  AND  SUCH  OTHER
 INCREASES  AUTHORIZED BY THIS CHAPTER INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE GUIDELINE
 INCREASE AND INDIVIDUAL APARTMENT IMPROVEMENT  INCREASE  THAT  COULD  BE
 AUTHORIZED FOR THE UNIT PRIOR TO THE ALTERATION OF THE OUTER DIMENSIONS.
  (C)  NOTWITHSTANDING SUBPARAGRAPHS (A) AND (B) OF THIS PARAGRAPH, SUCH
 INCREASES MAY BE DENIED BASED ON THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH VACANCY  DUE  TO
 HARASSMENT,  FRAUD, OR OTHER ACTS OF EVASION WHICH MAY REQUIRE THAT SUCH
 RENT BE SET IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 26-516 OF THIS TITLE.
  (D) WHERE THE VACANT HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS  ARE  COMBINED,  MODIFIED,
 DIVIDED OR THE DIMENSION OF SUCH HOUSING ACCOMMODATION OTHERWISE ALTERED
 AND  THESE  CHANGES ARE BEING MADE PURSUANT TO A PRESERVATION REGULATORY
 AGREEMENT WITH A FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY OR  INSTRU-
 MENTALITY,  THE  RENT STABILIZED RENTS CHARGED THEREAFTER SHALL BE BASED
 ON AN INITIAL RENT SET BY SUCH AGENCY OR INSTRUMENTALITY, PROVIDED  SUCH
 INITIAL RENT SHALL NOT BE HIGHER THAN IF THE INITIAL RENT WAS CALCULATED
 IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBPARAGRAPHS (A), (B), (E) OR (F) OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
  (E)  WHERE  AN OWNER SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASES THE OUTER DIMENSIONS OF A
 VACANT HOUSING ACCOMMODATION, SUCH INITIAL RENT SHALL BE THE PRIOR  RENT
 OF  SUCH  HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION,  DECREASED  BY THE SAME PERCENTAGE THE
 SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE ORIGINAL APARTMENT WAS DECREASED BY AND SUCH OTHER
 INCREASES AUTHORIZED BY THIS CHAPTER INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE  GUIDELINE
 INCREASE  AND  INDIVIDUAL  APARTMENT  IMPROVEMENT INCREASE THAT COULD BE
 AUTHORIZED FOR THE APARTMENT PRIOR TO THE ALTERATION OF THE OUTER DIMEN-
 SIONS.

 THE  OWNER MAY USE EACH OF THE PREVIOUS APARTMENTS' REMAINING INDIVIDUAL
 APARTMENT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES FOR THE PURPOSES OF A  TEMPORARY  INDI-
 VIDUAL APARTMENT IMPROVEMENT RENT INCREASE. THE OWNER SHALL SUBSEQUENTLY
 DESIGNATE  A  SURVIVING  APARTMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF REGISTRATION THAT
 HAS THE SAME APARTMENT NUMBER AS ONE OF THE PRIOR  APARTMENTS.  IF  THAT
 PRIOR  APARTMENT  HAS  ANY REIMBURSABLE INDIVIDUAL APARTMENT IMPROVEMENT
 MONEY REMAINING AFTER THE COMBINATION, THAT MONEY MAY BE REIMBURSED  FOR
 A. 6216--B  3
 
 FUTURE  INDIVIDUAL  APARTMENT  IMPROVEMENTS UNDERTAKEN WITHIN THE SUBSE-
 QUENT FIFTEEN YEARS FOLLOWING THE COMBINATION.
  (II)  IN  ORDER  FOR  AN  OWNER  TO QUALIFY FOR A TEMPORARY INDIVIDUAL
 APARTMENT IMPROVEMENT RENT INCREASE WHEN APARTMENTS  ARE  COMBINED,  THE
 REQUIREMENTS  FOR  AN  INDIVIDUAL  APARTMENT  IMPROVEMENT, INCLUDING ALL
 NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS CHAPTER SHALL BE MET.
  (G) OWNERS SHALL MAINTAIN  THE  RECORDS  AND  RENT  HISTORIES  OF  ALL
 COMBINED  APARTMENTS,  BOTH  PRIOR  TO  AND  POST  COMBINATION,  FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF RENT SETTING, OVERCHARGE AND ALL OTHER PROCEEDINGS TO  WHICH
 THE RECORDS ARE APPLICABLE.

 LATED APARTMENT, EACH APARTMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THIS ACT.
  (II) WHERE AN OWNER SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE OUTER DIMENSION  OF  A

 MONEY  REMAINING AFTER THE COMBINATION, THAT MONEY MAY BE REIMBURSED FOR
 FUTURE INDIVIDUAL APARTMENT IMPROVEMENTS UNDERTAKEN  WITHIN  THE  SUBSE-

  § 3. The opening paragraph  of  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  4  of
 section  14  of  the  public housing law, as added by chapter 116 of the
 laws of 1997, is amended to read as follows:
  that unless otherwise prohibited by occupancy restrictions based  upon
 income  limitations pursuant to federal, state or local law, regulations
 or other requirements  of  governmental  agencies,  any  member  of  the
 tenant's  family, as defined in paragraph (c) of this subdivision, shall
 succeed to the rights of a tenant under such acts  and  laws  where  the
 tenant has permanently vacated the housing accommodation and such family
 member  has  resided  with  the tenant in the housing accommodation as a
 primary residence for a period of no less than two years, or where  such
 person is a "senior citizen" or a "disabled person," as defined in para-
 graph  (c)  of  this subdivision, for a period of no less than one year,
 immediately prior to the permanent vacating of the housing accommodation
 by the tenant, or from the inception of the tenancy or  commencement  of
 the  relationship,  if  for less than such periods.  FOR THE PURPOSES OF
 THIS PARAGRAPH, "PERMANENTLY VACATED"  SHALL  MEAN  THE  DATE  WHEN  THE
 TENANT OF RECORD PERMANENTLY STOPS RESIDING IN THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION
 REGARDLESS  OF SUBSEQUENT CONTACTS WITH THE UNIT OR THE SIGNING OF LEASE
 RENEWALS OR CONTINUATION  OF  RENT  PAYMENTS.  The  minimum  periods  of
 required  residency set forth in this subdivision shall not be deemed to
 be interrupted by any period during which the "family member"  temporar-
 ily relocates because he or she:

 ing law is REPEALED.
  § 5. Paragraph 5 of subdivision a of section 5 of section 4 of chapter

 act of nineteen seventy-four, is amended to read as follows:
  (5)  housing  accommodations  in  buildings  completed  or  buildings
 substantially  rehabilitated  as family units on or after January first,
 nineteen hundred seventy-four; PROVIDED THAT AN OWNER CLAIMING EXEMPTION
 FROM RENT STABILIZATION ON THE BASIS OF SUBSTANTIAL REHABILITATION SHALL
 SEEK APPROVAL FROM STATE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL WITH-
 IN ONE YEAR OF THE COMPLETION OF THE SUBSTANTIAL REHABILITATION, OR  FOR
 ANY BUILDING PREVIOUSLY ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REHABILITATED
 BEFORE  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF THE CHAPTER OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND
 TWENTY-THREE THAT AMENDED THIS PARAGRAPH,  WITHIN  SIX  MONTHS  OF  SUCH
 EFFECTIVE  DATE,  AND  ULTIMATELY  OBTAIN  SUCH APPROVAL, WHICH SHALL BE
 DENIED ON THE FOLLOWING GROUNDS:
 A. 6216--B  5

 to section 26-511 of chapter 4 of title 26 of the administrative code of
 the city of New York made by section one of this act shall expire on the
 same  date  as  such  law expires and shall not affect the expiration of
 such law as provided under section 26-520 of such law.
 
  PART B
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  in  light  of  court decisions arising under the Housing
 Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019  (HSTPA),  including  REGINA
 METRO  V.  DHCR, it is public policy that the legislature define clearly
 the scope of the fraud exception to the  pre-HSTPA  four-year  rule  for
 calculating  rents which remains unsettled and the subject of litigation
 where courts have diverged from the controlling authority of THORNTON V.
 BARON and GRIMM V. DHCR to impose a common law fraud  standard  that  is
 not  found  in  these  cases  and is inconsistent with the intent of the
 legislature to discourage and penalize fraud against the rent regulatory
 system itself, as well as against individual tenants, and it  is  there-
 fore  public  policy  that  the legislature codify, without expanding or
 reducing the liability of landlords under pre-HSTPA  law,  the  standard
 for applying that exception.
  §  2.  (a)  Nothing  in this act, or the HSTPA, or prior law, shall be
 construed as restricting, impeding or diminishing the use of records  of
 any  age  or  type,  going  back  to  any date that may be relevant, for
 purposes of determining the status  of  any  apartment  under  the  rent
 stabilization law;
  (b)  With  respect  to  the  calculation of legal rents for the period
 either prior to or subsequent to June 14, 2019, an owner shall be deemed
 to have committed fraud if the owner shall  have  committed  a  material
 breach  of  any  duty, arising under statutory, administrative or common
 law, to disclose truthfully to any tenant, government agency or judicial
 or administrative tribunal, the rent, regulatory status, or lease infor-
 mation, for purposes of claiming an unlawful rent or  claiming  to  have
 deregulated  an  apartment,  whether or not the owner's conduct would be
 considered fraud under the common law, and whether or not a  complaining
 tenant  specifically  relied  on  untruthful or misleading statements in
 registrations, leases, or other documents. The following  conduct  shall
 be  presumed  to  have  been the product of such fraud: (1) the unlawful
 deregulation of any apartment, including such  deregulation  as  results
 from  claiming  an unlawful increase such as would have brought the rent
 over the deregulation threshold that existed under prior law, unless the
 landlord can prove good faith reliance on a directive or  ruling  by  an
 administrative  agency or court; or (2) beginning October 1, 2011, fail-
 ing to register, as rent stabilized, any apartment in a building receiv-
 ing J-51 or 421-a benefits.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART C
 A. 6216--B  6
 
  Section 1. Subdivision e of section 26-517 of the administrative  code
 of  the city of New York, as amended by chapter 253 of the laws of 1993,

  e.  The  failure  to  file  a proper and timely initial or annual rent
 registration statement shall, until such time as  such  registration  is
 filed,  bar  an owner from applying for or collecting any rent in excess
 of the legal regulated rent in effect on the date of the last  preceding
 registration  statement  or  if  no such statements have been filed, the
 legal regulated rent in effect on the date  that  the  housing  accommo-
 dation  became subject to the registration requirements of this section.
 The filing of a late registration shall result in the prospective elimi-
 nation of such sanctions and provided that increases in the legal  regu-
 lated rent were lawful except for the failure to file a timely registra-
 tion,  the  owner,  upon  the service and filing of a late registration,
 shall not be found to have collected an overcharge at any time prior  to
 the filing of the late registration. [If such late registration is filed
 subsequent  to the filing of an overcharge complaint, the owner shall be
 assessed a late filing surcharge for each late registration in an amount
 equal to fifty percent of the timely rent registration fee.] IN ADDITION
 TO ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THIS SUBDIVISION, IN THE EVENT  A
 TIMELY  RENT  REGISTRATION  IS NOT FILED AND AFTER NOTICE OF SUCH DELIN-

  e. The failure to file a proper and  timely  initial  or  annual  rent
 registration  statement  shall,  until such time as such registration is
 filed, bar an owner from applying for or collecting any rent  in  excess

 registration statement or if no such statements  have  been  filed,  the
 legal  regulated  rent  in  effect on the date that the housing accommo-
 dation became subject to the registration requirements of this  section.
 The filing of a late registration shall result in the prospective elimi-
 nation  of such sanctions and provided that increases in the legal regu-
 lated rent were lawful except for the failure to file a timely registra-
 tion, the owner, upon the service and filing  of  a  late  registration,
 shall  not be found to have collected an overcharge at any time prior to

 TY-EIGHT OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, BE DOCKETED  AND  ENFORCED
 IN  THE  MANNER  OF  A  JUDGMENT OF THE SUPREME COURT BY THE DIVISION OF
