  COMMEMORATING  the  120th  Anniversary  of  Gilroy
  Kernan & Gilroy on February 2, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and businesses which substantially
contribute to the economic vitality of their communities and the  entire
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  120th  Anniversary  of Gilroy Kernan & Gilroy (GKG) on
Friday, February 2, 2024, in New Hartford, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dedicated to their mission of blending innovative insurance
solutions  with  leading-edge  strategies,  GKG  is  a  family-owned,
independent  insurance agency; the firm currently has a staff of over 60
people, represents over 80 insurance carriers, and manages risk  in  all
50 states and around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, As a pillar of the local community, GKG was founded in 1904
and  is  one  of  Central  New  York's  oldest  and  largest independent
insurance  agencies,  specializing  in  personal,  commercial,  employee
benefits, retirement, and risk management; and
 
  WHEREAS, After the tragic loss of Dave Burns, President of The Burns
Agency,  GKG  acquired  the Burns Agency, after having been close to the
family for many years; the acquisition became effective  on  August  18,
2023, and the Burns Agency became a division of the firm; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a testament to GKG's priority of community values, all
of the Burns Agency staff were retained and  able  to  remain  in  their
workplace;  as  an  established  local  employer,  the  GKG team holds a
diverse range of experience, knowledge,  and  expertise  and  the  Burns
Agency  staff,  now  employees  of  GKG,  remain  committed to servicing
clients and will be exploring opportunities for professional  growth  at
GKG; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  Gilroy  Kernan  &  Gilroy  is  in direct
correlation to the efforts of its President, Lawrence  Gilroy,  and  its
stakeholders,  whose  involvement is, and always has been, characterized
by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an
uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of the
company and the population it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional  business  and  its contributions to the
local and State economies, fully confident  that  it  will  continue  to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 120th Anniversary of Gilroy Kernan & Gilroy on February
2, 2024; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Gilroy  Kernan  &  Gilroy's  President  Lawrence  (Larry)
Gilroy.
