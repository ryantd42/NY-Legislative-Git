  Section 1. Paragraph 1 of subsection (c) of section 4235 of the insur-
 ance law is amended by adding a new subparagraph (O) as follows:
  (O) A POLICY ISSUED TO  AN  ACCOUNTABLE  CARE  ORGANIZATION  ISSUED  A
 CERTIFICATE  OF  AUTHORIZATION  PURSUANT TO ARTICLE TWENTY-NINE-E OF THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH LAW, OR TO A TRUSTEE OR TRUSTEES OF  A  FUND  ESTABLISHED,
 CREATED OR MAINTAINED FOR THE BENEFIT OF MEMBERS OF ONE OR MORE ACCOUNT-
 ABLE  CARE  ORGANIZATIONS ISSUED A CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORIZATION PURSUANT
 TO ARTICLE TWENTY-NINE-E OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW, ALL OF WHOSE ELIGIBLE
 MEMBERS HAVE THE  SAME  PROFESSION,  TRADE  OR  OCCUPATION  PROVIDED  OR
 RELATED  TO  THE  PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE, WHICH ASSOCIATION OR ASSOCI-
 ATIONS HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED AND MAINTAINED IN  GOOD  FAITH  FOR  PURPOSES
 PRINCIPALLY  OTHER  THAN  THAT  OF  OBTAINING INSURANCE AND HAVE BEEN IN
 ACTIVE EXISTENCE FOR  AT  LEAST  TWO  YEARS.  THE  POLICY  SHALL  INSURE
 MEMBERS,  OR EMPLOYEES OF MEMBERS, OF SUCH ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION
 OR ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF PERSONS OTHER THAN EMPLOYERS AND THE
 ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION OR ORGANIZATIONS, OR ANY OFFICIALS, REPRE-
 SENTATIVES, TRUSTEES OR AGENTS THEREOF AND SHALL PROVIDE FOR  THE  ISSU-
 ANCE  OF  A  CERTIFICATE  TO  THE PERSONS INSURED OR SUCH BENEFICIARY AS
 EVIDENCE OF SUCH INSURANCE. THE MEMBERS OR EMPLOYEES  ELIGIBLE  FOR  THE
 INSURANCE  UNDER THE POLICY SHALL BE ALL THE MEMBERS, OR ALL THE MEMBERS
 AND THEIR EMPLOYEES, OR ALL OF ANY CLASS OR CLASSES  THEREOF  DETERMINED
 BY  CONDITIONS PERTAINING TO THEIR EMPLOYMENT OR TO THE ACCOUNTABLE CARE
 ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP OR BOTH. THE PREMIUMS FOR THE  POLICY  SHALL  BE
 PAID FROM THE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION OR MEMBERS' FUNDS, OR PARTLY
 FROM  SUCH  FUNDS AND PARTLY FROM FUNDS CONTRIBUTED BY THE INSURED INDI-
 VIDUALS, OR FROM FUNDS WHOLLY CONTRIBUTED BY THE INSURED INDIVIDUALS.  A
 POLICY ON WHICH ALL OR PART OF THE PREMIUM IS TO BE DERIVED  FROM  FUNDS

 CONTRIBUTED  BY THE INSURED INDIVIDUALS SPECIFICALLY FOR THEIR INSURANCE
 MUST INSURE AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT OF THE THEN ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS OR A
 MINIMUM OF FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS, WHICHEVER IS LESS, EXCLUDING ANY AS
 TO  WHOM  EVIDENCE OF INDIVIDUAL INSURABILITY IS NOT SATISFACTORY TO THE
 INSURER. A POLICY ON WHICH NO PART OF THE PREMIUM IS TO BE DERIVED  FROM
 FUNDS  CONTRIBUTED  BY  THE  INSURED  INDIVIDUALS SPECIFICALLY FOR THEIR
 INSURANCE MUST COVER ALL ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS, EXCLUDING ANY AS TO  WHOM
 EVIDENCE  OF INDIVIDUAL INSURABILITY IS NOT SATISFACTORY TO THE INSURER.
 IN EVERY CASE THE POLICY MUST COVER AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS  AT
 DATE  OF  ISSUE.  THE  INSURANCE COVERAGE ON EMPLOYEES INSURED UNDER THE
 POLICY SHALL BE BASED UPON SOME PLAN  PRECLUDING  INDIVIDUAL  SELECTION.
 HOWEVER,  WITH RESPECT TO SUCH FUND, OR ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION OR
 ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH A  PLAN  MAY  PERMIT  A  NUMBER  OF
 SELECTIONS  BY  THE  FUND,  ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION OR ACCOUNTABLE
 CARE ORGANIZATIONS IF THE SELECTIONS OFFERED UTILIZE CONSISTENT PLANS OF
 COVERAGE SO  THAT  THE  RESULTING  PLANS  OF  COVERAGE  ARE  REASONABLE.
 FURTHERMORE,  SUCH  A  PLAN  MAY  PERMIT  A LIMITED NUMBER OF SELECTIONS
 OFFERED BY EMPLOYEES  OR  MEMBERS  IF  THE  SELECTIONS  OFFERED  UTILIZE
 CONSISTENT  PLANS  OF  COVERAGE FOR INDIVIDUAL GROUP MEMBERS SO THAT THE
 RESULTING PLANS OF COVERAGE ARE REASONABLE.  IF  A  POLICY  DIVIDEND  IS
 DECLARED OR A REDUCTION IN RATE IS MADE UNDER SUCH A POLICY, THE EXCESS,
 IF  ANY,  OF THE AGGREGATE DIVIDENDS OR RATE REDUCTIONS UNDER THE POLICY
 OVER THE AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE FOR INSURANCE UNDER SUCH POLICY MADE FROM
 THE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION OR EMPLOYER FUNDS, INCLUDING  EXPENDI-
 TURES  MADE  IN  CONNECTION WITH ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH POLICY, SHALL BE
 APPLIED BY THE POLICYHOLDER FOR THE SOLE BENEFIT OF THE INSURED INDIVID-
 UALS. A POLICY ISSUED PURSUANT TO  THIS  SUBPARAGRAPH  SHALL  PROVIDE  A
 CONVERSION  PRIVILEGE  NO  LESS  FAVORABLE  THAN  THAT  PROVIDED  FOR IN
 SUBSECTION (E) OF SECTION THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE OF  THIS
 CHAPTER.
  §  2.  Subsection (g) of section 3231 of the insurance law, as amended
 by section 70 of part D of chapter 56 of the laws of 2013,  paragraph  1
