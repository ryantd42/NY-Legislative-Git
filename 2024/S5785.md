 to negotiate with, and  enter  into  written  agreements  with  employee
 organizations representing public employees which have been certified or
 recognized,  (c)  encouraging  such  public  employers and such employee
 organizations to agree  upon  procedures  for  resolving  disputes,  (d)
 creating  a  public  employment  relations  board to assist in resolving
 disputes between public employees and public employers, and (e) continu-
 ing the prohibition against UNLAWFUL strikes  by  public  employees  and
 providing remedies for violations of such prohibition.
  §  2.  Section 201 of the civil service law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 9-a to read as follows:

  §  3.  Subdivision 3 of section 207 of the civil service law, as added
 by chapter 392 of the laws of 1967, is amended to read as follows:

  3. certify or recognize an employee organization upon (a) the determi-
 nation that such organization represents that group of public  employees
 it  claims  to  represent,  and (b) the affirmation by such organization
 that it does not assert the  right  to  ENGAGE  IN  AN  UNLAWFUL  strike

 strike, or to impose an obligation to conduct, assist or participate  in
 such [a] AN UNLAWFUL strike.
  §  4.  Section 209 of the civil service law is amended by adding a new

 TO AVOID ANY INTERRUPTION TO THE OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT.
 NO  TA-PUBLIC  EMPLOYER,  ITS OFFICERS, OR AGENTS SHALL CHANGE THE SALA-

 IN  THE  JUDGMENT  OF  THE  BOARD,  THREATEN  SUBSTANTIALLY TO INTERRUPT
 GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS TO A DEGREE SUCH AS TO DEPRIVE ANY
 SECTION OF THE STATE OF  ESSENTIAL  TRANSPORTATION  SERVICE,  THE  BOARD

 EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION OR ANY TA-PUBLIC EMPLOYER. THE COMPENSATION OF THE

 EON TO THE GOVERNOR WITHIN THIRTY DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ITS CREATION.
  AFTER  THE  CREATION OF SUCH EMERGENCY BOARD AND FOR THIRTY DAYS AFTER
 SUCH EMERGENCY BOARD HAS MADE ITS REPORT TO  THE  GOVERNOR,  NO  CHANGE,
 EXCEPT  BY AGREEMENT, SHALL BE MADE BY THE PARTIES TO THE CONTROVERSY IN
 THE CONDITIONS OUT OF WHICH THE DISPUTE AROSE.

 FAILED,  THE PARTIES' DISPUTE STILL HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED, THE TA-PUBLIC
 EMPLOYER MAY IMPLEMENT ITS LAST, BEST AND FINAL  OFFER  TO  RESOLVE  THE

  Violations  and penalties; presumption; prohibition against consent to

 sion one of this section may be subject to removal or other disciplinary

 absent from work without permission, or who abstains wholly or  in  part
 from  the  full  performance  of his duties in his normal manner without
 permission, on the date or dates when [a]  AN  UNLAWFUL  strike  occurs,
 shall  be  presumed to have engaged in such UNLAWFUL strike on such date
 or dates.

 ing on behalf of any  public  employer  any  authority,  supervision  or
 direction  over  any  public employee shall have the power to authorize,
 approve, condone or consent to [a] AN UNLAWFUL strike, or  the  engaging
 in  [a]  AN  UNLAWFUL  strike, by one or more public employees, and such
 person shall not authorize, approve, condone or consent to such UNLAWFUL
 strike or engagement.
  § 7. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of subdivision 3 of  section  210  of  the
 civil service law, paragraph (e) as amended by chapter 24 of the laws of
 1969  and  paragraph  (f) as amended by chapter 677 of the laws of 1977,
 are amended to read as follows:
  (e) In determining  whether  an  employee  organization  has  violated
 subdivision  one  of  this section, the board shall consider (i) whether
 the employee organization called the UNLAWFUL strike or tried to prevent
 it, and (ii) whether the employee organization made or was  making  good
 faith efforts to terminate the UNLAWFUL strike.
  (f) If the board determines that an employee organization has violated
 the provisions of subdivision one of this section, the board shall order
 forfeiture of the rights granted pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
 (b)  of  subdivision  one,  and subdivision three of section two hundred
 eight of this [chapter] ARTICLE, for such specified period  of  time  as
 the  board  shall  determine, or, in the discretion of the board, for an
 indefinite period of time subject to restoration upon application,  with
 notice  to  all  interested  parties,  supported  by proof of good faith
 compliance with the requirements of  subdivision  one  of  this  section
 since  the  date  of such violation, such proof to include, for example,
 the successful negotiation, without a violation of  subdivision  one  of
 this  section, of a contract covering the employees in the unit affected
 by such violation; provided, however, that where a fine  imposed  on  an
 employee  organization  pursuant  to  subdivision  two  of section seven
 hundred fifty-one of the judiciary law remains wholly or partly  unpaid,
 after  the  exhaustion of the cash and securities of the employee organ-
 ization, the board shall direct that, notwithstanding  such  forfeiture,
 such  membership  dues deduction shall be continued to the extent neces-
 sary to pay such fine and  such  public  employer  shall  transmit  such
 moneys to the court. In fixing the duration of the forfeiture, the board
 shall  consider  all the relevant facts and circumstances, including but
 not limited to: (i) the extent of any wilful defiance of subdivision one
 S. 5785  6
 
 of this section (ii) the impact of the UNLAWFUL  strike  on  the  public
 health,  safety,  and  welfare  of the community and (iii) the financial
 resources of the employee organization; and the board may  consider  (i)
 the  refusal  of  the  employee  organization  or the appropriate public
 employer or the representative thereof, to submit to the  mediation  and
 fact-finding  procedures  provided  in  section two hundred nine OF THIS
 ARTICLE and (ii) whether, if so alleged by  the  employee  organization,
 the  appropriate  public employer or its representatives engaged in such
 acts of extreme provocation as to detract from the responsibility of the
 employee organization for the  UNLAWFUL  strike.  In  determining  the
 financial  resources  of  the  employee  organization,  the  board shall
 consider both the income and the assets of such  employee  organization.
 In  the  event  membership  dues are collected by the public employer as
 provided in paragraph (b) of subdivision  one  of  section  two  hundred
 eight  of  this  [chapter] ARTICLE, the books and records of such public
 employer shall be prima facie evidence of the amount so collected.
  § 8. Subdivision 4 of section 210 of the civil service law, as amended
 by chapter 24 of the laws of 1969 and as renumbered by  chapter  503  of
 the laws of 1971, is amended to read as follows:
  4. Within sixty days of the termination of [a] AN UNLAWFUL strike, the
 chief  executive  officer  of  the government involved shall prepare and
 make public a report in  writing,  which  shall  contain  the  following
 information:  (a)  the circumstances surrounding the commencement of the
 UNLAWFUL strike, (b) the efforts used to terminate the UNLAWFUL  strike,
 (c)  the names of those public employees whom the public officer or body
 had reason to believe  were  responsible  for  causing,  instigating  or
 encouraging  the  UNLAWFUL strike and (d) related to the varying degrees
 of individual responsibility, the sanctions imposed or proceedings pend-
 ing against each such individual public employee.
  § 9. Section 211 of the civil service law, as added by chapter 392  of
 the laws of 1967, is amended to read as follows:
  § 211. Application  for  injunctive  relief.  1.  PURSUANT TO SECTION
 EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN OF THE LABOR LAW, A  PARTY  SUBJECT  TO  SUBDIVISION
 FIVE  OF  SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  NINE  OF  THIS ARTICLE MAY APPLY TO THE
 SUPREME COURT FOR AN INJUNCTION TO PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO UPON A  SHOW-
 ING  THAT (A) THERE IS REASONABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE A VIOLATION OF SUBDI-
 VISION FIVE OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED NINE OF THIS  ARTICLE  HAS  OCCURRED,
 AND  (B) WHERE IT APPEARS THAT IMMEDIATE AND IRREPARABLE INJURY, LOSS OR
 DAMAGE WILL RESULT THEREBY RENDERING A RESULTING JUDGMENT ON THE  MERITS
 INEFFECTUAL  NECESSITATING  THE MAINTENANCE OF, OR RETURN TO, THE STATUS
 QUO TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL RELIEF.
  2. Notwithstanding the provisions of section eight  hundred  seven  of
 the  labor  law,  where  it appears that public employees or an employee
 organization threaten or are about to  do,  or  are  doing,  an  act  in
 violation  of  section two hundred ten of this article, the chief execu-
 tive officer of the government involved shall (a) forthwith  notify  the
 chief  legal  officer  of  the government involved, and (b) provide such
 chief legal officer with such facilities, assistance and  data  as  will
 enable the chief legal officer to carry out his OR HER duties under this
 section, and, notwithstanding the failure or refusal of the chief execu-
 tive officer to act as aforesaid, the chief legal officer of the govern-
 ment  involved shall forthwith apply to the supreme court for an injunc-
 tion against such violation.  If an order of  the  court  enjoining  or
 restraining such violation does not receive compliance, such chief legal
 officer  shall  forthwith  apply  to  the  supreme  court to punish such
 violation under section seven hundred fifty of the judiciary law.
 S. 5785  7
 
  § 10. This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however,  that
 section four of this act shall take effect on the same date as the expi-
 ration  of  subdivision  5  of  section  209 of the civil service law as
 provided in section 45 of chapter 929 of the laws of 1986, as amended.
