 AN ACT to establish the senior driver safety  commission  and  providing
  for  its  powers  and  duties;  and  providing  for the repeal of such
  provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  This  act  shall  be  known and may be cited as the "Bill
 Geller act", in memory of Bill Geller, a forty-seven year old  man  from
 Somers,  New  York who was struck and killed by an eighty-eight year old
 driver as he was walking down a road on a clear, sunny day.  Mr.  Geller
 left  a  grieving  family,  including  a young son. The driver was never
 charged in conjunction with his death.
  § 2. Legislative intent. 1. The legislature hereby finds and declares:
  (a) seniors represent the fastest-growing  segment  of  drivers,  with
 current  projections  suggesting  that  a quarter of all drivers will be
 over 65 by 2025;
  (b) drivers 85 years of age and older have  a  higher  rate  of  fatal
 accidents than teenagers;
  (c)  accidents  involving  senior  drivers are caused in large part by
 factors such as diminished peripheral vision, which can lead drivers  to
 enter roadways in the path of oncoming vehicles; slower reaction time; a
 more limited range of movement; and poor night vision; and
  (d)  based  upon  the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
 suggestions and comparative analysis of provisions  across  the  states,
 New  York  State  lags  behind  other states in adopting age-appropriate
 driving safeguards.
  2. The legislature therefore finds and declares that a  senior  driver
 safety commission shall be established pursuant to this act.
  §  3. Senior driver safety commission. 1. The commission shall consist
 of twelve members. Four of the members shall be appointed by the  gover-
 nor,  of  which  one shall be from the department of motor vehicles, one
 shall be from the department of transportation and one shall be from the
 office for the aging.  Three of the members shall be  appointed  by  the

 temporary  president  of  the  senate.  Three  of the members shall be
 appointed by the speaker of the assembly. One member shall be  appointed
 by  the  minority leader of the senate. One member shall be appointed by
 the  minority  leader  of  the  assembly. All appointments shall be made
 within thirty days of the effective date of this act.
  2. The commission shall, within twenty days following the  appointment
 of all its members, elect a chairperson from among such members.
  3.  The commission shall study, examine and review the issue of senior
 driver safety. In conducting its study, the commission shall:
  (a) evaluate the effectiveness of  current  laws  and  regulations  in
 regards to senior driver safety;
  (b)  make  regulatory  and  legislative  recommendations  necessary to
 increase the safety of all drivers, passengers and pedestrians;
  (c) survey and assess the leading causes of senior  driver  car  acci-
 dents;
  (d) identify and analyze preventative measures that may be implemented
 by the state to reduce the number of accidents involving senior drivers;
  (e) study and evaluate the availability and effectiveness of screening
 tests for identifying impaired drivers;
  (f)  survey  and assess the problems of driving under the influence of
 prescription drugs often used by senior drivers;
  (g) analyze and provide measures that may mitigate the  risks  associ-
 ated  with  the operation of motor vehicles by senior drivers, including
 the use of non-traditional driving devices that may mitigate risks; and
  (h) consider any other issues  or  matters  the  commission  may  deem
 appropriate to fulfill the scope of its charge.
  4. The commission shall report its findings, conclusions and recommen-
 dations to the governor and legislature no later than one hundred eighty
 days after the effective date of this act.
  §  4. As used in this act "senior driver" is defined as any individual
 aged 70 and older with a valid driver's license issued by the  New  York
 state department of motor vehicles.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately and shall remain in effect
 until  the  one  hundred eightieth day after it shall have become a law,
 when upon such date the provisions of this act shall be deemed repealed.
