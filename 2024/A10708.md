 COMMUNICATION ASSERTING OR CLAIMING THAT THE TARGET HAS ENGAGED IN COPY-
 RIGHT INFRINGEMENT.
  2. "TARGET" SHALL MEAN A NEW YORK RESIDENT:
  (A)  WHO  HAS RECEIVED A DEMAND LETTER OR AGAINST WHOM AN ASSERTION OR

 A. 10708  2
 
  (B) THE CLAIM OR ASSERTION OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IS BASED ON COPY-
 RIGHTED  MATERIAL THAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN OR FOR WHICH THE ASSERTER
 LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE COPYRIGHT.
  3.  A  COURT  DETERMINING  WHETHER AN AMOUNT DEMANDED WAS MADE IN GOOD
 FAITH SHALL CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS:
  (A) THE AMOUNT OF THE DEMAND THAT MAKES UP THE COST OF THE COPYRIGHTED
 MATERIAL;
  (B) THE AMOUNT OF THE DEMAND THAT MAKES UP ANY  REASONABLE  COSTS  AND
 ATTORNEY'S  FEES INCURRED IN MAKING THE ASSERTION, PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT
 WHERE THE ASSERTION WAS  MADE  THROUGH  AUTOMATED  MEANS  OR  THE  COSTS
 INCURRED  TO  MAKE  AND  COMMUNICATE  THE ASSERTION WERE DE MINIMIS, THE
 COURT SHALL FIND THAT THE COST INCURRED IN MAKING THE ASSERTION IS  ZERO
 DOLLARS;
  (C)  THE AMOUNT OF THE DEMAND THAT MAKES UP DAMAGES RELATED TO THE USE
 OF  THE  COPYRIGHTED  MATERIAL,  INCLUDING  REPUTATIONAL  DAMAGES,  LOST
 LICENSING  REVENUE, LOST SALES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ANY OTHER FINANCIAL
 LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INFRINGEMENT, PROVIDED  HOWEVER  THAT  A  COURT
 SHALL ASSESS THE VERACITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND THE AMOUNT CLAIMED BY SUCH
 DAMAGES;
  (D) THE AMOUNT OF THE DEMAND THAT MAKES UP ANY OTHER COSTS;
  (E)  THE  AMOUNT  THAT IS GENERALLY AWARDED FOR SIMILAR CLAIMS WHERE A
 PERSON  ASSERTING  COPYRIGHT  INFRINGEMENT  PREVAILS,  OTHER  THAN  SUCH
 AMOUNTS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION;
  (F)  THE AMOUNT THAT A WILLING BUYER OF THE RELEVANT COPYRIGHTED MATE-
 RIAL IS WILLING TO PAY A WILLING SELLER.  TO  DETERMINE  SUCH  AMOUNT  A
 COURT MAY EXAMINE:
  (I) EXISTING LISTINGS, SALES AND NEGOTIATIONS FOR SALES, WHETHER PRES-
 ENTLY OR PREVIOUSLY OCCURRING;
  (II) THE COST OF OTHER, SIMILAR COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL THAT THE ASSERTER
 HAS  LISTED, SOLD AND NEGOTIATED, WHETHER PRESENTLY OR PREVIOUSLY OCCUR-
 RING; AND
  (III) THE OVERALL MARKET FOR SIMILAR COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS;
  (G)  THE  RATIO  BETWEEN  THE  DIFFERENT  CATEGORIES  OF  ALL  AMOUNTS
 ASSERTED, IN RELATION TO THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF THE DEMAND;
  (H)  WHETHER  SUCH AMOUNTS DEMANDED FROM THE ASSERTER EVINCE AN INTENT
 TO COMPEL THE RECIPIENT TO SETTLE FOR A SIGNIFICANTLY  HIGHER  SUM  THAN
 THE TYPICAL COST OF THE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL TO AVOID THE COSTS OF LITI-
 GATING  A  CLAIM.  THE  COURT  MAY  CONSIDER ANY RELEVANT NON-PRIVILEGED
 INFORMATION IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION; AND
  (I) THE AMOUNT THAT THE ASSERTER WOULD HAVE RECOVERED OR  DID  RECOVER
 HAD  THEY  BEEN  SUCCESSFUL OR WHEN THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN AN ACTION TO
 ENFORCE THE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL, OTHER THAN SUCH AMOUNTS  DESCRIBED  IN
 PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  4.  WHERE SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY, A COURT MAY
 CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AS EVIDENCE THAT A PERSON HAS MADE A  BAD
 FAITH ASSERTION OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT:
  (A)  THE DEMAND LETTER DOES NOT CONTAIN A REFERENCE TO THE COPYRIGHTED
 MATERIAL AND THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR  OWNERS  AND
 ASSIGNEE OR ASSIGNEES, IF ANY;
  (B)  THE  DEMAND  LETTER  DEMANDS PAYMENT OF A LICENSE FEE OR RESPONSE
 WITHIN AN UNREASONABLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME;
  (C) THE CLAIM OR ASSERTION OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IS DECEPTIVE;
  (D) THE CLAIM OR ASSERTION OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IS MERITLESS, AND
 THE PERSON KNEW, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, THAT THE CLAIM  OR  ASSERTION  IS
 MERITLESS;
 A. 10708  3
 
  (E)  THE  PERSON  OR  THEIR SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES HAVE PREVIOUSLY
 FILED OR THREATENED TO FILE ONE OR MORE LAWSUITS BASED ON  THE  SAME  OR
 SIMILAR CLAIM OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT, AND:

 PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION; OR

 MENT IN LITIGATION, AND A COURT FOUND THE CLAIM TO BE MERITLESS; AND

 OR ALTERING ANY PARTIES' RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO A COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
 CLAIM BROUGHT IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
