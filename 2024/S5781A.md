 of taxes for the two thousand eleven-two  thousand  twelve  through  two
 thousand  eighteen-two  thousand  nineteen  school  years,  the parcel's
 affiliated income may be no greater than five hundred thousand  dollars,
 as  determined  by  the commissioner pursuant to subdivision fourteen of
 this section or section one hundred seventy-one-u of  the  tax  law,  in
 order to be eligible for the basic exemption authorized by this section.
 Beginning  with  the  two  thousand  nineteen-two thousand twenty school
 year, for purposes of the exemption  authorized  by  this  section,  the
 parcel's  affiliated  income  may  be  no greater than two hundred fifty
 thousand dollars, as so determined. As used herein, the term "affiliated
 income" shall mean the combined income of  all  of  the  owners  of  the
 parcel  who  resided  primarily thereon on the applicable taxable status
 date, and  of  any  owners'  spouses  residing  primarily  thereon.  For
 exemptions  on  final  assessment rolls to be used for the levy of taxes
 for the two thousand eleven-two thousand twelve school year,  affiliated
 income  shall  be  determined  based  upon  the parties' incomes for the
 income tax year ending in two thousand nine. In each  subsequent  school
 year,  the applicable income tax year shall be advanced by one year. The
 term "income" as used herein shall have the same meaning as in  subdivi-
