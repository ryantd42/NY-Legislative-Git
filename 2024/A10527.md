  2-a.  Where  and to the extent that an agreement between the state and
 an employee organization entered into pursuant to  article  fourteen  of
 the  civil  service law or an interest arbitration award issued pursuant
 to subdivision four of section two hundred nine of the civil service law
 so provides on behalf of employees in the  collective  negotiating  unit
 designated  as  the  security  supervisors  unit established pursuant to
 article fourteen of the civil service law, and upon audit and warrant of
 the comptroller, the director shall provide for the payment of moneys to
 such employee organization for the establishment and maintenance  of  an
 employee  benefit  fund established by the employee organization for the
 employees in the negotiating unit covered by the  controlling  provision
 of  such agreement providing for such employee benefit fund, such amount
 to be determined consistent with said agreement  on  the  basis  of  the
 number  of  full-time  annual  salaried  employees, as determined by the
 comptroller, on the payroll on the last day of  the  payroll  period  in
 which  March  first,  two  thousand  [sixteen]  TWENTY-THREE  falls  for
 payments to be made on April first, two thousand [sixteen]  TWENTY-THREE
 and,  on  the  last  day of the payroll period in which March first, two

 shall  be  increased  by  the  salary increase amounts specified in this
 section. If a position is created and is filled by  the  appointment  of

 the  budget  may  reduce  the  salary  of any such position, which is or
