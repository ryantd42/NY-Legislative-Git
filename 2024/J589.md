  HONORING  Firefighter  Alfred  Meyer  Jr. upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  50  years  of dedicated service to the Locust
  Valley Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
Alfred  Meyer  Jr.  upon  the  occasion  of  his designation for special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated service  to  the  Locust  Valley
Fire  Department  to  be  recognized  at  their  50  Years  of  Service
celebration on Saturday, April 15, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Volunteer firefighters unwaveringly serve our  great  State
with  pride,  valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often
the first to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is  a  fire,
transportation  accident,  natural  disaster,  act of terrorism, medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Alfred Meyer Jr. is one such firefighter; throughout 50 years of devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Firefighter Alfred Meyer Jr. upon the occasion of his  designation
for  special  recognition  after  50  years  of dedicated service to the
Locust Valley Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Firefighter Alfred Meyer Jr.
