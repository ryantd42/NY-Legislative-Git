  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  those distinguished individuals and businesses which contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the Sullivan County Budget Office upon the occasion of  its  designation
as  recipient  of  the  Distinguished  Budget  Presentation Award by the
Government Finance Officers Association; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Sullivan County Budget Office was  nominated  for  this
prestigious  award  for  its steadfast and unremitting commitment to its
beloved community of Sullivan County, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Competing against 1,700 budgets submitted to the Government
Finance Officers Association (GFOA), the Sullivan County  Budget  Office
has  earned  the  Distinguished  Budget Presentation Award for the ninth
time in a row; they judged the budgets on  their  excellence  as  policy
documents,  financial  plans,  operations  guides  and  communications
devices, deeming Sullivan's to be proficient in all four categories; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ensuring  transparency  and  accountability  in  presenting
Sullivan  County's  key  financial  document, the Sullivan County Budget
Office consists of a small team  that  spends  a  remarkable  amount  of
effort  in  compiling  a  readable  document  for  a nearly $300 million
budget; their efforts present the budget in an understandable fashion to
taxpayers; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Sullivan  County  Budget  Office  is  in
direct  correlation  to  the efforts of its Manager, Joshua Potosek, and
dedicated staff and volunteers, whose involvement are, and  always  have
been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown  a
long  and  sustained  commitment to excellence certainly have earned the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  the  Sullivan  County  Budget  Office  upon  the  occasion of its
designation as recipient of the Distinguished Budget Presentation  Award
by the Government Finance Officers Association; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Sullivan County Budget  Office  and  Sullivan  County
Manager, Joshua Potosek.
