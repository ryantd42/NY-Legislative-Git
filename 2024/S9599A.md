  (I) three percent of such facility's total reported annual revenue for
 patient  care  services, based on the facility's most recently available
 reported data, without the prior written approval of  the  commissioner;
 OR
  (II) IN THE CASE OF A RESIDENTIAL HEALTH CARE FACILITY WHICH, OVER THE
 TWO  IMMEDIATELY  PRECEDING SUCCESSIVE QUARTERS, HAS BEEN COMPLIANT WITH
 THE MINIMUM STAFFING LEVEL REQUIREMENTS PRESCRIBED  BY  SECTION  TWENTY-
 EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY-FIVE-B OF THIS CHAPTER, FIVE PERCENT OF SUCH FACIL-
 ITY'S  TOTAL REPORTED ANNUAL REVENUE FOR PATIENT CARE SERVICES, BASED ON

 WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO THE COMMISSIONER.  The commissioner shall make a
 determination to approve or disapprove a request for withdrawal of equi-
 ty or assets under this subdivision within sixty days of the date of the
 receipt  of  a written request from the facility. Requests shall be made
 in a form acceptable to the department by certified or registered  mail.
 In  reviewing  such requests the commissioner shall consider the facili-
 ty's overall financial condition, any indications of financial distress,
 whether the facility is delinquent in any payment owed  to  the  depart-
 ment,  whether  the  facility  has  been cited for immediate jeopardy or
 substandard quality of care, and such other factors as the  commissioner
 deems  appropriate. In addition to any other remedy or penalty available
 under this chapter, and after opportunity for a hearing, the commission-
 er may require replacement of the withdrawn equity  or  assets  and  may
 impose  a penalty for violation of the provisions of this subdivision in
 an amount not to exceed ten percent  of  any  amount  withdrawn  without
 prior approval.

 FACILITY STAFF.
  (B) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL DISTRIBUTE MONIES MADE AVAILABLE  FOR  THIS
 PURPOSE  UNDER  THIS  SUBDIVISION IN THE FORM OF GRANTS TO PROVIDERS. IN
 DETERMINING THE FUNDING FOR PROVIDERS, THE COMMISSIONER  SHALL  CONSIDER

 AND  THE  RATE  REGION  THE FACILITY IS LOCATED WITHIN. THE COMMISSIONER
 SHALL PROMULGATE THE RULES AND REGULATIONS  NECESSARY  FOR  IMPLEMENTING
