 Introduced  by  Sens.  BROUK, CLEARE, HARCKHAM -- read twice and ordered
  printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee  on  Mental
  Health
 
 AN  ACT to amend the mental hygiene law, in relation to providing mental
  telehealth services to children, adolescents, and young adults
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings and intent. The Legislature affirms
 the finding of the U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory on  Protecting  Youth
 Mental  Health that the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered young
 peoples' experiences at home, at school, and in the  community  and  has
 exacerbated  the  unprecedented stresses young people face. The Legisla-
 ture also finds that there exists an obligation to  act  to  assist  our
 children  and  their  families  in  this moment of need. The Legislature
 intends, then, to provide actionable  solutions  for  young  people  and
 their families in support of the mental health of children, adolescents,
 and young adults.
  § 2. Section 5.05 of the mental hygiene law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision (f) to read as follows:

 ADDICTION  SERVICES  AND  SUPPORTS  SHALL ESTABLISH A YOUTH MENTAL TELE-
 HEALTH SERVICES PROGRAM TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH  SERVICES,
 INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES, FOR YOUTH TO RESPOND TO IDEN-
 TIFIED MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS, INCLUDING THOSE NEEDS THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED
 FROM  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND FOR YOUTH OR FAMILIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE
 ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH  PROFESSIONALS  IN-PERSON.  SUCH  PROGRAM  SHALL
 PROVIDE UP TO FIVE MENTAL TELEHEALTH SERVICES ANNUALLY AT NO COST TO THE
 INDIVIDUAL,  FOR  ACUTE  CRISIS  RESPONSE,  MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT, OR
 INITIATION OF CARE TO REDUCE BARRIERS AND FACILITATE ENGAGEMENT IN LONG-
 TERM CARE.
  AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE, BUT NO LATER THAN AUGUST FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND
 TWENTY-FOUR,  THE OFFICES SHALL ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH A VENDOR TO
 CREATE, OR USE AN EXISTING,  WEBSITE  OR  WEB-BASED  APPLICATION,  AS  A
