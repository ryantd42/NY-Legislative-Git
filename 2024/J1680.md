  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the
  Kerhonkson Volunteer Fire Company
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  commemorate  the
Anniversary  of  the  Kerhonkson Volunteer Fire Company and to honor its
past and present firefighting members for 100 years of  fire  protection
to the citizens of Kerhonkson, New York, and its surrounding communities
on Thursday, December 26, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious  occasion  will  be  celebrated  at  a
companywide event on Saturday, January 27, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fire companies are an integral part of community protection
services in every locality of our State; during the past 100 years,  the
courageous  and  devoted  firefighters  of the Kerhonkson Volunteer Fire
Company have valiantly responded to all types of  fire  emergencies  and
have won the praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters serve without pay, devote hundreds
of hours of time away from family, and in many  cases  spend  their  own
money  on  firefighting gear and bear the responsibility for recruitment
and retention to maintain organizational stability; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the night of December  26,  1924,  the  Kerhonkson  Fire
Company  was  organized  at  a  meeting  of  31 men, chaired by Jason O.
Decker, at the  Arcadia  Garage;  an  election  produced  the  following
results:  James  Doyle,  Foreman  (now  called  Chief);  Charles  Black,
Assistant Foreman; Howard Humiston, Foreman of Hose;  Selah  Terwilliger
and  Percy  Greene,  Hydrantmen;  and  HR  Decker  and  Richard  Hayden,
Nozzlemen; it was also decided that meetings were to be held at 8:00  on
the first Monday evening of each month, a tradition still practiced; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  current Fire Chief is Steve Stephens, and the current
President of the Company is Christopher  D.  DePew,  a  third-generation
Kerhonkson  Fireman  in  his  40th year of service, Past Chief, and Life
Member; Kerhonkson is  a  small,  multi-generational  hamlet  where  its
constituents are proud members of their community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  Kerhonkson  Volunteer Fire Company's 100 years of
service, there have been only 19 Fire Chiefs, proving the commitment  of
these  devoted  members;  the  Kerhonkson  Volunteer  Fire  Company  now
includes 84 men and women  who  selflessly  and  tirelessly  ensure  the
safety of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With a membership of dedicated firefighters, the record of
the Kerhonkson  Volunteer  Fire  Company  in  public  service  and  fire
protection  is one to be applauded; for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
for 100 years, whenever the alarm sounded, these noble  volunteers  left
their homes and went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave  firefighters  of the Kerhonkson Volunteer Fire
Company are prepared to risk their lives every  day  to  help  save  the
 
lives  of  others and to protect homes and property from the destruction
caused by fire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition to the skill and devoted service demonstrated
by  individual  firefighters,  the  Kerhonkson  Volunteer  Fire  Company
reflects  the  history and development of firefighting over the past 100
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment of their communities and publicly acknowledge the heroic good
works  performed  by the volunteer fire departments of this great Empire
State, their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly  commemorate  the  100th Anniversary of the Kerhonkson Volunteer
Fire Company on December 26, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the members of the Kerhonkson Volunteer Fire Company.
