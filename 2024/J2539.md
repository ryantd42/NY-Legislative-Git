  Scouts of NYPENN Pathways Council on May 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Diane  Bootie  upon the occasion of being named to the Volunteer Hall of

  WHEREAS,  This esteemed honor recognizes a volunteer with a lifetime
commitment to the Girl Scout  Movement  within  Girl  Scouts  of  NYPENN
Pathways; Diane Bootie is one such individual, having sustained GSNYPENN
in  various  ways  including  supporting  Girl  Scouts in the community,
volunteering in a variety of roles and  the  financial  support  of  the
council; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Diane  Bootie  became  a Girl Scout volunteer 43 years ago
when her daughter expressed her desire to join the organization;  during
this  time,  there was not a local troop in their area, so Diane stepped
up to form a troop and became its leader; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since then, Diane Bootie has held various  volunteer  roles
including  troop  leader,  service  unit manager, recruiter, trainer and
product program coordinator; she makes it possible for  anyone  to  join
Girl Scouts regardless of background or ability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  her  more  than  four decades of steadfast and
unwavering service, members of Diane's numerous  troops  have  benefited
greatly  from  her  extensive  knowledge,  experience  and  unwavering
dedication; she has held every volunteer role in her Service  Unit,  and
has gone above and beyond to serve wherever needed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  when  her  former  council  was  at  risk of
canceling summer camp, Diane Bootie served as its camp health supervisor
for two years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Diane Bootie is an  active  recruiter  for  her  community,
reaching  out to the school district, handing out flyers, attending open
houses and promoting Girl Scouts whenever possible; she has also trained
and mentored many GSNYPENN volunteers as an adult facilitator; and
 
  WHEREAS, This extraordinary woman is also part of GSNYPENN's History
& Archives Committee; she continues to archive  and  coordinate  council
and  Girl  Scout  history,  and  works  to  ensure  it  is preserved and
maintained; and
 
  WHEREAS, She played an instrumental role in revamping the  council's
heritage  and fashion trunks and the Honoring Our Heritage program which
are now available to all troops across the council; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Diane  Bootie's  dedication  and  hard  work  have  had an
immeasurable impact on the success of GSNYPENN; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by  an
individual  for  the  benefit of others which Diane Bootie has displayed
throughout her life; and
 
  WHEREAS, It has always been the objective of this  Legislative  Body
to  honor  and  support  those  individuals  who  have  displayed  their
commitment to the betterment of their communities, and it is the  intent
of  this  Legislative Body to inscribe upon its records, this tribute to
Diane Bootie, that  future  generations  may  know  and  appreciate  her
admirable  character,  her  many  benevolent  deeds, and the respect and
esteem in which she is held by her peers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Diane  Bootie  upon  the occasion of being named to the Volunteer
Hall of Fame by the Girl Scouts of NYPENN Pathways Council  on  May  14,
2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
