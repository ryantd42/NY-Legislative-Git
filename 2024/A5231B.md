 A. 5231  3
 
  §  3. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth day after an internal
 revenue service ruling stating that the transfer and crediting of deputy
 sheriff service credit from the New  York  state  and  local  employees'
 retirement  system  into  the  New  York state and local police and fire
 retirement  system  special retirement plan by this act is allowable and
 does not jeopardize such retirement system's tax-qualified  status,  and
 shall  remain  in full force and effect only as long as such transfer is
 authorized pursuant to the provisions  of  the  internal  revenue  code;
 provided,  that  the state comptroller shall notify the legislative bill
 drafting commission upon the occurrence of  such  ruling  and  upon  any
 change  in  the  provisions  of  the internal revenue code affecting the
 provisions of this act in order that  the  commission  may  maintain  an
 accurate and timely effective data base of the official text of the laws
 of  the  state of New York in furtherance of effecting the provisions of
 section 44 of the legislative law and section 70-b of the  public  offi-
 cers law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  expand  the  definition of creditable service under
 20-year and 25-year plans (special plans) in  the  New  York  State  and
 Local Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS) to include service credit
 earned  in  the  New  York  State and Local Employees' Retirement System
 (ERS) for those individuals previously employed in the title  of  Deputy
 Sheriff.  To be eligible for the service credit, an individual must be a
 member of the PFRS and elect to transfer the ERS service credit  to  the
 PFRS  plan  within  12  months  of  first joining the PFRS, or within 12
 months of the effective date of the bill, whichever is later. The amount
 of service credit granted in the PFRS special plan will be calculated by
 the Actuary of the New York State and Local Retirement System  (NYLSRS),
 not to exceed the service credited under the ERS plan.
  Insofar  as this bill affects the PFRS, if this legislation is enacted
 during the 2023 legislative  session  it  is  estimated  that  the  past
 service  cost  will  average  approximately  21  percent  of an affected
 member's compensation for each year of additional service that is grant-
 ed.
  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  plan  qualification  issues:  granting
 service  credit  towards  retirement  in  a 20-year plan in the PFRS for
 employment that was not  rendered  in  the  PFRS  could  jeopardize  the
 Retirement  System's governmental plan status and its exemption from the
 Employees Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). This development could
 result in the loss of qualified status, which would mean the loss of tax
 benefits. This result would substantially impair the Retirement System's
 value to our more than one million participants.
  This legislation will not become effective until the NYLSRS obtains  a
 favorable  ruling  from  the IRS stating that these provisions would not
 harm the qualification status of the  Retirement  System.  Further,  the
 provisions  of  this  legislation  will  only continue in full force and
 effect while so authorized by the IRS. It is estimated that the costs to
 obtain an initial ruling would be $38,000 for the services of  the  IRS,
 and $1,000 per hour for legal consultants.
  In addition to the costs to obtain a ruling from the IRS stated above,
 if  this bill is enacted, there will be an administrative cost to imple-
 ment the provisions of this legislation.
  All costs will be shared by the  State  of  New  York  and  all  local
 participating employers in the PFRS.
