 may convey to the town of Arietta twenty-eight acres of forest  preserve

 certain land owned by such town in the town of Arietta.  Notwithstanding
 the  foregoing  provisions  and  subject  to legislative approval of the
 tracts to be exchanged prior to the actual transfer of title, the state,

 convey  to International Paper Company approximately eight thousand five
 hundred acres of forest preserve land located in townships two and three
 of Totten and Crossfield Purchase and township nine of the  Moose  River

 preserve  approximately  the same number of acres of land located within
 such townships and such County on condition that the  legislature  shall
 determine  that the lands to be received by the state are at least equal

 foregoing  provisions  and subject to legislative approval of the tracts
 to be exchanged prior to the actual transfer of title and the conditions
 herein set forth, the state, in order to facilitate the preservation  of
 historic buildings listed on the national register of historic places by
 rejoining  an historic grouping of buildings under unitary ownership and
 stewardship, may convey to Sagamore  Institute  Inc.,  a  not-for-profit
 educational  organization, approximately ten acres of land and buildings
 thereon adjoining the real property of the Sagamore Institute, Inc.  and
 located  on  Sagamore  Road,  near Raquette Lake Village, in the Town of

 ty to be received by the state is at least equal in value to the land to
 be conveyed by the state.
  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions and subject to legislative
 approval prior to actual transfer of title, because there is  no  viable
 alternative  to  using  forest preserve lands for the siting of drinking
 water wells and necessary  appurtenances  and  because  such  wells  are
 necessary to meet drinking water quality standards, the state may convey
 to  the  town of Long Lake, Hamilton county, one acre of forest preserve
 land within such town for public use as the site of such drinking  water
 wells and necessary appurtenances for the municipal water supply for the
 hamlet  of  Raquette  Lake.  In exchange therefor, the town of Long Lake
 shall convey to the state at least  twelve  acres  of  land  located  in
 Hamilton  county  for  incorporation  into  the forest preserve that the
 legislature shall determine is at least equal in value to the land to be
 conveyed by the state. The Raquette  Lake  surface  reservoir  shall  be
 abandoned as a drinking water supply source.
  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions and subject to legislative
 approval prior to actual transfer of title,  the  state  may  convey  to

 on  condition  that the legislature shall determine that the property to
 be received by the state is at least equal in value to the land conveyed

  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the legislature may  author-
 ize the settlement, according to terms determined by the legislature, of
 title  disputes in township forty, Totten and Crossfield purchase in the
 town of Long Lake, Hamilton county, to resolve longstanding and  compet-
 ing  claims of title between the state and private parties in said town-
 ship, provided that prior to, and as a  condition  of  such  settlement,
 land purchased without the use of state-appropriated funds, and suitable
 for  incorporation  in  the  forest preserve within the Adirondack park,
 shall be conveyed to the state on the  condition  that  the  legislature
 S. 5540  4
 
 shall  determine  that  the  property  to be conveyed to the state shall
 provide a net benefit to the forest preserve as compared to the township
 forty lands subject to such settlement.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the state may authorize NYCO
 Minerals,  Inc.  to engage in mineral sampling operations, solely at its
 expense, to determine  the  quantity  and  quality  of  wollastonite  on
 approximately  200  acres  of  forest  preserve land contained in lot 8,
 Stowers survey, town of Lewis, Essex county provided that NYCO Minerals,
 Inc. shall provide the data and information derived from  such  drilling
 to  the state for appraisal purposes. Subject to legislative approval of
 the tracts to be exchanged prior to the actual transfer  of  title,  the
 state may subsequently convey said lot 8 to NYCO Minerals, Inc., and, in
 exchange  therefor,  NYCO  Minerals,  Inc. shall convey to the state for
 incorporation into the forest preserve not less than the same number  of
 acres  of  land,  on condition that the legislature shall determine that
 the lands to be received by the state are equal to or greater  than  the
 value  of the land to be conveyed by the state and on condition that the
 assessed value of the land to be conveyed to the state shall  total  not
 less  than  one million dollars. When NYCO Minerals, Inc. terminates all
 mining operations on such lot 8 it shall remediate the site  and  convey
 title  to  such  lot  back to the state of New York for inclusion in the
 forest preserve. In the event  that  lot  8  is  not  conveyed  to  NYCO
 Minerals,  Inc.  pursuant to this paragraph, NYCO Minerals, Inc.  never-
 theless shall convey to the state  for  incorporation  into  the  forest
 preserve  not  less  than  the  same  number  of  acres  of land that is
 disturbed by any mineral sampling  operations conducted on  said  lot  8
 pursuant  to  this  paragraph  on  condition  that the legislature shall
 determine that the lands to be received by the state  are  equal  to  or
 greater  than  the  value of the lands disturbed by the mineral sampling
 operations.
  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions and  subject  to  legislative
 approval  prior to actual transfer of title, a total of no more than two
 hundred fifty acres of forest preserve land shall be used for the estab-
 lishment of a health and safety land account. Where no  viable  alterna-
 tive  exists  and other criteria developed by the legislature are satis-
 fied, a town, village  or  county  may  apply,  pursuant  to  a  process
 determined by the legislature, to the health and safety land account for
 projects  limited to:  address bridge hazards or safety on county high-
 ways, and town highways listed on the local highway inventory maintained
 by the department of transportation,  dedicated,  and  in  existence  on
 January  first,  two thousand fifteen, and annually plowed and regularly
