 the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  (d) Except during storms, floods, fires or other  public  emergencies,
 no  such  permit  may  be issued to include a towing operation involving
 more than two vehicles except three vehicle combinations consisting of a

 sary by the issuing authority. Every such permit shall be carried on the
 vehicle to which it refers and shall be open to the  inspection  of  any
 peace officer, acting pursuant to his special duties, or police officer,

 permits  issued  shall be revocable by the authority issuing them at the

 ing  cause.  Except  for  a  vehicle  having  a maximum gross weight not
 exceeding eighty thousand pounds without regard to any axle weight limi-

 prescribed in this section other than an annual permit  issued  pursuant
 to  paragraph  (f)  of  this  subdivision  except  upon a finding by the
 department  of  transportation or the appropriate authority, as the case
 may be, that the load proposed is of one  piece  or  item  or  otherwise
 cannot  be  separated  into units of less weight provided, however, that
 any such permit issued upon such finding shall  not  be  valid  for  the
 operation  or  movement  of  such vehicles on any state or other highway

  The  department  of  transportation,  or  other issuing authority, may
 issue an annual permit for a vehicle designed and constructed  to  carry
 loads  that  are  not  of one piece or item, which is registered in this
 state. Motor carriers having apportioned vehicles registered  under  the
 international  registration  plan  must  either  have  a currently valid
 permit at the time this provision becomes effective or shall have desig-
 nated New York as its base state or one of the eligible jurisdictions of
 operation under the international  registration  plan  in  order  to  be
 eligible  to  receive a permit issued pursuant to subparagraph (i), (ii)
 or (ii-a) of this paragraph. [No]  SUBJECT  TO  PARAGRAPH  (L)  OF  THIS
 SUBDIVISION,  NO permit issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be valid
 for the operation or movement of vehicles on any state or other  highway
 within any city not wholly included within one county unless such permit
 was issued by the city department of transportation of such city.
  §  3.  Subdivision 15 of section 385 of the vehicle and traffic law is
 amended by adding a new paragraph (l) to read as follows:
  (L) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LAW, LOCAL LAW, RULE,  OR  REGULATION  TO  THE
 CONTRARY,  ANY  VEHICLE  WHICH: (I) HAS BEEN ISSUED A PERMIT PURSUANT TO
 SUBDIVISION FIFTEEN OF THIS SECTION; (II) IS TRANSPORTING ROAD SALT; AND
 (III) DOES NOT HAVE A GROSS VEHICLE  WEIGHT  RATING  IN  EXCESS  OF  ONE
 HUNDRED  SEVEN  THOUSAND  POUNDS,  SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO OPERATE ON ALL
