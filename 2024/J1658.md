  MOURNING  the  death  of  Matthew  Thomas  Peter,

  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
citizens of the State of New York  whose  lifework  and  civic  endeavor
served to enhance the quality of life in their communities and the great
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  December  14,  2023, the City of Albany lost a beloved
resident  and  community  leader  when  County  Legislator  and  Parking
Authority Executive Director Matthew Thomas Peter passed away at the age
of 38; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Matthew Peter was born on July 25, 1985, in Manhasset, New
York to William Peter and Nancy (Flacks) Peter; he  first  came  to  the
capital  city  to attend State University of New York at Albany where he
earned his bachelor's and master's degrees  and  spent  his  adult  life
working to make Albany better; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  working  in  the  Governor's  Office,  the  State
Department of Taxation and Finance, and the State Senate, Matthew  Peter
ran  Kathy Sheehan's inaugural race for mayor and later became her first
Chief of Staff; in 2016, he became  Executive  Director  of  the  Albany
Parking  Authority, where he took pride in making it profitable and used
his position as a vehicle for improving conditions in the city; and
 
  WHEREAS, Growing up in suburban Long Island made Matthew Peter a big
believer in urban living, but he missed the bagels from his hometown; he
most recently called Center Square in Albany his home and was a champion
for the Lark Street community; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2019, Matthew Peter was appointed to the  Albany  County
Legislature representing the Fifth District; he was elected to that post
twice, most recently November of 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Matthew  Peter spearheaded beautification efforts with the

modernized  and  expanded  the power of the Parking Authority passed and
signed into law; and
 
  WHEREAS, Matthew Peter  was  universally  respected  in  the  County
Legislature where his work ethic, intelligence, and intellectual honesty
earned him admirers from across the political spectrum; he believed that
government  could  be a force of positive change and politics is the art
of addition, not subtraction; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally, Matthew Peter believed a society can only  be
truly  judged  by how it treats the least fortunate among us; during the
COVID-19 pandemic, he co-founded Feed Albany to help ensure no one  went
hungry  during that crisis; in the County Legislature, he championed new
policies that provided  treatment  for  those  with  mental  health  and
substance abuse issues who encounter police; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Matthew Peter also served on the boards of Park Playhouse,
Capitalize Albany, and the Albany  County  Visitors  Bureau;  he  was  a
dedicated member of the Democratic Party, serving as Albany County Young
Democrats  President,  Capital Region President, and New York State Vice
President; he was an  Albany  County  Democratic  Committee  member  for
nearly 10 years and served as the Ward Leader for the 6th Ward; and
 
  WHEREAS, Above all else, Matthew Peter loved his friends and family;
he  showed  his  love  through  acts of service and quality time, as was
reflected in the always-open door to his home, with  a  meal  and  drink
offered  to  all who entered, and in his immense generosity and kindness
to everyone he knew, as well as to those he did not; and
 
  WHEREAS, Making the most of every second and turning every day  into
an adventure and a celebration of being alive, Matthew Peter would throw
a  party  just  for  the sake of it and held tight his traditions; every
birthday, anniversary, holiday, Sunday dinner, beach week,  weekend,  or
day  trip  was  an event and he made it specific and special for all who
came along for the ride; and
 
  WHEREAS, Matthew Peter is survived by his adored fiance, Dr. Corinne
McLeod;  parents,  Bill  and  Nancy  Peter;  sister,  Sara  Peter  (Pete
Uzarwoski);  brother,  Brian  Peter;  niece  and  goddaughter, Gabriella
Fanti; aunt, Peggy Figueroa (Emil); uncles, Edward and Thomas Peter; his
beloved canine companion, Athena; and friends,  Amal  Jacobson,  Jessica
Giordano,  Richard  Azzopardi,  Abigail  Barker,  Brian  Shea, and Becky
English; and
 
  WHEREAS, Matthew Peter's infinite selflessness and benevolence  will
shine on through his friends' and family's vivid and happy memories; his
insight  and strength will forever serve as a beacon of love, light, and
hope to the countless lives he touched; and
 
  WHEREAS, Armed with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a  sense  of
compassion,  Matthew Peter leaves behind a legacy which will long endure
the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory  to  all  who
were  privileged to have known and loved such an amazing man; he will be
deeply missed and truly merits the grateful tribute of this  Legislative
Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
mourn the death of  Matthew  Thomas  Peter,  cherished  family  man  and
devoted public servant; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Matthew Thomas Peter.
