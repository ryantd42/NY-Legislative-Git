  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 207 of the education law  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  § 207. Legislative power.  1. Subject and in conformity to the consti-
 tution  and  laws  of  the state, the regents shall exercise legislative
 functions concerning the educational system of the state, determine  its
 educational  policies,  and, except, as to the judicial functions of the
 commissioner of education, establish rules for carrying into effect  the
 laws  and  policies  of  the state, relating to education, and the func-
 tions, powers, duties and trusts conferred or charged upon the universi-
 ty and the education department.  But no enactment of the regents  shall
 modify  in  any degree the freedom of the governing body of any seminary
 for the training of priests or clergymen to determine and  regulate  the
 entire  course  of religious, doctrinal or theological instruction to be
 given in such institution.  No rule by which more than a  majority  vote
 shall  be  required  for  any  specified  action by the regents shall be
 amended, suspended or repealed by a smaller vote than that required  for
 action thereunder.  Rules or regulations, or amendments or repeals ther-
 eof,  adopted or prescribed by the commissioner of education as provided
 by law shall not be effective unless and until approved by the  regents,
 except where authority is conferred by the regents upon the commissioner
 of  education  to  adopt, prescribe, amend or repeal such rules or regu-
 lations.
