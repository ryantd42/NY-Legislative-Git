 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Halesite Fire District to file  an
  application for exemption from real property taxes
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Huntington, county  of  Suffolk,  is  hereby
 authorized to accept from the Halesite Fire District, an application for
 exemption  from  real property taxes pursuant to section 464 of the real
 property tax law with respect to the 2022-2023 assessment roll, for  the
 parcels  owned  by such organization, with such parcels being located at
 10 New York avenue, in the town of Huntington, county of Suffolk, other-
 wise known as Suffolk county tax  map  district  0400,  section  031.00,
 block 02.00, lot 019.000.
  If  accepted,  the  application  shall  be  reviewed as if it had been
 received on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
 If satisfied that such organization would otherwise be entitled to  such
 exemption if such organization had filed an application for exemption by
 the  appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon approval by the
 town of Huntington board, may grant exemption from all taxation and make
 appropriate corrections to the subject roll. If such exemption is grant-
 ed and such organization therefore shall have paid any tax with  respect
 to  the  subject  roll,  the applicable governing body or tax department
 may, in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of the  taxes  paid,
 along  with  any  fines  or penalties paid, and cancel any taxes, fines,
 penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
