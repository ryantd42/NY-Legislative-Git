  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions,  to  recognize  and  pay tribute to those
organizations which foster ethnic  pride  and  enhance  the  profile  of
cultural  diversity  which  strengthens the fabric of the communities of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it is the intent of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  November  30,  2024,  as
Barbados Flag Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Barbados National Flag is a symbol of pride and unity
for the Caribbean island nation of  Barbados;  it  represents  the  rich
history, vibrant culture, and strong values of the Bajan people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Barbados National Flag has a captivating history that
dates back to its independence from British colonial  rule  on  November
30,  1966,  making  it  one  of  the  earliest  English colonies to gain
sovereignty; Barbados Flag Day commemorates this historic  event;  prior
to  that,  Barbados  used  a  different  flag  design, known as the Blue
Ensign; and
 
  WHEREAS, The introduction of the new national flag  represented  the
nation's  determination to forge its own path and was a significant step
towards asserting Barbados' identity as an independent nation; the  flag
became  a  powerful  symbol  of  liberation  and  the  resilience of the
Barbadian people; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Barbados National Flag features a tricolor design  with
three  equal  vertical  bands of ultramarine blue, gold, and ultramarine
blue; in the center of the gold band, there is  a  broken  trident,  the
national emblem of Barbados; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  flag's  design carries deep symbolism that represents
various aspects of the country's heritage and aspirations; and
 
  WHEREAS, The colors of the  Barbados  National  Flag  hold  symbolic
significance;  the  ultramarine  blue represents the sea surrounding the
island, symbolizing Barbados' position as a maritime  nation;  the  gold
band  signifies  the  golden sands of Barbados' beaches and the sunshine
that bathes the island throughout the year; and
 
  WHEREAS, The broken trident at the center of the  Barbados  National
Flag  represents  Barbados'  break  from  its  colonial  past  and  its
transition to an independent nation; the three  points  of  the  trident
symbolize democracy, independence, and self-government; and
 
  WHEREAS, Barbados celebrates National Flag Day on November 30th each
year; this day is dedicated to honoring the significance of the national
 
flag and recognizing its role in shaping the country's identity; various
events  and  activities take place across the island to commemorate this
special day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Barbados National Flag holds great importance for the
people of Barbados; it serves as a powerful symbol  of  national  pride,
unity,  and  identity;  the flag evokes a sense of belonging and loyalty
among Barbadians, fostering a strong bond with their homeland; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of  this  Legislative  Body  to  urge  the
citizens  of  New  York State to join those of Barbadian backgrounds, in
recognition of the ties between the State of New York and  Barbados,  as
they  rejoice in the accomplishments of their ancestors by memorializing
November 30, 2024, as Barbados Flag Day; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim November 30, 2024, as
Barbados Flag Day in the State of New York; and be it further
