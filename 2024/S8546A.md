 AN ACT in relation to  requiring  certain  renewable  energy  generating
  projects to enter into a memorandum of understanding for the operation
  and maintenance of such project with a bona fide labor organization
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Every renewable energy generating project receiving grants,
 guaranteed loans, tax benefits or funding from  New  York  state,  shall
 demonstrate  that  the developer or other entities owning such renewable
 energy generating project has entered into a memorandum of understanding
 for the operation and maintenance of such project with a bona fide labor
 organization of jurisdiction that is actively  engaged  in  representing
 transitioning utility workers in the fossil fuel industry. Such memoran-
 dum  shall  be entered into prior to the completion date of such project
 and the memorandum shall be an ongoing material  condition  of  authori-
 zation  to operate and maintain the renewable energy project.  The memo-
 randum shall only apply to employees necessary for the  maintenance  and
 operation  of  such renewable energy generation project. Such memorandum
 shall contain, but not be limited to,  safety  and  training  standards,
 disaster  response measures, guaranteed hours, staffing levels, pay rate
 protection and retraining programs.
  § 2. 1. The department of labor and the New York state energy research
 and development authority, in consultation with renewable energy  indus-
 try  stakeholders,  shall  issue  a report no later than the one hundred
 twentieth day after the effective date of this act that  identifies  the
 job  titles  and skill sets required to maintain and operate any and all
 renewable generation facilities and technologies approved by  law.  Such
 report shall be updated annually.
  2.  Within one hundred twenty days after such report required pursuant
 to subdivision one of this section is issued, the department  of  labor,

 in consultation with affected bona fide labor organizations of jurisdic-
 tion  in  the  utility  industry,  shall compile a list of transitioning
 workers, who have lost their employment or will be losing their  employ-
 ment  in the fossil fuel energy sector. Such list shall be updated quar-
 terly.
  3. Within six months after the effective date of this act, the depart-
 ment of labor shall, in  consultation  with  renewable  energy  industry
 stakeholders  and affected bona fide labor organizations of jurisdiction
 in the utility industry, create a workforce development  program,  which
 shall provide training and retraining to those transitioning fossil-fuel
 workers.  Such  program,  at a minimum, shall address the job titles and
 skill sets, as identified by the report required pursuant to subdivision
 one of this section, necessary to qualify for  renewable  energy  gener-
 ation  operation and maintenance positions and shall offer a combination
 of on-the-job training, where  applicable,  and  classroom  job  related
 instruction to transitioning workers.
  4. The transitioning workers, identified by the list compiled pursuant
 to subdivision two of this section and which have successfully completed
 the  department of labor workforce development program, if it exists, as
 created and required by subdivision three  of  this  section,  shall  be
 offered  to  first,  any  and all operation and maintenance positions at
 renewable energy generating projects receiving grants, guaranteed loans,
 tax benefits or funding from New York state. Should there be  no  candi-
 dates  available  from  the  list  of  transitioning  workers which have
 completed such program such renewable energy generating project may hire
 transitioning workers off  such  list  which  have  not  completed  such
 program.  The  department of labor shall make such list available to the
 New York state energy research and development authority and any and all
 renewable energy generating project receiving grants, guaranteed  loans,
 tax  benefits  or funding from New York state upon award of such govern-
 ment assistance and ninety days prior to completion of such project.
  § 3.  This act shall take effect immediately.
