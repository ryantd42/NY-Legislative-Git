 spending from federal grants for any grant period beginning, during,  or
 prior  to,  the  state  fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2024 except as
 otherwise noted.
  c) The several amounts named herein, or so much thereof  as  shall  be
 sufficient  to  accomplish the purpose designated, being the undisbursed
 and/or unexpended balances of the prior year's appropriations, are here-
 by reappropriated from the same funds and made available  for  the  same
 purposes  as the prior year's appropriations, unless herein amended, for
 the fiscal year beginning April 1,  2024.  Certain  reappropriations  in

 change is clearly indicated by the use of brackets [ ] for deletions and
 underscores for additions, the purposes, amounts, funding source and all
 other aspects pertinent to each item of appropriation shall be  as  last

  For  the  purpose  of  complying with the state finance law, the year,
 chapter and section of the last act reappropriating  a  former  original
 appropriation  or any part thereof is, unless otherwise indicated, chap-
 ter 53, section 1, of the laws of 2023.

 payment  until a certificate of approval has been issued by the director
 of the budget, who shall file such certificate with  the  department  of
 audit  and  control, the chairperson of the senate finance committee and
 the chairperson of the assembly ways and means committee.
  e) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, for  purposes
 of  any  appropriation made by this chapter which authorizes spending in
 an amount net of refunds, rebates, reimbursements, credits,  repayments,
 and/or  disallowances,  "refunds" shall mean funds received to the state
 resulting from the overpayment of monies,  "rebates"  shall  mean  funds
 received  to  the  state  resulting  from  a return of a full or partial
 amount  previously  paid,  as  for  goods  or  services,  serving  as  a
 reduction,  discount  or  rebate  to  the  original  payment  amount,
 "reimbursements" shall mean funds received to the state as repayment  in
 an equivalent amount for goods or services, including but not limited to
 personal  service  costs,  incurred  by  the state in the first instance
 being provided to a third party for their benefit and  partially  or  in

 available to the state that reduce the amount owed  to  a  third  party,
 including but not limited to billing errors, rebates, and prior overpay-
 ments,  "repayment"  shall  mean  the  return  of monies as pay back for
 expenses incurred, and "disallowance" shall mean monies  made  available
 to  the  state  that  were  not  allowed  or  accepted officially by the
 intended recipient, based on a determination the payment is not accepta-
 ble and/or valid. When the office of the state comptroller receives  any
 such  refunds,  rebates,  reimbursements,  credits,  repayments,  and/or
 disallowances, he or she shall credit the refunded, rebated, reimbursed,
 credited, repaid, and disallowed amount back to the  original  appropri-
 ation  and reduce expenditures in the year which such credit is received
 regardless of the timing of the initial expenditure.
  f) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,  upon  enact-
 ment  of  this chapter of the laws of 2024 containing the aid to locali-
 ties budget bill for the state fiscal year 2024-2025, all appropriations
 and reappropriations contained in chapter 53 of the laws of 2023,  which

  ers  and  to  establish criteria governing the award of such grants.
  For the purposes of this  grant  program,  "socially  disadvantaged"

  virtue of their membership of a particular group which may  include,
  but  not be limited to Black or African American, American Indian or
  Alaska Native, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian  or  Pacific  Islander;
  "economically disadvantaged" shall mean socially disadvantaged indi-
  viduals whose ability to enter into farming or whose farm enterprise
  has been impaired due to diminished capital, credit opportunities or
  access  to  land, among other things, as compared to other similarly
  situated individuals who are not socially disadvantaged.
  Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to, farmers  who  will
  materially  and substantially participate in operating a farm within
  the state and may include urban farmers. Grants shall be awarded  on
  a  competitive  basis.  Grants  shall not be less than five thousand
  dollars and may not exceed two hundred and  fifty  thousand  dollars
  for  any  single beneficiary. Grants shall be issued with a required
  match from the recipient of no more than twenty percent of the grant
  amount.

  palities,  public  benefit  corporations,  local  development corpo-
  rations, or  not-for-profit  organizations  that  provide  financial
  assistance,  including  capital assistance for the administration of
  the grant program. Up to fifteen percent of the total  appropriation
  amount  may  be made available for the services and expenses of such
  organization directly related to the  administration  of  the  grant
  program.  Such  grants  may  be awarded to socially and economically
  disadvantaged farmers for purposes including, but  not  limited  to,
  the  start-up,  improvement or expansion of a farm operation, worker
  or apprenticeship training, marketing activities,  the  purchase  of

  appropriation:
  (1) For eligible school districts, the preliminary slot count shall be
  equal to the positive difference of (1) the product  of  0.3504  and
  unserved  4-year-old  prekindergarten  pupils calculated pursuant to

  day prekindergarten programs funded by grants  pursuant  to  section
  3602-ee of education law in the 2019-20 school year. If such prelim-
  inary slot count is less than 10, the expansion slots shall be 0; if
  such  preliminary slot count is greater than or equal to 10 but less
  than 20, the expansion slots shall be 20;  for  all  other  eligible
  districts,  the  expansion  slots  shall  equal the preliminary slot

  itures  associated  with  local compliance
  with the federal Family  First  Prevention

  reimbursement from the amount appropriated
  herein shall not be available for  tuition
  expenditures  for foster children, includ-
  ing persons in  need  of  supervision  and
  adjudicated  juvenile delinquents, made by
  a social services district located  within
  a  city having a population of one million
  or more.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of  law,
  a  portion  of  the funds are available to
  reimburse social  services  districts  for
  the  change in the maximum state aid rates
  established by the office of children  and
  family  services for the 2024-25 rate year
  pursuant to section 398-a  of  the  social
  services law and sections 4003 and 4405 of
  the education law to reflect the continua-
  tion  of  the  cost  of living adjustments
  that became effective April  1,  2008  for
  payments  made  to  foster parents and for
  salary and fringe benefit costs and  other
  critical  nonpersonal  services  costs for
  foster care programs as determined by  the
  office.  Social  services  districts  must
  adjust the amount  of  payments  made  for
  care  provided  by  congregate  care  and
  foster  boarding  home  programs  and  to
  foster  parents  to  reflect  the  cost of
  living adjustments in the manner specified

  the time and in a manner to be  determined
  by  the  office,  a written certification,
  attesting that the funds received for  the
  continuation of the cost of living adjust-

  ment  to  the  maximum state aid rate that
  became effective April 1,  2008  for  that
  program  will  be  or  were used solely in
  accordance  with  the  requirements of the
  cost of living adjustment  established  by
  the office.
 Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent provision
  of law including, but not limited to,  any
  chapter of the laws of 2024 which enacts a
  cost  of  living  adjustment for the state
  fiscal year beginning on  April  1,  2024,
  the  commissioner  shall continue to apply
  any cost of living adjustment increase  in
  effect  on  March  31, 2024 for the entire
  rate year that began  when  such  cost  of
  living  adjustment increase was in effect.
  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision
  of law, the commissioner shall apply a 1.5
  percent cost of living adjustment for  the
  rate  year that begins on July 1, 2024 for
  the  purposes  of  establishing  rates  of
  payments,  contracts, or any other form of
  reimbursement, provided  that  this  shall
  not prevent the commissioner from applying
  additional  trend  or  staff  retention
  factors for this program.
 Within  the  amounts  appropriated  herein,
  state  reimbursement  to  each  social
  services district for services  identified
  herein  that are otherwise reimbursable by
  the state from April 1, 2024 through March
  31, 2025 shall be limited  to  a  district
  allocation, hereinafter referred to as the
  district's  block  grant  allocation.
  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of
  law,  such block grant allocation shall be
  based, in part, on each district's  claims
  for such costs, adjusted by the applicable
  cost allocation methodology and net of any
  retroactive  payments  for  the  12  month
  period  ending  June  30,  2023  that  are
  submitted  on  or  before  January 2, 2024
  and, in part, on  such  other  factors  as
  determined  by  the office of children and
  family services and approved by the direc-
  tor of the budget. Any portion of a social
  services district's allocation from  funds
  appropriated  herein  not  claimed by such
  district during the state fiscal year  may
  be  used by such district for expenditures
  on preventive services  provided  pursuant
  366  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE
  OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  to  section  409-a  of the social services
  law,  independent  living  services  and
  aftercare  services  provided  pursuant to
  regulations  of  the  department of family
  assistance,  claimed  by  such  district
  during  the  next  state fiscal year up to
  the amount remaining from  the  district's
  foster  care  block  grant  allocation,
  provided however, that any claims for such
  services during the next state fiscal year
  in excess of such amount shall be  subject
  to  62  percent state reimbursement exclu-
  sive of any federal funds  made  available
  for  such  purposes,  in  accordance  with
  directives of  the  department  of  family
  assistance  and subject to the approval of
  the director of  the  budget.  Any  claims
  submitted  by  a  social services district
  for reimbursement for a  particular  state
  fiscal  year for which the social services
  district does not receive state or federal
  reimbursement  during  that  state  fiscal
  year  may  not  be  claimed  against  that
  district's block grant  apportionment  for
  the next state fiscal year.
 The  office of children and family services,
  with the approval of the director  of  the
  budget,  may  reduce  a  district's  block
  grant  allocation  by  the  state  share
  decrease  related  to  federal retroactive
  reimbursement  for  such  foster  care
  services  identified  herein.  The office,
  with the approval of the director  of  the
  budget,  may  reduce  a  district's  block
  grant allocation by  the  state  share  of
  disallowances  or  sanctions taken against
  the  district  pursuant  to  the  social
  services law or federal law.
 Notwithstanding  any other provision of law,
  the state shall  not  be  responsible  for
  reimbursing a social services district and
  a district shall not seek state reimburse-
  ment  for  any portion of any state disal-
  lowance  or  sanction  taken  against  the
  social  services  district, or any federal
  disallowance attributable to final federal
  agency decisions or to settlement made, on
  or after July 1, 1995, when such disallow-
  ance or sanction results from the  failure
  of  the social services district to comply
  with  federal  or  state  requirements,
  367  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE
  OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  including,  but not limited to, failure to
  document eligibility for federal or  state
  funds in the case record; provided, howev-
  er,  if  the  office  determines  that any
  federal disallowance for services provided
  between January 1, 1999 and May  31,  1999
  results  solely from the late enactment of
  the  state  legislation  implementing  the
  federal  adoption  and  safe families act,
  the state shall be solely responsible  for
  the  full  amount  of  the disallowance or
  sanction; provided, further, however, this
  provision shall be deemed  to  apply  both
  prospectively and retroactively regardless
  of whether such sanctions or disallowances
  are  for  services provided or claims made
  prior to or after April 1, 2024.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of  law,
  any  federal disallowance resulting from a
  federal title IV-E eligibility  review  or
  audit  that  uses  extrapolated  statistic
  techniques shall be passed  along  by  the
  state  to  any  and  all  social  services
  districts that the office of children  and
  family  services  has  determined have not
  complied with the title  IV-E  eligibility
  requirements  or have not taken the neces-
  sary actions  to  ensure  compliance  with
  such  requirements  including,  but  not
  limited to, failing to: assess  and  fully
  document all the criteria and have readily
  available  all  the necessary documents to
  establish and continue title  IV-E  eligi-
  bility  for  all title IV-E eligible chil-
  dren  within  the  required  time  frames;
  claim  title  IV-E  funding only for cases
  that meet all of the title IV-E  eligibil-
  ity  criteria;  and  fully  implement  the
  social  services  payment  system  on  or
  before  April  1,  2005 for all direct and
  voluntary agency foster care services.
 Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the
  office of  children  and  family  services
  shall  impose on social services districts
  any federal  disallowance  issued  against
  the  state  as a result of a federal title
  IV-E secondary eligibility review  regard-
  less  of  the  date  the children may have
  entered foster care, the date  the  eligi-
  bility  or payment errors occurred, or the
  filing date  of  any  federal  claims  for
  368  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE
  OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  reimbursement; provided, however, that the
  state  shall be responsible for the disal-
  lowed costs and  expenditures  related  to
  the  placement  of  children in a facility
  operated by the  office  of  children  and
  family services, which shall be determined
  in the same manner as the disallowed costs
  and  expenditures  for  social  services
  districts other than the city of New York.
  In order to reimburse the federal  govern-
  ment  for the full amount of any disallow-
  ance imposed on the state by  the  federal
  administration  for  children and families
  within the timeframes necessary  to  avoid
  any  potential  interest  payments on such
  amount, the office of children and  family
  services  is  authorized  to  immediately
  offset  funds  otherwise  due  to  each
  district for a pro rata share of the total
  disallowed  costs  based on the percentage
  of applicable federal  title  IV-E  claims
  made  by  that  district  for the relevant
  time  period  as  compared  to  the  total
  applicable  statewide  title  IV-E claims.
  The amount  of  the  offset  against  each
  district  will  be adjusted, if necessary,
  upon completion of the disallowance  allo-
  cation  process.  The  final allocation of
  the amount  of  any  federal  disallowance
  resulting  from  a  title  IV-E  secondary
  eligibility  review  shall  be  allocated
  among  the districts so that each district
  shall  be  responsible  for  the  amount
  attributable  to  each  of  the district's
  children or cases that are  determined  by
  the federal review to be unallowable. Each
  district  shall  also be responsible for a
  portion of the federal extrapolated disal-
  lowance amount based on the relative error
  rate for the district.  The  city  of  New
  York's  error  rate  will  be based on the
  federal sample and federal statistics. For
  all social services districts  other  than
  the  city of New York, the error rate will
  be based on  a  review  conducted  by  the
  district  of  a  sample of children and/or
  cases determined by the office of children
  and family services and a re-review  of  a
  sub-sample by the office of those children
  and/or cases determined by the office. The
  office  of  children  and  family services
  369  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE
  OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  will  determine  what  is  reasonable  in
  establishing  the  size  of the sample and
  sub-sample for each district.  The  office
  of  children  and  family  services  shall
  notify each social  services  district  of
  the  sample  of children and/or cases from
  the federal audit period that  the  social
  services  district  must review. Any child
  or case from the social services  district
  that  was  included  in the federal sample
  will  automatically  be  included  in  the
  social  services  district's review sample
  and the determination made at the  federal
  review  regarding  that child or case will
  govern for  the  purposes  of  the  social
  services  district's  review.  The  social
  services district must complete and submit
  the results of its review to the office of
  children and  family  services  within  60
  days  of  receipt of the sample. The error
  rate for the district will be based on the
  findings of the district's review and  the
  office  of  children  and family services'
  re-review. If a social  services  district
  does  not  complete  its  review within 60
  days of  receiving  the  sample  from  the
  office  of  children  and family services,
  the office of children and family services
  shall assign an error rate to  the  social
  services  district  based  on the relative
  percentage of  the  district's  applicable
  title  IV-E claims for the relevant period
  as compared to applicable statewide  title
  IV-E  claims  for  that  period  and other
  circumstances that the office of  children
  and  family services may consider in order
  to allocate 100  percent  of  the  federal
  disallowance.  The  office of children and
  family services shall  apply  each  social
  services  district's  error  rate  to  the
  total amount of the district's  applicable
  title  IV-E  claims  including  associated
  administrative  expenses.  The  resulting
  dollar  amounts  for  all  of  the  social
  services  districts  will  be  summed  to
  derive  the  total  amount  of  title IV-E
  claims deemed to be in error statewide. To
  establish a  disallowance  percentage  for
  each  social services district, the amount
  of the district's title IV-E claims deemed
  to be in error  will  be  divided  by  the
  370  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY ASSISTANCE
  OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  amount  of  statewide  title  IV-E  claims
  deemed  to  be  in  error.  The  resulting
  disallowance  percentage for each district
  will  be  applied to the entire title IV-E
  extrapolated  disallowance  calculated  by
  the federal review to determine the amount
  of the extrapolated disallowance for which
  the district is responsible. Each district
  will  be  credited  for the amount already
  disallowed for any individual children  or
  cases  found  to  be  in  error during the
  federal  review.  The  exclusive  appeal
  rights for the review of the amount of the
  federal  disallowance  assigned  to  each
  social services district shall be pursuant
  to article 78 of the  civil  practice  law
  and  rules; provided, however, that in any
  such action all  of  the  social  services
  districts  shall  be  joined  as necessary
  parties and the venue of any  such  action
  shall  be in Rensselaer county. Any social
  services district that fails  to  complete
  its  sample  review  in  the required time
  frames shall have no right to  appeal  and
  shall  not  be  a  necessary  party to any
  action brought by another social  services
  district.
 The  money  hereby  appropriated  is  to  be
  available for payment of state aid hereto-
  fore accrued or  hereafter  to  accrue  to
  municipalities. Subject to the approval of
  the  director  of  the  budget, such funds
  shall be available to the  office  net  of

 Notwithstanding any  inconsistent  provision
  of law, the amount herein appropriated may

  of law, in lieu of payments authorized  by
  the  social  services  law, or payments of
  federal funds otherwise due to  the  local
  social  services  districts  for  programs
  provided under the federal social security

  commissioner  of  health as due from local
  social services districts  each  month  as
  their  share  of payments made pursuant to
  section 367-b of the social  services  law
  may  be set aside by the state comptroller
  in an interest bearing account  with  such
  interest  accruing  to  the  credit of the

  and  prompt  payment  of  providers  under
  section 367-b of the social  services  law
  pursuant  to  an  estimate provided by the
  commissioner  of  health  of  each  local
  social  services  district's  share  of
  payments made pursuant to section 367-b of

 Notwithstanding the provisions of any  other
  law  to  the contrary, the office of chil-

  social services districts,  make  payments
  to  foster boarding homes paid directly by
  social services districts by direct depos-

  districts  shall  reimburse the office for
  the costs  of  administering  such  direct
  deposit or debit card payments.
 Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent provision

  basis,  request  that the office of tempo-

  for state reimbursement of eligible social services district expend-
  itures  for the provision and administration of foster care services
  including care, maintenance, supervision, and  tuition;  for  super-
  vision  of  foster  children  placed  in  federally funded job corps
  programs; for care, maintenance, supervision, and tuition for  adju-
  dicated juvenile delinquents placed in residential programs operated

  expenditures associated with local compliance with the federal Fami-

  available for tuition expenditures for  foster  children,  including
  persons in need of supervision and adjudicated juvenile delinquents,
  made  by  a  social services district located within a city having a
  population of one million or more.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a portion of the funds are
  available to reimburse social services districts for the  change  in
  the  maximum  state  aid rates established by the office of children
  and family services for the 2023-24 rate year  pursuant  to  section
  398-a  of  the social services law and sections 4003 and 4405 of the

  the time and in a manner to be determined by the office,  a  written
  certification,  attesting  that the funds received for the continua-
  tion of the cost of living adjustment to the maximum state aid  rate
  that became effective April 1, 2008 for that program will be or were
  used  solely  in  accordance  with  the  requirements of the cost of
  living adjustment established by the office.
  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law except a chapter  of
  the laws of 2023 authorizing a 4.0 percent cost of living adjustment
  increase for the period commencing on April 1, 2023 and ending March
  31,  2024, the commissioner shall not apply any other cost of living
  adjustment for  the  purpose  of  establishing  rates  of  payments,
  contracts  or  any  other  form of reimbursement, provided that this
  shall not prevent the commissioner from applying additional trend or
  staff retention factors for this program.
  Within the amounts appropriated herein, state  reimbursement  to  each
  social  services  district  for  services identified herein that are
  otherwise reimbursable by the state from April 1, 2023 through March
  31, 2024 shall be limited  to  a  district  allocation,  hereinafter
  referred to as the district's block grant allocation.  Notwithstand-
  ing any other provision of law, such block grant allocation shall be
  based,  in  part, on each district's claims for such costs, adjusted
  by the applicable cost allocation methodology and net of any  retro-
  active  payments  for  the 12 month period ending June 30, 2022 that
  are submitted on or before January 2, 2023 and,  in  part,  on  such
  other  factors  as  determined  by the office of children and family
  services and approved by the director of the budget. Any portion  of
  a  social  services  district's  allocation  from funds appropriated
  herein not claimed by such district during the state fiscal year may
  be used by such district for  expenditures  on  preventive  services
  provided pursuant to section 409-a of the social services law, inde-
  pendent  living services and aftercare services provided pursuant to
  regulations of the department of family assistance, claimed by  such
  district  during the next state fiscal year up to the amount remain-
  ing from the district's foster care block grant allocation, provided
  however, that any claims for such services  during  the  next  state
  fiscal  year in excess of such amount shall be subject to 62 percent
  state reimbursement exclusive of any federal  funds  made  available
  for  such  purposes, in accordance with directives of the department
  of family assistance and subject to the approval of the director  of
  the  budget.  Any claims submitted by a social services district for
  reimbursement for a particular  state  fiscal  year  for  which  the
  social  services  district  does  not  receive  state  or  federal
  reimbursement during that state  fiscal  year  may  not  be  claimed
  against that district's block grant apportionment for the next state
  fiscal year.
  The  office  of children and family services, with the approval of the
  director of the budget, may reduce a district's  block  grant  allo-
  cation  by  the  state share decrease related to federal retroactive
  reimbursement for such foster care services identified  herein.  The
  office,  with the approval of the director of the budget, may reduce

  ances or sanctions taken against the district pursuant to the social
  services law or federal law.
  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of law, the state shall not be
  responsible  for  reimbursing  a  social  services  district  and  a
  district  shall  not seek state reimbursement for any portion of any
  state disallowance or sanction taken  against  the  social  services
  district,  or any federal disallowance attributable to final federal
  agency decisions or to settlement made, on or after  July  1,  1995,
  when  such  disallowance or sanction results from the failure of the
  social services district to comply with federal  or  state  require-
  ments,  including, but not limited to, failure to document eligibil-
  ity for federal or state funds in the case record; provided,  howev-
  er,  if  the  office  determines  that  any federal disallowance for
  services provided between January 1, 1999 and May 31,  1999  results
  solely from the late enactment of the state legislation implementing
  the federal adoption and safe families act, the state shall be sole-
  ly  responsible for the full amount of the disallowance or sanction;
  provided, further, however, this provision shall be deemed to  apply
  both  prospectively  and  retroactively  regardless  of whether such
  sanctions or disallowances are for services provided or claims  made
  prior to or after April 1, 2023.
  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law, any federal disallowance
  resulting from a federal title IV-E eligibility review or audit that
  uses extrapolated statistic techniques shall be passed along by  the
  state  to  any  and all social services districts that the office of
  children and family services has determined have not  complied  with
  the title IV-E eligibility requirements or have not taken the neces-
  sary  actions to ensure compliance with such requirements including,
  but not limited to, failing to: assess and fully  document  all  the
  criteria  and  have readily available all the necessary documents to
  establish and continue title IV-E eligibility  for  all  title  IV-E
  eligible  children within the required time frames; claim title IV-E
  funding only for cases that meet all of the title  IV-E  eligibility
  criteria;  and fully implement the social services payment system on
  or before April 1, 2005 for all direct and voluntary  agency  foster
  care services.
  Notwithstanding  any  law  to the contrary, the office of children and
  family services shall impose on social services districts any feder-
  al disallowance issued against the state as a result  of  a  federal
  title  IV-E  secondary eligibility review regardless of the date the
  children may have entered foster care, the date the  eligibility  or
  payment  errors  occurred,  or the filing date of any federal claims
  for reimbursement;  provided,  however,  that  the  state  shall  be
  responsible for the disallowed costs and expenditures related to the
  placement  of children in a facility operated by the office of chil-
  dren and family services, which shall  be  determined  in  the  same
  manner  as the disallowed costs and expenditures for social services
  districts other than the city of New York. In order to reimburse the
  federal government for the full amount of any  disallowance  imposed
  on the state by the federal administration for children and families
  within  the  timeframes  necessary  to  avoid any potential interest

  payments on such amount, the office of children and family  services
  is  authorized  to  immediately  offset  funds otherwise due to each
  district for a pro rata share of the total disallowed costs based on
  the  percentage of applicable federal title IV-E claims made by that
  district for the relevant time  period  as  compared  to  the  total
  applicable  statewide  title  IV-E  claims. The amount of the offset
  against  each  district  will  be  adjusted,  if  necessary,  upon
  completion  of the disallowance allocation process.  The final allo-
  cation of the amount of any federal disallowance  resulting  from  a
  title IV-E secondary eligibility review shall be allocated among the
  districts  so that each district shall be responsible for the amount
  attributable to each of the district's children or  cases  that  are
  determined  by  the  federal review to be unallowable. Each district
  shall also be responsible for a portion of the federal  extrapolated
  disallowance  amount  based  on  the  relative  error  rate  for the
  district. The city of New York's error rate will  be  based  on  the
  federal  sample  and  federal  statistics.  For  all social services
  districts other than the city of New York, the error  rate  will  be
  based  on a review conducted by the district of a sample of children
  and/or cases  determined  by  the  office  of  children  and  family
  services  and  a  re-review  of  a sub-sample by the office of those
  children and/or cases determined by the office. The office of  chil-
  dren and family services will determine what is reasonable in estab-
  lishing the size of the sample and sub-sample for each district. The
  office  of  children  and  family  services shall notify each social
  services district of the sample of children and/or  cases  from  the
  federal  audit period that the social services district must review.
  Any child or  case  from  the  social  services  district  that  was
  included in the federal sample will automatically be included in the
  social  services district's review sample and the determination made
  at the federal review regarding that child or case will  govern  for
  the  purposes  of  the social services district's review. The social
  services district must complete and submit the results of its review
  to the office of children and family  services  within  60  days  of
  receipt of the sample. The error rate for the district will be based
  on  the findings of the district's review and the office of children
  and family services' re-review. If a social services  district  does
  not  complete its review within 60 days of receiving the sample from
  the office of children and family services, the office  of  children
  and  family  services  shall  assign  an  error  rate  to the social
  services district based on the relative percentage of the district's
  applicable title IV-E claims for the relevant period as compared  to
  applicable  statewide  title  IV-E  claims for that period and other
  circumstances that the office of children and  family  services  may
  consider  in  order to allocate 100 percent of the federal disallow-
  ance. The office of children and family services  shall  apply  each
  social  services  district's  error  rate to the total amount of the
  district's applicable title IV-E claims including associated  admin-
  istrative  expenses.  The  resulting  dollar  amounts for all of the
  social services districts will be summed to derive the total  amount
  of title IV-E claims deemed to be in error statewide. To establish a

  disallowance  percentage  for  each  social  services  district, the
  amount of the district's title IV-E claims deemed  to  be  in  error
  will  be divided by the amount of statewide title IV-E claims deemed
  to  be  in  error.  The  resulting  disallowance percentage for each
  district will be applied  to  the  entire  title  IV-E  extrapolated
  disallowance  calculated  by  the  federal  review  to determine the
  amount of the extrapolated disallowance for which  the  district  is
  responsible.  Each  district will be credited for the amount already
  disallowed for any individual children or cases found to be in error
  during the federal review.  The  exclusive  appeal  rights  for  the
  review  of  the  amount of the federal disallowance assigned to each
  social services district shall be pursuant  to  article  78  of  the
  civil  practice  law  and rules; provided, however, that in any such
  action all of the social  services  districts  shall  be  joined  as
  necessary parties and the venue of any such action shall be in Rens-
  selaer  county.  Any social services district that fails to complete
  its sample review in the required time frames shall have no right to
  appeal and shall not be a necessary party to any action  brought  by
  another social services district.

  by  March  31, 2022 for those community preventive services provided
  from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021 at a cost that  does
  not exceed the cost that was in effect on October 1, 2008 and that a

  appropriated;  and,  provided  further,  however, that if the amount
  appropriated  exceeds  the amount of funds necessary to reimburse 98
  percent of 65 percent  of  the  eligible  social  services  district
  expenditures,  the  office  may,  to the extent funds are available,
  provide reimbursement for 98  percent  of  65  percent  of  eligible
  social  services  district expenditures for new community preventive
  services programs approved by the office and only up to the  amounts
  approved  by  the  office.  A local social services district seeking
  federal and/or state reimbursement for community preventive services
  provided on or after October 1, 2020 must submit claims  that  sepa-
  rately  identify the costs of such services in a form and manner and
  at such times as are required by the department of family assistance

  ments and credits. Funds appropriated herein shall be available  for

  state and national fingerprint records. Notwithstanding  any  incon-
  sistent  provision  of law, and pursuant to chapter 7 of the laws of
  1999 and chapter 668 of the laws of 2006, the  commissioner  of  the

  ensure expenditures made pursuant to this provision  reflect  appro-
  priate  federal  and local shares. The commissioner of the office of
  children  and family services shall request that the commissioner of
  the office of temporary  and  disability  assistance  reimburse  the
  commissioner  of  the  office  of children and family services in an
  amount equal to 53.94  percent  of  the  nonfederal  share  of  such
  payments provided that such reimbursement in payments reflects actu-
  al  expenditures  made  on  behalf  of  each  local  social services
  district to capture the local share of such costs.
  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of the social services  law
  or  the  state  finance  law, the commissioner shall, on a quarterly
  basis, request that the commissioner of the office of temporary  and
  disability  assistance  reimburse  the commissioner of the office of
  children and family services in an amount equal to 53.94 percent  of

  ter  and  shall  be  charged  among districts based on the number of
  children currently placed  in  foster  care  in  each  local  social
  services district provided that this methodology is revised quarter-
  ly  to  reflect  most  current  available data. Amounts appropriated
  herein may, subject to the director of the budget,  be  interchanged

  eligible social services district expenditures that are  claimed  by
  March 31, 2021 for child welfare services which shall include and be
  limited to preventive services provided pursuant to section 409-a of
  the  social  services  law  other than community optional preventive
  services, child protective services,  independent  living  services,

  April  1,  2020,  after  first deducting therefrom any federal funds
  properly received or to be received on account thereof upon  certif-
  ication  by  the  social services district that it will not be using
  these funds to supplant other state and local  funds  and  that  the
  district  will not submit claims for reimbursement under this appro-
  priation for the same type and level of  services  that  the  county
  previously  provided  and claimed under any contract in existence on

  to a formula developed by the office  of  temporary  and  disability
  assistance  and  the  office  of  children  and  family services and

  commissioner  of  the  office  of children and family services in an
  amount equal to 53.94  percent  of  the  nonfederal  share  of  such
  payments provided that such reimbursement in payments reflects actu-
  al  expenditures  made  on  behalf  of  each  local  social services
  district to capture the local share of such costs.
  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of the social services  law
  or  the  state  finance  law, the commissioner shall, on a quarterly
  basis, request that the commissioner of the office of temporary  and

  expenditures made during the period January 1, 2017 through December

  of expenditures during such period  for  supervision  and  treatment
  services  for juveniles programs not otherwise reimbursable pursuant

  law  to the contrary, the amount appropriated herein may provide for
  reimbursement of up to 100 percent of the cost of care,  maintenance
  and  supervision  for  youth  whose  residence is outside the county

  children and family services shall bill, and the home county of such
  youth shall reimburse the office of children  and  family  services,
  for  51  percent of the cost of care, maintenance and supervision of
  such youth.
  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the office  of  children  and
  family  services  may require that such claims and data on detention
  use be submitted to the office  electronically  in  the  manner  and
  format required by the office.
  Notwithstanding  any  law to the contrary, the office shall be author-
  ized to promulgate  regulations  permitting  the  office  to  impose
  fiscal  sanctions  in the event that the office finds non-compliance
  with regulations governing secure and nonsecure detention facilities

  for which the municipality was unable to claim within  the  required

 The appropriation made by chapter 53, section 1, of the laws of 2023, is
  hereby amended and reappropriated to read:
  For state reimbursement of the safety net assistance program as estab-
  lished pursuant to chapter 436 of the laws of 1997.
  Notwithstanding  section  153  of the social services law or any other
  inconsistent provision of law, funds appropriated herein shall reim-
  burse 29 percent of safety net  assistance  expenditures,  including
  the  cost of providing shelter supplements for safety net assistance
  households at local option, including eligible households containing

  prevent  eviction and address homelessness in accordance with social
  services district plans approved by  the  office  of  temporary  and
  disability  assistance  and  the  director  of the budget, provided,
  however, that in social services districts with  a  population  over
  five  million no shelter supplements other than the family homeless-
  ness  and  eviction  prevention  supplement  shall  be  reimbursed,
  provided  however  funds  appropriated  herein shall only be used to
  reimburse rental costs up to the maximum rent levels in place as  of
  January 1, 2021, then adjusted consistent with the annual year-over-
  year  percentage  changes in fair market rent, provided, however, in
  the event of a decrease in fair market rent the value of the maximum
  rent levels reimbursed with  funds  appropriated  herein  shall  not
  decrease  and  shall  be  set at the maximum rent levels established
  during the prior year, and further provided  that  such  supplements
  shall  not be part of the standard of need pursuant to section 131-a
  of the social services law. Funds  appropriated  herein  shall  also
  reimburse  29  percent  of  safety  net  assistance expenditures, in
  social services districts with a population over five  million,  for
  emergency  shelter,  transportation, or nutrition payments which the
  district determines are necessary to establish or maintain independ-
  ent living arrangements among persons living  with  medically  diag-
  nosed  HIV  infection  as defined by the AIDS institute of the state
  department of health and who are homeless or facing homelessness and
  for whom no viable and less costly alternative to housing is  avail-
  able;  provided, however, that funds appropriated herein may only be

  Funds  appropriated  herein  shall  reimburse 29 percent of safety net
  assistance expenditures, in social services districts with  a  popu-
  lation  of  five million or fewer, for emergency shelter payments in
  excess of those promulgated by the office of temporary and disabili-
  ty assistance but not exceeding an amount reasonably approximate  to

  determines are necessary to establish or maintain independent living

  district from the medical assistance program by reducing the capita-
  tion rates paid to medicaid managed care organizations by the amount
  of savings resulting from stably  housing  individuals  living  with

  shall  make  such  emergency  shelter  payments  in  excess of those
  promulgated by the office of temporary and disability assistance but
  not exceeding an amount reasonably approximate  to  100  percent  of
  fair  market  rent,  and  the savings shall be used to reimburse 100

  ance programs in social services districts with a population of five

  For  services and expenses of a program to provide shelter supplements
  at local option to individuals  and  families  regardless  of  immi-
  gration  status  who  are experiencing homelessness or are facing an
  imminent loss of housing, including individuals and families without
  children. Provided, however, that in social services districts  with
  a  population  over  five  million, funds allocated to such district
  shall be used in the first instance to reimburse rental costs  above
  the  maximum  rent  levels  in place as of January 1, 2021 up to the
  United States department of housing  and  urban  development's  fair
  market  rent  level  for  the  family  homelessness  and  eviction
  prevention supplement program pursuant  to  section  131-bb  of  the
  social  services law, then adjusted consistent with the annual year-
  over-year percentage changes in fair market rent, provided, however,
  in the event of a decrease in fair market  rent  the  value  of  the
  maximum  rent levels reimbursed with funds appropriated herein shall
  not decrease and shall be set at the maximum rent levels established
  during the prior year, and any remaining funds for such district may
  be used to provide shelter  supplements  pursuant  to  the  purposes
  appropriated herein.
  Such supplements shall be provided to households who earn no more than
  30  percent  of  area  median  income  at  the  time of application,
  provided however, that if  sufficient  demand  does  not  exist  for
  households  who  earn no more than 30 percent of area median income,
  supplements may be provided for households earning up to 50  percent
  of area median income.
  Such  supplements shall be provided in accordance with social services
  district plans, provided however that no plan shall require  supple-
  ments  to be below 85 percent of fair market rent, but may allow for
  supplements above 85 percent of fair  market  rent  at  local  cost;
  provided further however that at least 50 percent of the supplements
  shall  be  allocated  for households who are currently in shelter or
  experiencing homelessness, unless sufficient demand does  not  exist
  for  such households within the district. A social services district
  plan may provide for the administration of portions of this  program
  to  be delegated to another public agency or to a contractor or non-
  profit organization.
  Funds appropriated herein shall be used to reimburse up to 100 percent
  of the additional rental costs determined  based  on  limiting  such
  household's  earned  and/or  unearned  income  contribution  to  30
  percent. Each supplement shall be provided until 30 percent  of  the
  household's  earned and/or unearned income reaches the total monthly
  rent.
  Supplements provided herein shall not be part of the standard of  need
  pursuant to section 131-a of the social services law.  Notwithstand-
  ing  any provision of law to the contrary such supplements shall not

  ment's  fair  market  rent  level  for  the  family homelessness and
  eviction prevention supplement pursuant to  section  131-bb  of  the

  maximum  rent levels reimbursed with funds appropriated herein shall
  not decrease and shall be set at the maximum rent levels established

  States department of housing and  urban  development's  fair  market
  rent  level  for  the  family  homelessness  and eviction prevention
  supplement program pursuant to section 131-bb of the social services
  law,  then  adjusted  consistent  with  the  annual  year-over-year
  percentage  changes  in  fair market rent, provided, however, in the
  event of a decrease in fair market rent the  value  of  the  maximum
  rent  levels  reimbursed  with  funds  appropriated herein shall not
  decrease and shall be set at the  maximum  rent  levels  established
  during the prior year, and any remaining funds for such district may
  be  used  to  provide  shelter  supplements pursuant to the purposes
  appropriated herein.
  Such supplements shall be provided to households who earn no more than
  30 percent of  area  median  income  at  the  time  of  application,
  provided  however,  that  if  sufficient  demand  does not exist for
  households who earn no more than 30 percent of area  median  income,
  supplements  may be provided for households earning up to 50 percent
  of area median income.
  Such supplements shall be provided in accordance with social  services
  district  plans, provided however that no plan shall require supple-
  ments to be below 85 percent of fair market rent, but may allow  for
  supplements  above  85  percent  of  fair market rent at local cost;
  provided further however that at least 50 percent of the supplements
  shall be allocated for households who are currently  in  shelter  or
  experiencing  homelessness,  unless sufficient demand does not exist
  for such households within the district. A social services  district
  plan  may provide for the administration of portions of this program
  to be delegated to another public agency or to a contractor or  non-
  profit organization.
  Funds appropriated herein shall be used to reimburse up to 100 percent
  of  the  additional  rental  costs determined based on limiting such
  household's  earned  and/or  unearned  income  contribution  to  30
  percent.  Each  supplement shall be provided until 30 percent of the
  household's earned and/or unearned income reaches the total  monthly
  rent.
  Supplements  provided herein shall not be part of the standard of need
  pursuant to section 131-a of the social services law.  Notwithstand-
  ing any provision of law to the contrary such supplements shall  not
  be subject to recoupment or repayment. Notwithstanding the aforemen-
  tioned requirement that a social services district with a population
  over  five  million shall use this funding to reimburse rental costs
  above the maximum rent levels in place as of January 1, 2021  up  to

  dited  department  of  health  state funds
  medicaid expenditures as  a  result  of  a
  natural or other type of disaster, includ-
  ing a governmental declaration of emergen-
  cy.
 The  director of the budget, in consultation
  with the  commissioner  of  health,  shall
  assess  on  a  quarterly  basis  known and
  projected medicaid expenditures by catego-
  ry of service and by geographic region, as
  determined by the commissioner of  health,
  incurred  both  prior to and subsequent to
  such assessment for each such period,  and
  if  the  director of the budget determines
  that such  expenditures  are  expected  to
  cause medicaid spending for such period to
  exceed the aggregate limit specified here-
  in  for  such  period,  the state medicaid
  director, in consultation with the  direc-
  tor  of the budget and the commissioner of
  health, shall develop a  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment to limit such spend-
  ing to the aggregate limit specified here-
  in for such period.
 Such  medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  shall be designed, to reduce the  expendi-
  tures  authorized  by  the  appropriations
  herein in compliance  with  the  following
  guidelines:  (1)  reductions shall be made
  in compliance with applicable federal law,
  including the provisions  of  the  Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law  No.  111-148, and the Health Care and
  Education  Reconciliation  Act  of  2010,
  Public  Law  No.  111-152  (collectively
  "Affordable Care Act") and any  subsequent
  amendments  thereto or regulations promul-
  gated thereunder; (2) reductions shall  be
  made  in  a  manner that complies with the
  state medicaid plan approved by the feder-
  al  centers  for  medicare  and  medicaid
  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner of health  is  authorized  to
  submit  any  state  plan amendment or seek
  other federal approval,  including  waiver
  authority,  to implement the provisions of
  the medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  that meets the other  criteria  set  forth
  herein;  (3) reductions shall be made in a
  manner that  maximizes  federal  financial
  participation,  to the extent practicable,
  including any  federal  financial  partic-
  732  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  ipation that is available or is reasonably
  expected  to  become  available,  in  the
  discretion of the commissioner, under  the
  Affordable  Care Act; (4) reductions shall
  be  made  uniformly  among  categories  of
  services  and  geographic  regions  of the
  state,  to  the  extent  practicable,  and
  shall  be made uniformly within a category
  of service,  to  the  extent  practicable,
  except  where  the commissioner determines
  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for
  non-uniformity,  including but not limited
  to: the extent to which  specific  catego-
  ries of services contributed to department
  of health medicaid state funds spending in
  excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need  to  maintain  safety net services in
  underserved communities; or the  potential
  benefits  of  pursuing  innovative payment
  models contemplated by the Affordable Care
  Act, in which case such grounds  shall  be
  set  forth  in  the medicaid savings allo-
  cation  adjustment;  and  (5)  reductions
  shall  be  made  in a manner that does not
  unnecessarily  create  administrative
  burdens to medicaid applicants and recipi-
  ents or providers.
 The commissioner shall seek the input of the
  legislature,  as  well  as  organizations
  representing  health  care  providers,
  consumers,  businesses,  workers,  health
  insurers, and others with relevant  exper-
  tise,  in developing such medicaid savings
  allocation adjustment, to the extent  that
  all  or  part  of  such adjustment, in the
  discretion of the commissioner, is  likely
  to  have  a material impact on the overall
  medicaid program, particular categories of
  service or particular  geographic  regions
  of the state.
 (a) The commissioner shall post the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  on  the
  department of health's website  and  shall
  provide  written copies of such adjustment
  to the chairs of the  senate  finance  and
  the  assembly ways and means committees at
  least 30 days before  the  date  on  which
  implementation is expected to begin.
 (b) The commissioner may revise the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment subsequent
  to the provisions of notice and  prior  to
  implementation  but needs to provide a new
  733  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  notice pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  of
  this  paragraph  only  if the commissioner
  determines, in his or her discretion, that
  such  revisions  materially  alter  the
  adjustment.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  the
  commissioner  need  not  seek  the  input
  described in paragraph (a) of this  subdi-
  vision or provide notice pursuant to para-
  graph  (b)  of this subdivision if, in the
  discretion of the commissioner,  expedited
  development  and implementation of a medi-
  caid  savings  allocation  adjustment  is
  necessary  due to a public health emergen-
  cy.
 For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  public
  health  emergency  is  defined  as:  (i) a
  disaster,  natural  or  otherwise,  that
  significantly increases the immediate need
  for  health  care  personnel in an area of
  the state; (ii) an event or condition that
  creates a widespread risk of exposure to a
  serious  communicable  disease,  or  the
  potential  for  such  widespread  risk  of
  exposure; or  (iii)  any  other  event  or
  condition  determined  by the commissioner
  to constitute an imminent threat to public
  health.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
  prevent  all  or  part  of  such  medicaid
  savings  allocation adjustment from taking
  effect retroactively to the extent permit-
  ted by the federal  centers  for  medicare
  and medicaid services.
 In  accordance  with  the  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment, the commissioner of
  the  department  of  health  shall  reduce
  department  of health state funds medicaid
  spending by the amount  of  the  projected
  overspending  through,  actions including,
  but not limited to modifying or suspending
  reimbursement methods, including  but  not
  limited  to  all  fees, premium levels and
  rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding  any
  provision  of  law  that  sets  a specific
  amount  or  methodology  for  any  such
  payments  or  rates  of payment; modifying
  medicaid  program  benefits;  seeking  all
  necessary  federal  approvals,  including,
  but not limited to waivers, waiver  amend-
  ments;  and  suspending  time  frames  for

  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the
  laws of 1988, and 18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
 The department of  health  shall  prepare  a
  quarterly  report  that  sets  forth:  (a)
  known and projected department  of  health
  medicaid  expenditures  as  described  in
  subdivision  (1)  of  this  section,  and
  factors  that  could  result  in  medicaid
  disbursements  for  the  relevant  state
  fiscal  year  to  exceed  the  projected
  department of health state funds disburse-
  ments in the enacted budget financial plan
  pursuant to subdivision 3 of section 23 of
  the state finance law, including  spending
  increases  or decreases due to: enrollment
  fluctuations,  rate  changes,  utilization
  changes,  MRT  investments,  and  shift of
  beneficiaries to managed care;  and  vari-
  ations  in  offline medicaid payments; and
  (b) the actions  taken  to  implement  any
  medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment
  implemented pursuant to subdivision (4) of
  this  section,  including  information
  concerning  the  impact of such actions on
  each  category  of  service  and  each
  geographic  region of the state. Each such
  quarterly report shall be provided to  the
  chairs  of  the  senate  finance  and  the
  assembly ways  and  means  committees  and
  shall  be  posted  on  the  department  of
  health's website in a timely manner.

  commissioner  of  health, is authorized to
  reduce  any  appropriation  under  this
  section  other  than  other long term care
  services  by  an  amount  of  up  to  $200
  million, and is further authorized to take
  any  action  necessary  to  implement such
  reductions.
 The director of the budget, in  consultation
  with  the  commissioner  of  health, shall
  741  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  assess on  a  quarterly  basis  known  and
  projected medicaid expenditures by catego-
  ry of service and by geographic region, as
  defined by the commissioner, incurred both
  prior to and subsequent to such assessment
  for  each such period, and if the director
  of the budget determines that such expend-
  itures  are  expected  to  cause  medicaid
  spending  for  such  period  to exceed the
  aggregate limit specified herein for  such
  period,  the  state  medicaid director, in
  consultation  with  the  director  of  the
  budget  and  the  commissioner  of health,
  shall develop  a  medicaid  savings  allo-
  cation  adjustment  to limit such spending
  to the aggregate  limit  specified  herein
  for such period.
 Such  medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  shall be designed, to reduce the  expendi-
  tures  authorized  by  the  appropriations
  herein in compliance  with  the  following
  guidelines:  (1)  reductions shall be made
  in compliance with applicable federal law,
  including the provisions  of  the  Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law  No.  111-148, and the Health Care and
  Education  Reconciliation  Act  of  2010,
  Public  Law  No.  111-152  (collectively
  "Affordable Care Act") and any  subsequent
  amendments  thereto or regulations promul-
  gated thereunder; (2) reductions shall  be
  made  in  a  manner that complies with the
  state medicaid plan approved by the feder-
  al  centers  for  medicare  and  medicaid
  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner of health  is  authorized  to
  submit  any  state  plan amendment or seek
  other federal approval,  including  waiver
  authority,  to implement the provisions of
  the medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  that meets the other  criteria  set  forth
  herein;  (3) reductions shall be made in a
  manner that  maximizes  federal  financial
  participation,  to the extent practicable,
  including any  federal  financial  partic-
  ipation that is available or is reasonably
  expected  to  become  available,  in  the
  discretion of the commissioner, under  the
  Affordable  Care Act; (4) reductions shall
  be  made  uniformly  among  categories  of
  services  and  geographic  regions  of the
  state,  to  the  extent  practicable,  and
  742  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  shall  be made uniformly within a category
  of service,  to  the  extent  practicable,
  except  where  the commissioner determines
  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for
  non-uniformity, including but not  limited
  to:  the  extent to which specific catego-
  ries of services contributed to department
  of health medicaid state funds spending in
  excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need to maintain safety  net  services  in
  underserved  communities; or the potential
  benefits of  pursuing  innovative  payment
  models contemplated by the Affordable Care
  Act,  in  which case such grounds shall be
  set forth in the  medicaid  savings  allo-
  cation  adjustment;  and  (5)  reductions
  shall be made in a manner  that  does  not
  unnecessarily  create  administrative
  burdens to medicaid applicants and recipi-
  ents or providers.
 The commissioner shall seek the input of the
  legislature,  as  well  as  organizations
  representing  health  care  providers,
  consumers,  businesses,  workers,  health
  insurers,  and others with relevant exper-
  tise, in developing such medicaid  savings
  allocation  adjustment, to the extent that
  all or part of  such  adjustment,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, is likely
  to have a material impact on  the  overall
  medicaid program, particular categories of
  service  or  particular geographic regions
  of the state.
 (a) The commissioner shall post the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  on  the
  department  of  health's website and shall
  provide written copies of such  adjustment
  to  the  chairs  of the senate finance and
  the assembly ways and means committees  at
  least  30  days  before  the date on which
  implementation is expected to begin.
 (b) The commissioner may revise the medicaid
  savings allocation  adjustment  subsequent
  to  the  provisions of notice and prior to
  implementation but needs to provide a  new
  notice  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i) of
  this paragraph only  if  the  commissioner
  determines, in his or her discretion, that
  such  revisions  materially  alter  the
  adjustment.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  the
  743  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  commissioner  need  not  seek  the  input
  described in paragraph (a) of this  subdi-
  vision or provide notice pursuant to para-
  graph  (b)  of this subdivision if, in the
  discretion of the commissioner,  expedited
  development  and implementation of a medi-
  caid  savings  allocation  adjustment  is
  necessary  due to a public health emergen-
  cy.
 For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  public
  health  emergency  is  defined  as:  (i) a
  disaster,  natural  or  otherwise,  that
  significantly increases the immediate need
  for  health  care  personnel in an area of
  the state; (ii) an event or condition that
  creates a widespread risk of exposure to a
  serious  communicable  disease,  or  the
  potential  for  such  widespread  risk  of
  exposure; or  (iii)  any  other  event  or
  condition  determined  by the commissioner
  to constitute an imminent threat to public
  health.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
  prevent  all  or  part  of  such  medicaid
  savings  allocation adjustment from taking
  effect retroactively to the extent permit-
  ted by the federal  centers  for  medicare
  and medicaid services.
 In  accordance  with  the  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment, the commissioner of
  the  department  of  health  shall  reduce
  department  of health state funds medicaid
  spending by the amount  of  the  projected
  overspending  through,  actions including,
  but not limited to modifying or suspending
  reimbursement methods, including  but  not
  limited  to  all  fees, premium levels and
  rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding  any
  provision  of  law  that  sets  a specific
  amount  or  methodology  for  any  such
  payments or rates of payment; modifying or
  discontinuing  medicaid  program benefits;
  seeking all necessary  federal  approvals,
  including,  but  not  limited  to waivers,
  waiver  amendments;  and  suspending  time
  frames  for  notice,  approval  or certif-
  ication  of  rate  requirements,  notwith-
  standing  any  provision  of  law, rule or
  regulation to the contrary, including  but
  not  limited  to sections 2807 and 3614 of
  the public health law, section 18 of chap-

 The  department  of  health  shall prepare a
  quarterly  report  that  sets  forth:  (a)
  known  and  projected department of health
  medicaid  expenditures  as  described  in
  subdivision  (1)  of  this  section,  and
  factors  that  could  result  in  medicaid
  disbursements  for  the  relevant  state
  fiscal  year  to  exceed  the  projected
  department of health state funds disburse-
  ments in the enacted budget financial plan
  pursuant to subdivision 3 of section 23 of
  the  state finance law, including spending
  increases or decreases due to:  enrollment
  fluctuations,  rate  changes,  utilization
  changes, MRT  investments,  and  shift  of
  beneficiaries  to  managed care; and vari-
  ations in offline medicaid  payments;  and
  (b)  the  actions  taken  to implement any
  medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment
  implemented pursuant to subdivision (4) of
  this  section,  including  information
  concerning the impact of such  actions  on
  each  category  of  service  and  each
  geographic region of the state. Each  such

  the  budget  to account for any changes in
  the New York state federal medical assist-

  governmental declaration of emergency.
 The  director of the budget, in consultation
  with the  commissioner  of  health,  shall
  assess  on  a  quarterly  basis  known and
  projected medicaid expenditures by catego-
  ry of service and by geographic region, as
  determined by the commissioner of  health,
  incurred  both  prior to and subsequent to
  such assessment for each such period,  and
  if  the  director of the budget determines
  767  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25

  that such  expenditures  are  expected  to
  cause medicaid spending for such period to
  exceed the aggregate limit specified here-
  in  for  such  period,  the state medicaid
  director, in consultation with the  direc-
  tor  of the budget and the commissioner of
  health, shall develop a  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment to limit such spend-
  ing to the aggregate limit specified here-
  in for such period.
 Such  medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  shall be designed, to reduce the  expendi-
  tures  authorized  by  the  appropriations
  herein in compliance  with  the  following
  guidelines:  (1)  reductions shall be made
  in compliance with applicable federal law,
  including the provisions  of  the  Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law  No.  111-148, and the Health Care and
  Education  Reconciliation  Act  of  2010,
  Public  Law  No.  111-152  (collectively
  "Affordable Care Act") and any  subsequent
  amendments  thereto or regulations promul-
  gated thereunder; (2) reductions shall  be
  made  in  a  manner that complies with the
  state medicaid plan approved by the feder-
  al  centers  for  medicare  and  medicaid
  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner of health  is  authorized  to
  submit  any  state  plan amendment or seek
  other federal approval,  including  waiver
  authority,  to implement the provisions of
  the medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  that meets the other  criteria  set  forth
  herein;  (3) reductions shall be made in a
  manner that  maximizes  federal  financial
  participation,  to the extent practicable,
  including any  federal  financial  partic-
  ipation that is available or is reasonably
  expected  to  become  available,  in  the
  discretion of the commissioner, under  the
  Affordable  Care Act; (4) reductions shall
  be  made  uniformly  among  categories  of
  services  and  geographic  regions  of the
  state,  to  the  extent  practicable,  and
  shall  be made uniformly within a category
  of service,  to  the  extent  practicable,
  except  where  the commissioner determines
  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for
  non-uniformity,  including but not limited
  to: the extent to which  specific  catego-
  ries of services contributed to department
  768  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  of health medicaid state funds spending in
  excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need  to  maintain  safety net services in
  underserved  communities; or the potential
  benefits of  pursuing  innovative  payment
  models contemplated by the Affordable Care
  Act,  in  which case such grounds shall be
  set forth in the  medicaid  savings  allo-
  cation  adjustment;  and  (5)  reductions
  shall be made in a manner  that  does  not
  unnecessarily  create  administrative
  burdens to medicaid applicants and recipi-
  ents or providers.
 The commissioner shall seek the input of the
  legislature,  as  well  as  organizations
  representing  health  care  providers,
  consumers,  businesses,  workers,  health
  insurers,  and others with relevant exper-
  tise, in developing such medicaid  savings
  allocation  adjustment, to the extent that
  all or part of  such  adjustment,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, is likely
  to have a material impact on  the  overall
  medicaid program, particular categories of
  service  or  particular geographic regions
  of the state.
 (a) The commissioner shall post the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  on  the
  department  of  health's website and shall
  provide written copies of such plan to the
  chairs  of  the  senate  finance  and  the
  assembly  ways  and  means  committees  at
  least 30 days before  the  date  on  which
  implementation is expected to begin.
 (b) The commissioner may revise the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment subsequent
  to the provisions of notice and  prior  to
  implementation  but needs to provide a new
  notice pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  of
  this  paragraph  only  if the commissioner
  determines, in his or her discretion, that
  such revisions materially alter the plan.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  the
  commissioner  need  not  seek  the  input
  described in paragraph (a) of this  subdi-
  vision or provide notice pursuant to para-
  graph  (b)  of this subdivision if, in the
  discretion of the commissioner,  expedited
  development  and implementation of a medi-
  caid  savings  allocation  adjustment  is
  769  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25

  necessary  due to a public health emergen-
  cy.
 For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  public
  health emergency  is  defined  as:  (i)  a
  disaster,  natural  or  otherwise,  that
  significantly increases the immediate need
  for health care personnel in  an  area  of
  the state; (ii) an event or condition that
  creates a widespread risk of exposure to a
  serious  communicable  disease,  or  the
  potential  for  such  widespread  risk  of
  exposure;  or  (iii)  any  other  event or
  condition determined by  the  commissioner
  to constitute an imminent threat to public
  health.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
  prevent  all  or  part  of  such  medicaid
  savings allocation adjustment from  taking
  effect retroactively to the extent permit-
  ted  by  the  federal centers for medicare
  and medicaid services.
 In  accordance  with  the  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment, the commissioner of
  the  department  of  health  shall  reduce
  department of health state funds  medicaid
  spending  by  the  amount of the projected
  overspending through,  actions  including,
  but not limited to modifying or suspending
  reimbursement  methods,  including but not
  limited to all fees,  premium  levels  and
  rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding  any
  provision of  law  that  sets  a  specific
  amount  or  methodology  for  any  such
  payments or rates  of  payment;  modifying
  medicaid  program  benefits;  seeking  all
  necessary  federal  approvals,  including,
  but  not limited to waivers, waiver amend-
  ments;  and  suspending  time  frames  for
  notice,  approval or certification of rate
  requirements,  notwithstanding  any
  provision  of  law,  rule or regulation to
  the contrary, including but not limited to
  sections  2807  and  3614  of  the  public
  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the
  laws of 1988, and 18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
 The  department  of  health  shall prepare a
  quarterly  report  that  sets  forth:  (a)
  known  and  projected department of health
  medicaid  expenditures  as  described  in
  subdivision  (1)  of  this  section,  and
  factors  that  could  result  in  medicaid
  disbursements  for  the  relevant  state
  770  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

  fiscal  year  to  exceed  the  projected
  department of health state funds disburse-
  ments in the enacted budget financial plan
  pursuant to subdivision 3 of section 23 of
  the  state finance law, including spending
  increases or decreases due to:  enrollment
  fluctuations,  rate  changes,  utilization
  changes, MRT  investments,  and  shift  of
  beneficiaries  to  managed care; and vari-
  ations in offline medicaid  payments;  and
  (b)  the  actions  taken  to implement any
  medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment
  implemented pursuant to subdivision (4) of
  this  section,  including  information
  concerning the impact of such  actions  on
  each  category  of  service  and  each
  geographic region of the state. Each  such
  quarterly  report shall be provided to the
  chairs  of  the  senate  finance  and  the
  assembly  ways  and  means  committees and
  shall  be  posted  on  the  department  of
  health's website in a timely manner.
 For  the  purpose  of  making  payments  to
  providers  of  medical  care  pursuant  to
  section  367-b of the social services law,
  and for payment of state  aid  to  munici-
  palities  where  payment  systems  through
  fiscal intermediaries are not operational,
  to  reimburse  such  providers  for  costs
  attributable  to  the provision of care to
  patients eligible for medical  assistance.
  Payments from this appropriation to gener-
  al  hospitals  related  to  indigent  care
  pursuant  to  article  28  of  the  public
  health  law  respectively,  when  combined
  with  federal  funds  for  services  and
  expenses  for  the  medical  assistance
  program  pursuant  to  title  XIX  of  the
  federal social security act or its succes-
  sor program, shall equal the amount of the
  funds  received  related  to  health  care
  reform  act  allowances  and  surcharges
  pursuant  to  article  28  of  the  public
  health law and deposited to  this  account
  less any such amounts withheld pursuant to
  subdivision  21  of  section 2807-c of the
  public  health  law.  Notwithstanding  any
  inconsistent  provision of law, the moneys
  hereby appropriated may  be  increased  or
  decreased  by interchange or transfer with
  any appropriation  of  the  department  of
  health  with  the approval of the director
  771  12653-02-4

  of  the  budget,  who  shall  file  such
  approval  with the department of audit and
  control and copies thereof with the chair-
  man  of  the  senate finance committee and
  the chairman  of  the  assembly  ways  and
  means committee.
 Notwithstanding section 2807-k of the Public
  Health  Law, or any inconsistent provision
  of law, and subject to the availability of
  federal financial participation, for peri-
  ods on and after January 1,  2020  through
  March  31,  2025,  all funds available for
  distribution pursuant to  subdivision  5-d
  of section 2807-k of the public health law
  shall  be  distributed  in accordance with
  the provisions below.
 The commissioner of the department of health
  shall establish methodologies  for  deter-
  mining  each facility's relative uncompen-
  sated care need amount based on  uninsured
  inpatient  and outpatient units of service
  from the cost  reporting  year  two  years
  prior to the distribution year, multiplied
  by the applicable medicaid rates in effect
  January first of the distribution year, as
  summed  and  adjusted  by a statewide cost
  adjustment factor and reduced by  the  sum
  of all payment amounts collected from such
  uninsured  patients,  and  as  further
  adjusted by application of a nominal  need
  computation  that  shall take into account
  each facility's medicaid inpatient share.
 Annual distributions pursuant to such  regu-
  lations  for  the 2024-2026 calendar years
  shall be in  accord  with  the  following:
  $139,400,000 shall be distributed as Medi-
  caid  DSH payments to major general public
  hospitals,  and  $969,900,000  shall  be
  distributed  as  Medicaid  DSH payments to
  eligible  general  hospitals,  other  than
  major  public  general hospitals, for each
  of the calendar years 2024-2026,  provided
  that  the  total distributions to eligible
  general hospitals, other than major public
  general hospitals, shall be subject  to  a
  reduction  of  $235,400,000  annually, and
  further  provided  that  eligible  general
  hospitals other than public general hospi-
  tals  who  qualify  as enhanced safety net
  hospitals  under  section  2807-k  of  the
  public  health law shall not be subject to
  such reduction.
  772  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
 Such reduction  shall  be  determined  by  a
  methodology  to  be  established  by  the
  department of health which may  take  into
  account  the  payor mix of each non-public
  general hospital, including the percentage
  of  inpatient  days  paid  by  the medical
  assistance program.
 For  calendar  years  2024-2026,  eligible
  general  hospitals other than major public
  general hospitals that qualify as enhanced
  safety net hospitals under sections 2087-c
  and section 2807-k of  the  public  health
  law  which  experience  a  reduction  in
  payments pursuant to section 2807-k of the
  public health law shall receive a distrib-
  ution of $64,600,000 annually proportional
  to the reduction experienced by the facil-
  ity and pursuant to a  methodology  deter-
  mined to the commissioner.

  as  a result of a natural or other type of
  disaster, including a governmental  decla-
  ration of emergency.
 The  director of the budget, in consultation
  with the  commissioner  of  health,  shall
  assess  on  a  quarterly  basis  known and
  projected medicaid expenditures by catego-
  ry of service and by geographic region, as
  determined by the commissioner of  health,
  incurred  both  prior to and subsequent to
  such assessment for each such period,  and
  if  the  director of the budget determines
  that such  expenditures  are  expected  to
  cause medicaid spending for such period to
  exceed the aggregate limit specified here-
  in  for  such  period,  the state medicaid
  director, in consultation with the  direc-
  tor  of the budget and the commissioner of
  health, shall develop a  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment to limit such spend-
  ing to the aggregate limit specified here-
  in for such period.
 Such  medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  shall be designed, to reduce the  expendi-
  tures  authorized  by  the  appropriations
  herein in compliance  with  the  following
  guidelines:  (1)  reductions shall be made
  in compliance with applicable federal law,
  including the provisions  of  the  Patient
  Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law  No.  111-148, and the Health Care and
  Education  Reconciliation  Act  of  2010,

  gated thereunder; (2) reductions shall  be
  made  in  a  manner that complies with the
  state medicaid plan approved by the feder-
  al  centers  for  medicare  and  medicaid
  services,  provided,  however,  that  the
  commissioner  of  health  is authorized to
  submit any state plan  amendment  or  seek
  other  federal  approval, including waiver
  authority, to implement the provisions  of
  the medicaid savings allocation adjustment
  that  meets  the  other criteria set forth
  herein; (3) reductions shall be made in  a
  manner  that  maximizes  federal financial
  participation, to the extent  practicable,
  including  any  federal  financial partic-
  ipation that is available or is reasonably
  expected  to  become  available,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, under the
  Affordable Care Act; (4) reductions  shall
  be  made  uniformly  among  categories  of
  services and  geographic  regions  of  the
  state,  to  the  extent  practicable,  and
  shall be made uniformly within a  category
  of  service,  to  the  extent practicable,
  except where the  commissioner  determines
  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  for
  non-uniformity, including but not  limited
  to:  the  extent to which specific catego-
  ries of services contributed to department
  of health medicaid state funds spending in
  excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need to maintain safety  net  services  in
  underserved  communities; or the potential
  benefits of  pursuing  innovative  payment
  models contemplated by the Affordable Care
  Act,  in  which case such grounds shall be
  set forth in the  medicaid  savings  allo-
  cation  adjustment;  and  (5)  reductions
  shall be made in a manner  that  does  not
  unnecessarily  create  administrative
  burdens to medicaid applicants and recipi-
  ents or providers.
 The commissioner shall seek the input of the
  legislature,  as  well  as  organizations
  representing  health  care  providers,
  consumers,  businesses,  workers,  health
  insurers,  and others with relevant exper-
  tise, in developing such medicaid  savings
  allocation  adjustment, to the extent that
  all or part of  such  adjustment,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, is likely
  to have a material impact on  the  overall
  775  12653-02-4

  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES  2024-25
 
  medicaid program, particular categories of
  service  or  particular geographic regions
  of the state.
 (a) The commissioner shall post the medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  on  the
  department of health's website  and  shall
  provide written copies of such plan to the
  chairs  of  the  senate  finance  and  the
  assembly  ways  and  means  committees  at
  least  30  days  before  the date on which
  implementation is expected to begin.
 (b) The commissioner may revise the medicaid
  savings allocation  adjustment  subsequent
  to  the  provisions of notice and prior to
  implementation but needs to provide a  new
  notice  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i) of
  this paragraph only  if  the  commissioner
  determines, in his or her discretion, that
  such revisions materially alter the plan.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,  the
  commissioner  need  not  seek  the  input
  described  in paragraph (a) of this subdi-
  vision or provide notice pursuant to para-
  graph (b) of this subdivision if,  in  the
  discretion  of the commissioner, expedited
  development and implementation of a  medi-
  caid  savings  allocation  adjustment  is
  necessary due to a public health  emergen-
  cy.
 For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  public
  health emergency  is  defined  as:  (i)  a
  disaster,  natural  or  otherwise,  that
  significantly increases the immediate need
  for health care personnel in  an  area  of
  the state; (ii) an event or condition that
  creates a widespread risk of exposure to a
  serious  communicable  disease,  or  the
  potential  for  such  widespread  risk  of
  exposure;  or  (iii)  any  other  event or
  condition determined by  the  commissioner
  to constitute an imminent threat to public
  health.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
  prevent  all  or  part  of  such  medicaid
  savings allocation adjustment from  taking
  effect retroactively to the extent permit-
  ted  by  the  federal centers for medicare
  and medicaid services.
 In  accordance  with  the  medicaid  savings
  allocation adjustment, the commissioner of
  the  department  of  health  shall  reduce

  ance programs and for state  administration  of  medical  assistance
  programs, notwithstanding section 153 of the social services law, to
  include the performance of eligibility and enrollment determinations
  by  the  state  or  third-party  entities designated by the state to
  perform such services.
  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, subject  to  the
  approval  of the director of budget, up to $23,000,000 of the amount
  appropriated herein shall be available for the purpose of  providing
  payments  to  local social services districts for medical assistance

  lished by the commissioner of health.
  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent provision of law and subject to the
  approval of the director of budget, moneys hereby  appropriated  may
  836  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

  be  increased  or decreased by transfer or interchange between these
  appropriated amounts and appropriations of  the  medical  assistance
  administration  program,  the  medical  assistance  program, and the
  office  of  health  insurance  programs. Funding authority from this
  account used for state  administration  of  the  medical  assistance
  program may be transferred to state operations appropriations within
  the  aforementioned  programs  at amounts agreed upon by the commis-
  sioner of health, and the New York state division of the budget.
  Notwithstanding section 40 of the state finance law or any  other  law
  to  the  contrary,  all  medical assistance appropriations made from
  this account shall remain in full force and effect in accordance, in
  the aggregate, with the following schedule: not more than 50 percent
  for the period April 1, 2023 to March 31,  2024  and  the  remaining
  amount  for  the  period  April  1, 2024 to [March 31] SEPTEMBER 15,
  2025.
  Notwithstanding section 40 of the state finance law or  any  provision
  of  law  to the contrary, subject to federal approval, department of
  health state funds medicaid spending, excluding payments for medical
  services provided at state facilities  operated  by  the  office  of
  mental health, the office for people with developmental disabilities
  and  the  office  of  addiction  services  and  supports and further
  excluding any payments which are not appropriated within the depart-
  ment of health, in the aggregate,  for  the  period  April  1,  2023
  through  March  31, 2024, shall not exceed $28,109,771,000 except as
  provided below and state share medicaid spending, in the  aggregate,
  for  the period April 1, 2024 through [March 31] SEPTEMBER 15, 2025,
  shall not exceed [$31,020,880,000] $31,284,010,000, but in no  event
  shall  department  of  health  state funds medicaid spending for the
  period April 1, 2023 through [March 31] SEPTEMBER  15,  2025  exceed
  [$59,130,651,000]  $59,393,781,000 provided, however, such aggregate
  limits may be adjusted by the director of the budget to account  for
  any  changes  in  the  New  York  state  federal  medical assistance
  percentage amount established pursuant to the federal social securi-
  ty act, increases in provider revenues, reductions in  local  social
  services  district  payments  for medical assistance administration,
  minimum wage increases, and beginning April 1, 2012 the  operational
  costs  of  the  New  York  state medical indemnity fund, pursuant to
  chapter 59 of the laws of 2011, and state costs or savings from  the
  essential  plan  program.  Such  projections  may be adjusted by the
  director of the budget to account for increased or expedited depart-
  ment of health state funds medicaid expenditures as a  result  of  a
  natural or other type of disaster, including a governmental declara-
  tion of emergency.
  The  director  of the budget, in consultation with the commissioner of
  health, shall assess on a quarterly basis known and projected  medi-
  caid  expenditures  by category of service and by geographic region,
  as determined by the commissioner of health, incurred both prior  to
  and  subsequent  to such assessment for each such period, and if the
  director  of  the  budget  determines  that  such  expenditures  are
  expected  to  cause  medicaid spending for such period to exceed the
  aggregate limit specified herein for such period, the state medicaid
  director, in consultation with the director of the  budget  and  the
  837  12653-02-4

  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25
 
  commissioner  of health, shall develop a medicaid savings allocation
  adjustment to limit such spending to the aggregate  limit  specified
  herein for such period.
  Such  medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment  shall be designed, to
  reduce the expenditures authorized by the appropriations  herein  in
  compliance  with  the  following guidelines: (1) reductions shall be
  made in  compliance  with  applicable  federal  law,  including  the
  provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law  No.  111-148,  and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
  Act of 2010, Public Law No. 111-152 (collectively  "Affordable  Care
  Act")  and  any subsequent amendments thereto or regulations promul-
  gated thereunder; (2) reductions shall be  made  in  a  manner  that
  complies  with  the  state  medicaid  plan  approved  by the federal
  centers for medicare and medicaid services, provided, however,  that
  the  commissioner  of  health is authorized to submit any state plan
  amendment or seek other federal approval, including waiver  authori-
  ty,  to  implement the provisions of the medicaid savings allocation
  adjustment that meets the  other  criteria  set  forth  herein;  (3)
  reductions  shall  be made in a manner that maximizes federal finan-
  cial participation, to the extent practicable, including any federal
  financial participation that is available or is reasonably  expected
  to  become  available,  in the discretion of the commissioner, under
  the Affordable Care Act; (4)  reductions  shall  be  made  uniformly
  among categories of services and geographic regions of the state, to
  the extent practicable, and shall be made uniformly within a catego-
  ry  of  service, to the extent practicable, except where the commis-
  sioner determines that there are sufficient grounds for non-uniform-
  ity, including but not limited to:  the  extent  to  which  specific
  categories  of services contributed to department of health medicaid
  state funds spending in excess of the limits specified  herein;  the
  need  to maintain safety net services in underserved communities; or
  the potential benefits of pursuing innovative payment models contem-
  plated by the Affordable Care Act, in which case such grounds  shall
  be  set forth in the medicaid savings allocation adjustment; and (5)
  reductions shall be made in a manner  that  does  not  unnecessarily
  create  administrative burdens to medicaid applicants and recipients
  or providers.
  The commissioner shall seek the input of the legislature, as  well  as
  organizations  representing  health care providers, consumers, busi-
  nesses, workers, health insurers, and others  with  relevant  exper-
  tise,  in developing such medicaid savings allocation adjustment, to
  the extent that all or part of such adjustment, in the discretion of
  the commissioner, is likely to have a material impact on the overall
  medicaid program, particular categories  of  service  or  particular
  geographic regions of the state.
  (a)  The  commissioner  shall  post  the  medicaid  savings allocation
  adjustment on the department of health's website and  shall  provide
  written  copies  of  such  adjustment  to  the  chairs of the senate
  finance and the assembly ways and means committees at least 30  days
  before the date on which implementation is expected to begin.
  (b)  The  commissioner  may  revise  the  medicaid  savings allocation
  adjustment subsequent to the  provisions  of  notice  and  prior  to
  838  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25
 
  implementation but needs to provide a new notice pursuant to subpar-
  agraph (i) of this paragraph only if the commissioner determines, in
  his  or  her  discretion,  that  such revisions materially alter the
  adjustment.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  (a)  and (b) of this
  subdivision, the commissioner need not seek the input  described  in
  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision  or provide notice pursuant to
  paragraph (b) of this subdivision  if,  in  the  discretion  of  the
  commissioner, expedited development and implementation of a medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  is necessary due to a public health
  emergency.
  For purposes of this section, a public health emergency is defined as:
  (i) a disaster, natural or otherwise, that  significantly  increases
  the  immediate  need  for  health  care  personnel in an area of the
  state; (ii) an event or condition that creates a widespread risk  of
  exposure  to  a  serious  communicable disease, or the potential for
  such widespread risk of exposure; or (iii) any other event or condi-
  tion determined by the commissioner to constitute an imminent threat
  to public health.
  Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prevent all  or  part  of
  such  medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment  from  taking effect
  retroactively to the extent permitted by  the  federal  centers  for
  medicare and medicaid services.
  In  accordance  with  the  medicaid savings allocation adjustment, the
  commissioner of the department of health shall reduce department  of
  health  state funds medicaid spending by the amount of the projected
  overspending through, actions including, but not limited to  modify-
  ing  or  suspending reimbursement methods, including but not limited
  to all fees, premium levels and rates  of  payment,  notwithstanding
  any  provision of law that sets a specific amount or methodology for
  any such payments or rates of payment;  modifying  medicaid  program
  benefits;  seeking  all  necessary federal approvals, including, but
  not limited to  waivers,  waiver  amendments;  and  suspending  time
  frames  for  notice, approval or certification of rate requirements,
  notwithstanding any provision of law,  rule  or  regulation  to  the
  contrary, including but not limited to sections 2807 and 3614 of the
  public  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the laws of 1988, and
  18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
  The department of health shall prepare a quarterly  report  that  sets
  forth: (a) known and projected department of health medicaid expend-
  itures  as described in subdivision (1) of this section, and factors
  that could result in medicaid disbursements for the  relevant  state
  fiscal year to exceed the projected department of health state funds
  disbursements  in  the  enacted  budget  financial  plan pursuant to
  subdivision 3 of section 23 of  the  state  finance  law,  including
  spending  increases  or  decreases  due to: enrollment fluctuations,
  rate changes, utilization changes, MRT  investments,  and  shift  of
  beneficiaries  to  managed  care; and variations in offline medicaid
  payments; and (b)  the  actions  taken  to  implement  any  medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  implemented pursuant to subdivision
  (4) of this section, including information concerning the impact  of
  such  actions on each category of service and each geographic region

 MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
 
  General Fund
  Local Assistance Account - 10000
 
 The appropriation made by chapter 53, section 1, of the laws of 2023  is
  hereby amended and reappropriated to read:
  For the medical assistance program, including administrative expenses,
  for  local social services districts, and for medical care rates for
  authorized child care agencies.
  Notwithstanding section 40 of the state finance law or any  other  law
  to  the  contrary,  all  medical assistance appropriations made from
  this account shall remain in full force and effect in accordance, in
  the aggregate, with the following schedule: not more than 47 percent
  for the period April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024;  and  the  remaining
  amount  for  the  period  April  1, 2024 to [March 31] SEPTEMBER 15,
  2025.
  Notwithstanding section 40 of the state finance law or  any  provision
  of  law  to the contrary, subject to federal approval, department of
  health state funds medicaid spending, excluding payments for medical
  services provided at state facilities  operated  by  the  office  of
  mental health, the office for people with developmental disabilities
  and  the  office  of  addiction  services  and  supports and further
  excluding any payments which are not appropriated within the depart-
  ment of health, in the aggregate,  for  the  period  April  1,  2023
  through  March  31, 2024, shall not exceed $28,109,771,000 except as
  provided below and state share medicaid spending, in the  aggregate,
  for  the period April 1, 2024 through [March 31] SEPTEMBER 15, 2025,
  shall not exceed [$31,020,880,000] $31,284,010,000 but in  no  event
  shall  department  of  health  state funds medicaid spending for the
  period April 1, 2023 through [March 31] SEPTEMBER  15,  2025  exceed
  [$59,130,651,000] $59,393,781,000. Provided, however, such aggregate
  limits  may be adjusted by the director of the budget to account for
  any changes  in  the  New  York  state  federal  medical  assistance
  percentage amount established pursuant to the federal social securi-
  ty  act,  increases in provider revenues, reductions in local social
  services district payments for  medical  assistance  administration,
  minimum  wage increases, and beginning April 1, 2012 the operational
  costs of the New York state  medical  indemnity  fund,  pursuant  to
  chapter  59 of the laws of 2011, and state costs or savings from the
  essential plan program. Such projections  may  be  adjusted  by  the
  director of the budget to account for increased or expedited depart-
  ment  of  health  state funds medicaid expenditures as a result of a

  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25

  natural or other type of disaster, including a governmental declara-
  tion of emergency.
  The  director  of the budget, in consultation with the commissioner of
  health, shall assess on a quarterly basis known and projected  medi-
  caid  expenditures  by category of service and by geographic region,
  as defined by the commissioner, incurred both prior  to  and  subse-
  quent  to  such assessment for each such period, and if the director
  of the budget determines that  such  expenditures  are  expected  to
  cause  medicaid  spending  for  such  period to exceed the aggregate
  limit specified herein for such period, the state medicaid director,
  in consultation with the director of the budget and the commissioner
  of health, shall develop a medicaid savings allocation adjustment to
  limit such spending to the aggregate limit specified herein for such
  period.
  Such medicaid savings allocation  adjustment  shall  be  designed,  to
  reduce  the  expenditures authorized by the appropriations herein in
  compliance with the following guidelines: (1)  reductions  shall  be
  made  in  compliance  with  applicable  federal  law,  including the
  provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law No. 111-148, and the Health Care  and  Education  Reconciliation
  Act  of  2010, Public Law No. 111-152 (collectively "Affordable Care
  Act") and any subsequent amendments thereto or  regulations  promul-
  gated  thereunder;  (2)  reductions  shall  be made in a manner that
  complies with the  state  medicaid  plan  approved  by  the  federal
  centers  for medicare and medicaid services, provided, however, that
  the commissioner of health is authorized to submit  any  state  plan
  amendment  or seek other federal approval, including waiver authori-
  ty, to implement the provisions of the medicaid  savings  allocation
  adjustment  that  meets  the  other  criteria  set forth herein; (3)
  reductions shall be made in a manner that maximizes  federal  finan-
  cial participation, to the extent practicable, including any federal
  financial  participation that is available or is reasonably expected
  to become available, in the discretion of  the  commissioner,  under
  the  Affordable  Care  Act;  (4)  reductions shall be made uniformly
  among categories of services and geographic regions of the state, to
  the extent practicable, and shall be made uniformly within a catego-
  ry of service, to the extent practicable, except where  the  commis-
  sioner determines that there are sufficient grounds for non-uniform-
  ity,  including  but  not  limited  to: the extent to which specific
  categories of services contributed to department of health  medicaid
  state  funds  spending in excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need to maintain safety net services in underserved communities;  or
  the potential benefits of pursuing innovative payment models contem-
  plated  by the Affordable Care Act, in which case such grounds shall
  be set forth in the medicaid savings allocation adjustment; and  (5)
  reductions  shall  be  made  in a manner that does not unnecessarily
  create administrative burdens to medicaid applicants and  recipients
  or providers.
  The  commissioner  shall seek the input of the legislature, as well as
  organizations representing health care providers,  consumers,  busi-
  nesses,  workers,  health  insurers, and others with relevant exper-
  tise, in developing such medicaid savings allocation adjustment,  to
  846  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25
 
  the extent that all or part of such adjustment, in the discretion of
  the commissioner, is likely to have a material impact on the overall
  medicaid  program,  particular  categories  of service or particular
  geographic regions of the state.
  (a)  The  commissioner  shall  post  the  medicaid  savings allocation
  adjustment on the department of health's website and  shall  provide
  written  copies  of  such  adjustment  to  the  chairs of the senate
  finance and the assembly ways and means committees at least 30  days
  before the date on which implementation is expected to begin.
  (b)  The  commissioner  may  revise  the  medicaid  savings allocation
  adjustment subsequent to the  provisions  of  notice  and  prior  to
  implementation but needs to provide a new notice pursuant to subpar-
  agraph (i) of this paragraph only if the commissioner determines, in
  his  or  her  discretion,  that  such revisions materially alter the
  adjustment.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of  this
  subdivision,  the  commissioner need not seek the input described in
  paragraph (a) of this subdivision  or  provide  notice  pursuant  to
  paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision  if,  in the discretion of the
  commissioner, expedited development and implementation of a medicaid
  savings allocation adjustment is necessary due to  a  public  health
  emergency.
  For purposes of this section, a public health emergency is defined as:
  (i)  a  disaster, natural or otherwise, that significantly increases
  the immediate need for health care  personnel  in  an  area  of  the
  state;  (ii) an event or condition that creates a widespread risk of
  exposure to a serious communicable disease,  or  the  potential  for
  such widespread risk of exposure; or (iii) any other event or condi-
  tion determined by the commissioner to constitute an imminent threat
  to public health.
  Nothing  in  this  paragraph shall be deemed to prevent all or part of
  such medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment  from  taking  effect
  retroactively  to  the  extent  permitted by the federal centers for
  medicare and medicaid services.
  In accordance with the medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment,  the
  commissioner  of the department of health shall reduce department of
  health state funds medicaid spending by the amount of the  projected
  overspending  through, actions including, but not limited to modify-
  ing or suspending reimbursement methods, including but  not  limited
  to  all  fees,  premium levels and rates of payment, notwithstanding
  any provision of law that sets a specific amount or methodology  for
  any  such  payments  or rates of payment; modifying or discontinuing
  medicaid program benefits; seeking all necessary federal  approvals,
  including,  but  not  limited  to  waivers,  waiver  amendments; and
  suspending time frames for notice, approval or certification of rate
  requirements, notwithstanding any provision of law,  rule  or  regu-
  lation  to  the contrary, including but not limited to sections 2807
  and 3614 of the public health law, section 18 of chapter  2  of  the
  laws of 1988, and 18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
  The  department  of  health shall prepare a quarterly report that sets
  forth: (a) known and projected department of health medicaid expend-
  itures as described in subdivision (1) of this section, and  factors
  847  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25
 
  that  could  result in medicaid disbursements for the relevant state
  fiscal year to exceed the projected department of health state funds
  disbursements in the  enacted  budget  financial  plan  pursuant  to
  subdivision  3  of  section  23  of the state finance law, including
  spending increases or decreases  due  to:  enrollment  fluctuations,
  rate  changes,  utilization  changes,  MRT investments, and shift of
  beneficiaries to managed care; and variations  in  offline  medicaid
  payments;  and  (b)  the  actions  taken  to  implement any medicaid
  savings allocation adjustment implemented  pursuant  to  subdivision
  (4)  of this section, including information concerning the impact of
  such actions on each category of service and each geographic  region
  of  the  state.  Each such quarterly report shall be provided to the
  chairs of the senate finance and the assembly ways and means commit-
  tees and shall be posted on the department of health's website in  a
  timely manner.
  The  money  hereby  appropriated is to be available for payment of aid
  heretofore accrued or hereafter accrued to  municipalities,  and  to
  providers  of  medical  services  pursuant  to  section 367-b of the
  social services law, and for payment of state aid to  municipalities
  and  to  providers  of family care where payment systems through the
  fiscal intermediaries are not operational.
  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of  law  to  the  contrary,
  funds  may be used by the department for outside legal assistance on

  the  orderly  and prompt payment of providers under section 367-b of
  the social services law pursuant to  an  estimate  provided  by  the
  commissioner  of  health  of  each  local social services district's
  share of payments made pursuant  to  section  367-b  of  the  social
  services law.
  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, funding made avail-
  able  by  these appropriations shall support direct salary costs and
  related fringe benefits within the medical assistance program  asso-
  ciated  with  any minimum wage increase that takes effect during the
  timeframe of these appropriations, pursuant to section  652  of  the
  labor  law.  Each  eligible  organization in receipt of funding made
  available by these appropriations may be required to submit  written
  certification,  in  such  form and at such time the commissioner may

  [$59,130,651,000] $59,393,781,000 provided, however, such  aggregate
  limits  may be adjusted by the director of the budget to account for
  any changes  in  the  New  York  state  federal  medical  assistance
  percentage amount established pursuant to the federal social securi-
  ty  act,  increases in provider revenues, reductions in local social
  services district payments for  medical  assistance  administration,
  minimum  wage  increases and beginning April 1, 2012 the operational
  costs of the New York state  medical  indemnity  fund,  pursuant  to
  chapter  59 of the laws of 2011, and state costs or savings from the
  essential plan program. Such projections  may  be  adjusted  by  the
  director of the budget to account for increased or expedited depart-
  ment  of  health  state funds medicaid expenditures as a result of a
  natural or other type of disaster, including a governmental declara-
  tion of emergency.
  The director of the budget, in consultation with the  commissioner  of
  health,  shall assess on a quarterly basis known and projected medi-
  caid expenditures by category of service and by  geographic  region,
  as  determined by the commissioner of health, incurred both prior to
  and subsequent to such assessment for each such period, and  if  the
  director  of  the  budget  determines  that  such  expenditures  are
  expected to cause medicaid spending for such period  to  exceed  the
  aggregate limit specified herein for such period, the state medicaid
  director,  in  consultation  with the director of the budget and the
  commissioner of health, shall develop a medicaid savings  allocation
  adjustment  to  limit such spending to the aggregate limit specified
  herein for such period.
  Such medicaid savings allocation  adjustment  shall  be  designed,  to
  reduce  the  expenditures authorized by the appropriations herein in
  compliance with the following guidelines: (1)  reductions  shall  be
  made  in  compliance  with  applicable  federal  law,  including the
  provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law No. 111-148, and the Health Care  and  Education  Reconciliation
  Act  of  2010, Public Law No. 111-152 (collectively "Affordable Care
  Act") and any subsequent amendments thereto or  regulations  promul-
  gated  thereunder;  (2)  reductions  shall  be made in a manner that
  complies with the  state  medicaid  plan  approved  by  the  federal
  centers  for medicare and medicaid services, provided, however, that
  the commissioner of health is authorized to submit  any  state  plan
  amendment  or seek other federal approval, including waiver authori-
  ty, to implement the provisions of the medicaid  savings  allocation
  adjustment  that  meets  the  other  criteria  set forth herein; (3)
  reductions shall be made in a manner that maximizes  federal  finan-
  cial participation, to the extent practicable, including any federal
  financial  participation that is available or is reasonably expected
  to become available, in the discretion of  the  commissioner,  under
  the  Affordable  Care  Act;  (4)  reductions shall be made uniformly
  among categories of services and geographic regions of the state, to
  the extent practicable, and shall be made uniformly within a catego-
  ry of service, to the extent practicable, except where  the  commis-
  sioner determines that there are sufficient grounds for non-uniform-
  ity,  including  but  not  limited  to: the extent to which specific
  categories of services contributed to department of health  medicaid
  868  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25
 
  state  funds  spending in excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need to maintain safety net services in underserved communities;  or
  the potential benefits of pursuing innovative payment models contem-
  plated  by the Affordable Care Act, in which case such grounds shall
  be set forth in the medicaid savings allocation adjustment; and  (5)
  reductions  shall  be  made  in a manner that does not unnecessarily
  create administrative burdens to medicaid applicants and  recipients
  or providers.  The commissioner shall seek the input of the legisla-
  ture,  as  well as organizations representing health care providers,
  consumers, businesses, workers, health  insurers,  and  others  with
  relevant  expertise,  in developing such medicaid savings allocation
  adjustment, to the extent that all or part of  such  adjustment,  in
  the  discretion  of  the  commissioner, is likely to have a material
  impact on the overall medicaid  program,  particular  categories  of
  service or particular geographic regions of the state.
  (a)  The  commissioner  shall  post  the  medicaid  savings allocation
  adjustment on the department of health's website and  shall  provide
  written  copies of such plan to the chairs of the senate finance and
  the assembly ways and means committees at least 30 days  before  the
  date on which implementation is expected to begin.
  (b)  The  commissioner  may  revise  the  medicaid  savings allocation
  adjustment subsequent to the  provisions  of  notice  and  prior  to
  implementation but needs to provide a new notice pursuant to subpar-
  agraph (i) of this paragraph only if the commissioner determines, in
  his  or  her  discretion,  that  such revisions materially alter the
  plan.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of  paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of  this
  subdivision,  the  commissioner need not seek the input described in
  paragraph (a) of this subdivision  or  provide  notice  pursuant  to
  paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision  if,  in the discretion of the
  commissioner, expedited development and implementation of a medicaid
  savings allocation adjustment is necessary due to  a  public  health
  emergency.
  For purposes of this section, a public health emergency is defined as:
  (i)  a  disaster, natural or otherwise, that significantly increases
  the immediate need for health care  personnel  in  an  area  of  the
  state;  (ii) an event or condition that creates a widespread risk of
  exposure to a serious communicable disease,  or  the  potential  for
  such widespread risk of exposure; or (iii) any other event or condi-
  tion determined by the commissioner to constitute an imminent threat
  to public health.
  Nothing  in  this  paragraph shall be deemed to prevent all or part of
  such medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment  from  taking  effect
  retroactively  to  the  extent  permitted by the federal centers for
  medicare and medicaid services.
  In accordance with the medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment,  the
  commissioner  of the department of health shall reduce department of
  health state funds medicaid spending by the amount of the  projected
  overspending  through, actions including, but not limited to modify-
  ing or suspending reimbursement methods, including but  not  limited
  to  all  fees,  premium levels and rates of payment, notwithstanding
  any provision of law that sets a specific amount or methodology  for
  869  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25
 
  any  such  payments  or rates of payment; modifying medicaid program
  benefits; seeking all necessary federal  approvals,  including,  but
  not  limited  to  waivers,  waiver  amendments;  and suspending time
  frames  for  notice, approval or certification of rate requirements,
  notwithstanding any provision of law,  rule  or  regulation  to  the
  contrary, including but not limited to sections 2807 and 3614 of the
  public  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the laws of 1988, and
  18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
  The department of health shall prepare a quarterly  report  that  sets
  forth: (a) known and projected department of health medicaid expend-
  itures  as described in subdivision (1) of this section, and factors
  that could result in medicaid disbursements for the  relevant  state
  fiscal year to exceed the projected department of health state funds
  disbursements  in  the  enacted  budget  financial  plan pursuant to
  subdivision 3 of section 23 of  the  state  finance  law,  including
  spending  increases  or  decreases  due to: enrollment fluctuations,
  rate changes, utilization changes, MRT  investments,  and  shift  of
  beneficiaries  to  managed  care; and variations in offline medicaid
  payments; and (b)  the  actions  taken  to  implement  any  medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  implemented pursuant to subdivision
  (4) of this section, including information concerning the impact  of
  such  actions on each category of service and each geographic region
  of the state. Each such quarterly report shall be  provided  to  the
  chairs of the senate finance and the assembly ways and means commit-
  tees  and shall be posted on the department of health's website in a
  timely manner.
  For the purpose of making payments to providers of medical care pursu-
  ant to section 367-b of the social services law, and for payment  of
  state  aid  to  municipalities  where payment systems through fiscal
  intermediaries are not operational, to reimburse such providers  for
  costs attributable to the provision of care to patients eligible for
  medical  assistance.  Payments  from  this  appropriation to general
  hospitals related to indigent care pursuant to  article  28  of  the
  public health law respectively, when combined with federal funds for
  services and expenses for the medical assistance program pursuant to
  title  XIX  of  the  federal  social  security  act or its successor
  program, shall equal the amount of the  funds  received  related  to
  health care reform act allowances and surcharges pursuant to article
  28  of  the public health law and deposited to this account less any
  such amounts withheld pursuant to subdivision 21 of  section  2807-c
  of  the  public  health  law.  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent
  provision of law, the moneys hereby appropriated may be increased or
  decreased by interchange or transfer with any appropriation  of  the
  department  of health with the approval of the director of the budg-
  et, who shall file such approval with the department  of  audit  and
  control  and  copies thereof with the chairman of the senate finance
  committee and the chairman of the assembly ways and means committee.
  Notwithstanding section 2807-k of the Public Health Law, or any incon-
  sistent provision of law, and subject to the availability of federal
  financial participation, for periods on and after  January  1,  2020
  through  March 31, 2025, all funds available for distribution pursu-

  ant to subdivision 5-d of section 2807-k of the  public  health  law
  shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions below.
  The commissioner of the department of health shall establish methodol-
  ogies  for  determining  each facility's relative uncompensated care
  need amount based on uninsured inpatient  and  outpatient  units  of
  service from the cost reporting year two years prior to the distrib-
  ution  year,  multiplied  by the applicable medicaid rates in effect
  January first of the distribution year, as summed and adjusted by  a
  statewide  cost  adjustment  factor  and  reduced  by the sum of all
  payment amounts collected  from  such  uninsured  patients,  and  as
  further  adjusted  by application of a nominal need computation that
  shall take into account each facility's medicaid inpatient share.
  Annual distributions pursuant to such regulations  for  the  2023-2025
  calendar  years  shall be in accord with the following: $139,400,000
  shall be distributed as  Medicaid  DSH  payments  to  major  general
  public  hospitals, and $969,900,000 shall be distributed as Medicaid
  DSH payments to eligible general hospitals, other than major  public
  general  hospitals,  for  each  of  the  calendar  years  2023-2025,
  provided that the total distributions to eligible general hospitals,
  other than major public general hospitals, shall  be  subject  to  a
  reduction of $235,400,000 annually, and further provided that eligi-
  ble general hospitals other than public general hospitals who quali-
  fy  as  enhanced  safety  net  hospitals under section 2807-k of the
  public health law shall not be subject to such reduction.
  Such reduction shall be determined by a methodology to be  established
  by  the  department  of health which may take into account the payor
  mix of each non-public general hospital, including the percentage of
  inpatient days paid by the medical assistance program.
  For calendar years 2023-2025, eligible general  hospitals  other  than
  major  public  general hospitals that qualify as enhanced safety net
  hospitals under sections 2087-c and section  2807-k  of  the  public
  health  law  which  experience  a  reduction in payments pursuant to
  section 2807-k of the public health law shall receive a distribution
  of $64,600,000 annually proportional to the reduction experienced by
  the facility and pursuant to a methodology determined to the commis-
  sioner.
  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the  portion  of
  this  appropriation covering fiscal year 2023-24 shall supersede and
  replace any duplicative (i)reappropriation for  this  item  covering

  that could result in medicaid disbursements for the  relevant  state
  fiscal year to exceed the projected department of health state funds
  disbursements  in  the  enacted  budget  financial  plan pursuant to
  subdivision 3 of section 23 of  the  state  finance  law,  including
  spending  increases  or  decreases  due to: enrollment fluctuations,

 The appropriation made by chapter 53, section 1, of the laws of 2023, is
  hereby amended and reappropriated to read:
  Notwithstanding  section  40 of the state finance law or any other law
  to the contrary, all medical  assistance  appropriations  made  from
  this account shall remain in full force and effect in accordance, in
  the aggregate, with the following schedule: not more than 53 percent
  for  the  period  April 1, [2022] 2023 to March 31, [2023] 2024; and
  the remaining amount for the period April 1, [2023]  2024  to  March
  31, [2024] 2025.
  Notwithstanding  section  40 of the state finance law or any provision
  of law to the contrary, subject to federal approval,  department  of
  health state funds medicaid spending, excluding payments for medical
  services  provided  at  state  facilities  operated by the office of
  mental health, the office for people with developmental disabilities
  and the office  of  addiction  services  and  supports  and  further
  excluding any payments which are not appropriated within the depart-
  ment  of  health,  in  the  aggregate,  for the period April 1, 2023
  through March 31, 2024, shall not exceed $28,109,771,000  except  as
  provided  below and state share medicaid spending, in the aggregate,
  for the period April 1, 2024 through [March 31] SEPTEMBER 15,  2025,
  shall  not exceed [$31,020,880,000] $31,284,010,000, but in no event
  shall department of health state funds  medicaid  spending  for  the
  period  April  1,  2023 through [March 31] SEPTEMBER 15, 2025 exceed
  [$59,130,651,000] $59,393,781,000 provided, however, such  aggregate
  limits  may be adjusted by the director of the budget to account for
  any changes  in  the  New  York  state  federal  medical  assistance
  percentage amount established pursuant to the federal social securi-
  ty  act,  increases in provider revenues, reductions in local social
  services district payments for  medical  assistance  administration,
  minimum  wage  increases and beginning April 1, 2012 the operational
  costs of the New York state  medical  indemnity  fund,  pursuant  to
  chapter  59 of the laws of 2011, and state costs or savings from the
  essential plan. Such projections may be adjusted by the director  of
  the  budget  to  account  for  increased  or expedited department of
  health state funds medicaid expenditures as a result of a natural or
  other type of disaster,  including  a  governmental  declaration  of
  emergency.
  The  director  of the budget, in consultation with the commissioner of
  health, shall assess on a quarterly basis known and projected  medi-
  caid  expenditures  by category of service and by geographic region,
  as determined by the commissioner of health, incurred both prior  to
  and  subsequent  to such assessment for each such period, and if the
  director  of  the  budget  determines  that  such  expenditures  are
  expected  to  cause  medicaid spending for such period to exceed the
  aggregate limit specified herein for such period, the state medicaid
  director, in consultation with the director of the  budget  and  the
  commissioner  of health, shall develop a medicaid savings allocation
  adjustment to limit such spending to the aggregate  limit  specified
  herein for such period.
  Such  medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment  shall be designed, to
  reduce the expenditures authorized by the appropriations  herein  in
  compliance  with  the  following guidelines: (1) reductions shall be
  876  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
 
  AID TO LOCALITIES - REAPPROPRIATIONS  2024-25
 
  made in  compliance  with  applicable  federal  law,  including  the
  provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public
  Law  No.  111-148,  and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
  Act  of  2010, Public Law No. 111-152 (collectively "Affordable Care
  Act") and any subsequent amendments thereto or  regulations  promul-
  gated  thereunder;  (2)  reductions  shall  be made in a manner that
  complies with the  state  medicaid  plan  approved  by  the  federal
  centers  for medicare and medicaid services, provided, however, that
  the commissioner of health is authorized to submit  any  state  plan
  amendment  or seek other federal approval, including waiver authori-
  ty, to implement the provisions of the medicaid  savings  allocation
  adjustment  that  meets  the  other  criteria  set forth herein; (3)
  reductions shall be made in a manner that maximizes  federal  finan-
  cial participation, to the extent practicable, including any federal
  financial  participation that is available or is reasonably expected
  to become available, in the discretion of  the  commissioner,  under
  the  Affordable  Care  Act;  (4)  reductions shall be made uniformly
  among categories of services and geographic regions of the state, to
  the extent practicable, and shall be made uniformly within a catego-
  ry of service, to the extent practicable, except where  the  commis-
  sioner determines that there are sufficient grounds for non-uniform-
  ity,  including  but  not  limited  to: the extent to which specific
  categories of services contributed to department of health  medicaid
  state  funds  spending in excess of the limits specified herein; the
  need to maintain safety net services in underserved communities;  or
  the potential benefits of pursuing innovative payment models contem-
  plated  by the Affordable Care Act, in which case such grounds shall
  be set forth in the medicaid savings allocation adjustment; and  (5)
  reductions  shall  be  made  in a manner that does not unnecessarily
  create administrative burdens to medicaid applicants and  recipients
  or providers.
  The  commissioner  shall seek the input of the legislature, as well as
  organizations representing health care providers,  consumers,  busi-
  nesses,  workers,  health  insurers, and others with relevant exper-
  tise, in developing such medicaid savings allocation adjustment,  to
  the extent that all or part of such adjustment, in the discretion of
  the commissioner, is likely to have a material impact on the overall
  medicaid  program,  particular  categories  of service or particular
  geographic regions of the state.
  (a) The  commissioner  shall  post  the  medicaid  savings  allocation
  adjustment  on  the department of health's website and shall provide
  written copies of such plan to the chairs of the senate finance  and
  the  assembly  ways and means committees at least 30 days before the
  date on which implementation is expected to begin.
  (b) The  commissioner  may  revise  the  medicaid  savings  allocation
  adjustment  subsequent  to  the  provisions  of  notice and prior to
  implementation but needs to provide a new notice pursuant to subpar-
  agraph (i) of this paragraph only if the commissioner determines, in
  his or her discretion, that  such  revisions  materially  alter  the
  plan.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  (a)  and (b) of this
  subdivision, the commissioner need not seek the input  described  in
  877  12653-02-4
 
  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision  or provide notice pursuant to
  paragraph (b) of this subdivision  if,  in  the  discretion  of  the
  commissioner, expedited development and implementation of a medicaid
  savings  allocation  adjustment  is necessary due to a public health
  emergency.
  For purposes of this section, a public health emergency is defined as:
  (i) a disaster, natural or otherwise, that  significantly  increases
  the  immediate  need  for  health  care  personnel in an area of the
  state; (ii) an event or condition that creates a widespread risk  of
  exposure  to  a  serious  communicable disease, or the potential for
  such widespread risk of exposure; or (iii) any other event or condi-
  tion determined by the commissioner to constitute an imminent threat
  to public health.
  Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prevent all  or  part  of
  such  medicaid  savings  allocation  adjustment  from  taking effect
  retroactively to the extent permitted by  the  federal  centers  for
  medicare and medicaid services.
  In  accordance  with  the  medicaid savings allocation adjustment, the
  commissioner of the department of health shall reduce department  of
  health  state funds medicaid spending by the amount of the projected

  benefits;  seeking  all  necessary federal approvals, including, but
  not limited to  waivers,  waiver  amendments;  and  suspending  time
  frames  for  notice, approval or certification of rate requirements,
  notwithstanding any provision of law,  rule  or  regulation  to  the
  contrary, including but not limited to sections 2807 and 3614 of the
  public  health law, section 18 of chapter 2 of the laws of 1988, and
  18 NYCRR 505.14(h).
  The department of health shall prepare a quarterly  report  that  sets
  forth: (a) known and projected department of health medicaid expend-
  itures  as described in subdivision (1) of this section, and factors
  that could result in medicaid disbursements for the  relevant  state
  fiscal year to exceed the projected department of health state funds

  For  prompt  assistance  to  utility customers related to the costs of
  utility affordability programs  authorized  by  the  Public  Service
  Commission  and administered by the Department of Public Service, in
  consultation with the energy  affordability  policy  working  group.
  Additionally,  the  department  shall  establish  a  new,  expanded
  discount program to provide utility bill relief to  utility  custom-
  ers,  in  consultation  with the energy affordability policy working
  group, for residential customers that do not currently  qualify  for
  the  energy  affordability  policy program but whose income is below
  the state median income, provided however that  the  Public  Service
  Commission  shall  consider  the  feasibility  of  using area median
  income or other eligibility thresholds in the event the use of state
  median income prevents reaching all households that have  an  energy
  burden  greater  than six percent. Residential customers of electric
  corporations regulated by the Public Service Commission and the Long
  Island Power Authority, and its service provider shall  be  eligible
  to participate in the new, expanded discount program. The department
  shall also establish a program for such purpose to provide an energy
  affordability  guarantee  to  participating residential customers in
  the EmPower Plus Program administered by the New York  State  Energy
  Research  and  Development  Authority  who  electrify their homes in
  accordance  with  program  standards  required  by  the  authority;
  provided,  however, that the department is authorized to establish a
  cap on a residential customer's annual total electric usage by kilo-
  watt  hour  applicable  to  the  guarantee  when  establishing  such
  program.  The  energy affordability guarantee shall provide that any
  participating residential customers  in  the  EmPower  Plus  Program
  shall spend no more than six percent of household income on electric
  utility  bills for the estimated useful life of the related electri-
  fication project. The energy affordability guarantee  is  to  remain
  with the residence that participated in the Empower Plus Program and
  can  transfer  between tenants or owners through the electric corpo-
  ration's application for service, provided however that the benefits
  of this program can only be transferred to eligible new  tenants  or
