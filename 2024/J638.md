  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  July 2023, as Minority Mental Health  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim July 2023, as Minority
Mental Health Month in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Minority Mental Health Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mental  illness  affects  one in five adults and one in 10
children in America, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental  Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA); and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  mental  illness  is  a  leading  cause  of
disability, yet nearly two-thirds of people with  a  diagnosable  mental
illness  do  not  seek  treatment,  and  racial and ethnic groups in the
United States are even less likely to get help; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Minorities  are  less  likely  to  receive  diagnosis  and
treatment for their mental illness, have less access to and availability
of  mental health services, and often receive a poorer quality of mental
health care; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Minority Mental Health Month has been instrumental
in raising awareness in  communities  throughout  the  country,  and  in
encouraging  everyone  to  learn  more about improving mental health and
illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim July 2023, as Minority
Mental Health Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
