  26. "NATURE-BASED SOLUTION" SHALL MEAN  A  PROJECT  THAT  UTILIZES  OR

 UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS  TO  ENSURE  THE  MINIMIZATION  OF
 CONFLICTS WITH FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATION.
  (2)  CONTINUE  DEVELOPING  INTEGRATED  GUIDANCE  FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF
 TIDAL SHORELINE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE A TECHNICAL  BASIS  FOR  THE  COORDI-
 NATION  OF PERMIT DECISIONS REQUIRED BY ANY REGULATORY ENTITY EXERCISING
 AUTHORITY OVER A SHORELINE MANAGEMENT PROJECT. SUCH GUIDANCE SHALL:
  (I) COMMUNICATE TO STAKEHOLDERS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES THAT IT  IS
 THE POLICY OF THE STATE THAT SOME SHORELINES SHALL REMAIN NATURAL UNLESS
 STABILIZATION  IS NECESSARY, AND WHEN STABILIZATION IS DEEMED NECESSARY,
 IT SHALL SUPPORT NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS AS THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE FOR
 STABILIZING TIDAL SHORELINES;
  (II) IDENTIFY PREFERRED SHORELINE MANAGEMENT APPROACHES FOR THE SHORE-
 LINE AND COMMUNITY TYPES FOUND IN THE STATE;
  (III) EXPLAIN THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF PROTECTION PROVIDED BY VARIOUS
 SHORELINE SYSTEM ELEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH MANAGEMENT OPTION; AND
  (IV) RECOMMEND PROCEDURES TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCY AND  EFFECTIVENESS  BY
 THE  VARIOUS  REGULATORY  ENTITIES EXERCISING AUTHORITY OVER A SHORELINE
 MANAGEMENT PROJECT.
  (3) GIVE PREFERENCE TO A PERMIT APPLICATION FOR A SHORELINE MANAGEMENT
 PROJECT BASED ON NATURE-BASED  SOLUTION  DESIGN  UNLESS  AN  ALTERNATIVE
 ANALYSIS  CONTAINING  A  REVIEW OF NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN
 EVALUATED  USING  THE  BEST  AVAILABLE  INFORMATION  SHOWS  THAT  SUCH
 APPROACHES  ARE NOT SUITABLE. IF THIS ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT A NATURE-BASED
 SOLUTION APPROACH IS UNSUITABLE  OR  INCONSISTENT  WITH  LAND-USE  REGU-
 LATIONS,  THE  DEPARTMENT SHALL REQUIRE THE APPLICANT TO INCORPORATE, TO
 THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE, ELEMENTS OF A  NATURE-BASED  SOLUTION  THAT
 ARE SUITABLE FOR THE PROJECT WHERE APPROPRIATE.
  B.  (1)  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, "NATURE-BASED SOLUTION"
 SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS  DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION  TWENTY-SIX  OF
 SECTION  1-0303  OF  THIS CHAPTER AND SHALL SPECIFICALLY MEAN TECHNIQUES
 APPLIED WITHIN THE TIDAL ZONE THAT INCORPORATE  NATURAL,  NATIVE  LIVING
 FEATURES.
  (2)  WHEN  CONSIDERING  A  NATURE-BASED SOLUTION THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD
 PRIORITIZE TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE THAT:
  (I) CONTROL OR REDUCE SHORELINE  EROSION  WHILE  MAINTAINING  BENEFITS
 COMPARABLE  TO  THE  NATURAL  SHORELINE  INCLUDING,  BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 ALLOWING FOR NATURAL SEDIMENT MOVEMENT;
  (II) IMPROVE, RESTORE, OR MAINTAIN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN  THE  UPLAND
 AND WATER HABITATS; AND
  (III)  INCORPORATE HABITAT ENHANCEMENT AND NATURAL ELEMENTS, INCLUDING
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO NATIVE RE-VEGETATION OR ESTABLISHMENT  OF  NEW  VEGE-
 TATION  CONSISTENT  WITH A NATURAL SHORELINE TYPICAL OF THE CURRENT SITE
 LOCATION EITHER:
  (A) UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS, OR
  (B) AS ADJUSTED FOR SCIENCE-BASED STATE  SEA-LEVEL  RISE  PROJECTIONS,
 UTILIZING  THE APPROPRIATE PROJECTION SCENARIO AT A TIME INTERVAL APPRO-
 PRIATE FOR THE ANTICIPATED LIFESPAN OF THE PROJECT  BUT  NOT  LESS  THAN
 TWENTY  YEARS  AFTER  THE  ANTICIPATED  PROJECT  COMPLETION, PURSUANT TO
 SECTION 3-0319 OF THIS TITLE FOR SUCH LOCATION.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
