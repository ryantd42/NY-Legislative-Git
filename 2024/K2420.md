  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our valiant firefighters who  exhibit  courage  and  bravery
every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighters  exemplify  the power of human compassion and
the strength of the American spirit through actions of the  most  heroic
magnitude;  their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and

of his purposeful life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chief Russell E. Brooks II heroically performed, above and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
fire protection for 43 years as a member of the Utica  Fire  Department;

  WHEREAS,  This  extraordinary  man  dedicated  his  career  to  the

Chief Russell E.  Brooks II guided the department through innovation and
modernization; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Russell  E.  Brooks  was  an  assistant  fire chief at the
department in 2001 when he and 11 other Utica firefighters  were  called
to  New  York  City  on  September  11th  to  provide  a  special camera
manufactured in Utica for searching the rubble; a few  years  later,  he
developed  a  form  of  cancer,  chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which was
certified as a World Trade Center-related condition by the federal World
Trade Center Health Program; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chief Russell  E.  Brooks'  legacy  will  live  on  in  the
namesake dedication of the Central Fire Station on Bleecker Street; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  steadfast  and  unwavering  commitment  to  his
community, Russell E. Brooks was also a  major  contributor  to  several
charities  including  his  service as the head of the Utica Food Pantry,
and his tireless efforts to help establish  the  Irish  Cultural  Center
which opened in the Brewery District in 2019; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chief Russell E. Brooks II is survived by his beloved wife,
Marianne,  and  one  son, as well as a legion of fellow firefighters and
friends who will long cherish his memory; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout his meritorious life, Chief Russell E. Brooks II
touched many through his kindness and commitment to service, and, as  we
recall  the  loss  of this great man, we memorialize his remarkable life
 
and the enormous impact he had on everyone with whom he came in contact;

benevolence will shine on through his family's vivid and happy memories;
his insight and strength will forever serve as a beacon of  love,  light
and hope to the countless lives he touched; he will be deeply missed and
truly  merits  the  grateful  tribute  of  this  Legislative  Body; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
pay  tribute  to the life and valiant service of Chief Russell E. Brooks
II, and to express its deepest condolences to  his  family;  and  be  it
further
