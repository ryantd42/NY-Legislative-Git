  substantially equivalent education by nonpublic schools
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 2 of section 3204  of  the  education  law,  as
 amended  by  section 1 of part SSS of chapter 59 of the laws of 2018, is
 amended to read as follows:
  2. Quality and language of instruction;  text-books.  (i)  Instruction
 may  be  given  only  by  a  competent  teacher.  In the teaching of the
 subjects of instruction prescribed by this section, English shall be the
 language of  instruction,  and  text-books  used  shall  be  written  in
 English,  except  that  for a period of three years, which period may be
 extended by the commissioner with respect  to  individual  pupils,  upon
 application  therefor by the appropriate school authorities, to a period
 not in excess of six years, from  the  date  of  enrollment  in  school,
 pupils  who, by reason of foreign birth or ancestry have limited English
 proficiency, shall be provided with instructional programs as  specified
 in  subdivision two-a of this section and the regulations of the commis-
 sioner. The purpose of providing such pupils with instruction  shall  be
 to enable them to develop academically while achieving competence in the
 English  language.  Instruction  given  to  a  minor elsewhere than at a
 public school shall be at least substantially equivalent to the instruc-
 tion given to minors of like age and attainments at the  public  schools
 of the city or district where the minor resides.
  (ii) For purposes of [considering] DETERMINING substantial equivalence
 pursuant to this subdivision for nonpublic elementary and middle schools
 [that  are:  (1) non-profit corporations, (2) have a bi-lingual program,
 and (3) have an educational program that extends from no later than nine
 a.m. until no earlier than four p.m. for grades one through  three,  and

 economics in the actions of world civilizations, and an understanding of
 civics  and  the  responsibilities of citizens in world communities; and
 instruction in science by learning how to gather, analyze and  interpret
