  WHEREAS,  Western  New  York  Educational  Services  Council  is  a
nonprofit organization that supports  school  districts  throughout  the
region;  the  purpose  of  the  Awards of Excellence program is to honor
school staff and leaders who make a  difference  for  students,  have  a
track  record  of  amazing  leadership, go above and beyond in their job
duties, and demonstrate excellent  personal  characteristics  that  make
