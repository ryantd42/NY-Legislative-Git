  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June  2-8,  2024,  as  Hidradenitis  Suppurativa
  Awareness Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  2-8,  2024,  as
Hidradenitis  Suppurativa  Awareness  Week  in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance  of  National  Hidradenitis  Suppurativa
Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Recognized annually in the first week of June, Hidradenitis
Suppurativa (HS) Awareness Week supports groups, charities, foundations,
and  other  organizations  which  provide resources, such as educational
materials, seminars, meetups, and more, with the aim to  connect  people
around  the  country  who  live  with  HS,  share  information about HS,
advocate for HS research, and increase public awareness of HS; and
 
  WHEREAS, An estimated 20,000 New Yorkers and 3.3  million  Americans
suffer from Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS), an immune disease that causes
recurring boils in the folds of the skin; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year many people are newly diagnosed with Hidradenitis
Suppurativa, affecting both those in early adulthood as well as those in
their 40s and 50s; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hidradenitis  Suppurativa  is  at  least  three times more
likely to occur in women, and is more prevalent  among  African-American
and biracial people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Health  professionals are often unaware of the symptoms of
Hidradenitis Suppurativa, causing people with  Hidradenitis  Suppurativa
to  suffer  for  an  average  of  9  years  before they obtain a correct
diagnosis and medical  treatment,  confirming  the  need  for  increased
public and professional awareness of Hidradenitis Suppurativa; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  awareness  week  will  foster  a  greater  sense  of
community among individuals living  with  Hidradenitis  Suppurative  and
help build public awareness of this disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Hidradenitis  Suppurativa  Coalition  is dedicated to
transforming the HS landscape and promoting initiatives that improve the
lives of individuals living with HS  by  driving  awareness,  addressing
disparities  in access and policy barriers, and creating better outcomes
for all impacted by HS; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  recognizes  the  needs  of  those
chronically  ill people who are living with Hidradenitis Suppurativa and
urges all citizens to support the search for a  cure  and  assist  those
 
individuals  and  families  who  deal with this grave disease on a daily
basis; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  2-8,  2024,  as
Hidradenitis Suppurativa Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
