 GOOD CAUSE FOR REMOVAL OR EVICTION:
  (A) THE TENANT HAS FAILED TO PAY RENT DUE AND OWING, PROVIDED  HOWEVER

 RENT INCREASE WHICH IS  UNREASONABLE  OR  IMPOSED  FOR  THE  PURPOSE  OF
 CIRCUMVENTING  THE INTENT OF THIS ARTICLE. IN DETERMINING WHETHER ALL OR
 PART OF THE RENT DUE AND OWING IS THE RESULT  OF  AN  UNREASONABLE  RENT
 INCREASE,  IT  SHALL  BE  A  REBUTTABLE  PRESUMPTION THAT THE RENT FOR A
 DWELLING NOT PROTECTED BY RENT REGULATION IS UNREASONABLE IF  SAID  RENT
 HAS BEEN INCREASED IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR BY A PERCENTAGE EXCEEDING EITHER
 THREE  PERCENT OR ONE AND ONE-HALF TIMES THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN
 A. 4454  3
 
 THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR THE REGION IN WHICH  THE  HOUSING  ACCOMMO-
 DATION IS LOCATED, AS ESTABLISHED THE AUGUST PRECEDING THE CALENDAR YEAR
 IN QUESTION, WHICHEVER IS GREATER;
  (B)  THE  TENANT  IS  VIOLATING A SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION OF HIS OR HER
 TENANCY, OTHER THAN THE OBLIGATION  TO  SURRENDER  POSSESSION,  AND  HAS
 FAILED  TO  CURE  SUCH VIOLATION AFTER WRITTEN NOTICE THAT THE VIOLATION
 CEASE WITHIN TEN DAYS OF RECEIPT OF SUCH WRITTEN NOTICE, PROVIDED HOWEV-
 ER, THAT THE OBLIGATION OF TENANCY FOR WHICH VIOLATION  IS  CLAIMED  WAS
 NOT IMPOSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CIRCUMVENTING THE INTENT OF THIS ARTICLE;
  (C)  THE TENANT IS COMMITTING OR PERMITTING A NUISANCE IN SUCH HOUSING
 ACCOMMODATION, OR IS MALICIOUSLY OR BY REASON OF NEGLIGENCE DAMAGING THE
 HOUSING ACCOMMODATION; OR THE TENANT'S CONDUCT IS SUCH AS  TO  INTERFERE
 WITH  THE  COMFORT  OF THE LANDLORD OR OTHER TENANTS OR OCCUPANTS OF THE
 SAME OR ADJACENT BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES;
  (D) OCCUPANCY OF  THE  HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION  BY  THE  TENANT  IS  IN
 VIOLATION OF OR CAUSES A VIOLATION OF LAW AND THE LANDLORD IS SUBJECT TO
 CIVIL  OR  CRIMINAL PENALTIES THEREFORE; PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT AN AGENCY
 OF THE STATE OR MUNICIPALITY HAVING JURISDICTION  HAS  ISSUED  AN  ORDER
 REQUIRING  THE  TENANT  TO  VACATE  THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION. NO TENANT
 SHALL BE REMOVED FROM POSSESSION OF  A  HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION  ON  SUCH
 GROUND  UNLESS  THE  COURT  FINDS  THAT THE CURE OF THE VIOLATION OF LAW
 REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF THE TENANT AND THAT THE LANDLORD DID NOT THROUGH
 NEGLECT OR DELIBERATE ACTION OR FAILURE  TO  ACT  CREATE  THE  CONDITION
 NECESSITATING THE VACATE ORDER. IN INSTANCES WHERE THE LANDLORD DOES NOT
 UNDERTAKE  TO  CURE CONDITIONS OF THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION CAUSING SUCH
 VIOLATION OF THE LAW, THE TENANT SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PAY  OR  SECURE
 PAYMENT  IN  A  MANNER SATISFACTORY TO THE COURT, TO CURE SUCH VIOLATION
 PROVIDED THAT ANY TENANT EXPENDITURES SHALL BE APPLIED AGAINST  RENT  TO
 WHICH  THE  LANDLORD IS ENTITLED. IN INSTANCES WHERE REMOVAL OF A TENANT
 IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO HIS OR HER HEALTH AND SAFETY, THE REMOVAL  OF
 THE TENANT SHALL BE WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ANY LEASEHOLD INTEREST OR OTHER
 RIGHT  OF OCCUPANCY THE TENANT MAY HAVE AND THE TENANT SHALL BE ENTITLED
 TO RESUME POSSESSION AT SUCH TIME AS THE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS HAVE  BEEN
 REMOVED. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL ABROGATE OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THE RIGHT OF A
 TENANT  TO  BRING AN ACTION FOR MONETARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE LANDLORD TO
 COMPEL COMPLIANCE BY THE LANDLORD WITH ALL APPLICABLE STATE OR MUNICIPAL
 LAWS OR HOUSING CODES;
  (E) THE TENANT IS USING OR PERMITTING THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION TO  BE
 USED FOR AN ILLEGAL PURPOSE;
  (F)  THE  TENANT  HAS  UNREASONABLY REFUSED THE LANDLORD ACCESS TO THE
 HOUSING ACCOMMODATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF  MAKING  NECESSARY  REPAIRS  OR
 IMPROVEMENTS  REQUIRED  BY LAW OR FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING THE HOUSING
 ACCOMMODATION TO A PROSPECTIVE  PURCHASER,  MORTGAGEE  OR  OTHER  PERSON
 HAVING A LEGITIMATE INTEREST THEREIN;
  (G)  THE LANDLORD SEEKS IN GOOD FAITH TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF A HOUS-
 ING ACCOMMODATION LOCATED IN A BUILDING  CONTAINING  FEWER  THAN  TWELVE
 UNITS  BECAUSE  OF IMMEDIATE AND COMPELLING NECESSITY FOR HIS OR HER OWN
 PERSONAL USE AND OCCUPANCY AS HIS OR HER  PRINCIPAL  RESIDENCE,  OR  THE
 PERSONAL  USE AND OCCUPANCY AS PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE OF HIS OR HER SPOUSE,
 PARENT, CHILD, STEPCHILD, FATHER-IN-LAW OR MOTHER-IN-LAW, WHEN NO  OTHER
 SUITABLE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION IN SUCH BUILDING IS AVAILABLE. THIS PARA-
 GRAPH  SHALL PERMIT RECOVERY OF ONLY ONE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION AND SHALL
 NOT APPLY TO A HOUSING ACCOMMODATION OCCUPIED BY A TENANT WHO IS  SIXTY-
 TWO YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER OR WHO IS A DISABLED PERSON;
  (H)  THE  LANDLORD SEEKS IN GOOD FAITH TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF ANY OR
 ALL HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS LOCATED IN A BUILDING  WITH  LESS  THAN  FIVE
 A. 4454  4
 
 UNITS  TO  PERSONALLY  OCCUPY  SUCH HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS AS HIS OR HER
 PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE.
  2. A TENANT REQUIRED TO SURRENDER A HOUSING ACCOMMODATION BY VIRTUE OF
 THE OPERATION OF PARAGRAPH (G) OR (H) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL  HAVE A CAUSE OF ACTION IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION FOR
 DAMAGES, DECLARATORY,  AND  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF  AGAINST  A  LANDLORD  OR
 PURCHASER  OF  THE PREMISES WHO MAKES A FRAUDULENT STATEMENT REGARDING A
 PROPOSED USE OF THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION. IN ANY ACTION  OR  PROCEEDING
 BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THIS PROVISION A PREVAILING TENANT SHALL BE ENTITLED
 TO RECOVERY OF ACTUAL DAMAGES, AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES.
  3.  NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL ABROGATE OR LIMIT THE TENANT'S RIGHT
 PURSUANT TO SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE OF THE REAL PROPERTY ACTIONS
 AND PROCEEDINGS LAW TO PERMANENTLY STAY THE ISSUANCE OR EXECUTION  OF  A
 WARRANT  OR EVICTION IN A SUMMARY PROCEEDING, WHETHER CHARACTERIZED AS A
 NONPAYMENT, OBJECTIONABLE TENANCY, OR HOLDOVER PROCEEDING, THE  UNDERLY-
 ING  BASIS  OF  WHICH  IS  THE NONPAYMENT OF RENT, SO LONG AS THE TENANT
 COMPLIES WITH THE  PROCEDURAL  REQUIREMENTS  OF  SECTION  SEVEN  HUNDRED
 FIFTY-ONE OF THE REAL PROPERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS LAW.
  §  215.  PRESERVATION OF EXISTING REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. NO ACTION SHALL
 BE MAINTAINABLE AND NO JUDGMENT OF POSSESSION SHALL BE ENTERED FOR HOUS-
 ING ACCOMMODATIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION  TWO  HUNDRED  FOURTEEN  OF  THIS
 ARTICLE,  UNLESS  THE  LANDLORD HAS COMPLIED WITH ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE
 LAWS GOVERNING SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING AND HAS COMPLIED WITH  ANY  AND
 ALL APPLICABLE LAWS GOVERNING NOTICE TO TENANTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMI-
 TATION  THE  MANNER  AND  THE  TIME  OF  SERVICE  OF SUCH NOTICE AND THE
 CONTENTS OF SUCH NOTICE.
