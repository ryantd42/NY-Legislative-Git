  1. The serious public emergency regarding hospital closures across New
 York  state continues to exist, and this emergency puts individuals at a

 impact both public and private general hospitals or  healthcare  facili-
 ties owned by one or more hospital networks, full-service hospitals, and
 critical care units.

 hardship, and other negative health outcomes to  New  York  state  resi-
 dents,  the  provisions  of  this  act  are  necessary to protect public

 designed  to  strengthen  the already established department of health's
 ongoing reporting efforts and ensure that  the  findings  are  presented
 clearly  and  are  accessible to the general public and the legislature.
 The necessity in the public interest is hereby declared as a  matter  of
 legislative determination.
  §  2. 1. The department of health shall produce a report that examines
 the aggregate impact of the closure of general  hospitals  and  hospital
 networks  on  healthcare access in this state.  In producing such report
 the  department  of  health  shall  meaningfully  engage  public  health
 experts,  labor  representatives  of  the  hospital workforce, community
 leaders and residents of New York state.
