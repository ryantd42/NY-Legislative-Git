  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 10-16, 2024, as Infant Mental Health  Awareness
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and observe the importance  of
the mental health of residents across New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant to such concern, this Legislative Body is justly
proud to memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 10-16, 2024,
as Infant Mental Health Awareness Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Infant mental health reflects the crucial first five  years
of  a  child's life in which they grow mentally, through observations of
their emotional capacity, as well as in their primary relationships; and
 
  WHEREAS, Infant mental health is dependent on the love and care that
a  child  receives  because  the  overall  quality  of  the  primary
relationships  in  an  infant's life dictate their choices and potential
future experiences and opportunities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Loving and nurturing relationships offer a child a sense of
emotional security; this emotional security allows a child  the  courage
to explore the world and succeed far more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  the  initial  five  years  of  a  child's life the
foundation for proper social and emotional development are conceived and
a  child's  understanding  of  self-worth  and  self-confidence  are
constructed;  these necessary emotional developmental traits are crucial
to success in school and life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Without the proper care and affection during these  initial
five  years,  a  child  can  become  depressed,  restless,  and
attention-starved, leading  them  to  seek  out  solace  from  dangerous
situations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the practice of this Legislative Body to recognize
those vital days which remind us of the  importance  of  establishing  a
foundation of mental health for all adults; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  June  10-16,  2024,  as
Infant  Mental Health Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
