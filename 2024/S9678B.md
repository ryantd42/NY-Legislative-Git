 tive shall be required to disclose this use.

 THE MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE MEDIA; [or]
  (3)  A  RADIO  OR  TELEVISION  BROADCASTING STATION, INCLUDING A CABLE

 tive media in violation of this subdivision may  seek  reasonable  court
 costs and attorneys' fees and injunctive relief prohibiting the distrib-
 ution,  publication or broadcasting of any materially deceptive media in
 violation of this subdivision against  such  individual  or  entity  who
 disseminated  or  published such media without the consent of the person
 depicted and who knew or should have known that it was materially decep-
 tive. An action under this paragraph shall be  initiated  by  filing  an
 application  for  an  order to show cause in the supreme court where the

 calendar  preference  and  be  subject  to  expedited pretrial and trial
 proceedings.
  (v) In any action alleging a violation of this subdivision in which  a
 plaintiff seeks preliminary relief with respect to an upcoming election,

  (B)  it  is  possible  to  implement  an appropriate remedy that would
 resolve the alleged violation in the upcoming election.
  (vi) In any action commenced under  this  subdivision,  the  plaintiff
 bears  the  burden of establishing the use of materially deceptive media
