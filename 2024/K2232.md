  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 2024, as Indian American  Heritage  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to  those  who
foster  ethnic pride and enhance the profile of cultural diversity which
strengthens the fabric of the communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, The citizens of  this  great  Empire  State  are  proud  to
recognize  and commemorate Indian American Heritage Month, an observance
which celebrates the contributions  of  Indian  Americans  to  New  York
State's unique heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  August  2024,  as  Indian  American
Heritage Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Immigration and Nationality Act, abolished the national
origins  quota  system,  which was American immigration policy since the
1920s,  replacing  it  with  a  preference  system  which  focused  on
immigrants'  skills  and  family  relationships  with citizens or United
States residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, This 1965 Act marked a radical break from  the  immigration
policies  of  the past and significantly increased Indian immigration to
the United States from fewer than 15,000 prior to the Act, to more  than
200,000 by 1980; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  immigration from India is currently at its highest
level in history; there are approximately four million Indian  Americans
residing  in  the United States with a growth rate of nearly 70 percent;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Indian Americans  greatly  contribute  to  the  leadership,
wisdom and vitality of our great State and Nation, and have attained one
of  the  highest  educational  levels of all ethnic groups in the United
States; an astounding 72 percent have a bachelor's  degree  compared  to
the 28 percent national average; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our Nation is blessed with many citizens of Indian descent
who are distinguished by their excellence and their contributions to all
fields of endeavor; some of these esteemed residents include: 2014  Miss
America  and  2013  Miss New York, Nina Davuluri; Comedian, Aziz Ansari;
Musician, Norah Jones;  former  Governor  of  Louisiana,  Bobby  Jindal;
Microsoft  CEO,  Satya  Nadella;  former United States Ambassador to the
United Nations, Nikki Haley; the first Indian-American elected as United
States Vice-President, Kamala Harris; the first Indian-American  elected
to Congress, Dalip Singh Saund; the first Indian-American elected to the
New  York State Senate, Kevin Thomas; the first Indian-Americans elected
to the New York State Assembly, Jenifer Rajkumar and Zohran Mamdani; and
the first Indian-American woman elected to be a county legislator in the
State of New York, Rockland County Legislator Aney Paul; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  there  are  nearly  35,000  Indian  American
doctors practicing in the United States including Doctor  Sanjay  Gupta,
renowned  Neurosurgeon  and Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery at Emory
University School of Medicine and Associate  Chief  of  Neurosurgery  at
Grady Memorial Hospital; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the practice of this Legislative Body to recognize
those important months which remind us of the rich and diverse  heritage
of our great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  duly  fitting  that  all New Yorkers join in these
important celebrations of one of our State's most  vibrant  communities;
this  much  anticipated  observance and its accompanying activities will
foster greater appreciation for Indian culture and serve to promote  the
spirit of cooperation that is characteristic of all citizens of New York
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  August  2024,  as  Indian
American Heritage Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
