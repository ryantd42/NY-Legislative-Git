 er, no executive order, in the case of  the  city  of  New  York  issued
 pursuant  to this section, shall in any manner supersede any local char-
 ter.  A copy of any such resolution or executive order in  the  case  of
 the  city  of  New  York establishing a commencement date shall be filed
 with the appropriate retirement system or systems, and,  if  applicable,
 on  forms  provided by such system. The resolution or executive order in
 the case of the city of New York shall be accompanied by  the  affidavit
 of  the  chief executive officer or other comparable official certifying
 the commencement date.
  (b) A state employer, participating employer which is not empowered to
 act by local law which elects to participate pursuant to section four of

 act, or the city of New York if it elects  to  participate  pursuant  to
 section  four of this act fails to establish a commencement date for the
 retirement  benefit  established  under  section  six  of  this act, the
 commencement date for the eligible employees of a state  employer  shall
 be  July  15,  2023. The commencement date for the eligible employees of
 all other employers referenced in this subdivision shall be September 1,
 2023.
  § 4. On or before September 1, 2023, a  participating  employer  or  a
 state  employer  described in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of subdivision
 (b) of section two of this act may elect to provide  its  employees  the
 retirement incentive authorized by this act by:
  (a) the enactment of a local law; or
  (b)  in the case of a participating employer which is not so empowered
 to act by local law or a state employer described in paragraphs 2, 3, 4,
 5 and 6 of subdivision (b) of section two of this act, by  the  adoption
 of a resolution of its governing body, provided however, no local law or
 resolution  enacted  pursuant to this section shall in any manner super-
 sede any local  charter,  provided  further,  that  for  an  educational
 employer  such  election  shall  be made thirty days after the effective
 date of this act.  For a community college operating under  the  program
 of  state  university  of  New  York, such election shall be made by the
 board of trustees of such community college subject to the  approval  of
 its  sponsor.  A  copy of such law or resolution shall be filed with the
 appropriate retirement system or systems, and, if applicable,  on  forms
 provided  by  such system. The local law or resolution shall be accompa-
 nied by the affidavit of the chief executive officer or other comparable
 official certifying the validity of such local law  or  resolution.  The
 executive  branch  of the state shall be deemed to have made an election
 under this section upon its enactment.
  § 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any eligible employee
 who has been continuously in the active service of a state  employer  or
 of a participating employer from February 1, 2023 to the date immediate-
 ly  prior  to the commencement date of the applicable open period, files
 an application for service retirement that is effective during the  open
 period,  and  is  eligible for a service retirement pursuant to this act
 because he or she has attained the age of fifty and has at  least  twen-
 ty-five  years  of  creditable service or has attained the age of fifty-
 five and has at least ten years of creditable service, as of the  effec-
 tive  date  of  the  application for retirement shall be entitled to the
 retirement benefit provided in section six of this act.
  § 6. (a) Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  law,  an  eligible
 employee who is a member of a retirement system and who is entitled to a
 retirement  benefit  pursuant  to  section  five  of this act may retire
 during the open period without the reduction of his  or  her  retirement
 benefit  that  would  otherwise  be  imposed  by article 11 or 15 of the
 retirement and social security law if he or she has attained the age  of
 fifty and has completed at least twenty-five years of creditable service
 or  has  attained  the  age of fifty-five and has completed at least ten
 years of creditable service. An eligible employee who is covered by  the
 provisions  of  articles 11 and 15 of the retirement and social security
 law shall retire under the provisions of  articles  11  and  15  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
  (b)  The  director of state operations, the chief executive officer of
 the city of New York, or chief executive officer or governing board,  as
 appropriate, of the participating employer may deny participation in the
 S. 5529  6
 
 retirement  benefit  provided  by subdivision (a) of this section if the
 director of state operations, the chief executive officer  of  New  York
 city  or  the  chief executive officer or governing board of the partic-
 ipating  employer  makes a determination that the employee holds a posi-
 tion that is deemed critical to the maintenance  of  public  health  and
 safety.
  (c)  The  action of the director of state operations, the chief execu-
 tive officer of the city of New York,  or  chief  executive  officer  or
 governing  board, as appropriate, of the participating employer in deny-
 ing the retirement benefit provided  for  in  subdivision  (a)  of  this
 section  to  any  individual  shall  be  subject to review in the manner
 provided for in article 78 of the civil practice  law  and  rules.  Such
 action  for  review pursuant to article 78 of the civil practice law and
 rules shall only be commenced by the  individual  that  was  denied  the
 retirement benefit provided by subdivision (a) of this section.
  (d)  After making any such determination under subdivision (b) of this
 section, the director of state operations, the chief  executive  officer
 of  the  city  of  New York and the chief executive officer or governing
 board, as appropriate, of the participating employer  shall  notify  the
 appropriate  retirement  system  or  teachers'  retirement system of its
 determination.
  § 7. The pension benefit costs of section six of  this  act  shall  be
 paid  by  employers  as  provided  by applicable law for each retirement
 system covered by this act over  a  period  not  to  exceed  five  years
 commencing in the state fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.
  § 8. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair,  or  invalidate  the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in
 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 9. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow retirement at age 50 for certain members of  the
 New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS) who have
 accrued at least 25 years of creditable service. It would also eliminate
 the early retirement reductions for members who have attained age 55 and
 have accrued at least 10 years of creditable service.
  Insofar  as  this  bill  affects  the NYSLERS, if this bill is enacted
 during the 2023 legislative session, the additional cost for each member
 who receives these benefits will vary depending  on  the  member's  age,
 years  of service, plans and final average salary. Eliminating the early
 age reductions for members retiring after attaining age 55 with at least
 10 years of service credit is estimated to  cost  (on  average  for  the
 group)  180%  of the member's final average salary. Extending retirement
 eligibility to members who have attained age 50 with at least  25  years
 of  service  credit is estimated to cost (on average for the group) 180%
 of the member's final average salary. The final costs will be  borne  by
 each employer electing the incentive.
  The  exact number of members who would be affected by this legislation
 cannot be readily determined.
