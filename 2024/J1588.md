  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 21-27, 2024, as Certified  Registered  Nurse
  Anesthetist Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to inform key audiences about the role
and value of  Certified  Registered  Nurse  Anesthetists  in  delivering
anesthesia  care  in  today's  and  tomorrow's  United States healthcare
system; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January  21-27,  2024,  as
Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist Week in the State of New York, in
conjunction  with  the observance of National Certified Registered Nurse
Anesthetist Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Certified  Registered  Nurse  Anesthetists  (CRNAs)  are
essential  to  America's  healthcare  system;  these  dedicated  health
professionals  have  been  providing  high-quality,  cost-effective
anesthesia  care  for  more than 150 years, and have safely administered
approximately 43 million anesthetics to patients each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nurse Anesthetists were the  first  professional  group  to
provide  anesthesia  in the United States, and are the oldest recognized
group of advanced practice registered nurse specialists; and
 
  WHEREAS, These registered nurses  have  completed  a  graduate-level
educational  program  in  a  nationally  accredited  program  of  nurse
anesthesia, and, after  graduation,  they  are  qualified  to  take  the
national certifying examination; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nurses first provided anesthesia to wounded soldiers during
the  Civil War; since World War I, nurse anesthetists have been the main
provider of anesthesia care to United States military personnel  on  the
front lines; today, these remarkable men and women serve our soldiers in
conflicts throughout the Middle East; and
 
  WHEREAS, CRNAs are the primary providers of anesthesia care in rural
America,  enabling  healthcare facilities in these medically underserved
areas to offer obstetrical, surgical, and trauma stabilization services;
in some states, CRNAs are the sole providers in nearly 100% of the rural
hospitals; and
 
  WHEREAS, CRNAs practice in every  setting  in  which  anesthesia  is
delivered including traditional hospital surgical suites and obstetrical
delivery  rooms; the offices of dentists, podiatrists, ophthalmologists,
and plastic surgeons; ambulatory surgical  centers;  and  United  States
Military  and Public Health Services and Veterans Administration medical
facilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each day, New Yorkers benefit from the caring  and  skilled
attention  of  these individuals, and it is appropriate to recognize the
 
innumerable contributions of CRNAs by  designating  a  special  week  in
their honor; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize these
exceptional  healthcare professionals for their outstanding contribution
in adding to  the  quality  of  life  in  our  State  and  Nation;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January  21-27,  2024,  as
Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist Week in the State of New York, in
recognition  of  our  appreciation  of  CRNAs,  and  to  celebrate their
dedication and professionalism; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and Board Members of the  New  York  State  Association  of  Nurse
Anesthetists.
