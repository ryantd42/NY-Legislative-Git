  CONGRATULATING  Naomi  Browne upon the occasion of
  earning  the  distinguished  Gold  Award,  the  most
  prestigious of Scouting honors on June 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Naomi  Browne, through her diligence and rigorous efforts,
has achieved Scouting's highest and most  prestigious  honor,  the  Gold
Award; the ceremony will be held on Friday, June 14, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A resident of Brooklyn, New York, Naomi Browne is a member
of Girl Scouts of the United States of America, Troop 2811  at  PS  276;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  America has achieved her greatest heights of glory through
the dedication, determination, and tireless efforts of  the  outstanding
citizens of this Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is only with the continued diligence and devotion of our
youth, tomorrow's leaders, that America will maintain her glory; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Girl  Scouts  of the United States of America and its
members are dedicated to the development of character and leadership  in
the youth of this Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  1916,  Senior  Girl Scouts have sought to cap their
years in Girl Scouting with the  prized  Gold  Award,  which  challenges
girls to change the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  order  to  earn the Gold Award, a girl must complete a
rigorous set of  service,  leadership  development,  and  skill-building
tasks  leading  up  to  the  final and most challenging requirement, the
design and completion of a Take Action Project; this project must be  an
issue  of  interest  to  the  girl  and her community, employ team-based
solutions, and educate and inspire others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Naomi Browne's  project  involved  the  construction  of  a
little library located outside the Sylk Cove lounge on Rockaway Parkway;
in  collaboration  with the Canarsie Merchants Association, this library
was stocked with books  for  the  community,  promoting  literacy  among
people of all ages; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Thanks  to generous donations from the public, the library
sees over 25 books borrowed each week; it operates on the  principle  of
"take a book, leave a book," fostering a culture of sharing and learning
within our community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This outstanding young woman has been involved in Scouting
for years, has lived up to Scouting's ideals, and has  attained  all  of
the necessary achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS, Naomi Browne has been a member of Girl Scouts for 13 years,
beginning  her  involvement  as  a Kindergarten Daisy member; she is now
graduating high school as a senior, reflecting fondly and proudly on all
her incredible accomplishments and experiences; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Naomi  Browne  is  a credit to her family, her school, her
community, her State, and her Nation, and no doubt her  future  will  be
filled with accomplishments of equal importance; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations, in
recognition of the significance  of  this  meritorious  achievement,  to
congratulate  and  honor  Naomi  Browne upon the occasion of earning the
Gold Award on June 14, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Naomi Browne.
