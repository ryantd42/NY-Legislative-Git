 PERMIT  IS  DENIED,  THE  DEPARTMENT SHALL IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE SPECIFIC
 REASONING AND BASIS FOR THE DENIAL. With respect  to  driveway  entrance
 permits,  the  regulations shall take into consideration the prospective
 character of the development, the traffic which will be generated by the
 facility  within  the  reasonably  foreseeable  future,  the  design and
 frequency of access to the facility, the effect  of  the  facility  upon
 drainage  as  related  to existing drainage systems, the extent to which
 such facility may impair the safety and traffic carrying capacity of the
 existing state highway and any proposed improvement thereto  within  the
 reasonably  foreseeable future, and any standards governing access, non-
 access or limited access which have been established by  the  department
 of transportation.
  § 2. This act shall take effect ninety days after it shall have become
 a  law.  Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of
 any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation of this  act  on
 its  effective date are authorized to be made and completed on or before
 such effective date.
