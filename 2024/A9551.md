  Section 1. Subdivision a of section 1613 of the tax law, as amended by

  a. It shall be the duty of the director to  require  that  all  prizes
 over  five thousand dollars in any game be awarded to holders of winning
 tickets for that game as provided in this section  and  section  sixteen
 hundred  fourteen  of this article. Within one week after any drawing or
 selection of prize winning lottery tickets, the division  shall  deliver
 to  the  comptroller a certified list of the tickets to which prizes are
 awarded and the amount of each such prize. Upon receipt of  such  certi-
 fied list and voucher of the division, moneys sufficient for the payment
 of  such  prizes  shall  be  paid to the division from the lottery prize
 account, upon audit and warrant  of  the  comptroller.  Moneys  for  the
 payment of lottery prizes shall be deposited by the director as provided
 in  section sixteen hundred eleven of this article and the withdrawal of
 such moneys for the payment of prize winners shall be subject to a check
 signed by the director or such officers or employees of the division  as
 the  director  may  designate. The division shall each month provide the
 comptroller with a record of all such withdrawals  from  the  director's
 accounts.  Payment of prizes shall be made by the division to holders of
 the tickets to which prizes are awarded,  except  that  payment  of  any
 prize drawn may be paid to the estate of a deceased prize winner, may be
 paid  pursuant  to  a court order granted as a result of a proceeding as
 provided in subdivision d of this section, and except  that  any  person
 pursuant to an appropriate judicial order may be paid the prize to which
 the  winner  is entitled.  THE DIVISION SHALL NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THE
