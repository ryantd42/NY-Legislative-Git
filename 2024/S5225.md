 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to screening of  students
  for eating disorders
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section  903  of  the  education  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  183  of  the  laws  of 2017, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. A health certificate shall be furnished  by  each  student  in  the
 public  schools upon his or her entrance in such schools and upon his or
 her entry into the grades prescribed by the commissioner in regulations,
 provided that such regulations shall require such certificates at  least
 twice during the elementary grades and twice in the secondary grades. An
 examination and health history of any child may be required by the local
 school authorities at any time in their discretion to promote the educa-
 tional  interests  of  such child. Each certificate shall be signed by a
 duly licensed physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner, who
 is authorized by law to practice in  this  state,  and  consistent  with
 subdivision three of section six thousand nine hundred two of this chap-
 ter,  or  by  a  duly  licensed physician, physician assistant, or nurse
 practitioner, who is authorized to practice in the jurisdiction in which
 the examination was given, provided that the commissioner has determined
 that such jurisdiction has standards of licensure and practice  compara-
 ble  to  those  of  New  York.  Each such certificate shall describe the
 condition of the student when the examination was made, which shall  not
 be  more than twelve months prior to the commencement of the school year
 in which the examination is  required,  and  shall  state  whether  such
 student  is in a fit condition of health to permit his or her attendance
 at the public schools. The examination may include a diabetes risk anal-
 ysis. Each such certificate shall also state  the  student's  body  mass

 index  (BMI)  and  weight status category. For purposes of this section,
 BMI is computed as the weight in kilograms  divided  by  the  square  of
 height in meters or the weight in pounds divided by the square of height
 in  inches multiplied by a conversion factor of 703. Weight status cate-
 gories for children and adolescents shall be as defined by  the  commis-
 sioner  of health.  FURTHERMORE, EACH SUCH CERTIFICATE SHALL INCLUDE AN
 ASSESSMENT OF THE STUDENT FOR EATING DISORDERS. SUCH ASSESSMENT SHALL BE
 CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO  STANDARDS  ESTABLISHED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER  OF
 HEALTH.  In  all school districts such physician, physician assistant or
 nurse practitioner shall determine whether a one-time  test  for  sickle
 cell anemia is necessary or desirable and he or she shall conduct such a
 test and the certificate shall state the results.
  §  2. Subdivision 1 of section 904 of the education law, as amended by
 section 12 of part B of chapter 58 of the laws of 2007,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  1.  Each  principal  of a public school, or his or her designee, shall
 report to the director of school  health  services  having  jurisdiction
 over  such  school,  the  names  of  all students who have not furnished
 health certificates as provided in section nine hundred  three  of  this
 article,  or  who  are children with disabilities, as defined by article
 eighty-nine of this chapter, and the director of school health  services
 shall  cause  such  students to be separately and carefully examined and
 tested to ascertain whether any student has defective sight or  hearing,
 AN  EATING  DISORDER, or any other physical disability which may tend to
 prevent him or her from receiving the full benefit of  school  work,  or
 from  requiring  a  modification  of  such work to prevent injury to the
 student or from receiving the best educational results.  Each  examina-
 tion  shall  also include a calculation of the student's body mass index
 (BMI) and weight status category. For purposes of this section,  BMI  is
 computed  as  the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
 meters or the weight in pounds divided by the square of height in inches
 multiplied by a conversion factor of 703. Weight status  categories  for
 children  and  adolescents  shall  be  as defined by the commissioner of
 health. In all school districts, such physician, physician assistant  or
 nurse  practitioner  shall  determine whether a one-time test for sickle
 cell anemia is necessary or desirable and he or she shall  conduct  such
 tests  and  the  certificate  shall  state  the results. If it should be
 ascertained, upon such test or examination, that any  of  such  students
 have  defective  sight or hearing, AN EATING DISORDER, or other physical
 disability, including sickle cell anemia, as above described, the  prin-
 cipal  or  his  or  her  designee  shall notify the parents of, or other
 persons in parental relation to, the child as to the existence  of  such
 disability  OR  DISORDER.  If the parents or other persons in parental
 relation are unable or unwilling to provide  the  necessary  relief  and
 treatment  for such students, such fact shall be reported by the princi-
 pal or his or her designee to the director of  school  health  services,
 whose  duty it shall be to provide relief for such students. Each school
 and school district chosen as part of an appropriate sampling  methodol-
 ogy  shall participate in surveys directed by the commissioner of health
 pursuant to the public health law  in  relation  to  students'  BMI  and
 weight  status  categories  as  determined  by the examination conducted
 pursuant to this section and which shall be  subject  to  audit  by  the
 commissioner  of  health.  Such  surveys  shall  contain the information
 required pursuant to this subdivision in relation to students'  BMI  and
 weight  status  categories  in  aggregate.  Parents  or other persons in
 parental relation to a student may refuse to have the student's BMI  and

 weight  status  category included in such survey. Each school and school
 district shall provide the commissioner of health with any  information,
 records and reports he or she may require for the purpose of such audit.
 The  BMI and weight status survey and audit as described in this section
 shall be conducted consistent with confidentiality requirements  imposed
 by  federal  law.  Data  collection for such surveys shall commence on a
 voluntary basis at the beginning of  the  two  thousand  seven  academic
 school year, and by all schools chosen as part of the sampling methodol-
 ogy at the beginning of the two thousand eight academic school year. The
 department  shall also utilize the collected data to develop a report of
 child obesity and obesity related diseases.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the first of July  next  succeeding
 the  date  on  which it shall have become a law.  Effective immediately,
 the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or  regulation  neces-
 sary  for  the  implementation  of  this  act  on its effective date are
 authorized to be made and completed on or before such effective date.
