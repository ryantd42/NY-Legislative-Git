 Introduced by Sen. GOUNARDES -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Codes
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to prohibiting
  peremptory challenges of prospective  jurors  based  on  race,  color,
  national  origin,  ancestry,  gender,  gender  identity or expression,
  religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 1 of section 270.25 of the criminal procedure
 law is amended to read as follows:
  1. A peremptory challenge is an objection to a prospective  juror  for
 which  no reason need be assigned. Upon any LAWFUL peremptory challenge,
 the court must exclude the person challenged from service.
  § 2. Section 270.25 of the criminal procedure law is amended to add  a
 new subdivision 4 to read as follows:
  4.  (A)  A  PARTY  SHALL  NOT  USE  A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE TO REMOVE A
 PROSPECTIVE JUROR ON THE BASIS OF SUCH  JUROR'S  RACE,  COLOR,  NATIONAL
 ORIGIN, ANCESTRY, GENDER, GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION, RELIGION, RELI-
 GIOUS PRACTICE, AGE, DISABILITY, OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
  (B)  A  PARTY MAY OBJECT TO THE IMPROPER USE OF A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE
 IF SUCH PARTY BELIEVES THAT SUCH CHALLENGE WAS MADE ON AN UNLAWFUL BASIS
 IN VIOLATION OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION. AFTER SUCH  OBJECTION
 IS  MADE, ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION SHALL BE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE
 OF THE PANEL. THE OBJECTION SHALL BE MADE BEFORE THE JURY IS  IMPANELED,
 UNLESS  INFORMATION  BECOMES  KNOWN  THAT COULD NOT HAVE REASONABLY BEEN
 KNOWN BEFORE THE JURY WAS IMPANELED.
  (C) UPON THE OBJECTION MADE PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION, THE PARTY EXERCISING THE  PEREMPTORY  CHALLENGE  SHALL  STATE  THE
 REASONS FOR EXERCISING SUCH CHALLENGE TO THE COURT.
  (D)  THE COURT SHALL EVALUATE THE REASONS GIVEN TO JUSTIFY THE PEREMP-
 TORY CHALLENGE IN LIGHT OF THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE  COURT
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 SHALL  CONSIDER  ONLY THE REASONS ACTUALLY GIVEN AND SHALL NOT SPECULATE
 ON, OR ASSUME THE EXISTENCE OF, OTHER POSSIBLE  JUSTIFICATIONS  FOR  THE
 USE  OF  THE  PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. IF THE COURT DETERMINES THAT, IN THE
 VIEW OF A REASONABLE PERSON, THE RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, ANCESTRY,
 GENDER,  GENDER  IDENTITY  OR  EXPRESSION, RELIGION, RELIGIOUS PRACTICE,
 AGE, DISABILITY, OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF A JUROR WAS A  FACTOR  IN  THE
 EXERCISE  OF  THE  PEREMPTORY  CHALLENGE,  THEN  THE  OBJECTION SHALL BE
 SUSTAINED AND THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE SHALL BE DEFEATED. THE COURT NEED
 NOT FIND PURPOSEFUL DISCRIMINATION TO SUSTAIN SUCH OBJECTION. THE  COURT
 SHALL EXPLAIN THE REASONS FOR ITS RULING ON THE RECORD.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall  have  become  a  law  and  shall apply to all jury selections
 commenced on or after such date.
