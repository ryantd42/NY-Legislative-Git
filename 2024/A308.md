  Section  1.  The  real property law is amended by adding a new section

  § 228-A. TENANCY IN RENTAL BUILDINGS; SENIOR  CITIZENS;  PERSONS  WITH
 DISABILITIES.  1. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED
 TWENTY-EIGHT OF THIS ARTICLE OR ANY OTHER PROVISION TO THE CONTRARY,  IF
 SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL OF THE LESSEES OR TENANTS OCCUPYING UNITS IN A RENTAL
 BUILDING ARE OVER SIXTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND/OR ARE PERSONS WITH  DISA-
 BILITIES,  THE  LESSOR  MAY  NOT  TERMINATE OR FAIL TO RENEW A LEASE FOR
 PREMISES IN SUCH BUILDING OR TERMINATE A TENANCY AT WILL OR  AT  SUFFER-
 ANCE,  EXCEPT FOR CAUSE INVOLVING ACTIONS OF THE TENANT THAT VIOLATE THE
 TERMS OF THE LEASE, SUCH AS THE NON-PAYMENT OF RENT, WITHOUT  THE  PRIOR
 APPROVAL  OF  A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.  IN DETERMINING WHETHER
 TO GRANT APPROVAL, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER FACTORS INCLUDING:  WHETHER
 THE  LESSOR  IS  OPERATING  THE RENTAL BUILDING AT A PROFIT OR LOSS; THE
 NEED FOR ANY MAJOR  CAPITAL  REPAIRS  OR  IMPROVEMENTS  THAT  CANNOT  BE
 PERFORMED  WHILE  THE  TENANTS  ARE  IN  OCCUPANCY;  ANY WRITTEN OR ORAL
 REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE LESSOR TO TENANTS ABOUT HOW LONG THEY  COULD
 REMAIN  IN  OCCUPANCY;  ANY  ALTERNATIVE  HOUSING  BEING  OFFERED BY THE
 LESSOR, THE NUMBER OF AFFECTED TENANTS;  AND  THE  LENGTH  OF  TIME  THE
 AFFECTED  TENANTS  HAVE LIVED IN THEIR APARTMENTS. AT THE TIME OF FILING
 ANY ACTION AFFECTING MORE THAN ONE LEASE AND SEEKING SUCH PRIOR APPROVAL
 FROM A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, THE LESSOR SHALL NOTIFY ALL  THE
 LESSEES AND TENANTS OCCUPYING UNITS IN THE RENTAL BUILDING THAT ARE OVER
 SIXTY-FIVE  YEARS  OF  AGE  AND/OR  ARE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES OF THE
 FILING OF SUCH ACTION.  THE LESSOR SHALL ALSO NOTIFY AT  SUCH  TIME  ANY
 VILLAGE,  TOWN,  CITY AND COUNTY, EXCEPT COUNTIES INSIDE THE CITY OF NEW
 YORK, IN WHICH SUCH RENTAL BUILDING IS LOCATED OF  THE  FILING  OF  SUCH
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 ACTION.  WHILE  SUCH  ACTION  IS  PENDING,  THE  LESSOR SHALL NOTIFY ANY

 PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES MAY NOT  INCREASE  THE  RENT  IN  SUCH  RENTAL
 BUILDING  BY  MORE  THAN  ONE PERCENT ABOVE THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE
 CONSUMER PRICE INDEX SINCE THE START  OF  THE  TENANCY  OR  MOST  RECENT
 RENEWAL,  WHICHEVER IS MORE RECENT AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL OF A LEASE AND
 MAY NOT INCREASE THE RENT MORE THAN ONE TIME ANNUALLY.
  3. EVERY LESSOR OF RENTAL BUILDINGS WHERE  SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL  OF  THE
 LESSEES  OR  TENANTS  OCCUPYING  UNITS  ARE OVER SIXTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE

  4.  ANY  LESSOR  WHO  VIOLATES THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE

 COLLECTED AS A PART OF THE COSTS IN THE ACTION, AND FOR  THE  REASONABLE
