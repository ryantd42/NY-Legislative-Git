  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim

  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October  2024,  as  Filipino  American
History  Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with National
Filipino American History Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, October has been celebrated as  Filipino  American  History
Month since 1992, when the Filipino American National Historical Society
(FANHS) proposed to honor the month when the first Filipinos or "Luzones
Indios"  landed  on  the  shores of what is now Morro Bay, California on
October 18, 1587, on board the Manila-built galleon ship Nuestra  Senora
de Esperanza; and
 
  WHEREAS,  2024  marks  the  15th  anniversary  of  the United States
Congress passing the Resolution (H. Res 780) to  officially  commemorate
October as Filipino American History Month in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  recent  census  reports that there are nearly 150,000
residents of Filipino  heritage  living  in  New  York  State,  who  are
concentrated  mainly  in  areas  of  Queens  such  as  Woodside, Jackson
Heights, Elmhurst, Jamaica, Jamaica Estates, Hollis, and Queens Village;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The oldest record of Filipinos in New  York  was  in  1888,
when  physician  and  novelist Dr. Jose Rizal stayed at the former Fifth
Avenue Hotel, across the southeast corner  of  Madison  Square  Park  in
Manhattan;  he  would  later  become a political martyr and the official
National Hero of the Philippines; and
 
  WHEREAS, A wave of immigrants came from the Philippines to New  York
after  the  1920s,  many  as students, and most were either soldiers who
were assigned to military  bases,  such  as  Governor's  Island  or  the
Brooklyn  Navy  Yard,  or former agricultural workers who moved from the
Western United States in search of employment; and
 
  WHEREAS, After World War II, a smaller wave of immigrants came  from
the  Philippines,  later  followed by the largest wave of immigration in
the 1960s, after the Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  of  1965,  when
hospitals  began  recruiting Filipino doctors and nurses; later, nursing
became one of the most common professions amongst both Filipino men  and
women living in New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of New York is host to a vibrant community and
