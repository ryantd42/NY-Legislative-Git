  insurance  policies  to  include  coverage  of optional anesthesia for
  certain contraceptive and menstrual health procedures
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Clause  (v)  of  subparagraph  (E)  of  paragraph  17  of
 subsection (i) of section 3216 of  the  insurance  law,  as  amended  by
 section  3  of  part  M of chapter 57 of the laws of 2019, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (v) all FDA-approved MENSTRUAL  HEALTH  PROCEDURES  AND  contraceptive
 drugs,  devices,  and  other  products,  including  all over-the-counter
 contraceptive drugs, devices, and products as prescribed or as otherwise
 authorized under state or federal law;  voluntary  sterilization  proce-
 dures  pursuant  to  42 U.S.C. 18022 and identified in the comprehensive
 guidelines supported by the health resources and services administration
 and thereby incorporated in  the  essential  health  benefits  benchmark
 plan;  patient  education and counseling on contraception; and follow-up
 services related to the drugs, devices, products, and procedures covered
 under this clause, including, but not limited  to,  management  of  side
 effects,  counseling  for  continued adherence, and device insertion and
 removal. Except as otherwise authorized under this  clause,  a  contract
 shall  not  impose  any  restrictions or delays on the coverage required
 under this clause.  However, where the FDA has  approved  one  or  more
 therapeutic  and  pharmaceutical  equivalent,  as  defined  by  the FDA,
 versions of a contraceptive drug, device, or product, a contract is  not
 required  to  include all such therapeutic and pharmaceutical equivalent
 versions in its formulary, so long as  at  least  one  is  included  and
 covered  without cost-sharing and in accordance with this clause. If the
 covered therapeutic and pharmaceutical equivalent versions  of  a  drug,
 device, or product are not available or are deemed medically inadvisable
 a contract shall provide coverage for an alternate therapeutic and phar-
 maceutical  equivalent  version  of  the  contraceptive drug, device, or

 product without cost-sharing. (a) This coverage shall include  emergency
 contraception  without  cost  sharing  when  provided  pursuant  to  a
 prescription, or order under section sixty-eight hundred  thirty-one  of
 the education law or when lawfully provided over-the-counter. (b) If the
 attending  health  care  provider, in his or her reasonable professional
 judgment, determines that the use of a non-covered therapeutic or  phar-
 maceutical  equivalent  of  a drug, device, or product is warranted, the
 health care provider's determination shall be final. The  superintendent
 shall  promulgate  regulations  establishing  a process, including time-
 frames, for an insured, an insured's designee  or  an  insured's  health
 care  provider  to request coverage of a non-covered contraceptive drug,
 device, or product. Such regulations shall include  a  requirement  that
 insurers  use  an exception form that shall meet criteria established by
 the superintendent. (c) This coverage must allow for the  dispensing  of
 up  to  twelve  months  worth  of  a contraceptive at one time. (d) THIS
 COVERAGE SHALL INCLUDE OPTIONAL ANESTHESIA FOR  VAGINAL,  CERVICAL,  AND
 UTERINE MEDICAL PROCEDURES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOOP ELECTRO-
 SURGICAL  EXCISION  PROCEDURE,  COLPOSCOPY,  ABLATION,  AND INTRAUTERINE
 DEVICE INSERTION. (E) For the purposes of this clause, "over-the-counter
 contraceptive products"  shall  mean  those  products  provided  for  in
 comprehensive  guidelines supported by the health resources and services
 administration as of January twenty-first, two thousand nineteen.
  § 2. Subparagraph (A) of paragraph 16 of  subsection  (l)  of  section

 its  formulary,  so long as at least one is included and covered without
 cost-sharing and in accordance with this paragraph;
  (b) if the covered therapeutic and pharmaceutical equivalent  versions
 of  a drug, device, or product are not available or are deemed medically
 inadvisable a group or blanket policy  shall  provide  coverage  for  an
 alternate  therapeutic  and  pharmaceutical  equivalent  version  of the
 contraceptive drug, device, or  product  without  cost-sharing.  If  the
 attending  health  care  provider, in his or her reasonable professional
 judgment, determines that the use of a non-covered therapeutic or  phar-
 maceutical  equivalent  of  a drug, device, or product is warranted, the
 health care provider's determination shall be final. The  superintendent
 shall  promulgate  regulations  establishing  a process, including time-
 frames, for an insured, an insured's designee  or  an  insured's  health
