  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September  2024,  as  Peripheral  Arterial  Disease
  Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2024,  as
Peripheral Arterial Disease Awareness Month in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance of National Peripheral Arterial  Disease
Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Peripheral  Arterial  Disease  (PAD)  affects  10  million
people, yet it is under diagnosed and under treated; many people believe
pain in the legs or lower extremities is just another sign of aging, not
realizing that it may be a warning sign for this serious disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, PAD happens when arteries in the legs become restricted  or
clogged  with  fatty deposits, reducing blood flow to the legs resulting
in leg muscle pain when walking,  disability,  amputation,  and  a  poor
quality of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Blocked arteries found in people with PAD can signify other
arteries  may  also be blocked, increasing the risk of a heart attack or
stroke; and
 
  WHEREAS, People over the age of 50, experiencing leg pain  and  have
more  than  one  of  the  following mentioned risk factors, talk to your
doctor about PAD:  smoke  (current  or  former),  high  blood  pressure,
personal/family  history  of  heart  attack  or stroke, diabetes or high
cholesterol; and
 
  WHEREAS, PAD is more common in  African  Americans  than  any  other
racial  or  ethnic group in the United States; the conditions that raise
the risk for developing PAD include diabetes  and  high  blood  pressure
which are more common among African Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2024,  as
Peripheral  Arterial  Disease  Awareness Month in the State of New York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
