BY: Senator RAMOS
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  60th  Anniversary  of  Fania
  Records
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have enriched the lives of  the  citizens
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of Fania Records; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fania  Records is one of the most significant Latin record
labels in the world, both musically and culturally; in the  1960s,  this
legendary  label pioneered the creation and dissemination of salsa music
from New York City to the rest of the globe; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fania Records  is  the  home  for  numerous  music  genres,
including  Latin  big  band,  Afro-Cuban jazz, boogaloo, and Latin soul;
countless Latin music legends, such as Johnny Pacheco, Celia Cruz,  Tito
Puente,  Ray  Barretto,  and Cheo Feliciano, are included on the roster;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1964 by Dominican  bandleader,  Johnny  Pacheco,
and  his attorney, Jerry Masucci, Fania Records was conceived from their
mutual passion for Latin music; the unique sound of the record label was
a conglomeration of tropical music, big band jazz, and  American  rhythm
and  blues,  jazz,  funk,  and soul; a young generation of musicians was
afforded the opportunity to experiment with new musical formats; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1968, the international supergroup, known as  the  Fania
All-Stars,  was  responsible  for  "Fania  Sound" which is the signature
musical style of Fania Records; this label remains  a  cultural  beacon,
illuminating  a powerful American immigrant story that is just as timely
today as it was at its inception; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jerry  Masucci  bought  Johnny  Pacheco's  share  of  Fania
Records  in  1967;  after his death in 1997, the assets of Fania Records
were unattainable for many years; in 2005, the  label  was  sold  to  V2
Records  and  Emusica and sold again to Concord Records in 2018; at that
time, the assets included more than 1,000 album masters,  15,000  songs,
and 7,000 compositions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  the  past  six  decades,  Fania  Records  has
flourished  and  broadened  its  sound,  becoming  more  popular  with
increasing support from the community; three Fania recordings, including
"Live  at Yankee Stadium" by the Fania All-Stars, appear in the National
Recording Registry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  2024,  Craft  Latino,  one  of  the  largest
collections  of  Latin  music  master  recordings and compositions, will
commemorate the roster of artists  and  the  history  of  Fania  Records
through numerous events; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of Fania Records is in direct correlation to
the efforts of its members, whose involvement is, and always  has  been,
characterized  by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and
an uncompromising standard of excellence in all endeavors on  behalf  of
the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of Fania  Records,  and  to  honor  its
members,  past  and  present,  who  have  labored  so conscientiously to
improve the quality of life for the citizens of the community; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Fania Records.
