  COMMENDING  the  Center  for Black Literature upon
  the occasion of  hosting  its  2023  National  Black
  Writers Conference Biennial Symposium
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  those
organizations  which  foster  ethnic  pride  and  enhance the profile of
cultural diversity which strengthens the fabric of  the  communities  of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Center  for  Black  Literature  (CBL) upon the occasion of
hosting its 2023 National Black Writers Conference Biennial Symposium on
Friday, March 31, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 2002, the Center for Black Literature at  Medgar
Evers  College  of  the  City  University  of  New  York  has served the
interests of the people of the Empire State  by  expanding,  broadening,
and  enriching  the  public's  knowledge  and  appreciation  of  Black
literature by  people  of  the  African  Diaspora  and  of  the  African
continent for 21 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The theme for this year's Symposium is "Diasporic Visions:
A Celebration of Black Speculative Fiction," a  genre  that  encompasses
and  blurs  the  genres  of  magical realism, futurism, horror, fantasy,
paranormal, and mythology; these imaginative stories enable  writers  to
create  alternative  and  futuristic  worlds,  narratives  rooted  in
traditional beliefs and spirituality, and stories that center the  Black
experience,  while  raising  questions about topics such as colonialism,
race, identity, and gender; and
 
  WHEREAS, At the 2023  National  Black  Writers  Conference  Biennial
Symposium,  writers  and  scholars  will  discuss  the Black speculative
fiction's history and themes, as well as  emerging  scholarship  on  the
genre;  the  public  gathering  will  feature  interactive  roundtable
discussions, conversations, and opportunities for  attendees  to  engage
with fellow writers, readers, and fans of the genre; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  achieve  its mission, the CBL offers literary programs
and  educational  workshops  for  the  public,  students  of  all  ages,
teachers, writers, and artists; among its core programs are the National
Black  Writers  Conference,  Re-Envisioning Our Lives through Literature
(ROLL), the Wild Seeds Retreat for Writers of Color, the Dr. Edith  Rock
Writing Workshop for Elders, the John Oliver Killens Reading Series, and
the  weekly  Writers on Writing Radio Program; the Center also publishes
the peer-reviewed Killens Review of Arts & Letters, and  other  journals
generated from its youth and elders programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr. Brenda M. Greene is the founder and executive director
of the Center for Black Literature at Medgar Evers  College,  CUNY;  her
educational  leadership  and professional accomplishments span more than
45 years; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Well-versed  in  her field, Dr. Brenda M. Greene taught at
the Board of Education before becoming Director of  the  Right  to  Read
Program  at  Malcolm  King  College Harlem Extension, has served on many
college committees at Medgar Evers College, has served  as  director  of
literacy  and  writing  programs  for  youth  and adults, and has been a
jurist for professional and literary organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally, Dr. Brenda M. Greene is the visionary  behind
groundbreaking  public and academic programs that support Black Writers;
she is also the host of the long-running  weekly  program,  "Writers  on
Writing,"  heard  on  New York airwaves (WNYE, 91.5 FM) and globally via
YouTube; and
 
  WHEREAS, Most notably through the Center for Black  Literature,  Dr.
Brenda  M.  Greene  has  consistently  pursued her passion of expanding,
broadening,  and  enriching  the  public's  knowledge  and  aesthetic
appreciation  of  the value of the literature produced by Black writers;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In so effectively carrying out its mission, the Center  for
Black  Literature  has demonstrated the value of uplifting the voices of
Black writers from all walks of life, providing a space for  growth  and
education, while providing platforms for success; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Center for Black Literature upon the occasion of hosting its
2023 National Black Writers Conference Biennial  Symposium;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
