 ing  at  which  the  child  was freed, provided adequate notice has been
 given.
  (ii) At the conclusion of the hearing pursuant to section one thousand

 certain scheduled within the next eight months, the  permanency  hearing
 for  each child subsequently removed from the home shall be scheduled on
