interventions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bangladesh is a  thriving  democracy,  whose  people  enjoy
freedom, popular representation, and prosperity; and

the  Father  of the Nation, becoming its first President and later Prime
Minister; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bangladesh celebrates its Independence  Day  on  March  26,
commemorating  the  anniversary of the 1971 radio broadcast of a message
from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaiming Bangladeshi independence; and
 
  WHEREAS, The independence of Bangladesh was only possible because of
the Freedom Fighters who courageously  risked  their  lives  to  provide
fierce resistance during the war, and Bangladesh Independence Day honors
their bravery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States  is  home to about 200,000 Bangladeshi
Americans, many of whom live in the New York area, where they have  made
immeasurable contributions to all facets of life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  60,000  Bangladeshi Americans live in New York City,
where they constitute  a  proud,  vibrant  community,  and  count  among
themselves  small  business  owners,  doctors,  developers, journalists,
scholars, artists, municipal workers, drivers for  hire,  and  community
leaders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bangladeshi  New  Yorkers  have left an indelible imprint,
comprising one of the fastest-growing  communities  in  New  York  City,
where Bengali is now one of the most commonly-spoken languages; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
 
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
