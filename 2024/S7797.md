  in  relation  to  real  property tax exemptions for educational insti-
  tutions

  Section 1. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 1 of  arti-
 cle 16 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  Section 1. The power of taxation shall never be surrendered, suspended
 or  contracted  away, except as to securities issued for public purposes

 the types of taxes which may be imposed thereunder and provide for their
 review.
  Exemptions  from  taxation  may  be  granted  only  by  general  laws.
 Exemptions may be altered or repealed except  those  exempting  real  or
 personal  property used exclusively for religious, educational or chari-
 table purposes as defined by law and owned by any corporation or associ-
 ation organized or  conducted  exclusively  for  one  or  more  of  such
 purposes  and  not  operating  for  profit;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT
 EXEMPTIONS OF REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY  USED  EXCLUSIVELY  FOR  PRIVATE
 INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION MAY BE ALTERED OR REPEALED.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That the foregoing be referred
 to  the  first  regular  legislative  session  convening  after the next
 succeeding general election of members of the assembly, and, in conform-
 ity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3
 months previous to the time of such election.
