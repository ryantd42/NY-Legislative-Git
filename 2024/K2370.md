  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 4, 2024, as Cancer Survivors Day in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Cancer  is  a medical, social, psychological, and economic
issue; each and every day, people make decisions affecting the lives  of
the  millions  of people who are suffering from, or are close to someone
who suffers from cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, with over 16.9 million  Americans  surviving  cancer
each  year,  as  a  result of revolutionary advances in early detection,
research studies and treatment, we have the opportunity to  pay  tribute
to cancer survivors and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  order to promote awareness of cancer, on Tuesday, June
4, 2024, communities across New York State will celebrate life  as  part
of  the  world's  largest  Cancer Survivors event; this special day also
honors those who have lost their battle with cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is a day when we come together to commemorate the  daily
struggles  which  cancer  patients,  survivors,  and  their  families
experience, a day which makes all of us aware that cancer is  a  disease
without  boundaries;  crossing  the lines of color, race, creed, sex and
age, it is an unbiased disease which affects not only the lives of those
inflicted with the disease, but their loved ones as well; and
 
  WHEREAS, On this day, New York State residents will be able to  make
a  difference and applaud survivors for overcoming this illness; it will
be a day of lamentation for those who lost their lives,  and  a  day  of
rejoicing for those who have conquered it; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  people of New York State salute all cancer survivors,
and individuals and groups which promote awareness of this  disease  and
the  need  for  a cure; these organizations put their daily efforts into
educating  and  informing  our  entire  society;  their  hard  work  and
dedication  are  recognized  on  this  day as an undertaking which is an
everlasting endeavor; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim June 4, 2024, as Cancer
Survivors Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York, and the New York Cancer Center, Brooklyn, New York.
