  stalking

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 22 of section 296  of  the  executive  law,  as
 added by chapter 176 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  22. (a) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employ-
 er  or licensing agency, because of any individual's ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED
 status as a victim of domestic violence, A SEX OFFENSE, OR  STALKING  to
 refuse  to  hire  or  employ  or  license or to bar or to discharge from
 employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in
 compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.
  (b) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer or
 employment agency to print or circulate or cause to be printed or circu-
 lated any statement, advertisement or publication, or to use any form of
 application for employment or to make any  inquiry  in  connection  with
 prospective  employment  which  expresses,  directly  or indirectly, any
 limitation, specification or discrimination as to AN ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED
 status as a victim of domestic violence, A SEX OFFENSE, OR STALKING,  or
 any intent to make any such limitation, specification or discrimination;
 provided,  however,  that  no  provision  of  this  subdivision shall be
 construed to prohibit the employer from making any inquiry or  obtaining
 information  for the purpose of providing assistance to, or a reasonable
 accommodation in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision  to,
 a victim of domestic violence, A SEX OFFENSE, OR STALKING.
  (c)(1) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer
 to  refuse  to  provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee who is
 known by the employer to be a victim of domestic violence,  [limited  to
 those  accommodations  set  forth in subparagraph two of this paragraph,
 when such employee must be absent from work for a  reasonable  time,]  A

 SEX  OFFENSE,  OR  STALKING, WHERE SUCH ACCOMMODATIONS WOULD ENABLE SUCH
 EMPLOYEE TO SATISFY THE  ESSENTIAL  REQUISITES  OF  A  JOB  unless  such
 [absence]  REQUESTED ACCOMMODATIONS would cause an undue hardship to the
 employer as set forth in subparagraph three of this paragraph, provided,
 however that the employer may require an employee to charge any time off
 pursuant  to this section against any leave with pay ordinarily granted,
 where available, unless otherwise provided for in a collective  bargain-
 ing  agreement  or  existing  employee  handbook or policy, and any such
 absence that cannot be charged may be treated as leave without  pay.  An
 employee  who  must  be absent from work in accordance with subparagraph
 two of this paragraph shall be  entitled  to  the  continuation  of  any
 health insurance coverage provided by the employer, to which the employ-
 ee is otherwise entitled during any such absence.
  (2)  An  employer is required to provide a reasonable accommodation to
 an employee who is a victim of domestic violence  [who  must  be  absent
 from  work for a reasonable time], A SEX OFFENSE, OR STALKING in accord-
 ance with the provisions of subparagraph one  of  this  paragraph,  SUCH
 REASONABLE  ACCOMMODATION  MAY  INCLUDE,  BUT  SHALL  NOT BE LIMITED TO,
 ABSENCE FROM WORK FOR A REASONABLE TIME FOR REASONS INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT
 limited to, the following:
  (i) Seeking medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence
 including  for  a  child  who  is  a  victim of domestic violence, A SEX

 rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence; or
  (iii) Obtaining psychological counseling related  to  an  incident  or
 incidents  of  domestic  violence, A SEX OFFENSE, OR STALKING, including
 for a child who is a victim [of domestic violence],  provided  that  the
 employee  is  not the perpetrator [of the domestic violence] against the
 child; or
  (iv) Participating in safety planning  and  taking  other  actions  to
 increase  safety  from  future  incidents  of  domestic  violence, A SEX
 OFFENSE, OR STALKING, including temporary or permanent relocation; or
  (v) Obtaining legal services, assisting  in  the  prosecution  of  the

 of domestic violence, A SEX OFFENSE, OR STALKING.
  (3) An employer is required to provide a reasonable accommodation [for
 an employee's absence] in accordance with  the  provisions  of  subpara-
 graphs one and two of this paragraph unless the employer can demonstrate
 that  the  employee's  absence would constitute an undue hardship to the
 employer. A determination of whether such an absence will constitute  an
 undue hardship shall include consideration of factors such as:
  (i)  The  overall  size  of  the  business, program or enterprise with
 respect to the number of employees, number and type of  facilities,  and
 size of budget; and
  (ii)  The  type  of operation in which the business, program or enter-
 prise is engaged, including the composition and structure of  the  work-
 force.
  (4) IT SHALL BE AN UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICE FOR AN EMPLOYER TO

 REASONABLE TIME WITH AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAS REQUESTED A REASONABLE ACCOMMO-
 DATION UNDER THIS SECTION.
  (5) An employee who must be absent from work in  accordance  with  the
 provisions  of  subparagraph  one  of  this  paragraph shall provide the

 unless such advance notice is not feasible.
  [(5)]  (6) An employee who must be absent from work in accordance with
 the provisions of subparagraph one of  this  paragraph  and  who  cannot
 feasibly  give  reasonable  advance  notice of the absence in accordance
 with subparagraph four of this paragraph must, within a reasonable  time
 after  the  absence,  provide  a  certification  to  the  employer  when
 requested by the employer. ANY PERSON REQUIRED BY  SUBPARAGRAPH  ONE  OF
 THIS  PARAGRAPH  TO  MAKE  REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION MAY REQUIRE A PERSON

 manner as an  employee  with  any  other  disability,  pursuant  to  the

 natory practices.

 dentiality of any information AND DOCUMENTATION regarding an  employee's
