  COMMEMORATING  the  Centennial  Anniversary of the
  Parish Public Library on May 30, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the communities  across  the  great
State of New York is reflective of certain exemplary organizations whose
purpose  is  dedicated  to  serving  the  community and the needs of its
citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the Centennial Anniversary of the Parish Public  Library  on
Thursday, May 30, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  humble  beginnings,  the Parish Public Library began
construction in May of 1922;  the  library  served  as  a  gift  to  the
citizens  of Parish from Samuel Franklin Mills and Nathan Albert Petrie,
first cousins born and raised in the town of Parish; and
 
  WHEREAS, Briefly serving as the  headquarters  for  the  local  bank
after  it  was  destroyed  by  a  fire,  the  Parish  Public Library was
officially dedicated on May 30, 1924, and chartered by New York State on
April 24, 1926; and
 
  WHEREAS, To begin its collection, Nathan Albert Petrie  donated  500
volumes  from  his personal library to the Parish Public Library; today,
the library's collection  has  grown  to  more  than  26,000  print  and
electronic items; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Providing  enrichment,  enlightenment,  education,  and
entertainment to the members of the community for over  100  years,  the
Parish  Public  Library  serves  residents  of the five towns within the
Altmar-Parish-Williamstown Central School District; it also  facilitates
over 3300 annual patron visits, hosts numerous youth and adult programs,
and provides various other services; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Parish Public Library became part of the North Country
Library System in 1983; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  the  Parish  Public  Library  is  undergoing
construction for an addition that will almost double its size, expanding
its capacity to serve the local community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Parish Public Library has been an invaluable resource
for residents of Parish, New York, for 100 years;  people  come  to  the
library  to  connect,  discover,  and  learn  through  story times, book
groups, and various programs for all ages; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the  Parish  Public  Library  is  in  direct
correlation to the efforts of its dedicated leadership, and its members,
whose  involvement  is,  and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an
impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising
 
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of the library and the
population it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Steeped  in  a proud and distinguished history, the Parish
Public Library may take just pride in its purposeful growth, as it looks
forward  to  continuing  to  serve  the  educational,  cultural,  and
intellectual needs of the community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the Centennial Anniversary of the Parish Public  Library  on
May 30, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
