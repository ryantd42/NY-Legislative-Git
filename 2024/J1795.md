  HONORING  Northern  Erie  Sno-Seekers  upon  the
  occasion of its  designation  as  recipient  of  the
  Organization  of  the  Year  Award  by  the Clarence
  Chamber of Commerce on March 21, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend those distinguished organizations who would devote their purpose
to  community  service,  contributing  to the welfare of the citizens of
their communities and this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Northern Erie Sno-Seekers (NESS) upon the occasion of its designation as
recipient  of the Organization of the Year Award by the Clarence Chamber
of Commerce, to be celebrated at its Annual  Awards  Gala  on  Thursday,
March 21, 2024, at Samuel's Grande Manor in Clarence, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Northern  Erie  Sno-Seekers  is receiving this prestigious
award for its  steadfast  and  unremitting  commitment  to  the  beloved
community of Clarence Center, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  1973,  Northern Erie Sno-Seekers has been
committed to the safe and  responsible  use  of  snowmobiles  since  its
inception;  with  over  400  members,  NESS constantly seeks out ways to
ensure an enjoyable snowmobile season for both  riders  and  landowners;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Maintaining  125  miles  of trails across 13 townships and
villages in three counties, NESS provides outstanding community  service
and  even  has  extended  its  support  during  times of weather-related
emergencies several times over the past 20 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Devoted to serving the community, Northern Erie Sno-Seekers
used their groomer, one of the only vehicles that could  trudge  through
the  snow,  to rescue 41 people during the Buffalo Christmas Blizzard of
2022; after the immediate emergency passed, the NESS  groomer  continued
working  for  days  during  storm  recovery to transport plow drivers, a
highway superintendent, police officers, nurses, and  doctors  to  their
jobs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown  a
long  and  sustained  commitment to excellence certainly have earned the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Northern Erie Sno-Seekers upon the occasion of its designation as
recipient of the Organization of the Year Award by the Clarence  Chamber
of Commerce on March 21, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Northern Erie Sno-Seekers.
