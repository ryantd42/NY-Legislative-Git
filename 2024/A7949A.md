 thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight.  If  the  taxpayer  becomes
 subject  to  tax in this state after the taxable year beginning in nine-
 teen hundred ninety-eight, then the taxpayer is not required to  satisfy
 the  employment test provided in the preceding sentence of this subpara-
 graph for its first taxable year. For purposes of clause (iii)  of  this
 subparagraph  the employment test will be based on the number of employ-
 ees located in this state on the last day of the first taxable year  the

 must be aggregated to determine whether the property is principally used
 in qualifying uses, then either each affiliate using the  property  must

 regulated broker, dealer, and registered investment  adviser  using  the
 property.  For  purposes  of  clause  (A) of this subparagraph, tangible
 personal property and other tangible property shall not include property

  (A)  A  credit  shall be allowed under this subsection with respect to
 tangible personal property and other tangible property, including build-
 ings and structural components  of  buildings,  which  are:  depreciable
 pursuant  to  section  one  hundred  sixty-seven of the internal revenue
 code, have a useful life of four years or more, are acquired by purchase
 as defined in section one  hundred  seventy-nine  (d)  of  the  internal
 revenue code, have a situs in this state and are (i) principally used by
 the  taxpayer  in  the production of goods by manufacturing, processing,
 assembling, refining, mining, extracting, farming,  agriculture,  horti-
 culture,  floriculture,  viticulture  or commercial fishing, (ii) indus-
 trial waste treatment facilities or air  pollution  control  facilities,
 used in the taxpayer's trade or business, (iii) research and development
 property, (iv) principally used in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's
 trade  or business as a broker or dealer in connection with the purchase
 or sale (which shall include but not be limited to the issuance,  enter-
 ing  into,  assumption, offset, assignment, termination, or transfer) of
 stocks, bonds or other securities as defined  in  section  four  hundred
 seventy-five  (c)(2)  of the Internal Revenue Code, or of commodities as
 defined in section 475(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, (v)  principally
 used  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the taxpayer's trade or business of
 providing investment advisory services for a regulated investment compa-
 ny as defined in section eight hundred fifty-one of the Internal Revenue
 Code, or lending, loan  arrangement  or  loan  origination  services  to
 A. 7949--A  11
 
 customers  in  connection with the purchase or sale (which shall include
 but not be limited to the issuance, entering into,  assumption,  offset,
 assignment,  termination,  or  transfer)  of  securities  as  defined in
 section  four  hundred seventy-five (c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code,
 or (vi) principally used as a qualified film production facility includ-
 ing qualified film production facilities having a  situs  in  an  empire
 zone  designated  as  such pursuant to article eighteen-B of the general
 municipal law, where the taxpayer is providing three or more services to
 any qualified film production company using the facility, including such
 services as a studio lighting grid, lighting and grip equipment,  multi-
 line  phone service, broadband information technology access, industrial
 scale electrical capacity, food services, security services,  and  heat-
 ing,  ventilation and air conditioning. For purposes of clauses (iv) and
 (v) of this subparagraph, property purchased by  a  taxpayer  affiliated
 with  a  regulated  broker,  dealer, or registered investment adviser is
 allowed a credit under this subsection if the property is  used  by  its
 affiliated  regulated broker, dealer or registered investment adviser in
 accordance with this subsection. For  purposes  of  determining  if  the
 property is principally used in qualifying uses, the uses by the taxpay-
 er  described in clauses (iv) and (v) of this subparagraph may be aggre-
 gated. In addition, the uses by the taxpayer, its  affiliated  regulated
 broker, dealer and registered investment adviser under either or both of
 those clauses may be aggregated. Provided, however, a taxpayer shall not
 be  allowed the credit provided by clauses (iv) and (v) of this subpara-
 graph unless (I) eighty percent or more of the employees performing  the
 administrative  and  support  functions resulting from or related to the
 qualifying uses of such equipment are located in this state, or (II) the
 average number of employees that perform the administrative and  support
 functions  resulting  from  or  related  to  the qualifying uses of such
 equipment and are located in this state  during  the  taxable  year  for
 which  the  credit  is  claimed  is equal to or greater than ninety-five
 percent of the average number of employees that perform these  functions
 and  are  located in this state during the thirty-six months immediately
 preceding the year for which the credit is claimed, or (III) the  number
 of employees located in this state during the taxable year for which the
 credit  is  claimed  is  equal  to or greater than ninety percent of the
 number of employees located in  this  state  on  December  thirty-first,
 nineteen  hundred  ninety-eight  or,  if the taxpayer was not a calendar
 year taxpayer in nineteen hundred ninety-eight,  the  last  day  of  its
 first  taxable year ending after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
 ninety-eight. If the taxpayer becomes subject to tax in this state after
 the taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred  ninety-eight,  then  the
 taxpayer  is not required to satisfy the employment test provided in the
 preceding sentence of this subparagraph for its first taxable year.  For
 the  purposes  of  clause (III) of this subparagraph the employment test
 will be based on the number of employees located in this  state  on  the
 last  day  of  the  first taxable year the taxpayer is subject to tax in
 this state. If the uses of the property must be aggregated to  determine
 whether the property is principally used in qualifying uses, then either
 each  affiliate  using the property must satisfy this employment test or
 this employment test must be satisfied through the  aggregation  of  the
 employees  of the taxpayer, its affiliated regulated broker, dealer, and
 registered investment adviser using the property. For purposes of clause
 (i) of this subparagraph, tangible personal property and other  tangible
 property  shall not include property principally used by the taxpayer in
 the  production  or  distribution  of  electricity,  natural  gas  after

  (vi)  for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thou-
 sand fourteen, the amount prescribed by this paragraph  for  a  taxpayer
 that is a qualified New York manufacturer, shall be computed at the rate
 of  zero  percent  of  the  taxpayer's  business  income  base. The term
 "manufacturer"  shall  mean  a  taxpayer that during the taxable year is
 principally engaged in the production of goods by  manufacturing,  proc-
 essing,  assembling, refining, mining, extracting, farming, agriculture,
 horticulture, floriculture, viticulture or commercial fishing.  However,
 the  generation  and  distribution  of  electricity, the distribution of
 natural gas, [and] the production of steam associated  with  the  gener-
 ation  of  electricity,  AND THE PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION,
 TRANSPORTATION, OR STORAGE OF FOSSIL FUELS AS DEFINED IN  SECTION  1-103
 OF  THE ENERGY LAW shall not be qualifying activities for a manufacturer
 under this subparagraph. Moreover, in the case of a combined report, the
 combined group shall be considered a "manufacturer" for purposes of this
 subparagraph only if the combined group during the taxable year is prin-
 cipally engaged in the activities set forth in this  paragraph,  or  any
 combination  thereof. A taxpayer or, in the case of a combined report, a
 combined group shall be "principally engaged"  in  activities  described
 above  if, during the taxable year, more than fifty percent of the gross
 receipts of the taxpayer or combined group,  respectively,  are  derived
 from  receipts  from  the  sale of goods produced by such activities. In
 computing a combined group's  gross  receipts,  intercorporate  receipts
 shall  be  eliminated. A "qualified New York manufacturer" is a manufac-
 turer that has property in New York that is described in clause  (A)  of
 subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph  (b)  of subdivision one of section two
 hundred ten-B of this article and either (I) the adjusted basis of  such
 property  for  New  York  state tax purposes at the close of the taxable
 year is at least one million  dollars  or  (II)  all  of  its  real  and
 personal  property is located in New York. A taxpayer or, in the case of
 a combined report, a combined group, that does not satisfy  the  princi-
 pally  engaged  test  may  be  a  qualified New York manufacturer if the
 taxpayer or the combined group employs during the taxable year at  least
 two thousand five hundred employees in manufacturing in New York and the
 taxpayer  or  the combined group has property in the state used in manu-
 facturing, the adjusted basis of which for New York state  tax  purposes
 at  the  close  of  the  taxable  year  is  at least one hundred million
 dollars.
  § 33. Subparagraph 2 of paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section  210
 of  the  tax law, as amended by section 2 of part D of chapter 59 of the
 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (2) For purposes of subparagraph  one  of  this  paragraph,  the  term
 "manufacturer"  shall  mean  a  taxpayer that during the taxable year is
 principally engaged in the production of goods by  manufacturing,  proc-
 essing,  assembling, refining, mining, extracting, farming, agriculture,
 horticulture, floriculture, viticulture or commercial fishing; PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION, TRANSPORTATION,  OR
 STORAGE  OF  FOSSIL  FUELS AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1-103 OF THE ENERGY LAW
 SHALL NOT BE QUALIFYING ACTIVITIES FOR A MANUFACTURER UNDER THIS SUBPAR-
 AGRAPH. Moreover, for purposes  of  computing  the  capital  base  in  a
 combined report, the combined group shall be considered a "manufacturer"
 for  purposes of this subparagraph only if the combined group during the
 taxable year is principally engaged in the activities set forth in  this
 subparagraph,  or any combination thereof. A taxpayer or, in the case of
 a combined report, a combined group shall be  "principally  engaged"  in
 activities  described above if, during the taxable year, more than fifty
 A. 7949--A  18
 
 percent of the gross receipts of the taxpayer or combined group, respec-
 tively, are derived from receipts from the sale  of  goods  produced  by
 such  activities. In computing a combined group's gross receipts, inter-
 corporate  receipts  shall be eliminated. A "qualified New York manufac-
 turer" is a manufacturer that has property in New York that is described
 in clause (A) of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of subdivision one of
 section two hundred ten-B of this article and either  (i)  the  adjusted
 basis  of  that property for New York state tax purposes at the close of
 the taxable year is at least one million dollars or (ii) all of its real
 and personal property is located in New York. In addition, a  "qualified
 New  York  manufacturer" means a taxpayer that is defined as a qualified
 emerging technology company under paragraph (c) of  subdivision  one  of
 section  thirty-one  hundred two-e of the public authorities law regard-
 less of the ten million dollar limitation expressed in subparagraph  one
 of  such  paragraph.  A taxpayer or, in the case of a combined report, a
 combined group, that does not satisfy the principally engaged  test  may
 be  a  qualified  New  York manufacturer if the taxpayer or the combined
 group employs during the taxable year at least two thousand five hundred
 employees in manufacturing in New York and the taxpayer or the  combined
 group  has  property  in  the  state used in manufacturing, the adjusted
 basis of which for New York state tax purposes at the close of the taxa-
 ble year is at least one hundred million dollars.

 ble  years  commencing  on or after the first of January next succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law; provided, however, that:
