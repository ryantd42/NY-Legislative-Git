  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 28, 2023, as Rare Disease Awareness Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days set aside to increase awareness  of  serious  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 28, 2023, as Rare
Disease  Awareness Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Rare Disease Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Rare Disease Awareness Day  is  an  observance  to
raise  awareness  of  rare  diseases  and diseases of unmet need, few of
which have cures or specific drugs to treat symptoms, and are often  not
diagnosed for many years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  2023  marks the 15th Anniversary of Rare Disease Awareness
Day in the United States; the first Rare Disease Awareness Day was  held
in  2008  on  February 29th, a 'rare' date which happens only once every
four years; ever since then, Rare Disease Awareness has taken  place  on
the  last  day  of February, a month known for having a 'rare' number of
days; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare Disease Awareness Day was established for the  reason,
according  to  the  European  Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS),
that treatment for many rare diseases and  diseases  of  unmet  need  is
insufficient,  as  are  the  social networks to support individuals with
rare diseases and diseases of unmet need and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS, One year later, in 2009, Rare Disease  Awareness  Day  went
global  as  the National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD) mobilized
200 rare disease patient advocacy organizations in the United States  in
an effort to coordinate activities and better promote the day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2013, in recognition of the needs of patients with rare
diseases, Albany Medical  Center  and  College  established  the  Albany
Medical  Center's  Rare  Disease Forum, which was the genesis of the New
York State Rare Disease Alliance, whose purpose  is  to  promote  faster
diagnosis  of  rare  diseases, research into therapies and cures, and to
foster wider public recognition  of  public  health  problems  affecting
25-30 million Americans; 1 in 10 New Yorkers suffer from a rare disease;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are nearly 7,000 diseases and conditions considered
rare; it is paramount to stress the importance  of  early  detection  of
said diseases, as well as work to minimize the severity of their effects
through proper funding of research and public awareness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Of these 7,000 rare diseases, more than 95% are without FDA
approved treatment; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  many  rare  diseases and diseases of unmet need are
genetic, tragically, approximately half  the  people  affected  by  rare
diseases in the United States are children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Research  on  rare  diseases,  which are serious and often
life-threatening, is vitally  important  due  to  it  frequently  adding
significantly  to  the general understanding of more common diseases and
conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, People suffering from rare  diseases  typically  experience
difficulty in obtaining a timely, accurate diagnosis, finding physicians
or  treatment  centers and experience limited treatment options, options
generally considered more expensive than those for common diseases; and
 
  WHEREAS, It typically takes between six to eight years on average to
receive an accurate diagnosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Biopharmaceutical research companies, academic researchers,
patient groups, and others are applying the growing understanding of the
causes of rare diseases to speed the development of new  treatments  for
patients;  the  Orphan  Drug Act of 1983 has been and continues to be an
important force in driving treatment innovation for rare diseases; and
 
  WHEREAS, Advances in DNA sequencing have led to  the  identification
of the genetic cause of several rare disease, which can potentially lead
to  better  understanding  of  the  disease  and development of targeted
therapies; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2020, legislation creating a Rare Disease Advisory  Work
Group  was  signed  into  law;  this  Work  Group  will  be  composed of
individuals with expertise in rare disease who will focus  on  improving
awareness  of  rare  diseases  and  evaluating  barriers  to  treatment,
including financial barriers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, there is more hope than ever before  with  over  560
medicines  in  development for patients with rare diseases; medicines in
development include 151 for rare cancers and 82 for rare blood  cancers,
accounting  for 40 percent of all rare disease medicines in development;
148 for genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular
atrophy; 38 for neurological disorders,  including  amyotrophic  lateral
sclerosis  (ALS), Stiff-Person Syndrome, and seizures; 31 for infectious
diseases, including rare bacterial  infections  and  hepatitis;  25  for
autoimmune  diseases,  including  systemic  sclerosis  and  juvenile
arthritis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Currently, research has led to  powerful  new  gene-editing
techniques holding promise for cures for blood disorders (such as Sickle
Cell  Disease,  Thalassemia,  Hemophilia),  Cancer,  Blindness,  Aids,
Muscular Dystrophy, Cystic Fibrosis, and Huntington's disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, These treatment options and medicines in development attack
the root of the cause for these patients that had few  or  no  treatment
options before; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
rare diseases and diseases of unmet need,  and  more  must  be  done  to
increase  activity  at  the  local, state and national levels to support
 
those  afflicted  as  well  as  their  families  and  caregivers;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 28, 2023, as Rare
Disease Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; the New York State Rare Disease Alliance; and NORD.
