  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and  intent. It is the duty of the
 state government to be responsible, open and transparent  about  how  it
 spends  the  taxpayer's  hard  earned money. With billions of dollars of
 lump sum appropriations included in the state  budget  that  include  no
 details  on  who  receives the money, or even which elected official has
 control over the appropriation, and with continued delays  in  releasing
 reports  by state agencies on the effectiveness of related programs, the
 government has failed to live up to  its  responsibility.  Often  times,
 this  failure  goes  even  deeper,  as  individuals  and  entities  have

 personally benefited from the lack of accountability  and  transparency.
 Therefore, the legislature finds it necessary to create a lump sum allo-
 cation  advisory committee, require greater transparency related to lump
 sum  appropriations,  implement penalties for certain state agencies and
 entities that fail to release timely reports, prohibit certain political
 contributions by appointees and conduct studies on how to  simplify  the
 current  tax  system  and economic development environment to ensure the
 current system that creates winners and losers is changed. By implement-
 ing these policies,  the  state  government  can  begin  to  repair  the
 complete breakdown of trust over how it allocates taxpayer money.
  §  2. This act enacts into law major components of legislation provid-
 ing for the creation  of  a  lump  sum  allocation  advisory  committee,
 requiring  greater  transparency  related  to  lump  sum appropriations,
 implementing penalties for certain state agencies and entities that fail
 to release timely reports, prohibiting certain  political  contributions
 by  appointees and conducting studies on how to simplify the current tax
 system and economic development environment to ensure the current system
 that creates winners and losers is changed.  Each  component  is  wholly
 contained  within  a Part identified as Parts A through G. The effective
 date for each particular provision contained within  such  Part  is  set
 forth  in  the  last  section of such Part. Any provision in any section
 contained within a Part, including the effective date of the Part, which
 makes reference to a section "of this act", when used in connection with
 that particular component, shall be deemed to  mean  and  refer  to  the
 corresponding  section of the Part in which it is found. Section four of
 this act sets forth the general effective date of this act.
