 AN ACT to amend the general municipal law, in  relation  to  authorizing

  authorizing  the provision of grants of such funds to historic preser-

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivisions  1, 3, 4 and 6 of section 6-s of the general
 municipal law, as added by chapter 596 of the laws of 2007 and paragraph
 (d) of subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 608 of the laws of 2019,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  As  used in this section, the following words and terms shall have
 the following meanings:
  (a) "Community  preservation"  shall  mean  and  include  any  of  the
 purposes outlined in subdivision four of this section.
  (b)  "Board" means the advisory board required pursuant to subdivision
 five of this section.
  (c) "Fund" means the community preservation fund created  pursuant  to
 subdivision two of this section.
  (d)  "Designated  community" means any town or city within the [Hudson
 Valley counties of Putnam, Ulster, or Westchester] STATE.
  (e) "Tax" means the real estate transfer tax payable on a real proper-
 ty conveyance pursuant to section fifteen hundred sixty-one of  the  tax
 law, but shall have a different meaning if the context clearly indicates
 such  as  the real estate transfer tax imposed pursuant to article thir-
 ty-one of the tax law.
  (F) "HISTORIC PRESERVATION SOCIETY" MEANS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT TAX  EXEMPT
 CORPORATION  OPERATED FOR CONSERVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL, OR HISTORIC PRES-
 ERVATION PURPOSES.
  3. The purposes of the fund shall be exclusively, (a) to  implement  a
 plan  for  the  preservation  of community character as required by this
 section, (b) to acquire interests or rights in  real  property  for  the
 preservation  of  community  character  within  the designated community

 including villages therein in accordance with such plan and  in  cooper-
 ation with willing sellers, (c) to establish a bank pursuant to a trans-
 fer  of  development  rights program consistent with section two hundred
 sixty-one-a  of  the  town  law and section twenty-f of the general city
 law, (d) to provide a management and stewardship program for such inter-
 ests and rights consistent with subdivision nine of this section and  in
 accordance  with  such  plan  designed  to preserve community character;
 provided that not more than ten percent of the fund  shall  be  utilized
 for  such management and stewardship program, [and] (e) to make payments
 to school, fire, fire protection and ambulance districts  in  connection
 with  lands  within the designated community that are owned by the state
 or any municipal corporation, AND (F) TO MAKE GRANTS TO HISTORIC PRESER-
 VATION SOCIETIES OPERATING WITHIN THE DESIGNATED COMMUNITY  ESTABLISHING
 THE  COMMUNITY  PRESERVATION  FUND.  Such payments may only be made to
 districts where more than twenty-five percent of the assessed  value  of
 such  district  is wholly exempt from real property taxation pursuant to
 the real property tax law because it is owned by the state or a  munici-
 pal  corporation.  Not more than ten percent of the fund may be used for
 such purpose in any calendar year. Such payments from the fund shall not
 exceed the actual tax liability that would have been due if  such  lands
 of  the  state  or  of  a municipal corporation had been subject to real
 property taxation. Where more than one district is eligible for  such  a
 payment  under  this paragraph, and such payment is less than the actual
 tax liability that would have been due if such lands of the state  or  a
 municipal  corporation  had  been subject to real property taxation, the
 designated community shall apportion such annual payment on the basis of
 the total tax levied by each district within  the  designated  community
 for  the  year such payment is made. Such payment made by the designated
 community shall be used solely to reduce the property tax  liability  of
 the  remaining taxpayers of the district within such designated communi-
 ty. If the implementation of the community  preservation  project  plan,
 adopted  by  a  governing  body,  as provided in subdivision six of this
 section, has been completed, and funds are  no  longer  needed  for  the
 purposes  outlined in this subdivision, then any remaining monies in the
 fund shall be applied to reduce any bonded indebtedness  or  obligations
 incurred to effectuate the purposes of this section.
  4.  Preservation  of  community character shall involve one or more of
 the following: (a) establishment of parks, nature preserves,  or  recre-
 ation  areas;  (b) preservation of open space; (c) preservation of lands
 of exceptional scenic value; (d) preservation  of  fresh  and  saltwater
 marshes  or  other wetlands; (e) preservation of aquifer recharge areas;
 (f) preservation of undeveloped beachlands or shoreline; (g)  establish-
 ment  of  wildlife  refuges for the purpose of maintaining native animal
 species diversity, including the protection of habitat essential to  the
 recovery  of rare, threatened or endangered species; (h) preservation of
 unique or threatened ecological areas; (i) preservation  of  rivers  and
 river  areas  in  a natural, free-flowing condition; (j) preservation of
 forested land; (k) preservation of public access to lands for public use
 including stream rights and  waterways;  (l)  preservation  of  historic
 places  and properties listed on the New York state register of historic
 places and/or protected under a municipal  historic  preservation  ordi-
 nance  or  law,  INCLUDING HISTORIC PLACES AND PROPERTIES OPERATED BY AN
 HISTORIC PRESERVATION SOCIETY OPERATING WITHIN THE DESIGNATED COMMUNITY;
 (m) undertaking any of the paragraphs of this subdivision in furtherance
 of the establishment of a greenbelt; and (n) preservation of land  which
 is  predominantly  viable  agricultural  land, as defined in subdivision
 A. 10690  3
 
 seven of section three hundred one of the agriculture and  markets  law,
 or unique and irreplaceable agricultural land, as defined in subdivision
 six of section three hundred one of the agriculture and markets law.
  6.  The  governing  body  of any designated community which has estab-
 lished a community preservation fund shall, by local law, adopt a commu-
 nity preservation project plan. This plan shall list every project which
 the designated community plans to undertake pursuant  to  the  community
 preservation  fund.  It shall include every parcel which is necessary to
 be acquired in the designated community in order  to  protect  community
 character.  Such  plan  shall  provide  for a detailed evaluation of all
 available land use alternatives to protect community character,  includ-
 ing  but  not  limited  to: (a) fee simple acquisition, (b) zoning regu-
 lations, including density reductions,  cluster  development,  and  site
 plan  and  design  requirements, (c) transfer of development rights, (d)
 the purchase of development rights,  and  (e)  scenic  and  conservation
 easements.  Such  evaluation  shall  be as specific as practicable as to
 each parcel selected for inclusion in the plan. The plan shall establish
 the priorities for preservation. Funds from the  community  preservation
 fund  may only be expended for projects which have been included in said
 plan.  AN HISTORIC PRESERVATION SOCIETY SEEKING A GRANT OF FUNDS FOR THE
 PRESERVATION OF A PLACE OR PROPERTY IT OPERATES SHALL SUBMIT A  DETAILED
 PLAN  DESCRIBING  THE PRESERVATION MEASURES IT SEEKS TO IMPLEMENT TO THE
 GOVERNING BODY OF THE DESIGNATED COMMUNITY FOR INCLUSION IN THE PLAN AND
 ANY UPDATES THEREOF. Such plan shall be updated not less than once every
 five years. A copy of the plan shall be filed with the  commissioner  of
 environmental  conservation, the commissioner of agriculture and markets
 and the commissioner of the office of  parks,  recreation  and  historic
 preservation.  Such  plan  shall be completed at least sixty days before
 the submission of the mandatory referendum required by  section  fifteen
 hundred  sixty-one of the tax law and shall be made available for public
 review at  the  designated  community  clerk's  office,  at  any  public
 libraries within the designated community, and where practical posted on
 the municipality's website.
  §  2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date upon which it shall have become a law.
