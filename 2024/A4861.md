 ANY  SUCH  SINKING  FUND DURING ANY YEAR SHALL, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS
 DEFINITION, BE CONSIDERED AS MATURING IN  THE  YEAR  DURING  WHICH  SUCH
 PAYMENT  IS REQUIRED AND NOT IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE STATED MATURITY OF
 SUCH BONDS OCCURS. IN COMPUTING THE AMOUNT OF ANY DEBT  SERVICE  RESERVE
 FUND  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS SECTION, SECURITIES IN WHICH ALL OR A
 PORTION OF SUCH FUND SHALL BE INVESTED SHALL BE VALUED  AT  PAR,  OR  IF
 PURCHASED AT LESS THAN PAR, AT THEIR COST TO THE AUTHORITY.
