BY: Senator THOMAS
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 5-11, 2023, as Consumer Protection Week in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to those who
seek to educate citizens on their consumer rights and protect  consumers
throughout our State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March 5-11, 2023, as
Consumer Protection Week in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with
the observance of National Consumer Protection Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Consumer  Protection  Week  is the Federal Trade
Commission's Annual Week of Recognition during March which promotes  the
education  of  consumer  rights  and  assisting  consumers  in  making
well-informed decisions about their money; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Federal Trade Commission will be celebrating its Annual
National Consumer Protection Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Consumer Protection Week began  in  1998  to  help
educate  consumers  about  their  credit  and  debit,  how  to  stop
telemarketing calls, how to safely shop online, and how to tell  if  you
are being scammed or if your identity is being stolen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year during this week, the Federal Trade Commission,
along with numerous Consumer Protection organizations come  together  to
host  educational  events  and  provide  instructional materials through
publications, social media, and their main website; and
 
  WHEREAS, The education of consumer rights remains vital as consumers
still face many dangers; the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that
17.7 million Americans have fallen victim  to  identity  theft  in  2016
alone; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Events  which  provide  a means of educating consumers and
helping them  make  well  informed  decisions  regarding  their  credit,
telemarketing  cards,  online shopping, and scams help contribute to the
consumer protection of our great State and Nation, and are held  in  the
highest regard by this Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  March  5-11,  2023,  as
Consumer Protection Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
