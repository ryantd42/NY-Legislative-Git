  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2024, as Black History Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Black  History  Month,  previously  known as Negro History
Week, was founded by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, and was first celebrated  on
February  1,  1926;  since  1976,  it has become a nationally recognized
month-long celebration, held each year during the month of  February  to
acknowledge  and  pay  tribute  to  African-Americans  neglected by both
society and the history books; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  month  of  February  observes  the  rich  and  diverse
heritage of our great State and Nation and encourages the celebration of
Black  History  Month to provide a continuing opportunity for all people
in the United States to learn from the past, and understand the  factors
that  have  shaped and guided the course of our present-day experiences;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Black History Month seeks to emphasize that  Black  History
is American History; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Black  History Month is a time to reflect on the struggles
and victories of African-Americans throughout our country's history  and
to  recognize their numerous valuable contributions to the protection of
our democratic society in war and in peace; and
 
  WHEREAS, Some African-American pioneers whose many  accomplishments,
all  which  took  place  during the month of February, went unnoticed as
well as numerous  symbolic  events  in  February,  that  deserve  to  be
memorialized  include: John Sweat Rock, a noted Boston lawyer who became
the first African-American admitted to argue  before  the  U.S.  Supreme
Court on February 1, 1865, and the first African-American to be received
on  the  floor  of  the  U.S.  House of Representatives; Jonathan Jasper
Wright, the first African-American to hold a  major  judicial  position,
who was elected to the South Carolina Supreme Court on February 1, 1870;
President  Abraham  Lincoln submitted the proposed 13th Amendment to the
U.S.  Constitution, abolishing slavery, to the states  for  ratification
on February 1, 1865; civil rights protester Jimmie Lee Jackson died from
wounds  inflicted  during a protest on February 26, 1965, leading to the
historic Selma, Alabama civil rights  demonstrations,  including  Bloody
Sunday  in  which  600  demonstrators, including Martin Luther King, Jr.
were  attacked  by  police;  Autherine  J.  Lucy  became  the  first
African-American student to attend the University of Alabama on February
3,  1956,  she  was  expelled  three  days later "for her own safety" in
response to threats from a mob; in 1992, Autherine Lucy Foster graduated
from the University of Alabama with a Master's degree in Education,  the
same day her daughter, Grazia Foster, graduated with a Bachelor's degree
in  Corporate Finance; the Negro Baseball League was founded on February
3, 1920; Jack Johnson,  the  first  African-American  World  Heavyweight
Boxing  Champion,  won his first title on February 3, 1903; and Reginald

the largest Black-owned business in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the impact of African-American contributions
to the moral fabric and history of this great  Nation  are  ever-growing

person to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in  1993;  Robert  Stanton,
the  first  Black  Director  of the National Park Service in 1997; Venus

United States in 2002; Sophia Danenberg, reaching unprecedented heights,

2021, and inductee of the National Black Distance Running Hall  of  Fame
in  2022, all of whom encompass the many more powerful Black individuals
who pushed through countless obstacles to  earn  the  respect  of  their
peers and this Great State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition  of  the  vast  contributions  of
African-Americans, a joyful month-long celebration is  held  across  New
York  State  and across the United States with many commemorative events
to honor and display the cultural heritage of African-Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  commends  the  African-American
community  for  preserving,  for  future  generations, its centuries-old
traditions that benefit us all and add to the color and  beauty  of  the
tapestry which is our American society; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February  2024,  as  Black
History Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
