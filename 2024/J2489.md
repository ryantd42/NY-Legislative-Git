  COMMENDING  the  City  of  Schenectady  upon  the
  occasion of hosting its  19th  Annual  Little  Italy
  StreetFest on September 7, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to  those  municipalities  that  partner  with  their  local
business  communities while recognizing celebrations which foster ethnic
pride and enhance the profile of cultural  diversity  which  strengthens
the fabric of the communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  City  of Schenectady upon the occasion of hosting its 19th
Annual Little Italy StreetFest on Saturday, September 7, 2024, on  North
Jay Street; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Schenectady  Digital  History  Archive  contains  a
chronicle entitled,  "Electric  City  Immigrants,"  which  connotes  the
significant  contributions made by Italian Americans in the city's early
years; and
 
  WHEREAS, For many decades, the  State  of  New  York  has  held  the
distinction of having the highest population of Italian Americans in the
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Italian-American food and winemaking are based primarily on
the  culinary  traditions  of  Southern  Italian  immigrants, although a
significant number of Northern  Italian  immigrants  also  came  to  the
United  States and also influenced this style of cuisine to some extent;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year  after  Labor  Day,  the  Annual  Little  Italy
StreetFest  is held, which was established in 2006 and has been a staple
in the Schenectady community, with the help of The Little Italy Business
Association; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Little  Italy  StreetFest  attracts  renowned  local
establishments  such  as  Perreca's,  More  Perreca's,  Civitello's, and
Cornell's, which serve up Italian favorites such  as  pasta,  meatballs,
Italian  ice,  gelato, tomato pie, and arancini, bringing the flavors of
Italy to the heart of Schenectady; and
 
  WHEREAS, The city closes  off  North  Jay  Street  for  the  day  so
residents  can  enjoy  authentic  Italian  family fun, with a full music
lineup and numerous  children's  activities,  including  face  painting,
balloons, and improvisation classes with MopCo Theatre; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious  day provides an opportunity to celebrate
the significant contributions of Italian Americans so  that  all  people
may  know and appreciate Italian history and traditions, and of the role
Italian Americans have played in Schenectady, and will continue to play,
in our communities, State and Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  the  City  of Schenectady upon the occasion of hosting its 19th
Annual Little Italy StreetFest on September 7, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the members of the Little Italy Business  Association  in
the City of Schenectady.
