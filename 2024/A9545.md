 PROPERTY VALUE FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF SUCH VACANCY AND THREE PERCENT
 OF THE ASSESSED PROPERTY VALUE AFTER TWO YEARS OF SUCH VACANCY.
  (B) VACANCIES SHALL BE  AUTOMATICALLY  PRESUMED  EXCEPT  WHERE  A  TAX

 OF  AN  EXEMPTION  REQUEST  TO  THE  DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF SUCH CITY.
 EXEMPTIONS SHALL  REQUIRE  THE  SUBMISSION  OF  OTHER,  NON-TAX  FILING,

 THE  COMMISSIONER  OF  FINANCE  OF  SUCH  CITY BY SUCH MEANS AND IN SUCH
 MANNER AS OTHER TAXES THAT ARE NOW IMPOSED, ADMINISTERED, COLLECTED  AND
 ENFORCED BY SUCH COMMISSIONER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHARTER OR ADMINIS-
 TRATIVE  CODE  OF  ANY  SUCH CITY OR AS OTHERWISE MAY BE PROVIDED BY ANY

 PURPOSE  OF THE CREATION OF A TAX CREDIT FOR PROPERTIES WITHIN SUCH CITY
 THAT DO NOT PAY A VACANCY TAX. THE AMOUNT OF SUCH CREDIT SHALL BE DETER-
 MINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION WITHIN SUCH CITY AND SHALL BE  BASED
