  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2024, as Immigrant Heritage Month in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Generations  of  immigrants from every corner of the globe
have built our country's economy and created the unique character of our
State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Immigrants  continue  to  grow  businesses,  innovate,
strengthen our economy and create jobs in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Immigrants  have provided the United States of America and
New York State with unique social and cultural influence,  fundamentally
enriching the extraordinary character of each; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Immigrants  constitute  a  vital  segment  not only in our
State's community and economic affairs, but also our  State's  democracy
and civic discourse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Immigrants  comprise  more  than  a quarter of our State's
workforce  and  for  that  reason  the  care  and  well-being  of  these
individuals  is  not  only  a  priority but a necessity for the economic
health of this State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Immigrants  account  for  nearly  a  third  of  New  York's
economic  output  in metropolitan areas and produce more than a fifth of
New York's gross domestic product; and
 
  WHEREAS, Foreign-born students seeking educational opportunities  in
New York contribute billions of dollars to the State in their journey to
success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Immigrants have been tireless leaders not only in securing
their own  rights  and  access  to  equal  opportunity,  but  have  also
campaigned  to  create a fairer and more just society for all Americans;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Despite  these  countless  contributions,  the  role  of
immigrants  in  building  and  enriching  our Nation has frequently been
overlooked, undervalued and  often  disparaged  throughout  history  and
continuing to the present day; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness and
increased  recognition  of the contributions of immigrant communities at
the local, state and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim June 2024, as Immigrant
Heritage Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
 
York,  and  to  the  events  commemorating  Immigrant  Heritage  Month
throughout New York State.
