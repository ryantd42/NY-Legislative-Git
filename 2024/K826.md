great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sister Ann Sakac of Newburgh, New York, died on  Wednesday,

  WHEREAS,  Sister  Ann  Sakac distinguished herself in her profession
and by her  sincere  dedication  and  substantial  contribution  to  the
welfare of her community; and

of  humanity,  carried  over  into  all  fields of enterprise, including
charitable and civic endeavors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under her 32-year leadership at  the  college,  Sister  Ann
Sakac  oversaw  much  of  the  college's  expansion  from  a  fledgling
institution to a pillar of the community;  some  of  the  highlights  of
Sister  Ann Sakac's tenure as Mount president include the development of
the college's first master's degree program; a new residence hall called

development of the Mathematics, Science and Technology Center in Aquinas

  WHEREAS,  Under  her  leadership,  Montefiore  St.  Luke's  Cornwall

Windsor helped the college to develop and thrive in the 1970s and 1980s;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  her connections to generous local businesspersons

Library and Learning Center; The Kaplan Field; and more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Sister Ann Memorial Endowed Scholarship which supports
incoming students who have financial need and the academic  aptitude  to
succeed  at  the  college  was established in December 2023, thanks to a
 
gift from Penny Ducker, Class of 1973, serving as an  admirable  tribute
to the legacy of the former president; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  wish of Sister Ann Sakac's was for all Mount Saint Mary
students, past and present, to embody the ideals of  service,  spreading
the  importance and impact of such service far beyond the borders of the
college; and

endure the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory to all
she served and befriended; now, therefore, be it

community, and longest-serving president of Mount  Saint  Mary  College;
