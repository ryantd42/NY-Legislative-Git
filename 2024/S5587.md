 AGAINST  ANY LIABILITY ASSERTED AGAINST SUCH PERSON AND INCURRED BY SUCH
 PERSON IN ANY SUCH CAPACITY, OR ARISING OUT OF SUCH PERSON'S  STATUS  AS
 SUCH,  WHETHER  OR NOT THE CORPORATION WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO INDEMNIFY
 SUCH PERSON AGAINST SUCH LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECTION.
  (H) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS  SECTION,  REFERENCES  TO  "THE  CORPORATION"
 SHALL  INCLUDE,  IN ADDITION TO A CONSOLIDATED OR SURVIVING CORPORATION,
 ANY CONSTITUENT CORPORATION, INCLUDING ANY CONSTITUENT OF A CONSTITUENT,
 ABSORBED IN A CONSOLIDATION OR MERGER WHICH, IF ITS  SEPARATE  EXISTENCE

 DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR KEY PERSONS THAT ANY  PERSON  WHO  IS  OR  WAS  A
 DIRECTOR,  OFFICER  OR KEY PERSON OF SUCH CONSTITUENT CORPORATION, OR IS
 OR WAS SERVING AT THE REQUEST  OF  SUCH  CONSTITUENT  CORPORATION  AS  A

 CLAIM AROSE OR PROSECUTION WAS THREATENED OR INFORMATION  OR  INDICTMENT
 WAS FILED.
  (J)  FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION, A CORPORATION SHALL BE DEEMED TO
 HAVE REQUESTED A PERSON TO SERVE AN  EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT  PLAN  WHERE  THE
 PERFORMANCE  BY SUCH PERSON OF HER OR HIS DUTIES TO THE CORPORATION ALSO
 IMPOSES DUTIES ON, OR OTHERWISE INVOLVES SERVICES BY, SUCH PERSON TO THE

 follows:
 § 722. Indemnification  of directors [and], officers OR KEY PERSONS by a
  court.
  (a) Notwithstanding the failure of a corporation to provide indemnifi-
 cation, and despite any contrary resolution of the board, OF A COMMITTEE
 THEREOF or of the members in the specific case under section  [723]  721
 [(Payment  of indemnification other than by court award)] (AUTHORIZATION
 FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR KEY  PERSONS;  INSURANCE),

 ized under section [722 (Authorization for indemnification of  directors
 and officers), and paragraph (a) of section 723 (Payment of indemnifica-
 tion  other than by court award)] 721 (AUTHORIZATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION
 OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR KEY PERSONS; INSURANCE).  Application therefor
 shall be made on notice to the attorney general  and  may  be  made,  in
 every case, either:
  (1)  In  the  civil  action  or  proceeding in which the expenses were
 incurred or other amounts were paid, or
  (2) To the supreme court in a separate proceeding, in which  case  the
 application  shall set forth the disposition of any previous application
 made to any court for the same or similar  relief  and  also  reasonable
 cause  for the failure to make application for such relief in the action
 or proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts  were
 paid.
  (b)  The  application  shall be made in such manner and form as may be
 required by the applicable rules of court or, in the absence thereof, by
 direction of a court to which it is made. Such application shall be upon
 notice to the corporation. The court may  also  direct  that  notice  be
 given  at  the  expense of the corporation to the members and such other
 persons as it may designate in such manner as it may require.
  (c) Where indemnification is sought by judicial action, the court  may
 allow  a  person  such  reasonable  expenses, including attorneys' fees,
 during the pendency of the litigation as  are  necessary  in  connection
 with his defense therein, if the court shall find that the defendant has
 by  his  pleadings or during the course of the litigation raised genuine
 issues of fact or law.
  § 4. Section 725 of the not-for-profit corporation law  is  renumbered
 section 723.
  §  5.  The  section  heading and subdivision (a) of section 723 of the
 not-for-profit corporation law, as amended by chapter 368 of the laws of
 1987 and such section as renumbered  by  section  4  of  this  act,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  Other  provisions  affecting indemnification of directors [and], offi-
  cers AND KEY PERSONS.
  (a) All expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal  action  or
 proceeding  which  are advanced by the corporation under paragraph [(c)]
 (D) of section [723] 721 [(Payment  of  indemnification  other  than  by
 court  award)] (AUTHORIZATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS
 OR KEY PERSONS; INSURANCE) or allowed by a court under paragraph (c)  of
 section [724 (Indemnification of directors and officers by a court)] 722
 (INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR KEY PERSONS BY A COURT) shall
 be  repaid in case the person receiving such advancement or allowance is
 ultimately found, under the procedure set forth in this article, not  to
 be  entitled to indemnification or, where indemnification is granted, to
 S. 5587  5

 the extent the expenses so advanced by the corporation or allowed by the
 court exceed the indemnification to which he is entitled.
  §  6.  Section 720-a of the not-for-profit corporation law, as amended
 by chapter 445 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
 § 720-a. Liability of directors, officers, trustees and key persons.
  Except as provided in sections [seven hundred nineteen] 719 and [seven
 hundred twenty] 720 of this chapter, and except any action or proceeding
 brought by the attorney general or, in the case of a  charitable  trust,
 an  action  or  proceeding against a trustee brought by a beneficiary of
 such trust, no person serving without SALARY OR OTHER compensation as  a
 director,  officer, key person or trustee of a corporation, association,
 organization or trust described in section 501 (c)  (3)  of  the  United
 States  internal  revenue  code shall be liable to any person other than
 such corporation, association, organization or trust based solely on his
 or her conduct in the execution of such office  unless  the  conduct  of
 such director, officer, key person or trustee with respect to the person
 asserting  liability  constituted  gross  negligence  or was intended to
 cause the resulting harm to the person  asserting  such  liability.  For
 purposes  of this section, such a director, officer, key person or trus-
 tee shall not be considered compensated solely by reason of  payment  of
 his  or  her actual expenses incurred in attending meetings or otherwise
 in the execution of such office.
  § 7. The rights to indemnification that accrued prior to the effective
 date of this act shall be determined by the  not-for-profit  corporation
 law  as  then in effect,  unless the director, officer or key person
 elects to have those rights or obligations determined  by  the  not-for-
 profit corporation law as amended by this act.
  § 8. This act shall take effect on January 1, 2024.
