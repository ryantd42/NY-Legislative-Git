 AND NORMAL TO THE TRANSACTION.
  4. The superintendent of financial services shall adopt those rules or
 regulations as it considers appropriate to govern reverse mortgage loans
 made pursuant to this section. No reverse mortgage loan  shall  be  made
 unless  it  conforms  to the requirements of this section and such rules
 and regulations as the superintendent of financial  services  may  adopt
 [except  those  reverse  mortgage  loans  made  pursuant  to section two
 hundred eighty-a of this article]. A reverse mortgage loan made  by  any
 authorized  lender,  national  banking  association, federal savings and
 loan association or federal credit union in conformity  with  applicable
 federal  laws  and  regulations specifically regulating reverse mortgage
 loans shall be deemed to conform to the  requirements  of  this  section
 unless  such  reverse  mortgage  loan fails to conform to such rules and
 regulations as the superintendent of financial  services  has  expressly
 declared  to  be  neither  preempted by, nor otherwise inconsistent with
 such federal laws or  regulations.  Those  rules  or  regulations  shall
 include, but are not limited to, the form and contents of any disclosure
 statement,  with  the  exception of the counseling statement prepared by
 the New York state office for the aging pursuant to paragraph [(g)]  (F)
 of subdivision two of this section, that authorized lenders must provide

  5.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, the priority of
 the lien of a reverse mortgage, including the lien  for  all  principal,
 interest, fees, costs, shared appreciation and other charges assessed in
 connection  with  the reverse mortgage, shall date from the recording of
 the reverse mortgage irrespective of the date of any advance of  reverse
 mortgage  loan  proceeds or the date by which an authorized lender shall
 be entitled to shared appreciation or accrued but unpaid interest, fees,
 costs or other charges.
  6. Nothing in this section shall be  construed  to  limit,  impair  or
 otherwise  affect  the  priority under applicable law of any other mort-
 gage, deed of trust, encumbrance or lien which  was  recorded  or  filed
 prior to the effective date of this section.
  7.  The  sale  or  transfer  of the real property securing the reverse
 mortgage loan [to a person other than an original mortgagor  or  mortga-
 gors] shall result in the termination of the loan.
 A. 5877  6
 
  8.  [In  a  term reverse mortgage loan, the real property securing the
 reverse mortgage loan may be reappraised by an independent appraiser  at
 the end of the loan term. If the value of the real property has appreci-
 ated,  the  term  of the reverse mortgage may be extended or refinanced,
 however,  the  total  reverse  mortgage  loan amount may not exceed such
 amount or ratio as may be determined by the superintendent of  financial
 services. The refinancing of the reverse mortgage loan shall be provided
 by  the  original  authorized  lender  or by any other authorized lender
 designated by the mortgagee.
  9. The principal, including any accrued  but  unpaid  interest,  of  a
 reverse  mortgage  loan  agreement entered into pursuant to this section
 may be insured by the mortgagor. If such insurance is purchased from  or
 otherwise  provided by any agency of the state of New York the mortgagor
 shall be granted the right, for a term reverse mortgage loan,  to  refi-
 nance  or  extend  the  reverse  mortgage  loan  at the end of the term,
 subject to such rules or regulations as the superintendent of  financial
 services  may  adopt.  The  authorized  lender  shall have the option to
 choose between refinancing  or  extending  the  reverse  mortgage  loan.
 Subject  to  obtaining an adequate increase in the insurance and subject
 to such  rules  and  regulations  as  the  superintendent  of  financial
 services  may  adopt,  the  total reverse mortgage loan amount shall not
 exceed such amount or loan to value ratio as may be  determined  by  the
 superintendent  of  financial  services.  The refinancing of the reverse
 mortgage loan shall be provided by the original authorized lender or  by
 any other authorized lender designated by the mortgagee.
  10.  Any authorized lender offering reverse mortgage loans pursuant to
 this section shall also offer reverse mortgage loans pursuant to section
 two hundred eighty-a of this article. Subject to  this  section  in  the
 event  that an authorized lender makes reverse mortgage loans under this
 section then that lender must make an equal number of  reverse  mortgage
 loans  pursuant  to  section  two hundred eighty-a of this article. Such
 loans shall be made to individuals who meet the requirements promulgated
 in section two hundred eighty-a of this article provided that such indi-
 vidual seeking the loan would otherwise qualify and be approved for that
 loan. In the event that no  or  insufficient  applications  for  reverse
 mortgage  loans pursuant to section two hundred eighty-a of this article
 are made to a lender who has  previously  made  reverse  mortgage  loans
 pursuant  to  this  section  then there shall be no requirement for that
 lender to make a reverse mortgage loan pursuant to section  two  hundred
 eighty-a  of  this  article.  It shall also not be a requirement that an
 authorized lender make any reverse mortgage loan to any  individual  who
 would  not  qualify for such loan and/or would not otherwise be approved
 for such loan.
  11.] Nothing contained in this section, section six-h of  the  banking
 law or any other provision of law shall be construed to prohibit a bank-
 ing  organization  or  licensed  mortgage  banker from providing reverse
 mortgages to homeowners in this state under the federal housing adminis-
 tration's  home  equity  conversion  mortgage  insurance  demonstration
 program.

 in  a  format  approved by the commissioner [of taxation and finance] to
 enable recording officers to affirmatively  determine  when  a  mortgage
