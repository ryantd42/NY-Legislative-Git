 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  providing  additional  benefits  for certain retirement system members
  with credited service in excess of twenty-five years

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Subdivisions c and f of section 89-e of the retirement and
 social security law, as added by chapter 520 of the laws  of  1988,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  c.  Upon  completion  of  twenty-five  years  of such service and upon
 retirement, each such member shall receive  a  pension  which,  together
 with  an  annuity  which shall be the actuarial equivalent of [his] SUCH
 MEMBER'S accumulated contributions at the time of  [his]  SUCH  MEMBER'S
 retirement  and  an additional pension which is the actuarial equivalent
 of  the  [reserved-for-increased-take-home-pay]  RESERVE-FOR-INCREASED-
 TAKE-HOME-PAY  to  which  [he] SUCH MEMBER may then be entitled shall be
 sufficient to provide [him] SUCH  MEMBER  with  a  retirement  allowance

 MEMBER'S accumulated contributions at the time of  [his]  SUCH  MEMBER'S
 retirement  and  an additional pension which is the actuarial equivalent
 of the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay to which [he] SUCH MEMBER may
 then  be entitled shall be sufficient to provide [him] SUCH MEMBER  with
 a retirement allowance equal to one-half of [his]  SUCH  MEMBER'S  final
 average salary PLUS AN ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO ONE-SIX-
 TIETH  OF SUCH MEMBER'S FINAL AVERAGE SALARY FOR EACH YEAR OF CREDITABLE
 SERVICE IN EXCESS OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS  BUT  NOT  IN  EXCESS  OF  THIRTY
 YEARS.
  § 2. Subdivision c of section 604 of the retirement and social securi-
 ty  law, as added by chapter 520 of the laws of 1988, is amended to read
 as follows:
  c. The early  service  retirement  benefit  for  a  member  who  is  a
 correction  officer  of  the Westchester county correction department as
 defined in section eighty-nine-e of this  chapter  shall  be  a  pension
 equal  to  one-fiftieth  of final average salary times years of credited
 service at the completion  of  twenty-five  years  of  service  as  such
 correction [officer, but not exceeding one-half of his or her] OFFICER'S
 final  average  salary  PLUS AN ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO
 ONE-SIXTIETH OF SUCH MEMBER'S FINAL AVERAGE  SALARY  FOR  EACH  YEAR  OF
 CREDITED  SERVICE  IN  EXCESS  OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS BUT NOT IN EXCESS OF
 THIRTY YEARS.
  §  3.  All  past  service  costs  associated  with  implementing  the
 provisions  of  this act shall be borne by the county of Westchester and
 may be amortized over a period of ten years.
  § 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to the appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  apply  to  all
 members that retire on or after such date.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would modify the service retirement benefit for members of
 the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement  System  employed  by
 Westchester  County as correction officers. The modified service retire-
 ment benefit will  be  one-half  of  final  average  salary  (FAS)  upon
 completion  of  twenty-five  years of creditable service with additional
 sixtieths for each year of creditable service in excess  of  twenty-five
 years  but not in excess of thirty years. The current service retirement
 benefit is one-half of FAS upon completion of twenty-five years of cred-
 itable service.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $930,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of  Westchester County for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost  will  vary  as  the  billing
 rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $11.3 million which will
 be  borne  by  Westchester  County  as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1,  2024.  If  Westchester
 County  elects to amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for
 the first year including interest would be $1.44 million.
  These estimated costs are based on 821 affected  members  employed  by
 Westchester  County, with annual salary of approximately $103 million as
 of March 31, 2022.
