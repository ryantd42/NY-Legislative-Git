  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would add Article 14-C to the Retirement and Social Security
 Law, creating optional twenty-year plans covering, upon their  election,
 any  New York State (State) correction officers or other State employees
 engaged directly in correction officer duties.  The  retirement  benefit
 will  be  equal  to  fifty  percent of final average salary after twenty
 years of service. The legislature may further elect to provide for addi-
 tional sixtieths for service in excess  of  twenty  years.  All  service
 rendered as a State correction officer, a member or officer of the State
 Police,  a  paid  firefighter,  a  police  officer, or an officer of any
 organized fire department  or  police  force  will  be  creditable.  The
 retirement  benefit is not to exceed seventy-five percent of final aver-
 age salary.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase in the annual contributions of  the
 State  of New York of approximately $56 million for the twenty-year plan
 or $75 million for the twenty-year plan with  additional  sixtieths  for
 the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. In future years, these costs will
 vary  but  are  expected  to  average  3.2% and 4.5% of salary annually,
 respectively.
 A. 5013--A  4
 
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately  $735  million  for  the
 twenty-year  plan  or  $1.26 billion for the twenty-year plan with addi-
 tional sixtieths which will be borne by the State of New York as a  one-
 time  payment.  This estimate assumes that payment will be made on March
 1, 2025.
  These estimated costs are based on 16,999 affected members of the  New
 York  State  and  Local  Retirement  System employed by the State of New
 York, with annual salary of approximately $1.6 billion as of  March  31,
 2023.
  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  plan qualification issues: granting
 certain State employees engaged directly in correction  officer  duties,
 other  than State correction officers, service credit towards retirement
 in a twenty-year plan could jeopardize the governmental plan  status  of
 the  Retirement System ("the System") and its exemption from the Employ-
 ees Retirement Income Security Act. This development could result in the
 loss of qualified status, which would mean the  loss  of  tax  benefits.
 This  result  would  substantially impair the System's value to our more
 than one million participants.
  Prior to the enactment of this legislation, we recommend that a favor-
 able ruling be obtained from the IRS stating that these provisions would
 not harm the qualification status of the System. It  is  estimated  that
 the  costs  to obtain such a ruling would be $38,000 for the services of
 the IRS, and $1,000 per hour for legal consultants.
