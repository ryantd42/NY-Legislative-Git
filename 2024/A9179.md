 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  BENEDETTO  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Economic Development
 
 AN ACT to establish a moratorium  on  issuing  any  license,  permit  or
  registration  for  retail  dispensaries of cannabis until the cannabis
  control board reviews and closes businesses which are selling cannabis
  without a proper license or permit

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent. The legislature finds that there has
 been an increase in the number of unlicensed  "Smoke  Shops"  throughout
 the state, estimated to exceed 30,000, with approximately 1500 operating
 illegally  in New York City alone. These operations undermine the integ-
 rity of our local businesses. These establishments often operate outside
 the bounds of existing regulations, posing a  significant  challenge  to
 law  enforcement  and  disrupting  the business model that the state has
 been established for cannabis dispensaries draining the state of  impor-
 tant tax revenue.
  § 2. The cannabis control board shall not issue any license, permit or
 registration  for  retail  dispensaries  of  cannabis until the cannabis
 control board or any other authorized entity or law  enforcement  agency
 reviews and closes businesses which are selling cannabis without a prop-
 er license or permit issued by the office of cannabis management.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
