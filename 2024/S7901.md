 S. 7901  2

  THE COMMISSIONER OF  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  SHALL  NOT  MAINTAIN
 RECORDS  OF ANY PERSON WHO CHECKS "SKIP THIS QUESTION". FAILURE TO CHECK
 A BOX SHALL NOT IMPAIR THE VALIDITY OF AN APPLICATION,  AND  FAILURE  TO
 CHECK  "YES"  OR CHECKING "SKIP THIS QUESTION" SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO
 IMPLY  A  WISH NOT TO DONATE. IN THE CASE OF AN APPLICANT UNDER EIGHTEEN
 YEARS OF AGE, CHECKING "YES" SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE  CONSENT  TO  MAKE  AN
 ANATOMICAL  GIFT  OR  REGISTRATION IN THE DONATE LIFE REGISTRY. WHERE AN
 APPLICANT HAS PREVIOUSLY CONSENTED TO MAKE AN ANATOMICAL GIFT OR  REGIS-
 TERED  IN  THE  DONATE  LIFE  REGISTRY, CHECKING "SKIP THIS QUESTION" OR
 FAILING TO CHECK A BOX SHALL NOT IMPAIR THAT CONSENT OR REGISTRATION. IN
 ADDITION, THE COMMISSIONER  ALSO  SHALL  REQUIRE  THAT  SPACE  SHALL  BE
 PROVIDED ON THE APPLICATION SO THAT THE APPLICANT MAY REQUEST A NOTATION
 UPON SUCH LICENSE THAT HE OR SHE IS A VETERAN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED
 FORCES  AND SPACE SO THAT THE APPLICANT MAY REQUEST A NOTATION UPON SUCH
 LICENSE THAT HE OR SHE IS AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL.  IN  ADDITION,
 AN  APPLICANT  FOR  A  COMMERCIAL  DRIVER'S  LICENSE  WHO WILL OPERATE A
 COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE SHALL CERTIFY THAT  SUCH
 APPLICANT  MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS TO OPERATE A COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE,
 AS SET FORTH IN PUBLIC LAW 99-570, TITLE XII, AND TITLE 49 OF  THE  CODE
 OF  FEDERAL  REGULATIONS,  AND ALL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE UNITED
 STATES SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION UNDER THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS  TRANS-
 PORTATION  ACT.  IN  ADDITION,  AN  APPLICANT  FOR A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S
 LICENSE SHALL SUBMIT A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE AT SUCH INTERVALS AS REQUIRED
 BY THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT  OF  1999  AND  PART
 383.71(H)  OF  TITLE  49  OF THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS RELATING TO
 MEDICAL CERTIFICATION AND IN A MANNER PRESCRIBED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER.
 FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION  AND  SECTIONS FIVE HUNDRED THREE, FIVE
 HUNDRED TEN-A, AND FIVE HUNDRED TEN-AA OF THIS TITLE, THE TERMS "MEDICAL
 CERTIFICATE" AND "MEDICAL CERTIFICATION" SHALL MEAN A FORM SUBSTANTIALLY
 IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FORM SET FORTH IN PART 391.43(H) OF TITLE  49  OF
 THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS. UPON A DETERMINATION THAT THE HOLDER OF
 A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE HAS MADE ANY FALSE STATEMENT, WITH RESPECT
 TO  THE APPLICATION FOR SUCH LICENSE, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL REVOKE SUCH
 LICENSE.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 502 of the vehicle and traffic  law,  as
 added by section one of this act, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  Application  for license. Application for a driver's license shall
 be made to the commissioner. The fee prescribed by law may be  submitted
 with such application. The applicant shall furnish such proof of identi-
 ty, age, and fitness as may be required by the commissioner.  Acceptable
 proof of identity shall include, but not be limited to foreign passports
 (visa  stamps are not required), valid documentation issued by USCIS and
 consular identification documents. Eligibility for  a  driver's  license
 shall  not  be  conditioned  on  a  particular immigration status.  The
 commissioner may also  provide  that  the  application  procedure  shall
 include  the  taking  of  a  photo  image  or images of the applicant in
 accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the commissioner. In
 addition, the commissioner also shall require that the applicant provide
 his or her social security number where such applicant is a legal  immi-
 grant,  or  individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) or a letter
 or form from the  United  States  social  security  administration  that
 states  that  the  applicant is not eligible or submit a sworn statement
 under the penalty of perjury, stating that the applicant does not have a
 social security number of ITIN, and [shall] provide space on the  appli-
 cation  so  that  the applicant may register in the New York state organ
 and tissue donor registry under section forty-three hundred ten  of  the
 S. 7901  3
 
 public health law [with the following stated on the application in clear
 and conspicuous type:
  "You  must  fill out the following section: Would you like to be added
 to the Donate Life Registry? Check box for 'yes'  or  'skip  this  ques-
 tion'."
  The  commissioner  of  the  department  of  health  shall not maintain
 records of any person who checks "skip this question". Failure to  check
 a  box  shall  not impair the validity of an application, and failure to
 check "yes" or checking "skip this question" shall not be  construed  to
 imply  a  wish not to donate. In the case of an applicant under eighteen
 years of age, checking "yes" shall not constitute  consent  to  make  an
 anatomical  gift  or  registration  in the donate life registry. When an
 applicant has previously consented to make an anatomical gift or  regis-
 tered  in  the  donate  life  registry, checking "skip this question" or
 failing to check a box shall not impair that consent  or  registration].
 In  addition,  the  commissioner  also shall require that space shall be
 provided on the application so that the applicant may request a notation
 upon such license that he or she is a veteran of the United States armed
 forces and space so that the applicant may request a notation upon  such
 license  that he or she is an emergency medical personnel.  In addition,
 an applicant for a  commercial  driver's  license  who  will  operate  a
 commercial  motor vehicle in interstate commerce shall certify that such
 applicant meets the requirements to operate a commercial motor  vehicle,
 as  set  forth in public law 99-570, title XII, and title 49 of the code
 of federal regulations, and all regulations promulgated  by  the  United
 States  secretary of transportation under the hazardous materials trans-
 portation act. In addition,  an  applicant  for  a  commercial  driver's
 license shall submit a medical certificate at such intervals as required
 by  the  federal  motor  carrier safety improvement act of 1999 and Part
 383.71(h) of title 49 of the code of  federal  regulations  relating  to
 medical  certification  and  in a manner prescribed by the commissioner.
 For purposes of this section  and  sections  five  hundred  three,  five
 hundred ten-a, and five hundred ten-aa of this title, the terms "medical
 certificate" and "medical certification" shall mean a form substantially
 in  compliance  with the form set forth in Part 391.43(h) of title 49 of
 the code of federal regulations. Upon a determination that the holder of
 a commercial driver's license has made any false statement, with respect
 to the application for such license, the commissioner shall revoke  such
 license.
  §  3. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 6 of section 502 of the vehicle and
 traffic law, as amended by chapter 37 of the laws of 2019, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (a) A license issued pursuant to  subdivision  five  of  this  section
 shall  be valid until the expiration date contained thereon, unless such
 license is suspended, revoked or cancelled. Such license may be  renewed
 by  submission of an application for renewal, the fee prescribed by law,
 proofs of prior licensing, fitness and acceptable vision  prescribed  by
 the  commissioner,  the  applicant's  social security number or, in lieu
 thereof, with respect to an application for  a  non-commercial  driver's
 license  or  learner's  permit which does not meet federal standards for
 identification, an affidavit signed by such applicant that they have not
 been issued a social security number, OR INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICA-
 TION NUMBER (ITIN) OR A LETTER OR FORM FROM  THE  UNITED  STATES  SOCIAL
 SECURITY  ADMINISTRATION  THAT STATES THAT THE APPLICANT IS NOT ELIGIBLE
 OR SUBMIT A SWORN STATEMENT UNDER THE PENALTY OF PERJURY,  STATING  THAT
 THE  APPLICANT  DOES  NOT  HAVE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR ITIN, and if
 S. 7901  4
 
 required by the commissioner, a photo image of  the  applicant  in  such
 numbers  and  form  as the commissioner shall prescribe. In addition, an
 applicant for renewal of  a  license  containing  a  hazardous  material
 endorsement  shall  pass  an examination to retain such endorsement. The
 commissioner shall, with respect to the renewal of a hazardous materials
 endorsement,  comply  with  the  requirements  imposed  upon  states  by
 sections  383.141  and  1572.13 of title 49 of the code of federal regu-
 lations. A renewal of such license shall be issued by  the  commissioner
 upon  approval of such application, except that no such license shall be
 issued if its issuance would be  inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of
 section  five hundred sixteen of this title, and except that the commis-
 sioner may refuse to renew such license if the applicant is  the  holder
 of  a  currently  valid  or renewable license to drive issued by another
 state or foreign country unless the applicant surrenders such license.
  § 4. Subdivision 1 of section 504 of the vehicle and  traffic  law  is
 amended by adding a new paragraph (a-2) to read as follows:
  (A-2)  EVERY  LICENSE OR RENEWAL THEREOF ISSUED TO AN APPLICANT WHO IS
 AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL, UPON HIS OR HER REQUEST  AND  SUBMISSION
 OF  PROOF  AS  SET  FORTH HEREIN, CONTAIN A DISTINGUISHING MARK, IN SUCH
 FORM AS THE COMMISSIONER SHALL DETERMINE, INDICATING THAT HE OR  SHE  IS
 AN  EMERGENCY  MEDICAL  PERSONNEL. SUCH PROOF SHALL CONSIST OF ANY PROOF
 SATISFACTORY TO THE COMMISSIONER. THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  NOT  REQUIRE
 FEES  FOR  THE  ISSUANCE OF SUCH LICENSES OR RENEWALS THEREOF TO PERSONS
 REQUESTING AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL NOTATION  WHICH  IS  DIFFERENT
 FROM FEES OTHERWISE REQUIRED.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the one hundred twentieth day after
 it  shall have become a law; provided, however, that section two of this
 act shall take effect October 3, 2025.
