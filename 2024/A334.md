 AN ACT to amend the  workers'  compensation  law,  in  relation  to  the
  provision of prescription medicine to workers' compensation claimants
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph 5 of subdivision (i) of section 13 of  the  work-
 ers'  compensation  law,  as  added by chapter 6 of the laws of 2007, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if an employ-
 er or carrier has contracted with a pharmacy to provide prescribed medi-
 cine to claimants, then such employer or carrier may [require] ENCOURAGE
 claimants to obtain all prescribed  medicines  from  the  pharmacy  with
 which  it  has  contracted[, except if a medical emergency occurs and it
 would  not  be  reasonably  possible  to  obtain  immediately  required
 prescribed medicine from the pharmacy with which the employer or carrier
 has  a  contract].  An  employer  or  carrier that [requires] ENCOURAGES
 claimants to obtain prescribed medicines from a pharmacy with  which  it
 has  a contract must notify claimants of the pharmacy or pharmacies with
 which it has a contract, the locations and addresses of the pharmacy  or
 pharmacies,  if  applicable,  how  to  initially  fill  and  refill
 prescriptions through the mail, internet, telephone or other means,  and
 any  other required information that must be supplied to the pharmacy or
 pharmacies. [If the pharmacy or pharmacies with which  the  employer  or
 carrier  contracts does not offer mail order service and does not have a
 physical location within a reasonable distance  from  the  claimant,  as
 defined  by  regulation of the board, the claimant may obtain prescribed
 medicines at the pharmacy or pharmacies of his or  her  choice  and  the
 employer  or  carrier will be liable for such charges in accordance with
 the fee schedule prescribed in  section  thirteen-o  of  this  chapter.]
