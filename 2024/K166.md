Assembly Resolution No. 166
 
BY: M. of A. McGowan
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 10, 2023, as Bagpipe Day in the State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body takes great pleasure in celebrating
those musical instruments of historic and  artistic  significance  which
have  contributed  to the cultural enrichment of our communities, Nation
and across the globe; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 10, 2023, as Bagpipe
Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
International Bagpipe Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  it  was  co-founded  by  the  International Bagpipe
Organization and the Bagpipe Society in 2012, International Bagpipe  Day
is  held  each  year  on March 10th to bring awareness of the instrument
which can be traced back to the most ancient civilizations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dating back to 400 B.C. the  bagpipe  is  thought  to  have
originated  in  Egypt, with the first players known as Pipers of Thebes;
in the early part of the second millennium, clear evidence  of  bagpipes
began to appear frequently in Western European art and iconography; they
were also popular subjects for carvers of wooden choir stalls throughout
Europe in the late 15th Century and early 16th Century; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  distinct  and unique musical instrument also holds a
special place in certain parts of Europe, such as Scotland and  Ireland;
and
 
  WHEREAS, A bagpipe is a type of woodwind instrument that consists of
several  parts  including the air supply blowpipe, the bag, the chanter,
the chanter reed, and the drone or drones; the  chanter  is  the  melody
pipe  that  can  be  played  by  the  piper, whereas the drone or drones
provide a constant note; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bagpipes have nine notes, but there are no sharps or  flats
so  there is no need for a key signature; the sound made by just one set
of bagpipes  equals  between  115  and  121  decibels,  therefore,  many
bagpipers wear earplugs to avoid going deaf from their music; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International  Bagpipe  Day was co-founded by Andy Letcher
and Cassandre Balosso-Bardin with the International Bagpipe Organization
and the Bagpipe Society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1986, the Bagpipe Society has been actively  involved
in  bringing  together  new  bagpipe  players  in  order to preserve the
history and practice of bagpipes; later, a conference was  organized  to
promote the diversity of bagpipes to a wider audience; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The First International Bagpipe Conference, which gathered
musicians  and  instrument  makers  from  all  over  Europe,  launched
 
International  Bagpipe  Day  worldwide;  thousands  of pipers around the
world now celebrate the day every year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bagpipe  Day  is  a perfect opportunity for people to read
about the history of this ancient instrument and its 130 different types
found throughout the world; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 10, 2023, as Bagpipe
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
