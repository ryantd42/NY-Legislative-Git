 AN ACT establishing a New York State Sound Basic Education Commission to
  study current educational needs and recommend  a  new  foundation  aid
  formula  which  will  provide  all  students in the state a meaningful
  opportunity for a sound basic education in a  cost  efficient  manner;
  and making an appropriation therefor
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. Article XI, section 1 of the New York
 state constitution guarantees all students in the state of  New  York  a
 meaningful  opportunity for a sound basic education. The legislature and
 the regents have enacted laws, regulations and standards that set  forth
 the  goals  and  educational practices that are necessary to provide all
 students with a meaningful opportunity  for  a  sound  basic  education.
 Specifically,  in 2007, the legislature adopted a foundation aid formula
 in response to the decision of the Court  of  Appeals  in  CAMPAIGN  FOR
 FISCAL  EQUITY  (CFE) V. STATE OF NEW YORK that was calculated to appro-
 priate sufficient  funding,  on  an  equitable  basis,  to  provide  all
 students  in the state a meaningful opportunity for a sound basic educa-
 tion.
  Because educational needs, standards, and practices and student  demo-
 graphics have changed substantially over the past sixteen years, partic-
 ularly  in  light  of  the  radical educational disruption caused by the
 pandemic, the legislature finds that it is necessary and appropriate  to
 establish a standing sound basic education commission to analyze current
 educational  needs and to recommend to the governor, the legislature and
 the regents, a new foundation aid formula that will  provide  sufficient
 funding,  distributed in an equitable manner, to provide all students in
 the state a meaningful opportunity for a sound basic  education,  effec-
 tive  for  the 2024-2025 school year. Thereafter, in order to assess the

 workings of the new formula and account for changing educational  needs,
 the commission will monitor the implementation of the new foundation aid
 formula and provide recommendations to the governor, the legislature and
 the  regents,  every two years thereafter regarding (a) revisions to the
 foundation aid formula that may be necessary to ensure that every school
 has the resources necessary for providing the opportunity  for  a  sound
 basic education in a cost efficient manner; and (b) accountability meas-
 ures needed to ensure that the state's system of education finance actu-
 ally  provides  a  meaningful opportunity for a sound basic education to
 all students.
  § 2.  Establishment of commission. 1. There is  hereby  established  a

 system  of  education finance actually provides a meaningful opportunity
 for a sound basic education to all students; and
