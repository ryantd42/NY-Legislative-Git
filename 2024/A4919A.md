 AN ACT establishing a New York State Sound Basic Education Commission to
  study current educational needs and recommend  a  new  foundation  aid
  formula  which  will  provide  all  students in the state a meaningful
  opportunity for a sound basic education in a  cost  efficient  manner;
  and making an appropriation therefor
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. Article XI, section 1 of the New York
 state constitution guarantees all students in the state of  New  York  a
 meaningful  opportunity for a sound basic education. The legislature and
 the regents have enacted laws, regulations and standards that set  forth
 the  goals  and  educational practices that are necessary to provide all
 students with a meaningful opportunity  for  a  sound  basic  education.
 Specifically,  in 2007, the legislature adopted a foundation aid formula
 in response to the decision of the Court  of  Appeals  in  CAMPAIGN  FOR
 FISCAL  EQUITY  (CFE) V. STATE OF NEW YORK that was calculated to appro-
 priate sufficient  funding,  on  an  equitable  basis,  to  provide  all
 students  in the state a meaningful opportunity for a sound basic educa-
 tion.
  Because educational needs, standards, and practices and student  demo-
 graphics have changed substantially since 2007, particularly in light of
 the  radical educational disruption caused by the pandemic, the legisla-
 ture finds that it is necessary and appropriate to establish a  standing
 sound  basic  education  commission to analyze current educational needs
 and to recommend to the governor, the legislature and the regents, a new

 foundation aid formula that will provide sufficient funding, distributed
 in an equitable manner, to provide all students in the state a  meaning-
 ful opportunity for a sound basic education, effective for the 2025-2026
 school  year.  Thereafter,  in  order  to assess the workings of the new
 formula and account for changing educational needs, the commission  will
 monitor the implementation of the new foundation aid formula and provide
 recommendations  to the governor, the legislature and the regents, every
 two years thereafter regarding  (a)  revisions  to  the  foundation  aid
 formula  that  may  be  necessary  to  ensure  that every school has the
 resources necessary for providing the  opportunity  for  a  sound  basic
 education  in  a  cost efficient manner; and (b) accountability measures
 needed to ensure that the state's system of education  finance  actually
 provides  a  meaningful  opportunity  for a sound basic education to all
 students.
  § 2.  Establishment of commission. 1. There is  hereby  established  a
 standing New York state sound basic education commission comprised of 15

 state's constitution, laws and regulations.
