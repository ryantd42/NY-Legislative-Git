  after 60 years of dedicated service to the Clayville
  Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  The firefighters of New York State are renowned throughout
the Nation; their  reputation  is  synonymous  with  excellence  in  the
arduous field of fire protection and prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighters  exemplify  the power of human compassion and
the strength of the American spirit through actions of the  most  heroic
magnitude;  their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  commend
Firefighter  Richard  Williams  upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition after 60 years of dedicated service to the Clayville
Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters and fire  departments  not  only  provide  the
critical  service of fire protection but also engage in other activities
of great benefit and importance to the communities they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout his tenure of service, Richard  "Dick"  Williams
has  continually  demonstrated  a  high  knowledge  and understanding of
leadership, teamwork, responsiveness, and care for his community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over  his  extensive  career  of  volunteer  fire  service,
Richard  Williams  has served the Village of Clayville, Sauquoit Valley,
and the Town of Paris, and has also served in  the  Oneida  County  Fire

  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Richard Williams is one such firefighter; throughout 60 years of devoted
service, he heroically performed, above and beyond  the  call  of  duty,
those  responsibilities  which  define the task of fire protection; now,
therefore, be it

commend  Firefighter  Richard  Williams  for  60  years of distinguished
service to Clayville Fire Department; and be it further
