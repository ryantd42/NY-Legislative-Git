 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  §  594-A.  RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS. (1) DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES
 OF THIS SECTION:
  (A) "WITHOUT FAULT" MEANS THE CLAIMANT DID NOT,  WITH  THE  INTENT  TO

 OMIT INFORMATION, WHICH DIRECTLY  RESULTED  IN  THE  DEPARTMENT  ISSUING
 BENEFITS TO WHICH THE CLAIMANT KNEW THEY WERE NOT ENTITLED;
  (B)  "FINAL  DETERMINATION" MEANS THIRTY DAYS AFTER APPEAL RIGHTS HAVE
 BEEN EXHAUSTED OR ABANDONED.
  (C) "WILLFUL MISREPRESENTATION" OR "WILLFUL FALSE STATEMENT" MEANS  AN
 INTENTIONAL,  KNOWING,  OR  DELIBERATELY  FALSE  REPRESENTATION FROM THE
 CLAIMANT TO THE DEPARTMENT, MADE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN UNEMPLOYMENT  INSUR-
 ANCE BENEFITS. "KNOWING" FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PARAGRAPH MEANS HAVING
 ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE.
  (2)  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF SECTION FIVE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR
 OF THIS TITLE TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIMANT WHO  HAS  RECEIVED  BENEFITS

 A. 8928--C  2
 
 TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY, TO WHICH THEY WERE NOT ENTITLED SHALL NOT BE HELD
 LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNTS OVERPAID  PROVIDED  THAT  ALL  OF  THE  FOLLOWING
 CONDITIONS EXIST:
  (A)  SUCH  OVERPAYMENT  WAS  NOT  DUE  TO A WILLFUL FALSE STATEMENT OR
 MISREPRESENTATION;
  (B) SUCH OVERPAYMENT WAS RECEIVED WITHOUT FAULT ON  THE  PART  OF  THE
 CLAIMANT; AND
  (C)  THE RECOVERY OF SUCH OVERPAYMENT WOULD BE AGAINST EQUITY AND GOOD
 CONSCIENCE.
  (3) WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OVERPAYMENT WAS RECEIVED WITHOUT FAULT
 ON THE PART OF THE CLAIMANT, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL CONSIDER THE FOLLOW-
 ING FACTORS:
  (A) THE NATURE AND CAUSE OF SUCH OVERPAYMENT AND THE CAPACITY  OF  THE
 CLAIMANT TO RECOGNIZE THE ERROR RESULTING IN SUCH OVERPAYMENT;
  (B)  WHETHER  THE  CLAIMANT  KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT
 SUCH CLAIMANT WAS NOT LAWFULLY ENTITLED TO RECEIVE SUCH BENEFITS;
  (C) WHETHER THE BENEFITS WERE RECEIVED  OR  RETAINED  BECAUSE  OF  THE
 CLAIMANT'S  GOOD  FAITH  RELIANCE  ON  AN ADMINISTRATIVE OR DEPARTMENTAL
 ERROR; AND
  (D) WHETHER THE CLAIMANT WILLFULLY REPORTED OR FAILED TO REPORT INFOR-
 MATION WHICH RESULTED IN SUCH OVERPAYMENT.
  (4) (A) THERE SHALL BE A PRESUMPTION  THAT  THE  CLAIMANT  IS  WITHOUT
 FAULT IF:
  (I) THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED CONFLICTING, CHANGING, OR CONFUSING INFOR-
 MATION OR INSTRUCTIONS;
  (II)  THE  DEPARTMENT TOOK MORE THAN SIX MONTHS TO IMPLEMENT A FEDERAL
 LAW REGARDING PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY FROM CLAIMANTS;
  (III) THE CLAIMANT WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE  DEPARTMENT  DESPITE  THEIR
 BEST  EFFORTS TO INQUIRE OR CLARIFY INFORMATION THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDED TO
 PROVIDE DUE TO LANGUAGE,  EDUCATION,  LITERACY,  DISABILITY  OR  SIMILAR
 BARRIERS;
  (IV) THE CLAIMANT WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT'S NOTICES OR
 DIRECTIVES  DUE  TO  LANGUAGE,  EDUCATION, LITERACY, DISABILITY OR OTHER
 SIMILAR BARRIERS;
  (V) THE CLAIMANT CHOSE A REASON FOR SEPARATION WHICH IS LEGALLY INCOR-
 RECT, THOUGH REASONABLE FOR THE CLAIMANT  TO  HAVE  SELECTED  UNDER  THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES; OR
  (VI)  THE  CLAIMANT  HAD  ASSISTANCE IN FILING A CLAIM, CERTIFYING, OR
 OTHERWISE RESPONDING TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CLAIMANT'S ASSISTANT  DID
 NOT CONFIRM REQUIRED INFORMATION WITH THE CLAIMANT OR MISUNDERSTOOD SUCH
 INFORMATION  PROVIDED  BY THE CLAIMANT, RESULTING IN INACCURATE INFORMA-
 TION BEING SUBMITTED WITHOUT THE CLAIMANT'S KNOWLEDGE.
  (B) THERE SHALL BE A PRESUMPTION THAT THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS IS WITH-
 OUT FAULT IF THE OVERPAYMENT WAS DUE TO AGENCY ERROR OR MISTAKE  OR  THE
 EMPLOYER  PROVIDED  INCORRECT  OR  UNTIMELY  INFORMATION.  RECEIPT  OR
 POSSESSION OF THE CLAIMANTS' UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE HANDBOOK  SHALL  NOT
 CREATE  A  PRESUMPTION THAT THE CLAIMANT WAS ON NOTICE OF THE HANDBOOK'S
 CONTENTS NOR SHALL RECEIPT OR POSSESSION OF THE HANDBOOK BE USED AGAINST
 THE CLAIMANT ON POINTS OF FACT OR LAW.
  (5) RECOVERY OF ANY OVERPAYMENT  WOULD  BE  AGAINST  EQUITY  AND  GOOD
 CONSCIENCE IF:
  (A)  RECOVERY  WOULD  CAUSE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP TO THE PERSON FROM WHOM
 RECOVERY IS SOUGHT;
  (B) THE RECIPIENT OF THE OVERPAYMENT CAN  SHOW,  REGARDLESS  OF  THEIR
 FINANCIAL  SITUATION,  THAT  REPAYMENT  WOULD CAUSE THEM TO RELINQUISH A

  § 2. Subdivision 4 of section 597 of the labor law is REPEALED.
  §  3.  Paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of section 600 of the labor law,
 as amended by section 19 of part O of chapter 57 of the laws of 2013, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (c) If, at the time benefits are payable, it has not been  established

 pay, annuity or other payment, benefits due  shall  be  paid  without  a

 as provided in [subdivisions] SUBDIVISION three [and  four]  of  section
 five  hundred ninety-seven with respect to retroactive payment of remun-
 eration.

 ment of labor shall provide claimants who have  previously  been  denied
