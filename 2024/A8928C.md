 RECEIVE BENEFITS, INTENTIONALLY SUPPLY FALSE  INFORMATION  OR  KNOWINGLY
 OMIT  INFORMATION,  WHICH  DIRECTLY  RESULTED  IN THE DEPARTMENT ISSUING
 BENEFITS TO WHICH THE CLAIMANT KNEW THEY WERE NOT ENTITLED;
  (B) "FINAL DETERMINATION" MEANS THIRTY DAYS AFTER APPEAL  RIGHTS  HAVE
 BEEN EXHAUSTED OR ABANDONED.
  (C) "WILLFUL" MEANS INTENTIONAL AND DELIBERATE.
  (2)  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF SECTION FIVE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR
 OF THIS TITLE TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIMANT WHO  HAS  RECEIVED  BENEFITS

 TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY, TO WHICH THEY WERE NOT ENTITLED SHALL NOT BE HELD
 LIABLE FOR THE AMOUNTS OVERPAID  PROVIDED  THAT  ALL  OF  THE  FOLLOWING
 CONDITIONS EXIST:

  (3) WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER AN OVERPAYMENT WAS RECEIVED WITHOUT FAULT
 ON THE PART OF THE CLAIMANT, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL CONSIDER THE FOLLOW-
 ING FACTORS:
  (A)  THE  NATURE AND CAUSE OF SUCH OVERPAYMENT AND THE CAPACITY OF THE
 CLAIMANT TO RECOGNIZE THE ERROR RESULTING IN SUCH OVERPAYMENT;
  (B) WHETHER THE CLAIMANT KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT  HE
 OR SHE WAS NOT LAWFULLY ENTITLED TO RECEIVE SUCH BENEFITS;
  (C)  WHETHER  THE  BENEFITS  WERE  RECEIVED OR RETAINED BECAUSE OF THE
 CLAIMANT'S GOOD FAITH RELIANCE  ON  AN  ADMINISTRATIVE  OR  DEPARTMENTAL
 ERROR; AND
  (D) WHETHER THE CLAIMANT WILLFULLY REPORTED OR FAILED TO REPORT INFOR-
 MATION WHICH RESULTED IN SUCH OVERPAYMENT.
  (4)  (A)  THERE  SHALL  BE  A PRESUMPTION THAT THE CLAIMANT IS WITHOUT
 FAULT IF:
  (I) THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED CONFLICTING, CHANGING, OR CONFUSING INFOR-
 MATION OR INSTRUCTIONS;
  (II) THE DEPARTMENT TOOK MORE THAN SIX MONTHS TO IMPLEMENT  A  FEDERAL
 LAW REGARDING PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY FROM CLAIMANTS;
  (III)  THE  CLAIMANT  WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE DEPARTMENT DESPITE THEIR
 BEST EFFORTS TO INQUIRE OR CLARIFY INFORMATION THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDED  TO
 PROVIDE  DUE  TO  LANGUAGE,  EDUCATION,  LITERACY, DISABILITY OR SIMILAR
 BARRIERS;
  (IV) THE CLAIMANT WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT'S NOTICES OR
 DIRECTIVES DUE TO LANGUAGE, EDUCATION,  LITERACY,  DISABILITY  OR  OTHER
 SIMILAR BARRIERS;
  (V) THE CLAIMANT CHOSE A REASON FOR SEPARATION WHICH IS LEGALLY INCOR-
 RECT,  THOUGH  REASONABLE  FOR  THE  CLAIMANT TO HAVE SELECTED UNDER THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES; OR
  (VI) THE CLAIMANT HAD ASSISTANCE IN FILING  A  CLAIM,  CERTIFYING,  OR
 OTHERWISE  RESPONDING TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CLAIMANT'S ASSISTANT DID
 NOT CONFIRM REQUIRED INFORMATION WITH THE CLAIMANT OR MISUNDERSTOOD SUCH

 TION BEING SUBMITTED WITHOUT THE CLAIMANT'S KNOWLEDGE.
  (B) THERE SHALL BE A PRESUMPTION THAT THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS IS WITH-
 OUT  FAULT  IF THE OVERPAYMENT WAS DUE TO AGENCY ERROR OR MISTAKE OR THE
 EMPLOYER  PROVIDED  INCORRECT  OR  UNTIMELY  INFORMATION.  RECEIPT  OR
 POSSESSION  OF  THE CLAIMANTS' UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE HANDBOOK SHALL NOT
 CREATE A PRESUMPTION THAT THE CLAIMANT WAS ON NOTICE OF  THE  HANDBOOK'S
 CONTENTS NOR SHALL RECEIPT OR POSSESSION OF THE HANDBOOK BE USED AGAINST
 THE CLAIMANT ON POINTS OF FACT OR LAW.
  (5)  RECOVERY  OF  ANY  OVERPAYMENT  WOULD  BE AGAINST EQUITY AND GOOD
 CONSCIENCE IF:
  (A) RECOVERY WOULD CAUSE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP TO THE  PERSON  FROM  WHOM
 RECOVERY IS SOUGHT;
  (B)  THE  RECIPIENT  OF  THE OVERPAYMENT CAN SHOW, REGARDLESS OF THEIR
 FINANCIAL SITUATION, THAT REPAYMENT WOULD CAUSE  THEM  TO  RELINQUISH  A
