  Section  1.  The labor law is amended by adding a new section 594-a to

  § 594-A. RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS. (1) NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  PROVISION
 OF  SECTION  FIVE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR OF THIS TITLE TO THE CONTRARY, ANY

  (A)  SUCH  OVERPAYMENT  WAS NOT DUE TO FRAUD OR DUE TO A WILLFUL FALSE
 STATEMENT OR MISREPRESENTATION;
  (B) SUCH OVERPAYMENT WAS RECEIVED WITHOUT FAULT ON  THE  PART  OF  THE
 CLAIMANT; AND
  (C)  THE RECOVERY OF SUCH OVERPAYMENT WOULD BE AGAINST EQUITY AND GOOD
 CONSCIENCE.

 OF  THIS  TITLE  TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIMANT WHO HAS RECEIVED BENEFITS
 PAID UNDER ANY FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT AND EXTENDED  UNEMPLOYMENT  PROGRAMS

  (B) WHETHER THE CLAIMANT KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT  HE
 OR SHE WAS NOT LAWFULLY ENTITLED TO RECEIVE SUCH BENEFITS;
  (C)  WHETHER  THE  BENEFITS  WERE  RECEIVED OR RETAINED BECAUSE OF THE
 CLAIMANT'S GOOD FAITH RELIANCE  ON  AN  ADMINISTRATIVE  OR  DEPARTMENTAL
 ERROR; AND
  (D)  WHETHER  THE  CLAIMANT  NEGLIGENTLY  REPORTED OR FAILED TO REPORT
 INFORMATION WHICH RESULTED IN SUCH OVERPAYMENT.
  (4) WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER THE RECOVERY OF ANY OVERPAYMENT WOULD  BE
 AGAINST  EQUITY  AND GOOD CONSCIENCE, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL CONSIDER IF
 SUCH REPAYMENT WOULD IMPOSE EXTRAORDINARY HARDSHIP, INCLUDING  FINANCIAL
 HARDSHIP, ON THE CLAIMANT OR THE CLAIMANT'S HOUSEHOLD.
  (5) (A) IN THE EVENT THAT A NEW DETERMINATION BY THE COMMISSIONER OR A
 DECISION  BY  A  REFEREE,  THE  APPEAL  BOARD,  OR  A COURT RESULTS IN A
 DECREASE OR DENIAL OF ANY BENEFITS PREVIOUSLY ALLOWED, OR AT  ANY  OTHER
 TIME IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT AN OVERPAYMENT HAS OCCURRED, THE CLAIM-
 ANT  SHALL  BE  NOTIFIED  IN  WRITING, BY MAIL OR ELECTRONICALLY, WITHIN
 FIFTEEN DAYS OF SUCH DETERMINATION OR DECISION OF HIS OR  HER  RIGHT  TO
 APPEAL  SUCH DETERMINATION OR DECISION AND TO REQUEST A WAIVER OF RECOV-
 ERY OF SUCH OVERPAYMENT. SUCH NOTICE SHALL INCLUDE,  BUT  SHALL  NOT  BE

  (I)  THE  TOTAL AMOUNT OF SUCH OVERPAYMENT AND THE CAUSE OF SUCH OVER-
 PAYMENT;

 CONSISTENT WITH CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISIONS ONE AND TWO OF THIS
 SECTION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CLAIMANT SHALL BE HELD LIABLE  FOR  ANY
 AMOUNTS  OVERPAID.  ANY  CLAIMANT  WHO IS FOUND NOT TO BE LIABLE FOR ANY
 AMOUNTS OVERPAID SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE  A  FULL  WAIVER  OF  SUCH
 OVERPAYMENT  AND  ANY  PENALTIES AND/OR INTEREST INCURRED AS A RESULT OF
 SUCH OVERPAYMENT.
  (6) (A) UPON THE DENIAL OF ANY  WAIVER  REQUEST,  OR  UPON  ANY  OTHER
 DETERMINATION BY THE COMMISSIONER OR A DECISION BY A REFEREE, THE APPEAL
 BOARD,  OR A COURT THAT A CLAIMANT SHALL BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY OVERPAY-
 MENT, THE CLAIMANT SHALL BE NOTIFIED IN WRITING, BY  MAIL  OR  ELECTRON-
 ICALLY,  WITHIN  FIFTEEN  DAYS  OF SUCH DETERMINATION OR DECISION.  SUCH
 NOTICE SHALL SET FORTH THE REASON FOR SUCH DENIAL,  IF  APPLICABLE,  AND
 HIS OR HER RIGHT TO REQUEST AN ADJUSTMENT TO HIS OR HER REPAYMENT SCHED-
 ULE.
  (B)  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  GRANT  AN  ADJUSTMENT TO THE CLAIMANT'S
 REPAYMENT SCHEDULE IF AT ANY TIME THE CLAIMANT IS  ABLE  TO  DEMONSTRATE
 THAT  THERE HAS BEEN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN HIS OR HER FINANCIAL CONDITION
