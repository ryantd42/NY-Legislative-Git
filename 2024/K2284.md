  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 7, 2024, as  Duchenne  Muscular  Dystrophy
  Awareness Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim September 7, 2024, as
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Awareness Day in the State of New  York,  in
conjunction with World Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Duchenne  muscular  dystrophy  is  the  most  common fatal
genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood, affecting approximately one  in
every  5,000  male  births (about 20,000 new cases each year worldwide);
since the Duchenne gene is  found  on  the  X-chromosome,  it  primarily
affects boys, however, it occurs across all races and cultures; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Duchenne muscular dystrophy results in progressive loss of
strength and is caused by a  mutation  in  the  gene  that  encodes  for
dystrophin;  since  dystrophin  is  absent,  the muscle cells are easily
damaged; and
 
  WHEREAS, Progressive muscle weakness caused by the  condition  leads
to  serious  medical problems, particularly issues relating to the heart
and lungs; young men with this debilitating disease typically live  into
their late twenties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  ability  to  affect  anyone,  Duchenne muscular
dystrophy can be passed from parent to child, but approximately  35%  of
cases occur because of a random spontaneous mutation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  there  are  now  seven  FDA  approved  medical
treatments that may help slow its progression,  there  is  currently  no
cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Awareness Day is meant to
highlight the importance of identifying and communicating early signs of
this  genetic  disorder  and  to  promote  the  message  that the key to
managing this disease is early diagnosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, As one of the first states to add Duchenne to  its  newborn
screening  panel,  New  York continues to be a leader in early diagnosis
and treatment of this disease; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim September 7, 2024, as
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Awareness Day in the State of New York;  and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
