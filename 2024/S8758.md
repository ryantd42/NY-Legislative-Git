 existing charter school whose expansion of grade level, pursuant to this
 article, is approved by their charter entity, if the appeal results in a
 determination  in  favor of the charter school, the city school district
 shall pay the charter school an amount attributable to the  grade  level
 expansion  or  the  formation of the new charter school that is equal to
