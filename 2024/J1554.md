  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 5, 2024, as World Environment Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June  5,  2024,  as  World
Environment Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Environment Day takes place every year on June 5th;
it is the United Nations' most important  day  for  promoting  worldwide
awareness  and  action  for  the protection of our environment; since it
began in 1974, it has grown  to  be  the  largest  global  platform  for
environmental public outreach and is celebrated by millions of people in
more than 100 countries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Environment  Day  is  the  "people's day" for doing
something to take care of the Earth; that  "something"  can  be  focused
locally,  nationally  or  globally; it can be a solo action or involve a
crowd; everyone is free to choose; and
 
  WHEREAS, Scientists, non-governmental organizations,  business,  and
governments  worldwide  now  are looking at natural system processes and
emerging green  technologies  to  restore  the  world's  ecosystems  and
forests,  conserve and rebuild soils, improve farming practices, restore
wildlife populations and rid the world's oceans of plastics; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Natural  processes  including  reforestation  and  soil
conservation  can  store  massive  amounts  of  carbon  while  restoring
biodiversity, clean water and air and  rebalancing  ecological  systems;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious environmental issue, and more  must  be  done  to  increase
activity  at  the  local, state, national and international levels; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim June 5, 2024, as World
Environment Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
