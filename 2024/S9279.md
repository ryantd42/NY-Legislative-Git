 SURVIVING DOMESTIC PARTNER AS DEFINED IN SECTION FOUR OF THIS CHAPTER, A
 DEPENDENT CHILD OR CHILDREN, OR ANY OTHER PERSON  ENTITLED  TO  A  DEATH

 permit the deposit of compensation payments to be split between multiple

 the maximum number of partial deposits allowed.

 TWENTY PERCENT OF THE COMPENSATION  DUE  PER  PAY  PERIOD,  WHICH  SHALL
 ACCRUE  FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE INJURED WORKER OR SUCH WORKER'S SURVIVING
 SPOUSE OR  DEPENDENTS,  AND  AN  ADDITIONAL  PENALTY  OF  THREE  HUNDRED
 DOLLARS. SUCH PENALTIES SHALL BE PAID TO SUCH ELIGIBLE PERSON.
  (II)  THE  BOARD  MAY,  UPON REQUEST BY AN EMPLOYER OR INSURER, EXCUSE
 SUCH EMPLOYER OR INSURER FROM SUCH PENALTY IF SUCH PERSON COULD  NOT  BE
