  §  2.  The  opening paragraph and subparagraphs (i), (xx) and (xxi) of
 paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 530.20 of the criminal  proce-
 dure  law, the opening paragraph as amended by section 6 of subpart A of
 part VV of chapter 56 of the laws of 2023, subparagraph (i)  as  amended
 by  section 3 of part UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2020, subparagraph
 (xx) as amended and subparagraph (xxi) as added by section 4 of  subpart
 C  of  part  UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, are amended and a new
 subparagraph (xxii) is added to read as follows:
  Where the principal stands charged  with  a  qualifying  offense,  the
 court, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may in its discretion release
 the principal pending trial on the principal's own recognizance or under
 non-monetary  conditions,  fix  bail,  order  non-monetary conditions in
 conjunction with fixing bail, or, where the defendant is charged with  a
 qualifying offense [which is a felony], the court may commit the princi-
 pal to the custody of the sheriff. The court shall explain its choice of
 securing  order  on the record or in writing. A principal stands charged
 with a qualifying offense when he or she stands charged with:
 S. 8565  3
 
  (i) a felony enumerated in section 70.02 of the penal law[, other than
 robbery in the second degree as defined in subdivision  one  of  section
 160.10  of the penal law, provided, however, that burglary in the second
 degree as defined in subdivision two of section 140.25 of the penal  law
 shall  be  a qualifying offense only where the defendant is charged with
 entering the living area of the dwelling];
  (xx) any felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm to an  identifi-
 able  person  or  property,  or  any  charge of criminal possession of a
 firearm as defined in section 265.01-b  of  the  penal  law  where  such
 charge  arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a  separate
 felony  or  class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifiable person
 or property, provided, however, that the prosecutor must show reasonable
 cause to believe that the defendant committed the instant crime and  any
 underlying  crime.  For  the  purposes  of this subparagraph, any of the
 underlying crimes need not be a qualifying offense as  defined  in  this
 subdivision.  For  the purposes of this paragraph, "harm to an identifi-
 able person or property" shall include but not be limited to theft of or
 damage to property. However, based upon a review of the facts alleged in
 the accusatory instrument, if the court determines that  such  theft  is
 negligible  and  does  not appear to be in furtherance of other criminal
 activity, the principal shall be released on his or her own recognizance
 or under appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]
  (xxi) criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree  as  defined
 in subdivision three of section 265.02 of the penal law or criminal sale
 of  a  firearm  to  a  minor  as  defined in section 265.16 of the penal
 law[.]; OR
  (XXII) A CONTROLLED  SUBSTANCE  OFFENSE  AS  DEFINED  IN  ARTICLE  TWO
 HUNDRED TWENTY OF THE PENAL LAW.

 ABLE  IMMEDIATE  COMMITMENT  OF  SUCH  PRINCIPAL  IN  A  STATE  LICENSED
 SUBSTANCE  ABUSE  TREATMENT CENTER, DRUG REHABILITATION CENTER OR MENTAL
 HEALTH FACILITY. IN MAKING ITS DETERMINATION, THE COURT MAY CONSIDER THE
 FOLLOWING FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

 PRINCIPAL, IMMEDIATE RELEASE FROM CUSTODY, AND ANY OTHER  PROPOSALS  FOR
 THE  CARE AND TREATMENT OF SUCH PRINCIPAL SHALL BE PROVIDED TO THE COURT
 WITHOUT UNNECESSARY DELAY AND WITHIN NO MORE THAN SEVENTY-TWO HOURS FROM
