  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as the Month of the  Military  Child  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those young people within the great Empire State who have
made strong contributions to their communities and  who  serve  as  role
models for their peers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concerns  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as the Month
of the Military Child in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the
observance of Purple Up Day on Saturday, April 15, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State  is  home  to  three  active  duty  Army
installations, Fort Drum Army Base, U.S. Military Academy Army  Base  at
West  Point  and  Fort  Hamilton  Army  Base;  housing the 10th Mountain
Division, nearly 20,000 soldiers call Fort Drum home; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, there are over 15,000  geographical  dispensed
National  Guard and Reserve Soldiers and nearly 44,000 military children
living in New York, not on military installations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Military children make  up  a  very  special  part  of  our
nation's  population;  although  young,  these  brave sons and daughters
stand in steadfast support of their military parents through  moves  and
deployments on behalf of our country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  1986,  the Month of the Military Child is
part of the legacy left by former Defense Secretary  Caspar  Weinberger,
and  underscores  the important role military children play in the armed
forces community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sponsored by the Department of Defense  Military  Community
and  Family Policy, the Month of the Military Child is a time to applaud
military families and their children for the daily sacrifices they  make
and the challenges they overcome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) joins
the Department of Defense and  the  military  community  in  celebrating
April  as  the  Month of the Military Child; in DoDEA communities around
the world, the most essential strategic imperatives are: establishing an
educational system that progressively  builds  the  college  and  career
readiness  of  all  DoDEA  students; and establishing the organizational
capacity to operate more effectively and efficiently as a model, unified
school system; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, this vital organization aims to challenge each
student to maximize his or her  potential  and  to  excel  academically,
socially,  emotionally  and  physically  for  life,  college  and career
readiness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the month, DoDEA will encourage schools to  plan
special  events  to  honor  military children; these efforts and special
events will stress the importance of  providing  children  with  quality
services  and  support  to  help  them  succeed  in  the mobile military
lifestyle; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Purple  is  the color which symbolizes all branches of the
military; when combined, Army green, Coast Guard blue, Air  Force  blue,
Marine red and Navy blue, make purple; consequently, Saturday, April 15,
2023, has been designated as Purple Up Day, a day for communities across
the  country  to wear purple to show support and thank military children
for their strength and sacrifices; and
 
  WHEREAS, Military children exemplify the potential inherent  in  our
most  precious  resource, our youth; they have brought enduring honor to
their families and their communities through their many  sacrifices  and
achievements; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as  the  Month
of the Military Child in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
