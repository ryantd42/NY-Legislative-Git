 Introduced  by M. of A. SHIMSKY -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Energy
 
 AN ACT to amend the public service law, in  relation  to  tree  cutting,
  topping and removal along electricity distribution lines
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The public service law is amended by adding a new article 3

  § 55. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY RECOGNIZES THE NEED

 MAY ENDANGER SUCH RELIABLE DELIVERY OF ELECTRIC POWER, THUS  MAKING  THE
 CUTTING AND/OR REMOVAL OF TREES A NECESSITY.
  HOWEVER,  THE  LEGISLATURE  ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT TREES PROVIDE VARIOUS
 BENEFITS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE,  INCLUDING  PREVENTION  OF  FLOODS,
 PURIFICATION  OF  WATER,  REDUCTION  OF  SOIL EROSION, REMOVAL OF CARBON
 DIOXIDE FROM THE AIR, PROTECTION FROM THE ELEMENTS, AND  ENHANCEMENT  OF
 COMMUNITY CHARACTER AND INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY VALUES.
  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REGULATE TREE CUTTING AND REMOVAL BY
 ELECTRIC CORPORATIONS AND MUNICIPALITIES BY REQUIRING:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
