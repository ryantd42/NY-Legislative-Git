  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the  Incorporated  Village  of Hempstead Community Development Agency an
 application for exemption from real property taxes pursuant  to  section
 420-a  of  the  real  property  tax  law  with respect to the 2020--2021
 assessment roll for all of the 2020--2021 school taxes and  all  of  the
 2021  general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such organization located
 at 40 Byrd Street, town of Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise  known
 as Nassau county parcel ID section 34 block 224 lot 21. If accepted, the
 application  shall  be  reviewed as if it had been received on or before
 the taxable status date established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
