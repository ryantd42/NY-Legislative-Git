  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially  to  the  economic  vitality of their communities, thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its

  WHEREAS, Flour & Salt Cafe is receiving this prestigious  award  for
its  steadfast and unremitting commitment to Hamilton, New York, and its
innovation to economically benefit the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2015, Britty and Brendan  O'Connor,  Colgate  University
alumni  from  Hudson, New York, developed their idea to open a bakery in
the Hamilton community and introduced more unique and  delicious  foods;
they secured funding through a strategic mix of investments, grants, and
crowdfunding efforts to eventually open their first bakery in 2016; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Creating  more  jobs  during  the  midst  of  the Covid-19
Pandemic, Britty and  Brendan  O'Connor  launched  Martha's  on  Madison
(MOM's), a grocery/tavern concept aimed at fostering community space and
diversifying revenue streams; after finding great success, they acquired
a local cafe and branded it as Flour & Salt Cafe; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Expanding  their  menu, the response from students and the
community have been significantly positive; throughout their journey  in
opening  three  brick  and mortar locations, the New York Small Business
Development Center  offered  support  to  thrive  beyond  the  obstacles
imposed by the Covid-19 Pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS, Britty and Brendan O'Connor are active community advocates,
deeply involved in local organizations and initiatives; their commitment
to  fostering  a  family-like  atmosphere in their businesses translates
into greater collaboration and employee longevity, contributing to their
success; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the able leadership of its owners, Flour and Salt and
MOM's stand as pillars of the community, grossing  over  $1  million  in
2023 with a remarkable 9.6 percent increase in sales; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business  and  its  contributions  to  the
 
local  and  State  economies,  fully  confident that it will continue to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Flour &  Salt  Cafe  upon  the  occasion  of  its  designation  as
recipient of the 2024 Madison County Small Business of the Year award by
