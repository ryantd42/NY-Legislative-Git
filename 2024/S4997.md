  § 3. Subdivision 9 of section 995-c of the executive law,  as  amended

 division  of criminal justice services, the DNA record shall be expunged
 from the state DNA identification index, and such individual  may  apply
 to  the court in which the judgment of conviction was originally entered
 for an order directing  the  expungement  of  any  DNA  record  and  any

 served on the district attorney and an order directing  expungement  may
 be  granted  if  the  court  finds  that  all  appeals  relating  to the
 conviction have  been  concluded;  that  such  individual  will  not  be
 retried, or, if a retrial has occurred, the trier of fact has rendered a
 verdict  of  complete acquittal, and that expungement will not adversely
 affect the investigation or prosecution of some other person or  persons
 for  the  crime.  The  division  shall, by rule or regulation, prescribe
 procedures to ensure that the DNA record in the state DNA identification
 index, and any samples, analyses, or other documents  relating  to  such
 record,  whether  in the possession of the division, or any law enforce-
 ment or police agency, or any forensic  DNA  laboratory,  including  any
 duplicates  or copies thereof, at the discretion of the possessor there-
 of, are either destroyed or returned  to  such  individual,  or  to  the

 or pardon, was granted. The commissioner shall also adopt  by  rule  and
 regulation  a procedure for the expungement in other appropriate circum-
 stances of DNA records contained in the index.

 individual relating to such crime [resulted in  a  conviction  that  was
 subsequently reversed or vacated, or for which the individual was grant-
 ed  a  pardon pursuant to article two-A of this chapter, such individual
 may apply to the supreme court or the court in  which  the  judgment  of
 conviction was originally entered for an order directing the expungement
 of any DNA record and any samples, analyses, or other documents relating
 to  the  DNA  testing of such individual in connection with the investi-
 gation or prosecution of such crime. A copy of such application shall be
 served on the district attorney and an order directing  expungement  may
 be  granted  if  the  court  finds that the individual has satisfied the

 if  a  retrial has occurred, the trier of fact has rendered a verdict of
 complete acquittal, and that expungement will not adversely  affect  the
 investigation  or  prosecution  of  some other person or persons for the
 crime. If an order directing the expungement of any DNA record  and  any
 samples, analyses or other documents relating to the DNA testing of such
 individual  is  issued]  WHICH  WAS  RESOLVED BY A DISMISSAL, SUCCESSFUL

 in another county for an offense specified in subdivision one of section
 160.10  OF  THIS  TITLE,  is  released by a local criminal court of such
