 AN  ACT  granting retroactive membership in the New York state and local
  police and fire retirement system to Paul Valentine Jr.
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, Paul Valen-
 tine Jr., an employee of the Town of Orangetown and a member of the  New
 York  state and local police and fire retirement system, who for reasons
 not ascribable to his own negligence, failed to become a member  of  the
 New York state and local employees' retirement system during his employ-
 ment  with  the  Town of Orangetown on June 26, 2001, shall be deemed to
 have joined the New York state and  local  police  and  fire  retirement
 system  on such date and shall be granted Tier II status in the New York
 state and local police and fire retirement system, if, within  one  year
 of  the effective date of this act, he shall file a written request with
 the state comptroller.
  § 2. No contributions made to the New York state and local  retirement
 system  by  Paul  Valentine  Jr.  shall be returned or refunded to him
 pursuant to this act.
  § 3. All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the Town of Orangetown.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide Paul Valentine Jr. with a date  of  membership
 of  June  26, 2001, resulting in Tier 2 status in the New York State and
 Local Police and Fire Retirement System. Paul Valentine Jr. is currently
 a Tier 6 member. There will be no refund of member contributions.

 A. 5379--A  2
 
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of  approximately  $20,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of  the  Town  of  Orangetown for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future years, this cost will vary as the bill-
 ing rates and salary of Paul Valentine Jr. change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $12,700 which will be
 borne by the Town of Orangetown as a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
