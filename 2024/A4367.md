 may be provided for in the rules and regulations adopted by the board of
 fire  commissioners;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, THAT THE BOARD OF FIRE COMMIS-
 SIONERS MAY BY RESOLUTION, ADOPT A POLICY ALLOWING  FIRE  DISTRICTS  THE
 OPTION  TO  SET THE DAY OF ELECTION OF CHIEF AND ASSISTANT CHIEFS ON THE
 SAME DAY AS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S ELECTION OF  ADMINISTRATION  OFFICERS.

 department. In addition, the board of fire commissioners may  by  resol-
 ution  require that any or all of such fire department officers shall be

 The person acting as secretary of such meeting shall promptly notify the
 fire district secretary in writing of such  nominations.  The  board  of

 assistant chief. Any fire department chief or  assistant  chief  who  is
 convicted  of  arson  in  any  degree during his term of office shall be
