 AN  ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to payment rates for
  managed long term care plans
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 8 of section 4403-f of the public health law,
 as amended by section 21 of part B of chapter 59 of the laws of 2016, is
 amended to read as follows:
  8. (A) Payment rates for managed long term care plan enrollees  eligi-
 ble  for  medical  assistance.  The commissioner shall establish payment
 rates for services provided to enrollees eligible under title XIX of the
 federal social security act. Such payment  rates  shall  be  subject  to
 approval by the director of the division of the budget and shall reflect
 savings to both state and local governments when compared to costs which
 would  be incurred by such program if enrollees were to receive compara-
 ble health and long term care services on a fee-for-service basis in the
 geographic region in which such services are proposed  to  be  provided.
 Payment rates shall be risk-adjusted to take into account the character-
 istics  of  enrollees, or proposed enrollees, including, but not limited
 to:  frailty, disability level,  health  and  functional  status,  age,
 gender,  the  nature  of  services provided to such enrollees, and other
 factors as determined by the commissioner. The  risk  adjusted  premiums
 may  also  be  combined  with  disincentives or requirements designed to
 mitigate any incentives to obtain higher payment categories. In  setting
 such  payment  rates, the commissioner shall consider costs borne by the
 managed care program to ensure actuarially sound and adequate  rates  of
 payment  to ensure quality of care shall comply with all applicable laws
