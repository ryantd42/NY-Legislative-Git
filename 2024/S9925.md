 paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section  five  hundred  eleven  of
 this  article,  OR  SECTION  195.16-A  OF  THE  PENAL  LAW, satisfactory
 evidence  of  payment  of  any  fines or penalties imposed in connection
 therewith; and
  6. Where a demand for the return of a motor vehicle is not made within
 ninety days after the termination of  the  criminal  proceeding  founded
 upon the charge of aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in
 the  first  degree,  OR  AGGRAVATED OBSTRUCTING EMERGENCY SERVICES UNDER
 SECTION 195.16-A OF THE PENAL LAW, such motor vehicle shall be deemed to

 accordance with section twelve hundred twenty-four of this chapter or as
 otherwise provided by law.
  8.  Any  owner  who receives notice of the institution of a forfeiture

 forfeiture  action  in  accordance  with  subdivision (a) of section one
 thousand twelve of the civil practice law and rules. Any person  with  a
 security interest in such vehicle who receives notice of the institution
 of  the  forfeiture  action shall assert a claim for the satisfaction of
 such person's security interest in such vehicle by  intervening  in  the
 forfeiture  action  in  accordance  with  subdivision (a) of section one
 thousand twelve of the civil practice law and  rules.  If  the  action
 relates  to  a vehicle in which a person holding a security interest has
 intervened pursuant to this subdivision, the burden shall  be  upon  the

 intervenor knew that such vehicle was or would be used for  the  commis-
 sion of a violation of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision
 three  of  section  five hundred eleven of [the vehicle and traffic law]

 fitted  from  such  conduct  or (b) voluntarily agreed to the use of the
 vehicle for the commission of such violation by  consent  freely  given.
 For  purposes  of this subdivision, such intervenor knowingly and unlaw-
 fully benefited from the commission of such violation when [he  or  she]
 THEY  derived  in  exchange  for permitting the use of such vehicle by a
 person or persons committing  such  specified  violation  a  substantial
 benefit  that would otherwise not have accrued as a result of the lawful
 use of such vehicle. "Benefit" means benefit as defined  in  subdivision
 seventeen of section 10.00 of the penal law.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
