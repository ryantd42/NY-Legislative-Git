BY: Senator PALUMBO
 
  COMMENDING  Bill  Gorga  upon  the occasion of his
  designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Bill Gorga upon the occasion of his designation as recipient  of
a  Liberty  Medal,  the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established  by
Resolution  and  is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have merited special
commendation for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf  of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Around  2 p.m. on Monday, February 13, 2023, Bill Gorga of
East Marion, New York, was out shopping for  Valentine's  Day  on  Front
Street  in  Greenport, New York, when he noticed the car parked in front
of him was running; and
 
  WHEREAS, Shortly thereafter, Bill Gorga witnessed the car speed  off
as  a  woman  frantically  came running out of the store, screaming that
someone had stolen her car with her grandchild in  the  car  seat;  Bill
immediately opened the door, and he and the distraught grandmother raced
after her vehicle heading west on Route 25; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bill Gorga caught up to the SUV near Moores Lane and cut it
off  on  the  shoulder,  and  the  grandmother sprang out of his car and
jumped into her vehicle to save the baby; the driver of the  stolen  car
took off again with the both the grandmother and the child inside; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bill  Gorga continued to pursue the SUV and managed to get
the driver to stop near Silvermere Road, where the  thief  released  the
grandmother  and  child  from  the  stolen  vehicle  and  then continued
westbound; and
 
  WHEREAS, As Bill Gorga was calling 911, an officer in a  sector  car
saw the grandmother, child and Bill standing on the shoulder of Route 25
and shared information about the vehicle and a description of the driver
to other sector cars; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Within  minutes,  the Southold sector car operator saw the
SUV speeding westbound near Town Harbor Lane in Southold  and  attempted
to  catch  up;  the  man  driving  the  stolen car sped through Southold
Village, passing other vehicles and disregarding traffic  signals  until
he  struck  a  guardrail,  drove  up  onto  the Southold American Legion
property, and then came to rest along Route 25; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Responding  officers  quickly  apprehended  him  without a
struggle and transported him to police headquarters for processing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bill Gorga, in his spontaneous  and  heroic  acts,  has  so
aptly  demonstrated  his  character  and  compassion  for the welfare of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond without thought of danger or reward when others are in  need  of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Bill Gorga upon the occasion of his designation as recipient  of
a  Liberty  Medal,  the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Bill Gorga.
