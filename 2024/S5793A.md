 subject to annual escalation in the same manner as provided for an early
 retirement  benefit  pursuant  to  subdivision c of section five hundred
 five of this article.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall

  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary

 impacted population is summarized below.

  - Average Age:  39.2
  - Average Service:  6
  - Average Salary:  89,800

  - Number Count:  67
  - Average Age:  41.5
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS: Currently, Tier 3 normal service retire-
 ment, early service retirement, and vested retirement benefits for Sani-
 tation members in 22-Year Plans are subject to an offset equal to 50% of
 the primary social security benefit  as  defined  in  RSSL  Section  511
 beginning at age 62.
  Under  the proposed legislation, the offset for such benefits would be
 eliminated resulting in an increase in benefits.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
  This Fiscal Note does not include cost analyses relating to provisions
 contained in RSSL Section 500(c).

 sky  are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of
 Actuaries. We are members of NYCERS but do not believe  it  impairs  our
 objectivity  and  we  meet  the  Qualification Standards of the American
 Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained  herein.
 To  the  best  of  our knowledge, the results contained herein have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and
