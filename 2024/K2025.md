  HONORING  Willard Mathers upon the occasion of his
  induction into the Rome Arts Hall of Fame on May  5,
  2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor and pay
tribute to those individuals whose commitment to promoting the  richness
and  diversity  of  the  performing,  visual,  and  literary  arts,  has
contributed to the strength, vitality, and cultural enrichment of  their
communities and the great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Willard Mathers upon the occasion of his induction into  the  Rome  Arts
Hall of Fame on Sunday, May 5, 2024, at the Capitol Theatre in Rome, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 2005, The Rome Arts Hall of Fame aligns with
their  mission  to honor individuals who have a strong connection to the
Rome community and a significant involvement in the performing,  visual,
or  literary arts; the 17th group to be inducted, the Class of 2024 will
be celebrated by the Capitol Arts Complex with a schedule  of  induction
activities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Willard Mathers is fondly remembered by many Rome students
who studied under his direction as orchestra director at Strough  Junior
High  School and Rome Free Academy in the mid 1960's; he also led string
groups at Utica Free Academy and Cazenovia; following his work in  Rome,
he played with the Syracuse Symphony; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Individuals  devoted  to improving the quality of life for
others, enabling them to build  lives  of  dignity  and  self-worth  are
deserving  of the highest praise and recognition; Willard Mathers is one
such individual; and
 
  WHEREAS, The arts are  the  building  blocks  of  civilization,  are
central  to human expression, enlighten us, and inspire the imagination;
educational institutions, individuals, and organizations  which  further
such  worthy  purposes  richly merit the recognition and appreciation of
this Legislative Body and the people of the  State  of  New  York;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Willard Mathers upon the occasion of his induction into  the  Rome
Arts Hall of Fame on May 5, 2024; and be it further
