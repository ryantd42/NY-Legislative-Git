  COMMENDING  Church  Women  United of Brooklyn upon
  the occasion  of  hosting  its  35th  Annual  Prayer
  Breakfast on March 11, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social and
educational benefits they confer, play a vital role in  the  development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since our nation's earliest days, Americans have prayed as
a  way  of  guiding,  uniting,  and  healing;  in  times  of  peace  and
prosperity, tragedy and joy, prayer has provided comfort and sustenance;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the tradition of this State and Nation to pay tribute
to  those  institutions  and  individuals  who  have  contributed to the
ethical and spiritual values of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Church Women United of Brooklyn upon the occasion of hosting its
35th Annual Prayer Breakfast, featuring Minister Kenesha Traynham-Cooper
as the guest speaker, on Saturday, March 11, 2023, at El Caribe  Country
Club Caterers in Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Church  Women  United is an inclusive ecumenical Christian
women's movement celebrating unity in diversity and empowering women  to
work towards a world of peace and justice; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  1941,  women  of  the  Church  Women  United  (CWU)
movement, previously named the United Council of  Church  Women  (UCCW),
have  held  a  vision  of  Christian unity and prayerful action; CWU was
founded as a racially, culturally,  theologically,  inclusive  Christian
women's  movement  to  celebrate unity, diversity, and work for peace in
the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Women  of  faith  from  three  interdenominational  women's
groups  representing  70  denominations  convened  in Atlantic City, New
Jersey in December of 1941, while bombs were being dropped and the world
was at war; the former United Council of Church Women's first action was
to circulate a petition signed by 84,000 church women urging the  United
States at the signing of the United Nations Charter to join and take its
full responsibility in a world organization; and
 
  WHEREAS, The action received wide publicity in the media and Eleanor
Roosevelt  later  involved  the  UCCW in a conference at the White House
discussing "how women may share in post war policy making"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Such action remains typical for Church Women United  today,
as  the  organization's  quest  for  information  and  prayerful  action
continues; women of the movement  affirm  that  prayer  and  action  are
inseparable and that both have immeasurable influence in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Church Women United is in direct correlation
to  the efforts of its dedicated staff and Board of Directors, including
its president, Sheila Davis, who has served  in  this  capacity  for  10
years,  and  whose involvement is, and always has been, characterized by
an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard  of  excellence  in all endeavors on behalf of the organization
and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, Church Women United stands on the  threshold  of  tomorrow,
prepared  to  meet  the challenges of the coming decades while retaining
that spiritual resolve which characterizes its past; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to take  note  of
enduring  religious  institutions  and to bring such institutions to the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend Church Women United of Brooklyn upon the occasion of hosting its
35th  Annual  Prayer  Breakfast,  fully confident that this commendation
reflects the belief in  those  values  which  enhance  the  dignity  and
purpose of life; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Church Women United, Brooklyn, New York.
