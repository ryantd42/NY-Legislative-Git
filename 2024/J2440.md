BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  HONORING  Jane  Ondich  upon  the  occasion of her
  designation for special recognition by the New  York
  State Office for the Aging on May 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Jane  Ondich
upon  the occasion of her designation for special recognition by the New
York State Office for the Aging at its Annual  Older  New  Yorker's  Day
Celebration  on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at the Hart Theatre Lounge in The
Egg, Albany, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each May, the New York State Office for the Aging pauses to
acknowledge the outstanding contributions made by older citizens  during
National Older Americans Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of  older generations have helped build and shape
our Nation to be the greatest in  the  world;  they  have  defended  our
freedoms  and  values  to ensure that those who come after them may have
better lives; nowhere in the Nation is the legacy of their efforts  more
visible  and  more  a part of the lives of all citizens than here in the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a steadfast and unwavering commitment to giving  back,
Jane  Ondich encourages others to consider volunteering, emphasizing the
profound impact it can have on both individuals and communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, From her involvement with AmeriCorps Seniors  to  assisting
citizenship  classes  at  Syracuse  Community Connections, Jane Ondich's
passion for helping others shines through; and
 
  WHEREAS, Originally  hailing  from  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania,  Jane
Ondich's  journey  led  her  to settle in Chittenango, New York in 1974,
where she embarked on a 36-year teaching career; and
 
  WHEREAS, Alongside her husband, Jane Ondich embraces  travel  as  an
opportunity to connect with family scattered across the country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jane  Ondich  emphasizes  her  motivation to serve without
seeking recognition; for her, volunteering is not just about the  tasks,
but  about  the  connections made and the warmth of knowing she's made a
difference in someone's life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by  an
individual  for  the  benefit  of others which Jane Ondich has displayed
throughout her life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jane Ondich, a  very  active  and  industrious  woman,  has
inspired  and  enriched  the  lives  of  those  she  serves  through her
 
volunteerism,  generously  sharing  the  wisdom  gained  over  years  of
experiencing life to its fullest; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Jane Ondich upon the  occasion  of  her  designation  for  special
recognition  by the New York State Office for the Aging on May 14, 2024;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Jane Ondich.
