  (b)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subdivi-
 sion, financial assistance may, however, be provided to a project  where
 facilities or property that are primarily used in making retail sales of
 goods  or  services to customers who personally visit such facilities to
 obtain such goods or services constitute  more  than  one-third  of  the
 total  project cost, where[: (i)] the predominant purpose of the project
 would be to make available goods or services which would  not,  but  for
 the  project,  be  reasonably  accessible  to the residents of the city,
 town, or village within which the  proposed  project  would  be  located
 because  of  a  lack  of  reasonably  accessible retail trade facilities
 offering such goods or services[; or (ii) the project is  located  in  a
 highly distressed area].
