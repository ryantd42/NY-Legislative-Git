 AN ACT relating to authorizing the state university of New York at Stony
  Brook to lease certain lands for the purpose of constructing a facili-
  ty  to  support research and development to address the national semi-
  conductor  chip  shortage  and  related  environmental  sustainability
  issues
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the  State
 University  of  New  York  at  Stony  Brook  ("Stony Brook") created the
 Research and Development Park in order to support the  cross-pollination
 of  ground-breaking  research and cutting edge technology in the private
 sector to benefit the students, faculty and staff as well as the broader
 community. Now, Stony Brook has determined there is an opportunity for a
 private entity to construct an additional facility in the  Research  and
 Development  Park,  which  would provide needed additional facilities to
 support the research and development needs of faculty, staff,  students,
 and  the  community  and seeks to use approximately 8 acres of underuti-
 lized land on Stony Brook's Research and Development  Park  to  build  a
 facility  to  address  these  research and development needs, as well as
 engage in its private commercial research, development and manufacturing
 of tools to fabricate semiconductor chips, other memory storage  devices
 or any future technology developed to hold data for later retrieval. The
 private  entity, which provides new technology to aid in the manufacture
 of semiconductor chips, would address the  national  semiconductor  chip
 shortage  and  related environmental sustainability issues, fulfilling a
 necessary and vital state and federal public purpose.  The  legislature
 further  finds that granting the trustees of the State University of New
 York the authority and power to lease and  otherwise  contract  to  make
 available  grounds  and facilities of the campus of the State University
 of New York at Stony Brook available in this  manner  will  ensure  such
 land  is  utilized  for  the  benefit of Stony Brook and the surrounding
 community.

  § 2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the State  Univer-
 sity  of  New  York  trustees  are authorized and empowered, without any
 public bidding, to lease and otherwise contract to make available  to  a
 ground  lessee  a  portion  of  the  lands  of  the university generally
 described in this act for the purpose of developing, constructing, main-
 taining  and  operating  a  facility to engage in its private commercial
 research, development and  manufacturing  purposes,  while  additionally
 providing  dedicated  space which will support the research and develop-
 ment needs of faculty, staff, students, and  the  community,  which  may
 include  supporting  services to address the national semiconductor chip
 shortage and related environmental sustainability issues. Such lease  or
 contract  shall  be  for  a period not exceeding one hundred (100) years
 without any fee simple conveyance and otherwise upon  terms  and  condi-
 tions determined by such trustees, subject to the approval of the direc-
 tor  of  the  division of the budget, the attorney general and the state
 comptroller. In the event that the real property that is the subject  of
 such  lease or contract shall cease to be used for the purpose described
 in this act, such lease or contract shall immediately terminate and  the
 real  property  and  any  improvements thereon shall revert to the State
 University of New York. Any lease or contract entered into  pursuant  to
 this  act  shall  provide  that the real property that is the subject of
 such lease or contract and any improvements thereon shall revert to  the
 State  University  of  New  York  on  the expiration of such contract or
 lease. The allocation of any and all  proceeds  related  to  the  leases
 authorized by this act shall be subject to approval by the state univer-
 sity trustees.
  §  3. Any contract or lease entered into pursuant to this act shall be
 deemed to be a state contract for purposes of article 15-A of the execu-
 tive law, and any contractor, subcontractor, lessee or sublessee  enter-
 ing into such contract or lease for the construction, demolition, recon-
 struction, excavation, rehabilitation, repair, renovation, alteration or
 improvement  authorized  pursuant  to  this  act shall be deemed a state
 agency for the purposes of article 15-A of the executive law and subject
 to the provisions of such article.
  § 4. Notwithstanding any general, special or  local  law  or  judicial
 decision  to the contrary, all work performed on a project authorized by
 this act where all or any portion thereof involves a lease or  agreement
 for  construction,  demolition,  reconstruction,  excavation,  rehabili-
 tation, repair, renovation, alteration or improvement  shall  be  deemed
 public work and shall be subject to and performed in accordance with the
 provisions  of  article 8 of the labor law to the same extent and in the
 same manner as a contract of the state,  and  compliance  with  all  the
 provisions  of  article  8  of  the  labor  law shall be required of any
 lessee, sublessee, contractor or subcontractor on the project, including
 the enforcement of prevailing wage requirements by the fiscal officer as
 defined in paragraph e of subdivision 5 of section 220 of the labor  law
 to the same extent as a contract of the state.
  §  5. Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the
 state university of New York shall not contract out to the ground lessee
 or any subsidiary for the instruction or any  pedagogical  functions  or
 services,  or  any  administrative  services,  and  similar professional
 services currently being performed by state employees  at  Stony  Brook.
 Any  such  functions  and services performed in the space used by or for
 the research of faculty, staff and students  of  Stony  Brook  shall  be
 performed  by state employees pursuant to the civil service law. Nothing
 in this act shall result in the displacement of any  currently  employed
 S. 9614  3
 
 state  worker  or  the  loss of position (including partial displacement
 such as reduction in the hours of nonovertime, wages or employment bene-
 fits), or result in the impairment of existing contracts for services or
 collective  bargaining rights pursuant to existing agreements. All posi-
 tions currently at the state university of New York in the  unclassified
 service  of  the  civil  service  law  shall  remain in the unclassified
 service. No services or work performed in the space used by or  for  the
 research  of faculty, staff and students of Stony  Brook on the property
 described in this act currently performed by public employees or  future
 work  that  is  similar  in scope and nature to the work being currently
 performed by public employees shall be contracted out or  privatized  by
 the  state  university of New York or by an affiliated entity or associ-
 ated entity of the state university of New York. All  such  future  work
 shall  be  performed  by  public  employees.  Nothing  herein  shall  be
 construed to require a private commercial enterprise to  be  subject  to
 the  civil  service law, the collective bargaining agreements or to have
 its own employees deemed state employees for any purpose when engaged in
 its private commercial activities, and the ground lessee is not deemed a
 state agency for any purpose other than as provided for in this act.

 act that involves the design, construction, reconstruction,  demolition,
 excavating,  rehabilitation,  repair, renovation, alteration or improve-
 ment of such property.
  (b)  "project  labor  agreement"  shall  mean  a  pre-hire  collective
 bargaining  agreement  between  a  contractor  and a labor organization,
 establishing the labor organization as the collective bargaining  repre-
 sentative  for  all  persons  who  will perform work on the project, and
 which provides that only contractors and subcontractors who sign a  pre-
 negotiated  agreement  with  the  labor organization can perform project
 work.
  § 7. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any  general,  special,  or
 local  law  or  judicial decision to the contrary: the ground lessee may
 require a contractor awarded  a  contract,  subcontract,  lease,  grant,
 bond,  covenant or other agreement for a project to enter into a project
 labor agreement during and for the work involved with such project  when
 such  requirement  is  part of the ground lessee's request for proposals
 for the project and when the state university of New York at Stony Brook
 determines that the record supporting the decision to enter into such an
 agreement establishes that  the  interests  underlying  the  competitive
 bidding laws are best met by requiring a project labor agreement includ-
 ing  obtaining  the  best  work at the lowest possible price; preventing
 favoritism, fraud and corruption; the impact of delay;  the  possibility
 of cost savings; and any local history of labor unrest.
  (b)  If  the  state  university  of  New  York at Stony Brook does not
 require a project labor agreement, then any  contractor,  subcontractor,
 lease,  grant, bond, covenant or other agreements for a project shall be
 awarded pursuant to section 135 of the state finance law.
  § 8. Nothing in this act shall be deemed to waive or impair any rights
 or benefits of employees of the state university of New York that other-
 wise would be available to them pursuant  to  the  terms  of  agreements
 between the certified representatives of such employees and the state of
 New  York  pursuant  to  article  14  of the civil service law; all work
 performed on such property in the spaces used by or for the research  of
 the  faculty, staff and students of Stony Brook that ordinarily would be
 S. 9614  4

 shall continue to be performed by such employees.
  § 9. Without limiting the determination of the terms and conditions of
 such  contracts  or  leases,  such  terms and conditions may provide for
 leasing,  subleasing,  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,
 improvement,  operation  and management of and provision of services and
 assistance and the granting of licenses, easements  and  other  arrange-
 ments  with  regard to such grounds and facilities by the ground lessee,
 and parties contracting with the ground lessee, and in  connection  with
 such  activities,  the obtaining of funding or financing, whether public
 or private, unsecured or secured (including, but not limited to, secured
 by leasehold mortgages and assignments of  rents  and  leases),  by  the
 ground  lessee  and  parties  contracting with the ground lessee for the
 purposes of completing the project described in this act.
  § 10. Such lease shall include  an  indemnity  provision  whereby  the
 lessee  or sublessee promises to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the
 lessor against all claims, suits, actions, and liability to all  persons
 on  the leased premises, including tenant, tenant's agents, contractors,
 subcontractors, employees, customers, guests,  licensees,  invitees  and
 members of the public, for damage to any such person's property, whether
 real  or  personal, or for personal injuries arising out of tenant's use
 or occupation of the demised premises.
  § 11. Any construction contracts entered into  pursuant  to  this  act
 between the ground lessee and parties contracting with the ground lessee

 vation, rehabilitation, repair, renovation, alterations or  improvements
 to such structure shall be awarded by a competitive process.
