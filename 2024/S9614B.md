 AN ACT relating to authorizing the state university of New York at Stony
  Brook to lease certain lands for the purpose of constructing a facili-
  ty  to  support research and development to address the national semi-
  conductor  chip  shortage  and  related  environmental  sustainability
  issues
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the  state
 university  of  New  York  at  Stony  Brook  ("Stony Brook") created the
 Research and Development Park in order to support the  cross-pollination
 of  ground-breaking  research and cutting edge technology in the private
 sector to benefit the students, faculty and staff as well as the broader
 community. Now, Stony Brook has determined there is an  opportunity  for
 Veeco  to  construct an additional facility in the Research and Develop-
 ment Park, which would provide needed additional facilities  to  support
 the  research and development needs of faculty, staff, students, and the
 community and seeks to use approximately 8 acres of  underutilized  land
 on  Stony  Brook's  Research and Development Park to build a facility to
 address these research and development needs, as well as engage  in  its
 private  commercial  research, development and manufacturing of tools to
 fabricate semiconductor chips,  other  memory  storage  devices  or  any
 future  technology  developed  to  hold data for later retrieval. Veeco,
 which provides new technology to aid in the manufacture of semiconductor
 chips, would  address  the  national  semiconductor  chip  shortage  and
 related  environmental sustainability issues, fulfilling a necessary and
 vital state and federal public purpose.  The legislature  further  finds
 that  granting  the  trustees  of  the  state university of New York the
 authority and power to lease and otherwise contract  to  make  available

 utilized for the benefit of Stony Brook and the surrounding community.
  §  2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the state univer-
 sity of New York trustees are  authorized  and  empowered,  without  any
 public  bidding,  to lease and otherwise contract to make available to a
 not-for-profit corporation, established by or affiliated with the  state
 university of New York at Stony Brook, an educational corporation or any
 other  person  (other than the state government or any agency thereof or
 any public authority) a portion of the lands of the university generally
 described in this act for the purpose of developing, constructing, main-
 taining and operating a facility to engage  in  its  private  commercial
 research,  development  and  manufacturing  purposes, while additionally
 providing dedicated space which will support the research  and  develop-
 ment  needs  of  faculty,  staff, students, and the community, which may
 include supporting services to address the national  semiconductor  chip
 shortage  and related environmental sustainability issues. Such lease or
 contract shall be for a period not exceeding  one  hundred  (100)  years
 without  any  fee  simple conveyance and otherwise upon terms and condi-
 tions determined by such trustees, subject to the approval of the direc-
 tor of the division of the budget, the attorney general  and  the  state
