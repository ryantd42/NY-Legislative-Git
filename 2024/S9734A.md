  2. A notice of violation shall be served personally upon the  operator
 of a motor vehicle who is present at the time of service, and [his] SUCH
 OPERATOR'S  name, together with the plate designation and the plate type
 as shown by the registration plates of said vehicle and  the  expiration
 date,  PROVIDED  THAT  WHERE  THE VEHICLE HAS NO SUCH REGISTRATION PLATE
 ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER, THE COMMISSIONER'S AGENT, OR THE  EQUIVALENT
 OFFICIAL  OR  AGENTS  FROM ANOTHER STATE, TERRITORY, DISTRICT, PROVINCE,
 NATION OR OTHER  JURISDICTION,  OR  WHERE  SUCH  REGISTRATION  PLATE  IS
 CONCEALED OR OBSCURED, THE VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER MAY BE INSERTED
 IN  SUCH  NOTICE IN PLACE OF OR IN ADDITION TO THE PLATE DESIGNATION AND
 PLATE TYPE; the make or model, and, PROVIDED THAT A BODY TYPE  IS  INDI-
 CATED ON THE REGISTRATION STICKER OF SAID VEHICLE, THE body type of said
 vehicle;  a  description  of  the  charged  violation, including but not
 limited to a reference to the applicable traffic rule  or  provision  of
 this  chapter;  information as to the days and hours the applicable rule
 or provision of this chapter is  in  effect,  unless  always  in  effect
 pursuant to rule or this chapter and where appropriate the word ALL when
 the  days and/or hours in effect are everyday and/or twenty-four hours a
 day; the meter number for a meter violation, where appropriate; and  the
 date,  time and particular place of occurrence of the charged violation,
 shall be inserted therein. A mere listing of a meter number in cases  of
 charged  meter violations shall not be deemed to constitute a sufficient
 description of a particular place of occurrence  for  purposes  of  this
 subdivision.  The  notice of violation shall be served upon the owner of
 the motor vehicle if the operator  is  not  present,  by  affixing  such
 notice  to  said vehicle in a conspicuous place. Whenever such notice is
 so affixed, in lieu of inserting the name of the person charged with the
 violation in the space provided for the identification of  said  person,
 the  words  "owner of the vehicle bearing license" may be inserted to be
 followed by the plate designation and plate type as shown by the  regis-
 tration  plates  of  said  vehicle  together  with  the expiration date,
 PROVIDED THAT WHERE THE VEHICLE HAS NO SUCH REGISTRATION PLATE ISSUED BY
 THE COMMISSIONER, THE COMMISSIONER'S AGENT, OR THE  EQUIVALENT  OFFICIAL
 OR  AGENTS  FROM ANOTHER STATE, TERRITORY, DISTRICT, PROVINCE, NATION OR
 OTHER JURISDICTION, OR WHERE SUCH REGISTRATION  PLATE  IS  CONCEALED  OR
 OBSCURED,  THE  VEHICLE  IDENTIFICATION  NUMBER  MAY BE INSERTED IN SUCH
 NOTICE IN PLACE OF OR IN ADDITION TO THE  PLATE  DESIGNATION  AND  PLATE
 TYPE;  the make or model, and, PROVIDED THAT A BODY TYPE IS INDICATED ON
 THE REGISTRATION STICKER OF SAID VEHICLE, THE body type of said vehicle;
 a description of the charged violation, including but not limited  to  a
 reference  to  the applicable traffic rule or provision of this chapter;
 information as to the days and hours the applicable rule or provision of
 this chapter is in effect unless always in effect pursuant  to  rule  or
 this  chapter  and  where  appropriate the word ALL when the days and/or
 hours in effect are every day and/or twenty-four hours a day; the  meter
 number  for  a meter violation where appropriate; and the date, time and
 particular place of occurrence of the charged violation.  Service of the
 notice of violation, or a duplicate  thereof  by  affixation  as  herein
 provided  shall  have  the same force and effect and shall be subject to
 the same  penalties  for  disregard  thereof  as  though  the  same  was
 personally served with the name of the person charged with the violation
 inserted therein.
  §  3.  Paragraph  (a) of subdivision 2-a of section 238 of the vehicle
 and traffic law, as added by chapter 224 of the laws of 1995, is amended
 to read as follows:
 S. 9734  3
 
  (a) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of subdivision  two  of
 this  section, where the plate type or the expiration date are not shown
 on either the registration plates or sticker of a vehicle or  where  the
 registration  sticker is covered, faded, defaced or mutilated so that it
 is  unreadable,  OR CANNOT BE LOCATED ON SUCH VEHICLE, the plate type or
 the expiration date  may  be  omitted  from  the  notice  of  violation;
 provided,  however,  [such] THAT THE condition OR ABSENCE OF SUCH PLATES
 OR STICKER must be so described and inserted on the notice of  violation
 AND THAT SUPPORTING PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION MAY BE PROVIDED.
  §  4. Subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of subdivision 2-a of section
 238 of the vehicle and traffic law, as added by chapter 409 of the  laws
 of 2001, is amended to read as follows:
  (ii)  Notice  shall  be  served on the owner by mail to the last known
 registered address within THE GREATER OF SIX YEARS OF THE  DATE  OF  THE
 DISMISSAL  OR two years of the time that the enforcing authority discov-
 ers, or could  with  reasonable  diligence  have  discovered,  that  the
 dismissal  was  procured  due  to  the  knowing  fraud, false testimony,
 misrepresentation, or other misconduct, or the knowing alteration  of  a
 notice  of  parking  violation, by the person so charged or [his or her]
 SUCH PERSON'S agent, employee, or representative. Such notice shall  fix
 a  time  when  and  place where a hearing shall be held before a hearing
 examiner to determine whether or not  dismissal  of  a  charged  parking
 violation  shall be set aside. Such notice shall set forth the basis for
 setting aside the dismissal and advise the owner that failure to  appear
 at  the date and time indicated in such notice shall be deemed an admis-
 sion of liability and shall result in the setting aside of the dismissal
 and entry of a determination on the charged  parking  violation.  Such
 notice  shall also contain a warning that civil penalties may be imposed
 for the violation pursuant to this paragraph and that a default judgment
 may be entered thereon.
  § 5. Section 242 of the vehicle and traffic law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 3-a to read as follows:
  3-A. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS SECTION TO THE CONTRARY, IN

 TRATIVE APPEAL OF A DETERMINATION REGARDING A NOTICE OF VIOLATION SERVED
 ON AN OWNER OR OPERATOR OF A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED
 IN  SECTION  4-01  OF  TITLE THIRTY-FOUR OF THE RULES OF THE CITY OF NEW

  (A) POSTED A BOND IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DETERMINATION APPEALED FROM; OR

 SURCHARGES, AS APPLICABLE:
  (I)  ANY  PENALTY  IMPOSED  PURSUANT  TO  A NOTICE OF LIABILITY ISSUED
 PURSUANT TO A PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY SECTION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE-A,
 ELEVEN  HUNDRED  ELEVEN-A,  ELEVEN  HUNDRED  ELEVEN-C,  ELEVEN  HUNDRED
 ELEVEN-C-ONE, OR ELEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY-B OF THIS CHAPTER, OTHER THAN ANY
 ADDITIONAL PENALTY IMPOSED FOR FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A NOTICE OF LIABIL-

  §  6.  Subdivision 6 of section 242 of the vehicle and traffic law, as

 ty imposed and collected from the parking  violations  bureau,  LESS  AN

 ty  days  of  the  entry  of the judgement; provided, however, that such
 court, administrative body or officer shall have the authority to lessen
 from such amount any debt owed by such party and shall apply this amount
 to any outstanding fines and penalties owed by the same  individual.  If
 payment  is  not  made within thirty days, a penalty shall accrue at the
 same rate as that imposed for failure to make timely payment of  a  fine
 and  shall  be paid by the parking violations bureau; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
 THAT IN A CITY WITH A POPULATION OF ONE  MILLION  OR  MORE,  WHERE  SUCH
 AMOUNT  EXCEEDS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS, A COURT MAY EXTEND THE TIME FOR A
 PARKING VIOLATIONS BUREAU TO RETURN SUCH AN AMOUNT TO A REASONABLE PERI-
 OD OF TIME AFTER ENTRY OF THE JUDGMENT.

 fic law, as amended by chapter 193 of the laws of 1974, are  amended  to
