 AN  ACT requiring a city with a population over one million to study the
  feasibility of constructing new urban consolidation centers and shared
  use locker technologies or retrofitting existing spaces to accommodate
  such centers and locker technologies

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The city council of a city with a population of one million
 or  more  shall  conduct  a  study,  in consultation with local agencies
 responsible for transportation, city planning, environmental  protection
 and  any  other  local agency which the city council deems necessary, to
 examine the feasibility and impact of  constructing  new  urban  consol-
 idation  centers  and  shared  use  locker  technologies or retrofitting
 existing spaces to accommodate  such  centers  and  locker  technologies
 including, but not limited to, the following:
  (a)  Explore  the possibility of reducing truck traffic in residential
 neighborhoods by creating urban consolidation centers, including through
 public-private partnerships.
  (b) Assess the application of urban consolidation centers  to  service
 high-rise  buildings,  districts  with  high  pedestrian  volumes,  and
 locations with constrained delivery infrastructure.
  (c) Explore shared use locker storage technologies for  improved  last
 mile goods delivery.
  (d)  Evaluate  the  feasibility of authorizing the operation of shared
 use lockers in the public right of way, on city-owned  property,  or  in
 partnership  with  private  entities  for  improved freight distribution
 efficiency and service effectiveness.
  (e) Explore the existing spaces that  can  accommodate  urban  consol-
 idated  centers  and  shared  use  locker technologies, and evaluate the
 possibility for their retrofitting.
  (f) Identify the needs to increase  the  use  of  urban  consolidation
 centers  and  shared  use  locker  technologies and the impact that they
 could have on reducing vehicle miles traveled.
