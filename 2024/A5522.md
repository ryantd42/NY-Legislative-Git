 of  the  sex  offender's probation officer to notify the division within
 forty-eight hours of [the] ALL new [place] PLACES of residence on a form
 provided by the division. If such sex offender changes the status of his

 change  of  status shall be sent by the sex offender's probation officer
 within forty-eight hours to the division on a form provided by the divi-
 sion.
  3. In the case in which any sex offender escapes from a state or local
 correctional facility or hospital, the designated official of the facil-
 ity or hospital where the person was confined shall notify within  twen-
 ty-four  hours the law enforcement agency having had jurisdiction at the
 time of his or her conviction, informing such law enforcement agency  of
 the  name  and  aliases  of  the person, and the address OR ADDRESSES at
 which he or she resided at the time of his or her conviction, the amount
 of time remaining to be served, if any, on the full term for which he or
 she was sentenced, and the nature of the crime for which he or  she  was

 fingerprints and photograph and a summary of his or her criminal record.
  § 2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 168-f of the correction
