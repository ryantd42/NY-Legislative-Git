BY: Senator HELMING
 
  COMMENDING  Molly  Ames  upon  the occasion of her
  designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action in emergency situations to preserve the
life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Molly Ames upon the occasion of her designation as recipient  of
a  Liberty  Medal,  the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established  by
Resolution  and  is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have merited special
commendation for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf  of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  Wednesday,  June  26, 2024, Sodus, New York, resident,
Molly Ames, was driving her vehicle in the Town  of  Walworth  when  she
observed a man who was struggling to ride his bicycle; and
 
  WHEREAS, Without hesitation, Molly Ames stopped her vehicle to check
on  the  gentleman's welfare; unaware that he was suffering from a heart
attack, the man asked the concerned motorist to call 9-1-1  after  which
he collapsed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Molly  Ames  immediately  called  9-1-1  and  followed the
dispatcher's instructions to administer CPR; although she had never been
formally trained in first aid,  she  performed  chest  compressions  for
seven  minutes, an incredibly exhausting task; undeterred, the concerned
woman continued the  life-saving  procedure  until  emergency  personnel
arrived to restart the victim's heart; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  a medical fact that the first minutes of a cardiac
arrest are the most critical in the prevention  of  long-lasting  damage
and potential death; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  victim  had  no indication or family history of heart
failure; he knew that something felt strange, and he struggled to  ride;
feeling  fatigued,  he  could not keep his usual pace and dismounted his
bicycle; and
 
  WHEREAS, By the  time  medical  responders  restarted  the  victim's
heart,  he  had  been  in cardiac arrest for approximately half an hour;
because of the heroism and unselfishness of Molly  Ames,  this  grateful
grandfather  of  six, athlete, and former teacher is alive and continues
to enjoy his grandchildren and ride his bicycle; and  WHEREAS  For  her
heroic  actions, Molly Ames was honored with a Proclamation presented by
 
the Town of Walworth and a New York State Senate Citation  on  Thursday,
October 3, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  the  noble  and courageous actions taken by Molly
Ames, a precious life was saved, and  a  seemingly  dire  situation  had
positive results; and
 
  WHEREAS, Molly Ames, in her spontaneous and heroic act, has so aptly
demonstrated  her  character  and  compassion for the welfare of others,
personifying, by  virtue  of  her  action,  the  collective  concern  of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without thought of danger or reward when others need help; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Molly Ames upon the occasion of her designation as recipient of
a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an  individual  by  the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Molly Ames.
