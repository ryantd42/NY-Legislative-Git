  COMMENDING Volunteer Firefighter Peter Holmes upon
  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition after 60 years of dedicated  service  to
  Westmoreland Volunteer Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  The firefighters of New York State are renowned throughout
the Nation; their  reputation  is  synonymous  with  excellence  in  the
arduous field of fire protection and prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighters  exemplify  the power of human compassion and
the strength of the American spirit through actions of the  most  heroic
magnitude;  their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  commend  Volunteer
Firefighter  Peter  Holmes  upon  the  occasion  of  his designation for
special recognition after 60 years of dedicated service to  Westmoreland
Volunteer Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  and  fire  departments  not  only
provide the critical service of fire protection but also engage in other
activities of great benefit  and  importance  to  the  communities  they
serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Peter Holmes is such a volunteer firefighter;  throughout  60  years  of
devoted  service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond
the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Volunteer Firefighter Peter Holmes  upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation  for special recognition after 60 years of dedicated service
to Westmoreland Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Peter Holmes and Westmoreland Volunteer Fire Department.
