 retirement  election  form  with the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system, shall be authorized to file such option election form
 on behalf of her deceased husband with a joint allowance full option, if
 on or before December 31, 2023 she shall submit a  request  therefor  to
 the  state  comptroller.  In  addition, his application for disability
 retirement shall be deemed to have become effective on November 1, 2004.
 All retirement benefits payable pursuant to the provisions of  this  act

 other death benefits paid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

 tional benefit will be paid for the period beginning on November 1, 2004
 and ending on March 28,  2005,  and  a  benefit  continuance  to  Janice
