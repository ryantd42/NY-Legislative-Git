 AN  ACT  to  authorize the widow of William James Middlebrooks to file a
  retirement option election form
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Janice  Middlebrooks,  the  widow  of William James Middlebrooks who was
 employed by the Albion Correctional Facility, was a member  of  the  New
 York  state  and  local employees' retirement system, was diagnosed with
 cancer in January of 2004, was advised on October 31, 2004 that he would
 be unable to return to employment as the result of  his  malignancy  and
 the  treatment  therefor, and died on December 3, 2006 prior to filing a
 retirement election form with the New York state  and  local  employees'
 retirement system, shall be authorized to file such option election form
 on behalf of her deceased husband with a joint allowance full option, if
 on  or  before  December 31, 2024 she shall submit a request therefor to
 the state comptroller.  In addition,  his  application  for  disability
 retirement shall be deemed to have become effective on November 1, 2004.
 All  retirement  benefits payable pursuant to the provisions of this act
 shall be paid to Janice Middlebrooks and shall be  in  addition  to  any
 other death benefits paid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  authorize  Janice  Middlebrooks  to  file an option

 application  for  disability  retirement  shall be deemed to have become
 effective on November 1,  2004.  The  deceased  was  paid  a  disability
 retirement benefit beginning on March 28, 2005. All payments ceased upon
 death  because  no  option election form had been filed. If this bill is
 enacted, and a new option election form is filed, an additional  benefit
 will be paid to Janice Middlebrooks for the period beginning on November
 1,  2004  and  ending  on  March 28, 2005 and a benefit continuance will
 begin to be paid to them for their lifetime.
  If this bill is enacted  during  the  2024  Legislative  Session,  and
 Janice  Middlebrooks  timely  files  the  required option election form,
 there will be an immediate past service cost of  approximately  $456,000
 which  will be shared by the State of New York and all local participat-
 ing employers in the New York  State  and  Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System.
