  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2024, as Dystonia Awareness Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2024,  as
Dystonia Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dystonia is a disorder that causes muscles in the  body  to
contract  and spasm involuntarily; individuals affected by this disorder
cannot control or predict the movement of their bodies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dystonia is characterized  by  persistent  or  intermittent
muscle  contractions  causing  abnormal,  often  repetitive,  movements,
postures, or both; the movements are usually patterned and twisting, and
may resemble a tremor; and
 
  WHEREAS, This disorder is often initiated or worsened  by  voluntary
movements,  and  symptoms  may  "overflow"  into  adjacent  muscles;
furthermore, dystonia is  classified  by  clinical  characteristics  and
cause,  including  changes  or  damage  to  the  nervous  system  and
inheritance; doctors use these classifications to  guide  diagnosis  and
treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Symptoms  of  dystonia  are  usually  chronic but may also
appear only during "attacks" or episodes, in which case the dystonia  is
termed  paroxysmal;  sometimes  symptoms  occur  only  during  certain
movements such as walking, speaking or playing a musical instrument; and
 
  WHEREAS, These symptoms may also affect a specific part of the  body
or many parts simultaneously, and may also be painful; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  the  cause of dystonia is not known, researchers
believe that dystonia results from an abnormality in or  damage  to  the
basal ganglia or other brain regions that control movement; there may be
abnormalities  in the brain's ability to process neurotransmitters which
help cells in the brain communicate with each other; there many also  be
abnormalities  in  the way the brain processes information and generates
commands to move; and
 
  WHEREAS, The third most common movement  disorder  following  tremor
and  Parkinson's  disease, dystonia affects approximately 300,000 people
in North America; this disorder does not  discriminate,  affecting  men,
women and children of all ages and backgrounds; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dystonia  may  be  inherited  or  result from other health
conditions such as stroke, physical trauma, other diseases, or as a side
effect of certain medications; although there is no cure  for  dystonia,
 
treatments  are  available  including  oral medications, botulinum toxin
injections, and several types of surgery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2024,  as
Dystonia Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
