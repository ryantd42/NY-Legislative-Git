BY: Senator GALLIVAN
 
  COMMENDING  the  Erie  County  Federation  of Snow
  Mobile Clubs for  their  heroic  efforts  to  rescue
  stranded people during the Western New York Blizzard
  of 2022
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the Erie County Federation of Snow Mobile Clubs for their heroic
efforts to rescue stranded people during the Western New  York  Blizzard
of 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, From December 21-26, 2022, a historic extratropical cyclone
created  winter  storm  conditions,  including  blizzards,  high  winds,
snowfall, or record cold temperatures across the majority of the  United
States and parts of Canada; Buffalo, New York, and the surrounding areas
experienced  almost two full days of blizzard/zero-visibility conditions
on the 23rd and 24th; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this catastrophic blizzard which buried Buffalo  and
the  Western  New  York  Region  in  nearly 52 inches of snow, countless
numbers of people were left stuck on snow-filled roadways  as  emergency
personnel  were  unable  to  push  through  extremely dangerous whiteout
conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the Erie County Federation of Snow Mobile  Clubs
were  out around-the-clock during the blizzard, working to rescue people
and get essential workers to their jobs; and
 
  WHEREAS, From Friday evening through Saturday afternoon, members  of
the various clubs used heavy-duty equipment designed to shape trails for
snowmobiles  to rescue 41 people from Main Street in Clarence, New York,
including state troopers, ambulance workers,  and  a  firefighter;  they
also  worked  with  the Newstead Fire Company, New York State Police and
the Newstead and Akron Highway Departments to pick up  drivers  and  get
them to plow trucks; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Christmas Day, these dedicated members gave up time with
their families to bring nurses from the Clarence/Amherst area to Buffalo
General  Hospital,  an Emergency Room doctor to Sister's Hospital, and a
Buffalo Police Department Officer to his police station; and
 
  WHEREAS, Some of the clubs who gave  up  time  with  their  families
during  the  holiday  season to take care of their neighbors include the
Pioneers Sno-Surfers Sardinia Snowmobile Club, WNY  Snowmobile  Club  of
Eden Trail Blazers, WNY Snowmobile Club of Boston, and the Northern Erie
Sno-Seekers Snowmobile Club; and
 
  WHEREAS, Justly recognized as heroes, the members of the Erie County
Federation  of  Snow  Mobile  Clubs  richly merit the admiration of this
Legislative Body and their community for their consummate, swift actions
in saving the  lives  of  numerous  people;  moreover,  they  should  be
meritoriously  commended  for  remaining  calm  under  pressure  and for
showing valor and true courage while performing these lifesaving  deeds;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  members  of the Erie County Federation of Snow Mobile
Clubs have so aptly demonstrated their character and compassion for  the
welfare  of  others,  personifying,  by  virtue  of  their  actions, the
collective concern of ordinary citizens across the community of New York
State who voluntarily respond without thought of danger or  reward  when
others are in need of help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Erie County Federation of Snow Mobile Clubs for their heroic
efforts to rescue stranded people during the Western New  York  Blizzard
of 2022; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the members of the Erie County Federation of Snow  Mobile
Clubs, and to President David Waples and Treasurer Richard McNamara.
