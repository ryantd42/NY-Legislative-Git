  COMMENDING  the  Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand
  Lodge of New York upon the occasion of  hosting  its
  Vincent  E.  Best  Mid-Year  Assembly January 26-28,
  2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of New York upon the
occasion of hosting its Vincent E. Best Mid-Year Assembly January 26-28,
2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The dedicated Masons of the  Most  Worshipful  Prince  Hall
Grand  Lodge  of  New  York  are  men  with  a  social  conscience and a
charitable perspective, who are also known as Freemasons; they are  part
of a fraternal organization that shares common moral ideals and esoteric
values  which  are  based  on the doctrine of Brotherly Love, Relief and
Truth; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Vincent E. Best Mid-Year Assembly has been  a  featured
event  of  the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of New York since
1972 when it was introduced by Most Worshipful Grand Master, Vincent  E.
Best  who  served from 1971-1973; the original purpose of this event was
to refresh from labor, at which time the Grand Master would deliver  his
Mid-Year address, and for enjoyment a Grand Master's Ball was held; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the years, the Vincent E. Best Mid-Year Assembly has
expanded to include more activities such as training  workshops,  health
screening, and census education seminars, and has become one of the most
anticipated events of the year; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of New York has
truly  demonstrated  continuous service to the residents and communities
which it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established by a group of like-minded young men,  the  club
received  its charter in 1812 from the African Lodge of Boston and later
received its  Grand  Lodge  title  in  1848  after  decades  of  outside
oppression, division, and change; the Freemasons of this Grand Lodge are
a standing testament to resilience, strength, and unity through a common
sense of brotherhood; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Lodge was initially to be called the African Lodge of
New York, but later changed to Boyer Lodge of New York in honor of  Jean
Pierre  Boyer who black Masons admired and respected for his significant
role in Haiti's war of liberation from France; this New York  Lodge  was
an  active  participant  in  the  Underground Railroad, guiding enslaved
persons to freedom and has deep-rooted history in  abolition  movements;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The success of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge
of New York is  in  direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of  the  Most
Worshipful  Walter  C. King, Jr., and its members, whose involvement is,
and always has been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to honor and commend
the members of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of New  York,
Free  and  Accepted  Masons,  past  and  present,  who  have  labored so
conscientiously to secure and  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  the
community it serves; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of  New  York,  Free
and  Accepted  Masons  of  the  State  of  New York upon the occasion of
hosting its Vincent E. Best Mid-Year Assembly January 26-28,  2024;  and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Most Worshipful Grand Master Gregory R. Smith Jr.  of
the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons of
the State of New York.
