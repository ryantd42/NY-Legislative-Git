 AN ACT granting retroactive retirement service credit to David M. Sturtz
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  David  M.
 Sturtz,  currently  a  village of Liverpool police officer and member of
 the New York state and local police and fire retirement  system  covered
 by  section 384-d of the retirement and social security law, who between
 October 14, 2002 and April 12, 2011 was employed by the Onondaga  county
 sheriff's  department  where  he  was a member of the New York state and
 local employees' retirement system, and who, for reasons not  ascribable
 to  his  own  negligence,  was  not granted service credit under section
 384-d of the retirement and  social  security  law  for  his  period  of
 employment  with  the  Onondaga  county  sheriff's  department, shall be
 granted such service credit under section 384-d of  the  retirement  and
 social  security  law and shall be entitled to the full rights and bene-
 fits associated with coverage under such section, provided a request  to
 that effect is filed with the state comptroller within one year from the
 effective  date  of this act.  Prior to David M. Sturtz submitting such
 request, he shall first file an application for transfer  of  membership
 with the New York state and local employees' retirement system. Upon the
 completion  of  such  transfer,  David  M. Sturtz shall not be granted a
 refund of any employee contributions made by him to the New  York  state
 and local employees' retirement system.
  §  2.  All  past  services costs associated with the implementation of
 this act shall be borne by the village of Liverpool.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would grant  service  credit  under  section  384-d  of  the
 Retirement  and Social Security Law (RSSL) to David M. Sturtz, a current
 member of the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System

 (NYSLPFRS) employed by the Village of Liverpool, for the period of Octo-
 ber 14, 2002 through  April  12,  2011,  during  which  time  they  were
 employed  by  the  Onondaga County sheriff's department. Currently, such
 service  with the Onondaga County sheriff's department is not creditable
 in a NYSLPFRS twenty-year police retirement plan.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase  of  approximately  $1,800  in  the
 annual  contributions  of  the  Village of Liverpool for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the  bill-
 ing rates and salary of David M. Sturtz change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past service cost of approximately $274,000 which will be
 borne by the Village of Liverpool as a one-time payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
  This  bill  will  not  increase the future annual contributions of the
 Village of Liverpool.
  David M. Sturtz must transfer the service credit earned while employed
 by the Onondaga County sheriff's department to the NYSLPFRS  before  the
 service credit can be granted under section 384-d of the RSSL.
