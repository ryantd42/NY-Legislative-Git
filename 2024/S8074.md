 Introduced  by  Sen. KRUEGER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the general construction law, in relation  to  requiring
  the use of gender-neutral terms in law
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 22 of the general construction law, as amended by a
 chapter of the laws of 2023 amending the general construction law relat-
 ing to requiring the use of gender-neutral terms in law, as proposed  in
 legislative  bills  numbers  S.  155  and A. 1142, is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 22. Gender. Whenever words  of  the  masculine  or  feminine  gender
 appear in any law, rule [or], regulation, OR RESOLUTION unless the sense
 of  the  sentence  indicates otherwise, they shall be deemed to refer to
 persons of any gender. This construction shall apply  to  gender  indic-
 ative  suffixes or prefixes as well as to gender indicative words. When-
 ever the reference is to a corporation, board, body, group, organization
 or other entity comprising more than one person or to an  assemblage  of
 persons or to an inanimate object the reference shall be construed to be
 [neuter]  NEUTRAL  in gender.  Hereafter, in any law, rule, regulation,
 [ordinance] or resolution, gendered terms shall not be used and  gender-
 neutral terms, including but not limited to "they", "them" and "theirs",
 shall  be  used  in  substitution  therefor  and with the same force and
 effect; provided, however, if ANY such  law,  rule,  regulation,  [ordi-
 nance]  or resolution is in reference to a specific person, the language
 referring to such person shall be gendered in accordance with the gender
 identity of such person.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the  same  date  and  in  the  same
 manner  as  a  chapter  of  the  laws  of  2023  amending  the  general
 construction law relating to requiring the use of  gender-neutral  terms
 in  law,  as  proposed  in legislative bills numbers S. 155 and A. 1142,
 takes effect.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
