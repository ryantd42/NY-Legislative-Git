 another  area  of]  OUTSIDE  SUCH GAS OR ELECTRIC CORPORATION'S New York
 state SERVICE TERRITORY or outside of  New  York  state  without  notice
 [and], A hearing AND APPROVAL before the commission. Upon receipt of the
 notice required pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall provide
 notice of the proceeding to interested parties and the public; and shall
 promptly fix a date for the commencement of a public hearing thereon not
 less than sixty days after such receipt. The testimony presented at such
 hearing may be presented in writing or orally, provided that the commis-
 sion  may make rules designed to exclude repetitive, redundant or irrel-
 evant testimony while giving all interested parties the  opportunity  to
 present  their  documentary  and/or testimonial evidence. The commission
 shall make a record of all testimony  in  all  contested  hearings.  THE
 COMMISSION  WITHIN  THIRTY  DAYS  SHALL APPROVE OR DENY THE CLOSURE OF A
 CALL CENTER OR OTHER FACILITY PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE  OR  THE  RELO-
 CATION  OF  CUSTOMER  SERVICE ASSISTANCE INQUIRIES. For purposes of this
 section "public hearing" means a public forum at  a  physical  location,
 attended  by commission members or their designees, where oral testimony
 is accepted and written testimony may be submitted for inclusion in  the
 record.  Such  forum  shall be open to parties to the proceeding and the
 general public for the presentation of comments that shall be limited to
 relevant facts directly related to  the  proceeding  in  question.  Such
 hearing  shall  be  commenced  upon  proper notice to the parties to the

 NO  EVENT  SHALL  A  GAS  OR  ELECTRIC  CORPORATION'S HISTORY OF SENDING
 CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE OUTSIDE THE GAS OR ELECTRIC CORPORATION'S  NEW  YORK
 STATE  SERVICE  TERRITORY OR OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE BE USED AS JUSTI-
 FICATION FOR DOING SO AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THE  CHAPTER  OF  THE
 LAWS  OF  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FOUR  THAT  AMENDED THIS PARAGRAPH TAKES
 EFFECT.  IT SHALL BE PERMISSIBLE FOR A GAS OR  ELECTRIC  CORPORATION  TO

 LOCATION.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, BEFORE A GAS OR ELECTRIC CORPORATION CAN

 A BONA FIDE LABOR ORGANIZATION THROUGH A  COLLECTIVE  BARGAINING  AGREE-
 MENT, SUCH POLICIES MUST HAVE BEEN MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE CORPORATION
 AND  THE  LABOR  ORGANIZATION.  SUCH  POLICIES  SHALL  NOT  VIOLATE THIS
 SECTION.
  (II) THE COMMISSION SHALL MAKE AVAILABLE A FORM ALLOWING AN ENTITY  TO
 TAKE  AN  ACTION  AGAINST  A  GAS OR ELECTRIC CORPORATION THAT KNOWINGLY
 FAILED OR NEGLECTED TO OBEY OR COMPLY WITH THIS SECTION. UPON RECEIPT OF
 SUCH FORM, IT SHALL COMMENCE A PROCEEDING TO DETERMINE IF A CALL  CENTER
 OR  OTHER  FACILITY PROVIDING CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE WAS CLOSED OR CUSTOMER
 SERVICE ASSISTANCE INQUIRIES WERE RELOCATED OUTSIDE NEW YORK STATE WITH-
 OUT NOTICE, HEARING, AND APPROVAL BEFORE  THE  COMMISSION.  PURSUANT  TO
 THIS  PARAGRAPH,  THE COMMISSION SHALL PROVIDE NOTICE OF SUCH PROCEEDING
 TO INTERESTED PARTIES AND THE PUBLIC AND SHALL PROMPTLY FIX A  DATE  FOR
 THE  COMMENCEMENT  OF  A PUBLIC HEARING THEREON NOT LESS THAN SIXTY DAYS
 AFTER SUCH RECEIPT. THE TESTIMONY  PRESENTED  AT  SUCH  HEARING  MAY  BE
 PRESENTED  IN  WRITING  OR ORALLY, PROVIDED THAT THE COMMISSION MAY MAKE
 RULES DESIGNED TO EXCLUDE REPETITIVE, REDUNDANT OR IRRELEVANT  TESTIMONY
 WHILE  GIVING  ALL  PARTIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEIR DOCUMENTARY
 AND/OR TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE. THE COMMISSION SHALL A MAKE RECORD  OF  ALL
 TESTIMONY IN ALL CONTESTED HEARINGS.  THE COMMISSION SHALL WITHIN THIRTY
 S. 8626--A  3

 VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION.

  § 3. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature that this act would  have  been  enacted  even  if such
