  § 4. Subdivision 12 of section 400.00 of the penal law, as amended  by
 chapter 207 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  12. Records required of gunsmiths and dealers in firearms. In addition
 to  the  requirements set forth in article thirty-nine-BB of the general
 business law, any person licensed as  gunsmith  or  dealer  in  firearms
 shall  keep a record book approved as to form, except in the city of New
 York, by the superintendent of state police. In the record book shall be
 entered at the time of every transaction involving a firearm  the  date,
 name, age, occupation and residence of any person from whom a firearm is
 received  or  to  whom  a  firearm  is delivered, and the calibre, make,
 model, manufacturer's name and serial number,  or  if  none,  any  other
 distinguishing  number  or  identification  mark on such firearm. Before
 delivering a firearm to any person, the licensee shall  require  him  OR
 HER  to  produce  either  a license valid under this section to carry or
 possess the same, or proof of  lawful  authority  as  an  exempt  person
 pursuant to section 265.20 of this chapter and [either (a)] the National
 Instant  Criminal  Background  Check  System (NICS) or its successor has
 issued a "proceed" response to the licensee,  [or  (b)  thirty  calendar
 days have elapsed since the date the licensee contacted NICS to initiate
 a  national  instant criminal background check and NICS has not notified
 the licensee that the transfer of the firearm to such person  should  be

 FIREARMS  TRANSACTION  RECORD,  FORM  4473, FROM THE PURCHASER; AND SUCH
 DEALER HAS RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE PURCHASER HAS PASSED ALL  BACKGROUND
 CHECKS  REQUIRED  BY  FEDERAL,  STATE AND LOCAL LAW. In addition, before
 delivering  a firearm to a peace officer, the licensee shall verify that
 person's status as a peace officer with the division  of  state  police.
 After completing the foregoing, the licensee shall remove and retain the
 attached  coupon  and enter in the record book the date of such license,
 number, if any, and name of the licensing officer, in the  case  of  the
 holder  of a license to carry or possess, or the shield or other number,
 if any, assignment and department, unit or agency, in  the  case  of  an
 exempt person. The original transaction report shall be forwarded to the
 division  of state police within ten days of delivering a firearm to any
 person, and a duplicate copy shall be kept by the licensee.  The  super-
 intendent  of  state  police  may  designate  that  such record shall be
 completed and transmitted in electronic form. A dealer may be granted  a
 waiver  from  transmitting such records in electronic form if the super-
 intendent determines that such dealer is incapable of such  transmission
 due  to  technological  limitations  that  are not reasonably within the
 control of the dealer, or other exceptional  circumstances  demonstrated
 by  the  dealer, pursuant to a process established in regulation, and at
 the discretion of the superintendent.  Records assembled  or  collected
 for  purposes  of  inclusion in the database created pursuant to section
 400.02 of this article shall not be subject to  disclosure  pursuant  to
 article  six  of the public officers law. The record book shall be main-
 tained on the premises mentioned and described in the license and  shall
 be  open  at  all  reasonable hours for inspection by any peace officer,
 acting pursuant to his OR HER special duties, or police officer. In  the
 event of cancellation or revocation of the license for gunsmith or deal-
 er in firearms, or discontinuance of business by a licensee, such record
 book  shall  be  immediately surrendered to the licensing officer in the
 city of New York, and in the counties of Nassau and Suffolk,  and  else-
 where  in  the  state  to  the  executive  department, division of state
 police.

 delivering  a  rifle  or  shotgun  to such person, [either (a)] NICS has
 issued a "proceed" response to the seller or transferor, [or (b)  thirty
 calendar days shall have elapsed since the date the seller or transferor
 contacted  NICS to initiate a national instant criminal background check
 and NICS has not notified the seller or transferor that the transfer  of
 the  rifle  or  shotgun  to  such person should be denied]  AND TEN DAYS

 ing the date on which it shall have become  a  law;  provided,  however,
