 Introduced  by  Sen.  COMRIE -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on  Energy  and  Telecommuni-
  cations
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  public service law, in relation to enacting the
  "build to need act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known as and may be cited as
 the "build to need act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings  and intent. The legislature hereby finds
 that in order to achieve the targets set forth in the climate leadership
 and community protection act, zero-emissions vehicle sales targets,  and
 regulations,  including the advanced clean truck and advanced clean cars
 II rules, zero-emissions school bus mandate, and other  relevant  goals,
 the interests of the people of the state would be served by:
  (a) expediting electric grid infrastructure upgrades to facilitate the
 charging of light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty electric vehicles;
  (b)  aligning a proactive planning process for beneficial electrifica-
 tion with the current coordinated grid  planning  process  for  electric
 corporations;
  (c)  ensuring  the  full range of feasible distributed energy resource
 technologies, load management opportunities,  and  expected  electrified
 end uses are incorporated into electric utility investment plans;
  (d)  lowering costs to customers through efficient planning, including
 consideration and deployment of non-wires solutions that reduce or elim-
 inate the need for distribution system upgrades;
  (e) ensuring meaningful  benefits  to  communities  most  affected  by
 large-scale  proactive  utility projects developed under this framework;
 and
  (f) enhancing speed,  flexibility,  and  ease  of  customer  intercon-
 nections (including both loads and distributed generation).
  § 3. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 77-a to
 read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  §  77-A. BUILD TO NEED ACT. 1. WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE
 OF THIS SECTION, THE COMMISSION SHALL COMMENCE A PROCEEDING TO IMPLEMENT
 A GRID PLANNING PROCESS THAT SHALL DIRECT ELECTRIC CORPORATIONS TO:
  (A)  ALIGN  PLANNING  UNDER  THIS SECTION WITH EXISTING PLANNING PROC-
 ESSES, INCLUDING  THE  COORDINATED  GRID  PLANNING  PROCESS  IMPLEMENTED
 PURSUANT  TO THE CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION ACT, TO THE

 RELEVANT INFORMATION CONCERNING LOCATION, TYPE, MAGNITUDE, OR TIMING  OF
 MAJOR FUTURE LOADS, AVAILABLE VEHICLE TELEMATICS DATA, AND OTHER SOURCES
 OF INFORMATION AS DIRECTED BY THE COMMISSION;
  (E)  CONSIDER  CUSTOMERS' ACTIVITIES THAT MAY REDUCE, DEFER, OR OTHER-
 WISE AFFECT THE NEED OR EXTENT OF  GRID  UPGRADES,  SUCH  AS  CUSTOMERS'
 REASONABLY  FORESEEABLE  LOAD  MANAGEMENT  ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT
