 section 2 of part A of chapter 97 of the laws of  2011,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  6.  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in

 budget that will require a tax levy that exceeds the tax levy limit  for
 the  corresponding  school  year,  not  including  any levy necessary to
 support the expenditures pursuant to subparagraphs (i) through  (iv)  of
 paragraph  i  of subdivision two of this section, then such budget shall

  (b) Where the trustee, trustees or board of education proposes a budg-
 et subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the
 ballot for such budget shall include the following statement in substan-
 tially the same form: "Adoption of  this  budget  requires  a  tax  levy
 increase of  which exceeds the statutory tax levy increase limit

 qualified voters present and voting."

 as  separate  propositions  or  the  voters from submitting propositions
 pursuant to sections two thousand eight and two thousand thirty-five  of
 this part; provided however, except in the case of a proposition submit-
 ted  for any expenditure contained within subparagraphs (i) through (iv)
 of paragraph i of subdivision two of this section, if  any  proposition,
 or  propositions  collectively  that  are  subject to a vote on the same
 date, would require an expenditure of money that  would  require  a  tax
 levy  and  would  result  in  the  tax levy limit being exceeded for the
 corresponding school year then such proposition  shall  be  approved  if
 [sixty]  MORE  THAN  FIFTY  percent of the votes cast thereon are in the
 affirmative.
