  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 21-27, 2024, as Volunteer Week in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to call attention
to the dedicated efforts of those individuals from across the  State  of
New  York  who  volunteer  their  time  and energies in service to their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  21-27,  2024,  as
Volunteer  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
observance of National Volunteer Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Volunteer  Week  was  first  designated  by  an
Executive Order from President Richard Nixon in 1974; the week serves to
recognize  and  encourage  people  to  engage in their community through
volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Volunteer  Week  works  to  inspire,  equip  and
mobilize people to take actions that can change the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteers  can  connect  with  local  community  service
opportunities through hundreds of community service organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals and communities are at  the  center  of  social
change, discovering their power to make a difference; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  National  Volunteer  Week service projects will be
performed across our great nation and volunteers will be recognized  for
their commitment to service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  giving  of oneself in service to another empowers the
giver and the recipient; experience teaches that  government  by  itself
cannot solve all of the nation's problems; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our country's volunteer force of over 64 million is a great
treasure; those who volunteer play a vital role in our community and our
future as a caring and productive nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of New York should help encourage volunteerism
and the spirit of giving during  National  Volunteer  Week,  so  that  a
greater  call  to  action  can  encourage  residents  to  spread  the
philanthropic spirit; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim April 21-27, 2024, as
Volunteer Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
