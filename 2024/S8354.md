  § 5. Section 7.01 of the mental hygiene law, as added by  chapter  978
 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
 § 7.01 Declaration of policy.
  The  state of New York and its local governments have a responsibility
 for the prevention and early detection of mental [illness] HEALTH DISOR-
 DERS and for the comprehensively planned care, treatment [and], rehabil-
 itation AND RECOVERY of [their mentally ill citizens] INDIVIDUALS WITH A
 MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS.
  Therefore, it shall be the policy of the state to conduct research and
 to develop programs which further  prevention  and  early  detection  of
 mental  [illness]  HEALTH  DISORDERS;  to develop a comprehensive, inte-
 grated system of treatment [and], rehabilitative AND  RECOVERY  services
 for  [the mentally ill] INDIVIDUALS WITH A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS. Such
 a system should include, whenever possible, the provision  of  necessary
 treatment services to people in their home communities; it should assure
 the  adequacy and appropriateness of residential arrangements for people
 in need of service; and it should rely upon improved programs of  insti-
 tutional  care  only  when  necessary  and  appropriate. Further, such a
 system should recognize the important therapeutic roles  of  all  disci-
 plines  which  may  contribute to the care or treatment of [the mentally
 ill] INDIVIDUALS WITH A MENTAL HEALTH  DIAGNOSIS,  such  as  psychology,
 social  work,  psychiatric  nursing,  special education and other disci-
 plines in the field of mental illness, as well as psychiatry and  should
 establish accountability for implementation of the policies of the state
 with  regard  to  the  care  [and],  rehabilitation AND RECOVERY of [the
 mentally ill] INDIVIDUALS WITH A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS.
 S. 8354  6
 
  To facilitate the implementation of  these  policies  and  to  further
 advance  the  interests  of [the mentally ill] INDIVIDUALS WITH A MENTAL
 HEALTH DIAGNOSIS and their families, a new autonomous agency to be known
 as the office of ADDICTION AND mental health SERVICES  has  been  estab-
 lished  by  this article. The office and its commissioner shall plan and
 work with local governments, voluntary agencies and  all  providers  and
 consumers  of  mental  health services in order to develop an effective,
 integrated, comprehensive system for the delivery  of  all  services  to
 [the  mentally  ill]  INDIVIDUALS  WITH A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS and to
 create financing procedures and mechanisms to support such a  system  of
 services  to  ensure  that  [mentally  ill]  persons in need of services
 receive appropriate care, treatment and rehabilitation  close  to  their
 families  and  communities.  In carrying out these responsibilities, the
 office and its commissioner shall make full use of existing services  in
 the community including those provided by voluntary organizations.
  §  6. Section 19.01 of the mental hygiene law, as added by chapter 223
 of the laws of 1992, is amended to read as follows:
 § 19.01 Declaration of policy.
  The legislature declares the following:
  [Alcoholism] UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE, substance [abuse] USE DISORDER and
 chemical dependence pose major health and social problems  for  individ-
 uals  and  their  families  when left untreated, including family devas-
 tation, homelessness, [and] unemployment, AND DEATH. It has been  proven
 that  successful  prevention  [and], INTEGRATED treatment, AND SUSTAINED
 RECOVERY can dramatically reduce costs  to  the  health  care,  criminal
 justice and social welfare systems.
  The  tragic,  cumulative  and often fatal consequences of [alcoholism]
 UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE and substance [abuse] USE DISORDER  are,  however,
 preventable  and  treatable  disabilities that require a coordinated and
 multi-faceted network of services.
  The legislature recognizes locally planned and implemented  prevention
 as  a primary means to avert the onset of [alcoholism] UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL
 USE and substance [abuse] USE DISORDER. It is the policy of the state to
 promote comprehensive, age appropriate education for children and  youth
 and stimulate public awareness of the risks associated with [alcoholism]
 UNHEALTHY  ALCOHOL  USE and substance [abuse] USE DISORDER. Further, the
 legislature acknowledges the need for a coordinated state policy for the
 establishment of prevention  [and],  treatment,  AND  RECOVERY  programs
 designed  to  address  the  problems of chemical dependency among youth,
 including prevention and intervention efforts in school  and  community-
 based programs designed to identify and refer high risk youth in need of
 chemical dependency services.
  Substantial  benefits  can  be  gained  through [alcoholism] UNHEALTHY
 ALCOHOL USE and  substance  [abuse]  USE  DISORDER  treatment  for  both
 addicted  individuals  and  their  families. Positive treatment outcomes
 that may be generated through a complete continuum of care offer a  cost
 effective  and  comprehensive approach to [rehabilitating] TREATING such
 individuals. The primary goals of  the  [rehabilitation]  TREATMENT  and
 recovery  process  are  to  [restore] REBUILD social, family, lifestyle,
 vocational and economic supports by stabilizing an individual's physical
 and psychological functioning.  The legislature recognizes  the  impor-
 tance  of  varying  treatment  approaches and levels of care designed to
 meet  each  [client's]  INDIVIDUAL'S  needs.  [Relapse]  REOCCURRENCE
 prevention  and  aftercare  are two primary components of treatment that
 serve to promote and maintain recovery.
 S. 8354  7
 
  The legislature  recognizes  that  the  distinct  treatment  needs  of
 special  populations,  including  women and women with children, persons
 with HIV infection, persons [diagnosed] with A mental  [illness]  HEALTH
 DIAGNOSIS, persons who [abuse] MISUSE chemicals, the homeless and veter-
 ans  with  posttraumatic stress disorder, merit particular attention. It
 is the intent of the legislature to promote effective interventions  for
 such  populations  in need of particular attention. The legislature also
 recognizes the importance of family support for individuals  in  alcohol
 or  substance  [abuse]  USE DISORDER treatment and recovery. Such family
 participation can provide lasting support to the  recovering  individual
 to [prevent relapse and maintain] SUPPORT SUSTAINED recovery. The inter-
 generational  cycle of chemical dependency within families can be inter-
 cepted through appropriate interventions.
  The state of New York and its local governments have a  responsibility
 in  coordinating  the delivery of [alcoholism] UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE and
 substance [abuse] USE DISORDER services, through the entire  network  of
 service  providers.  To  accomplish  these  objectives,  the legislature
 declares that the establishment of a single, unified office of [alcohol-
 ism and substance abuse]  ADDICTION  AND  MENTAL  HEALTH  services  will
 provide  an  integrated  framework  to  plan,  oversee  and regulate the
 state's prevention and treatment network. In recognition of the  growing
 trends  and  incidence of chemical dependency, this consolidation allows
 the state to respond to the changing  profile  of  chemical  dependency.
 The  legislature  recognizes  that  some  distinctions exist between the
 [alcoholism] UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE and substance  [abuse]  USE  DISORDER
 field  and  THE  MENTAL  HEALTH  FIELD  AND  where  appropriate,  those
 distinctions may be preserved. Accordingly, it  is  the  intent  of  the
 state  to  establish  one  office  of  [alcoholism  and substance abuse]
 ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH services in furtherance of  a  comprehensive
 service delivery system.
  §  7.  Upon  or prior to January 1, 2025, the governor may nominate an
 individual to serve as commissioner  of  the  office  of  addiction  and
 mental  health  services.  If such individual is confirmed by the senate
 prior to January 1, 2025, they shall  become  the  commissioner  of  the
 office of addiction and mental health services.  The governor may desig-
 nate  a  person to exercise the powers of the commissioner of the office
 of addiction and mental  health  services  on  an  acting  basis,  until
 confirmation  of  a  nominee  by the senate, who is hereby authorized to
 take such actions as are necessary and proper to implement  the  orderly
 transition  of  the  functions,  powers  and  duties as herein provided,
 including the preparation for a budget request for the office as  estab-
 lished by this act.
  §  8.  Upon  the  transfer  pursuant  to this act of the functions and
 powers possessed by and all of the obligations and duties of the  office
 of  mental  health  and the office of addiction services and supports as
 established pursuant to the mental hygiene law and other  laws,  to  the
 office  of  addiction  and  mental health services as prescribed by this
 act, provision shall be made for the transfer of all employees from  the
 office  of  mental  health  and  the  office  of  addiction services and
 supports into the  office  of  addiction  and  mental  health  services.
 Employees  so  transferred shall be transferred without further examina-
 tion or qualification to the same or similar titles and shall remain  in
 the  same  collective bargaining units and shall retain their respective
 civil service classifications, status,  and  rights  pursuant  to  their
 collective bargaining units and collective bargaining agreements.
 S. 8354  8
 
  § 9. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, on or before Octo-
 ber  1, 2024 and annually thereafter, the office of addiction and mental
 health services, in consultation with the department  of  health,  shall
 issue  a report, and post such report on their public website, detailing
 the  office's  expenditures  for  addiction  and mental health services,
 including total Medicaid spending directly by the state to  licensed  or
 designated  providers and payments to managed care providers pursuant to
 section 364-j of the social services law. The office  of  addiction  and
 mental  health  services shall examine reports produced pursuant to this
 section and may make recommendations to the governor and the legislature
 regarding appropriations for addiction and  mental  health  services  or
 other  provisions of law which may be necessary to effectively implement
 the creation and continued operation of the office.
  § 10. Any financial saving realized from the creation of the office of
 addiction and mental health services shall be reinvested in the services
 and supports funded by such office.
  § 11. Severability. If any clause,  sentence,  paragraph,  section  or
 part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdic-
 tion to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate
 the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in  its  operation  to  the
 clause,  sentence,  paragraph, section or part thereof directly involved
 in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.
  § 12. This act shall take effect immediately.  Effective  immediately,
 the  office  of  mental  health and the office of addiction services and
 supports are authorized to promulgate  the  addition,  amendment  and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation or engage in any work necessary for the
 implementation  of  this act on its effective date authorized to be made
 and completed on or before such effective date.
