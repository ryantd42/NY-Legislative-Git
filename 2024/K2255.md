  HONORING  Trooper Richard Albert upon the occasion
  of his designation as Trooper of  the  Year  by  the
  American Association of State Troopers
 
  WHEREAS,  The  quality  and sanctity of community life are cherished
values worthy of safeguarding, and this Legislative  Body  is  moved  to
honor  those  exemplary  public  servants  who  devoted  their  lives to
preserving and protecting such values; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is  justly  proud  to  honor  Trooper
Richard  Albert  upon  the occasion of his designation as Trooper of the
Year by the American Association of State Troopers for the  bravery  and
courage  he exhibited on June 16, 2023, during a high-speed traffic stop
on I-88 in Duanesburg, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within every community of the State of New York  there  are
certain  individuals  who, by virtue of their commitment and dedication,
command  the  respect  and  admiration  of  their  community  for  their
exemplary contributions and service on behalf of others; Trooper Richard
Albert is one such individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The heroic incident occurred on June 16, 2023, as New York
State Trooper Richard Albert was making  a  driver-side  approach  on  a
traffic stop of a recklessly speeding vehicle traveling at 112 miles per
hour; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  Trooper Richard Albert was approaching the vehicle, he
immediately came under fire and was struck by a 9mm round  in  his  left
shoulder;  without  hesitation or concern for his own safety, he reacted
tactically and instinctively, just as he had been trained, retreating to
cover while returning fire; and
 
  WHEREAS, From a position of cover at the rear  of  his  patrol  car,
Trooper  Richard Albert notified the State Police Communications Section
for assistance and calmly and clearly made numerous radio transmissions,
keeping responding troopers updated; and
 
  WHEREAS, Although wounded and  still  under  fire,  Trooper  Richard
Albert  remained  engaged with the suspect and continued to return fire;
the suspect and the operator of the vehicle attempted to flee the scene,
but  a  passing  tractor-trailer  driver  who  witnessed  the  shooting
heroically  turned  his  tractor-trailer  into  the  path of the fleeing
vehicle, successfully disabling it; and
 
  WHEREAS, Utilizing the  terrain  of  the  grassy  median  as  cover,
Trooper  Richard Albert continued his pursuit of the suspects, all while
exchanging  gunfire  and  conducting  magazine  exchanges;  he  remained
engaged  until the shooter had no choice but to flee into the wood line;
and
 
  WHEREAS, After an agonizing 12 minutes, the first  backup  began  to
arrive;  once  numerous  law  enforcement officers were on the scene and
 
Trooper Albert was secured,  the  driver  was  taken  into  custody  and
Trooper Albert was transported to the hospital; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  that fateful day, Trooper Richard Albert showcased his
true bravery under extreme circumstances;  despite  being  under  almost
continuous  gunfire,  he  remained engaged and committed to ensuring the
public's safety; and
 
  WHEREAS, Trooper Richard Albert's heroic actions reflect the highest
ideals of courage and are in keeping with the finest traditions  of  the
New York State Police; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Trooper  Richard  Albert  has distinguished himself by his
exemplary and outstanding performance on behalf of the community  he  so
faithfully and courageously serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
dedicated public servants who unselfishly  devote  their  lives  to  the
preservation  of  order  and the protection of others are worthy and due
full praise for their commitment and noble endeavors; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Trooper  Richard  Albert  upon the occasion of his designation as
Trooper of the Year by the American Association of State  Troopers;  and
be if further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to New York State Trooper Richard Albert.
