  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 4 of section 89 of the  public
 officers  law, as amended by chapter 453 of the laws of 2017, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (c) The court in such a proceeding[:
  (i) may] SHALL assess, against such agency involved, reasonable attor-
 ney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred by such person
 in any case under the provisions of this section in  which  such  person
 has [substantially] prevailed[, and when the agency failed to respond to
 a  request  or  appeal within the statutory time; and (ii) shall assess,
 against such agency involved, reasonable attorney's fees and other liti-
 gation costs reasonably incurred by such person in any  case  under  the
 provisions  of  this  section  in  which  such  person has substantially
 prevailed and the court finds that the agency had  no  reasonable  basis
 for denying access].
  §  2.  Subdivision  2  of  section  107 of the public officers law, as
 amended by chapter 397 of the laws  of  2008,  is  amended  to  read  as

 reasonable attorney fees [may] SHALL be awarded by the  court,  [in  its
 discretion,] to the successful party. [If a court determines that a vote
 was  taken  in  material  violation of this article, or that substantial
 deliberations relating thereto occurred in private prior to  such  vote,
 the  court  shall  award  costs  and  reasonable  attorney's fees to the
 successful petitioner, unless there was a reasonable basis for a  public
 body to believe that a closed session could properly have been held.]
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
