 AND EMPOWERED TO ADOPT AND AMEND A LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING A
 DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IMPOSING MONETARY LIABILITY  ON  THE  OWNER  OF  A
 VEHICLE  FOR  FAILURE OF AN OPERATOR THEREOF TO COMPLY WITH TRAFFIC-CON-
 TROL INDICATIONS IN SUCH TOWN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF  THIS

 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE DISMISSED SOLELY BECAUSE A  PHOTOGRAPH

 CLE, PROVIDED THAT SUCH TOWN HAS MADE A REASONABLE EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH
 THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
  (B) IN ANY SUCH TOWN WHICH HAS ADOPTED A LOCAL LAW OR ORDINANCE PURSU-

 BLE,  WITHIN  THIRTY-SEVEN  DAYS AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE FROM THE TRAFFIC

 SUBDIVISION, THE LESSEE OF SUCH VEHICLE ON THE DATE  OF  SUCH  VIOLATION
 SHALL  BE  DEEMED  TO  BE THE OWNER OF SUCH VEHICLE FOR PURPOSES OF THIS
 SECTION, SHALL BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR THE VIOLATION OF  SUBDIVISION
 (D)  OF  SECTION  ELEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE PURSUANT TO THIS
 SECTION AND SHALL BE SENT A NOTICE OF LIABILITY PURSUANT TO  SUBDIVISION
