  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census data for  the  EMT
 members  assumed  to  join  one  of  the EMT 25-Year Plans is summarized
 below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  7
  - Average Age:  46.7
  - Average Service:  24.6
  - Average Salary:  93,100
 
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: This proposed legislation
 would provide current EMT members, who previously opted out of  the  EMT
 25-Year Plans, a 180-day opportunity to join such plan.
  Members of the EMT 25-Year Plans would be required to pay Basic Member
 Contributions (BMC), which vary by tier, plus Additional Member Contrib-
 utions  (AMC)  equal  to 6.25% of compensation for all service as a Plan
 participant until attaining 30 years of Allowable Service.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of NYCERS.  In addition:
  * Election assumptions and the rates of retirement for the EMT 25-Year
 Plans were assigned based on the bill's provisions including the  eligi-
 bility requirements for retirement under the EMT 25-Year Plans.
  * For purposes of this fiscal note, AMC balances, including physically
 taxing  AMC,  are assumed to offset the AMC payment required to join the
 EMT 25-Year Plan.
  To determine the impact of the elective nature of the proposed  legis-
 lation,  a subgroup of EMT members was developed based on who is assumed
 to benefit actuarially by comparing the  net  present  value  of  future
 employer  costs  of  each  member's benefit under their current plan and
 under the applicable EMT 25-Year Plan.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits). This Fiscal Note does not reflect any  chapter
 laws that may have been enacted during the current legislative session.
