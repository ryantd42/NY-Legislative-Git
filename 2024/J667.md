Office working in the Mount Hope and Washingtonville Police Departments,
then  transferred  to  the City of Peekskill Police Department, where he
proudly served for 22 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Affectionately  known  to  his  Peekskill  colleagues  as
"Jonzee",  Gregory  N.  Jones took great pride in his duty and role as a
police officer, and truly wanted to make his community a better place to
live, work and play; and

and
 
  WHEREAS, Gregory N. Jones will always be remembered  for  his  funny

Shave November, and could often be  found  carrying  around  his  gallon
water jugs and being surrounded by a copious amount of water cups; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Above all, Gregory N. Jones enjoyed spending time with his
cherished family, whether  it  was  coaching  his  son's  sports  teams,
playing  catch  with  his  daughter,  riding  on  his  ATV with his son,

just  being  with them; he was very proud of his children and took every
chance he could to show his love through one of his warm hugs; and

Christine Langbein, Gregory N. Jones is survived by his wife, the former
