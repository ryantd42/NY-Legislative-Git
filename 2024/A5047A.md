  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Paragraph  29  of subsection (a) of section 1113 of the
 insurance law, as added by chapter 65 of the laws of 1998, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (29) "Legal  services  insurance"  means  insurance  [providing  legal
 services  or  reimbursement  of the cost of legal services] THAT PAYS OR
 REIMBURSES FOR SPECIFIED LEGAL SERVICES OR SPECIFIED LEGAL EXPENSES,  IN

 THE PROVISION OF LEGAL SERVICES, WHERE THE ORGANIZATION PAYS  THE  INDE-
 PENDENT ATTORNEY ONLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE AND THE INDEPENDENT ATTORNEY
 RECEIVES  NO  ADDITIONAL  PAYMENT OR REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE ORGANIZATION
 FOR SPECIFIED LEGAL SERVICES OR SPECIFIED LEGAL EXPENSES.

 have become a law.
