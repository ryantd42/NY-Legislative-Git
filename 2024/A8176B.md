 AN ACT to amend the penal law, in relation to prohibiting the  operation
  of unmanned aircraft over school grounds or critical infrastructure
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The New York state  legis-
 lature finds and declares that protecting the safety and security of our
 schools  and  our critical infrastructure facilities is of utmost impor-
 tance. It is the intent of the legislature to respond to developments in
 technology to ensure that new  technologies  do  not  pose  unreasonable
 risks  to our school children or our critical infrastructure facilities.
 Unmanned aircraft  are  often  equipped  with  surveillance  technology,
 including  photograph  and  video  capabilities.  Thus, the operation of
 unmanned aircraft has the potential to infringe on the  privacy  of  the
 students,  teachers, and staff on school grounds. Further, the operation
 of unmanned aircraft can pose a risk to the safety and security of  both
 schools  and  critical  infrastructure facilities. Aerial photographs or
 videos of school grounds or critical infrastructure could equip  nefari-
 ous  actors  with  information about the location of critical equipment,
 entry and exit points, or the precise location of staff and, if applica-
 ble, students at a given time of day. Given these substantial risks, the
 legislature finds that an unmanned aircraft that remains above or hovers
 above school grounds or critical infrastructure without  permission  can
 be  presumed to be performing surveillance and, as such, poses an unrea-
 sonable security risk. It is  not  the  intent  of  the  legislature  to
