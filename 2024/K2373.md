  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2024, as Farmers Market Appreciation  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  2024,  as  Farmers  Market
Appreciation Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Farmers'  markets  provide consumers with access to a wide
range of high quality, nutritious, farm fresh  and  processed  New  York
State agricultural and food products; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Farmers'  markets  build  links  in New York State between
upstate and downstate, rural and urban communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Farmers' markets bring healthy eating to neighborhoods that
lack fresh foods, and to many individuals who  might  not  otherwise  be
able to afford quality produce; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Farmers'  markets  provide affordable, convenient, healthy
food, as well as  increased  access  to  fresh  fruits  and  vegetables,
thereby promoting health and fighting childhood obesity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Local  food  supports  the  local  economy; it keeps local
family farms in business, and family farms generally buy local; and
 
  WHEREAS, Farmers' markets contribute to the economic  revitalization
of the areas in which the markets are located; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Local  food  builds  community;  when  an  individual buys
directly from a farmer, they learn where their food comes from, engaging
in a time-honored connection between grower and consumer; and
 
  WHEREAS, Farmers' markets promote  food  safety  by  humanizing  the
connections  between  growers  and  consumers  and  promoting  local,
sustainable farming; and
 
  WHEREAS, Talking with farmers educates consumers about the  seasons,
the  land,  and  farming; farmers' markets create a place where families
with children or grandchildren can learn about nature  and  agriculture;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Local  food  preserves genetic diversity, as smaller local
farms grow many different varieties to provide a  long  harvest  season;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Local farms preserve open space; farmers who improve their
bottom line by marketing locally can afford to stay in their  farms  and
are less likely to sell their farmland for development; and
 
  WHEREAS, Well-managed farms conserve fertile soil and clean water in
our communities; the farm environment is a patchwork of fields, meadows,
woods, ponds, and buildings that provide habitat for wildlife; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Local  foods that travel short distances use significantly
less energy; for example, it takes 435 fossil-fuel  calories  to  fly  a
five-calorie strawberry from California to New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Local food is an investment in the future; supporting local
farmers ensures that there will be farms in your community tomorrow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Farmers'  markets  help to develop local and regional food
systems that  support  family  farms,  revitalize  communities,  provide
opportunities  for  farmers  and  consumers  to  interact,  promote
environmental sustainability, and support our economy in New York State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim June 2024, as Farmers
Market Appreciation Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
