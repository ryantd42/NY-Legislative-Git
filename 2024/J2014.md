  HONORING Neuberger Museum of Art upon the occasion
  of its 50th Anniversary and upon the occasion of its
  designation  as  recipient  of  the  2024  Arts
  Organization Award by ArtsWestchester
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute  to
those  organizations  of  artistic  significance  whose  creative
contributions  have  helped  further  the  cultural  enrichment  of  our
communities and our Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Neuberger Museum of Art upon the occasion of its  50th  Anniversary  and
upon  the  occasion  of  its  designation  as recipient of the 2024 Arts
Organization Award by ArtsWestchester; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  annual  Arts  Awards  have  been  presented  by
ArtsWestchester  since  1976  to recognize individuals and organizations
whose vision, commitment, and leadership have enriched the cultural life
of Westchester, its communities, and its citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Arts Organization Award recognizes a Westchester County
non-profit arts organization that has made  important  contributions  to
the  growth of Westchester's cultural life over a significant period and
has had an impact beyond its immediate community; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Neuberger Museum of  Art  (NEU)  was  founded  in  1969
through  the  generosity  of  private art collector, philanthropist, and
arts  advocate,  Roy  R.  Neuberger,  who  promised  300  paintings  and
sculptures  as  the  founding  gift  for  a  new  museum  that  would be
established to showcase  visual  arts  education  on  a  public  college
campus; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  museum  is located on the campus of Purchase College,
State University of New York, and opened in 1974, with 2024 marking  the
50th Anniversary of the museum; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Neuberger Museum of Art's collection has grown to over
6,500 objects, with the works in the permanent collection  belonging  to
the  citizens  of  the  State  of  New York; proof of dedication to this
sentiment is that admission is always free; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the years,  hundreds  of  dedicated  Volunteer  Museum
Educators  have  enriched  the experiences of visiting guests by leading
tours and guiding their discussions of the art and artists on view; and
 
  WHEREAS, Priceless in its impact, thousands of local  schoolchildren
across  Westchester and surrounding counties have been introduced to the
visual arts at the NEU; groups  from  Title  1  schools  in  Westchester
County  are also eligible to receive free transportation, admission, and
lunch through the NEUKids Program, ensuring accessibility  to  the  arts
for all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Further proving its commitment to visual art accessibility
for all, the museum also hosts NEU Vitality Art Workshops which provides
art education experiences designed specifically for adults over the ages
of 55; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Neuberger Museum's signature biannual award, the Roy R.
Neuberger  Prize,  recognizes  the  work  of  exceptional  contemporary
artists, continuing  our  founding  patron's  dedication  to  supporting
artists early in their career; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A group of generous community members known as the Friends
of the Neuberger Museum of Art has, for more than  52  years,  supported
the museum and ensured that it continues to grow and evolve; the Friends
organization  clearly  demonstrates  the  significant  impact a group of
dedicated community members can have in supporting the  museum  and  the
cultural life of Westchester County and the State at large; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Purchase College students, faculty, and staff, embrace The
Neuberger Museum as part of the campus' rich cultural experience; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is most fitting that we take time to celebrate the  arts
of  our Nation, to honor our artists, and to express our appreciation to
everyone who patronizes the arts; as we celebrate the arts, we celebrate
and give thanks to our American freedom, the only  atmosphere  in  which
artists can truly create and in which art is truly the expression of the
soul; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor the Neuberger  Museum  of  Art  upon  the  occasion  of  its  50th
Anniversary and upon the occasion of its designation as recipient of the
2024 Arts Organization Award by ArtsWestchester; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Neuberger Museum of Art.
