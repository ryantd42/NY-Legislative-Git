 law,  as  amended  by  chapter  252 of the laws of 1977, and the opening
 paragraph as amended by chapter 749 of the laws of 1991, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  5.  After  the  filing  of  a draft environmental impact statement the
 agency shall determine whether or not to conduct a public hearing on the
 environmental impact of the proposed action. If the agency determines to
 hold such a hearing, it shall commence the hearing within [sixty] THIRTY
 days of the filing and unless the  proposed  action  is  withdrawn  from
 consideration  shall  prepare  the environmental impact statement within
 [forty-five] THIRTY days after the  close  of  the  hearing,  except  as

 process with other procedures relating to  review  and  approval  of  an
 action.  An application for a permit or authorization for an action upon
 which a  draft  environmental  impact  statement  is  determined  to  be

 content and adequacy for purposes of  [paragraph]  SUBDIVISION  four  of

 provided for preparation, review and public hearings with respect to the
 draft environmental impact statement.
