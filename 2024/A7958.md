 Introduced  by M. of A. SIMON -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Energy
 
 AN ACT to amend the energy law,  the  public  service  law,  the  public
  authorities law and the rural electric cooperative law, in relation to
  establishing the "New York grid modernization act"

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York grid modernization act".
  §  2. Legislative findings and purpose. The legislature finds that the
 widely acknowledged bottlenecks in the state's aging infrastructure have
 resulted in high delivery costs for the downstate region and  struggling
 power  plants  upstate.  This outdated transmission system is leading to
 unnecessary congestion costs. Additionally, increasingly frequent  trau-
 matic  weather events have highlighted the unreliability and uncertainty
 of our current system. Investments to modernize the state's  infrastruc-
 ture  are needed to reach our energy goals as society's growing reliance
 on electricity along with advancements in  smart  grid  technology  have
 made the old model obsolete.
  The  legislature  further  finds  and recognizes that as the available
 resources and technologies evolve, the design of the smart grid must  be
 capable of adapting to shifting conditions and priorities to meet utili-
 ty and customer needs. In the short term, utilities should pursue estab-
 lished  and  reliable technologies that can provide a relatively certain
 return on investment.
  In the longer term, federal investment has  provided  for  smart  grid
 projects nationwide, which will generate a significant base of knowledge
 that will help identify technologies that are most effective.
  The legislature also finds that half of the current workforce involved
 in  the production and delivery of our electricity will be retired or no
 longer in that  workforce  within  the  next  several  years.  Workforce
 recruitment campaigns developed by utilities, in conjunction with train-
 ing  facilities  that  provide  certification  for skilled positions and

 instrumental in the implementation of a modernized electric grid.
  § 3. Section 6-102 of the energy law is amended by adding a new subdi-
 vision 7 to read as follows:
