 Rockville  Centre  school district shall be deemed to have been a member

 utions  she made under Tier 3 as well as her prior service payment.  Ms.

 of  liabilities  plus  retroactive  monthly  payments, and the refund of
 member contributions and prior service payments, which is  estimated  to
 be $248,000. This cost is to be borne by the employers of members of the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System.
