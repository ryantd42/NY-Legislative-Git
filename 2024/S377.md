  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and  intent.  The  legislature  hereby
 finds that deeming by owners of charges to residential tenants for elec-
 tric  service  to  be  rent  is not in the public interest and should be
 prohibited.

 to read as follows:
  §  75-A.  DEFENSE  IN  CASE OF CHARGES FOR RESIDENTIAL UTILITY SERVICE
 DEEMED TO BE RENT. IN AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY  COURT  FOR
 POSSESSION  OF  REAL PROPERTY BY REASON OF UNPAID CHARGES CLAIMED BY THE
 OWNER OR HIS OR HER AGENT FOR UTILITY SERVICE,  IF  IT  IS  ALLEGED  AND
 ESTABLISHED  THAT  CHARGES FOR UTILITY SERVICE TO ANY RESIDENTIAL TENANT
 ARE DEEMED TO BE RENT UNDER THE TERMS OF ANY  ARRANGEMENT  OR  AGREEMENT
 RELATING  TO  RENTAL  OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY, NO RECOVERY OF POSSESSION
 SHALL BE HAD THEREIN, AND THE FACT THAT CHARGES FOR UTILITY SERVICE  FOR
 RESIDENTIAL  USE  ARE  DEEMED  TO BE RENT SHALL BE A COMPLETE DEFENSE TO
 SUCH ACTION.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
