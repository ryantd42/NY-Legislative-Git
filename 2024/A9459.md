 follows:
  c. are related to recovery of an overpayment of wages where such over-
 payment is due to a mathematical or other clerical error by the  employ-

 lations  promulgated  by  the  commissioner  for  this  purpose,  which
 regulations  shall include, but not be limited to, provisions governing:

 timing, frequency, duration, and method of such recovery; limitations on
 the  periodic  amount  of  such  recovery;  a requirement that notice be
 provided to the employee prior to the commencement of such  recovery;  a
 requirement  that  the  employer implement a procedure for disputing the
 amount of such overpayment or seeking  to  delay  commencement  of  such
 recovery;  the  terms  and content of such a procedure and a requirement
 that notice of the procedure for disputing the overpayment or seeking to
 delay commencement of such recovery be provided to the employee prior to
 the commencement of such recovery. RECOVERY OF WAGES DUE TO  A  CLERICAL
 ERROR BY THE EMPLOYER OR ANY VENDOR WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYER IS

 OTHER INACCURACY IN THE AMOUNT OF WAGES PAID OR THE TIME IN WHICH  WAGES
 WERE DISPERSED.
