crimes; and
 
  WHEREAS, The victim assistance community  faces  new  challenges  to
reach  and  serve  all  victims,  including  victims  of new crimes like

youth,  individuals  involved  in sex work, individuals who are lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning, and individuals who may have
been victims of criminal conduct by law enforcement officers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Important  new  frameworks  and  initiatives  are  being
developed  and  implemented to ensure the availability of comprehensive,
culturally  relevant,  trauma-informed,  and  restorative  services  and
treatment  to  help  victims  begin healing and to assist communities in
maintaining community safety for all, and these new approaches are to be
commended and fully supported; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Crime  Victims'  Rights Week, April 21-27, 2024,
