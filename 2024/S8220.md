 AN ACT to amend the education law and the  public  authorities  law,  in
  relation  to  the  availability  and  purchase of zero-emission school
  buses
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 3638 of the education law, as added by section 1 of
 subpart  A of part B of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, subdivision 7 as
 added by section 19 of part A of chapter 56 of  the  laws  of  2023,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  §  3638.  Zero-emission  school  buses.  1.  For  the purposes of this
 section "zero-emission school bus" shall mean  a  school  bus  that:  is
 propelled  by  an  electric motor and associated power electronics which
 provide acceleration torque to the drive wheels  during  normal  vehicle
 operations  and  draws electricity from a hydrogen fuel cell or battery;
 or otherwise operates without direct emission of atmospheric pollutants.
  2. [(a) No later than July first,  two  thousand  twenty-seven,  every
 school district shall:
  (i)  only purchase or lease zero-emission school buses when purchasing
 or leasing new buses;
  (ii) include requirements in any procurement for school transportation
 services that any contractors providing transportation services for  the
 school  district  must only purchase or lease zero-emission school buses
 when purchasing or leasing new school buses; and
  (iii) include requirements in any procurement for the manufacturing or
 retrofitting of a zero-emission  school  bus  and  charging  or  fueling
 infrastructure  that  the  components  and parts used or supplied in the
 performance of the contract or any subcontract thereto shall be produced
 or made in whole or substantial part in the United States, its  territo-
 ries  or possessions and that final assembly of the zero-emission school
 bus and charging or fueling infrastructure shall  occur  in  the  United
 States, its territories or possessions.

  (b)  The  commissioner, in consultation with the New York state energy
 research and development authority and office of general  services,  may
 waive  the  contracting  requirements set forth in subparagraph (iii) of
 paragraph (a) of this subdivision if the  commissioner  determines  that
 the  requirements  would  not be in the public interest, would result in
 unreasonable costs, or that obtaining such  zero-emission  school  buses
 and  charging  or  fueling  infrastructure  components  and parts in the
 United States would increase the cost of a  school  district's  contract
 for zero-emission school buses and charging or fueling infrastructure by
 an unreasonable amount, or such zero-emission school busses and charging
 or fueling infrastructure components and parts cannot be produced, made,
 or assembled in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available
 quantities  or  of satisfactory quality. Such determination must be made
 on an annual basis no later than December thirty-first, after  providing
 notice  and  an  opportunity  for  public  comment, and be made publicly
 available, in writing, on  the  department's  website  with  a  detailed
 explanation  of  the  findings  leading  to  such  determination. If the
 commissioner has issued determinations for three consecutive years  that
 no such waiver is warranted pursuant to this paragraph, then the commis-
 sioner  shall no longer be required to provide the annual determinations
 required by this paragraph.
  3.] No later than July first, two thousand  [thirty-five]  FORTY-FIVE,
 OR  UNTIL  ALL  STATE  AGENCIES HAVE TRANSITIONED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF
 THEIR MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLE FLEETS TO  ZERO-EMISSION  VEHICLES,
 WHICHEVER  IS  LATER,  UNLESS A ZERO-EMISSION SCHOOL BUS IS NOT FEASIBLE
 FOR A PARTICULAR  APPLICATION  AS  DETERMINED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER  IN
 CONSULTATION WITH THE NEW YORK STATE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR, UTILI-
 TIES, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE, every school district shall:

 PURCHASE OR LEASE ZERO-EMISSION SCHOOL BUSES WHEN PURCHASING OR  LEASING
 NEW BUSES;
  (b)  include requirements in any procurement for school transportation
 services that any contractors providing transportation services for  the
 school  district  must  only  [operate  zero-emission  school buses when
 providing such transportation services to the school district]  PURCHASE
 OR  LEASE  ZERO-EMISSION  SCHOOL  BUSES  WHEN  PURCHASING OR LEASING NEW
 SCHOOL BUSES; AND
  (C) INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS IN ANY PROCUREMENT FOR THE  MANUFACTURING  OR
 RETROFITTING OF A ZERO-EMISSION  SCHOOL  BUS  AND  CHARGING  OR  FUELING
 INFRASTRUCTURE  THAT  THE  COMPONENTS  AND PARTS USED OR SUPPLIED IN THE
 PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT OR ANY SUBCONTRACT THERETO SHALL BE PRODUCED
 OR  MADE IN WHOLE OR SUBSTANTIAL PART IN THE UNITED STATES, ITS TERRITO-
 RIES  OR POSSESSIONS AND THAT FINAL ASSEMBLY OF THE ZERO-EMISSION SCHOOL
 BUS AND CHARGING OR FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE SHALL  OCCUR  IN  THE  UNITED
 STATES, ITS TERRITORIES OR POSSESSIONS.
  [4.  A  school district may apply to the commissioner, and the depart-
 ment may grant a one-time] 3. THE COMMISSIONER, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE
 SCHOOL DISTRICT BUSINESS OFFICIAL, SHALL COMPLETE A COST-BENEFIT  ANALY-

 er  impacted  by  the  proposed  purchase  or  lease  who  agrees  to be
 retrained.
  (c) Prior to the beginning of the procurement process for new zero-em-
 ission school buses, omnibuses,  vehicles,  charging  infrastructure  or
 equipment,  fueling infrastructure or equipment, or other equipment, the
 school district, private school bus company,  or  other  employer  whose
 workers  provide  pupil  transportation  services  or services attendant

 number of positions expected to  be  created  at  the  school  district,
 private school bus company or other employer whose workers provide pupil
 transportation  services  or  services attendant thereto by the proposed
 purchase or lease over the intended life of  the  proposed  purchase  or
 lease;  (ii) identifies gaps in skills of its current workforce that are
 needed to operate and maintain zero-emission  school  buses,  omnibuses,
 vehicles,  charging  infrastructure or equipment, fueling infrastructure
 or equipment, or other equipment; (iii) includes a comprehensive plan to

 workers covered by this section shall inform its  employees'  collective
 bargaining  representative  of  any  potential  impact on its members or
 unit, including positions that may be affected, altered,  or  eliminated
 as a result of the purchase.
  [6.]  5.  When  purchasing  zero-emission school buses and charging or
 fueling infrastructure, school districts are encouraged to  utilize  the
 centralized  contracts  for  zero  emission school buses and charging or
 fueling infrastructure established by the office of general services.
  [7.] 6. Beginning in the two thousand twenty-four--two thousand  twen-
 ty-five  school year, every school district shall annually submit to the
 commissioner a progress report on the  implementation  of  zero-emission
 school  buses  as  required under this section in a format prescribed by
 the commissioner and approved by the director of the budget. The  report

 services in the current school year and the total anticipated number for
 the next two years. The progress report shall be due on or before August
 first of each year. Beginning October first, two  thousand  twenty-four,
 the  commissioner  shall  annually  submit a report to the governor, the
 temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assembly on the
 progress of implementation of zero-emission school buses as reported  by
 the school districts.
