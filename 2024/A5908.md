 and who, for reasons not ascribable to her  own  negligence,  failed  to

 system on September 16, 2010, shall be deemed to have been a  member  of
 such  retirement  system  with  Tier 5 status on and after September 16,

 this act shall be borne by the state of New York.

 formerly employed by the New York State Department  of  Corrections  and
 Community Supervision, by changing their date of membership to September
