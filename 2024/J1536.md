  LEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION memorializing Governor Kathy
  Hochul  to  proclaim  January 18, 2024, as Thesaurus
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside to increase important awareness of
initiatives that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  18,  2024,  as
Thesaurus  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the
observance of National Thesaurus Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Written by Peter Mark Roget, the Thesaurus  is  a  book  of
words  or  information  about  a  particular  field  or  set of concepts
especially a book of words and their synonyms; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on January 18, 1779, Peter Mark Roget retired  from  a
successful  career in medicine and spent the rest of his life working on
Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases which  was  published  in
1852; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Roget's  Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases originally
contained  15,000  words  organized  into  five  primary  categories:
existence,  relation,  quantity,  number,  and  time; today, the book is
still organized by ideas and  concepts  as  opposed  to  alphabetically,
however, it now includes more than 230,000 words; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  Thesaurus  Day, New Yorkers are encouraged to take out
their Thesaurus, use some  new  words,  and  stretch  their  vocabulary;
expanding  your  vocabulary  has  actually  been  shown to have positive
health effects, and a powerful vocabulary can  help  an  individual  get
ahead in their life and career; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition,  this  day  is  a  good one to remember that
language is the key to knowledge, and knowledge is the key to the world;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  January 18, 2024, as
Thesaurus Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
