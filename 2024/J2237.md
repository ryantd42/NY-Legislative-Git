  HONORING  Firefighter  James P. O'Donnell upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  65  years  of  service  to the Sea Cliff Fire
  Department on April 19, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
James  P.  O'Donnell  upon  the  occasion of his designation for special
recognition after 65 years of service to the Sea Cliff Fire  Department,
to  be  recognized  at  the  Department Dinner on April 19, 2024, at the
Crescent Beach Club in Bayville, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, James P.  O'Donnell  joined  the  Enterprise  Hose  Co.  on
January  13,  1959,  and  achieved  the  rank of 2nd Lieutenant in 1966,
before transferring to the Hook & Ladder Company in 1969; and
 
  WHEREAS, This dedicated fireman went on to  hold  the  positions  of
Warden  from 1980 to 2015, Treasurer from 1982 to 2015, and Chief Driver
of the Ladder from 1981 to 2015; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighter  James  P.  O'Donnell,  as  a  result  of  his
dedication  and pride in upholding the honorable values and practices of
those volunteer firefighters which so valiantly  serve  this  State  and
Nation, was awarded Fireman of the Year in 1979; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State
with pride, valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers  are  often
the  first  to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire,
transportation accident, natural disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
James P.  O'Donnell is one such firefighter;  throughout  65  years  of
devoted  service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond
the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor  Firefighter  James  P.  O'Donnell  upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation for special recognition after 65 years of service to the Sea
Cliff Fire Department on April 19, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter James P. O'Donnell.
