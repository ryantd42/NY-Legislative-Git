  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing an amendment to section 4 of article 4 of the constitution, in
  relation  to prohibiting the governor from granting himself or herself
  or any person involved with furthering  the  illegal  conduct  of  the
  governor a reprieve, commutation or pardon
 
  Section  1. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 4 of arti-
 cle 4 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 4. The governor shall have the  power  to  grant  reprieves,  commu-
 tations  and  pardons  after conviction, for all offenses except treason
 and  cases  of  impeachment,  upon  such  conditions  and  with  such
 restrictions  and limitations, as he or she may think proper, subject to
 such regulations as may be provided by law relative  to  the  manner  of
 applying  for  pardons. THE GOVERNOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO GRANT A
 REPRIEVE, COMMUTATION OR PARDON TO HIMSELF OR HERSELF, OR TO ANY PERSONS
 INVOLVED WITH FURTHERING ANY ILLEGAL OR UNLAWFUL CONDUCT OF SUCH  GOVER-
 NOR.  Upon  conviction  for  treason,  the  governor shall have power to
 suspend the execution of the sentence, until the case shall be  reported
 to  the  legislature  at  its  next  meeting, when the legislature shall
 either pardon, or commute the sentence,  direct  the  execution  of  the
 sentence,  or  grant  a  further  reprieve.  The governor shall annually
 communicate to the legislature each case  of  reprieve,  commutation  or
 pardon  granted, stating the name of the convict, the crime of which the
 convict was convicted, the sentence and its date, and the  date  of  the
 commutation, pardon or reprieve.
  §  2.  Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That the foregoing amendment
 be referred  to  the  first regular legislative session convening  after
 the  next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly, and,
 in conformity  with  section 1 of  article 19 of  the constitution,  be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
