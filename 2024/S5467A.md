 correction/sanitation  revised  plan  member  or an investigator revised
 plan member who retires with twenty-two years  of  credited  service  or
 less may become eligible for annual escalation of the service retirement

  FISCAL NOTE.-Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Sections 505,
 511, and 516 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to  elimi-
 nate  the  offset equal to 50% of the primary social security benefit in
 the service, early service, and vested retirement benefits  for  Tier  3
 original,  modified, and enhanced plan members of the New York City Fire
 Pension Fund (FIRE).
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: Currently, the Tier 3 normal  service  retirement,
 early  service retirement, and vested retirement benefits are subject to
 an offset equal to 50% of the primary social security benefit as defined
 in RSSL Section 511 beginning at age 62.  Under  the  proposed  legis-
 lation, the offset for such benefits would be eliminated resulting in an
 increase in benefits.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT:  Based on the census data and the actuarial assump-
 tions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of  this  proposed
 legislation  would result in an initial increase in the Present Value of
 Future Benefits (PVFB) and the present value of future employer contrib-
 utions of approximately $94.4 million.
  The  financial  impact  will  increase  as  the  impacted  populations
 increase  over  time.  The  estimate  of the increase in annual employer
 contributions for Fiscal Years 2024 through 2028 are shown in the  table
 below.
 
  Fiscal  Increase in Employer
  Year  Contributions
  ($ Millions)
  2024  $6.4
  2025  $7.1
  2026  $7.9
  2027  $8.6
  2028  $9.3
 
  New  Unfunded  Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to benefit changes
 are generally amortized over the remaining  working  lifetime  of  those
 impacted by the benefit changes. The remaining working lifetime for this
 group  is  approximately  19 years and the increase in UAL was therefore
 amortized over a 19-year period (18  payments  under  the  One-Year  Lag
 Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data to be used in the June 30, 2022  actuarial  valuation  of  FIRE  to
 determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The  4,469 active FIRE Tier 3 members as of June 30, 2022 had an aver-
 age age of approximately 32.9 years, average  service  of  approximately
 5.2 years, and an average salary of approximately $106,300.
 S. 5467  4
 
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated  based  on  the actuarial assumptions and methods to be
 used for the Preliminary Fiscal  Year  2024  employer  contributions  of
 FIRE.  New  entrants were projected to replace the members expected to
 leave  the  active population to maintain a steady-state population. New
 entrant demographics were developed based on data for recent  new  hires
 and actuarial judgement.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of  FIRE  used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  * The  initial,  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  * Pension costs for future members of FIRE hired on or after 7/1/2026.
  *  Cost  analyses  relating  to  provisions  contained in RSSL Section
 500(c).
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: I, Marek  Tyszkiewicz,  am  the  Chief
 Actuary  for,  and  independent of, the New York City Retirement Systems
 and Pension Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries  and  a
 Member  of  the  American Academy of Actuaries. I meet the Qualification
 Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries to render  the  actuarial

  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note  2023-02  dated  February

 Pension Fund. This estimate is intended for use  only  during  the  2023
