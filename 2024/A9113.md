  h-1.  Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the contra-
 ry, any member who had an active membership in the New  York  state  and
 local  employees'  retirement  system  or  the  New York state teachers'
 retirement system, when such member participated in World  Trade  Center

 YORK  STATE  TEACHERS'  RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  AT  THE TIME SUCH INDIVIDUAL

 ER  IN  THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR THE
 NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS' RETIREMENT SYSTEM, AND who incurred a  qualify-
 ing  World  Trade  Center  condition,  as defined in section two of this
 chapter, that is determined to have been incurred in the performance and
 discharge of duty and is the natural and proximate result of an accident
 not caused by such member's own willful  negligence,  shall  be  paid  a
 performance of duty disability retirement allowance equal to three-quar-
 ters  of  final  average  salary.  The  payment of such pension shall be
 subject to the provisions of section sixty-four of this chapter.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend the benefits of certain members of the New  York
 State and Local Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS) who are currently
 subject  to the provisions of Article 14 or Article 15 of the Retirement
 and Social Security Law, who contract any form of disease or  disability
 related  to  exposure to any elements in connection with the World Trade
 Center (WTC) rescue, recovery or cleanup operations, AND  WHO  WERE  NOT
 MEMBERS  OF  SUCH PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEMS AT THE TIME OF PARTICIPATION
 IN SAID OPERATIONS.  The annual accidental disability benefit  would  be
 75  percent  of  a  member's  final average salary less workers' compen-
 sation, regardless of plan coverage. Currently, eligible members receive
 the accidental disability benefit specified in the plan under which they
 are covered, which for most Article 14 and 15 members is  1/3  of  final
 average  salary.  This improved benefit would be payable only to current
 members with at least ten years of credited  service.  Current  retirees
 and their beneficiaries would not be affected by this bill.
  Insofar  as  this bill would affect NYSLERS, the cost will depend upon
 the applicant's age, service, salary, plan, and any benefit type  other-
 wise payable, but is expected to cost up to 4 times final average salary
 per applicant.
  Approximately  50  active  NYSLERS  members, with a combined salary of
 approximately $4.5 million as of March 31, 2023, have filed an  Applica-
 tion  for WTC Notice and been rejected on the grounds that they were not
 members at the time of their participation in certain WTC rescue, recov-
 ery or cleanup operations. However, the actual  number  of  members  who
 could  be  affected  by  this  legislation cannot be readily determined.
 Pursuant to Section 25 of the Retirement and Social Security Law,  those
 costs arising in the NYSLERS would be borne by the State of New York.
