 affected entities and issue targets to achieve greater compliance.
  7.  Reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  (a) By 2030 and thereafter,
 subject to available supply, 100 percent  of  the  electricity  used  by
 affected entities for their own operations, except electricity needed to
 support  the  generation of electricity by an affected entity in accord-
 ance with its enabling authority, shall come from  energy  systems  that
 are eligible under the CES ("eligible systems") as part of an all-of-go-
 vernment approach to meet the goals of the climate leadership and commu-
 nity protection act in a cost-effective manner.
  (i)  Each affected entity shall first count the amount of clean energy
 generated by eligible systems across the state that the affected  entity
 pays  for  in its electricity bills or otherwise towards compliance with
 the CES, based on calculations provided by the  New  York  state  energy
 research  and  development  authority.  Affected  entities shall provide
 information requested by the New York state energy research and develop-
 ment authority to perform the applicable  calculations,  including  load
 data, CES compliance payments, and any other necessary information.
  (ii)  For the remainder of its electricity usage, each affected entity
 shall next be required to demonstrate  meeting  this  obligation,  where
 feasible,  through the use of on- or off-site eligible systems providing
 energy dedicated to the affected entity's operations.
  (iii) For the portion of electricity that cannot  be  served  by  such
 eligible systems, each affected entity shall, in consultation and agree-
 ment  with  the New York state energy research and development authority
 and the department of public service, procure renewable  energy  certif-
 icates ("RECs") qualified under a qualifying tier of the CES.
  (iv)  The New York state energy research and development authority and
 the department of public service shall establish further detailed guide-
 lines and requirements with respect to how each  affected  entity  shall
 comply and report compliance with this subdivision.

 the New York state energy research and  development  authority  and  the
 department  of  public service shall make adjustments to this obligation
 as needed based on statewide progress  towards  climate  leadership  and
 community protection act mandates.
  (b) To the fullest extent feasible, beginning January 1, 2024, all new
 construction  submitted  for permitting by affected entities shall avoid
 infrastructure, building systems or equipment that can be used  for  the
 combustion of fossil fuels, excluding the necessary use for backup emer-
 gency  generation  and  process  loads,  provided that affected entities
 shall avoid the use of backup emergency diesel generators where  practi-
 cable.  This shall not affect the continued operation and maintenance of
 state or affected entity owned or operated electric  generating  facili-
 ties. The council shall monitor progress towards this goal.
  (c) Affected entities shall achieve 11 trillion BTUs of energy savings
 at their facilities by 2025 as outlined in the BuildSmart 2025 program.
  (i)  Each affected entity shall work with the New York power authority
 to achieve their allotted portion of  the  overall  savings  target  for
 state  operations.  Affected entities should consult the BuildSmart 2025
 program guidelines for types of  projects  and  programs  to  undertake,
 including  master  planning, operations and maintenance program develop-
 S. 5180--A  6
 
 ment, participation in demand response and similar  programs,  submeter-
 ing, LED lighting, and other projects that reduce energy consumption and
 enhance building efficiency.
  (ii) Prior to 2025, the council shall issue a 2030 energy savings goal
 based  on  an evaluation of progress towards the 2025 goal and the addi-
 tional opportunities that  remain  for  cost-effective  energy  savings.
 Such  2030  goal  shall  be  aligned with the most recent version of the
 state's scoping plan  developed  pursuant  the  climate  leadership  and
 community protection act.
  (d)  The  council  shall issue operational directives and guidance for
 common construction materials to reduce the amount of embodied carbon in
 such materials. Starting January 1, 2024, affected entities  shall  seek
 to  reduce  the  embodied carbon in all new construction or construction
 projects consisting of adaptive reuse or  significant  renovations  that
 cost  greater than 50 percent of the cost of new construction, submitted
 for permitting by affected entities, by taking the following actions:
  (i) design teams shall calculate the total embodied carbon  that  will
 result  from  the  project,  including  shipping,  transportation,  and
 construction equipment requirements; and
  (ii) bidders shall be required to submit environmental product  decla-
 rations  when  available,  that include the amount of embodied carbon in
 given building materials.
  (e) Affected entities shall have 100 percent of their light-duty  non-
 emergency  vehicle  fleets  be zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2035 and
 100 percent of their medium- and heavy-duty vehicle  fleet  be  ZEVs  by
 2040.
  (i)  All  affected entities shall create and file a light-duty vehicle
 fleet decarbonization plan and a medium- and heavy-duty  decarbonization
 plan  with  the  council. The council shall provide technical assistance
 and guidance to agencies for the development of  decarbonization  plans.
 Such  decarbonization  plans  shall  include,  at minimum, the following
 elements:
  (A) a purchasing plan that includes interim targets for how they  will
 achieve the fleet decarbonization goals of this act; and
  (B)  a  plan for providing staff training and engagement necessary for
 the successful decarbonization of their fleet.
  (ii) Affected entities shall file such light-duty vehicle fleet decar-
 bonization plans with the council within one year of the effective  date
 of  this  act and shall file such medium- and heavy-duty decarbonization
 plans with the council within three years of the effective date of  this
 act.
  (iii)  Affected  entities  shall file progress updates to their light-
 and medium- and heavy-duty vehicle  decarbonization  plans  every  three
 years after the filing of their first plan.
  (iv)  Priority  shall be given to purchasing battery electric vehicles
 and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and if they are not practicable for  an
 affected  entity's  needs,  then plug-in hybrid electric vehicles may be
 considered in limited circumstances as specifically  authorized  by  the
 council.
  (v)  Affected entities that operate emergency vehicles shall, at least
 annually, evaluate and test various ZEV  technologies  to  determine  if
 they can meet the use cases for these vehicles.
  (vi)  Affected  entities  shall  consult  with  the  office of general
 services to develop ZEV charging infrastructure for  their  fleets.  The
 office  of general services shall provide guidance to agencies and coor-
 dinate the phased implementation of ZEV charging infrastructure.
 S. 5180--A  7
 
  (vii) Affected entities are encouraged to maximize employee access  to
 and  promote  the  use of ZEV charging infrastructure employee workplace
 charging at state owned and maintained parking facilities.
  (viii)  Affected  entities shall evaluate the inclusion of distributed
 energy resources and energy storage to the maximum  extent  practicable.
 The  New  York  power  authority  and New York state energy research and
 development authority shall collaborate  to  provide  affected  entities
 with needed technical assistance regarding new energy storage systems.
  (ix)  Affected  entities shall seek to utilize the department of envi-
 ronmental conservation value of carbon guidance, where  appropriate,  to
 aid in their decision-making on greenhouse gas emission reductions under
 this act.
  8. Reducing waste. (a) The council shall create a waste diversion plan
 template  that  affected entities shall use to complete their plans. All
 affected entities shall create a waste diversion plan and file such plan
 with the council that outlines how they will meet the following goals:
  (i) a decrease in waste disposal of 10 percent every five years from a
 baseline of fiscal year 2018-19, until reaching a goal of 75 percent.
  (ii) waste data reported for these goals should be broken out into the
 following categories:  recycled  materials;  compostable  materials  and
 other  organics;  material sent to landfills (including construction and
 demolition waste); and special waste (including hazardous waste).
  (iii) The waste diversion plan shall incorporate at least the  follow-
 ing elements:
  (A)  a  schedule for conducting routine waste audits of facilities and
 how the findings from the waste audit  will  be  utilized  in  advancing
 waste reduction;
  (B)  a  plan  for  diverting  organic waste from landfills to meet the
 diversion goals;
  (C) identifying all instances where single-use plastics are  used  and
 creating  a plan to eliminate their use in all circumstances where doing
 so will not endanger employee or public health and safety; and
  (D) consideration of whether the  affected  entity  should,  by  2025,
 transition  to  dual-stream  recycling  that source separates recyclable
 items into subcategories of mixed paper and commingled containers (plas-
 tic, glass, and metal), at all facilities where it  is  practicable  and
 where  dual-stream  material recovery facilities are available, cost-ef-
 fective and efficient.
  (iv) in addition, technical assistance in compiling the plans will  be
 provided by the department of environmental conservation.
  (v)  the  council shall reassess the waste diversion goals of this act
 at least every five years, and if the goals are updated by the  council,
 it  shall  require  updated  waste  diversion  plans  to be submitted by
 affected entities on how each will meet the new goals.
  (vi) affected entities shall file such plans with the  council  within
 one year of the receipt of the waste diversion plan template.
  (b)  90  days  after the effective date of this act, affected entities
 shall not expend state funds for the purchase of bottled  water.  If  an
 affected  entity determines that it has a need to purchase bottled water
 for health or safety reasons, it may request an exemption from the coun-
 cil for its particular circumstances pursuant  to  subdivision  five  of
 this  act.  The  council  shall  issue  guidance  on  exceptions to this
 requirement to  address  public  health  issues  and  other  appropriate
 circumstances.  This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to an affected entity
 purchasing bottled water for emergency purposes.
 S. 5180--A  8
 
  9. Reducing use of toxic substances. Affected entities shall  evaluate
 and incorporate toxic use reduction strategies into their operations, to
 the  extent  practicable,  to  achieve pollution prevention. The council
 shall, at a minimum, provide agencies with information on healthy build-
 ings,  green  cleaning  and disinfection, integrated pest management and
 green procurement.
  10. Low impact development. (a) Affected entities shall evaluate,  and
 to  the  maximum  extent  practicable,  incorporate green infrastructure
 concepts to reduce all stormwater runoff and improve  water  quality  in
 new  construction  or redevelopment projects submitted for permitting by
 affected entities regardless of  disturbance  threshold.  These  include
 activities  such  as the reconstruction of parking lots and the addition
 of new landscaping.
  (b) The council, in collaboration with  the  environmental  facilities
 corporation,  shall  provide guidance on incorporating green infrastruc-
 ture concepts to affected entities.
  (c) (i) New infrastructure and building projects shall be designed and
 built to account for the climate  changes  that  may  occur  over  their
 lifespans.  This  includes incorporating climate projections and adapta-
 tion strategies in upfront design and expected  operations  and  manage-
 ment.  Preservation of open space shall be considered as a strategy for
 climate risk mitigation in new and existing construction.
  (ii) The council  shall  provide  guidance  on  incorporating  climate
 projections and climate risk concepts to affected entities.
  (iii)  All  affected  entities  shall evaluate opportunities to harden
 their infrastructure and mitigate the impacts  of  climate  change  with
 resilience  practices such as nature-based solutions and modular infras-
 tructure.
  11. Promoting biodiversity and habitat protection. (a) Affected  enti-
 ties that have jurisdiction over real property shall, where practicable,
 seek  opportunities  to  enhance  the ecological integrity of their real
 property to support native biodiversity and the New York state  pollina-
 tor  protection  plan,  protect  threatened  and endangered species, and
 increase climate resilience and natural carbon  storage.  This  includes
 prioritizing  the use of native plants and minimizing the use of non-na-
 tive plants in landscaping and other planting efforts and  other  activ-
 ities  that  may  be identified in the New York natural heritage program
 conservation guide and its management recommendations  regarding  listed
 plants.
  (b)  The council shall provide a template for all affected entities to
 implement an early detection rapid response protocol in place for  inva-
 sive  species on real property over which the affected entity has juris-
 diction. The council may issue additional operational directives to stop
 the spread of invasive species on state-owned real property.
  (c) Affected entities shall give priority to  the  use  of  integrated
 pest management techniques to control invasive species before turning to
 other means of eradication.
  (d)  All  affected  entities shall follow available best practices for
 identifying and properly managing endangered species  on  real  property
 and  ensure  that  their  projects and operations do not have an adverse
 impact upon any endangered  species.  The  department  of  environmental
 conservation shall provide guidance and technical assistance to affected
 entities  regarding  properly managing endangered species and data tools
 to identify locations where endangered species issues may be present.
  (e) Affected entities shall  evaluate  opportunities,  to  the  extent
 practicable,  to  co-locate  new projects with landscaping or habitat to
 S. 5180--A  9
 
 support native pollinator species and the goals of the  New  York  state
 pollinator  protection  plan  and enhance climate resilience and natural
 carbon storage.
  12.  Disadvantaged communities. (a) Each affected entity shall, to the
 maximum extent practicable, lower the impact of its operations on disad-
 vantaged communities, and shall incorporate lowered environmental impact
 in these communities into  the  plans  developed  by  affected  entities
 pursuant to this act.
  (b)  The  council shall conduct an inventory of state-owned facilities
 located in disadvantaged communities.
  (c) Affected entities  shall  prioritize  facilities  over  which  the
 affected  entity  has jurisdiction that are located within disadvantaged
 communities for efficiency and other  environmental  upgrades,  such  as
 electrifying  heating and cooling systems, which will lower the affected
 entity's environmental impacts on these communities.
  13. Innovative solutions. The council shall continuously evaluate  the
 potential  of  new  technologies in order to assist affected entities in
 continuing to reduce their environmental footprint and increase  climate
 resilience  (mitigation  and adaptation) of its operations, and wherever
 feasible, test new technologies and equipment to determine if such tech-
 nologies or equipment are practicable for adoption  in  affected  entity
 operations.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
