 FOR  THE  ULTIMATE USER AND SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED AN OFFICIAL NEW YORK
 STATE PRESCRIPTION OR ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION FOR SCHEDULED SUBSTANCES.
  3. THE INCLUSION OF A QUICK RESPONSE CODE SHALL NOT OBVIATE ANY  OTHER
 REQUIREMENT  OF  THIS ARTICLE. ADDITIONALLY, A QUICK RESPONSE CODE SHALL
 INCORPORATE STANDARDIZED PATIENT-CENTERED DATA ELEMENTS, WHEN  FEASIBLE,
 PURSUANT TO SECTION SIXTY-EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EDUCATION LAW.
  § 3. Subdivision 1 of section 6810 of the education law, as amended by
 section  2  of  part  V of chapter 57 of the laws of 2012, is amended to
 read as follows:
  1. No drug for which a prescription is required by the  provisions  of
 the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or by the commissioner of health
 shall  be  distributed  or  dispensed  to  any  person  except  upon  a
 prescription written by  a  person  legally  authorized  to  issue  such
 prescription.  Such  drug shall be compounded or dispensed by a licensed
 pharmacist, and no such drug shall be dispensed without affixing to  the
 immediate container in which the drug is sold or dispensed a label bear-
 ing  the  name and address of the owner of the establishment in which it
 was dispensed, the date compounded, the number of the prescription under
 which it is recorded in the pharmacist's prescription files, the name of
 the prescriber, the name and address of the patient, and the  directions
 for  the  use of the drug by the patient as given upon the prescription.
 All labels shall conform to such rules and regulations as promulgated by
 the commissioner pursuant to section sixty-eight hundred twenty-nine  of
 this  article. ALL LABELS SHALL CONFORM TO SUCH RULES AND REGULATIONS AS
 PROMULGATED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, IN  CONJUNCTION  WITH  THE
 COMMISSIONER  OF  THE  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, PURSUANT TO SECTION THIRTY-
 THREE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH  LAW;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
 THAT  CONFORMITY  WITH  SUCH  RULES  AND REGULATIONS SHALL NOT FULFILL A
 REQUIREMENT UNDER SECTION SIXTY-EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE OF THIS  ARTI-
 CLE.  The  prescribing  and  dispensing  of a drug which is a controlled
 substance shall be subject to additional requirements provided in  arti-
 cle  thirty-three  of  the  public  health  law.  The  words  "drug" and
 "prescription required drug" within the meaning of  this  article  shall
 not  be construed to include soft or hard contact lenses, eyeglasses, or
 any other device for the aid or correction of vision.  Nothing  in  this
 subdivision  shall  prevent a pharmacy from furnishing a drug to another
 pharmacy which does not have such drug in stock for the purpose of fill-
 ing a prescription.
  § 4. Subdivision 2 of section 6829 of the education law is amended  by
 adding a new paragraph (d) to read as follows:
  (D)  THE  SERVICES  REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE PROVIDED FOR
 THE REQUIREMENTS OF  SECTION  THIRTY-THREE  HUNDRED  THIRTY-SIX  OF  THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH LAW.
  §  5. This act shall take effect one year after it shall have become a
 law.
