 AN ACT to amend the tax law, in relation to increasing the amount of the
  taxpayer empire state film production credit

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  5  of subdivision (a) of section 24 of the tax
 law, as amended by section 2 of part M of chapter  59  of  the  laws  of
 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  (5)  For  the period two thousand fifteen through two thousand twenty-
 nine, in addition to the amount of credit established in  paragraph  two
 of  this  subdivision, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit equal to the
 product (or pro rata share of the product, in the case of a member of  a
 partnership)  of ten percent and the amount of wages or salaries paid to
 individuals directly employed  (excluding  those  employed  as  writers,
 directors,  music  directors,  producers and performers, including back-
 ground actors with no scripted lines) by  a  qualified  film  production
 company  or a qualified independent film production company for services
 performed by those individuals in one of the counties specified in  this
 paragraph  in  connection with a qualified film with a minimum budget of
 five hundred thousand dollars. For purposes of this  additional  credit,
 the services must be performed in one or more of the following counties:
 Albany,  Allegany,  Broome,  Cattaraugus,  Cayuga,  Chautauqua, Chemung,
 Chenango, Clinton, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Dutchess, Erie,  Essex,
 Franklin, Fulton, Genesee, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis,
 Livingston,  Madison,  Monroe,  Montgomery,  Niagara,  Oneida, Onondaga,
 Ontario, Orange, Orleans, Oswego, Otsego, Putnam, Rensselaer,  Saratoga,
 Schenectady,  Schoharie, Schuyler, Seneca, St. Lawrence, Steuben, Sulli-
 van, Tioga, Tompkins, Ulster, Warren,  Washington,  Wayne,  Wyoming,  or

 authority of this paragraph shall be [five] FIFTEEN million dollars each
 year during the period two thousand fifteen through two  thousand  twen-
 ty-nine  of the annual allocation made available to the program pursuant
 to  paragraph  four  of  subdivision (e) of this section. Such aggregate
 amount of credits shall be allocated by the governor's office for motion
 picture and television development among taxpayers in order of  priority
 based  upon  the  date  of  filing an application for allocation of film
 production credit with such office.  If the total  amount  of  allocated
 credits  applied for under this paragraph in any year exceeds the aggre-
 gate amount of tax credits allowed for such year under  this  paragraph,
 such excess shall be treated as having been applied for on the first day
 of  the  next year. If the total amount of allocated tax credits applied
 for under this paragraph at the conclusion of  any  year  is  less  than
 [five]  FIFTEEN  million dollars, the remainder shall be treated as part
 of the annual allocation made available to the program pursuant to para-
 graph four of subdivision (e) of this section. However, in no event  may
 the  total of the credits allocated under this paragraph and the credits
 allocated under paragraph five of subdivision (a) of section  thirty-one
 of  this article, AS ADDED BY SECTION TWELVE OF PART Q OF CHAPTER FIFTY-
 SEVEN OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND TEN,  exceed  [five]  FIFTEEN  million
 dollars  in  any year during the period two thousand fifteen through two
 thousand twenty-nine.
  § 2. This act shall take effect April 1, 2024.
