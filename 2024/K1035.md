  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2024, as Vaping Awareness Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in participating in
months designated to raise awareness of important issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  March  2024  will be observed as Vaping Awareness Month to
create awareness around the dangers of vaping and  electronic  cigarette
products, especially due to the fact that youth and young adults are the
primary  users  of  e-cigarettes, a majority of which contain the highly
addictive chemical nicotine; and
 
  WHEREAS, Almost all adults addicted to nicotine started  smoking  or
using  other  tobacco  products  in  their teens, and nearly 9 out of 10
adult smokers started smoking by age 18; and
 
  WHEREAS, E-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product  by
high  school  students in New York State, and more than one in five high
school students reported vaping nicotine in 2020; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nicotine can harm the developing brain of  adolescents  and
young  adults,  which  can  lead  to  lower  impulse  control  and  mood
disorders, disrupt attention and learning among youth and young  adults,
and increase the risk for future addiction to other drugs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  cigarette smoking rate among high school students has
declined 91% since 2000, but the high  rate  of  e-cigarette  use  among
youth makes the rate of any tobacco product use similar to that in 2002;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nicotine  use can lead to addiction which, when use is not
maintained, can result in temporary symptoms of  withdrawal,  including,
but  not  limited to, irritability, restlessness, anxiety or depression,
and trouble sleeping; and
 
  WHEREAS, People may keep using  tobacco  products  to  help  relieve
these  symptoms,  specifically  youth  trying  to  deal  with  stress or
anxiety, creating a cycle of nicotine dependence; and
 
  WHEREAS, About two-thirds of youth  in  the  U.S.  who  use  tobacco
products,  including  e-cigarettes, report wanting to quit and trying to
quit; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 2024, as Vaping
Awareness Month in the State of New York, and to urge  its  citizens  to
educate themselves about the dangers of vaping and e-cigarette products,
and  the  need  for more conversations with youth surrounding vaping and
nicotine addiction, early detection methods, effective  treatments,  and
prevention programs; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
