BY: M. of A. Rozic
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 27, 2024, as Holocaust  Remembrance  Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  From  1933  to 1945, 5.8 million Jews were murdered in the
Nazi Holocaust as a part  of  a  systematic  program  of  genocide,  and
millions of other people also perished as victims of Nazism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jews  who fell under German control in Eastern and Central
Europe were quickly stripped of their rights and property; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Jews who perished at Nazi hands comprised two-thirds of
all European Jewry, and in countries such as Poland,  which  before  the
second  World  War included parts of the Ukraine and Belarus, the Jewish
death toll surpassed 90 percent; and
 
  WHEREAS, The year 2024 marks the 91st Anniversary of  the  beginning
of the genocide of European Jews, the bleakest, most murderous moment in
history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Holocaust  represents  the  darkest  period  in  the
civilization of mankind and  must  always  be  remembered  in  order  to
prevent its reoccurrence anywhere else in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is observed
on January 27th each year, is  a  day  set  aside  for  remembering  the
millions  of  victims  of the Holocaust; this date was designated by the
United Nations General Assembly on November 1, 2005,  as  it  marks  the
date when Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi death camp, was liberated
by Soviet Troops in 1945; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remembrance  ceremonies  are  held  throughout  the United
States and around the world to remember the tragedy of the Holocaust  on
January  27th, including at Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and in
the halls of the United Nations in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is critically important to remember the  events  of  the
Holocaust  to  ensure that the events shall "never again" happen, as has
been the rallying cry among the Jewish people; and
 
  WHEREAS, In times of war and chaos, with the threat of genocide  and
ethnic  cleansing  present  in  many  war-torn regions of the world, the
events of the  Holocaust  continue  to  be  relevant  and  important  to
remember  so that suffering on this scale truly never does happen again;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Knowing that the events and root causes  of  the  Holocaust
must  not  be  forgotten and that, particularly as survivors diminish in
number, links  must  be  forged  to  educate  future  generations;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  27,  2024,  as
Holocaust Remembrance Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
