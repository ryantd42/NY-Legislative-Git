 such  employee  was  acting within the scope of his public employment or
 duties upon his acquittal or upon the dismissal of the criminal  charges

  (C)  Upon  the application for reimbursement for reasonable attorneys'
 fees or litigation expenses or both made by or on behalf of an  employee
 as  provided  in subdivision three of this section, the attorney general
 shall determine, based upon his investigation  and  his  review  of  the
 facts  and  circumstances, whether such reimbursement shall be paid. The
 attorney general shall notify the employee in writing of  such  determi-
 nation. Upon determining that such reimbursement should be provided, the
 attorney  general shall so certify to the comptroller. Upon such certif-
 ication, reimbursement shall be made for such fees or expenses  or  both

 and  other  agencies as may be appropriate, shall submit to the governor

 fees,  and  litigation expenses paid pursuant to this section during the

 not be limited to the number, type and amount of claims so paid, as well
 as  an estimate of claims to be paid during the remainder of the current
 fiscal year and during the  following  fiscal  year.  Any  dispute  with
 regard  to  entitlement  to  reimbursement  or  the amount of litigation
 expenses or the reasonableness of attorneys' fees shall be resolved by a
 court of competent jurisdiction upon appropriate motion or by way  of  a
 special proceeding.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
