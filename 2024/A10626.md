 AN ACT to authorize the county of Monroe to  offer  an  optional  twenty
  year retirement plan to Carl J. Zimmerman, a sergeant employed by such
  county
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the county of Monroe, a participating employer in  the  New  York  state
 employees'  retirement  system,  which has elected to offer the optional
 twenty year retirement plan, established pursuant to article 14-B of the
 retirement and social security law, to sergeants employed by such  coun-
 ty, is hereby authorized to make participation in such plan available to
 Carl  J.  Zimmerman,  a sergeant employed by the county of Monroe with a
 start date of October 29, 1990, who, for reasons not ascribable  to  his
 own  negligence,  failed  to make a timely application to participate in
 such optional twenty year plan contained in article 14-B of the  retire-
 ment  and  social  security  law.  The  county of Monroe may so elect by
 filing with the state comptroller, on or before 180 days after this  act
 shall  have  become  a  law, a resolution of its governing body together
 with certification that such sergeant did not bar themself from  partic-
 ipation  in  the  retirement  plan  as a result of their own negligence.
 Thereafter, such sergeant may individually elect to be  covered  by  the
 provisions of sections 552 and 553 of the retirement and social security
 law,  and  the  retirement  system shall credit service from October 29,
 1990 to present under sections 552 and 553 of the retirement and  social
 security  law. Such member may effectuate by filing an election with the
 retirement system within one year of the effective date of this act.
  § 2. All employer past service costs associated with implementing  the
 provisions of this act shall be borne by the county of Monroe and may be
 amortized over a five-year period.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.

  This  bill  would allow Carl J. Zimmerman, a current member of the New
 York State and Local Employees' Retirement System employed as a sergeant
 by the County of Monroe and covered under the 25-year retirement plan of
 Section 89-p of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL), to  elect
 to  be  covered  under  the  20-year plan of Sections 552 and 553 of the
 RSSL. All past service costs will be borne by the County of  Monroe  and
 may be amortized over a period of five years.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $11,000 in the
 annual contributions of the County of Monroe for the fiscal year  ending
 March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the billing rates
 and salary of Carl J. Zimmerman change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past service cost of approximately $141,000 which will be
 borne by the County of Monroe  as  a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes  that payment will be made on February 1, 2025. If the County of
 Monroe elects to amortize this cost over a five-year  period,  the  cost
 for each year including interest would be $31,500.
