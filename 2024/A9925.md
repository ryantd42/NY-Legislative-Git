  Section 1. Subdivision l of section 601 of the retirement  and  social

  l. (a) "Wages" shall mean regular compensation earned by and paid to a

 New  York  state  and local employees' retirement system or the New York
 state teachers' retirement system on or after January first,  two  thou-

 at a rate greater than their standard rate for additional  hours  worked
 beyond  those  required,  including  compensation paid under section one
 hundred thirty-four of the civil service law and section ninety  of  the

 ty-first preceding the overtime  ceiling  adjustment  effective  on  the
 ensuing April first.
  (ii)  Commencing  January  first, two thousand eighteen, and each year

 sation paid in anticipation of retirement, and 5. in the case of employ-
 ees  who  receive  wages  from three or more employers in a twelve month
 period, the wages paid by the third and each additional employer.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation would remove the  Overtime  Ceiling
 for  Tier  6  New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) members subject to
 the 25-Year and Age 55 Retirement Program (the  55/25  NYCTA  Plan)  for
 wages used to calculate member contributions and pension benefits.

  INITIAL INCREASE (DECREASE) IN ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES

  Present Value (PV)  NYCERS

  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data  collected  as  of  June  30, 2023. The census data for the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  19,953
  - Average Age:  42.9
  - Average Service:  5.0
  - Average Salary:  82,600

  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: Under the proposed legis-
 lation, the Overtime Ceiling would become inapplicable  to  participants
 in the Tier 6 55/25 NYCTA Plan. As a result, overtime earnings exceeding
 the  Overtime  Ceiling  would be included in determining member contrib-
 ution rates and annual contributions to be paid by the  member.  Partic-
 ipants  may be entitled to a higher annual pension benefit if such earn-
 ings increase their Final Average Salary.
 
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
 
 * Future overtime earnings exceeding the Overtime Ceiling  were  assumed
 to  remain  level  based  on reported overtime for the last three fiscal
 years.

 * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting  members  so  that  total
 payroll  increases  by 3% each year for NYC Transit members. New entrant

 demographics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actu-
 arial judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
