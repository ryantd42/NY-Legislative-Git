 FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OR FOR A PERIOD OF TEN BUSINESS DAYS FROM  THE
 FIRST DATE OF AVAILABILITY OF THE ARTICLE, WHICHEVER SHALL BE LATER.
  THE  ISSUANCE  OF  SUCH RAINCHECK SHALL CONSTITUTE AN AGREEMENT ON THE
 PART OF THE SELLER TO SUPPLY  SUCH  ARTICLE  AT  SUCH  PRICE.  NOTHING
 CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL PROHIBIT A SELLER FROM OFFERING A SIMILAR ARTICLE
 OF  EQUAL  OR  GREATER  VALUE  EITHER  DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY SUCH
 ADVERTISEMENT OF THE ARTICLE OR WITHIN SIXTY DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSU-
 ANCE OF THE RAINCHECK, OR THE SELLER  AND  PURCHASER  FROM  AGREEING  TO

 LATER.
  YOU WILL PAY ONLY THE ADVERTISED PRICE FOR THE ITEM.
  YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO BUY THE ITEM.
  5. IT SHALL BE AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO AN ALLEGED VIOLATION OF  THIS
 SECTION  THAT  THE  SELLER  WAS  UNABLE  TO HONOR A RAINCHECK WITHIN THE
 REDEMPTION PERIOD BECAUSE SUCH SELLER DID NOT RECEIVE A REORDER  OF  THE
 ADVERTISED  ARTICLE  FROM  A  SUPPLIER  THROUGH  NO  FAULT OF THE SELLER
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SELLER MUST MAINTAIN RECORDS  SUFFICIENT  TO
 SHOW  THAT THE ADVERTISED SALE ITEMS WERE REORDERED IN ADEQUATE TIME FOR
 DELIVERY AND IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO FULFILL RAINCHECK OBLIGATIONS.
  6. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO A PURCHASE FOR RESALE.
  7. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO  RELIEVE  THE  SELLER
 FROM  ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW PROHIBITING THE ADVERTISING OF GOODS OR
 SERVICES WITH THE INTENT NOT TO MEET REASONABLY EXPECTED DEMAND.
  8. NO PURCHASER SHALL BE REQUIRED TO PREPAY THE PURCHASE PRICE OR  ANY
 PART THEREOF IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A RAINCHECK.
  9. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO RESTRICT THE POWER OF
 ANY  COUNTY, CITY, TOWN OR VILLAGE TO ADOPT AND ENFORCE ADDITIONAL LOCAL
 LAWS, ORDINANCES, OR REGULATIONS WHICH  EXCEED  THE  MINIMUM  APPLICABLE
 STANDARDS IN THIS SECTION.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
