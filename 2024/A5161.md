 as amended by chapter 376 of the laws of 2019, are amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1.  Recipient  qualifications.  Tuition  assistance program awards are
 available for all students who are enrolled in approved programs and who
 demonstrate the ability to complete such  courses,  in  accordance  with
 standards  established  by  the  commissioner provided, however, that no
 award shall be made unless tuition (exclusive of educational fees)  and,
 if  applicable,  the  college  fee levied by the state university of New
 York pursuant to the April first, nineteen hundred sixty-four  financing
 agreements  with  the New York state dormitory authority charged for the
 program in which the student is enrolled  total  at  least  two  hundred
 dollars  a  year,  and  provided  further  that, no award can exceed one
 hundred percent of the amount of  tuition  charged.  NOTHING  IN  THIS

 FROM  CLASSIFICATION  BY THE COMMISSIONER AS AN APPROVED PROGRAM FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.
  2. Duration. No undergraduate shall be eligible  for  more  than  four
 academic  years of study, or five academic years if the program of study
 normally requires five years. Students enrolled in a program of remedial
 study, approved by the commissioner in an institution of  higher  educa-
 tion and intended to culminate in a degree in undergraduate study shall,
 for  purposes of this section, be considered as enrolled in a program of
 study normally requiring five years. An undergraduate  student  enrolled
 in  an  eligible  two year program of study approved by the commissioner
 shall be eligible for no more than three academic  years  of  study.  An
 undergraduate  student  enrolled in an approved two or four-year program
 of study approved by the  commissioner  who  must  transfer  to  another
 institution  as  a result of permanent college closure shall be eligible
 for up to two additional semesters, or their equivalent, to  the  extent
 credits  necessary  to  complete his or her program of study were deemed
 non-transferable from the closed institution or were deemed not applica-
 ble to such student's program of study by the new institution.  NO GRAD-
 UATE STUDENT SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR MORE  THAN  FOUR  ACADEMIC  YEARS  OF
 STUDY  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO GRADUATE STUDENT SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR
 MORE THAN ONE DEGREE PROGRAM AT  THE  MASTER'S,  FIRST  PROFESSIONAL  OR
 DOCTORATE  LEVEL.  NO STUDENT SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A TOTAL OF MORE THAN
 THE EQUIVALENT OF EIGHT YEARS OF  COMBINED  UNDERGRADUATE  AND  GRADUATE
 STUDY.  Any  semester,  quarter,  or  term  of attendance during which a
 student receives any award under this article, after the effective  date
 of the former scholar incentive program and prior to academic year nine-
 teen  hundred  eighty-nine--nineteen  hundred  ninety,  shall be counted
 toward the maximum term of eligibility for tuition assistance under this
 section, except that any semester, quarter or term of attendance  during
 which  a  student  received  an  award  pursuant  to section six hundred
 sixty-six of this subpart shall be counted as one-half  of  a  semester,
 quarter  or  term, as the case may be, toward the maximum term of eligi-
 bility under this section. Any semester, quarter or term  of  attendance
 during which a student received an award pursuant to section six hundred
