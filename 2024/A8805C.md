  § 6. Section 204 of the  workers'  compensation  law,  as  amended  by
 section  5  of  part SS of chapter 54 of the laws of 2016, is amended to
 read as follows:
  § 204. Disability and family leave during  employment.  1.  Disability
 benefits  shall  be  payable  to  an eligible employee for disabilities,
 beginning with the eighth day of disability and  thereafter  during  the
 continuance  of disability, subject to the limitations as to maximum and
 minimum amounts and duration and other  conditions  and  limitations  in
 this  section  and  in  sections two hundred five and two hundred six of
 this article. Family leave benefits shall  be  payable  to  an  eligible
 employee for the first full day when family leave is required and there-
 after  during  the  continuance of the need for family leave, subject to
 the limitations as to maximum and minimum amounts and duration and other
 conditions and limitations in this section and in sections  two  hundred
 five and two hundred six of this article. Successive periods of disabil-
 ity  or family leave caused by the same or related injury or sickness OR
 QUALIFYING EVENT shall shall be deemed a single period of disability  or
 family leave only if separated by less than three months.
  2. (a) The weekly benefit for family leave that occurs (i) on or after
 January first, two thousand eighteen shall not exceed eight weeks during
 any  fifty-two  week  calendar  period and shall be fifty percent of the
 employee's average weekly wage but shall not exceed fifty percent of the
 state average weekly wage, (ii) on or after January first, two  thousand
 nineteen  shall  not exceed ten weeks during any fifty-two week calendar
 period and shall be fifty-five percent of the employee's average  weekly
 wage but shall not exceed fifty-five percent of the state average weekly
 wage,  (iii)  on  or  after January first, two thousand twenty shall not

 The  superintendent of financial services shall have discretion to delay
 the increases in the family leave benefit  level  provided  in  subpara-
 graphs  (ii),  (iii), and (iv) of this paragraph by one or more calendar
 years. In determining whether to delay the increase in the family  leave
 benefit  for  any  year,  the superintendent of financial services shall
 consider: (1) the current cost to employees of the family leave  benefit
 and  any expected change in the cost after the benefit increase; (2) the
 current number of insurers issuing  insurance  policies  with  a  family
 A. 8805--B  10

 increase on employers' business and the overall stability of the program

 the benefit increase on the financial stability of  the  disability  and
 family  leave  insurance  market  and  carriers;  and (5) any additional
 factors that the superintendent of financial services deems relevant. If
 the superintendent of financial services  delays  the  increase  in  the
 family  leave  benefit  level for one or more calendar years, the family
 leave benefit level that shall take  effect  immediately  following  the
 delay  shall  be the same benefit level that would have taken effect but
 for the delay. The weekly benefits for family leave that  occurs  on  or
 after  January  first,  two thousand eighteen shall not be less than one
 hundred dollars per week except that if the employee's wages at the time

 shall receive [his or her] SUCH EMPLOYEE'S full wages. Benefits  may  be
 payable  to  employees for paid family leave taken intermittently or for
 less than a full work week in increments of one full day or one fifth of

 EXCEPT THAT IF THE EMPLOYEE'S WAGES AT THE TIME OF FAMILY LEAVE ARE LESS
 THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK, THE EMPLOYEE SHALL RECEIVE THEIR FULL
 WAGES.
  (III) NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE DEEMED TO DIMINISH THE  RIGHTS,
 PRIVILEGES,  OR REMEDIES OF ANY EMPLOYEE UNDER ANY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
 AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW, RULE,  OR  REGULATION  TO  THE
 CONTRARY, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE WAIVED FOR A DISABILI-
 TY  COMMENCING  BETWEEN  JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE AND THE
 EXPIRATION OR MODIFICATION DATE OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT  BY
 A  COVERED  EMPLOYER  WHO  HAS  ENTERED  INTO SUCH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

 receive  for  disability  commencing  on  or  after  May first, nineteen
 hundred eighty-nine AND PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FIVE

 employee's average weekly wage is less than twenty dollars, the  benefit
 shall be such average weekly wage. The weekly benefit which the disabled

 wage is less than twenty dollars the benefit shall be such average week-
 ly wage. The weekly benefit which the disabled employee is  entitled  to
 receive  for  disability  commencing  on  or  after July first, nineteen

 no case shall such benefit exceed ninety-five dollars nor be  less  than
 twenty  dollars;  except  that  if the employee's average weekly wage is

 employee's normal work days per week and multiplying the quotient by the
 number  of  normal work days in such period of disability.] BENEFITS MAY
 BE PAYABLE TO EMPLOYEES FOR DISABILITY LEAVE TAKEN INTERMITTENTLY OR FOR
 LESS THAN A FULL WORK WEEK IN INCREMENTS OF ONE FULL DAY OR ONE-FIFTH OF
 THE WEEKLY BENEFIT. The weekly benefit for a disabled  employee  who  is
 concurrently  eligible  for  benefits in the employment of more than one
 covered employer shall, within the maximum and minimum herein  provided,

 from  all  such covered employers, and shall be allocated in the propor-
 tion of their respective average weekly wage payments.

 bled  and has claimed or subsequently claims workers' compensation bene-
 fits under this chapter or benefits under  the  volunteer  firefighters'
 benefit  law  or  the volunteer ambulance workers' benefit law, and such

 ry in line of duty as a volunteer  firefighter  or  volunteer  ambulance
 worker,  the employee shall be entitled in the first instance to receive

 compensation  benefits, or volunteer firefighters' benefits or volunteer
 ambulance workers' benefits, is made, file with the board  a  claim  for
 reimbursement  out of the proceeds of such award to the employee for the
 period for which disability benefits were paid  to  the  employee  under

 amended  by chapter 294 of the laws of 2021, and subdivision 12 as added
 by chapter 773 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  §  239-bb.  County-wide  shared  services  panels. 1. Definitions. The
 following terms shall have the following meanings for  the  purposes  of
 this article:
  a. "County" shall mean any county not wholly contained within a city.
  b.  "County  CEO"  shall  mean the county executive, county manager or
 other chief executive of the county, or, where none, the  chair  of  the
 county legislative body.
  c.  "Panel" shall mean a county-wide shared services panel established
 pursuant to subdivision two of this section.
  d. "Plan" shall  mean  a  county-wide  shared  services  property  tax
 savings plan.
  2. County-wide shared services panels. a. There [shall] MAY be a coun-
 ty-wide  shared  services  panel in each county consisting of the county
 CEO, and one representative from each city,  town  and  village  in  the
 county. The chief executive officer of each town, city and village shall
 be  the representative to a panel and shall be the mayor, if a city or a
 village, or shall be the supervisor, if a town.  The  county  CEO  shall
 serve  as chair. [All panels established in each county pursuant to part
 BBB of chapter fifty-nine of the laws of  two  thousand  seventeen,  and
 prior  to  the enactment of this article, shall continue in satisfaction
 of this section in such form as they were established, provided that the
 county CEO may alter the membership of the panel consistent  with  para-
 graph b of this subdivision.]
  b. The county CEO may invite any school district, board of cooperative
 educational  services,  fire  district,  fire  protection  district,  or
 special improvement district in the county to join a  panel.  Upon  such
 invitation, the governing body of such school district, board of cooper-
 ative  educational services, fire district, fire protection district, or
 other special district may accept such invitation by selecting a  repre-
 sentative of such governing body, by majority vote, to serve as a member
 of  the  panel.  [Such school district, board of cooperative educational
 services, fire district,  fire  protection  district  or  other  special
 district  shall  maintain  such  representation  until  the panel either
 approves a plan or transmits a statement to the secretary  of  state  on
 the  reason the panel did not approve a plan, pursuant to paragraph d of
 subdivision seven of this section. Upon approval of a plan or  a  trans-
 mission  of  a  statement to the secretary of state that a panel did not
 approve a plan in any calendar year, the county CEO may, but  need  not,
 invite  any  school district, board of cooperative educational services,
 fire district, fire protection district or special improvement  district
 in the county to join a panel thereafter convened.]
  3.  [a.]  Each county CEO [shall, after satisfying the requirements of
 part BBB of chapter fifty-nine of the laws of  two  thousand  seventeen,
 annually]  MAY  convene  the  panel  and  [shall undertake to revise and
 update a previously approved plan or alternatively] develop a [new] plan
 [through December thirty-first, two  thousand  twenty-one].  Such  plans
 shall contain new, recurring property tax savings resulting from actions
 such  as,  but  not limited to, the elimination of duplicative services;
 shared services arrangements including, joint purchasing, shared highway
 equipment, shared storage facilities, shared plowing services and energy
 and insurance purchasing cooperatives; reducing back office and adminis-
 trative overhead; and better coordinating  services.  The  secretary  of
 state  may  provide advice and/or recommendations on the form and struc-
 ture of such plans.
 A. 8805--B  19
 
  [b. After having convened at least two meetings in a calendar year,  a
 panel may, by majority vote, determine that it is not in the best inter-
 est  of the taxpayers to revise and update a previously approved plan or
 to develop a new plan in such year. The county CEO of such  panel  shall
 then comply with the provisions of paragraph (d) of subdivision seven of
 this section.]
  4.  While  [revising or updating a previously approved plan, or while]
 developing a [new] plan, the county CEO shall  regularly  consult  with,
 and  take  recommendations  from,  the representatives: on the panel; of
 each collective bargaining unit of the county and the cities, towns, and
 villages; and of each collective bargaining unit  of  any  participating
 school  district,  board  of  cooperative  educational  services,  fire
 district, fire protection district, or special improvement district.
  5. The county CEO, the county  legislative  body  and  a  panel  shall
 accept input from the public, civic, business, labor and community lead-
 ers  on  any  proposed  plan.  The  county  CEO  [shall] MAY cause to be
 conducted [a minimum of three] public hearings prior to submission of  a
 plan  to  a vote of a panel. All such public hearings shall be conducted
 within the county, and public notice  of  all  such  hearings  shall  be
 provided at least one week prior in the manner prescribed in subdivision
 one of section one hundred four of the public officers law. Civic, busi-
 ness,  labor,  and  community leaders, as well as members of the public,
 shall be permitted to provide public testimony at any such hearings.
  6. a. The county CEO shall submit each plan, accompanied by a  certif-
 ication  as  to  the  accuracy  of the savings contained therein, to the
 county legislative body at least forty-five days prior to a vote by  the
 panel.
  b.  The  county  legislative  body shall review and consider each plan
 submitted in accordance with paragraph a of this subdivision. A majority
 of the members of such body may issue an advisory report on  each  plan,
 making  recommendations as deemed necessary. The county CEO may modify a
 plan based on such  recommendations,  which  shall  include  an  updated
 certification as to the accuracy of the savings contained therein.
  7.  a.  A panel shall duly consider any plan properly submitted to the
 panel by the county CEO and may approve such plan by a majority vote  of
 the  panel.  Each  member  of a panel may, prior to the panel-wide vote,
 cause to be removed from a plan any proposed action affecting  the  unit
 of  government  represented  by the respective member. Written notice of
 such removal shall be provided to the county CEO prior to  a  panel-wide
 vote on a plan.
  b. Plans approved by a panel shall be [transmitted to the secretary of
 state  no  later  than  thirty days from the date of approval by a panel
 accompanied by a certification as to the accuracy of the savings  accom-
 panied  therein, and shall be] publicly disseminated to residents of the
 county in a concise, clear, and coherent manner using words with  common
 and everyday meaning.
  c.  The county CEO shall conduct a public presentation of any approved
 plan no later than thirty days from the date of  approval  by  a  panel.
 Public  notice  of such presentation shall be provided at least one week
 prior in the manner prescribed in subdivision one of section one hundred
 four of the public officers law.
  [d. Beginning in two thousand twenty, by January  fifteenth  following
 any calendar year during which a panel did not approve a plan and trans-
 mit  such plan to the secretary of state pursuant to paragraph b of this
 subdivision, the county CEO of such panel shall release  to  the  public
 and  transmit  to  the secretary of state a statement explaining why the
 A. 8805--B  20

 panel did not approve a plan that year, including, for each  vote  on  a
 plan,  the  vote  taken  by each panel member and an explanation by each
 panel member of their vote.
  8.  For  each  county,  new shared services actions in an approved and
 submitted plan pursuant to this section or part BBB  of  chapter  fifty-
 nine  of the laws of two thousand seventeen, may be eligible for funding
 to match savings from such action, subject to  available  appropriation.
 Savings that are actually and demonstrably realized by the participating
 local  governments  are eligible for matching funding.  For actions that
 are part of an approved plan transmitted to the secretary  of  state  in
 accordance  with  paragraph  b  of  subdivision  seven  of this section,
 savings achieved during either: (i) January first through December thir-
 ty-first from new actions implemented on or after January first  through
 December  thirty-first of the year immediately following an approved and
 transmitted plan, or (ii) July first of the year  immediately  following
 an  approved  and  transmitted plan through June thirtieth of the subse-
 quent year from new actions implemented July first  of  the  year  imme-
 diately  following an approved plan through June thirtieth of the subse-
 quent year may be eligible for  matching  funding.  Only  net  savings
 between local governments for each action would be eligible for matching
 funding. Savings from internal efficiencies or any other action taken by
 a local government without the participation of another local government
 are  not eligible for matching funding. Each county and all of the local
 governments within the county that are part of any action to  be  imple-
 mented  as  part  of  an  approved  plan must collectively apply for the
 matching funding and agree on the distribution and use of  any  matching
 funding in order to qualify for matching funding.
  9. The department of state shall prepare a report to the governor, the
 temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assembly on the
 county-wide  shared  services  plans  approved by the county-wide shared
 services panels created pursuant to part BBB of  chapter  fifty-nine  of
 the  laws  of two thousand seventeen and this article and shall post the
 report on the department's website. Such report shall be provided on  or
 before  June  thirtieth, two thousand twenty-five and shall include, but
 not be limited to, the following:

  10.] 8. The secretary of state may solicit, and the panels may provide
 at [her or his] THE request OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE, advice and recom-
 mendations concerning matters related to the operations of local govern-
 ments  and  shared  services initiatives, including, but not limited to,
 making recommendations regarding grant proposals incorporating  elements
 of  shared  services,  government  dissolutions,  government and service
 consolidations, or property taxes and such other grants where the secre-
 tary deems the input of the panels to be in the  best  interest  of  the
 public. The panel shall advance such advice or recommendations by a vote
 of the majority of the members present at such meeting.
  [11.  The authority granted by this article to a county CEO to convene
 a panel for the purpose of revising or updating  a  previously  approved
 plan,  or  developing  a  new plan, or to provide the secretary of state
 information pursuant to subdivision ten of this section, shall cease  on
 December thirty-first, two thousand twenty-four.
  12.]  9.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law to the contrary,
 monies constituting the funds of the  village  incorporation  commission
 established pursuant to section 2-259 of the village law shall be depos-
 ited with the state comptroller and held for the purposes of the village
 incorporation  commission established in article two of the village law;
 provided, however, that such monies shall be derived from the  appropri-
 ation  dedicated  to the matching funds program pursuant to [subdivision
 eight of this section and provided further, that such funding  for  such
 entity  shall not be subject to the requirements of subdivision eight of
 this section related to savings] PART BBB OF CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE  OF  THE
 LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2024; provided,
 however, that this act shall not affect the eligibility for  funding  to
 match  savings  for  any shared services actions that are part of a plan
 approved and submitted to the secretary of  state  pursuant  to  section
 239-bb  of the general municipal law as of January 31, 2024. Each county
 and all of the local governments within the county that are part of  any
 such  actions  to  be  implemented  as  part  of such approved plans may
 collectively apply for the matching funding for  savings  achieved  from
 such  implemented  actions  and  the secretary of state shall distribute
 such matching funding according to the provisions of section  239-bb  of
 the general municipal law in effect as of January 31, 2024.

 the local finance law, as amended from time to time. Notwithstanding the
 foregoing, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the authority may

 preceding  sentence,  provided  that such additional amount at issuance,
 together with the amount of indebtedness contracted by the city  of  New
 York,  shall  not  exceed  the limit prescribed by section 104.00 of the

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  allow  any non-seasonally appointed sworn member or
 officer of the division of law enforcement, police  officer,  or  forest
 ranger  in  the  department  of environmental conservation; any regional
 state park police officer; or any university police  officer  to  become
 covered  by  the  provisions of a special 20-year retirement plan, which
 will provide a benefit of one-half of final average salary upon  retire-
 ment  and  an additional benefit of one-sixtieth of final average salary
 for each year of creditable service in excess of 20 years, not to exceed
 12 years.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $6.6  million  in
 the  annual  contributions  of the State of New York for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future  years  this  cost  will  vary  but  is
 expected to average 3.9% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $70.3 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025. If the State of  New
 York  elects  to  amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for
 each year including interest would be $8.98 million.
  These estimated costs are based on 1,228 affected members employed  by
 the  State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $131 million
 as of March 31, 2023.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the  impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2023 actuari-
 al  valuation.  Distributions and other statistics can be found in the

  PART BB
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature here-
 by finds and declares that an  adjustment  to  pensionable  earnings  of
 first  grade  police  officers is necessary to enhance public safety and
 prevent the loss of vital public services in this state. The legislature
 hereby finds and declares that such adjustment is necessary to  address,
 inter  alia,  the  historic  police  officer  recruitment  and retention
 crisis, the increase in police overtime, and the rise in crime impacting
 New Yorkers.  Therefore, the legislature declares the necessity for  the
 enactment  of  this  act  to  enhance  public safety and protect against
 disruption of vital public services in this state.
  § 2. Section 14-111 of the administrative code of the city of New York
 is amended by adding two new subdivisions c and d to read as follows:
  C.  WHEN A FIRST GRADE POLICE OFFICER OF  THE  NEW  YORK  CITY  POLICE
 DEPARTMENT  SHALL HAVE SERVED IN THE RANK OF POLICE OFFICER FOR A PERIOD
 OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, HE OR SHE SHALL HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS IN RESPECT TO
 THE NEW YORK STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  OR  THE
 NEW  YORK CITY POLICE PENSION FUND AS A POLICE OFFICER DESIGNATED TO ACT
 AS DETECTIVE OF THE THIRD GRADE WHO SHALL HAVE  SERVED  AS  SUCH  FOR  A
 PERIOD  OF  TIME  AGGREGATING TWO YEARS AT THE HIGHEST SALARY RATE FOR A
 DETECTIVE OF THE THIRD GRADE.
  D. WHEN A FIRST GRADE POLICE OFFICER  OF  THE  NEW  YORK  CITY  POLICE
 DEPARTMENT  SHALL HAVE SERVED IN THE RANK OF POLICE OFFICER FOR A PERIOD
 OF THIRTY YEARS, HE OR SHE SHALL HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS IN RESPECT TO  THE
 NEW  YORK  STATE  AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR THE NEW
 YORK CITY POLICE PENSION FUND AS A SERGEANT WHO  SHALL  HAVE  SERVED  AS
 SUCH  FOR  A  PERIOD OF TIME AGGREGATING TWO YEARS AT THE HIGHEST SALARY
 RATE FOR A SERGEANT.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation, as it relates to the New York City
 Police Pension Fund (POLICE), would increase the salary used for  deter-
 mining pension benefits for first grade NYPD officers who have served in
 such  rank  for  25 or 30 years, to salaries equivalent to detective 3rd
 grade or sergeant, respectively.

  Projected  contributions are based on historical experience for Tier 2
 members. Future retirement patterns may differ due to a  larger  Tier  3
 population  (e.g.,  Tier 2 is expected to retire at 20 years of service,
 and Tier 3 is expected to retire at 25 years of service).
  The entire increase in employer contributions will be allocated to New
 York City.
  EXPECTED INCREASE (DECREASE) IN ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES
  The enactment of this proposed legislation is expected to increase the
 Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) by approximately $8.2 million in
 the first year and every year thereafter. Each year's PVFB increase will
 depend on the actual experience  of  benefiting  retirees  and  will  be
 recognized in the year benefits are first payable.

  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census  data  for  POLICE
 active members is summarized below.
 
  POLICE
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  33,800

  - Average Service:  11.3
  - Average Salary:  128,600
 A. 8805--B  63
 
  The salaries used in this analysis were provided by the Police Benevo-
 lent Association of the City of New York and reflect the latest contract
 negotiations. Below is a summary of the salary data provided:
  * Police Officer 1st Grade - $105,146
  * Detective 3rd Grade - $111,999
  * Sergeant - $125,852
  Data  from  prior actuarial valuations was used to estimate the number
 of retirees who could potentially benefit from this proposed legislation
 and is summarized below.
  * Police Officer 1st Grade who retired with 25-29 years in rank -  930
 retired over the past 10 years.
  *  Police  Officer  1st Grade who retired with 30+ years in rank - 218
 retired over the past 10 years.
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: The proposed legislation would permit first
 grade police officers, who have met  certain  service  requirements,  to
 have their pension calculations based on a higher assumed salary.
  For  example,  under this proposed legislation a Tier 2 Police Officer
 1st Grade who holds such position for at least 25, or  30,  years  would
 receive  an  increase  in  their annual pension benefit of approximately
 $4,300 or $12,200 per year, respectively,  due  to  the  higher  assumed
 pensionable salary.
  Based  on an estimate of the number of POLICE members who are expected
 to be impacted by the increased pensionable salary, it is estimated that
 if this proposed legislation is enacted, the annual increase  in  POLICE
 pension  benefits  paid  will be approximately $0.7 million in the first
 year and increase in every year thereafter.
  With respect to an individual member, the impact on  benefits  due  to
 this  proposed  legislation could vary greatly depending on the member's
 age, years of service, retirement cause, and Tier.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods to be used for
 the  Preliminary Fiscal Year 2025 employer contributions of the impacted
 retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  * Future contribution impacts have been developed assuming a homogene-
 ous population and consistent retirement pattern.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary

 impacted population is summarized below.

  - Average Age:  32.8
  - Average Service:  6.1
  - Average Salary:  107,600
 A. 8805--B  66
 
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, Tier 3 POLICE members who retire
 with  at  least  20  years  of service are eligible to receive an annual
 benefit that is equal to 42% of Final Average Salary (FAS),  plus  0.33%
 of FAS for each month of service (up to 24 months) in excess of 20 years
 of  service,  resulting  in  a  benefit  of 50% of FAS after 22 years of
 service.
  Under the proposed legislation, Tier 3 POLICE members who retire  with
 at  least  20  years  of  service would be eligible to receive an annual
 benefit that is equal to 50% of FAS.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems except for:
  * Retirement rates were adjusted to reflect the earlier payability  of
 the service retirement benefit associated with the proposed legislation.
  *  New  entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so that total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
