 subdivision eight of section ten of this chapter, in violation of subdi-
 vision one or one-a of section one hundred twenty-five of  this  chapter
 or  subdivision eight of section one hundred thirty-two of this chapter,
 which shall constitute an unlicensed activity that presents a danger  to
 the public health, safety, and welfare, and shall also enjoin the person
 or  persons  conducting  or  maintaining  such  unlicensed  activity, in
 accordance with the following procedures:
  1. Proceeding for permanent injunction. (a) To the extent  known,  the

 S. 8305  16  A. 8805

 in  the  county  where the unlicensed activity is being conducted, main-
 tained, or permitted OR IN ANY VENUE WHERE A RESPONDENT IS LOCATED.  The

 temporary or permanent relief pursuant to this section.
  (b)  The  proceeding shall name as defendants the building or premises

 permitted,  by  describing it by tax lot and street address and at least

 deemed to be complete upon such mailing by the office as provided above.
 No more than fifteen days prior to such service, the  office,  [or]  the
 attorney  general,  at  the  request  of  and on behalf of the office of
 cannabis management, OR ANY  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  AUTHORIZED  PURSUANT  TO
 SUBDIVISION  EIGHT OF THIS SECTION shall verify the ongoing occupancy of
 any natural person who is a tenant of record and alleged to have  caused
 or permitted the unlicensed activity in the building or premises wherein

 dures relating to such building or premises shall be withdrawn.]

 ant to this section by the office of cannabis management or the attorney

 the  extent  known, provide to the office of cannabis management, within
 three days, the names of any other owners, lessors and  lessees  of  the
 building  or premises that is the subject of the proceeding. Thereafter,
 such owners, lessors and lessees may be made parties to the proceeding.
  (g) Whenever there is evidence that a person was the  manager,  opera-
 tor,  supervisor or, in any other way, in charge of the premises, at the
 S. 8305  17  A. 8805

 time the unlicensed activity was being conducted, maintained, or permit-
 ted, such evidence shall be presumptive that [he or she was]  THEY  WERE

 PARAGRAPH FOR EACH OF ITS PARTNERS OR MEMBERS, AS WELL AS THE  STATE  OR
 OTHER JURISDICTION OF ITS FORMATION;
  (III)  IF  THE  RESPONDING  PARTY IS A CORPORATION, ITS STATE OR OTHER
 JURISDICTION OF INCORPORATION, PRINCIPAL  PLACE  OF  BUSINESS,  AND  ANY
 STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION OF WHICH THAT PARTY IS A CITIZEN;

  (I) If a finding is made that the defendant has conducted, maintained,
 or permitted the unlicensed activity a penalty, to be  included  in  the
 judgment, may be awarded in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars
 for  each  day  it  is found that the defendant intentionally conducted,
 maintained or permitted the unlicensed  activity.  WITH  REGARD  TO  ANY
 DEFENDANT CONDUCTING THE REFERENCED UNLICENSED ACTIVITY, ANY SUCH PENAL-
 TIES  MAY  BE  AWARDED  IN ADDITION TO ANY PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED
 PURSUANT TO SECTION ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO OF THIS CHAPTER. Upon  recov-
 ery, such penalty shall be paid to the office of cannabis management, OR
 TO  THE  COUNTY  ATTORNEY, CORPORATION COUNSEL, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT
 HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION EIGHT  OF  THIS  SECTION  TO
 BRING  AND MAINTAIN A CIVIL PROCEEDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES
 SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION.
  2. Preliminary injunction. (a) Pending a proceeding  for  a  permanent
 injunction  pursuant  to  this section the court may grant a preliminary
 injunction enjoining the unlicensed activity and the person  or  persons
 conducting,  maintaining,  or  permitting  the  unlicensed activity from
 further conducting, maintaining, or permitting the unlicensed  activity,
 where  the  public  health,  safety  or welfare immediately requires the
 granting of such injunction. A temporary closing order  may  be  granted
 pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction where it appears by clear
 and  convincing  evidence  that  unlicensed activity within the scope of
 this section is being conducted, maintained, or permitted and  that  the
 S. 8305  18  A. 8805
 
 public  health, safety or welfare immediately requires the granting of a
 temporary closing order. A temporary restraining order  may  be  granted
 pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction.
  (b)  A  preliminary  injunction shall be enforced by the office or, at
 the request of the office, the attorney general. At the request  of  the
 office,  a  police  officer  or peace officer with jurisdiction may also
 enforce the preliminary injunction.
  (c) The office or the attorney general shall show,  by  affidavit  and
 such other evidence as may be submitted, that there is a cause of action
 for a permanent injunction abating unlicensed activity.
  3.  Temporary  closing  order.  (a)  If, on a motion for a preliminary
 injunction alleging unlicensed activity as described in this section  in
 a  building or premises used for commercial purposes only, the office or
 the attorney general demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence  that
 such  unlicensed  activity  is being conducted, maintained, or permitted
 and that the public health, safety, or welfare  immediately  requires  a
 temporary  closing  order,  a  temporary  order closing such part of the
 building  or  premises  wherein  such  unlicensed  activity  is  being
 conducted, maintained, or permitted may be granted without notice, pend-
 ing  order  of the court granting or refusing the preliminary injunction
 and until further order of the court. Upon granting a temporary  closing
 order,  the court shall direct the holding of a hearing for the prelimi-
 nary injunction at the earliest possible time but no later than  [three]
 TEN  business  days  from  the granting of such order; a decision on the
 motion for a preliminary injunction shall be rendered by the court with-
 in [three business] THIRTY CALENDAR days after  the  conclusion  of  the
 hearing.
  (b)  Unless  the  court  orders  otherwise,  a temporary closing order
 together with the papers upon which it was based and a notice of hearing
 for the preliminary injunction shall be personally served, in  the  same
 manner as a summons as provided in the civil practice law and rules.
  (c) [A temporary closing order shall only be issued prior to a hearing
 on  a  preliminary  injunction  if  the building or premises is used for
 commercial purposes only.
  (d)] No temporary closing order shall be issued against  any  building
 or  premises  where,  in  addition  to  the unlicensed activity which is
 alleged, activity that is licensed or otherwise lawful remains in  place
 AND THE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IS MERELY A DE MINIMIS PART OF THE BUSINESS.
 IN  ASSESSING  WHETHER UNLICENSED ACTIVITY WITHIN A BUILDING OR PREMISES
 IS MORE THAN DE MINIMIS, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS  AS:  (I)
 THE PRESENCE OF SIGNS OR SYMBOLS, INDOORS OR OUT, ADVERTISING UNLICENSED
 ACTIVITY  OR OTHERWISE INDICATING THAT CANNABIS IS SOLD ON THE PREMISES;
 (II)  INFORMATION  SHARED  IN  ANY  ADVERTISEMENTS  OR  OTHER  MARKETING
 CONTENT,  INCLUDING  BUT NOT LIMITED TO SOCIAL MEDIA, IN CONNECTION WITH
 THE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY; (III) THE LAYOUT OF THE BUSINESS WITH REGARD TO
 LAWFUL AND UNLICENSED ACTIVITIES OCCURRING ON THE PREMISES; AND (IV)  AN
 ASSESSMENT  OF  THE  VOLUME  OF CANNABIS, CANNABIS PRODUCTS, CANNABINOID
 HEMP, HEMP EXTRACT PRODUCT, OR ANY PRODUCT MARKETED OR LABELED  AS  SUCH
 AT SUCH PLACE OF BUSINESS. In addition, no temporary closing order shall
 be  issued  against  any  building  or premises which is used in part as
 residence and pursuant to local law or ordinance is zoned  and  lawfully
 occupied as a residence.
  4.  Temporary restraining order. (a) If, on a motion for a preliminary
 injunction alleging unlicensed activity as described in this section  in
 a  building  or premises used for commercial purposes, the office or the
 attorney general demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that such
 S. 8305  19  A. 8805
 
 unlicensed activity is being conducted,  maintained,  or  permitted  and
 that the public health, safety, or welfare immediately requires a tempo-
 rary  restraining  order,  a  temporary restraining order may be granted
 without  notice restraining the defendants and all persons from removing
 or in any manner interfering with the furniture,  fixtures  and  movable
 property  used  in conducting, maintaining or permitting such unlicensed
 activity, including [adult-use] cannabis, CANNABIS PRODUCT,  CANNABINOID
 HEMP OR HEMP EXTRACT PRODUCT, OR ANY PRODUCT MARKETED OR LABELED AS SUCH
 and  from  further conducting, maintaining or permitting such unlicensed
 activity, pending order of the court granting or refusing  the  prelimi-
 nary  injunction  and  until further order of the court. Upon granting a
 temporary restraining order, the court shall direct  the  holding  of  a
 hearing for the preliminary injunction at the earliest possible time but
 no  later  than  three  business days from the granting of such order; a
 decision on the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be rendered by
 the court within [three business] THIRTY CALENDAR days after the conclu-
 sion of the hearing.
  (b) Unless the court orders otherwise, a temporary  restraining  order
 and  the  papers upon which it was based and a notice of hearing for the
 preliminary injunction shall be personally served, in the same manner as
 a summons as provided in the civil practice  law  and  rules,  UPON  ANY
 AGENT, EMPLOYEE, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEFENDANT BUSINESS PRES-
 ENT AT THE TIME THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER IS EFFECTUATED.
  5.  Temporary  closing  order; temporary restraining order; additional
 enforcement procedures. (a) If on a motion for a preliminary injunction,
 the office of  cannabis  management  or  the  attorney  general  submits
 evidence  warranting  both  a  temporary  closing  order and a temporary
 restraining order, the court shall grant both orders.
  (b) Upon the request of the office, any police officer or peace  offi-
 cer with jurisdiction may assist in the enforcement of a temporary clos-
 ing order and temporary restraining order. ANY REFERENCE TO POLICE OFFI-
 CER  OR PEACE OFFICER IN THIS SUBDIVISION AND SUBDIVISIONS SIX AND SEVEN
 OF THIS SECTION SHALL ALSO INCLUDE  ANY  INVESTIGATOR  EMPLOYED  BY  THE
 OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
  (c)  The  police  officer or peace officer serving a temporary closing
 order or a temporary restraining order shall forthwith make  and  return
 to  the  court an inventory of personal property situated in and used in
 conducting, maintaining, or permitting the  unlicensed  activity  within
 the  scope of this chapter and shall enter upon the building or premises
 for such purpose. Such inventory shall be taken in any manner  which  is
 deemed  likely  to  evidence  a  true and accurate representation of the
 personal property subject to such inventory including, but  not  limited
 to  photographing  such personal property, EXCEPT THAT ANY CASH FOUND ON
 THE PREMISES DURING SUCH INVENTORY SHALL  BE  INVENTORIED,  SEIZED,  AND
 SECURED  OFF  PREMISES  PENDING  FURTHER  ORDER OF THE COURT. ANY POLICE
 OFFICER OR PEACE OFFICER, OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OFFICE, SHALL  BE
 PERMITTED  TO  REVIEW  AND  COPY  RECORDS,  INCLUDING ELECTRONIC RECORDS
 STORED ON CLOUD PLATFORMS.
  (d) The police officer or peace officer serving  a  temporary  closing
 order  shall,  upon service of the order, command all persons present in
 the building or premises to vacate  the  premises  forthwith.  Upon  the
 building  or  premises  being  vacated,  the  premises shall be securely
 locked and all keys delivered to the officer serving the order who ther-
 eafter [shall] MAY deliver the keys to the fee owner, lessor, or  lessee
 of  the  building  or  premises  involved.  If the fee owner, lessor, or
 lessee is not at the building  or  premises  when  the  order  is  being
 S. 8305  20  A. 8805
 
 executed, the officer shall securely padlock the premises and retain the
 keys  until  the  fee owner, lessor, or lessee of the building is ascer-
 tained, in which event, the officer [shall] MAY deliver the keys to such
 owner,  lessor,  or  lessee  OR RETAIN THEM PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE
 COURT.
  (e) Upon service of a temporary closing order or a temporary restrain-
 ing order, the police officer or peace officer shall post a copy thereof
 in a conspicuous place or upon one or more of  the  principal  doors  at
 entrances  of  such  premises  where  the  unlicensed  activity is being
 conducted, maintained, or permitted.  In  addition,  where  a  temporary
 closing  order has been granted, the officer shall affix, in a conspicu-
 ous place or upon one or more of the principal  doors  at  entrances  of
 such  premises,  a  printed notice that the premises have been closed by
 court order, which notice shall contain  the  legend  "closed  by  court
 order"  in  block  lettering of sufficient size to be observed by anyone
 intending or likely to enter the premises, the date of  the  order,  the
 court  from  which issued, and the name of the officer or agency posting
 the notice. In addition, where a temporary restraining  order  has  been
 granted,  the  police  officer or peace officer shall affix, in the same
 manner, a notice similar to the notice provided for  in  relation  to  a
 temporary  closing order except that the notice shall state that certain
 described activity is prohibited by court  order  and  that  removal  of
 property  is  prohibited by court order. Mutilation or removal of such a
 posted order or such a posted notice while it remains in force, in addi-
 tion to any other punishment prescribed by law, shall be punishable,  on
 conviction,  by  a  fine  of  not  more than five thousand dollars or by
 imprisonment not exceeding ninety days, or by both, provided such  order
 or  notice contains therein a notice of such penalty. Any police officer
 or peace officer with jurisdiction may, upon the request of the  office,
 assist in the enforcement of this section.
  6.  Temporary  closing order; temporary restraining order; defendant's
 remedies. (a) A temporary closing order or a temporary restraining order
 [shall] MAY be vacated, upon notice to the  office  AND  TO  ANY  COUNTY
 ATTORNEY,  CORPORATION  COUNSEL,  OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
 AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION EIGHT OF THIS SECTION  TO  BRING  AND
 MAINTAIN  THE  PROCEEDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN
 THIS SECTION, if [the] A defendant WHO IS  THE  FEE  OWNER,  LESSOR,  OR
 LESSEE  OF  THE  BUILDING  OR PREMISES shows by affidavit and such other
 proof as may be submitted that the unlicensed activity within the  scope
 of  this  chapter  has been abated AND THAT THEY ARE ALSO NOT AFFILIATED
 WITH THE PERSON WHO IS CONDUCTING  THE  UNLICENSED  ACTIVITY.  An  order
 vacating  a  temporary  closing  order  or a temporary restraining order
 shall include a provision authorizing the office, OR ANY  COUNTY  ATTOR-
 NEY, CORPORATION COUNSEL, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AS APPLICABLE, to inspect
 the  building  or premises which is the subject of a proceeding pursuant
 to this subdivision, periodically without notice, during the pendency of
 the proceeding for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the  unli-
 censed  activity  has  been resumed. Any police officer or peace officer
 with jurisdiction may, upon the request of the  office,  assist  in  the
 enforcement  of an inspection provision of an order vacating a temporary
 closing order or temporary restraining order.
  (b) A temporary closing order or a temporary restraining order may  be
 vacated by the court, upon notice to the office, OR ANY COUNTY ATTORNEY,
 CORPORATION  COUNSEL,  OR  LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AS APPLICABLE, when [the] A
 defendant ENTITLED TO REQUEST VACATUR PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (A) OF  THIS
 SUBDIVISION  gives  an  undertaking  and the court is satisfied that the
 S. 8305  21  A. 8805
 
 public health, safety, or welfare will be  protected  adequately  during
 the  pendency  of  the proceeding. The undertaking shall be in an amount
 equal to the assessed valuation of the building or  premises  where  the
 unlicensed  activity  is being conducted, maintained, or permitted or in
 such other amount as may be fixed by the court. The defendant shall  pay
 to  the  office  and  the  attorney  general, in the event a judgment of
 permanent injunction is  obtained,  their  actual  costs,  expenses  and
 disbursements  in  bringing and maintaining the proceeding. In addition,
 the defendant shall pay to the local government or law enforcement agen-
 cy that provided assistance in enforcing any order of the  court  issued
 pursuant  to  a proceeding brought under this section, its actual costs,
 expenses and disbursements in assisting  with  the  enforcement  of  the
 proceeding.
  7.  Permanent  injunction. (a) A judgment awarding a permanent injunc-
 tion pursuant to this chapter shall direct that  any  illicit  cannabis,
 CANNABIS PRODUCT, CANNABINOID HEMP OR HEMP EXTRACT PRODUCT, OR ANY PROD-
 UCT  MARKETED  OR  LABELED  AS  SUCH  seized shall be turned over to the
 office of cannabis management or their  authorized  representative.  The
 judgment  may  further  direct  any police officer or peace officer with
 jurisdiction to seize and remove from the building or premises all mate-
 rial, equipment, and instrumentalities used in the creation and  mainte-
 nance  of the unlicensed activity and shall direct the sale by the sher-
 iff of any such property in the manner provided for the sale of personal
 property under execution pursuant to the provisions of the  civil  prac-
 tice  law  and rules, IF THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE PROPERTY EXCEEDS THE
 ESTIMATED LAWFUL EXPENSES OF SUCH SALE, OR THE DISPOSAL OF THE  PROPERTY
 IF  THE  ESTIMATED  VALUE  OF THE PROPERTY DOES NOT EXCEED THE ESTIMATED
 LAWFUL EXPENSES OF SUCH SALE. The net proceeds of any such  sale,  after
 deduction  of the lawful expenses involved, shall be paid to the general
 fund of the state.
  (b) A judgment awarding a permanent injunction pursuant to this  chap-
 ter  may  direct  the  closing of the building or premises by any police
 officer or peace officer with jurisdiction to the  extent  necessary  to
 abate  the  unlicensed  activity  and shall direct any police officer or
 peace officer with jurisdiction to post a copy of  the  judgment  and  a
 printed  notice  of  such closing conforming to the requirements of this
 chapter. The closing directed by the judgment shall be for  such  period
 as the court may direct but in no event shall the closing be for a peri-
 od  of  more than one year from the posting of the judgment provided for
 in this section.  If the owner shall file a bond in  the  value  of  the
 property  ordered  to  be closed and submits proof to the court that the
 unlicensed activity has been abated and will not be created, maintained,
 or permitted for such period of time as the  building  or  premises  has
 been  directed to be closed in the judgment, AND ALSO SUBMITS PROOF THAT
 THEY ARE ALSO NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE PERSON WHO IS CONDUCTING THE UNLI-
 CENSED ACTIVITY, the court may vacate the  provisions  of  the  judgment
 that  direct  the  closing  of  the building or premises. A closing by a
 police officer or  peace  officer  with  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of  this  section shall not constitute an act of possession,
 ownership, or control by such police officer or  peace  officer  of  the
 closed premises.
  (c)  Upon  the  request  of  the  office of cannabis management or its
 authorized representative, OR ANY COUNTY ATTORNEY, CORPORATION  COUNSEL,
 OR  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  AUTHORIZED  PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION EIGHT OF THIS
 SECTION TO BRING AND MAINTAIN A CIVIL PROCEEDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE
 PROCEDURES  SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, any police officer or peace offi-
 S. 8305  22  A. 8805
 
 cer with jurisdiction may assist in the enforcement of a judgment award-
 ing a permanent injunction entered in a proceeding brought  pursuant  to
 this chapter.
  (d)  A  judgment  rendered awarding a permanent injunction pursuant to
 this chapter shall be and become a lien upon the  building  or  premises
 named  in  the  petition  in such proceeding, such lien to date from the
 time of filing a notice of lis pendens in the office of the clerk of the
 county wherein the building or premises  is  located.  Every  such  lien
 shall  have priority before any mortgage or other lien that exists prior
 to such filing except tax and assessment liens.
  (e) A judgment awarding a permanent injunction pursuant to this  chap-
 ter shall provide, in addition to the costs and disbursements allowed by
 the  civil  practice law and rules, upon satisfactory proof by affidavit
 or such other evidence as may be submitted, the actual  costs,  expenses
 and  disbursements  of  the  office  and the attorney general, OR OF ANY
 COUNTY ATTORNEY, CORPORATION COUNSEL,  OR  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  AUTHORIZED
 PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  EIGHT OF THIS SECTION TO BRING AND MAINTAIN A
 CIVIL PROCEEDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES  SET  FORTH  IN  THIS
 SECTION, in bringing and maintaining the proceeding.
  8.  Civil  proceedings.  In  addition to the authority granted in this
 section to the office of cannabis management and the  attorney  general,
 ANY  county  attorney, corporation counsel, or local government in which
 such building or premises is located may, after the office  of  cannabis
 management  grants  permission  in  writing,  bring and maintain a civil
 proceeding in the supreme court of the county in which the  building  or
 premises  is  located  to  permanently  enjoin  the  unlicensed activity
 described in this section and the person or persons conducting or  main-
 taining  such unlicensed activity, in accordance with the procedures set
 forth in this section. The office shall be permitted to intervene as  of
 right in any such proceeding. Any such governmental entity which obtains
 a  permanent  injunction  pursuant  to this chapter shall be awarded, in
 addition to the costs and disbursements allowed by  the  civil  practice
 law  and  rules,  upon  satisfactory  proof  by  affidavit or such other
 evidence as may be submitted, ANY PENALTIES AWARDED  PURSUANT  TO  PARA-
 GRAPH  (H)  OF  SUBDIVISION  ONE OR PARAGRAPH (E) OF SUBDIVISION FIVE OF
 THIS SECTION AND the actual costs, expenses and disbursements in  bring-
 ing  and  maintaining  the  proceeding.  The  authority provided by this
 subdivision shall be in addition to, and shall not be deemed to diminish
 or reduce, any rights of the parties described  in  this  section  under
 existing  law  for  any  violation pursuant to this chapter or any other
 law.

 S. 8305  25  A. 8805

 tional civil penalty in an amount of no more than five times the revenue
 from such prohibited sales or, in an amount of no more than three  times
 the  projected  revenue  for any such product found in the possession of
 such person based on the retail list price of such  products;  provided,
 however,  that any such person who engages in such activity from a resi-
 dence or other real property not otherwise  held  out  as  open  to  the
 public or otherwise being utilized in a business or commercial manner or
 any  private vehicle on or about same such property, and the quantity of
 such product on such premises or vehicle does not exceed the  limits  of
 personal  use under article two hundred twenty-two of the penal law, may
 be subject to a civil penalty of no more than five thousand dollars.
  Provided, further, that where such person has been  ordered  to  cease
 such  conduct pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-
 eight-a of this [chapter] ARTICLE, such person may be assessed  a  civil
 penalty  of  no  more  than twenty thousand dollars per day for each day
 during which such violation continues  after  receiving  such  order  in
 addition  to  the  additional civil penalties set forth above; provided,
 however, that any such person who engages in such activity from a  resi-

 the office or the board, shall be authorized to apply, without notice to
 such person, to the supreme court in the county in which  the  place  of
 business  is located for an order granting the office or board access to
 such place of business. The court may grant such an order if  it  deter-
 mines,  based  on evidence presented by the attorney general, that there
 is reasonable cause to believe that such place of business is a place of
 business which does not possess a valid registration, license, or permit
 issued by the office or board.
  (c) In assessing the civil penalties under this subdivision OR  SUBDI-

 S. 8305  26  A. 8805
 
 INITIAL  INSPECTION  AND  THE  LAST  OBSERVED  OR  OTHERWISE  DOCUMENTED
 CONDUCT, AND SHALL REQUIRE THE IMPOSITION OF THE MAXIMUM PER DAY PENALTY
 PERMITTED  UNDER  PARAGRAPH  (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, AND THE DOCUMENTED
 PRESENCE  OF SUCH CONDUCT UPON OR AT THE COMPLETION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE
 INSPECTION OR INVESTIGATION SHALL REQUIRE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE  MAXIMUM
 PENALTY PERMITTED UNDER PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  1-a. Any person [found to have] WHO engaged in indirect retail sale in
 violation  of  subdivision  one-a  of section one hundred twenty-five of
 this [chapter] ARTICLE, shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount
 equaling the lesser of three times the revenue for such indirect  retail
 sales  or  up  to  two thousand five hundred dollars for each such sale,
 provided, however, that where such conduct also constitutes a  violation
 of  subdivision  one of this section, such person may only be subject to
 the civil penalties under one such subdivision, and  provided,  further,
 that  where  such person has been ordered to cease such conduct pursuant
 to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-a of  this  arti-
 cle,  such person may be assessed a civil penalty of up to five thousand
 dollars for each day during which such violation continues  in  addition
 to any civil penalties set forth above.

 DURING PREGNANCY RELATED TO SUCH PREGNANCY. PRENATAL CARE INCLUDES PHYS-

  §  3.  Paragraph  (a)  of subdivision 2 of section 204 of the workers'
 compensation law, as added by section 5 of part SS of chapter 54 of  the
 laws of 2016, is amended to read as follows:
  (a)  The  weekly  benefit for family leave that occurs (i) on or after
 January first, two thousand eighteen shall not exceed eight weeks during
 any fifty-two week calendar period and shall be  fifty  percent  of  the
 employee's average weekly wage but shall not exceed fifty percent of the
 state  average weekly wage, (ii) on or after January first, two thousand
 nineteen shall not exceed ten weeks during any fifty-two  week  calendar
 period  and shall be fifty-five percent of the employee's average weekly
 wage but shall not exceed fifty-five percent of the state average weekly
 wage, (iii) on or after January first, two  thousand  twenty  shall  not

 CALENDAR PERIOD AND SUCH LEAVE FOR PRENATAL CARE MAY BE TAKEN IN  HOURLY
 INCREMENTS  AND  IN  ADDITION  TO  ANY  OTHER  FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS THE

 superintendent  of financial services shall have discretion to delay the
 increases in the family leave benefit level  provided  in  subparagraphs
 (ii),  (iii),  and (iv) of this paragraph by one or more calendar years.
 S. 8305  36  A. 8805
 
 In determining whether to delay the increase in the family leave benefit
 for any year, the superintendent of financial services  shall  consider:
 (1)  the  current  cost to employees of the family leave benefit and any
 expected  change in the cost after the benefit increase; (2) the current
 number of insurers issuing insurance policies with a family leave  bene-
 fit and any expected change in the number of insurers issuing such poli-
 cies  after the benefit increase; (3) the impact of the benefit increase
 on employers' business and the overall stability of the program  to  the
 extent  that  information  is  readily  available; (4) the impact of the
 benefit increase on the financial stability of the disability and family
 leave insurance market and carriers; and (5) any additional factors that
 the superintendent of financial services deems relevant. If  the  super-
 intendent  of financial services delays the increase in the family leave
 benefit level for one or more calendar years, the family  leave  benefit
 level  that  shall  take effect immediately following the delay shall be
 the same benefit level that would have taken effect but for  the  delay.
 The  weekly  benefits  for  family leave that occurs on or after January
 first, two thousand eighteen shall not be less than one hundred  dollars
 per week except that if the employee's wages at the time of family leave
 are  less  than one hundred dollars per week, the employee shall receive
 his or her full wages. Benefits may be payable  to  employees  for  paid
 family  leave  taken intermittently or for less than a full work week in
 increments of one full day or one fifth of the weekly benefit.  NOTWITH-
 STANDING THE FOREGOING, FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS  UNDER  PARAGRAPH  (D)  OF
 SUBDIVISION  FIFTEEN  OF  SECTION TWO HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE MAY BE
 PAYABLE TO EMPLOYEES IN HOURLY INCREMENTS.
  § 4. Section 205 of the  workers'  compensation  law,  as  amended  by

  § 205. Disabilities, family leave and periods for which  benefits  are
 not  payable.  1.  No  employee shall be entitled to disability benefits
 under this article:
  (a) For more than twenty-six weeks minus any  days  taken  for  family
 leave during any fifty-two consecutive calendar weeks during a period of
 fifty-two  consecutive  calendar weeks or during any one period of disa-
 bility, or for more than twenty-six weeks; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT FAMI-
 LY LEAVE UNDER PARAGRAPH (D)  OF  SUBDIVISION  FIFTEEN  OF  SECTION  TWO
 HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL NOT REDUCE THIS AMOUNT;
  (b) for any period of disability during which an employee is not under
 the  care  of  a  duly  licensed physician or with respect to disability
 resulting from a condition of the foot which may lawfully be treated  by
 a  duly  registered  and licensed podiatrist of the state of New York or
 with respect to a  disability  resulting  from  a  condition  which  may
 lawfully  be  treated  by a duly registered and licensed chiropractor of
 the state of New York or with respect to a disability resulting  from  a
 condition  which  may  lawfully be treated by a duly licensed dentist of
 the state of New York or with respect to a disability resulting  from  a
 condition  which  may  lawfully  be  treated  by  a  duly registered and
 licensed psychologist of the state of New York  or  with  respect  to  a
 disability resulting from a condition which may lawfully be treated by a
 duly  certified  nurse midwife, for any period of such disability during
 which an employee is neither under the care of a physician nor a  podia-
 trist,  nor  a  chiropractor,  nor  a dentist, nor a psychologist, nor a
 certified nurse midwife; and for any period of disability  during  which
 an  employee  who  adheres  to  the  faith or teachings of any church or
 denomination and who in accordance with its creed, tenets or  principles
 S. 8305  37  A. 8805
 
 depends  for  healing  upon  prayer through spiritual means alone in the
 practice of religion, is not under  the  care  of  a  practitioner  duly
 accredited  by  the  church  or denomination, and provided such employee
 shall submit to all physical examinations as required by this chapter.
  2.  No  employee shall be entitled to family leave benefits under this
 article:
  (a) For more than twelve weeks, or the maximum duration  permitted  as
 set  forth  in  paragraph  (a) of subdivision two of section two hundred
 four of this article, during a period of fifty-two consecutive  calendar
 weeks,  or  for  any  period in which the family leave combined with the
 disability benefits previously paid exceeds twenty-six weeks during  the
 same fifty-two consecutive calendar weeks; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT FAMI-
 LY  LEAVE  UNDER  PARAGRAPH  (D)  OF  SUBDIVISION FIFTEEN OF SECTION TWO
 HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL NOT REDUCE THIS AMOUNT;
  (b) For any period of family leave  wherein  the  notice  and  medical
 certification  as  prescribed  by  the  chair has not been filed. At the
 discretion of the chair or chair's  designee  pursuant  to  section  two
 hundred twenty-one of this article, the family member who is the recipi-
 ent  of  care  may  be required to submit to a physical examination by a
 qualified health care provider. Such examination shall be  paid  for  by
 the carrier; and
  (c)  As  a  condition of an employee's initial receipt of family leave
 benefits during any fifty-two consecutive calendar  weeks  in  which  an
 employee  is  eligible  for  these  benefits,  an  employer may offer an
 employee who has accrued but unused  vacation  time  or  personal  leave
 available at the time of use of available family leave to choose whether
 to  charge  all  or  part of the family leave time to accrued but unused
 vacation or personal leave, and receive full salary, or  to  not  charge
 time  to  accrued but unused vacation or personal leave, and receive the
 benefit as set forth in section two hundred four  of  this  article.  An
 employer  that  pays  full  salary  during  a period of family leave may
 request reimbursement in accordance with section two hundred thirty-sev-
 en of this article. With the election of  either  option,  the  employee
 shall  receive  the  full  protection of the reinstatement provision set
 forth in section two hundred three-b of this article, and shall  concur-
 rently  use  available  family  medical  leave act and paid family leave
 credits. In no event can an employee utilize family leave beyond  twelve
 weeks,  or  the maximum duration permitted as set forth in paragraph (a)
 of subdivision two of section two hundred four of this article, per  any
 fifty-two week period set forth in this article; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
 FAMILY  LEAVE  UNDER PARAGRAPH (D) OF SUBDIVISION FIFTEEN OF SECTION TWO
 HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL NOT REDUCE THIS AMOUNT. This paragraph
 may not be construed in a manner that relieves an employer of  any  duty
 of  collective  bargaining  the  employer  may  have with respect to the
 subject matter of this paragraph.
  3. No employee shall be entitled to disability or family  leave  bene-
 fits under this article:
  (a)  for  any  disability  occasioned  by  the wilful intention of the
 employee to bring about injury to or the sickness of himself or another,
 or resulting from any injury or sickness sustained in  the  perpetration
 by the employee of an illegal act;
  (b) for any day of disability or family leave during which the employ-
 ee  performed  work  for remuneration or profit; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
 FAMILY LEAVE UNDER PARAGRAPH (D) OF SUBDIVISION FIFTEEN OF  SECTION  TWO
 HUNDRED ONE OF THIS ARTICLE MAY BE TAKEN IN HOURLY INCREMENTS;
 S. 8305  38  A. 8805

  (c)  for  any day of disability or family leave for which the employee
 is entitled to receive from his or her employer, or from a fund to which
 the employer has contributed, remuneration or maintenance in  an  amount
 equal to or greater than that to which he or she would be entitled under
 this  article;  but  any voluntary contribution or aid which an employer
 may make to an employee or any supplementary benefit paid to an employee
 pursuant to the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or  from
 a  trust fund to which contributions are made pursuant to the provisions
 of a collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered as  contin-
 ued remuneration or maintenance for this purpose;
  (d)  for  any  period  in respect to which such employee is subject to
 suspension or  disqualification  of  the  accumulation  of  unemployment
 insurance benefit rights, or would be subject if he or she were eligible
 for  such  benefit  rights,  except for ineligibility resulting from the
 employee's disability;
  (e) for any disability due to any act of war, declared or undeclared;
  (f) for any disability or family leave commencing before the  employee
 becomes eligible to benefits under this section.
  4. An employee may not collect benefits concurrently under both subdi-
 visions one and two of this section.
  5.  In any case in which the necessity for family leave is foreseeable
 based on an expected birth or placement, the employee shall provide  the
 employer with not less than thirty days notice before the date the leave
 is to begin, of the employee's intention to take family leave under this
 article,  except  that  if  the  date of the birth or placement requires
 leave to begin in less than thirty days, the employee shall provide such
 notice as is practicable. In any case in which the necessity for  family
 leave  is  foreseeable  based on planned medical treatment, the employee
 shall provide the employer with not less than thirty days notice, before
 the date the leave is to begin, of the employees intention to take fami-
 ly leave under this article, except that if the date  of  the  treatment

  (d) WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LEAVE FOR PRENATAL CARE WHICH MAY  BE  TAKEN
 IN  HOURLY INCREMENTS, for any day in which claimant works at least part
 of that day for remuneration or profit for the covered employer  or  for
 any  other employer while working for remuneration or profit, for him or
 herself, or another person or entity, during the same  or  substantially
 similar working hours as those of the covered employer from which family
 leave  benefits  are  claimed, except that occasional scheduling adjust-
 ments with respect to secondary employments shall not prevent receipt of
 family leave benefits.
  § 6. Subdivision 1 of section 208 of the workers' compensation law, as
 amended by section 9 of part SS of chapter 54 of the laws  of  2016,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  1. Benefits provided under this article shall be paid periodically and
 promptly  and,  except  as to a contested period of disability or family
 leave, without any decision by the  board,  or  designee  of  the  chair
 pursuant  to  section  two hundred twenty-one of this article. The first
 payment of benefits shall be due on the fourteenth day of disability  or
 family  leave and benefits for that period shall be paid directly to the
 employee within four business days thereafter or  within  four  business
 days  after  the  filing  of  required  proof of claim, whichever is the
 S. 8305  39  A. 8805
 
 later.  FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS FOR PRENATAL CARE MAY BE  PAID  IN  HOURLY
 INSTALLMENTS  OR, UPON ELECTION OF THE EMPLOYER OR INSURANCE CARRIER AND

 or  carrier  rejects  an  initial  claim  for family leave benefits, the
 employer or carrier must notify the employee in a manner  prescribed  by
 the chair within eighteen days of filing of the proof of claim.  Failure
 to  timely  reject  shall constitute a waiver of objection to the family
 leave claim. Thereafter benefits shall be due and payable  bi-weekly  in
 like  manner.  The  chair  or  chair's designee, pursuant to section two
 hundred twenty-one of this article, may determine that benefits  may  be
 paid  monthly  or  semi-monthly if wages were so paid, and may authorize
 deviation from the foregoing requirements to facilitate  prompt  payment
 of benefits. Any inquiry which requires the employee's response in order
 to continue benefits uninterrupted or unmodified shall provide a reason-
 able  time  period in which to respond and include a clear and prominent
 statement of the deadline for responding and consequences of failing  to
 respond.
  § 7. Subdivision 1 of section 217 of the workers' compensation law, as
 amended  by  section 16 of part SS of chapter 54 of the laws of 2016, is
 amended to read as follows:
  1. Written notice and proof of disability or proof of need for  family
 leave shall be furnished to the employer by or on behalf of the employee
 claiming  benefits  or,  in  the  case  of  a claimant under section two
 hundred seven of this article, to the chair, within  thirty  days  after
 commencement  of the period of disability OR FAMILY LEAVE, OR FOR FAMILY
 LEAVE FOR PRENATAL CARE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE  LAST  HOUR  FOR  SUCH
 LEAVE  PERIOD  AS  PRESCRIBED  IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED
 EIGHT OF THIS ARTICLE.  Additional proof shall be  furnished  thereafter
 from  time  to  time as the employer or carrier or chair may require but
 not more often than once each week. Such proof shall include a statement
 of disability by the employee's attending physician or attending  podia-
 trist  or  attending  chiropractor  or  attending  dentist  or attending
 psychologist or attending certified nurse midwife or family  leave  care
 recipient's  health  care  provider,  or  in the case of an employee who
 adheres to the faith or teachings of any church or denomination, and who
 in accordance with its creed, tenets or principles depends  for  healing
 upon  prayer  through spiritual means alone in the practice of religion,
 by an accredited practitioner, containing facts and opinions as to  such
 disability  in  compliance  with  regulations  of  the chair. Failure to
 furnish notice or proof within the time and in the manner above provided
 shall not invalidate the claim but no benefits shall be required  to  be
 paid  for  any period more than two weeks prior to the date on which the
 required proof is furnished unless it shall be shown to the satisfaction
 of the chair not to have been reasonably possible to furnish such notice
 or proof and that such notice or proof was furnished as soon  as  possi-
 ble;  provided,  however,  that  no  benefits  shall  be paid unless the
 required proof of disability is furnished within the  period  of  actual
 disability  or  family  leave that does not exceed the statutory maximum
 period permitted under section two hundred  four  of  this  article.  No
 limitation  of  time  provided  in this section shall run as against any
 disabled employee who is mentally incompetent, or  physically  incapable
 of  providing such notice as a result of a serious medical condition, or
 S. 8305  40  A. 8805
 
 a minor so long as such person has no  guardian  of  the  person  and/or
 property.

  §  204.  Disability  and family leave during employment. 1. Disability

 beginning  with  the  eighth day of disability and thereafter during the

 The  superintendent of financial services shall have discretion to delay

 graphs  (ii),  (iii), and (iv) of this paragraph by one or more calendar

 benefit  for  any  year,  the superintendent of financial services shall
 consider: (1) the current cost to employees of the family leave  benefit
 and  any expected change in the cost after the benefit increase; (2) the
 current number of insurers issuing  insurance  policies  with  a  family
 leave  benefit and any expected change in the number of insurers issuing

 increase on employers' business and the overall stability of the program

 OF FINANCIAL SERVICES SHALL HAVE DISCRETION TO DELAY  THE  INCREASES  IN
 THE DISABILITY BENEFIT LEVEL PROVIDED IN SUBPARAGRAPHS (II), (III), (IV)
 AND  (V) OF THIS PARAGRAPH BY ONE OR MORE CALENDAR YEARS. IN DETERMINING
 WHETHER TO DELAY THE INCREASE IN THE DISABILITY BENEFIT  FOR  ANY  YEAR,
 THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES SHALL CONSIDER: (1) THE CURRENT
 COST  TO  EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS OF THE BENEFIT AND ANY EXPECTED CHANGE
 IN THE COST AFTER THE BENEFIT INCREASE; (2) THE CURRENT NUMBER OF INSUR-
 ERS ISSUING  INSURANCE  POLICIES  WITH  A  DISABILITY  BENEFIT  AND  ANY
 S. 8305  43  A. 8805
 
 EXPECTED  CHANGE  IN  THE NUMBER OF INSURERS ISSUING SUCH POLICIES AFTER
 THE BENEFIT INCREASE; (3) THE IMPACT OF THE BENEFIT INCREASE ON  EMPLOY-
 ERS'  BUSINESS  AND  THE  OVERALL STABILITY OF THE PROGRAM TO THE EXTENT
 THAT  INFORMATION  IS  READILY  AVAILABLE; (4) THE IMPACT OF THE BENEFIT
 INCREASE ON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE DISABILITY AND  FAMILY  LEAVE
 INSURANCE  MARKET  AND CARRIERS; AND (5) ANY ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT THE
 SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES DEEMS RELEVANT. IF THE  SUPERINTEN-
 DENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES DELAYS THE INCREASE IN THE DISABILITY BENEFIT
 LEVEL  FOR ONE OR MORE CALENDAR YEARS, THE DISABILITY BENEFIT LEVEL THAT
 SHALL TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE  DELAY  SHALL  BE  THE  SAME
 BENEFIT LEVEL THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN EFFECT BUT FOR THE DELAY. THE WEEKLY
 BENEFIT WHICH THE DISABLED EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FOR THE PERI-
 ODS  OF  DISABILITY AFTER THE TWELFTH WEEK OF DISABILITY AND THROUGH THE
 TWENTY-SIXTH WEEK OF DISABILITY (A) ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOU-
 SAND TWENTY-FIVE SHALL BE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S AVERAGE WEEKLY
 WAGE BUT SHALL NOT EXCEED TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS PER WEEK; (B) ON OR

 DOLLARS PER WEEK EXCEPT THAT IF THE EMPLOYEE'S  WAGES  AT  THE  TIME  OF
 FAMILY  LEAVE  ARE  LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK, THE EMPLOYEE
 SHALL RECEIVE THEIR FULL WAGES. The weekly benefit  which  the  disabled
 employee  is  entitled  to receive for disability commencing on or after
 May first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine AND PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST,  TWO
 THOUSAND  TWENTY-FIVE  shall  be one-half of the employee's weekly wage,
 but in no case shall such benefit exceed one  hundred  seventy  dollars;
 except  that  if  the employee's average weekly wage is less than twenty
 dollars, the benefit shall be such average weekly wage. The weekly bene-
 fit which the disabled employee is entitled to  receive  for  disability
 commencing on or after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-four shall be
 one-half  of the employee's weekly wage, but in no case shall such bene-
 fit exceed one hundred forty-five dollars; except that if the employee's
 average weekly wage is less than twenty dollars, the  benefit  shall  be
 such average weekly wage. The weekly benefit which the disabled employee
 is entitled to receive for disability commencing on or after July first,
 nineteen  hundred eighty-three and prior to July first, nineteen hundred
 eighty-four shall be one-half of the employee's average weekly wage, but
 in no case shall such benefit exceed one hundred thirty-five dollars nor
 be less than twenty dollars; except that if the employee's average week-
 ly wage is less than twenty dollars the benefit shall  be  such  average
 weekly  wage. The weekly benefit which the disabled employee is entitled
 to receive for disability commencing on or after  July  first,  nineteen
 hundred  seventy-four, and prior to July first, nineteen hundred eighty-
 three, shall be one-half of the employee's average weekly wage,  but  in
 no  case  shall such benefit exceed ninety-five dollars nor be less than
 twenty dollars; except that if the employee's  average  weekly  wage  is
 less than twenty dollars, the benefit shall be such average weekly wage.
 The  weekly  benefit  which the disabled employee is entitled to receive
 for disability commencing on  or  after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
 seventy  and prior to July first, nineteen hundred seventy-four shall be
 one-half of the employee's average weekly wage, but  in  no  case  shall
 S. 8305  44  A. 8805
 
 such  benefit  exceed  seventy-five  dollars  nor  be  less  than twenty
 dollars; except that if the employee's average weekly wage is less  than
 twenty  dollars  the  benefit shall be such average weekly wage. For any
 period  of  disability less than a full week, the benefits payable shall
 be calculated by dividing the  weekly  benefit  by  the  number  of  the
 employee's normal work days per week and multiplying the quotient by the
 number  of  normal  work  days  in such period of disability. The weekly
 benefit for a disabled employee who is concurrently eligible  for  bene-
 fits  in  the employment of more than one covered employer shall, within
 the maximum and minimum herein provided, be one-half of the total of the
 employee's average weekly wages received from all such  covered  employ-
 ers,  and shall be allocated in the proportion of their respective aver-
 age weekly wage payments.
  § 8. Subdivision 2 of section 206 of the workers' compensation law, as
 amended by section 7 of part SS of chapter 54 of the laws  of  2016,  is
 amended to read as follows:

 section two hundred three or two hundred seven of this article is  disa-
 bled  and has claimed or subsequently claims workers' compensation bene-
 fits under this chapter or benefits under  the  volunteer  firefighters'
 benefit  law  or  the volunteer ambulance workers' benefit law, and such
 claim is controverted on the ground that the employee's  disability  was
 not  caused  by an accident that arose out of and in the course of [his]
 THEIR employment or by an occupational disease, or by an injury in  line
 of  duty  as  a volunteer firefighter or volunteer ambulance worker, the
 employee shall be entitled in the first  instance  to  receive  benefits
 under  this  article for [his or her] THEIR disability. If benefits have
 been paid under this article in respect to a disability alleged to  have
 arisen  out  of  and  in the course of the employment or by reason of an
 occupational disease, or in line of duty as a volunteer firefighter or a
 volunteer ambulance worker, the employer or carrier or the chair  making
 such  payment  may,  at  any  time before award of workers' compensation
 benefits, or volunteer firefighters'  benefits  or  volunteer  ambulance
 workers'  benefits,  is made, file with the board a claim for reimburse-
 ment out of the proceeds of such award to the employee  for  the  period
 for which disability benefits were paid to the employee under this arti-
 cle,  and  shall  have  a lien against the FULL award for reimbursement,
 notwithstanding the provisions of section thirty-three of  this  chapter
 or  section  twenty-three  of the volunteer firefighters' benefit law or
 section twenty-three of the volunteer  ambulance  workers'  benefit  law
 provided the insurance carrier liable for payment of the award receives,
 before  such  award  is made, a copy of the claim for reimbursement from
 the employer, carrier or chair who paid disability benefits, or provided
 the board's decision and award directs such reimbursement therefrom.

 compensation  law,  as amended by section 10 of part SS of chapter 54 of
 the laws of 2016, is amended to read as follows:

 ING THE DELAY SHALL BE THE SAME BENEFIT  LEVEL  THAT  WOULD  HAVE  TAKEN
 EFFECT BUT FOR THE DELAY.

 federal  old-age,  survivors and disability insurance program, an amount
 equal to the STANDARD MEDICARE premium  charge  for  such  supplementary
 medical  insurance  benefits for such active or retired employee and his

 retired  employees  of  the  state,  public  authorities, public benefit
 corporations or other quasi-public organizations of the state; provided,

  § 239-bb. County-wide shared  services  panels.  1.  Definitions.  The
 following  terms  shall  have the following meanings for the purposes of
 this article:
  a. "County" shall mean any county not wholly contained within a city.
  b. "County CEO" shall mean the county  executive,  county  manager  or
 other  chief  executive  of the county, or, where none, the chair of the
 county legislative body.
  c. "Panel" shall mean a county-wide shared services panel  established
 pursuant to subdivision two of this section.
  d.  "Plan"  shall  mean  a  county-wide  shared  services property tax
 savings plan.
  2. County-wide shared services panels. a. There [shall] MAY be a coun-
 ty-wide shared services panel in each county consisting  of  the  county
 CEO,  and  one  representative  from  each city, town and village in the
 county. The chief executive officer of each town, city and village shall
 be the representative to a panel and shall be the mayor, if a city or  a
 village,  or  shall  be  the supervisor, if a town. The county CEO shall
 serve as chair. [All panels established in each county pursuant to  part
 BBB  of  chapter  fifty-nine  of the laws of two thousand seventeen, and
 prior to the enactment of this article, shall continue  in  satisfaction
 of this section in such form as they were established, provided that the
 county  CEO  may alter the membership of the panel consistent with para-
 graph b of this subdivision.]
  b. The county CEO may invite any school district, board of cooperative
 educational  services,  fire  district,  fire  protection  district,  or
 special  improvement  district  in the county to join a panel. Upon such
 invitation, the governing body of such school district, board of cooper-
 ative educational services, fire district, fire protection district,  or
 other  special district may accept such invitation by selecting a repre-
 sentative of such governing body, by majority vote, to serve as a member
 of the panel. [Such school district, board  of  cooperative  educational
 services,  fire  district,  fire  protection  district  or other special
 district shall maintain  such  representation  until  the  panel  either
 S. 8305  63  A. 8805

 approves  a  plan  or transmits a statement to the secretary of state on
 the reason the panel did not approve a plan, pursuant to paragraph d  of
 subdivision  seven  of this section. Upon approval of a plan or a trans-
 mission  of  a  statement to the secretary of state that a panel did not
 approve a plan in any calendar year, the county CEO may, but  need  not,
 invite  any  school district, board of cooperative educational services,
 fire district, fire protection district or special improvement  district
 in the county to join a panel thereafter convened.]
  3.  [a.]  Each county CEO [shall, after satisfying the requirements of
 part BBB of chapter fifty-nine of the laws of  two  thousand  seventeen,
 annually]  MAY  convene  the  panel  and [shall] undertake to revise and
 update a previously approved plan or alternatively develop  a  new  plan
 [through  December  thirty-first,  two  thousand twenty-one]. Such plans
 shall contain new, recurring property tax savings resulting from actions
 such as, but not limited to, the elimination  of  duplicative  services;
 shared services arrangements including, joint purchasing, shared highway
 equipment, shared storage facilities, shared plowing services and energy
 and insurance purchasing cooperatives; reducing back office and adminis-
 trative  overhead;  and  better  coordinating services. The secretary of
 state may provide advice and/or recommendations on the form  and  struc-
 ture of such plans.
  [b.  After having convened at least two meetings in a calendar year, a
 panel may, by majority vote, determine that it is not in the best inter-
 est of the taxpayers to revise and update a previously approved plan  or
 to  develop  a new plan in such year. The county CEO of such panel shall
 then comply with the provisions of paragraph (d) of subdivision seven of
 this section.
  4. While revising or updating a previously  approved  plan,  or  while
 developing  a new plan, the county CEO shall regularly consult with, and
 take recommendations from, the representatives: on the  panel;  of  each
 collective  bargaining  unit  of  the  county and the cities, towns, and
 villages; and of each collective bargaining unit  of  any  participating
 school  district,  board  of  cooperative  educational  services,  fire
 district, fire protection district, or special improvement district.
  5. The county CEO, the county  legislative  body  and  a  panel  shall
 accept input from the public, civic, business, labor and community lead-
 ers  on  any proposed plan. The county CEO shall cause to be conducted a
 minimum of three public hearings prior to submission of a plan to a vote
 of a panel. All such public hearings shall be conducted within the coun-
 ty, and public notice of all such hearings shall be  provided  at  least
 one  week  prior  in the manner prescribed in subdivision one of section
 one hundred four of the public officers law. Civic, business, labor, and
 community leaders, as well as members of the public, shall be  permitted
 to provide public testimony at any such hearings.
  6.  a. The county CEO shall submit each plan, accompanied by a certif-
 ication as to the accuracy of the  savings  contained  therein,  to  the
 county  legislative body at least forty-five days prior to a vote by the
 panel.
  b. The county legislative body shall review  and  consider  each  plan
 submitted in accordance with paragraph a of this subdivision. A majority
 of  the  members of such body may issue an advisory report on each plan,
 making recommendations as deemed necessary. The county CEO may modify  a
 plan  based  on  such  recommendations,  which  shall include an updated
 certification as to the accuracy of the savings contained therein.
  7. a. A panel shall duly consider any plan properly submitted  to  the
 panel  by the county CEO and may approve such plan by a majority vote of
 S. 8305  64  A. 8805

 the panel. Each member of a panel may, prior  to  the  panel-wide  vote,
 cause  to  be removed from a plan any proposed action affecting the unit
 of government represented by the respective member.  Written  notice  of
 such  removal  shall be provided to the county CEO prior to a panel-wide
 vote on a plan.
  b. Plans approved by a panel shall be transmitted to the secretary  of
 state  no  later  than  thirty days from the date of approval by a panel
 accompanied by a certification as to the accuracy of the savings  accom-
 panied  therein,  and shall be publicly disseminated to residents of the
 county in a concise, clear, and coherent manner using words with  common
 and everyday meaning.
  c.  The county CEO shall conduct a public presentation of any approved
 plan no later than thirty days from the date of  approval  by  a  panel.
 Public  notice  of such presentation shall be provided at least one week
 prior in the manner prescribed in subdivision one of section one hundred
 four of the public officers law.
  d. Beginning in two thousand twenty, by  January  fifteenth  following
 any calendar year during which a panel did not approve a plan and trans-
 mit  such plan to the secretary of state pursuant to paragraph b of this
 subdivision, the county CEO of such panel shall release  to  the  public
 and  transmit  to  the secretary of state a statement explaining why the
 panel did not approve a plan that year, including, for each  vote  on  a
 plan,  the  vote  taken  by each panel member and an explanation by each
 panel member of their vote.
  8. For each county, new shared services actions  in  an  approved  and
 submitted  plan  pursuant  to this section or part BBB of chapter fifty-
 nine of the laws of two thousand seventeen, may be eligible for  funding
 to  match  savings from such action, subject to available appropriation.
 Savings that are actually and demonstrably realized by the participating
 local governments are eligible for matching funding.  For actions  that
 are  part  of  an approved plan transmitted to the secretary of state in
 accordance with paragraph  b  of  subdivision  seven  of  this  section,
 savings achieved during either: (i) January first through December thir-
 ty-first  from new actions implemented on or after January first through
 December thirty-first of the year immediately following an approved  and
 transmitted  plan,  or (ii) July first of the year immediately following
 an approved and transmitted plan through June thirtieth  of  the  subse-
 quent  year  from  new  actions implemented July first of the year imme-
 diately following an approved plan through June thirtieth of the  subse-
 quent  year  may  be  eligible  for matching funding.  Only net savings
 between local governments for each action would be eligible for matching
 funding. Savings from internal efficiencies or any other action taken by
 a local government without the participation of another local government
 are not eligible for matching funding. Each county and all of the  local
 governments  within  the county that are part of any action to be imple-
 mented as part of an approved  plan  must  collectively  apply  for  the
 matching  funding  and agree on the distribution and use of any matching
 funding in order to qualify for matching funding.
  9. The department of state shall prepare a report to the governor, the
 temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assembly on the
 county-wide shared services plans approved  by  the  county-wide  shared
 services  panels  created  pursuant to part BBB of chapter fifty-nine of
 the laws of two thousand seventeen and this article and shall  post  the
 report  on the department's website. Such report shall be provided on or
 before June thirtieth, two thousand twenty-five and shall  include,  but
 not be limited to, the following:

 districts in the county; and
  (6) the number of school districts, boards of cooperative  educational

 districts that participated in a panel, as reported in a plan.
  10. The secretary of state may solicit, and the panels may provide  at
 her  or  his  request,  advice  and  recommendations  concerning matters
 related to the operations  of  local  governments  and  shared  services
 initiatives,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  making recommendations
 regarding grant proposals incorporating  elements  of  shared  services,
 government dissolutions, government and service consolidations, or prop-
 erty  taxes and such other grants where the secretary deems the input of
 the panels to be in the best interest of the  public.  The  panel  shall
 advance  such advice or recommendations by a vote of the majority of the
 members present at such meeting.
  11. The authority granted by this article to a county CEO to convene a
 panel for the purpose of revising  or  updating  a  previously  approved
 plan,  or  developing  a  new plan, or to provide the secretary of state
 information pursuant to subdivision ten of this section, shall cease  on
 December thirty-first, two thousand twenty-four.
  12. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, monies
 constituting  the  funds  of the village incorporation commission estab-
 lished pursuant to section 2-259 of the village law shall  be  deposited
 with  the  state  comptroller  and  held for the purposes of the village
 incorporation commission established in article two of the village  law;
 provided,  however, that such monies shall be derived from the appropri-
 ation dedicated to the matching funds program  pursuant  to  subdivision
 eight  of  this section and provided further, that such funding for such
 entity shall not be subject to the requirements of subdivision eight  of
 this section related to savings.]

 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2024.

 the proceeds of which were paid to the state for all or a portion of the
 amounts  expended  by  the state from appropriations or reappropriations
 made  to  the  department  of  corrections  and  community  supervision;
 provided,  however,  that upon any such refunding or repayment the total
 aggregate principal amount of outstanding bonds, notes  or  other  obli-
 gations  may  be  greater  than  [nine  billion eight hundred sixty-five
 million eight hundred fifty-nine thousand  dollars  $9,865,859,000]  TEN

 debt service of the refunding or repayment bonds, notes or  other  obli-
 gations to be issued shall not exceed the present value of the aggregate
 debt  service of the bonds, notes or other obligations so to be refunded
 or repaid. For the purposes hereof, the present value of  the  aggregate
 debt  service  of the refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other obli-
 gations and of the aggregate debt service of the bonds, notes  or  other
 obligations  so refunded or repaid, shall be calculated by utilizing the
 effective interest rate of the refunding or repayment  bonds,  notes  or
 other  obligations,  which shall be that rate arrived at by doubling the
 semi-annual  interest  rate  (compounded  semi-annually)  necessary  to
 discount  the debt service payments on the refunding or repayment bonds,
 notes or other obligations from the payment dates thereof to the date of
 issue of the refunding or repayment bonds, notes  or  other  obligations
 and  to  the  price bid including estimated accrued interest or proceeds
 received by the corporation including estimated  accrued  interest  from
 the sale thereof.

 authorities law, as amended by section 31 of part PP of  chapter  56  of
 the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  (c) Subject to the provisions of chapter fifty-nine of the laws of two

 shall be excluded from such limitation if: (1) such bonds are issued  to
 refund  state  university  construction  bonds  and  state  university
 construction notes previously issued by the housing finance  agency;  or
 (2)  such  bonds  are  issued  to refund bonds of the authority or other

 March  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-three will generate long
 term economic benefits to the state, as  assessed  on  a  present  value
 basis,  such  issuance will be deemed to have met the present value test

 from  the  payment  dates  thereof to the date of issue of the refunding
 bonds to the purchase price of the refunding bonds,  including  interest
 accrued  thereon  prior  to  the  issuance thereof. The maturity of such

 or  for  the  benefit  of bondholders which might in any way affect such
 right.

 by  doubling  the  semi-annual  interest rate (compounded semi-annually)
 necessary to discount the debt service  payments  on  the  refunding  or
 repayment bonds, notes or other obligations from the payment dates ther-
