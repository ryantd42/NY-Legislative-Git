  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 6-12, 2024, as Physician Assistant  Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set aside to commend those individuals who  work
to serve the health care needs of citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim October 6-12, 2024, as
Physician Assistant Week in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with
the observance of National Physician Assistant Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  National  Physician  Assistant  (PA)  Week
recognizes the PA profession; it is an opportunity  to  raise  awareness
and visibility of the profession; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  the  week,  PAs  are  honored,  and  their role is
publicized as  a  critical  component  in  a  wide  variety  of  medical
settings; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are over 110,000 PAs practicing in the United States,
and  today,  about  one-third of them are in primary care and two-thirds
are in specialty care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Typically, PAs do  the  following  to  expand  the  medical
workforce  and enhance quality of care: take or review patients' medical
histories; examine patients; order and interpret diagnostic tests,  such
as  x-rays  or blood tests; diagnose a patient's injury or illness; give
treatment, for example setting broken  bones  and  immunizing  patients;
educate  and  counsel  patients  and their families; prescribe medicine;
assess and record a patient's progress; research the  latest  treatments
to  ensure  the  quality  of patient care; and conduct or participate in
outreach  programs,  talking  to  groups  about  managing  diseases  and
promoting wellness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Before it was a week-long event, National PA Day was first
celebrated on October 6, 1987, in honor of the 20th Anniversary  of  the
first  graduating  class  of  PAs  from  the Duke University PA program;
October 6th is also the birthday of the profession's founder, Eugene  A.
Stead, Jr., MD; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the sense of this Legislative Body to take note of
and  publicly  acknowledge  individuals  such  as  PAs  who  distinguish
themselves  through  their  exemplary  careers,  accomplishments,  and
purposeful lives of service to their  community  and  their  profession;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  October  6-12,  2024,  as
Physician Assistant Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
