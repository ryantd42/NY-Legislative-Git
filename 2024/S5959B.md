  § 6. Three years after the effective date of this act, the superinten-
 dent  of  financial  services,  in consultation with the commissioner of
 motor vehicles, shall study the impact of  this  act  to  determine  the
 efficacy  of  risk  retention groups not chartered in this state issuing
 vehicle insurance policies. Such study shall  examine  certain  factors,
 including,  but not limited to: the quality and practicability of cover-
 age on automotive accidents covered under such insurance  policies,  the
 magnitude  of  need  and  interest  in these types of insurance policies
 across the state, customer satisfaction and  fiscal  surety  using  such
 policies, the ability of the state to regulate such policies through the
 federal  limited  risk  retention  act, and other data as is practicable
 that would assess the potential  impact  on  nonprofits  that  could  be
 covered  by the expansion of eligibility of these policies for organiza-
 tions that are tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the federal  inter-
 nal  revenue code. Such superintendent shall report the findings and any
 recommendations of such study to the governor  and  the  legislature  no
 later than four years after the effective date of this act.
