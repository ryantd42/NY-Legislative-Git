  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. The opening paragraph and paragraphs (b) and (c) of subdi-
 vision 4 of section 3331 of the public health law, as added  by  chapter
 415 of the laws of 1981, are amended to read as follows:
  No such substance [may] SHALL be dispensed unless it is enclosed with-
 in a suitable and durable container, and:
  (b)  Such  container  shall be identified as a controlled substance by
 [either]:
  (i) an orange label;
  (ii) a label of another color over which  is  superimposed  an  orange
 transparent adhesive tape; or
  (iii) an auxiliary orange label affixed to the front of such container
 and  bearing  the  legend,  prominently  marked  or  printed "Controlled
 Substance, Dangerous Unless Used As Directed";
  (c) SUCH CONTAINER SHALL BE SEALED WITH A RED CAP TOP WITH THE PRINTED
 WORDS:  "CAUTION: OPIOID. RISK OF OVERDOSE AND ADDICTION", OR SUCH SIMI-
 LAR WORDING AS DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT. IF RED CAP TOPS
 ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE DUE TO PRODUCTION DELAYS, SUCH REQUIREMENT MAY
 BE SATISFIED BY PLACING RED STICKERS ON TOP OF EXISTING  CAPS,  PROVIDED
 THAT SUCH RED STICKERS COVER MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF SUCH CAP TOPS; AND
  (D)  Any label, transparency, or auxiliary label shall be applied in a
 manner which would inhibit its removal.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
