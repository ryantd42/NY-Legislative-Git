  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 4, 2024, as Obesity Awareness Day in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are set aside to increase awareness of issues that
affect the lives of the citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 4, 2024, as  Obesity
Awareness  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the
observance of World Obesity Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Obesity Day is observed globally on March 4th to lead
and drive global efforts to reduce, prevent and treat obesity,  as  well
as to promote practical solutions to end the global obesity crisis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital  initiative  is organized by the World Obesity
Federation, a non-profit body which is in official  relations  with  the
World  Health  Organization  and is the only global organization focused
exclusively on obesity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Obesity is a growing epidemic affecting about 40% of adults
in the United States, and is recognized as a  chronic  disease  by  many
leading  medical  professional  and patient organizations, including the
American  Medical  Association,  American  Heart  Association,  American
Academy  of  Family  Physicians,  American  Board  of  Obesity Medicine,
Endocrine Society, and the Obesity Society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Experts and researchers agree obesity is a complex  disease
influenced by various psychological, environmental, and genetic factors;
those  affected  by  the  disease  are at higher risk of developing many
health-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood  pressure,
cardiovascular disease, stroke, and some cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  a 2019 study, nearly 28% of New Yorkers are
obese, compared with the national average of 30.9%; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, total obesity-related costs in New York  State
are estimated at more than 11.8 billion dollars annually; and
 
  WHEREAS,  All types of citizens are affected by the disease, however
according to the National Center for Health Statistics,  obesity  has  a
disproportionate  impact among lower income individuals, those with less
education, and minority communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Studies show bias and stigma  against  people  affected  by
obesity,  both  societal  and  among  healthcare  professionals,  are
significant barriers to effectively treating the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prevention programs, comprehensive care and  treatment  are
essential  tools  in  mitigating  the  human  and economic costs of this
public health crisis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Research  suggests  weight  loss  of 5% to 10% can improve
health and reduce the risk of  some  obesity-related  diseases  and  can
thereby  advance  the goals of state public health initiatives to reduce
chronic disease, improve health outcomes, and control healthcare  costs;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 4, 2024, as  Obesity
Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
