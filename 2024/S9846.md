 telephone  company  as defined in paragraph (d) of subdivision twelve of
 this section, or owned by a telephone corporation as defined in subdivi-
 sion seventeen of section two of the public service law and certified by

 corporation  or  special  district, nor shall it include a crossing less
 than two hundred fifty feet in length of a public street, highway, water
 or other public place outside a city or village, unless such crossing be
 the continuation of an occupancy  of  another  public  street,  highway,
 water  or  other public place.  THE TERM "SPECIAL FRANCHISE" SHALL ALSO
 NOT INCLUDE ANY WATER SYSTEM PROPERTY OWNED  BY  A  PRIVATE  WATER-WORKS
 CORPORATION,  AS  SUCH  TERMS  ARE  DEFINED IN SECTION TWO OF THE PUBLIC
