  COMMEMORATING the 200th Anniversary of the Town of
  Fenner, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate the rich and  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities
which comprise this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  200th  Anniversary  of  the Town of Fenner, in Madison
County, New York, to be celebrated with a community-wide celebration  on
Saturday, August 12, 2023 at the Fenner Town Hall; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Organized  by  a  dedicated  planning  committee,  the
bicentennial  event  for  the  Town  of  Fenner  will  include  vendors,
immersive  activities  for  children,  and  a  hub  of  proactive  local
organizations and businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, A town rooted in its agriculture and  sense  of  community,
Fenner  was  made  the  homeland  of the Haudenosaunee, specifically the
Oneida Nation, hundreds of years ago; many settlers arrived  from  Rhode
Island,  and  the  name  Fenner  was  derived  from  former Rhode Island
Governor James Fenner; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hence the name of Mutton Hill Road within the Town,  Fenner
was  one  of  the  places  where  sheep farming became prevalent; later,
Fenner became home to many dairy farmers and many farms that still exist
today can be traced to the nineteenth century; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Fenner Baptist Church is a  prominent  feature  of  the
local  landscape  and  one  of  the  earliest  links  to  Fenner's
nineteenth-century heritage;  the  Church  was  added  to  the  National
Register  of Historic Places in 2002 and has served a valuable role as a
community meeting space for special events and ceremonies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the lowest point of 800 during the Great  Depression,
the  population  of  the Town of Fenner has seen a small, steady growth,
reaching over 1,600 in the 2020 census; and
 
  WHEREAS, The community has seen diverse changes with the development
of the windmills and modern farming, but it still remains a place  where
the community is strong and agriculture is valued; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Remaining  fruitful  over  the  ebb and flow of decades of
growth and change, the  Town  of  Fenner  continues  its  commitment  to
enhancing  the  quality  of  life  of  its citizens, ensuring a positive
business, institutional, and  educational  climate,  and  providing  all
essential services; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 200th Anniversary of  the  Town  of  Fenner,  New  York,
recognizing  the  significance  of  the role it continues to play in the
life of the communities of the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Bicentennial  Planning  Committee  and  the  Town  of
Fenner, New York.
