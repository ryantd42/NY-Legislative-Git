BY: M. of A. Zaccaro
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of  Tracey
  Towers
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  residential  housing,  as  it  is  the  foundation  of
communities for citizens to seek  comfort  in  and  safety,  while  also
building a neighborhood that welcomes diversity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Tracey Towers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Residing in the Norwood section of The Bronx, Tracey Towers
are  twin 400 feet residential towers that were built as a result of the
Mitchell-Lama program and opened in 1974; and
 
  WHEREAS, Among the tallest in the borough  with  871  units,  Tracey
Towers  was designed by the notable architect Paul Rudolph; he harnessed
a futuristic approach to the design, helping the towers  stand  out  not
just in height, but in design, from the square and rectangular buildings
of the area; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the  residents  of Tracey Towers represent African
American,  Ghanaian,  Caribbean,  Hispanic,  Nigerian,  and  Caucasian
cultures and continue to be a beacon of the neighborhood; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Tracey  Towers  Tenant Organization arranges multiple
events that benefit the community each year, including turkey giveaways,
school supply giveaways, movie nights, and health fairs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Access to quality housing is the foundation  for  achieving
better  educational,  employment, and health outcomes, as well as one of
the most important ways that families build wealth that  they  can  pass
along across the generations; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Tracey Towers; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Tracey Towers.
