 of  criminal justice services, as otherwise authorized by law, in making

 ing official shall not issue a license or shall revoke such license [and
 any  weapons  owned  or  possessed  by  such individual shall be removed

 of  this  article]. Local and state law enforcement shall have access to

 of state police the cost of which shall not be borne by any municipality

 as the point of contact to perform both  firearm  and  ammunition  back-
 ground  checks  under  federal  and  state  law.  Records  assembled  or
 collected for purposes of  inclusion  in  such  database  shall  not  be
 subject  to  disclosure  pursuant  to article six of the public officers
 law, EXCEPTING ANY  NON-IDENTIFYING RECORDS SUCH AS EXISTING STATISTICAL
 TABULATIONS OR THOSE CAPABLE OF BEING PERFORMED OR SUCH RECORD RESPONSES
 AS CAN BE REASONABLY SATISFIED THROUGH REDACTED  RESPONSE.  All  records
 containing  granted  license applications from all licensing authorities
 shall be monthly checked by the division of criminal justice services in
 conjunction  with  the  division  of  state  police  against  criminal
 conviction, criminal indictments, mental health, extreme risk protection
 orders,  orders of protection, and all other records as are necessary to
 determine their continued accuracy as well as whether an  individual  is
 no  longer  a  valid  license  holder.  The division of criminal justice
 services shall also check pending applications  made  pursuant  to  this
 article  against  such  records  to  determine  whether a license may be
 granted. All state and local agencies shall cooperate with the  division
 of  criminal justice services, as otherwise authorized by law, in making
