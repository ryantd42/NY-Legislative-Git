  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  July 11, 2024, as  Srebrenica  Genocide  Remembrance
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  This  resolution  arises from a sense of human decency and
respect for the Srebrenica people and their history; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 11, 2024, as Srebrenica Genocide
Remembrance Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fifty years after the  world  said  "Never  Again"  to  the
horrors of the Holocaust, genocide took place on European soil; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  name Srebrenica has become synonymous with those dark
days in July 1995 when, in the first ever United Nations  (UN)  declared
safe  area,  thousands  of men and boys were systematically murdered and
buried in mass graves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The victims, who were Muslim, were selected  for  death  on
the  basis  of  their  identity; this was the worst atrocity on European
soil since the Second World War; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the Srebrenica massacre,  more  than  7,000  Bosniak
(Bosnian  Muslim)  boys  and  men  were  slain by Bosnian Serb forces in
Srebrenica, a town in eastern Bosnia and  Herzegovina;  in  addition  to
these  killings,  more than 20,000 civilians were expelled from the area
in a process known as ethnic cleansing; and
 
  WHEREAS, The massacre helped galvanize  the  West  to  press  for  a
cease-fire  that  ended  three  years  of warfare on Bosnia's territory,
however, it left deep emotional scars on survivors and created  enduring
obstacles to political reconciliation among Bosnia's ethnic groups; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Beginning in 1992, Bosnian Serb forces targeted Srebrenica
in a campaign to seize control of a block of territory in eastern Bosnia
and Herzegovina; their eventual goal was to annex this territory to  the
adjacent  republic  of Serbia, and to do so, they believed, required the
expulsion  of  the  territory's  Bosniak  inhabitants,  who  opposed
annexation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  March  of  1995,  Radovan  Karadzic,  president of the
self-declared  autonomous  Republika  Srpska  (Bosnian  Serb  Republic),
directed his military forces to "create an unbearable situation of total
insecurity  with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants
of Srebrenica"; and
 
  WHEREAS, By May, a cordon of Bosnian Serb soldiers  had  imposed  an
embargo  on  food  and  other  supplies that provoked most of the town's
Bosniak fighters to flee the area; in late June, after  some  skirmishes
with  the  few  remaining  Bosniak  fighters,  the Bosnian Serb military
command formally ordered the  operation,  code-named  Krivaja  95,  that
culminated in the massacre; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The offensive commenced on July 6, 1995, with Bosnian Serb
forces advancing from the south and burning Bosniak homes along the way;
amid chaos and terror, thousands of civilians fled  Srebrenica  for  the
nearby  village  of  Potocari,  where  a  contingent  of about 200 Dutch
peacekeepers was stationed; some of the Dutch surrendered, while  others
withdrew; none fired on the advancing Bosnian Serb forces; and
 
  WHEREAS, On July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic
strolled  through  Srebrenica  and, in a statement recorded on film by a
Serb journalist, said, "We give this town to the  Serb  nationàThe  time
has come to take revenge on the Muslims"; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the night of July 11, 1995, a column of more than 10,000
Bosniak  men  set off from Srebrenica through dense forest in an attempt
to reach safety; beginning the following morning, Bosnian Serb  officers
used  UN  equipment and made false promises of security to encourage the
men to surrender; thousands gave themselves up  or  were  captured,  and
many were subsequently executed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Other Bosniaks were forced out of Potocari that day through
the  use  of terror; the women, children, and elderly were placed aboard
buses and driven to Bosniak-held territory, while the men and boys  were
taken to various holding sites, mostly in Bratunac; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  total number of men and boys who were slaughtered was
initially a matter of some debate; under heavy  international  pressure,
the government of the Republika Srpska issued an apology in 2004 for the
"enormous crimes" in Srebrenica and acknowledged that an estimated 7,800
had perished; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  process  of  locating  the graves and identifying the
victims was complicated by a well-organized effort undertaken by Bosnian
Serb forces in  September  and  October  1995  to  hide  traces  of  the
Srebrenica  crimes;  soldiers used heavy tractors and backhoes to dig up
mass graves and moved the disinterred remains to distant sites, many  of
which  were  later  located by U.S. intelligence experts using satellite
photographs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, it  required  years  of  analysis  by  Western
scientists to piece together exactly where the killings had occurred and
how the bodies had been moved among an estimated 80 mass grave sites; by
early  2010,  the  International  Commission  on  Missing  Persons,  a
nongovernmental organization established in 1996, had used  DNA  samples
to identify more than 6,400 individual victims; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  consistently remembering and forcefully condemning the
atrocities committed against these people, and honoring the survivors as
well as other victims of  similar  heinous  conduct,  we  guard  against
repetition of such acts of genocide and provide the American public with
a greater understanding of history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  resolution  declares  that  this  Legislative  Body
deplores the persistent, ongoing efforts by any person, in this  country
or  abroad,  to deny the historical fact of the Srebrenica Genocide; the
failure of the  international  community  to  hold  responsible  nations
accountable  for crimes against humanity results in travesty of justice,
and sets a negative precedent; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The State of New York endeavors to encourage and promote a
curriculum relating to human rights and genocide  in  order  to  empower
future  generations  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of  genocide;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  July  11,  2024,  as
Srebrenica Genocide Remembrance Day in the State of New York; and be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
