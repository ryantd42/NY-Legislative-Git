2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Lymphedema  Day  brings  awareness  to  this
often-debilitating disease that millions are born with, but  which  many

collective  celebration  and  is  also  set aside to honor inspirational
lymphedema patients and advocates; and

result of cancer treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS, Andrea Weinreb, along with her husband Bruce,  began  their
awareness  and  fundraising  efforts  in  2009,  when  they  joined  the
Lymphatic Education and Research  Network  (LE&RN),  a  New  York  based
not-for-profit  organization  celebrating  its 25th anniversary in 2023;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2010 they participated in the inaugural NY  Run/Walk  to
Fight  Lymphedema  &  Lymphatic Diseases. Andrea has consistently been a

  WHEREAS,  Andrea Weinreb and her husband lobbied in Washington, D.C.
and New York State on behalf of all New Yorkers  living  with  lymphatic
disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Andrea  Weinreb  gave  the  keynote address at the 2018 NY
Run/Walk to Fight Lymphedema and Lymphatic Diseases; and
 
  WHEREAS, Andrea Weinreb has worked tirelessly to promote  lymphedema
and lymphatic disease education, research and advocacy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Andrea  Weinreb  continues to be a positive role model for
all lymphedema and lymphatic disease patients; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown  a
long  and  sustained  commitment to excellence certainly have earned the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
