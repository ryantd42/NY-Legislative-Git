  HONORING  Chuck  Miller  upon  the occasion of his
  designation for special recognition by the New  York
  State Office for the Aging on May 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Chuck Miller
upon the occasion of his designation for special recognition by the  New
York  State  Office  for  the Aging at its Annual Older New Yorker's Day
Celebration on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at the Hart Theatre Lounge in  The
Egg, Albany, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each May, the New York State Office for the Aging pauses to
acknowledge  the outstanding contributions made by older citizens during
National Older Americans Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of older generations have helped  build  and  shape
our  Nation  to  be  the  greatest  in the world; they have defended our
freedoms and values to ensure that those who come after  them  may  have
better  lives; nowhere in the Nation is the legacy of their efforts more
visible and more a part of the lives of all citizens than  here  in  the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chuck Miller's dedication to volunteerism reflects his deep
compassion  and  commitment  to serving others; from delivering meals to
supporting medical transportation services, his impact on his  community
is truly invaluable; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originally from Latham, New York, Chuck Miller's career in
sales and management prepared him for a life of service  in  retirement;
his passion for helping others shines through his volunteer work, making
a meaningful difference in the lives of many; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  his  spare  time, Chuck Miller has restored an old hay
wagon on his property to give hayrides to  friends,  family,  neighbors,
and  even  older  adults  from  the  senior  center  during the fall; he
continues to positively impact his community through  his  kindness  and
generosity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown by an
individual for the benefit of others which Chuck  Miller  has  displayed
throughout his life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chuck  Miller,  a  very  active  and  industrious man, has
inspired  and  enriched  the  lives  of  those  he  serves  through  his
volunteerism,  generously  sharing  the  wisdom  gained  over  years  of
experiencing life to its fullest; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Chuck  Miller  upon  the  occasion of his designation for special
 
recognition by the New York State Office for the Aging on May 14,  2024;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Chuck Miller.
