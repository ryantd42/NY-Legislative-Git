 CONDOMINIUM.  RESIDENCE  INCLUDES  A TRAILER OR MOBILE HOME, USED EXCLU-
 SIVELY FOR RESIDENTIAL PURPOSES AND DEFINED AS REAL PROPERTY PURSUANT TO
 PARAGRAPH (G) OF SUBDIVISION TWELVE OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED  TWO  OF  THE
 REAL PROPERTY TAX LAW.
  (D)  "QUALIFYING  REAL  PROPERTY TAXES" MEANS ALL REAL PROPERTY TAXES,
 SPECIAL AD VALOREM LEVIES AND SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS, EXCLUSIVE  OF  PENAL-
 TIES  AND  INTEREST,  LEVIED  BY  A TAXING JURISDICTION ON THE RESIDENCE
 OWNED AND OCCUPIED BY A QUALIFIED TAXPAYER AND  PAID  BY  THE  QUALIFIED
 TAXPAYER  DURING THE TAXABLE YEAR, PROVIDED THAT TO THE EXTENT THE TOTAL
 AMOUNT OF REAL PROPERTY TAXES SO PAID INCLUDES  SCHOOL  DISTRICT  TAXES,
 THE  AMOUNT  OF  THE SCHOOL TAX RELIEF (STAR) CREDIT CLAIMED PURSUANT TO
 SUBSECTION (EEE) OF THIS SECTION, IF ANY, SHALL BE  DEDUCTED  FROM  SUCH
 AMOUNT.
  A  QUALIFIED  TAXPAYER MAY ELECT TO INCLUDE ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNT THAT

 TO  THE  TAXPAYER DURING THE PERIODS SUCH TAXPAYER OCCUPIED EACH OF SUCH
 RESIDENCES. A TAXPAYER WHO OWNED AND OCCUPIED A RESIDENCE IN  THE  STATE
 FOR  PART  OF  THE  TAXABLE YEAR AND RENTED A RESIDENCE IN THE STATE FOR
 PART OF THE SAME TAXABLE YEAR, MAY INCLUDE THE PRORATION  OF  QUALIFYING
 REAL  PROPERTY  TAXES  ON  THE  RESIDENCE  OWNED. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, FOR
 PURPOSES OF THE CREDIT ALLOWED UNDER THIS  SUBSECTION,  QUALIFYING  REAL
 PROPERTY  TAXES  MAY  BE  INCLUDED  BY  A QUALIFIED TAXPAYER ONLY TO THE
 EXTENT THAT SUCH TAXPAYER OR THE SPOUSE OF SUCH TAXPAYER  OCCUPIED  SUCH
 RESIDENCE FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-THREE DAYS OR MORE OF THE TAXABLE YEAR,
 OWNED THE RESIDENCE AND PAID SUCH TAXES.
  (2)  THE CREDIT AMOUNT ALLOWED UNDER THIS SUBSECTION SHALL EQUAL FIFTY
 PERCENT OF QUALIFYING REAL PROPERTY  TAXES  PAID;  HOWEVER  THIS  AMOUNT
 SHALL NOT EXCEED SIXTY-FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.
  (3) NO CREDIT SHALL BE GRANTED UNDER THIS SUBSECTION:

  (4) IN THE CASE OF A TAXPAYER WHO HAS ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS FROM FEDERAL
 ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME, AND WHOSE FEDERAL ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS INCLUDE  AN
 AMOUNT  FOR  REAL  ESTATE  TAXES  PAID,  THE NEW YORK ITEMIZED DEDUCTION
