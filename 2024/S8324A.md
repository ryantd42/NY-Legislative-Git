 AN ACT in relation to authorizing Calvary Tabernacle Church  of  God  to
  file an application for exemption from real property taxes for certain
  assessment rolls
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Islip, county of Suffolk, is hereby  author-
 ized  to  accept from Calvary Tabernacle Church of God, a not-for-profit
 organization, an application for  exemption  from  real  property  taxes
 pursuant  to  section 420-a of the real property tax law with respect to
 the 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 assessment rolls, for the parcels
 owned by such organization which are located at 6  Holbrook  Street,  in
 the  hamlet  of  Bay  Shore, town of Islip, county of Suffolk, otherwise
 known as section 315.00, block 01.00, lot 070.000.
  If accepted, such application shall be reviewed  as  if  it  had  been
 received  on  or  before  the  taxable  status date established for such
 rolls. If satisfied that such non-profit organization would otherwise be
 entitled to such exemption if such organization had filed an application
 for exemption by the appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval by the town of Islip town board, may grant exemption  from  all
 taxation  and make appropriate corrections to the subject rolls. If such
 exemption is granted and such organization therefore shall have paid any
 tax with respect to the subject rolls, the applicable governing body  or
 tax  department  may,  in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of
 the taxes paid, along with any fines or penalties paid, and  cancel  any
 taxes, fines, penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
