 tive factor pursuant to this paragraph, the authorized entity must spec-
 ify  that  businesses  certified  as  minority-  or women-owned business

 to qualify for such factor.
  Each  basis  under  this subdivision shall reflect, wherever possible,
 objective and quantifiable analysis.

  §  3.  Any contract for a public work undertaken pursuant to a project
 labor agreement in accordance with section 222 of the labor law may be a
 design-build contract in accordance with this act.
  § 4. Notwithstanding any general, special or local law, rule or  regu-
 lation to the contrary, including but not limited to section 7210 of the
 education law, article 5-A of the general municipal law and article 8 of
 the  public housing law, and in conformity with the requirements of this
 act, for any public work that has an estimated cost  of  not  less  than
 $10,000,000  and  is undertaken pursuant to a project labor agreement in
 accordance with section 222 of  the  labor  law,  an  authorized  entity
 charged with awarding a contract for public work may use the alternative
 delivery method referred to as design-build contracts; provided that any
 authorized entity may use the alternative delivery method referred to as
 design-build contracts for any public work that has an estimated cost of
 not  less than $1,200,000 if such public work is otherwise in conformity
 with the requirements of this act and primarily consists of:  pedestrian
 ramps  and  similar  infrastructure  to  improve access to sidewalks for
 people with disabilities; renovation and construction of cultural insti-
 tutions located on publicly owned real property and of public libraries;
 or security infrastructure, including bollards, planters and other phys-
 ical structures, designed to protect life  and  property  from  acts  of
 terror or mass violence.
  (a) A contractor selected by such an authorized entity to enter into a
 design-build  contract  shall  be selected through a two-step method, as
 follows:
 A. 9503--A  3
 
  (1) Step one. Generation of a list of responding  entities  that  have
 demonstrated  the  general  capability  to  perform  the  design-build
 contract.  Such list shall consist of a specified number  of  responding
 entities,  as determined by an authorized entity, and shall be generated
 based  upon  the  authorized  entity's review of responses to a publicly
 advertised request for qualifications. The authorized  entity's  request
 for  qualifications  shall  include  a general description of the public
 work, the maximum number of responding entities to be  included  on  the
 list,  the selection criteria to be used and the relative weight of each
 criteria in generating the list. Such selection criteria  shall  include
 the  qualifications  and experience of the design and construction team,
 organization, demonstrated responsibility, ability of the team or  of  a
 member  or  members  of the team to comply with applicable requirements,
 including the provisions of articles 145, 147 and 148 of  the  education
 law, past record of compliance with the labor law, and such other quali-
 fications the authorized entity deems appropriate, which may include but
 are  not  limited  to  project  understanding,  financial capability and
 record of past performance. The authorized  entity  shall  evaluate  and
 rate  all  responding  entities to the request for qualifications. Based
 upon such ratings, the authorized entity shall list the responding enti-
 ties that shall receive a request for proposals in accordance with para-
 graph 2 of this subdivision. To the extent  consistent  with  applicable
 federal  law,  the  authorized  entity shall consider, when awarding any
 contract pursuant to this section, the participation of responding enti-
 ties that are certified as minority- or women-owned business enterprises
 pursuant to article 15-A of the executive law.
  (2) Step two. Selection of the proposal which is the best value to the
 authorized entity. The authorized  entity  shall  issue  a  request  for
 proposals  to  the responding entities listed pursuant to paragraph 1 of
 this subdivision. If such a responding entity  consists  of  a  team  of
 separate  entities,  the  entities that comprise such a team must remain
 unchanged from the responding entity as listed pursuant to  paragraph  1
 of  this subdivision unless otherwise approved by the authorized entity.
 The request for proposals shall set forth the  public  work's  scope  of
 work,  and  other  requirements, as determined by the authorized entity,
 which may include separate goals for  work  under  the  contract  to  be
 performed  by  businesses certified as minority- or women-owned business
 enterprises pursuant to article 15-A of the executive law.  The  request
 for proposals shall also specify the criteria to be used to evaluate the
 responses  and the relative weight of each of such criteria. Such crite-
 ria shall include the proposal's cost, the  quality  of  the  proposal's
 solution,  the  qualifications and experience of the proposer, and other
 factors deemed pertinent by the authorized entity,  which  may  include,
 but  shall  not  be  limited  to,  the proposal's manner and schedule of
 project implementation, the proposer's ability to complete the work in a
 timely and satisfactory  manner,  maintenance  costs  of  the  completed
 public  work, maintenance of traffic approach, and community impact. Any
 contract awarded pursuant to this act shall be awarded to  a  responsive
 and  responsible  proposer,  which,  in consideration of these and other
 specified criteria deemed pertinent, offers the best  value,  as  deter-
 mined by the authorized entity.  The request for proposals shall include
 a  statement that proposers shall designate in writing those portions of
 the proposal that contain trade secrets or other proprietary information
 that are to remain confidential; that the material designated as  confi-
 dential  shall  be  readily separable from the proposal. Nothing in this
 subdivision shall be construed to prohibit the  authorized  entity  from
 A. 9503--A  4
 
 negotiating  final  contract  terms  and  conditions including cost. All
 proposals submitted shall be scored according to the criteria listed  in
 the request for proposals.
  (b)  An  authorized  entity  awarding  a  design-build  contract  to a
 contractor offering the best value may but shall not be required to  use
 the following types of contracts:
  (1)  A  cost-plus  not  to  exceed  guaranteed  maximum  price form of
 contract in which the authorized entity shall be entitled to monitor and
 audit all costs. In establishing the schedule and process for  determin-
 ing  a  guaranteed  maximum  price,  the contract between the authorized
 entity and the contractor shall:
  (i) Describe the scope of the work and the  cost  of  performing  such
 work,
  (ii) Include a detailed line item cost breakdown,
  (iii)  Include a list of all drawings, specifications and other infor-
 mation on which the guaranteed maximum price is based,
  (iv) Include the dates of substantial and final  completion  on  which
 the guaranteed maximum price is based, and
  (v) Include a schedule of unit prices; or
  (2) A lump sum contract in which the contractor agrees to accept a set
 dollar  amount  for  a  contract  which  comprises  a single bid without
 providing a cost breakdown for all costs such as for  equipment,  labor,
 materials,  as well as such contractor's profit for completing all items
 of work comprising the public work.
  § 5. Any contract entered into pursuant to this act  shall  include  a
 clause  requiring  that  any professional services regulated by articles
 145, 147 and 148 of the education law shall be performed and stamped and
 sealed, where appropriate, by a professional licensed in accordance with
 the appropriate article.
  § 6. Construction with respect to each contract  entered  into  by  an
 authorized  entity  pursuant to this act shall be deemed a "public work"
 to be performed in accordance with the provisions of article  8  of  the
 labor  law, as well as subject to sections 200, 240, 241 and 242 of such
 law and enforcement of prevailing wage requirements pursuant to applica-
 ble law or, for projects or public works receiving federal aid, applica-
 ble federal requirements for prevailing wage. Any contract entered  into
 pursuant  to  this  act  shall  include  a clause requiring the selected
 design builder to obligate every  tier  of  contractor  working  on  the
 public  work  to  comply  with the project labor agreement referenced in
 section three of this act, and shall  include  project  labor  agreement
 compliance  monitoring  and  enforcement  provisions consistent with the
 applicable project labor agreement.
  § 7. Each contract entered into by an authorized  entity  pursuant  to
 this  act  shall  comply  with  the objectives and goals relating to the
 performance of design and construction services by minority- and  women-
 owned  business  enterprises, or, for projects or public works receiving
 federal aid, applicable federal requirements for disadvantaged  business
 enterprises or minority- and women-owned business enterprises.
  §  8. Public works undertaken by an authorized entity pursuant to this
 act shall be subject to the requirements of article 8  of  the  environ-
 mental  conservation law, and, where applicable, the requirements of the
 National Environmental Policy Act.
  § 9. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of law  to  the  contrary,  all
 rights  or  benefits,  including terms and conditions of employment, and
 protection of civil service and  collective  bargaining  status  of  all
 employees  of  authorized entities solely in connection with public work
 A. 9503--A  5
 
 undertaken by an authorized  entity  pursuant  to  this  act,  shall  be
 preserved and protected.
  (b)  Nothing  in this act shall result in the: (1) displacement of any
 currently  employed  worker  or  loss  of  position,  including  partial
 displacement  such  as  a  reduction  in the hours of non-overtime work,
 wages or employment benefits, or result in the  impairment  of  existing
 collective  bargaining  agreements;  and (2) transfer of existing duties
 and functions related to maintenance and operations currently  performed
 by existing employees of authorized entities to a contractor.
  (c)  Employees  of  authorized  entities  using design-build contracts
 serving in positions in newly created titles shall be  assigned  to  the
 appropriate  bargaining  unit.  Nothing  contained  in this act shall be
 construed to affect (1) the existing rights of employees of  such  enti-
 ties  pursuant  to  an existing collective bargaining agreement, (2) the
 existing representational  relationships  among  employee  organizations
 representing employees of such entities, or (3) the bargaining relation-
 ships between such entities and such employee organizations.
  (d)  Without  limiting  contractors'  obligations  under  design-build
 contracts to issue  their  own  initial  certifications  of  substantial
 completion and final completion, public employees of authorized entities
 shall  review and determine whether the work performed by contractors is
 acceptable and has been performed  in  accordance  with  the  applicable
 design-build  contracts, and if such public employees so determine, such
 public  employees  shall  accept  contractors'  substantial  or  final
 completion  of the public works as applicable. Performance by authorized
 entities of any review  described  in  this  subdivision  shall  not  be
 construed  to  modify  or  limit contractors' obligations to perform the
 work in strict accordance with the applicable design-build contracts  or
 the contractors' or any subcontractors' obligations or liabilities under
 any law.
  §  10. The submission of a proposal or responses or the execution of a
 design-build contract pursuant to this act shall not be construed to  be
 a violation of section 6512 of the education law.
  §  11.  Nothing  contained  in this act shall limit the right or obli-
 gation of any authorized entity to comply with  the  provisions  of  any
 existing contract or to award contracts as otherwise provided by law.
  §  12.  A  report  shall  be submitted no later than June 30, 2025 and
 annually thereafter, to the county executive and the chair of the  board
 of legislators for an authorized entity containing information regarding
 each  design-build  contract procured by such authorized entity pursuant
 to this act. Such report  shall  include  a  description  of  each  such
 design-build contract, information regarding the procurement process for
 each  such  design-build contract including the list of responding enti-
 ties that demonstrated the general capability  to  perform  the  design-
 build  contract  pursuant  to  paragraph 1 of subdivision (a) of section
 four of this act, the total  cost  of  each  design-build  contract,  an
 explanation  of  the  estimated  savings resulting from the design-build
 method, and the participation rate of and total dollar value  of  monies
 paid  to  minority-  and  women-owned  business  enterprises  under such
 design-build contract.
  § 13. This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire  and  be
 deemed  repealed  3  years  after such date, provided that, public works
 with requests for qualifications issued prior to such  repeal  shall  be
 permitted to continue under this act notwithstanding such repeal.
