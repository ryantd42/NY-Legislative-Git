  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that

purpose is dedicated to serving the  community  and  the  needs  of  its
citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its

city of Chicago, Illinois, where he served as the  city's  first  mayor;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  William  B.  Ogden  had  organized  to  grant money to his
hometown upon the occasion of his death; a trustee of  the  inheritance,
William  Wheeler, traveled to Walton to make an informed decision on the
best way to utilize these funds, and the community  suggested  that  the
inheritance be used to build a library; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  library  had  begun  construction  in  1896,  and was
completed in the following year, 1897;  it  was  designed  by  the  firm
Morris and Walker of New York City, and was built by Alexander Carman of
Binghamton  out  of  native bluestone from the quarries on Marvin Hollow
and on Shepard Hill; the library officially opened its doors on  January
29, 1899; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  William  B. Ogden Free Library has been an invaluable
resource for residents of Walton for  125  years;  people  come  to  the
library  to connect, discover, study, participate in story times, attend
book groups, and participate in various programs for all ages; and
 
  WHEREAS, The mission of the William B.  Ogden  Free  Library  is  to
enrich  the literary and cultural lives of its community members, and to
preserve the integrity of the historic structure of the library; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the William B.  Ogden  Free  Library  is  in
direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of  the many individuals who have
supported the development of the library over the years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud and distinguished history,  the  William
B.  Ogden Free Library may take just pride in its purposeful growth, as
it looks forward to continuing to serve the educational,  cultural,  and
intellectual needs of the community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 125th Anniversary of the William B. Ogden Free  Library;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
