  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of  Meyda
  Lighting
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing the economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary of Meyda Lighting, of Yorkville, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  Utica,  New  York,  in  1974,  Meyer  and  Ida  Cohen
established Meyda Lighting, crafting stained glass windows, an idea that
was  inspired by Ida's request for her husband to construct one to block
the view of  their  neighbor's  vintage  cars;  the  request  came  into
fruition  due to the talent of the master craftsman and inventor coupled
with the business sense of a natural businesswoman; and
 
  WHEREAS, Meyda, the combination  of  both  spouses'  names,  quickly
changed  and  expanded  through  the  decades;  only  one year after its
inception, Meyda Lighting opened its  first  retail  outlet  and  summer
studio on the porch of the Cohens' home in Old Forge; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1976, operations were expanded by converting a one-stall
garage  into  a storefront, serving as a winter studio; after relocating
the business to the downtown district  of  Utica  in  1979,  the  Cohens
manufactured stained glass lamps, windows, and dÚcor; and
 
  WHEREAS, By the 1980s, Meyer and Ida Cohen's son, Robert, joined the
business  which  commenced  the  production  and  distribution  of
Tiffany-style lamps and lighting fixtures; by 1985, the company required
a larger facility; and
 
  WHEREAS, Expanding  again  in  1992,  Meyda  Lighting  acquired  the
Quality Bent Glass Company, and two years later, Meyda Tiffany relocated
its  national  headquarters  and  manufacturing facilities to Yorkville,
tripling in size to more than 60,000 square feet; and
 
  WHEREAS, By the end of the 1990s, Meyda Lighting  acquired  a  metal
art  fabricator  based  in  Utica, launching two new collections; at the
beginning of the new millennium, the Fused Glass Collection was added to
the company's growing array of creations; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2008,  Meyda  Custom  Lighting  was  launched,  and  the
world's  largest  freestanding  LED  chandelier  was constructed for the
Stanley Theatre in Utica; the following year, the metal lighting program
was expanded with the acquisition  of  2nd  Ave  Lighting,  focusing  on
bespoke lighting for commercial and residential projects; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  its humble beginning until today, Meyda Lighting has
drastically  expanded  and  changed;  however,  its  commitment  to  the
 
community  has always been part of the company's success; this lucrative
business has been quite benevolent to State  University  of  New  York's
Polytechnic students, providing its facilities for their use; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the past decade, Meyda Lighting has contributed more
than $1 million to local and  national  charities  to  support  numerous
causes, including healthcare, education, and social welfare; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is with great pride that Meyer and Ida Cohen, along with
their  dedicated  workers, celebrate this milestone 50th Anniversary and
anticipate many more years of success for generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS, The progression of Meyda Lighting is in direct  correlation
to  the  efforts  of its owners and employees, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the business and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business, its contributions to  the  local
and  State  economies,  and its vibrant role in improving the quality of
life in its community, fully confident that it will  continue  to  enjoy
the sparkling success it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Meyda Lighting; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Meyda Lighting.
