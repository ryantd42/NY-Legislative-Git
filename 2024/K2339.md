  WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding members of our community who,

beyond his wife's passing; and

fellow  veterans,  Theodore Cohen delivered food to homebound servicemen

  WHEREAS, Furthermore, his love for others extended to young  adults,
as seen by his assistance in reviews and recommendations for high school
students to Service Academies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Residents of this great State must never forget the courage
with  which these men and women served their country, and must recognize
that no greater debt is owed than that owed to those  who  risked  their
lives for their beloved Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having  exhibited  his patriotism both at home and abroad,
Theodore  Cohen  demonstrated  his  love  for  his  country  and  merits
forevermore the highest respect of his State and Nation; and
