  COMMEMORATING the 100th Anniversary of the Amherst
  Police Department
 
  WHEREAS, The quality of life in New York State is largely reflective
of the commitment and dedication demonstrated by members of the agencies
which serve to protect, preserve and maintain public order; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
honor those distinguished citizens who  devote  their  life's  work  and
purpose  to  public service, contributing to the care and welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Amherst Police Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, This momentous occasion will be celebrated at a  number  of
community  events  throughout  the  year, including the burial of a time
capsule in late July; the  capsule  will  include  a  copy  of  The  Bee
newspaper, 100th anniversary badges and patches, and letters from Police
Chief Scott P. Chamberlin and Amherst Town Supervisor Brian Kulpa; and
 
  WHEREAS,  100th  Anniversary  Challenge  Coins  were  also  made and
presented to the officers of the Amherst Police Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1923, the Amherst Police  Department  has  grown
and  evolved over the last 100 years to become one of the largest police
departments in Erie County; today,  under  the  superior  leadership  of
Chief  Scott P. Chamberlin, the Department is comprised of approximately
154 sworn officers and supported by  35  full-  and  part-time  civilian
employees  who provide services to the 117,000 residents of Amherst, the
largest suburb of Buffalo, and for the people who live in the Village of
Williamsville; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1979, the current police headquarters was opened on John
James Audubon Parkway; it came with an advanced lab, allowing  for  many
in-house applications; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  the last 100 years, three officers have given the
ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, and each year, they are  honored
on the date of their anniversary; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  and  every  officer and staff member is committed to
ensuring every citizen with whom they interact is treated with  dignity,
compassion  and respect; the safety and well-being of the members of the
community is truly their number one concern as they continue to  protect
the  constitutional  freedoms  of  all and fairly enforce local laws and
ordinances and the laws of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, By working together with the community, the Amherst  Police
Department  diligently  works  to  solve  problems,  maintain the peace,
provide safety and security for citizens and reduce the fear  of  crime;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  the  Amherst Police Department has
demonstrated continuous service to the residents and  communities  which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  tradition  of  altruistic public service, heroism and
leadership  embodied  by  the  Amherst  Police  Department  is  of  such
magnitude  as  to  be  worthy  of  special,  statewide recognition; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 100th Anniversary of the Amherst Police Department; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Chief Scott P. Chamberlin, Amherst Police Department.
