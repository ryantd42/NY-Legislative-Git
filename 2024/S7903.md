 summons  would  cause  undue  hardship  or  extreme inconvenience to the
 applicant, a person under his or her care or supervision, or the public.
 Except as provided in paragraph two of subdivision (a) of this  section,
 in  determining whether an application for postponement should be grant-
 ed, the commissioner or the court shall be guided by  standards  promul-
