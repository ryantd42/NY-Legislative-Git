  Section  1.  The opening paragraph of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph a
 of subdivision 1 of section 191 of the labor law, as amended by  chapter
 168 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  The  commissioner  may  authorize  an employer [which has in the three
 years preceding the application employed an average of one  thousand  or
 more persons in this state or has for one year preceding the application
 employed  an  average  of one thousand or more persons in this state and
 has for three years preceding the application  employed  an  average  of
 three thousand or more persons outside the state] to pay less frequently
 than  weekly  but  not less frequently than semi-monthly if the employer
 furnishes satisfactory proof to the commissioner of its continuing abil-

 the commissioner shall consider the following:
  §  2.  Subdivision  1-a of section 198 of the labor law, as amended by
 chapter 362 of the laws of 2015, is amended to read as follows:
  1-a. A. On behalf of any employee paid less than the wage to which  he
 or she is entitled under the provisions of this article, the commission-
 er  may  bring  any  legal  action  necessary,  including administrative
 action, to collect such claim and as part of such legal action, in addi-
 tion to any other remedies and penalties otherwise available under  this
 article,  the  commissioner  shall  assess against the employer the full
 amount of any such underpayment, and an additional amount as  liquidated
 damages,  unless  the  employer  proves a good faith basis for believing
 that its underpayment of wages was in compliance with  the  law.  Liqui-
 dated  damages  shall  be calculated by the commissioner as no more than
 one hundred percent of the total amount of wages found to be due, except
 such liquidated damages may be up to three hundred percent of the  total
 amount  of  the wages found to be due for a willful violation of section
