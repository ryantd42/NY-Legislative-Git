  Rights and Obligations
 YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO LEAVE YOUR HOME AT THIS TIME. You have the right
 to  stay  in  your  home  during  the  foreclosure  process. You are not
 required to leave your home unless and until your property  is  sold  at
 auction pursuant to a judgment of foreclosure and sale.
 Regardless  of  whether  you  choose  to  remain  in  your home, YOU ARE
 REQUIRED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR PROPERTY and pay property taxes in accord-
 ance with state and local law.
 Foreclosure rescue scams
  Be careful of people who approach you with offers to "save" your home.
 There are individuals who watch for notices of  foreclosure  actions  in
 order  to  unfairly  profit  from  a homeowner's distress. You should be
 extremely careful about any such promises and any suggestions  that  you
 pay  them a fee or sign over your deed. State law requires anyone offer-
 ing such services for profit  to  enter  into  a  contract  which  fully
 describes  the services they will perform and fees they will charge, and
 which prohibits them from taking any money  from  you  until  they  have
 completed all such promised services.
  § 3. The article heading of article 18-B of the county law, as amended
 by chapter 682 of the laws of 1977, is amended to read as follows:
  REPRESENTATION OF PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME OR PARTIES BEFORE THE
  FAMILY COURT OR SURROGATE'S COURT OR IN CERTAIN FORECLOSURE
  ACTIONS
  §  4.  The  opening  paragraph  of  section  722 of the county law, as
 amended by chapter 7 of the laws of 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  The governing body of each county and the governing body of  the  city
 in  which a county is wholly contained shall place in operation through-
 out the county a plan for providing counsel to persons  charged  with  a
 crime  or  who  are  entitled to counsel pursuant to section two hundred
 sixty-two or section eleven hundred twenty  of  the  family  court  act,
 article  six-C  of the correction law, section four hundred seven of the
 surrogate's court procedure act [or], article ten of the mental  hygiene
 law OR SECTION THIRTEEN HUNDRED EIGHT-A OF THE REAL PROPERTY ACTIONS AND
 PROCEEDINGS LAW, who are financially unable to obtain counsel. Each plan
 shall  also  provide for investigative, expert and other services neces-
 sary for an adequate defense. The plan  shall  conform  to  one  of  the
 following:
  §  5. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
