  COMMEMORATING  the  40th  Anniversary  of Southern
  Tier AIDS Program
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize  that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York
State are reflective of the concerned and  dedicated  efforts  of  those
organizations  and  individuals  that  are devoted to the welfare of the
community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 40th Anniversary of Southern Tier AIDS  Program  (STAP);
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1984,  amid  the emergence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, a
dedicated group  of  Broome  County  citizens  comprised  of  healthcare
professionals,  educators, clergy, and community activists came together
with a common purpose - to address the devastating impact of the disease
on their  community;  this  passionate  coalition  successfully  secured
funding from the New York State Department of Health's AIDS Institute to
establish the Broome County AIDS Task Force; and
 
  WHEREAS,  STAP began its journey by establishing essential services,
including a hotline, resource directory, and educational campaigns;  the
organization quickly expanded its reach to meet the needs of the growing
severity  of  this  disease,  providing support programs for individuals
living with HIV/AIDS and advocating for access, equity, and justice  for
affected  communities;  as  the  epidemic intensified, STAP emerged as a
beacon of hope, offering much-needed services to  those  grappling  with
the physical, emotional, and social complexities of HIV/AIDS; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  years,  STAP  transitioned  into  a  separately
incorporated nonprofit entity, and evolved from its  grassroots  origins
to become a leading provider of HIV/AIDS services, with offices spanning
eight locations across the region; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the leadership of Executive Director John Barry, STAP
embraced  a  comprehensive  approach  to  healthcare,  encompassing
prevention, treatment,  and  support  services,  while  recognizing  the
importance  of  holistic  care;  as  a  result,  the  ever-impactful
organization expanded its services beyond traditional  HIV/AIDS  support
to address broader health and social needs within the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  the  Southern  Tier  AIDS  Program celebrates its 40th
anniversary, the organization reflects on  its  remarkable  journey  and
enduring legacy; over the years, STAP has touched the lives of countless
individuals  and  families,  providing essential support, resources, and
hope in the face of adversity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its 40-year history, Southern Tier  AIDS  Program  has
been  instrumental  in  providing  support and care to 2,735 individuals
living with  HIV/AIDS;  through  its  dedicated  services  and  advocacy
efforts,  STAP  has  made  a  profound impact in enhancing the lives and
 
well-being  of  those  affected  by  HIV,  demonstrating  a  steadfast
commitment  to  improving  health  outcomes  and  fostering  community
resilience in the face of this disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  lifesaving  Narcan  kits  to  housing assistance and
healthcare navigation, STAP's impact is felt across  the  Southern  Tier
region and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2023  alone, STAP's Narcan services saved the lives of
305  individuals,  underscoring  the  organization's  vital  role  in
addressing the opioid epidemic; additionally, nearly 100 individuals and
families  received  monthly  housing stipends, totaling over $510,000 in
assistance; STAP's  commitment  to  holistic  care  is  evident  in  its
provision  of  food  aid  to  over  5,400  individuals  and  families,
representing an 111% increase over the past two years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Looking ahead, Southern Tier AIDS Program remains dedicated
to its mission of promoting health, dignity, and social justice for all;
as the world continues to grapple with  new  challenges,  including  the
COVID-19  pandemic,  STAP  stands as a beacon of resilience, compassion,
and community support; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  acknowledge  this
exceptional  organization and its contributions to its community, and as
a result, the State and Nation as a whole, fully confident that it  will
continue  to  enjoy the sparkling successes it has experienced thus far;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Organizations which give of their  time  and  energies  and
serve  the  best  interests  of  their  communities  are an asset beyond
remuneration and cannot be sufficiently extolled; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  40th Anniversary of Southern Tier AIDS Program; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Southern Tier AIDS Program.
