 acting  by  the  Attorney General, may bring suit against such person in
 any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain such person from contin-
 uing such violation or from carrying out the threat of violation. In any

 bring  suit  to  enjoin  a  violation  or  threatened  violation  of any
 provision of article 23, or  any  rule,  regulation,  or  order  of  the
 department  made pursuant hereto, within ten days after receipt of writ-
 ten  request to do so by any person who is or will be adversely affected

 or threatening to violate a provision of article 23, or  a  rule,  regu-
 lation,  or  order  of  the department, and the action shall proceed and
