  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 10, 2023, as Social Emotional Learning Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and fully  in  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim Friday, March 10, 2023, as
Social Emotional Learning (SEL)  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction with International SEL Day on Friday, March 10, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The theme for SEL Day 2023 is "Uplifting Hearts, Connecting
Minds"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Social  emotional  learning  (SEL)  is the process through
which all young people and  adults  acquire  and  apply  the  knowledge,
skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions and
achieve  personal  and  collective  goals,  feel,  and  show empathy for
others, establish,  and  maintain  supportive  relationships,  and  make
responsible and caring decisions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Essential to success in our schools, workplaces, homes, and
communities,  SEL  competencies  develop  throughout our lives and allow
individuals to contribute meaningfully to society; and
 
  WHEREAS, With awareness for SEL  on  the  rise,  top  companies  are
beginning  to  emphasize  the importance of social and emotional skills;
success for the next generation of employees and entrepreneurs  requires
self-awareness, self-management, and responsible decision making; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Results  from  a  landmark  meta-analysis  show  that  SEL
interventions  that  addressed  the  five  core  competencies  of
self-awareness,  self-management, social awareness, relationship skills,
and responsible decision-making, increased academic performance by  11%,
improved  students'  ability  to  manage  stress, and improved attitudes
about self, others, and school; and
 
  WHEREAS, Research suggests that evidence based SEL programs are more
effective  when  they  include  strategies  for  family  and  community
engagement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cost-benefit research shows that for every dollar spent on
SEL, there is an $11 return on investment; and
 
  WHEREAS, Research shows  that  investments  in  evidence  based  SEL
programs  can  lead  to  improved  educational achievement and long-term
benefits to society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Community members should be encouraged to learn  about  and
share  their  knowledge  of  the  importance  and  impact of integrating
 
evidence based SEL into our schools, organizations and community as  our
Nation progresses today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be done to increase  activity  at  the
local, State, and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 10, 2023, as  Social
Emotional  Learning  (SEL)  Day  in the State of New York in conjunction
with International SEL Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York and SEL4NY.
