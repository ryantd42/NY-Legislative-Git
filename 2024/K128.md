BY: M. of A. Stern
 
  COMMEMORATING  the 275th Anniversary of St. John's
  Episcopal Church of Huntington, New York
 
  WHEREAS, Religious institutions, and the many spiritual, social  and
educational  benefits  they confer, play a vital role in the development
of the moral fabric of a responsible citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the tradition of this State and this  Nation  to  pay
tribute  to  those  institutions and individuals who have contributed to
the ethical and spiritual values of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 275th Anniversary of St. John's Episcopal Church; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this auspicious occasion will
be celebrated in 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1745, St. John's Episcopal Church  was  founded  by  the
Reverend  Samuel  Seabury  Sr., who later became the first Bishop of the
Episcopal Church; in 1748 Samuel Seabury Jr. was  appointed  Lay  Reader
and  Catechist  and  given  charge  of the new mission outpost under the
direction of his father; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1767, Reverend James Greaton became  the  first  settled
minister at St. John's Episcopal Church, and upon his death in 1773, was
the last settled minister for many years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During the Revolutionary War, the church building was used
as a stable  and  barracks  for  soldiers,  and  was  severely  damaged;
nevertheless,  local families held occasional services, and from time to
time a refugee clergyman was available  to  preach  and  administer  the
sacraments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  St.  John's  Episcopal  Church  struggled  after  the War,
however by 1838, the fortunes of the congregation had  improved  to  the
point  that the parish was incorporated, and the Reverend Isaac Sherwood
became the first rector; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1860, a new church was to be built on the old  site  and
the  Reverend Caleb Ellsworth lead the congregation; on May 6, 1862, the
new building was consecrated by Bishop Hobart; and
 
  WHEREAS, Towards the end of the 19th Century, St.  John's  Episcopal
Church  was  part  of  a  new  diocese,  improvements  were  made to the
building, and it flourished;  unfortunately,  on  Easter  in  1905,  the
building  was  destroyed  by  fire,  however, the furnishings were saved
which are still in use today; and
 
  WHEREAS, The current building  was  relocated  to  the  new  village
center  and  the  first  services  were held on Pentecost in 1907; a new
parish hall was built, and the church was consecrated  10  years  later;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The  20th Century saw rapid growth of the Huntington area;
in 1910, the Grace Chapel was established, and  many  improvements  were
made  including the installation of a Casavant organ in 1928; in 1964, a
Sunday School building was erected to handle the influx of  the  growing
congregation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  under  the  luminous leadership of Reverend Duncan
Burns, St. John's Episcopal Church is a  vibrant,  growing  congregation
with  youth  programs,  cultural events, a well-renowned nursery school,
Christian Education programs, and an outstanding choir; and
 
  WHEREAS, St. John's Episcopal Church  stands  on  the  threshold  of
tomorrow,  prepared  to  meet the challenges of the coming decades while
retaining that spiritual resolve which characterizes its past; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to take  note  of
enduring  religious  institutions  and to bring such institutions to the
attention of the people of this Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 275th Anniversary of St. John's Episcopal Church, fully
confident that this commemoration reflects the belief  in  those  values
which enhance the dignity and purpose of life; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Reverend Duncan Burns, St. John's Episcopal Church.
