  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  provide an increase in the defined benefit cost-of-
 living adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems.  Start-
 ing with a payment in September 2023, COLA will be payable to pensioners
 who have attained age fifty-five and have been  retired  at  least  five
 years.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25  of  the  Retirement
 and  Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill is  enacted  during
 the 2023 legislative session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $617 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a  past  service  cost  to cover retrospective benefit increases and (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1) To fund retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New  York  will  be
 required to pay $409 million as of March 1, 2024.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of all
 participating  employers  in the NYSLERS is 0.09% of billable salary, or
 approximately $11.4 million to the State of New York  and  approximately
 $16.5 million to local participating employers in the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent bill-
 ing  cycles  with changes in the billing rate and salary of the affected
 members.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 S. 6160  3
 
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2023 legislative session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $132 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in future
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $111 million  $70 million
  Tier 6  $21 million  $62 million
  Total  $132 million  $132 million

  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 participating  employers  in  NYSLPFRS  is  0.3%  of billable salary, or
 approximately $2.6 million to the State of New  York  and  approximately
 $10  million  to  the  local  participating employers in the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will  vary  in  subse-
 quent  billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of the
 affected members.
