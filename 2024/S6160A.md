  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide an increase in the  defined  benefit  cost-of-
 living adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems.  Start-
 ing with a payment in September 2024, COLA will be payable to pensioners
 who  have  attained  age  fifty-five and have been retired at least five
 years.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  (NYSLERS),  pursuant to Section 25 of the Retirement
 and Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely  by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $611 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a  past  service  cost  to cover retrospective benefit increases and (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1) To fund retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New  York  will  be
 required to pay $398 million (including interest) as of March 1, 2025.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of all
 participating  employers  in  NYSLERS  is  0.09%  of billable salary, or
 approximately $11 million to the State of New York and approximately $17
 million to the local participating employers.  This  PERMANENT  ANNUAL
 COST  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate and salary of the affected members.
 S. 6160--A  3
 
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $131 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $107 million  $62 million
  Tier 6  $24 million  $69 million
  Total  $131 million  $131 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in NYSLPFRS  is  0.3%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $2.6  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $11 million to the local participating employers. This PERMANENT  ANNUAL
 COST  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate and salary of the affected members.
