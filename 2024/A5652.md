  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing  an amendment to article 9 of the constitution, in relation to
  acts of the legislature having fiscal impact on local governments
 
  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur),  That  article  9  of  the
 constitution be amended by adding a new section 4 to read as follows:
  §  4. THE LEGISLATURE SHALL PROVIDE STATE FUNDING TO REIMBURSE CITIES,
 COUNTIES, TOWNS, AND/OR VILLAGES FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH  EXPENDI-
 TURES  MADE  AS A REQUIREMENT FOR ANY LAW, GENERAL OR SPECIAL, EFFECTIVE
 THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY SUCCEEDING THE APPROVAL OF  THE  VOTERS,  WHICH
 MANDATES  THE  UNDERTAKING  OF  A  NEW PROGRAM OR INCREASES THE LEVEL OF
 SERVICE OF AN EXISTING PROGRAM BY A CITY, COUNTY, TOWN, OR VILLAGE.  THE
 LEGISLATURE SHALL ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS AMONG
 THE CITIES, COUNTIES, TOWNS, AND/OR VILLAGES.
  THIS REQUIREMENT SHALL NOT APPLY WHERE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT OR MATCH-
 ING  FUNDS  ARE  AVAILABLE AND SUCH PROVISION WOULD DISQUALIFY A MUNICI-
 PALITY, OR IMPAIR A MUNICIPALITY'S ABILITY, TO PARTICIPATE IN OR RECEIVE
 SUCH FEDERAL FUNDS. THE LEGISLATURE SHALL, IN ITS DISCRETION,  DETERMINE
 IF  STATE  FUNDING  SHALL  BE  PROVIDED  FOR THE SUPPORT OF SUCH FEDERAL
 PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY A MUNICIPALITY.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendment  be
 referred  to  the  first regular legislative session convening after the
 next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly,  and,  in
 conformity  with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution, be
 published for three months previous to the time of such election.
