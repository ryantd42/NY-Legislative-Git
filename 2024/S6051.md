  4.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of subdivisions two and three of

 section  1.20 of this chapter, OR LEAVING THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT WITH-
 OUT REPORTING AS DEFINED IN SECTION SIX HUNDRED OF THE VEHICLE AND TRAF-
 FIC LAW, WHERE SUCH ACCIDENT RESULTED IN THE DEATH  OF  ANOTHER  PERSON,
 except as provided in paragraph (c) of subdivision two of section 722.23

 section 722.23 of this article, order transfer of an action  against  an
 adolescent  offender  to  the family court pursuant to the provisions of
 article seven hundred twenty-five  of  this  title,  provided,  however,
 notwithstanding  any other provision of law, section 308.1 of the family

 sion and such actions shall not be considered removals subject to subdi-
 vision thirteen of such section 308.1.
  5.  Notwithstanding subdivisions two and three of this section, at the
 request of the district attorney, the court shall order  removal  of  an
 action  against an adolescent offender charged with an offense listed in

 OUT REPORTING AS DEFINED IN SECTION SIX HUNDRED OF THE VEHICLE AND TRAF-
 FIC LAW, WHERE SUCH ACCIDENT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF ANOTHER PERSON,  a

 addition, be based upon a finding  of  one  or  more  of  the  following
 factors: (i) mitigating circumstances that bear directly upon the manner
 in  which  the  crime was committed; or (ii) where the defendant was not
 the sole participant in the crime,  the  defendant's  participation  was
 relatively minor although not so minor as to constitute a defense to the
 prosecution; or (iii) possible deficiencies in proof of the crime.

 this title if the court finds one or more of the following factors:  (i)
 mitigating circumstances that bear directly upon the manner in which the
 crime  was  committed; (ii) where the defendant was not the sole partic-
 ipant in the crime, the defendant's participation was  relatively  minor
 although  not so minor as to constitute a defense to the prosecution; or
 (iii) possible deficiencies in  the  proof  of  the  crime,  and,  after
 consideration  of  the  factors  set  forth  in  subdivision two of this
 section, the court determined that removal of the action to  the  family
 court would be in the interests of justice.
