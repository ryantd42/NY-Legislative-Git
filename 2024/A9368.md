 WHOSE  MEMBERS  THREATEN,  TERRORIZE,  AND  COMMIT A MULTITUDE OF CRIMES

  3. GANGS HAVE EXPANDED THEIR CRIMINAL PREDATIONS ACROSS  EVERY  REGION
 IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. FURTHERMORE, ALL OF THE NATIONALLY KNOWN GANGS
 NOW  EXIST  THROUGHOUT  NEW  YORK, AND THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT INFLUX OF
 HERETO UNKNOWN CRIMINAL GANGS AS WELL. WHILE GANG MEMBERSHIP IN THE PAST
 REMAINED  CONCENTRATED  PRIMARILY  IN LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, GANGS HAVE
 INCREASINGLY SURFACED EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT  THE  STATE,  IMPACTING  THE
 SAFETY, PROSPERITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL NEW YORKERS.
  4.  THE ENACTMENT OF THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ERADICATE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
 BY STREET GANGS BY FOCUSING UPON PATTERNS OF CRIMINAL GANG ACTIVITY, THE
 CHIEF SOURCE OF VIOLENCE CREATED BY STREET GANGS.
  5. FURTHER, THAT AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF  PUNISHING  AND  DETERRING  THE
 CRIMINAL  ACTIVITIES  OF  STREET  GANGS  IS  THROUGH  FORFEITURE  OF THE
 PROFITS, PROCEEDS, AND INSTRUMENTALITIES ACQUIRED, ACCUMULATED, OR  USED
 BY  STREET  GANGS. THESE PROCEEDS IN TURN, WILL PROVIDE A FUNDING STREAM
 TO IMPLEMENT PROACTIVE MEASURES SUCH AS AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS TO PREVENT
 YOUTHS FROM BECOMING GANG MEMBERS.
