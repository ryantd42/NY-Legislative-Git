Scouting  for  many  years,  has  lived up to Scouting's ideals, and has
attained all of the necessary achievements, including  completion  of  a
community  service  project,  which was successfully planned, developed,
and executed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Connor Dominick contributed  his  time  and  hard  work  to

  WHEREAS, To cover the cost of the materials for his project,  Connor

therapy gymnasium for the patients' access  when  it  was  installed  on
April 23, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Because  of  Connor  Dominick's  planning,  diligence, and
