  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor and pay
tribute to those individuals whose commitment to promoting the  richness
and  diversity  of  the  performing,  visual,  and  literary  arts,  has
contributed to the strength, vitality, and cultural enrichment of  their
communities and the great State of New York; and

long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the Alliance Classical Players upon the occasion of their induction into
the Rome Arts Hall of Fame on  Sunday,  May  5,  2024,  at  the  Capitol
Theatre in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 2005, The Rome Arts Hall of Fame aligns with
their  mission  to honor individuals who have a strong connection to the
Rome community and a significant involvement in the performing,  visual,
or  literary arts; the 17th group to be inducted, the Class of 2024 will
be celebrated by the Capitol Arts Complex with a schedule  of  induction
activities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the administrative direction of Colleen Reilly O'Neil
and Kristin Kelly Hahn, the Alliance Classical Players present versatile
instrumentations  and  musical  repertoire  to  audiences  in  venues
throughout Central New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Organizations devoted to improving the quality of life  for
others,  enabling  them  to  build  lives  of dignity and self-worth are
deserving of the highest praise and recognition; the Alliance  Classical
Players is one such organization; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  arts  are  the  building  blocks of civilization, are
central to human expression, enlighten us and inspire  the  imagination;
educational  institutions,  individuals, and organizations which further
such worthy purposes richly merit the recognition  and  appreciation  of
this  Legislative  Body  and  the  people of the State of New York; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
