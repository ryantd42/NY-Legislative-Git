 AN ACT to permit accidental death benefits to be awarded to the  benefi-
  ciary of Anthony Varvaro
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law,  rule  or  regu-
 lation  to  the  contrary,  Anthony Varvaro, who was a member of the New
 York state and local police and fire retirement  system  employed  as  a
 police officer by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and who
 died  on  September 11, 2022 as the result of an accident which occurred
 while he was travelling to work, shall be deemed to  have  died  as  the
 natural and proximate result of an accident sustained in the performance
 of  duty.  The  beneficiary or beneficiaries of Anthony Varvaro shall be
 eligible to receive the  accidental  death  benefit  if  an  application
 therefor  is  filed  within  one year of the effective date of this act.
 Any amounts paid by the New  York  state  and  local  police and  fire
 retirement  system as the result of the death of Anthony Varvaro prior
 to the receipt of the accidental death benefit pursuant to  this section
 shall be deducted from the benefit payable on an  actuarially  equiv-
 alent  basis  over  the expected future lifetime of the beneficiary or
 beneficiaries.
  § 2. All costs associated with this act shall be borne by the state of
 New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would make the statutory  beneficiary  or  beneficiaries  of
 Anthony Varvaro eligible to collect an accidental death benefit pursuant

 to  sections  361  and  361-a of the Retirement and Social Security Law.
 Anthony Varvaro was employed as a police officer with the Port Authority
 of New York and New Jersey until their  death  on  September  11,  2022.
 Currently,  an  ordinary  death benefit equal to three (3) times Anthony
 Varvaro's prior twelve-month salary is payable to a designated benefici-
 ary or beneficiaries.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative  Session  and  the
 required  application  for  an accidental death benefit is timely filed,
 there will be an immediate past  service  cost  of  approximately  $7.47
 million  which  will  be  borne  by  the State of New York as a one-time
 payment. This estimate assumes that payment will be  made  on  March  1,
 2025.
