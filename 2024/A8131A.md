 police officer by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and who
 died  on  September 11, 2022 as the result of an accident which occurred
 while he was travelling to work, shall be deemed to  have  died  as  the
 natural and proximate result of an accident sustained in the performance

 eligible to receive the  accidental  death  benefit  if  an  application
 therefor  is  filed  within  one year of the effective date of this act.
 Any amounts paid by the New  York  state  and  local  police and  fire
 retirement  system as the result of the death of Anthony Varvaro prior
 to the receipt of the accidental death benefit pursuant to  this section
 shall be deducted from the benefit payable on an  actuarially  equiv-
 alent  basis  over  the expected future lifetime of the beneficiary or
 beneficiaries.
  § 2. All costs associated with this act shall be borne by the state of
 New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:

 Retirement System until their death on September 11, 2022. Currently, an
 ordinary  death benefit equal to three times the member's prior 12-month
 salary is payable to the beneficiary selected by the member.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of  approximately  $6.67  million
 which will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
  The  statutory beneficiary must file an application for the accidental
 death benefits, in lieu of the ordinary death benefits, within one  year
 of the bill's effective date.
