 Introduced by M. of A. LEMONDES -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the public service law, in relation to requiring local
  phone companies to provide customers with a cost free option to  block
  certain information-access services

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative findings and intent. Effective  July  1,  1989
 customers  who wish to block "adult" messages, group calling services or
 recorded information and entertainment services from their  phones  have
 had  to  pay  a  five  dollar  fee. The legislature finds that customers
 should not have to pay to block a service they never requested and  that
 this blocking option should be made available free of charge.
  §  2.  Section 91 of the public service law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 15 to read as follows:
  15. (A) THE COST FOR PROVIDING BLOCKING SERVICES AND INFORMING CUSTOM-
 ERS THEREOF, SHALL BE BORNE  BY  THE  TELEPHONE  COMPANY  PROVIDING  THE
 BLOCKING  SERVICE, AND SHALL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THAT TELEPHONE COMPANY'S
 RATE BASE.
  (B) THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION  SHALL  PROMULGATE  THE  APPROPRIATE
 RULES  AND  REGULATIONS  WITHIN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE
 DATE OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
 
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
