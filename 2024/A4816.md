 conduct. Information transmitted to the  division  of  criminal  justice
 services  shall  be  limited to names and other non-clinical identifying
 information, which may only be used for determining  whether  a  license
 issued  pursuant  to section 400.00 of the penal law should be suspended

 license  issued  pursuant  to  section 400.00 of the penal law, or is no

  § 28. Subdivisions 4, 5, 10, 11 and 12 of section 400.00 of the  penal
 law,  subdivisions 4, 10 and 11 as amended by chapter 371 of the laws of
 2022, subdivision 5 as amended by chapter 1 of the laws of 2013, subpar-
 agraph (iii) of paragraph (e) of subdivision 5 as amended by chapter 244
 of the laws of 2019, and subdivision 12 as amended by chapter 207 of the
 laws of 2022, are amended to read as follows:
  4. Investigation. Before a license is issued or renewed,  there  shall
 be an investigation of all statements required in the application by the
 duly  constituted police authorities of the locality where such applica-
 tion is made[, including but not limited  to  such  records  as  may  be
 accessible  to  the  division  of  state  police or division of criminal
 justice services pursuant to section 400.02 of this article].  For  that
 purpose,  the  records  of  the  appropriate office of the department of
 mental hygiene concerning previous or  present  mental  illness  of  the
 applicant shall be available for inspection by the investigating officer
 of  the  police authority. Where the applicant is domiciled in a foreign
 state, the investigation shall include inquiry of the foreign state  for
 records  concerning the previous or present mental illness of the appli-
 cant, and, to the extent necessary for inspection by  the  investigating
 officer, the applicant shall execute a waiver of confidentiality of such
 record in such form as may be required by the foreign state. In order to
 ascertain  any previous criminal record, the investigating officer shall
 take the fingerprints and physical descriptive data in quadruplicate  of
 each  individual  by  whom  the  application is signed and verified. Two
 copies of such fingerprints shall be taken on standard fingerprint cards
 eight inches square, and one copy may be taken on a  card  supplied  for
 that  purpose by the federal bureau of investigation; provided, however,
 that in the case of a corporate applicant that has already been issued a
 dealer in firearms license and seeks to operate a firearm dealership  at
 a  second  or subsequent location, the original fingerprints on file may
 be used to ascertain any criminal record in  the  second  or  subsequent
 application  unless any of the corporate officers have changed since the
 prior application, in which case the new corporate officer shall  comply
 with  procedures governing an initial application for such license. When
 completed, one standard card shall be forwarded to and retained  by  the
 division  of  criminal  justice services in the executive department, at
 Albany. A search of the files of such division and written  notification
 of  the  results  of  the search shall be forwarded to the investigating
 officer and shall be made without unnecessary  delay.  Thereafter,  such
 division  shall  notify  the licensing officer and the executive depart-
 ment, division of state police, Albany, of any criminal  record  of  the
 applicant  filed therein subsequent to the search of its files. A second
 standard card, or the one supplied by the  federal  bureau  of  investi-
 gation,  as  the case may be, shall be forwarded to that bureau at Wash-
 ington with a request that the files  of  the  bureau  be  searched  and
 notification  of  the results of the search be made to the investigating
 police authority. Of the remaining two fingerprint cards, one  shall  be
 filed  with  the executive department, division of state police, Albany,
 A. 4816  18
 
 within ten days after issuance of  the  license,  and  the  other  shall
 remain  on file with the investigating police authority. No such finger-
 prints may be inspected by any person other than a peace officer, who is
 acting  pursuant  to  his  or  her  special duties, or a police officer,
 except on order of a judge or justice of a court of record  either  upon
 notice  to  the  licensee or without notice, as the judge or justice may
 deem appropriate. Upon  completion  of  the  investigation,  the  police
 authority  shall  report  the  results  to the licensing officer without
 unnecessary delay.
  5. Filing of  approved  applications.  (a)  The  application  for  any
 license,  if  granted,  shall be filed by the licensing officer with the
 clerk of the county of issuance, except that in the  city  of  New  York
 and,  in the counties of Nassau and Suffolk, the licensing officer shall
 designate the place of filing in the  appropriate  division,  bureau  or
 unit  of the police department thereof, and in the county of Suffolk the
 county clerk is hereby authorized to transfer all  records  or  applica-
 tions  relating  to  firearms to the licensing authority of that county.
 Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through [(f)] (E) of this  subdivi-
 sion,  the name and address of any person to whom an application for any
 license has been granted shall be a public record. Upon application by a
 licensee who has changed his place of residence such records or applica-
 tions shall be transferred to the appropriate officer at the  licensee's
 new  place  of  residence. A duplicate copy of such application shall be
 filed by the licensing officer in the executive department, division  of
 state police, Albany, within ten days after issuance of the license. The
 superintendent of state police may designate that such application shall
 be  transmitted  to  the division of state police electronically. In the
 event the superintendent of the division of state police determines that
 it lacks any of the records required to be filed with the  division,  it
 may  request  that  such  records  be  provided to it by the appropriate
 clerk, department or authority and such clerk, department  or  authority
 shall  provide  the division with such records. In the event such clerk,
 department or authority lacks such records, the division may request the
 license holder provide information sufficient to constitute such  record
 and  such  license  holder shall provide the division with such informa-
 tion. Such information shall be limited to the  license  holder's  name,
 date of birth, gender, race, residential address, social security number
 and  firearms possessed by said license holder. Nothing in this subdivi-
 sion shall be construed to change the expiration date or  term  of  such
 licenses  if  otherwise  provided  for  in  law.  [Records  assembled or
 collected for purposes of inclusion in the database established by  this
 section  shall  be released pursuant to a court order. Records assembled
 or collected for purposes of inclusion in the database created  pursuant
 to  section  400.02  of  this chapter shall not be subject to disclosure
 pursuant to article six of the public officers law.]
  (b) Each application for a license pursuant to paragraph (a)  of  this
 subdivision  shall  include,  on a separate written form prepared by the
 division of state police within thirty days of  the  effective  date  of
 [the]  chapter  ONE  of the laws of two thousand thirteen, which amended
 this section, and provided to the applicant at the same time and in  the
 same  manner  as  the  application for a license, an opportunity for the
 applicant to request an exception from his or her  application  informa-
 tion  becoming  public record pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivi-
 sion. Such forms, which shall also be made available to individuals  who
 had applied for or been granted a license prior to the effective date of
 [the]  chapter  ONE  of  the laws of two thousand thirteen which amended
 A. 4816  19
 
 this section, shall notify  applicants  that,  upon  discovery  that  an
 applicant  knowingly  provided  false information, such applicant may be
 subject to penalties pursuant to section 175.30  of  this  chapter,  and
 further,  that  his  or  her  request for an exception shall be null and
 void, provided that written  notice  containing  such  determination  is
 provided to the applicant. Further, such forms shall provide each appli-
 cant  an  opportunity to specify the grounds on which he or she believes
 his or her application information should  not  be  publicly  disclosed.
 These  grounds,  which shall be identified on the application with a box
 beside each for checking, as applicable, by the applicant, shall  be  as
 follows:
  (i)  the  applicant's  life  or safety may be endangered by disclosure
 because:
  (A) the applicant is an active or retired police officer, peace  offi-
 cer, probation officer, parole officer, or corrections officer;
  (B)  the applicant is a protected person under a currently valid order
 of protection;
  (C) the applicant is or was a witness in a criminal proceeding involv-
 ing a criminal charge;
  (D) the applicant is participating or  previously  participated  as  a
 juror  in  a criminal proceeding, or is or was a member of a grand jury;
 or
  (E) the applicant is a spouse, domestic partner or household member of
 a person identified in this subparagraph or subparagraph  (ii)  of  this
 paragraph,  specifying  which  subparagraph or subparagraphs and clauses
 apply.
  (ii) the applicant has reason to believe his or her life or safety may
 be endangered by disclosure due to reasons stated by the applicant.
  (iii) the applicant has reason to believe he or she may be subject  to
 unwarranted harassment upon disclosure of such information.
  (c)  [Each form provided for recertification pursuant to paragraph (b)
 of subdivision ten of this section shall include an opportunity for  the
 applicant  to request an exception from the information provided on such
 form becoming public record pursuant to paragraph (a) of  this  subdivi-
 sion.  Such  forms  shall notify applicants that, upon discovery that an
 applicant knowingly provided false information, such  applicant  may  be
 subject  to  penalties  pursuant  to section 175.30 of this chapter, and
 further, that his or her request for an  exception  shall  be  null  and
 void,  provided  that  written  notice  containing such determination is
 provided to the applicant. Further, such forms shall provide each appli-
 cant an opportunity to either decline to request the grant or  continua-
 tion of an exception, or specify the grounds on which he or she believes
 his  or her information should not be publicly disclosed. These grounds,
 which shall be identified in the application with a box beside each  for
 checking, as applicable, by the applicant, shall be the same as provided
 in paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
  (d)]  Information submitted on the forms described in paragraph (b) of
 this subdivision shall be excepted from disclosure and maintained by the
 entity retaining such information separate  and  apart  from  all  other
 records.
  [(e)]  (D) (i) Upon receiving a request for exception from disclosure,
 the licensing officer shall grant such exception, unless the request  is
 determined  to  be  null and void, pursuant to paragraph (b)[ or (c)] of
 this subdivision.
  (ii) A request for an exception from disclosure may  be  submitted  at
 any time, including after a license or recertification has been granted.
 A. 4816  20
 
  (iii)  If an exception is sought and granted pursuant to paragraph (b)
 of this subdivision, the application information  shall  not  be  public
 record,  unless  the  request  is determined to be null and void. [If an
 exception is sought and granted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subdi-
 vision,  the  information  concerning  such  recertification application
 shall not be public record, unless the request is determined to be  null
 and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph,
 local  and  state law enforcement shall, upon request, be granted access
 to and copies of such application information provided that such  infor-
 mation  obtained  by law enforcement pursuant to this subparagraph shall
 not be considered a public record of such law enforcement agency.
  (f)] (E) The information of licensees  or  applicants  for  a  license
 shall not be disclosed to the public during the first one hundred twenty
 days  following  the  effective date of [the] chapter ONE of the laws of
 two thousand thirteen, which amended this section.  After  such  period,
 the  information  of those who had applied for or been granted a license
 prior to the preparation of the form for requesting an exception, pursu-
 ant to paragraph (b) of this subdivision, may be released only  if  such
 individuals  did  not  file  a  request for such an exception during the
 first sixty days following such preparation; provided, however, that  no
 information contained in an application for licensure or recertification
 shall  be  disclosed  by an entity that has not completed processing any
 such requests received during such sixty days.
  [(g)] (F) If a request for an exception is determined to be  null  and
 void  pursuant  to paragraph (b) [or (c)] of this subdivision, an appli-
 cant may request review of such determination pursuant to article seven-
 ty-eight of the civil practice [laws] LAW  and  rules.  Such  proceeding
 must  commence  within  thirty  days after service of the written notice
 containing the adverse determination. Notice of the  right  to  commence
 such  a petition, and the time period therefor, shall be included in the
 notice of the determination. Disclosure following such a petition  shall
 not be made prior to the disposition of such review.
  10.  License:  expiration,  certification and renewal. (a) Any license
 for gunsmith or dealer in firearms and, in the city  of  New  York,  any
 license  to  carry  or  possess a pistol or revolver, issued at any time
 pursuant to this section or prior to the first  day  of  July,  nineteen
 hundred  sixty-three  and not limited to expire on an earlier date fixed
 in the license, shall, except as otherwise provided in  paragraph  [(d)]
 (C) of this subdivision, expire not more than three years after the date
 of  issuance.  In  the  counties of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester, any
 license to carry or possess a pistol or revolver,  issued  at  any  time
 pursuant  to  this  section  or prior to the first day of July, nineteen
 hundred sixty-three and not limited to expire on an earlier  date  fixed
 in  the license, shall expire not more than five years after the date of
 issuance; however, in the county of Westchester, any such license  shall
 be  certified  prior to the first day of April, two thousand, in accord-
 ance with a schedule to be contained in regulations promulgated  by  the
 commissioner  of  the  division  of criminal justice services, and every
 such license shall, except as otherwise provided in paragraph [(d)]  (C)
 of  this  subdivision,  be  recertified every five years thereafter. For
 purposes of this section certification  shall  mean  that  the  licensee
 shall  provide  to the licensing officer the following information only:
 current name, date of birth, current address, and the make, model, cali-
 ber and serial number of all firearms currently possessed. Such  certif-
 ication  information shall be filed by the licensing officer in the same
 manner as an amendment. Elsewhere than in the city of New York  and  the
 A. 4816  21
 
 counties  of  Nassau,  Suffolk  and Westchester, any license to carry or
 possess a pistol or revolver,  issued  at  any  time  pursuant  to  this
 section  or prior to the first day of July, nineteen hundred sixty-three
 and  not  previously  revoked or cancelled, shall be in force and effect
 until revoked as herein provided. Any license not  previously  cancelled
 or  revoked shall remain in full force and effect for thirty days beyond
 the stated expiration date on such license. Any application to  renew  a
 license that has not previously expired, been revoked or cancelled shall
 thereby extend the term of the license until disposition of the applica-
 tion  by the licensing officer. In the case of a license for gunsmith or
 dealer in firearms, in counties having a population  of  less  than  two
 hundred  thousand  inhabitants,  photographs  and  fingerprints shall be
 submitted on original applications and upon renewal thereafter at  three
 year  intervals. Upon satisfactory proof that a currently valid original
 license  has  been  despoiled,  lost  or  otherwise  removed  from  the
 possession of the licensee and upon application containing an additional
 photograph  of  the licensee, the licensing officer shall issue a dupli-
 cate license.
  (b) [All licensees shall be  recertified  to  the  division  of  state
 police  every  five  years  thereafter,  except as otherwise provided in
 paragraph (d) of this subdivision. Any license issued before the  effec-
 tive  date  of  the  chapter  of the laws of two thousand thirteen which
 added this paragraph shall be recertified by the licensee on  or  before
 January  thirty-first, two thousand eighteen, and not less than one year
 prior to such date, the state police shall send a notice to all  license
 holders  who  have  not  recertified  by such time. Such recertification
 shall be in a form as approved by the superintendent  of  state  police,
 which  shall  request  the license holder's name, date of birth, gender,
 race, residential address, social security number, firearms possessed by
 such license holder, email address at the option of the  license  holder
 and  an  affirmation  that  such  license  holder is not prohibited from
 possessing firearms. The form may be in an electronic form if so  desig-
 nated  by the superintendent of state police. Failure to recertify shall
 act as a revocation of such  license.  If  the  New  York  state  police
 discover  as  a  result  of  the recertification process that a licensee
 failed to provide a change of address, the New York state  police  shall
 not require the licensing officer to revoke such license.
  (c)] A license to purchase or take possession of a semiautomatic rifle
 as  defined  in  subdivision two of this section shall be recertified to
 the applicable licensing officer every five years following the issuance
 of such license. Failure to renew such a license shall  be  a  violation
 punishable  by  a fine not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars, and such
 failure to renew shall be  considered  by  the  licensing  officer  when
 reviewing  future license applications by the license holder pursuant to
 this chapter.
  [(d)] (C) Licenses issued under paragraph (f) of  subdivision  two  of
 this section shall be recertified or renewed in the same form and manner
 as  otherwise  required by this subdivision, provided however, that such
 licenses shall be recertified or renewed every three years following the
 issuance of such license. For licenses issued  prior  to  the  effective
 date  of  this paragraph that were issued more than three years prior to
 such date, or will expire in less than one year from such date shall  be
 recertified or renewed within one year of such date.
  11. License: revocation and suspension. (a) The conviction of a licen-
 see  anywhere  of a felony or serious offense [or a licensee at any time
 becoming ineligible to obtain a license, including engaging  in  conduct
 A. 4816  22

 that would have resulted in the denial of a license, under this section]
 shall  operate  as  or  be  grounds for, a revocation of the license.  A
 license may be revoked or suspended as provided for in section 530.14 of
 the  criminal  procedure law or section eight hundred forty-two-a of the
 family court act. Except for a license issued pursuant to section 400.01
 of this article, a license may be revoked and cancelled at any  time  in
 the  city of New York, and in the counties of Nassau and Suffolk, by the
 licensing officer, and elsewhere than in the city of  New  York  by  any
 judge  or  justice  of  a  court of record; a license issued pursuant to
 section 400.01 of this article may be revoked and cancelled at any  time
 by the licensing officer or any judge or justice of a court of record. A
 license  to engage in the business of dealer may be revoked or suspended
 for any violation of the provisions of  article  thirty-nine-BB  of  the
 general business law. The official revoking a license shall give written
 notice  thereof  without  unnecessary delay to the executive department,
 division of state police, Albany, and shall also notify immediately  the
 duly constituted police authorities of the locality. The licensing offi-
 cer shall revoke any license issued in which an applicant knowingly made
 a  material  false  statement on the application. Notice of a revocation
 under this subdivision shall be issued in writing and shall include  the
 basis for the determination, which shall be supported by a preponderance
 of  the  evidence.  Such notice shall also include information regarding
 the ability to appeal  such  decision  in  accordance  with  subdivision
 four-a of this section.
  (b)  Whenever  the  director  of community services IN THE COUNTIES OF
 KINGS, QUEENS, RICHMOND, NEW YORK AND BRONX,  or  his  or  her  designee
 makes  a  report pursuant to section 9.46 of the mental hygiene law, the
 division of criminal justice services  shall  convey  such  information,
 whenever  it  determines that the person named in the report possesses a
 license issued pursuant to this section, to  the  appropriate  licensing
 official, who shall issue an order suspending or revoking such license.
  (c)  In  any  instance  in  which  a  person's license is suspended or
 revoked under paragraph (a) or (b)  of  this  subdivision,  such  person
 shall  surrender  such license to the appropriate licensing official and
 any and all firearms, rifles, or shotguns owned  or  possessed  by  such
 person  shall be surrendered to an appropriate law enforcement agency as
 provided in subparagraph (f)  of  paragraph  one  of  subdivision  a  of
 section  265.20  of  this  chapter.  In the event such license, firearm,
 shotgun, or rifle is not surrendered, such items shall  be  removed  and
 declared  a  nuisance  and  any  police  officer or peace officer acting
 pursuant to his or her special duties is authorized to  remove  any  and
 all such weapons.
  12. Records required of gunsmiths and dealers in firearms. In addition
 to  the  requirements set forth in article thirty-nine-BB of the general
 business law, any person licensed as  gunsmith  or  dealer  in  firearms
 shall  keep a record book approved as to form, except in the city of New
 York, by the superintendent of state police. In the record book shall be
 entered at the time of every transaction involving a firearm  the  date,
 name, age, occupation and residence of any person from whom a firearm is
 received  or  to  whom  a  firearm  is delivered, and the calibre, make,
 model, manufacturer's name and serial number,  or  if  none,  any  other
 distinguishing  number  or  identification  mark on such firearm. Before
 delivering a firearm to any person, the licensee shall  require  him  to
 produce  either  a  license valid under this section to carry or possess
 the same, or proof of lawful authority as an exempt person  pursuant  to
 section 265.20 of this chapter and either (a) the National Instant Crim-
 A. 4816  23

 inal  Background  Check  System  (NICS)  or  its  successor has issued a
 "proceed" response to the licensee, or (b)  thirty  calendar  days  have
 elapsed  since  the  date  the  licensee  contacted  NICS  to initiate a
 national instant criminal background check and NICS has not notified the
 licensee  that  the  transfer  of  the  firearm to such person should be
 denied. In addition, before delivering a firearm to a peace officer, the
 licensee shall verify that person's status as a peace officer  with  the
 division  of  state police. After completing the foregoing, the licensee
 shall remove and retain the attached coupon and enter in the record book
 the date of such license, number, if any,  and  name  of  the  licensing
 officer,  in the case of the holder of a license to carry or possess, or
 the shield or other number, if any, assignment and department,  unit  or
 agency, in the case of an exempt person. The original transaction report
 shall  be  forwarded  to the division of state police within ten days of
 delivering a firearm to any person, and a duplicate copy shall  be  kept
 by  the  licensee. The superintendent of state police may designate that
 such record shall be completed and transmitted  in  electronic  form.  A
 dealer  may  be granted a waiver from transmitting such records in elec-
 tronic form if the superintendent determines that such dealer is incapa-
 ble of such transmission due to technological limitations that  are  not
 reasonably  within  the  control  of  the  dealer,  or other exceptional
 circumstances demonstrated by the dealer, pursuant to a  process  estab-
 lished  in  regulation,  and  at  the  discretion of the superintendent.
 [Records assembled or collected for purposes of inclusion in  the  data-
 base  created  pursuant  to  section 400.02 of this article shall not be
 subject to disclosure pursuant to article six  of  the  public  officers
 law.]  The record book shall be maintained on the premises mentioned and
 described in the license and shall be open at all reasonable  hours  for
 inspection  by any peace officer, acting pursuant to his special duties,
 or police officer. In the event of cancellation  or  revocation  of  the
 license  for  gunsmith or dealer in firearms, or discontinuance of busi-
 ness by a licensee, such record book shall be immediately surrendered to
 the licensing officer in the city of New York, and in  the  counties  of
 Nassau  and Suffolk, and elsewhere in the state to the executive depart-
 ment, division of state police.
  § 29. Subdivision 16-a of section 400.00 of the penal law, as added by
 chapter 1 of the laws of 2013, paragraph (a-1) as added by chapter 98 of
 the laws of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
  16-a. Registration. (a) An owner of a weapon defined in [paragraph (e)
 or (f)] SUBPARAGRAPH (V) OR (VI) OF PARAGRAPH (B) of  subdivision  twen-
 ty-two  of  section 265.00 of this chapter, WHO RESIDES IN THE COUNTY OF
 KINGS, QUEENS, RICHMOND, NEW YORK OR BRONX, possessed before the date of
 the effective date of [the] chapter ONE of  the  laws  of  two  thousand
 thirteen  which added this paragraph, must make an application to regis-
 ter such weapon with the superintendent of state police, in  the  manner
 provided by the superintendent, or by amending a license issued pursuant
 to  this  section within one year of the effective date of this subdivi-
 sion except any weapon defined under [subparagraph (vi)] CLAUSE  (F)  OF
 SUBPARAGRAPH  (VII)  of paragraph [(g)] (B) of subdivision twenty-two of
 section 265.00 of this chapter transferred into the state may be  regis-
 tered  at  any  time, provided such weapons are registered within thirty
 days of their transfer into the state.  Registration  information  shall
 include  the registrant's name, date of birth, gender, race, residential
 address, social security number and a description of each  weapon  being
 registered. A registration IN THE COUNTY OF KINGS, QUEENS, RICHMOND, NEW
 YORK  OR  BRONX,  of any weapon defined under [subparagraph (vi)] CLAUSE
 A. 4816  24

 (F) OF SUBPARAGRAPH (VII) of paragraph [(g)] (B) of subdivision  twenty-
 two  of  section 265.00 or a feeding device as defined under subdivision
 twenty-three of section 265.00 of this chapter  shall  be  transferable,
 provided  that  the  seller notifies the DIVISION OF state police within
 seventy-two hours of the transfer and the buyer provides the DIVISION OF
 state police with information sufficient to  constitute  a  registration
 under  this section. Such registration shall not be valid if such regis-
 trant is prohibited or becomes  prohibited  from  possessing  a  firearm
 pursuant  to  state  or  federal law. The superintendent shall determine
 whether such registrant is prohibited from possessing  a  firearm  under
 state or federal law. Such check shall be limited to determining whether
 the  factors  in  18  USC 922 (g) apply or whether a registrant has been
 convicted of a serious offense as defined in  subdivision  sixteen-b  of
 section  265.00  of this chapter, so as to prohibit such registrant from
 possessing a firearm, and whether a report has been issued  pursuant  to
 section  9.46  of  the mental hygiene law.  [All] SUCH registrants shall
 recertify to the division of state police every five  years  thereafter.

 any person from whom ammunition is received or  to  whom  ammunition  is

 mark on such ammunition.
  3.  [No  later  than thirty days after the superintendent of the state
 police certifies that the statewide license and record  database  estab-
 lished pursuant to section 400.02 of this article is operational for the
 purposes  of  this section, a] A dealer in firearms licensed pursuant to
 section 400.00 of this article, a seller of  ammunition  as  defined  in
 subdivision twenty-four of section 265.00 of this chapter DOING BUSINESS

 firearms  as  defined  in  subdivision  nine of such section 265.00 or a
 seller of ammunition as defined in subdivision  twenty-four  of  section
 265.00 of this chapter, unless:
  (a)  before  the  completion  of  the transfer, the licensee or seller

 sufficient to identify such dealer or seller, transferee based on infor-
 mation  on  the transferee's identification document as defined in para-
 graph (c) of this subdivision, as well as the amount, calibre,  manufac-
 turer's name and serial number, if any, of such ammunition;
  (b) the [system] SUPERINTENDENT provides the licensee or seller with a

 examining a valid state identification document of the transferee issued
 by the department of motor vehicles or if the transferee is not a  resi-
 dent of the state of New York, a valid identification document issued by
 the  transferee's  state or country of residence containing a photograph
 of the transferee.

 section  400.02  of this article or the registry established pursuant to
 subdivision sixteen-a of section 400.00 of this article].  The  division
 of  state police may share such information with a local law enforcement
 agency. Evidence of the purchase of  ammunition  is  not  sufficient  to
 establish  probable  cause to believe that the purchaser has committed a
 crime absent other information tending to  prove  the  commission  of  a
 crime.  Records assembled or accessed pursuant to this section shall not
 be subject to disclosure pursuant to article six of the public  officers
 law.  This  requirement  of  this section shall not apply (i) if a back-
 ground check cannot be completed because the system is  not  operational

 be accessed by the practitioner due  to  a  temporary  technological  or
 electrical  failure,  as  set  forth  in regulation, or (ii) a dealer or
 seller has been granted a waiver from conducting such  background  check
 if  the  superintendent  of  state police determines that such dealer is
 incapable of such check due to technological limitations  that  are  not

 circumstances demonstrated by the dealer, pursuant to a  process  estab-
 lished in regulation, and at the discretion of such superintendent.

 MOND,  NEW  YORK  OR BRONX may be conducted through the national instant
 criminal background check system or through the division of state police
 once the division has been designated point  of  contact,  use  of  that
 system by a dealer or seller shall be sufficient to satisfy subdivisions
 four and five of this section and such checks shall be conducted through
 such  system,  provided  that  a  record  of  such  transaction shall be
 forwarded to the state police in a form determined  by  the  superinten-
 dent.
  7. No commercial transfer of ammunition shall take place IN THE COUNTY
 OF  KINGS,  QUEENS, RICHMOND, NEW YORK OR BRONX unless a licensed dealer
 in firearms or registered seller of ammunition acts as  an  intermediary
 between the transferor and the ultimate transferee of the ammunition for
 the  purposes  of  contacting  the statewide license and record database
 pursuant to this section. Such transfer between the  dealer  or  seller,
 and transferee must occur in person.

 seller shall be revoked.
  §  32. Subdivision 6 of section 400.03 of the penal law, as separately
 amended by sections 8 and 19 of chapter 371 of  the  laws  of  2022,  is

 seller  shall contact the division of state police to conduct such check
 which shall be sufficient to satisfy subdivisions four and five of  this
 section.

 400.10 of the penal law, as amended by chapter 1 of the  laws  of  2013,
