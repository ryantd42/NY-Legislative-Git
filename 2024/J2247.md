BY: Senator MATTERA
 
  COMMENDING  Francesca Augello upon the occasion of
  her designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Francesca  Augello  upon  the  occasion  of  her designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Francesca Augello works as a lunch aide  in  Commack,  Long
Island and has a special affinity for children; as a mother herself, she
greatly  values  supporting  youth  to  evolve  into  mature,  kind, and
compassionate adults; and
 
  WHEREAS, During lunch break on  Friday,  March  8,  2024,  Francesca
Augello  noticed  that  a second grade student had his head down and was
coughing; coming to the realization that the student was  choking  on  a
piece  of  pizza  when  he  failed  to respond to her, Francesca Augello
rushed to his aid; and
 
  WHEREAS, Although not trained in CPR, Francesca Augello was informed
about the Heimlich Maneuver and performed the correct actions needed  to
save the student's life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Francesca  Augello  was aware that day in the cafeteria to
what was going on, and her vigilance prevailed that day as a student was
in need of life-saving help; and
 
  WHEREAS, Justly recognized  as  a  hero,  Francesca  Augello  richly
merits the admiration of this Legislative Body and her community for her
consummate, swift action in saving the life of this young student; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Moreover,  Francesca  Augello  should  be  meritoriously
commended for remaining calm under pressure and for  showing  valor  and
true courage while performing a lifesaving deed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Francesca  Augello, in her spontaneous and heroic act, has
so aptly demonstrated her character and compassion for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of her action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
 
respond  without  thought of danger or reward when others are in need of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Francesca Augello  upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation  as
recipient  of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed upon an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Francesca Augello.
