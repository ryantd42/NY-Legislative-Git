  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 6, 2023, as Dentist's Day in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS, It is incumbent upon the people of the State of New York to
commend  and  recognize  those  esteemed  individuals within the medical
community for their extraordinary and  sustained  contributions  to  the
progress of medicine and the improvement of life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  6,  2023,  as
Dentist's Day in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Dentist's Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Observed  every  year  on  March  6th,  Dentist's  Day was
established as a way to show appreciation and thanks for dentists, bring
awareness to dentistry so that people will know more about how  to  care
for  their teeth, and encourage people who may have avoided going to the
dentist to come in for a checkup; and
 
  WHEREAS, A dentist is a doctor, scientist and clinician dedicated to
the highest  standards  of  health  through  prevention,  diagnosis  and
treatment of oral diseases and conditions; a dentist plays a key role in
the  early detection of oral cancer and other systemic conditions of the
body that manifest themselves in the mouth, and can often identify other
health conditions, illnesses, and other problems that sometimes show  up
in  the  oral  cavity  before  they are identified in other parts of the
body; and
 
  WHEREAS, A dentist evaluates the overall health  of  their  patients
while  advising  them about oral health and disease prevention; performs
clinical  procedures,  such  as  exams,  fillings,  crowns,  implants,
extractions  and  corrective surgeries; identifies, diagnoses and treats
oral conditions; and performs general dentistry or practices in  one  of
nine dental specialties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  the  late  1990s, cosmetic and aesthetic dentistry had
become more and  more  popular  as  patients  were  requesting  colorful
braces,  veneers,  implants, and bleaching to make their teeth and smile
look better; and
 
  WHEREAS, Unfortunately, only 42 percent of  adults  report  visiting
the  dentist  less  than once every year, 40 percent of children younger
than the age of three have never been to the dentist, and three  out  of
four millennials brush their teeth only once a day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first  mention of dental hygiene can be dated back to
5000 B.C. when the ancient Sumerians believed tooth worms  caused  decay
and cavities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The first dentist, Hesy-Ra from ancient Egypt, is known to
be one of the earliest dental practitioners, as recorded in  2600  B.C.;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1530,  Artzney Buchlein wrote the first book on dental
health entitled Little Medicinal Book for  All  Kinds  of  Diseases  and
Infirmities of the Teeth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since ancient times, dentists have proven themselves to be
a great asset to medicine and to the health and welfare of the  citizens
of the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  6,  2023,  as
Dentist's Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
