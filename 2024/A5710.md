 Introduced  by  M.  of A. PHEFFER AMATO -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  certain  disabilities  of  university police officers appointed by the
  state university of New York

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 3 of section 363-a of the retirement and social
 security  law, as amended by chapter 437 of the laws of 2016, is amended
 to read as follows:
  3. As used in this section, the terms "firefighter" and "police  offi-
 cer"  mean  any  member who is performing police or fire service, as the
 phrase police or fire service is defined in paragraphs a, b, c, d, f (as
 added by chapter six hundred seventy-four of the laws of nineteen eight-
 y-six), f (as added by chapter six hundred seventy-seven of the laws  of
 nineteen  eighty-six),  g,  h,  I and j of subdivision eleven of section
 three hundred two of this article, and who, prior to entry into  service
 as a firefighter or police officer, successfully passed a physical exam-
 ination  which  failed  to  disclose  evidence  of  any disease or other
 impairment of the heart.
  § 2. The amendments to section 363-a  of  the  retirement  and  social
 security  law  made by section one of this act shall not affect, impair,
 or invalidate any  temporary  right,  privilege,  or  benefit  conferred
 pursuant  to  the  provisions  of a general, special or local law (other
 than pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the retirement and social securi-
 ty law) for any member of a public retirement  system  or  pension  plan
 funded  by the state or one of its political subdivisions, nor shall any
 amendments thereto affect the application of such provisions as extended
 by the provisions of section 480 of the retirement and  social  security
 law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  is  a  technical  correction to Chapter 561 of the Laws of
 2015.  It would add a  "heart  bill"  performance  of  duty  disability
 provision  for  police  officers of the State University of New York who
 are members of the New York State and Local Police and  Fire  Retirement
 System (NYSLPFRS).
  If this legislation is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it
 would  lead  to more disabilities being classified as "in performance of
 duty".
  However, we anticipate that few additional performance of  duty  disa-
 bility  retirements  will  be granted, and thus, the resulting costs are
 expected to be negligible.
