  §  190.  Establishment  or  extension of improvement districts. Upon a

 lish  or  extend  in  said  town a sewer, drainage, water, water quality

 referendum  on  petition under section twenty-four of the municipal home
 rule law or a permissive referendum under article nine  of  the  village
 law,  as  the  case  may  be, and except, in the case of a water quality
 treatment district, on consent of a village expressed in a local law  or
 by  resolution  of the board of trustees and not subject to any referen-
 dum.

 same in the minutes of its proceedings reciting  a  description  of  the

 hook-up fees, if any, to, and the cost of the district or extension  to,

 home, was computed.
