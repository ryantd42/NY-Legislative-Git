  CENSUS DATA: The number of members who will benefit in the future from
 the  statutory  presumption  provided in this bill is unknown. The esti-
 mates presented herein are based on preliminary census data collected as
 of June 30, 2023. The census data for  the  potentially  impacted  popu-
 lation used to develop the average costs is summarized below.
 
  FIRE
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  10,720
  - Average Age:  40.8
  - Average Service:  13.9
 S. 9594  3
 
  - Average Salary:  139,500
  Receiving Members (within five years of retirement)
  - Number Count:  2,483
  - Average Age:  54.3
 
  IMPACT  ON MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, a FIRE member who becomes disa-
 bled due to ALS would be eligible for an applicable ordinary  disability
 retirement,  generally a lifetime payment based on salary (generally 1/3
 of salary for Tier 3 members and 1/2 of salary for Tier 2  members),  or
 the service retirement benefit if greater. The ordinary death benefit is
 a  lump  sum payment generally equal to three times the member's salary.
 Currently, FIRE retirees who become disabled, or die,  after  retirement
 due to ALS are not eligible to reclassify their existing benefit.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  the performance of duty disability
 benefit for eligible FIRE members and retirees who are disabled from ALS
 would generally be equal to:
  * 75% of Final Average Salary (FAS), where
  * FAS is defined as 1-Year FAS for Tier 2 and 3-Year FAS for TIER 3.
  Under the proposed legislation, the performance of duty death  benefit
 would  generally  be  equal  to  a lifetime benefit of 50% of a member's
 wages earned during the last year of service, plus, if  applicable,  the
 Special  Accidental Death Benefit (SADB) payable under General Municipal
 Law section 208-f.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement system.
  The number of members  who  will  benefit  in  the  future  from  this
 proposed  legislation  is unknown. The cost of this proposed legislation
 could vary greatly depending on the number of future members who benefit
 and on their length of service, age, and salary history.
  The estimated financial impact for members has been calculated  assum-
 ing eligible members die in the year following the valuation date.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
