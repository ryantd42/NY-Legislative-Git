 Introduced  by  M. of A. THIELE -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. COLTON
  -- read once and referred to the Committee on Ways and Means
 
 AN ACT to amend the tax law, in relation to the definition of the metro-
  politan commuter transportation  district  for  the  purposes  of  the
  metropolitan  commuter  transportation  mobility tax; and to amend the
  public authorities law, in  relation  to  requiring  the  metropolitan
  transportation  authority  to  renegotiate the joint service operating
  agreement with the state of Connecticut
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. Pursuant to chapter 25 of the laws of
 2009, the legislature did enact the metropolitan mobility tax within the
 twelve  county  region  constituting  the  metropolitan  transportation
 district. The legislature hereby finds that the residents of  the  towns
 of  Brookhaven,  East  Hampton,  Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southold and
 Southampton in the  county  of  Suffolk  receive  minimal  mass  transit
 services  from the metropolitan transportation authority. Further, these
 towns already pay  substantial  taxes  to  the  MTA  for  these  minimal
 services,  including increased sales taxes and mortgage recording taxes.
 It has been estimated these six towns contribute more than  $60  million
 annually to the MTA than they receive back in service.
  In the interest of tax fairness and to avoid such additional inequita-
 ble  taxation  on  these  towns, it is the purpose of this act to exempt
 such towns from the newly adopted metropolitan  commuter  transportation
 mobility tax.
  § 2. Subsection (a) of section 800 of the tax law, as added by section
 1  of  part  C  of chapter 25 of the laws of 2009, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (a) Metropolitan commuter transportation  district.  The  metropolitan
 commuter  transportation  district  ("MCTD") means the area of the state
 included in the district created and governed by section twelve  hundred

 FROM  THE  DISTRICT  FOR  THE  PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE AND ANY REVENUES
