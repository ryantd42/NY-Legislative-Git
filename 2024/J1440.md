40th  Anniversary  of Bornhava of Amherst, New York, to be celebrated on

community  in 1983, with a place for young children with disabilities to
receive services; and

preschool children and six staff members, eventually moving to the  Park
School in 1988; and

four full day preschool classrooms at its Chateau location, as  well  as
five  integrated  preschool  classrooms  within  the  community;  its
community-based program provides special education and related  services
to children in their homes and other community locations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  this vital organization provides evaluations
in all  areas  of  development  for  hundreds  of  children  each  year;

17 different school districts throughout Erie and Niagara Counties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining true  to  its  mission  to  nurture  and  educate
differently-abled  children  through  play,  Bornhava  is  creating  the
foundation for these children to thrive at no cost  to  their  families;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bornhava promotes inclusiveness by empowering its children
to  reach  their  true  potential  as  self-advocates  and  valuable
contributors to the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  its  distinguished  40-year  history,  Bornhava  has
demonstrated continuous service to the residents and  communities  which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  Bornhava is in direct correlation to the
efforts of its dedicated staff and sponsors, whose involvement  is,  and

enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves; and
