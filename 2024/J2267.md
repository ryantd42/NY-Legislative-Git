  CONGRATULATING  the  City of Poughkeepsie upon the
  occasion of  hosting  the  17th  Annual  Guelaguetza
  Festival on August 4, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
congratulate the City of Poughkeepsie upon the occasion of  hosting  the
17th Annual Guelaguetza Festival on Sunday, August 4, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originating in Oaxaca, Mexico, the Guelaguetza Festival is
an annual celebration that brings  families,  friends,  and  communities
together  to  celebrate,  dance,  and  enjoy  the colorful traditions of
Oaxaca; and
 
  WHEREAS, The local Oaxacan community began the festival, now in  its
17th  year,  in  order to strengthen cultural and community bonds in the
city of Poughkeepsie and the broader Hudson Valley region; and
 
  WHEREAS,  "Guelaguetza"  is  a  word  from  the  indigenous  Zapotec
language  that  means sharing of mutual gifts, and that is the spirit of
Poughkeepsies' festival where more than 100 artists, dancers, musicians,
and singers present the culture and traditions of the eight  regions  of
Oaxaca, Mexico, highlighting the typical dances, the music of the towns,
the flavors, and the majestic colors of the costumes of Oaxaca; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A binational celebration, groups, presenters, and teachers
coming specially from Oaxaca, Mexico, gather at this renowned  event  to
participate in the La Guelaguetza de Poughkeepsie Festival; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Poughkeepsie shore of the Hudson River has been home to
La  Guelaguetza  since  2008;  this  most important of festivals for the
Oaxacan community is an opportunity  to  spend  time  with  friends  and
neighbors  regardless  of  race,  color,  language,  gender identity, or
nationality; a moment for all to enjoy the culture,  traditions,  music,
dance, food, and identity of the native peoples of Oaxaca; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  the  City of Poughkeepsie upon the occasion of hosting the
17th Annual Guelaguetza Festival on August 4, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Grupo  Folclorico  de Poughkeepsie and the Poughkeepsie
Guelaguetza Organizing Committee.
