  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 26, 2024, as  Indian  Republic  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  26,  2024,  as
Indian  Republic  Day  in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Republic Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 26th of January was chosen as Republic Day  because  on
this  day in 1930, the Declaration of Indian Independence was proclaimed
in defiance of colonial  British  rule;  it  became  official  in  1950,
honoring  the  date  in which the Constitution of India came into effect
with a democratic government system, completing the country's transition
towards becoming an independent Republic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year,  2024,  marks  the  74th  Anniversary  the
Constitution  of India came into effect, an important milestone for both
India and democracy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Indian Republic Day celebrates the great  contributions  of
Indian  Americans  to  the  fabric  of New York, and pays tribute to the
common culture and bonds of friendship between the United States and the
Indian Republic; and
 
  WHEREAS, Indian Republic  Day  affirms  the  culture,  identity  and
self-esteem  of  a people; it celebrates a rich heritage and illuminates
the  Indian  history  and  tradition,  as  well  as  the  spirit  of  an
indomitable people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  First arriving in the mid-19th Century, there are now more
than 300,000 Indian Americans living in New York, making it  the  second
largest Indian American population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  more Indian Americans reside in the New York
City metropolitan area than any other urban center in the country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Research  shows  that  72%  of  Indian  Americans  have  a
bachelor's  degree compared to 37% of Americans, and a higher percentage
than immigrants from the United Kingdom and other Asian Countries; and
 
  WHEREAS, Immigrants contributed two trillion dollars to  the  United
States  economy  in  2015-2016  alone,  and  new  claims  state  that
Indian-Americans are the most entrepreneurial of all groups; and
 
  WHEREAS, Indian Republic Day is a time to celebrate the  aspirations
and values that have been shared with Indian people for generations, and
 
to recognize the countless contributions of Americans and New Yorkers of
Indian descent to every aspect of society; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  January  26,  2024,  as
Indian Republic Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
