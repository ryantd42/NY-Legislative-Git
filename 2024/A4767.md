  on school districts
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1. The education law is amended by adding a new section 308-a
 to read as follows:
  § 308-A. SPECIAL PROVISIONS; MANDATES. 1. AS  USED  IN  THIS  SECTION,
 "MANDATE"  MEANS  (A)  ANY STATE LAW, RULE OR REGULATION WHICH CREATES A
 NEW PROGRAM OR REQUIRES A  HIGHER  LEVEL  OF  SERVICE  FOR  AN  EXISTING
 PROGRAM  WHICH  A  SCHOOL  DISTRICT, ORGANIZED EITHER BY SPECIAL LAWS OR
 PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF A GENERAL LAW, IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE, OR
  (B) ANY GENERAL LAW WHICH GRANTS  A  NEW  PROPERTY  TAX  EXEMPTION  OR
 INCREASES  AN  EXISTING  PROPERTY  TAX  EXEMPTION  WHICH ANY SUCH SCHOOL
 DISTRICT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE.
  2. IN THE EVENT THAT A MANDATE WHICH IMPOSES  A  COST  UPON  A  SCHOOL
 DISTRICT  IS CREATED AFTER THE ADOPTION OF A SCHOOL BUDGET, SUCH MANDATE
 SHALL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR WHICH SUCH  SCHOOL
 BUDGET WAS ADOPTED.
  3. NOTWITHSTANDING SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION, SUCH A MANDATE CAN
 BE IMPOSED IF:
  (A) THE MANDATE IS PROVIDED AT THE OPTION OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT UNDER
 A LAW, REGULATION, RULE OR ORDER THAT IS PERMISSIVE RATHER THAN MANDATO-
 RY;
  (B)  THE MANDATE IS REQUIRED BY, OR ARISES FROM, AN EXECUTIVE ORDER OF
 THE GOVERNOR EXERCISING HIS OR HER EMERGENCY POWERS; OR
  (C) THE MANDATE IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE OR EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT  IMPLE-
 MENTS A FEDERAL LAW OR REGULATION AND RESULTS FROM COSTS MANDATED BY THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE BORNE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, UNLESS THE STATUTE OR
 EXECUTIVE  ORDER  IMPOSES  COSTS  WHICH EXCEED THE COSTS MANDATED BY THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
