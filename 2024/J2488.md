from September 6-8, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  year  2024  marks  the  203rd  Anniversary  of  Greek
Independence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Greek  people  proudly  trace  their  heritage  back
thousands  of  years  in  Europe,  where  they  developed  an  advanced
civilization unlike any the world had yet seen; and
 
  WHEREAS, A two-family wooden house located at 107 Clinton Street  in
Schenectady  was  purchased for the purpose of using it as a church, and
on April 19, 1915, is recorded the legal transaction of the transfer  of
the  property for the sum of $1.00 from Mr. and Mrs. Tom Kansas, Mr. and
Mrs.  Anthony Svolos, Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Contompasis and Mr. and Mrs.
Alexander Stathes to the Hellenic Orthodox Church of St. George; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year after Labor Day,  the  Annual  St.  George  Greek
Festival is held, which was established in 1976 and has been a staple in
the  Schenectady  community,  with the help of St. George Greek Orthodox
Church and their Parish Council; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Annual St. George Greek Festival features three days of
delicious homemade Greek food including moussaka, spanakopita, dolmades,
souvlaki and mouthwatering  pastries  including  baklava,  kataifi,  and
loukoumathes,  as  well as live music, folk dancing, arts and crafts and
raffles; and
 
  WHEREAS, Organizers, sponsors and  many  volunteers  and  supporters
work  diligently and commit their time and energy to make the annual St.
George Greek Festival a premier attraction in the  City  of  Schenectady
and a resounding success year in and year out; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
those New Yorkers of Hellenic descent for their  enduring  contributions
to  the  educational,  social, moral and economic principles that are so
deeply ingrained in the fabric of our  country  and  State,  along  with
 
those  events  that  celebrate  this  significant  rich  heritage;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the St.  George  Greek  Orthodox  Church  and  their  Parish
