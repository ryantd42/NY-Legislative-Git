  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of Symeon's
  Greek Restaurant of Yorkville, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
illustrious  culinary  establishments which have positively impacted and
substantially contributed to the vitality of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  Symeon's  Greek  Restaurant  of
Yorkville, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Mohawk  Valley got its first taste of authentic Greek
cuisine on October 12, 1973, when the doors to Symeon's Greek Restaurant
were opened; and
 
  WHEREAS, Symeon Tsoupelis and his wife, Ann, were the very first  to
establish  a restaurant on Oneida Street in the City of Utica, New York;
during its humble beginnings, the building could only  seat  20  guests,
and  while Symeon operated the restaurant, Ann was busy at home crafting
all the desserts and being a full-time mother to two young children; and
 
  WHEREAS, After three  prosperous  years  in  Utica,  Symeon's  Greek
Restaurant relocated to Genesee Street in New Hartford, where the dining
area  could accommodate twice as many diners; for another six years, the
restaurant was wildly successful and Symeon and Ann Tsoupelis  knew  the
time had come for yet an even bigger building and a more prime location;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1982, Symeon and Ann Tsoupelis purchased their current
Commercial Drive property in Yorkville, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, With much hard work dedicated to treating guests as  family
and  consistently  serving  delicious  Greek  cuisine,  Symeon's  Greek
Restaurant continued to  grow  far  beyond  what  its  owners  had  ever
imagined; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  only  a  few  years  at the new location, the first
addition, another large dining room, was  added  to  nearly  double  the
seating  capacity;  three  years later, the second addition expanded the
dining area even more and grew the size of the kitchen; and
 
  WHEREAS, Symeon's Greek Restaurant continued to  flourish,  and  the
final  addition,  a  dining  room  in the front and a lobby where guests
could comfortably wait for their tables, was added in 1991; and
 
  WHEREAS, Overcoming much  adversity,  including  the  death  of  Ann
Tsoupelis in 2001, and a devastating fire the following winter, Symeon's
Greek Restaurant continues to be a local favorite and true staple within
its beloved community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A cornerstone of Symeon's Greek Restaurant is the love for
family, and in 2001, Symeon sold  the  business  to  his  youngest  son,
 
Symeon  Jr.  and his wife, Shelli, who now continue to carry the success
of the business; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  legacy  created  by Symeon and Ann Tsoupelis is being
carefully preserved by Symeon Jr., as he and his wife work side-by-side,
along with their daughter, Sophia; their son, Symeon III  is  coming  of
age and will soon become a part of the business; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to furthering the success of this extraordinary
Greek  establishment,  Symeon Jr. has also dedicated himself to honoring
the  memories  of  his  mother  and  sister  through  involvement  in
organizations  which  support cancer research, awareness, and education;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The remarkable success of Symeon's Greek Restaurant is  due
in  large  part  to  its  owners  and  dedicated  staff whose warmth and
hospitality are easily recognized by their loyal patrons;  this  dynamic
team  is  well-versed  in  customer service and truly makes everyone who
walks through their door feel like family; and
 
  WHEREAS, For five decades, Symeon's Greek Restaurant has stood as  a
beloved  establishment  which  has provided a friendly, open environment
for patrons to collectively gather and share their thoughts,  ideas  and
life experiences; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business  and  its  contributions  to  the
local  and  State  economies,  fully  confident that it will continue to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Symeon's Greek  Restaurant,  and  to
offer  its  best wishes to its owners for continued success in all their
future endeavors; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Symeon's Greek Restaurant, Yorkville, New York.
