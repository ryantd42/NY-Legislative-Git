Assembly Resolution No. 153
 
BY: M. of A. Darling
 
  RECOGNIZING  Friday,  March  10,  2023, as Harriet
  Tubman Day
 
  WHEREAS, Harriet Ross Tubman was an American  heroine  and  patriot,
who faithfully served her country and liberated her people; her tireless
efforts to attain freedom for those enslaved, and her dedication to stop
the inhuman practice of slavery, should be recognized and celebrated; it
is  only  fitting  to pay tribute to an American heroine, who sacrificed
everything for the well being of her people and country; and
 
  WHEREAS, In June of 2003, legislation was signed into  law  to  make
March  10th  a  Day of Commemoration; March 10th recognizes the lifetime
achievements and the historical legacy established  by  Harriet  Tubman,
and her many accomplishments throughout New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Harriet  Ross Tubman, the great American abolitionist, was
born around 1820, on a plantation in Dorchester County, Maryland; as was
the case of many slaves, she was put to work as a field hand at an early
age; and
 
  WHEREAS, Because of her color and her status  as  a  slave,  Harriet
Tubman  was  denied  the  opportunity  to  learn  to  read  or  write;
nevertheless, she was able to  rise  above  the  limitations  that  were
placed on her as a slave and as a black woman; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1849, Harriet Tubman escaped to the North and settled in
Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania;  while  in  Philadelphia,  she  met William
Still, the Philadelphia Stationmaster of the "Underground Railroad";  it
was  William Still along with the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society that
introduced Harriet Tubman to the  inner  workshops  of  the  Underground
Railroad; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Underground  Railroad  was  a network of families and
people that offered assistance, food, or shelter to slaves, during their
escape to the North; one year after her escape, Harriet Tubman became  a
conductor  (guide  who led escaped slaves to freedom) on the Underground
Railroad; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1851, Harriet Tubman relocated members of her family  to
North Street in St. Catharine's, Ontario, Canada; this eventually became
her  headquarters  for  the  Underground Railroad; in the ensuing years,
Harriet Tubman became one of the most influential conductors; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the mid-1850s Harriet Tubman made  the  acquaintance  of
United  States  Senator, Secretary of State and former New York Governor
William H. Seward and his  wife,  Frances,  in  Auburn,  New  York;  the
Sewards  in 1857 provided a home for Harriet Tubman in Auburn, New York,
which was later sold to her; and
 
  WHEREAS, This new home was to become the new base of operations  for
the  Underground  Railroad; when the Civil War began, Harriet Tubman was
able to  liberate  hundreds  of  her  people  to  freedom  through  this
 
efficient  network;  she was proud to claim that she never ran her train
off the track and never lost a passenger; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Harriet Tubman served as a cook in the Union Army in South
Carolina, a nurse, a  scout  for  raiding  parties,  and  a  spy  behind
confederate  lines; after her service to the Union Army, she returned to
Auburn, New York, where she lived the remaining years of  her  life;  in
1903,  she  transferred  ownership  of  her  property to the A.M.E. Zion
Church; and
 
  WHEREAS, After Harriet Tubman's death on March 10, 1913, the  church
developed and managed her home and adjacent property in order to sustain
her  memory;  Harriet Tubman was buried in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn,
New York, with full military honors; currently, the Harriet Tubman  home
and  property  are  registered as National Historic Landmarks in Auburn,
and the site is also part of the National Parks Service  Freedom  Trail;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Harriet  Tubman was many things to many people, but to the
Black slaves, she was considered to be the "Black Moses"  who  delivered
them  the  buried  promise of freedom; through her actions and life, she
embodies the true essence of service, spirit and  strength;  because  of
her  spirit,  strength and conviction, countless slaves were given hope;
she was  compelled  to  risk  her  own  freedom  so  that  others  could
experience freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  establishment  of this Day of Commemoration, on
March 10, 2004, the rich historical  legacy  and  life  achievements  of
Harriet Tubman are recognized and celebrated in New York each year; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize Friday, March 10, 2023, as Harriet Tubman Day.
