  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2, 2024, as Custodial  Worker's  Recognition
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to inform key audiences about the  role
and  value of those employees who keep our schools and workplaces across
the Nation running; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2,  2024,  as
Custodial  Worker's  Recognition  Day  in  the  State  of  New  York, in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National  Custodial  Worker's
Recognition Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Often under-appreciated for the hard work they do day after
day, custodial workers operate behind the scenes; they are the employees
who  keep  schools,  hospitals, office buildings, museums, churches, and
other buildings clean and well maintained; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  delivering  outstanding  services  and  running  a
well-maintained building, custodial workers contribute to critical first
impressions  and  the  success  of any business; they are the people who
make our businesses look good; and
 
  WHEREAS, Custodial workers also save  businesses  and  organizations
money by maintaining carpets and surfaces; in addition, seasonal updates
and  maintenance  help  buildings  to run more efficiently and make them
safer and healthier for those entering them; and
 
  WHEREAS, The work is physically  demanding,  and  depending  on  the
position,  custodial  workers  may  work  varying shifts and possibly in
several locations; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to join  with  the
custodial  workers  in  the  State  of  New  York  in  celebrating  and
acknowledging their accomplishments; no matter where they are  employed,
custodial  workers  should  be  thanked,  not just on Custodial Worker's
Recognition Day, but at every  opportunity  throughout  the  year;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2,  2024,  as
Custodial  Worker's  Recognition Day in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
