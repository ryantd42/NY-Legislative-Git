  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing an amendment to section 7 of article 4 of the constitution, in
  relation to requiring the governor submit to oral questions  from  the
  legislature annually

  Section  1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 7 of article
 4 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 7. (A) Every bill which shall have passed the  senate  and  assembly
 shall,  before  it  becomes  a law, be presented to the governor; if the
 governor approve, he or she shall sign it; but if not, he or  she  shall
 return it with his or her objections to the house in which it shall have
 originated,  which  shall  enter the objections at large on the journal,
 and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration,  two-thirds
 of  the  members  elected to that house shall agree to pass the bill, it
 shall be sent together with the objections, to the other house, by which
 it shall likewise be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds of  the
 members elected to that house, it shall become a law notwithstanding the
 objections  of  the governor. In all such cases the votes in both houses
 shall be determined by yeas and nays,  and  the  names  of  the  members
 voting  shall  be  entered on the journal of each house respectively. If
 any bill shall not be returned by the governor within ten days  (Sundays
 excepted)  after  it  shall  have been presented to him or her, the same
 shall be a law in like manner as if he or she had signed it, unless  the
 legislature  shall,  by  their adjournment, prevent its return, in which
 case it shall not become a law without the approval of the governor.  No
 bill  shall become a law after the final adjournment of the legislature,
 unless approved by the governor within thirty days after  such  adjourn-
 ment.  If  any  bill  presented to the governor contain several items of
 appropriation of money, the governor may object to one or more  of  such
 items while approving of the other portion of the bill. In such case the
 governor  shall  append to the bill, at the time of signing it, a state-

 ment of the items to which he or she objects; and the  appropriation  so
 objected  to shall not take effect. If the legislature be in session, he
 or she shall transmit to the house in which the bill originated  a  copy
 of  such statement, and the items objected to shall be separately recon-
 sidered. If on reconsideration one or more of such items be approved  by
 two-thirds  of the members elected to each house, the same shall be part
 of the law, notwithstanding the objections  of  the  governor.  All  the
 provisions  of  this  section,  in relation to bills not approved by the
 governor, shall apply in  cases  in  which  he  or  she  shall  withhold
 approval from any item or items contained in a bill appropriating money.
  (B)  THE  GOVERNOR  SHALL  SUBMIT IN PERSON TO ORAL QUESTIONS FROM THE
 LEGISLATURE FOR TWO HOURS IN JOINT SESSION ONCE PER YEAR AT A  TIME  SET
 BY AGREEMENT OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendments be
 referred  to  the  first regular legislative session convening after the
 next succeeding general election of the members of the assembly, and, in
 conformity with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution,  be
 published for three months previous to the time of such election.
