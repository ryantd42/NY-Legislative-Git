  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  The  family  court act is amended by adding a new section
 161-a to read as follows:
  § 161-A. ACCESS TO FAMILY COURT PROCEEDINGS. 1. THE FAMILY COURT SHALL
 BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, INCLUDING THE NEWS  MEDIA,
 SHALL  HAVE  ACCESS TO ALL COURTROOMS, LOBBIES, PUBLIC WAITING AREAS AND
 OTHER COMMON AREAS OF THE FAMILY COURT  OTHERWISE  OPEN  TO  INDIVIDUALS
 WITH BUSINESS BEFORE THE COURT.
  2. THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY PERSON SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM A COURTROOM
 ONLY  IF  THE COURT DETERMINES, ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS THAT SUCH EXCLU-
 SION IS WARRANTED. IN EXERCISING THIS DISCRETION, THE COURT MAY  CONSID-
 ER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE FOLLOWING:
  (A)  WHETHER SUCH PERSON IS CAUSING OR LIKELY TO CAUSE A DISRUPTION IN
 THE PROCEEDINGS;
  (B) WHETHER SUCH PERSON'S PRESENCE  IS  OBJECTED  TO  BY  ONE  OF  THE
 PARTIES OR THE ATTORNEY FOR THE CHILD;
  (C)  THE  ORDERLY  AND  SOUND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, INCLUDING THE
 NATURE OF SUCH PROCEEDING, THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF  INDIVIDUALS  BEFORE
 THE  COURT,  AND  THE  NEED  FOR PROTECTION OF LITIGANTS, IN PARTICULAR,
 CHILDREN, FROM HARM; AND
  (D) WHETHER LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO EXCLUSION ARE UNAVAILABLE
 OR INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR CASE.
  3. WHERE A COURT EXERCISES ITS DISCRETION IN EXCLUDING ANY PERSON, THE
 GENERAL PUBLIC, OR NEWS MEDIA FROM A PROCEEDING OR A PART OF A  PROCEED-
 ING  IN  FAMILY  COURT,  IT  SHALL MAKE A FINDING ON THE RECORD PRIOR TO
 ORDERING SUCH EXCLUSION.
  4. WHEN NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE DECORUM  OF  SUCH  PROCEEDINGS,  THE
 COURT  SHALL  INSTRUCT  REPRESENTATIVES  OF  THE  NEWS  MEDIA AND OTHERS
 REGARDING PERMISSIBLE USE OF SUCH COURTROOM AND OTHER FACILITIES OF SUCH
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 the laws of 1982, is amended to read as follows:
  §  341.1.  Exclusion  of  general  public.  The  general public may be

 SECTION  ONE  HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE-A OF THIS ACT, and only such persons and

 proceed to hear and determine the case. The respondent shall be informed
 of the contents of the petition, advised of [his] THEIR right  to  coun-
 sel,  and  shall  be  given  opportunity  to  be  heard  and  to present

 ACT.

 shall offer testimony of access by others at or about the  time  charged

 evidence except when corroborated by other facts and circumstances tend-
 ing  to prove such access. The court may exclude the general public from
 the room where the proceedings are heard  and  may  admit  only  persons
