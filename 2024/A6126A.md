  Section  1. Section 3216 of the insurance law is amended by adding two
 new subsections (n) and (o) to read as follows:
  (N) NO POLICY OR CERTIFICATE OF ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE  PROVID-
 ING  DISABILITY  BENEFITS DELIVERED OR ISSUED FOR DELIVERY TO ANY PERSON

 QUALIFY  FOR  SUCH  BENEFITS,  AND  TO  PURSUE SUCH BENEFITS THROUGH ANY
 REQUIRED ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS.

 IS  ENTITLED  TO  SUCH BENEFITS AND A MEANS OF REASONABLY ESTIMATING THE
 AMOUNT PAYABLE;
  (2) THE INSURER MAKES A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO  ASSIST  THE  INSURED  IN
 APPLYING FOR SUCH BENEFITS; AND
  (3)  THE  INSURED  FAILS  TO  APPLY FOR, OR PURSUE, SUCH BENEFITS WITH
