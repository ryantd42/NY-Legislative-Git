  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 28-May 4, 2024, as Small Business Week in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  From  Montauk  to  Buffalo,  Plattsburgh to Binghamton and
every community in-between,  small  businesses  are  the  heart  of  our
communities  and  the  American economy, employing more than half of our
Nation's workers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Historic investments made through the President's  American
Rescue  Plan  Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science
Act and Inflation Reduction Act will ensure small businesses have access
to  federal  capital  support,  technical  assistance,  contracting
opportunities,  and  other  resources to help lead the way as we rebuild
America's roads and bridges and build a clean  energy  economy  for  the
future; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When  we  support  small businesses, jobs are created, and
local communities preserve their unique culture: and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the 2022 Annual Small Business Report prepared
by  Empire  State  Development,  small  businesses  continue  to  be  a
significant  economic  driver  in  New  York  State with an estimated 98
percent  of  New  York  businesses  having  fewer  than  100  employees,
employing 39 percent of the workforce; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Upstate New York District offices of the U.S. NY Small
Business Association, which services 34 counties in New York State  with
offices  in  Syracuse,  Elmira and Albany, facilitated over 580 loans in
Fiscal Year 2023, with a value over $240 million dollars; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State continues to actively support  minority  and
women-owned  business enterprises and veteran-owned and service-disabled
veteran-owned businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Small  businesses  of  all  kinds,  from  family-owned
restaurants  and  farmers markets to antique stores and landscapers, are
crucial to the health of our communities  and  to  the  State's  economy
overall, but have been greatly tested during these past few years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  innovation,  diversity,  competitive  strength,  job
creation, and quality of life that small businesses bring to our economy
are vital elements for our State's long-term economic health; and
 
  WHEREAS, The entrepreneurial spirit of New York residents has led to
the creation and growth of emerging agricultural industries in New York,
such as craft beverages, artisanal foods, and the  production  of  hemp,
hops and adult-use cannabis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Small  businesses showed great ingenuity and resilience by
adapting quickly to pandemic related restrictions and weathered economic
hardship; and
 
  WHEREAS, The future welfare of our State depends  on  the  continued
development of small businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By renewing our commitment to supporting small businesses,
we can maintain our global competitiveness and build a  stronger  Nation
where everyone can succeed; and
 
  WHEREAS, When we join National Small Business Week, celebrated since
1963, we join in our country's recognition of the contributions of small
businesses  to the American economy and their importance in ensuring our
local communities remain as vibrant as tomorrow as they are today; and
 
  WHEREAS, The members of the  New  York  State  Legislature  wish  to
proclaim  their  recognition of small businesses as a crucial element in
the economy of New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to

Small Business Week in the State of New York; and be it further

York.
