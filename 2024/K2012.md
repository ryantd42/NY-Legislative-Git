  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  the
continuing  welfare  of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly
enriched and reliably  served  by  the  purposeful  endeavors  of  those
organizations  within  our  midst  that strive to enhance the quality of
life in their communities by promoting  wildlife  conservation,  science

  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  25th  Anniversary  of  the  Utica  Zoo's  Brewfest  on
Saturday, August 3, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, Brewfest is the Utica Zoo's annual beer tasting event which
takes place on zoo grounds and  features  more  than  120  craft  beers,
ciders, seltzers, and malt beverages on tap, as well as wine samples and
wine  slushies,  with  all proceeds benefitting the animals of the Utica
Zoo; and
 
  WHEREAS, Located in Roscoe-Conkling Park, the Utica Zoo  has  served
the region for more than 100 years and is part of a recreational complex
made  possible  by  the donation of land from Thomas R. Proctor in 1909;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Utica Zoo has grown from  its  humble  beginnings  with
three  fallow deer in 1914, to its present collection of over 99 species
of animals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Accredited by the Association of Zoos  and  Aquariums,  the
Utica Zoo creates unique experiences and promotes public appreciation of
wildlife through education, conservation, and recreation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its inception, the dedicated staff of the Utica Zoo
has connected people to the natural world and  provided  engaging  guest
experiences,  excellent  animal  care,  and  exceptional  conservation
education; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Utica Zoo is a  destination  much  appreciated  by  the
residents of the State of New York and visitors who seek the historical,
cultural,  and  recreational  resources  of  the area; it is a source of
pride and community heritage to all the people of Utica; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  25th Anniversary of the Utica Zoo's Brewfest on August
3, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
