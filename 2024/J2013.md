  COMMENDING  the  Boy Scouts of America Five Rivers
  Council's  Camp  Gorton  upon  the  occasion  of
  celebrating its 100th Anniversary on July 13, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
youth of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend the Boy Scouts of America Five Rivers Council's Camp Gorton upon
the  occasion  of  celebrating its 100th Anniversary to be celebrated at
Camp Gorton on Saturday, July 13, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1922, Camp Gorton was established on the property of Dr.
William Gorton, the  first  mayor  of  Corning,  New  York;  the  scenic
location  was  on  Waneta  Lake  in  the Finger Lakes Region of New York
State; in 1924, it was relocated to the other side of the lake after Dr.
Gorton and several other local leaders purchased the property; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout its  century-long  existence,  Camp  Gorton  has
promoted  education,  conservation, and leadership values to hundreds of
thousands of campers, staff members, and future leaders from the Steuben
Area Council, the Five Rivers Council, the  community,  and  the  world;
summer  camp  and year-round camping have been the avenues through which
these character-building principles were imparted; and
 
  WHEREAS, Presently, Camp Gorton provides Cub Scout Resident camp and
Boy Scout Resident camp; more than 50 merit badges,  including  nine  or
more  pertaining  to Eagle Scout status, are awarded; numerous programs,
including the Gorton Trail Hiker Award, Shooting Sports Top Shot  Award,
Scoutcraft  Woodsman Award, Polar Swim and Fish, and Mile Swim, meet the
needs of all scouts, regardless of experience levels; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Camp Gorton is in direct correlation to  the
efforts  of  its  members,  whose  involvement  is, and always has been,
characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
an uncompromising standard of excellence in all endeavors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Boy Scouts of America Five Rivers Council's Camp Gorton upon
the occasion of celebrating its 100th  Anniversary,  and  to  honor  its
members, past and present, who have labored so conscientiously to secure
and  improve  the quality of life for the youth of the community; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  the  Boy  Scouts  of America Five Rivers Council's Camp
Gorton.
