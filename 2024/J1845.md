  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their
profession,  certainly  have  earned the recognition and applause of all
the citizens of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Leigh  Ellis  upon  the  occasion  of  her  special  designation for her

Haub School of Law Leadership Award Dinner at  the  Westchester  Country
Club in Rye, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Law Leadership Dinner is the signature fundraiser for
the Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University and a celebration to

contributions  to  the legal community, the Law School, and the practice
of Law; and
 
  WHEREAS, Having joined the  faculty  in  2023,  Leigh  Ellis  is  an
Assistant Professor at Creighton University School of Law; and

offenses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Leigh  Ellis,  in  her  capacity  as  a  public  defender,
represented  clients  in  bench  trials,  jury  trials,  and  appellate

Service Award; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Leigh  Ellis'  law  school  career  culminated  with  her
participating  in  Chief  Justice  Lippman's  Pro Bono Scholars Program,

school and then dedicate the remainder of her spring semester to working

of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
