  Section  1.  Paragraph 1 of subsection (c-1) of section 606 of the tax
 law, as amended by section 1 of part HH of chapter 56  of  the  laws  of
 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  (1)  A  resident taxpayer shall be allowed a credit as provided herein
 equal to the greater of one hundred dollars times the number of qualify-

 tax  credit allowed the taxpayer under section twenty-four of the inter-

 Provided,  however,  in  the  case  of a taxpayer whose federal adjusted
 gross income exceeds  the  applicable  threshold  amount  set  forth  by
 section  24(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, the credit shall only be
 equal to the applicable percentage of the child tax credit  allowed  the
 taxpayer under section [24] TWENTY-FOUR of the Internal Revenue Code for
 each qualifying child. For the purposes of this subsection, a qualifying
 child shall be a child who meets the definition of qualified child under
 section  24(c)  of  the internal revenue code. The applicable percentage
 shall  be  [thirty-three]  FORTY-FIVE  percent.  For  purposes  of  this
 subsection,  any  reference  to section [24] TWENTY-FOUR of the Internal
 Revenue Code shall be a reference to such section as  it  existed  imme-
 diately prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97.
  §  2.  Subsection  (c-1)  of  section 606 of the tax law is amended by
 adding a new paragraph 5 to read as follows:
