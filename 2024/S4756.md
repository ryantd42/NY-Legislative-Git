 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure  law,  in  relation  to  vacating
  convictions  for  offenses resulting from sex trafficking, labor traf-
  ficking and compelling prostitution

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative intent. The purpose of this legislation is to
 strengthen protection for the victims of sex  trafficking,  labor  traf-
 ficking,  compelling  prostitution  and  trafficking in persons, who are
 convicted of a range of offenses as a  result  of  that  trafficking  or
 compelling. New York's landmark law offering the vacating of convictions
 for prostitution-related offenses that were a result of this trafficking
 has  been  the  model for laws in more than half of the states. However,
 several states wisely offer this relief to victims who may be  compelled
 to  participate in other offenses as well. This legislation would follow
 that example. Granting relief under this provision has always been based
 on consideration of the circumstances and the interest of justice;  this
 legislation reiterates that.
  §  2. Paragraph (i) of subdivision 1 of section 440.10 of the criminal
 procedure law, as amended by chapter 629 of the laws of 2021, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (i) The judgment is a conviction where the  defendant's  participation
 in  the  offense was a result of having been a victim of sex trafficking
 under section 230.34 of the penal law, sex trafficking of a child  under
 section  230.34-a  of  the  penal  law,  labor trafficking under section
 135.35 of the penal law,  aggravated  labor  trafficking  under  section
 135.37 of the penal law, compelling prostitution under section 230.33 of
 the  penal  law, or trafficking in persons under the Trafficking Victims
 Protection Act (United States Code, title 22, chapter 78); provided that

 S. 4756  2
 
  (i) official documentation of the defendant's status as  a  victim  of
 sex  trafficking,  labor  trafficking,  aggravated  labor  trafficking,
 compelling prostitution, or trafficking in persons at the  time  of  the
 offense  from a federal, state or local government agency shall create a
 presumption  that  the  defendant's  participation  in the offense was a
 result of having been a victim of sex  trafficking,  labor  trafficking,
 aggravated  labor trafficking, compelling prostitution or trafficking in
 persons, but shall not be required for  granting  a  motion  under  this
 paragraph;
  (ii) a motion under this paragraph, and all pertinent papers and docu-
 ments, shall be confidential and may not be made available to any person
 or  public or private entity except where specifically authorized by the
 court; [and]
  (iii) when a motion is filed under this paragraph, the court may, upon
 the consent of the petitioner and all of the state and local  prosecuto-
 rial agencies that prosecuted each matter, consolidate into one proceed-
 ing  a motion to vacate judgments imposed by distinct or multiple crimi-
 nal courts; AND
  (IV) THE GRANTING OF A MOTION UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE DETERMINED
 BY THE COURT IN CONSIDERATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE  INTEREST  OF
 JUSTICE; or
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
