  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Clause 25 of subparagraph (i) of the opening paragraph of
 section 1210 of the tax law, as amended  by  section  1  of  item  Z  of
 subpart  C  of part XXX of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (25) the county of Monroe is hereby further authorized  and  empowered
 to  adopt  and amend local laws, ordinances or resolutions imposing such
 taxes at a rate which is one percent additional  to  the  three  percent
 rate  authorized above in this paragraph for the period beginning Decem-
 ber first, nineteen hundred ninety-three and ending November  thirtieth,
 two thousand [twenty-three] TWENTY-SIX;
  §  2.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivisions (b) and (c) of
 section 1262 and section 1262-g of the tax law, net collections, as such
 term is defined in section 1262 of the tax law, derived from the imposi-
 tion of sales and compensating use taxes by the county of Monroe at  the

 and ninety and three-quarters percent to the city of Rochester and coun-
 ty of Monroe. The amount of the ninety and three-quarters percent to  be
 distributed  and allocated to the city of Rochester and county of Monroe
 shall  be  distributed  and allocated to each so that the combined total
 distribution and allocation to each from the sales tax revenues pursuant
 to sections 1262 and 1262-g of the tax law and this section shall result
 in the same total amount being distributed and allocated to the city  of
 Rochester  and county of Monroe. The amount so distributed and allocated
 to the county shall be used for  county  purposes.  The  foregoing  cash
 payments  to the school districts shall be allocated on the basis of the
 enrolled public school pupils as such term is used in subdivision (b) of
 section 1262 of the tax law, residing in the county of Monroe. The  cash
 payments to the towns located within the county of Monroe shall be allo-
 cated  on  the  basis  of  the  ratio which the population of each town,
 exclusive of the population of any village or  portion  thereof  located
 within  a town, bears to the total population of the towns, exclusive of
 the population of the villages  located  within  such  towns.  The  cash
 payments to the villages located within the county shall be allocated on
 the basis of the ratio which the population of each village bears to the
 total  population  of  the  villages located within the county. The term
 population as used in this section shall have the same meaning  as  used
 in subdivision (b) of section 1262 of the tax law.
  §  3.  The  net  collections  resulting  from the additional sales and
 compensating use taxes, as authorized by this act, shall not be included
 in determining a sales tax increase or decrease as defined in paragraphs
 (c) and (d) of subdivision 1 of section 1262-g of the tax law.
  § 4. Severability. If any clause,  sentence,  paragraph,  section,  or
 item  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdic-
 tion to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate
 the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in  its  operation  to  the
 clause,  sentence,  paragraph, section or item thereof directly involved
 in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
