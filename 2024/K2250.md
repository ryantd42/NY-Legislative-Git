  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 5, 2024, as  Ostomy  Awareness  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 5, 2024, as Ostomy
Awareness Day in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of World Ostomy Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year  on  the  first  Saturday  of  October,  people
worldwide come together to celebrate World Ostomy  Day,  also  known  as
Ostomy  Awareness  Day; this day serves as a reminder of the resilience,
strength, and courage millions of individuals display each  year  living
with an ostomy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ostomy  Awareness  Day  is a day to raise awareness, break
stigmas, and empower those  living  with  ostomies  to  lead  fulfilling
lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ostomy surgery is a procedure that creates an opening, also
known  as a stoma, in the abdomen; waste products are then expelled from
the body into an external pouch called an ostomy bag;  this  surgery  is
often  necessary  for  individuals  who have had their colon, rectum, or
bladder removed due to  medical  conditions  such  as  Crohn's  disease,
ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer, or bladder cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Living  with an ostomy can be challenging, both physically
and emotionally; individuals with ostomies often face a range of issues,
including: body image concerns, dietary adjustments,  skin  irritations,
and  emotional and psychological impact such as depression, anxiety, and
social isolation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The reaction to intestinal  or  urinary  diversion  surgery
varies  from one individual to the other; to some, it will be a problem,
to others, a challenge;  where  one  person  considers  it  life-saving,
another  finds  it  a  devastating experience; each person will adapt or
adjust in their own way and in their own time; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 5, 2024, as Ostomy
Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
