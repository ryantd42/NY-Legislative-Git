  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 17, 2024, as  Sanitation  Workers  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the conviction of this Legislative Body that those
individuals who faithfully serve the needs  of  the  community  and  its
citizens  with  steadfast  dedication  and  compassionate  commitment
profoundly strengthen our shared  commitment  to  family  and  community
life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is, furthermore, the practice of this Legislative Body
to recognize the efforts of essential workers who,  in  providing  vital
services and support to people in the communities across New York State,
serve to enhance the quality of life for our residents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  17,  2024,  as
Sanitation Workers Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sanitation  Workers  Day  is  a  day  set  aside  to  show
appreciation  to  all the sanitation workers whose efforts may have gone
unnoticed during the COVID-19 pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sanitation workers are among the high-risk  occupations  in
New  York  State  which  include:  Police,  First  Responders, Municipal
workers, Supermarket  workers  and  other  essential  retail  personnel,
Healthcare workers, Delivery Services, Private and Public Sector Unions,
Truck Drivers, Postal Workers, National Guard and Reservists, Educators,
Utility  Workers,  Elder  Care  Services,  Transit System, Manufacturing
Industry, Human Services Providers, and Food Banks; and
 
  WHEREAS, While others were safely under quarantine, these loyal  and
dependable  public  servants  continued  to  work  and provide essential
services to the residents of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Understanding  the  risks  involved,  Sanitation  Workers
perform  their  duties  with tireless devotion and commitment; they have
been vital during the COVID-19 pandemic, with additional dangers such as
vehicles not following road safety rules, as well  as  the  disposal  of
dangerous unsanitary trash which is more necessary than ever; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Employers  as  well as New Yorkers across the State should
celebrate Sanitation Workers Day by taking a moment to  just  say  thank
you to the sanitation workers in their community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their
profession,  certainly  have  earned the recognition and applause of all
the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  17,  2024,  as
Sanitation Workers Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
