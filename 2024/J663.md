arduous field of fire protection and prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chief Dennis Fields has consistently demonstrated  a  level
of  commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and professionalism which truly
exemplifies the mission of the Oneida Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dennis Fields began his life of  public  service  in  1991,
with  the  Griffiss  Air  Force  Base Fire Department before joining the
Oneida Fire Department five years later in December of 1996; through the
years, he climbed the ranks  to  become  Chief  in  2018,  the  esteemed
position from which he will officially retire in May of 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout his illustrious tenure, Chief Dennis Fields was
instrumental in fighting some of the city's largest fires, including the
Stanton Paper Box Co. fire, the CSX Transportation train derailment  and
explosion, and the City Lanes fire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  in  recognition of his heroic acts in saving

  WHEREAS,  Chief Dennis Fields is the epitome of the phrase "Living a
Life of Service"; the City and its Fire Department owe the Chief a  debt
 
of  gratitude  that  can  never  be  repaid,  nor will his distinguished
service ever be forgotten; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
