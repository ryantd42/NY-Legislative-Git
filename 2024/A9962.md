 AN  ACT in relation to the issuance of retirement service identification
  cards to auxiliary police officers
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  For  the purposes of this act, "auxiliary police officer"
 shall mean a member of an auxiliary police  organization  authorized  by
 local law.
  §  2.  (a) Any person serving or who has served as an auxiliary police
 officer in an auxiliary police organization in a municipality, including
 a city having a population of one million  or  more  persons,  that  has
 authorized  the  formation  of  an  auxiliary police force providing for
 voluntary participation by auxiliary police  officers  in  a  local  law
 enforcement agency shall be entitled to a retirement service identifica-
 tion  card  as provided in this act. Such retirement service identifica-
 tion card shall be issued by the entity that issues  the  identification
 card carried by the auxiliary police officer during such officer's peri-
 od of service.
  (b)  A  retirement  service  identification card shall be issued to an
 auxiliary police officer upon such officer's retirement from the  auxil-
 iary police force provided such officer:
  (i)  served  as  an  auxiliary  police officer in good standing for at
 least ten years prior to retirement; or
  (ii) retired as a result of an injury that occurred in the  course  of
 the auxiliary police officer's duties for the law enforcement agency and
 which  rendered  the  auxiliary  police  officer  permanently  unable to
 continue service as an auxiliary police officer.
  (c) A retirement service card issued pursuant to this act shall  state
 the name of the retired auxiliary police officer, identify the holder of
 the card as a retired auxiliary police officer for the appropriate local
 law  enforcement  agency, and indicate the years the holder served as an
 auxiliary police officer. The retirement service card shall  also  thank
 the retired auxiliary police officer for the officer's service.

  (d)  The cost of a retirement service card issued pursuant to this act
 shall be borne by the local law enforcement agency the auxiliary  police
 officer  served  with;  provided  that  if  the auxiliary police officer
 served with two or more local law enforcement agencies, the cost of  the
 retirement  service  card  shall be divided equally between or among the
 local law enforcement agencies, unless otherwise agreed by the agencies.
  § 3. Nothing in this act shall be construed to grant any pension bene-
 fits, entitlement to pension benefits or enrollment in any pension plans
 for retired auxiliary police officers.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
