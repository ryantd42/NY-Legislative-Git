 a  law  enforcement  officer  in  the performance of his official duties
 shall, while in or on a motor vehicle, use  a  jacklight,  spotlight  or
 other  artificial  light upon lands inhabited by deer if he or she is in
 possession or is accompanied by a person who is in  possession,  at  the
 time  of  such  use,  of  a  longbow, crossbow or a firearm of any kind,
