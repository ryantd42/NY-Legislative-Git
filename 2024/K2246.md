  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  the  month  of  May  2024,  as  Williams  Syndrome
  Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim the month of  May  2024,  as  Williams
Syndrome Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Williams  Syndrome  (WS) is a genetic condition present at
birth that can affect anyone and is  characterized  by  medical  issues,
including  cardiovascular  disease,  developmental  delays, and learning
disabilities; these medical conditions often occur  side  by  side  with
striking  verbal  abilities, highly social personalities and an affinity
for music; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is estimated that Williams Syndrome impacts one in every
10,000 people worldwide, including as  many  as  30,000  in  the  United
States;  it  is  known to occur equally in both males and females and in
every culture; and
 
  WHEREAS, As children with Williams Syndrome grow, many struggle with
things like spatial relations, numbers, and  abstract  reasoning,  which
can make daily tasks a challenge; and
 
  WHEREAS, In adulthood, individuals with Williams Syndrome will often
need  supportive  housing  and  other  resources  to reach their fullest
potential; with these supports, they can  contribute  greatly  to  their
communities as volunteers or paid employees in a wide variety of fields;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Twelve years ago, Camille Fortunato, as a parent of a child
with  Williams  Syndrome,  began a quest for appropriate educational and
therapeutic services for her son, Anthony; and
 
  WHEREAS, Her son Anthony was very ill when he was born, but  doctors
were  initially  unable  to determine what the underlying issue was; she
and her husband Stefano Filippazzo took Anthony  to  see  cardiologists,
pulmonologists  and  critical  care  physicians;  it  took  years  of
excruciating searching to finally  find  the  diagnosis  for  this  rare
disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  receiving  Anthony's diagnosis, his parents embarked
upon a commendable pursuit  to  raise  awareness  and  capital  for  the
Williams  Syndrome  Association  (WSA);  over  the  years,  they  have
participated in a variety of very successful fundraising events; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1982, the Williams Syndrome Association provides
support  to  individuals  with  Williams  Syndrome,  as  well  as  their
 
families,  connecting  them with professionals and others who can assist
them in coping with the condition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  this  organization's efforts, from raising public
awareness, to funding critical  new  research,  and  providing  valuable
information  and  support to families, the Williams Syndrome Association
has improved the quality of  life  and  futures  of  those  affected  by
Williams Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Williams Syndrome Association, along with the families
and friends of those with Williams Syndrome, are  to  be  commended  for
their hard work, compassion, and dedication to educating the state about
this rare disorder; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim the month of May 2024,  as
Williams  Syndrome  Awareness  Month in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
