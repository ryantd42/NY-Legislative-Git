 APPROVED,  HOWEVER, UNLESS THE MEMBER OR SOME OTHER PERSON ON HIS OR HER
 BEHALF SHALL HAVE FILED WRITTEN NOTICE IN THE OFFICE OF THE  COMPTROLLER
 WITHIN NINETY DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT, SETTING FORTH:

  (D) HIS OR HER ALLEGED INCAPACITY.
  2. THE NOTICE HEREIN REQUIRED NEED NOT BE GIVEN:
  (A)  IF  THE NOTICE OF SUCH ACCIDENT SHALL BE FILED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THE PROVISIONS OF THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION  LAW  OF  ANY  STATE  WITHIN
 WHICH A PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER IN NASSAU COUNTY SHALL HAVE ITS EMPLOYEES

 JULY TWENTY-SEVENTH, NINETEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX.
  § 2. All costs associated with implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by Nassau county.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would establish an improved  accidental  disability  benefit
 for  eligible members of the New York State and Local Employees' Retire-
 ment System in Tiers 3 through 6 who are employed by  Nassau  County  as
 deputy sheriffs. The improved disability benefit would be three-quarters
 of final average salary less workers' compensation. The current disabil-
 ity  benefit is two-thirds of final average salary less workers' compen-
 sation.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of  approximately  $14,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of Nassau County for the fiscal year ending March
 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates  and
 salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $62,800 which will be
 borne by Nassau County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
 S. 5254  3
 
  These estimated costs are based on 56  affected  members  employed  by
 Nassau  County,  with  annual salary of approximately $6.2 million as of
 March 31, 2022.
