  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
individuals  of  true  purpose  and  worthy  accomplishment  who  work
diligently to preserve and celebrate their rich cultural heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to

Parade on Saturday, March 16, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  tradition  of  the  Utica St. Patrick's Day Parade is
steeped in 200 years of history, with John C. Devereux leading the first
march down the Historic Brewery and Arts District of Utica;  today,  the
Utica  Parade  draws  around  30,000 spectators, as about 5,000 marchers
from across the state step off from Oneida  Square  and  head  north  to
Genesee Street; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  committee  for  this  year's  Utica,  New  York,  St.
Patrick's Day Parade designated Mike Hoke as one of the highly  esteemed
Grand  Marshals  in  recognition  of  his  devotion  and passion for the
preservation and celebration of Irish culture in his community; and
 
  WHEREAS, A long time contributor to the Irish community,  Mike  Hoke
is  a  head  of  the Irish Cultural Center alongside wife Chris Hoke, in
which  they  create,  attract,  and  schedule  Irish  cultural  events,
lectures,  presentations,  and  performances that promote Irish heritage
and educate the community concerning the impact and contributions of the
Irish people in the greater Utica area and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS, A testament to their  resilience  and  ambition,  Mike  and
Chris  Hoke  started the Irish Cultural Center with an empty room and no
funding and assembled a planning team, raised  funding,  acquired  sound
and  visual  equipment,  and  booked speakers and performers to ensure a
continuous series throughout the year, all while facing the  constraints
imposed by a world-wide pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  putting  together  an  Irish cultural and educational
series that engaged and attracted both presenters and attendees from  as
far  away  as  Ireland,  the  inaugural Matthew T. Sullivan Irish Spirit
Award was given to Mike Hoke in 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mike Hoke  has  worked  for  the  Craobh  Dugan  branch  of
Comholtas  Ceoltoiri Eireann for almost 45 years, having joined in 1980;

Region Hall of Fame; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, Mike Hoke is a long-time and respected fiddle player, still
teaching  students  every  week,  as  well  as introducing young and new
musicians to the style of music; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mike  and  Chris  Hoke  lead  several  trad  sessions  and
performances each month throughout the Utica area, and they also host an
Irish picnic at their home every August; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The two Grand Marshals have also been representatives from
the Craobh Dugan O'Looney branch for the annual North America  Comhaltas
Ceoltoiri Eireann CCE conventions; serving as President and Treasurer of
their  local  branch,  Mike and Chris Hoke have supplied funds from dues
and performances to members to travel to North American CCE meetings, as
well as attend various music and dance workshops; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mike Hoke serves proudly as the Treasurer of the  Comhaltas
Ceoltoiri  Eireann  Northeast  Regional  Board, and the Secretary of the
Provincial Board; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Mike Hoke upon the occasion of his designation as Grand  Marshal
of the 2024 Utica St. Patrick's Day Parade; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
