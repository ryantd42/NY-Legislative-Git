  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 2024, as Healthy Skin Month in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as  Healthy
Skin  Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National Healthy Skin Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sponsored by the American Academy of Dermatology,  National
Healthy  Skin Month is observed each November to bring awareness to what
it takes to keep your skin healthy, as  well  as  understanding  how  to
treat and prevent common skin problems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Your  skin  is your body's largest organ and reveals a lot
about your overall health; National Healthy Skin Month stresses  how  to
correctly  use  sunscreen  and  offers helpful tips on how to check your
skin periodically to prevent skin cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the 1990s, marketing campaigns pushed UVA protection
and promoted sunscreens with UVA protection against cancer and premature
aging; and
 
  WHEREAS, Stress  makes  your  skin  break  out  and  can  make  skin
conditions like psoriasis much worse; it is important to get enough rest
and to exercise in the fresh air; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hydrating  your  entire  body by drinking eight glasses of
water daily is another way to moisturize your precious skin; add  lemons
and  other  fruit  to make your daily drinks even more refreshing; water
clears out the dangerous toxins that hurt your skin; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since November is National Healthy Skin Month, winter is an
especially good time to check yourself carefully for spots with  unusual
shapes  or  colors  that might indicate skin cancer; look for moles that
seem to appear; furthermore, people  with  darker  complexions  are  not
exempt  from  skin  cancer;  although  skin irregularities are not often
apparent on darker skin, people with darker skin tend to die more  often
from skin cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as  Healthy
Skin Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
