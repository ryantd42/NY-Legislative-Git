  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 13-19, 2024, as Home  Fire  Sprinkler  Awareness
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues  that affect the safety and health of citizens of New York State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 13-19, 2024,  as  Home
Fire  Sprinkler  Awareness Week in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of National Home Fire Sprinkler Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2017, 142 civilians died in New  York  State  from  home
fires, more than any other state in the nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to the composition of today's construction material and
furniture,  a  home  fire  has  the potential to produce toxic fumes and
become deadly in less than two minutes, the after effects of  which  are
life-changing; and
 
  WHEREAS, While residents should feel safe in their homes, it is also
where they have the greatest risk of injury or death from fire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Home fires also put the health of our firefighters at risk
through exposure to airborne toxins and carcinogenic materials that  can
cause  serious,  long-term  health  problems  for  firefighters  and,
potentially, their families; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Fire Services' promotion of smoke alarms
and other fire prevention methods have already  helped  to  reduce  fire
deaths; and
 
  WHEREAS, All New York residents are encouraged to educate themselves
about  the dangers of home fires, the unparalleled benefits of home fire
sprinklers, and to embrace this technology in all newly built homes; and
 
  WHEREAS, Combined with working smoke alarms and proper  fire  escape
planning, fire sprinklers in all new homes can reverse the deadly impact
of home fires; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  taking  part  in  a  national  week  of action, let us
recognize that protecting newly built homes with  fire  sprinklers  will
make  our  future  safer  for  residents,  first  responders, and entire
communities for generations to come; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 13-19, 2024, as Home
Fire Sprinkler Awareness Week in the State of New York,  in  conjunction
with  the observance of National Home Fire Sprinkler Awareness Week; and
be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of  the Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
