 REQUEST,  BE  ISSUED A LICENSE PLATE BEARING THE LETTERS "S.P.C.A". IF A
 DISTINCTIVE PLATE IS ISSUED TO ANY SUCH MEMBER PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION,
 SUCH A DISTINCTIVE PLATE SHALL NOT BE  ISSUED  TO  THE  SPOUSE  OF  SUCH
 MEMBER.  APPLICATION  FOR  SUCH  LICENSE  PLATE  SHALL BE FILED WITH THE
 COMMISSIONER  IN  SUCH  FORM  AND  DETAIL  AS  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL
 PRESCRIBE, AND SHALL BE VERIFIED ANNUALLY BY THE APPLICANT.
  2. THE DISTINCTIVE PLATE AUTHORIZED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL  BE  ISSUED UPON PROOF, SATISFACTORY TO THE COMMISSIONER, THAT THE
 APPLICANT OR THE SPOUSE OF THE APPLICANT IS PRESENTLY A SOCIETY FOR  THE
 PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS OFFICERS.
  3. A DISTINCTIVE PLATE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE ISSUED
 IN  THE  SAME  MANNER AS OTHER NUMBER PLATES UPON PAYMENT OF THE REGULAR
 REGISTRATION FEE PRESCRIBED BY SECTION FOUR HUNDRED ONE OF THIS  ARTICLE
 AND AN INITIAL ONE TIME SERVICE CHARGE OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS.
  §  2. 1. A distinctive plate established pursuant to section 404-ff of
 the vehicle and traffic law shall only be designed, produced and  issued
 upon  the  delivery to the department of motor vehicles of a surety bond
 in the amount of $6,000, which shall be executed  by  a  surety  company

 in this state.  Provided, however, that if  the  commissioner  of  motor
 vehicles shall have received prior to plate design, production and issu-
 ance  at  least  200 orders for such distinctive plate together with the
 additional annual service charge applicable to each  such  order,  which
 shall  be  non-refundable,  no  such  surety bond shall be required. All
 service charges collected pursuant to this section  shall  be  deposited
 pursuant  to the provisions of section 404-oo of the vehicle and traffic
 law to the credit of the department of motor vehicles distinctive  plate
 development  fund  established  by section 95-g of the state finance law
 and shall be used for the design, production, advertising  and  distrib-
 ution  of  distinctive  license  plates  in accordance with such section
 95-g.
  2. If, upon the expiration of two years following the date upon  which
 distinctive  plates  in  the series are first available for sale, 200 or
 more sets of such plates are sold, a bond  delivered  pursuant  to  this
 section shall be discontinued. If fewer than 200 sets of such plates are
 sold by such time, the department of motor vehicles shall be entitled to
 recover against the bond in an amount proportionate to such shortfall.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
