  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 21, 2024, as Onion Appreciation  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  agricultural  industry  of  the  State of New York is
highly benefited by  the  active  promotion  of  farming  endeavors  and
agricultural products; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim August 21, 2024, as Onion Appreciation
Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 21st day in  August  of  every  year  is  the  official
commencement  date  of  onion harvest season in this great Empire State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The nutritional value of onions  have  been  held  in  high
esteem  throughout  recorded  history,  having been used in nearly every
cuisine around the globe; and
 
  WHEREAS, Perceived to be one of the oldest known vegetables,  onions
are  among  the  first  cultivated crops, are easy to grow, do well in a
wide range of soils and climates, are less perishable  than  many  other
vegetables,  and  have  grown wild in many regions throughout the world;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Food historians estimate man has  been  cultivating  onions
for  approximately  5,000  years;  it  is  also  estimated our ancestors
feasted on wild onions for thousands of years before the  inventions  of
farming and writing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Onions  have  numerous  medicinal  purposes, some of which
include  the  treatment  of  coughs,  colds,  wounds,  ulcers,  and
hypertension; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Modern  research  supports  a  surprising array of ancient
allium-related health claims; according to  researchers  in  the  United
States and India, onions also kill the germs that cause tooth decay; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  absolute  asset to society, onions contain at least 25
identified active disease combating compounds that, like garlic, possess
antibacterial, antifungal, and immune  enhancing  properties  which  may
explain  their  efficacy in warding off colds as well as relieving upset
stomachs; they also appear to  lower  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol,
inhibit  growth  of  cancer  cells,  reduce  stroke  risk, and assist in
preventing heart disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, All of our Nation's farmers, particularly the onion farmers
of the  State  of  New  York,  deserve  the  recognition,  support,  and
appreciation  of  all  the  citizens  of  this  great Empire State; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim August 21, 2024, as Onion
Appreciation Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
