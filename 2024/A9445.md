 sentative sample of local educational agencies. Such determination shall

 OTHER DATA REASONABLY REQUIRED BY THE COMMISSIONER RELATED TO SAFETY.
  B.  EACH  PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL DESIGNATED AS PERSIS-
 TENTLY DANGEROUS PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH A OF THIS SUBDIVISION  SHALL,  IN
 THE  SUBSEQUENT  SCHOOL  YEAR,  SUBMIT  TO  THE COMMISSIONER AN INCIDENT
 REDUCTION PLAN DETAILING THE STEPS THE SCHOOL WILL TAKE TO REDUCE  INCI-
 DENTS  OF  VIOLENCE AND DISRUPTION AND REMOVE THE PERSISTENTLY DANGEROUS
 DESIGNATION BY THE FOLLOWING SCHOOL YEAR. SUCH PLAN SHALL INCLUDE, AT  A
 MINIMUM, THE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES RECOMMENDED PURSUANT
 TO  PARAGRAPH C OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION TWENTY-EIGHT HUNDRED ONE-A
 OF THIS ARTICLE. NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  PROVISION  TO  THE  CONTRARY,  AN
 ELEMENTARY OR SECONDARY SCHOOL DESIGNATED AS PERSISTENTLY DANGEROUS, AND
 WHICH  REMAINS  ON THE PERSISTENTLY DANGEROUS LIST FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE
 YEARS, SHALL BE SUBJECT TO CLOSURE ON JUNE THIRTIETH FOLLOWING THE THIRD
 CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF SUCH PERSISTENTLY DANGEROUS DESIGNATION EXCEPT  THAT
 UPON  A FINDING OF GOOD CAUSE, THE COMMISSIONER MAY GRANT SUCH SCHOOL UP
 TO TWO ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC YEARS TO ACHIEVE RESULTS  THAT  WOULD  REMOVE
 THE PERSISTENTLY DANGEROUS DESIGNATION.
  [b] C. Each local educational agency required to provide unsafe school
 choice  shall establish procedures for determinations by the superinten-
 dent of schools or other chief school officer of whether  a  student  is
 the  victim  of HARASSMENT, BULLYING, OR a violent criminal offense that
 occurred on school grounds of the school that the student attends.  Such
 superintendent  of schools or other chief school officer shall, prior to
 making any such determination, consult with any law  enforcement  agency
 investigating  such  alleged  violent  criminal offense and consider any
 reports or records provided by such agency. The  trustees  or  board  of
 education  or  other  governing  board of a local educational agency may
 provide, by local rule or by-law, for appeal of the determination of the
 superintendent of schools to such governing board.  Notwithstanding  any
 other  provision of law to the contrary, the determination of such chief
 school officer pursuant to this  paragraph  shall  not  have  collateral
 estoppel  effect  in any student disciplinary proceeding brought against
 the alleged victim or perpetrator of such violent criminal offense.  For
 purposes  of  this  subdivision, "violent criminal offense" shall mean a
 crime that involved infliction of serious physical injury  upon  another

 compulsion or any other offense defined in the penal law  that  involved
 the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon.

 of section eighty-one hundred one of the Elementary and Secondary Educa-
 tion Act of nineteen hundred sixty-five, as amended, that is required to
 provide school choice pursuant to section eighty-five hundred thirty-two
 of the Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  Act  of  nineteen  hundred
 sixty-five,  as  amended, shall establish procedures for notification of
 parents of, or persons  in  parental  relation  to,  students  attending
 schools  that have been designated as persistently dangerous and parents
 of, or persons in parental relation to,  students  who  are  victims  of
 HARASSMENT,  BULLYING,  OR  violent  criminal offenses of their right to
 transfer to a safe public school within the [local  educational  agency]
 SCHOOL  DISTRICT  and procedures for such transfer[, except that nothing
 in this subdivision shall be  construed  to  require  such  notification
 where  there  are  no  other public schools within the local educational
 agency at the same grade level or such transfer to a safe public  school
 within  the  local  educational  agency  is  otherwise  impossible or to
 require a local educational agency that has only one public school with-

 in the local educational agency or only one public school at each  grade
 level to develop such procedures].  SUCH NOTIFICATION SHALL ALSO INCLUDE
 A  LIST  OF DESIGNATED SAFE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO
 WHICH  THE  STUDENT MAY TRANSFER, TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE, BE PROVIDED
 IN THE DOMINANT LANGUAGE AND MODE OF COMMUNICATION  OF  PARENTS  OF,  OR
 PERSONS IN PARENTAL RELATION TO, SUCH STUDENTS, AND BE PROVIDED NO LATER
 THAN  TEN  DAYS  AFTER  SUCH  SCHOOL HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS PERSISTENTLY
 DANGEROUS, OR FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT, BULLYING, OR A
 VIOLENT CRIMINAL OFFENSE, WITHIN  TWENTY-FOUR  HOURS  OF  SUCH  DETERMI-
 NATION.  IF  THERE ARE NO SAFE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
 AT THE SAME GRADE LEVEL, THE NOTIFICATION OF THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER SHALL
 INCLUDE AN OFFER OF ASSISTANCE IN PURSUING OPTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL
 DISTRICT. The commissioner shall be authorized to adopt any  regulations
 deemed necessary to assure that local educational agencies implement the
 provisions of this subdivision.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
