  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January  2024,  as  Slavery  and  Human  Trafficking
  Prevention Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2024, as Slavery
and Human Trafficking Prevention Month in the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National  Slavery  and  Human
Trafficking Prevention Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, First declared as Slavery and Human Trafficking  Prevention
Month in 2010, January has been a time to acknowledge those experiencing
enslavement  and  those  who  have escaped; although slavery is commonly
thought to be a thing of the past, human traffickers  generate  hundreds
of  billions  of  dollars  in  profits by trapping millions of people in
horrific situations around the world and can target our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Traffickers use violence, threats, deception, debt bondage,
and other manipulative tactics to force people to engage  in  commercial
sex  or  to  provide  labor  or  services against their will; preying on
victims with little or no  social  safety  net,  they  look  to  exploit
victims  for  cheap  labor  by  preying  on  individuals  in  vulnerable
situations  due  to  economic  hardship,  illegal  immigration  status,
political  instability,  natural disasters, their age, and other causes;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of this important topic, the National  Child
Traumatic  Stress  Network  (NCTSN) has compiled a list of resources for
children, teens, parents and caregivers, educators,  child  welfare  and
juvenile  justice  professionals,  and  mental  health  providers  for
communities to become more  aware  of  how  to  protect  themselves  and
others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  number of sexual and labor trafficking cases reported
each year continues to grow as more light  is  given  to  the  issue  by
various  actors  in  New  York, across the United States, and around the
globe; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Slavery  and  Human  Trafficking  Prevention  Month  was
implemented  to  raise awareness amongst the Nation that the enslavement
of individuals through human trafficking does not just happen  far  away
in  other  countries,  but  in  states and communities across the United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this serious issue, and more must be done to eradicate slavery and human
trafficking  at the local, state and national levels; now, therefore, be
it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2024,  as  Slavery
and  Human Trafficking Prevention Month in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
