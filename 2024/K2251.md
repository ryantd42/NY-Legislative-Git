  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 15,  2024,  as  Pregnancy  and  Infant  Loss
  Remembrance Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  October  15,  2024,  as
Pregnancy  and  Infant Loss Remembrance Day in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance  of  World  Pregnancy  and  Infant  Loss
Remembrance Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pregnancy  and  Infant  Loss  Remembrance  Day is a day of
remembrance for pregnancy loss and infant death, which includes, however
is not limited to, miscarriage, stillbirth, SIDS, and  the  death  of  a
newborn; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pregnancy  and  Infant Loss Remembrance Day is observed on
October 15th of each year in  Canada,  United  States,  United  Kingdom,
Australia,  New  South  Wales,  New  Zealand,  Italy,  Ireland, Denmark,
France, Norway, Kenya, Latin America, Central  America,  South  America,
Russia,  Germany,  South  Africa, Japan, China and Kyrgyzstan, with more
countries joining in observation each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, This auspicious day is observed with remembrance ceremonies
and  candle-lighting  vigils,  concluding  with  the  Lights  of  Love
International  Wave  of  Light,  a  worldwide  lighting  of  candles and
campaign illuminations which circumnavigate the globe beginning at  7:00
p.m. in each respective time zone; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, the official awareness colors of the cause are
light  pink  and  baby  blue,  and  are  synonymous  with the campaign's
awareness ribbon; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tens of thousands of families across the United States  are
devastated  each  year  by  the  death of a baby, yet the grief of these
families  and  the  value  of  their  babies'  lives  are  very  rarely
acknowledged; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1988,  United  States President Ronald Reagan declared
October as a month to recognize the unique grief of bereaved parents  in
an  effort to demonstrate support to the many families who have suffered
such a tragic loss; and
 
  WHEREAS, Promoting awareness of pregnancy and infant loss  not  only
increases  the  likelihood  that  grieving  families  will  receive
understanding and support, but also results in  improved  education  and
prevention  efforts  which  may ultimately reduce the incidence of these
tragedies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally,  October's  NeverBeStill  campaign  seeks  to
break  the  silence  surrounding  stillbirth  and other pregnancy/infant
losses by not only educating the public about ways to  support  bereaved
families  but  also  empowering  expectant  mothers  to  have  a healthy
pregnancy; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is a great tragedy to lose the life of a child; even the
shortest  lives are still valuable, and the grief of those who mourn the
loss of these lives should not be trivialized; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October 15, 2024, as
Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day in the State of New York;  and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
