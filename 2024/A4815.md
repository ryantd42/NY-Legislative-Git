 AN ACT to amend the social  services  law  and  the  education  law,  in
  relation  to  the  provision of universal child care; to amend chapter
  493 of the laws of 2017 amending the social services law  relating  to
  establishing  a child care availability taskforce to evaluate the need
  for and availability of child care throughout the state,  in  relation
  to  the  effectiveness  thereof;  to  amend  the state finance law, in
  relation to establishing certain funds to provide for  the  establish-
  ment and funding of universal child care; to repeal certain provisions

  ation therefor
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "universal child care act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds  and  declares
 that New York State's child care sector is facing an economic crisis. In
 2018,  the  legislature created a Child Care Availability Task Force. In
 2021, that Task Force issued its final report, finding that the  current
 crisis  "requires  a  dramatically different approach to child care: one
 that recognizes that high-quality child care is a public good  and  that
 provides the necessary public investment" to implement a system of high-
 quality  universal  child  care.  This  legislation  will  move New York
 towards such a dramatically new system, where  child  care  workers  are
 treated  with  dignity  and compensated generously as the educators that
 they are, where child care is free and available to all  just  like  our

 public  education system is free and available for all, where burdensome
 and ineffective means-testing requirements  are  ultimately  eliminated,
 where  public  investments are directed towards those most in need as we
 build out our important child care infrastructure, where families have a
 meaningful  ability  to  select  the modalities that work best for their
 children, where child care providers are not forced to  compete  against
 each other, where high-quality is ensured for all so that we do not have
 a  two-tiered child care system where the wealthy have high-quality care
 and the working poor have substandard care, where both federal and state
 funding is allocated generously, where the burden on localities is mini-
 mized, and where our child care system is truly universal.
  § 3. Section 390-k of the social services law, as added by chapter 493
 of the laws of 2017, subdivisions 2 and 4 as amended by chapter  797  of

 OBLIGATED,  provided funds have been made available therefor, to provide
 day care at public expense for children residing in his OR HER territory
 [who are eligible therefor pursuant to provisions of this title.  Such
 care  may be provided only in cases where it is determined, under crite-
 ria established by the department, that there is a need therefor because
 of inability of the parents  to  provide  care  and  supervision  for  a
 substantial  part  of the day and that such care is in the best interest
 of the child and parent.  Where the family is able to pay part or all of
 the costs of such care, payment of such fees as may be reasonable in the
 light of such ability shall be required] WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING  FREE
 AND UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE FOR ALL FAMILIES WITHIN SUCH TERRITORY.
  §  6.  Subdivision  2  of section 410-b of the social services law, as

 DUTY AS AGENT OF THE STATE, THE OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND  FAMILY  SERVICES
 SHALL  SEEK  TO  OBTAIN ANY WAIVERS OR PERMISSIONS FROM FEDERAL AGENCIES
 NECESSARY AND PROPER TO ALLOW THE STATE AND ITS VARIOUS SUBDIVISIONS  TO
 IMPLEMENT A CHILD CARE SYSTEM THAT IS UNIVERSAL AND FREE AT THE POINT OF
 SERVICE,  NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE STATE'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM MAY BE MORE
 EXPANSIVE THAN WHAT IS BEING REIMBURSED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS.
  5. TO THE EXTENT THAT FEDERAL FUNDS ARE OFFERED FOR CHILD CARE AND ARE
 CONTINGENT ON MATCHING FUNDS FROM THE STATE, THE STATE  SHALL  MAKE  ALL
 REASONABLE EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE THE ALLOCATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS BY MAKING
 SUFFICIENT STATE-LEVEL APPROPRIATIONS.

 subdivision  in  awarding grants. Plans may be submitted by private not-
 for-profit corporations, organizations or governmental subdivisions.

 A. 4815  8

 services, or that implements the process for closing child care cases as
 set forth in the district's approved child and family services plan, due
 to the district determining that it cannot maintain its current caseload
 because  all  of the available funds are projected to be needed for open
 cases, shall provide all  families  whose  eligibility  for  child  care
 assistance  or  family  share percentage will be impacted by such action

 criteria established by the office of children and family services, that
 there  is a need and that such care is in the best interest of the child
 A. 4815  9

 law, subdivision 1 as added by chapter 503 of the laws of 1988, subdivi-
 sion 2 as amended by chapter 659 of the laws of  1988,  are  amended  to
 read as follows:
  1.  The  legislature  finds  and  declares that a crisis exists in the
 availability and quality of child day care in New York  state  and  that
 this  crisis  poses a danger both to the welfare and safety of the chil-
 dren and to the productivity of this state's workforce; that  inadequate
 salaries  and  in  many cases nonexistent benefit packages have substan-
 tially contributed to the existing crisis by precluding day care centers
 from recruiting and retaining necessary teaching and supervisory  staff;
 that  an  extremely  high turnover rate has interfered in many instances
 with the ability of day care centers to comply with regulatory  require-
 ments and to properly serve the children in their care; and that because
 of  these  extraordinary circumstances New York state must intervene and
 provide assistance for recruitment and retention of child care  workers,
 WITH THE GOAL OF CREATING A FREE AND UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE SYSTEM THAT IS
 AVAILABLE  TO ALL, IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM, WITH-
 OUT THE BURDENS OF MEANS-TESTING.  The  legislature  recognizes  that  a
 long-term solution to this crisis will require cooperative efforts among
 [the  business  community, local and state governments and families] ALL
 NEW YORKERS.
  2.  Within  amounts  appropriated  specifically  therefor,  and  after
 deducting  funds  as specified in subdivision three of this section, the
 commissioner shall allocate funds to local social services districts for
 grants to [eligible not-for-profit day care centers] CHILD CARE  PROVID-
 ERS for retention and recruitment of teaching and supervisory staff, [as
 follows:
  (a) a city social services district with a population in excess of one
 million  shall  be  allocated  a portion of such funds based on an equal
 weighting of:
  (i) its proportion of the state population of children aged  five  and
 under, and
  (ii)  its proportion of total claims for reimbursement received by the
 department by May thirty-first, nineteen hundred  eighty-eight  for  the
 low income, transitional and teen parent day care programs authorized by
 chapter fifty-three of the laws of nineteen hundred eighty-seven.
 A. 4815  10

  (b)  all other eligible local social services districts shall be allo-
 cated the remaining portion of funds based on  each  district's  propor-
 tionate  share  of licensed not-for-profit day care capacity relative to
 the total capacity of all such other eligible districts] WITH THE AIM OF
 PROVIDING  STAFF WITH SALARY AND BENEFITS THAT IS AT PARITY WITH THAT OF
 LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS IN THE RELEVANT AREA.
  § 16. Subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 410-v  of  the  social  services
 law,  subdivision  1  as added by section 52 of part B of chapter 436 of

 child  care  assistance in each social services district] AIM TO PROVIDE
 UNIVERSAL AND FREE CHILD CARE ON A STATEWIDE BASIS.  Annual  allocations
 shall  be made on a federal fiscal year basis AND SHALL INCORPORATE THE
 ANNUAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CHILD  CARE  TASKFORCE  ESTABLISHED  UNDER
 SECTION THREE HUNDRED NINETY-K OF THIS ARTICLE.
  2.  Reimbursement  under the block grant to a social services district
 for its expenditures for child care assistance shall  be  available  for
 [seventy-five]  NINETY  percent of the district's expenditures for child
 care assistance provided to those families in receipt of public  assist-
 ance  which  are eligible for child care assistance under this title and
 for one hundred percent of the social services  district's  expenditures
 for other eligible families[; provided, however, that such reimbursement
 shall  be  limited  to the social services district's annual state block
 grant allocation]. TO THE EXTENT THAT  FAMILIES  ARE  NOT  ELIGIBLE  FOR
 FUNDING  PURSUANT TO THIS PROVISION, THE STATE SHALL MAKE ALL REASONABLE
 EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERALLY-FUNDED  CHILD
 CARE HAVE ACCESS, PHASED-IN OVER A PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS, PURSUANT TO THE
