 to read as follows:
  (1) Except as provided in paragraph two of this subsection, each claim
 or bill for health care services processed in violation of this  section
 shall  constitute  a  separate  violation.  In addition to the penalties
 provided in this chapter, any insurer  or  organization  or  corporation
 that fails to adhere to the standards contained in this section shall be
 obligated  to  pay  to the health care provider or person submitting the
 claim, in full settlement of the claim or bill for health care services,
 the amount of the claim or health care  payment  plus  interest  on  the
 amount  of  such claim or health care payment of the greater of the rate
 equal to the rate set by the commissioner of taxation  and  finance  for
 corporate  taxes  pursuant to paragraph one of subsection (e) of section
 one thousand ninety-six of the tax law or twelve percent per  annum,  to
 be  computed from the date the claim or health care payment was required
 to be made.  THE SUPERINTENDENT SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO IMPOSE  PENALTIES

 FAILURE  TO ADHERE TO THE STANDARDS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.  FURTHER-
 MORE, THE SUPERINTENDENT SHALL BE AUTHORIZED  TO  DOUBLE  THE  PENALTIES
 AUTHORIZED  UNDER THIS CHAPTER WHERE IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE INSURER

 tion or corporation shall not be required to pay interest on such claim.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law, and apply to all health care claims  submitted  after
 such  date. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal
 of any rule or regulation necessary for the implementation of  this  act
