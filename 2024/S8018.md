 annual  premium  due  for  a  policy,  without first making a good faith

 third-party database. An insurer also shall verify, through a third-par-
 ty  database,  the NEW YORK STATE driving history of a named driver used
 to rate the policy when added during the policy period [and shall verify
 the driving history of all drivers used to rate  the  policy  at  policy
 renewal],  unless  the  NEW YORK STATE driving history is unavailable at
 the time of the initial inquiry  due  to  a  temporary  website  outage,
 service  interruption  or  other circumstances beyond the control of the
 insurer, producer or third-party representative.
