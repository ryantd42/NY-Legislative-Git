 Introduced  by  COMMITTEE  ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. L. Rosen-
  thal) -- read once and referred  to  the  Committee  on  Environmental
  Conservation
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  environmental  conservation law, in relation to
  prohibiting the breeding,  sale,  trade,  purchase,  importation,  and
  exportation of red-eared slider turtles

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. 1. New York is  a  significant  partic-
 ipant  in the global marketplace for the red-eared slider turtle, one of
 the world's 100 most invasive species, according  to  the  International
 Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
  2. Though native only in U.S. southern states, the red-eared slider is
 now  considered invasive on every continent except Antarctica due to the
 global pet trade.
  3. Because red-eared sliders can live up to 40 years in captivity  and
 will  continue  to  grow during that time, pet owners often release them
 into the wild, or the turtles escape enclosures, which has  led  to  the
 national and international proliferation of the species.
  4. Due to their long life, resistance to disease, and voracious forag-
 ing,  red-eared  sliders  outcompete other species, disrupt habitats and
 pose a grave threat to biodiversity wherever they reside  outside  their
 natural range.
  5.  Although  it  is  illegal  for  a pet owner to release a red-eared
 slider into the wild in New York, the regulation is  unenforceable,  and
 the commerce in red-eared sliders is unabated, resulting in the continu-
 ing  spread  of  red-eared sliders in waters ranging from Buffalo to New
 York City's parks.
  6. New York's participation in the international marketplace for  red-
 eared slider turtles has made the state and its people unwitting partic-
 ipants  in  the global spread of one of the most invasive species on the
 planet.
  7. It is in the best interest of the state that  the  breeding,  sale,
 trade,  purchase,  importation,  and  exportation  of  red-eared  slider
