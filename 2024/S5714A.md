 CULTURE  as  a  vital aspect of our culture and heritage and as a valued
 means of expanding the scope of our educational programs AND FUNDING  TO
 REFLECT CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND EQUITY.
  It  is  hereby  declared  to  be  the policy of the state to join with

 insure that CULTURAL PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND the  role  of  the
