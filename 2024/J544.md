  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 20-24, 2023, as Agriculture Week in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Hardworking  American  farmers provide New York State, the
Nation, and much of the world with  a  safe,  healthy,  affordable,  and
abundant food supply; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 20-24, 2023, as Agriculture Week
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Agriculture Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Agriculture Week recognizes and  celebrates  the  abundance
provided  by  agriculture;  every  year,  producers,  agricultural
associations,  corporations,  universities,  government  agencies  and
countless  others  across  America  join  together  to  recognize  the
contributions of agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each American farmer feeds more than 165 people, a dramatic
increase from 25 people in the 1960s; quite simply, American agriculture
is doing more, and doing it better; as the world population soars, there
is an even greater demand for the food and fiber produced in the  United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Agriculture provides almost everything we eat, use and wear
on  a  daily  basis,  however,  too  few  people  truly  understand this
contribution; this is  particularly  the  case  in  our  schools,  where
students  may  only  be exposed to agriculture if they enroll in related
vocational training; and
 
  WHEREAS, By building awareness, the Agriculture Council  of  America
is  encouraging  young  people  to  consider  career  opportunities  in
agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration  of  National  Agriculture  Week  is  in
recognition  of  all  the farmers who feed us and our families every day
and of the importance of agriculture as a vital  industry  and  economic
driver in New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  March  20-24,  2023,  as
Agriculture  Week  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Agriculture Week, honoring  and  recognizing  the
important  contributions  of  all  branches  of  farming  to the health,
economic well-being, environment, beauty, and future of New York  State;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
