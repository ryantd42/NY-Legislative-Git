 computation of rates of payment for a prior rate period based on a budg-
 et and actual capital related inpatient expenses  for  such  prior  rate
 period,  each  as  determined  in  accordance with paragraph (a) of this
 subdivision, adjusted to reflect increases or  decreases  in  volume  of
 service  in  such  prior  rate  period compared to statistics applied in

 that do not have excess payment amounts.  Such  reallocations  shall  be
 proportional  to  each such hospital's aggregate payment amount pursuant
 to paragraph (i) of subdivision 35  of  section  2807-c  of  the  public
 health law and this section to the total of all payment amounts for such
 eligible  hospitals.  Such  adjustment  payment may be added to rates of

  § 280. Medicaid drug cap. 1. The legislature hereby finds and declares
 that  there is a significant public interest for the Medicaid program to
 S. 8307--C  19  A. 8807--C
 
 manage drug costs in a manner that ensures patient access while  provid-
 ing  financial  stability  for  the  state  and participating providers.
 Since two thousand eleven, the state  has  taken  significant  steps  to
 contain  costs  in the Medicaid program by imposing a statutory limit on
 annual growth. Drug expenditures,  however,  continually  outpace  other
 cost  components  causing  significant pressure on the state, providers,
 and patient access operating under the Medicaid global cap. It is there-
 fore intended that the department establish a [Medicaid drug  cap  as  a
 separate  component  within the Medicaid global cap] SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE
 PROGRAM as part of a focused and sustained effort to balance the  growth
 of drug expenditures with the growth of total Medicaid expenditures.
  2.  The  commissioner shall [establish a year to year] REVIEW AT LEAST
 ANNUALLY THE department of health state funds Medicaid drug [expenditure
 growth target as follows:
  (a) for state fiscal year two thousand seventeen--two  thousand  eigh-
 teen,  be  limited to the ten-year rolling average of the medical compo-
 nent of the consumer price index plus five percent and minus a  pharmacy
 savings target of fifty-five million dollars; and
  (b)  for  state  fiscal year two thousand eighteen--two thousand nine-
 teen, be limited to the ten-year rolling average of the  medical  compo-
 nent  of the consumer price index plus four percent and minus a pharmacy
 savings target of eighty-five million dollars;
  (c) for state fiscal year two thousand nineteen--two thousand  twenty,
 be  limited  to the ten-year rolling average of the medical component of
 the consumer price index plus four percent and minus a pharmacy  savings
 target of eighty-five million dollars;
  (d)  for  state  fiscal year two thousand twenty--two thousand twenty-
 one, be limited to the ten-year rolling average of the medical component
 of the consumer price index plus two percent; and
  (e) for state fiscal year two thousand twenty-one--two thousand  twen-
 ty-two and fiscal years thereafter, be limited in accordance with subdi-
 vision  one of section ninety-one of part H of chapter fifty-nine of the
 laws of two thousand eleven, as amended] EXPENDITURES TO IDENTIFY  DRUGS
 IN  THE  EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE OR HIGHER OF TOTAL SPEND, NET OF REBATE OR
 IN THE EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE OR HIGHER BASED ON COST PER  CLAIM,  NET  OF
 REBATE.
  3.  (A) The [department and the division of the budget shall assess on
 a quarterly basis the projected total amount to be expended in the  year
 on a cash basis by the Medicaid program for each drug, and the projected
 annual  amount of state funds Medicaid drug expenditures on a cash basis
 for all drugs, which shall be a component of the projected department of
 health state funds Medicaid  expenditures  calculated  for  purposes  of
 sections  ninety-one  and  ninety-two of part H of chapter fifty-nine of
 the laws of two thousand eleven. For purposes  of  this  section,  state
 funds  Medicaid  drug expenditures include amounts expended for drugs in
 both the Medicaid fee-for-service  program  and  Medicaid  managed  care
 programs,  minus  the  amount  of  any drug rebates or supplemental drug
 rebates received by the department, including rebates pursuant to subdi-
 vision five of this section with respect to rebate targets. The  depart-
 ment  and  the  division  of the budget shall report in December of each
 year, for the prior April  through  October,  to  the  drug  utilization
 review  board  the  projected  state  funds  Medicaid  drug expenditures
 including the amounts, in aggregate thereof,  attributable  to  the  net
 cost  of:  changes  in  the utilization of drugs by Medicaid recipients;
 changes in the number of Medicaid recipients; changes  to  the  cost  of
 brand  name drugs and changes to the cost of generic drugs. The informa-
 S. 8307--C  20  A. 8807--C

 tion contained in the report shall not be publicly released in a  manner
 that allows for the identification of an individual drug or manufacturer
 or  that  is likely to compromise the financial competitive, or proprie-
 tary nature of the information.
  (a) In the event the director of the budget determines, based on Medi-
 caid drug expenditures for the previous quarter or other relevant infor-
 mation,  that  the  total department of health state funds Medicaid drug
 expenditure is projected to exceed the annual growth limitation  imposed
 by  subdivision  two of this section, the] commissioner may identify and
 refer drugs IN THE EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE OR HIGHER OF TOTAL SPEND, NET OF
 REBATE OR IN THE EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE OR HIGHER BASED ON COST PER CLAIM,
 NET OF REBATE, to the  drug  utilization  review  board  established  by
 section  three  hundred  sixty-nine-bb  of the social services law for a
 recommendation as to  whether  a  target  supplemental  Medicaid  rebate
 should be paid by the manufacturer of the drug to the department and the
 target amount of the rebate.
  (b)  If the department intends to refer a drug to the drug utilization
 review board pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the  depart-
 ment  shall  notify  the  manufacturer of such drug and shall attempt to
 reach agreement with the manufacturer on a rebate for the drug prior  to
 referring  the  drug  to  the  drug utilization review board for review.
 Such rebate may be based on evidence-based research, including, but  not
 limited  to,  such  research operated or conducted by or for other state
 governments, the federal government, the governments of  other  nations,
 and  third party payers or multi-state coalitions, provided however that
 the department shall account for the effectiveness of the drug in treat-
 ing the conditions  for  which  it  is  prescribed  or  in  improving  a
 patient's  health,  quality of life, or overall health outcomes, and the
 likelihood that use of the drug will reduce the need for  other  medical
 care, including hospitalization.
  (c)  In  the  event  that  the  commissioner and the manufacturer have
 previously agreed to a supplemental rebate for a drug pursuant to  para-
 graph  (b)  of this subdivision or paragraph (e) of subdivision seven of
 section three hundred sixty-seven-a of the social services law, the drug
 shall not be referred to the  drug  utilization  review  board  for  any
 further  supplemental  rebate  for  the  duration of the previous rebate
 agreement, provided however, the commissioner may refer a  drug  to  the
 drug  utilization  review board if the commissioner determines there are
 significant  and  substantiated  utilization  or  market  changes,  new
 evidence-based research, or statutory or federal regulatory changes that
 warrant  additional  rebates. In such cases, the department shall notify
 the manufacturer and provide evidence of the changes  or  research  that
 would  warrant  additional rebates, and shall attempt to reach agreement
 with the manufacturer on a rebate for the drug prior  to  referring  the
 drug to the drug utilization review board for review.
  (d)  The  department shall consider a drug's actual cost to the state,
 including current rebate amounts, prior to seeking an additional  rebate
 pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this subdivision.
  (e)  [The  commissioner  shall  be  authorized  to  take  the  actions
 described in this section only so long as total Medicaid  drug  expendi-
 tures  are  projected  to exceed the annual growth limitation imposed by
 subdivision two of this section.] IF THE COMMISSIONER IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN
 ENTERING INTO A REBATE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE  MANUFACTURER  OF  THE  DRUG
 SATISFACTORY  TO  THE  DEPARTMENT,  THE DRUG MANUFACTURER SHALL, IN THAT
 EVENT BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO THE DEPARTMENT, ON A STANDARD  REPORTING
 FORM DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT, THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:
 S. 8307--C  21  A. 8807--C

  (I) THE ACTUAL COST OF DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, PRODUCING (INCLUDING
 THE COST PER DOSE OF PRODUCTION), AND DISTRIBUTING THE DRUG;
  (II) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF THE DRUG, INCLUDING PAYMENTS TO
 PREDECESSOR  ENTITIES  CONDUCTING  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT,  SUCH  AS
 BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, UNIVERSITIES AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS,  AND  PRIVATE
 RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS;
  (III)  ADMINISTRATIVE,  MARKETING, AND ADVERTISING COSTS FOR THE DRUG,
 APPORTIONED BY MARKETING ACTIVITIES  THAT  ARE  DIRECTED  TO  CONSUMERS,
 MARKETING  ACTIVITIES  THAT  ARE  DIRECTED TO PRESCRIBERS, AND THE TOTAL
 COST OF ALL MARKETING AND ADVERTISING  THAT  IS  DIRECTED  PRIMARILY  TO
 CONSUMERS  AND  PRESCRIBERS  IN  NEW  YORK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 PRESCRIBER DETAILING, COPAYMENT DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, AND DIRECT-TO-CONSUM-
 ER MARKETING;
  (IV) THE EXTENT OF UTILIZATION OF THE DRUG;
  (V) PRICES FOR THE DRUG THAT ARE CHARGED  TO  PURCHASERS  OUTSIDE  THE
 UNITED STATES;
  (VI)  PRICES CHARGED TO TYPICAL PURCHASERS IN THE STATE, INCLUDING BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO PHARMACIES, PHARMACY  CHAINS,  PHARMACY  WHOLESALERS,  OR
 OTHER DIRECT PURCHASERS;
  (VII) THE AVERAGE REBATES AND DISCOUNTS PROVIDED PER PAYER TYPE IN THE
 STATE; AND
  (VIII) THE AVERAGE PROFIT MARGIN OF EACH DRUG OVER THE PRIOR FIVE-YEAR
 PERIOD AND THE PROJECTED PROFIT MARGIN ANTICIPATED FOR SUCH DRUG.
  (F) ALL INFORMATION DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (E) OF THIS SUBDI-
 VISION  SHALL  BE  CONSIDERED CONFIDENTIAL AND SHALL NOT BE DISCLOSED BY
 THE DEPARTMENT IN A FORM THAT  IDENTIFIES  A  SPECIFIC  MANUFACTURER  OR
 PRICES CHARGED FOR DRUGS BY SUCH MANUFACTURER.
  4.  In  determining  whether to recommend a target supplemental rebate
 for a drug, the drug utilization review board shall consider the  actual
 cost  of  the  drug to the Medicaid program, including federal and state
 rebates, and may consider, among other things:
  (a) the drug's impact on [the] Medicaid drug spending [growth target],
 and the adequacy of capitation rates of participating  Medicaid  managed
 care  plans,  and  the  drug's  affordability  and value to the Medicaid
 program; or
  (b) significant and unjustified increases in the price of the drug; or
  (c) whether the drug may be priced disproportionately to its therapeu-
 tic benefits.
  5. (a) If the drug utilization review board recommends a target rebate
 amount on a drug referred by  the  commissioner,  the  department  shall
 negotiate  with  the drug's manufacturer for a supplemental rebate to be
 paid by the manufacturer in an amount not to exceed such  target  rebate
 amount.  [A  rebate requirement shall apply beginning with the first day
 of the state fiscal year during which the rebate  was  required  without
 regard  to the date the department enters into the rebate agreement with
 the manufacturer.]
  (b) The supplemental rebate required by paragraph (a) of this subdivi-
 sion shall apply to drugs dispensed to enrollees of managed care provid-
 ers pursuant  to  section  three  hundred  sixty-four-j  of  the  social
 services  law  and to drugs dispensed to Medicaid recipients who are not
 enrollees of such providers.
  (c) [If the drug utilization review board recommends a  target  rebate
 amount  for  a  drug  and the department is unable to negotiate a rebate
 from the manufacturer in an amount that is at least seventy-five percent
 of the target rebate amount, the commissioner is authorized to waive the
 provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision three of section two  hundred
 S. 8307--C  22  A. 8807--C

 seventy-three  of  this article and the provisions of subdivisions twen-
 ty-five and twenty-five-a of section three hundred sixty-four-j  of  the
 social  services  law  with  respect  to such drug; however, this waiver
 shall  not be implemented in situations where it would prevent access by
 a Medicaid recipient to a drug which is the only treatment for a partic-
 ular disease or condition. Under no circumstances shall the commissioner
 be authorized to waive such provisions with respect  to  more  than  two
 drugs in a given time.
  (d)]  Where  the  department  and  a  manufacturer enter into a rebate
 agreement pursuant to this section, which may be in addition to existing
 rebate agreements entered into by the manufacturer with respect  to  the
 same  drug,  no  additional  rebates shall be required to be paid by the
 manufacturer to a managed care provider or any of a managed care provid-
 er's agents, including but not limited to any pharmacy benefit  manager,
 while the department is collecting the rebate pursuant to this section.
  [(e)]  (D)  In formulating a recommendation concerning a target rebate
 amount for a drug, the drug utilization review board may consider:
  (i) publicly available information relevant  to  the  pricing  of  the
 drug;
  (ii) information supplied by the department relevant to the pricing of
 the drug;
  (iii)  information  relating to value-based pricing provided, however,
 if the department directly invites any third party to  provide  cost-ef-
 fectiveness analysis or research related to value-based pricing, and the
 department  receives  and considers such analysis or research for use by
 the board, such third party shall disclose any  funding  sources.  The
 department  shall,  if  reasonably possible, make publicly available the
 following documents in its possession that it  relies  upon  to  provide
 cost  effectiveness analyses or research related to value-based pricing:
 (A) descriptions of underlying methodologies; (B) assumptions and  limi-
 tations  of  research findings; and (C) if available, data that presents
 results in a way that reflects different outcomes for affected  subpopu-
 lations;
  (iv)  the  seriousness and prevalence of the disease or condition that
 is treated by the drug;
  (v) the extent of utilization of the drug;
  (vi) the effectiveness of the drug  in  treating  the  conditions  for
 which  it  is prescribed, or in improving a patient's health, quality of
 life, or overall health outcomes;
  (vii) the likelihood that use of the drug will  reduce  the  need  for
 other medical care, including hospitalization;
  (viii) the average wholesale price, wholesale acquisition cost, retail
 price  of  the  drug,  and  the cost of the drug to the Medicaid program
 minus rebates received by the state;
  (ix) in the case  of  generic  drugs,  the  number  of  pharmaceutical
 manufacturers that produce the drug;
  (x) whether there are pharmaceutical equivalents to the drug; and
  (xi)  information supplied by the manufacturer, if any, explaining the
 relationship between the pricing of the drug and the cost of development
 of the drug and/or the therapeutic benefit  of  the  drug,  or  that  is
 otherwise  pertinent  to  the  manufacturer's pricing decision; any such
 information, INCLUDING THE INFORMATION ON THE  STANDARD  REPORTING  FORM
 REQUIREMENT  IN  PARAGRAPH  (E)  OF  SUBDIVISION  THREE OF THIS SECTION,
 provided shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed  by
 the  drug  utilization review board in a form that identifies a specific
 manufacturer or prices charged for drugs by such manufacturer.
 S. 8307--C  23  A. 8807--C
 
  6. [(a) If the drug  utilization  review  board  recommends  a  target
 rebate  amount  or  if the commissioner identifies a drug as a high cost
 drug pursuant to subparagraph (vii) of paragraph (e) of subdivision 7 of
 section three hundred sixty-seven-a of the social services law  and  the
 department  is  unsuccessful  in entering into a rebate arrangement with
 the manufacturer of the drug satisfactory to the  department,  the  drug
 manufacturer  shall  in that event be required to provide to the depart-
 ment, on a standard reporting form  developed  by  the  department,  the
 following information:
  (i) the actual cost of developing, manufacturing, producing (including
 the cost per dose of production), and distributing the drug;
  (ii) research and development costs of the drug, including payments to
 predecessor  entities  conducting  research  and  development,  such  as

 prescriber detailing, copayment discount programs, and direct-to-consum-
 er marketing;
  (iv) the extent of utilization of the drug;
  (v) prices for the drug that are charged  to  purchasers  outside  the
 United States;
  (vi)  prices charged to typical purchasers in the state, including but
 not limited to pharmacies, pharmacy  chains,  pharmacy  wholesalers,  or
 other direct purchasers;
  (vii) the average rebates and discounts provided per payer type in the
 State; and
  (viii) the average profit margin of each drug over the prior five-year
 period and the projected profit margin anticipated for such drug.

 vision  shall  be  considered confidential and shall not be disclosed by
 the department in a form that  identifies  a  specific  manufacturer  or
 prices charged for drugs by such manufacturer.
  7.]  (a) [If, after] AFTER taking into account all rebates and supple-
 mental rebates received by the department, including rebates received to
 date pursuant to this section[, total  Medicaid  drug  expenditures  are
 still projected to exceed the annual growth limitation imposed by subdi-
 vision two of this section], the commissioner may: subject any drug of a
 manufacturer  referred  to  the drug utilization review board under this
 section to prior approval in  accordance  with  existing  processes  and
 procedures  when  such  manufacturer has not entered into a supplemental
 rebate arrangement as required by this section; direct  a  managed  care
 plan  to  limit or reduce reimbursement for a drug provided by a medical
 practitioner if the drug utilization review board  recommends  a  target
 rebate  amount  for  such  drug and the manufacturer has failed to enter
 into a rebate arrangement required by this section; direct managed  care
 plans  to remove from their Medicaid formularies any drugs of a manufac-
 turer who has a drug that the drug utilization review board recommends a
 target rebate amount for and the manufacturer has failed to enter into a
 rebate arrangement required by this section; promote  the  use  of  cost
 effective  and  clinically  appropriate  drugs  other  than  those  of a
 manufacturer who has a drug  that  the  drug  utilization  review  board
 recommends  a  target  rebate  amount and the manufacturer has failed to

  § 4. Section 40 of chapter 266 of the laws of 1986, amending the civil
 practice  law  and  rules  and  other  laws  relating to malpractice and
 professional medical conduct, as amended by section 4 of part F of chap-
 ter 57 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  § 40. The superintendent of financial services shall  establish  rates
 for  policies  providing  coverage  for  physicians and surgeons medical
 malpractice for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June  30,
 [2024] 2025; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
 of  law,  the superintendent shall not establish or approve any increase
 in rates for the period commencing July 1,  2009  and  ending  June  30,
 2010.  The  superintendent shall direct insurers to establish segregated
 accounts for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income  attrib-
 utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
 insurers  regarding  claims and expenses attributable to such periods to
 monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
 and expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall  impose
 a  surcharge  on  premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected deficiency that is
 attributable to the premium levels established pursuant to this  section
 for  such  periods;  provided, however, that such annual surcharge shall
 not exceed eight percent of the established rate until  July  1,  [2024]
 2025, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
 ty-five  percent  of  the  approved  adequate rate, and that such annual
 surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
 to satisfy such deficiency. The superintendent  shall  not  impose  such
 surcharge  during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
 2010. On and after July  1,  1989,  the  surcharge  prescribed  by  this
 section  shall  be  retained by insurers to the extent that they insured
 physicians and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30,  [2024]
 2025  policy  periods;  in  the  event  and to the extent physicians and
 surgeons were insured by another insurer during such periods, all  or  a
 pro  rata  share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall be remitted
 to such other insurer in accordance with rules  and  regulations  to  be
 promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
 S. 8307--C  38  A. 8807--C
 
 and  surgeons  who  were not insured during such policy periods shall be
 apportioned among all insurers in proportion to the premium  written  by
 each  insurer  during such policy periods; if a physician or surgeon was
 insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
 during  such  policy  periods,  and  at  any time thereafter a hospital,
 health maintenance organization, employer or institution is  responsible
 for  responding in damages for liability arising out of such physician's
 or surgeon's practice of medicine, such responsible  entity  shall  also
 remit  to  such  prior  insurer the equivalent amount that would then be
 collected as a surcharge if the physician or surgeon  had  continued  to
 remain  insured  by  such  prior  insurer. In the event any insurer that
 provided coverage during such policy  periods  is  in  liquidation,  the
 property/casualty  insurance  security fund shall receive the portion of
 surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
 The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
 the purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The  superintendent,
 in  establishing  adequate  rates and in determining any projected defi-
 ciency pursuant to the requirements of this section  and  the  insurance
 law,  shall  give  substantial  weight, determined in his discretion and
 judgment, to the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of  any  regulations
 promulgated  and  laws  enacted  and the public benefit of  stabilizing
 malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
 od of time necessary for the development of  more  reliable  statistical
 experience  as  to  the  efficacy of such laws and regulations affecting
 medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
 1986, by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any  provision
 of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
 the  superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if such
 rates would be adequate when taken together with the maximum  authorized
 annual  surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time whether
 or not any such annual surcharge has been actually  imposed  as  of  the
 establishment of such rates.
  §  5. Section 5 and subdivisions (a) and (e) of section 6 of part J of
 chapter 63 of the laws of 2001, amending chapter  266  of  the  laws  of
 1986,  amending the civil practice law and rules and other laws relating
 to malpractice and professional medical conduct, as amended by section 5

  §  2.  Subdivision  9  of  section 2807-k of the public health law, as
 amended by section 1 of subpart C of part Y of chapter 57 of the laws of
 2023, is amended to read as follows:

 of  funds  from  the  pool,  the general hospital must implement minimum
 collection policies and procedures approved by the commissioner, utiliz-
 ing only a uniform financial assistance form developed and  provided  by
 the  department.  ALL  GENERAL  HOSPITALS THAT DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE
 INDIGENT CARE POOL SHALL ALSO UTILIZE ONLY THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSIST-
 ANCE FORM AND OTHERWISE COMPLY WITH SUBDIVISION NINE-A OF  THIS  SECTION
 GOVERNING  THE PROVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND HOSPITAL COLLECTION
 PROCEDURES.
  § 3. Subdivision 9-a of section 2807-k of the public  health  law,  as
 added  by  section  39-a of part A of chapter 57 of the laws of 2006 and
 paragraph (k) as added by section 43 of part B of chapter 58 of the laws
 of 2008, is amended to read as follows:
  9-a. (a) [As a  condition  for  participation  in  pool  distributions
 authorized  pursuant  to  this  section and section twenty-eight hundred
 seven-w of this article for] FOR periods on and after January first, two
 thousand nine, general hospitals shall, effective  for  periods  on  and
 after  January  first, two thousand seven, establish financial aid poli-
 cies and procedures, in accordance with the provisions of this  subdivi-
 sion,  for  reducing charges otherwise applicable to low-income individ-
 uals without health insurance OR UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS, or  who  have
 exhausted  their  health  insurance benefits, and who can demonstrate an
 inability to pay full charges, and also, at the  hospital's  discretion,
 for  reducing  or  discounting  the collection of co-pays and deductible
 payments from those individuals who can demonstrate an inability to  pay
 such  amounts.  IMMIGRATION STATUS SHALL NOT BE AN ELIGIBILITY CRITERION
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS SECTION.
  (b) Such reductions from charges for [uninsured] patients with incomes
 below at least [three] FOUR hundred percent of the federal poverty level
 shall result in a charge to such individuals that does not  exceed  [the
 greater  of]  the amount that would have been paid for the same services
 [by the "highest volume payor" for such general hospital as  defined  in
 subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to
 title  XVIII  of  the  federal  social  security  act (medicare), or for
 services] provided pursuant to title XIX of the federal social  security
 act (medicaid), and provided further that such amounts shall be adjusted
 according to income level as follows:
 S. 8307--C  42  A. 8807--C

  (i) For patients with incomes [at or] below at least [one] TWO hundred
 percent  of  the  federal  poverty level, the hospital shall [collect no
 more than a nominal payment amount, consistent  with  guidelines  estab-
 lished  by the commissioner] WAIVE ALL CHARGES. NO NOMINAL PAYMENT SHALL
 BE COLLECTED;
  (ii)  For  patients  with  incomes  between at least [one] TWO hundred
 [one] percent and [one] UP TO  THREE  hundred  [fifty]  percent  of  the
 federal  poverty  level,  the  hospital  shall  collect no more than the
 amount identified after application of a proportional sliding fee sched-
 ule under which patients with lower incomes shall pay the lowest amount.
 Such schedule shall provide that the amount the hospital may collect for
 such patients increases [from the nominal amount described  in  subpara-
 graph  (i)  of  this paragraph] in equal increments as the income of the
 patient increases, up to a  maximum  of  [twenty]  TEN  percent  of  the
 [greater  of the] amount that would have been paid for the same services
 [by the "highest volume payor" for such general hospital, as defined  in
 subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to
 title  XVIII  of  the  federal  social  security  act  (medicare) or for
 services] provided pursuant to title XIX of the federal social  security
 act  (medicaid),  OR  FOR  UNDERINSURED PATIENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF TEN
 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT  THAT  WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  PAID  PURSUANT  TO  SUCH
 PATIENT'S INSURANCE COST SHARING;
  (iii)  For  patients with incomes between at least [one] THREE hundred
 [fifty-one] ONE percent and [two] FOUR hundred [fifty]  percent  of  the
 federal  poverty  level,  the  hospital  shall  collect no more than the
 amount identified after application of a proportional sliding fee sched-
 ule under which patients with lower income shall pay the lowest amounts.
 Such schedule shall provide that the amount the hospital may collect for
 such patients increases from the [twenty] TEN percent  figure  described
 in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph in equal increments as the income
 of  the  patient  increases,  up  to  a  maximum of [the greater] TWENTY
 PERCENT of the amount that would have been paid for  the  same  services
 [by  the "highest volume payor" for such general hospital, as defined in
 subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to
 title XVIII of  the  federal  social  security  act  (medicare)  or  for
 services]  provided pursuant to title XIX of the federal social security
 act (medicaid), OR FOR UNDERINSURED PATIENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF  TWENTY
 PERCENT  OF  THE  AMOUNT  THAT  WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  PAID PURSUANT TO SUCH
 PATIENT'S INSURANCE COST SHARING; [and
  (iv) For patients with incomes between at least two hundred  fifty-one
 percent  and  three  hundred  percent  of the federal poverty level, the
 hospital shall collect no more than the greater of the amount that would
 have been paid for the same services by the "highest volume  payor"  for
 such  general hospital as defined in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph,
 or for services provided pursuant to title XVIII of the  federal  social
 security  act (medicare), or for services provided pursuant to title XIX
 of the federal social security act (medicaid).
  (v) For the purposes of this paragraph, "highest volume  payor"  shall
 mean  the  insurer,  corporation  or organization licensed, organized or
 certified pursuant to article thirty-two, forty-two  or  forty-three  of
 the insurance law or article forty-four of this chapter, or other third-
 party  payor,  which  has  a  contract  or  agreement  to pay claims for
 services provided by the  general  hospital  and  incurred  the  highest
 volume of claims in the previous calendar year.
  (vi)  A  hospital may implement policies and procedures to permit, but
 not require, consideration on a case-by-case basis of exceptions to  the
 S. 8307--C  43  A. 8807--C

 requirements  described  in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph
 based upon the existence of significant assets owned by the patient that
 should be taken into account  in  determining  the  appropriate  payment
 amount  for  that  patient's care, provided, however, that such proposed
 policies and procedures  shall  be  subject  to  the  prior  review  and
 approval  of the commissioner and, if approved, shall be included in the
 hospital's financial assistance  policy  established  pursuant  to  this
 section,  and  provided  further  that, if such approval is granted, the
 maximum amount that may be collected shall not exceed the greater of the
 amount that would have been paid for the same services by  the  "highest
 volume  payor"  for such general hospital as defined in subparagraph (v)
 of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to title  XVIII  of
 the  federal  social  security  act (medicare), or for services provided
 pursuant to title XIX of the federal social security act (medicaid).  In
 the  event  that a general hospital reviews a patient's assets in deter-
 mining payment  adjustments  such  policies  and  procedures  shall  not
 consider  as assets a patient's primary residence, assets held in a tax-
 deferred or  comparable  retirement  savings  account,  college  savings
 accounts,  or  cars  used  regularly  by  a  patient or immediate family
 members.
  (vii)] (IV) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed  to  limit  a
 hospital's  ability  to  establish  patient  eligibility  for  payment
 discounts at income levels higher than those specified herein and/or  to
 provide  greater  payment  discounts  for  eligible  patients than those
 required by this paragraph.
  (c) Such policies and procedures shall be  clear,  understandable,  in
 writing and publicly available in summary form and each general hospital
 participating  in the pool shall ensure that every patient is made aware
 of the existence of such policies and procedures and is provided,  in  a
 timely  manner,  with  a  summary  of such policies and procedures [upon
 request]. Any summary provided to patients shall, at a minimum,  include
 specific  information  as to income levels used to determine eligibility
 for assistance, a description of the primary service area of the  hospi-
 tal and the means of applying for assistance. For general hospitals with
 twenty-four  hour  emergency  departments,  such policies and procedures
 shall require the WRITTEN notification of patients during the intake and
 registration process, AND DURING DISCHARGE OF THE PATIENT,  AND  through
 the  conspicuous  posting  of  language-appropriate  information  in the
 general hospital, and  information  on  bills  and  statements  sent  to
 patients,  that financial aid may be available to qualified patients and
 how to obtain further information. For specialty hospitals without twen-
 ty-four hour emergency departments, such notification shall  take  place
 through  written  materials  provided  to patients during the intake and
 registration process prior to the provision of any health care  services
 or procedures, AND DURING DISCHARGE OF THE PATIENT, and through informa-
 tion on bills and statements sent to patients, that financial aid may be
 available  to  qualified patients and how to obtain further information.
 Application materials shall include  a  notice  to  patients  that  upon
 submission  of  a  completed  application,  including any information or
 documentation needed to determine the patient's eligibility pursuant  to
 the  hospital's  financial  assistance policy, the patient may disregard
 any bills until the hospital has rendered a decision on the  application
 in accordance with this paragraph.
  (d) Such policies and procedures shall include clear, objective crite-
 ria  for  determining  a patient's ability to pay and for providing such
 adjustments to payment requirements as are  necessary.  In  addition  to
 S. 8307--C  44  A. 8807--C
 
 adjustment  mechanisms  such  as  sliding fee schedules and discounts to
 fixed standards, such policies and procedures shall also provide for the
 use of installment plans for the  payment  of  outstanding  balances  by
 patients  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  [hospital's] financial
 assistance policy. The monthly payment  under  such  a  plan  shall  not
 exceed  [ten]  FIVE percent of the gross monthly income of the patient[,
 provided, however, that if patient assets are considered  under  such  a
 policy,  then  patient  assets which are not excluded assets pursuant to
 subparagraph (vi) of paragraph (b) of this subdivision may be considered
 in addition to the limit on monthly  payments].  The  rate  of  interest
 charged  to  the patient on the unpaid balance, if any, shall not exceed
 [the rate for a ninety-day security issued by the United States  Depart-
 ment  of  Treasury,  plus  .5]  TWO percent and no plan shall include an
 accelerator or similar clause under which a higher rate of  interest  is
 triggered upon a missed payment. If such policies and procedures include
 a  requirement  of  a deposit prior to non-emergent, medically-necessary
 care, such deposit must be included as part of any financial aid consid-
 eration. Such policies and procedures shall be applied  consistently  to
 all eligible patients.
  (e)  Such  policies  and procedures shall permit patients to apply for
 assistance [within at least ninety days of the date of discharge or date
 of service and provide at least twenty days for  patients  to  submit  a
 completed  application] AT ANY TIME DURING THE COLLECTION PROCESS.  Such
 policies and  procedures  may  require  that  patients  seeking  payment
 adjustments  provide appropriate financial information and documentation
 in support of their application, provided, however, that  such  applica-
 tion  process  shall not be unduly burdensome or complex. General hospi-
 tals shall, upon request, assist patients in  understanding  the  hospi-
 tal's  policies  and procedures and in applying for payment adjustments.
 Application forms  shall  be  printed  in  the  "primary  languages"  of
 patients  served by the general hospital. For the purposes of this para-
 graph, "primary languages" shall include any language that is either (i)
 used to communicate, during at least five percent of patient visits in a
 year, by patients who  cannot  speak,  read,  write  or  understand  the
 English  language  at  the  level of proficiency necessary for effective
 communication with health care providers, or (ii) spoken by  non-English
 speaking  individuals  comprising  more  than one percent of the primary
 hospital service area population, as calculated using demographic infor-
 mation available from the United States Bureau of  the  Census,  supple-
 mented  by  data  from school systems. Decisions regarding such applica-
 tions shall be made  within  thirty  days  of  receipt  of  a  completed
 application.  Such policies and procedures shall require that the hospi-
 tal issue any denial/approval of such application in writing with infor-
 mation on how to appeal the denial and shall  require  the  hospital  to
 establish  an appeals process under which it will evaluate the denial of
 an application. Nothing in this  subdivision  shall  be  interpreted  as
 prohibiting a hospital from making the availability of financial assist-
 ance contingent upon the patient first applying for coverage under title
 XIX of the social security act (medicaid) or another PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED
 insurance  program  if, in the judgment of the hospital, the patient may
 be eligible  for  medicaid  or  another  PUBLICLY  SUBSIDIZED  insurance
 program,  and  upon  the  patient's cooperation in following the [hospi-
 tal's] financial  assistance  application  requirements,  including  the
 provision of information needed to make a determination on the patient's
 application in accordance with the hospital's financial assistance poli-
 cy,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  THIS  REQUIREMENT SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY
 S. 8307--C  45  A. 8807--C
 
 PATIENT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT QUALIFY FOR  COVERAGE  BASED  ON  THEIR
 IMMIGRATION STATUS.
  (f)  Such  policies  and  procedures  shall provide that patients with
 incomes below [three] FOUR hundred percent of the federal poverty  level
 are  deemed  presumptively  eligible  for  payment adjustments and shall
 conform to the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this  subdivi-
 sion,  provided,  however,  that  nothing  in  this subdivision shall be
 interpreted as precluding hospitals from extending such payment  adjust-
 ments  to  other  patients, either generally or on a case-by-case basis.
 Such policies and procedures shall provide financial aid  for  emergency
 hospital services, including emergency transfers pursuant to the federal
 emergency  medical  treatment  and  active labor act (42 USC 1395dd), to
 patients who reside in New York state and for medically necessary hospi-
 tal services for patients who reside in the hospital's  primary  service
 area  as determined according to criteria established by the commission-
 er. In developing such criteria, the  commissioner  shall  consult  with
 representatives of the hospital industry, health care consumer advocates
 and local public health officials. Such criteria shall be made available
 to  the public no less than thirty days prior to the date of implementa-
 tion and shall, at a minimum:
  (i) prohibit a  hospital  from  developing  or  altering  its  primary
 service  area in a manner designed to avoid medically underserved commu-
 nities or communities with high percentages of uninsured residents;
  (ii) ensure that every geographic area of the state is included in  at
 least  one  general  hospital's  primary  service  area so that eligible
 patients may access care and financial assistance; and
  (iii) require the hospital to notify the commissioner upon making  any
 change  to its primary service area, and to include a description of its
 primary service area in  the  hospital's  annual  implementation  report
 filed  pursuant  to  subdivision  three  of section twenty-eight hundred
 three-l of this article.
  (g) Nothing in this subdivision shall  be  interpreted  as  precluding
 hospitals  from  extending  payment  adjustments for medically necessary
 non-emergency hospital services to patients outside  of  the  hospital's
 primary  service area. For patients determined to be eligible for finan-
 cial aid under the terms of a  hospital's  financial  aid  policy,  such
 policies  and procedures shall prohibit any limitations on financial aid
 for services based on the medical condition of the applicant, other than
 typical limitations or exclusions based  on  medical  necessity  or  the
 clinical or therapeutic benefit of a procedure or treatment.
  (h)  SUCH  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SHALL PROHIBIT THE DENIAL OF ADMIS-
 SION OR DENIAL OF TREATMENT FOR SERVICES THAT ARE REASONABLY ANTICIPATED
 TO BE MEDICALLY NECESSARY BECAUSE THE  PATIENT  HAS  AN  UNPAID  MEDICAL
 BILL.  Such  policies  and  procedures  shall  [not permit] PROHIBIT the
 forced sale or foreclosure of a patient's primary residence in order  to
 collect  an  outstanding  medical bill and shall require the hospital to
 refrain from sending an account to collection if the patient has submit-
 ted a completed application for financial aid,  including  any  required
 supporting  documentation,  while  the hospital determines the patient's
 eligibility for such aid. SUCH POLICIES AND  PROCEDURES  SHALL  PROHIBIT
 THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEBT ACCUMULATED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION TO A THIRD
 PARTY,  UNLESS THE THIRD PARTY EXPLICITLY PURCHASES SUCH MEDICAL DEBT IN
 ORDER TO RELIEVE THE DEBT OF THE PATIENT. Such policies  and  procedures
 shall provide for written notification, which shall include notification
 on  a  patient bill, to a patient not less than thirty days prior to the
 referral of debts for collection and shall require that  the  collection
 S. 8307--C  46  A. 8807--C
 
 agency obtain the hospital's written consent prior to commencing a legal
 action.  SUCH  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  SHALL PROHIBIT A HOSPITAL FROM
 COMMENCING A LEGAL ACTION RELATED TO THE RECOVERY  OF  MEDICAL  DEBT  OR
 UNPAID BILLS AGAINST PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF
 THE  FEDERAL  POVERTY LEVEL. IN ANY LEGAL ACTION RELATED TO THE RECOVERY
 OF MEDICAL DEBT OR UNPAID BILLS BY OR  ON  BEHALF  OF  A  HOSPITAL,  THE
 COMPLAINT  SHALL  BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN AFFIDAVIT BY THE HOSPITAL'S CHIEF
 FINANCIAL OFFICER STATING THAT  BASED  UPON  THE  HOSPITAL'S  REASONABLE
 EFFORT  TO  DETERMINE  THE  PATIENT'S  INCOME, THE PATIENT WHOM THEY ARE
 TAKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST DOES NOT HAVE AN INCOME BELOW  FOUR  HUNDRED
 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. Such policies and procedures shall
 require  all  general  hospital staff who interact with patients or have
 responsibility for billing and collections to be trained in  such  poli-
 cies  and  procedures, and require the implementation of a mechanism for
 the general hospital to measure its compliance with  such  policies  and
 procedures.  Such  policies  and  procedures  shall  require  that  any
 collection agency  under  contract  with  a  general  hospital  for  the
 collection  of  debts follow the hospital's financial assistance policy,
 including providing information to patients on how to apply  for  finan-
 cial  assistance  where  appropriate. Such policies and procedures shall
 prohibit collections from a patient who is determined to be eligible for
 medical assistance pursuant to title XIX of the federal social  security
 act  at  the time services were rendered and for which services medicaid
 payment is available.
  (i) Reports required to be submitted to the department by each general
 hospital as a condition  for  participation  in  the  pools,  and  which
 contain, in accordance with applicable regulations, a certification from
 an  independent  certified  public  accountant  or  independent licensed
 public accountant or an attestation from a senior official of the hospi-
 tal that the hospital is in compliance with conditions of  participation
 in  the  pools,  shall  also contain, for reporting periods on and after
 January first, two thousand seven:
  (i) a report on hospital costs incurred  and  uncollected  amounts  in
 providing  services  to  eligible patients without insurance[, including
 the amount of care provided for a nominal payment  amount,]  during  the
 period covered by the report;
  (ii)  hospital  costs incurred and uncollected amounts for deductibles
 and coinsurance for eligible patients with insurance or other third-par-
 ty payor coverage;
  (iii) the number of patients, organized  according  to  United  States
 postal  service  zip code, who applied for financial assistance pursuant
 to the hospital's financial assistance policy, and the number, organized
 according to United States postal service zip code,  whose  applications
 were approved and whose applications were denied;
  (iv)  THE  NUMBER  OF  PATIENTS, INCLUDING THEIR AGE, RACE, ETHNICITY,
 GENDER AND INSURANCE STATUS, WHO APPLIED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  UNDER
 THE  HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, AND THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS,
 INCLUDING THEIR AGE, RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER AND INSURANCE STATUS, WHOSE
 APPLICATIONS WERE APPROVED AND DENIED;
  (V) the reimbursement received for indigent care from the pool  estab-
 lished pursuant to this section;
  [(v)] (VI) the amount of funds that have been expended on charity care
 from  charitable  bequests made or trusts established for the purpose of
 providing financial assistance to patients who are eligible  in  accord-
 ance with the terms of such bequests or trusts;
 S. 8307--C  47  A. 8807--C
 
  [(vi)]  (VII)  for  hospitals  located in social services districts in
 which the district allows hospitals to assist patients with such  appli-
 cations,  the  number of applications for eligibility under title XIX of
 the social security act (medicaid) that the hospital  assisted  patients
 in completing and the number denied and approved; AND
  [(vii)] (VIII) the hospital's financial losses resulting from services
 provided under medicaid[; and
  (viii)  the  number  of  liens  placed  on  the  primary residences of
 patients through the collection process used by a hospital].
  (j) Within ninety days of the effective date of this subdivision  each
 hospital  shall submit to the commissioner a written report on its poli-
 cies and procedures for financial assistance to patients which are  used
 by  the  hospital on the effective date of this subdivision. Such report
 shall include copies of its policies and procedures, including  material
 which  is  distributed  to patients, and a description of the hospital's
 financial aid policies and procedures. Such  description  shall  include
 the  income levels of patients on which eligibility is based, the finan-
 cial aid eligible patients receive and the  means  of  calculating  such
 aid,  and  the  service  area, if any, used by the hospital to determine
 eligibility.
  (k) [In the event it is determined by the commissioner that the  state
 will  be unable to secure all necessary federal approvals to include, as
 part of the state's approved state plan  under  title  nineteen  of  the
 federal  social  security  act, a requirement, as set forth in paragraph
 one of this subdivision, that compliance  with  this  subdivision  is  a
 condition  of participation in pool distributions authorized pursuant to
 this section and section twenty-eight hundred seven-w of  this  article,
 then  such condition of participation shall be deemed null and void and,
 notwithstanding] NOTWITHSTANDING section twelve of this chapter, failure
 to comply with the provisions of this subdivision by a hospital  on  and
 after the date of such determination shall make such hospital liable for
 a  civil  penalty  not  to  exceed  ten  thousand  dollars for each such
 violation. The imposition of such civil penalties shall  be  subject  to
 the provisions of section twelve-a of this chapter.
  (L)  A  HOSPITAL  OR  ITS  COLLECTION AGENT SHALL NOT COMMENCE A CIVIL
 ACTION AGAINST A PATIENT OR DELEGATE A COLLECTION  ACTIVITY  TO  A  DEBT
 COLLECTOR  FOR NONPAYMENT FOR AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE
 FIRST POST-SERVICE BILL IS ISSUED AND UNTIL A HOSPITAL HAS MADE  REASON-
 ABLE  EFFORTS  TO  DETERMINE  WHETHER  A PATIENT QUALIFIES FOR FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE.
  § 4. The public health law is amended by adding a new section 18-c  to
 read as follows:
  §  18-C. SEPARATE PATIENT CONSENT FOR TREATMENT AND PAYMENT FOR HEALTH
 CARE SERVICES. INFORMED CONSENT FROM A PATIENT TO PROVIDE ANY TREATMENT,
 PROCEDURE, EXAMINATION OR OTHER DIRECT HEALTH  CARE  SERVICES  SHALL  BE
 OBTAINED SEPARATELY FROM SUCH PATIENT'S CONSENT TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES.
 CONSENT  TO  PAY  FOR ANY HEALTH CARE SERVICES BY A PATIENT SHALL NOT BE
 GIVEN PRIOR TO THE PATIENT RECEIVING SUCH SERVICES AND DISCUSSING TREAT-
 MENT COSTS. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS  SECTION,  "CONSENT"  MEANS  AN  ACTION
 WHICH:  (A)  CLEARLY  AND  CONSPICUOUSLY  COMMUNICATES  THE INDIVIDUAL'S
 AUTHORIZATION OF AN ACT OR PRACTICE; (B) IS MADE IN THE ABSENCE  OF  ANY
 MECHANISM  IN  THE  USER  INTERFACE  THAT HAS THE PURPOSE OR SUBSTANTIAL
 EFFECT OF OBSCURING, SUBVERTING, OR IMPAIRING DECISION-MAKING OR  CHOICE
 TO OBTAIN CONSENT; AND (C) CANNOT BE INFERRED FROM INACTION.
  §  5.  The  general business law is amended by adding two new sections
 349-g and 519-a to read as follows:
 S. 8307--C  48  A. 8807--C
 
  § 349-G.  RESTRICTIONS ON APPLICATIONS FOR AND USE OF CREDIT CARDS AND
 MEDICAL FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. 1. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOW-
 ING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A)  "MEDICAL  FINANCIAL PRODUCTS" SHALL MEAN MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS AND
 THIRD-PARTY MEDICAL INSTALLMENT LOANS.
  (B) "HEALTH CARE PROVIDER"  SHALL  MEAN  A  HEALTH  CARE  PROFESSIONAL
 LICENSED,  REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED PURSUANT TO TITLE EIGHT OF THE EDUCA-
 TION LAW.
  (C) "MEDICAL CREDIT CARD" SHALL MEAN A CREDIT  CARD  ISSUED  UNDER  AN
 OPEN-END  OR  CLOSED-END  PLAN  OFFERED  SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PAYMENT OF
 HEALTH CARE SERVICES, PRODUCTS, OR DEVICES PROVIDED TO A PERSON.
  2. IT SHALL BE PROHIBITED FOR ANY HOSPITAL OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, OR
 EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF A HOSPITAL OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, TO COMPLETE ANY
 PORTION OF AN APPLICATION FOR MEDICAL FINANCIAL PRODUCTS FOR THE PATIENT
 OR OTHERWISE ARRANGE  FOR  OR  ESTABLISH  AN  APPLICATION  THAT  IS  NOT
 COMPLETELY FILLED OUT BY THE PATIENT.
  §  519-A.  CREDIT  CARDS  AND PAYMENT FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. 1. FOR
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM "CREDIT CARD"  SHALL  HAVE  THE  SAME
 MEANING AS IN SECTION FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE.
  2.  NO HOSPITAL OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER SHALL REQUIRE CREDIT CARD PRE-
 AUTHORIZATION NOR REQUIRE THE PATIENT TO HAVE  A  CREDIT  CARD  ON  FILE
 PRIOR  TO PROVIDING EMERGENCY OR MEDICALLY NECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES TO
 SUCH PATIENT.
  3. HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SHALL NOTIFY ALL PATIENTS ABOUT
 THE RISKS OF PAYING FOR  MEDICAL  SERVICES  WITH  A  CREDIT  CARD.  SUCH
 NOTIFICATION SHALL HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT BY USING A CREDIT CARD TO PAY
 FOR  MEDICAL  SERVICES,  THE  PATIENT  IS  FORGOING  STATE  AND  FEDERAL
 PROTECTIONS THAT REGARD MEDICAL DEBT.  THE COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH  SHALL
 HAVE  THE  AUTHORITY  AND  SOLE  DISCRETION  TO SET REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
 CONTENTS OF SUCH NOTICES.
  § 6. This act shall take effect six months after it shall have  become
 a  law;  provided,  however, that if section 1 of subpart C of part Y of
 chapter 57 of the laws of 2023 shall not have taken effect on or  before
 such  date  then  section  two of this act shall take effect on the same

 effect.  Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of
 any  rule  or regulation necessary for the implementation of this act on
 its effective date are authorized to be made and completed on or  before
 such effective date.
