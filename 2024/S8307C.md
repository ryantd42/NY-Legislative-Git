 ments and actions of the commissioner outweigh any disadvantages  likely

 approve an arrangement for which state action immunity is  sought  under

 tion from, the public health and health planning council. No arrangement
 under this article shall be approved after  December  thirty-first,  two
 thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-EIGHT.

  § 4. Section 40 of chapter 266 of the laws of 1986, amending the civil
 practice  law  and  rules  and  other  laws  relating to malpractice and
 professional medical conduct, as amended by section 4 of part F of chap-
 ter 57 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  § 40. The superintendent of financial services shall  establish  rates
 for  policies  providing  coverage  for  physicians and surgeons medical
 malpractice for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June  30,
 [2024] 2025; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
 of  law,  the superintendent shall not establish or approve any increase
 in rates for the period commencing July 1,  2009  and  ending  June  30,
 2010.  The  superintendent shall direct insurers to establish segregated
 accounts for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income  attrib-
 utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
 insurers  regarding  claims and expenses attributable to such periods to
 monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
 and expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall  impose
 a  surcharge  on  premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected deficiency that is
 attributable to the premium levels established pursuant to this  section
 for  such  periods;  provided, however, that such annual surcharge shall
 not exceed eight percent of the established rate until  July  1,  [2024]
 2025, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
 ty-five  percent  of  the  approved  adequate rate, and that such annual
 surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
 to satisfy such deficiency. The superintendent  shall  not  impose  such
 surcharge  during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
 2010. On and after July  1,  1989,  the  surcharge  prescribed  by  this
 section  shall  be  retained by insurers to the extent that they insured
 physicians and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30,  [2024]
 2025  policy  periods;  in  the  event  and to the extent physicians and
 S. 8307--B  32
 
 surgeons were insured by another insurer during such periods, all  or  a
 pro  rata  share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall be remitted
 to such other insurer in accordance with rules  and  regulations  to  be
 promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
 and  surgeons  who  were not insured during such policy periods shall be
 apportioned among all insurers in proportion to the premium  written  by
 each  insurer  during such policy periods; if a physician or surgeon was
 insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
 during such policy periods, and  at  any  time  thereafter  a  hospital,
 health  maintenance organization, employer or institution is responsible
 for responding in damages for liability arising out of such  physician's
 or  surgeon's  practice  of medicine, such responsible entity shall also
 remit to such prior insurer the equivalent amount  that  would  then  be
 collected  as  a  surcharge if the physician or surgeon had continued to
 remain insured by such prior insurer. In  the  event  any  insurer  that
 provided  coverage  during  such  policy  periods is in liquidation, the
 property/casualty insurance security fund shall receive the  portion  of
 surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
 The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
 the  purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The superintendent,
 in establishing adequate rates and in determining  any  projected  defi-
 ciency  pursuant  to  the requirements of this section and the insurance
 law, shall give substantial weight, determined  in  his  discretion  and
 judgment,  to  the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of any regulations
 promulgated and laws enacted and the  public  benefit  of  stabilizing
 malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
 od  of  time  necessary for the development of more reliable statistical
 experience as to the efficacy of such  laws  and  regulations  affecting
 medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
 1986,  by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any provision
 of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
 the superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if  such
 rates  would be adequate when taken together with the maximum authorized
 annual surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time  whether
 or  not  any  such  annual surcharge has been actually imposed as of the
 establishment of such rates.
  § 5. Section 5 and subdivisions (a) and (e) of section 6 of part J  of
 chapter  63  of  the  laws  of 2001, amending chapter 266 of the laws of
 1986, amending the civil practice law and rules and other laws  relating
 to malpractice and professional medical conduct, as amended by section 5
 of  part  F  of  chapter  57 of the laws of 2023, are amended to read as

 SHALL APPLY TO ANY GENERAL HOSPITAL INCLUDING ANY  AFFILIATED  PROVIDERS
 OR  ENTITY  ACTING  ON  THE  GENERAL HOSPITAL'S OR AFFILIATED PROVIDER'S
 BEHALF. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "AFFILIATED PROVIDER" MEANS A  PROVIDER

 greater  of]  the amount that would have been paid for the same services
 [by the "highest volume payor" for such general hospital as  defined  in
 subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to
 title  XVIII  of  the  federal  social  security  act (medicare), or for
 services] provided pursuant to title XIX of the federal social  security
 act (medicaid), and provided further that such amounts shall be adjusted
 according to income level as follows:
  (i) For patients with incomes [at or] below at least [one] TWO hundred
 percent  of  the  federal  poverty level, the hospital shall [collect no
 more than a nominal payment amount, consistent  with  guidelines  estab-
 lished  by the commissioner] WAIVE ALL CHARGES. NO NOMINAL PAYMENT SHALL

 al  poverty  level,  the  hospital shall collect no more than the amount
 identified after application of  a  proportional  sliding  fee  schedule
 under  which  patients  with  lower incomes shall pay the lowest amount.
 Such schedule shall provide that the amount the hospital may collect for
 such patients increases from the nominal amount  described  in  subpara-
 graph  (i)  of  this  paragraph in equal increments as the income of the
 patient increases, up to a maximum of twenty percent of the [greater  of
 the]  amount  that  would  have  been paid for the same services [by the
 "highest volume payor" for such general hospital, as defined in subpara-
 graph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to  title

  (iii)  [For  patients with incomes between at least one hundred fifty-
 one percent and two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty  level,
 the  hospital  shall  collect  no  more than the amount identified after
 application of a proportional sliding fee schedule under which  patients
 with  lower  income  shall  pay  the lowest amounts. Such schedule shall
 provide that the amount the  hospital  may  collect  for  such  patients
 increases  from the twenty percent figure described in subparagraph (ii)
 of this paragraph in equal increments  as  the  income  of  the  patient
 increases,  up to a maximum of the greater of the amount that would have
 been paid for the same services by the "highest volume payor"  for  such
 general  hospital,  as defined in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or
 for services provided pursuant to title  XVIII  of  the  federal  social
 security  act  (medicare) or for services provided pursuant to title XIX

 the]  amount  that  would  have  been paid for the same services [by the
 "highest volume payor" for such general hospital as defined in  subpara-
 graph  (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to title
 XVIII of the federal social security act (medicare),  or  for  services]

 caid).  AFTER  RECEIPT  OF  SIXTY  PAYMENTS  AT  THE AGREED UPON MONTHLY
 AMOUNT, THE PATIENT'S BILL SHALL BE CONSIDERED PAID IN FULL AND ANY  AND
 ALL  COLLECTION  ACTIVITIES  ON ANY BALANCE THAT REMAINS UNPAID SHALL BE
 PROHIBITED; AND
 S. 8307--B  38
 
  [(v) For the purposes of this paragraph, "highest volume payor"  shall
 mean  the  insurer,  corporation  or organization licensed, organized or
 certified pursuant to article thirty-two, forty-two  or  forty-three  of
 the insurance law or article forty-four of this chapter, or other third-
 party  payor,  which  has  a  contract  or  agreement  to pay claims for
 services provided by the  general  hospital  and  incurred  the  highest
 volume of claims in the previous calendar year.
  (vi)  A  hospital may implement policies and procedures to permit, but
 not require, consideration on a case-by-case basis of exceptions to  the
 requirements  described  in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph
 based upon the existence of significant assets owned by the patient that
 should be taken into account  in  determining  the  appropriate  payment
 amount  for  that  patient's care, provided, however, that such proposed
 policies and procedures  shall  be  subject  to  the  prior  review  and
 approval  of the commissioner and, if approved, shall be included in the
 hospital's financial assistance  policy  established  pursuant  to  this
 section,  and  provided  further  that, if such approval is granted, the
 maximum amount that may be collected shall not exceed the greater of the
 amount that would have been paid for the same services by  the  "highest
 volume  payor"  for such general hospital as defined in subparagraph (v)
 of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to title  XVIII  of
 the  federal  social  security  act (medicare), or for services provided
 pursuant to title XIX of the federal social security act (medicaid).  In
 the  event  that a general hospital reviews a patient's assets in deter-
 mining payment  adjustments  such  policies  and  procedures  shall  not
 consider  as assets a patient's primary residence, assets held in a tax-
 deferred or  comparable  retirement  savings  account,  college  savings
 accounts,  or  cars  used  regularly  by  a  patient or immediate family
 members.
  (vii)] (IV) Nothing in this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION shall be construed
 to limit a hospital's  ability  to  establish  patient  eligibility  for
 payment  discounts  at  income levels higher than those specified herein
 and/or to provide greater payment discounts for eligible  patients  than
 those required by this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION.
  (c)  [Such  policies and procedures shall be clear, understandable, in
 writing and publicly available in summary form and  each]  EACH  general
 hospital  [participating in the pool] shall ensure that every patient is
 made aware of the  existence  of  [such  policies  and  procedures]  THE
 UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FORM AND POLICY and is provided, in a time-
 ly  manner,  with a [summary] COPY of [such policies and procedures upon
 request] THE POLICY AND FORM  AT  INTAKE  AND  DISCHARGE.  [Any  summary
 provided  to  patients shall, at a minimum, include specific information
 as to income levels used to  determine  eligibility  for  assistance,  a
 description of the primary service area of the hospital and the means of
 applying  for  assistance.  For  general hospitals with twenty-four hour
 emergency departments, such policies and procedures]  A  PLAIN  LANGUAGE
 SUMMARY OF THE COLLECTIONS PROCESS MUST ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE. A GENER-
 AL  HOSPITAL shall require the WRITTEN notification of patients OR THEIR
 AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES during the intake and  registration  process,
 DURING  DISCHARGE  OF  THE  PATIENT,  through the conspicuous posting of
 language-appropriate information  in  the  general  hospital,  INCLUDING
 EMERGENCY  DEPARTMENTS,  WAITING AREAS AND OTHER PLACES PATIENTS CONGRE-
 GATE, and THROUGH information on bills and statements sent to  patients,
 that  financial  [aid] ASSISTANCE may be available to qualified patients
 and how to obtain further information. For specialty  hospitals  without
 twenty-four  hour  emergency  departments,  such notification shall take
 S. 8307--B  39
 
 place through written materials provided to patients during  the  intake
 and  registration  process  prior  to  the  provision of any health care
 services or procedures, DURING DISCHARGE OF  THE  PATIENT,  and  through
 information  on  bills  and  statements sent to patients, that financial
 [aid] ASSISTANCE may be available  to  qualified  patients  and  how  to
 obtain further information. Application materials shall include a notice
 to  patients  that upon submission of a completed application, including
 any information or  documentation  needed  to  determine  the  patient's
 eligibility  pursuant to the hospital's financial assistance policy, the
 patient may disregard any bills until the hospital has rendered a  deci-
 sion  on  the  application  in  accordance  with this paragraph. GENERAL
 HOSPITALS SHALL POST THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION POLICY
 AND FORM, AND THE SUMMARY OF THE COLLECTION PROCESS,  IN  A  CONSPICUOUS
 LOCATION  AND  DOWNLOADABLE  FORM ON THE GENERAL HOSPITAL'S WEBSITE. THE
 COMMISSIONER SHALL POST THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FORM AND POLICY
 IN DOWNLOADABLE FORM ON THE DEPARTMENT'S HOSPITAL PROFILE  PAGE  OR  ANY
 SUCCESSOR WEBSITE.
  (d)  [Such  policies  and  procedures]  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PROVIDE
 APPLICATION MATERIALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS, INCLUDING THE UNIFORM FINAN-
 CIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION FORM AND POLICY. THESE APPLICATION MATERIALS
 SHALL INCLUDE A NOTICE TO PATIENTS THAT UPON SUBMISSION OF  A  COMPLETED
 APPLICATION  FORM,  THE  PATIENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY BILLS UNTIL
 THE GENERAL HOSPITAL HAS RENDERED  A  DECISION  ON  THE  APPLICATION  IN
 ACCORDANCE  WITH  THIS  SUBDIVISION.  THE  APPLICATION  MATERIALS  SHALL
 INCLUDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION AS THE  INCOME  LEVELS  USED  TO  DETERMINE
 ELIGIBILITY  FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND THE MEANS TO APPLY FOR ASSIST-
 ANCE. NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS  PRECLUDING  THE
 USE  OF PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS BY HOSPITALS ON BEHALF OF
 PATIENTS. THE UNIFORM APPLICATION FORM AND POLICY shall  include  clear,
 objective  criteria  for  determining a patient's ability to pay and for
 providing such adjustments to payment requirements as are necessary.  In
 addition  to  adjustment  mechanisms  such  as sliding fee schedules and
 discounts to fixed standards, [such policies and procedures] THE UNIFORM
 POLICY shall also provide for the  use  of  installment  plans  for  the
 payment  of outstanding balances by patients [pursuant to the provisions
 of the hospital's financial  assistance  policy].  The  monthly  payment
 under  such  a  plan  shall  not  exceed [ten] FIVE percent of the gross
 monthly income of the  patient[,  provided,  however,  that  if  patient
 assets are considered under such a policy, then patient assets which are
 not  excluded  assets  pursuant to subparagraph (vi) of paragraph (b) of
 this subdivision may be considered in addition to the limit  on  monthly
 payments].  INSTALLMENT  PLAN  PAYMENTS  SHALL  NOT BE REQUIRED TO BEGIN
 BEFORE ONE HUNDRED  EIGHTY  DAYS  AFTER  THE  DATE  OF  THE  SERVICE  OR
 DISCHARGE,  WHICHEVER  IS  LATER. THE POLICY SHALL ALLOW THE PATIENT AND
 THE HOSPITAL TO MUTUALLY AGREE TO MODIFY THE  TERMS  OF  AN  INSTALLMENT
 PLAN. The rate of interest charged to the patient on the unpaid balance,
 if  any,  shall not exceed [the rate for a ninety-day security issued by
 the United States Department of Treasury, plus .5] TWO  percent  and  no
 plan shall include an accelerator or similar clause under which a higher
 rate  of  interest is triggered upon a missed payment. [If such policies
 and procedures] THE UNIFORM POLICY SHALL NOT include a requirement of  a
 deposit prior to [non-emergent,] medically-necessary care[, such deposit
 must  be  included  as  part  of any financial aid consideration]. [Such
 policies and procedures] THE HOSPITAL SHALL REFUND ANY PAYMENTS MADE  BY
 THE  PATIENT  BEFORE  THE  DETERMINATION  OF  ELIGIBILITY  FOR FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE THAT EXCEEDS THE  PATIENT'S  LIABILITY  AFTER  DISCOUNTS  ARE
 S. 8307--B  40
 
 APPLIED.  THE UNIFORM POLICY shall be applied consistently to all eligi-
 ble patients.
  (e)  [Such  policies  and  procedures] THE UNIFORM POLICY shall permit
 patients to apply for assistance [within at least  ninety  days  of  the
 date  of  discharge  or date of service and provide at least twenty days
 for patients to submit a completed application] AT ANY TIME  DURING  THE
 COLLECTION  PROCESS.  [Such  policies and procedures may require that] A
 DETERMINATION THAT A PATIENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  SHALL
 BE  VALID FOR A MINIMUM OF TWELVE MONTHS AND WILL APPLY TO ALL OUTSTAND-
 ING MEDICAL BILLS. A HOSPITAL MAY USE CREDIT SCORING  SOFTWARE  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES  OF  ESTABLISHING  INCOME  ELIGIBILITY  AND APPROVING FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE, BUT ONLY IF THE HOSPITAL MAKES CLEAR  TO  THE  PATIENT  THAT
 PROVIDING A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS NOT MANDATORY AND THE SCORING DOES
 NOT  NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PATIENT'S CREDIT SCORE. HOWEVER, CREDIT SCOR-
 ING SOFTWARE SHALL NOT BE SOLELY RELIED UPON BY THE HOSPITAL IN  DENYING
 A  PATIENT'S  APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FURTHER, PROPENSITY-
 TO-PAY SCORES SHALL NOT DISQUALIFY PATIENTS WHO  OTHERWISE  QUALIFY  FOR
 ELIGIBILITY  FROM RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE UNIFORM POLICY AND
 FORM  SHALL  ALLOW  patients  seeking  [payment  adjustments]  FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE  TO provide [appropriate] THE FOLLOWING financial information
 and documentation in support of their application[,  provided,  however,
 that  such  application  process  shall  not  be  unduly  burdensome  or
 complex.]: PAYCHECKS OR  PAYSTUBS;  UNEMPLOYMENT  DOCUMENTATION;  SOCIAL
 SECURITY  INCOME;  RENT  RECEIPTS;  A LETTER FROM THE PATIENT'S EMPLOYER
 ATTESTING TO THE PATIENT'S GROSS INCOME;  DOCUMENTATION  OF  ELIGIBILITY
 FOR OTHER MEANS-TESTED GOVERNMENT BENEFITS; OR, IF NONE OF THE AFOREMEN-
 TIONED  INFORMATION  AND  DOCUMENTATION  ARE  AVAILABLE, A WRITTEN SELF-
 ATTESTATION OF THE PATIENT'S  INCOME  MAY  BE  USED.  General  hospitals
 shall[,  upon  request,]  TAKE  MEASURABLE  STEPS  TO assist patients in
 understanding the [hospital's policies and  procedures]  UNIFORM  POLICY
 AND FORM and in applying for [payment adjustments] FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
 [Application  forms  shall  be printed] THE COMMISSIONER SHALL TRANSLATE
 THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION FORM AND  POLICY  INTO  THE
 "PRIMARY  LANGUAGES"  OF  EACH  GENERAL  HOSPITAL. EACH GENERAL HOSPITAL
 SHALL POST THESE MATERIALS TO ITS WEBSITE AND MAKE SUCH MATERIALS AVAIL-
 ABLE TO PATIENTS THROUGH PRINTED COPIES in the  "primary  languages"  of
 patients  served by the general hospital. For the purposes of this para-
 graph, "primary languages" shall include any language that is either (i)
 used to communicate, during at least five percent of patient visits in a
 year, by patients who  cannot  speak,  read,  write  or  understand  the
 English  language  at  the  level of proficiency necessary for effective
 communication with health care providers, or (ii) spoken  by  [non-Engl-
 ish]  LIMITED-ENGLISH  speaking  individuals  comprising  more  than one
 percent of the primary hospital service area population,  as  calculated
 using demographic information available from the United States Bureau of
 the  Census, supplemented by data from school systems. Decisions regard-
 ing such applications shall be made within thirty days of receipt  of  a
 completed application. [Such policies and procedures] THE UNIFORM FINAN-
 CIAL  ASSISTANCE  POLICY  shall  require  that  the  hospital  issue any
 [denial/approval] DENIAL OR APPROVAL of  such  application  in  writing,
 WHICH CLEARLY COMMUNICATES THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE GRANTED, ANY AMOUNTS
 STILL  OWED, with information on how to appeal the [denial] DECISION and
 shall require the hospital to establish an appeals process  under  which
 it  will evaluate the denial of an application. Nothing in this subdivi-
 sion shall be interpreted as prohibiting  a  hospital  from  making  the
 availability  of  financial assistance contingent upon the patient first
 S. 8307--B  41
 
 applying for coverage THAT WILL PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT FOR  THE  SERVICES
 THAT  WERE RENDERED IN RELATION TO SUCH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION
 under title XIX of the social security act (medicaid) or another PUBLIC-
 LY-SUBSIDIZED  insurance  program if[, in the judgment of the hospital,]
 the patient [may be] IS eligible for medicaid or another PUBLICLY-SUBSI-
 DIZED insurance program, and upon the patient's cooperation in following

 [hospital's  financial  assistance]  UNIFORM  policy, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
 THIS REQUIREMENT SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY PATIENT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT
 QUALIFY FOR COVERAGE BASED ON THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS.  ANY INFORMATION
 GATHERED FOR SUCH COVERAGE DETERMINATION SHALL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL  AND
 SHALL NOT BE UTILIZED OR DISCLOSED BY THE GENERAL HOSPITAL, OR ANY OTHER
 PARTY,  FOR ANY PURPOSE EXCEPT TO ASSIST THE PATIENT IN OBTAINING COVER-
 AGE. THE HOSPITAL SHALL INFORM PATIENTS  ON  HOW  TO  FILE  A  COMPLAINT
 AGAINST THE HOSPITAL OR A DEBT COLLECTOR THAT IS CONTRACTED ON BEHALF OF
 THE  HOSPITAL  REGARDING  THE  PATIENT'S  BILL.  GENERAL HOSPITALS ARE
 REQUIRED TO TAKE REASONABLE MEASURES TO DETERMINE IF A PATIENT IS ELIGI-
 BLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDING PRIOR TO MAKING A REFERRAL  TO  A
 THIRD-PARTY DEBT COLLECTOR OR OTHER EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTIONS MEASURES.
  (f)  [Such  policies  and procedures] THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
 POLICY shall provide  that  patients  with  incomes  below  [three]  SIX
 hundred  percent of the federal poverty level are deemed [presumptively]
 eligible for payment adjustments and shall conform to  the  requirements
 set  forth in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, provided, however, that
 nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted as precluding hospitals
 from extending such payment adjustments to other patients, either gener-
 ally or on a case-by-case basis. [Such  policies  and  procedures  shall
 provide  financial  aid for emergency hospital services, including emer-
 gency transfers pursuant to the federal emergency medical treatment  and
 active  labor  act  (42  USC 1395dd), to patients who reside in New York
 state and for medically necessary hospital  services  for  patients  who
 reside in the hospital's primary service area as determined according to
 criteria  established  by the commissioner. In developing such criteria,
 the commissioner shall consult  with  representatives  of  the  hospital
 industry,  health  care consumer advocates and local public health offi-
 cials. Such criteria shall be made available to the public no less  than
 thirty days prior to the date of implementation and shall, at a minimum:
  (i)  prohibit  a  hospital  from  developing  or  altering its primary
 service area in a manner designed to avoid medically underserved  commu-
 nities or communities with high percentages of uninsured residents;
  (ii)  ensure that every geographic area of the state is included in at
 least one general hospital's  primary  service  area  so  that  eligible
 patients may access care and financial assistance; and
  (iii)  require the hospital to notify the commissioner upon making any
 change to its primary service area, and to include a description of  its
 primary  service  area  in  the  hospital's annual implementation report
 filed pursuant to subdivision  three  of  section  twenty-eight  hundred
 three-l of this article.]
  (g)  [Nothing  in  this subdivision shall be interpreted as precluding
 hospitals from extending payment  adjustments  for  medically  necessary
 non-emergency  hospital  services  to patients outside of the hospital's
 primary service area.] For patients determined to be eligible for finan-
 cial [aid] ASSISTANCE under the terms  of  [a  hospital's]  THE  UNIFORM
 financial  [aid]  ASSISTANCE  policy, [such policies and procedures] THE
 S. 8307--B  42
 
 UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY shall prohibit  any  limitations  on
 financial  [aid]  ASSISTANCE for services based on the medical condition
 of the applicant, other than typical limitations or exclusions based  on
 medical  necessity or the clinical or therapeutic benefit of a procedure
 or treatment.
  (h) [Such policies and procedures shall not  permit  the  forced]  THE
 UNIFORM  POLICY  SHALL  PROHIBIT  THE  DENIAL  OF ADMISSION OR DENIAL OF
 TREATMENT FOR SERVICES THAT ARE REASONABLY ANTICIPATED TO  BE  MEDICALLY
 NECESSARY  BECAUSE THE PATIENT HAS AN UNPAID MEDICAL BILL. A HOSPITAL OR
 ITS AGENT SHALL NOT COMMENCE A LEGAL ACTION OR FORCE A sale or  foreclo-
 sure of a patient's primary residence in order to collect an outstanding
 medical  bill,  and shall [require the hospital to refrain from sending]
 NOT SEND an account to  collection  [if  the  patient  has  submitted  a
 completed application for financial aid, including any required support-
 ing documentation, while the hospital determines the patient's eligibil-
 ity  for such aid.  Such policies and procedures] UNTIL THE HOSPITAL HAS
 DETERMINED THAT THE PATIENT IS NOT ELIGIBLE  FOR  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE.
 THE  UNIFORM  POLICY SHALL PROHIBIT THE SALE OR TRANSFER OF MEDICAL DEBT
 ACCUMULATED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION TO A THIRD PARTY, UNLESS THE  THIRD
 PARTY  EXPLICITLY  PURCHASES  SUCH  MEDICAL DEBT IN ORDER TO RELIEVE THE
 DEBT OF THE PATIENT.  THE  UNIFORM  POLICY  shall  provide  for  written
 notification,  which  shall include notification on a patient bill, to a
 patient not less than thirty days prior to the  referral  of  debts  for
 collection  and  shall  require  that  the  collection agency obtain the
 hospital's written consent prior to commencing a legal  action.  [Such
 policies  and  procedures]  THE UNIFORM POLICY SHALL PROHIBIT A HOSPITAL
 FROM COMMENCING A LEGAL ACTION RELATED TO THE RECOVERY OF  MEDICAL  DEBT
 OR  UNPAID  BILLS  AGAINST PATIENTS WITH INCOMES AT OR BELOW SIX HUNDRED
 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IN ANY LEGAL ACTION RELATED TO THE
 RECOVERY OF MEDICAL DEBT OR UNPAID BILLS BY OR ON BEHALF OF A  HOSPITAL,
 THE  COMPLAINT  SHALL  BE  ACCOMPANIED BY AN AFFIDAVIT BY THE HOSPITAL'S
 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER STATING THAT BASED UPON THE  HOSPITAL'S  REASON-
 ABLE EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE PATIENT'S INCOME, THE PATIENT WHOM THEY ARE
 TAKING  LEGAL  ACTION  AGAINST  DOES  NOT HAVE AN INCOME AT OR BELOW SIX
 HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE UNIFORM  POLICY  shall
 require  all  general  hospital staff who interact with patients or have
 responsibility for billing and collections to be trained in [such  poli-
 cies  and procedures] THE UNIFORM POLICY, and require the implementation
 of a mechanism for the general hospital to measure its  compliance  with
 [such  policies  and  procedures] THE UNIFORM POLICY. [Such policies and
 procedures] THE UNIFORM POLICY shall require that any collection agency,
 OR AGENT OF THE GENERAL HOSPITAL under contract with a general  hospital
 for  the  collection of debts follow the hospital's financial assistance
 policy, including providing information to patients on how to apply  for
 financial  assistance  where appropriate. [Such policies and procedures]
 THE UNIFORM POLICY shall prohibit collections  from  a  patient  who  is
 determined  to  be eligible for medical assistance pursuant to title XIX
 of the federal social security act at the time  services  were  rendered
 and for which services medicaid payment is available.

  § 6. Subparagraphs 1 and 2  of  paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  2  of

 of 2018, are amended to read as follows:
  (1) In establishing standards  for  determining  eligibility  for  and
 amount  of  such assistance, the department shall take into account only
 such income [and resources], in accordance with federal requirements, as
 [are] IS available to the applicant or recipient and  as  would  not  be
 required  to  be  disregarded  or  set aside for future needs, and there
 shall be a reasonable evaluation of any such income [or resources].  The
 department  shall  not  consider  the  availability  of an option for an
 accelerated payment of death benefits or special surrender value  pursu-
 ant  to  paragraph  one  of  subsection  (a) of section one thousand one
 hundred thirteen of the insurance law, or an  option  to  enter  into  a
 viatical  settlement pursuant to the provisions of article seventy-eight
 of the insurance law, as an available resource in determining  eligibil-
 ity  for  an  amount  of  such  assistance,  provided, however, that the
 payment of such benefits shall be considered in determining  eligibility
 for and amount of such assistance. There shall not be taken into consid-
 eration the financial responsibility of any individual for any applicant
 or  recipient  of  assistance  under this title unless such applicant or
 recipient is such individual's spouse or such individual's child who  is
 under twenty-one years of age. In determining the eligibility of a child
 who  is categorically eligible as blind or disabled, as determined under
 regulations prescribed by the social security act  for  medical  assist-
 ance,  the  income  [and resources] of parents or spouses of parents are
 not considered available to that child if [she/he] "THE CHILD" does  not
 regularly  share  the  common household even if the child returns to the
 common household for periodic visits. In the application of standards of
 eligibility with respect to income, costs  incurred  for  medical  care,
 whether  in  the form of insurance premiums or otherwise, shall be taken
 into account. Any person who is eligible for, or reasonably  appears  to
 meet  the criteria of eligibility for, benefits under title XVIII of the
 federal social security act shall be required to  apply  for  and  fully
 utilize such benefits in accordance with this chapter.
  (2) In evaluating the income [and resources] available to an applicant
 for  or  recipient  of  medical  assistance, for purposes of determining
 eligibility for and the amount of such assistance, the  department  must
 consider  assets [held in or] paid from trusts created by such applicant
 or recipient, as determined pursuant to the regulations of  the  depart-
 ment, in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph.
  (i) In the case of a revocable trust created by an applicant or recip-
 ient,  as  determined  pursuant  to  regulations of the department: [the
 trust corpus must be considered to be an available  resource;]  payments
 made from the trust to or for the benefit of such applicant or recipient
 must  be  considered to be available income; and any other payments from
 S. 8307--B  77
 
 the trust must be considered to be assets disposed of by such  applicant
 or  recipient  for purposes of paragraph (d) of subdivision five of this
 section.
  (ii)  In  the  case of an irrevocable trust created by an applicant or
 recipient, as determined pursuant to regulations of the department:  any
 portion  of  the  trust corpus, and of the income generated by the trust
 corpus, from which no payment can under any  circumstances  be  made  to
 such applicant or recipient must be considered, as of the date of estab-
 lishment  of  the  trust, or, if later, the date on which payment to the
 applicant or recipient is foreclosed, to be assets disposed of  by  such
 applicant or recipient for purposes of paragraph (d) of subdivision five
 of  this  section;  [any  portion of the trust corpus, and of the income
 generated by the trust corpus, from which payment could be  made  to  or
 for  the benefit of such applicant or recipient must be considered to be
 an available resource;] payments made from the trust to or for the bene-
 fit of such applicant or recipient must be considered  to  be  available
 income;  and  any other payments from the trust must be considered to be
 assets disposed of by such applicant or recipient for purposes of  para-
 graph (d) of subdivision five of this section.
  (iii)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) of this
 subparagraph, in the case of an applicant or recipient who is  disabled,
 as  such  term  is  defined  in section 1614(a)(3) of the federal social
 security act, the department must not consider as available  income  [or
 resources]  the  [corpus or] income of the following trusts which comply
 with the provisions of the regulations authorized by clause (iv) of this
 subparagraph: (A) a trust containing the assets of such a disabled indi-
 vidual which was established for the benefit of the disabled  individual
 while  such individual was under sixty-five years of age by the individ-
 ual, a parent, grandparent, legal guardian, or court of competent juris-
 diction, if upon the death of such individual the state will receive all
 amounts remaining in the trust up to the  total  value  of  all  medical
 assistance paid on behalf of such individual; (B) and a trust containing
 the  assets  of  such a disabled individual established and managed by a
 non-profit association which maintains separate accounts for the benefit
 of disabled individuals, but, for purposes of investment and  management
 of  trust funds, pools the accounts, provided that accounts in the trust
 fund are established solely for the benefit of individuals who are disa-
 bled as such term is defined in section 1614(a)(3) of the federal social
 security act by such disabled individual, a parent,  grandparent,  legal
 guardian,  or  court  of  competent jurisdiction, and to the extent that
 amounts remaining in the individual's account are not  retained  by  the
 trust  upon the death of the individual, the state will receive all such
 remaining amounts up to the total value of all medical  assistance  paid
 on  behalf of such individual.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary,
 a not-for-profit corporation may, in furtherance of and as an adjunct to
 its corporate purposes, act as trustee of a trust for persons with disa-
 bilities established pursuant to this subclause, provided that  a  trust
 company, as defined in subdivision seven of section one hundred-c of the
 banking law, acts as co-trustee.
  (iv) The department shall promulgate such regulations as may be neces-
 sary  to carry out the provisions of this subparagraph. Such regulations
 shall include provisions for:  assuring  the  fulfillment  of  fiduciary
 obligations of the trustee with respect to the remainder interest of the
 department or state; monitoring pooled trusts; applying this subdivision
 to  legal instruments and other devices similar to trusts, in accordance
 with applicable federal rules and regulations; and  establishing  proce-
 S. 8307--B  78
 
 dures  under  which  the  application of this subdivision will be waived
 with respect to an applicant or recipient  who  demonstrates  that  such
 application  would  work  an undue hardship on him or her, in accordance
 with  standards  specified by the secretary of the federal department of
 health and human services. Such regulations may require: notification of
 the department of the creation or funding of such a trust for the  bene-
 fit of an applicant for or recipient of medical assistance; notification
 of the department of the death of a beneficiary of such a trust who is a
 current  or  former  recipient  of  medical assistance; in the case of a
 trust, the corpus of which exceeds one hundred thousand dollars, notifi-
 cation of  the  department  of  transactions  tending  to  substantially
 deplete  the  trust corpus; notification of the department of any trans-
 actions involving transfers from the trust corpus  for  less  than  fair
 market value; the bonding of the trustee when the assets of such a trust
 equal  or exceed one million dollars, unless a court of competent juris-
 diction waives such requirement; and the bonding of the trustee when the
 assets of such a trust are less than one million dollars, upon order  of
 a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction. The department, together with the
 department of financial services, shall promulgate regulations governing
 the establishment,  management  and  monitoring  of  trusts  established
 pursuant  to subclause (B) of clause (iii) of this subparagraph in which
 a not-for-profit corporation and a trust company serve as co-trustees.
  (v) Notwithstanding any acts, omissions or failures to act of a  trus-
 tee  of a trust which the department or a local social services official
 has determined complies with the provisions  of  clause  (iii)  and  the
 regulations  authorized by clause (iv) of this subparagraph, the depart-
 ment must not consider the [corpus or]  income  of  any  such  trust  as
 available  income  [or  resources]  of the applicant or recipient who is
 disabled, as such term is defined in section 1614(a)(3) of  the  federal
 social  security  act.  The department's remedy for redress of any acts,
 omissions or failures to act by such a trustee which acts, omissions  or
 failures  are  considered  by the department to be inconsistent with the
 terms of the trust, contrary to applicable laws and regulations  of  the
 department,  or  contrary  to  the  fiduciary obligations of the trustee
 shall be the commencement of an action or proceeding  under  subdivision
 one  of section sixty-three of the executive law to safeguard or enforce
 the state's remainder interest in the trust, or  such  other  action  or
 proceeding  as  may be lawful and appropriate as to assure compliance by
 the trustee or to safeguard and enforce the state's  remainder  interest
 in the trust.
  (vi)  The  department shall provide written notice to an applicant for
 or recipient of medical assistance who is or reasonably  appears  to  be
 eligible  for  medical  assistance  except  for  having income exceeding
 applicable income levels. The  notice  shall  inform  the  applicant  or
 recipient,  in plain language, that in certain circumstances the medical
 assistance program does not count the income of disabled applicants  and
 recipients  if it is placed in a trust described in clause (iii) of this
 subparagraph. The notice shall be included with the  eligibility  notice
 provided  to  such  applicants  and recipients and shall reference where
 additional information may be found on the  department's  website.  This
 clause  shall  not  be construed to change any criterion for eligibility
 for medical assistance.

 services  law, as amended by chapter 110 of the laws of 1971, is amended

 S. 8307--B  79
 
  (a) Medical assistance shall  be  furnished  to  applicants  in  cases
 where,  although  such  applicant has a responsible relative with suffi-
 cient income [and resources] to provide medical assistance as determined
 by the regulations of the department, the income [and resources] of  the
 responsible  relative are not available to such applicant because of the
 absence of such relative or the refusal or failure of such  relative  to
 provide  the necessary care and assistance.  In such cases, however, the
 furnishing of such assistance shall create an implied contract with such
 relative, and the cost thereof may be recovered from  such  relative  in
 accordance  with  title  six  of article three OF THIS CHAPTER and other
 applicable provisions of law.

  (a) The commissioner shall, subject  to  the  approval  of  the  state
 director  of  the  budget,  establish  capitated  rates  of  payment for
 services provided by assisted living programs as  defined  by  paragraph
 (a) of subdivision one of section four hundred sixty-one-l of the social
 services  law.  Such rates of payment shall be related to costs incurred
 by residential health care facilities. The rates shall reflect the  wage
 equalization  factor  established  by  the  commissioner for residential
 health care facilities in  the  region  in  which  the  assisted  living
 program is provided and real property capital construction costs associ-
 ated  with  the  construction of a free-standing assisted living program
 such rate shall include a payment equal to the cost of interest owed and
 depreciation costs of such construction. The rates  shall  also  reflect
 the  efficient  provision  of  a  quality  and  quantity  of services to
 patients in such residential health care facilities, with needs compara-
 ble to the needs of residents served in such assisted  living  programs.
 Such  rates  of  payment  shall be equal to fifty percent of the amounts
 which otherwise would have been expended, based upon the  [mean  prices]
 COSTS  for  [the  first  of July, nineteen hundred ninety-two (utilizing
 nineteen hundred eighty-three costs)] TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-TWO  OR  NEWER
 for  freestanding[,  low  intensity]  residential health care facilities
 with less than three hundred beds[, and for years subsequent to nineteen
 hundred ninety-two,] adjusted  for  inflation  in  accordance  with  the
 provisions of subdivision ten of section twenty-eight hundred seven-c of
 this  chapter,  to  provide the appropriate level of care for such resi-
 dents in residential health  care  facilities  in  the  applicable  wage
 equalization factor regions plus an amount equal to capital construction
 costs  associated  with  the  construction of an assisted living program
 facility as provided for in this  subdivision.  SUCH  RATES  OF  PAYMENT
 SHALL  BE UPDATED TO REFLECT THE MOST CURRENT MEAN PRICE FOR FREE-STAND-
 ING RESIDENTIAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES WITH LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED BEDS
 EACH TIME THAT THE COST BASIS OF RESIDENTIAL HEALTH CARE FACILITY  RATES
 IS  UPDATED. The commissioner shall also promulgate regulations, and may
 promulgate emergency regulations, to provide for  reimbursement  of  the
 cost  of  preadmission assessments conducted directly by assisted living
 programs.
  § 2. This act shall take effect April 1, 2025.

 follows:
  (vi) "look-back  period"  means  the  sixty-month  period  immediately
 preceding the date that an institutionalized individual is both institu-
 tionalized  and has applied for medical assistance[, or in the case of a
 non-institutionalized individual, subject to federal approval, the thir-
 ty-month period immediately preceding the date  that  such  non-institu-
 tionalized  individual  applies  for medical assistance coverage of long
 term care services. Nothing herein precludes a review of eligibility for

  Section  1. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby declares that
 poor maternal and infant health outcomes, especially when  it  comes  to
 racial disparities, are a public health crisis that pose a threat to the
 health,  welfare,  and  quality of life of child bearing people, infants
 and their families. The legislature hereby acknowledges that  community-
 based  doula  care  is  one  solution  in  addressing this public health
 crisis. The legislature also acknowledges imbalances in how  doula  care
 is  accessed in different communities. The legislature also acknowledges
 how doulas in the BIPOC community are integrated,  or  lack  integration
 into  the  maternal  health continuum. The legislature acknowledges that
 those seeking to become  community-based  doulas  face  a  multitude  of
 barriers,  including  institutional  barriers,  within  the  healthcare
 continuum. The legislature hereby finds the importance in establishing a
 S. 8307--B  90
 
 dedicated fund to support  community-based  doulas  and  community-based
 doula  organizations. This fund would be assisting those trying to navi-
 gate the Federal and State Medicaid frameworks for doula care to  become
 community-based  doulas. Which would be one step in solving the existing
 barriers to those seeking equitable prenatal, intranatal, and postpartum
 care services.
