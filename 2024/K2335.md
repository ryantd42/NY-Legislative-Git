  CELEBRATING  the  courage  and bravery of New York
  State's Korean War Veterans and recognizing the  men
  and  women  who served with dignity and honor during
  this historic time period
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the United States Armed Forces,  who  served  so
faithfully and courageously in wars in which our Nation's freedom was at
stake, as well as in the preservation of peace during peacetime, deserve
the highest commendation of this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  June  25,  1950,  communist  North  Korea  invaded the
Republic of Korea with approximately 135,000 troops, thereby  initiating
the Korean War; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 27, 1950, President Harry Truman ordered the United
States  Armed Forces to help the Republic of Korea defend itself against
the North Korean invasion; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hostilities ended in a cease-fire marked by the signing  of
the  armistice  at  Panmunjom  on  July 27, 1953, although the peninsula
still technically remains in a state of war; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the Korean War, approximately 1,789,000  members  of
the  United  States Armed Forces served in theater along with the forces
of the Republic of Korea and 20 other members of the United  Nations  to
defend freedom and democracy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Casualties  in  the  United States Armed Forces during the
Korean War included 54,246 dead (of whom  33,739  were  battle  deaths),
more  than 103,284 wounded, and approximately 8,055 listed as missing in
action or prisoners of war; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Korean War Veterans Recognition Act was enacted on July
27, 2009, so that the honorable service and noble sacrifice  by  members
of  the  United  States  Armed  Forces  in  the Korean War will never be
forgotten; and
 
  WHEREAS, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation  to  designate
July  27,  2009,  as  the National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day and
called upon Americans to display flags at half-staff in  memory  of  the
Korean War veterans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since 1975, the Republic of Korea has invited thousands of
American Korean War  veterans,  including  members  of  the  Korean  War
Veterans  Association,  to  revisit  Korea  in  appreciation  for  their
sacrifices; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the 74 years since the outbreak of the Korean  War,  the
Republic  of  Korea  has emerged from a war-torn economy into one of the
major economies in the world and one of the largest trading partners  of
the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the Republic of Korea is among the closest allies of
the United States, having contributed troops in support of United States
operations  during the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan, while also supporting numerous United Nations  peacekeeping
missions throughout the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  the ashes of war and the sharing of spilled blood on
the battlefield, the United  States  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  have
continuously  stood  shoulder-to-shoulder  to  promote  and  defend
international peace and security, economic prosperity, human rights, and
the rule of law both on the Korean Peninsula and beyond; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
recognize  and  celebrate  Korean War Veterans in the State of New York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of  this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed  be
transmitted  to  Commander Salvatore "Sal" Scarlato, Korean War Veterans
Association Department of New York.
