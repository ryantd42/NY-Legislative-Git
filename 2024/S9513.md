 CORPORATION, ASSOCIATION, GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY, OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY.

 BILITY OF DIRECT HUMAN INTERVENTION FROM WITHIN OR ON THE AIRCRAFT.
  4.  "UNMANNED  AIRCRAFT SYSTEM" MEANS AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT AND ASSOCI-
 ATED ELEMENTS, INCLUDING COMMUNICATION LINKS AND COMPONENTS THAT CONTROL
 THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR  THE  PILOT  IN  COMMAND  TO
