  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 30, 2024, as World Bipolar Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 30, 2024, as Bipolar
Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
World Bipolar Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Bipolar  Day  (WBD) will be celebrated each year on
March 30th, the birthday of  Vincent  Van  Gogh,  who  was  posthumously
diagnosed as probably having bipolar disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  vision  of WBD is to bring world awareness to bipolar
disorders  and  eliminate  social  stigma;  through  international
collaboration,  the  goal  of  World  Bipolar  Day is to bring the world
population information about bipolar disorders  that  will  educate  and
improve sensitivity towards the illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bipolar  Disorder  is  a  mental illness that represents a
significant challenge to patients, health care workers,  family  members
and our communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  growing acceptance of bipolar disorder as a medical
condition, like diabetes and heart disease, has taken hold in some parts
of the world, unfortunately the stigma associated with the illness is  a
barrier  to  care  and continues to impede early diagnosis and effective
treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mental  illnesses  have  historically  been  misunderstood,
feared  and  therefore  stigmatized;  the  stigma  is  due  to a lack of
education, false information, ignorance, or a need to feel superior; and
 
  WHEREAS, Its effects are especially painful and  damaging  to  one's
self-esteem;  it  leaves  people  with  mental  illnesses  feeling  like
outcasts from society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Whether the perceived stigma is real  or  not,  it  is  the
subjective  interpretation  that  affects  the  person's  feelings  of
belonging; and
 
  WHEREAS, Like most groups who are stigmatized, there are many  myths
surrounding mental illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  order to address the disparity in how bipolar disorder
is viewed in different parts of the world, the Asian Network of  Bipolar
Disorder  (ANBD),  the  International Bipolar Foundation (IBPF), and the
 
International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) came together to work
on the concept of a world bipolar day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People  who  live  with bipolar disorder are encouraged to
remember that they can accomplish great things  even  though  they  have
been diagnosed with bipolar disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 30, 2024,  as  World
Bipolar Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  the  Asian  Network of Bipolar Disorder (ANBD); the International
Bipolar Foundation (IBPF); and the  International  Society  for  Bipolar
Disorders (ISBD).
