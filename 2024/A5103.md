 within  a  Part  identified as Parts A through B. The effective date for
 each particular provision contained within such Part is set forth in the
 last section of such Part. Any provision in any section contained within
 a Part, including the effective date of the Part, which makes  a  refer-
 ence  to  a  section  "of  this  act", when used in connection with that
 particular component, shall be deemed to mean and refer  to  the  corre-
 sponding section of the Part in which it is found. Section three of this
 act sets forth the general effective date of this act.
 
  PART A

 by section 11 of part S of chapter 85 of the laws of 2002, is amended to

  (cc) Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,
 receipts  from  the sale of mobile telecommunications service [by a home

 customer's place of primary use is within a taxing jurisdiction  outside
 this state].
  §  2.  Paragraphs  (a) and (h) of subdivision 1 and paragraph (a) of
 subdivision 2 of section 186-e of the tax law, paragraph (a) of subdivi-
 sion 1 as amended by section 2 and paragraph (h)  of  subdivision  1  as
 added  by  section  3  of  part S of chapter 85 of the laws of 2002, and
 paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 as amended by section  2  of  part  P  of
 chapter 59 of the laws of 2015, are amended to read as follows:
  (a) [(1)] "Gross receipt" means the amount received in or by reason of
 any  sale, conditional or otherwise, of telecommunication services or in
 or by reason of the furnishing  of  telecommunication  services.  [Gross
 receipt from the sale of mobile telecommunications service provided by a
 home  service  provider  shall  include "charges for mobile telecommuni-
 cations service" as described in paragraph one  of  subdivision  (l)  of
 section  eleven  hundred eleven of this chapter, regardless of where the
 mobile  telecommunications  service  originates,  terminates  or  passes
 through.]  Gross  receipt  is  expressed in money, whether paid in cash,
 credit or property of any kind or nature, and shall be determined  with-
 out  any  deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the service sold
 or the cost of materials, labor or services used or other costs,  inter-
 est or discount paid, or any other expenses whatsoever except that there
 shall,  however,  be  allowed  a deduction for bad debts with respect to
 charges previously subjected to the tax  hereunder  when  the  debt  has
 become  worthless in accordance with generally accepted accounting prin-
 ciples consistently applied by the taxpayer. "Amount received"  for  the
 purpose of the definition of gross receipt, as the term gross receipt is
 used throughout this article, means the amount charged for the provision
 of a telecommunication service.
  [(2)  (A)  Any  charge  for  a  service or property billed by or for a
 mobile telecommunications customer's  home  service  provider  shall  be
 deemed  to be provided by such mobile telecommunications customer's home
 service provider.
  (B) Charges for mobile telecommunications service that are provided or
 deemed to be provided by a  mobile  telecommunications  customer's  home
 service  provider  shall be sourced to the taxing jurisdiction where the
 mobile telecommunications customer's place of primary  use  is  located,
 regardless  of  where  the mobile telecommunications service originates,
 terminates or passes through.]
  [(h) For the purpose of applying the provisions  of  this  section  to
 mobile  telecommunications  service,  the  following  terms when used in
 relation to mobile telecommunications service shall be defined  as  such
 terms are defined in section eleven hundred one of this chapter: "mobile
 telecommunications service," "mobile telecommunications customer," "home
 service  provider," "licensed service area," "reseller," "serving carri-
 er," "place of primary use" and "taxing jurisdiction".]
  (a) [(1)] There is hereby imposed an excise tax on the sale  of  tele-
 communication services[, except for the sale of mobile telecommunication
 services  that  are  subject to tax under subparagraph two of this para-
 graph, by any person which is a provider of telecommunication services,]
 to be paid by such person, at the rate of  three  and  one-half  percent
 prior  to  October  first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, three and one-
 quarter  percent  from  October  first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-eight
 through December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, and two and
 one-half  percent  on  and  after  January  first, two thousand of gross
 receipt from: (i) any intrastate telecommunication  services;  (ii)  any
 interstate  and  international  telecommunication  services  (other than
 A. 5103  3
 
 interstate and international private telecommunication  services)  which
 originate  or  terminate  in  this  state  and  which  telecommunication
 services are charged to a service address in this state,  regardless  of
 where  the  amounts  charged  for such services are billed or ultimately
 paid; and (iii) interstate and international  private  telecommunication
 services, the gross receipt to which the tax shall apply shall be deter-
 mined as prescribed in subdivision three of this section.
  [(2) There is hereby imposed an excise tax on the sale of mobile tele-
 communication  services, by any person which is a provider of telecommu-
 nication services, to be paid by such person, at the  rate  of  two  and
 nine-tenths  percent  on  and  after  May first, two thousand fifteen of
 gross receipts from any mobile telecommunications service provided by  a
 home  service  provider  where  the mobile telecommunications customer's
 place of primary use is within this state.]
  § 3. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 186-e of the tax law is
 amended by adding a new subparagraph 5 to read as follows:
  (5) MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EXCLUSION. THE SALE OF MOBILE TELECOMMU-
 NICATION SERVICE SHALL  IN  NO  EVENT  CONSTITUTE  A  TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 SERVICE,  AND THE RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH SERVICE ARE WITHOUT THE
 SCOPE OF THE TAX IMPOSED BY THIS SECTION.
  § 4. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 186-c of the  tax  law,
 as  amended by section 1 of part P of chapter 59 of the laws of 2015, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (b) [(1)] In addition to the surcharge imposed  by  paragraph  (a)  of
 this  subdivision,  there  is  hereby  imposed  a surcharge on the gross
 receipts from telecommunication services[, except for the gross receipts
 from mobile telecommunication services that are  subject  to  tax  under
 subparagraph two of this paragraph,] relating to the metropolitan commu-
 ter  transportation  district  at  the  rate of seventeen percent of the
 state tax rate under section one hundred eighty-six-e of  this  article.
 All  the definitions and other provisions of section one hundred eighty-
 six-e of this article shall apply to the tax imposed  by  this  subpara-
 graph with such modification and limitation as may be necessary (includ-
 ing  substituting  the  words  "metropolitan  commuter  transportation
 district" for "state" where appropriate) in order to adapt the  language
 of  such  section  one  hundred  eighty-six-e  of  this  article  to the
 surcharge imposed by this subparagraph within such metropolitan commuter
 transportation district so as to include (i) any intra-district telecom-
 munication services, (ii) any inter-district telecommunication  services
 which  originate  or  terminate  in  such  district and are charged to a
 service address therein regardless of where the amounts charged for such
 services are billed or ultimately paid, and (iii) as apportioned to such
 district, private telecommunication services. Provided however, such tax
 surcharge shall be calculated as if the tax imposed  under  section  one
 hundred eighty-six-e of this article were imposed at a rate of three and
 one-half percent.
  [(2)  In  addition  to  the surcharge imposed by paragraph (a) of this
 subdivision, there is hereby imposed a surcharge on the  gross  receipts
 from  mobile  telecommunication  services  relating  to the metropolitan
 commuter transportation district at the rate of  seven-tenths  and  two-
 hundredths  and one-thousandth percent on and after May first, two thou-
 sand fifteen. All the definitions and other provisions  of  section  one
 hundred  eighty-six-e  of this article shall apply to the tax imposed by
 this subparagraph with such modification and limitation as may be neces-
 sary (including substituting the words "metropolitan commuter  transpor-
 tation  district"  for  "state" where appropriate) in order to adapt the
 A. 5103  4

 language of such section one hundred eighty-six-e of this article to the
 surcharge imposed by this subparagraph within such metropolitan commuter
 transportation district so as to include any  mobile  telecommunications
 service  provided by a home service provider where the mobile telecommu-
 nications customer's place of primary use is  within  such  metropolitan
 commuter transportation district.]
  §  5.  This  act  shall  take effect on the first day of the sales tax
 quarterly period, as described in subdivision (b) of section 1136 of the
 tax law, beginning at least ninety days after the date  this  act  shall
 have  become  a  law  and  shall apply in accordance with the applicable
 transitional provisions of sections 1106 and 1217 of the tax law.
