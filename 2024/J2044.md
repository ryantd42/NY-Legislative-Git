BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  COMMEMORATING  the 30th Anniversary of WSKS/WSKU -
  97.9/105.5 CNY KISS FM  of  the  greater  Utica-Rome
  area
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body that the quality
and character of life in this great Empire State is  indelibly  enriched
by  the  faithful  and  untiring  efforts  of those individuals who have
helped shape the history of broadcasting in their area; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-  standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body is justly proud to
commemorate the 30th Anniversary of WSKS/WSKU - 97.9/105.5 CNY  KISS  FM
of the greater Utica-Rome area; and
 
  WHEREAS, WSKU signed on the air in 1990 as WOWB-FM, 105.5 (WOW 105),
licensed  to Little Falls, New York; the station was licensed to Towpath
Communications Limited as an adult-contemporary station,  and,  after  a
brief stint as "B105," it became "Wow 105"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The station was soon sold to the Professional Broadcasting
Corporation (a joint venture of Frank DuRoss and Ken Roser), who added a
simulcast on WOWZ at 97.9 FM in September 1994; licensed to  Whitesboro,
New  York,  it was the first allocation of 97.9 in the Utica market; the
resulting simulcast was identified as "Wow-FM"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Now known as "The Beat of Central New York," "Wow-FM"  went
in  a  dance direction under the purview of Program Director J.P. Marks,
the nighttime air personality under the adult contemporary format; and
 
  WHEREAS, WOWZ and WOWB were sold to Clear Channel Communications  in
2000;  the Top 40 Rhythmic format was abandoned and in 2001, WOWB became
WSKU and WOWZ became WSKS, while the Top 40 programming  and  "KISS  FM"
branding  previously  heard under the WSKS call letters at 102.5 FM (now
WUMX) moved to WSKS/WSKU; and
 
  WHEREAS, Clear Channel closed its operations in Utica, New  York  in
2007,  and the KISS FM stations on 97.9 WSKS and 105.5 WSKU were sold to
former co-owner Ken Roser, through his company Roser Communications; the
format and branding of the stations remained  the  same,  under  program
director and air personality Shaun Andrews; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the past three decades, WSKS/WSKU has flourished
and  broadened  its  programming,  becoming more popular with increasing
support from the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of WSKS/WSKU is in direct  correlation  to  the
efforts  of  its  members,  whose  involvement  is, and always has been,
characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
an  uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of
the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
those illustrious broadcasters who  have  diligently  and  consistently,
 
year  after  year, recorded the history of their communities and brought
local news and news  of  the  larger  world  to  their  listeners;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 30th Anniversary of WSKS/WSKU - 97.9/105.5 CNY  KISS  FM
of the greater Utica-Rome area; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to WSKS/WSKU - 97.9/105.5 CNY KISS FM.
