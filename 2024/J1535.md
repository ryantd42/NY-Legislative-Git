  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 25, 2024, as Malaria Day in the State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
conditions that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 25, 2024, as Malaria
Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of
World Malaria Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Malaria remains both  a  major  cause  and  consequence  of
global  poverty  and  inequity;  its  burden  is  greatest  in the least
developed areas and among the poorest members of society;  many  of  the
vulnerable,  especially  young children and pregnant women, are not able
to access the life-saving prevention, diagnosis  and  treatment  the  so
urgently need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2015,  there were 212 new cases of malaria and 429,000
deaths in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite the tremendous set of achievements the World Health
Organization has succeeded with, approximately 3.2 billion people  still
remain  at  risk  of  malaria  and  over  200 million cases are reported
annually; and
 
  WHEREAS, Currently, the Center for Disease Control is  committed  to
expanding  proven  malaria  control  strategies worldwide, including the
distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets, rapid diagnostics tests,
and intermittent preventative treatment in pregnancy; and
 
  WHEREAS, While local transmission of malaria was eliminated from the
United States in the early 1950s, the Center for Disease Control remains
vigilant to detect, and help clinicians respond to,  cases  of  imported
malaria each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2013, over 1,700 cases of imported malaria was reported
by United States physicians, the highest since  the  tracking  began  in
1973;  rapidly  responding to these imported cases is critical to saving
lives and to preventing reintroduction of locally transmitted malaria in
the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body recognizes the importance of  Malaria
Day  in  promoting  public  and  media  attention  to the seriousness of
malaria, and for working to improve education about its causes  and  its
treatment,  as  well  as  how to help those who are struggling with this
debilitating condition; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 25, 2024, as Malaria
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
