 Introduced  by M. of A. PRETLOW -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Children and Families
 
 AN ACT to amend the social services law, in relation to  establishing  a
  demonstration  program  implementing the Westchester county dual track
  child protective services system; and providing for the repeal of such
  provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares  that  the  challenge  facing  this  state's  child  protective
 services program demands that a bold new approach be tested to determine
 how  this  state can fulfill its obligations to protect and defend chil-
 dren, provide for their health, safety and welfare, and also make neces-
 sary services and assistance available to families in a less  confronta-
 tional  and  intrusive  manner,  when  circumstances  so  warrant.  By
 establishing a system in Westchester county, where complaints of alleged
 child abuse and maltreatment are assigned to either an investigatory  or
 a family assessment and services track, it is the intent of the legisla-
 ture  to  study and review alternative methods of fulfilling those obli-
 gations and, at the same time, initiate the  delivery  of  comprehensive
 family rehabilitative services to children and families.
  §  2.  Short  title.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as the
 "Westchester county dual track demonstration program".
  § 3. The social services law is amended by adding a new section  423-b
 to read as follows:
  § 423-B. WESTCHESTER COUNTY DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM TO ASSESS THE FEASI-
 BILITY  OF  ENHANCING  ALTERNATIVE CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES THROUGH THE
 USE OF A DUAL TRACK APPROACH. 1. (A) THE OFFICE OF CHILDREN  AND  FAMILY
 SERVICES  IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED AND DIRECTED TO ESTABLISH A DEMONSTRATION
 PROGRAM IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY TO ADDRESS THE  FEASIBILITY  OF  ENHANCING

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 GATION.  THE  NOTICE  SHALL  ALSO EXPLAIN THAT THE WORKERS ASSISTING THE

 TERS  WHO  ARE  REQUIRED TO REPORT SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR MALTREATMENT

 THEY  RECEIVE  IN  THEIR  WORK WITH THE FAMILY IF THAT INFORMATION GIVES
 THEM REASONABLE CAUSE TO SUSPECT THAT A CHILD IN THE FAMILY IS AN ABUSED
 OR MALTREATED CHILD;
  (2) AN EXAMINATION,  WITH  THE  FAMILY,  OF  THE  FAMILY'S  STRENGTHS,
 CONCERNS AND NEEDS;

 ELIGIBLE  TO  BE  INCLUDED  IN THE FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND SERVICES TRACK,
 PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE ACTIVITIES  DESCRIBED
 IN  PARAGRAPHS  (C)  AND (D) OF THIS SUBDIVISION MAY BE PERFORMED BY THE
 SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ANY OTHER METHOD  CURRENTLY

 TO SUBPARAGRAPH TWO OF PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THAT A  REPORT
 MUST BE INVESTIGATED AS A CASE OF SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR MALTREATMENT,
 THE COMMUNITY-BASED AGENCY SHALL SO INFORM THE SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT,

 SERVICES INVESTIGATION IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE  REQUIREMENTS  OF  THIS
 TITLE.
  (F)  A  REPORT  SELECTED  FOR  INCLUSION  IN THE FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND
 SERVICES TRACK SHALL CEASE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN SUCH TRACK IF

 TY-BASED AGENCY FINDS THAT:
  (1) THERE IS EVIDENCE OF ANY OF THE  ACTS  LISTED  IN  PARAGRAPHS  (A)
 THROUGH (I) OF SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION; OR
  (2)  THE  PARENT  OR  PARENTS REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH THE DISTRICT OR
 COMMUNITY-BASED AGENCY IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING A PLAN  TO  ADDRESS
 THE  FAMILY  PROBLEMS OR ISSUES AND A WORKER ASSISTING THE FAMILY IN THE
 FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND SERVICES TRACK HAS  REASONABLE  CAUSE  TO  SUSPECT
 THAT A CHILD IN THE FAMILY IS AN ABUSED OR MALTREATED CHILD.
  (G)  WHERE THE DISTRICT FINDS OR IS ADVISED BY A COMMUNITY-BASED AGEN-
 CY, SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPLETION OF THE INITIAL SAFETY CHECK,  THAT  THE
 REPORT  IS  NOT  APPROPRIATE  TO  CONTINUE  IN THE FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND
 SERVICES TRACK PURSUANT  TO  PARAGRAPH  (F)  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION,  THE
 DISTRICT SHALL CONTACT THE STATEWIDE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CHILD ABUSE AND
 MALTREATMENT AND MAKE A NEW REPORT OF SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE OR MALTREAT-
 MENT.
  (H)  IN ANY CASE WHERE A REPORT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE INVESTIGATORY
 TRACK, BUT AFTER SUCH INITIAL  ASSIGNMENT  THE  DISTRICT  OR  A  SERVICE
 PROVIDER  DETERMINES  THAT BECAUSE OF ANY INFORMATION IT RECEIVES DURING
 THE INVESTIGATION, OR DURING THE PROVISION OF CARE  AND  SERVICES,  THAT
 SUCH  REPORT  SHOULD  BE REMOVED AND PLACED IN THE FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND
 SERVICES TRACK, THE DISTRICT  SHALL  SO  NOTIFY  THE  STATEWIDE  CENTRAL
 REGISTER OF CHILD ABUSE AND MALTREATMENT THAT IT IS NOW CONSIDERING SUCH
 REPORT  AS  PART  OF  THE  FAMILY  ASSESSMENT AND SERVICES TRACK, AND IS
 A. 4541  6

 THE STATEWIDE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CHILD ABUSE AND MALTREATMENT, AND SUCH
 SUBSEQUENT REPORT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN THE FAMILY ASSESSMENT
 AND  SERVICES  TRACK, THE LOCAL CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES, IN CONDUCTING
 ITS INVESTIGATION, SHALL WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH ANY DISTRICT OR  COMMU-
 NITY-BASED  AGENCY  STAFF  THAT  ARE  ALREADY WORKING WITH THE FAMILY TO
 MINIMIZE TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE THE  CHANCE  THAT  EXISTING  SERVICES
 BEING  PROVIDED  TO  THE FAMILY WILL BE DISRUPTED AND TO MAXIMIZE TO THE
 EXTENT PRACTICABLE THE  COORDINATION  OF  THE  EXISTING  SERVICES  BEING
 PROVIDED TO THE FAMILY WITH ANY NEW SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE FAMI-
 LY.
  (J)  THE  DISTRICT  SHALL INCLUDE IN THE TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES CHARGED
 WITH MAKING ANY OF THE REFERRALS TO, AND INVESTIGATIONS  OR  ASSESSMENTS
 IN  EITHER  OF  THE  TWO  TRACKS TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY INSTANCES WHERE,
 ALTHOUGH REPORTS WERE INITIALLY ASSIGNED TO THE  FAMILY  ASSESSMENT  AND
 SERVICES TRACK SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION DERIVED FROM SUCH ASSESSMENT RAIS-
 ES  THE  POSSIBILITY  THAT UNLAWFUL OR OTHER INAPPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES OR
 BEHAVIOR MAY BE PRESENT AND WOULD WARRANT REFERRAL TO THE  INVESTIGATORY
 TRACK  AND  INSTANCES WHERE, ALTHOUGH REPORTS WERE INITIALLY ASSIGNED TO
 THE INVESTIGATORY TRACK, SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION DERIVED FROM SUCH INVES-
 TIGATION WARRANTS A LESS INTRUSIVE AND MORE SERVICE ORIENTED APPROACH.
  (K) ANY RECORD OR REPORT OR OTHER  DOCUMENTATION  MADE  IN  CONNECTION
 WITH  THE  CONDUCT  OR  OPERATION  OF THE FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND SERVICES
 TRACK BY THE DISTRICT SHALL BE DEEMED  CONFIDENTIAL  AND  SHALL  NOT  BE
 DISCLOSED,  EXCEPT  TO  THE  OFFICE OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES, THE
 DISTRICT, ANY PROVIDER OF  SERVICES  ACTING  BY  OR  ON  BEHALF  OF  THE
 DISTRICT  AND  ANY  SOCIAL  SERVICES DISTRICT INVESTIGATING A SUBSEQUENT
 REPORT OF ABUSE OR MALTREATMENT INVOLVING THE SAME SUBJECT OR  THE  SAME
 CHILD  OR  CHILDREN NAMED IN THE REPORT INITIATING THE FAMILY ASSESSMENT
 AND SERVICES TRACK CASE.  NOTHING  CONTAINED  IN  THIS  PARAGRAPH  SHALL
 PROHIBIT  THE  OFFICE  OF  CHILDREN  AND  FAMILY  SERVICES  OR THE LOCAL
 DISTRICT FROM PUBLISHING A  STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  OR  OTHER  REPORT  OR
 DOCUMENTATION,  WITH  IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION  REMOVED, SUMMARIZING THE
 EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DUAL TRACK SYSTEM CREATED IN THIS SECTION.
  (L) NO PERSON OR PROVIDER OF SERVICES SHALL SUFFER ANY LIABILITY WHERE
 SUCH PERSON OR PROVIDER REASONABLY CONCLUDES, BASED ON  THE  RESULTS  OF
 INVESTIGATION OR INFORMATION GATHERED IN PROVIDING SERVICES, THAT SUCH A
 REFERRAL FROM ONE TRACK TO ANOTHER MAY BE REQUIRED BY LAW.
  5. ANY EXPENDITURE MADE BY THE DISTRICT IN COMPLYING WITH AND CARRYING
 OUT  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO REIMBURSEMENT BY
 THE STATE IN THE  SAME  MANNER  AS  EXPENDITURES  FOR  CHILD  PROTECTIVE
 SERVICES  INVESTIGATIONS  AND  MAY  BE  SUPPORTED  BY SUCH OTHER FUNDING
 SOURCES AS ARE APPROPRIATE INCLUDING, BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO,  PREVENTIVE
 SERVICES  PROVIDED PURSUANT TO SECTION FOUR HUNDRED NINE-A OF THIS ARTI-
 CLE AND INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES. NOTHING SHALL PRECLUDE THE DISTRICT
 FROM SEEKING PRIVATE FUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.
  6.  (A) IN CONDUCTING THE DEMONSTRATION  PROGRAM,  THE  PROVISIONS  OF
 SECTIONS  FOUR  HUNDRED  NINE-E  AND FOUR HUNDRED NINE-F OF THIS ARTICLE
 SHALL NOT BE APPLICABLE TO THE DISTRICT.
  (B) ALL RECORDS CREATED AS PART OF THE FAMILY ASSESSMENT AND  SERVICES
 TRACK SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, DOCUMENTATION OF THE INITIAL
 SAFETY  CHECK,  THE  EXAMINATION OF THE FAMILY'S STRENGTHS, CONCERNS AND

 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,
 impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its
 operation  to  the  clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or
 part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment
 shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of  the
 legislature  that  this act would have been enacted even if such invalid
 provisions had not been included herein.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed July 2, 2028.
