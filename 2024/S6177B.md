 AN  ACT  in  relation  to  authorizing  the county of Nassau assessor to
  accept an application for a real property tax exemption from New  York
  Jesus Baptist Church
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 New York Jesus Baptist Church an application  for  exemption  from  real
 property  taxes  pursuant  to section 420-a of the real property tax law
 with respect to the 2022-2023 assessment roll for all of  the  2022-2023
 school  taxes  and all of the 2023 general taxes for the parcel owned by
 such organization located at 167 Willis Avenue, village of Mineola, town
 of North Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as  Nassau  county
 tax  map  section 09, block 411, lot 06640. If accepted, the application
 shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or  before  the  taxable
 status date established for such assessment roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the  subject roll. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  roll,  the  applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
