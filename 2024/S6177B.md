  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of North Hempstead, county of Nassau is  hereby
 authorized  to  accept from New York Jesus Baptist Church an application
 for exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a and 462
 of the real property tax law with respect to  the  2022-2023  assessment
 roll  for  all of the 2022-2023 school taxes and all of the 2023 general
 taxes for the parcel owned by such organization located  at  167  Willis
 Avenue,  village  of Mineola, town of North Hempstead, county of Nassau,
 otherwise known as Nassau county tax map  section  09,  block  411,  lot
 06640.  If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it had been
 received on or before the  taxable  status  date  established  for  such
 assessment roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate taxable status date, the assessor of the
 town of North Hempstead, upon  approval  by  the  North  Hempstead  town
 board,  may  make  appropriate  correction  to the subject roll. If such
 exemption is granted and such organization, therefore, shall  have  paid
 any  tax with respect to the subject roll, the applicable governing body
 or tax department may, in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of
 those taxes paid and cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or
 interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
