 AN  ACT  enacting  the  "New  York  state Palestinian refugee relocation
  prevention act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "New York state Palestinian refugee relocation prevention act."
  § 2. Legislative intent. The legislature finds  the  inherent  dangers
 posed  by  the  potential  relocation  of  Palestinian "refugees" to our
 state, and hereby assert the right and duty to protect the  citizens  of
 New  York  from  any adverse impacts of such a decision. The legislature
 seeks to insulate New York from the federal  government's  short-sighted
 and  perilous proposal to admit Palestinian refugees, particularly those
 escaping the Gaza Strip, onto American soil. The legislature offers  its
 unwavering  commitment  to our ally, Israel, and reaffirm our unwavering
 support for the state of Israel and its right to exist and thrive  as  a
 Jewish  democracy.  The legislature further recognizes the shared values
 and unbreakable bond between New York and Israel, and  we  stand  united
 against  the  forces  of  terrorism and extremism that threaten both our
 great nations. The legislature calls for any relocation of  Palestinian
 refugees to the United States be rescinded.
  § 3. 1. No state or local agency, authority, or official shall cooper-
 ate  with,  or  provide any assistance to, the federal government in the
 relocation or resettlement of Palestinian refugees within the  state  of
 New York. This includes, but is not limited to, denying any requests for
 the  allocation  of  resources,  housing,  or  social  services for this
 purpose.
  2. Any federal funds allocated for  the  resettlement  of  Palestinian
 refugees  in  New  York  shall  be  rejected and returned to the federal
 government.
  3. A temporary moratorium on the admission to any institution of high-
 er education in this state  of  Palestinian  students  and  scholars  is
 imposed until such time as the threat of extremist infiltration has been

 thoroughly  assessed  and  addressed.  The commissioner of education, in
 consultation with the board of regents, shall make the determination  of
 the  duration  of  such  temporary moratorium and shall re-evaluate such
 determination  six months after the effective date of this act and every
 six months thereafter.
  4. The state of New York shall utilize all legal  means  necessary  to
 challenge and thwart any attempts by the federal government to coerce or
 compel  compliance with their refugee relocation agenda, including seek-
 ing injunctive relief and asserting Tenth Amendment rights.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
