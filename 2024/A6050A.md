 the  liquor  authority,  and  is  then in effect. Such schedule shall be
 transmitted to the authority in such form, manner, medium and format  as
 the  authority  may  direct; shall be deemed duly verified by the person
 submitting such schedule upon its transmission  to  the  authority;  and
 shall contain, with respect to each item, the exact brand or trade name,
 capacity  of  package, nature of contents, age and proof where stated on
 the label, the number of bottles contained in each case, the bottle  and
 case  price  to  wholesalers,  the net bottle and case price paid by the
 seller, which prices, in each instance, shall  be  individual  for  each
 item  and  not  in  "combination" with any other item, the discounts for
 quantity, if any, and the discounts for time of payment,  if  any.  Such
 brand  of  liquor or wine shall not be sold to wholesalers except at the
 price and discounts then in effect unless prior  written  permission  of
 the authority is granted for good cause shown and for reasons not incon-
 sistent  with the purpose of this chapter. Such schedule shall be trans-
 mitted by (1) the owner of such brand, or (2) a wholesaler selling  such
 brand  and  who  is  designated  as agent for the purpose of filing such
 schedule if the owner of the brand is not licensed by the authority,  or
 (3)  with  the  approval of the authority, by a wholesaler, in the event
 that the owner of the brand is unable to transmit a schedule  or  desig-
 nate  an  agent  for  such purpose. As used in this subdivision the term
 "item" shall be deemed to include a sealed, pre-wrapped package consist-
 ing of a sealed container OR CONTAINERS of liquor, wine or wine  product
 and  other  merchandise  reasonably used in connection with the prepara-
