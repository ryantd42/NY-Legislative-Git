 AN ACT to amend the arts and cultural affairs law, in relation to estab-
  lishing the New York state museum partnership trust

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 the New York state museum is a vital interest of the state, enabling  us
 to  pass  New  York's  past and present on to our children and our chil-
 dren's children. The museum welcomes visitors to  explore  its  rotating
 and  permanent  exhibitions. The museum also offers educational program-
 ming, including after-school programs  that  have  benefited  more  than
 4,000 students in the city of Albany. The museum is essential for educa-
 tion,  public  programs,  and  generating tourism and economic activity.
 Unfortunately, present conditions inhibit  its  ability  to  thrive  and
 serve New Yorkers to its fullest potential. Therefore, it is the purpose
 of  this  act to support the museum's operations and align its oversight
 structure with that  of  the  other  departments  under  the  office  of
 cultural  education at the state education department. Both the New York
 state library and the New York state archives benefit from  the  support
 of  an affiliated trust that obtains non-state funding to supplement the
 operations and programming of the library and archives, respectively. It
 is time to bring the New York state museum in line with the other  divi-
 sions of the office of cultural education at the state education depart-
 ment.  To  accomplish this, a New York state museum partnership trust is
 created in order to: create an endowment to help  collect  and  preserve
 art,  historical  items,  objects  of  material culture, natural history
 specimens, and other objects that tell the story of the people who  call
 New York home; make possible special projects and inform the citizens of
 New  York  about the exhibits and programs of the state museum; and work
 in conjunction with the board of regents, the office of cultural  educa-
 tion  at  the state education department, the commissioner of education,
