 needed, in order to understand the scope, impact and cost of operating a
 statewide food for all program, including, but not limited to:
  (1)  the  number  of undocumented families in the state, including the
 status of such families  (i.e.  DACA,  asylum  seekers,  refugees),  the
 number  of such families that are experiencing hunger, and the number of
 such families that are currently excluded from SNAP due to  their  immi-
 gration status or other requirements from SNAP;
  (2)  the demographics of the population of undocumented individuals by
 age, income levels, unemployment levels, languages spoken, and location;
  (3) an estimate of the amount of tax revenue undocumented New  Yorkers
 contribute to the state;
  (4)  the  number  of  children in the state who live with at least one
 undocumented parent;
  (5) the annual healthcare savings as a result  of  being  enrolled  in
 SNAP; and
  (6)  the number of New Yorkers who have been lifted out of poverty due
 to SNAP;

 investment;
