  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 7, 2024, as Child Health Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, The citizens of the State of  New  York  are  committed  to
ensuring  the  safety  and well-being of our most precious resource, our
children, and to protecting them, in every facet of their  daily  lives;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 7, 2024, as Child  Health  Day
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Child Health Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Child Health Day, which is on the first Monday of
every October, shows support for children's health,  family,  and  those
that work hard to help them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Family  income is a major factor in the health of children
both physically and mentally; children from households below the poverty
line have a higher obesity rate  than  those  above  it,  and  with  the
epidemic  not slowing down, it is clear that there is more that needs to
be done; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Child Health Day became a  day  of  observance  in
1928,  when  President Calvin Coolidge issued a proclamation for the day
and Congress enacted it; in the beginning, National Child Health Day was
observed on May 1, and in 1960, it was changed to the  first  Monday  in
October;  ever since then, American presidents have issued proclamations
that day in hopes of rallying the country to support children's  health;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  this  day,  kids are encouraged to go out and get some
exercise, and to be aware of what they eat  and  how  it  affects  their
health;  child eating habits should include fruits and vegetables, whole
grains, low-fat dairy products, protein foods, and oils; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is found a good diet can improve  academic  performance;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  an  estimated 82% of children in the United States
are in good health; and
 
  WHEREAS, Children are the most vulnerable  people  in  our  society;
knowing  how  to  best  ensure  their  health  secures  our future for a
brighter tomorrow; the next generation  needs  to  develop  good  health
standards  and  it  starts with the people who are in that child's life;
and
 
  WHEREAS, National Child Health Day and its advocates help to  spread
the word and raise funds to ensure that kids have the proper information
and  tools  to  stay  healthy; the more that a health-conscious ideology
becomes the norm, the more likely it is that kids will follow suit; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 7, 2024, as Child
Health Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
