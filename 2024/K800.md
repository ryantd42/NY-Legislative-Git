  RECOGNIZING  February  2,  2024, as World Wetlands
  Day
 
  WHEREAS, New York State understands the importance of preserving and
contributing  to  the  maintenance  of  wetlands,  and  understands  the
importance that they play in the cycle of preserving a proper balance in
the ecosystem; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is justly proud to recognize Friday,
February 2, 2024, as World Wetlands Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wetlands are land areas that are saturated or flooded  with
water either permanently or seasonally; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Inland  wetlands  include  marshes,  ponds,  lakes,  fens,
rivers, floodplains, and  swamps;  coastal  wetlands  include  saltwater
marshes,  estuaries, mangroves, lagoons and even coral reefs; fishponds,
rice paddies, and salt pans are human-made wetlands; and
 
  WHEREAS, Wetlands are critical to human and planet life; directly or
indirectly, they provide  almost  all  of  the  world's  consumption  of
freshwater; more than one billion people depend on them for a living and
40%  of the world's species live and breed in wetlands; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Wetlands  are  a  vital  source  for  food, raw materials,
genetic resources for medicines, and hydropower; they  mitigate  floods,
protect coastlines and build community resilience to disasters, and they
play  an  important  role  in  transport,  tourism  and the cultural and
spiritual well-being of people; and
 
  WHEREAS, February 2, each year is World Wetlands Day to raise global
awareness about the vital role of wetlands for people  and  our  planet;
this  day  also  marks  the  date  of  the adoption of the Convention on
Wetlands on February 2, 1971, in the  Iranian  city  of  Ramsar  on  the
shores of the Caspian Sea; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Climate change is one of the most pressing problems facing
humanity and our planet;  this  year's  theme,  "Wetlands  Restoration",
highlights the urgent need to prioritize wetland restoration; and
 
  WHEREAS, Approximately 35% of the world's wetlands were lost between
1970-2015 with annual rates of loss accelerating from 2000; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Losses  have  been  driven  by  megatrends such as climate
change, population increase, urbanization, particularly of coastal zones
and river deltas, and changing consumption patterns that have all fueled
changes to land and water use and to agriculture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Wetlands,  which  include  lakes,  rivers,  marshes  and
peatlands  as  well  as  coastal  and  marine  areas  such as estuaries,
lagoons, mangroves and coral reefs, are  currently  estimated  to  cover
more  than  12.1  million  km2,  an  area  greater  than  the country of
Greenland; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2012, Hurricane Sandy slammed into the eastern seaboard
of the United States, directly impacting New York State  and  inflicting
damage  in 24 states; if not for coastal wetlands, the destruction would
have been worse; and
 
  WHEREAS, A recent study found that coastal wetlands in the Northeast
United States prevented $625 million  in  direct  flood  damages  during
Hurricane  Sandy,  reducing  damages  by  more  than  22% in half of the
impacted areas and by as much as 30% elsewhere; and
 
  WHEREAS, The intensity, frequency, and duration  of  North  Atlantic
hurricanes  have  increased since the early 1980s, making the protection
of the 50% of United States wetlands that remain an imperative; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State understands the importance of preserving and
contributing  to  the  maintenance  of  wetlands,  and  understands  the
importance  that  wetlands  play  in  the  cycle  of preserving a proper
balance in the ecosystem; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to observe  those
events of true purpose and worthy accomplishment that recognize the need
for  the  understanding  of  preserving the wetlands of New York and the
global community, and instilling educational tenets to our Great  State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize February 2, 2024, as World Wetlands Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  World  Wetlands  Day events throughout the State of New
York.
