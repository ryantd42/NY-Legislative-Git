 Introduced  by Sen. KAVANAGH -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Housing, Construction  and
  Community Development
 
 AN ACT to amend the private housing finance law, in relation to creating
  an  affordable  housing  relief  fund  program  to preserve affordable
  multifamily residential properties located in New York state

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. The private housing finance law is amended by adding a new
 article 33 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE XXXIII
  AFFORDABLE HOUSING RELIEF FUND PROGRAM
 SECTION 1300. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  1301. DEFINITIONS.
  1302. AFFORDABLE HOUSING RELIEF FUND PROGRAM.
  1303. PROGRAM CRITERIA.
  1304. FUNDING CRITERIA.
  1305. AFFORDABILITY PROTECTION.
  1306. FUNDING AND ANNUAL REPORT.
  § 1300. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. THE LEGISLATURE  FINDS  AND
 DECLARES  THAT  THERE  EXISTS  A  SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF SAFE AND HABITABLE
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN NEW YORK STATE FOR PERSONS  AND  FAMILIES  OF  LOW
 INCOME.  A  SIGNIFICANT  PORTION  OF THE AFFORDABLE, MULTIFAMILY HOUSING
 STOCK IS IN OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS, THREATENING  TO  EXACER-
 BATE  THIS CRISIS. RENT COLLECTION LOSSES, LABOR SHORTAGES, CONSTRUCTION
 DELAYS, COST OVERRUNS, INTEREST RATES AND RISING  INSURANCE  COSTS  HAVE
 CAUSED  A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH ARE JEOPARD-
 IZING THE AVAILABILITY TO TENANTS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS  AND  EVEN
 THE  VIABILITY  OF SOME BUILDINGS. EXISTING PRESERVATION PROGRAM FUNDING
 IS LIMITED, AND THIS IDENTIFIED NEED IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR  SUCH  FUNDING.
 THE  LEGISLATURE THEREFORE FINDS THAT A PROGRAM SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO
 PROVIDE NEEDED CAPITAL FUNDS AND  DEBT  RESTRUCTURING  TO  ENSURE  THESE
 AT-RISK AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPERTIES REMAIN AVAILABLE TO TENANTS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
