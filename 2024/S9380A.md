 AN ACT to amend the private housing finance law, in relation to creating
  an affordable housing  relief  fund  program  to  preserve  affordable
  multifamily residential properties located in New York state
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The private housing finance law is amended by adding a  new
 article 33 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE XXXIII
  AFFORDABLE HOUSING RELIEF FUND PROGRAM
 SECTION 1300. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  1301. DEFINITIONS.
  1302. AFFORDABLE HOUSING RELIEF FUND PROGRAM.
  1303. PROGRAM CRITERIA.

  1305. AFFORDABILITY PROTECTION.
  1306. FUNDING.
  1307. ANNUAL REPORT.
  § 1300. STATEMENT  OF  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND
 DECLARES THAT THERE EXISTS A SERIOUS  SHORTAGE  OF  SAFE  AND  HABITABLE
 AFFORDABLE  HOUSING  IN  NEW  YORK STATE FOR PERSONS AND FAMILIES OF LOW
 INCOME. A PORTION OF THE AFFORDABLE, MULTIFAMILY  HOUSING  STOCK  IS  IN
 OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS, THREATENING TO EXACERBATE THIS SHOR-
 TAGE. RENT COLLECTION LOSSES, RISING INTEREST RATES AND INSURANCE COSTS,
 AND  OTHER  FACTORS  HAVE  CAUSED  SIGNIFICANT  INCREASES  IN  OPERATING
 EXPENSES, WHICH MAY JEOPARDIZE THE AVAILABILITY TO TENANTS OF AFFORDABLE
 HOUSING UNITS OR EVEN THE VIABILITY OF SOME BUILDINGS. EXISTING  PRESER-
 VATION  PROGRAM  FUNDING  IS  LIMITED, AND DISTRESSED AFFORDABLE HOUSING
 PROPERTIES MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH FUNDING. THE LEGISLATURE  THERE-
 FORE  FINDS THAT A PROGRAM SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE NEEDED CAPI-
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
