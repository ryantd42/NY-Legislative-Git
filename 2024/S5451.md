  (ii)  "Census  count"  shall  mean  the  product  of the public school

 accordance  with  this  subdivision  for the base year multiplied by the
 census [2000] poverty rate.
  (iii) "Census [2000] poverty rate" shall  mean  the  quotient  of  the
 number  of  persons  aged  five to seventeen within the school district,
 based on the MOST RECENT FEDERAL decennial census conducted [in the year
 two thousand] as tabulated by the National Center on  Education  Statis-
 tics, who were enrolled in public schools and whose families had incomes
 below  the  poverty  level,  divided by the total number of persons aged

 census,  who  were enrolled in public schools, computed to four decimals
 without rounding.
  (iv) "Selected poverty rate" shall mean: (A) for school districts with

 in which the base year began, plus such number for the year three  years
 prior to the year in which the base year began, plus such number for the
 year  four years prior to the year in which the base year began, divided
