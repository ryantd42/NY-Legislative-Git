 torship for which such person is under a duty  to  act,  an  application
 filed  with  the  division  of tax appeals on behalf of the corporation,
 dissolved corporation, partnership or individual proprietorship shall be
 deemed to include any and  all  subsequently  issued  personal  determi-
 nations  and a separate application to the division of tax appeals for a
 hearing shall not be required. The [tax  commission]  COMMISSIONER  may,
 nevertheless,  of [its] THEIR own motion, redetermine such determination
 of tax or liability for tax. Where  the  [tax  commission]  COMMISSIONER
 determines or redetermines that the amount of tax claimed to be due from
 a  vendor  of  tangible  personal  property  or services, a recipient of
 amusement charges, or an operator of a hotel OR VACATION RENTAL is erro-
 neous or excessive in whole or in part, [it] THEY shall redetermine  the
 amount  of tax properly due from any such person as a person required to
 collect tax with respect to such vendor, recipient, or operator, and  if
 such  amount  is less than the amount of tax for which such person would
 have been liable in the absence  of  such  determination  or  redetermi-
 nation,  [it] THEY shall reduce such liability accordingly. Furthermore,
 the [tax commission] COMMISSIONER may, of [its] THEIR own motion,  abate
 on behalf of any such person, any part of the tax determined to be erro-
 neous  or excessive whether or not such tax had become finally and irre-
 vocably fixed with respect to such person but no claim for abatement may
 be filed by any such person. The provisions of this paragraph shall  not
 be  construed  to limit in any manner the powers of the attorney general
 under subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred forty-one OF  THIS  PART
 or  the  powers  of the [tax commission] COMMISSIONER to issue a warrant
 under subdivision (b) of such section against any person whose liability
 has become finally and irrevocably fixed.

 SURPLUS.

 UPON  SUCH  ENFORCING  OFFICER'S  ESTIMATE  OF THE PROPERTY'S VALUE, THE
 ENFORCING OFFICER'S REPORT TO THE COURT SHALL SET FORTH  AN  EXPLANATION
 OF  HOW THIS ESTIMATE WAS MADE, INCLUDING THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH IT WAS

 INTEREST,  CLAIM, LIEN OR EQUITY OF REDEMPTION IN OR UPON A PARCEL IMME-
 DIATELY PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE JUDGMENT OF FORECLOSURE MAY FILE  A
 CLAIM  WITH  THE  COURT  HAVING  JURISDICTION FOR A SHARE OF ANY SURPLUS
 RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF SUCH PROPERTY.  SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE ADMINIS-
 TERED AND ADJUDICATED, AND SUCH SURPLUS SHALL  BE  DISTRIBUTED,  IN  THE
 SAME  MANNER AS IN AN ACTION TO FORECLOSE A MORTGAGE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE
 THIRTEEN OF THE REAL PROPERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS  LAW,  SUBJECT  TO
 THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
 S. 8309  23  A. 8809
 
  2.  (A)  WHERE THE PROPERTY WAS SOLD BY A PUBLIC SALE, THE AMOUNT PAID
 FOR THE PROPERTY SHALL BE ACCEPTED AS THE FULL VALUE  OF  THE  PROPERTY.

 AGAINST THE TAX DISTRICT ON THE BASIS THAT THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE PROP-
 ERTY DID NOT FAIRLY REPRESENT THE PROPERTY'S VALUE.
  (B)  WHERE THE PROPERTY WAS SOLD BY OTHER THAN A PUBLIC SALE, A CLAIM-
 ANT MAY MAKE A MOTION, UPON NOTICE TO THE  ENFORCING  OFFICER,  FOR  THE
 SURPLUS  TO  BE RECALCULATED ON THE BASIS THAT THE PROPERTY'S FULL VALUE
 ON THE DATE OF THE SALE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE VALUE USED  TO
 MEASURE  THE  SURPLUS  PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF
 SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED NINETY-SIX OF THIS TITLE.  IF
 THE  COURT  OR  ITS  REFEREE  FINDS THAT A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE
 SUPPORTS THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION, THE COURT  MAY  DIRECT  THE  ENFORCING
 OFFICER  TO  RECALCULATE  THE SURPLUS BASED UPON THE PROPERTY'S VALUE AS
 DETERMINED BY THE COURT OR REFEREE.  THE COURT MAY  FURTHER  DIRECT  THE
 ENFORCING  OFFICER TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE INTO COURT TO BE DISTRIBUTED AS
 REQUIRED BY THIS SECTION.

 PROCEEDINGS  PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF SECTION THIRTEEN HUNDRED
 SIXTY-ONE OF THE REAL PROPERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS LAW, IT SHALL NOT
 BE NECESSARY FOR SUCH REFEREE TO MAKE A REPORT OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS;  NOR
 SHALL  IT  BE  NECESSARY  FOR THE COURT TO CONFIRM BY ORDER OR OTHERWISE
 SUCH PROCEEDINGS.
  4. AT THE CONCLUSION OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS, ANY SURPLUS FUNDS THAT  HAVE
 NOT  BEEN CLAIMED SHALL BE DEEMED ABANDONED BUT SHALL BE PAID TO THE TAX
 DISTRICT, NOT TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER, AND SHALL BE  USED  BY  THE  TAX
 DISTRICT TO REDUCE ITS TAX LEVY.
  5.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY PROVISION OF THIS SECTION OR ANY OTHER LAW TO
 THE CONTRARY, IN THE CASE OF ABANDONED REAL PROPERTY,  NO  PERSON  OTHER
 THAN  THE  TAX DISTRICT SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHT TO ANY SURPLUS ATTRIBUTABLE
 THERETO.  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TITLE,  REAL  PROPERTY  SHALL  BE  DEEMED
 ABANDONED IF IT:

 VACANT AND ABANDONED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  ELEVEN
 HUNDRED ELEVEN-A OF THIS ARTICLE, OR

 DONED  PROPERTY  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  THIRTEEN HUNDRED TEN OF THE REAL
 PROPERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS LAW.
  6. TO THE EXTENT THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN OF THE REAL  PROP-
 ERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS LAW ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
 THIS ARTICLE, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL GOVERN.
  § 8. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-

  E. Prior to a corporation being able to utilize the  funds  authorized

 chapter  are  being  held  separate and apart from any amounts otherwise
 authorized to be retained  from  pari-mutuel  pools  and  all  surcharge
 monies  have  been  and  will  continue  to be paid to the localities as
 prescribed in law.  Once this condition is  satisfied,  the  corporation
 must  submit  an  expenditure  plan to the gaming commission for review.
 Such plan  shall  include  the  corporation's  outstanding  liabilities,
 projected  revenue  for the upcoming year, a detailed explanation of how
 the funds will be used, and any other information  necessary  to  detail
 such  plan  as determined by the commission. Upon review, the commission

 this paragraph have not been satisfied, the commission shall notify  the
 corporation  of  all deficiencies necessary for approval. As a condition

 spent as indicated in such approved plan. The audit shall  be  paid  for
 from  money in the fund established by this section. If the audit deter-
 mines that a corporation used the money authorized  under  this  section
 for  a purpose other than one listed in their expenditure plan, then the
 corporation shall reimburse the capital acquisition fund for  the  unau-
 thorized amount.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  Section  1.  Paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  1 of section 1003 of the
 racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, as amended by  section  1
 of  part  BB  of  chapter  59 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (a)  Any  racing  association  or  corporation  or  regional off-track
 betting corporation, authorized to conduct  pari-mutuel  wagering  under
 this  chapter, desiring to display the simulcast of horse races on which
 pari-mutuel betting shall be permitted in the manner and subject to  the
 conditions  provided for in this article may apply to the commission for
 a license so to do. Applications for licenses shall be in such  form  as
 may  be  prescribed by the commission and shall contain such information
 or other material or evidence as the commission may require. No  license
 shall be issued by the commission authorizing the simulcast transmission
 of  thoroughbred  races  from a track located in Suffolk county. The fee
 for such licenses shall be five hundred dollars per  simulcast  facility
 and  for  account wagering licensees that do not operate either a simul-
 cast facility that is open to the public within the state of New York or
 a licensed racetrack within the state, twenty thousand dollars per  year
 payable  by  the licensee to the commission for deposit into the general
 fund. Except as provided in  this  section,  the  commission  shall  not
 approve any application to conduct simulcasting into individual or group
 residences,  homes  or  other areas for the purposes of or in connection
 with pari-mutuel wagering. The commission may approve simulcasting  into
 residences,  homes or other areas to be conducted jointly by one or more
 regional off-track betting corporations and one or more of  the  follow-
 ing:  a  franchised  corporation,  thoroughbred  racing corporation or a
 harness racing corporation or association; provided (i) the simulcasting
 consists only of those races on which pari-mutuel betting is  authorized
 by  this  chapter  at  one  or more simulcast facilities for each of the
 contracting off-track betting corporations which  shall  include  wagers
 made  in  accordance  with  section  one  thousand fifteen, one thousand
 sixteen and one thousand seventeen of  this  article;  provided  further
 that  the  contract  provisions or other simulcast arrangements for such
 simulcast facility shall be no less favorable than those  in  effect  on
 January  first,  two  thousand  five;  (ii)  that each off-track betting
 corporation having within its  geographic  boundaries  such  residences,
 homes  or  other  areas  technically  capable of receiving the simulcast
 signal shall be a contracting party; (iii) the distribution of  revenues
 shall  be  subject  to  contractual agreement of the parties except that
 statutory payments to  non-contracting  parties,  if  any,  may  not  be
 reduced;  provided,  however,  that nothing herein to the contrary shall
 prevent a track from televising its races on an irregular basis primari-
 ly for promotional or marketing purposes as found by the commission. For
 purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of section one thousand thir-
 teen of this article shall  not  apply.  Any  agreement  authorizing  an
 in-home simulcasting experiment commencing prior to May fifteenth, nine-
 teen hundred ninety-five, may, and all its terms, be extended until June
 thirtieth,  two  thousand  [twenty-four] TWENTY-FIVE; provided, however,
 that any party to such agreement may elect to terminate  such  agreement
 upon  conveying written notice to all other parties of such agreement at
 least forty-five days prior to the effective date  of  the  termination,
 via  registered mail. Any party to an agreement receiving such notice of
 an intent to terminate, may request the commission  to  mediate  between
 the  parties new terms and conditions in a replacement agreement between
 the parties as will permit continuation of an in-home  experiment  until
 June  thirtieth,  two  thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE; and (iv) no
 S. 8309  27  A. 8809
 
 in-home simulcasting in the thoroughbred special betting district  shall
 occur without the approval of the regional thoroughbred track.
  §  2.  Subparagraph  (iii)  of paragraph d of subdivision 3 of section
 1007 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, as amended by
 section 2 of part BB of chapter 59 of the laws of 2023,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  (iii) Of the sums retained by a receiving track located in Westchester
 county  on  races received from a franchised corporation, for the period
 commencing January first, two thousand eight and continuing through June
 thirtieth, two  thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE,  the  amount  used
 exclusively  for purses to be awarded at races conducted by such receiv-
 ing track shall be computed as follows: of the sums so retained, two and
 one-half percent of the total pools. Such amount shall be  increased  or
 decreased  in  the  amount  of  fifty percent of the difference in total
 commissions determined by  comparing  the  total  commissions  available
 after  July  twenty-first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  to the total
 commissions that would have been available to such track prior  to  July
 twenty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-five.
  §  3.  The  opening  paragraph of subdivision 1 of section 1014 of the

 thoroughbred  racing  corporation located within the state is conducting
 racing, each off-track betting corporation branch office and each simul-
 casting facility licensed in accordance with section one thousand  seven
 (that  has  entered into a written agreement with such facility's repre-
 sentative horsemen's organization, as approved by the  commission),  one

 licensed in accordance with section one thousand seven that have entered
 into  a written agreement with such facility's representative horsemen's
 organization as approved by the commission, one thousand  eight  or  one
 thousand  nine  of this article shall be authorized to accept wagers and
 display the live  full-card  simulcast  signal  of  thoroughbred  tracks
 (which  may  include  quarter  horse or mixed meetings provided that all
 such wagering on such races shall be construed to be thoroughbred races)
 located in another state or foreign country, subject  to  the  following
 provisions;  provided,  however,  no  such  written  agreement  shall be
 required of a franchised corporation licensed in accordance with section
 one thousand seven of this article:

 wagering and breeding law, as amended by section 6 of part BB of chapter

 winning tickets therein, provided such tickets are presented for payment
 before  April  first  of  the year following the year of their purchase,
 less an amount that shall be established and retained by such franchised
 corporation of between twelve to seventeen percent of the total deposits
 in pools resulting from on-track regular bets, and fourteen  to  twenty-

 multiple bets and fifteen to twenty-five percent of the  total  deposits
 in  pools  resulting from on-track exotic bets and fifteen to thirty-six
 percent of the total deposits in pools  resulting  from  on-track  super
 exotic  bets,  plus  the breaks. The retention rate to be established is
 subject to the prior approval of the commission.
  Such rate may not be changed more than once per calendar quarter to be

 "multiple  bets"  shall  have  the  meanings  set  forth in section five
 hundred nineteen of this chapter. "Super exotic  bets"  shall  have  the
 meaning  set  forth  in  section  three hundred one of this chapter. For

 shall be one and six-tenths percent, plus, in each such  period,  twenty
 percent of the breaks. Payment to the New York state thoroughbred breed-
 ing  and  development  fund by such franchised corporation shall be one-
 half of one percent of total daily on-track pari-mutuel pools  resulting
 from regular, multiple and exotic bets and three percent of super exotic
 bets  and  for the period April first, two thousand one through December
