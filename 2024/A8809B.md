 racing,  pari-mutuel  wagering and breeding law, as amended by section 1
 of part BB of chapter 59 of the laws of 2023,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (a)  Any  racing  association  or  corporation  or  regional off-track
 betting corporation, authorized to conduct  pari-mutuel  wagering  under
 this  chapter, desiring to display the simulcast of horse races on which
 pari-mutuel betting shall be permitted in the manner and subject to  the
 conditions  provided for in this article may apply to the commission for
 a license so to do. Applications for licenses shall be in such  form  as
 may  be  prescribed by the commission and shall contain such information
 or other material or evidence as the commission may require. No  license
 shall be issued by the commission authorizing the simulcast transmission
 of  thoroughbred  races  from a track located in Suffolk county. The fee
 for such licenses shall be five hundred dollars per  simulcast  facility
 and  for  account wagering licensees that do not operate either a simul-
 cast facility that is open to the public within the state of New York or
 a licensed racetrack within the state, twenty thousand dollars per  year

 fund. Except as provided in  this  section,  the  commission  shall  not
 approve any application to conduct simulcasting into individual or group
 residences,  homes  or  other areas for the purposes of or in connection
 with pari-mutuel wagering. The commission may approve simulcasting  into
 residences,  homes or other areas to be conducted jointly by one or more
 regional off-track betting corporations and one or more of  the  follow-
 ing:  a  franchised  corporation,  thoroughbred  racing corporation or a
 harness racing corporation or association; provided (i) the simulcasting
 consists only of those races on which pari-mutuel betting is  authorized
 by  this  chapter  at  one  or more simulcast facilities for each of the
 contracting off-track betting corporations which  shall  include  wagers
 made  in  accordance  with  section  one  thousand fifteen, one thousand
 sixteen and one thousand seventeen of  this  article;  provided  further
 that  the  contract  provisions or other simulcast arrangements for such
 simulcast facility shall be no less favorable than those  in  effect  on
 January  first,  two  thousand  five;  (ii)  that each off-track betting
 corporation having within its  geographic  boundaries  such  residences,
 A. 8809--A  24
 
 homes  or  other  areas  technically  capable of receiving the simulcast
 signal shall be a contracting party; (iii) the distribution of  revenues
 shall  be  subject  to  contractual agreement of the parties except that
 statutory  payments  to  non-contracting  parties,  if  any,  may not be
 reduced; provided, however, that nothing herein to  the  contrary  shall
 prevent a track from televising its races on an irregular basis primari-
 ly for promotional or marketing purposes as found by the commission. For
 purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of section one thousand thir-
 teen  of  this  article  shall  not  apply. Any agreement authorizing an
 in-home simulcasting experiment commencing prior to May fifteenth, nine-
 teen hundred ninety-five, may, and all its terms, be extended until June
 thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE;  provided,  however,
 that  any  party to such agreement may elect to terminate such agreement
 upon conveying written notice to all other parties of such agreement  at
 least  forty-five  days  prior to the effective date of the termination,
 via registered mail. Any party to an agreement receiving such notice  of
 an  intent  to  terminate, may request the commission to mediate between
 the parties new terms and conditions in a replacement agreement  between
 the  parties  as will permit continuation of an in-home experiment until
 June thirtieth, two thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-FIVE;  and  (iv)  no
 in-home  simulcasting in the thoroughbred special betting district shall
 occur without the approval of the regional thoroughbred track.

 five]  TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SEVEN the New York Jockey Injury Compensation

 such  factors  as  are  appropriate,  including  where  applicable,  the
 geographic  location  of  the  racing  corporation at which the owner or

 receive  payments  pursuant  to this section in accordance with rules of
 the commission adopted effective November third, nineteen hundred eight-
 y-three representing at least fifty-one percent of the owners and train-
 ers using the facilities of such franchised corporation, on  the  condi-
 tion  that  such  horsemen's  organization  shall  expend  as much as is

 receive payments pursuant to this section in accordance  with  rules  of
 the  commission  adopted  effective  May  twenty-third, nineteen hundred

 any reference in this chapter to subsection (d), (d-1), (d-2)  or  (d-3)
 of this section shall be read as a reference to this subsection.
  (1) For resident married individuals filing joint returns and resident
