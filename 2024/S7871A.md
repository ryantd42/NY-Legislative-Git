 AN ACT
  to direct the department of taxation and finance to establish a  pilot
 program for implementation of local land value taxation

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. 1. The department of taxation and finance shall establish a
 pilot program in up to five  municipalities  under  which  such  munici-
 palities  shall develop a plan for implementation of land value taxation
 that (a) classifies real estate included in such municipality's  assess-
 ment  roll as (i) land or land exclusive of buildings, or (ii) buildings
 on land; and (b) establishes a different local  property  tax  rate  for
 each such class, provided the higher local property tax rate shall apply
 to land or land exclusive of buildings.
  2.  The department of taxation and finance shall establish an applica-
 tion procedure and any other criteria for the pilot program  established
 under  subdivision  one  of this section, under which municipalities may
 apply to participate in such pilot program.  If a municipality having  a
 population  greater  than 50,000 applies for participation in such pilot
 program, such municipality shall designate a  specific  neighborhood  or
 area within such municipality that would participate in such program, if
 selected.  The department of taxation and finance shall send a notice of
 selection  for  such pilot program to the chief executive officer of the
 municipality and to the temporary president of the senate and the speak-
 er of the assembly.
  3. In order to apply to participate in the pilot  program  established
 under  subdivision  one  of  this  section,  the legislative body of the
 applicable municipality shall pass a local law, and  a  school  district
 shall  pass  a  resolution,  affirmatively  authorizing  the application
 established under subdivision two of this section.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
