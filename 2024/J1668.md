BY: Senator STEWART-COUSINS
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  observance  of the 39th Annual
  Martin Luther King, Jr. Day  in  the  State  of  New
  York, on January 15, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  From time to time we take note of certain individuals whom
we wish to recognize for their  valued  contributions  and  to  publicly
acknowledge their endeavors which have enhanced the basic humanity among
us all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the custom of this Legislative  Body  to
join the people of this great Empire State in proudly observing the 39th
Annual  Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in the State of New York, on January
15, 2024, taking note of his many accomplishments and  contributions  to
mankind; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr. was born the grandson of a
slave into a segregated society in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  on  January  15,
1929,  and  was  instrumental  in  formulating a policy which ultimately
destroyed legal apartheid in the southern states of our nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, In February of 1968, Dr.  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.  spoke
about the inevitability of his death and hoped that when we spoke of his
life,  we  would  not  concentrate on his academic achievements: that he
graduated  from  Morehouse  College,  that  he  attended  the  Crozer
Theological  Seminary and Boston University, where he earned a doctorate
in Systematic Theology; and
 
  WHEREAS, After returning from Crozer, Dr. Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.
delivered  his  first  sermon  at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and
became the church's co-pastor with his father; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a truly humble man,  also  did
not  find it important that we mention that he won the Nobel Peace Prize
and over 300 other awards; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr.'s  finest  legacy  of  greater
social  justice for all Americans was truly reflected in his devotion to
serve and respect others, and in his steadfast love  for  all  humanity;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Standing  in  a long line of great American black leaders,
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. represents the  historical  culmination  and
the  living  embodiment  of  a  spirit of united purpose rooted in Black
African culture and the American Dream; and
 
  WHEREAS, An apostle of peace, Dr. Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.  fought
unrelentingly  for  the civil rights of all Americans and taught us that
through non-violence  courage  displaces  fear,  love  transforms  hate,
acceptance dissipates prejudice and mutual regard cancels enmity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr. manifestly contributed to the
cause of America's freedom, and  his  commitment  to  human  dignity  is
 
visibly  mirrored in the spiritual, economic and political dimensions of
the civil rights movement; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life was devoted
to  the  liberation  of  his  people  and  his  courage  transcended the
advocates of mindless retrenchment; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body  that  the  common
and  shared  responsibility  of  governance  demands  an  irrevocable
commitment to the preservation  and  enhancement  of  human  dignity  as
exemplified by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon the occasion of the celebration of the birthday of Dr.
Martin  Luther King, Jr., it is the practice of this Legislative Body to
commemorate the heroic  efforts  of  Dr.  King,  who  loved  and  served
humanity, and who was a drum major for peace, justice and righteousness;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  2024  Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday observance
marks the 95th Anniversary of his birth, and  the  39th  Annual  Holiday
celebrated in the State of New York in his honor; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize and pay tribute to the legendary life  and  achievements  of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., upon the occasion of the anniversary of his
birth and the celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in the State of
New York and throughout the Nation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and  Asian  Legislative
Caucus.
