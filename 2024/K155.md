  WHEREAS, The quality of life in New York State is largely reflective
of the commitment and dedication demonstrated by members of the agencies
which serve to protect, preserve and maintain public order; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and

  WHEREAS, The history of the Yonkers Police Department began on April
10,  1871,  with  only  a  handful  of  men and the authorization of the
Governor; since its humble beginnings, the City  of  Yonkers  has  grown
tremendously  to become the third largest city in the State of New York,
and requires a skilled police force to keep its communities safe; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, remaining true to its mission,  the  Yonkers  Police
Department  enhances  the  quality  of  life  in  its city by working in
cooperation  with  the  diverse  communities  it  serves;  this  vital
department  protects  the  lives and property of its residents and those
visiting the City of Yonkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  enforcing  the  law  within  the  framework  of  the
Constitution,  the  dedicated  members  of the Yonkers Police Department
pledge to protect  the  people  of  Yonkers,  preserve  the  peace,  and
contribute to a safe environment for all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  men  and  women  who  serve  this vital
organization will continue to maintain and enhance the public's trust by
asserting the highest ethical standards; and

demonstrated  continuous  service to the residents and communities which
it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The members of the Yonkers Police  Department,  with  their
proficient  skills  and  love  for  the  City  they so ably serve, truly
epitomize the roll of a community police department; these brave men and
women tirelessly and selflessly  serve  the  residents  of  the  Yonkers
community  with  compassion,  integrity,  and fairness, attributes which
will forever serve as an example for generations of  officers  to  come;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  great  State  of  New York is fortunate to have brave
public servants like the members of the Yonkers  Police  Department  who
risk  their  lives in the line of duty each day to protect the residents
 
of our communities; no greater debt is owed than that owed to those  who
are willing to put service over self; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  tradition  of  altruistic public service, heroism and
leadership  embodied  by  the  Yonkers  Police  Department  is  of  such
magnitude  as  to  be  worthy  of  special,  statewide recognition; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 152nd Anniversary of the Yonkers Police Department; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
