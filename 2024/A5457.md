  Section 1. Subdivision (a) of section 1620 of the vehicle and  traffic
 law,  as  amended by chapter 563 of the laws of 2002, is amended to read
 as follows:
  (a) The department of transportation with respect  to  state  highways
 maintained  by the state outside of cities having a population in excess
 of one million, and highways on Indian reservations, may by order,  rule
 or  regulation  establish  higher or lower maximum speed limits at which
 vehicles may proceed on or along such highways than the fifty-five miles
 per hour statutory maximum speed limit.  No  such  maximum  speed  limit
 shall  be  established  at  less than twenty-five miles per hour, except
 that school speed limits may be established at  not  less  than  fifteen
 miles  per hour, for a distance not to exceed one thousand three hundred
 twenty feet, on a highway passing a school building, entrance or exit of
 a school abutting on the highway.  THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MUNICI-
 PALITY WITHIN WHICH A SCHOOL IS LOCATED SHALL  DETERMINE  AND  ESTABLISH
 THE  MAXIMUM SPEED AT WHICH VEHICLES MAY PROCEED ON A HIGHWAY LOCATED IN
 A SCHOOL ZONE. Absence of signs installed pursuant to this section shall
 be presumptive evidence that the department of  transportation  has  not
 established  a  higher maximum speed limit than the fifty-five miles per
 hour statutory limit.
