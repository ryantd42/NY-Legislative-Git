  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Asthma and Allergy Awareness  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as Asthma and
Allergy Awareness Month in the State of New York,  in  conjunction  with
the observance of National Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  the  Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America
(AAFA) declares May as National Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month since
it is peak season for those suffering from asthma and allergies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month is  a  perfect  time  to
educate people about these common diseases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There is no cure for asthma and allergies, and many deaths
are preventable with proper treatment and care; 10 people a day die from
asthma; and
 
  WHEREAS, Asthma affects more than 24.5 million Americans; more  than
six million children under the age of 18 have asthma; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than  50  million Americans suffer from all types of
allergies including pollen, skin, and latex, and the rate  of  allergies
is climbing; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body, representing the people of the State
of  New York, supports the increase in public awareness regarding asthma
and allergies; it is important to help educate all citizens of the State
of New York of the serious and potentially  life-threatening  nature  of
asthma and allergies; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2024,  as  Asthma  and
Allergy Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
