 increase  in  the  consumer  price  index  as defined by paragraph hh of
 subdivision one of this section[, provided that  for  the  two  thousand
 eight--two  thousand  nine  school year, for the purpose of such adjust-
 ment, the percentage increase in  the  consumer  price  index  shall  be

 foundation percent established pursuant to paragraph b of this  subdivi-
 sion],  PROVIDED  THAT  FOR  THE  TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR--TWO THOUSAND
 TWENTY-FIVE SCHOOL YEAR, THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE  CONSUMER  PRICE
 INDEX SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE TWO AND EIGHT-TENTHS PERCENT (0.028).

 (i) the product of (A) the quotient arrived at when the selected  actual
 valuation  is divided by total wealth foundation pupil units, multiplied
 by (B) the product of the local tax factor,  multiplied  by  the  income
 wealth  index,  or (ii) the product of (A) the product of the foundation
 amount, the regional cost index, and the pupil need index, multiplied by
 (B) the positive difference, if any, of  one  minus  the  state  sharing
 ratio  for  total  foundation  aid. The local tax factor shall be estab-
 lished by May first of each year by determining the product, computed to

 the quotient of the sum of the statewide average tax rate as computed by
 the  commissioner for the current year in accordance with the provisions
 of paragraph e of subdivision one of section thirty-six  hundred  nine-e
 of this part plus the statewide average tax rate computed by the commis-
 sioner  for  the  base  year in accordance with such provisions plus the

 receive in the two thousand six--two thousand seven school year pursuant
 to  or  in lieu of paragraph six of subdivision nineteen of this section
 as such paragraph existed on June thirtieth, two thousand  seven,  minus
 the  amount such district was eligible to receive pursuant to or in lieu
 of paragraph five of subdivision nineteen of this section as such  para-
 graph  existed  on  June  thirtieth,  two thousand seven, in such school
 year, and (ii) the sum of one and the percentage increase in the consum-
 er price index for the current year over such consumer price  index  for
 the  two  thousand  six--two  thousand  seven school year, as defined by
 paragraph hh of subdivision one  of  this  section,  PROVIDED  THAT  THE

  § 9.  Foundation aid study. 1. The Nelson A.  Rockefeller institute of
 government of the state university of New York ("the  institute")  shall
 conduct  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  foundation  aid formula ("the
 study"). The institute, in consultation with the state education depart-
 ment, the division of the budget,  and  any  other  state  agencies  the
 institute deems necessary, shall examine, evaluate, and recommend poten-
 tial  modifications  to  the  calculation  of foundation aid pursuant to
 subdivision 4 of section 3602 of the education law. The institute  shall
 contract  with  third  parties  as  necessary to complete the study. The
 institute shall gather and consider feedback provided  by  a  broad  and
 diverse  range  of  stakeholders, including but not limited to education
 organizations, teachers,  parents,  school  administrators,  and  school
 boards.  The  institute shall hold at least three public hearings across
 the state to gather input from such stakeholders.
  2. The results, findings, and recommendations of the  study  shall  be
 for study purposes only, shall not be considered binding upon the execu-
 tive  or  the  legislature  in  any  manner, and shall not establish the
 constitutional minimum cost to provide an opportunity for a sound  basic
 education.
  3.  The  foundation aid formula, as modified by the recommendations of
 the study, shall achieve the following:
  (a) be fiscally sustainable for the state, local taxpayers, and school
 districts; and
  (b) calculate foundation aid payable for all school districts consist-
 ently using only the most recent year or  years  of  available  data  on
 pupil  counts,  student  needs, district income and property wealth, and
 other formula components.
 S. 8306--C  14  A. 8806--C
 
  4. The study shall evaluate each current component of  the  foundation
 aid  formula  and  recommend whether to retain, modify, or eliminate the
 component, and may evaluate and recommend new components to add  to  the
 formula.  Such evaluation shall consider relevant data and research. The
 components  to  be  so evaluated shall include but not be limited to the
 following:
  (a) the foundation amount of instructional spending per pupil;
  (b) the additional weightings for pupil needs, such as  for  free  and
 reduced-price  lunch, census poverty, English language learners, sparsi-
 ty, and pupils with disabilities;
  (c) the adjustment for regional cost differences;
  (d) the calculation of school districts' relative wealth;
  (e) the expected minimum local contribution toward the adjusted  foun-
 dation amount; and
  (f)  the  pupil  counts,  such  as public enrollment and average daily
 membership.
  5. In support of its recommendations, the study  shall  at  a  minimum
 examine the following:
  (a) New York's overall state and local system of funding public educa-
 tion compared to those of other states, including but not limited to the
 methodologies and levels of funding;
  (b)  the  extent  to  which  the current calculation of the foundation
 amount is inconsistent with current  adjustments  for  pupil  needs  and
 regional  cost differences and includes costs supported by other non-lo-
 cal revenues;
  (c) the additional instructional costs associated with addressing  the
 needs  of certain groups of students, including whether and how to prop-
 erly weight students belonging to multiple such groups;
  (d) the extent to which teacher salaries, other professional salaries,

 to establish  maximum  class  sizes  for  special  classes  for  certain

 impact from under-utilization of special education resources due to  low
 student  attendance  in  special  education  classes  at  the middle and
 secondary level as determined by the commissioner, such boards of educa-
 tion shall, during the school years nineteen hundred  ninety-five--nine-
 ty-six  through  June thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-four] TWENTY-FIVE,
 be authorized to increase class  sizes  in  special  classes  containing
 students  with  disabilities whose age ranges are equivalent to those of

 tenths times the applicable maximum class size specified in  regulations
 of  the  commissioner  rounded  up to the nearest whole number, provided
 that in a city school district having a population  of  one  million  or
 more, classes that have a maximum class size of fifteen may be increased
 by  no  more  than  one  student and provided that the projected average
 class size shall not exceed the  maximum  specified  in  the  applicable
 regulation,  provided  that  such  authorization shall terminate on June
 thirtieth, two thousand. Such authorization shall be granted upon filing
 of a notice by such a board of education with the  commissioner  stating
 the  board's  intention to increase such class sizes and a certification
 that the board will conduct  a  study  of  attendance  problems  at  the
 secondary  level and will implement a corrective action plan to increase
 the rate of attendance of students in such classes to at least the  rate
 for students attending regular education classes in secondary schools of
 the  district.  Such  corrective  action  plan  shall  be  submitted for
 approval by the commissioner by a date during the school year  in  which
 such  board  increases class sizes as provided pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion to be prescribed by the commissioner. Upon  at  least  thirty  days
 notice to the board of education, after conclusion of the school year in
 S. 8306--C  23  A. 8806--C
 
 which  such  board  increases  class  sizes as provided pursuant to this
 subdivision, the commissioner shall  be  authorized  to  terminate  such
 authorization  upon  a  finding  that the board has failed to develop or
 implement an approved corrective action plan.

 academic subjects in accordance with this section and shall be in  addi-
 tion  to  salaries heretofore or hereafter negotiated or made available;
 provided, however, that all funds distributed pursuant to  this  section
 for  the  current year shall be deemed to incorporate all funds distrib-
 uted pursuant to former subdivision 27 of section 3602 of the  education
 law  for prior years. In school districts where the teachers are repres-
 ented by certified or  recognized  employee  organizations,  all  salary
 increases  funded  pursuant to this section shall be determined by sepa-
 rate collective negotiations conducted pursuant to  the  provisions  and
 procedures  of  article 14 of the civil service law, notwithstanding the

 appropriations for support of public libraries.
  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law to the contrary the moneys
 appropriated for the support of public libraries for the year 2024--2025
 by a chapter of the laws of 2024 enacting the aid to  localities  budget
 shall  fulfill  the state's obligation to provide such aid and, pursuant
 to a plan developed by the commissioner of education and approved by the
 director of the budget, the aid payable to libraries and library systems
 pursuant to such appropriations  shall  be  reduced  proportionately  to
 assure  that  the  total amount of aid payable does not exceed the total
 appropriations for such purpose.

 equal  to  the  amount  by which such deficit notes exceed the amount of
 such deficits as confirmed by the state  comptroller  into  the  special
 debt service fund.
  § 7. Quarterly budget reports and trial balances. For each fiscal year
 during  the effective period of this act, the city treasurer shall moni-
 tor budgets of the city and, for each budget, prepare a quarterly report
 of summarized budget data depicting overall trends  of  actual  revenues
 and  budget  expenditures  for  the entire budget rather than individual
 line items. Such reports shall compare revenue estimates  and  appropri-
 ations as set forth in such budget with the actual revenues and expendi-
 tures  made  to  date.  All  quarterly reports shall be accompanied by a
 recommendation by the city fiscal  affairs  officer  setting  forth  any
 remedial  action  necessary  to  resolve any unfavorable budget variance
 including the overestimation of  revenues  and  the  underestimation  of
 appropriations,  and shall be completed within thirty days of the end of
 each quarter. The city treasurer shall also prepare,  as  part  of  such
 report,  a quarterly trial balance of general ledger accounts. The above
 quarterly budgetary  reports  and  quarterly  trial  balances  shall  be
 prepared  in  accordance  with applicable accounting principles incorpo-
 rated in the uniform system of accounts prescribed by  the  state  comp-
 troller.  These  reports  shall  be submitted to the city fiscal affairs
 officer, the mayor, the city council, the state director of the  budget,

 vote on the adoption of the final budget or the last date on  which  the
 S. 8306--C  88  A. 8806--C
 
 budget  may  be  finally  adopted,  whichever is sooner. The state comp-
 troller shall examine such proposed budget and make such recommendations
 as deemed appropriate thereon to the city prior to the adoption  of  the
 budget,  but  no  later  than ten days before the date scheduled for the
 city council's vote on the adoption of the final budget or the last date
 on which the budget must be adopted, whichever is sooner. Such recommen-
 dations shall be made after examination into the estimates  of  revenues
 and  expenditures of the city. The city council, no later than five days
 prior to the adoption of the budget, shall review any  such  recommenda-
 tions  and  make  adjustments to the proposed budget consistent with any
 recommendations made by the state comptroller.
  § 9. Multiyear financial plans. During the effective  period  of  this
 act,  the  city  fiscal  affairs  officer  shall prepare, along with the
 proposed budget for the next succeeding fiscal year, a three-year finan-
 cial plan covering the next succeeding fiscal year and  the  two  fiscal
 years  thereafter.  The  financial  plan  shall,  at  a minimum, contain
 projected employment levels, projected annual expenditures for  personal
 service, fringe benefits, non-personal services and debt service; appro-
 priate reserve fund amounts; estimated annual revenues including projec-
 tion  of  property tax rates, the value of the taxable real property and
 resulting tax levy, annual growth in  sales  tax  and  non-property  tax
 revenues;  and  the proposed use of one-time revenue sources. The finan-
 cial plan shall also identify actions necessary to achieve and  maintain
 long-term  fiscal  stability,  including,  but  not limited to, improved
 management  practices,  initiatives  to  minimize  or  reduce  operating
 expenses,  and  potential  shared services agreements with other munici-
 palities. Within thirty days following the adoption by the city  council
 of  the  budget  for  the  next  succeeding  fiscal  year  and  upon the
 completion of each quarterly budget report pursuant to section seven  of
 this  act,  the  city  fiscal affairs officer shall update the financial
 plan consistent with  such  adopted  budget  or  such  quarterly  budget
 report. Copies of the financial plan and any update shall be provided to
 the  city  treasurer, the mayor, the city council, the state director of
 the budget, the state comptroller, the chair of the  assembly  ways  and
 means committee, and the chair of the senate finance committee.
  §  10.  State  comptroller to comment on further debt issuance. During
 the effective period of this act, the city treasurer  shall  notify  the
 state  comptroller  at  least  fifteen days prior to the issuance of any
 bonds or notes or entering into any installment purchase  contract,  and
 the  state comptroller may review and make recommendations regarding the
 affordability to the city of any such proposed issuance or contract.
  § 11. Private sale of bonds authorized. To facilitate the marketing of
 (a) deficit bonds, (b) any bonds issued to refund  such  deficit  bonds,
 and (c) any other bonds to be issued on or before December 31, 2025, the
 city  may,  notwithstanding any limitation on the private sales of bonds
 provided by law and subject to the approval of the state comptroller  of
 the terms and conditions of such sales:
  (1) arrange for the underwriting of such bonds at private sale through
 negotiated fees or by sale of such bonds to an underwriter; or
  (2)  arrange  for  the  private  sale of such bonds through negotiated
 agreement, with compensation for such sales to be provided by negotiated
 agreement and/or negotiated fee, if required.
  The cost of such underwriting or private placement shall be deemed  to
 be a preliminary cost for purposes of section 11.00 of the local finance
 law.
 S. 8306--C  89  A. 8806--C
 
  §  12. Exceptions to the local finance law. Except as provided in this
 act, all proceedings in connection with the  issuance  of  such  deficit
 bonds  or  deficit  notes  shall be had and taken in accordance with the
 provisions of the local finance law, provided, however, that any  resol-
 ution  or  resolutions  authorizing  the  issuance of such bonds or bond
 anticipation notes shall not be subject to (a) any mandatory or  permis-
 sive  referendum,  (b)  the  provisions  of  section 107.00 of the local
 finance law with respect to any requirements for a down payment and  (c)
 the provisions of section 10.10 of the local finance law.
  §  13. Special debt service fund. (a) Upon the issuance of any deficit
 bonds or deficit notes, the city council shall establish and  thereafter
 maintain  a special debt service fund with the state comptroller for the
 purpose of paying the special debt service due or becoming due in subse-
 quent fiscal years. Such special debt service fund shall be discontinued
 upon the expiration of the effectiveness of this act,  and  any  balance
 remaining in the special debt service fund at that time shall be paid by
 the  state  comptroller to the city treasurer for use by the city in the
 manner provided by law.
  (b) The state comptroller shall deposit and pay into the special  debt
 service  fund  any  portion of state aid as the state comptroller deter-
 mines necessary to ensure sufficient moneys are available to make sched-
 uled special debt service payments from the special  debt  service  fund
 over  the  succeeding  twelve  month period taking account of the city's
 receipt of city taxes and state aid during such twelve month period  and
 the  availability of other amounts appropriated or set aside by the city
 to make such payments. Thereafter, the state comptroller shall, as  soon
 as practicable, pay over the remainder of any such state aid to the city
 treasurer for use by the city in the manner provided by law.
  (c)  Not  later than the first day of each fiscal year beginning after
 issuance of any deficit bonds or deficit notes, the city treasurer shall
 certify to the state comptroller the percentage obtained by dividing the
 balance obtained by subtracting the amount of the appropriation for such
 year for a reserve for uncollected taxes from the total amount  of  city
 taxes levied and assessed for such year, into the total appropriation in
 the  budget of such year for special debt service, and the percentage so
 certified shall constitute the debt service percentage for  such  fiscal
 year. Immediately upon receipt of any payment during such fiscal year of
 or  on  account  of any city taxes, the city, its collecting officer and
 any agent receiving the same shall remit such payment to the state comp-
 troller. Of each sum so received, the state  comptroller  shall  deposit
 and  pay into the special debt service fund the portion thereof equal to
 the debt service percentage of the total sum, and shall deposit and  pay
 into  the  fund  such additional amounts as the state comptroller deter-
 mines necessary to ensure sufficient moneys are available to make sched-
 uled special debt service payments from the special  debt  service  fund
 over  the succeeding twelve month period taking account of the timing of
 the city's receipt of city taxes and state aid during such twelve  month
 period  and  the availability of other amounts appropriated or set aside
 by the city to make such payments.  Thereafter,  the  state  comptroller
 shall, as soon as practicable, pay over the remainder of such sum to the
 city treasurer for use by the city in the manner provided by law.
  (d)  The  moneys in the special debt service fund shall be invested in
 the manner  provided  by  section  11  of  the  general  municipal  law,
 provided,  however, that the investments shall be made for and on behalf
 of the city by the state comptroller upon instructions  from  the  chief
 fiscal  officer  of  the  city which shall be consistent with the city's
 S. 8306--C  90  A. 8806--C

 investment policy adopted pursuant to section 39 of the general  munici-
 pal law.
  (e)  The  state comptroller shall from time to time during each fiscal
 year withdraw from the special debt service fund  all  amounts  required
 for  the  payment as the same becomes due of all special debt service of
 such fiscal year and cause the amounts so withdrawn  to  be  applied  to
 such payments as and when due.
  (f) The special debt service fund and all monies or securities therein
 or payable thereto in accordance with this section is hereby declared to
 be  city property devoted to essential governmental purposes and accord-
 ingly, shall not be applied to any purpose other than as provided herein
 and shall not be  subject  to  any  order,  judgment,  lien,  execution,
 attachment,  setoff  or  counterclaim  by any creditor of the city other
 than a creditor for whose benefit such fund  is  established  and  main-
 tained and entitled thereto under and pursuant to this act.
  §  14.  Agreement  with the state. (a) The state does hereby pledge to
 and agree with the holders of any  bonds,  notes  or  other  obligations
 issued  by  the city during the effective period of this act and secured
 by such a pledge that the state will not  limit,  alter  or  impair  the
 rights  hereby vested in the city to fulfill the terms of any agreements
 made with such holders pursuant to this act, or in any  way  impair  the
 rights  and  remedies  of  such  holders or the security for such bonds,
 notes or other obligations until such bonds, notes or other  obligations
 together  with  the  interest  thereon  and  all  costs  and expenses in
 connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of  such  hold-
 ers,  are  fully  paid and discharged. The city is authorized to include
 this pledge and agreement of the state in any agreement with the holders
 of such bonds, notes or other obligations. Nothing contained in this act
 shall be deemed to (i) obligate the state to make any payments or impose
 any taxes to satisfy the debt service  obligations  of  the  city,  (ii)
 restrict  any  right  of the state to amend, modify, repeal or otherwise
 alter (A) section 54 of the state finance law  or  any  other  provision
 relating  to state aid, or (B) statutes imposing or relating to taxes or
 fees, or appropriations relating thereto, or (iii) create a debt of  the
 state  within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provisions.
 The city shall not include in any resolution, contract or agreement with
 holders of such bonds, notes or other obligations  any  provision  which
 provides  that an event of default occurs as a result of the state exer-
 cising its rights described in paragraph (ii) of this subdivision.
  (b) Any provision with respect to state aid shall be deemed  executory
 only  to  the  extent  of  moneys  available,  and no liability shall be
 incurred by the state beyond the moneys available for that purpose,  and
 any  such payment by the state comptroller of state aid shall be subject
 to annual appropriation of state aid by the state legislature.
  § 15. Rights of the state comptroller  and  bondholders.  (a)  In  the
 event that the city shall fail to comply with any provision of this act,
 and  such non-compliance shall continue for a period of 30 days, (1) the
 state comptroller acting alone, or (2) a duly  appointed  representative
 of  the  holders of at least 25 per centum in aggregate principal amount

 duly  appointed  representative of the bondholders of any such series of
 notes or bonds may bring an action or commence a proceeding  in  accord-
 ance  with the civil practice law and rules to enforce the rights of the
 holders of such series of notes or bonds.
  (b) The supreme court in the county of Chautauqua shall have jurisdic-
 tion of any action or proceeding by the state comptroller or the  repre-
 sentative of such bondholders.
  § 16. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section
 or  part  of this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent juris-
 diction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invali-
 date the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in  its  operation  to
 the clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part involved in the contro-
 versy in which such judgment shall have been rendered. The provisions of
 this  act shall be liberally construed to assist the effectuation of the
 public purposes furthered hereby.

 force and effect until the fifteenth anniversary of the  date  of  first
 issuance  of  deficit  bonds or deficit notes pursuant to this act, when
 upon such date the provisions of this act shall be deemed repealed;  and
 provided,  however, that the state comptroller shall notify the legisla-
 tive bill drafting commission upon the occurrence of this act  in  order
 that  the  commission may maintain an accurate and timely effective data
 base of the official text of the laws of the state of New York in furth-
 erance of effectuating the provisions of section 44 of  the  legislative
 law and section 70-b of the public officers law.

  (A)  (I)  THE  TENANT  HAS  FAILED TO PAY RENT DUE AND OWING, PROVIDED
 HOWEVER THAT THE RENT DUE AND OWING, OR ANY PART THEREOF, DID NOT RESULT
 FROM A RENT INCREASE WHICH IS UNREASONABLE. IN DETERMINING  WHETHER  ALL
 OR  PART OF THE RENT DUE AND OWING IS THE RESULT OF AN UNREASONABLE RENT

 DWELLING  NOT  PROTECTED BY RENT REGULATION IS UNREASONABLE IF SAID RENT

 ABLE,  THE  COURT  MAY  CONSIDER  ALL  RELEVANT FACTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO A LANDLORD'S COSTS FOR FUEL AND OTHER  UTILITIES,  INSURANCE,
 AND  MAINTENANCE;  BUT  IN ALL CASES, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER THE LAND-
 LORD'S PROPERTY TAX EXPENSES AND  ANY  RECENT  INCREASES  THERETO;  SUCH
 RELEVANT  FACTS  ALSO  SHALL INCLUDE WHETHER THE LANDLORD, OTHER THAN IN
 CIRCUMSTANCES GOVERNED BY PARAGRAPH (D) OF THIS  SUBDIVISION,  SEEKS  IN
 GOOD  FAITH  TO RAISE THE RENT UPON A RENEWAL LEASE TO REFLECT COMPLETED
 SIGNIFICANT REPAIRS TO THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION, OR TO ANY  OTHER  PART
 OF  THE  BUILDING OR REAL PROPERTY IN WHICH THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION IS
 LOCATED, PROVIDED THAT THE  LANDLORD  CAN  ESTABLISH  THAT  THE  REPAIRS
 CONSTITUTED  SIGNIFICANT  REPAIRS  AND  THAT SUCH REPAIRS DID NOT RESULT
 FROM THE LANDLORD'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN THE BUILDING OR HOUSING
 ACCOMMODATION, AND PROVIDED  FURTHER  THAT  FOR  THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS
 SUBPARAGRAPH,  "SIGNIFICANTLY  REPAIR" MEANS THE REPLACEMENT OR SUBSTAN-
 TIAL MODIFICATION OF ANY STRUCTURAL, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING, OR MECHANICAL
 SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES A PERMIT FROM A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY,  OR  ABATEMENT
 OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, INCLUDING LEAD-BASED PAINT, MOLD, OR ASBESTOS IN
 ACCORDANCE  WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS, AND PROVIDED
 FURTHER COSMETIC IMPROVEMENTS ALONE, INCLUDING PAINTING, DECORATING, AND

 OR  BREACHING ANY OF THE LANDLORD'S RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING SAID
 PREMISES, OTHER THAN THE OBLIGATION TO  SURRENDER  POSSESSION,  AND  HAS
 FAILED  TO  CURE  SUCH VIOLATION AFTER WRITTEN NOTICE THAT THE VIOLATION
 CEASE WITHIN TEN DAYS OF RECEIPT OF SUCH WRITTEN NOTICE, PROVIDED HOWEV-
 ER, THAT THE OBLIGATION OF TENANCY FOR WHICH VIOLATION  IS  CLAIMED  WAS
 NOT  IMPOSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CIRCUMVENTING THE INTENT OF THIS ARTICLE
 AND PROVIDED SUCH RULES OR REGULATIONS  ARE  REASONABLE  AND  HAVE  BEEN
 ACCEPTED  IN  WRITING  BY  THE TENANT OR MADE A PART OF THE LEASE AT THE
 BEGINNING OF THE LEASE TERM;
  (C) THE TENANT IS COMMITTING OR PERMITTING A NUISANCE IN SUCH  HOUSING
 ACCOMMODATION,  OR  ELSEWHERE IN THE BUILDING OR ON THE REAL PROPERTY IN
 WHICH THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION IS LOCATED,  OR  IS  MALICIOUSLY  OR  BY
 REASON  OF  GROSS NEGLIGENCE SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGING THE HOUSING ACCOMMO-
 DATION, OR CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE ELSEWHERE IN THE  BUILDING  OR  ON
 THE  REAL PROPERTY IN WHICH THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION IS LOCATED; OR THE
 TENANT'S CONDUCT IS SUCH AS TO INTERFERE WITH THE COMFORT AND SAFETY  OF
 THE  LANDLORD OR OTHER TENANTS OR OCCUPANTS OF THE SAME OR ANOTHER ADJA-
 CENT BUILDING OR STRUCTURE;
  (D) OCCUPANCY OF  THE  HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION  BY  THE  TENANT  IS  IN
 VIOLATION OF OR CAUSES A VIOLATION OF LAW AND THE LANDLORD IS SUBJECT TO
 CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES THEREFOR; PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT AN AGENCY OF
 THE  STATE  OR  MUNICIPALITY  HAVING  JURISDICTION  HAS  ISSUED AN ORDER
 REQUIRING THE TENANT TO VACATE  THE  HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION.  NO  TENANT
 SHALL  BE  REMOVED  FROM  POSSESSION  OF A HOUSING ACCOMMODATION ON SUCH
 GROUND UNLESS THE COURT FINDS THAT THE CURE  OF  THE  VIOLATION  OF  LAW
 REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF THE TENANT AND THAT THE LANDLORD DID NOT THROUGH
 NEGLECT  OR  DELIBERATE  ACTION  OR  FAILURE TO ACT CREATE THE CONDITION
 NECESSITATING THE VACATE ORDER. IN INSTANCES WHERE THE LANDLORD DOES NOT
 S. 8306--C  114  A. 8806--C
 
 UNDERTAKE TO CURE CONDITIONS OF THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION  CAUSING  SUCH
 VIOLATION  OF  THE LAW, THE TENANT SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PAY OR SECURE
 PAYMENT IN A MANNER SATISFACTORY TO THE COURT, TO  CURE  SUCH  VIOLATION
 PROVIDED  THAT  ANY TENANT EXPENDITURES SHALL BE APPLIED AGAINST RENT TO
 WHICH THE LANDLORD IS ENTITLED. IN INSTANCES WHERE REMOVAL OF  A  TENANT
 IS  ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO SUCH TENANT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY, THE REMOVAL
 OF THE TENANT SHALL BE WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ANY  LEASEHOLD  INTEREST  OR
 OTHER  RIGHT  OF  OCCUPANCY  THE TENANT MAY HAVE AND THE TENANT SHALL BE
 ENTITLED TO RESUME POSSESSION AT SUCH TIME AS THE  DANGEROUS  CONDITIONS
 HAVE  BEEN REMOVED. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL ABROGATE OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THE
 RIGHT OF A TENANT TO BRING AN ACTION FOR MONETARY  DAMAGES  AGAINST  THE
 LANDLORD  OR  TO  OTHERWISE  COMPEL  COMPLIANCE BY THE LANDLORD WITH ALL
 APPLICABLE STATE OR MUNICIPAL HOUSING CODES;
  (E) THE TENANT IS USING OR PERMITTING THE  HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION,  OR
 ELSEWHERE  IN  THE BUILDING OR ON THE REAL PROPERTY IN WHICH THE HOUSING
 ACCOMMODATION IS LOCATED, TO BE USED FOR AN ILLEGAL PURPOSE;
  (F) THE TENANT HAS UNREASONABLY REFUSED THE  LANDLORD  ACCESS  TO  THE
 HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION  FOR  THE  PURPOSE OF MAKING NECESSARY REPAIRS OR
 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED BY LAW OR FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING  THE  HOUSING
 ACCOMMODATION  TO  A  PROSPECTIVE  PURCHASER,  MORTGAGEE OR OTHER PERSON
 HAVING A LEGITIMATE INTEREST THEREIN;
  (G) THE LANDLORD SEEKS IN GOOD FAITH TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF A  HOUS-

 PARENT-IN-LAW OR SIBLING-IN-LAW, WHEN NO OTHER SUITABLE HOUSING ACCOMMO-
 DATION IN SUCH BUILDING IS AVAILABLE, PROVIDED THAT NO JUDGMENT IN FAVOR
 OF THE LANDLORD MAY BE GRANTED PURSUANT TO  THIS  PARAGRAPH  UNLESS  THE
 LANDLORD  ESTABLISHES  GOOD  FAITH  TO  RECOVER  POSSESSION OF A HOUSING
 ACCOMMODATION FOR THE LANDLORD'S OWN PERSONAL USE AND OCCUPANCY  AS  THE
 LANDLORD'S  PRINCIPAL  RESIDENCE, OR THE PERSONAL USE AND OCCUPANCY AS A
 PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE OF THE LANDLORD'S SPOUSE, DOMESTIC  PARTNER,  CHILD,
 STEPCHILD,  PARENT,  STEP-PARENT,  SIBLING,  GRANDPARENT,  GRANDCHILD,

 KNOWN  AS  THE  NEW  YORK STATE GOOD CAUSE EVICTION LAW, AND THIS NOTICE
 SERVES TO INFORM A TENANT THAT THE LANDLORD IS  NOT  RENEWING  A  LEASE,
 WHAT  IS  THE  GOOD  CAUSE  FOR NOT RENEWING THE LEASE? (PLEASE MARK ALL
 APPLICABLE REASONS)
 A. THIS UNIT IS EXEMPT FROM ARTICLE 6-A OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW,  KNOWN
 AS THE NEW YORK STATE GOOD CAUSE EVICTION LAW, FOR THE REASONS STATED IN
 RESPONSE  TO  QUESTION  2,  ABOVE  (IF  THIS ANSWER IS CHECKED, NO OTHER

 S. 8306--C  119  A. 8806--C
 
 B. THE TENANT IS RECEIVING THIS NOTICE IN CONNECTION WITH A FIRST  LEASE
 OR  A  RENEWAL  LEASE, SO THE LANDLORD DOES NOT NEED TO CHECK ANY OF THE
 LAWFUL REASONS LISTED BELOW FOR NOT RENEWING A LEASE UNDER  ARTICLE  6-A
 OF  THE  REAL  PROPERTY  LAW,  KNOWN  AS  THE  NEW YORK STATE GOOD CAUSE
 EVICTION  LAW (IF THIS ANSWER IS CHECKED, NO OTHER ANSWERS TO THIS QUES-
 TION SHOULD BE CHECKED) ___;
 C. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE UNIT IS SUBLET AND
 THE SUBLESSOR SEEKS IN GOOD FAITH TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE UNIT  FOR
 THEIR  OWN  PERSONAL USE AND OCCUPANCY (EXEMPTION UNDER SUBDIVISION 3 OF
 SECTION 214 OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 D. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE POSSESSION, USE OR
 OCCUPANCY OF THE UNIT IS SOLELY INCIDENT TO EMPLOYMENT AND  THE  EMPLOY-
 MENT  IS BEING OR HAS BEEN LAWFULLY TERMINATED (EXEMPTION UNDER SUBDIVI-
 SION 4 OF SECTION 214 OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 E. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE TENANT HAS  FAILED
 TO PAY RENT DUE AND OWING, AND THE RENT DUE OR OWING, OR ANY PART THERE-
 OF,  DID  NOT  RESULT FROM A RENT INCREASE WHICH IS UNREASONABLE. A RENT
 INCREASE IS PRESUMPTIVELY UNREASONABLE IF THE INCREASE  FROM  THE  PRIOR
 RENT  IS  GREATER  THAN  THE  LOWER  OF:  (A)  5 PERCENT PLUS THE ANNUAL
 PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR  ALL  URBAN  CONSUMERS
 FOR  ALL ITEMS AS PUBLISHED BY THE UNITED STATES BUREAU OF LABOR STATIS-
 TICS FOR THE REGION IN WHICH THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION  IS  LOCATED,  AS
 PUBLISHED  NOT  LATER  THAN  AUGUST  1ST OF EACH YEAR BY THE DIVISION OF
 HOUSING AND COMMUNITY  RENEWAL;  OR  (B)  10  PERCENT  (GOOD  CAUSE  FOR
 EVICTION  UNDER  PARAGRAPH A OF SUBDIVISION 1 OF SECTION 216 OF THE REAL
 PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 F. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE TENANT IS  VIOLAT-
 ING  A  SUBSTANTIAL  OBLIGATION OF THEIR TENANCY OR BREACHING ANY OF THE
 LANDLORD'S RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE PREMISES, OTHER THAN  THE
 OBLIGATION  TO  SURRENDER POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES, AND THE TENANT HAS
 FAILED TO CURE THE VIOLATION AFTER WRITTEN  NOTICE  THAT  THE  VIOLATION
 MUST  CEASE  WITHIN  10  DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THE WRITTEN NOTICE. FOR THIS
 GOOD CAUSE TO APPLY, THE OBLIGATION THE TENANT  VIOLATED  CANNOT  BE  AN
 OBLIGATION  THAT WAS IMPOSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CIRCUMVENTING THE INTENT
 OF ARTICLE 6-A OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW, KNOWN AS  THE  NEW  YORK  STATE
 GOOD  CAUSE  EVICTION  LAW. THE LANDLORD'S RULES OR REGULATIONS THAT THE
 TENANT HAS VIOLATED ALSO MUST BE REASONABLE AND HAVE  BEEN  ACCEPTED  IN
 WRITING  BY  THE  TENANT OR MADE A PART OF THE LEASE AT THE BEGINNING OF
 THE LEASE TERM (GOOD CAUSE FOR EVICTION UNDER PARAGRAPH B OF SUBDIVISION
 1 OF SECTION 216 OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 G. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE TENANT  IS  EITHER
 (A) COMMITTING OR PERMITTING A NUISANCE ON THE UNIT OR THE PREMISES; (B)
 MALICIOUSLY  OR  GROSSLY  NEGLIGENTLY  CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE
 UNIT OR THE PREMISES;  (C)  INTERFERING  WITH  THE  LANDLORD'S,  ANOTHER
 TENANT'S,  OR  OCCUPANTS  OF  THE SAME OR AN ADJACENT BUILDING OR STRUC-
 TURE'S COMFORT AND SAFETY (GOOD CAUSE FOR EVICTION UNDER PARAGRAPH C  OF
 SUBDIVISION 1 OF SECTION 216 OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 H. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE TENANT'S OCCUPANCY
 OF  THE UNIT VIOLATES LAW AND THE LANDLORD IS SUBJECT TO CIVIL OR CRIMI-
 NAL PENALTIES FOR CONTINUING TO LET THE TENANT OCCUPY THE UNIT. FOR THIS
 GOOD CAUSE TO APPLY, A STATE OR  MUNICIPAL  AGENCY  HAVING  JURISDICTION
 MUST  HAVE  ISSUED  AN ORDER REQUIRING THE TENANT TO VACATE THE UNIT. NO
 TENANT SHALL BE REMOVED FROM POSSESSION OF A UNIT ON THIS  BASIS  UNLESS
 THE  COURT  FINDS  THAT  THE  CURE  OF THE VIOLATION OF LAW REQUIRES THE
 REMOVAL OF THE TENANT AND THAT THE LANDLORD DID NOT, THROUGH NEGLECT  OR
 DELIBERATE  ACTION OR FAILURE TO ACT, CREATE THE CONDITION NECESSITATING
 S. 8306--C  120  A. 8806--C

 THE VACATE ORDER. IF THE LANDLORD DOES NOT TRY TO  CURE  THE  CONDITIONS
 CAUSING  THE  VIOLATION  OF  THE LAW, THE TENANT HAS THE RIGHT TO PAY OR
 SECURE PAYMENT, IN A MANNER SATISFACTORY  TO  THE  COURT,  TO  CURE  THE
 VIOLATION.  ANY  TENANT  EXPENDITURES  TO  CURE  THE  VIOLATION SHALL BE
 APPLIED AGAINST RENT OWED TO THE LANDLORD. EVEN IF REMOVAL OF  A  TENANT
 IS  ABSOLUTELY  ESSENTIAL  TO THE TENANT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY, THE TENANT
 SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RESUME POSSESSION AT SUCH  TIME  AS  THE  DANGEROUS
 CONDITIONS  HAVE  BEEN  REMOVED.  THE TENANT ALSO RETAINS THE RIGHT TO
 BRING AN ACTION FOR MONETARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE LANDLORD OR  TO  OTHER-
 WISE  COMPEL THE LANDLORD TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE STATE OR MUNICI-
 PAL HOUSING CODES (GOOD CAUSE FOR EVICTION UNDER PARAGRAPH D OF SUBDIVI-
 SION 1 OF SECTION 216 OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW):  ___;
 I. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE TENANT IS USING OR
 PERMITTING THE UNIT OR PREMISES TO BE USED FOR AN ILLEGAL PURPOSE  (GOOD
 CAUSE  FOR EVICTION UNDER PARAGRAPH E OF SUBDIVISION 1 OF SECTION 216 OF
 THE REAL PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 J. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE TENANT HAS  UNREA-
 SONABLY  REFUSED  THE  LANDLORD  ACCESS  TO THE UNIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF
 MAKING NECESSARY REPAIRS OR IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED  BY  LAW  OR  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES  OF SHOWING THE PREMISES TO A PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER, MORTGAGEE,
 OR OTHER PERSON WITH A LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN THE PREMISES  (GOOD  CAUSE
 FOR  EVICTION  UNDER  PARAGRAPH F OF SUBDIVISION 1 OF SECTION 216 OF THE
 REAL PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 K. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE LANDLORD SEEKS  IN
 GOOD FAITH TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE UNIT FOR THE LANDLORD'S PERSONAL
 USE  AND  OCCUPANCY  AS  THE  LANDLORD'S PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE, OR FOR THE
 PERSONAL USE AND OCCUPANCY AS A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE  BY  THE  LANDLORD'S
 SPOUSE,  DOMESTIC  PARTNER,  CHILD,  STEPCHILD,  PARENT,  STEP-PARENT,
 SIBLING, GRANDPARENT, GRANDCHILD, PARENT-IN-LAW, OR SIBLING-IN-LAW.  THE
 LANDLORD  CAN  ONLY  RECOVER  THE UNIT FOR THESE PURPOSES IF THERE IS NO
 OTHER SUITABLE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION IN THE BUILDING THAT IS  AVAILABLE.
 UNDER  NO  CIRCUMSTANCES  CAN  THE  LANDLORD  RECOVER THE UNIT FOR THESE
 PURPOSES IF THE TENANT IS (A) 65 YEARS OLD OR OLDER; OR (B) A  "DISABLED
 PERSON"  AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION 6 OF SECTION 211 OF THE REAL PROPERTY
 LAW. TO ESTABLISH THIS GOOD CAUSE IN AN EVICTION PROCEEDING,  THE  LAND-
 LORD MUST ESTABLISH GOOD FAITH TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF A HOUSING ACCOM-
 MODATION  FOR THE USES DESCRIBED HEREIN BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE
 (GOOD CAUSE FOR EVICTION UNDER PARAGRAPH G OF SUBDIVISION 1  OF  SECTION
 216 OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW):  ___;

 FAITH SEEKS TO DEMOLISH THE HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION.  TO  ESTABLISH  THIS
 GOOD  CAUSE  IN AN EVICTION PROCEEDING, THE LANDLORD MUST ESTABLISH GOOD
 FAITH TO DEMOLISH THE HOUSING  ACCOMMODATION  BY  CLEAR  AND  CONVINCING
 EVIDENCE  (GOOD CAUSE FOR EVICTION UNDER PARAGRAPH H OF SUBDIVISION 1 OF
 SECTION 216 OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 M. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE LANDLORD SEEKS  IN
 GOOD  FAITH  TO  WITHDRAW  THE  UNIT  FROM THE HOUSING RENTAL MARKET. TO
 ESTABLISH THIS GOOD CAUSE IN AN EVICTION PROCEEDING, THE  LANDLORD  MUST
 ESTABLISH GOOD FAITH TO WITHDRAW THE UNIT FROM THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET
 BY  CLEAR  AND  CONVINCING EVIDENCE (GOOD CAUSE FOR EVICTION UNDER PARA-
 GRAPH I OF SUBDIVISION 1 OF SECTION 216 OF THE REAL PROPERTY LAW): ___;
 N. THE LANDLORD IS NOT RENEWING THE LEASE BECAUSE THE TENANT HAS  FAILED
 TO  AGREE  TO  REASONABLE CHANGES AT LEASE RENEWAL, INCLUDING REASONABLE
 INCREASES IN RENT, AND THE LANDLORD GAVE WRITTEN NOTICE OF  THE  CHANGES
 TO  THE  LEASE TO THE TENANT AT LEAST 30 DAYS, BUT NO MORE THAN 90 DAYS,
 BEFORE THE CURRENT LEASE  EXPIRED.  A  RENT  INCREASE  IS  PRESUMPTIVELY

 ER PRICE INDEX FOR ALL URBAN CONSUMERS FOR ALL ITEMS AS PUBLISHED BY THE
 UNITED  STATES  BUREAU  OF  LABOR STATISTICS FOR THE REGION IN WHICH THE
 HOUSING ACCOMMODATION IS LOCATED, AS PUBLISHED BY  AUGUST  1ST  OF  EACH
 YEAR BY THE DIVISION OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL; OR (B) 10 PERCENT

  (IV) a comparison of the aggregate type, number, and severity of acci-
 dents  reported  on  streets  on which street calming measures and lower
 speed limits were implemented in the year preceding  the  implementation
 S. 8306--C  133  A. 8806--C

  (ii)  Subject to the provisions of subdivision f of this section where
 those provisions are applicable, and notwithstanding the  provisions  of
 subdivisions  a  and  c  of section six hundred eight of the RSSL, for a
 tier IV member of NYCERS who is a New York city revised plan member  (as
 defined  in  subdivision  m of section six hundred one of the RSSL) or a
 tier IV member of BERS who is a New York city revised plan  member,  the

 S. 8306--C  137  A. 8806--C
 
 excluded from the computation of final average salary, provided  further
 that  "wages",  as  used  in  this  paragraph, shall mean the applicable
 provisions and limitations of the term "wages", as defined  in  subdivi-
 sion l of section six hundred one of the RSSL.
  §  4. Subdivision a of section 1209 of the retirement and social secu-
 rity law, as amended by chapter 705 of the laws of 2023, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  a.  For  members  who  first  become members of the New York state and
 local police and fire retirement system on or  after  April  first,  two
 thousand  twelve, a member's final average salary shall be equal to one-
 fifth of the highest total  wages  earned  by  such  member  during  any
 continuous  period  of employment for which the member was credited with
 five years of service credit; provided, however,  if  the  wages  earned
 during  any  year  of  credited  service  included in the period used to
 determine final average salary exceeds the average of the wages  of  the
 previous  four  years  of credited service by more than ten percent, the
 amount in excess of ten percent shall be excluded from  the  computation
 of final average salary.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, BEGINNING ON OR AFTER APRIL
 FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, A MEMBER'S FINAL AVERAGE SALARY SHALL
 BE EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF THE HIGHEST TOTAL WAGES EARNED BY  SUCH  MEMBER
 DURING  ANY  CONTINUOUS  PERIOD  OF  EMPLOYMENT FOR WHICH THE MEMBER WAS
 CREDITED WITH THREE YEARS OF SERVICE CREDIT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,  IF  THE
 WAGES  EARNED DURING ANY YEAR OF CREDITED SERVICE INCLUDED IN THE PERIOD
 USED TO DETERMINE FINAL AVERAGE SALARY EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE OF THE  WAGES
 OF  THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE BY MORE THAN TEN PERCENT,
 THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF TEN PERCENT SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE  COMPUTA-
 TION  OF FINAL AVERAGE SALARY. Wages in excess of the annual salary paid
 to the governor pursuant to section three of article four of  the  state
 constitution  shall  be  excluded  from the computation of final average
 salary for members who first become members of the New  York  state  and
 local  police  and  fire  retirement system on or after April first, two
 thousand twelve.
  § 5.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall be subject  to  section  25  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide Tier 6 members in the New York State and Local
 Retirement  System  a final average salary based on their highest salary
 earned over three consecutive years, where the salary earned in any year
 cannot exceed the average of the previous two years by  more  than  10%.
 Currently,  final  average  salary  for  these members is based on their
 highest salary earned over five  consecutive  years,  where  the  salary
 earned  in any year cannot exceed the average of the previous four years
 by more than 10%. The provisions of Section 25  of  the  Retirement  and
 Social Security Law shall not apply.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be shared by  the
 State  of New York and the local participating employers in the NYSLERS.
 If this bill were enacted  during  the  2024  Legislative  Session,  the
 increase  in  the present value of benefits would be approximately $1.17
 billion.
  NYSLERS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $0  $220 million
  Tier 6  $1.17 billion  $950 million
 S. 8306--C  138  A. 8806--C

  Total  $1.17 billion  $1.17 billion
 
  In  the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in  NYSLERS  is  0.4%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately $51 million to the State of New York and approximately $76
 million to the local participating employers. THIS PERMANENT ANNUAL COST
 WILL  INCREASE  as  Tier  6 salary grows and will vary by employer based
 upon the plan coverage and salary reported in Tier 6.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $341 million.
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1 - 5  $0  $33 million
  Tier 6  $341 million  $308 million
  Total  $341 million  $341 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in the NYSLPFRS is 0.70% of billable salary,  or
 approximately  $6.0  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $25 million to the local participating employers.  THE PERMANENT  ANNUAL
 COST  WILL  INCREASE  as  Tier  6 salary grows and will vary by employer
 based upon the plan coverage and salary reported in Tier 6.
  These estimated costs are based on  265,533  Tier  6  members  in  the
 NYSLERS and 16,599 Tier 6 members in the NYSLPFRS, with annual salary of
 approximately  $12  billion  and $1.5 billion, respectively, as of March
 31, 2023.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As  it relates to the New York State Teacher's Retirement System, this
 bill would amend subdivisions a and b of Section 608 of  the  Retirement
 and Social Security Law to change the definition of final average salary
 for  Tier  6 members to be the same as that for Tier 3, 4 and 5 members.
 The final average salary for Tier 6 members would be based on any  three
 consecutive  years  which produce the highest average salary. Currently,
 the final average salary for Tier 6 members is  based  on  the  salaries
 earned during any five consecutive years which provide the highest aver-
 age  salary. Additionally, under the bill, as in Tier 3, 4 and 5, if the
 salary for any year used in the period exceeds that of  the  average  of
 the  prior two years by more than 10%, the amount in excess of 10% shall
 be excluded from the computation. Currently, under Tier 6, if the salary
 for any year used in the period exceeds that of the average of the prior
 four years by more than 10%, the amount in excess  of  10%  is  excluded
 from the computation.
  The  annual  cost  to  the  employers of members of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System for this benefit is estimated  to  be  $23.1
 million or 0.12% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The  System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer contribution
 rate that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without  any
 assets, is equal to 5.31% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture.  This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost of
 Tier 6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed  change
 to  the  Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new entrant rate
 is estimated to increase to 5.55% of pay, an increase of 0.24% of pay.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System.  The most recent data  distributions  and  statistics
 can  be  found  in the System's Annual Report for fiscal year ended June
 30, 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial state-
 ments and can also be found in the  System's  Annual  Report.  Actuarial
 assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation, as it relates to the New York City
 Retirement Systems and Pension Funds (NYCRS), would increase  the  Final
 Average Salary used to calculate pension benefits for certain Tier 3 and
 Tier  6 members of NYCRS by reducing the number of years included in the
 average from five years to three years.

  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS: Currently, Final Average Salary (FAS) is
 based on a five-year average, with each year's salary limited to 110% of
 the average of the prior four year's salaries for the following groups:
  * Tier 3 and Tier 6 members who joined NYCRS  on  or  after  April  1,
 2012, and
  *  Tier 3 enhanced members of POLICE and FIRE who retire for disabili-
 ty.
  Under the proposed legislation, the FAS  for  such  members  would  be
 based  on  a three-year average, with each year's salary limited to 110%
 of the average of the prior two year's salaries (prior four year's sala-
 ries for NYCERS and BERS).
  The five-year FAS for enhanced disability benefits for Corrections and
 Sanitation members of NYCERS is provided as part of an  agreement  under
 Retirement  and  Social Security Law Article 25 and is assumed to remain
 unchanged by this proposed legislation.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

  PART SS
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that a historic
 windmill is located on the Southampton campus of the state university of
 New York at Stony Brook ("Stony Brook").
  The  Windmill  was  constructed  in  1714  and has been at its current
 location in  Shinnecock  Hills  since  1888,  when  it  was  saved  from
 destruction  from  its  location  in the Village of Southampton by Janet
 Hoyt, the wife of William Hoyt, the builder of the Shinnecock Inn. Janet
 Hoyt, together with Samuel Parrish, founded the Summer School of Art. It
 is the only windmill of three in Southampton Village that  survived.  It
 has been in its current location for 136 years.
  In  the summer of 1957, Tennessee Williams resided there when he wrote
 the play "The Day on Which a Man Dies" about the  death  of  his  friend
 Jackson  Pollock.  The  Library Association of America officially desig-
 nated the Windmill, at its current location, as a literary  landmark  in
 2013.
  In  1963, when Long Island University established Southampton College,
 the Windmill became the symbol  of  the  new  campus.  The  Windmill  is
 beloved by thousands of former students, faculty, and administrators who
 rightly  associate  it with the very identity of the school. The College
 newspaper was aptly named "The  Windmill".  The  Windmill  has  been  on
 everything  related to the college including sports uniforms, yearbooks,
 apparel, and assorted memorabilia.
  In 2006, Stony Brook University acquired the campus and has  continued
 the  legacy  of  providing quality education to the residents of eastern
 Long Island. In 2009, Stony Brook led the  effort  to  rehabilitate  the
 Windmill.  The  Windmill  and  the adjacent water view quad have been in
 continuous use hosting innumerable events, readings, receptions,  orien-
 tations,  celebrations,  workshops,  and fundraising dinners. The annual
 Windmill Lighting during the holiday season continues to be an East  End
 tradition.
  The  current  president of Stony Brook University recently stated that
 "the Stony Brook University campus community is proud to be the caretak-
 er of the Windmill, a cherished historical icon that has existed in  its
 current location for over a century".
  However,  in  recent years, the Windmill has fallen into disrepair due
 to lack of maintenance and was condemned by  the  New  York  State  fire
 marshal  in 2023. It is imperative that this historic structure be reha-
 bilitated and restored so that it can  continue  to  be  the  "cherished
 historical icon" and symbol of the Southampton campus.
  The  legislature further finds that the best alternative to secure the
 future of the Windmill is through a partnership with the town of  South-
 ampton  by providing funds for the rehabilitation and restoration of the
 Windmill through the town community  preservation  fund.  To  accomplish
 S. 8306--C  143  A. 8806--C
 
 this  partnership  the legislature further finds that granting the trus-
 tees of the State University of New York ("trustees") the authority  and
 power  to  lease  and otherwise contract with the Town of Southampton to
 make  available  certain  grounds and facilities of Stony Brook's campus
 will best affect this partnership for the benefit of  Stony  Brook,  the
 surrounding community, and the general public.
  §  2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the state univer-
 sity trustees are hereby authorized and empowered,  without  any  public
 bidding,  to  lease and otherwise contract to make available to the town
 of Southampton, a municipal corporation (the "ground lessee"), a portion
 of the lands of the university  on  its  Southampton  campus,  generally
 described  in  this  act for the purpose of rehabilitating and restoring
 the historic Windmill located on such campus.  Such  lease  or  contract
 shall  be  for  a  period not exceeding 100 years without any fee simple
 conveyance and otherwise upon terms and conditions  determined  by  such
 trustees, subject to the approval of the director of the division of the
 budget,  the  attorney  general  and  the state comptroller. If the real
 property that is the subject of such lease or contract shall cease to be
 used for the purpose described in this act, such lease or contract shall
 immediately terminate, and the real property and any improvements there-
 on shall revert to the state  university  of  New  York.  Any  lease  or
 contract  entered  into pursuant to this act shall provide that the real
 property that is the subject of such lease or contract and any  improve-
 ments  thereon  shall  revert to the state university of New York on the
 expiration of such contract or lease.
  § 3. Any contract or lease entered into pursuant to this act shall  be
 deemed to be a state contract for purposes of article 15-A of the execu-
 tive  law, and any contractor, subcontractor, lessee or sublessee enter-
 ing into such contract or lease for the construction, demolition, recon-
 struction, excavation, rehabilitation, repair, renovation, alteration or
 improvement authorized pursuant to this act  shall  be  deemed  a  state
 agency for the purposes of article 15-A of the executive law and subject
 to the provisions of such article.
  §  4.  Notwithstanding  any  general, special or local law or judicial
 decision to the contrary, all work performed on a project authorized  by
 this  act where all or any portion thereof involves a lease or agreement
 for  construction,  demolition,  reconstruction,  excavation,  rehabili-
 tation,  repair,  renovation,  alteration or improvement shall be deemed
 public work and shall be subject to and performed in accordance with the
 provisions of article 8 of the labor law to the same extent and  in  the
 same  manner  as  a  contract  of the state, and compliance with all the
 provisions of article 8 of the  labor  law  shall  be  required  of  any
 lessee, sublessee, contractor or subcontractor on the project, including
 the enforcement of prevailing wage requirements by the fiscal officer as
 defined  in paragraph e of subdivision 5 of section 220 of the labor law
 to the same extent as a contract of the state.
  § 5. Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary,  the
 state  university  of  New  York  shall  not contract out to the town of
 Southampton or any subsidiary for the  instruction  or  any  pedagogical
 functions  or  services,  or  any  administrative  services, and similar
 professional services currently being performed by state employees.  All
 such functions and services shall be performed by state employees pursu-
 ant  to  the  civil service law. Nothing in this act shall result in the
 displacement of any currently employed state worker or the loss of posi-
 tion (including partial displacement such as reduction in the  hours  of
 nonovertime,  wages or employment benefits), or result in the impairment
 S. 8306--C  144  A. 8806--C
 
 of existing contracts  for  services  or  collective  bargaining  rights
 pursuant  to  existing  agreements. All positions currently at the state
 university of New York in the unclassified service of the civil  service
 law shall remain in the unclassified service. No services or work on the
 property  described  in this act currently performed by public employees
 or future work that is similar in scope and nature  to  the  work  being
 currently  performed  by  public  employees  shall  be contracted out or
 privatized by the state university of New York or by an affiliated enti-
 ty or associated entity of the state university of New  York.  All  such
 future work shall be performed by public employees.
  § 6. For the purposes of this act:
  (a)  "project"  shall mean work at the property authorized by this act
 to be leased to the town of Southampton as described in  section  twelve
 of  this  act  that  involves  the design, construction, reconstruction,
 demolition, excavating, rehabilitation, repair,  renovation,  alteration
 or improvement of such property.
  (b)  "project  labor  agreement"  shall  mean  a  pre-hire  collective
 bargaining agreement between a  contractor  and  a  labor  organization,
 establishing  the labor organization as the collective bargaining repre-
 sentative for all persons who will perform  work  on  the  project,  and
 which  provides that only contractors and subcontractors who sign a pre-
 negotiated agreement with the labor  organization  can  perform  project
 work.
  §  7. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special, or local
 law or judicial decision to the contrary: (a) the  town  of  Southampton
 may  require a contractor awarded a contract, subcontract, lease, grant,
 bond, covenant or other agreement for a project to enter into a  project
 labor  agreement during and for the work involved with such project when
 such requirement is part of the ground lessee's  request  for  proposals
 for the project and when the state university of New York at Stony Brook
 determines that the record supporting the decision to enter into such an
 agreement  establishes  that  the  interests  underlying the competitive
 bidding laws are best met by requiring a project labor agreement includ-
 ing obtaining the best work at the  lowest  possible  price;  preventing
 favoritism,  fraud  and corruption; the impact of delay; the possibility
 of cost savings; and any local history of labor unrest.
  (b) If the state university of  New  York  at  Stony  Brook  does  not
 require  a  project labor agreement, then any contractor, subcontractor,
 lease, grant, bond, covenant or other agreements for a project shall  be
 awarded pursuant to section 135 of the state finance law.
  § 8. Nothing in this act shall be deemed to waive or impair any rights
 or benefits of employees of the state university of New York that other-
 wise  would  be  available  to  them pursuant to the terms of agreements
 between the certified representatives of such employees and the state of
 New York pursuant to article 14 of  the  civil  service  law;  all  work
 performed on such property that ordinarily would be performed by employ-
 ees  subject to article 14 of the civil service law shall continue to be
 performed by such employees.
  § 9. Without limiting the determination of the terms and conditions of
 such contracts or leases, such terms  and  conditions  may  provide  for
 leasing,  subleasing,  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,
 improvement, operation and management of and provision of  services  and
 assistance  and  the  granting of licenses, easements and other arrange-
 ments with regard to such grounds and facilities by the  ground  lessee,
 and  parties  contracting with the ground lessee, and in connection with
 such activities, the obtaining of funding or financing,  whether  public
 S. 8306--C  145  A. 8806--C
 
 or private, unsecured or secured, including, but not limited to, secured
 by  leasehold  mortgages  and  assignments  of  rents and leases, by the
 ground lessee and parties contracting with the  ground  lessee  for  the
 purposes of completing the project described in this act.
  §  10.  Such  lease  shall  include an indemnity provision whereby the
 lessee or sublessee promises to indemnify, hold harmless and defend  the
 lessor  against all claims, suits, actions, and liability to all persons
 on the leased premises, including tenant, tenant's agents,  contractors,
 subcontractors,  employees,  customers,  guests, licensees, invitees and
 members of the public, for damage to any such person's property, whether
 real or personal, or for personal injuries arising out of  tenant's  use
 or occupation of the demised premises.
  §  11.  Any  contracts  entered  into pursuant to this act between the
 ground lessee and parties contracting with the ground  lessee  shall  be
 awarded by a competitive process.
  §  12.  The property authorized by this act to be leased to the ground
 lessee is generally described as  that  parcel  of  real  property  with
 improvements  thereon  consisting  of a total of .2296 acres situated on
 the Southampton campus of the state university  of  New  York  at  Stony
 Brook.
 The  description  in  this  section  of  the parcel to be made available
 pursuant to this act is not meant to be  a  legal  description,  but  is

  The  aggregate  principal  amount  of such bonds, notes or other obli-
 gations outstanding shall not exceed  [thirteen  billion,  five  hundred
 million  dollars  ($13,500,000,000)], BEGINNING JULY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND

 law,  as  amended by chapter 931 of the laws of 1984, is amended to read

 of  the public as it may deem necessary, convenient or desirable for the
 use and operation of the  transit  facilities  under  its  jurisdiction,
 including without limitation rules relating to the protection or mainte-
 nance  of  such  facilities,  the  conduct and safety of the public, the
 payment of fares or other lawful charges for the use of such facilities,
 the presentation or display of documentation  permitting  free  passage,
 reduced  fare  passage  or  full fare passage on such facilities and the
 protection of the revenue of the authority.  Violations of  such  rules
 shall  be  an  offense punishable by a fine of not exceeding twenty-five
 dollars or by imprisonment for not longer than ten days, or both, or may
 be punishable by the  imposition  by  the  transit  adjudication  bureau
 established  pursuant to the provisions of this title of a civil penalty
 in an amount for each violation not to exceed one hundred dollars OR, IN
 THE CASE OF CERTAIN REPEAT VIOLATIONS RELATING TO THE PAYMENT  OF  FARES
 IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH SUBDIVISION ELEVEN OF SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED NINE-A
 OF THIS TITLE, NOT TO EXCEED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY  DOLLARS  (IN  EACH  CASE
 exclusive  of  SUPPLEMENTAL PENALTIES, interest or costs assessed there-
 on), in accordance with a schedule of such penalties as may from time to
 time be established by rules of the authority.  Such schedule of  penal-
 ties  may provide for the imposition of [additional] SUPPLEMENTAL penal-
 ties, not to exceed a total of fifty dollars for  each  violation,  upon
 the  failure of a respondent in any proceeding commenced with respect to
 any  such  violation  to  make  timely  response  to  or  appearance  in
 connection  with a notice of violation of such rule or to any subsequent
 notice or order issued by the authority in such proceeding. There  shall
 be  no  penalty  or increment in fine by virtue of a respondent's timely
 exercise of [his] THEIR right to a hearing  or  appeal.  The  rules  may
 provide,  in  addition  to  any other sanctions, for the confiscation of
 tokens, tickets, cards or other fare media that have been forged,  coun-
 terfeit,  improperly  altered  or  transferred,  or  otherwise used in a
 manner inconsistent with such rules. THE AUTHORITY  SHALL  NOT  USE,  OR
 ARRANGE  FOR THE USE, OF BIOMETRIC IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY, TO ENFORCE RULES  RELATING
 TO THE PAYMENT OF FARES.
  §  2.  Subdivisions  2,  3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 of section 1209-a of the
 public authorities law, subdivisions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 as amended  by
 chapter 379 of the laws of 1992, subdivision 3 and paragraphs b and i of

 amended, and three new subdivisions 11, 12 and 13 are added to  read  as
 follows:
  2.  Hearing  officers.  The  president  of the authority shall appoint
 hearing officers who shall preside at hearings for the  adjudication  of
 charges  of  transit OR RAILROAD infractions, as hereinafter defined and
 the adjudication of allegations of liability for violations of the rules
 and regulations of the triborough bridge and tunnel authority in accord-
 ance with section two thousand nine hundred eighty-five of this chapter,
 and who, as provided below, may be designated to serve  on  the  appeals
 board  of  the bureau. Every hearing officer shall have been admitted to
 the practice of law in this state for a period of at least three  years,
 and  shall  be  compensated for [his] THEIR services on a per diem basis
 determined by the bureau.
  3. Jurisdiction. The bureau shall have, with respect to acts or  inci-
 dents  in  or  on the transit OR RAILROAD facilities of the authority OR
 THE  METROPOLITAN  TRANSPORTATION  AUTHORITY  OR  A  SUBSIDIARY  THEREOF
 committed  by or involving persons who are sixteen years of age or over,
 S. 8306--C  148  A. 8806--C
 
 [or with respect to acts or incidents occurring on  omnibuses  owned  or
 operated  by  the  metropolitan transportation authority or a subsidiary
 thereof,] and with respect to violation of toll  collection  regulations
 of  the  triborough  bridge and tunnel authority as described in section
 twenty-nine hundred eighty-five of this chapter, non-exclusive jurisdic-
 tion over violations of: (a) the rules which may from time  to  time  be
 established  by the authority under subdivision five-a of section twelve
 hundred four of this chapter; (b) article one hundred thirty-nine of the
 health code of the city of New York, as it may be amended from  time  to

 this  chapter.  Matters  within  the  jurisdiction  of the bureau except
 violations of the rules and regulations of  the  triborough  bridge  and
 tunnel  authority shall be known for purposes of this section as transit
 OR RAILROAD  infractions,  AS  APPLICABLE.  Nothing  herein  shall  be
 construed  to divest jurisdiction from any court now having jurisdiction
 over any criminal charge or  traffic  infraction  relating  to  any  act
 committed  in  a transit or toll facility, or to impair the ability of a
 police officer to conduct a lawful search of a person in  a  transit  OR
 RAILROAD  facility.  The  criminal  court  of the city of New York shall
 continue to have  jurisdiction  over  any  criminal  charge  or  traffic
 infraction  brought  for  violation  of  the rules of the authority, the
 triborough bridge and tunnel authority or the  metropolitan  transporta-
 tion authority or a subsidiary thereof, as well as jurisdiction relating
 to  any  act which may constitute a crime or an offense under any law of
 the state of New York or any municipality or political subdivision ther-
 eof and which may also constitute a violation of such rules. The  bureau
 shall  have concurrent jurisdiction with the environmental control board
 and the administrative tribunal of the department  of  health  over  the

 OF AN ADDITIONAL VIOLATION, RECORDS OF A WARNING ISSUED TO AN INDIVIDUAL
 IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH A OF SUBDIVISION  ELEVEN  OF  THIS  SECTION
 SHALL  BE SEALED OR EXPUNGED AS OF THE DATE THAT IS FOUR YEARS AFTER THE
 DATE THAT SUCH WARNING WAS ISSUED;

 any decision or order issued by such bureau or of any subpoena issued by

 that  the conduct by hearing officers of hearings and of appeals may not
 be performed by outside  contractors,  AND  THAT  BIOMETRIC  IDENTIFYING

 notices of violation in blank to the transit police and any other person
 empowered  by  law,  rule and regulation to serve such notices. The form
 and wording of the notice of violation shall be prescribed by the execu-
 tive director, and it may be the same as any other notice  of  violation
 or summons form already in use if said form meets the requirements here-
 of. The notice of violation may include provisions to record information
 which  will  facilitate  the identification and location of respondents,
 including but not limited to name, address, telephone numbers,  date  of
 birth,  social  security  number if otherwise permitted by law, place of
 S. 8306--C  150  A. 8806--C

 minor.  Notices  of  violation  shall  be issued only to persons who are
 sixteen years of age or over, and shall  be  served  by  delivering  the
 notice  within  the  state  to  the  person to be served. A copy of each
 notice of violation served hereunder shall be filed and retained by said
 bureau, and shall be deemed a record kept  in  the  ordinary  course  of
 business, and, if sworn to or affirmed, shall be prima facie evidence of
 the  facts  contained  therein.  Said  notice of violation shall contain
 information advising the person charged of the manner and the time with-
 in which such person may either admit or deny the offense charged in the
 notice. Such notice of violation shall also contain a warning to  advise
 the  person  charged  that failure to plead in the manner and within the
 time stated in the notice may result in a  default  decision  and  order
 being  entered  against  such person, and the imposition of supplemental
 penalties as provided in subdivision five-a of  section  twelve  hundred
 four  OR  SUBDIVISION  FOUR  OF SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX of this

 violation  or  to  a  notice of liability issued pursuant to section two
 thousand nine hundred  eighty-five  of  this  chapter  within  the  time
 allowed  by the rules of said bureau or has failed to appear on a desig-
 nated hearing date or a subsequent date following an  adjournment,  such
 failure  to  plead or appear shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be an
 admission of liability and shall be  grounds  for  rendering  a  default
 decision  and  order  imposing  a  penalty  in  such  amount  as  may be
 prescribed by the authority OR THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY
 OR A SUBSIDIARY THEREOF.
  7. Hearings. a. (1) A  person  charged  with  a  transit  OR  RAILROAD
 infraction  returnable to the bureau or a person alleged to be liable in
 accordance with the provisions of  section  two  thousand  nine  hundred
 eighty-five  of  this  chapter  who  contests  such  allegation shall be
 advised of the date on or by which [he or she] SUCH PERSON  must  appear
 to  answer  the  charge at a hearing.  Notification of such hearing date
 shall be given either in the notice of  violation  or  in  a  form,  the
 content  of  which shall be prescribed by the executive director or in a
 manner prescribed in section two thousand nine  hundred  eighty-five  of
 this  chapter.  Any  such notification shall contain a warning to advise
 the person charged that failure to appear on or by the date  designated,
 or any subsequent rescheduled or adjourned date, shall be deemed for all
 purposes,  an admission of liability, and that a default judgment may be
 rendered and penalties may be imposed.  Where notification is given in a
 manner other than in the notice of violation, the bureau  shall  deliver
 such notice to the person charged, either personally or by registered or
 certified mail.
  (2) Whenever a person charged with a transit OR RAILROAD infraction or
 alleged  to  be  liable in accordance with the provisions of section two
 thousand nine hundred eighty-five of  this  chapter  returnable  to  the
 bureau  requests an alternate hearing date and is not then in default as
 defined in subdivision six of this section, the bureau shall advise such
 person personally, or by registered or certified mail, of the  alternate
 hearing  date  on  or  by  which  [he or she] SUCH PERSON must appear to
 answer the charge or allegation at a hearing. The form  and  content  of
 such  notice  of  hearing shall be prescribed by the executive director,
 and shall contain a warning to advise the person charged or  alleged  to
 S. 8306--C  151  A. 8806--C
 
 be liable that failure to appear on or by the alternate designated hear-
 ing  date,  or  any  subsequent  rescheduled or adjourned date, shall be
 deemed for all purposes an admission of liability, and  that  a  default
 judgment may be rendered and penalties may be imposed.
  (3) Whenever a person charged with a transit OR RAILROAD infraction or
 alleged  to  be  liable in accordance with the provisions of section two
 thousand nine hundred eighty-five of  this  chapter  returnable  to  the
 bureau  appears  at  a hearing and obtains an adjournment of the hearing
 pursuant to the rules of the bureau, the bureau shall advise such person
 personally, or by registered or certified mail, of the adjourned date on
 which [he or she] SUCH PERSON must appear to answer the charge or  alle-
 gation  at a continued hearing. The form and content of such notice of a
 continued hearing shall be prescribed by  the  executive  director,  and
 shall  contain  a  warning to advise the person charged or alleged to be
 liable that failure to appear on the adjourned  hearing  date  shall  be
 deemed  for  all  purposes an admission of liability, and that a default
 judgment may be rendered and penalties may be imposed.
  b. Every hearing for the adjudication of a  charge  of  a  transit  OR
 RAILROAD  infraction  or  an  allegation  of liability under section two
 thousand nine hundred eighty-five of this  chapter  hereunder  shall  be
 held  before  a  hearing  officer in accordance with the rules and regu-
 lations promulgated by the bureau.
  c. The hearing officer shall not be bound by the rules of evidence  in
 the conduct of the hearing, except rules relating to privileged communi-
 cations.
  d.  The  hearing  officer may, in [his or her] THEIR discretion, or at
 the request of the person charged or alleged to be liable on  a  showing
 of  good  cause and need therefor, issue subpoenas to compel the appear-
 ance of any person to give testimony, and issue subpoenas duces tecum to
 compel the production for examination or introduction into  evidence  of
 any book, paper or other thing relevant to the charges.
  e.  In  the  case of a refusal to obey a subpoena, the bureau may make
 application to  the  supreme  court  pursuant  to  section  twenty-three
 hundred  eight of the civil practice law and rules, for an order requir-
 ing such appearance, testimony or production of materials.
  f. The bureau shall make and  maintain  a  sound  recording  or  other
 record of every hearing.
  g.  After due consideration of the evidence and arguments, the hearing
 officer shall determine whether the charges  or  allegations  have  been
 established. No charge may be established except upon proof by clear and
 convincing evidence except allegations of civil liability for violations
 of  triborough bridge and tunnel authority rules and regulations will be
 established in accordance with the provisions of  section  two  thousand
 nine  hundred  eighty-five  of  this chapter. Where the charges have not
 been established, an order dismissing the charges or  allegations  shall
 be  entered.  Where  a determination is made that a charge or allegation
 has been established or if an answer admitting the charge or  allegation
 has been received, the hearing officer shall set a penalty in accordance
 with  the penalty schedule established by the authority OR THE METROPOL-
 ITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, or for allegations of
 civil liability in accordance with the provisions of section  two  thou-
 sand  nine  hundred eighty-five of this chapter and an appropriate order
 shall be entered in the records of the bureau. The respondent  shall  be
 given  notice  of  such entry in person or by certified mail. This order
 shall constitute the final determination of the hearing officer, and for
 purposes of review it shall be deemed to  incorporate  any  intermediate
 S. 8306--C  152  A. 8806--C
 
 determinations  made  by  said  officer in the course of the proceeding.
 When no appeal is filed this order shall  be  the  final  order  of  the
 bureau.
  10.  Funds. All penalties collected pursuant to the provisions of this
 section shall be paid to the authority to the credit of a transit  crime
 fund which the authority shall establish. Any sums in this fund shall be
 used  to  pay  for  programs  selected  by the board of the METROPOLITAN
 TRANSPORTATION authority, in its discretion, to reduce the incidence  of
 crimes and infractions on transit AND RAILROAD facilities, or to improve
 the  enforcement of laws against such crimes and infractions. Such funds
 shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any  funds  provided
 by  the state or ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION WITHIN the [city of New York]
 METROPOLITAN COMMUTER TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT AS ESTABLISHED BY  SECTION
 TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO OF THIS ARTICLE for such purposes.

 discount the debt service payments on the refunding or repayment  bonds,
 notes or other obligations from the payment dates thereof to the date of
