 programs as such programs are defined by the commissioner,  subject  for
 the  purposes  of  this paragraph to the approval of the director of the

 programs  operated  by  the  school district and for weighted pupils for
 whom such school district contracts with boards  of  cooperative  educa-
 tional  services to attend career education programs operated by a board
 of cooperative educational services. Weighted pupils for the purposes of
 this paragraph shall mean the sum of THE PRODUCT OF  the  attendance  of
 STUDENTS  IN  GRADE  NINE  MULTIPLIED  BY  THE SPECIAL SERVICES PHASE-IN
 FACTOR, PLUS THE ATTENDANCE OF students in grades ten through twelve  in
 career education sequences in trade, industrial, technical, agricultural

 ratio  shall be computed by subtracting from one the product obtained by
 multiplying fifty-nine percent by the combined wealth  ratio.  This  aid
 A. 8806--B  9
 
 ratio  shall  be  expressed as a decimal carried to three places without
 rounding, but not less than thirty-six percent.
  Any school district that receives aid pursuant to this paragraph shall
 be  required  to use such amount to support career education programs in
 the current year.
  A board of education which spends less than its local funds as defined
 by regulations of the commissioner for career education in the base year
 during the current year shall have its apportionment under this subdivi-
 sion reduced in an amount equal to such deficiency in the current  or  a
 succeeding school year, provided however that the commissioner may waive
 such reduction upon determination that overall expenditures per pupil in
 support  of career education programs were continued at a level equal to
 or greater than the level of such overall expenditures per pupil in  the

 contract,  before  it becomes effective, and the commissioner shall have
 the power to approve, disapprove or require amendments to such  contract
 before it shall become effective.

 for students attending regular education classes in secondary schools of
 the district.  Such  corrective  action  plan  shall  be  submitted  for
 approval  by  the commissioner by a date during the school year in which

 AS  TO  WHICH  SUCH  INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY SHOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE

 VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, OR STALKING.

 EIGHT HUNDRED  TWENTY-NINE  OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW,  SHALL  NOTIFY  ALL
 RESPONDENTS  BY  MAIL  UPON FILING OF A PETITION, NOT LESS THAN FOURTEEN

  1. The tenant continues in possession of any portion of  the  premises
 after the expiration of [his] SUCH TENANT'S term, without the permission
 of  the  landlord  or,  in  a  case  where  a  new lessee is entitled to
 possession, without the permission of the new lessee. Acceptance of rent
 after commencement of the special proceeding upon this ground shall  not
 terminate  such  proceeding  nor  effect  any award of possession to the
 landlord or to the new lessee, as the case may be. A proceeding  seeking
 to  recover  possession of real property by reason of the termination of
 the term fixed in the lease pursuant to a  provision  contained  therein
 giving  the landlord the right to terminate the time fixed for occupancy
 under such agreement if [he deem] SUCH LANDLORD DEEMS the tenant  objec-
 tionable,  shall not be maintainable unless the landlord shall by compe-
 tent evidence establish to the satisfaction of the court that the tenant
 is objectionable.  NO PROCEEDING SHALL BE MAINTAINED  UNLESS  THE  COURT
 HAS  NOTIFIED  AN  INDIVIDUAL OF THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESEN-
 TATION OR LEGAL CONSULTATION, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO  SECTION  EIGHT
 HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  2.  The  tenant  has defaulted in the payment of rent, pursuant to the
 agreement under which the premises are held, and a written demand of the
 rent has been made with at least fourteen days' notice requiring, in the
 alternative, the payment of the rent, or the possession of the premises,
 has been served upon [him] SUCH TENANT as prescribed  in  section  seven
 hundred  thirty-five  of this article. NO PROCEEDING SHALL BE MAINTAINED
 UNLESS THE COURT HAS NOTIFIED AN INDIVIDUAL OF  THE  ABILITY  TO  OBTAIN
 LEGAL  REPRESENTATION  OR LEGAL CONSULTATION, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO
 SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW. Any person succeeding
 to the landlord's interest in the premises may proceed under this subdi-
 vision for rent due [his] THEIR predecessor in  interest  if  [he]  SUCH
 PERSON  has  a right thereto. Where a tenant dies during the term of the
 lease and rent due has not been paid and the apartment is occupied by  a
 person  with a claim to possession, a proceeding may be commenced naming
 the occupants of the apartment seeking a  possessory  judgment  only  as
 against  the estate. Entry of such a judgment shall be without prejudice
 to the possessory claims of the occupants, and any warrant issued  shall
 not be effective as against the occupants.

 RESPONDENT ORALLY OF THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION PURSUANT

 RESPONDENT WOULD LIKE COUNSEL, THE COURT SHALL  ADJOURN  THE  TRIAL  AND
 PROVIDE  SUFFICIENT TIME, NOT LESS THAN FOURTEEN DAYS, FOR SUCH RESPOND-
 ENT TO RETAIN AND CONSULT COUNSEL AND SHALL GRANT SUCH FURTHER  ADJOURN-
 MENTS AS THE COURT DEEMS NECESSARY FOR SUCH COVERED INDIVIDUAL TO OBTAIN
 COUNSEL.
  §  6. Subdivisions 1 and 3 of section 749 of the real property actions
 and proceedings law, as amended by section 19 of part M of chapter 36 of
 the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  1. Upon rendering a final judgment for  petitioner,  the  court  shall
 issue  a warrant directed to the sheriff of the county or to any consta-
 ble or marshal of the city in which the property, or a portion  thereof,
 is  situated,  or,  if it is not situated in a city, to any constable of
 any town in the county, describing the property,  stating  the  earliest
 date  upon which execution may occur pursuant to the order of the court,
 and commanding the officer to remove all persons named in  the  proceed-
 ing,  provided  upon a showing of good cause, the court may issue a stay
 of re-letting or renovation of the premises for a reasonable  period  of
 time.  HOWEVER, NO COURT SHALL ISSUE A JUDGMENT AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE
 OF A WARRANT OF EVICTION AGAINST A  RESPONDENT  WHO  HAS  DEFAULTED,  OR
 AUTHORIZE  THE  EXECUTION OF AN EVICTION PURSUANT TO A DEFAULT JUDGMENT,

 RESPONDENT'S  ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL CONSULTA-
 TION, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT  HUNDRED  THIRTY  OF  THE
 EXECUTIVE LAW IN EVICTION PROCEEDINGS IN THE NOTICE REQUIRED BY SECTIONS
 SEVEN  HUNDRED  ELEVEN, SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-ONE AND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-
 FIVE OF THIS ARTICLE.
  3. Nothing contained herein shall deprive the court of  the  power  to
 stay  or vacate such warrant for good cause shown prior to the execution
 thereof, or to restore the tenant to possession subsequent to  execution
 of  the  warrant.  THE  FAILURE  OF THE COURT TO ADVISE AN INDIVIDUAL OF
 THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL  CONSULTATION,  AS
 APPLICABLE,  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EXECUTIVE
 LAW IN AN EVICTION PROCEEDING SHALL CONSTITUTE GOOD  CAUSE  TO  STAY  OR
 VACATE  SUCH  WARRANT.  In a judgment for non-payment of rent, the court
 shall vacate a warrant upon tender or deposit with the court of the full
 rent due at any time prior  to  its  execution,  unless  the  petitioner
 establishes  that  the tenant withheld the rent due in bad faith.  Peti-
 tioner may recover by action any sum of money which was payable  at  the
 time  when the special proceeding was commenced and the reasonable value
 of the use and occupation to the time when the warrant was  issued,  for
 any period of time with respect to which the agreement does not make any
 provision for payment of rent.
 A. 8806--B  67
 
  § 7. The real property law is amended by adding a new section 235-j to
 read as follows:
  §  235-J.  LEASE  PROVISIONS  WAIVING  RIGHT  TO  COUNSEL  VOID.  ANY
 PROVISION OF A LEASE OR  CONTRACT  WAIVING  OR  OTHERWISE  LIMITING  THE
 TENANT'S  ABILITY  TO  OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL CONSULTATION
 UNDER SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW,  AS  MAY  BE
 APPLICABLE, SHALL BE VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE.
  §  8. Severability clause. If any provision of this act, or any appli-
 cation  of  any  provision  of  this  act,  is held to be invalid, or to
 violate or be inconsistent with any  federal  law  or  regulation,  that
 shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of any other provision of
 this  act,  which can be given effect without that provision or applica-
 tion;  and to that end, the provisions and applications of this act  are
 severable.
  § 9. This act shall take effect January 1,  2025;  provided,  however,
 that  sections  two through seven of this act shall take effect one year
 after such date.

 ment or forbearance under the federal income-driven repayment plan. Upon

 gated by the corporation. A student who is delinquent or in default on a
