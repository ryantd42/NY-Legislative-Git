  COMMENDING  Volunteer  Firefighter  Bernie  Szarek
  upon the occasion of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition  after  55 years of dedicated service to
  Westmoreland Volunteer Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, The firefighters of New York State are renowned  throughout
the  Nation;  their  reputation  is  synonymous  with  excellence in the
arduous field of fire protection and prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  commend  Volunteer
Firefighter Bernie Szarek upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for
special  recognition after 55 years of dedicated service to Westmoreland
Volunteer Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  and  fire  departments  not  only
provide the critical service of fire protection but also engage in other
activities  of  great  benefit  and  importance  to the communities they
serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Bernie  Szarek  is  such a volunteer firefighter; throughout 55 years of
devoted service, this volunteer heroically performed, above  and  beyond
the  call  of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Volunteer  Firefighter  Bernie  Szarek upon the occasion of his
designation for special recognition after 55 years of dedicated  service
to Westmoreland Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Bernie Szarek and Westmoreland Volunteer Fire Department.
