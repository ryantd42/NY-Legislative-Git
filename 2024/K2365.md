  COMMEMORATING the 40th Anniversary of Spiedie Fest
  of Broome County, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor and pay
tribute to those individuals  and  organizations  whose  commitment  and
creative talents contribute to the cultural enrichment and entertainment
of their community and the entire State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 40th Anniversary of Spiedie Fest to be celebrated with a
weekend  full  of family fun, delicious food, and amazing entertainment,
August 2-4, 2024, at Otsiningo Park in Binghamton, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, With its humble beginnings  as  a  small  community  event,
Spiedie Fest, located in the Town of Dickinson, New York, has grown into
a  beloved  tradition  that attracts thousands of visitors each year and
showcases the best Broome County has to offer; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1983, a few families got together and  argued  over  who
had  the  best spiedies recipe; to put an end to their friendly rivalry,
they held the first Spiedie Fest Cooking Contests in  subsequent  years;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  its  inaugural  year,  Spiedie Fest '83 drew more than
11,000 people to Otsiningo Park, where attendees enjoyed such activities
as  the  spiedie  cooking  contest,  a  softball  game,  a  volleyball
exhibition,  and  games  for  children;  the event was designed to raise
money for the American Cancer Society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Just three years after its inception in 1986, Spiedie  Fest
set  a  record  with nearly 70,000 people attending the three-day event;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2001, the festival was  recognized  by  the  Library  of
Congress with a Legacy Award and today a Spiedie Fest display resides in
the  Library  of Congress in Washington, D.C.; in 2005, the festival was
named one of the 100 Destinations in the United  States  by  Destination
Magazine; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  past  three  decades the Spiedie Fest & Balloon
Rally has grown into a full three day event that attracts  over  100,000
people  from  across  the  region,  making  it the third largest hot air
balloon festival in the country; it also features musical  acts,  family
entertainment,  5k  run/walk, volleyball tournament, car show and dozens
of food and merchandise vendors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Spiedie Fest is  a  destination  much  appreciated  by  the
residents of the State of New York and visitors alike; it is a source of
pride  and  community  heritage  to  all  the people of Binghamton; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  40th Anniversary of Spiedie Fest of Broome County, New
York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Spiedie Fest & Balloon Rally Expo, Inc.
