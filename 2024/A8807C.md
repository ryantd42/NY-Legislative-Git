 provide a transparent marketplace, educate consumers and assist individ-
 uals  with  access to coverage, premium assistance tax credits and cost-

 health insurance programs as determined by the commissioner.

  § 4. Section 40 of chapter 266 of the laws of 1986, amending the civil
 practice  law  and  rules  and  other  laws  relating to malpractice and
 professional medical conduct, as amended by section 4 of part F of chap-
 ter 57 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  § 40. The superintendent of financial services shall  establish  rates
 for  policies  providing  coverage  for  physicians and surgeons medical
 malpractice for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June  30,
 [2024] 2025; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
 of  law,  the superintendent shall not establish or approve any increase
 in rates for the period commencing July 1,  2009  and  ending  June  30,
 2010.  The  superintendent shall direct insurers to establish segregated
 accounts for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income  attrib-
 utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
 insurers  regarding  claims and expenses attributable to such periods to
 monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
 and expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall  impose
 a  surcharge  on  premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected deficiency that is
 attributable to the premium levels established pursuant to this  section
 for  such  periods;  provided, however, that such annual surcharge shall
 not exceed eight percent of the established rate until  July  1,  [2024]
 2025, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
 ty-five  percent  of  the  approved  adequate rate, and that such annual
 surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
 to satisfy such deficiency. The superintendent  shall  not  impose  such
 surcharge  during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
 2010. On and after July  1,  1989,  the  surcharge  prescribed  by  this
 section  shall  be  retained by insurers to the extent that they insured
 physicians and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30,  [2024]
 2025  policy  periods;  in  the  event  and to the extent physicians and
 surgeons were insured by another insurer during such periods, all  or  a
 pro  rata  share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall be remitted
 to such other insurer in accordance with rules  and  regulations  to  be
 promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
 and  surgeons  who  were not insured during such policy periods shall be
 apportioned among all insurers in proportion to the premium  written  by
 each  insurer  during such policy periods; if a physician or surgeon was
 insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
 during such policy periods, and  at  any  time  thereafter  a  hospital,
 health  maintenance organization, employer or institution is responsible
 for responding in damages for liability arising out of such  physician's
 or  surgeon's  practice  of medicine, such responsible entity shall also
 remit to such prior insurer the equivalent amount  that  would  then  be
 collected  as  a  surcharge if the physician or surgeon had continued to
 remain insured by such prior insurer. In  the  event  any  insurer  that
 provided  coverage  during  such  policy  periods is in liquidation, the
 property/casualty insurance security fund shall receive the  portion  of
 surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
 The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
 the  purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The superintendent,
 in establishing adequate rates and in determining  any  projected  defi-
 ciency  pursuant  to  the requirements of this section and the insurance
 law, shall give substantial weight, determined  in  his  discretion  and
 A. 8807--B  26
 
 judgment,  to  the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of any regulations
 promulgated and laws enacted and the  public  benefit  of  stabilizing
 malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
 od  of  time  necessary for the development of more reliable statistical
 experience as to the efficacy of such  laws  and  regulations  affecting
 medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
 1986,  by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any provision
 of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
 the superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if  such
 rates  would be adequate when taken together with the maximum authorized
 annual surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time  whether
 or  not  any  such  annual surcharge has been actually imposed as of the
 establishment of such rates.
  § 5. Section 5 and subdivisions (a) and (e) of section 6 of part J  of
 chapter  63  of  the  laws  of 2001, amending chapter 266 of the laws of
 1986, amending the civil practice law and rules and other laws  relating
 to malpractice and professional medical conduct, as amended by section 5
 of  part  F  of  chapter  57 of the laws of 2023, are amended to read as
 follows:
  § 5. The superintendent of financial services and the commissioner  of
 health shall determine, no later than June 15, 2002, June 15, 2003, June
