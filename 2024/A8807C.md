 difference between capital related inpatient expenses  included  in  the
 computation of rates of payment for a prior rate period based on a budg-
 et  and  actual  capital  related inpatient expenses for such prior rate
 period, each as determined in accordance  with  paragraph  (a)  of  this

 to paragraph (i) of subdivision 35  of  section  2807-c  of  the  public
 health law and this section to the total of all payment amounts for such
 eligible  hospitals.  Such  adjustment  payment may be added to rates of

 elimination  of  such plans, which shall coincide with the expiration of
 the moratorium unless the commissioner determines that  a  longer  wind-
 down period is needed.
  (e)  [For  the  duration of the moratorium under paragraph (d) of this
 subdivision] FROM APRIL FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY, UNTIL MARCH  THIRTY-
 FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR, the commissioner shall establish, and
 enforce by means of a premium withholding equal to three percent of  the
 base  rate,  an annual cap on total enrollment (enrollment cap) for each
 managed long term care plan, subject to subparagraphs (ii) and (iii)  of
 this paragraph, based on a percentage of each plan's reported enrollment
 as of October first, two thousand twenty.
  (i)  The  specific  percentage  of each plan's enrollment cap shall be
 established by the commissioner based on: (A) the ability of individuals
 eligible for such plans to access health and long  term  care  services,
 (B)  plan quality of care scores, (C) historical plan disenrollment, (D)
 the projected growth of individuals eligible for such plans in different
 regions of the state, (E) historical plan enrollment  of  patients  with
 varying  levels of need and acuity, and (F) other factors in the commis-
 sioner's discretion to  ensure  compliance  with  federal  requirements,
 appropriate access to plan services, and choice by eligible individuals.
  (ii)  In  the event that a plan exceeds its annual enrollment cap, the
 commissioner is authorized under this  paragraph  to  retain  all  or  a
 portion  of  the  premium withheld based on the amount over which a plan
 exceeds its enrollment cap. Penalties assessed pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion shall be determined by regulation.
  (iii) The commissioner may  not  establish  an  annual  cap  on  total
 enrollment  under  this paragraph for plans' lines of business operating
 under the PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) model  as
 authorized  by  federal public law 105-33, subtitle I of title IV of the
 Balanced Budget Act of 1997, or that serve individuals  dually  eligible
 S. 8307--A  32  A. 8807--A
 
 for  services  and  benefits  under  titles XVIII and XIX of the federal
 social security act in conjunction  with  an  affiliated  Medicare  Dual
 Eligible Special Needs Plan.
  [(f)  In implementing the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this
 subdivision, the commissioner shall, to the extent practicable, consider
 and select methodologies that seek to maximize continuity  of  care  and
 minimize  disruption  to the provider labor workforce, and shall, to the
 extent practicable and consistent with  the  ratios  set  forth  herein,
 continue  to  support contracts between managed long term care plans and
 licensed home care services agencies that are based on a  commitment  to
 quality and value.]

 (a) of subdivision 7 as amended by sections 3 and  4,  respectively,  of
 part  GG  of  chapter  56  of  the laws of 2020,  is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 280. Medicaid drug cap. 1. The legislature hereby finds and declares
 that there is a significant public interest for the Medicaid program  to
 manage  drug costs in a manner that ensures patient access while provid-
 ing financial stability  for  the  state  and  participating  providers.
 Since  two  thousand  eleven,  the  state has taken significant steps to
 contain costs in the Medicaid program by imposing a statutory  limit  on
 annual  growth.  Drug  expenditures,  however, continually outpace other
 cost components causing significant pressure on  the  state,  providers,
 and patient access operating under the Medicaid global cap. It is there-
 fore  intended  that  the department establish a [Medicaid drug cap as a
 separate component within the Medicaid global cap]  SUPPLEMENTAL  REBATE
 PROGRAM  as part of a focused and sustained effort to balance the growth
 of drug expenditures with the growth of total Medicaid expenditures.
  2. The commissioner shall [establish a year to year] REVIEW  AT  LEAST
 ANNUALLY THE department of health state funds Medicaid drug [expenditure
 growth target as follows:
  (a)  for  state fiscal year two thousand seventeen--two thousand eigh-
 teen, be limited to the ten-year rolling average of the  medical  compo-
 nent  of the consumer price index plus five percent and minus a pharmacy
 savings target of fifty-five million dollars; and
  (b) for state fiscal year two thousand  eighteen--two  thousand  nine-
 teen,  be  limited to the ten-year rolling average of the medical compo-
 S. 8307--A  35  A. 8807--A

 nent of the consumer price index plus four percent and minus a  pharmacy
 savings target of eighty-five million dollars;
  (c)  for state fiscal year two thousand nineteen--two thousand twenty,
 be limited to the ten-year rolling average of the medical  component  of
 the  consumer price index plus four percent and minus a pharmacy savings
 target of eighty-five million dollars;
  (d) for state fiscal year two thousand  twenty--two  thousand  twenty-
 one, be limited to the ten-year rolling average of the medical component
 of the consumer price index plus two percent; and
  (e)  for state fiscal year two thousand twenty-one--two thousand twen-
 ty-two and fiscal years thereafter, be limited in accordance with subdi-
 vision one of section ninety-one of part H of chapter fifty-nine of  the
 laws of two thousand eleven, as amended] EXPENDITURES TO IDENTIFY DRUGS,
 INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DRUGS IN THE EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE OR HIGH-
 ER OF TOTAL SPEND, NET OF REBATE OR IN THE EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE OR HIGH-
 ER BASED ON COST PER CLAIM, NET OF REBATE.
  3.  (A) The [department and the division of the budget shall assess on
 a quarterly basis the projected total amount to be expended in the  year
 on a cash basis by the Medicaid program for each drug, and the projected
 annual  amount of state funds Medicaid drug expenditures on a cash basis
 for all drugs, which shall be a component of the projected department of
 health state funds Medicaid  expenditures  calculated  for  purposes  of
 sections  ninety-one  and  ninety-two of part H of chapter fifty-nine of
 the laws of two thousand eleven. For purposes  of  this  section,  state
 funds  Medicaid  drug expenditures include amounts expended for drugs in
 both the Medicaid fee-for-service  program  and  Medicaid  managed  care
 programs,  minus  the  amount  of  any drug rebates or supplemental drug
 rebates received by the department, including rebates pursuant to subdi-
 vision five of this section with respect to rebate targets. The  depart-
 ment  and  the  division  of the budget shall report in December of each
 year, for the prior April  through  October,  to  the  drug  utilization
 review  board  the  projected  state  funds  Medicaid  drug expenditures
 including the amounts, in aggregate thereof,  attributable  to  the  net
 cost  of:  changes  in  the utilization of drugs by Medicaid recipients;
 changes in the number of Medicaid recipients; changes  to  the  cost  of
 brand  name drugs and changes to the cost of generic drugs. The informa-
 tion contained in the report shall not be publicly released in a  manner
 that allows for the identification of an individual drug or manufacturer
 or  that  is likely to compromise the financial competitive, or proprie-
 tary nature of the information.
  (a) In the event the director of the budget determines, based on Medi-
 caid drug expenditures for the previous quarter or other relevant infor-
 mation, that the total department of health state  funds  Medicaid  drug
 expenditure  is projected to exceed the annual growth limitation imposed
 by subdivision two of this section, the] commissioner may  identify  and
 refer  drugs,  INCLUDING  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO,  DRUGS IN THE EIGHTIETH
 PERCENTILE OR HIGHER OF TOTAL SPEND, NET OF REBATE OR IN  THE  EIGHTIETH
 PERCENTILE OR HIGHER BASED ON COST PER CLAIM, NET OF REBATE, to the drug
 utilization  review  board  established  by section three hundred sixty-
 nine-bb of the social services law for a recommendation as to whether  a
 target  supplemental  Medicaid rebate should be paid by the manufacturer
 of the drug to the department and the target amount of the rebate.
  (b) If the department intends to refer a drug to the drug  utilization
 review  board pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the depart-
 ment shall notify the manufacturer of such drug  and  shall  attempt  to
 reach  agreement with the manufacturer on a rebate for the drug prior to
 S. 8307--A  36  A. 8807--A
 
 referring the drug to the drug  utilization  review  board  for  review.
 Such  rebate may be based on evidence-based research, including, but not
 limited to, such research operated or conducted by or  for  other  state
 governments,  the  federal government, the governments of other nations,
 and third party payers or multi-state coalitions, provided however  that
 the department shall account for the effectiveness of the drug in treat-
 ing  the  conditions  for  which  it  is  prescribed  or  in improving a
 patient's health, quality of life, or overall health outcomes,  and  the
 likelihood  that  use of the drug will reduce the need for other medical
 care, including hospitalization.
  (c) In the event that  the  commissioner  and  the  manufacturer  have
 previously  agreed to a supplemental rebate for a drug pursuant to para-
 graph (b) of this subdivision or paragraph (e) of subdivision  seven  of
 section three hundred sixty-seven-a of the social services law, the drug
 shall  not  be  referred  to  the  drug utilization review board for any
 further supplemental rebate for the  duration  of  the  previous  rebate
 agreement,  provided  however,  the commissioner may refer a drug to the
 drug utilization review board if the commissioner determines  there  are
 significant  and  substantiated  utilization  or  market  changes,  new
 evidence-based research, or statutory or federal regulatory changes that
 warrant additional rebates. In such cases, the department  shall  notify
 the  manufacturer  and  provide evidence of the changes or research that
 would warrant additional rebates, and shall attempt to  reach  agreement
 with  the  manufacturer  on a rebate for the drug prior to referring the
 drug to the drug utilization review board for review.
  (d) The department shall consider a drug's actual cost to  the  state,
 including  current rebate amounts, prior to seeking an additional rebate
 pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this subdivision.
  (e)  [The  commissioner  shall  be  authorized  to  take  the  actions
 described  in  this section only so long as total Medicaid drug expendi-
 tures are projected to exceed the annual growth  limitation  imposed  by
 subdivision two of this section.] IF THE COMMISSIONER IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN
 ENTERING  INTO  A  REBATE  ARRANGEMENT WITH THE MANUFACTURER OF THE DRUG
 SATISFACTORY TO THE DEPARTMENT, THE DRUG  MANUFACTURER  SHALL,  IN  THAT
 EVENT  BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO THE DEPARTMENT, ON A STANDARD REPORTING
 FORM DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT, THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:
  (I) THE ACTUAL COST OF DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, PRODUCING (INCLUDING
 THE COST PER DOSE OF PRODUCTION), AND DISTRIBUTING THE DRUG;
  (II) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF THE DRUG, INCLUDING PAYMENTS TO
 PREDECESSOR  ENTITIES  CONDUCTING  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT,  SUCH  AS
 BIOTECHNOLOGY  COMPANIES,  UNIVERSITIES AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS, AND PRIVATE
 RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS;
  (III) ADMINISTRATIVE, MARKETING, AND ADVERTISING COSTS FOR  THE  DRUG,
 APPORTIONED  BY  MARKETING  ACTIVITIES  THAT  ARE DIRECTED TO CONSUMERS,
 MARKETING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE DIRECTED TO  PRESCRIBERS,  AND  THE  TOTAL
 COST  OF  ALL  MARKETING  AND  ADVERTISING THAT IS DIRECTED PRIMARILY TO
 CONSUMERS AND PRESCRIBERS IN NEW YORK,  INCLUDING  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO
 PRESCRIBER DETAILING, COPAYMENT DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, AND DIRECT-TO-CONSUM-
 ER MARKETING;
  (IV) THE EXTENT OF UTILIZATION OF THE DRUG;
  (V)  PRICES  FOR  THE  DRUG THAT ARE CHARGED TO PURCHASERS OUTSIDE THE
 UNITED STATES;
  (VI) PRICES CHARGED TO TYPICAL PURCHASERS IN THE STATE, INCLUDING  BUT
 NOT  LIMITED  TO  PHARMACIES,  PHARMACY CHAINS, PHARMACY WHOLESALERS, OR
 OTHER DIRECT PURCHASERS;
 S. 8307--A  37  A. 8807--A
 
  (VII) THE AVERAGE REBATES AND DISCOUNTS PROVIDED PER PAYER TYPE IN THE
 STATE; AND
  (VIII) THE AVERAGE PROFIT MARGIN OF EACH DRUG OVER THE PRIOR FIVE-YEAR
 PERIOD AND THE PROJECTED PROFIT MARGIN ANTICIPATED FOR SUCH DRUG.
  (F) ALL INFORMATION DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (E) OF THIS SUBDI-
 VISION  SHALL  BE  CONSIDERED CONFIDENTIAL AND SHALL NOT BE DISCLOSED BY
 THE DEPARTMENT IN A FORM THAT  IDENTIFIES  A  SPECIFIC  MANUFACTURER  OR
 PRICES CHARGED FOR DRUGS BY SUCH MANUFACTURER.
  4.  In  determining  whether to recommend a target supplemental rebate
 for a drug, the drug utilization review board shall consider the  actual
 cost  of  the  drug to the Medicaid program, including federal and state
 rebates, and may consider, among other things:
  (a) the drug's impact on the Medicaid drug spending growth target  and
 the  adequacy of capitation rates of participating Medicaid managed care
 plans, and the drug's affordability and value to the  Medicaid  program;
 or
  (b) significant and unjustified increases in the price of the drug; or
  (c) whether the drug may be priced disproportionately to its therapeu-
 tic benefits.
  5. (a) If the drug utilization review board recommends a target rebate
 amount  on  a  drug  referred  by the commissioner, the department shall
 negotiate with the drug's manufacturer for a supplemental rebate  to  be
 paid  by  the manufacturer in an amount not to exceed such target rebate
 amount. [A rebate requirement shall apply beginning with the  first  day
 of  the  state  fiscal year during which the rebate was required without
 regard to the date the department enters into the rebate agreement  with
 the manufacturer.]
  (b) The supplemental rebate required by paragraph (a) of this subdivi-
 sion shall apply to drugs dispensed to enrollees of managed care provid-
 ers  pursuant  to  section  three  hundred  sixty-four-j  of  the social
 services law and to drugs dispensed to Medicaid recipients who  are  not
 enrollees of such providers.
  (c)  [If  the drug utilization review board recommends a target rebate
 amount for a drug and the department is unable  to  negotiate  a  rebate
 from the manufacturer in an amount that is at least seventy-five percent
 of the target rebate amount, the commissioner is authorized to waive the
 provisions  of paragraph (b) of subdivision three of section two hundred
 seventy-three of this article and the provisions of  subdivisions  twen-
 ty-five  and  twenty-five-a of section three hundred sixty-four-j of the
 social services law with respect to  such  drug;  however,  this  waiver
 shall  not be implemented in situations where it would prevent access by
 a Medicaid recipient to a drug which is the only treatment for a partic-
 ular disease or condition. Under no circumstances shall the commissioner
 be authorized to waive such provisions with respect  to  more  than  two
 drugs in a given time.
  (d)]  Where  the  department  and  a  manufacturer enter into a rebate
 agreement pursuant to this section, which may be in addition to existing
 rebate agreements entered into by the manufacturer with respect  to  the
 same  drug,  no  additional  rebates shall be required to be paid by the
 manufacturer to a managed care provider or any of a managed care provid-
 er's agents, including but not limited to any pharmacy benefit  manager,
 while the department is collecting the rebate pursuant to this section.
  [(e)]  (D)  In formulating a recommendation concerning a target rebate
 amount for a drug, the drug utilization review board may consider:
  (i) publicly available information relevant  to  the  pricing  of  the
 drug;
 S. 8307--A  38  A. 8807--A
 
  (ii) information supplied by the department relevant to the pricing of
 the drug;
  (iii)  information  relating to value-based pricing provided, however,
 if the department directly invites any third party to  provide  cost-ef-
 fectiveness analysis or research related to value-based pricing, and the
 department  receives  and considers such analysis or research for use by
 the board, such third party shall disclose any  funding  sources.  The
 department  shall,  if  reasonably possible, make publicly available the
 following documents in its possession that it  relies  upon  to  provide
 cost  effectiveness analyses or research related to value-based pricing:
 (A) descriptions of underlying methodologies; (B) assumptions and  limi-
 tations  of  research findings; and (C) if available, data that presents
 results in a way that reflects different outcomes for affected  subpopu-
 lations;
  (iv)  the  seriousness and prevalence of the disease or condition that
 is treated by the drug;
  (v) the extent of utilization of the drug;
  (vi) the effectiveness of the drug  in  treating  the  conditions  for
 which  it  is prescribed, or in improving a patient's health, quality of
 life, or overall health outcomes;
  (vii) the likelihood that use of the drug will  reduce  the  need  for
 other medical care, including hospitalization;
  (viii) the average wholesale price, wholesale acquisition cost, retail
 price  of  the  drug,  and  the cost of the drug to the Medicaid program
 minus rebates received by the state;
  (ix) in the case  of  generic  drugs,  the  number  of  pharmaceutical
 manufacturers that produce the drug;
  (x) whether there are pharmaceutical equivalents to the drug; and
  (xi)  information supplied by the manufacturer, if any, explaining the
 relationship between the pricing of the drug and the cost of development
 of the drug and/or the therapeutic benefit  of  the  drug,  or  that  is
 otherwise  pertinent  to  the  manufacturer's pricing decision; any such
 information, INCLUDING THE INFORMATION ON THE  STANDARD  REPORTING  FORM
 REQUIREMENT  IN  PARAGRAPH  (E)  OF  SUBDIVISION  THREE OF THIS SECTION,
 provided shall be considered confidential and shall not be disclosed  by
 the  drug  utilization review board in a form that identifies a specific
 manufacturer or prices charged for drugs by such manufacturer.
  6. [(a) If the drug  utilization  review  board  recommends  a  target
 rebate  amount  or  if the commissioner identifies a drug as a high cost
 drug pursuant to subparagraph (vii) of paragraph (e) of subdivision 7 of
 section three hundred sixty-seven-a of the social services law  and  the
 department  is  unsuccessful  in entering into a rebate arrangement with
 the manufacturer of the drug satisfactory to the  department,  the  drug
 manufacturer  shall  in that event be required to provide to the depart-
 ment, on a standard reporting form  developed  by  the  department,  the
 following information:
  (i) the actual cost of developing, manufacturing, producing (including
 the cost per dose of production), and distributing the drug;
  (ii) research and development costs of the drug, including payments to
 predecessor  entities  conducting  research  and  development,  such  as
 biotechnology companies, universities and medical schools,  and  private
 research institutions;
  (iii)  administrative,  marketing, and advertising costs for the drug,
 apportioned by marketing activities  that  are  directed  to  consumers,
 marketing  activities  that  are  directed to prescribers, and the total
 cost of all marketing and advertising  that  is  directed  primarily  to

 consumers  and  prescribers  in  New  York, including but not limited to
 prescriber detailing, copayment discount programs, and direct-to-consum-
 er marketing;
  (iv) the extent of utilization of the drug;
  (v)  prices  for  the  drug that are charged to purchasers outside the
 United States;
  (vi) prices charged to typical purchasers in the state, including  but
 not  limited  to  pharmacies,  pharmacy chains, pharmacy wholesalers, or
 other direct purchasers;
  (vii) the average rebates and discounts provided per payer type in the
 State; and
  (viii) the average profit margin of each drug over the prior five-year
 period and the projected profit margin anticipated for such drug.
  (b) All information disclosed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdi-
 vision shall be considered confidential and shall not  be  disclosed  by
 the  department  in  a  form  that identifies a specific manufacturer or
 prices charged for drugs by such manufacturer.
  7.] (a) [If, after] AFTER taking into account all rebates and  supple-
 mental rebates received by the department, including rebates received to
 date  pursuant  to  this  section[, total Medicaid drug expenditures are
 still projected to exceed the annual growth limitation imposed by subdi-
 vision two of this section], the commissioner may: subject any drug of a
 manufacturer referred to the drug utilization review  board  under  this
 section  to  prior  approval  in  accordance with existing processes and
 procedures when such manufacturer has not entered  into  a  supplemental
 rebate  arrangement  as  required by this section; direct a managed care
 plan to limit or reduce reimbursement for a drug provided by  a  medical
 practitioner  if  the  drug utilization review board recommends a target
 rebate amount for such drug and the manufacturer  has  failed  to  enter
 into  a rebate arrangement required by this section; direct managed care
 plans to remove from their Medicaid formularies any drugs of a  manufac-
 turer who has a drug that the drug utilization review board recommends a
 target rebate amount for and the manufacturer has failed to enter into a
 rebate  arrangement  required  by  this section; promote the use of cost
 effective and  clinically  appropriate  drugs  other  than  those  of  a
 manufacturer  who  has  a  drug  that  the drug utilization review board
 recommends a target rebate amount and the  manufacturer  has  failed  to
 enter into a rebate arrangement required by this section; allow manufac-
 turers  to  accelerate  rebate payments under existing rebate contracts;
 and such other actions as authorized by  law.  [The  commissioner  shall
 provide  written  notice  to the legislature thirty days prior to taking
 action pursuant to this paragraph, unless action  is  necessary  in  the

  §  5.  Paragraph  (e)  of subdivision 7 of section 367-a of the social
 services law, as amended by section 1 of part GG of chapter  56  of  the
 laws  of  2020, the opening paragraph as amended by section 24 of part B
 of chapter 57 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  (e) During the period from April first, two thousand  fifteen  through
 March  thirty-first,  two  thousand twenty-six, the commissioner may, in
 lieu of a managed care provider or pharmacy benefit  manager,  negotiate
 directly and enter into an arrangement with a pharmaceutical manufactur-
 er  for the provision of supplemental rebates relating to pharmaceutical
 utilization by enrollees of managed care providers pursuant  to  section
 three hundred sixty-four-j of this title and may also negotiate directly
 and  enter into such an agreement relating to pharmaceutical utilization
 by medical assistance recipients not so enrolled. Such  rebate  arrange-
 ments shall be limited to the following: antiretrovirals approved by the
 FDA  for  the  treatment  of HIV/AIDS, ACCELERATED APPROVAL DRUGS ESTAB-
 LISHED PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (IX) OF THIS PARAGRAPH,  opioid  depend-
 ence  agents  and  opioid  antagonists  listed  in a statewide formulary
 established pursuant to subparagraph (vii) of this paragraph,  hepatitis
 C agents, high cost drugs as provided for in subparagraph (viii) of this
 paragraph,  gene  therapies as provided for in subparagraph (ix) of this
 paragraph, and any other class or drug designated  by  the  commissioner
 for  which  the  pharmaceutical  manufacturer  has  in  effect  a rebate
 arrangement with the federal secretary  of  health  and  human  services
 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-8, and for which the state has established
 standard  clinical  criteria. No agreement entered into pursuant to this
 paragraph shall have an initial term or be extended beyond  the  expira-
 tion or repeal of this paragraph.
  (i) The manufacturer shall not enter into any rebate arrangements with
 a  managed  care  provider,  or any of a managed care provider's agents,
 including but not limited to any pharmacy benefit manager  on  the  gene
 therapy,  drug, or drug classes subject to this paragraph when the state
 has a rebate arrangement in place and  standard  clinical  criteria  are
 imposed on the managed care provider.
  (ii)  The commissioner shall establish adequate rates of reimbursement
 which shall take into account both the impact of the commissioner  nego-
 tiating  such  arrangements  and  any limitations imposed on the managed
 care provider's ability to establish clinical criteria relating  to  the
 utilization  of  such  drugs.  In developing the managed care provider's
 reimbursement rate,  the  commissioner  shall  identify  the  amount  of
 reimbursement  for  such drugs as a separate and distinct component from
 the reimbursement otherwise made for prescription drugs as prescribed by
 this section.
  (iii) [The commissioner shall submit a report to the temporary  presi-
 dent  of the senate and the speaker of the assembly annually by December
 thirty-first. The report shall analyze the adequacy of rates to  managed
 S. 8307--A  41  A. 8807--A

 care  providers  for drug expenditures related to the classes under this
 paragraph.
  (iv)]  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a phar-
 maceutical manufacturer to enter into a rebate arrangement  satisfactory
 to  the commissioner relating to pharmaceutical utilization by enrollees
 of managed care providers pursuant to section three hundred sixty-four-j
 of this title or  relating  to  pharmaceutical  utilization  by  medical
 assistance recipients not so enrolled.
  [(v)]  (IV)  All  clinical  criteria, including requirements for prior
 approval, and all utilization review determinations established  by  the
 state  as  described in this paragraph for the gene therapies, drugs, or
 drug  classes  subject  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  developed  using
 evidence-based  and peer-reviewed clinical review criteria in accordance
 with article two-A of the public health law, as applicable.
  [(vi)] (V) All prior authorization  and  utilization  review  determi-
 nations  related  to  the coverage of any drug subject to this paragraph
 shall be subject to article forty-nine of the public health law, section
 three hundred sixty-four-j of this title, and article forty-nine of  the
 insurance  law,  as applicable. Nothing in this paragraph shall diminish
 any rights relating to access, prior authorization, or  appeal  relating
 to  any  drug  class  or  drug  afforded  to a recipient under any other
 provision of law.
  [(vii)] (VI) The department shall publish  a  statewide  formulary  of
 opioid  dependence agents and opioid antagonists, which shall include as
 "preferred drugs" all drugs in such classes,  which  shall  include  all
 subclasses  of  a given drug that have a different pharmacological route
 of administration, provided that:
  (A) for all drugs that are included as of the date of the enactment of
 this subparagraph on a formulary of a managed care provider, as  defined
 in  section three hundred sixty-four-j of this title, or in the Medicaid
 fee-for-service preferred drug program pursuant to section  two  hundred
 seventy-two  of  the  public  health law, the cost to the department for
 such drug is equal to or less than the lowest cost paid for the drug  by
 any  managed  care  provider  or by the Medicaid fee-for-service program
 after the application of any rebates, as of the date that the department
 implements the statewide formulary  established  by  this  subparagraph.
 Where  there  is  a generic version of the drug approved by the Food and
 Drug Administration as bioequivalent to a brand name drug pursuant to 21
 U.S.C. § 355(j)(8)(B), the cost to the  department  for  the  brand  and
 generic  versions  shall  be  equal to or less than the lower of the two
 maximum costs determined pursuant to the previous sentence; and
  (B) for all drugs that are not included as of the date of  the  enact-
 ment  of this subparagraph on a formulary of a managed care provider, as
 defined in section three hundred sixty-four-j of this title, or  in  the
 Medicaid  fee-for-service preferred drug program pursuant to section two
 hundred seventy-two of the public health law, the department is able  to
 obtain  the drug at a cost that is equal to or less than the lowest cost
 to the department of other comparable drugs  in  the  class,  after  the
 application of any rebates. Where there is a generic version of the drug
 approved by the Food and Drug Administration as bioequivalent to a brand
 name  drug pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(8)(B), the cost to the depart-
 ment for the brand and generic versions shall be equal to or  less  than
 the  lower  of the two maximum costs determined pursuant to the previous
 sentence.
  [(viii)] (VII) The commissioner  may  identify  and  refer  high  cost
 drugs,  as  defined  in  clause  (D)  of this subparagraph, that are not
 S. 8307--A  42  A. 8807--A
 
 included as of the date of the  enactment  of  this  subparagraph  on  a
 formulary  of a managed care provider or covered by the Medicaid fee for
 service of program to the drug utilization review board  established  by
 section three hundred sixty-nine-bb of this article for a recommendation
 as  to  whether  a target supplemental Medicaid rebate should be paid by
 the manufacturer of the drug to the department and the target amount  of
 the rebate.
  (A)  If the commissioner intends to refer a high cost drug to the drug
 utilization review board pursuant to this subparagraph, the commissioner
 shall notify the manufacturer of such drug and shall  attempt  to  reach
 agreement  with the manufacturer on a rebate arrangement satisfactory to
 the commissioner for the drug prior to referring the drug  to  the  drug
 utilization  review  board  for review. Such arrangement may be based on
 evidence based research, including, but not limited  to,  such  research
 operated  or  conducted  by  or for other state governments, the federal
 government, the governments of other nations, and third party payers  or
 multi-state  coalitions,  provided  however  that  the  department shall
 account for the effectiveness of the drug in treating the conditions for
 which it is prescribed or in improving a patient's  health,  quality  of
 life,  or  overall  health  outcomes, and the likelihood that use of the
 drug will reduce the need for other medical care, including hospitaliza-
 tion.
  (B) In the event that  the  commissioner  and  the  manufacturer  have
 previously  agreed  to  a rebate arrangement for a drug pursuant to this
 paragraph, the drug shall not be referred to the drug utilization review
 board for any further rebate agreement for the duration of the  previous
 rebate agreement, provided however, the commissioner may refer a drug to
 the  drug  utilization review board if the commissioner determines there
 are significant and substantiated utilization  or  market  changes,  new
 evidence-based research, or statutory or federal regulatory changes that
 warrant  additional  rebates. In such cases, the department shall notify
 the manufacturer and provide evidence of the changes  or  research  that
 would  warrant  additional rebates, and shall attempt to reach agreement
 with the manufacturer on a rebate for the drug prior  to  referring  the
 drug to the drug utilization review board for review.
  (C)  If  the  commissioner  is  unsuccessful in entering into a rebate
 arrangement with the  manufacturer  of  the  drug  satisfactory  to  the
 department,  the  drug  manufacturer  shall in that event be required to
 provide to the department, on a standard reporting form developed by the
 department, the information as described in PARAGRAPH (E) OF subdivision
 [six] THREE of section two hundred eighty of the public health law.  All
 information disclosed pursuant to this clause shall be considered confi-
 dential  and  shall  not  be  disclosed by the department in a form that
 identifies a specific manufacturer or prices charged for drugs  by  such
 manufacturer.
  (D)  For  the purposes of this subparagraph, the term "high cost drug"
 shall mean a brand name drug or biologic that  has  a  launch  wholesale
 acquisition  cost  of thirty thousand dollars or more per year or course
 of treatment, or a biosimilar drug that has a launch wholesale  acquisi-
 tion cost that is not at least fifteen percent lower than the referenced
 brand biologic at the time the biosimilar is launched, or a generic drug
 that has a wholesale acquisition cost of one hundred dollars or more for
 a  thirty  day supply or recommended dosage approved for labeling by the
 federal Food and Drug Administration, or a brand name drug  or  biologic
 that has a wholesale acquisition cost increase of three thousand dollars
 S. 8307--A  43  A. 8807--A
 
 or  more in any twelve-month period, or course of treatment if less than
 twelve months.
  [(ix)]  (VIII)  For  purposes of this paragraph, a "gene therapy" is a
 drug (A) approved under section  505  of  the  Federal  Food,  Drug  and
 Cosmetics  Act or licensed under subsection (a) or (k) of section 351 of
 the Public Health Services Act; (B) that treats a rare disease or condi-
 tion, as defined in 21 USC § 360bb(a)(2), that is  life-threatening,  as
 defined in 42 CFR 321.18; (C) is considered a gene therapy by the feder-
 al  Food  and Drug Administration for which a biologics license pursuant
 to 21 CFR 600-680 is held; (D) if administered in  accordance  with  the
 labeling  of such drug, is expected to result in either the cure of such
 disease or condition or a reduction in the symptoms of such  disease  or
 condition  that  materially  improves the patient's length or quality of
 life; and (E) is expected to achieve the result described in clause  (D)
 of this subparagraph after not more than three administrations.
  (IX)  FOR  PURPOSES  OF THIS PARAGRAPH, AN "ACCELERATED APPROVAL" IS A
 DRUG OR LABELED INDICATION OF A DRUG AUTHORIZED  BY  THE  FEDERAL  FOOD,
 DRUG  AND  COSMETIC  ACT  FOR  DRUGS FOR SERIOUS CONDITIONS THAT FILL AN
 UNMET MEDICAL NEED BASED ON WHETHER THE DRUG HAS AN EFFECT ON  A  SURRO-
 GATE  CLINICAL  ENDPOINT,  AND  CONTINGENT UPON VERIFICATION OF CLINICAL
 BENEFIT IN CONFIRMATORY TRIALS.

 persons with a diagnosis of HIV infection, AIDS or  HIV-related  illness
 or  other  diseases  and  conditions;  (iii)  prescription  footwear and

 treatment of venous stasis ulcers; and (v) the commissioner of health is
 authorized  to  implement  an incontinence supply utilization management
 program to reduce costs without limiting  access  through  the  existing
 provider network, including but not limited to single or multiple source
 contracts  or,  a  preferred  incontinence  supply  program  wherein the
 department of  health  will  receive  enhanced  rebates  from  preferred
 manufacturers  of  incontinence  supplies, and may subject non-preferred
 manufacturers' incontinence supplies to prior approval pursuant to regu-
 lations of the department, provided any necessary approvals under feder-
 al law have been obtained to receive federal financial participation  in
 the  costs  of  incontinence supplies provided pursuant to this subpara-
 graph;

 Health Plan Marketplace (Marketplace),  in  conformance  with  Executive
 Order  42  (Cuomo) issued April 12, 2012. The Marketplace shall continue
 to perform eligibility determinations for federal  and  state  insurance
 affordability  programs  including medical assistance in accordance with
 section three hundred sixty-six of the social services law, child health
 plus in accordance with section twenty-five hundred eleven of this chap-
 ter, the basic health program in accordance with section  three  hundred

 ity and affordable health coverage and care, reduce the number of  unin-
 sured  persons, provide a transparent marketplace, educate consumers and
 assist individuals with access to coverage, premium assistance tax cred-
 its and cost-sharing reductions. In addition, the  legislature  declares

 such other health insurance programs as determined by the commissioner.

 plus, the basic health program, THE 1332 STATE INNOVATION PROGRAM, post-
 partum extended coverage and any other health insurance subsidy  program
 designated as such by the commissioner.

 care act (P.L. 111-148) and subdivision  25  of  section  268-c  of  the
 public  health  law;  and  provided,  further,  that the commissioner of
 health shall notify the legislative bill drafting  commission  upon  the
 S. 8307--A  49  A. 8807--A
 
 occurrence  of  the enactment of the legislation provided for in section

  § 4. Section 40 of chapter 266 of the laws of 1986, amending the civil
 practice  law  and  rules  and  other  laws  relating to malpractice and
 professional medical conduct, as amended by section 4 of part F of chap-
 ter 57 of the laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  § 40. The superintendent of financial services shall  establish  rates
 for  policies  providing  coverage  for  physicians and surgeons medical
 malpractice for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June  30,
 [2024] 2025; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
 of  law,  the superintendent shall not establish or approve any increase
 in rates for the period commencing July 1,  2009  and  ending  June  30,
 2010.  The  superintendent shall direct insurers to establish segregated
 accounts for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income  attrib-
 utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
 insurers  regarding  claims and expenses attributable to such periods to
 monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
 and expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall  impose
 a  surcharge  on  premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected deficiency that is
 S. 8307--A  58  A. 8807--A
 
 attributable to the premium levels established pursuant to this  section
 for  such  periods;  provided, however, that such annual surcharge shall
 not exceed eight percent of the established rate until  July  1,  [2024]
 2025, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
 ty-five  percent  of  the  approved  adequate rate, and that such annual
 surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
 to satisfy such deficiency. The superintendent  shall  not  impose  such
 surcharge  during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
 2010. On and after July  1,  1989,  the  surcharge  prescribed  by  this
 section  shall  be  retained by insurers to the extent that they insured
 physicians and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30,  [2024]
 2025  policy  periods;  in  the  event  and to the extent physicians and
 surgeons were insured by another insurer during such periods, all  or  a
 pro  rata  share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall be remitted
 to such other insurer in accordance with rules  and  regulations  to  be
 promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
 and  surgeons  who  were not insured during such policy periods shall be
 apportioned among all insurers in proportion to the premium  written  by
 each  insurer  during such policy periods; if a physician or surgeon was
 insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
 during such policy periods, and  at  any  time  thereafter  a  hospital,
 health  maintenance organization, employer or institution is responsible
 for responding in damages for liability arising out of such  physician's
 or  surgeon's  practice  of medicine, such responsible entity shall also
 remit to such prior insurer the equivalent amount  that  would  then  be
 collected  as  a  surcharge if the physician or surgeon had continued to
 remain insured by such prior insurer. In  the  event  any  insurer  that
 provided  coverage  during  such  policy  periods is in liquidation, the
 property/casualty insurance security fund shall receive the  portion  of
 surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
 The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
 the  purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The superintendent,
 in establishing adequate rates and in determining  any  projected  defi-
 ciency  pursuant  to  the requirements of this section and the insurance
 law, shall give substantial weight, determined  in  his  discretion  and
 judgment,  to  the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of any regulations
 promulgated and laws enacted and the  public  benefit  of  stabilizing
 malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
 od  of  time  necessary for the development of more reliable statistical
 experience as to the efficacy of such  laws  and  regulations  affecting
 medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
 1986,  by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any provision
 of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
 the superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if  such
 rates  would be adequate when taken together with the maximum authorized
 annual surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time  whether
 or  not  any  such  annual surcharge has been actually imposed as of the
 establishment of such rates.

 S. 8307--A  66  A. 8807--A

 from the regional pools established pursuant to subdivision two of  this
 section  to  be  allocated  regionally  with two-thirds of the available
 funding going to New York city and one-third of  the  available  funding
 going  to  the rest of the state and shall be available for distribution
 as follows:
  Distributions shall first be made to consortia  and  teaching  general
 hospitals  for the empire clinical research investigator program (ECRIP)
 to help secure federal funding for biomedical research,  train  clinical
 researchers,  recruit national leaders as faculty to act as mentors, and
 train residents and fellows  in  biomedical  research  skills  based  on
 hospital-specific  data  submitted  to the commissioner by consortia and
 teaching general hospitals in accordance with clause (G) of this subpar-
 agraph. Such distributions shall be made in accordance with the  follow-
 ing methodology:
  (A)  The  greatest  number  of clinical research positions for which a
 consortium or teaching general hospital may be funded pursuant  to  this
 subparagraph  shall  be  one  percent  of  the total number of residents
 training at the consortium or teaching general hospital on  July  first,
 two  thousand  eight  for  the  period  January first, two thousand nine
 through December thirty-first, two thousand nine rounded up to the near-
 est one position.
  (B) Distributions made to a consortium or  teaching  general  hospital
 shall  equal  the product of the total number of clinical research posi-
 tions submitted  by  a  consortium  or  teaching  general  hospital  and
 accepted  by the commissioner as meeting the criteria set forth in para-
 graph (b) of subdivision one of this section, subject to  the  reduction
 calculation  set  forth  in  clause  (C) of this subparagraph, times one
 hundred ten thousand dollars.
  (C) If the dollar amount for the total  number  of  clinical  research
 positions  in  the  region  calculated  pursuant  to  clause (B) of this
 subparagraph exceeds the total amount appropriated for purposes of  this
 paragraph,  including clinical research positions that continue from and
 were funded in prior distribution periods, the commissioner shall elimi-
 nate one-half of the  clinical  research  positions  submitted  by  each
 consortium  or teaching general hospital rounded down to the nearest one
 position. Such reduction shall be repeated until the dollar  amount  for
 the  total  number of clinical research positions in the region does not
 exceed the total amount appropriated for purposes of this paragraph.  If
 the  repeated  reduction  of the total number of clinical research posi-
 tions in the region by one-half does not render a total  funding  amount
 that  is equal to or less than the total amount reserved for that region
 within the appropriation, the funding for each clinical  research  posi-
 tion  in  that  region  shall  be reduced proportionally in one thousand
 dollar increments until the total dollar amount for the total number  of
 clinical  research  positions  in  that region does not exceed the total
 amount reserved for that region within the appropriation. Any  reduction
 in  funding will be effective for the duration of the award. No clinical
 research positions that continue from and were funded in prior  distrib-
 ution periods shall be eliminated or reduced by such methodology.
  (D)  Each  consortium  or  teaching general hospital shall receive its
 annual distribution amount in accordance with the following:
  (I) Each consortium or teaching general hospital with a one-year ECRIP
 award  shall  receive  its  annual  distribution  amount  in  full  upon
 completion of the requirements set forth in items (I) and (II) of clause
 (G)  of  this subparagraph. The requirements set forth in items (IV) and

 tium  or teaching general hospital in order for the consortium or teach-
 ing general hospital to be eligible to apply for ECRIP  funding  in  any
 subsequent funding cycle.
  (II)  Each  consortium  or  teaching  general hospital with a two-year
 ECRIP award shall receive its first annual distribution amount  in  full
 upon  completion  of the requirements set forth in items (I) and (II) of
 clause (G) of this subparagraph. Each  consortium  or  teaching  general
 hospital will receive its second annual distribution amount in full upon
 completion  of the requirements set forth in item (III) of clause (G) of
 this subparagraph. The requirements set forth in items (IV) and  (V)  of
 clause  (G)  of this subparagraph must be completed by the consortium or

 al hospital to be eligible to apply for ECRIP funding in any  subsequent
 funding cycle.
  (E)  Each  consortium  or teaching general hospital receiving distrib-
 utions pursuant to this subparagraph shall reserve seventy-five thousand
 dollars to primarily fund salary and fringe  benefits  of  the  clinical
 research  position  with  the remainder going to fund the development of
 faculty who are involved in biomedical research, training  and  clinical
 care.

 TESTING  IS  PERFORMED  UNDER  THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS SHALL BE
 DISCUSSED WITH THE PATIENT, IN LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDABLE  TO  THE  PATIENT

  PART O

  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 2807-k of the public health law is
 amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to read as follows:
 S. 8307--A  76  A. 8807--A
 
  (H) "UNDERINSURED" SHALL MEAN AN INDIVIDUAL WITH OUT OF POCKET MEDICAL
 COSTS  THAT  AMOUNT  TO MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF SUCH INDIVIDUAL'S GROSS
 ANNUAL INCOME FOR THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS.
  §  2.  Subdivision  9-a of section 2807-k of the public health law, as
 added by section 39-a of part A of chapter 57 of the laws  of  2006  and
 paragraph (k) as added by section 43 of part B of chapter 58 of the laws
 of 2008, is amended to read as follows:
  9-a.  (a)  As  a  condition  for  participation  in pool distributions
 authorized pursuant to this section  and  section  twenty-eight  hundred
 seven-w  of  this  article  for  periods on and after January first, two
 thousand nine, general hospitals shall, effective  for  periods  on  and
 after  January  first, two thousand seven, establish financial aid poli-
 cies and procedures, in accordance with the provisions of this  subdivi-
 sion,  for  reducing charges otherwise applicable to low-income individ-
 uals without health insurance OR UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS, or  who  have
 exhausted  their  health  insurance benefits, and who can demonstrate an
 inability to pay full charges, and also, at the  hospital's  discretion,
 for  reducing  or  discounting  the collection of co-pays and deductible
 payments from those individuals who can demonstrate an inability to  pay
 such amounts.
  (b) Such reductions from charges for [uninsured] patients with incomes
 below at least [three] FOUR hundred percent of the federal poverty level
 shall  result  in a charge to such individuals that does not exceed [the
 greater of] the amount that would have been paid for the  same  services
 [by  the  "highest volume payor" for such general hospital as defined in
 subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to
 title XVIII of the  federal  social  security  act  (medicare),  or  for
 services]  provided pursuant to title XIX of the federal social security
 act (medicaid), and provided further that such amounts shall be adjusted
 according to income level as follows:
  (i) For patients with incomes [at or] below at least [one] TWO hundred
 percent of the federal poverty level, the  hospital  shall  [collect  no
 more  than  a  nominal payment amount, consistent with guidelines estab-
 lished by the commissioner] WAIVE ALL CHARGES. NO NOMINAL PAYMENT  SHALL
 BE COLLECTED;
  (ii)  For  patients  with  incomes  between at least [one] TWO hundred
 [one] percent and [one] UP TO  THREE  hundred  [fifty]  percent  of  the
 federal  poverty  level,  the  hospital  shall  collect no more than the
 amount identified after application of a proportional sliding fee sched-
 ule under which patients with lower incomes shall pay the lowest amount.
 Such schedule shall provide that the amount the hospital may collect for
 such patients increases [from the nominal amount described  in  subpara-
 graph  (i)  of  this paragraph] in equal increments as the income of the
 patient increases, up to a  maximum  of  [twenty]  TEN  percent  of  the
 [greater  of the] amount that would have been paid for the same services
 [by the "highest volume payor" for such general hospital, as defined  in
 subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to
 title  XVIII  of  the  federal  social  security  act  (medicare) or for
 services] provided pursuant to title XIX of the federal social  security
 act  (medicaid),  OR  FOR  UNDERINSURED PATIENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF TEN
 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT  THAT  WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  PAID  PURSUANT  TO  SUCH
 PATIENT'S INSURANCE COST SHARING;
  (iii)  For  patients with incomes between at least [one] THREE hundred
 [fifty-one] ONE percent and [two] FOUR hundred [fifty]  percent  of  the
 federal  poverty  level,  the  hospital  shall  collect no more than the
 amount identified after application of a proportional sliding fee sched-
 S. 8307--A  77  A. 8807--A
 
 ule under which patients with lower income shall pay the lowest amounts.
 Such schedule shall provide that the amount the hospital may collect for
 such patients increases from the [twenty] TEN percent  figure  described
 in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph in equal increments as the income
 of  the  patient  increases,  up  to  a  maximum of [the greater] TWENTY
 PERCENT of the amount that would have been paid for  the  same  services
 [by  the "highest volume payor" for such general hospital, as defined in
 subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to
 title XVIII of  the  federal  social  security  act  (medicare)  or  for
 services]  provided pursuant to title XIX of the federal social security
 act (medicaid), OR FOR UNDERINSURED PATIENTS, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF  TWENTY
 PERCENT  OF  THE  AMOUNT  THAT  WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  PAID PURSUANT TO SUCH
 PATIENT'S INSURANCE COST SHARING; [and
  (iv) For patients with incomes between at least two hundred  fifty-one
 percent  and  three  hundred  percent  of the federal poverty level, the
 hospital shall collect no more than the greater of the amount that would
 have been paid for the same services by the "highest volume  payor"  for
 such  general hospital as defined in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph,
 or for services provided pursuant to title XVIII of the  federal  social
 security  act (medicare), or for services provided pursuant to title XIX
 of the federal social security act (medicaid).
  (v) For the purposes of this paragraph, "highest volume  payor"  shall
 mean  the  insurer,  corporation  or organization licensed, organized or
 certified pursuant to article thirty-two, forty-two  or  forty-three  of
 the insurance law or article forty-four of this chapter, or other third-
 party  payor,  which  has  a  contract  or  agreement  to pay claims for
 services provided by the  general  hospital  and  incurred  the  highest
 volume of claims in the previous calendar year.
  (vi)  A  hospital may implement policies and procedures to permit, but
 not require, consideration on a case-by-case basis of exceptions to  the
 requirements  described  in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph
 based upon the existence of significant assets owned by the patient that
 should be taken into account  in  determining  the  appropriate  payment
 amount  for  that  patient's care, provided, however, that such proposed
 policies and procedures  shall  be  subject  to  the  prior  review  and
 approval  of the commissioner and, if approved, shall be included in the
 hospital's financial assistance  policy  established  pursuant  to  this
 section,  and  provided  further  that, if such approval is granted, the
 maximum amount that may be collected shall not exceed the greater of the
 amount that would have been paid for the same services by  the  "highest
 volume  payor"  for such general hospital as defined in subparagraph (v)
 of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to title  XVIII  of
 the  federal  social  security  act (medicare), or for services provided
 pursuant to title XIX of the federal social security act (medicaid).  In
 the  event  that a general hospital reviews a patient's assets in deter-
 mining payment  adjustments  such  policies  and  procedures  shall  not
 consider  as assets a patient's primary residence, assets held in a tax-
 deferred or  comparable  retirement  savings  account,  college  savings
 accounts,  or  cars  used  regularly  by  a  patient or immediate family
 members.
  (vii)] (IV) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed  to  limit  a
 hospital's  ability  to  establish  patient  eligibility  for  payment
 discounts at income levels higher than those specified herein and/or  to
 provide  greater  payment  discounts  for  eligible  patients than those
 required by this paragraph.
 S. 8307--A  78  A. 8807--A
 
  (c) Such policies and procedures shall be  clear,  understandable,  in
 writing and publicly available in summary form and each general hospital
 participating  in the pool shall ensure that every patient is made aware
 of the existence of such policies and procedures and is provided,  in  a
 timely  manner,  with  a  summary  of such policies and procedures [upon
 request]. Any summary provided to patients shall, at a minimum,  include
 specific  information  as to income levels used to determine eligibility
 for assistance, a description of the primary service area of the  hospi-
 tal and the means of applying for assistance. For general hospitals with
 twenty-four  hour  emergency  departments,  such policies and procedures
 shall require the WRITTEN notification of patients during the intake and
 registration process, AND DURING DISCHARGE OF THE PATIENT,  AND  through
 the  conspicuous  posting  of  language-appropriate  information  in the
 general hospital, and  information  on  bills  and  statements  sent  to
 patients,  that financial aid may be available to qualified patients and
 how to obtain further information. For specialty hospitals without twen-
 ty-four hour emergency departments, such notification shall  take  place
 through  written  materials  provided  to patients during the intake and
 registration process prior to the provision of any health care  services
 or procedures, AND DURING DISCHARGE OF THE PATIENT, and through informa-
 tion on bills and statements sent to patients, that financial aid may be
 available  to  qualified patients and how to obtain further information.
 Application materials shall include  a  notice  to  patients  that  upon
 submission  of  a  completed  application,  including any information or
 documentation needed to determine the patient's eligibility pursuant  to
 the  hospital's  financial  assistance policy, the patient may disregard
 any bills until the hospital has rendered a decision on the  application
 in accordance with this paragraph.
  (d) Such policies and procedures shall include clear, objective crite-
 ria  for  determining  a patient's ability to pay and for providing such
 adjustments to payment requirements as are  necessary.  In  addition  to
 adjustment  mechanisms  such  as  sliding fee schedules and discounts to
 fixed standards, such policies and procedures shall also provide for the
 use of installment plans for the  payment  of  outstanding  balances  by
 patients  pursuant to the provisions of the hospital's financial assist-
 ance policy. The monthly payment under such  a  plan  shall  not  exceed
 [ten]  FIVE  percent  of  the  gross  monthly  income  of  the patient[,
 provided, however, that if patient assets are considered  under  such  a
 policy,  then  patient  assets which are not excluded assets pursuant to
 subparagraph (vi) of paragraph (b) of this subdivision may be considered
 in addition to the limit on monthly  payments].  The  rate  of  interest
 charged  to  the patient on the unpaid balance, if any, shall not exceed
 [the rate for a ninety-day security issued by the United States  Depart-
 ment  of  Treasury,  plus  .5]  TWO percent and no plan shall include an
 accelerator or similar clause under which a higher rate of  interest  is
 triggered upon a missed payment. If such policies and procedures include
 a  requirement  of  a deposit prior to non-emergent, medically-necessary
 care, such deposit must be included as part of any financial aid consid-
 eration. Such policies and procedures shall be applied  consistently  to
 all eligible patients.
  (e)  Such  policies  and procedures shall permit patients to apply for
 assistance [within at least ninety days of the date of discharge or date
 of service and provide at least twenty days for  patients  to  submit  a
 completed  application] AT ANY TIME DURING THE COLLECTION PROCESS.  Such
 policies and  procedures  may  require  that  patients  seeking  payment
 adjustments  provide appropriate financial information and documentation
 S. 8307--A  79  A. 8807--A
 
 in support of their application, provided, however, that  such  applica-
 tion  process  shall not be unduly burdensome or complex. General hospi-
 tals shall, upon request, assist patients in  understanding  the  hospi-
 tal's  policies  and procedures and in applying for payment adjustments.
 Application forms  shall  be  printed  in  the  "primary  languages"  of
 patients  served by the general hospital. For the purposes of this para-
 graph, "primary languages" shall include any language that is either (i)
 used to communicate, during at least five percent of patient visits in a
 year, by patients who  cannot  speak,  read,  write  or  understand  the
 English  language  at  the  level of proficiency necessary for effective
 communication with health care providers, or (ii) spoken by  non-English
 speaking  individuals  comprising  more  than one percent of the primary
 hospital service area population, as calculated using demographic infor-
 mation available from the United States Bureau of  the  Census,  supple-
 mented  by  data  from school systems. Decisions regarding such applica-
 tions shall be made  within  thirty  days  of  receipt  of  a  completed
 application.  Such policies and procedures shall require that the hospi-
 tal issue any denial/approval of such application in writing with infor-
 mation on how to appeal the denial and shall  require  the  hospital  to
 establish  an appeals process under which it will evaluate the denial of
 an application. Nothing in this  subdivision  shall  be  interpreted  as
 prohibiting a hospital from making the availability of financial assist-
 ance contingent upon the patient first applying for coverage under title
 XIX  of  the social security act (medicaid) or another insurance program
 if, in the judgment of the hospital, the patient  may  be  eligible  for
 medicaid  or  another  insurance program, and upon the patient's cooper-
 ation in  following  the  hospital's  financial  assistance  application
 requirements,  including  the  provision of information needed to make a
 determination on the patient's application in accordance with the hospi-
 tal's financial assistance policy.
  (f) Such policies and procedures  shall  provide  that  patients  with
 incomes  below [three] FOUR hundred percent of the federal poverty level
 are deemed presumptively eligible  for  payment  adjustments  and  shall
 conform  to the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this subdivi-
 sion, provided, however, that  nothing  in  this  subdivision  shall  be
 interpreted  as precluding hospitals from extending such payment adjust-
 ments to other patients, either generally or on  a  case-by-case  basis.
 Such  policies  and procedures shall provide financial aid for emergency
 hospital services, including emergency transfers pursuant to the federal
 emergency medical treatment and active labor act  (42  USC  1395dd),  to
 patients who reside in New York state and for medically necessary hospi-
 tal  services  for patients who reside in the hospital's primary service
 area as determined according to criteria established by the  commission-
 er.  In  developing  such  criteria, the commissioner shall consult with
 representatives of the hospital industry, health care consumer advocates
 and local public health officials. Such criteria shall be made available
 to the public no less than thirty days prior to the date of  implementa-
 tion and shall, at a minimum:
  (i)  prohibit  a  hospital  from  developing  or  altering its primary
 service area in a manner designed to avoid medically underserved  commu-
 nities or communities with high percentages of uninsured residents;
  (ii)  ensure that every geographic area of the state is included in at
 least one general hospital's  primary  service  area  so  that  eligible
 patients may access care and financial assistance; and
  (iii)  require the hospital to notify the commissioner upon making any
 change to its primary service area, and to include a description of  its
 S. 8307--A  80  A. 8807--A
 
 primary  service  area  in  the  hospital's annual implementation report
 filed pursuant to subdivision  three  of  section  twenty-eight  hundred
 three-l of this article.
  (g)  Nothing  in  this  subdivision shall be interpreted as precluding
 hospitals from extending payment  adjustments  for  medically  necessary
 non-emergency  hospital  services  to patients outside of the hospital's
 primary service area. For patients determined to be eligible for  finan-
 cial  aid  under  the  terms  of a hospital's financial aid policy, such
 policies and procedures shall prohibit any limitations on financial  aid
 for services based on the medical condition of the applicant, other than
 typical  limitations  or  exclusions  based  on medical necessity or the
 clinical or therapeutic benefit of a procedure or treatment.
  (h) SUCH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SHALL PROHIBIT THE DENIAL  OF  ADMIS-
 SION OR DENIAL OF TREATMENT FOR SERVICES THAT ARE REASONABLY ANTICIPATED
 TO  BE  MEDICALLY  NECESSARY  BECAUSE  THE PATIENT HAS AN UNPAID MEDICAL
 BILL. Such policies and  procedures  shall  [not  permit]  PROHIBIT  the
 forced  sale or foreclosure of a patient's primary residence in order to
 collect an outstanding medical bill and shall require  the  hospital  to
 refrain from sending an account to collection if the patient has submit-
 ted  a  completed  application for financial aid, including any required
 supporting documentation, while the hospital  determines  the  patient's
 eligibility  for  such  aid. SUCH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SHALL PROHIBIT
 THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEBT ACCUMULATED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION TO A THIRD
 PARTY, UNLESS THE THIRD PARTY EXPLICITLY PURCHASES SUCH MEDICAL DEBT  IN
 ORDER  TO  RELIEVE THE DEBT OF THE PATIENT. Such policies and procedures
 shall provide for written notification, which shall include notification
 on a patient bill, to a patient not less than thirty days prior  to  the
 referral  of  debts for collection and shall require that the collection
 agency obtain the hospital's written consent prior to commencing a legal
 action. SUCH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  SHALL  PROHIBIT  A  HOSPITAL  FROM
 COMMENCING  A  LEGAL  ACTION  RELATED TO THE RECOVERY OF MEDICAL DEBT OR
 UNPAID BILLS AGAINST PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF
 THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. IN ANY LEGAL ACTION RELATED TO  THE  RECOVERY
 OF  MEDICAL  DEBT  OR  UNPAID  BILLS  BY OR ON BEHALF OF A HOSPITAL, THE
 COMPLAINT SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN AFFIDAVIT BY THE  HOSPITAL'S  CHIEF
 FINANCIAL  OFFICER  STATING  THAT  BASED  UPON THE HOSPITAL'S REASONABLE
 EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE PATIENT'S INCOME,  THE  PATIENT  WHOM  THEY  ARE
 TAKING  LEGAL  ACTION AGAINST DOES NOT HAVE AN INCOME BELOW FOUR HUNDRED
 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. Such policies and procedures shall
 require all general hospital staff who interact with  patients  or  have
 responsibility  for  billing and collections to be trained in such poli-
 cies and procedures, and require the implementation of a  mechanism  for
 the  general  hospital  to measure its compliance with such policies and
 procedures.  Such  policies  and  procedures  shall  require  that  any
 collection  agency  under  contract  with  a  general  hospital  for the
 collection of debts follow the hospital's financial  assistance  policy,
 including  providing  information to patients on how to apply for finan-
 cial assistance where appropriate. Such policies  and  procedures  shall
 prohibit collections from a patient who is determined to be eligible for
 medical  assistance pursuant to title XIX of the federal social security
 act at the time services were rendered and for which  services  medicaid
 payment is available.
  (i) Reports required to be submitted to the department by each general
 hospital  as  a  condition  for  participation  in  the pools, and which
 contain, in accordance with applicable regulations, a certification from
 an independent  certified  public  accountant  or  independent  licensed
 S. 8307--A  81  A. 8807--A
 
 public accountant or an attestation from a senior official of the hospi-
 tal  that the hospital is in compliance with conditions of participation
 in the pools, shall also contain, for reporting  periods  on  and  after
 January first, two thousand seven:
  (i)  a  report  on  hospital costs incurred and uncollected amounts in
 providing services to eligible patients  without  insurance[,  including
 the  amount  of  care provided for a nominal payment amount,] during the
 period covered by the report;
  (ii) hospital costs incurred and uncollected amounts  for  deductibles

 or prescribing for any disease, pain,  injury,  deformity,  or  physical
 condition  of  the  oral and maxillofacial area related to restoring and
 maintaining dental  health.  The  practice  of  dentistry  includes  the
 prescribing  and  fabrication  of  dental prostheses and appliances. The
 practice of dentistry may include  performing  physical  evaluations  in
 conjunction with the provision of dental treatment, INCLUDING THE ADMIN-
 ISTRATION  OF VACCINATIONS AGAINST INFLUENZA, SARS-COV-2, HUMAN PAPILLO-
 MAVIRUS (HPV), AND VACCINATIONS RELATED  TO  A  DECLARED  PUBLIC  HEALTH
 EMERGENCY.  THE  PRACTICE OF DENTISTRY MAY ALSO INCLUDE OFFERING OF HIV,
 HEPATITIS C, AND HEMOGLOBIN A1C SCREENING OR DIAGNOSTIC TESTS.
  § 14. Section 6605-b of the education law, as added by chapter 437  of
 the laws of 2001 and subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 198 of the laws
 of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  § 6605-b.  Dental  hygiene  restricted  local  infiltration  AND BLOCK
 anesthesia/nitrous oxide analgesia certificate.  1. A  dental  hygienist
 shall  not administer or monitor nitrous oxide analgesia or local infil-
 tration OR BLOCK anesthesia in the practice of dental hygiene without  a
 dental  hygiene  restricted  local  infiltration  AND  BLOCK
 anesthesia/nitrous oxide analgesia  certificate  and  except  under  the
 personal  supervision  of  a  dentist and in accordance with regulations
 promulgated by the commissioner. Personal supervision, for  purposes  of
 this  section,  means that the supervising dentist remains in the dental
 office where the local infiltration OR BLOCK anesthesia or nitrous oxide
 analgesia  services  are  being  performed,  personally  authorizes  and
 prescribes  the use of local infiltration OR BLOCK anesthesia or nitrous
 oxide analgesia for the patient and, before dismissal  of  the  patient,
 personally  examines the condition of the patient after the use of local
 infiltration  OR  BLOCK  anesthesia  or  nitrous  oxide  analgesia  is
 completed.  It  is  professional  misconduct  for  a  dentist to fail to
 provide the supervision required by this section, and any dentist  found
 guilty  of  such  misconduct  under the procedures prescribed in section
 sixty-five hundred ten of this title shall be subject to  the  penalties
 prescribed in section sixty-five hundred eleven of this title.
  2.  The  commissioner shall promulgate regulations establishing stand-
 ards and procedures for the issuance of such certificate. Such standards
 shall require completion of an  educational  program  and/or  course  of
 training  or  experience sufficient to ensure that a dental hygienist is
 specifically trained in the administration  and  monitoring  of  nitrous
 oxide analgesia and local infiltration OR BLOCK anesthesia, the possible
 effects  of such use, and in the recognition of and response to possible
 emergency situations.
  3. The fee for a dental  hygiene  restricted  local  infiltration  AND
 BLOCK  anesthesia/nitrous  oxide  analgesia certificate shall be twenty-
 five dollars and shall be paid on a triennial basis upon renewal of such
 certificate. A certificate may be  suspended  or  revoked  in  the  same
 manner as a license to practice dental hygiene.
  §  15.  Subdivision 1 of section 6606 of the education law, as amended
 by chapter 239 of the laws of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
 S. 8307--A  90  A. 8807--A
 
  1. The practice of the profession of dental hygiene is defined as  the
 performance  of  dental services which shall include removing calcareous
 deposits, accretions and stains from the exposed surfaces of  the  teeth
 which  begin  at  the  epithelial attachment and applying topical agents
 indicated for a complete dental prophylaxis, removing cement, placing or
 removing  rubber  dam,  removing sutures, placing matrix band, providing
 patient education, applying topical medication, PLACING  PRE-FIT  ORTHO-
 DONTIC  BANDS, USING LIGHT-CURE COMPOSITE MATERIAL, TAKING CEPHALOMETRIC
 RADIOGRAPHS, TAKING TWO-DIMENSIONAL AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY OF
 DENTITION, ADJUSTING REMOVABLE APPLIANCES INCLUDING NIGHTGUARDS, BLEACH-
 ING TRAYS, RETAINERS  AND  DENTURES,  placing  and  exposing  diagnostic

 anesthetic applications, polishing teeth, taking medical history, chart-
 ing  caries,  taking  impressions  for study casts, placing and removing
 temporary  restorations,  administering  and  monitoring  nitrous  oxide
 analgesia  and administering and monitoring local infiltration AND BLOCK
 anesthesia, subject to certification in accordance with  section  sixty-
 six  hundred five-b of this article, and any other function in the defi-
 nition of the practice of dentistry as may be delegated  by  a  licensed
 dentist  in accordance with regulations promulgated by the commissioner.
 The practice of dental hygiene may be conducted in  the  office  of  any
 licensed  dentist  or  in  any  appropriately  equipped school or public
 institution but must be done either under the supervision of a  licensed
 dentist  or,  in the case of a registered dental hygienist working for a
 hospital as defined in article twenty-eight of the public health  law[,]
 OR  pursuant  to  a collaborative arrangement with a licensed and regis-
 tered dentist [who has a formal relationship  with  the  same  hospital]
 PURSUANT  TO  SECTION  SIXTY-SIX  HUNDRED SEVEN-A OF THIS ARTICLE AND in
 accordance with regulations promulgated by the department  in  consulta-
 tion  with  the  department  of  health. [Such collaborative arrangement
 shall not obviate or supersede any  law  or  regulation  which  requires
 identified  services to be performed under the personal supervision of a
 dentist. When dental hygiene services are provided pursuant to a  colla-
 borative  agreement, such dental hygienist shall instruct individuals to
 visit a licensed dentist for comprehensive examination or treatment.]

 OUT A REFERRAL FORM AND PROVIDE A COPY OF THE FORM TO THE  COLLABORATING
 DENTIST.

 MEDICAL BOARD WHERE THE PATIENT IS LOCATED. STATE  MEDICAL  BOARDS  THAT

 ing,  but  not  limited  to,  recruiting,  hiring  and supervising their

 SECTION, IS an adult who:
  (1)  has obtained an individual unique identifier from the state by or
 before a date determined by the commissioner of health  in  consultation
 with the Medicaid inspector general[,]; and

 ble individual, provided, however, that the program determines that  the

 exceed the aggregate costs for equivalent services provided by a non-re-
 lative personal assistant.

 agreed to be undertaken by the eligible  individual.  This  subdivision,

 failure to exercise reasonable care in properly carrying out its respon-
 sibilities under this program, which shall include monitoring such indi-
 vidual's continuing ability to fulfill those responsibilities documented
 in his or her records. Failure of the individual to carry out his or her
 agreed to responsibilities may be considered in determining  such  indi-
 vidual's continued appropriateness for the program.

 engage in: managing the plan of care including recruiting and  hiring  a
 sufficient  number  of  individuals  who meet the definition of consumer
 directed personal assistant, as such term is defined by the  commission-
 er,  to  provide authorized services that are included on the consumer's
