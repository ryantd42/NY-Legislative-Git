  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 13-19,  2023,  as  Neurodiversity  Celebration
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
conditions that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 13-19, 2023, as
Neurodiversity Celebration Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Neurodiversity includes experiences such as  autism,  ADHD,
dyslexia,  auditory  processing  disorder,  anxiety,  and post-traumatic
stress disorder; and
 
  WHEREAS, One in seven Americans  are  neurodivergent;  in  New  York
State,  it is estimated that more than 29,000 children are on the autism
spectrum and 6% of children have been diagnosed with ADHD; and
 
  WHEREAS, Students  that  are  neurodivergent  may  face  significant
challenges in school and often experience social isolation and bullying;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  estimated  that  85%  of individuals on the autism
spectrum are unemployed; despite stereotypes and struggles  existing  in
many  settings,  neurodivergent  people  offer  unique  talents to their
workplaces, schools, and communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 2018 by  Siena  Castellon,  a  student  with
autism,  dyslexia,  dyspraxia, and ADHD, Neurodiversity Celebration Week
is a worldwide initiative that challenges stereotypes and misconceptions
about autism and learning disabilities; it aims to create inclusive  and
equitable  cultures  that  celebrate  differences  and  empower  all
individuals; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
the  unique  strengths  and potential of neurodivergent people, and more
must be done to increase activity  at  the  local,  State  and  national
levels  to support neurodivergent people as well as their families; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 13-19, 2023, as
Neurodiversity Celebration Week in the State of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
