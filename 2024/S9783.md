 Introduced  by  Sen. HOYLMAN-SIGAL -- (at request of the Office of Court
  Administration) -- read twice and ordered printed, and when printed to
  be committed to the Committee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the surrogate's court  procedure  act,  in  relation  to
  allowing certain methods for service of process
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of section 307 of  the  surrogate's
 court  procedure act, as amended by chapter 355 of the laws of 2000, and
 subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) and paragraph (e) of subdivision 3 as
 amended by chapter 669 of the laws of  2022,  are  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1. Service by personal delivery. Service of the process may be made on
 any person by personal delivery [to him] of a copy of the process either
 within or without the state.
  2.  Service  by  registered  or  certified  mail,  [return  receipt
 requested,]  or  by  special  mail  service[,  upon  non-domiciliaries].
 Service  of  the  process  may  be made by registered or certified mail,
 [return receipt requested,] or by special mail service, [upon  non-domi-
 ciliaries, whether or not they be natural persons] WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE
 STATE.
  3. Service by court order. As an alternative to service under subdivi-
 sions  1 and 2, service may be made in the manner directed by the court;
 but such service, except as provided by  subdivision  6,  shall  not  be
 ordered  upon a domiciliary natural person unless it be shown that, with
 due diligence, service [by personal delivery  within  the  state]  UNDER
 SUBDIVISION  1  OR  2 cannot be effected, or where for good cause shown,
 [personal service within the state] SUCH SERVICE would be impracticable.
 Any proof necessary hereunder may be submitted in  the  petition  or  by
 affidavit.  The  court  may take into account the size of the estate and
 the remoteness of kinship of any person to be cited in  determining  the
 appropriate  due  diligence  necessary to permit alternate service under
 this section. The court may direct service by any one  or  more  of  the
 following methods, which shall not, however, be exclusive:
  (a)  service  by publication, such as is provided by CPLR 316, subject
 to 308 and 309, and to such variations of CPLR  316  as  the  court  may
 provide, except that

  (i) where persons are to be served by publication, publication in only
 1 newspaper shall be required, or
  (ii)  where  a person is alleged to be within a country with which the
 United States of America is at war or a  place  with  which  the  United
 States  of America does not maintain postal communication, the court may
 direct that a copy of the process shall be  mailed  on  behalf  of  such
 person  to the officer who may have been appointed to take possession of
 the property of noncitizen enemies, or
  (iii) where the person to be served is an absentee or  alleged  to  be
 deceased,  the  court  may  direct  that  in  addition  to the foregoing
 requirements, the process be published in a newspaper  published  at  or
 near the place where the absentee was last known to be, or
  (iv)  in  an  adoption  proceeding under article seven of the domestic
 relations law or in a proceeding under  section  three  hundred  eighty-
 four-b  of  the  social  services  law, a single publication in only one
 newspaper shall be sufficient.
  (b) service by [mail, by registered or certified mail with or  without
 return  receipt  requested, or by any manner of special mail service, as
 the court may direct] ELECTRONIC MEANS, AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED BY  CPLR
 2103(F)(2),  BEARING  THE  CAPTION  OF THE MATTER IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF
 SAID TRANSMISSION;
  (c) substituted service such as is provided by CPLR 308 (2)  and  (4),
 within  or  without the state, subject to 308 and 309, and to such vari-
 ations of CPLR 308 as the court may provide;
  (d) service within or without the state, by  personal  delivery  to  a
 person  duly  designated  by respondent to receive process in his OR HER
 behalf, or to a person whose relationship, whatever its  character,  and
 by  blood or otherwise to the respondent, indicates in the circumstances
 the probability that actual notice will reach the latter [through him];
  (e) if the interest of a non-domiciliary noncitizen in the  estate  is
 less than $2,500 or his or her address is unknown or such estate's gross
 assets  are less than $25,000, by delivery of a copy of the process to a
 consular official of the noncitizen's nation.
  § 2. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 308 of the  surrogate's
 court  procedure  act, as amended by chapter 685 of the laws of 1967, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a) The citation shall be served at least the following number of days
 before the return day:
  (i) 10 days if the person is  served  within  the  state  BY  PERSONAL
 DELIVERY;
  (ii)  20  days  if the person is served [without the state but] within
 the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of  Puerto
 Rico  or  the  possessions  or territories of the United States BY OTHER
 THAN PERSONAL DELIVERY; and
  (iii) 30 days in all other cases AND WHERE THE OFFICE OF THE  ATTORNEY
 GENERAL IS A PARTY.
  §  3.  Paragraphs  (a), (e) and (f) of subdivision 2 of section 309 of

 return receipt requested,] upon the mailing thereof;
  (e) publication, on the 28th day after the first publication; [or]
  (f) ELECTRONIC MEANS, UPON TRANSMITTAL OF THE PROCESS TO  THE  RECIPI-
 ENT; OR
  (G) any other means, as the court directs.
