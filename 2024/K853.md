Assembly Resolution No. 853
 
BY: M. of A. DeStefano
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2024, as Library Lover's Month in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of
organizations that benefit the citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2024, as  Library
Lover's  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the
observance of National Library Lover's Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Library Lover's Month is a month-long celebration dedicated
to the people who love whole  buildings  devoted  to  reading,  housing,
organizing,  categorizing, finding, studying and otherwise loving books;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Libraries provide so much more than a place to enjoy  great
novels  or  to  discover amazing adventures and untold stories; they are
places of research, places to learn, places of entertainment,  community
centers and public forums; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  safe  haven  for youth of all ages, libraries provide a
place of entertainment  with  theater  and  hands  on  activities  where
children  are  exposed to music and art and where they often build their
first friendships; and
 
  WHEREAS, Libraries are truly a sanctuary away from  the  hustle  and
bustle  of  everyday life, offering security as well as peace and quiet;
and
 
  WHEREAS, These vital institutions lend not only  books,  but  music,
movies,  computers  and  more;  rotating art displays give local artists
exposure  to  the  community;  larger  libraries  provide  preservation
services,  preserving  some of the most treasured books, periodicals and
documents for future generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 2024, as  Library
Lover's Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
