 OVERPAYMENT  DETERMINATIONS  RETROACTIVELY  TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR
 WAIVERS AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPHS (A), (B) AND (C) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
 THE  DEPARTMENT  MUST COMPLETE ITS REVIEW OF PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED OVER-
 PAYMENTS FOR WAIVER ELIGIBILITY WITHIN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY  DAYS  OF  THE
 EFFECTIVE  DATE OF THIS SECTION. PRIOR TO DENIAL OF A BLANKET WAIVER, AS
 DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPHS (A) AND (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE  DEPARTMENT
 MUST  ASSESS ALL UPB OVERPAYMENTS TO DETERMINE IF CLAIMANTS ARE ELIGIBLE
 FOR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  ASSESS  AND
 APPROVE  ANY  SUBSEQUENT  WAIVERS  NOT  PREVIOUSLY  AUTHORIZED WHICH THE
 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZES STATES TO  IMPLEMENT.  THERE  SHALL  BE  A
 PRESUMPTION THAT CLAIMANTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR UPB WAIVERS ABSENT CLEAR AND
 CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.
  (A)  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  ASSESS  AND  APPROVE BLANKET WAIVERS. THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR A BLANKET
 WAIVER INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN DENIED  WAIVERS.  NOTICE
 OF  A CLAIMANT'S APPROVAL FOR A BLANKET WAIVER MUST BE PROVIDED PURSUANT
 TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF THE DEPART-
 MENT'S DECISION TO APPROVE THE BLANKET WAIVER. TO THE  EXTENT  THAT  THE
 DEPARTMENT  HAS COLLECTED BENEFITS FOR WHICH AN OVERPAYMENT WAS ASSESSED

 LISTED IN THIS SUBDIVISION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE  DATE  OF
 THIS SECTION. UPON APPROVAL OF A CATEGORICAL WAIVER, SUCH APPROVED WAIV-
 ER  SHALL  BE CONSIDERED TO BE A BLANKET WAIVER AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR
 BLANKET WAIVERS AS LISTED IN PARAGRAPH (A)  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  SHALL
 APPLY.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REQUEST APPROVAL FOR THE FOLLOWING CATEGOR-
 ICAL WAIVERS:
  (I)  ALL OVERPAYMENTS ASSESSED AGAINST EDUCATIONAL WORKERS PURSUANT TO
 SUBDIVISIONS TEN AND ELEVEN OF SECTION FIVE HUNDRED NINETY OF THIS TITLE
 DURING CALENDAR YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY;
  (II) ALL OVERPAYMENTS ASSESSED BECAUSE OF ALLEGED INELIGIBILITY DUE TO
 IMMIGRATION STATUS;
  (III) ALL  OVERPAYMENTS  ASSESSED  AGAINST  THE  CLAIMANT  WHERE  THEY
 RECEIVED CORRESPONDENCE, FORMS, OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENTATION IN A LANGUAGE
 THAT  WAS  NOT  THEIR  OWN  OR  IN A MANNER THAT WAS INACCESSIBLE TO THE
 CLAIMANT; OR DUE TO OTHER SIMILAR DIFFICULTIES (E.G., EDUCATION, LITERA-
 CY, AND/OR LANGUAGE BARRIERS)  IN  UNDERSTANDING  WHAT  INFORMATION  THE
 STATE NEEDED FROM THE CLAIMANT TO PROPERLY DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY;
  (IV) ALL OVERPAYMENTS ASSESSED BECAUSE THE CLAIMANT FILED IN THE WRONG
 STATE OR THERE WAS AN INCORRECTLY ADJUDICATED INTERSTATE CLAIM; AND
  (V)  ALL  OVERPAYMENTS ASSESSED AGAINST CLAIMANTS WHERE RECEIPT OF UPB
 WAS WITHOUT FAULT ON THE PART OF THE CLAIMANT.
  (C) IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT APPROVED FOR A BLANKET WAIVER, THE DEPART-
 MENT MUST ASSESS EACH CLAIMANT'S ELIGIBILITY FOR A  WAIVER  INDIVIDUALLY
 AT  THE  TIME THE OVERPAYMENT IS ESTABLISHED. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL WAIVE
 SUCH OVERPAYMENT REPAYMENT IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE PAYMENT OF  SUCH
 UPB  WAS  WITHOUT  FAULT ON THE PART OF SUCH CLAIMANT AND SUCH REPAYMENT
 WOULD BE CONTRARY TO EQUITY  AND  GOOD  CONSCIENCE.  THERE  SHALL  BE  A
 PRESUMPTION  THAT  THE  CLAIMANT  IS  WITHOUT  FAULT  WHERE THE CLAIMANT
 PROVIDED INCORRECT INFORMATION OR  FAILED  TO  PROVIDE  INFORMATION  AND
 DOCUMENTATION IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS:

  (D)  THERE  SHALL  BE A PRESUMPTION THAT THE PAYMENT OF UPB IS WITHOUT
 FAULT IF THE OVERPAYMENT WAS DUE TO DEPARTMENT ERROR OR MISTAKE  OR  THE
 EMPLOYER  PROVIDED  INCORRECT  OR  UNTIMELY  INFORMATION. RECEIPT OF THE
 UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMANT HANDBOOK SHALL NOT CREATE A  PRESUMPTION
 THAT  THE  CLAIMANT WAS ON NOTICE OF ITS CONTENTS AND SUCH RECEIPT SHALL
 NOT BE USED AGAINST THE CLAIMANT ON POINTS OF FACT OR LAW.
  (E) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION IT SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO BE "CONTRA-
