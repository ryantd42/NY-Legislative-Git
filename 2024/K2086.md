  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 23, 2024, as Book and  Copyright  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to celebrate and recognize the scope of
books, a link  between  the  past  and  the  future,  a  bridge  between
generations and across cultures; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim April 23, 2024, as Book
and Copyright Day in the State of New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of World Book and Copyright Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Held each year on April 23, World Book and Copyright Day is
a  celebration  to  promote  the enjoyment of books and reading; the day
also  recognizes  the  three  major  sectors  of  the  book  industry,
publishers, booksellers, and libraries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  theme for this year's World Book and Copyright Day is
"Indigenous Languages," and aims to honor the start of the International
Decade of Indigenous Languages and encourage  linguistic  diversity  and
multilingualism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World Book and Copyright Day was established by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  on
April  23,  1995;  the  date  was chosen to honor the anniversary of the
death of William Shakespeare and Spanish chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la
Vega; and
 
  WHEREAS, UNESCO enacted World Book and Copyright  Day  because  they
considered  books  to  have  been  the  most  powerful  factor  in  the
dissemination of knowledge and the most effective  means  of  preserving
it;  promoting  the  dissemination  of  books  will  not  only  serve to
enlighten all those who have access to them, but also to develop  fuller
collective  awareness of cultural traditions throughout the world and to
inspire behavior based on understanding, tolerance, and dialogue; and
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens may participate in World Book and Copyright Day by
dressing up as  a  literary  character,  supporting  local  booksellers,
hosting a book club, or by simply reading a book; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Acknowledging  the  immense contribution of writers to the
dynamic and diverse cultural scene of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York has the largest book publishing  industry  in  the
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize books
as  vital  vehicles  to access, transmit and promote education, science,
culture and information worldwide; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim April 23, 2024, as Book
and Copyright Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
