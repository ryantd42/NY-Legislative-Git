 Introduced by M. of A. KELLES -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Health
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the public health law, in relation to establishing a
  pilot program in New York state for the establishment and operation of
  certain rural health zones
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Legislative  findings. The legislature finds that collab-
 oration and innovation are needed to address significant gaps in health-
 care in rural areas of the state.  To  provide  rural  populations  with
 better  access  to  healthcare, the Rural Health Zone Pilot Program will
 work to improve the health of the targeted zone populations to standards
 consistent with quality, high levels  of  access  to  care  and  patient
 outcomes  that  reflect  a  patient-centric approach to physical, behav-
 ioral, and social well-being. A review of  current  practices  in  rural
 communities  is  required  to  identify  areas  for improvement to local
 health planning and infrastructure investment to improve access to  care
 and  clinical  outcomes.  This  healthcare  review, coupled with capital
 resources, programmatic support, and economic incentives, will create  a
 healthier  population,  revitalize  the  workforce,  and  create greater
 opportunities for economic development  within  our  rural  communities.
 Ultimately,  the Rural Health Zone Pilot Program will establish an inno-
 vative organizational replacement for a rural health care model that  is
 no longer viable.
  §  2. Article 29-A of the public health law is amended by adding a new
 title 1-B to read as follows:
  TITLE 1-B
