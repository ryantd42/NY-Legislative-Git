  MOURNING  the death of Langston McKinney, Syracuse
  City Court judge, U.S. veteran, advocate, and valued
  member of his community
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  sorrow  and  deep  regret  that  this
Legislative  Body records the passing of Judge Langston McKinney, noting
the significance of his purposeful life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Judge  Langston  McKinney  distinguished  himself  in  his
profession and by his sincere dedication and substantial contribution to
the welfare of his community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Judge Langston McKinney's commitment to excellence, and his
spirit  of  humanity,  carried  over  into  all  fields  of  enterprise,
including charitable and civic endeavors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Langston McKinney was born and raised in Miami, Florida and
attended Howard University graduating in  1965;  here,  he  completed  a
bachelor's  degree  in  chemistry  and was recruited to become the first
Black scientist in the Research  and  Development  Division  at  Carrier
Corporation  in  Syracuse, where he worked until he enlisted in the U.S.
Army and benefitted from the G.I. Bill  to  attend  Syracuse  University
College of Law; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  an inherent desire to help others, Langston McKinney
and a friend founded the Syracuse University Chapter of the Law Students
Civil Rights Research Council (LSCRRC) which ultimately allowed for  him
to  help  voters  in  Albany,  Georgia  fight  voter  suppression via an
internship with the college organization before going on to graduate law
school and work in legal aid, helping residents of a  housing  community
develop a framework for tenant rights and giving legal assistance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Langston  McKinney  worked  at Onondaga Neighborhood Legal
Services and then at the Frank H. Hiscock Legal Aid Society before going
on to partner at his own law firm, Maye, McKinney & Melchor; he was  one
of four Black lawyers in Syracuse at the time, trailblazing the field of
law and undoubtedly inspiring many others in his wake; and
 
  WHEREAS, Appointed to his first term as judge on Syracuse City Court
in  1986,  Judge  Langston  McKinney  brought  a  unique  and  informed
perspective to the bench; he believed that judges bring the summation of
their life experiences, both positive and negative, to their position of
serving as a judge and he used this idea to advocate for fairer and more
equitable ruling practices and considerations over  the  course  of  his
over 24 years of experience in the role before retiring in 2011; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  naming of McKinney Manor, 18 buildings on 10 acres of
land, is a small demonstration of the impact that 24  years  as  a  city
court judge has had on bestowing justice and care on others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Leaving behind an impactful legacy, Judge Langston McKinney
developed the Syracuse Community Treatment Court to provide treatment to
defendant  drug  abusers  facing  nonviolent crimes as an alternative to
 
jail, advocated for more inclusive representation on  city  juries,  and
spent  countless  hours  working outside of the courtroom with youth and
neighborhood groups, schools, churches, and nonprofit boards; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Judge  McKinney  is  known  for saying that justice is not
contained to the courtroom, but is a community effort; it is  an  effort
that  is  both long-lasting in the heart of the city and in the heart of
its residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to  reflect  upon
those outstanding individuals who have made everlasting contributions on
behalf  of their fellow citizens, and have truly left their mark on this
great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Armed with a humanistic spirit,  imbued  with  a  sense  of
compassion,  and  comforted  by a loving family, Judge Langston McKinney
leaves behind a legacy which will long endure the passage  of  time  and
will remain as a comforting memory to all he served and befriended; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
mourn the death of Judge Langston McKinney, Syracuse City  Court  judge,
U.S.  veteran, advocate, and valued member of his community; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of Judge Langston McKinney.
