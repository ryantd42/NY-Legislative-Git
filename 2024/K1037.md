Assembly Resolution No. 1037
 
BY: M. of A. Gunther
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 22, 2024, as  Veterans  Suicide  Awareness
  and Remembrance Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days and months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of
serious  mental  health  issues that affect the lives of citizens of New
York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  22,  2024,  as
Veterans Suicide Awareness and Remembrance Day in the State of New York,
in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of  September  2024, as National
Suicide Prevention Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established to recognize  the  life  and  death  of  Senior
Airman  Robert  McRae  Dean and every veteran and active military member
who has died by suicide, Veterans Suicide Awareness Day is also meant to
elevate the issue in the public consciousness and to focus on prevention
efforts; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  United  States  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  has
previously  reported  that  an  average  of  22  veterans per day commit
suicide; and
 
  WHEREAS, The rate of suicide among veterans  was  1.4  times  higher
among  male  veterans  and  1.8  times higher among female veterans when
compared to the general adult population; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2016 alone, 153 veterans in  New  York  State  committed
suicide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  urges all New Yorkers to remember
that many of the wounds of war are unseen and persist long after the end
of a veteran's military service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Veteran Suicide Awareness and Remembrance  Day  honors  the
fallen  and  their  families by bringing awareness to this serious issue
and commemorating their service to their State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Veteran suicide must be talked about in order to remove the
stigma surrounding it; by normalizing  an  otherwise  taboo  subject  of
mental  health  among  veterans and active military, they will hopefully
seek out the care they need without fear of judgment, thereby leading to
a reduction of suicides; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
mental  health  condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  September  22,  2024,  as  Veterans  Suicide  Awareness and
 
Remembrance Day, in conjunction with the observance of  September  2024,
as National Suicide Prevention Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and the New York State Division of Veterans' Services.
