 Introduced  by  Sen.  RIVERA -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law,  the  social  services  law,  the
  elder  law  and  the mental hygiene law, in relation to long term care
  options; and to repeal certain provisions of  the  public  health  law
  relating to managed long term care
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent.  The state, as part  of  an  ambitious
 effort  to  move  all  Medicaid recipients to some form of managed care,
 moved those in need of home and community-based long term care  services
 for  over  a  one  hundred twenty day period into managed long term care
 plans on a mandatory basis over ten years ago. The  original  intent  of
 the MLTC program was that the managed long term care plans would develop
 into fully capitated plans over time. This has not happened.
  Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to repeal the partially
 capitated  managed long term care program and instead, provide appropri-
 ate home and community-based long term care benefits  under  a  fee-for-
 service  arrangement.  Fully capitated programs such as the PACE program
 shall continue to be an option. This transition shall not be implemented
 until the commissioner of health is satisfied  that  all  necessary  and
 appropriate transition planning has occurred, and federal approvals have
 been obtained.
  §  2.  Section  4403-f  of the public health law is REPEALED and a new
 section 4403-f is added to read as follows:
  § 4403-F. LONG TERM CARE OPTIONS. 1.  THE FOLLOWING WORDS OR  PHRASES,
 AS USED IN THIS SECTION, SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A)  "PROGRAM  OF ALL-INCLUSIVE CARE OF THE ELDERLY" OR "PACE" MEANS A
 FULLY CAPITATED FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED MODEL  OF  COMPREHENSIVE  CARE  FOR
 PERSONS  FIFTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID
 AND MAY ALSO BE ELIGIBLE  FOR  MEDICARE,  QUALIFYING  FOR  NURSING  HOME
