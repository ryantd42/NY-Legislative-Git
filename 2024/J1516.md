BY: Senator PERSAUD
 
  RECOGNIZING February 1, 2024, as World Hijab Day
 
  WHEREAS,  The people of the United States and the great State of New
York who come from a  variety  of  backgrounds  are  united  in  certain
foundational  beliefs  such  as  affirming  the  inherent dignity of all
persons, the right of every person to be treated with respect,  and  the
right of all citizens to practice their religion freely; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to recognize February
1, 2024, as World Hijab Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Hijab, a traditional veil which covers a woman's hair
and chest, has been very important to the history of Islam; it is  meant
to  promote  dignity and respect for women while maintaining modesty and
respect for religious faith; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Hijab Day was started by Nazma  Khan  as  a  day  set
aside  for  women  of  different  cultures, who do not normally wear the
Hijab, to experience  wearing  one  for  the  day;  its  purpose  is  to
encourage  religious tolerance, cultural understanding and international
solidarity; and
 
  WHEREAS, On February 1, 2013, the world celebrated its first  annual
World Hijab Day in recognition of millions of Muslim women who choose to
wear the Hijab and live a life of religious faith; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since its inception, World Hijab Day has participants from
all over the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  combat  prejudice,  leaders  in  the  American  Muslim
community  are  working tirelessly to show that the wearing of the Hijab
is a choice, a freedom, and a blessing, as  well  as  to  educate  their
fellow  citizens  about Islam in ways which are relevant and meaningful;
and
 
  WHEREAS, One of America's greatest strengths as a society  has  been
our  ability  to embrace our different faiths and allow their members to
express themselves freely; in this spirit, World  Hijab  Day  encourages
the  wearing  of  the  Hijab  as  a proud display of religious faith and
communal bonding which will make  us  stronger  as  a  nation  and  more
accepting of others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to honor those
important events which remind us of the rich and diverse heritage of our
great State and Nation while encouraging greater religious tolerance and
understanding in our communities; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
recognize February 1, 2024, as World Hijab Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Nazma Khan, Founder, World Hijab Day.
