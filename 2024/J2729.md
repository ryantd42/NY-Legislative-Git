BY: Senator MANNION
 
  COMMENDING  Crystie  Weigand  upon the occasion of
  her designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Crystie  Weigand  upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation  as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 28th, 2024, at North Rose-Wolcott  Middle  School,
Spanish  teacher Crystie Weigand heard a commotion in the stairwell just
outside her third-floor classroom; she rushed to the scene to  find  her
colleague of 23 years unresponsive on the stairs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having  been an emergency medical technician for 26 years,
Crystie Weigand leapt into action, performing CPR on the  individual  in
need;  with the aid of a few students, the school nurse, Colleen Barron,
was summoned, as well as  an  AED  (Automated  External  Defibrillator),
which was utilized in unison by these heroic staff members; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When the school resource officer was asked to call 911, it
was discovered that a student had already made the  call,  allowing  for
the  prompt  arrival  of  first responders, truly making a difference in
these lifesaving efforts; and
 
  WHEREAS, A truly brave and courageous woman, Crystie Weigand  played
a  vital role in this extraordinary rescue effort, and should be praised
by the people of this great Empire  State  for  her  astute  actions  in
working to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Crystie Weigand, in her spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated her character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of her action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without  thought of danger or reward when others are in need of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Crystie  Weigand  upon  the  occasion  of  her  designation  as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Crystie Weigand.
