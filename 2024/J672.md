BY: Senator MARTINS
 
  COMMENDING  Rob  Cervoni  upon  the  occasion  of
  winning an episode of the Food  Network's  "Chopped"
  television cooking competition series
 
  WHEREAS,  Culinary  competition  enhances  the  moral  and  creative
development of the people of this State, instilling in them the value of
teamwork, imparting a desire for success,  and  developing  a  sense  of
artistic and creative expression; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
dedication  and  commitment  of  those  individuals  who  distinguish
themselves through excellence in culinary competition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Rob Cervoni upon the occasion of winning an episode of the Food
Network's "Chopped" television cooking competition series,  which  aired
Tuesday, March 28, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born in Lake Success and raised in Great Neck, Rob Cervoni,
a young businessman at heart, opened, with the help of family financing,
a  16 Handles frozen-yogurt franchise in the latter village; he operated
it for eight years before leaving to try a new endeavor; and
 
  WHEREAS, With experience and love for  making  pizza  at  home,  Rob
Cervoni decided to pursue it professionally; he wanted to stand out from
other pizza restaurants, leading him to offer something artisanal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having  eaten  Roman-style  pizza  during  summers  in the
second-generation Italian's ancestral town, Boville Ernica, Rob  Cervoni
was  only  later  inspired  to learn to make the Roman-style pizza after
seeing it at an expo in 2016;  the  style  has  only  begun  growing  in
popularity in the United States in recent years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Opening  his  restaurant, Taglio, in 2018, Rob Cervoni and
business partner, Domenico "Mimmo" Tolomeo, began to shift from being  a
regular  slice  shop  that also sold artisanal pizza, to focusing on the
successes of only selling artisanal pizza in  2021;  their  actions  are
helping  to  popularize the relatively rare Roman-style, which resembles
flatbread but is thicker yet simultaneously airier  due  to  its  highly
hydrated dough that is given a long rise of up to 96 hours; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Quickly  following this change, Rob Cervoni quickly became
one of Pizza Today  magazine's  seven  "Rising  Stars  of  the  Pizzeria
Industry" in 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following his astounding growth and successes, Rob Cervoni
was recruited by the show, "Chopped" which airs  on  the  Food  Network;
after  a  series  of  online  interviews,  the pizza chef was invited to
participate on the show, filming his episode in Manhattan in October  of
2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  episode  aired  on  Tuesday,  March  28,  2023,
coincidentally the same date as the  first  night  of  the  39th  Annual
International  Pizza  Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada, where Rob Cervoni would
be showcasing his renowned culinary talents; with his strongest  support
system  joining  him,  he  watched  the  episode  with  his loving wife,
Samantha, and their beloved two-year-old son together; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rob Cervoni, representing his home of  Long  Island,  in  a
high-stakes  battle  against  other renowned pizza chefs, a fast-ticking
clock,  and  the  pressure  of  a  massive  television  audience,  arose
victorious in defeating his opponents in the fight to claim the title of
Chopped Champion, rightly earning the illustrious $10,000 prize; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges the magnificent talent  and  representation  of  excellence
within  New York State that is Rob Cervoni, fully confident that he will
continue to enjoy the sparkling successes he has experienced  thus  far;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Rob Cervoni upon the occasion of winning an episode of the  Food
Network's  "Chopped"  television  cooking  competition series; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Rob Cervoni.
