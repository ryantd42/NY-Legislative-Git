 Introduced  by  Sens.  PARKER, BAILEY, SKOUFIS -- read twice and ordered
  printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee  on  Energy
  and Telecommunications
 
 AN ACT to establish a heightened review of new permits for the operation
  of  certain  electric generation facilities to ensure consistency with
  state public interest standards; and providing for the repeal of  such
  provisions upon the expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. It is the intent of this legislature to
 further the protection of the Hudson  Valley  region  from  the  adverse
 effects of electric generation from fossil fuels in the Town of Wawayan-
 da.  Such  adverse effects include emissions of carbon dioxide, methane,
 and other pollutants that contribute to climate change, noise pollution,
 and damaging impacts on health, agriculture, tourism, viewshed, and  the
 character  of  the  surrounding  community. Orange county is home to the
 "Black Dirt Region," an agriculturally significant region famous for its
 production of onions, among other products, and is also home  to  impor-
 tant recreational and tourist attractions, and ongoing review of facili-
 ty  operations  should take into account whether the electric generating
 facility's operation is in the public interest.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for any permit decisions
 issued after the effective date of this act, the department of  environ-
 mental  conservation  shall  not  issue  any  new permits, or any permit
 renewal for a facility subject to this act that is located in  a  county
 with  a population of not less than three hundred fifty thousand and not
 more than four hundred thousand as determined by the most recent  United
 States  census,  for  the  operation  of an electric generating facility
 powered by natural gas or any other carbon  fuel  unless  such  facility
 demonstrates that it can operate in the public interest by demonstrating
 that  its  operation  (i)  is consistent with and will not substantially

 impede or interfere with the state's ability to  meet  the  targets  and
 goals  in  the  climate  leadership and protection act and (ii) does not
 negatively affect public health or safety, agriculture, viewshed,  noise
 pollution,  tourism  and recreational opportunities, community character
 or environmental justice communities.  The department  of  environmental
 conservation shall issue a written determination on whether the facility
 is  in the public interest only after a public hearing and comment peri-
 od.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed on and after April 1, 2024.
