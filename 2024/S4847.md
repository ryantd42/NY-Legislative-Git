  Section  1. Subdivision 3 of section 222 of the public service law, as
 added by chapter 83 of the laws of 1995, is amended to read as follows:
  3. (A) The commission shall approve the  application  FOR  RENEWAL  OR
 AMENDMENT  OF  A  FRANCHISE  unless  it  finds  that the applicant[, the
 proposed transferee] or the cable television system does not conform  to
 the  standards established in the regulations promulgated by the commis-
 sion pursuant to section two hundred fifteen of  this  article  or  that
 approval  would  be  in  violation  of  law,  any regulation or standard
 promulgated by the commission or the public interest, provided  however,
 that  a  failure  to  conform  to the standards established in the regu-
 lations promulgated by the commission shall not preclude approval of any
 such application if the commission finds that such approval would  serve
 the public interest.
  (B) THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT APPROVE THE APPLICATION FOR A TRANSFER OF
 A  FRANCHISE,  ANY  TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF A FRANCHISE OR CERTIFICATE OF
 CONFIRMATION, OR OF FACILITIES CONSTITUTING A SIGNIFICANT  PART  OF  ANY
 CABLE  TELEVISION  SYSTEM  UNLESS  THE  APPLICANT  DEMONSTRATES THAT THE
 PROPOSED TRANSFEREE AND THE CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEM CONFORM TO THE STAN-
 DARDS ESTABLISHED IN  THE  REGULATIONS  PROMULGATED  BY  THE  COMMISSION
 PURSUANT  TO  SECTION TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE, THAT APPROVAL
 WOULD NOT BE IN VIOLATION OF LAW, OR ANY REGULATION OR STANDARDS PROMUL-
 GATED BY THE COMMISSION, AND THAT  THE  TRANSFER  IS  OTHERWISE  IN  THE
 PUBLIC  INTEREST;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT A FAILURE TO CONFORM TO THE
 STANDARDS ESTABLISHED IN THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY  THE  COMMISSION
