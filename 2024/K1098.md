  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2024, as  Celebrate  Diversity  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the practice of this Legislative Body to recognize
the vast diversity  that  makes  up  our  wonderful  State;  celebrating
diversity  in  our state means embracing all the cultures and traditions
that come from all over the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024,  as  Celebrate
Diversity  Month  in  the State of New York in conjunction with National
Celebrate Diversity Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State continues to be known as  a  leader  in  the
fight  for  inclusion  and  equality;  it  is crucial that we uplift our
minority communities who face discrimination in different ways, to  make
all feel included and welcome in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Diversity  is  inclusive  of  varying  races,  genders,
religions, abilities, and other groups who face  barriers  to  full  and
equal  participation  in  the workforce and our communities; celebrating
diverse groups enriches our lives to understand different  perspectives;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2024,  as  Celebrate
Diversity Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
