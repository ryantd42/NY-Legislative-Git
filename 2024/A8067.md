 PREFERRED  DRUGS  SHALL  ESTABLISH  A  PROCEDURE  BY WHICH IT DETERMINES
 WHETHER A FORMULARY DRUG PROVIDES APPROPRIATE  THERAPEUTIC  BENEFITS  TO
 MEET  THE  PARTICULAR  HEALTH  CARE  NEEDS OF AN INSURED. IF THE INSURER
 DETERMINES THAT NO FORMULARY DRUG PROVIDES APPROPRIATE THERAPEUTIC BENE-
 FITS TO MEET THE PARTICULAR HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF AN INSURED, THE INSURER

 ADDITIONAL  COST  TO THE INSURED BEYOND WHAT THE INSURED WOULD OTHERWISE
 PAY FOR A PREFERRED BRAND NAME DRUG ON THE FORMULARY. THE DETERMINATIONS
 WHETHER A DRUG PROVIDES APPROPRIATE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS AND  WHETHER  A
 NON-FORMULARY DRUG IS NECESSARY TO MEET THE PARTICULAR HEALTH CARE NEEDS
 OF  THE  INSURED  ARE UTILIZATION REVIEW DECISIONS AND ARE REVIEWABLE IN
