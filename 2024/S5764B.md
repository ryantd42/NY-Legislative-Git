 THE USE OF A THIRD-PARTY DATABASE. AN INSURER ALSO SHALL VERIFY, THROUGH
 A THIRD-PARTY DATABASE, THE DRIVING HISTORY OF A NAMED  DRIVER  USED  TO
 RATE THE POLICY WHEN ADDED DURING THE POLICY PERIOD AND SHALL VERIFY THE

 RENEWAL, UNLESS THE DRIVING HISTORY IS UNAVAILABLE AT THE  TIME  OF  THE
 INITIAL  INQUIRY DUE TO A TEMPORARY WEBSITE OUTAGE, SERVICE INTERRUPTION
 OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE  INSURER,  PRODUCER  OR
 THIRD-PARTY REPRESENTATIVE.
