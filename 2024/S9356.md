  2. Duties of the director. (a) The director is authorized and directed
 to promulgate rules and regulations, establishing standards and require-
 ments with regard to the operation of all social adult day care programs
 [receiving funding pursuant to this article] REGARDLESS OF  WHETHER  THE
 PROGRAM RECEIVES FUNDING PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE, OTHER PUBLIC FUNDING,
 OR  PRIVATE  FUNDING.  FOR  A  PROGRAM  SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT BY BOTH THE
 OFFICE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION AND ANOTHER STATE AGENCY, THE RULES  AND
 REGULATIONS  OF THE OTHER STATE AGENCY SHALL TAKE PRECEDENCE IF THERE IS
 DUPLICATION TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED  BY  THE  DIRECTOR.
 THE DIRECTOR SHALL ESTABLISH A METHOD FOR A PROGRAM TO NOTIFY THE OFFICE
 OF  SUCH DUPLICATION. Such standards and requirements shall include, but
 not be limited to:
  (1) services to be provided;
  (2) admission criteria;
  (3) participant cost-sharing;
  (4) assessment and enrollment;
  (5) staffing;
  (6) monitoring and evaluation of programs; and
  (7) any other standards or requirements which the director  determines
 to be appropriate.
  (b) Rules and regulations promulgated by the director pursuant to this
 subdivision shall also direct how social adult day care will be included
 in the planning currently required of designated agencies.
  (c)  The director shall develop materials for employees and volunteers
 of programs providing social adult day services or social adult day care
 on the signs and symptoms of elder abuse, which shall  include  identity
 theft.  Such  materials  shall  include,  but not be limited to, ways to
 discuss suspected elder abuse with seniors where abuse is suspected  and
 resources  to  which seniors may be referred for counseling, shelter, or
 other assistance.
  (D) THE DIRECTOR SHALL INSPECT EACH  SOCIAL  ADULT  DAY  CARE  PROGRAM
 PRIOR  TO  OPERATING  AND  NO  LESS  THAN  ONCE  EVERY  FIVE YEARS. SUCH
 INSPECTION SHALL ENSURE THAT THE  PROGRAM  HAS  MET  THE  STANDARDS  AND
 REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE DIRECTOR, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A
 DETERMINATION  THAT  THE  PROGRAM HAS THE NECESSARY PHYSICAL CAPACITY TO
 PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENROLLED IN SUCH PROGRAM. UPON
 SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF SUCH INSPECTION, THE PROGRAM SHALL BE ISSUED  A
 CERTIFICATE OF INSPECTION BY THE DIRECTOR. IF A PROGRAM IS INSPECTED AND
 DOES  NOT  MEET THE STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE DIREC-
 TOR, SUCH PROGRAM SHALL BE GIVEN NINETY DAYS TO CORRECT ANY DEFICIENCIES
 AS DETERMINED BY THE DIRECTOR.
  (E) BY JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND THIRTY,  AND  ANNUALLY  THEREAFTER,
 THE  DIRECTOR  SHALL  COLLECT  AND MAINTAIN FOR INSPECTION BY DESIGNATED
 AGENCIES THE SELF-CERTIFICATION SUBMITTED BY EACH  PROGRAM  PURSUANT  TO

  3. Funding for social adult day care programs.
  (a)  Beginning  with  amounts  appropriated  in  the two thousand five
 fiscal year, the director shall, within amounts  appropriated  therefor,
 make  grants available on a competitive basis to not-for-profit or local
 government operated social adult  day  care  programs  for  functionally
 impaired  elderly  persons,  with  consideration of regional needs and a
 broad array of models. Such grants shall equal seventy-five  percent  of
 allowable  expenditures  for approved services pursuant to this section;
 provided however that the director may  accept  certain  in-kind  equiv-
 alents  to comprise the required twenty-five percent match; and provided
 further, in the case of providers which can demonstrate financial  need,

 expenditures pursuant to this section.
  (b)  Beginning with the first year that the annual increase in amounts
 appropriated for the purposes of this section shall equal at least  five
 million  dollars,  for  that  increase and all increases thereafter, the
 director shall distribute such increases to designated agencies for  the
 provision  of  social  adult day care programs for functionally impaired
 elderly persons based on a formula developed by the office  which  shall
 consider  at  least  the following: the number of elderly persons in the
 area; and the number of functionally impaired  elderly  persons  in  the
 area  as  determined by the office. Base funding established under para-
 graph (a) of this  subdivision  shall  continue  to  be  distributed  as
 provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision. Within the amounts appro-
 priated therefor, designated agencies authorized to provide social adult
 day care under this section shall be eligible for reimbursement from the
 state  for  seventy-five  percent of allowable expenditures for approved
 social adult day care services pursuant to this section up  to  a  level
 authorized  by  the  director;  provided  however,  that certain in-kind
 equivalents may comprise the twenty-five percent match.

 twenty  of  the  federal  social  security  act, or any other government
 program. In  addition,  funding  pursuant  to  this  section  shall  not
 supplant  any  existing  public  or private funding for social adult day
 care programs.
  (B) NO SOCIAL ADULT DAY CARE PROGRAM  SHALL  BE  ELIGIBLE  TO  RECEIVE

 SECTION, BY THE DIRECTOR.

 TWO OF THIS SECTION ON OR BEFORE  DECEMBER  THIRTY-FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND
 TWENTY-NINE.  UNTIL  AN  INITIAL  INSPECTION  IS  CONDUCTED, AN EXISTING

 OR  ANY  OTHER  PUBLIC  FUNDING  SHALL  NOT  REQUIRE  A  CERTIFICATE  OF
 INSPECTION TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SUCH FUNDING.
  (D) A SOCIAL ADULT DAY CARE PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT CORRECT DEFICIENCIES
 AS  REQUIRED  BY PARAGRAPH (D) OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION MAY NO
 LONGER BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING AS DETERMINED BY THE DIRECTOR.
