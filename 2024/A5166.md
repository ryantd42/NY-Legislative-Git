 (A) OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER, IN ADDITION TO AMOUNTS
 DUE UNDER THE POLICY, INTEREST, COSTS, AND  DISBURSEMENTS,  COMPENSATORY
 DAMAGES  AND  REASONABLE  ATTORNEYS'  FEES INCURRED BY THE POLICY HOLDER
 FROM THE DATE OF THE LOSS, IN RECOVERING  MONIES  DUE  PURSUANT  TO  THE
 TERMS OF THE POLICY.
  (C)  ANY POLICY HOLDER MAY RECOVER DAMAGES FROM AN INSURER DOING BUSI-
 NESS IN THIS STATE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION EITHER AS PART OF AN  ACTION

 AVOID PREJUDICE TO THE INSURER ON THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY UNDER THE POLI-
 CY  AND  FACILITATE  ADMISSIBILITY  OF  EVIDENCE ON THE CAUSES OF ACTION
 ASSERTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.
  (E) ALL AMOUNTS RECOVERED  FROM  AN  INSURER  AS  ACTUAL  DAMAGES  AND
