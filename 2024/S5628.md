  §  898-Q.  VENUE. 1. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW TO THE
 CONTRARY, A CIVIL ACTION BROUGHT UNDER  SECTION  EIGHT  HUNDRED  NINETY-

  § 898-R. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. 1. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF
 LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,  THE  STATE  HAS SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY, A POLITICAL

 ACTION, CLAIM, OR COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY TYPE OF LEGAL OR EQUITABLE  ACTION
 THAT  CHALLENGES  THE  VALIDITY  OF ANY PROVISION OR APPLICATION OF THIS
 ARTICLE, ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS OR OTHERWISE.
  2. A PROVISION OF STATE LAW SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO WAIVE  OR  ABRO-
 GATE  AN IMMUNITY DESCRIBED BY SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION UNLESS IT
 EXPRESSLY WAIVES IMMUNITY UNDER THIS SECTION.
  § 898-S. SEVERABILITY. 1. IT IS THE INTENT  OF  THE  LEGISLATURE  THAT
 EVERY  PROVISION,  SECTION,  SUBDIVISION,  SENTENCE, CLAUSE, PHRASE, AND
 WORD IN THIS CHAPTER, AND EVERY APPLICATION OF THE  PROVISIONS  IN  THIS
 ARTICLE, ARE SEVERABLE FROM EACH OTHER.
  2.  IF ANY APPLICATION OF ANY PROVISION IN THIS ARTICLE TO ANY PERSON,
 GROUP OF PERSONS, OR CIRCUMSTANCES IS FOUND BY A COURT TO BE INVALID  OR
 UNCONSTITUTIONAL,  THE  REMAINING  APPLICATIONS OF THAT PROVISION TO ALL
 OTHER PERSONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES  SHALL  BE  SEVERED  AND  SHALL  NOT  BE
 AFFECTED.  ALL CONSTITUTIONALLY VALID APPLICATIONS OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL
 BE SEVERED FROM ANY APPLICATIONS THAT A COURT FINDS TO BE INVALID, LEAV-
 ING THE VALID APPLICATIONS IN FORCE, BECAUSE  IT  IS  THE  LEGISLATURE'S
 INTENT  AND  PRIORITY  THAT  THE  VALID APPLICATIONS BE ALLOWED TO STAND
 ALONE. EVEN IF A REVIEWING COURT FINDS A PROVISION OF  THIS  ARTICLE  TO
 IMPOSE  AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL BURDEN IN A LARGE OR SUBSTANTIAL FRACTION OF
 RELEVANT CASES, THE APPLICATIONS THAT DO NOT PRESENT AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL
 BURDEN SHALL BE SEVERED FROM THE REMAINING APPLICATIONS AND SHALL REMAIN
 IN FORCE, AND SHALL BE TREATED AS IF THE LEGISLATURE HAD ENACTED A STAT-
 UTE LIMITED TO THE PERSONS, GROUP OF PERSONS, OR CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH
 THE STATUTE'S APPLICATION DOES NOT PRESENT AN  UNCONSTITUTIONAL  BURDEN.
 IF  ANY  COURT  DECLARES  OR  FINDS A PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE FACIALLY
 UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WHEN DISCRETE APPLICATIONS OF THAT  PROVISION  CAN  BE
 ENFORCED  AGAINST  A  PERSON, GROUP OF PERSONS, OR CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT
 VIOLATING THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION  AND  THE  STATE  CONSTITUTION,
 SUCH  APPLICATIONS  SHALL  BE SEVERED FROM ALL REMAINING APPLICATIONS OF
 THE PROVISION, AND THE PROVISION SHALL BE INTERPRETED AS IF THE LEGISLA-
 TURE HAD ENACTED A PROVISION LIMITED TO THE PERSONS, GROUP  OF  PERSONS,
 S. 5628  8
 
 OR  CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH THE PROVISION'S APPLICATION WILL NOT VIOLATE
 THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND THE STATE CONSTITUTION.
  3.  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER DECLARES THAT IT WOULD HAVE ENACTED THIS
 ARTICLE, AND EACH PROVISION,  SECTION,  SUBDIVISION,  SENTENCE,  CLAUSE,
 PHRASE,  AND  WORD, AND ALL CONSTITUTIONAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS ARTICLE,
 IRRESPECTIVE OF THE  FACT  THAT  ANY  PROVISION,  SECTION,  SUBDIVISION,
 SENTENCE,  CLAUSE, PHRASE, OR WORD, OR APPLICATION OF THIS ARTICLE, WERE
 TO BE DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL  OR  TO  REPRESENT  AN  UNCONSTITUTIONAL
 BURDEN.
  4. IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE IS FOUND BY ANY COURT TO BE UNCON-
 STITUTIONALLY VAGUE, THEN THE APPLICATIONS OF THAT PROVISION THAT DO NOT
 PRESENT CONSTITUTIONAL VAGUENESS PROBLEMS SHALL BE SEVERED AND REMAIN IN
 FORCE.
  5.  A COURT SHALL NOT DECLINE TO ENFORCE THE SEVERABILITY REQUIREMENTS
 OF THIS SECTION ON THE GROUND THAT SEVERANCE WOULD REWRITE  THE  STATUTE
 OR  INVOLVE THE COURT IN LEGISLATIVE OR LAWMAKING ACTIVITY. A COURT THAT
 DECLINES TO ENFORCE OR ENJOINS A STATE OFFICIAL FROM ENFORCING A  STATU-
 TORY  PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT REWRITE A STATUTE, AS THE STAT-
 UTE CONTINUES TO CONTAIN THE SAME WORDS AS BEFORE THE COURT'S  DECISION.
 EACH OF THE FOLLOWING IS TRUE ABOUT A JUDICIAL INJUNCTION OR DECLARATION
 OF UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF A PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE:
  (A)  IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN EDICT PROHIBITING ENFORCEMENT THAT MAY
 SUBSEQUENTLY BE VACATED BY A LATER COURT IF THAT COURT HAS  A  DIFFERENT
 UNDERSTANDING  OF  THE  REQUIREMENTS  OF  THE  STATE CONSTITUTION OR THE
 UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.
  (B) IT IS NOT A FORMAL AMENDMENT OF THE LANGUAGE IN A STATUTE.
  (C) IT NO MORE REWRITES A STATUTE THAN A DECISION BY THE EXECUTIVE NOT
 TO ENFORCE A DULY-ENACTED STATUTE  IN  A  LIMITED  AND  DEFINED  SET  OF
 CIRCUMSTANCES.

  § 4. 1. A statute that regulates or prohibits firearms  shall  not  be
 construed  to  repeal  any  other  statute  that  regulates or prohibits
 firearms, either wholly or  partly,  unless  the  later-enacted  statute
 explicitly states that it is repealing the other statute.
  2.  A  statute shall not be construed to restrict a political subdivi-
 sion from regulating or prohibiting firearms in  a  manner  that  is  at
 least as stringent as the laws of this state, unless the statute explic-
 itly  states  that political subdivisions are prohibited from regulating
 or prohibiting firearms in the manner described by the statute.
  3. Every statute that regulates or prohibits firearms is severable  in
 each  of its applications to every person and circumstance. If any stat-
 ute that regulates or prohibits firearms is found by  any  court  to  be
 unconstitutional,  either  on  its face or as applied, then all applica-
 tions of that statute that do not violate the United States Constitution
 and the state constitution shall be severed  from  the  unconstitutional
 applications  and  shall  remain  enforceable, notwithstanding any other
 law, and the statute shall be  interpreted  as  if  containing  language

 take  effect upon the final determination of a court of competent juris-
 diction that the provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section
 eight hundred ninety-eight-n of the general business  law  as  added  by
 section  one  of this act are invalid or unconstitutional; provided that
 the attorney general shall notify the legislative bill drafting  commis-
 sion  upon  the  occurrence  of such a final determination by a court in
 order that the commission may maintain an accurate and timely  effective
 data  base  of the official text of the laws of the state of New York in
 furtherance of effectuating the provisions of section 44 of the legisla-
 tive law and section 70-b of the public officers law.
