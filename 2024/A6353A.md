 means  any  beverage  identified  through  the  use of letters, words or
 symbols on its product label as a type of water, including any  flavored

 tion law, as amended by section one of this act, is amended to  read  as

 means  any  beverage  identified  through  the  use of letters, words or
 symbols  on its product label as a type of water, including any flavored

  § 3. Subdivision 12 of section 27-1003 of the environmental  conserva-
 tion  law, as added by section 3 of part SS of chapter 59 of the laws of
 2009, is amended and a new subdivision 14 is added to read as follows:
  12. "Reverse vending machine" means an automated device  that  uses  a
 laser  scanner, microprocessor, or other technology to accurately recog-
 nize the universal product code (UPC) on containers to determine if  the
 container is redeemable and accumulates information regarding containers
 redeemed,  including  the  number  of  such containers redeemed, thereby
 enabling the reverse vending machine to accept containers from redeemers
 and to issue a scrip or receipt for their refund value. SUCH  DEFINITION
 SHALL  ALSO APPLY TO ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY APPROVED BY THE COMMISSIONER
 PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (III) OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF
 SECTION 27-1007 OF THIS TITLE.
  14. "STATE-SPECIFIC UPC CODE" MEANS A UNIVERSAL PRODUCT CODE AND LABEL
 DESIGN THAT IS UNIQUE TO NEW YORK OR USED ONLY IN NEW YORK AND ANY OTHER
 STATES THAT HAVE A SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR REFUND VALUE LAW.
  §  4.  Section 27-1007 of the environmental conservation law, as added
 by section 4 of part SS of chapter 59 of the laws of 2009, paragraph (b)
 of subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 459 of  the  laws  of  2011,  and
 subdivision 12 as added by section 3 of part F of chapter 58 of the laws
 of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
 § 27-1007. Mandatory acceptance.
  Except as provided in section 27-1009 of this title:
  1.  (a)  A  dealer shall accept at his or her place of business from a
 redeemer any empty beverage  containers  of  the  design,  shape,  size,
 color, composition and brand sold or offered for sale by the dealer, and
 shall  pay  to  the  redeemer  the  refund  value  of each such beverage
 container as established in section 27-1005 of this  title.  Redemptions
 of  refund  value  must be in legal tender, or a scrip or receipt from a
 reverse vending machine, provided that  the  scrip  or  receipt  can  be
 exchanged  for  legal  tender  for  a period of not less than sixty days
 without requiring the purchase of other goods.  IN THE EVENT SUCH  SCRIP
 OR  RECEIPT  EXPIRES, SUCH SCRIP OR RECEIPT MUST INDICATE ANY EXPIRATION
 DATE AND THE DEALER MUST POST A CONSPICUOUS  SIGN  INDICATING  HOW  MANY
 DAYS  A  REDEEMER HAS TO EXCHANGE THE SCRIP OR RECEIPT FOR LEGAL TENDER.
 IF SUCH NOTIFICATION IS NOT PROVIDED, A  DEALER  MUST  REDEEM  THE  FULL
 REFUND VALUE INDICATED ON ANY LEGIBLE SCRIP OR RECEIPT. The use or pres-
 ence  of  a  reverse  vending  machine shall not relieve a dealer of any
 obligations imposed pursuant to this section. If  a  dealer  utilizes  a
 reverse  vending  machine to redeem containers, the dealer shall provide
 redemption of beverage containers when the reverse  vending  machine  is
 full,  broken,  under  repair  or  does  not  accept  a type of beverage
 container sold or offered for sale by such dealer and may not limit  the
 hours  or  days of redemption except as provided by subdivision three of
 this section.
  (b) Beginning March first, two thousand ten, a dealer whose  place  of
 business  is  part of a chain engaged in the same general field of busi-
 ness which operates ten or more units in this state under common  owner-
 ship  and  whose business has at least: (i) forty thousand but less than
 sixty thousand square feet devoted to the  display  of  merchandise  for
 sale to the public shall install and maintain at least two reverse vend-
 A. 6353  3
 
 ing  machines at the dealer's place of business; (ii) sixty thousand but
 less than eighty-five thousand square feet devoted  to  the  display  of
 merchandise  for  sale to the public shall install and maintain at least
 three  reverse  vending  machines  at the dealer's place of business; or
 (iii) eighty-five  thousand  square  feet  devoted  to  the  display  of
 merchandise  for  sale to the public shall install and maintain at least
 four reverse vending machines at the dealer's  place  of  business.  The
 requirements of [paragraph (b) of] this subdivision to install and main-
 tain  reverse  vending  machines  shall  not apply to a dealer that: (i)
 sells only beverage containers of  twenty  ounces  or  less  where  such
 beverage  containers  are  packaged  in  quantities fewer than six; (ii)
 sells beverage containers and devotes no more than five percent  of  its
 floor  space to the display and sale of consumer commodities, as defined
 in section two hundred fourteen-h of the agriculture and markets law; or
 (iii) obtains a waiver from  the  commissioner  authorizing  dealers  to
 provide consumers with an alternative technology that: (A) determines if
 the  container  is  redeemable,  (B)  provides protections against fraud
 through a system that validates each container redeemed by  reading  the
 universal  product  code and, except with respect to refillable contain-
 ers, renders the container  unredeemable,  (C)  accumulates  information
 regarding  containers redeemed, and (D) issues legal tender, or a scrip,
 receipt, or other form of credit for  the  refund  value,  that  can  be
 exchanged  for  legal  tender  for  a period of not less than sixty days
 without requiring the purchase of other goods AND INCLUDES  ANY  EXPIRA-
 TION  DATE ON THE SCRIP, RECEIPT, OR OTHER FORM OF CREDIT. Notwithstand-
 ing the foregoing, if the alternative technology does not allow  consum-
 ers  to immediately obtain the refund value of the redeemed container, a
 dealer shall be permitted to deploy such alternative technology only  if
 it  also offers an alternative that allows consumers to conveniently and
 immediately obtain such refund value through a reverse  vending  machine
 or other alternative method.
  (c) A dealer to which paragraph (b) of this subdivision does not apply
 and whose place of business is at least forty thousand square feet which
 does  not  utilize  reverse  vending  machines to process empty beverage
 containers for redemption shall: (i) establish and maintain a  dedicated
 area  within such business to accept beverage containers for redemption;
 (ii) adequately staff such area to facilitate efficient  acceptance  and
 processing  of such containers during business hours; and (iii) post one
 or more conspicuous signs conforming to the size and color  requirements
 described  in subdivision two of this section at each public entrance to
 the business which describes where in the business the  redemption  area
 is  located.  The  commissioner  may  establish in rules and regulations
 additional standards for the efficient processing of beverage containers
 by such dealers.
  (d) For the purposes of this subdivision on any day that a  dealer  is
 open  for less than twenty-four hours, the dealer may restrict or refuse
 the payment of refund values during the first and last hour  the  dealer
 is open for business.
  2.  A dealer shall post a conspicuous sign, at the point of sale, that
 states:
  "NEW YORK BOTTLE BILL OF RIGHTS
 
  STATE LAW REQUIRES US TO REDEEM EMPTY RETURNABLE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS OF
  THE SAME TYPE AND BRAND THAT WE SELL OR OFFER FOR SALE
 A. 6353  4
 
 YOU HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS UNDER THE NEW YORK  STATE  RETURNABLE  CONTAINER
 ACT:
  THE  RIGHT  to  return your empties for refund to any dealer who sells

 dealer  or  not.  It is illegal to return containers for refund that you
 did not pay a deposit on in New York state.
  THE RIGHT to get  your  deposit  refund  in  cash,  without  proof  of
 purchase.
  THE  RIGHT  to  return  your empties any day, any hour, except for the
 first and last hour of the dealer's business day (empty  containers  may
 be redeemed at any time in 24-hour stores).
  THE  RIGHT  to  return  your  containers if they are empty and intact.
 Washing containers is not required by law, but is  strongly  recommended
 to maintain sanitary conditions.
  The New York state returnable container act can be enforced by the New
 York  state department of environmental conservation, the New York state
 department of agriculture and markets, the New York state department  of
 taxation and finance, the New York state attorney general and/or by your
 local government."
  Such  sign must be no less than eight inches by ten inches in size and
 have lettering a minimum of one quarter inch high, and of a color  which
 contrasts with the background. The department shall maintain a toll free
 telephone number for a "bottle bill complaint line" that shall be avail-
 able from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each business day to receive reports of
 violations  of  this  title. The telephone number shall be listed on any
 sign required by this section.
  3. On or after June first, two thousand nine, a dealer may  limit  the
 number of empty beverage containers to be accepted for redemption at the
 dealer's  place  of  business to no less than seventy-two containers per
 visit, per redeemer, per day, provided that:
  (a) The dealer has a written agreement with a redemption center, be it
 either at a fixed physical location within the same  county  and  within
 [one-half]  ONE  mile  of  the  dealer's  place of business, or a mobile
 redemption center, operated by a  redemption  center,  that  is  located
 within  one-quarter  mile of the dealer's place of business. The redemp-
 tion center must have a written agreement  with  the  dealer  to  accept
 containers on behalf of the dealer; and the redemption center's hours of
 operation  must  cover  at least 9:00 a.m. through 7:00 p.m. daily or in
 the case of a mobile redemption center,  the  hours  of  operation  must
 cover  at  least  four consecutive hours between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.
 daily. The dealer must post a conspicuous, permanent sign,  meeting  the
 size  and  color  specifications  set  forth  in subdivision two of this
 section, open to public view, identifying  the  location  and  hours  of
 operation  of  the  affiliated  redemption  center  or mobile redemption
 center; and
  (b) The dealer provides, at a minimum, a consecutive two  hour  period
 between  7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. daily whereby the dealer will accept up
 to two hundred forty containers, per redeemer,  per  day,  and  posts  a
 conspicuous,  permanent  sign, meeting the size and color specifications
 set forth in subdivision two of this section, open to public view, iden-
 tifying those hours. The dealer may not change the hours  of  redemption
 without first posting a thirty day notice; and
  (c) The dealer's primary business is the sale of food or beverages for
 consumption  off-premises,  and  the  dealer's place of business is less
 than ten thousand square feet in size.

  4. A deposit initiator shall accept from a dealer  or  operator  of  a
 redemption  center  any  empty  beverage container of the design, shape,
 size, color, composition and brand sold  or  offered  for  sale  by  the
 deposit  initiator, and shall pay the dealer or operator of a redemption
 center  the  refund value of each such beverage container as established
 by section 27-1005 of this title. A deposit initiator shall  accept  and
 redeem  all  such  empty beverage containers from a dealer or redemption
 center without limitation on quantity.
  5. A deposit initiator's or distributor's failure  to  pick  up  empty
 beverage containers, including containers processed in a reverse vending
 machine,  from  a redemption center, dealer or the operator of a reverse
 vending machine, IN A TIMELY MANNER AND AT REASONABLE TIMES AS  PROVIDED
 BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  PURSUANT TO THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO
 PARAGRAPH (C) OF SUBDIVISION EIGHT OF THIS SECTION shall be a  violation
 of this title.
  6.  In  addition to the refund value of a beverage container as estab-
 lished by section 27-1005 of this title, a deposit initiator  shall  pay
 to any dealer or operator of a redemption center a handling fee of three
 and  one-half  cents for each beverage container accepted by the deposit
 initiator from such dealer or operator of a redemption center.  BEGIN-
 NING  APRIL FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX, THE HANDLING FEE WILL BE SIX
 CENTS. Payment of the handling fee shall be as compensation for collect-
 ing, sorting and packaging of empty beverage  containers  for  transport
 back  to  the deposit initiator or its designee. Payment of the handling
 fee may not be conditioned on the purchase of any goods or services, nor
 may such payment be made out of the  refund  value  account  established
 pursuant  to  section  27-1012 of this title. A distributor who does not
 initiate deposits on a type of beverage container is considered a dealer
 only for the purpose of receiving a handling fee from a  deposit  initi-
 ator.
  7.  A deposit initiator on a brand shall accept from a distributor who
 does not initiate deposits on that brand any empty  beverage  containers
 of that brand accepted by the distributor from a dealer or operator of a
 redemption  center  and shall reimburse the distributor the refund value
 of each such beverage container, as established by  section  27-1005  of
 this  title.  In  addition,  the  deposit initiator shall reimburse such
 distributor for each such beverage container  the  handling  fee  estab-
 lished  under  subdivision  six  of  this  section. Without limiting the
 rights of the department or any person, firm or corporation  under  this
 subdivision  or any other provision of this section, a distributor shall
 have a civil right of action to  enforce  this  subdivision,  including,
 upon three days notice, the right to apply for temporary and preliminary
 injunctive  relief against continuing violations, and until arrangements
 for collection and return of empty containers or reimbursement  of  such
 distributor for such deposits and handling fees are made.
  8. It shall be the responsibility of the deposit initiator or distrib-
 utor  to provide to a dealer or redemption center a sufficient number of
 bags, cartons, or other suitable containers, at no cost, for the packag-
 ing, handling and pickup of  empty  beverage  containers  that  are  not
 redeemed  through  a  reverse  vending  machine.  The  bags, cartons, or
 containers must be provided by the deposit initiator or distributor on a
 schedule that allows the dealer or redemption center sufficient time  to
 sort  the  empty  beverage  containers  prior  to pick up by the deposit
 initiator or distributor. In addition:
  (a) When picking up empty beverage containers, a deposit initiator  or
 distributor  shall  not  require  a  dealer or redemption center to load
 A. 6353  6
 
 their own bags, cartons or containers onto or into  the  deposit  initi-
 ator's  or  distributor's  vehicle  or  vehicles or provide the staff or
 equipment needed to do  so.  HOWEVER,  WHERE  PALLETS  OR  SKIDS,  BAGS,
 CARTONS OR CONTAINERS ARE READILY MOVABLE ONLY BY MEANS OF A FORKLIFT OR
 SIMILAR  EQUIPMENT,  A  DEPOSIT  INITIATOR  OR DISTRIBUTOR MAY REQUIRE A
 DEALER OR REDEMPTION CENTER TO MOVE OR LOAD SUCH ITEMS AT NO COST  USING
 A  FORKLIFT  OR  SIMILAR EQUIPMENT BELONGING TO THE DEALER OR REDEMPTION
 CENTER PROVIDED THAT SUCH EQUIPMENT AND APPROPRIATE  STAFF  ARE  READILY
 AVAILABLE.
  (b)  A  deposit  initiator  or  distributor  shall  not  require empty
 containers to be counted at a location other than the redemption  center
 or  dealer's  place  of  business. The dealer or redemption center shall
 have the right to be present at the count. IN THE EVENT OF A DISCREPANCY
 BETWEEN THE COUNT OF THE DEALER OR REDEMPTION CENTER AND  THE  COUNT  OF
 THE  DEPOSIT  INITIATOR  OR  DISTRIBUTOR  FOR  CONTAINERS  NOT PROCESSED
 THROUGH A REVERSE VENDING MACHINE ALL SUCH  EMPTY  CONTAINERS  SHALL  BE
 RETAINED  AND A RE-COUNT MAY BE REQUESTED. THE RE-COUNT MAY BE HELD AT A
 LOCATION OTHER THAN THE REDEMPTION CENTER OR DEALER'S PLACE OF  BUSINESS
 ONLY IF THE DEALER OR REDEMPTION CENTER AGREES AND IS PRESENT.
  (c)  A  deposit  initiator or distributor shall pick up empty beverage
 containers from the dealer or redemption center IN A TIMELY  MANNER  AND
 at  reasonable  times  [and  intervals]  as determined in rules or regu-
 lations promulgated by the department NO LATER  THAN  APRIL  FIRST,  TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX.
  9.  No  person shall return or assist another to return to a dealer or
 redemption center an empty beverage container for its  refund  value  if
 such  container had previously been accepted for redemption by a dealer,
 redemption center, or deposit initiator who initiates deposits on bever-
 age containers of the same brand.
  10. A redeemer, dealer, distributor or  redemption  center  shall  not
 knowingly  redeem  an  empty  beverage  container on which a deposit was
 never paid in New York state.
  11. Notwithstanding the  provisions  of  subdivision  two  of  section
 27-1009  of  this title, a deposit initiator or distributor shall accept
 and redeem beverage containers as provided in this title, if the  dealer
 or  operator  of  a  redemption  center shall have accepted and paid the
 refund value of such beverage containers.
  12. No person shall intentionally program, tamper with, render inaccu-
 rate, or circumvent the proper operation of a reverse vending machine to
 wrongfully elicit deposit monies  when  no  valid,  redeemable  beverage
 container has been placed in and properly processed by the reverse vend-
 ing machine.
  13.  THE  DEPARTMENT  AND  THE  DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE ARE
 AUTHORIZED TO AUDIT ANY REVERSE VENDING MACHINE.
  § 5. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 3 of section 27-1011 of the environ-

 or redemption of beverage containers on which no deposit was initiated.
  c.  A  bottler  or deposit initiator shall notify the department, in a
 form prescribed by the department,  whenever  a  beverage  container  or
 beverage  container  label  is revised by altering the universal product
