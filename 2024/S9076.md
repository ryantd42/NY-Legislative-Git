  § 3. This act shall take effect July 1, 2024.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would amend both the General Municipal Law and the Retire-
 ment and Social Security Law to increase the salary used in the computa-
 tion of the special accidental death benefit by 3% in  cases  where  the
 date of death was before 2024.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would  be  shared
 by  the  State  of New York and the local participating employers in the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the increase in the present value of  benefits  would  be  approximately
 $8.5 million.
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
 S. 9076  4

  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1-5  $8.5 million  $4.1 million
  Tier 6  $0.0 million  $4.4 million
  Total  $8.5 million  $8.5 million
 
  In  the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement is funded by increasing the
 billing rates charged annually to cover both retrospective and  prospec-
 tive  benefit increases. The annual contribution required of all partic-
 ipating employers in NYSLPFRS is 0.02% of billable salary,  or  approxi-
 mately  $170,000  to the State of New York and approximately $700,000 to
 the local participating employers. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will  vary
 in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary
 of the members in the NYSLPFRS.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership  data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2023 actuari-
 al valuation. Distributions and other statistics can  be  found  in  the
 2023  Report  of the Actuary and the 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial
 Report.

 fication Standards to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
  This fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the  viability
 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated April 10, 2024, and intended for use only  during
 the  2024  Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2024-158, prepared by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation, as it relates to the New York City
 Retirement Systems and Pension Funds  (NYCRS),  would  increase  Special
 Accidental  Death  Benefits  (SADB) for Eligible Beneficiaries of former
 members of NYCRS who died due to an accident sustained in  the  perform-
 ance of duty.

  *  The  costs of this proposed legislation have already been accounted
 for and will not result in a further increase in employer contributions.
 The table above shows the expected DECREASE in employer contributions if
 the proposed legislation is NOT enacted.
 
  The impact on employer contributions in the first year is estimated to
 be $7.9 million for New York City and $0.1 million for other obligors of
 NYCRS.

  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
  NYCERS  POLICE  FIRE
 
 Active Members
 - Number Count:  18,784  33,800  10,720
 - Average Age:  41.8  37.6  40.8
 - Average Service:  11.3  11.3  13.9
 - Average Salary:  105,600  128,600  139,500
 Receiving Members
 - Number Count:  85  596  706
 - Average Age:  66.0  63.6  66.9
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS: The SADB cost-of-living adjustments have
 been passed by the legislature each  year.  Under  the  proposed  legis-
 S. 9076  6

 lation,  an additional 3.0% of Final Salary would be applied to the SADB
 paid effective July 1, 2024.
  The  SADB is paid to the deceased member's surviving spouse, if alive.
 If the spouse is no longer alive, the  SADB  is  paid  to  the  deceased
 member's  children  until  age  eighteen  or until age twenty-three if a
 student. If neither a spouse nor a dependent child is  alive,  the  SADB
 may  be  paid  to  the member's parents or certain other individuals, if
 eligible.
  The proposed legislation would impact  the  SADB  payable  to  certain
 survivors  of  NYCERS,  POLICE,  and  FIRE  who were employed in certain
 uniformed positions of the following New York City employers:
  Police Department, Fire Department, Department of Sanitation,  Housing
 Authority,  Transit  Authority,  Department  of  Correction,  Health and
 Hospitals Corporation (as EMT), New  York  City  (as  Emergency  Medical
 Technician - EMT), or Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (Bridge and
 Tunnel Position).
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  Based  on  the historical practice of providing 3.0% COLAs on the SADB
 each year, and the likelihood that COLAs will continue to be granted  in
 the  future,  the Actuary assumes that the SADB benefit will continue to
 increase 3.0% per year in the future  when  determining  NYCRS  employer
 contributions.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 sky  are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of
 Actuaries. We are members of NYCERS but do not believe  it  impairs  our
