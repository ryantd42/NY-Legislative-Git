acknowledge  the outstanding contributions made by older citizens during
National Older Americans Month; and

our  Nation  to  be  the  greatest  in the world; they have defended our
freedoms and values to ensure that those who come after  them  may  have

State of New York; and

on  a  fulfilling  career  as a social worker, serving in long-term care
facilities across several counties in New York.; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kathy Miller's passion for serving  older  adults  led  her
back  to  Chenango  County,  where  she  served  as  a  case manager and
counselor  for  the  Health  Insurance  Information,  Counseling  and
Assistance  Program  (HIICAP),  which  provides  free  and  objective
counseling to older  adults  on  Medicare  and  other  health  insurance
questions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Now  retired, Kathy Miller continues her commitment to the
community by volunteering during the agency's busy HIICAP season; and
 
  WHEREAS, Known for her extensive knowledge and genuine care for  her
clients,  Kathy  Miller  takes  the  extra  time  to  build  meaningful
relationships and ensure comprehensive support for everyone; and
 
  WHEREAS, Beyond her volunteer work,  Kathy  Miller  enjoys  spending
time  with  her family, including her sons and grandchildren, as well as
indulging in her love for travel; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by  an
individual  for  the  benefit of others which Kathy Miller has displayed
throughout her life; and
