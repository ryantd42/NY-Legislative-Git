  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to declare
  March  11,  2023,  to  April  12,  2023,  as
  Garifuna-American Heritage Month in the State of New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored  traditions,  it  is the intent of this Legislative Body to
applaud and commemorate events which foster ethnic pride  and  exemplify
the cultural diversity that represents and strengthens the spirit of the
people and the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to declare March 11, 2023, to April 12,  2023,  as
Garifuna-American Heritage Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Garifuna-American  Heritage  Month  celebrates  the  great
contributions of Garifuna-Americans to the fabric of New York City,  and
pays  tribute  to  the common culture and bonds of friendship that unite
the United States and  the  Garifuna  countries  of  Belize,  Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Garifuna-American  Heritage  Month  affirms  the  culture,
identity and self-esteem of a people; it celebrates a rich heritage  and
illuminates  Garifuna history and tradition, as well as the spirit of an
indomitable people; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1665, two Spanish ships wrecked off  the  coast  of  St.
Vincent; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  West  African  slaves  that  escaped  to  the  island
eventually intermarried with  the  Caribs  and  the  Arawaks  indigenous
native people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The new race of people, known as the Garifuna, grew strong
and prosperous on the island; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1795, the Garifuna began the Second  Carib  War  against
the  British;  battles  raged  throughout St. Vincent over the next year
with both sides enduring heavy losses; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 10, 1796,  the  final  battle  commenced  with  the
Garifuna and British, resulting in the Garifuna's surrender; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  surviving  Black Caribs were forcibly deported to the
neighboring island of Balliceaux; and
 
  WHEREAS, On March 11, 1797, the defeated Garifuna were loaded onto a
convoy of eight vessels and transported to Roatan, Honduras, where  they
 
arrived  on April 12th of that year; this resulted in permanent Garifuna
Family Separation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year  we  commemorate  the  226th Anniversary of the
Forcible Deportation of the Garifuna People  by  the  British  from  St.
Vincent and the Grenadines and their settlement in Central America; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Garifuna began to migrate to the United States during
the 1930s; today,  New  York  City  is  home  to  the  largest  Garifuna
community outside of Central America; and
 
  WHEREAS, Garifuna-American Heritage Month provides an opportunity to
celebrate  the  Garifuna  family  reunification  and  recognize  the
significance of Garifuna's contributions to the quality and character of
life of New York State, through many events  and  activities  throughout
the  month,  for  all  people to gain a greater appreciation of Garifuna
history and traditions, and of the role Garifuna-Americans have  played,
and will continue to play, in New York's society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  New  Yorkers  of Garifuna heritage such as Marsena
Balantine, Jemma Lewis,  Sara  Nunez  Mejia,  Rosemary  Ordonez-Jenkins,
Sulma  Arzu-Brown,  Aquina  Valentin  Mirtha Colon, James Lovell, Rosita
Alvarez, Paula Castillo, Marcia Gomez, Evelyn Arauz  Chamorro  and  Jose
Francisco  Avila  continue  to  recognize  and honor the legacy of their
ancestors; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to declare March 11, 2023, to April
12, 2023, as Garifuna-American Heritage Month in the State of New  York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
