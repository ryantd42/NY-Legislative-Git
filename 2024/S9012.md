 Introduced  by Sen. MARTINEZ -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to the sale, manufac-
  ture, and distribution of vapor products
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Subdivisions  3  and  4  of section 1399-cc of the public
 health law, subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 100 of the laws of  2019
 and  subdivision  4  as  amended by chapter 542 of the laws of 2014, are
 amended to read as follows:
  3. Sale of  tobacco  products,  herbal  cigarettes,  liquid  nicotine,
 shisha  or  electronic cigarettes in such places, [other than] INCLUDING
 by a vending machine, shall be made only to  an  individual  who  demon-
 strates,  through (a) a valid driver's license or non-driver's identifi-
 cation card issued by the commissioner of motor  vehicles,  the  federal
 government, any United States territory, commonwealth or possession, the
 District  of  Columbia, a state government within the United States or a
 provincial government of the dominion of Canada, or (b) a valid passport
 issued by the United States government or any other country, or  (c)  an
 identification  card  issued  by  the armed forces of the United States,
 indicating that the individual is at least twenty-one years of age. Such
 identification need not be required of  any  individual  who  reasonably
 appears to be at least twenty-five years of age, provided, however, that
 such  appearance shall not constitute a defense in any proceeding alleg-
 ing the sale of a tobacco product, herbal cigarettes,  liquid  nicotine,
 shisha  or electronic cigarettes to an individual under twenty-one years
 of age.
  4. (a) Any person  operating  a  place  of  business  wherein  tobacco
 products, herbal cigarettes, liquid nicotine, shisha or electronic ciga-
 rettes  are  sold  or offered for sale [may] SHALL perform a transaction
 scan as a precondition for such purchases.
  (b) In any instance where the information  deciphered  by  the  trans-
 action  scan  fails  to  match  the  information printed on the driver's
 license or non-driver identification card, or if  the  transaction  scan

 indicates  that  the  information  is false or fraudulent, the attempted
 transaction shall be denied.
  (c)  In  any  proceeding  pursuant to section thirteen hundred ninety-
 nine-ee of this article, it shall be an affirmative  defense  that  such
 person had produced a driver's license or non-driver identification card
 apparently  issued by a governmental entity, successfully completed that
 transaction scan, and that the tobacco  product,  herbal  cigarettes  or
 liquid  nicotine  had  been  sold,  delivered or given to such person in
 reasonable reliance upon such identification and  transaction  scan.  In
 evaluating the applicability of such affirmative defense the commission-
 er  shall  take into consideration any written policy adopted and imple-
 mented by the seller to effectuate the provisions of this  chapter.  Use
 of  a  transaction scan shall not excuse any person operating a place of
 business wherein tobacco products, herbal cigarettes,  liquid  nicotine,
 shisha  or  electronic  cigarettes are sold, or the agent or employee of
 such  person,  from  the  exercise  of  reasonable  diligence  otherwise
 required by this chapter. Notwithstanding the above provisions, any such
 affirmative  defense  shall  not  be applicable in any civil or criminal
 proceeding, or in any other forum.
  § 2. Section 1399-dd of the public health law, as amended  by  chapter
 448 of the laws of 2012 and subdivision (d) as amended by chapter 100 of

 cigarettes in vending machines. No person, firm, partnership, company or
 corporation shall operate a  vending  machine  which  dispenses  tobacco
 products, herbal cigarettes or electronic cigarettes unless such machine
 is  located: (a) in a bar as defined in subdivision one of section thir-
 teen hundred ninety-nine-n of this chapter, or the bar area  of  a  food
 service establishment with a valid, on-premises full liquor license; (b)
 in  a  private club; (c) in a tobacco business as defined in subdivision
 eight of section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-aa of this article; or (d)
 in a place of employment which has an insignificant portion of its regu-
 lar workforce comprised of people under the age of twenty-one years  and
 only  in  such  locations that are not accessible to the general public;
 provided, however, that in such locations the vending machine is located
 in plain view and under the direct supervision and control of the person
 in charge of the location or his or her designated  agent  or  employee;
 AND  PROVIDED  FURTHER, THAT IN SUCH LOCATIONS THE VENDING MACHINE SHALL
 NOT BE OPERABLE UNTIL THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF SUCH LOCATION  OR  HIS  OR
 HER DESIGNATED AGENT OR EMPLOYEE HAS VERIFIED THAT THE PERSON SEEKING TO
 OPERATE  SUCH VENDING MACHINE IS OVER TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE IN ACCORD-
 ANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISIONS THREE AND FOUR OF SECTION THIR-
