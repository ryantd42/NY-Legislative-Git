  COMMEMORATING  the  60th Anniversary of the Ravena
  Cement Plant
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to  honor  those
businesses  within  the  State  of New York which distinguish themselves
through outstanding professional  behavior,  corporate  innovation,  and
enduring commitment to the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Ravena Cement Plant; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ground  was  broken  in  Southern Albany County on May 19,
1961, on a $64 million facility which at the  time,  was  owned  by  the
Atlantic  Cement  Company, now known as the Ravena Cement Plant, part of
the Holcim family of companies in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  the  groundbreaking  ceremony,  attended  by  1,000
dignitaries,  elected  officials,  and  local  residents,  then Governor
Nelson A.  Rockefeller predicted that  jobs  and  economic  opportunity
would flourish; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Ravena  Cement Plant, which opened in 1962, spent the
next six decades contributing  significantly  to  the  local  and  state
economy and giving back to the surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cement  manufactured at the Ravena plant is the foundation
of New York's built environment, and is  featured  in  iconic  landmarks
across the Northeast, including the One World Trade Center Memorial, the
Mario  M.  Cuomo  Bridge,  and MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New
Jersey; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2017, the Ravena Cement Plant  completed  a  three-year,
multimillion-dollar  modernization  project which significantly improved
efficiency, producing up to 800 construction jobs  and  generating  $170
million to the local economy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  modernization  project focused on a new
kiln line which exceeds  strict  state  and  federal  emissions  limits,
striving  toward  improving  its  operations  to align with the net-zero
goals of the state, the nation and its parent company, Holcim; and
 
  WHEREAS, Like its parent company, the Ravena Cement Plant is leading
the way toward  more  efficient,  sustainable,  and  effective  building
products  and  practices,  and a development environment which is better
for builders, communities, and the planet; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Ravena  Cement  Plant  is  both  the  largest  property
taxpayer  and  largest  employer  in  Southern  Albany  County,  with
approximately 160 full-time workers,  the  vast  majority  of  whom  are
unionized, and dozens more are vendors and contractors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  steadfast  and  unwavering  commitment  to  the
communities which it serves,  the  plant  and  its  dedicated  employees
contribute  thousands  of  dollars  and  volunteer  hours  to  local
organizations, events, and causes to improve the region  in  which  they
live and work; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This auspicious occasion presents a unique opportunity for
this Legislative Body to recognize and pay tribute to the Ravena  Cement
Plant; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this exceptional business  and  its  contributions  to  the
local  and  State  economies,  fully  confident that it will continue to
enjoy the sparkling success it has experienced thus far; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  60th Anniversary of the Ravena Cement Plant; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Ravena Cement Plant, Ravena, New York.
