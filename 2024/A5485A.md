 chapter 719 of the laws of 1989, paragraph (b) as amended by chapter 524
 of the laws of 1984, subparagraph 2 of paragraph (b) as amended by chap-
 ter 733 of the laws of 1994, is amended to read as follows:
  7.  (a)  The  department  shall  adopt  regulations establishing civil
 penalties of up to one thousand dollars per  day  PER  VIOLATION,  WHICH
 SHALL  BE  ADJUSTED  ON AN ANNUAL BASIS PURSUANT TO MODIFICATIONS TO THE
 FEDERAL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AS PUBLISHED BY THE UNITED  STATES  DEPART-
 MENT  OF  LABOR,  BUREAU  OF  LABOR STATISTICS FOR ALL CHANGES SINCE
 THIS PARAGRAPH WAS ENACTED AND, FOR REPEAT  VIOLATIONS,  UNDER  SUBPARA-
 GRAPH TWO OF PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS SUBDIVISION FOR WHICH A PRIOR PENALTY
 WAS  ASSESSED,  AN  AMOUNT  UP  TO  THREE TIMES SUCH PENALTY PER DAY PER
 VIOLATION to be assessed against all adult care facilities except facil-
 ities operated by a social services district for violations of (i) regu-
 lations of the department pertaining to the care of  residents  in  such
 facilities,  (ii)  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision three of section four
 hundred sixty-one-a of this [chapter] ARTICLE, or (iii) an order  issued
 pursuant  to  subdivision  eight  of this section. The regulations shall
 specify the violations subject to penalty and the amount of the  penalty
 to  be assessed in connection with each such violation and shall specify
 that only civil penalties of up to one  thousand  dollars  per  day  per
 violation,  WHICH  SHALL  BE  ADJUSTED  ON  AN  ANNUAL BASIS PURSUANT TO
 MODIFICATIONS TO THE FEDERAL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AS  PUBLISHED  BY  THE
 UNITED  STATES  DEPARTMENT  OF  LABOR,  BUREAU  OF  LABOR STATISTICS
 FOR ALL CHANGES SINCE THIS PARAGRAPH  WAS  ENACTED,  shall  be  assessed
 pursuant  to this paragraph against an adult care facility found respon-
 sible for an act  of  retaliation  or  reprisal  against  any  resident,
 employee,  or  other  person for having filed a complaint with or having
 provided information to any long term care [patient] ombudsman function-
 ing in accordance with section [five hundred forty-four or five  hundred
 forty-five] TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN of the [executive] ELDER law.
  (b)  [(1)] In addition to any other civil or criminal penalty provided
 by law, the department shall have the power to assess civil penalties in
 accordance with its regulations adopted pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of
 this  subdivision,  after  a  hearing  conducted  in accordance with the
 procedures established by regulations of the department. Such procedures
 shall require that notice of the time and place of the hearing, together
 with a statement of charges of violations, shall be served in person  or
 by  certified  mail addressed to the facility at least thirty days prior
 to the date of the hearing. The statement of charges of violations shall
 set forth the existence of the violations, the  amount  of  penalty  for
 which  it may become liable and the steps which must be taken to rectify
 the violation and, where applicable, a  statement  that  the  department
 contends  that  a penalty may be imposed under this paragraph regardless
 of rectification. An answer to the charges of  violations,  in  writing,
 shall  be filed with the department, not less than ten days prior to the
 date of hearing. The answer shall notify the department of  the  facili-
 ty's  position with respect to each of the charges and shall include all
 matters which if not disclosed in the answer would be likely to take the
 department by surprise. The commissioner, or a member of his  staff  who
 is  designated  and  authorized  by him to hold such hearing, may in his
 discretion allow the facility to prove any matter not  included  in  the
 answer.

  (C)  (1) Where the facility satisfactorily demonstrates that it either
 had rectified the violations within thirty  days  of  receiving  written
 notification  of  the results of the inspection pursuant to section four
 hundred sixty-one-a of this [chapter] ARTICLE, or had  submitted  within
 thirty  days an acceptable plan for rectification and was rectifying the
 violations in accordance with the steps and within the additional  peri-
 ods of time as accepted by the department in such plan, no penalty shall
 be imposed, except as provided in subparagraph two of this paragraph.
  (2)  Rectification  shall  not preclude the assessment of a penalty if
 the department establishes at a hearing  that  a  particular  violation,
 although  corrected[,  endangered or resulted in harm to any resident as
 the result of]:
  (i) ENDANGERED ANY RESIDENT. ENDANGERMENT IS DEFINED AS:
  (A) the total or substantial failure of the facility's fire  detection
 or  prevention systems, or emergency evacuation procedures prescribed by
 department safety standard regulations;
  [(ii)] (B) the retention of any resident who has been evaluated by the
 resident's physician as being medically or mentally unsuited for care in
 the facility or as requiring placement  in  a  hospital  or  residential
 health  care facility and for whom the operator is not making persistent
 efforts to secure appropriate placement;
  [(iii)] (C) the failure in systemic  practices  and  procedures  WHICH
 SHALL  BE  DEFINED AS WIDESPREAD OR CHRONIC, AND MATERIAL, NONCOMPLIANCE
 WITH STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED  TO

 ARTICLE;
  [(iv)] (D) the failure of the operator to take actions as required  by
 department regulations in the event of a resident's illness or accident;

 action identified in a complaint[.
  The department shall specify in its regulations those  regulations  to
 which this subparagraph two shall apply.
  (3)  In assessing penalties pursuant to this paragraph, the department
 shall consider promptness of  rectification,  delay  occasioned  by  the
 department, and the specific circumstances of the violations as mitigat-
 ing factors.

 by  the attorney general, AFTER CONSIDERING PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS SUBDI-
 VISION AND with the consent of the department.

 closing of, after notice and opportunity to be heard, any facility which
 does not possess a valid operating certificate issued by the  department
 and  is an adult care facility subject to the provisions of this article
 and the regulations of the department. A hearing shall be  conducted  in
 accordance  with  procedures established by department regulations which
 procedures shall require that  notice  of  the  determination  that  the
 facility  is  an  adult  care facility and the reasons for such determi-
 nation and notice of the time and place of  the  hearing  be  served  in
 person  on  the operator, owner or prime lessor, if any, or by certified
 mail, return receipt requested, addressed to such person and received at
 least twenty days prior to the date of the hearing.  If  such  operator,

 service may be made by posting a copy thereof  in  a  conspicuous  place
 within  the  facility  or  by  sending a copy thereof by certified mail,
 return receipt requested, addressed to the facility. A written answer to
 the notice of violation may be filed with the department not  less  than

 ity  that  it possessed an operating certificate issued pursuant to this
 article, article twenty-eight  of  the  public  health  law  or  article

 summary of the inspection of the facility by which the department deter-
 mined  that  he or she is operating an uncertified adult care facility.]

 a penalty against the operator OF AN UNLICENSED ADULT CARE FACILITY.
