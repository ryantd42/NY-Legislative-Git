  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2023, as Childhood Cancer Awareness  Month
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State's  children  are  our  greatest resource;
childhood cancer is especially tragic; and
 
  WHEREAS, A great  number  of  children  are  impacted  by  childhood
cancer;  it  is  estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 children under
the age of 15 will be diagnosed with cancer  in  the  United  States  in
2023;  on average, about 1,000 New York children under the age of 20 are
diagnosed annually; and
 
  WHEREAS, Childhood cancer,  the  most  common  forms  of  which  are
leukemia  and  cancers  of  the brain and central nervous system, is the
second leading cause of death in children under age 15 exceeded only  by
accidents,  and  is  expected  to  take the lives of approximately 1,200
American children in 2022; on average, about 85 New  York  children  die
from cancer each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  causes  of  childhood  cancer  are  largely  unknown,
research has advanced its successful treatment and improved the  quality
of  life  for  children  coping  with  cancer  and  the  side-effects of
treatment; although five-year survival rates have increased dramatically
for some forms of childhood cancer, one out of eight children  diagnosed
with cancer does not survive; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  toll  cancer  takes  on  a  child  and  family  is
unimaginable; a pediatric patient's expectations of  a  healthy,  normal
life,  education, and growth may be put on hold, while parents must cope
with high treatment costs, stress, and the difficulties associated  with
caring  for  their  family  while  being with their child for treatment,
often having to travel or relocate to do so; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout this month these burdens are shared by countless
dedicated healthcare professionals, organizations, and  parent  advocacy
groups  that  support  patients  and  families  by  offering  advice,
encouragement, hope, and financial assistance, and  work  tirelessly  to
lift the spirits of children suffering from cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  reaffirms  its  commitment  to
encouraging continued early detection and treatment of childhood  cancer
and  access  to  quality  medical  care for treatment and post-treatment
options; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body further reaffirms its  commitment  to
provide  children  and their families with access to information and the
ability  to  interact  with  medical  experts,  researchers,  and  other
affected individuals and their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2023,  as
Childhood  Cancer  Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of New York, and to
 
encourage all New Yorkers to  support  families  coping  with  childhood
cancer,  offer  encouragement to patients, remember lost loved ones, and
appreciate the efforts of those who work to treat and  support  children
experiencing cancer; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
