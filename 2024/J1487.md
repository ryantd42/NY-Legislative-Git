BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  COMMENDING  Richard  Waterman  for his 50 years of
  dedication  and  participation  with  the  Camden
  Continentals Fife & Drum Corps
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of the citizens of the State of New York to
recognize  and  pay tribute to those institutions and individuals within
our midst that diligently strive to uphold and promote excellence, while
providing  meaningful  services  to  their  members  and  the  community
at-large; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Richard  Waterman  for  his  50  years  of  dedication  and
participation with the Camden Continentals Fife & Drum Corps; and
 
  WHEREAS, Before its establishment in Camden, New York in  1945,  the
Camden  Continentals  Fife  &  Drum  Corps  was created in the mid-1800s
within the Town of Taberg, New  York  under  the  direction  of  Alanson
White; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originally  formed  to  play  at  political  rallies  and
patriotic celebrations,  the  Camden  Continentals  Fife  &  Drum  Corps
adheres  to the mission statement to entertain the people of Central New
York, while promoting patriotism and a general sense of esprit de  corps
within the community; the Corps now appears in around 15 events per year
at parades and musters; and
 
  WHEREAS, Richard Waterman joined the Camden Continentals Fife & Drum
Corps  in the fall of 1973; he started out as a fifer for the first five
years, then picked up the bass drum when the Corps was in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dedicated to the mission of the oldest fife and drum  corps
in  New  York  State,  Richard  Waterman still plays bass drum today and
actively marches with the Corps; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments to
preserve American Heritage are brought to our attention, they should  be
celebrated  and  recognized  by  all  the  citizens of this great Empire
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Richard  Waterman  for  his  50  years  of  dedication  and
participation with the Camden Continentals Fife & Drum Corps; and be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Richard Waterman.
