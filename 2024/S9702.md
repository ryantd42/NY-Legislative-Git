  Section 1. The insurance law is amended by adding a new  section  3246

 RETROSPECTIVE  DENIAL  OF  PAYMENT  OF  SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT
 SERVICES PROVIDED THAT ARE BASED ON THE INSURED INDIVIDUAL'S ELIGIBILITY
 SHALL BE PROHIBITED AFTER THE PROVIDER HAS  VERIFIED  WITH  THE  INSURER
 THAT THE INSURED HAS COVERAGE FOR SUCH TREATMENT AT THE TIME SUCH TREAT-
 MENT  WAS  INITIATED. THE INSURER SHALL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE TREATMENT
 PROVIDER WHEN AN INSURED HAS LOST COVERAGE BASED ON TERMINATION  OF  THE
 INSURED'S  EMPLOYMENT  AND  PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  THAT DENIAL OF COVERAGE
 SHALL BE BASED ON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND SHALL NOT  BE  BASED  ON

 THE TREATMENT PROVIDER OF SUCH TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT SHALL  PRECLUDE
 ANY  RETROSPECTIVE  REVIEW  BASED  ON  THE INSURED'S ELIGIBILITY.  THIS
 SECTION SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO  THE  NEW  YORK  STATE  HEALTH  INSURANCE
