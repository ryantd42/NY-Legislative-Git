 the  education law, as added by section 2 of part A of chapter 97 of the
 laws of 2011, are amended to read as follows:
  1. Generally.  Unless otherwise provided by law, the amount  of  taxes
 that  may be levied by or on behalf of any school district, other than a
 city school district of a city with  one  hundred  twenty-five  thousand
 inhabitants  or  more,  shall  not exceed the tax levy limit established
 pursuant to this section,  not  including  any  tax  levy  necessary  to
 support  the  expenditures  pursuant to subparagraphs (i) through [(iv)]

  (4) Subtract the tax levy necessary to support the expenditures pursu-
 ant to subparagraphs (i) and [(iv)] (V) of paragraph  i  of  subdivision
 two of this section for the prior school year, if any.
  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in the
 event  the  trustee, trustees or board of education of a school district
 that is subject to the provisions of this section proposes a budget that
 will require a tax levy that exceeds the tax levy limit for  the  corre-
 sponding  school  year,  not including any levy necessary to support the
 expenditures pursuant to subparagraphs (i) through [(iv)] (V)  of  para-
 graph  i  of  subdivision two of this section, then such budget shall be
 approved if sixty percent of the votes cast thereon are in the  affirma-
 tive.
  9.  Nothing  in  this section shall preclude the trustee, trustees, or
 board of education of a  school  district,  in  their  discretion,  from
 submitting  additional  items of expenditures to the voters for approval
 as separate propositions or  the  voters  from  submitting  propositions
 pursuant  to sections two thousand eight and two thousand thirty-five of
 this part; provided however, except in the case of a proposition submit-
 ted for any  expenditure  contained  within  subparagraphs  (i)  through
 [(iv)]  (V)  of  paragraph  i of subdivision two of this section, if any
 proposition, or propositions collectively that are subject to a vote  on
 the  same date, would require an expenditure of money that would require
 a tax levy and would result in the tax levy limit being exceeded for the
 corresponding school year then such proposition  shall  be  approved  if
 sixty percent of the votes cast thereon are in the affirmative.
  §  3.  Paragraph  a  of subdivision 7 of section 1608 of the education
