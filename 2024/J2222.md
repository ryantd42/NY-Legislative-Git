  HONORING  Firefighter  Terry  Austin  upon  the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after 50 years of dedicated service to New Woodstock
  Fire Department in Madison County, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Firefighter
Terry  Austin  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition  after  50  years of dedicated service to New Woodstock Fire
Department, to be celebrated on Saturday, May  25,  2024,  at  the  fire
department's  Annual  Installation  Banquet, to be held at the Cazenovia
Country Club in Cazenovia, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Terry Austin  has  consistently  demonstrated  a  level  of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a steadfast and  unwavering  commitment  to  his  fire
company,  Terry  Austin has served for more than 20 years as a Chief and
has held a myriad of offices within the New Woodstock  Fire  Department;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Demonstrating  an unparalleled devotion to the welfare and
safety of the New Woodstock community, Terry Austin  has  most  recently
served as 2nd Assistant Chief and President of the department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond  to  an  emergency,  whether  the  emergency  is  a  fire,  a
transportation  accident,  a  natural  disaster,  an act of terrorism, a
medical crisis, or a spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Terry  Austin  is  such  a  firefighter;  throughout 50 years of devoted
service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the  call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Firefighter Terry Austin upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to New Woodstock
Fire Department in Madison County, New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter Terry Austin.
