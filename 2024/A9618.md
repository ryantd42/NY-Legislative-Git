 AN ACT in relation to authorizing Alexander D. Rusin to receive retroac-
  tive membership in the New York state and local employees'  retirement
  system
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, Alexander D.
 Rusin, an employee of the Erie county water authority and  a  member  of
 the  New  York  state  and  local  employees' retirement system, who was
 employed as a seasonal meter service worker with the Erie  county  water
 authority  with  a start date of June 2, 2008 until August 22, 2008, who
 for reasons not ascribable to his own negligence,  failed  to  become  a
 member  of  such  retirement  system  during such employment by the Erie
 county water authority in 2008, shall be deemed to have joined  the  New
 York  state  and  local employees' retirement system on the date June 2,
 2008 if, within one year of the effective date of  this  act,  he  shall
 file a written request with the state comptroller.
  §  2. No contributions made to the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system by Alexander D. Rusin shall be returned or refunded to
 him pursuant to this act.
  § 3. All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the Erie county water authority.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide Alexander Rusin with a date of  membership  of
 June  2, 2008, their date of first employment with the Erie County Water
 Authority, resulting in Tier 4 status in the New York  State  and  Local
 Employees'  Retirement  System.  Alexander  Rusin  is currently a Tier 6
 member. There will be no refund of member contributions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase  of  approximately  $5,200  in  the
 annual  contributions  of the Erie County Water Authority for the fiscal

 year ending March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary  as  the
 billing rates and salary of Alexander Rusin change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $65,100 which will be
 borne by the Erie County Water Authority as  a  one-time  payment.  This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
