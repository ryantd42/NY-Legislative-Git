 hundred forty-four of this title;
  4. In the event that their primary residence is  foreclosed  upon,  to

 dence extinguished upon the foreclosure, except  when  they  have  reac-
 quired  title  pursuant  to  subdivision  four of section eleven hundred

 acting  pursuant  to  law to remove, abate or mitigate unsafe conditions
 and/or nuisances that were present on the property at the time of  fore-
 closure,  including  but  not limited to the demolition of unsafe struc-
