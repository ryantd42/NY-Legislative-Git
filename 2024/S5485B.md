 as follows:
  a. When a court orders a hearing in a proceeding upon a writ of habeas
 corpus to inquire into the cause of detention of a person in custody  in
 a  state  institution, or when it orders a hearing in a civil proceeding
 to commit or transfer a person to or retain him in a  state  institution
 when  such person is alleged to be mentally ill, mentally defective or a
 [narcotic addict] PERSON WITH  SUBSTANCE  ABUSE  DISORDER,  or  when  it
 orders a hearing for the commitment of the guardianship and custody of a
 child  to an authorized agency by reason of the mental illness or devel-
 opmental disability of a parent, or when it orders a hearing  to  deter-
 mine  whether  consent to the adoption of a child shall be required of a
 parent who is alleged to be mentally ill or developmentally disabled, or
 when it orders a hearing to determine the best interests of a child when
 the parent of the child revokes a consent to the adoption of such  child
 and  such revocation is opposed or in any adoption or custody proceeding

 assign  counsel  to  represent such person if it is satisfied that he is
 financially unable to obtain counsel. Upon an appeal taken from an order
 entered in any such proceeding, the appellate court may  assign  counsel
