 be  required as a payment upon each award based on an accident occurring

 after said July first; provided, however, that if and when  the  surplus
 of  the fund as shown by any annual report thereafter shall be less than
 one per centum of the total outstanding loss reserves,  then  the  addi-
 tional  payments as provided in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this
 subdivision shall be resumed and shall be payable upon any  award  based
 on  an  accident  occurring  on  or after July first next succeeding the
 close of the year for which such annual report is made. Thereafter,  the
 suspension  or  resumption  of  additional  payments as required by this

 sand  dollars,  and  thereafter  five per centum of such premiums, until
 such time as in the judgment of the commissioners such surplus shall  be
 sufficiently  large  to  cover  the  catastrophe  hazard. Thereafter the
 contribution to such surplus may be reduced or discontinued  conditional
 upon constant maintenance of a sufficient surplus to cover the catastro-
 phe  hazard.  Reserves  shall  be set up and maintained adequate to meet
 anticipated losses and carry all claims and policies to maturity,  which
 reserves  shall  be  computed  [to  reflect  the present values, at five
 percent interest per annum, of the determined and estimated unpaid loss-
 es, and other requirements computed in accordance  with  such  rules  as
