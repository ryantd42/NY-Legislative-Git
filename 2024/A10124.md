 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  LEVENBERG  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Labor
 
 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to providing protections  for
  telecommunications tower technicians
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. Installation and maintenance  of  tele-
 communications equipment on towers is sensitive work that requires dili-
 gent  consideration  of  safety concerns. Tower climbing is an essential
 yet dangerous job - between 2003 and 2022, 166 workers in the cell tower
 industry died on the job - but there  are  few  regulations  and  safety
 standards in place.
  Additionally,  the existence of multi-layered employment structures in
 the industry can weaken employer accountability for ensuring safe condi-
 tions, impacting both workers and the public.
  The work tower technicians perform ensures New Yorkers have access  to
 reliable and convenient cell service that is essential to daily life, as
 well  as reliable 911 services. Many of these towers are state assets or
 on state-owned land. New York  state  has  a  proprietary  and  economic
 interest  in ensuring that its property is properly maintained and safe-
 guarded, that equipment installed on state property does not  cause  any
 undue risk to property or livelihood.
  §  2. The labor law is amended by adding a new article 21-B to read as
 follows:
  ARTICLE 21-B
  TOWER TECHNICIAN PROTECTIONS

  790-A. TOWER TECHNICIAN PROTECTIONS.
