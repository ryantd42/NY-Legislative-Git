  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Subdivisions 2, 5 and 6 of section 352-a of the education

 vacancy positions set aside for applicants  who  are  nominated  by  the
 governor,  a  state  senator  or  a member of the assembly. Such vacancy
 nominations shall increase or decrease based upon the number  of  senate
 districts  authorized  pursuant  to  article three of the New York state
 constitution. An applicant who receives such a nomination,  is  accepted
 for  admission  into  the  college  and  participates  in the regimental
 program shall receive a [tuition] scholarship equal to the amount of the
 state tuition charge [after the deduction of any  available  grant  aid]
 for  the  four consecutive years following his or her admission into the
 program  provided,  however,  that  the  student  remains  in  the
 regimental/cadet degree program and remains at all times in good academ-
 ic standing as determined by the maritime college administration.  In no
 event shall a student lose his or her scholarship based upon legislative
 reapportionment  or  changes  in  legislative composition or membership.
 Nothing herein shall be construed to  limit  or  reduce  the  number  of
 vacancies available to the general population.
  (b)  To  be eligible to receive such nomination and [tuition] scholar-
 ship, the applicant must be a resident of the  state.  For  purposes  of
 this  section,  a  state  resident  shall be defined as a person who has
