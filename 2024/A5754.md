 twenty-five years credited service for a member who joins the  New  York
 state  teachers'  retirement system on or after January first, two thou-
 sand ten,] shall be a retirement  allowance  equal  to  one-sixtieth  of
 final  average salary times years of credited service. Normal retirement
 age for members who first become members of a public  retirement  system
 of  the  state on or after April first, two thousand twelve shall be age

  b. The service retirement benefit  at  normal  retirement  age  for  a

 TY-FIVE per centum and one-fiftieth of final  average  salary  for  each

 years of credited service. Employees retiring pursuant to  this  section
 shall  receive  a  pension  allowance  equal to the sum of [thirty-five]

 of the provisions of this act shall be subject  to  section  25  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.-- Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would amend subdivisions a, b and b-1 of Section 604 of the
 Retirement and Social Security Law to provide Tier 5 and 6  members  the
 same  service  retirement  pension  factor as Tier 4. The Tier 4 service
 retirement pension factor for members with less than 20 years of service
 is equal to one-sixtieth of final average salary times years of service;
 for members with 20 or more years of service it is equal to  2.0%  times
 all  years  of service up to 30 years, plus 1.5% for each year above 30,
 times final average salary. The current Tier 5  pension  factor  is  the
 same as that of Tier 4, with the breakpoint being at 25 years of service
 instead  of 20. The current Tier 6 pension formula for members with less
 than 20 years of service is equal to one-sixtieth of final average sala-
 ry times years of service; for members with 20 or more years of  service
 A. 5754  3
 
 it is equal to 35.0% plus 2.0% for each year above 20, times final aver-
 age  salary.  For  Tier 6 members with more than 40 years of service the
 current Tier 6 pension formula is better than that of Tier 4  and  would
 remain in place.
  The  annual  cost  to  the  employers of members of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System for this benefit is estimated  to  be  $50.8
 million or 0.28% of payroll if this bill is enacted.
  The  System's "new entrant rate", a hypothetical employer contribution
 rate that would occur if we started a new Retirement System without  any
 assets, is equal to 5.15% of pay under the current Tier 6 benefit struc-
 ture.  This can be thought of as the long-term expected employer cost of
 Tier 6, based on current actuarial assumptions. For the proposed  change
 to  the  Tier 6 benefit structure under this bill, this new entrant rate
 would increase to 5.74% of pay, an increase of 0.59% of pay.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.

 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2023
