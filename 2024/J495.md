  COMMEMORATING  the  75th  Anniversary  of  Junius
  Volunteer Fire Department Inc.
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  commemorate  the
Anniversary  of  Junius  Volunteer Fire Department Inc. and to honor its
past and present firefighting members for 75 years of fire protection to
the citizens of Junius, New York, and its surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, This auspicious occasion will be celebrated at an event  on
Saturday, March 11, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  the night of March 8, 1948, a group of men were called
together for the purpose of creating a Fire Company; the 29 men  decided
to  form an independent fire company as it would be much easier and take
less time to establish; and
 
  WHEREAS, Five men were appointed to go to the Junius Town Board  and
get their approval to create the fire company, and the 29 men became the
first and charter members; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  March 15, 1948, the second meeting was called to order
with 37 members present and election of  officers  were  held;  at  that
time,  the  Town  Board  officially  voted  in  favor  of forming a Fire
Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, A two-bay fire station was built, and a 1328 pumper and  an
old International tanker were purchased; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently,  the  Junius  Volunteer  Fire  Department  is
comprised of 50 members who work out  of  two  fire  stations  with  two
pumpers, two tankers, and one heavy rescue truck; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection services in every locality of our State; during the  past  75
years,  the  courageous and devoted firefighters of the Junius Volunteer
Fire  Department  have  valiantly  responded  to  all  types  of  fire
emergencies  and  have won the praise and respect of the community which
they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a membership of dedicated firefighters, the record  of
the  Junius  Volunteer  Fire  Department  in  public  service  and  fire
protection is one to be envied; for 24 hours a day, for 365 days a year,
for 75 years, whenever the alarm sounded, these  noble  volunteers  left
their homes and went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave  firefighters  of  the  Junius  Volunteer  Fire
Department are prepared to risk their lives every day to help  save  the
lives  of  others and to protect homes and property from the destruction
caused by fire; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the skill and devoted  service  demonstrated
by  individual  firefighters,  the  Junius  Volunteer  Fire  Department
 
reflects the history and development of firefighting over  the  past  75
years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  we  should
give  special  recognition  to  those  who  work  so assiduously for the
betterment of their communities, and  acknowledge  publicly  the  heroic
good  works  performed  by  the volunteer fire departments of this great
Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly  commemorate  the  75th  Anniversary  of  Junius  Volunteer Fire
Department Inc.; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Junius Volunteer Fire Department Inc.
