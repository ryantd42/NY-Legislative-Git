BY: M. of A. Miller
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  Owens
  Family Farm of New Hartford, New York
 
  WHEREAS, The agricultural industry is part of  the  foundation  upon
which  our  distinct  American heritage is built; New York State and the
entire United States are dependent on our agricultural  industry  for  a
variety of food products; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize the
milestones of those farms which substantially contribute to the economic
vitality of their communities and the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of Owens Family Farm of New  Hartford,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1823,  Edmund  Newell  purchased  property  from David
Risley; the land was located on the southern end of what is  now  Oxford
Road,  and  in  1910,  the  farm  was  sold  to James Newell and Sanford
Sherman; a short while later in 1924, Sanford  Sherman  sold  the  land,
Buildings, and a house for $10,000 to Ellis and Margaret Owens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ellis  and  Margaret  farmed  and raised 7 children: John,
Robert, Hugh, Owen, Richard, Nettie, and Anne;  the  oldest  son,  John,
became  an  electrician  and was located on Campion Road in the village,
Richard had a milk route, Owen, Hugh, and Robert stayed on the home farm
until they married and purchased their own farms; and
 
  WHEREAS, When the three brothers operated the farm, it was known  as
Owens  Brothers  Farms; in 1952, Hugh and Owen purchased their own farms
and Robert and Julia remained on the "home" farm and  raised  their  two
sons, Richard and Larry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today, 100 years of this resilient farm will be celebrated
by Richard and Gail along with their son, Mark and his wife, Denise, who
have worked the farm all these years; these committed  individuals  have
proven  to  be  passionate workers who are imbued with immense pride and
strength, having overcome many changes and adversities over  the  years;
Mark  has  also built a home on the farm along with his brother; another
brother, Jeff, lives locally; and
 
  WHEREAS, This momentous occasion serves as a tribute to  the  entire
family  as  they  continue to use the land and further the distinguished
century-long history, keeping the farm in  the  same  family  throughout
this time; today, the grandchildren come to the farm and see the animals
and play on the hills among the wildflowers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize and
applaud the leaders  of  commerce  and  industry  whose  accomplishments
contribute  to  the economic health and prosperity of the communities of
the State of New York and to the quality of life of its people; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  the success of this exceptional farm and its contributions
to the local and State economies, fully confident that it will  continue
to  enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has experienced thus far; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorating the 100th Anniversary of Owens  Family  Farm;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Owens Family Farm.
