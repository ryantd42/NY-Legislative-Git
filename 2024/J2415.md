BY: Senator MAY
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 23-29, 2024, as Diaper Need Awareness Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Diaper Need, the  condition  of  not  having  a  sufficient
supply  of  clean diapers to ensure that infants and toddlers are clean,
healthy and dry, can adversely affect the health and welfare of infants,
toddlers and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  surveys  report  that  one  in  three  mothers
experience  diaper  need at some time while their children are less than
three years of age and forty-eight percent of families delay changing  a
diaper to extend their supply; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  average  infant  or toddler requires an average of 50
diaper changes per week over three years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Diapers cannot be bought with food stamps or WIC  vouchers,
and  a sufficient supply of diapers can cost as much as six percent of a
full-time minimum wage worker's salary, therefore obtaining a sufficient
supply of diapers can cause economic hardship to families; and
 
  WHEREAS, A supply of diapers is generally an eligibility requirement
for infants and  toddlers  to  participate  in  childcare  programs  and
quality early education programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  people  of  New York recognize that addressing Diaper
Need can  lead  to  economic  opportunity  for  the  state's  low-income
families  and  can  lead  to  improved  health  for  families  and their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  is  proud  to  be  home  to  various  community
organizations  including:  the  Central New York Diaper Bank, the Allied
Foundation of Melville, Good Plus Foundation of Manhattan, Every  Bottom
Covered  of  Buffalo,  the  Junior League of Central Westchester, Little
Essentials of Brooklyn, NYC Mammas Give Back of  Manhattan,  The  Junior
League  of  Rochester Diaper Bank, The Food Pantries of Albany, HopeLine
of the Bronx, Baby Steps  Baby  Pantry  at  Christ  Lutheran  Church  of
Newburgh, Catholic Charities-Archdiocese of New York Diaper Distribution
of  Manhattan,  Her Village Inc. of the Bronx, It takes a Village Diaper
Bank of Waterville, The Food Bank  of  the  Southern  Tier  Diaper  Bank
Program  of  Elmira,  Moms  for  Moms  of Manhattan, The Brooklyn Diaper
Project of Brooklyn and 914 Cares of White  Plains  that  recognize  the
importance of diapers in helping provide economic stability for families
and  distribute diapers to low-income families through various channels;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 23-29, 2024, as
Diaper Need Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
