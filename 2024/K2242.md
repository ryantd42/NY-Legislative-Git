  WHEREAS, Truly devoted to his community  and  never  forgetting  his
roots,  Don  B. Lee had a passion for community activism; throughout his
life, he advocated for the dignity and rights  of  Asian  Americans  and

  WHEREAS,  Delving  into  research  about  the  diets  of  Chinese

  WHEREAS,  Don  B. Lee's reach in helping the community is remarkable
and he worked endlessly to provide services and advocate for the  rights

leading rallies, to delivering hot meals to members during the  Covid-19
Pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  His  work  impacting  countless  families and individuals,

wide area of South Brooklyn; and

part of his life and rejoice in his achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals of such  outstanding  accomplishments  are  brought  to  our
attention,  they  should be recognized by all the citizens of this great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it

American community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
