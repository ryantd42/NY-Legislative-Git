Assembly Resolution No. 218
 
BY: M. of A. Barclay
 
  AMENDING  section  6  of  Rule  V  of the Assembly
  Rules, in relation to the length of debate on bills
 
  RESOLVED, That section 6 of Rule V of the Assembly Rules is  amended
to read as follows:
 
  §  6.  Debate.  a.  No member rising to debate, to give notice, make a
motion or report, or to present a petition or other paper, shall proceed
until such member shall have addressed the Speaker from his or her place
and has been recognized by the Speaker. While a member is  speaking,  no
member  shall entertain any private discourse or pass between the member
speaking and the Chair.
 
  b. Unless otherwise provided by these Rules, no  member  shall  speak,
except in his or her place, nor more than once on any bill or amendment,
without  leave  of  the  House  and  no member shall speak for more than
fifteen minutes except by consent of two-thirds of the members  present.
The  floor  leader  of  each  conference  or  his or her designee may be
granted a second, additional fifteen minutes to speak during the  debate
on  any  bill  or  amendment.  All  members  shall  be granted a second,
additional fifteen minutes to speak during the debate on any budget bill
or bill accompanied by a message of necessity. Consideration of any bill
and amendment, not including any budget bill or bill  accompanied  by  a
message  of  necessity,  shall  not  exceed  five hours; with four hours
allocated for debate and up to one hour allocated  for  explanations  of
vote;  provided,  however  that  a member desiring to explain his or her
vote upon the final  passage  of  a  bill  or  upon  the  passage  of  a
resolution  requiring  the  expenditure  of  money  may  make  a  brief
statement, not to exceed two minutes, in explanation of such  vote;  and
further  provided  that  in  addition to the foregoing, the sponsor of a
bill may make a statement not to exceed five minutes for the purpose  of
opening  debate  on  such  bill.  Except as otherwise provided by these
Rules for concurrent resolutions, no member shall speak more  than  once
and for no more than five minutes on any resolution without leave of the
House.  Debate  on  any  resolution,  except for resolutions amending or
suspending the Rules of the Assembly or as otherwise provided, shall  be
limited to thirty minutes. Members may be granted permission to submit a
written  statement  to  extend  upon  their remarks on the floor for the
record; such remarks must comply in all  respects  with  the  rules  and
customs  and practices of the House relating to debate to be included in
the record.
 
  c. If any member, in speaking, transgresses the Rules  of  the  House,
the  Speaker  may call such member to order, in which case the member so
called to order shall immediately sit down, and shall not rise unless to
explain or proceed in order.
 
  d. While the Speaker is putting a question,  or  a  roll  call  is  in
progress  or a count is being had, no member shall speak or leave his or
her place.  When the House shall be equally  divided  on  any  question,
including  the  Speaker's vote, the question shall be deemed to be lost.
All questions relating to the priority of one question or subject matter
over another, under the same order of business, shall be decided without
 
debate. If any question contains several distinct propositions, it shall
be divided by the Chair at the request of any member, but  a  motion  to
strike  out  and insert shall be indivisible. All questions of order, as
they  shall  occur,  with the decisions thereon, shall be entered in the
Journal, and, at the close of the  session,  a  statement  of  all  such
questions  and  decisions  shall  be  printed  at the close of and as an
appendix to the Journal.
