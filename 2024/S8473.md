 Introduced  by Sen. MARTINEZ -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the county law, the tax law and the Suffolk county water
  quality restoration act, in relation to the use  of  moneys  from  the
  water quality restoration fund
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 2 of part TT of chapter 58  of  the  laws  of  2023
 constituting  the  Suffolk  county  water  quality  restoration  act, is
 amended to read as follows:
  § 2. Legislative intent. The county  of  Suffolk  ("county"),  with  a
 population  of  one million five hundred thousand persons, has in excess
 of three hundred eighty thousand  existing  onsite  wastewater  disposal
 systems,  comprised  mostly  of  cesspools  and septic systems, with two
 hundred nine thousand of these onsite systems in environmentally  sensi-
 tive  areas which could benefit from nitrogen-reducing technologies. The
 United States Environmental Protection Agency recognizes Long Island  as
 having  a  sole  source  aquifer  system  for its drinking water supply.
 Suffolk county has an imminent need  to  preserve  this  valuable  water
 resource  by reducing the amount of nitrogen discharged into the ground-
 water by onsite systems. The full water cycle is impacted by  increasing
 quantities of nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, volatile organic contam-
 inants  and saltwater intrusion, as well as a number of emerging threats
 such as prescription drugs and sea level rise.
  The Suffolk county subwatersheds wastewater plan ("SWP"), certified by
 the  department  of  environmental  conservation  as  a  Nine  Elements
 Watershed  (9E)  plan,  has  documented  the devastating effects of high
 levels of nitrogen pollution, not only on the  drinking  water  quality,
 but  also  on  coastal  ecosystems,  dissolved  oxygen,  water  clarity,
 eelgrass, wetlands, shellfish,  coastal  resilience  and  in  triggering
 harmful  algal  blooms.  The SWP is a long-term plan to address the need
 for wastewater treatment infrastructure throughout the county comprehen-
 sively over a period of fifty years. The SWP delineates the  source  and
 concentration  of  nitrogen  loading  in  one hundred ninety-one subwat-

 ersheds throughout the county, and establishes nitrogen reduction  goals
 for each watershed.
  For many areas of the county, installing or connecting sewers is not a
 practical  or  cost-effective  method  of  treating wastewater. For that
 reason, the SWP prescribes a hybrid approach  that  relies  on  sewering
 where feasible, and the replacement of cesspools and septic systems with
 innovative/alternative  onsite wastewater treatment systems. The consol-
 idation of any or all of the twenty-seven  county  sewer  districts,  as
 well  as  unsewered  areas  of the county, into a county-wide wastewater
 management district, the establishment of a  water  quality  restoration
 fund,  and  a county board of trustees to monitor progress and the allo-
 cation of resources consistent with the goals of the SWP would allow for
 the implementation of a  much  needed  integrated  long-term  wastewater
 solution for the county through comprehensive planning and management to
 improve water quality.
  The  purpose of this act is to create a water quality restoration fund
 to finance projects for the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation
 of groundwater and surface waters as recommended by the  SWP.  This  act
 would allow the funding of projects that will mitigate wastewater pollu-
 tants  utilizing  the best available technology consistent with the SWP.
 The water quality restoration fund would be financed  with  a  dedicated
 and recurring revenue source by the enactment of an additional sales and
 compensating  use  tax  at  the  rate of one-eighth of one percent until
 2060. AFTER DEDUCTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND PLANNING COSTS,  FIFTY  PERCENT
 OF  THE  REVENUE  SHALL BE DEDICATED TO FUNDING INDIVIDUAL SEPTIC SYSTEM
 PROJECTS AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE REVENUE SHALL BE DEDICATED TO  FUNDING
 PROJECTS  RELATED  TO WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES. Such tax would be
 enacted pursuant to a mandatory referendum.
  This act shall also provide  Suffolk  county  with  the  authority  to
 create  a county-wide wastewater management district through the consol-
 idation of existing county  sewer  districts  with  currently  unsewered
 areas  of  the county. A county-wide wastewater management district will
 provide an integrated and  efficient  approach  to  managing  wastewater
 services  across  the county; allow the county to enhance and expand its
 incentive program to property owners to upgrade their wastewater  treat-
 ment systems; to manage, monitor and enforce nitrogen reduction programs
 throughout  the  county;  complete  additional sewer extension projects;
 improve the economic wellbeing of communities; and provide  an  opportu-
 nity  to consolidate and streamline the county's existing sewer district
 system and normalize  the  inequitable  rate  structure  that  has  long
 existed.
  In  addition,  this  act  will  extend the existing one-quarter of one
 percent  sales  tax  utilized  to  finance  the  county  drinking  water
 protection program until 2060. TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF SUCH TAX IS APPOR-
 TIONED  FOR  SEWER TAXPAYER PROTECTION.  BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST FISCAL
 YEAR AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE WATER QUALITY RESTORATION FUND, A PORTION
 OF THE NET COLLECTIONS  OF  SUCH  TAX  APPORTIONED  FOR  SEWER  TAXPAYER
 PROTECTION  SHALL  BE TRANSFERRED TO THE WATER QUALITY RESTORATION FUND,
 ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION 11 OF SECTION 256-B  OF  THE  COUNTY
 LAW.  SUCH  REVENUES  SHALL  BE  DEDICATED  SOLELY TO FUNDING INDIVIDUAL
 SEPTIC SYSTEM PROJECTS AS DEFINED IN SUCH SUBDIVISION.  IN  THE  FIRST
 FOUR  YEARS,  THE  PORTION  TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM FUNDS APPORTIONED FOR
 SEWER TAXPAYER PROTECTION TO THE WATER QUALITY RESTORATION FUND SHALL BE
 FIVE PERCENT. IN YEAR FIVE, THE PORTION TO  BE  TRANSFERRED  FROM  FUNDS
 APPORTIONED FOR SEWER TAX PAYER PROTECTION TO THE WATER QUALITY RESTORA-
 TION  FUND  SHALL BE TWENTY PERCENT.  THE AMOUNT TO BE TRANSFERRED SHALL
 S. 8473  3
 
 BE THIRTY PERCENT IN YEAR  SIX,  FORTY  PERCENT  IN  YEAR  SEVEN,  FIFTY
 PERCENT  IN  YEAR EIGHT, AND SEVENTY PERCENT IN YEARS NINE AND TEN.  THE
 PORTION TRANSFERRED TO THE FUND SHALL BE  FIFTY  PERCENT  IN  ALL  YEARS
 THEREAFTER.
  §  2.  Subdivision  11 of section 256-b of the county law, as added by
 section 3 of part TT of chapter 58 of the laws of 2023,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  11.  Water quality restoration fund. (a) Notwithstanding any provision
 of law to the contrary, the county of  Suffolk  shall  deposit  the  net
 collections  from  the  sales  and  compensating  use  tax authorized by
 section one thousand two hundred ten-F of the tax law into  the  Suffolk
 county  water  quality restoration fund established in accordance there-
 with, and shall utilize all monies transferred from the fund  consistent
 with this section.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed
 to  prevent  the  financing  in  whole or in part, pursuant to the local
 finance law, of any project authorized pursuant to this section.  Monies
 from  the  fund may be utilized to repay any indebtedness or obligations
 incurred pursuant to the local finance law consistent with  effectuating
 the  purposes of this section.  Where Suffolk county finances a project,
 in whole, or in part, pursuant to the local finance law, the  resolution
 authorizing  such indebtedness shall be accompanied by a report from the
 county executive demonstrating how said indebtedness will be  repaid  by
 the fund. Said report shall include an estimate of projected revenues of
 the  fund  during  the  period  of  indebtedness.  The report shall also
 provide an accounting of all other  indebtedness  incurred  against  the
 fund  to  be  repaid  for the same period.  The county legislature shall
 make findings by resolution that there will  be  sufficient  revenue  to
 repay such indebtedness in its entirety from the fund before authorizing
 such  indebtedness.  Monies  in  said  fund  may be appropriated from or
 expended in any fiscal year to implement the powers set  forth  in  this
 section  and  to repay any indebtedness or obligations incurred pursuant
 to the local finance law for the purposes authorized  pursuant  to  this
 section.
  (b) (i) Water quality improvement projects shall be eligible for fund-
 ing  pursuant  to  this  section.  For purposes of this section, "water
 quality improvement projects" shall  mean:  (A)  the  planning,  design,
 construction,  acquisition,  enlargement,  extension, or alteration of a
 county, town or village wastewater treatment facility,  including  indi-
 vidual hookups, AND PROJECTS FOR THE REUSE OF TREATED EFFLUENT FROM SUCH
 WASTEWATER  TREATMENT  FACILITIES,  or  (B) an individual septic system,
 including an alternative wastewater treatment facility or an  individual
 septic  system  with  active treatment, to treat, neutralize, stabilize,
 eliminate or partially eliminate sewage or reduce pollutants,  including
 permanent  or  pilot  demonstration  wastewater  treatment  projects, or
 equipment or furnishings thereof.  In the  case  of  individual  septic
 system  projects,  the  funding of the operation and maintenance of such
 projects shall be included in the definition of "water quality  improve-
 ment  projects".  Such projects shall have as their purpose the remedi-
 ation of existing water quality to meet specific water quality standards
 consistent with the SWP. Projects consistent with or listed in  the  SWP
 that are part of a plan adopted by a local government resulting in a net
 nitrogen  reduction  shall be eligible for consideration by the board of
 trustees, established in accordance with subparagraph (i)  of  paragraph
 (c) of this subdivision.

 ry, the net collections from the tax imposed pursuant to subdivision (a)
 of  this  section  for  the  period  beginning  December first, nineteen
 hundred eighty-eight and ending November thirtieth, two  thousand  sixty
 shall,  upon payment to the county of Suffolk, be deposited in a special
 fund, to be designated as a drinking water protection reserve  fund,  to
 be  created  by  said  county therefor separate and apart from any other
 funds and accounts of the county. Moneys in such fund shall be deposited
 in one or more of the banks or trust companies designated, in the manner
 provided by law, as a depository of the funds of  such  county.  Pending
 expenditure from such fund, moneys therein may be invested in the manner
 provided  in  section  eleven of the general municipal law. Any interest
 earned or capital gain realized on the moneys so deposited  or  invested
 shall accrue to and become part of such fund. Moneys in said fund may be
 appropriated from and transferred to or expended in any fiscal year only
 for the purposes of making payments pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c)
 of  this  section  for  the  period  beginning  December first, nineteen
 hundred eighty-eight, to the extent that moneys in said fund are remain-
 ing, and if authorized by local law, for the following purposes:
  (i) for the purposes of specific environmental protection (acquisition
 of: farmland development rights; open space, wetlands,  woodlands,  pine
 barrens  and other lands for passive recreational uses; lands for hamlet
 greens, hamlet parks, pocket parks, historic parks, cultural  parks  and
 other  lands  for active/parkland recreational uses; lands necessary for
 maintaining and protecting the quality of surface water, groundwater and
 coastal resources);

 purposes described in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this subdivision. For the
 purpose of allocating moneys in said fund pursuant to  local  law  among
 the  purposes  described in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this
 subdivision, moneys applied to the payment of  debt  service  under  the
 authority of the previous sentence shall be considered by said county to
 have  been  expended  for  the  purposes for which such indebtedness was
 incurred.
  § 4. After January 1, 2030, the Suffolk county executive shall prepare
 a report to be submitted to the governor  and  the  legislature.  Such
 report  shall  make  recommendations regarding any modifications to this
 act, if any, with regard to the future distribution of revenue for water
 quality improvement projects based upon the future  demand  for  funding
 for wastewater treatment projects and individual septic system projects.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
