  CONGRATULATING  Honorary Chief Colin Kaletsky upon
  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition  after  50 years of dedicated service to
  the  Mineola  Volunteer  Fire  Department's  Engine
  Company No. 1, on May 16, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Firefighters  exemplify  the power of human compassion and
the strength of the American spirit through actions of the  most  heroic
magnitude;  their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  congratulate
Honorary  Chief  Colin Kaletsky upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to  the  Mineola
Volunteer  Fire Department's Engine Company No. 1, to be recognized at a
50th Anniversary Celebration on Thursday, May 16, 2024, at Stewart Manor
Country Club in Stewart Manor, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Colin Kaletsky joined Engine Company No. 1 of  the  Mineola
Volunteer Fire Department in March of 1974, going on to serve in various
capacities  within  the  department,  including: Chairman of the Picture
Committee; Chairman of the Grave Marking Committee; Secretary, Financial
Secretary, Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant, and Captain of the  same
Company; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials, and deserve just commendation by all citizens of
this State and Nation for whom they serve to protect; and
 
  WHEREAS, With him throughout have been his beloved wife, Rhonda, and
cherished  son, Andrew, both of whom feel privileged to be a part of his
life and rejoice in his many achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others,  and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Honorary  Captain  Colin  Kaletsky  is  one such firefighter; throughout
years of devoted service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
fire protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  Honorary  Chief  Colin  Kaletsky  upon the occasion of his
designation for special recognition after 50 years of dedicated  service
to  the Mineola Volunteer Fire Department's Engine Company No. 1, on May
16, 2024; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a copy of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Honorary Chief Colin Kaletsky.
