  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those fraternal organizations of high purpose and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Sutherland Lodge No. 826 Free and Accepted Masons  of  North  Tonawanda,
New  York,  upon  the  occasion  of celebrating its 125th Anniversary on
Saturday, June 8, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Free  and  Accepted  Masons  is  the  oldest  fraternal
organization  in  the world, dating back 3,000 years or more; Sutherland
Lodge No. 826 has been successful, throughout its 125-year history, as a
significant influence  in  the  community  by  providing  leadership,  a
principled  way  of  life  that  is deeply rooted in a system of values,
social benevolence, emphasis on individual excellence, and  its  service
as a stabilizing force in the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  late  1890s, a group of prominent North Tonawanda
Masons, most of whom were members of the Tonawanda Lodge No. 247, formed
a Lodge in North Tonawanda; on  June  30,  1898,  the  Grand  Lodge  was
petitioned  for  a  Charter  to establish the Master Builders Lodge, and
dispensation was granted; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 7, 1899, M. W. William A. Sutherland, Grand  Master
of  Masons  in  the  State  of  New  York,  granted  the  Charter  which
established Sutherland Lodge No. 826, customarily taking the  last  name
of the Grand Master during whose term the Lodge was formed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Seeking their own location, the Members of Sutherland Lodge
No.  826 convened their meetings at several places until 1970 when the
donations of several members' wills provided the funding to  purchase  a
building and renovate it, creating the Lodge's permanent home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sutherland  Lodge  No.  826  has been successful under the
leadership of numerous dedicated officers and members,  attracting  many
community  leaders  and  businessmen; since its inception, the Lodge has
had 20 members receive Grand Lodge appointments, 10 of whom attained the
title District Deputy Grand Master; many members have  chosen  paths  in
politics, becoming mayors and councilmen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sutherland  Lodge  No.  826,  under  the  careful watch of
Worshipful Master Reverend Kanjin Cederman, proudly  sponsors  Starlight
Constellation  of  Junior  Stars,  State  of  New York, a not-for-profit
Masonic Affiliated Youth Organization for young women, between the  ages
of 10 and 21, teaching them many life skills; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Additionally,  Sutherland  Lodge  No.  826  provides
scholarships for local  high  school  students  and  donations  to  many
charities within the community through annual fundraisers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  principles  of  freemasonry  compel  these  dedicated
members  of  Sutherland  Lodge  No.  826  to  dispense  charity  while
maintaining  integrity  and honesty in their communities; belief in God,
family, and community are the core values of  their  organization;  they
continue  honorable  and  charitable  work,  sustaining the tradition of
perpetuating the mason's belief that each man is responsible for  making
the world a better place; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  time  to  time,  this Legislative Body takes note of
certain altruistic organizations it  wishes  to  acknowledge  for  their
philanthropic  and community-oriented contributions to our society which
enhance the basic humanity among all the citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to honor and commend
the members of Sutherland Lodge No. 826,  past  and  present,  who  have
labored so conscientiously to secure and improve the quality of life for
the community they serve; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Sutherland Lodge  No.  826  Free  and  Accepted  Masons  of  North
Tonawanda,  New  York,  upon  the  occasion  of  celebrating  its  125th
Anniversary; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
