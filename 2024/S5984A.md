  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subparagraph  (ii)  of  paragraph (e) of subdivision 3 of
 section 8-302 of the election law, as amended by chapter 113 of the laws
 of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  (ii) They may swear to and subscribe an affidavit  stating  that  they
 have duly registered to vote, the address in such election district from
 which  they  registered, that they remain a duly qualified voter in such
 election district, that their registration poll  record  appears  to  be
 lost  or misplaced or that their name and/or their signature was omitted
 from the computer generated registration list or such  record  indicates
 the  voter already voted when they did not do so or that they have moved
 within New York state since they last registered, the address from which
 they were previously registered and the address at which they  currently
 reside, and at a primary election, the party in which they are enrolled,
 OR THAT SUCH VOTER IS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE PURSUANT TO SECTION 8-604 OF THIS
 ARTICLE.  The  inspectors of election shall offer such an affidavit to
 each such voter whose residence address is in  such  election  district.
 Each  such affidavit shall be in a form prescribed by the state board of
 elections, shall be printed on an envelope of the size and quality  used
 for  an  absentee  ballot  envelope, and shall contain an acknowledgment
 that the affiant understands that any false statement  made  therein  is
 perjury  punishable  according to law. Such form prescribed by the state
 board of elections shall request information required to  register  such

 voter  should  the  county  board  determine  that such voter is not yet
 registered and shall constitute an application to register to vote.  The
 voter's  name  and  the  entries  required shall then be entered without
 delay and without further inquiry in the fourth section of the challenge
 report  or  in the place provided in the computer generated registration
 list, with the notation  that  the  voter  has  executed  the  affidavit
 hereinabove prescribed, or, if such person's name appears in such regis-
 tration  list,  the  board of elections may provide a place to make such
 entry next to their name in such list. The  voter  shall  then,  without
 further  inquiry,  be permitted to vote an affidavit ballot provided for
 by this chapter.  Such ballot shall thereupon be placed in the  envelope
 containing  their affidavit, and the envelope sealed and returned to the
 board of elections in the manner provided by this chapter for  protested
 official  ballots,  including a statement of the number of such ballots.
 IF A VOTER REGISTRATION APPLICATION FOR A VOTER WHO CASTS  AN  AFFIDAVIT
 BALLOT  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SUBPARAGRAPH  WAS  RECEIVED  BY  A  BOARD OF
 ELECTIONS BY THE TENTH DAY PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, THE BOARD  SHALL  CAST
 AND  COUNT  AN  AFFIDAVIT  BALLOT  FROM  SUCH VOTER, IF OTHERWISE VALID,
 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE VOTER'S NAME WAS OMITTED FROM A REGIS-
 TRATION POLL RECORD OR LIST OF REGISTERED VOTERS.
  § 2. The election law is amended by adding a new section 8-604 to read
 as follows:
  § 8-604. REGISTRATION DURING EARLY VOTING. 1.  IN ADDITION  TO  OTHER
 METHODS  OF VOTER REGISTRATION PROVIDED UNDER THIS CHAPTER, A PERSON WHO
 IS NOT REGISTERED TO VOTE IN THE STATE BUT  IS  OTHERWISE  QUALIFIED  TO
 REGISTER TO VOTE AND TO CAST A BALLOT MAY REGISTER TO VOTE AND ENROLL IN
 A  POLITICAL  PARTY  AT  AN EARLY VOTING POLLING LOCATION, PROVIDED SUCH
 REGISTRATION IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VOTER REGISTRATION  DEADLINE  SET
 FORTH IN SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION 5-210 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  2.  A  QUALIFIED PERSON WHO IS NOT REGISTERED TO VOTE IN THE STATE WHO
 APPEARS AT AN EARLY VOTING POLLING PLACE SHALL BE OFFERED  THE  OPPORTU-
 NITY  TO  REGISTER TO VOTE AND ENROLL IN A POLITICAL PARTY AND SHALL BE
 GIVEN AN AFFIDAVIT BALLOT, PROVIDED SUCH REGISTRATION IS  IN  ACCORDANCE
 WITH  THE  VOTER REGISTRATION DEADLINE SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION THREE OF
 SECTION 5-210 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  3. IF SUCH REGISTRATION IS DEEMED EFFECTIVE, THE  BOARD  OF  ELECTIONS
 SHALL  ADD  THE PERSON'S VOTER REGISTRATION INFORMATION TO THE STATEWIDE
 ELECTRONIC VOTER FILE AND INCLUDE THE CORRESPONDING AFFIDAVIT BALLOT  IN
 THE OFFICIAL CANVASS, IF OTHERWISE VALID.
  4.  THE  BOARD  OF ELECTIONS SHALL CONDUCT THE RECEIPT AND HANDLING OF
 EACH VOTER REGISTRATION  AND  CORRESPONDING  BALLOT  IN  A  MANNER  THAT
 PROTECTS  THE SECRECY OF THE BALLOT AND ALLOWS THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL TO
 PROCESS THE REGISTRATION AND INCLUDE THE  CORRESPONDING  BALLOT  IN  THE
 OFFICIAL CANVASS, IF OTHERWISE VALID.
  5.  THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS SHALL ADVISE A PERSON COMPLETING SUCH VOTER
 REGISTRATION OF THE PROCEDURES FOR  DETERMINING  THE  VALIDITY  OF  SUCH
 VOTER REGISTRATION.
  6. THE STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS SHALL PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS
 TO IMPLEMENT THIS SECTION.
  §  3.  The  opening paragraph of section 9-209 of the election law, as
 added by chapter 763 of the laws of 2021, is amended to read as follows:
  Before completing the canvass of votes cast in any  primary,  general,
 special,  or  other  election at which voters are required to sign their
 registration poll records before voting, the board  of  elections  shall
 proceed in the manner hereinafter prescribed to review, cast and canvass
 any  absentee,  military, special presidential, special federal or other
 S. 5984--A  3
 
 special ballots and any ballots cast in affidavit  envelopes,  INCLUDING
 BALLOTS  CAST  BY VOTERS PURSUANT TO SECTION 8-604 OF THIS CHAPTER. Each
 such ballot shall be retained in the original  envelope  containing  the
 voter's  affidavit  and signature, in which it is delivered to the board
 of elections until such time as it is to be reviewed,  in  order  to  be
 cast and canvassed.
  §  4.  Subdivision 7 of section 9-209 of the election law, as added by
 chapter 763 of the laws of 2021, paragraph (d) as amended by chapter 661
 of the laws of 2022, and paragraph (h) as amended by chapter 113 of  the
 laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  7. Post-election review and canvassing of affidavit ballots. (a) With-
 in  four  business  days  of  the election, the board of elections shall
 review all affidavit ballots cast in the election. If the central  board
 of  canvassers  determines  that  a  person was entitled to vote at such
 election it shall cast and  canvass  such  affidavit  ballot;  provided,
 however,  if the board of elections receives one or more timely absentee
 ballots from a voter who also cast an affidavit ballot at a  poll  site,
 the last such timely absentee ballot received shall be canvassed and the
 affidavit ballot shall be set aside unopened; and provided further, if a
 voter was issued an absentee ballot and votes in person via an affidavit
 ballot  and the board does not receive such absentee ballot, the affida-
 vit ballot shall be canvassed if the voter  is  otherwise  qualified  to
 vote in such election.
  (b)  Affidavit ballots are valid when cast at a polling site permitted
 by law by qualified voters: (i) who moved within the state after  regis-
 tering;  (ii)  who  are in inactive status; (iii) whose registration was
 incorrectly transferred to another address  even  though  they  did  not
 move;  (iv)  whose  registration poll records were missing on the day of
 such election; (v) who have not had their identity previously  verified;
 (vi) whose registration poll records did not show them to be enrolled in
 the  party  in  which they are enrolled; [and] (vii) who are incorrectly
 identified as having already voted; AND (VIII) WHO  HAVE  REGISTERED  TO
 VOTE PURSUANT TO SECTION 8-604 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  (c)  Affidavit  ballots are valid to the extent that ministerial error
 by the board of elections or any of its  employees  caused  such  ballot
 envelope not to be valid on its face.
  (d)  If  the  central board of canvassers determines that a person was
 entitled to vote at such election, the board shall cast and canvass such
 affidavit ballot if such board finds that the voter appeared at a  poll-
 ing place, in the correct county, which is designated as a polling place
 for the correct assembly district, regardless of the fact that the voter
 may  have  appeared in the incorrect election district or polling place,
 and regardless of whether the voter's name was in the registration  poll
 record; provided, however, that in the event such ballot includes one or
 more  offices  for  which  such  person  is not entitled to vote at such
 election, such ballot shall only be cast and canvassed for  the  offices
 for which such person is entitled to vote at such election.
  (e)  If the central board of canvassers finds that a voter submitted a
 voter registration application through the electronic voter registration
 transmittal system pursuant to title eight of article five of this chap-
 ter and signed the affidavit ballot, the board shall  cast  and  canvass
 such  affidavit  ballot  if  the voter is otherwise qualified to vote in
 such election.
  (f) If the central board of canvassers determines that  a  person  was
 entitled to vote at such election, the board shall cast and canvass such
 affidavit  ballot  if  such  board  finds  that  the voter substantially
 S. 5984--A  4
 
 complied with the requirements of this chapter.  For  purposes  of  this
 paragraph,  "substantially  complied" shall mean the board can determine
 the voter's eligibility based on the statement of the affiant or records
 of the board.
  (g)  If the central board of canvassers finds that the statewide voter
 registration list supplies sufficient information to identify  a  voter,
 failure  by  the  voter  to include on the affidavit ballot envelope the
 address where such voter was previously registered shall not be a  fatal
 defect and the board shall cast and canvass such affidavit ballot.
  (h)  (I) IF A VOTER REGISTRATION APPLICATION FOR A PERSON WAS RECEIVED
 BY A BOARD OF ELECTIONS BY THE TENTH DAY PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, AN AFFI-
 DAVIT BALLOT FROM THE PERSON SHALL BE CAST AND COUNTED IF THE  VOTER  IS
 OTHERWISE  QUALIFIED  TO VOTE IN SUCH ELECTION, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT
 THAT THE PERSON'S NAME WAS OMITTED FROM A REGISTRATION  POLL  RECORD  OR
 LIST OF REGISTERED VOTERS.
  (II)  If  the  central board of canvassers finds that the voter regis-
 tered or pre-registered to vote for the first  time  pursuant  to  title
 nine of article five of this chapter at least ten days before a primary,
 appeared at such primary election, and indicated on the affidavit ballot
 envelope  the intent to enroll in such party, the affidavit ballot shall
 be cast and canvassed if the voter is otherwise  qualified  to  vote  in
 such election.
  (i)  A VOTER REGISTRATION SUBMITTED BY A PERSON REGISTERING TO VOTE AT
 AN EARLY VOTING POLLING LOCATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 8-604 OF THIS CHAP-
 TER SHALL BE PROCESSED AND AN AFFIDAVIT BALLOT FROM SUCH PERSON SHALL BE
 CAST AND CANVASSED IF THE VOTER IS OTHERWISE QUALIFIED TO VOTE  IN  SUCH
 ELECTION,  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  FACT THAT THE PERSON'S NAME IS NOT ON A
 REGISTRATION POLL RECORD OR LIST OF REGISTERED VOTERS.
  (J) When the central board of canvassers determines that an  affidavit
 ballot  is  invalid  due  to a missing signature on the affidavit ballot
 envelope, or because the signature on the affidavit ballot envelope does
 not correspond to the registration  signature,  such  ballots  shall  be
 subject to the cure procedure in subdivision three of this section.  THE
 ABSENCE  OF A SIGNATURE ON A REGISTRATION POLL RECORD OR COMPUTER GENER-
 ATED LIST OF REGISTERED VOTERS SHALL NOT PROVIDE A BASIS  FOR  REJECTING
 AFFIDAVIT BALLOTS SUBMITTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 8-604 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  [(j)]  (K) At the meeting required pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdi-
 vision eight of this section, each candidate, political party, and inde-
 pendent body shall be entitled to object  to  the  board  of  elections'
 determination  that  an  affidavit ballot is invalid. Such ballots shall
 not be counted absent an order of the court. In no  event  may  a  court
 order a ballot that has been counted to be uncounted.
  [(k)]  (L)  The  board  of  elections shall enter information into the
 ballot tracking system, as defined in section 8-414 of this chapter,  to
 allow a voter who cast a ballot in an affidavit envelope to determine if
 the vote was counted.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
