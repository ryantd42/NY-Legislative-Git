 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  mandatory retirement age
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subparagraph (f) of paragraph 1 and the  opening  paragraph
 of  subparagraph  (g) of paragraph 2 of subdivision e and subdivisions h
 and k of section 384 of the  retirement  and  social  security  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  1043  of  the laws of 1968, are amended to read as
 follows:
  (f) Upon  completion  of  twenty-five  years  service,  an  additional
 pension,  if  required, of such amount as shall be necessary to increase
 the total amount of the benefits provided  herein  to  one-half  of  his
 final  average  salary.  The  pension  provided  by this [sub-paragraph]
 SUBPARAGRAPH shall be payable only if a member retires from  service  on

 SUBPARAGRAPH, his service shall be terminated and he shall retire on  or
 before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven. For the
 purpose only of determining the amount of the pension provided  in  this
 paragraph,  the  annuity shall be computed as it would be if it were not
 reduced by the actuarial equivalent of any outstanding loan, and  if  it
 were  not  increased  by  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  any additional
 contributions, and if it were not reduced  by  reason  of  the  member's

 election  to decrease his annuity contributions to the retirement system
 in order to apply the  amount  of  such  reduction  in  payment  of  his
 contributions for old-age and survivors insurance coverage.
  Upon  completion  of twenty-five years service, an additional pension,
 if required, of such amount as shall be necessary to increase the  total
 amount  of the benefits provided herein to one-half of his final average

 of  any  member who attained the age of [sixty-two] SIXTY-FIVE before or
 within one month after his employer first elected to assume all or  part
 of the additional cost of service as provided by paragraph two of subdi-

 SECTION. Any officer or member who elects to receive such benefits shall
 be  separated  from  service on the first day of the calendar month next

 tional  pension  credit under subdivision f of this section, his service
 shall be terminated and he shall be retired within  three  months  after
 his employer assumes the additional cost therefor or on or before Decem-
 ber  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight, whichever shall last

 five; a member who is a chief or commanding officer of a police  depart-
 ment  or  police  force, who attained age sixty-five before his employer

 of total creditable service, shall retire on or before December  thirty-
 first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight,  or  within  one  year after his
 employer assumes the additional  cost  therefor,  whichever  shall  last
 occur.
  k.  Any  officer or member of such organized fire department or organ-
 ized police force or department, may, within one year after  he  becomes
 such officer or member or within one year after his employer assumes the
 additional  cost  therefor, whichever shall last occur, elect to receive
 the additional benefits provided for by subdivision i [hereof]  OF  THIS
 SECTION. Any officer or member who elects to receive such benefits shall
 be  separated  from  service on the first day of the calendar month next

 employer assumes the additional cost therefor, to be eligible for  addi-
 tional  pension  credit under subdivision i of this section, his service
 shall  be  terminated  and he shall be retired within three months after
 his employer assumes the additional  cost  therefor,  or  on  or  before
 December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight, whichever shall
 last occur, and provided further  that  a  member  who  is  a  chief  or
 commanding  officer  of a police department or police force shall retire
 on the first day of the calendar month next succeeding his attainment of
 age sixty-five; a member who is a  chief  or  commanding  officer  of  a
 police  department  or  police force, who attained age sixty-five before
 his employer elected to provide this  added  benefit  and  has  rendered
 twenty-five years of total creditable service, shall retire on or before
 December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, or within one year
 after his employer assumes the additional cost therefor, whichever shall
 last occur.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would increase the mandatory retirement age from  62  to  65
 for  members  of the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement
 System (NYSLPFRS) covered under the provisions of  section  384  of  the
 Retirement and Social Security Law.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, there
 would be additional benefits for certain  members  who  remain  employed
 beyond  age  62  which  would  be funded by the normal employer contrib-
 utions. If members delay retirement due to the enactment of  this  bill,
 we  do not anticipate any increases in the annual contribution rates for
 any of the participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
