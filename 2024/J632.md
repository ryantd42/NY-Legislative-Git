  LEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION  celebrating  Vaisakhi,  a
  historical and religious festival  in  Hinduism  and
  Sikhism on April 14, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  those
events  which  foster  ethnic  pride and enhance the profile of cultural
diversity which strengthens the fabric of the communities  of  New  York
State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
celebrate  Vaisakhi, a historical and religious festival in Hinduism and
Sikhism on April 14, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Celebrated on the 13th or 14th of April each year, Vaisakhi
commemorates the formation of Khalsa Panth of warriors under Guru Gobind
Singh, the last living Guru of Sikhism, in 1699; this group of  warriors
was charged with protecting religious freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, Originated as a harvest festival, Vaisakhi is recognized as
the  beginning  of  the Sikh New Year, and for the year when Sikhism was
born  as  a  collective  faith;  it  also  highlights  respect  for  the
personality traits of dedication and self-sacrifice; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On this holiday, Sikhs from across the globe celebrate all
day, whether it is singing, performing a traditional folk dance known as
the Bangrha, watching  a  special  procession  known  as  Nagar  Kirtan,
visiting decorated Gudwaras, or being baptized into the Khalsa; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Revelers  also  follow  the  tradition  of  langar,  where
everyone in the community, no matter how rich or poor, come together  to
share a free meal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Vaisakhi  was  also  the  day when colonial British empire
officials committed the Jallianwala Bagh massacre  at  a  gathering,  an
event influential to the Indian movement against colonial rule; and
 
  WHEREAS, In Hinduism, Vaisakhi celebrates the start of the solar new
year,  based  on  the  Vikram  Samvat  calendar; many Hindus observe the
spring harvest festival through activities such as visiting temples  and
friends,  and bathing in sacred rivers which include the Ganges, Jhelum,
and Kaveri; and
 
  WHEREAS, Vaisakhi is fundamentally about community, celebration, and
progress, and these values  are  at  the  forefront  of  the  collective
consciousness as Sikhs gather together to mark the occasion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the intent of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend events which  symbolize  the  historical,  social  and  cultural
development  of this great State and embody the spirit of the principles
upon which this Nation was founded; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
celebrate  Vaisakhi, a historical and religious festival in Hinduism and
Sikhism.
