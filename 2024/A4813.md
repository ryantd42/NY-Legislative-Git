 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  PRETLOW,  HAWLEY,  DiPIETRO -- read once and
  referred to the Committee on Racing and Wagering
 
 AN ACT to amend the general municipal law,  in  relation  to  electronic
  bell jar games
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1.  Legislative findings and purpose. 1. The legislature here-
 by finds that:
  (a) bell jar games are a popular and profitable fundraising  mechanism
 for  bona fide not-for-profit organizations across the state, generating
 millions of dollars in net revenues for charitable purposes every year;
  (b) authorized organizations that offer bell jars and other  games  of
 chance  must  meet  strict  standards  established by the New York state
 general municipal law and the New York state gaming commission,  includ-
 ing receiving a license to conduct charitable gaming activities; and
  (c)  while  other  types of gaming in New York state have continued to
 expand and improve, the operation of charitable  gaming  activities  has
 largely remained the same over the last several decades.
  2.  For  the  aforementioned  reasons, the legislature hereby declares
 that authorized organizations licensed by  the  New  York  state  gaming
 commission  to  conduct charitable gaming would greatly benefit from the
 ability to operate electronic bell jar vending machines,  which  display
 and  dispense  pre-printed  bell  jar  tickets  that  have predetermined
 winners and predetermined values for prizes, in order to  help  increase
 charitable  gaming  profits across the state and attract more members to
 join such organizations.
  § 2. Subdivision 3-a of section 186 of the general municipal  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  531  of  the  laws  of 2011, is amended to read as
 follows:
  3-a. "Bell jars" shall mean and include those games in which a partic-
 ipant shall draw a card from a jar, vending machine, INCLUDING AN  ELEC-
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 TRONIC  BELL  JAR VENDING MACHINE, or other suitable device or container
 which contains numbers, colors or symbols that are  covered  and  which,
 when uncovered, may reveal that a prize shall be awarded on the basis of
 a  designated winning number, color or symbol or combination of numbers,
 colors or symbols. Bell jars shall also include seal cards, coin boards,
 event games, and merchandise boards.  AN  ELECTRONIC  BELL  JAR  VENDING
 MACHINE SHALL USE ELECTRONIC FEATURES TO DISPLAY AND DISPENSE PRE-PRINT-
 ED  BELL  JAR  TICKETS,  INCLUDING  AUDIO  AND VIDEO FEATURES TO DISPLAY
 INFORMATION ABOUT A TICKET BEING DISPENSED, PROVIDED THAT SUCH  FEATURES
 DO NOT AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME.
  §  3.  Subdivision 9 of section 188-a of the general municipal law, as
 added by chapter 960 of the laws of 1976, is amended to read as follows:
  9. (A) The [board] COMMISSION shall have  the  power  to  approve  and
 establish  a  standard set of games of chance equipment and shall by its
 rules and regulations prescribe the manner in which such equipment is to
 be reproduced and distributed to licensed authorized organizations.  The
 sale or distribution to a licensed authorized organization of any equip-
 ment  other  than  that contained in the standard set of games of chance
 equipment shall constitute a violation of this section.
  (B) AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS PARAGRAPH, NO ELECTRONIC BELL JAR
 VENDING MACHINE SHALL BE SOLD, LEASED, DISTRIBUTED, INSTALLED, OR  OPER-
 ATED  BY ANY MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR, OR CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNTIL
 SUCH MACHINE HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION.  NO  ELECTRONIC  BELL
 JAR VENDING MACHINE SHALL BE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION UNLESS THE OPER-
 ATION  OF THE GAME DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS A FINITE PROBABILITY BASIS
 OF HAVING A PREDETERMINED QUANTITY OF CHANCES AMONG  WHICH  THERE  IS  A
 PREDETERMINED  QUANTITY  OF  WINNERS  THAT PAY A FIXED AND PREDETERMINED
 VALUE OF PRIZES, REGARDLESS OF THE SYMBOLS THAT ARE USED  OR  HOW  THOSE
 SYMBOLS ARE DISPLAYED ON PRE-PRINTED BELL JAR TICKETS.
  §  4.  Subdivision  3  of section 189 of the general municipal law, as
 amended by chapter 337 of the laws  of  1998,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:

 article shall purchase, lease, or  receive  any  supplies  or  equipment
 specifically  designed  or  adapted  for  use in the conduct of games of
 chance from other than a supplier licensed by the [board] COMMISSION  or
 from  another  authorized organization. Lease terms and conditions shall
 be subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the  [board]  COMMIS-
 SION. The provisions of this article shall not be construed to authorize
 or  permit an authorized organization to engage in the business of leas-
 ing games of chance, supplies, or equipment. Furthermore,  no  organiza-
 tion shall purchase bell jar tickets[,] or deals of bell jar tickets, OR
 PURCHASE  OR  LEASE  ANY  ELECTRONIC  BELL JAR VENDING MACHINE, from any
 other person or organization other than  those  specifically  authorized
 under  sections  one hundred ninety-five-n and one hundred ninety-five-o
 of this article.
  § 5. The opening paragraph of section 189-a of the  general  municipal
 law,  as  amended by chapter 164 of the laws of 2003, is amended to read
 as follows:

 or distribute supplies or equipment specifically designed or adapted for
 use  in  conduct  of  games  of  chance  without having first obtained a
 license therefor upon written application made, verified and filed  with
 the  [board]  COMMISSION  in  the form prescribed by the rules and regu-
 lations of the [board] COMMISSION.  As  a  part  of  its  determination

 cant;  the  names and addresses of its officers, directors, shareholders
 or partners; the amount of gross  receipts  realized  on  the  sale  and
 rental  of  games  of  chance  supplies  and  equipment to duly licensed

 and regulations. The fee for such license shall be a sum equal to  twen-
 ty-five  dollars  plus  an  amount  equal to two per centum of the gross
 sales and rentals, if any, of games of chance equipment and supplies  to

 see is an auxiliary or a bona fide member of an organization or  associ-
 ation which is affiliated with the licensee by being, with it, auxiliary

 assisting  the licensee in any activity other than managing or operating

 certify that he or she has no criminal record. No items of expense shall
 be  incurred  or  paid  in connection with the conducting of any game of
 chance pursuant to any license issued under this  article  except  those
