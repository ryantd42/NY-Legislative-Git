 RONMENTAL REVIEW REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE  EIGHT  OF  THIS  CHAPTER  WITH

  § 2. Section 23-2715 of the environmental conservation law, as amended
 by  chapter 166 of the laws of 1991, subdivision 6 as amended by chapter
 60 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
 § 23-2715. Financial security for reclamation.
  1. Before the department may issue a  permit,  the  applicant,  unless
 exempt,  shall  furnish financial security (A) to ensure the performance
 of reclamation as provided in the approved mined land-use plan,  (B)  TO
 COVER  ANY  DAMAGES  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM SALT MINING
 ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE  RESULT-
 ING  FROM  COLLAPSE  OR WATER CONTAMINATION, and (C) naming the state as
 beneficiary. Financial security shall be in the form of a  bond  from  a
 corporate  surety  licensed  to  do business as such in the state or any
 other form the department may deem acceptable. Any interest accruing  as
 a result of such security shall be the exclusive property of the permit-
 tee.
  2.  The department shall determine the amount, condition, and terms of
 the financial security. The amount shall be  based  upon  the  estimated
 cost  of  reclaiming  the affected land AND THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FROM
 POTENTIAL DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY  RESULTING  FROM  SALT  MINING
 ACTIVITIES  BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULT-
 S. 7736  3
 
 ING FROM COLLAPSE OR WATER CONTAMINATION, which shall be based on infor-
 mation contained in the permit application,  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL  QUALITY
 REVIEW CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE EIGHT OF THIS CHAPTER and upon such
 information  as  an  investigation  by the department may disclose. AT A
 MINIMUM, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL CONSIDER THE PARTICULAR  CIRCUMSTANCES  OF
 THE MINE AND MINING ACTIVITIES IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS PURSUANT TO THIS
 SUBDIVISION  RELATED  TO  FINANCIAL  SECURITY  AMOUNTS REQUIRED TO COVER
 POTENTIAL DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY  RESULTING  FROM  SALT  MINING
 ACTIVITIES  BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULT-
 ING FROM COLLAPSE OR WATER  CONTAMINATION.  SUCH  CONSIDERATION  SHALL
 INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO:
  (A)  THOSE  FACTORS  CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL
 SECURITY TO ENSURE PERFORMANCE OF RECLAMATION;
  (B) GEOLOGIC, HYDROLOGIC, AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS;
  (C) THE PRESENCE OF ANY ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS OR RESOURCES;
  (D) THE PRESENCE OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY; AND
  (E) LOCAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL DAMAGES.
  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ENGAGE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY WITH THE NECES-
 SARY ACTUARIAL AND/OR OTHER  APPROPRIATE  EXPERTISE  EITHER  TO  MAKE  A
 DETERMINATION  WITH  RESPECT  TO SUCH POTENTIAL DAMAGES OR TO REVIEW THE
 DETERMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH RESPECT THERETO AND, IN THE CASE OF
 A REVIEW, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL INCORPORATE THE  APPROPRIATE  RECOMMENDA-
 TIONS  BY  SUCH INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY REVIEWER INTO ITS FINAL DETERMI-
 NATION.
  3. The financial security shall remain in full force and effect  until
 the department has approved the reclamation AND DETERMINED THAT THERE IS
 NO  CONTINUING  RISK  OF DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM SALT MINING
 ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE  RESULT-
 ING  FROM  COLLAPSE  OR  WATER  CONTAMINATION.  At the discretion of the
 department, the permittee may secure the release of that portion of  the
 financial  security  for  affected  land  on  which reclamation has been
 completed and approved by the department.
  4. If the financial security shall for any reason be cancelled, within
 thirty days after receiving notice thereof, the permittee shall  provide
 a  valid  replacement  under  the  same  conditions as described in this
 section. Failure to provide a replacement bond within such  period  may,
 at  the  discretion of the commissioner, result in the immediate suspen-
 sion of the mining permit by the department.
  5. If a permit is suspended or revoked, the department may require the
 permittee to commence reclamation upon thirty days notice.
  6. If the permittee fails to commence or to complete  the  reclamation
 as  required, the department may attach the financial security furnished
 by the permittee. In any event, the full cost of completing  reclamation
 AND ANY DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM SALT MINING ACTIV-
 ITIES  BENEATH  A  LAKE,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULTING
 FROM COLLAPSE OR WATER CONTAMINATION shall be the personal liability  of
 the  permittee  and/or  the person engaged in mining and the department,
 acting by the attorney general, may bring suit to recover all  costs  to
 secure the reclamation AND DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM
 SALT MINING ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE not covered by the financial secu-
 rity.  The  materials,  machinery,  implements  and  tools  of  every
 description which may be found at the  mine,  or  other  assets  of  the
 permittee and/or the person engaged in mining shall be subject to a lien
 of  the  department  for the amount expended for reclamation of affected
 lands, AND FOR MAKING WHOLE ANY PARTIES SUFFERING ANY  DAMAGES  DIRECTLY
 OR  INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM SALT MINING ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE, and
 S. 7736  4
 
 shall not be removed without the written consent of the department. Such
 lien may be foreclosed by the attorney general in the same manner  as  a
 mechanic's  lien. Any and all moneys recovered shall be deposited in the
 environmental  regulatory  account  pursuant  to section 72-1009 of this
 chapter.
  7. Political subdivisions, municipalities, the United States  and  any
 of  its  agencies  and  agencies  of  the state shall be exempt from the
 requirements of this section.
  8. ANY PERMITTEE WHICH HAS FURNISHED A FINANCIAL SECURITY WHICH IS NOT
 IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS  SECTION  ON  THE  EFFECTIVE
 DATE  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE IN VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION IF SUCH
 FINANCIAL SECURITY IS NOT BROUGHT INTO COMPLIANCE WITHIN SIX  MONTHS  OF
 SUCH EFFECTIVE DATE.
  §  3.  Section 81 of the public lands law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 3 to read as follows:
  3. NOTWITHSTANDING SUBDIVISIONS ONE AND  TWO  OF  THIS  SECTION,  WITH
 RESPECT  TO  A  PERMIT,  CONSENT,  OR  LEASE ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO SALT
 MINING ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE, THE DURATION OF SUCH PERMIT,  CONSENT,
 OR  LEASE  SHALL  NOT  BE  LONGER  THAN THE DURATION FOR WHICH MINING IS
 ALLOWABLE UNDER THE PERMIT ISSUED BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL
 CONSERVATION  PURSUANT  TO TITLE TWENTY-SEVEN OF ARTICLE TWENTY-THREE OF
 THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW IN RESPECT OF SUCH MINING.
  § 4. Severability. If any provision of this act, or any application of
 any provision of this act, is held to be invalid, that shall not  affect
 the  validity or effectiveness of any other provision of this act, or of
 any other application of any provision of this act, which can  be  given
 effect  without  that  provision  or  application;  and to that end, the
 provisions and applications of this act are severable.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law; provided, however, that section two of this act shall
 take  effect  on  the  ninetieth  day  after it shall have become a law.
 Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal  of  any
 rule  or regulation necessary  for  the implementation of this act on
 its effective date are authorized to be made and completed on or  before
 such effective date.
