  § 2. Section 23-2715 of the environmental conservation law, as amended
 by  chapter 166 of the laws of 1991, subdivision 6 as amended by chapter
 60 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
 § 23-2715. Financial security for reclamation.
  1. Before the department may issue a  permit,  the  applicant,  unless
 exempt,  shall  furnish financial security (A) to ensure the performance
 of reclamation as provided in the approved mined land-use plan,  (B)  TO
 COVER  ANY  DAMAGES  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM SALT MINING
 ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE  RESULT-
 ING  FROM  COLLAPSE  OR WATER CONTAMINATION, and (C) naming the state as
 beneficiary. Financial security shall be in the form of a  bond  from  a
 corporate  surety  licensed  to  do business as such in the state or any
 other form the department may deem acceptable. Any interest accruing  as
 a result of such security shall be the exclusive property of the permit-
 tee.
  2.  The department shall determine the amount, condition, and terms of
 the financial security. The amount shall be  based  upon  the  estimated
 cost  of  reclaiming  the affected land AND THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FROM
 POTENTIAL DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY  RESULTING  FROM  SALT  MINING
 ACTIVITIES  BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULT-
 ING FROM COLLAPSE OR WATER CONTAMINATION, which shall be based on infor-
 mation contained in the permit application,  THE  ENVIRONMENTAL  QUALITY
 REVIEW CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE EIGHT OF THIS CHAPTER AND ANY ENVI-
 RONMENTAL  STUDY  CONDUCTED  PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION FOURTEEN OF SECTION
 23-2711 OF THIS TITLE and upon such information as an  investigation  by
 the department may disclose. AT A MINIMUM, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL CONSIDER
 THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MINE AND MINING ACTIVITIES IN MAKING
 DETERMINATIONS PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION RELATED TO FINANCIAL SECURI-
 TY  AMOUNTS  REQUIRED  TO COVER POTENTIAL DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
 RESULTING FROM SALT MINING ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO,  THOSE  RESULTING  FROM  COLLAPSE  OR  WATER  CONTAMINATION.
 CONSIDERATION  IN  SUCH  CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED
 TO:
  (A) THOSE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE  AMOUNT  OF  FINANCIAL
 SECURITY TO ENSURE PERFORMANCE OF RECLAMATION;
  (B) GEOLOGIC, HYDROLOGIC, AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS;
  (C) THE PRESENCE OF ANY ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS OR RESOURCES;
  (D) THE PRESENCE OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY; AND
  (E) LOCAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL DAMAGES.
  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ENGAGE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY WITH THE NECES-
 SARY  ACTUARIAL, CONSERVATION FINANCE AND/OR OTHER APPROPRIATE EXPERTISE
 EITHER TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WITH RESPECT TO  SUCH  POTENTIAL  DAMAGES
 DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY  RESULTING  FROM  SALT  MINING ACTIVITIES
 BENEATH A LAKE OR TO REVIEW THE DETERMINATION  OF  THE  DEPARTMENT  WITH
 RESPECT  THERETO  AND,  IN  THE  CASE  OF A REVIEW, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL
 INCORPORATE THE APPROPRIATE RECOMMENDATIONS BY SUCH  INDEPENDENT  THIRD-
 PARTY REVIEWER INTO ITS FINAL DETERMINATION.
  3.  The financial security shall remain in full force and effect until
 the department has approved the reclamation AND DETERMINED THAT THERE IS
 S. 7736--B  4

 NO CONTINUING RISK OF DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  FROM  SALT  MINING
 ACTIVITIES  BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RESULT-
 ING FROM COLLAPSE OR WATER  CONTAMINATION.  At  the  discretion  of  the
 department,  the permittee may secure the release of that portion of the
 financial security for affected  land  on  which  reclamation  has  been
 completed and approved by the department.
  4. If the financial security shall for any reason be cancelled, within
 thirty  days after receiving notice thereof, the permittee shall provide
 a valid replacement under the  same  conditions  as  described  in  this
 section.  Failure  to provide a replacement bond within such period may,
 at the discretion of the commissioner, result in the  immediate  suspen-
 sion of the mining permit by the department.
  5. If a permit is suspended or revoked, the department may require the
 permittee to commence reclamation upon thirty days notice.
  6.  If  the permittee fails to commence or to complete the reclamation
 as required, the department may attach the financial security  furnished
 by  the permittee. In any event, the full cost of completing reclamation
 AND ANY DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM SALT MINING ACTIV-
 ITIES BENEATH A LAKE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED  TO,  THOSE  RESULTING
 FROM  COLLAPSE OR WATER CONTAMINATION shall be the personal liability of
 the permittee and/or the person engaged in mining  and  the  department,
 acting  by  the attorney general, may bring suit to recover all costs to
 secure the reclamation AND DAMAGES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM
 SALT MINING ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE not covered by the financial secu-
 rity.  The  materials,  machinery,  implements  and  tools  of  every
 description  which  may  be  found  at  the mine, or other assets of the
 permittee and/or the person engaged in mining shall be subject to a lien
 of the department for the amount expended for  reclamation  of  affected
 lands,  AND  FOR MAKING WHOLE ANY PARTIES SUFFERING ANY DAMAGES DIRECTLY
 OR INDIRECTLY RESULTING FROM SALT MINING ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE,  and
 shall not be removed without the written consent of the department. Such
 lien  may  be foreclosed by the attorney general in the same manner as a
 mechanic's lien. Any and all moneys recovered shall be deposited in  the
 environmental  regulatory  account  pursuant  to section 72-1009 of this
 chapter.
  7. Political subdivisions, municipalities, the United States  and  any
 of  its  agencies  and  agencies  of  the state shall be exempt from the
 requirements of this section.
  8. ANY PERMITTEE WHICH HAS FURNISHED A FINANCIAL SECURITY WHICH IS NOT
 IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS  SECTION  ON  THE  EFFECTIVE
 DATE  OF  THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE IN VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION IF SUCH
 FINANCIAL SECURITY IS NOT BROUGHT INTO COMPLIANCE WITHIN SIX  MONTHS  OF
 SUCH EFFECTIVE DATE.
  §  3.  Section 81 of the public lands law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 3 to read as follows:
  3. NOTWITHSTANDING SUBDIVISIONS ONE AND  TWO  OF  THIS  SECTION,  WITH
 RESPECT  TO  A  PERMIT,  CONSENT,  OR  LEASE ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO SALT
 MINING ACTIVITIES BENEATH A LAKE, THE DURATION OF SUCH PERMIT,  CONSENT,
 OR  LEASE  SHALL  NOT  BE  LONGER  THAN THE DURATION FOR WHICH MINING IS
 ALLOWABLE UNDER THE PERMIT ISSUED BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL
 CONSERVATION  PURSUANT  TO TITLE TWENTY-SEVEN OF ARTICLE TWENTY-THREE OF
 THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW IN RESPECT OF SUCH MINING.
  § 4. Severability. If any provision of this act, or any application of
 any provision of this act, is held to be invalid, that shall not  affect
 the  validity or effectiveness of any other provision of this act, or of
 any other application of any provision of this act, which can  be  given
 S. 7736--B  5
 
 effect  without  that  provision  or  application;  and to that end, the
 provisions and applications of this act are severable.
  §  5.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law; provided, however, that section two of this act shall
 take effect on the ninetieth day after  it  shall  have  become  a  law.
 Effective  immediately,  the  addition, amendment and/or repeal  of  any
 rule  or regulation necessary  for  the implementation of  this  act  on
 its  effective date are authorized to be made and completed on or before
 such effective date.
