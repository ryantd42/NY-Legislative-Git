long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is moved to  commemorate
the  seventh  annual Sock Out Cancer Day on June 4, 2023, in conjunction

  WHEREAS,  Additionally,  in  February  2023,  Sock  Out  Cancer  was
notified  that  it was selected as the 2022 PGA Tour Champion Charity of
the Year, as a result, additional dollars will be contributed  to  match
the  Birdies  for  Cancer  program that ran during the 2022 Dick's Open;
these dollars will  also  be  distributed  to  the  two  local  hospital
foundations in Binghamton, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Security Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York and many
other  individuals  and  organizations throughout the state, and beyond,

food,  housing,  transportation  to  treatment,  etc., thus enabling the
patients to put additional energy into fighting cancer; and

within their own home communities; and

show solidarity with their friends and family members fighting cancer by
purchasing  and  wearing Sock Out Cancer's signature multi-colored socks

  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the seventh annual Sock Out Cancer Day in  conjunction  with
National Cancer Survivors Day on June 4, 2023; and be it further
