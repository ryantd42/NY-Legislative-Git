 academic  credit  by the state university of New York or city university
 of New York upon matriculation into a degree program  at  such  institu-
 tion,  provided  that  such  credit  shall be equal to the corresponding
 credit  hours  earned in the non-degree workforce credential, MICRO-CRE-
 DENTIAL OR CERTIFICATE program.
  2. For purposes of this section:
  a. for students defined in paragraph a  of  subdivision  one  of  this
 section,  a  part-time  student is one who: (i) enrolled as a first-time
 freshman during the two thousand six--two thousand seven  academic  year
 or  thereafter  at  a college or university within the state university,
 including a statutory or contract college, a  community  college  estab-
 lished  pursuant  to article one hundred twenty-six of this chapter, the
 city university of New York,  or  a  non-profit  college  or  university
 incorporated by the regents or by the legislature;
  (ii) is enrolled for at least six but less than twelve semester hours,
 or  the  equivalent,  per  semester  in an approved undergraduate degree
 program; and
  (iii) has a cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.00.
  b. for students defined in paragraph b  of  subdivision  one  of  this
 section,  a part-time student is one who: (i) meets all requirements for
 tuition assistance program awards except  for  the  student's  part-time
 attendance  and  any  other  requirements that are inconsistent with the
 student's enrollment in a non-degree workforce credential, MICRO-CREDEN-
 TIAL OR CERTIFICATE program; and
  (ii) is enrolled  in  an  approved  non-degree  workforce  credential,
 MICRO-CREDENTIAL  OR CERTIFICATE program at a community college pursuant
 to paragraph b of subdivision one of this section.
  C. MICRO-CREDENTIAL SHALL MEAN QUALIFICATIONS THAT DEMONSTRATE SKILLS,
 KNOWLEDGE, AND/OR EXPERIENCE IN A GIVEN SUBJECT AREA OR CAPABILITY.
  3. a. For part-time students defined in this section, the award  shall
 be  calculated  as  provided  in section six hundred sixty-seven of this
 article and shall be in an amount equal to the enrollment factor percent
 of the award the student would have been eligible  for  if  the  student
 were  enrolled  full-time. For part-time students defined in paragraph a
 of subdivision one of this section, the enrollment factor percent is the
 percentage obtained by dividing the number of  credits  the  student  is
 enrolled  in,  as  certified  by  the  school,  by the number of credits
 required for full-time study in the semester, quarter or term as defined
 by the commissioner. For part-time students defined in  paragraph  b  of
 subdivision  one  of this section, the enrollment factor shall be calcu-
 lated pursuant  to  regulations  established  by  the  higher  education
 services corporation.
  b.  (i)  For  part-time students defined in paragraph a of subdivision
 one of this section, any semester, quarter or term of attendance  during
 which  a  student  receives  an  award pursuant to this section shall be
 counted as the enrollment factor percent of a semester, quarter or  term
 toward  the  maximum  term  of eligibility for tuition assistance awards
 pursuant to section six hundred sixty-seven of this article.  The  total
 period  of  study  for  which  payment  may be made shall not exceed the
 equivalent of the maximum period authorized for that award.
  (ii) For part-time students defined in paragraph b of subdivision  one
 of this section, the total period of study for which payment may be made
 shall not exceed the equivalent of the maximum period authorized for the
 non-degree workforce credential, MICRO-CREDENTIAL OR CERTIFICATE program
 pursuant to paragraph b of subdivision one of this section.
