  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to those weeks
designated  to  promote  ethnic  pride  and  to  enhance  the profile of
cultural diversity which strengthens the fabric of  the  communities  of
the great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim August 11- 17, 2024, as
Puerto Rican Heritage Week in the great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Puerto Rican diaspora has a long and important  history
in  New York State and in fact the United States of America where nearly
5.7 million inhabitants of  Puerto  Rico  and  people  of  Puerto  Rican
heritage or birth reside; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  cultural  and historical connection to the island of
Puerto Rico has been commemorated with multiple celebrations and parades
throughout New York, including a parade held June in New York City and a
Puerto Rican and Hispanic Heritage parade in Buffalo in August,  amongst
other cultural festivities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  also  celebrates  the  many
community-led grassroots organizations across the  great  State  of  New
York  committed  to  promoting  the cultural contributions of the Puerto
Rican  diaspora  to  science,  technology,  the  arts,  government  and
inventions,  and  those who have served valiantly to protect our country
by serving in the Armed Forces; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  essential  that  we  continue  to  honor  their
contributions  while  also  fostering  a  sense  of  purpose  and
conscientiousness in community members who will stand on their shoulders
and make their unique mark on our  state  and  the  nation,  while  also
encourage  all  students  to understand the value of ethnic diversity in
our state and country, for developing ethnic literacy fosters  pride  in
one's  own  culture and a respect and appreciation for the uniqueness of
others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Puerto Rican Heritage  Week  honors  the  contributions  of
Puerto  Ricans  who  continue  to  make contributions towards building a
nation where people of many lands and cultures  have  historically  come
together; now, therefore, be it
