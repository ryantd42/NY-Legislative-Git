  Section  1. Subdivisions c and g of section 89-f of the retirement and

 section  as  renumbered by chapter 771 of the laws of 1988, and subdivi-

 of total creditable service. Application therefor  may  be  filed  in  a
 manner similar to that provided in section seventy of this article. Upon
 completion  of  AT  LEAST  twenty-five  years  of  such service and upon
 retirement,  each  such  member  shall receive a pension which, together
 with an annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent  of  [his]  SUCH
 MEMBER'S  accumulated  contributions  at the time of [his] SUCH MEMBER'S
 retirement and an additional pension which is the  actuarial  equivalent
 of the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay to which [he] SUCH MEMBER may
 then be entitled shall be sufficient to provide [him] SUCH MEMBER with a
 retirement  allowance  equal  to  one-half  of [his] SUCH MEMBER'S final
 average salary PLUS AN ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO ONE-SIX-
 TIETH OF SUCH MEMBER'S FINAL AVERAGE SALARY FOR EACH YEAR OF  CREDITABLE
 SERVICE  IN  EXCESS  OF  TWENTY-FIVE  YEARS  BUT NOT IN EXCESS OF THIRTY
 YEARS.
  § 2. Subdivision d of section 604 of the retirement and social securi-
 ty law, as amended by chapter 771 of the laws of  1988,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  d.  The  early  service  retirement  for  a  member who is employed in
 Suffolk county as a correction officer as  defined  in  section  eighty-
 nine-f  of  this  chapter,  shall  be a pension equal to one-fiftieth of
 final average salary times years of credited service at  the  completion
 of  twenty-five  years  of  service as such correction officer[, but not
 exceeding one-half of his or her] PLUS AN ADDITIONAL  RETIREMENT  ALLOW-
 ANCE  EQUAL  TO  ONE-SIXTIETH  OF SUCH MEMBER'S final average salary FOR
 EACH YEAR OF CREDITED SERVICE IN EXCESS OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS BUT NOT  IN
 EXCESS OF THIRTY YEARS.
  §  3.  All  past  service  costs  associated  with  implementing  the
 provisions of this act shall be borne by the county of Suffolk  and  may
 be amortized over a period of ten years.
  §  4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall  be  subject  to  the  appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  §  5.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all
 members that retire on or after such date.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would modify the service retirement benefit for  members  of
 the  New  York  State and Local EmployeesÆ Retirement System employed by
 Suffolk County as correction officers. The modified  service  retirement
 benefit  will  be one-half of final average salary (FAS) upon completion
 of twenty-five years of creditable service with additional sixtieths for
 each year of creditable service in excess of twenty-five years  but  not
 in  excess  of thirty years.  The current service retirement benefit is
 one-half of FAS upon  completion  of  twenty-five  years  of  creditable
 service.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $1.0 million in
 the annual contributions of Suffolk County for the  fiscal  year  ending
 March  31,  2025. In future years this cost will vary but is expected to
 average 0.8% of affected salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $12.8 million which will
 be borne by Suffolk County as a one-time payment.  This estimate assumes
 that payment will be made on February 1, 2025. If Suffolk County  elects
 to amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for the first year
 including interest would be $1.64 million.
 S. 6141--A  3
 
  These  estimated  costs  are based on 843 affected members employed by
 Suffolk County, with annual salary of approximately $115 million  as  of
 March 31, 2023.
