 SUFFICIENT  TO  PROVIDE SUCH MEMBER WITH A RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO
 SIXTY PERCENT OF SUCH MEMBER'S FINAL AVERAGE SALARY.
  g.  A  member contributing on the basis of this section at the time of
 retirement, shall retire after the completion of  twenty-five  years  OR
 THIRTY  YEARS  of  total creditable service. Application therefor may be
 filed in a manner similar to that provided in section  seventy  of  this
 article.  Upon  completion  of twenty-five years OR THIRTY YEARS of such
 service and upon retirement, each such member shall  receive  a  pension
 which,  together with an annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent
 of [his] SUCH MEMBER'S accumulated contributions at the  time  of  [his]

 SUCH  MEMBER with a retirement allowance equal to one-half of [his] SUCH
 MEMBER'S final average salary FOR A MEMBER RETIRING AFTER THE COMPLETION
 OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, OR A RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE EQUAL TO  SIXTY  PERCENT
 OF  SUCH  MEMBER'S  FINAL AVERAGE SALARY FOR A MEMBER RETIRING AFTER THE

  h. In computing the twenty-five years OR THIRTY YEARS of total service
 of a member pursuant to this section full credit shall be given and full

 World  War  I  as  defined in section two of this chapter, provided such
 member at the time of [his] SUCH MEMBER'S entrance into the armed forces
 was in the service of the county of Suffolk.
  § 2.  Subdivision d of section 604 of the retirement and social  secu-
 rity  law,  as amended by chapter 771 of the laws of 1988, is amended to
 read as follows:
  d. 1. The early service retirement for a member  who  is  employed  in
 Suffolk  county  as  a  correction officer as defined in section eighty-
 nine-f of this chapter, shall be a  pension  equal  to  one-fiftieth  of

 SUFFOLK COUNTY AS A CORRECTION OFFICER AS  DEFINED  IN  SECTION  EIGHTY-
 NINE-F  OF  THIS  CHAPTER,  SHALL  BE A PENSION EQUAL TO ONE-FIFTIETH OF
 FINAL AVERAGE SALARY TIMES YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE AT  THE  COMPLETION
 OF THIRTY YEARS OF SERVICE AS SUCH CORRECTION OFFICER, BUT NOT EXCEEDING
 SIXTY PERCENT OF SUCH MEMBER'S FINAL AVERAGE SALARY.
  §  3.  All  past  service  costs  associated  with  implementing  the
 provisions of this act shall be borne by the county of Suffolk  and  may

  §  4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall  be  subject  to  the  appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  §  5.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all
 members that retire on or after such date.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would modify the service retirement benefit for  members  of
 the  New  York  State and Local Employees' Retirement System employed by
 Suffolk County as correction officers. The modified  service  retirement
 benefit  will  be one-half of final average salary (FAS) upon completion
 of twenty-five years of creditable service and sixty percent of FAS upon
 completion of thirty years of creditable service.  The  current  service
 retirement  benefit  is  one-half  of FAS upon completion of twenty-five
 years of creditable service.
 S. 6141--B  3
 
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $440,000  in  the
 annual  contributions of Suffolk County for the fiscal year ending March
 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary but is expected to average
 0.3% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate past service cost of approximately $5.5 million which will
 be borne by Suffolk County as a one-time payment. This estimate  assumes
 that  payment will be made on February 1, 2025. If Suffolk County elects
 to amortize this cost over a 10-year period,  the  cost  for  each  year
 including interest would be $702,000.
  These  estimated  costs  are based on 843 affected members employed by
 Suffolk County, with annual salary of approximately $115 million  as  of
 March 31, 2023.
