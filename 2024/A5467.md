  Section 1. Any municipality located in the county  of  Orange  or  the

 that the person or persons responsible for either operating, conducting,

 held in such municipality, at which a price for admission or  attendance
 is  charged  or  is  to be charged, shall pay the costs incurred by such
 municipality as a result of providing additional  police  personnel,  if
 any,  beyond the normal number of officers who would have otherwise been
 on duty. The local law shall identify  the  type  or  types  of  special
 events,  exhibitions,  or  contests  for  which  an activity's operator,
 conductor, promoter, or sponsor may be  charged  for  additional  police
 personnel that is either requested by the operator, conductor, promoter,
 or  sponsor or determined to be necessary by the municipality. The local
 law may also provide that: (a) the  operator,  conductor,  promoter,  or
 sponsor  of  the  activity  shall  complete  such  forms or applications
 providing the information deemed necessary by the municipality to deter-
 mine whether any additional police personnel should be scheduled for the
 event; (b) the local law shall not apply to any corporation formed under
 the not-for-profit corporation law; and  (c)  the  operator,  conductor,
 promoter,  or  sponsor of the activity shall pay all or a portion of the
 estimated cost of additional police protection prior to the commencement
 of the event.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
