  COMMEMORATING the inaugural Prince Hall Day at the
  New York State Capitol on May 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the inaugural Prince Hall Day at the New York State Capitol
on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, and welcome Prince Hall Masons from across the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  justly  important  to  recognize  the  history  and
tradition  of  Freemasonry dating back to 1775, in which the Prince Hall
began its fight to become Masons and  be  recognized  along  with  other
African  American community members as the first African American Lodge,
known as African Lodge No.459; and
 
  WHEREAS, The dedicated Masons of New York  are  men  with  a  social
conscience  and  a  charitable  perspective,  who  are  also  known  as
Freemasons; they are part of a fraternal organization that shares common
moral ideals and esoteric values which are  based  on  the  doctrine  of
Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  hardships,  trials, and tribulations faced over their
enduring history cemented  the  long-standing  resolve,  privilege,  and
pride  that  comes  with  rights of each Master Mason in their respected
lodge; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  esteemed  and  inaugural  occasion  presents  an
opportunity  to  set  aside time to recognize members of the Prince Hall
lodges, past and present, who have worked to deliver present day  Masons
to their current position and status which they so proudly cherish; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  able  leadership, guidance, and steady hand of
Worshipful Master Gregory R. Smith Jr., Grand Master, the  son  of  past
Grand  Master Gregory R. Smith Sr., the New York Prince Hall Masons have
continued not only their amazing charitable works and deeds  across  the
State, but have been a point of unity in the community serving as a sign
of peace, hope, and love in the Black and Brown Community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Prince  Hall  Masons  are,  and  always  has  been,
characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
an  uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of
the community and organization which they serve so dedicatedly; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to commend and honor
The Prince Hall Masons of New York who have labored  so  conscientiously
to  secure  and improve the quality of life for the community it serves;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the inaugural Prince Hall Day at the New York State Capitol
on May 14, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of New York.
