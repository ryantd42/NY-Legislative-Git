  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 2024, as CBD Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York  takes  great  pride  in  recognizing
official  months  established  to  increase  awareness  of  breakthrough
wellness products that affect the lives of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2024, as CBD Month
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
CBD Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cannabidiol (CBD) has many health  and  wellness  benefits,
including relief from pain and anxiety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  CBD  Month  in  New York State commemorates the widespread
availability of various CBD products and their  roles  in  the  wellness
journeys  of  consumers  across  the  country and around the world; this
month serves the purpose of spreading knowledge and  creating  awareness
of CBD and its surprising benefits; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2018, Congress passed the Farm Bill and it was quickly
signed into law; this crucial piece of legislation made growing hemp and
the production of hemp-derived goods fully legal at the  federal  level;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Most notably, the new law paved the way for cannabidiol to
become more accessible to Americans than ever before; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite intense media coverage and discussion, many  people
are  not aware of CBD's potential for health and wellness; those who are
aware of CBD and its powerful properties often find themselves  confused
by mountains of ill-informed hearsay and mixed messages in the news; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the month of January, National CBD Month aims to
shine  a  spotlight  on  the  hemp-derived  substance,  clear  up
misunderstandings, change perceptions, and set  standards  for  superior
CBD products; and
 
  WHEREAS,  CBD  works  by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid
system, a set of neural receptors which help  regulate  many  processes,
including mood, memory, digestion, the immune response, and even staying
upright; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With eight to ten percent of New York State's 15.1 million
citizens partaking in marijuana products, the State  has  earned  around
$215 million in CBD sales; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Overall,  CBD helps preserve homeostasis: the balance your
body maintains even when stresses from your environment try to throw  it
off; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  enhancing this system, CBD serves as a way to maintain
whole-body wellness; many people find that taking daily CBD  helps  them
stay calm and focused, and boosts their sense of well-being; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative  that there be greater awareness of the
benefits of cannabidiol, and more must be done to increase  activity  at
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2024, as CBD Month
in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
