  the occasion of their designation as recipients of a
  Liberty Medal, the highest honor  bestowed  upon  an
  individual by the New York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Liam Hedley and Hunter  Marcello  upon  the  occasion  of  their
designation as recipients of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed
upon an individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  July  3,  2024,  Newfane  Middle  School  eighth-grade
students  Liam  Hedley  and  Hunter Marcello were at the Town of Newfane
Marina where they had been fishing and inspecting the upcoming fireworks
display when they noticed an overturned kayak and a woman in  the  water
waving her arms for help; and
 
  WHEREAS, These two courageous boys acted swiftly and ran to a nearby
business,  Hedley  Boat  Company,  where they recruited the help of Liam
Hedley's father, the owner of the company, and the three of them quickly
loaded a dinghy into the water to rush to aid the woman in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, The woman was rescued by these three heroes,  being  pulled
up  into  the  boat and rowed to shore where emergency medical personnel
were waiting to begin their assessment, treatment, and  transport  to  a
nearby hospital; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Liam  Hedley  and  Hunter  Marcello  were honored by their
school district at a board of education meeting and met with the  school
Superintendent Jay Lupini who praised these selfless students and bonded
over their mutual interests in fishing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Truly  brave  and  courageous  young  men, Liam Hedley and
Hunter Marcello played a vital role in this extraordinary rescue effort,
and should be praised by the people of this great Empire State for their
astute actions in working to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Liam Hedley and Hunter Marcello, in their  spontaneous  and
heroic  acts,  have so aptly demonstrated their character and compassion
for the welfare of others, personifying, by virtue of their action,  the
collective concern of ordinary citizens across the community of New York
State  who  voluntarily respond without thought of danger or reward when
others are in need of help; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Liam Hedley and Hunter  Marcello  upon  the  occasion  of  their
designation as recipients of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed
upon an individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
