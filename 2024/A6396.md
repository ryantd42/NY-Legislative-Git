  1.  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, whether the defend-
 ant is represented by counsel or elects to proceed pro se, all pre-trial
 motions shall be served or filed within forty-five days  after  arraign-
 ment  OR  THE  FILING  OF A PROPER CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE PURSUANT TO

 five day period shall commence on the date counsel initially appears  on
 defendant's behalf.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
