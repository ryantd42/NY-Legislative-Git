  REAFFIRMING  support for the Good Friday Agreement
  to ensure a lasting peace in  Northern  Ireland  and
  commemorating its 25th Anniversary
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Good  Friday  Agreement,  also  known  as the Belfast
Agreement, was signed on April 10, 1998; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  Good  Friday  Agreement  ended  decades  of  sectarian
violence  and  political  instability  in  Northern  Ireland,  which had
claimed  over  3,500  lives  and  left  countless  others  injured  and
traumatized  and  has  allowed  a  generation  to  grow up in previously
unimagined peace; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  Good  Friday  Agreement  established  a  power-sharing
government  in Northern Ireland, with representation from all traditions
and communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Good  Friday  Agreement  enshrines  human  rights
protections, equality provisions, and a commitment to address the legacy
of the troubles with transparency, truth and justice; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Good Friday Agreement has been widely recognized as a
landmark achievement in  conflict  resolution  and  a  model  for  other
divided societies around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Good  Friday  Agreement  is  commemorating  its  25th
anniversary  in  2023,  providing  an  opportunity  to  reflect  on  its
achievements  and  challenges,  as well as its continuing relevance in a
changing political landscape; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States has played a crucial role  in  supporting
the  Good  Friday  Agreement,  with  President  Bill  Clinton  and  his
administration helping to facilitate  the  negotiations  and  succeeding
administrations  providing  political  and  economic  support  for  its
implementation; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States has a  strategic  interest  in  promoting
peace  and  stability  in  Northern  Ireland  and ensuring that the Good
Friday Agreement continues to be upheld and strengthened; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Good Friday Agreement has faced  challenges  in  recent
years,  including Brexit, the suspension of the power-sharing government
due to  the  Democratic  Unionist  Party's  refusal  to  participate  in
government, and a British government proposal to create an unprecedented
amnesty  for  criminal  activities  of  its  forces,  including  murder,
committed during the Northern Ireland conflict in  direct  contravention
of the Good Friday Agreement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  restoration  of  the  devolved government in Northern
Ireland is crucial to the continued implementation of  the  Good  Friday
Agreement and the effective governance of Northern Ireland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The State of New York reaffirms its commitment to the Good
Friday Agreement, recognizing it as a cornerstone of peace and stability
in Northern Ireland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition,  the  State of New York urges all parties in
Northern Ireland to restore the Stormont Government and, in  the  spirit
of  the  Good  Friday  Agreement,  address  the  outstanding  issues and
challenges through the peaceful institutions  of  democratic  governance
and  ensure  that  the  vision  for a shared peaceful and just future is
realized; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York calls on the United States government
to continue its support for the Good Friday Agreement and encourage  its
Special  Envoy  to  facilitate dialogue and cooperation between Northern
Ireland and the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York recognizes the importance of the Good
Friday  Agreement  for  promoting  human  rights,  equality,  and
reconciliation  and  pledges  to  support initiatives that advance these
values, including parity of esteem, conflict resolution, and the  legacy
of the troubles; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
reaffirm support for the Good Friday Agreement to ensure a lasting peace
in Northern Ireland and to commemorate its 25th Anniversary.
