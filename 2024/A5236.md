  § 164. Reports  by and to the department.  Each department, other than
 the executive department, shall make an annual report  to  the  governor

 calendar  year. It shall contain such information concerning the depart-

 the head of the department shall  deem  necessary  or  proper,  and  any
 matters  required  by  express  provision  of law to be included in such
 report. A department also shall make such other and special  reports  as
 the  governor  or either house of the legislature may require. From time
 to time, the head of a department may require from any board, commission
 or other body in the department  or  from  any  subordinate  officer  or
 employee,  division or bureau of the department, or from any institution
 subject to the supervision of the department, or from any agency of  the
 department, such reports or information as such head may deem necessary.
 Unless  expressly  authorized by the head of the department, there shall
 be hereafter no separate report, annual or otherwise,  directly  to  the
 legislature  or  governor  by any such board, commission, body, officer,
 division, bureau, institution or  agency  notwithstanding  any  existing
 provision of law authorizing or requiring such report.  EACH DEPARTMENT,
 TO  THE  EXTENT  PRACTICABLE, SHALL MAKE SUCH ANNUAL REPORT AVAILABLE TO
