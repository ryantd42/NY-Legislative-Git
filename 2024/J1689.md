  COMMEMORATING  the  16th  Anniversary  of Kosovo's
  Independence
 
  WHEREAS, Kosovo Independence Day  is  a  national  holiday  observed
annually every February 17th, in commemoration of the declaration of the
Balkan nation's independence in 2008; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kosovo,  as  the  second-youngest  country in Southeastern
Europe, on February 17, 2008, made a declaration  of  Independence  from
Serbia  following  a deadly war which lasted from March 5, 1998, to June
11, 1999; and
 
  WHEREAS, The conflict came to a halt following  the  North  Atlantic
Treaty  Organization's  (NATO) intervention by airstrikes in March 1999;
Yugoslav forces then withdrew from Kosovo; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Republic of Kosovo, which derives  its  name  from  the
Serbian  region  "field of the blackbirds," a former province in Serbia,
is majorly described as an ethnic Albanian territory; and
 
  WHEREAS, Present-day Kosovo traces its origin to  Dardania,  forming
an  independent  polity known as the Kingdom of Dardania (fourth century
B.C.); and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its independence, Kosovo citizens are  rightly  proud
of  the  progress  Kosovo has made in promoting and advancing democratic
values and strengthening institutions to deliver good  governance,  rule
of law, and economic opportunity for all Kosovans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  this  day, the enduring partnership between the United
States and Kosovo is rooted in the  mutual  understanding,  values,  and
friendship  between  our  countries;  normalization  of  relations  with
Serbia, centered on eventual mutual recognition,  remains  essential  to
peace and prosperity in this region of the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  agreement  proposed under the EU-facilitated Dialogue
will advance Kosovo toward greater regional stability and  European  and
Euro-Atlantic integration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  immense  pleasure that this Legislative Body
acknowledges  and  congratulates  the  people  of  Kosovo,  our  friend,
partner,  and ally, on this significant day of independence, recognizing
their achievements and supporting their future endeavors; now therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pauses in its deliberations  to
commemorate  the  16th Anniversary of Kosovo's independence, celebrating
its past, acknowledging its present, and looking forward  with  optimism
to its future.
