  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2024, as  Pedestrian  Safety  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
safety issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2024,  as
Pedestrian Safety Month in the State of New York,  in  conjunction  with
the observance of National Pedestrian Safety Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In New York State approximately 300 pedestrians are killed
each year and countless more pedestrians and cyclists are  injured  each
year; and
 
  WHEREAS, On average, a pedestrian is killed in a traffic crash every
71  minutes  and  injured  in  a traffic crash every nine minutes in the
United  States  according  to  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety
Administration (NHTSA); and
 
  WHEREAS, The NHTSA reports that pedestrian deaths account for 17% of
all  traffic  fatalities  and  there are over 60,000 pedestrians injured
annually in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Pedestrian injuries and deaths could be eliminated if  both
motor  vehicle  drivers  and  pedestrians took a little extra caution at
crosswalks and on roadways; and
 
  WHEREAS, In New  York  State,  pedestrian  fatalities  and  injuries
involving  motor  vehicles  have  annual  societal impacts that cost the
state billions of dollars; and
 
  WHEREAS, The highest pedestrian death rate is for older adults; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is also a disproportionate occurrence  of  pedestrian
injuries and fatalities within disadvantaged populations living in areas
of  high need, including upon children walking to school in suburban and
urban settings; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States Department of  Transportation,  with  the
backing  of  the NHTSA, has dedicated the month of October to protecting
pedestrians and motorists  from  traffic  accidents  by  implementing  a
national  program called the Safe System Approach in January 2022, which
utilizes proactive and preemptive measures to  mitigate  traffic-related
collisions, injuries, and fatalities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  spreading awareness and disseminating information with
prominence throughout October, proponents of  the  NHTSA's  Safe  System
Approach  hope  to  see  nationwide  behavioral  alterations  that  gear
 
road-users toward more cautious travel, thereby  reducing  injuries  and
fatalities of pedestrians; and
 
  WHEREAS,  By  highlighting  the  Safe  System  Approach  throughout
October, National Pedestrian Safety  Month  facilitates  an  environment
that enhances welfare by highlighting a specific safety aim each week of
the  month;  and  further,  the order of emphasis for each week is Safer
People, Safer Speeds and Safer Roads,  Safer  Vehicles,  and  Post-Crash
Care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pedestrian  safety  improvement strategies are promoted by
NHTSA during National Pedestrian Safety  Month,  including  yielding  to
pedestrians,  putting  down electronic devices while walking, donning of
helmets, wearing of seatbelts, sporting of reflective attire,  crosswalk
safety  skills, driving at appropriate speeds, using lights, and calling
for emergency response teams; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness and
focus on the elimination of this serious issue, and more must be done to
increase activity at the State, local and national levels  to  implement
new  safety  countermeasures  to  prevent  pedestrian  injuries  and
fatalities; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2024,  as
Pedestrian Safety Month the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
