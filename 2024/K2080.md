BY: M. of A. Otis
 
  CONGRATULATING  the  Rye High School Girls Varsity
  Soccer Team upon the occasion of capturing  the  New
  York State Class A Girls Championship
 
  WHEREAS,  The  storied  tradition  of  athletic  success at Rye High
School has continued with the Girls Varsity Soccer Team's victory in the
New York State Class A Championship game, shutting  out  Shoreham-Wading
River  High  School  with  a  score  of  2-0, at Cortland High School in
Cortland, New York, on Sunday, November  12,  2023,  and  capturing  the
team's  first state and sectional Class A Championship title since 2008;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This achievement follows the building of one  of  the  most
solid  and  consistent  sectional  programs  in the state, finishing the
regular season with a  14-2  record  through  effective  ball  handling,
passing, and shooting, in addition to explosive speed and agility; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In recent years, this championship team was built upon the
success of a strong program that advanced significantly but  fell  short
of  a state title; the 2023 Garnets turned this history into inspiration
and a fighting spirit through the  successive  rounds  of  regional  and
state playoff tournament competition against worthy opponents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Regional  victories,  beginning  with  an  impressive  2-0
victory over Albertus Magnus, a team that had not  lost  or  conceded  a
goal  to  a  public  school  since  2019,  were  succeeded by a regional
semi-final 4-0 win over Owego Free Academy and the regional triumph over
Our Lady of Lourdes by a 4-1 margin; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rye High School's tremendous defense continued to shine  in
the  state's  Final  Four  with  their 3-0 state semi-final success over
Lewiston Porter School and the exciting championship game  victory  over
Shoreham-Wading River High School by a 2-0 score, culminating an amazing
playoff  run  of  24  goals  for,  and  only one goal against, the Girls
Varsity Soccer Team in five post-season games; and
 
  WHEREAS, The team, finishing the season  with  an  outstanding  22-2
record,  was  loyally  and  enthusiastically  supported by family, fans,
friends, and the community at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body congratulates the members of the  Rye
High  School  Girls Varsity Soccer Team: Tessa Labovitz, Karenna Chader,
Phoebe Lee, Sage Ruttenberg, Lucy Wyckoff, Della Goodman,  Joy  DeSanto,
Alli  Koford, Isabel Harvey, Lyla Keenan, Bowyn Brown, Sophia Shoemaker,

Coach  Richard  Savage;  Assistant  Coach Guilianna Addesso; Director of
Athletics,  Susan  Reid  Dullea;  Principal  Suzanne  Kelly-Short;  and
Superintendent  Dr.  Eric  Byrne on their outstanding season and overall
team record; and
 
  WHEREAS, Athletic  competition  instills  the  values  of  teamwork,
sportsmanship,  pride,  and  accomplishment;  Head Coach Richard Savage,
Assistant Coach Guilianna Addesso, Director  of  Athletics,  Susan  Reid
Dullea,  and  all  of  the  outstanding  athletes  have  clearly  made a
contribution to the spirit of excellence that is a tradition at Rye High
School; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  competitors  have  made  their  mark  through  a
combination of scoring power and stingy defensive play; let us celebrate
this championship season; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pauses in its deliberations  to
congratulate  and  honor  the  Rye High School Girls Varsity Soccer Team
upon the occasion  of  capturing  the  New  York  State  Class  A  Girls
Championship;  winning  a state championship is an enormous achievement,
made  possible  this  season  through  the  team's  exceptional  skill,
persistence,  teamwork,  and  energy delivered in the spirit of the best
collegiate, Olympic and professional soccer championship teams;  and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the members, coaches, and administrators of the Rye  High
School Girls Varsity Soccer Team.
