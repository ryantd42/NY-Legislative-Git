  memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Greek History Month in the  State  of
  New  York,  in conjunction with the commemoration of
  the 202nd Anniversary of Greek Independence
 
  WHEREAS, The year 2023 will mark  the  202nd  Anniversary  of  Greek
Independence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Greek  people  proudly  trace  their  heritage  back
thousands  of  years  in  Europe,  where  they  developed  an  advanced
civilization unlike any the world had yet seen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  the fall of the City of Constantinopole in 1453, the
Greek people began almost four  centuries  under  foreign  rule  in  the
Ottoman Empire; and
 
  WHEREAS, In March 1821, the yearning for Greek independence inspired
multiple  militias  to  engage  in  battles  against  the Ottoman Empire
including an incursion into Moldavia led by Alexandros  Ypsilantis,  and
various skirmishes in the Peloponnese, and on several islands; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  March  25,  1821, Bishop Germanos of Patras raised the
Greek flag at the Monastery of Agia Lavra in  the  Peloponnese,  marking
the beginning of the war for independence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  January  1822,  the  Greeks  officially  declared
independence from the Ottoman Empire; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Greeks valiantly waged war against their Ottoman rulers
under the brave leadership of Theodoris  Kolokotronis  for  almost  nine
years until a part of modern Greece was declared independent; and
 
  WHEREAS, The war of independence was formally concluded in 1832 with
the  signing  of  the  Treaty  of Constantinopole, further expanding the
borders of a modern, independent Greek state; and
 
  WHEREAS, March 25th is celebrated as Independence Day in Greece  and
in  Greek  communities  around the world, commemorating the beginning of
the war of independence; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout history, the  Greek  people  have  exhibited  an
enduring  sense of bravery in rising up against oppressors; with Winston
Churchill noting in a famed World War II speech that "Until now we  used
to  say  that the Greeks fight like heroes. Now we shall say: The heroes
fight like Greeks"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ancient Greece has shaped modern society by originating the
concepts of Logic, Science, Lyrics, Philosophy, and History as  well  as
being  the  birthplace  of  democratic  ideals,  inspiring the notion of
participation in government which influenced the framing of  the  United
States Constitution; and
 
  WHEREAS, Greece has continued to enrich our culture in the fields of
literature,  philosophy  and  architecture,  and has promoted the modern
Olympic Games, hosting the first in 1896 and most recently in  2004;  we
also  honor Greek-Americans in New York who have improved our community,
shown  love for family, and shared with us their traditions to learn and
celebrate; and
 
  WHEREAS, The great State of New York has been blessed in many  ways,
including  through  the  presence  of  the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of
America; it serves as a beacon of moral and ethical guidance  throughout
the hemisphere from its Manhattan headquarters; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York  is  further  enhanced  by  its
long-standing  partnership  with  the  Federation  of  Hellenic-American
Societies, which continues its tradition of strong leadership within the
Greek-American community; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
New  Yorkers of Hellenic descent for their enduring contributions to the
educational, social, moral and economic principles that  are  so  deeply
ingrained in the fabric of our country and State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2023,  as  Greek
History  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the
commemoration of the 202nd Anniversary of  Greek  Independence,  and  to
publicly  encourage  the  citizens  of  New  York  to  reflect  upon the
contributions of the Greek community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York;  and  His  Eminence  Archbishop  Elpidophoros  (Lambriniadis)  of
America,  Most  Honorable  Exarch  of  the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of
America.
