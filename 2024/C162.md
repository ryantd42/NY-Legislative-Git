  CONCURRENT  RESOLUTION  OF  THE  SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
  proposing  to  implement,  pursuant  to  and  in
  compliance  with  the provisions of article 7 of the
  Public Officers Law, a system  of  videoconferencing
  to conduct meetings
 
  WHEREAS,  Section  103-a  of  the Public Officers Law, as created by
Chapter 56 of the  Laws  of  2022,  currently  permits  the  Senate  and
Assembly,  acting  through a joint resolution, to provide for the use of
videoconferencing to conduct meetings, as defined by section 102 of  the
Public  Officers  Law,  provided  that  a  minimum number of members are
present to fulfill the public body's  quorum  requirement  in  the  same
physical location or locations where the public can attend; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Senate  and  Assembly  conducted the requisite public
hearing under article 7 of the Public Officers Law in Albany, New  York,
on  March  1,  2023,  to  receive  public  comment  on  the  use  of
videoconferencing in legislative proceedings; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED (if the &HOUSE concur), That  the  Senate  and  Assembly  are
authorized  and  empowered  to  implement, pursuant to and in compliance
with the provisions of article 7 of the Public Officers Law, a system of
videoconferencing to  conduct  meetings,  provided  that  the  requisite
quorum for such body shall be in the same physical location or locations
where the public may attend and observe; and, be it further
 
  RESOLVED  (if the &HOUSE concur), That legislators shall be permitted,
on a case by case basis, if unable to be physically present at any  such
meeting  due  to extraordinary circumstances or any other significant or
unexpected  factor  or  event  which  precludes  the  member's  physical
attendance  at  such  meeting,  and with the approval of the appropriate
leader  pursuant  to  the  procedures  established  by  each  house,  to
participate in meetings through the use of videoconferencing; and, be it
further
 
  RESOLVED  (if  the  &HOUSE  concur),  That  if no quorum is physically
present at any  hearing  conducted  by  either  house,  or  any  hearing
conducted jointly by the houses, videoconferencing may not be used; and,
be it further
 
  RESOLVED (if the &HOUSE concur), That this joint resolution shall take
effect  immediately  upon  adoption  by both the Senate and Assembly and
shall remain in effect until July 1, 2024, unless otherwise rescinded.
