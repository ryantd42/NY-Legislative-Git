  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Hypertension  Awareness  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as Hypertension
Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Hypertension Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hypertension,  also  known as high blood pressure, affects
nearly half of all Americans and  is  a  major  risk  factor  for  heart
disease  and stroke, which are the leading causes of death in the United
States; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2021, the latest  year  for  which  data  is  available,
Hypertension  was a primary or contributing cause of death for more than
691,000 people in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The most important preventable risk  factor  for  premature
death  worldwide,  Hypertension  increases  the  risk  of ischemic heart
disease, strokes, peripheral vascular diseases,  aortic  aneurysms,  and
atherosclerosis, as well as chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation,
leukemia, pulmonary embolisms, cognitive impairment, and dementia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hypertension  can  be difficult to diagnose and manage, as
the symptoms that portend Hypertension are due to nonspecific  lifestyle
and genetic factors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hypertension  can cause serious pregnancy complications in
the form  of  pre-eclampsia,  which  increases  the  risk  of  pregnancy
complications  such  as premature birth, low birthweight, or stillbirth;
Hypertension during pregnancy can double the risk of stillbirth; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hypertension affects non-Hispanic  black  adults  at  rates
several  times  higher  than  that  of  other  populations and thus is a
contributing factor to disparate health outcomes faced in New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Legislature continues its commitment  to
educate  the public in the importance of early detection and prevention,
to support institutions that  further  research  and  knowledge  in  the
treatment  of  hypertension  and  to  promote  an environment in which a
healthy  lifestyle  will  result  in  healthy  minds  and  bodies;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as  Hypertension
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
