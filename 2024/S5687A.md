 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to freezing  the

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "MTA Executive Pay Freeze Act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The purpose of this act is to ensure account-
 ability of executives in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)
 for  service  disruptions or delays that occur on the MTA's subway, bus,
 and commuter rail systems.
  § 3. The public authorities law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 1266-m to read as follows:
  §  1266-M.  PAY  FREEZE OF EXECUTIVES. 1. THE PAY OF ALL EXECUTIVES IN
 THE AUTHORITY SHALL BE FROZEN  FOR  EACH  YEAR  IN  WHICH  THERE  IS  AN
 INCREASE  IN  SERVICE  DISRUPTIONS  OR DELAYS ON THE AUTHORITY'S SUBWAY,
 BUS, AND COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEMS. THE PAY FREEZE SHALL CONTINUE UNTIL  THE
 MTA'S  SERVICE  DISRUPTIONS AND DELAYS RETURN TO THEIR PREVIOUS LEVEL OR
 ARE REDUCED.

 SIBLE  FOR THE AUTHORITY'S SUBWAY, BUS, AND COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEMS OR WHO
 DOES NOT HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OVER SERVICE DELIVERY. THE PAY  FREEZE  MAY
 ALSO  BE  WAIVED  IF  THE  EXECUTIVE  DEMONSTRATES  THAT  THE  SERVICE
 DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS WERE  BEYOND  THEIR  CONTROL  OR  WERE  CAUSED  BY
 FACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE AUTHORITY'S CONTROL.

  5. THE AUTHORITY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE  FOR  THE  ENFORCEMENT  OF  THIS
 SECTION,  AND  MAY ADOPT RULES AND REGULATIONS AS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT
 ITS PROVISIONS.
  § 4. Hold harmless provision for union contracts. Nothing in this  act
 shall  be  construed  to  modify,  impair,  or  supersede any collective
 bargaining agreement between the MTA  and  any  union  representing  MTA
 employees.  In the event that any provision of this act conflicts with a
 collective bargaining agreement, the terms of the collective  bargaining
 agreement shall prevail.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
