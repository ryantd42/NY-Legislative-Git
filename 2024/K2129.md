  COMMENDING  the  Dobra  Polska Szkola Foundation's
  Flowers for Tadeusz Kosciuszko campaign
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of  this  Legislative  Body  to  publicly
recognize  those  extraordinary individuals and organizations which have
made contributions to the cultural enrichment of the State of New  York,
and to the success and progress of society during their life's work; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Dobra  Polska  Szkola  Foundation's  Flowers  for  Tadeusz
Kosciuszko campaign; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Dobra Polska Szkola Foundation is a non-profit that was
founded in 2014, and is dedicated to raising awareness of Polish society
in the United States, supporting Polish schools, and spreading knowledge
of Polish involvement in the founding of the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  foundation  promotes  Polish  culture  through  art
activities,  theater  performances,  suggestions  for  extracurricular
activities, as well as through special cultural events; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Dobra  Polska  Szkola  Foundation  launched  an  annual
Flowers  for  Tadeusz  Kosciuszko  campaign  in  2023  to  commemorate
Kosciuszko's death anniversary, which is on October 15th;  on  this  day
every  year,  the  Polish-American community comes together to celebrate
Kosciuszko's everlasting legacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2023, a ceremony was held on the  Maspeth  side  of  the
Kosciuszko  bridge,  as  a  bronze  memorial  dedicated to Kosciuszko is
located there, to commemorate the 205th anniversary of his death; during
this ceremony, two plaques commemorating Kosciuszko were  unveiled,  and
readings of congratulatory letters and speeches were given; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Representatives  of Polish organizations such as PASI, the
Polish Cultural Foundation in Clark, The  Polish  Scouting  and  Guiding
Association (ZHP), and the Polish School at the Consulate General of the
Republic  of Poland in New York attended this touching tribute ceremony;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Tadeusz Kosciuszko was a Polish military  general  who  has
made significant contributions during the Revolutionary War, both to the
establishment  and  security  of New York and the greater United States;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout  his  time  in  the  United  States,  Kosciuszko
obtained  the  high  status of brigadier general, received United States
citizenship, and earned a medal for his commitment  to  the  Continental
Army; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Historically,  many  of  Tadeusz  Kosciuszko's  greatest
military conquests that secured  Americans  with  eternal  freedom  took
place  in  New  York, including victory in the brutal Battle of Saratoga
 
and fortification of West Point-  one  of  the  most  critical  historic
defensive  positions for the United States; his support for the American
cause during the Revolutionary War and his wisdom, integrated  with  his
military  intelligence,  was key in multiple battles against the British
that paved the way for American victory; and
 
  WHEREAS, The members of this great State and Nation shall  give  due
praise  to  this  organization  that  has  labored so conscientiously to
secure and improve the quality of life  for  the  community  it  serves,
while  upholding  important  facets  of  our  shared history, as well as
protecting  those  cultural  values  dear  to  many  New  Yorkers;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend  the  Dobra  Polska  Szkola  Foundation's  Flowers  for  Tadeusz
Kosciuszko campaign; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Dobra Polska Szkola Foundation.
