  COMMENDING  the  Korean  American  Family  Service
  Center  upon  the  occasion  of  hosting  its  34th
  Anniversary Benefit Gala on April 28, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those organizations which foster ethnic pride and enhance
the profile of cultural diversity which strengthens the  fabric  of  the
communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Korean American Family Service Center upon the occasion of
hosting its 34th Anniversary Benefit Gala on Friday, April 28, 2023,  at
Cipriani 42nd Street, Manhattan, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Korean  American  Family  Service Center (KAFSC) is a
leading, nonprofit organization  which  supports  and  empowers  adults,
youth  and  children  to  lead  safe and healthy lives based on dignity,
compassion and mutual respect; its counseling,  education  and  advocacy
programs for individuals and families in the New York Tri-State area are
provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate context; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  response  to the needs of the growing Korean immigrant
community in New York City, the Korean American  Family  Service  Center
has  evolved over the past 34 years to become a primary dual agency that
addresses domestic violence and sexual assault victims from  a  combined
prevention and intervention perspective while remaining sensitive to the
cultural setting; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Korean American Family Service Center is committed to
preventing  and  ending  domestic  violence,  sexual  assault,  and
relationship abuse while operating a 24-hour bilingual hotline; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded in 1989, the Korean American Family Service Center
began as an all-volunteer group, and the  first  anti-domestic  violence
organization  dedicated  to serving the Korean American community in the
New York Tri-State area; from small one-room beginnings  with  part-time
hours  in  a  church  basement,  KAFSC has since grown to provide a full
array of children, youth, and adult holistic services; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, KAFSC expert staff, 100% of whom are bilingual
and bicultural, personally understand immigrant family struggles and can
respond to clients with innate sensitivity; and
 
  WHEREAS, The vision of the Korean American Family Service Center  is
more  pressing  today  than  ever;  striving for a socially just society
where Korean American immigrants can fully partake as  Americans;  as  a
learning  organization,  KAFSC  utilizes  community  feedback,  program
outcomes, focus groups, and surveys to improve current  programming  and
develop new initiatives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Korean American Family Service Center is committed to
working  collaboratively  with  community  stakeholders  to  leverage
 
resources,  share  learning,  document  social  impact,  offer  thought
leadership on  issues  that  impact  new  immigrants,  and  serve  as  a
trauma-informed central hub; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Korean American Family Service Center is
in  direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of its dedicated staff, whose
involvement is, and always has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive
commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard of
excellence in all endeavors  on  behalf  of  the  organization  and  the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion presents an opportunity for this
Legislative Body to celebrate the resilience of  survivors  of  violence
who  have  successfully led new lives away from abuse, and to stand with
the Korean American Family Service Center in its  mission  to  create  a
violence-free society; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Korean American Family Service Center upon the  occasion  of
hosting  its  34th Anniversary Benefit Gala on April 28, 2023; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Korean American Family Service Center.
