 officer or employee who is subject to the provisions  of  this  section,
 the  salary  otherwise  provided for such position shall be increased in
 the same manner as though such position had been in existence but  unen-

 are  otherwise  entitled  to  receive.  The director of the budget shall
 issue certificates which shall contain schedules of  positions  and  the
 salaries  and/or  payments thereof for which adjustments and/or payments
 are made pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, and a  copy  of

 sion shall be determined on the basis  of  such  lower  graded  position

 regulation  services  negotiating unit, whose principal place of employ-
 ment or, in the case of a field  employee,  whose  official  station  as

 priations contained in this act shall be available to the state for  the
 payment  and  publication  of  grievance and arbitration settlements and
