 able person or property, or any  charge  of  criminal  possession  of  a
 firearm  as  defined  in  section  265.01-b of the penal law, where such
 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on
 [his  or  her]  SUCH DEFENDANT'S own recognizance, released under condi-
 tions, or had yet to be arraigned after the issuance of a  desk  appear-
 ance  ticket for a separate felony or class A misdemeanor involving harm
 to an identifiable  person  or  property,  or  any  charge  of  criminal
 possession of a firearm as defined in section 265.01-b of the penal law,
 provided,  however,  that  the  prosecutor must show reasonable cause to
 believe that the defendant committed the instant crime and any  underly-

 principal  shall be released on [his or her] SUCH PRINCIPAL'S own recog-
 nizance or under appropriate non-monetary conditions; [or]
