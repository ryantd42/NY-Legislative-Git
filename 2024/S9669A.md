 construed  as superseding the provisions of section four hundred thirty-
 one of this chapter, or any similar provision of law  which  limits  the
 salary  base  for  computing  retirement  benefits  payable  by a public
 retirement system.

  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census data for the emer-
 gency medical technicians assumed to elect  an  EMT  22.5-Year  Plan  is
 summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  3,657
  - Average Age:  35.6
  - Average Service:  8.6
  - Average Salary:  71,600
 
  IMPACT  ON MEMBER BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: The proposed legislation
 would provide a service retirement benefit equal to
  o 50% of Final Average Salary (FAS) for the first 22.5 years of  cred-
 itable service as an EMT member,
  o  plus  2.0%  of  Final Salary for each additional year of creditable
 service as an EMT member exceeding 22.5 years to a maximum of 5 years.
  Once a member in the EMT 22.5-Year Plan attains 22.5 years of credita-
 ble service as an EMT member, he or she would no longer be  eligible  to
 retire under his or her respective basic plan.
  The  vested  benefit under the EMT 22.5-Year Plans is equal to 2.0% of
 FAS for each year of creditable service as an EMT member.
  The retirement benefits provided by the EMT 22.5-Year Plan  would  not
 be subject to cost-of-living adjustments (COLA).
  Plan  participants would be required to pay Additional Member Contrib-
 utions (AMC) equal to 6.5% of compensation for all service on and  after
 the  starting  date of the Plan until the later of the one-year anniver-
 sary of the effective date of the Plan or 27.5 years of credited service
 as an EMT member.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of NYCERS. In addition:
  o The rates of retirement for the EMT 22.5-Year  Plans  were  assigned
 based  on  the members' eligibility to elect or opt out of the plan. The
 EMT 22.5-Year Plan is optional for  current  emergency  medical  techni-
 cians.  The EMT 22.5-Year Plan is mandatory for future emergency medical
 technicians.

  o New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll for emergency medical technicians increases by 3% each year. New
 entrant  demographics  were developed based on data for recent new hires
 and actuarial judgement. Future members will be mandated  into  the  EMT
 22.5-Year plan.
  o  For  purposes  of  this  Fiscal  Note, creditable service as an EMT
 member was assumed to include non-EMT service, due to insufficient data.
  To determine the impact of the elective nature of the proposed  legis-
 lation,  a subgroup of EMT members was developed based on who is assumed
 to benefit actuarially by comparing the  net  present  value  of  future
 employer  costs  of  each  member's benefit under their current plan and
 under the applicable EMT 22.5-Year Plan.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  data,  actuarial assumptions, methods, and models used,
 demographics of the impacted  population,  and  other  factors  such  as
 investment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates
 from  actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment  Benefits). This Fiscal Note does not reflect any chapter
 laws that may have been enacted during the current legislative session.
