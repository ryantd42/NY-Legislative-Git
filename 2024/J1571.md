  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase  awareness  of  initiatives
which better the lives of New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 10, 2024, as Encourage  a  Young
Writer Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observation
of National Encourage a Young Writer Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Writing is a form of personal freedom, allowing the author
to express their thoughts and feelings  in  their  own  imaginative  and
poetic way; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Writing  can  be  difficult  and challenging at times, but
immensely fun; Encourage a Young Writer Day is meant  to  inspire  young
people  with  a  vivid  imagination to express their ideas by developing
their writing skills; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are many ways to support a young writer such  as  buy
them  a  journal, offer writing prompts, encourage them to read, inspire
them to try multiple writing styles and different voices, and  create  a
young writer's group; and
 
  WHEREAS, In many ways, writing is an art; the arts, in whatever form
depicted, are truly central to human expression; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Academy of Young Writers, a community school located at
1065 Elton Street in Brooklyn, New York, incorporates the core values of
respect,  kindness,  safety  and  empathy  into students' scholastic and
creative pursuits; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is essential that we take  the  time  to  encourage  our
young  writers  to  convey  their personal truths about humanity, and to
express their hopes and dreams through their writing; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  10,  2024, as
Encourage a Young Writer Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be

York; and the student body, faculty and staff of The Academy  for  Young
Writers of Brooklyn, New York.
