  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  Insofar  as  it  would  affect the New York State and Local Retirement
 System (NYSLRS), this bill would allow retired police officers  who  are
 S. 6148--A  5
 
 employed by a school district as a school resource officer, school safe-
 ty  officer, school security officer, or any other substantially similar
 position with an annual salary of $50,000 or less to continue to receive
 their  full  retirement  benefit  beginning  with  calendar  year  2025.
 Currently, the salary limit is $35,000.
  Pursuant to Section 25 of the Retirement and Social Security Law,  the
 increased  costs  would  be  borne entirely by the State of New York and
 would require an itemized appropriation sufficient to pay  the  cost  of
 the provision.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), if  enacted  during  the  2024  Legislative
 Session, the direct cost incurred would be the retiree's post-retirement
 earnings  more  than  $35,000 each calendar year, not to exceed the full
 pension benefit paid by the NYSLERS during that period.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by including a
 separate itemized charge on the New York State annual invoice, equal  to
 the cost quoted above, plus interest.
  The  number  of  members  and  retirees  who could be affected by this
 legislation cannot be readily determined. For each retiree hired  pursu-
 ant to this proposal, an annual cost of $15,000 is expected.
