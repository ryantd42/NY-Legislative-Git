Patterson's rich history; and

  WHEREAS, With a primary focus on education, the Society  seeks  out,
conserves,  interprets,  and  publishes  information  about  Patterson's

Housatonic-and-Hudson-Rivers region, our Nation, and the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  its  distinguished  50-year  history,  the Patterson
Historical Society has demonstrated continuous service to the  residents
and communities which it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  the  Patterson  Historical Society is in
direct correlation to the efforts of its dedicated board members,  staff

by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an
uncompromising standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of  the
organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion presents an opportunity for this
Legislative  Body  to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  the  Patterson
Historical Society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud and distinguished history, the Patterson
Historical  Society  may take just pride in its purposeful growth, as it
