 average  salary for each year of service in excess of twenty times final
 average  salary  times  years of credited service. In no event shall any
 retirement benefit payable without optional modification  be  less  than
 the  actuarially  equivalent  annuitized  value of the member's contrib-
 utions accumulated with interest at five percent  per  annum  compounded
 annually to the date of retirement.
  § 4. Paragraph 3 of subdivision i of section 603 of the retirement and
 social  security  law,  as  added  by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, is
 amended to read as follows:
  3. A member of a public retirement system of the state who has met the
 minimum service requirement, but who is not  a  New  York  city  transit
 authority  member,  as  defined  in  paragraph  one  of subdivision a of
 section six hundred four-b of this article, may retire prior  to  normal
 retirement  age,  but  no  earlier than attainment of age fifty-five, in
 which event, the amount of his or her retirement benefit computed  with-
 out  optional  modification  shall  be  reduced  by six and one-half per
 centum for each year by which early retirement precedes age sixty-three;
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT FOR A MEMBER WHO IS A UNIFORMED COURT OFFICER OR
 PEACE OFFICER EMPLOYED BY THE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM, THE RETIREMENT BENE-
 FIT COMPUTED WITHOUT OPTIONAL MODIFICATION SHALL BE REDUCED  IN  ACCORD-
 ANCE WITH PARAGRAPH ONE OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  §  5. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall  be  subject  to  the  appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  §  6. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that the amend-
 ments to subdivision a of section 603 of the retirement and social secu-
 rity law made by section two of this act shall not affect the expiration
 of such subdivision and shall be deemed to expire therewith.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow any Tier 6 member who is a uniformed court offi-
 cer or peace officer employed by the  unified  court  system  to  retire
 without  early  age  reduction  upon  attaining  30  years of creditable
 service and age 55. It would also reduce the normal retirement age  from
 63  to  62,  and  lessen the reductions in benefits for those who retire
 prior to normal retirement age.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be borne entirely
 by  the  State  of  New  York. If this bill were enacted during the 2023
 legislative session, the increase in the present value of benefits would
 be approximately $27.2 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a past service cost to cover retrospective  benefit  increases  and  (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New York will be
 required to pay $12.2 million as of March 1, 2024.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of the
 State of New York will increase approximately 1.0%  of  billable  salary
 reported  to  the NYSLERS for the affected members, or an estimated $1.6
 million beginning in fiscal year ending March 31, 2024.  This  PERMANENT
 ANNUAL  COST  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the
 billing rate and will increase as the salary  of  the  affected  members
 increases.
 S. 5653  4
 
  These  estimated costs are based on 1,979 affected members employed by
 the Unified Court System as uniformed court officers or peace  officers,
 with annual salary of approximately $133.7 million as of March 31, 2022.
