  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April  27,  2024,  as  Children  of  the  Holocaust
  Remembrance Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious events
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  tradition,  it  is  the sense of this Legislative Body to
proclaim April 27, 2024, as Children of the Holocaust Remembrance Day in
the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the  observance  of
International Holocaust Remembrance Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  1933 to 1945, an estimated 1.5 million children, the
youth of tomorrow, were systematically executed in the Nazi Holocaust as
part of a genocide of the Jewish people, and millions  of  other  people
also perished as victims of Nazism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ghetto  residences  were  established at the onset of Nazi
invasion, the Jew and other groups were rounded up and forced into these
horrific living conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, From 1942 onwards, the ghetto program ended and inhabitants
of the ghettos were murdered at various death  camps;  because  children
were  generally  too  young  to  be  deployed as forced labor, they were
particularly vulnerable to being killed;  they  were  one  of  the  main
groups in the first deportations to killing centers or in mass shootings
near mass graves along with the elderly, the ill, and the disabled; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Children  who  were  healthy  enough  for labor were often
worked to death doing jobs to benefit the camp;  other  times,  children
were forced to do unnecessary jobs like digging ditches; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  year 2024 marks the 91st Anniversary of the beginning
of the genocide of European Jews, the bleakest, most murderous moment in
history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Holocaust  represents  the  darkest  period  in  the
civilization  of  mankind  and  must  always  be  remembered in order to
prevent its reoccurrence anywhere else in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Children of the Holocaust Remembrance  Day  is  a  day  set
aside  for  remembering  the  innocent  children  who  fell  prey to the
viciousness of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is critically important to remember the  events  of  the
Holocaust  to  ensure  that the events shall "never again" happen, which
has been the rallying cry among the Jewish people and take cognizance of
the youth that was wiped from earth for no reason  besides  bigotry  and
hatred; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In times of war and chaos, with the threat of genocide and
ethnic cleansing present in many war-torn  regions  of  the  world,  the
events  of  the  Holocaust  continue  to  be  relevant  and important to
remember so that suffering on this scale  is  prevented  from  occurring
ever again; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Knowing  that  the events and root causes of the Holocaust
must not be forgotten and the brightness that exudes from children to be
remembered and not erased and that, particularly as  survivors  diminish
in number, we must educate future generations; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  27,  2024,  as
Children  of the Holocaust Remembrance Day in the State of New York; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  The Honorable Kathy Hochul Governor of the State of New
York.
