  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and

Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Robert Shuford, a longtime resident of Hempstead, New York,
and a dedicated fixture in the community, embarked on his career journey
with Stop & Shop on September 30, 2001; and
 
  WHEREAS, From the outset, Robert Shuford exhibited  an  unparalleled
work  ethic,  earning the role of night crew chief through his assiduous
dedication to excellence; his commitment to  doing  his  best  in  every
endeavor  foreshadowed the extraordinary heroism he would display on May
25, 2023, a day that would etch his name into the annals of local  lore;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  that  fateful  day, as Robert Shuford prepared to open
Stop & Shop, a sudden  and  ominous  sound  shattered  the  tranquility;
without  hesitation,  he  followed  the  clamor  to  its  source and was
confronted with a scene of chaos - an  overturned  semi-truck  emanating
billows of black smoke; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Responding  without  hesitation,  Robert  Shuford,
unflinchingly pressed forward; undeterred by  the  potential  peril,  he

affected by the accident, as he drew closer to the overturned truck,  he
discovered the injured driver and promptly offered his assistance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  His  selfless  actions  did  not  go unnoticed, and Robert
Shuford was rightfully recognized as  a  local  hero  by  Nassau  County
Executive  Bruce  Blakeman;  to  honor  his  valor,  June  15, 2023, was
declared Robert Shuford Day, a testament to his  courage  and  community
spirit; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Beyond his heroic feat, Robert Shuford is deeply ingrained

on the lives of those around them; and

others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily

help; now, therefore, be it
