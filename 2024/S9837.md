  Section 1. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of subdivision 3 of section 9-209 of
 the  election  law,  as  amended by chapter 474 of the laws of 2023, are
 amended to read as follows:
  (d) The voter may cure the aforesaid defects by filing a  duly  signed
 affirmation  attesting  to  the  same information required by the ballot
 affirmation envelope and attesting that the signer of the affirmation is
 the same person who submitted such ballot envelope;  provided,  however,
 that  for the defect described in subparagraph (vii) of paragraph (b) of
 this subdivision, such affirmation shall  also  include  an  attestation
 that  the  voter  mailed the ballot envelope on or before the day of the
 election. The board shall include a form of such  affirmation  with  the
 notice  to  the  voter. The affirmation shall be in a form prescribed by
 the state board of elections, AND WITH SUCH  AFFIRMATION  THE  BOARD  OF
 ELECTIONS  SHALL  PROVIDE  TO  THE  VOTER A DOMESTIC POSTAGE PAID RETURN

 ELECTIONS  IN  PERSON, BY MAIL OR IN ELECTRONIC FORM AS AN ATTACHMENT TO
 AN EMAIL. SUCH CURE AFFIRMATION MAY ALSO BE PROVIDED  TO  THE  BOARD  OF
 ELECTIONS  AS AN UPLOADED ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT IF SUCH BOARD OF ELECTIONS
 PROVIDES SUCH FUNCTIONALITY. THE CURE AFFIRMATION, WHETHER IN  PAPER  OR
 ELECTRONIC  FORM,  SHALL INCLUDE THE SIGNATURE OF THE VOTER DULY AFFIXED
 TO THE APPROPRIATELY COMPLETED CURE AFFIRMATION FORM.
  (e) Such cure affirmation shall be received by the board no later than
