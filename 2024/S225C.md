  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing  an amendment to article 1 of the constitution, in relation to
  the abolition of slavery for persons convicted of crimes
 
  Section 1. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That article  1  of  the
 constitution be amended by adding a new section 20 to read as follows:
  §  20.  ABOLITION  OF SLAVERY FOR PERSONS CONVICTED OF CRIMES. NEITHER
 SLAVERY NOR INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE SHALL EXIST IN THE STATE OF  NEW  YORK
 FOR  PERSONS  CONVICTED  OF  CRIMES.  NO INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL IN ANY
 STATE OR LOCAL  PRISON,  PENITENTIARY,  JAIL  OR  REFORMATORY  SHALL  BE
 COMPELLED  OR INDUCED TO PROVIDE LABOR AGAINST HIS OR HER WILL BY ACTUAL
 OR THREATENED FORCE, PUNISHMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULT, OR BY ANY  OTHER  MEANS
 REASONABLY  LIKELY  TO CAUSE THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL TO BELIEVE THAT
 IF THEY DO NOT PROVIDE SUCH LABOR THAT  THEY  OR  ANOTHER  PERSON  WOULD
 SUFFER  PHYSICAL,  EMOTIONAL  OR  MENTAL  HARM,  OR OTHER ADVERSE CONSE-
 QUENCES.  THIS SECTION SHALL BE SELF-EXECUTING.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That the foregoing be referred
 to the first  regular  legislative  session  convening  after  the  next
 succeeding general election of members of the assembly, and, in conform-
 ity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3
 months previous to the time of such election.
