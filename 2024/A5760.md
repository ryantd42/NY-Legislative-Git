  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. There is hereby established within the office of the state
 comptroller a working group to be known as the "separate states  working
 group".  The  working group shall conduct a study examining dividing New
 York into separate states by having the counties of Nassau and  Suffolk,
 hereinafter  referred to as "Long Island", become a separate state. Such
 study shall include, but not be limited to:
  (a) a cost benefit analysis of separating New York into  two  separate
 states,  including,  but  not  limited to, economic opportunity for both
 areas;
  (b) the legal ramifications of separating New York into  two  separate
 states;
  (c) the general up-front cost associated with separating New York into
 two  separate states, exclusive of the long-term economic ramifications,
 including, but not limited to the cost of creating two new state govern-
 ments, the separation of the physical and organizational infrastructure,
 and the cost of settling land disputes;
  (d) the constitutional steps necessary to separate New York  into  two
 separate states; and
  (e)  any constitutional precedents in the United States for dividing a
 state into two separate states.
  § 2. The working group shall consist of the following:
  (a) the state comptroller and his or her designee;
  (b) one member appointed by the comptroller;

  § 3. At the conclusion of the study, the working group will deliver  a
 report of its findings to the governor, the speaker of the assembly, the
 temporary  president of the senate, the minority leader of the assembly,
 the minority leader of the senate and the comptroller. Such report shall
 be submitted no later than twelve months following the effective date of
 this act.
  § 4. The members and staff personnel of the  separate  states  working
 group shall serve without compensation, but shall be eligible to receive
 reimbursement  for  their  reasonable,  actual  and  necessary expenses,
 provided however, members of the working group representing state  agen-
 cies  may  receive reimbursement for their actual and necessary expenses
 from their respective agencies. Members of the separate  states  working
 group  shall  be considered state employees for the purposes of sections
 17 and 19 of the public officers law.
  § 5. For the purposes of this act, the comptroller  may  conduct  such
 study in conjunction with any other department, division, board, bureau,
 commission,  agency,  or  public  authority of the state he or she deems
 necessary. To the maximum extent  feasible,  the  comptroller  shall  be
 authorized  to  request, receive, and utilize such resources and data of
 any other department, division, board, bureau,  commission,  agency,  or
 public  authority  of  the  state as he or she may reasonably request to
 properly carry out his or her powers and duties pursuant to this act.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed two years after such date.
