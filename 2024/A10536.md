 Introduced  by COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Braunstein)
  -- read once and referred to the Committee on Real Property Taxation
 
 AN ACT to amend the real property tax law, in relation  to  establishing
  an  abatement  and  exemption  from  real  property  taxes for capital
  improvements to reduce carbon emissions; and providing for the  repeal
  of such provisions upon expiration thereof

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. New York's nation leading climate  law,
 the  climate  leadership  and  community protection act of 2019 (CLCPA),
 requires the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 40  percent
 below  1990  levels  by  2030, and 85 percent below 1990 levels by 2050,
 among other goals. At the same time, New York city's local law number 97
 for the year 2019 requires buildings over 25,000 square feet  to  reduce
 their  carbon  emissions to comply with increasingly stringent emissions
 limits. While New York's  building  stock  accounts  for  more  than  25
 percent  of  statewide  greenhouse gas emissions and transportation is a
 top emitter, in New York city that ratio  is  reversed,  with  buildings
 accounting  for approximately 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. As
 such, reaching the state and city's climate goals will  require  signif-
 icant investment to decarbonize buildings including through electrifica-
 tion,  energy  efficiency,  and  the  use of new technologies and energy
 sources. The use of this targeted abatement, which would be available to
 support all property owners that are meaningfully  engaged  in  reducing
 carbon  emissions will ensure the success of the CLCPA and local law 97.
 This legislation will benefit all  New  Yorkers  by  ensuring  that  our
 buildings can play a vital role in decarbonization.
  §  2.  The  real  property  tax law is amended by adding a new section
 488-b to read as follows:
  § 488-B. ABATEMENT AND EXEMPTION FROM REAL PROPERTY TAXES FOR  CAPITAL
 IMPROVEMENTS TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. 1. ANY CITY HAVING A POPULATION
 OF  ONE  MILLION  OR MORE, ACTING THROUGH ITS LOCAL LEGISLATIVE BODY, IS
 AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED TO DETERMINE THAT INCENTIVES  IN  THE  FORM  OF
 ABATEMENT  AND/OR  EXEMPTION  OF  REAL  PROPERTY  TAXES ARE NECESSARY TO
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
