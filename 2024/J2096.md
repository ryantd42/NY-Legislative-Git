  and dedicated member of his community
 
  WHEREAS, There are certain outstanding members of our community who,
through their selfless commitment and dedication, have served to  better
the  quality of life in our community and have had a measurable positive
impact on the lives of its residents; Robert Francis Finch Jr.  was  one
such individual; and

Legislative Body records the passing of Robert Francis Finch Jr., noting
the significance of his purposeful life and accomplishments; and
 
  WHEREAS, Robert Francis Finch Jr. of Patterson, New  York,  died  on

and Robert Finch Sr.; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  honorably  serving  his  country as a member of the
United States Navy from 1977 to 1981, Robert Francis Finch Jr. worked as
a truck driver for Teamsters Local 456 in Elmsford, New York, and  as  a
licensed  plumber;  he took great pride in his work and was always happy
to use his many skill sets to help a friend or neighbor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  steadfast  and  unwavering  commitment  to  his
community,  Robert  Francis Finch Jr., was a member of the Brewster Elks
Lodge No.  2101; he also enjoyed spending time with the members  of  the
Sergeant  Ronald  Grey  American  Legion  Post  No. 1542, the Iron Order
Motorcycle Club, as well as Various Softball teams over the years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Robert Francis Finch Jr., was locally renowned for his neon
green Ram, and was often seen throughout his community in a  fresh  pair
of  sneakers  and  a  backward  hat; he enjoyed playing golf, riding his
motorcycle, Sundays with fish soup and a Clive  Cussler  Novel,  paella,
football  squares  and  repeatedly  calling  his  kids  for  the winning
numbers, oysters, and the Miami Dolphins; and
 
  WHEREAS, Robert Francis Finch Jr. is survived by his  parents,  Lynn

beloved grandson; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Robert  Francis  Finch  Jr.'s  infinite  selflessness  and
benevolence will shine on through his family's vivid and happy memories;
his insight and strength will forever serve as a beacon of  love,  light
and hope to the countless lives she touched; and

an ear will be missed  almost  as  much  as  his  timely  sarcasm;  this
well-loved  father, respected veteran and wholeheartedly selfless friend
will indeed not be forgotten; his spirit will continue  to  inspire  all
who were fortunate to have known him; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to

condolences to his family; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
