Assembly Resolution No. 951

  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 15, 2024, as Stiff Person  Syndrome  Awareness
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 15, 2024, as Stiff
Person Syndrome Awareness Day in the State of New York,  in  conjunction
with  the  observance  of  International Stiff Person Syndrome Awareness
Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Stiff Person Syndrome  (SPS)  is  a  disorder  that  causes
stiffness when the muscles in the body contract and spasm involuntarily;
individuals  affected  by  this  disorder  cannot control or predict the
movement of their bodies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Stiff Person Syndrome is characterized by these  persistent
or  intermittent  muscle contractions or spasms, causing abnormal, often
repetitive, movements, postures, or  both;  the  movements  are  usually
patterned and twisting and may resemble a tremor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  spasms  can  occur in episodes, particularly when a
person with SPS is surprised or startled, moves suddenly, or experiences
cold temperatures or emotional stress; in some individuals,  the  spasms
are induced by certain exercises or touch; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Symptoms  may  affect  a specific part of the body or many
parts simultaneously; at times, these manifestations may be painful; and
 
  WHEREAS, The cause of Stiff Person Syndrome is unknown;  researchers
believe  it  results  from  antibodies  blocking  the  glutamic  acid
decarboxylase  (GAD)  enzyme  which  aids  in  manufacturing  the
gamma-aminobutyric  acid (GABA) neurotransmitter; GABA reduces or blocks
certain nerve signals, and without the proper amount, the nervous system
becomes hyperexcitable; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  North  America,  Stiff  Person  Syndrome  is  a  rare
neurological  disorder,  affecting  approximately one to two individuals
per one million; this disorder does  not  discriminate,  affecting  men,
women, and children of all ages and backgrounds; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There is no cure for Stiff Person Syndrome; working with a
specialist  and  maintaining  symptom  control  with  therapies  and
medications can make it easier to live with the condition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase research at
the local, state, and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 15, 2024, as Stiff
Person Syndrome Awareness Day in the  State  of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
