  CENSUS  DATA:  The  number  of members who will purchase an additional

 herein  are  based  on  preliminary census data collected as of June 30,
 2023. The census data for the potentially impacted  population  used  to
 develop the average costs in this Fiscal Note is based on active members
 who have already purchased three years of military service and is summa-
 rized below.
 
  NYCRS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  461
  - Average Age:  49.3
  - Average Service:  17.1
  - Average Salary:  117,900

  IMPACT ON MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS: Eligible NYCRS members are required to
 contribute,  for  each year of military service purchased, 3% (or 6% for
 members who first join on or after  April  1,  2012)  of  such  member's
 compensation earned during the 12 months of credited service immediately
 preceding the date the member applies for military service credit.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  The  number  of  members  who  will  benefit  in  the future from this
 proposed legislation is unknown. The cost of this  proposed  legislation
 could vary greatly depending on the number of future members who benefit
 and, on their plan, length of service, age, and salary history.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: Marek Tyszkiewicz and Gregory Zelikov-
 sky  are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of
 Actuaries. We are members of NYCERS but do not believe  it  impairs  our
 objectivity  and  we  meet  the  Qualification Standards of the American
 Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained  herein.
 To  the  best  of  our knowledge, the results contained herein have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles  and
 procedures  and  with  the Actuarial Standards of Practice issued by the
 Actuarial Standards Board.
  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note 2024-24 dated  March  11,
 2024  was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
 A. 5936--B  4
 
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would amend the current military law to allow for a member
 to obtain up to a total of four years of service credit for up  to  four
 years  of  military  duty  if  the  member was honorably discharged. The
 current maximum is three years of service credit. Members must  have  at
 least  five  years of credited service (not including military service).
 Tier 1-5 members would be required to make a payment of three percent of
 their most recent compensation per year  of  additional  service  credit
 granted by this bill. Tier 6 members would be required to make a payment
 of  six percent of their most recent compensation per year of additional
 service credit. Portions of the bill would become effective on  November
 10, 2023.
  Insofar  as this proposal affects the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees' Retirement System (NYSLERS), all costs would be shared by the State
 of New York and the local participating employers  in  the  NYSLERS.  If
 enacted  during  the  2024 Legislative Session, it is estimated that the
 past service cost will be 18% (15% for Tier 6) of an  affected  member's
 compensation for each year of service credit that is purchased.
  Insofar  as  this proposal affects the New York State and Local Police
 and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), all costs would be shared by  the
 State of New York and the local participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
 If enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, it is estimated that the
 past  service  cost will be 23% (20% for Tier 6) of an affected member's
 compensation for each year of service credit that is purchased.
  Further, we anticipate some additional administrative costs to  imple-
 ment the provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number of current and future members who could be affected
 by this legislation cannot be readily determined. Through  December  31,
 2023, approximately 11,200 members have purchased military service cred-
 it  pursuant  to  Chapter  41  of the Laws of 2016, with a total cost of
 approximately $400 million. It is estimated that, had this proposal been
 law  since  2016,  approximately  7,700  of  these  members  could  have
 purchased  a  fourth  year  of military service credit for an additional
 cost of approximately $110 million.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership data as of March 31, 2023 was used in measuring the  impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2023 actuari-
 al  valuation.  Distributions  and  other statistics can be found in the
 2023 Report of the Actuary and the 2023 Annual  Comprehensive  Financial
 Report.
