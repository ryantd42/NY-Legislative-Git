  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation, as it relates to members
 of the New York City Retirement Systems and Pension Funds (NYCRS), would
 amend Retirement and Social Security Law Section 1000  to  increase  the
 maximum  number  of  years  of military duty service credit that a NYCRS
 member may purchase from three years to four.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  BACKGROUND: Currently, members of NYCRS may obtain service credit  for
 up  to  three  years of military duty upon application to the respective
 retirement system. Under the proposed legislation, the maximum number of
 such years that a NYCRS member may  purchase  would  be  increased  from
 three years to four years.
  Once  purchased,  eligible military service may increase pension bene-
 fits  in  addition  to  counting  towards  meeting  minimum  eligibility
 requirements.
  MEMBER  CONTRIBUTIONS: Eligible NYCRS members are required to contrib-
 ute, for each year of military service purchased, 3% (or 6% for  members
 who  first join on or after April 1, 2012) of such member's compensation
 earned during the 12 months of credited  service  immediately  preceding
 the date the member applies for military service credit.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on census data and the actu-
 arial assumptions and methods described herein, the  enactment  of  this
 proposed legislation would increase the present value of future employer
 contributions  by  approximately  $18,400,  on average, for each year of
 military service purchased above three years and not greater  than  four
 years.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: Enactment of this
 proposed legislation would increase employer contributions,  where  such
 amount  would  depend on the number of members affected as well as other
 characteristics including the age, years of service, and salary  history
 of each member.
  Based  on  the actuarial assumptions and methods described herein, the
 enactment of this proposed legislation is estimated to  increase  annual
 employer contributions by approximately $2,200 for each year of eligible
 military service purchased.
  As there is limited data currently available to estimate the number of
 members  who  might  purchase  between  three and four years of military
 service, the financial impact would be recognized at the  time  of  each
 event.  Changes  in  employer contributions have been estimated assuming
 that the increase in the present value of future employer  contributions
 will  be  financed  over  a closed 15-year period (14 payments under the
 One-Year Lag Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  With respect to the timing, increases in employer contributions  would
 depend  upon when members purchase eligible military service but, gener-
 ally, increased employer  contributions  will  first  occur  the  second
 fiscal year following the year in which service is purchased.
 A. 5936--A  3
 
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data of NYCRS members who have purchased up to three years  of  military
 service under Chapter 41 of the Laws of 2016 as of June 30, 2021.
  There is insufficient data available to estimate the number of members
 who  have more than three years of qualifying military service and could
 therefore potentially benefit from this proposed legislation. Therefore,
 the estimated financial impact has been calculated on a per event  basis
 equal  to  the increase in the present value of future employer contrib-
 utions for an average NYCRS member who has purchased an additional  year
 of  qualifying  military  service  under Chapter 41 of the Laws of 2016,
 which is currently limited to three years.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCRS.
  Most  of  the  additional  contributions  associated with NYCRS active
 members who purchase service for military duty above  three  years,  but
 less  than  four  years,  are  expected  to be made to the New York City
 Police Pension Fund.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population, and other factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  *  The  impact  of  this  proposed legislation on Other Postemployment
 Benefit costs.
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: I, Marek  Tyszkiewicz,  am  the  Chief
 Actuary  for,  and  independent of, the New York City Retirement Systems
 and Pension Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries  and  a
 Member of the American Academy of Actuaries. I am a member of NYCERS but
 do  not  believe  it impairs my objectivity and I meet the Qualification
 Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries to render  the  actuarial
 opinion  contained  herein.  To  the  best  of my knowledge, the results
 contained  herein  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally
 accepted  actuarial  principles  and  procedures  and with the Actuarial
 Standards of Practice issued by the Actuarial Standards Board.
  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note  2023-60  dated  May  26,
 2023  was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2023 Legislative Session.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend the current military law to allow for  a  member
 to  obtain  up to a total of four years of service credit for up to four
 years of military duty if  the  member  was  honorably  discharged.  The
 current  maximum  is three years of service credit. Members must have at
 least five years of credited service (not including  military  service).
 Tier 1-5 members would be required to make a payment of three percent of
 their  most  recent  compensation  per year of additional service credit
 granted by this bill. Tier 6 members would be required to make a payment
 A. 5936--A  4
 
 of six percent of their most recent compensation per year of  additional
 service credit.
  Insofar  as this proposal affects the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees' Retirement System (NYSLERS), all costs would be shared by the State
 of New York and the local participating employers  in  the  NYSLERS.  If
 enacted  during  the  2023 legislative session, it is estimated that the
 past service cost will be 18% (15% for Tier 6) of an  affected  member's
 compensation for each year of service credit that is purchased.
  Insofar  as  this proposal affects the New York State and Local Police
 and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), all costs would be shared by  the
 State of New York and the local participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
 If enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it is estimated that the
 past  service  cost will be 23% (20% for Tier 6) of an affected member's
 compensation for each year of service credit that is purchased.
  Further, we anticipate some additional administrative costs to  imple-
 ment the provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the  impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2022 actuari-
 al  valuation.  Distributions  and  other statistics can be found in the
 2022 Report of the Actuary and the 2022 Annual  Comprehensive  Financial
 Report.
  The  actuarial assumptions and methods used are described in the 2020,
 2021, and 2022 Annual Report to the  Comptroller  on  Actuarial  Assump-
 tions,  and  the  Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York:
 Audit and Control.

 fication Standards to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate, dated April 21, 2023, and intended for use only during
 the 2023 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2023-140,  prepared  by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend  subdivisions  1 and 4 of Section 1000 of the
 Retirement and Social Security Law to increase  the  maximum  number  of
 years  of  military  service  credit to four that a member may purchase.
 Currently, a member can purchase up to three years of  military  service
 credit provided such member did not receive a dishonorable discharge and
 was not discharged for bad conduct. To obtain such credit, a member must
 make  payments  as required by Section 1000 of the Retirement and Social
 Security Law. Tiers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 members are required to  pay  three
 percent  of  salary  earned during the twelve months of credited service
 immediately preceding the year in which a claim is made for each year of
 military service. Tier 6 members are required  to  pay  six  percent  of
 salary  earned  during the twelve months of credited service immediately
 preceding the year in which a claim is made for each  year  of  military
 service.
  It  is  not  possible  to determine the number of eligible current and
 future members, or the additional military service  credit  each  member
 A. 5936--A  5
 
 may  purchase under this bill. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate
 the annual increase in the  employers'  cost  for  this  bill.  Whatever
 increase  in liability arises for service credited under this bill above
 that  paid for by the member would be included in the cost that would be
 shared by employers through the employer contribution rate.
  It is estimated that the cost, expressed as a percentage of a member's
 salary for the additional year of  service  credit  a  member  purchases
 under this bill is as follows:
  Cost per year of Service Purchased (as a percentage of the member's
 salary)
  Tier(s)  1-4  5  6
  Cost  12.7%  11.4%  9.5%
  Member Contribution  3.0%  3.0%  6.0%
  offset
  Net cost to  9.7%  8.4%  3.5%
  participating
  employers
