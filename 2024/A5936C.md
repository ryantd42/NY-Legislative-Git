  tee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  increasing the amount of years of military service credit a member may
  purchase
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Subdivisions 1 and 4 of section 1000 of the retirement and
 social security law, as amended by chapter 41 of the laws of  2016,  are
 amended to read as follows:
  1.  A member, upon application to such retirement system, may obtain a
 total not to exceed [three] FOUR years  of  service  credit  for  up  to
 [three]  FOUR  years of military duty, as defined in section two hundred
 forty-three of the military law, if the member was honorably  discharged
 from the military.
  4. In no event shall the credit granted pursuant to this section, when
 added  to credit granted for military service with any retirement system
 of this state pursuant to this or any other provision of law,  exceed  a
 total of [three] FOUR years.
  §  2. Subdivision 1 of section 1000 of the retirement and social secu-
 rity law, as amended by chapter 585 of the laws of 2022, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  1.  A member, upon application to such retirement system, may obtain a
 total not to exceed [three] FOUR years  of  service  credit  for  up  to
 [three]  FOUR  years of military duty, as defined in section two hundred
 forty-three of the  military  law,  if  the  member  (a)  was  honorably

 received  a  discharge  other than bad conduct or dishonorable from such

 three  hundred  fifty of the executive law, and has received a discharge
 other than bad conduct or dishonorable from such service.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that section two
 of this act shall take effect on the same date and in the same manner as
 chapter 585 of the laws of 2022, takes effect.
  FISCAL NOTE.-Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would amend the current military law to allow for a member
 to obtain up to a total of four years of service credit for up  to  four
 years  of  military  duty  if  the  member was honorably discharged. The
 current maximum is three years of service credit. Members must  have  at
 least  five  years of credited service (not including military service).
 Tier 1-5 members would be required to make a payment of three percent of
 their most recent compensation per year  of  additional  service  credit
 granted by this bill. Tier 6 members would be required to make a payment
 of  six percent of their most recent compensation per year of additional
 service credit.
  Insofar as this proposal affects the New York State and Local  Employ-
 ees'  Retirement System (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25 of the Retire-
 ment and Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entire-
 ly by the State of New York and would require an itemized  appropriation
 sufficient  to pay the cost of the provision. If enacted during the 2023
 legislative session, it is estimated that the past service cost will  be
 18%  (15% for Tier 6) of an affected member's compensation for each year
 of service credit that is purchased.
  Insofar as this proposal affects the New York State and  Local  Police
 and  Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), all costs would be shared by the
 State of New York and the local participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
 If enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it is estimated that the
 past service cost will be 23% (20% for Tier 6) of an  affected  member's
 compensation for each year of service credit that is purchased.
  Further,  we anticipate some additional administrative costs to imple-
 ment the provisions of this legislation.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
