 AN ACT to amend the transportation law, in relation to the  purchase  of
  zero-emission  buses;  to  amend  the  public  authorities law and the
  general municipal law, in relation to the procurement of electric-pow-
  ered buses, vehicles or other related  equipment;  and  to  amend  the

  to  charging  of  electric  buses  and  a tariff for zero-emission bus
  charging
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative intent. In 2019, New York enacted the Climate
 Leadership and Community Protection Act to reduce the state's volume  of
 greenhouse  gas  emissions by at least 85% as compared to 1990 levels by
 the year 2050.  According to the Climate Action  Council  Scoping  Plan,
 the  transportation  sector  is responsible for approximately 28% of New
 York's total greenhouse gas emissions. Statewide  conversion  of  public
 transit  bus  fleets  is  an important undertaking required to meet this
 emission reduction mandate.
  The legislature recognizes that such a conversion will  entail  fiscal
 obligations  on  the  part  of  transit systems and utility providers in
 order to purchase new buses, renovate  or  replace  bus  depots,  expand
 utility  infrastructure  and  generation  capacity,  and other necessary
 investments to ensure reliable delivery of zero-emission  bus  services.
 Furthermore,  the legislature recognizes that there are existing revenue
 sources which currently fund public transit that rely on the consumption

 of fossil fuels and which will diminish as  the  number  of  gas-powered
 cars decreases.
  It is the expectation of the legislature that there will be sufficient
 funding  to  support a statewide conversion of public transit bus fleets
 to zero-emission buses, including continued federal support such as what
 has been provided in the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infras-
 tructure Law, the Low or No Emission Vehicle Program, the  Diesel  Emis-
 sions  Reduction  Act,  and  other  federal funding programs, as well as
 state and miscellaneous funding such  as  the  New  York  Truck  Voucher
 Incentive Program and the Volkswagen Clean Air Act Civil Settlement.
  Additionally,  the  legislature  recognizes that current zero-emission
 bus technology is still developing, particularly with respect to  travel
 range,  cold  weather  performance,  and bus availability. Technological
 advances will continue accelerating leading up to and during the covered
 period for zero-emission bus fleet conversion.  Finally,  one  of  the
 greatest  harms  to local communities are localized emissions which have
 an acutely negative impact, particularly to disadvantaged communities as
 defined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.  There-
 fore  a  coordinated  statewide  effort  to  purchase,  manufacture, and
 utilize zero-emission buses and paratransit vehicles will  help  facili-
 tate  technological  advancement,  reduce overall costs, and help reduce
 harm to our local communities.
  § 2. The transportation law is amended by adding a new section 17-c to
 read as follows:
  § 17-C. ZERO-EMISSION BUSES. 1. NO LATER THAN JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOU-
