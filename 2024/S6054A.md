  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would permit members of the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees'  Retirement  System employed as security hospital treatment assist-
 ants by the Office of  Mental  Health  a  one-time  election  to  choose
 between  coverage  under  an  Age-55 plan or a 25-year service plan. Any
 such election will be irrevocable and the member will forfeit all rights
 and privileges of their current plan.  Currently,  members  so  employed
 must  elect  plan coverage within one year from their employment in such
 title.  This bill has a sunset provision of 180 days.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $2.4  million  in
 the  annual  contributions  of the State of New York for the fiscal year
 ending March 31, 2025. In future  years  this  cost  will  vary  but  is
 expected to average 2.7% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $22.1 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
  These estimated costs are based on 689 affected  members  employed  by
 the  Office  of  Mental  Health  with annual salary of approximately $79
 million as of March 31, 2023.
