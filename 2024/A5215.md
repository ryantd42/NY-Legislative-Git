 provision of financial assistance  pursuant  to  section  eight  hundred
 fifty-nine-a  of  this  [chapter] TITLE and shall provide guidelines for

 claimed; procedures for payments in lieu of taxes and instances in which
 real property appraisals are to be performed as a part of an application
 for  tax  exemption; in addition, agencies shall in adopting such policy
 consider such issues as: the extent to which a project  will  create  or
 retain  permanent,  private  sector jobs; the estimated value of any tax
 exemptions to be provided; whether affected tax jurisdictions  shall  be
 reimbursed  by  the  project  occupant if a project does not fulfill the
 purposes for which an exemption was provided; the impact of  a  proposed
 project  on  existing  and  proposed businesses and economic development
 projects in the vicinity; the amount of private sector investment gener-
 ated or likely to be generated by the proposed project; the demonstrated
 public support for the proposed project; the likelihood of accomplishing
 the proposed project in a timely fashion; the  effect  of  the  proposed
 project  upon  the  environment;  the  extent  to which the project will
 utilize, to the fullest extent practicable  and  economically  feasible,

 resource conservation, energy efficiency, green technologies, and alter-
 native  and  renewable energy measures; the extent to which the proposed
 project will require the provision of  additional  services,  including,
 but not limited to additional educational, transportation, police, emer-
 gency  medical  or  fire  services; and the extent to which the proposed
 project will provide additional sources of  revenue  for  municipalities
 and  school  districts.  THE ADOPTED UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY

 GOVERNING  BODY  OF  EACH  AFFECTED  TAX  JURISDICTION AND SHALL BE MADE
 AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION AT THE AGENCY'S OFFICE AND ON THE  AGEN-
 CY'S WEBSITE UPON ITS ADOPTION.
  (b)  The agency shall [establish a procedure] ADOPT CRITERIA for devi-
 ation from the  uniform  [tax  exemption]  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  policy
 required  pursuant  to  this  subdivision, WHICH SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE
 APPROVAL OF ALL AFFECTED LOCAL TAX JURISDICTIONS. The agency  shall  set
 forth  in  writing the reasons for deviation from such policy, and shall
 further notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the affected
 local taxing jurisdictions of the proposed deviation  from  such  policy
 and  the reasons therefor NOT LESS THAN SIXTY DAYS BEFORE SUCH DEVIATION
 FROM THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  POLICY  TAKES  EFFECT.  When  the
 affected  local  taxing  jurisdiction  is  a school district, the agency
 shall notify by certified mail, return  receipt  requested,  the  school
 board and district superintendent of each affected school district.
  §  10. Section 1953 of the public authorities law, as added by chapter
 759 of the laws of 1967,  the  opening  paragraph,  second  undesignated
 paragraph,  and  subdivisions  4  and 7 as amended by chapter 579 of the
 laws of 2021, subdivision 8 as amended,  subdivision  14  as  added  and
 subdivisions 15 and 16 as renumbered by chapter 356 of the laws of 1993,
 and subdivisions 9 and 13 as amended by chapter 907 of the laws of 1972,
 is amended to read as follows:
  § 1953. Purpose and powers of the authority.
  The  purposes of the authority shall be to promote, develop, encourage
 and assist in the acquiring,  constructing,  reconstructing,  improving,
 maintaining,  equipping  and furnishing industrial, manufacturing, ware-
 house, CIVIC FACILITIES, commercial and  research  facilities  including
 industrial  pollution  control  facilities,  transportation  facilities
 including but not limited to those relating to water, highway, rail  and
 air,  in one or more areas of the city, particularly but not exclusively
 at the site of what was formerly the Troy airport including an  airstrip
 or  airport  located  in  the  southern  section of the city and thereby
 advance the job opportunities, health, general prosperity  and  economic
 welfare  of  the  people  of  said city and to improve their standard of
 living; provided, however, that the authority shall  not  undertake  any
 project  if  the  completion  thereof  would result in the removal of an
 industrial or manufacturing plant of the project occupant from one  area
 of  the  state to another area of the state or in the abandonment of one
 or more plants or facilities of the project applicant located within the
 state, provided, however, that neither restriction shall  apply  if  the
 authority shall determine on the basis of the application before it that
 the  project  is reasonably necessary to discourage the project occupant
 from removing such other plant or facility to  a  location  outside  the
 state or is reasonably necessary to preserve the competitive position of
 the  project  occupant  in  its respective industry. Except as otherwise
 provided for in this section, no financial assistance of  the  authority
 shall be provided in respect of any project where facilities or property
 that  are  primarily  used  in  making  retail  sales  to  customers who
 A. 5215  11
 
 personally visit such facilities constitute more than one-third  of  the
 total  project  cost.  For  the purposes of this article, "retail sales"
 shall mean: (i) sales by a registered vendor under article  twenty-eight
 of the tax law primarily engaged in the retail sale of tangible personal
 property,  as  defined in subparagraph (i) of paragraph four of subdivi-
 sion (b) of section eleven hundred one of the tax law; or (ii) sales  of
 a  service  to such customers. Except, however, that tourism destination
 projects shall not be prohibited by this paragraph. For the  purpose  of
 this  paragraph, "tourism destination" shall mean a location or facility
 which is likely to attract a significant number of visitors from outside
 the economic development region as established by  section  two  hundred
 thirty of the economic development law in which the project is located.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of this section to the contrary, such
 financial assistance may, however, be provided to a project where facil-
 ities or property that are primarily used  in  making  retail  sales  of
 goods  or  services to customers who personally visit such facilities to
 obtain such goods or services constitute  more  than  one-third  of  the
 total  project  cost,  where: (i) the predominant purpose of the project
 would be to make available goods or services which would  not,  but  for
 the  project,  be  reasonably accessible to the residents of the city of
 Troy because of a lack of reasonably accessible retail trade  facilities
 offering  such  goods  or  services; or (ii) the project is located in a
 highly distressed area. With respect to projects authorized pursuant  to
 this  paragraph  no project shall be approved unless the authority shall
 find after the public hearing required by section  twenty-three  hundred
 seven of this chapter that undertaking the project will serve the public
 purposes of this article by preserving permanent, private sector jobs or
 increasing  the  overall number of permanent, private sector jobs in the
 state. Where the authority makes such  a  finding,  prior  to  providing
 financial  assistance  to the project by the authority, the chief execu-
 tive officer of the city of Troy shall confirm the  proposed  action  of
 the  authority.  To  carry  out  said purposes, the authority shall have
 power:
  1. To sue and be sued;
  2. To have a seal and alter the same at pleasure;
  3. To acquire, hold and dispose of personal property for its corporate
 purpose;
  4. To acquire by purchase, grant, lease, gift, condemnation, or other-
 wise and to use, real property or rights or easements therein  necessary
 for  its  corporate  purposes,  and  to  sell,  convey, mortgage, lease,
 pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose  of  any  such  property  in  such
 manner  as  the authority shall determine. With respect to real property
 conveyed to it by the city, however, such power of disposition shall  be
 limited  as  hereinafter provided in section nineteen hundred fifty-five
 of this title;
  5.  TO ACQUIRE REAL PROPERTY WITHIN THE CITY OF TROY AS NECESSARY  FOR
 ITS  CORPORATE  PURPOSES PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY-EIGHT-C
 OF THE GENERAL MUNICIPAL LAW;
  6. To make by-laws for the management and regulation  of  its  affairs
 and,  subject  to agreements with its bondholders, for the regulation of
 the use of the project;
  [6.] 7. With the consent of the city, to  use  agents,  employees  and
 facilities  of  the  city,  paying the city its agreed proportion of the
 compensation or costs;
  [7.] 8. To appoint officers, agents and employees, to prescribe  their
 qualifications  and to fix their compensation and to pay the same out of
 A. 5215  12
 
 funds of the authority, subject, however, to the provisions of the civil
 service law as hereinafter provided in section nineteen  hundred  fifty-
 four of this title;
  [8.]  9. To appoint an attorney, who may be the corporation counsel of
 the city, and to fix the  attorney's  compensation  for  services  which
 shall  be  payable  to  the  attorney,  and to retain and employ private
 consultants  for  professional  and  technical  assistance  and  advice;
 provided that an attorney acting as bond counsel for a project must file
 with  the authority a written statement in which the attorney identifies
 each party to the transaction which such attorney  represents.  If  bond
 counsel provides any legal services to parties other than the authority,
 the  written  statement  must  describe  the  nature  of  legal services
 provided by such bond counsel to all parties to the transaction, includ-
 ing the nature of the services provided to the authority;
  [9.] 10. To make contracts and leases upon such terms as the authority
 shall deem appropriate, including without limitation leases which  grant
 the  tenant of a project an option to renew or an option to purchase the
 project, or both, at a fixed or otherwise  predetermined  price  and  to
 execute all instruments necessary or convenient;
  [10.]  11.  To  acquire, construct, reconstruct, lease, improve, main-
 tain, equip or furnish one or more projects;
  [11.] 12. To accept gifts, grants, loans or  contributions  from,  and
 enter  into  contracts or other transactions with, the United States and
 the state or any agency of either of them, any municipality, any  public
 or  private  corporation  or any other legal entity, and to use any such
 gifts, grants, loans or contributions for any of its corporate purposes;
  [12.] 13. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN  THE  FORM  OF  LOANS  TO
 IMPROVE,  MAINTAIN  OR  EQUIP  ONE  OR MORE PROJECTS CONSISTENT WITH ITS
 CORPORATE PURPOSES;
  14. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF GRANTS  TO  ONE  OR
 MORE PROJECTS CONSISTENT WITH ITS CORPORATE PURPOSES;
  15.  To  borrow money and to issue bonds and to provide for the rights

  [13.] 16. To designate the depositories of its money either within  or
 without the state of New York;
  [14.]  17.  To  enter  into  agreements  requiring payments in lieu of
 taxes. Such agreements shall be in writing  and  in  addition  to  other
 terms shall contain: the amount due annually to each affected tax juris-
 diction  (or  a  formula by which the amount due can be calculated), the
 name and address of the person, office or agency to which payment  shall
 be  delivered,  the date on which payment shall be made, and the date on
 which payment shall be considered delinquent if not paid. Unless  other-
 wise  agreed by the affected tax jurisdictions, any such agreement shall
 provide that payments in lieu of taxes shall be allocated among affected
 tax jurisdictions in proportion to the amount of real property  tax  and
 other  taxes  which would have been received by each affected tax juris-
 diction had the project not been tax exempt due to  the  status  of  the
 authority involved in the project. A copy of any such agreement shall be
 delivered to each affected tax jurisdiction within fifteen days of sign-
 ing  the  agreement.  In  the  absence  of  any  such written agreement,
 payments in lieu of taxes made by an agency shall be  allocated  in  the
 same  proportions  as  they  had  been  prior to January first, nineteen
 hundred ninety-three for so long as the authority's activities render  a
 project non-taxable by affected tax jurisdictions.
  [15.] 18. To establish and reestablish its fiscal year; and
 A. 5215  13
 
  [16.]  19.  To  do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its

 as amended by chapter 708 of the law of 2022,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:

 name and address of the person, office or agency to which payment  shall
 be  delivered,  the date on which payment shall be made, and the date on
 which payment shall be considered delinquent if not paid. Unless  other-
 wise  agreed by the affected tax jurisdictions, any such agreement shall
 provide that payments in lieu of taxes shall be allocated among affected
 tax jurisdictions in proportion to the amount of real property  tax  and
 other  taxes  which would have been received by each affected tax juris-
 diction had the project not been tax exempt due to  the  status  of  the
 authority involved in the project. A copy of any such agreement shall be
 delivered to each affected tax jurisdiction within fifteen days of sign-
 ing  the  agreement.  In  the  absence  of  any  such written agreement,
 payments in lieu of taxes made by an agency shall be  allocated  in  the
 same  proportions  as  they  had  been  prior to January first, nineteen
 hundred ninety-three for so long as the authority's activities render  a
 project non-taxable by affected tax jurisdictions. A notification of the
 expiration  of  such  agreement  shall  be delivered to the affected tax
 jurisdiction two years prior to the expiration  of  such  agreement  and

  §  11. Section 1953-a of the public authorities law, as added by chap-
 ter 356 of the laws of 1993, subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 357  of

  §  14. Section 2306 of the public authorities law, as added by chapter
 915 of the laws of 1969, the opening paragraph and an undesignated para-
 graph as amended by chapter 304 of the laws of 2013,  subdivision  8  as
 amended,  subdivision  14  as added and subdivisions 15 and 16 as renum-
 bered by chapter 356 of the laws of 1993, and subdivision 9  as  amended
 by chapter 556 of the laws of 1973, is amended to read as follows:
  §  2306.  Purpose  and  powers  of  the authority. The purposes of the
 authority shall be to promote, develop,  encourage  and  assist  in  the
 acquiring,  constructing, reconstructing, improving, maintaining, equip-
 ping and furnishing industrial, manufacturing, warehouse, CIVIC  FACILI-
 TIES,  commercial  and  research  facilities and facilities for use by a
 federal agency or a  medical  facility  including  industrial  pollution
 control  facilities, which may include transportation facilities includ-
 ing but not limited to those relating to water, highway, rail  and  air,
 in  one  or more areas of the city, and thereby advance the job opportu-
 nities, health, general prosperity and economic welfare of the people of
 said city and to improve their medical  care  and  standard  of  living;
 provided, however, that the authority shall not undertake any project if
 the  completion  thereof would result in the removal of an industrial or
 manufacturing plant of the project occupant from one area of  the  state
 to  another area of the state or in abandonment of one or more plants or
 facilities of the project applicant located within the state,  provided,
 however,  that  neither  restriction  shall apply if the authority shall
 determine on the basis of the application before it that the project  is
 reasonably  necessary  to  discourage the project occupant from removing
 such other plant or facility to a  location  outside  the  state  or  is
 reasonably necessary to preserve the competitive position of the project
 occupant in its respective industry. Except as otherwise provided for in
 this section, no financial assistance of the authority shall be provided
 in respect of any project where facilities or property that are primari-
 ly  used  in  making retail sales to customers who personally visit such
 facilities constitute more than one-third of the total project cost. For
 A. 5215  18
 
 the purposes of this article, "retail sales" shall mean: (i) sales by  a
 registered  vendor  under  article twenty-eight of the tax law primarily
 engaged in the retail sale of tangible personal property, as defined  in
 subparagraph  (i) of paragraph four of subdivision (b) of section eleven
 hundred one of the tax law; or (ii) sales of a service to  such  custom-
 ers.  Except,  however,  that  tourism destination projects shall not be
 prohibited by this paragraph. For the purpose of this paragraph,  "tour-
 ism  destination"  shall  mean a location or facility which is likely to
 attract a significant number  of  visitors  from  outside  the  economic
 development  region  as established by section two hundred thirty of the
 economic development law, in which the project is located.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section to the  contrary,  such
 financial assistance may, however, be provided to a project where facil-
 ities  or  property  that  are  primarily used in making retail sales of
 goods or services to customers who personally visit such  facilities  to
 obtain  such  goods  or  services  constitute more than one-third of the
 total project cost, where: (i) the predominant purpose  of  the  project
 would  be  to  make available goods or services which would not, but for
 the project, be reasonably accessible to the residents of  the  city  of
 Auburn  because  of a lack of reasonably accessible retail trade facili-
 ties offering such goods or services; or (ii) the project is located  in
 a  highly  distressed area. With respect to projects authorized pursuant
 to this paragraph no project shall  be  approved  unless  the  authority
 shall  find  after  the  public hearing required by section twenty-three
 hundred seven of this title that undertaking the project will serve  the
 public  purposes of this article by preserving permanent, private sector
 jobs or increasing the overall number of permanent, private sector  jobs
 in the state. Where the authority makes such a finding, prior to provid-
 ing  financial  assistance  to  the  project by the authority, the chief
 executive officer of the city  of  Auburn  shall  confirm  the  proposed
 action  of the authority. To carry out said purpose, the authority shall
 have power:
  1. To sue and be sued;
  2. To have a seal and alter the same at pleasure;
  3. To acquire, hold and dispose of personal property for its corporate
 purpose;
  4. To acquire by purchase, grant, lease, gift, condemnation, or other-
 wise and to use, real property or rights or easements therein  necessary
 for  its  corporate  purposes,  and  to  sell,  convey, mortgage, lease,
 pledge, exchange or otherwise dispose  of  any  such  property  in  such
 manner  as  the authority shall determine. With respect to real property
 conveyed to it by the city, however, such power of disposition shall  be
 limited  as  hereinafter provided in section twenty-three hundred ten of
 this title;
  5. TO ACQUIRE REAL PROPERTY WITHIN THE CITY OF AUBURN AS NECESSARY FOR
 ITS CORPORATE PURPOSES PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT  HUNDRED  FIFTY-EIGHT-C
 OF THE GENERAL MUNICIPAL LAW;
  6.  To  make  by-laws for the management and regulation of its affairs
 and, subject to agreements with its bondholders, for the  regulation  of
 the use of the project[.];
  [6.]  7.  With  the  consent of the city, to use agents, employees and
 facilities of the city, paying the city its  agreed  proportion  of  the
 compensation or costs[.];
  [7.]  8. To appoint officers, agents and employees, to prescribe their
 qualifications and to fix their compensation and to pay the same out  of
 funds of the authority, subject, however, to the provisions of the civil
 A. 5215  19
 
 service  law  hereinafter provided in section twenty-three hundred eight
 of this title;
  [8.]  9.  To  retain  and employ financial advisors, engineers, archi-
 tects, attorneys and other consultants for  professional  and  technical
 assistance  and  advice;  that  an attorney acting as bond counsel for a
 project must file with the authority a written statement  in  which  the
 attorney  identifies  each  party to the transaction which such attorney
 represents. If bond counsel provides any legal services to  the  parties
 other than the authority, the written statement must describe the nature
 of  legal  services  provided by such bond counsel to all parties to the
 transaction, including the  nature  of  the  services  provided  to  the
 authority;
  [9.] 10. To make contracts and leases upon such terms as the authority
 shall  deem appropriate, including without limitation leases which grant
 the tenant of a project an option to renew or an option to purchase  the
 project,  or  both,  at a fixed or otherwise predetermined price, and to
 execute all instruments necessary or convenient;
  [10.] 11. To acquire, construct, reconstruct,  lease,  improve,  main-
 tain, equip or furnish one or more projects;
  [11.]  12.  To  accept gifts, grants, loans or contributions from, and
 enter into contracts or other transactions with, the United  States  and
 the  state or any agency of either of them, any municipality, any public
 or private corporation or any other legal entity, and to  use  any  such
 gifts, grants, loans or contributions for any of its corporate purposes;
  [12.]  13.  TO  PROVIDE  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF LOANS TO
 IMPROVE, MAINTAIN OR EQUIP ONE OR  MORE  PROJECTS  CONSISTENT  WITH  ITS
 CORPORATE PURPOSES;
  14.  TO  PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF GRANTS FOR ONE OR
 MORE PROJECTS CONSISTENT WITH ITS CORPORATE PURPOSES;
  15. To borrow money and to issue bonds and to provide for  the  rights
 of the holders thereof;
  [13.]  16.  To  designate the depositories of its money in the city of
 Auburn[.];
  [14.] 17. To enter into  agreements  requiring  payments  in  lieu  of
 taxes.  Such  agreements  shall  be  in writing and in addition to other
 terms shall contain: the amount due annually to each affected tax juris-
 diction (or a formula by which the amount due can  be  calculated),  the
 name  and address of the person, office or agency to which payment shall
 be delivered, the date on which the payment shall be made, and the  date
 on  which  payment  shall  be  considered delinquent if not paid. Unless
 otherwise agreed by the affected tax jurisdictions, any  such  agreement
 shall  provide  that  payments in lieu of taxes shall be allocated among
 affected tax jurisdictions in proportion to the amount of real  property
 tax  and other taxes which would have been received by each affected tax
 jurisdiction had the project not been tax exempt due to  the  status  of
 the  agency  involved in the project. A copy of any such agreement shall
 be delivered to each tax affected jurisdiction within  fifteen  days  of
 signing  the  agreement.  In  the absence of any such written agreement,
 payments in lieu of taxes shall be allocated in the same proportions  as
 they  had been prior to January first, nineteen hundred ninety-three for
 so long as the authority's activities render a  project  non-taxable  by
 affected tax jurisdictions[.];
  [15.] 18. To establish and reestablish its fiscal year; and
  [16.]  19.  To  do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its
 purposes and exercise the powers expressly given in this title.
