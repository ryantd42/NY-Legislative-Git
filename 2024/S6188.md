 who was employed on March 7, 2012, by the Town of  Hempstead,  who,  for
 reasons  not ascribable to his own negligence, did not file a membership
 application in such system until May 21, 2012, which gave  him  Tier  VI
 status  instead  of  Tier V status, where he would have been had he been
 able to file a membership application when he became a permanent employ-
 ee on March 7, 2012, may be deemed to have become a member  of  the  New
 York state and local employees' retirement system on March 7, 2012 if on
 or  before  December 31, 2023 he shall file with the state comptroller a
 written request to that effect. Upon the granting  of  such  retroactive
 membership,  Daniel Miller shall not be granted a refund of any employee

 retirement system.

 annual contributions of the Town of Hempstead for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost  will  vary  as  the  billing
 rates and salary of Daniel Miller change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately $38,000 which will be
 borne by the Town of Hempstead as  a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
