 AVAILABLE  THEREFOR AND SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY HIM OR HER
 AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE, HE OR SHE  MAY
 PROVIDE  STATE  AID  TO  PROVIDERS  (A) IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED FIFTY

  (II) SUGGEST ONE OR MORE SUITABLE SITES WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION  WHICH

 FOR THE PROPOSED CERTIFIED RECOVERY RESIDENTIAL FACILITY.
  (F) (I) IN THE EVENT THE MUNICIPALITY OBJECTS TO THE ESTABLISHMENT  OF
 A  FACILITY  IN THE MUNICIPALITY BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD RESULT IN SUCH A
 CONCENTRATION OF CERTIFIED RECOVERY RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES OR A COMBINA-
 TION OF SUCH FACILITIES AND OTHER FACILITIES  LICENSED  BY  OTHER  STATE
 AGENCIES  THAT THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF AREAS WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY
 WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY ALTERED; OR THE PROVIDER OBJECTS  TO  THE  ESTAB-
 LISHMENT  OF  A  FACILITY  IN THE AREA OR AREAS SUGGESTED BY THE MUNICI-
 PALITY; OR IN THE EVENT THAT THE MUNICIPALITY AND  THE  PROVIDER  CANNOT
 AGREE  UPON  A SITE, EITHER THE PROVIDER OR THE MUNICIPALITY MAY REQUEST
 AN IMMEDIATE HEARING BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER TO RESOLVE THE  ISSUE.  THE
 COMMISSIONER  SHALL  PERSONALLY  OR  BY A HEARING OFFICER CONDUCT SUCH A
 HEARING WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF SUCH A REQUEST.
  (II) IN REVIEWING ANY SUCH OBJECTIONS, THE NEED FOR SUCH FACILITIES IN
 THE MUNICIPALITY SHALL BE CONSIDERED AS SHALL THE EXISTING CONCENTRATION

 AGENCIES  IN  THE  MUNICIPALITY  OR IN THE AREA IN PROXIMITY TO THE SITE

 SUBSTANCE  DISORDER.  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL SUSTAIN THE OBJECTION IF HE
 OR SHE DETERMINES THAT THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE AREA IN WHICH THE
 FACILITY IS TO BE BASED WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY ALTERED AS  A  RESULT  OF
 THE  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FACILITY. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL MAKE A DETER-
 MINATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE HEARING.

 ERED  NULL  AND  VOID  AND  CONTINUED  OPERATION  OF THE FACILITY MAY BE
 ENJOINED.

 TION OF A SUPPORTIVE LIVING FACILITY OR A SUPERVISED LIVING FACILITY  OF

 FACILITIES FAMILY UNITS FOR THE PURPOSES OF LOCAL LAWS AND ORDINANCES.
