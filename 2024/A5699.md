 AN  ACT  to  amend  the public authorities law, in relation to the regu-
  lation of bus privatization contracts

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and
 declares that decisions to use private  contractors  to  provide  public
 transportation service must be based on factors which promote the public
 interest.  To  ensure  that  citizens  of the state receive high quality
 transit services at low cost, with due regard for the taxpayers  of  the
 state and the needs of public and private workers, the legislature finds
 it necessary to regulate such privatization contracts.
  §  2.  The  public  authorities law is amended by adding a new section
 2875-c to read as follows:
  § 2875-C. REGULATION OF PRIVATIZATION CONTRACTS.  1.  DEFINITIONS.  AS

 INGS:

 ABLE ON AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY BASIS TO ANY PERSON, WITHOUT PREFERENCE FOR

 POPULATION SUB-GROUP BECAUSE OF  AGE,  GENDER,  RACE,  NATIONAL  ORIGIN,
 CREED  OR  AGENCY  CLIENT  STATUS, AND WHICH IS REGULARLY ADVERTISED AND
 MARKETED AS AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  NOTHING  IN  THIS  ARTICLE
 SHALL  BE  DEEMED  TO  MEAN THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OPERATED OR

 TION  CONTRACT,  INCLUDING THE SPECIFIC QUANTITY AND STANDARD OF QUALITY

 BID, SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING THE  COSTS  OF  TRANSITION  FROM  PUBLIC  TO
 PRIVATE  OPERATION,  OF ADDITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS,
 IF ANY, AND OF MONITORING AND OTHERWISE ADMINISTERING CONTRACT  PERFORM-
 ANCE.  IF THE DESIGNATED BIDDER IS HEADQUARTERED OUTSIDE THE STATE, SAID
 CONTRACT COST SHALL BE INCREASED BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX REVENUE, IF
 ANY, WHICH WILL BE LOST TO THE STATE.

 CARRY OUT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  D. THE OBJECTION OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH  A  OF
 THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ON THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
 SYSTEM, UNLESS THE STATE COMPTROLLER THEREAFTER IN WRITING WITHDRAWS THE
 OBJECTION,  STATING  THE  SPECIFIC REASONS, BASED UPON A REVISED CERTIF-
 ICATION BY THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND  UPON  THE  STATE  COMP-
 TROLLER'S REVIEW THEREOF.
