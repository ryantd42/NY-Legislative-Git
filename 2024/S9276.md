 CONFORMITY  THEREWITH  OR HAD A PROPENSITY TO ENGAGE IN SIMILAR WRONGFUL
 ACTS.
  2. THE COURT, IN ITS DISCRETION, MAY  EXCLUDE  SUCH  EVIDENCE  IF  ITS
 PROBATIVE VALUE IS OUTWEIGHED BY THE PROBABILITY THAT ITS ADMISSION WILL

 COMMITTED  IN  ANY  JURISDICTION THAT INVOLVES CONDUCT PROSCRIBED BY ANY
