 THOUSAND DOLLARS, shall not be such an approved expense, and except also
 that administrative and clerical expenses shall not exceed  ten  percent
 of  the  total  expenses  for purposes of this computation.  Any gifts,
 donations  or  interest  earned  by the board of cooperative educational
 services or on behalf of the board of cooperative  educational  services
 by  the dormitory authority or any other source shall not be deducted in
 determining the cost of services  allocated  to  each  component  school
 district.  Any payments made to a component school district by the board
 of cooperative educational services pursuant to  subdivision  eleven  of
 section  six-p  of the general municipal law attributable to an approved
 cost of service computed pursuant to this subdivision shall be  deducted
 from  the  cost of services allocated to such component school district.
 The expense of transportation  provided  by  the  board  of  cooperative
 educational services pursuant to paragraph q of subdivision four of this
 section  shall  be  eligible for aid apportioned pursuant to subdivision
 seven of section thirty-six hundred two of this chapter and no board  of
 cooperative  educational  services  transportation  expense  shall be an
 approved cost of services for the computation of aid under this subdivi-
 sion.  Transportation expense pursuant to  paragraph  q  of  subdivision
 four  of  this  section  shall be included in the computation of the ten
 percent limitation on administrative and clerical expenses.
  § 2. Paragraph b of subdivision 10 of section 3602  of  the  education
 law,  as  amended  by  section 16 of part B of chapter 57 of the laws of
 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  b. Aid for career education. There shall be apportioned to  such  city
 school districts and other school districts which were not components of
 a  board of cooperative educational services in the base year for pupils
 in grades [ten] NINE through twelve in attendance  in  career  education
 programs  as  such programs are defined by the commissioner, subject for
 the purposes of this paragraph to the approval of the  director  of  the
 budget,  an amount for each such pupil to be computed by multiplying the
 career education aid ratio by [three thousand nine hundred dollars] FOUR
 THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS.  Such aid will be  payable  for  weighted
 pupils  attending  career  education  programs  operated  by  the school
 district and for weighted pupils for whom such school district contracts
 with boards of cooperative educational services to attend career  educa-
 tion  programs  operated by a board of cooperative educational services.
 Weighted pupils for the purposes of this paragraph shall mean the sum of
 the attendance of students in grades [ten] NINE through twelve in career
 education sequences in trade,  industrial,  technical,  agricultural  or
 health programs plus the product of sixteen hundredths multiplied by the
 attendance  of  students  in  grades [ten] NINE through twelve in career
 education sequences in business and marketing as defined by the  commis-
 sioner  in regulations. The career education aid ratio shall be computed
 by subtracting from one the product obtained by  multiplying  fifty-nine
 percent  by the combined wealth ratio. This aid ratio shall be expressed
 as a decimal carried to three places without rounding, but not less than
 thirty-six percent.
  Any school district that receives aid pursuant to this paragraph shall
 be required to use such amount to support career education  programs  in
 the current year.
  A board of education which spends less than its local funds as defined
 by regulations of the commissioner for career education in the base year
 during the current year shall have its apportionment under this subdivi-
 sion  reduced  in an amount equal to such deficiency in the current or a
 succeeding school year, provided however that the commissioner may waive

 such reduction upon determination that overall expenditures per pupil in
 support of career education programs were continued at a level equal  to
 or  greater than the level of such overall expenditures per pupil in the
 preceding school year.
  §  3.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to the
 calculation of BOCES aid and aid for career  education  payable  in  the
 2024-2025 school year and years thereafter.
