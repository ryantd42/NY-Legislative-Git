 shall be corrected by the commissioner. Whenever a school  district  has
 been  apportioned  less  money  than  that  to which it is entitled, the
 commissioner may allot to such district the balance to which it is enti-
 tled. Whenever a school district has been apportioned  more  money  than
 that  to which it is entitled, the commissioner may, by an order, direct
 such moneys to be paid back to the state to be credited to  the  general
 fund  local  assistance  account  for  state  aid to the schools, or may
 deduct such amount from the  next  apportionment  to  be  made  to  said
 district,  provided, however, that, upon notification of excess payments
 of aid for which a recovery must be made by the state through  deduction
 of  future  aid payments, a school district may request that such excess
 payments be  recovered  by  deducting  such  excess  payments  from  the
 payments due to such school district and payable in the month of June in

 two  succeeding  school  years,  provided further that there shall be no
 interest penalty assessed against such  district  or  collected  by  the

 the commissioner shall prescribe, and shall be  based  on  documentation
 that the total amount to be recovered is in excess of one percent of the
 district's  total  general  fund  expenditures  for the preceding school
 year. The amount to be deducted in the first year shall be  the  greater
 of  (i) the sum of the amount of such excess payments that is recognized
 as a liability due to other governments by the district for the  preced-
 ing  school year and the positive remainder of the district's unreserved
 fund balance at the close of the preceding school year less the  product
 of  the  district's  total  general  fund expenditures for the preceding
 school year multiplied by five percent, or (ii) one-third of such excess
 payments. The amount to be recovered in the second year shall equal  the
 lesser  of  the remaining amount of such excess payments to be recovered
 or one-third of such excess payments, and the remaining amount  of  such
 excess  payments  shall be recovered in the third year. Provided further
 that, notwithstanding any other  provisions  of  this  subdivision,  any
 pending  payment  of moneys due to such district as a prior year adjust-
 ment payable pursuant to paragraph c of this subdivision for aid  claims
 that  had been previously paid as current year aid payments in excess of
 the amount to which the district is entitled and for which  recovery  of
 excess  payments  is  to  be  made  pursuant to this paragraph, shall be
 reduced at the time of  actual  payment  by  any  remaining  unrecovered
 balance  of such excess payments, and the remaining scheduled deductions
 of such excess payments pursuant to this paragraph shall be  reduced  by
 S. 8306--A  16  A. 8806--A
 
 the  commissioner  to reflect the amount so recovered. [The commissioner
 shall certify no payment to a school district based on a claim submitted
 later than three years after the close of the school year in which  such
 payment  was first to be made.  For claims for which payment is first to
 be made in the nineteen hundred  ninety-six--ninety-seven  school  year,
 the  commissioner shall certify no payment to a school district based on
 a claim submitted later than two years after the close  of  such  school
 year.] For claims for which payment is first to be made [in the nineteen
 hundred  ninety-seven--ninety-eight school year and thereafter] PRIOR TO
 THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE--TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR SCHOOL YEAR, the
 commissioner shall certify no payment to a school district  based  on  a
 claim submitted later than one year after the close of such school year.

 secondary level as determined by the commissioner, such boards of educa-
 tion  shall, during the school years nineteen hundred ninety-five--nine-
 ty-six through June thirtieth, two thousand  [twenty-four]  TWENTY-NINE,

 tenths  times the applicable maximum class size specified in regulations
 of the commissioner rounded up to the  nearest  whole  number,  provided
 that  in  a  city  school district having a population of one million or
 more, classes that have a maximum class size of fifteen may be increased

 regulation, provided that such authorization  shall  terminate  on  June

 the board's intention to increase such class sizes and  a  certification
 that  the  board  will  conduct  a  study  of attendance problems at the
 secondary level and will implement a corrective action plan to  increase
 the  rate of attendance of students in such classes to at least the rate
 for students attending regular education classes in secondary schools of
 the district.  Such  corrective  action  plan  shall  be  submitted  for
 approval  by  the commissioner by a date during the school year in which
 such board increases class sizes as provided pursuant to  this  subdivi-
 sion  to  be  prescribed  by the commissioner. Upon at least thirty days
 notice to the board of education, after conclusion of the school year in
 which such board increases class sizes  as  provided  pursuant  to  this
 subdivision,  the  commissioner  shall  be  authorized to terminate such
 authorization upon a finding that the board has  failed  to  develop  or
 implement an approved corrective action plan.

 shall  be  computed  by multiplying by not to exceed six hundred dollars
 the number of earned associate degrees, by not to  exceed  one  thousand
 five  hundred dollars the number of earned bachelor's degrees, by not to
 exceed nine hundred fifty dollars the number of earned master's degrees,
 and by not to exceed four thousand five hundred fifty dollars the number

 apportionment is made, provided that there shall be  excluded  from  any
 such  computation  the number of degrees earned by students with respect
 to whom state aid other than that established by this section or section
 sixty-four hundred one-a of this article  is  granted  directly  to  the
 institution,  and provided further that, except as otherwise provided in
 this subdivision, the amount apportioned for an associate  degree  shall
 be  awarded  only  to two year institutions qualifying under subdivision
 two of this section. The regents shall  promulgate  rules  defining  and
 classifying  professional  degrees  for  the  purposes  of this section.
 Institutions qualifying for state aid  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 paragraph  (b) of subdivision two of this section shall, for purposes of

 For purposes of this  subdivision,  a  two-year  institution  which  has
 received  authority  to  confer  bachelor  degrees  shall continue to be
 considered a two-year institution until such time  as  it  has  actually
 begun  to  confer the bachelor's degree. Thereafter, notwithstanding any
 other provision of law to the contrary, an institution which was former-

 ninety-three, (b) such authority having been granted after the first day
 of May, two thousand five, but before the first day of June,  two  thou-
 sand five, (c) such authority having been granted after the first day of
 April,  two thousand nine, but before the first day of May, two thousand
 nine, or (d) such authority having been granted after the first  day  of
 December,  two  thousand  nine, but before the first day of January, two
 thousand ten, may elect to continue to receive awards for earned associ-
 ate degrees. Should such institution so elect, it shall not be  eligible
 during the time of such election to receive awards for earned bachelor's
 degrees.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE PRECEDING PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION,
 IN THE EVENT THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SUCH ANNUAL APPORTIONMENTS TO  ALL
 INSTITUTIONS MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION
 WOULD  OTHERWISE  EXCEED  THE TOTAL AMOUNT APPROPRIATED FOR UNRESTRICTED
 AID TO INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, THE  ANNUAL  APPORTIONMENT
 TO EACH SUCH INSTITUTION SHALL BE REDUCED PROPORTIONALLY.

 THIS  SECTION, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL HAVE ALL THE POWERS CONFERRED UPON
 SHERIFFS BY ARTICLE TWENTY-FIVE OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, BUT

 ation  or  liability,  that  portion of the filed order that constitutes

 BECOME  A LIEN UPON THE TITLE TO AND INTEREST IN REAL PROPERTY AND CHAT-
 TELS OF THE EMPLOYER AGAINST WHOM THE WARRANT  IS  ISSUED  IN  THE  SAME
 MANNER  AS  A  JUDGMENT  DULY  DOCKETED IN THE OFFICE OF SUCH CLERK. THE
 SHERIFF SHALL THEN PROCEED UPON THE WARRANT IN THE SAME MANNER, AND WITH
 LIKE EFFECT, AS THAT PROVIDED BY LAW IN  RESPECT  TO  EXECUTIONS  ISSUED
 AGAINST  PROPERTY  UPON  JUDGMENTS  OF  A COURT OF RECORD, AND FOR THEIR
 SERVICES IN EXECUTING THE WARRANT THEY SHALL BE  ENTITLED  TO  THE  SAME
 FEES, WHICH THEY MAY COLLECT IN THE SAME MANNER.
  (C)  IN  THE  DISCRETION OF THE COMMISSIONER, A WARRANT OF LIKE TERMS,
 FORCE, AND EFFECT MAY BE ISSUED AND DIRECTED TO ANY OFFICER OR  EMPLOYEE
 OF  THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR WHO MAY FILE A COPY OF SUCH WARRANT WITH THE
 CLERK OF ANY COUNTY IN THE STATE, AND THEREUPON EACH  SUCH  CLERK  SHALL
 DOCKET  IT  AND  IT  SHALL BECOME A LIEN IN THE SAME MANNER AND WITH THE
 SAME FORCE AND EFFECT AS HEREINBEFORE PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO A WARRANT
 ISSUED AND DIRECTED TO AND FILED BY A  SHERIFF;  AND  IN  THE  EXECUTION
 THEREOF  SUCH OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE SHALL HAVE ALL THE POWERS CONFERRED BY
 LAW UPON SHERIFFS, BUT THEY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO NO FEE OR  COMPENSATION
 IN  EXCESS  OF THE ACTUAL EXPENSES PAID IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH DUTY.
 IF A WARRANT IS RETURNED NOT SATISFIED IN FULL, THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL
 HAVE  THE  SAME REMEDIES TO ENFORCE THE AMOUNT THEREOF AS IF THE COMMIS-
 SIONER HAD RECOVERED JUDGMENT FOR THE SAME.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 219 of the  labor  law,  as  amended  by
 chapter 2 of the laws of 2015, is amended to read as follows:

  PART P
 
  Section  1. This Part enacts into law components of legislation relat-
 ing to the conveyance and use of real property owned and  maintained  by
 the  state  university  of New York and the New York state department of
 transportation. Each component is  wholly  contained  within  a  Subpart
 identified  as Subparts A through C. The effective date for each partic-
 ular provision contained within such Subpart is set forth  in  the  last
 section of such Subpart. Any provision in any section contained within a
 Subpart, including the effective date of the Subpart, which makes refer-
 ence  to  a  section  "of  this  act", when used in connection with that
 particular component, shall be deemed to mean and refer  to  the  corre-
 sponding  section  of the Subpart in which it is found. Section three of
 this Part sets forth the general effective date of this Part.
 
  SUBPART A
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the  state
 university  of  New  York  at  Farmingdale  ("Farmingdale") seeks to use
 approximately 8.7 acres of vacant land on Farmingdale's campus to  build
 multi-purpose  facilities  to support housing needs and supporting amen-
 ities, fulfilling a necessary and vital public purpose. The  legislature
 further  finds that granting the trustees of the State University of New
 York ("Trustees")  the  authority  and  power  to  lease  and  otherwise
 contract  to  make  available  grounds and facilities of the Farmingdale
 campus will ensure such land is utilized for the benefit of Farmingdale,
 the surrounding community, and the general public.
 S. 8306--A  50  A. 8806--A
 
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the  Trustees  are
 authorized  and  empowered,  without  any  public  bidding, to lease and
 otherwise contract to make available to  Farmingdale  state  development
 corporation,  a  not-for-profit  corporation  (the  "ground  lessee"), a
 portion  of the lands of Farmingdale generally described in this act for
 the purpose  of  developing,  constructing,  maintaining  and  operating
 multi-purpose  facilities  to support housing needs and supporting amen-
 ities. Such lease or contract shall be for a period not exceeding  nine-
 ty-nine years without any fee simple conveyance and otherwise upon terms
 and  conditions  determined by such trustees, subject to the approval of
 the director of the division of the budget, the attorney general and the
 state comptroller. In the event that  the  real  property  that  is  the
 subject of such lease or contract shall cease to be used for the purpose
 described  in  this act, such lease or contract shall immediately termi-
 nate and the real property and any improvements thereon shall revert  to
 the  state  university  of  New York. Any lease or contract entered into
 pursuant to this act shall provide that the real property  that  is  the
 subject  of  such  lease  or contract and any improvements thereon shall
 revert to the state university of New York on  the  expiration  of  such
 contract  or lease.  Any and all proceeds related to the leases author-
 ized by this act shall be used for the benefit of the Farmingdale campus
 and the allocation of such proceeds shall be subject to approval by  the
 Trustees.
  §  3. Any contract or lease entered into pursuant to this act shall be
 deemed to be a state contract for purposes of article 15-A of the execu-
 tive law, and any contractor, subcontractor, lessee or sublessee  enter-
 ing into such contract or lease for the construction, demolition, recon-
 struction, excavation, rehabilitation, repair, renovation, alteration or
 improvement  authorized  pursuant  to  this  act shall be deemed a state
 agency for the purposes of article 15-A of the executive law and subject
 to the provisions of such article.
  § 4. Notwithstanding any general, special or  local  law  or  judicial
 decision  to the contrary, all work performed on a project authorized by
 this act where all or any portion thereof involves a lease or  agreement
 for  construction,  demolition,  reconstruction,  excavation,  rehabili-
 tation, repair, renovation, alteration or improvement shall  be  subject
 to  and  performed in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the
 labor law to the same extent and in the same manner as a contract of the
 state.
  § 5. Without limiting the determination of the terms and conditions of
 such contracts or leases, such terms  and  conditions  may  provide  for
 leasing,  subleasing,  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,
 improvement, operation and management of and provision of  services  and
 assistance  and  the  granting of licenses, easements and other arrange-
 ments with regard to such grounds and facilities  by  Farmingdale  state
 development  corporation, and parties contracting with Farmingdale state
 development corporation, and in connection  with  such  activities,  the
 obtaining  of funding or financing, whether public or private, unsecured
 or secured, including, but not limited to, secured  by  leasehold  mort-
 gages and assignments of rents and leases, by Farmingdale state develop-
 ment corporation and parties contracting with Farmingdale state develop-
 ment corporation for the purposes of completing the project described in
 this act.
  §  6.  Such  lease  shall  include  an indemnity provision whereby the
 lessee or sublessee promises to indemnify, hold harmless and defend  the
 lessor  against all claims, suits, actions, and liability to all persons
 S. 8306--A  51  A. 8806--A
 
 on the leased premises, including tenant, tenant's agents,  contractors,

 or occupation of the demised premises.
  § 7. Any contracts entered into  pursuant  to  this  act  between  the
 ground  lessee  and  parties contracting with the ground lessee shall be
 awarded by a competitive process.

 acres  situated  on  the  campus  of the State University of New York at
 Farmingdale, subject to  all  existing  easements  and  restrictions  of
 record.  The description in this section of the parcel to be made avail-
 able pursuant to this act is not meant to be a legal description, but is
 intended only to identify the parcel:

  §  9. The state university of New York shall not lease lands described
 in this act unless any such lease shall be executed within  5  years  of
 the effective date of this act.
  §  10. Insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with the
 provisions of any law, general, special or local, the provisions of this
 act shall be controlling.

 ton  campus  to  build multi-purpose facilities to support housing needs
 and supporting  amenities,  fulfilling  a  necessary  and  vital  public
 purpose.  The  legislature further finds that granting the trustees of

 of Stony Brook, the surrounding community, and the general public.

 developing, constructing, maintaining and operating multi-purpose facil-
 ities to support housing needs and supporting amenities. Such  lease  or

 division  of the budget, the attorney general and the state comptroller.
 In the event that the real property that is the subject of such lease or
 contract shall cease to be used for the purpose described in  this  act,

 provide that the real property that is the  subject  of  such  lease  or
 S. 8306--A  52  A. 8806--A
 
 contract  and any improvements thereon shall revert to the state univer-
 sity of New York on the expiration of such contract or  lease.  Any  and

 ground  lessee  and  parties  contracting with the ground lessee for the
 purposes of completing the project described in this act.
  § 6. Such lease shall  include  an  indemnity  provision  whereby  the
