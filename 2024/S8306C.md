 ented by certified or  recognized  employee  organizations,  all  salary

 in  grades  [ten]  NINE through twelve in attendance in career education
 programs as such programs are defined by the commissioner,  subject  for
 the  purposes  of  this paragraph to the approval of the director of the
 budget, an amount for each such pupil to be computed by multiplying  the
 career  education  aid  ratio by [three thousand nine] FOUR THOUSAND ONE

 career  education  programs  operated  by  the  school  district and for
 weighted pupils for whom such school district contracts with  boards  of
 cooperative  educational  services  to  attend career education programs
 operated by a board of cooperative educational services. Weighted pupils
 for the purposes of this paragraph shall mean the sum of the  attendance
 of  students  in  grades  [ten]  NINE through twelve in career education
 sequences  in  trade,  industrial,  technical,  agricultural  or  health
 programs  plus  the  product  of  sixteen  hundredths  multiplied by the
 attendance of students in grades [ten] NINE  through  twelve  in  career
 education  sequences in business and marketing as defined by the commis-
 sioner in regulations. The career education aid ratio shall be  computed
 by  subtracting  from one the product obtained by multiplying fifty-nine
 percent by the combined wealth ratio. This aid ratio shall be  expressed
 as a decimal carried to three places without rounding, but not less than
 thirty-six percent.
  Any school district that receives aid pursuant to this paragraph shall
 be  required  to use such amount to support career education programs in
 the current year.
  A board of education which spends less than its local funds as defined
 by regulations of the commissioner for career education in the base year
 during the current year shall have its apportionment under this subdivi-
 sion reduced in an amount equal to such deficiency in the current  or  a
 succeeding school year, provided however that the commissioner may waive
 such reduction upon determination that overall expenditures per pupil in
 S. 8306--B  29
 
 support  of career education programs were continued at a level equal to
 or greater than the level of such overall expenditures per pupil in  the
 preceding school year.

 domestic corporation or of any  foreign  corporation,  when  the  unpaid
 services were performed in the state, no shares of which are listed on a
 national  securities exchange or regularly quoted in an over-the-counter
 market by one or more members of a national or an affiliated  securities
 association,  shall  jointly  and severally be personally liable for all
 debts, wages or salaries due and owing to any of its laborers,  servants
 or  employees other than contractors, for services performed by them for

 such  shareholder that he intends to hold him liable under this section.
 Such notice shall be given within one  hundred  and  eighty  days  after
 termination  of  such  services, except that if, within such period, the

 shareholders  under  paragraph  (b)  of  section 624 (Books and records;
 right of inspection, prima facie evidence) of this article, such  notice
 may  be  given within sixty days after he has been given the opportunity

 under  this  section shall be entitled to contribution pro rata from the
 other shareholders liable under this section with respect to the  excess
 so paid, over and above [his] SUCH SHAREHOLDER'S pro rata share, and may
 sue  them  jointly  or  severally  or  any number of them to recover the
 amount due from them.  Such recovery may be had in a separate action. As
 used in this paragraph, "pro rata" means  in  proportion  to  beneficial
 share  interest.  Before a shareholder may claim contribution from other
 shareholders under this paragraph, [he] SUCH SHAREHOLDER shall[,  unless

 severally  be personally liable for all debts, wages or salaries due and
 owing to any of  its  laborers,  servants  or  employees,  for  services
 performed  by  them  for  such  limited  liability company. [Before such
 laborer, servant or employee shall charge such member for such services,
 he or she shall give notice in writing to such member  that  he  or  she
 intends to hold such member liable under this section. Such notice shall
 be  given  within  one  hundred  eighty  days  after termination of such
 services. An action to enforce such liability shall be commenced  within
 ninety  days  after  the  return of an execution unsatisfied against the
 limited liability company upon a judgment recovered against it for  such
 services.]  A  member who has paid more than [his or her] THEIR pro rata
 share under this section shall be entitled to contribution pro rata from
 the other members liable under this section with respect to  the  excess
 so  paid,  over and above [his or her] SUCH MEMBER'S pro rata share, and

 S. 8306--B  74
 
  Section  1. This Part enacts into law components of legislation relat-
 ing to the conveyance and use of real property owned and  maintained  by
 the  state  university  of New York and the New York state department of
 transportation. Each component is  wholly  contained  within  a  Subpart
 identified  as Subparts A through C. The effective date for each partic-
 ular provision contained within such Subpart is set forth  in  the  last
 section of such Subpart. Any provision in any section contained within a
 Subpart, including the effective date of the Subpart, which makes refer-
 ence  to  a  section  "of  this  act", when used in connection with that
 particular component, shall be deemed to mean and refer  to  the  corre-
 sponding  section  of the Subpart in which it is found. Section three of
 this Part sets forth the general effective date of this Part.
 
  SUBPART A

  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the  state
 university  of  New  York  at  Farmingdale  ("Farmingdale") seeks to use
 approximately 8.7 acres of vacant land on Farmingdale's campus to  build
 multi-purpose  facilities  to  support  affordable  housing  needs  and
 supporting amenities, fulfilling a necessary and vital  public  purpose.
 The  legislature  further  finds that granting the trustees of the State
 University of New York ("Trustees") the authority and power to lease and
 otherwise contract to make available grounds and facilities of the Farm-
 ingdale campus will ensure such land is  utilized  for  the  benefit  of
 Farmingdale, the surrounding community, and the general public.
  §  2.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the Trustees are
 authorized and empowered, without  any  public  bidding,  to  lease  and
 otherwise contract to make available to the New York housing opportunity
 corporation (the "ground lessee"), a portion of the lands of Farmingdale
 generally  described  in  this  act  for  the  purpose  of  developing,
 constructing, maintaining  and  operating  multi-purpose  facilities  to
 support  affordable  housing needs and supporting amenities as permitted
 by the New York housing opportunity corporation  act.  Such  lease  or
 contract  shall  be for a period not exceeding ninety-nine years without
 any fee simple conveyance and otherwise upon terms and conditions deter-
 mined by such trustees, subject to the approval of the director  of  the
 division  of the budget, the attorney general and the state comptroller.
 In the event that the real property that is the subject of such lease or
 contract shall cease to be used for the purpose described in  this  act,
 such lease or contract shall immediately terminate and the real property
 and any improvements thereon shall revert to the state university of New
 York.  Any  lease  or  contract  entered into pursuant to this act shall
 provide that the real property that is the  subject  of  such  lease  or
 contract  and any improvements thereon shall revert to the state univer-
 sity of New York on the expiration of such contract or lease.  Any  and
 all  proceeds related to the leases authorized by this act shall be used
 for the benefit of the Farmingdale campus and  the  allocation  of  such
 proceeds shall be subject to approval by the Trustees.
  §  3. Any contract or lease entered into pursuant to this act shall be
 deemed to be a state contract for purposes of article 15-A of the execu-
 tive law, and any contractor, subcontractor, lessee or sublessee  enter-
 ing into such contract or lease for the construction, demolition, recon-
 struction, excavation, rehabilitation, repair, renovation, alteration or
 improvement  authorized  pursuant  to  this  act shall be deemed a state
 agency for the purposes of article 15-A of the executive law and subject
 to the provisions of such article.

  § 4. Notwithstanding any general, special or  local  law  or  judicial
 decision  to the contrary, all work performed on a project authorized by
 this act where all or any portion thereof involves a lease or  agreement
 for  construction,  demolition,  reconstruction,  excavation,  rehabili-
 tation,  repair,  renovation, alteration or improvement shall be subject
 to and performed in accordance with the provisions of article 8  of  the
 labor law to the same extent and in the same manner as a contract of the
 state.
  § 5. Without limiting the determination of the terms and conditions of
 such  contracts  or  leases,  such  terms and conditions may provide for
 leasing,  subleasing,  construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,
 improvement,  operation  and management of and provision of services and
 assistance and the granting of licenses, easements  and  other  arrange-
 ments with regard to such grounds and facilities by the New York housing
 opportunity corporation, and parties contracting with the New York hous-
 ing opportunity corporation, and in connection with such activities, the
 obtaining  of funding or financing, whether public or private, unsecured
 or secured, including, but not limited to, secured  by  leasehold  mort-
 gages  and  assignments  of  rents  and  leases, by the New York housing
 opportunity corporation and parties contracting with the New York  hous-
 ing  opportunity  corporation for the purposes of completing the project
 described in this act.
  § 6. Such lease shall  include  an  indemnity  provision  whereby  the
 lessee  or sublessee promises to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the
 lessor against all claims, suits, actions, and liability to all  persons
 on  the leased premises, including tenant, tenant's agents, contractors,
 subcontractors, employees, customers, guests,  licensees,  invitees  and
 members of the public, for damage to any such person's property, whether
 real  or  personal, or for personal injuries arising out of tenant's use
 or occupation of the demised premises.
  § 7. Any contracts entered into  pursuant  to  this  act  between  the
 ground  lessee  and  parties contracting with the ground lessee shall be
 awarded by a competitive process.
  § 8. The property authorized by this act to be leased to the New  York
 housing opportunity corporation is generally described as that parcel of
 real  property  with  improvements  thereon consisting of a total of 8.7
 acres situated on the campus of the State  University  of  New  York  at
 Farmingdale,  subject  to  all  existing  easements  and restrictions of
 record. The description in this section of the parcel to be made  avail-
 able pursuant to this act is not meant to be a legal description, but is
 intended only to identify the parcel:
  The  property is situated at the southwest corner of NYS Route 110 and
 Melville Road. The eastern boundary runs north/south along  the  western
 side  of  NYS  Route  110  with  approximately 450 feet of frontage. The
 northern boundary runs along Melville Road for just over 1,000 feet.
  § 9. The state university of New York shall not lease lands  described
 in  this  act  unless any such lease shall be executed within 5 years of
 the effective date of this act.
  § 10. Insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with  the
 provisions of any law, general, special or local, the provisions of this
 act shall be controlling.
  § 11. This act shall take effect immediately.

 approximately  10 acres of underutilized land on Stony Brook's Southamp-
 ton campus to build multi-purpose facilities to support affordable hous-
 ing  needs  and  supporting  amenities, fulfilling a necessary and vital
 public purpose.  The legislature further finds that granting  the  trus-
 tees  of the State University of New York ("Trustees") the authority and
 power to lease and otherwise contract  to  make  available  grounds  and
 facilities of Stony Brook's campus will ensure such land is utilized for
 the  benefit  of Stony Brook, the surrounding community, and the general

 exceeding ninety-nine years without any fee simple conveyance and other-
 wise upon terms and conditions determined by such trustees,  subject  to
 the approval of the director of the division of the budget, the attorney
 general  and  the state comptroller. In the event that the real property
 that is the subject of such lease or contract shall cease to be used for

 diately  terminate  and  the  real property and any improvements thereon
 shall revert to the state university of New York. Any lease or  contract
 entered  into  pursuant to this act shall provide that the real property
 that is the subject of such lease or contract and any improvements ther-
 eon shall revert to the state university of New York on  the  expiration

  PART X
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  State  University  of New York
 ("SUNY") has committed to becoming the most inclusive university  system
 in  the country, where all students, faculty, and staff feel welcome and
 supported. To meet this goal, SUNY must employ, in addition  to  faculty
 and  staff,  leaders  at the highest levels who share common experiences
 and culture with those who comprise the fastest-growing segment  of  its
 student  population:  diverse students who will become the nation's next
 generation of leaders.
  SUNY has seen a steady increase of Black  students  in  recent  years,
 reaching  nearly  11  percent, or over 42,000 students, in the 2019-2020
 academic year. While SUNY continues its efforts to  ensure  that  campus
 leadership and faculty reflect the students they serve by hiring faculty
 who  are  more  representative of the diverse student population at SUNY
 campuses, the  diversity  within  executive  leadership  teams  on  many
 campuses can be expanded further with support from the legislature.
  It  is,  therefore, the intention of the legislature to create a Black
 Leadership Institute ("the Institute") as an initiative for Black  lead-
 ers  in  higher  education with a mission to retain and grow from within
 SUNY a greater proportion of Black professionals at SUNY  campuses.  The
 Institute  shall  offer  support and foster professional development for
 candidates for senior leadership roles on SUNY campuses, which will,  in
 turn,  create a more diverse SUNY culture that represents New York state
 and the SUNY student population.
  The legislature further intends that the Institute would  be  designed
 to  open doors to executive-level positions and strengthen the Universi-
 ty's pool of Black leaders. The Institute will  identify,  develop,  and
 recruit, and ultimately support, retain, and foster the success of Black
 leaders across the SUNY system.
  §  2. The education law is amended by adding a new section 362 to read
 as follows:
  § 362. BLACK LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE. 1.  SUBJECT TO AN APPROPRIATION FOR
 THIS PURPOSE, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY  OF  NEW  YORK,  IN
 CONSULTATION  WITH  THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW
 YORK, SHALL CREATE A BLACK LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE WITHIN THE STATE UNIVER-
 SITY OF NEW YORK TO FOSTER THE SUCCESS OF BLACK LEADERS AT THE UNIVERSI-
 TY PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT'S CABINET LEVEL. SUCH INSTITUTE SHALL DEVELOP
 CANDIDATE  IDENTIFICATION  AND  RECRUITMENT  EFFORTS,  SEARCH  COMMITTEE
 TRAINING,  PROFESSIONAL  DEVELOPMENT AND INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT MEASURES
 FOR  INSTITUTE  PARTICIPANTS,  PROFESSIONAL  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAMMING,
 S. 8306--B  93
 
 SERVICES, RESEARCH AND RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION ACTIVITIES, AND ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS DEEMED NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS INSTITUTE.
  2.  THE  CHANCELLOR  SHALL  APPOINT AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND AN EIGHT
 MEMBER ADVISORY COUNCIL, TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND ADVICE TO  FURTHER  THE
 DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF THE INSTITUTE. THE DIRECTOR AND THE MEMBERS OF
 THE ADVISORY COUNCIL SHALL SERVE FOR THREE-YEAR TERMS, WITH THE DIRECTOR
 AND  THREE  ADVISORY  COUNCIL MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE
 INSTITUTE'S EXISTENCE, THREE OTHER MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE SECOND YEAR,
 AND TWO MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE THIRD YEAR. THE DIRECTOR  AND  ADVISORY
 COUNCIL MEMBERS MAY BE REAPPOINTED AT THE END OF EACH TERM IN THE MANNER
 OF  THE  ORIGINAL  APPOINTMENT.  THE DIRECTOR AND ADVISORY COUNCIL SHALL
 RECEIVE NO COMPENSATION FOR THEIR WORK IN CONJUNCTION  WITH  THE  INSTI-
 TUTE.
  3.  IN  CONSIDERING  MEASURES  AND  PROGRAMMING  FOR  EFFECTUATING THE
 PURPOSE OF THE INSTITUTE, THE INSTITUTE SHALL CONSIDER SUCH  FACTORS  AS
 PROGRAM  COST-EFFECTIVENESS;  THE  ABILITY  OF  SUCH  PROGRAMS  TO OFFER
 PROGRAMMATICALLY APPROPRIATE, LONG-TERM, TRAINING, AND SUPPORT SERVICES;
 THE ABILITY OF SUCH PROGRAMS TO ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
 INSTITUTE TO RECEIVE REWARDING TRAINING,  SERVICES,  AND  SUPPORTS;  AND
 CURRENT  AND  PROJECTED  EMPLOYMENT  DATA  AT  CAMPUSES WITHIN THE STATE
 UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.
  4. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHALL PREPARE AND PRESENT TO  THE  GOVERNOR,
 THE  SPEAKER  OF  THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE AT
 THE BEGINNING OF EACH REGULAR SESSION  OF  THE  LEGISLATURE  A  SEPARATE
 REPORT  COVERING,  IN  SUMMARY, AND IN DETAIL, ALL PHASES OF ACTIVITY OF
 THE INSTITUTE FOR THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the first of April next  succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law.

  1. Industrial controversy. (a) The accumulation of benefit rights by a
 claimant  shall  be suspended during a period of [two consecutive weeks]

 employment  because  of  a strike or other industrial controversy except
 for lockouts, including concerted activity not authorized or  sanctioned
 by  the  recognized  or  certified bargaining agent of the claimant, and
 other concerted activity conducted in violation of any existing  collec-
 tive  bargaining  agreement, in the establishment in which he or she was
 employed, except that benefit rights may be accumulated before the expi-
 ration of such [two] ONE week period beginning with the day  after  such
 strike or other industrial controversy was terminated.
  (b) Benefits shall not be suspended under this section if:
  (i)  The employer hires a permanent replacement worker for the employ-
 ee's position. A replacement worker shall be presumed  to  be  permanent
 unless  the employer certifies in writing that the employee will be able
 to return to his or her prior position upon conclusion of the strike, in
 the event the strike terminates prior to the conclusion of  the  employ-
 ee's eligibility for benefit rights under this chapter. In the event the
 employer  does  not  permit  such  return  after such certification, the
 employee shall be entitled to recover any benefits lost as a  result  of
 the [two] ONE week suspension of benefits, and the department may impose
 a  penalty  upon  the  employer of up to seven hundred fifty dollars per
 S. 8306--B  94
 
 employee per week of benefits lost. The penalty collected shall be  paid
 into  the  unemployment  insurance  control fund established pursuant to
 section five hundred fifty-two-b of this article; or
  (ii) The commissioner determines that the claimant:
  (A)  is not employed by an employer that is involved in the industrial
 controversy that caused his or her unemployment and is not participating
 in the industrial controversy; or
  (B) is not in a bargaining unit involved in the industrial controversy
 that caused his or her unemployment and  is  not  participating  in  the
 industrial controversy.
  3.  Terms of suspension. [No] THE waiting period [may be served during
 a] AND suspension period SHALL BE SERVED CONCURRENTLY.
  The suspension of accumulation of benefit rights shall not  be  termi-
 nated  by subsequent employment of the claimant irrespective of when the
 claim is filed except as provided in subdivision one and  shall  not  be
 confined to a single benefit year.
  A  "week"  as  used in subdivision one of this section means any seven
 consecutive calendar days.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

 bility on the part of an injured employee, or  at  any  time  after  the
 employee's  death,  a  claim  for  compensation  may be presented to the
 employer or to the chair. The] WITHIN  SIXTY  DAYS  AFTER  A  CLAIM  FOR

 FOR EACH CLAIM IN WHICH THE INJURED WORKER ASSERTS LOST  WAGES  OR  LOST
 TIME  DUE TO INJURY AND SHALL have full power and authority to determine
 all questions in relation to the payment of claims presented to  it  for
 compensation  under  the  provisions of this chapter. The chair or board
 shall THEREAFTER make or cause to be made such investigation as it deems
 necessary, and upon application of either party OR AN  ATTORNEY  REPRES-
 ENTING  EITHER  PARTY,  shall  order  a hearing BEFORE A REFEREE TO TAKE
 PLACE WITHIN FORTY-FIVE CALENDAR DAYS OF  THE  APPLICATION  FROM  EITHER
 PARTY,  and within thirty days after a claim for compensation is submit-
 ted under this section, or such hearing closed, shall make  or  deny  an
 award, determining such claim for compensation, and file the same in the
 office of the chair.  NO APPLICATION FOR A HEARING MADE BY A PARTY OR AN
 ATTORNEY  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS,
 PREREQUISITES, OR PENALTIES IMPOSED BY THE BOARD. Immediately after such
 filing the chair shall send to the parties a copy of the decision.  Upon

 S. 8306--B  95
 
 draw simple interest from thirty days after the making  thereof  at  the

 and rules.  Whenever a hearing or proceeding for the determination of  a
 claim  for  compensation  is  begun  before  a  referee, pursuant to the
 provisions of this chapter, such hearing or proceeding or any  adjourned
 hearing  thereon  shall  continue  before the same referee until a final
 determination awarding or denying compensation, except in  the  absence,
 inability  or disqualification to act of such referee, or for other good
 cause, in which event such hearing or proceeding may be continued before
 another referee by order of the chair or board.
  § 3. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 3 of  section  25  of  the  workers'
 compensation  law,  as  amended  by  chapter  61 of the laws of 1986, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (c) The board shall keep an accurate record of all hearings held.  ALL
 DECISIONS SHALL BE ISSUED TO THE INJURED  WORKER  IN  THEIR  NATIVE

 tified  lack  of preparedness, the board shall impose a penalty of twen-
 ty-five dollars to be paid to the fund created  by  subdivision  two  of
 section one hundred fifty-one of this chapter and shall in addition make
 an award of seventy-five dollars payable to the injured worker or his or
 her  dependants.  Dilatory  tactics may include but shall not be limited

 cause as directed by the referee, failing to bring proper files, failing
 to appear, failing to produce witnesses or  documents  after  they  have
 been  requested by the referee or examiner or as directed by the hearing
 notice, unnecessarily protracting the production of evidence, or  engag-
 ing in a pattern of delay which unduly delays resolution, except that no
 penalty  shall  be  imposed nor award made under this subdivision if the
 carrier or employer produces evidence sufficient to excuse  its  conduct
 to the satisfaction of the referee.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.

  Section  1.  The education law is amended by adding a new article 13-D
 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 13-D
  TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AWARDS FOR DUAL ENROLLMENT
  COURSEWORK
 SECTION 645. TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AWARDS FOR  DUAL  OR  CONCURRENT
  ENROLLMENT COURSEWORK.
  §  645.  TUITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM  AWARDS  FOR  DUAL OR CONCURRENT
 ENROLLMENT COURSEWORK. 1. LEGISLATIVE  INTENT.  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY
 FINDS  AND DECLARES IT NECESSARY TO PROMOTE ON TIME AND EARLY GRADUATION
 THROUGH SUPPORTING ACCESS TO COLLEGE-LEVEL COURSES  AND  COLLEGE  DEGREE
 CREDITS  AT  THE  SECONDARY  LEVEL  WITH  INNOVATIVE  PARTNERSHIPS AMONG
 SECONDARY AND POST-SECONDARY SCHOOLS, STAFF AND RESOURCES. THE  LEGISLA-
 TURE  ALSO  VALUES  EARLY COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS, P-TECH PROGRAMS,
 AND OTHER DUAL OR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS WHICH NOT ONLY INCREASE
 STUDENTS' ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT ALSO  REDUCE  POTENTIAL  COSTS
 FOR  STUDENTS  IN  COMPLETING COLLEGE DEGREES BY ALLOWING THEM TO EITHER
 COMPLETE A DEGREE UPON GRADUATION FROM HIGH SCHOOL  OR  TO  APPLY  THEIR
 EARNED  COLLEGE  CREDITS TOWARD A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE. THIS LEGISLATION
 PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO PROCEED TO  COLLEGE  AND
 TO  EARN  A  COLLEGE  DEGREE BY ACCELERATING THEIR OVERALL COMPLETION OF
 SUCH A  DEGREE.  IT  ALSO  BETTER  PREPARES  HIGH  SCHOOL  STUDENTS  FOR
 COLLEGE-LEVEL  COURSEWORK,  WHICH  WILL IN TURN, INCREASE THEIR ACADEMIC
 PERFORMANCE. ULTIMATELY, DUAL OR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS INCREASE
 GRADUATION RATES BOTH AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEVELS.
  THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS AND  DECLARES  IT  NECESSARY  TO  PROVIDE
 FUNDING  FOR  DUAL OR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO
 HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMMING THAT CONTINUES TO  INNOVATE  AND  CONTINUES  TO
 GROW  THROUGH  PERFORMANCE  BASED  RESULTS.  STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE LESS
 TUITION ASSISTANCE FUNDS (TAP) TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE AT THE POST-SEC-
 ONDARY LEVEL AND POTENTIALLY AVOID  NEW DEBT.
  2. ESTABLISHMENT OF DUAL OR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT  TUITION  ASSISTANCE
 PROGRAM  AWARDS.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY RULE, REGULATION, OR LAW TO THE
 CONTRARY, THE PRESIDENT IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO AWARD DUAL OR CONCURRENT
 ENROLLMENT PROGRAM AWARDS FOR PAYMENT ANNUALLY, BEGINNING WITH  THE  TWO
 THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE--TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FOUR  ACADEMIC YEAR AND IN

  PART KK
 
  Section 1. The executive law is amended by adding a new  article  49-C
 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 49-C
  COMMISSION FOR THE MODERNIZATION AND REVITALIZATION
  OF DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER
 SECTION 996. COMMISSION  FOR  THE  MODERNIZATION  AND  REVITALIZATION OF
  DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER.
  § 996. COMMISSION FOR THE MODERNIZATION AND  REVITALIZATION  OF  DOWN-
 STATE  MEDICAL  CENTER.  1.  LEGISLATIVE  INTENT. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY
 FINDS AND DECLARES THAT THE STATE UNIVERSITY  DOWNSTATE  MEDICAL  CENTER
 ("DOWNSTATE") AS ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO
 OF  THE  EDUCATION  LAW, IS A VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR STATE'S HEALTH CARE
 SYSTEM. AS ONE OF THREE STATE HOSPITALS AND THE ONLY STATE  HOSPITAL  IN
 THE CITY OF NEW YORK, IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THIS
 HOSPITAL  REMAINS FISCALLY VIABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE HEALTH CARE
 SERVICES THAT THE RESIDENTS OF CENTRAL BROOKLYN DESERVE AND  DEPEND  ON.
 THE  STATE  UNIVERSITY  DOWNSTATE  MEDICAL  CENTER IS ONE OF THE STATE'S
 LARGEST SAFETY-NET HOSPITALS, WHICH CARES FOR ALL  PATIENTS,  REGARDLESS
 OF  THEIR  ABILITY  TO PAY. IT PREDOMINANTLY SERVES PEOPLE OF COLOR, LOW
 INCOME, UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED, UNDOCUMENTED  AND  AT-RISK  INDIVIDUALS
 WHO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND WHO ARE MORE PRONE
 TO  SUFFER  FROM  SERIOUS  DISEASE  AND FACE HIGHER MORBIDITY RATES THAN
 OTHER PATIENTS ACROSS OUR CITY AND STATE. IN  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-TWO,
 THE  HOSPITAL  HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUTPATIENT VISITS AND HAS
 AN AVERAGE OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND INPATIENTS EACH YEAR. IT  ALSO  PROVIDES
 SEVEN  THOUSAND  FOUR HUNDRED FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS A YEAR AND SPONSORS
 OVER ONE HUNDRED COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECTS ANNUALLY.
  PROVIDED FURTHER, DOWNSTATE IS IN THE HEART OF  CENTRAL  BROOKLYN  AND
 HAS  THE  LARGEST MEDICAL SCHOOL IN NEW YORK CITY, WHICH OFFERS TRAINING
 IN FIFTY-SIX SPECIALTIES ACROSS FIVE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES  AND  ANNUALLY
 EDUCATES  AND  TRAINS  NEARLY  ONE  THOUSAND  NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS. THE
 MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENT POPULATION IS MADE UP  OF  NEARLY  SIXTY  PERCENT
 STUDENTS OF COLOR, PRODUCES THE MOST PHYSICIANS OF COLOR IN THE STATE OF
 NEW  YORK,  AND NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-TWO GRADU-
 ATES REMAINED IN NEW YORK FOR THEIR RESIDENCY. HAVING A HOSPITAL  AFFIL-
 IATED  WITH  THE  MEDICAL  SCHOOL  IS  BOTH CRITICAL FOR THE TRAINING OF
 MEDICAL STUDENTS AND IS AN ESSENTIAL PART IN PRODUCING THE  NEXT  GENER-
 ATION  OF  HEALTH  CARE  PROFESSIONALS,  WHICH ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO
 ENHANCE THE ACCESS TO VITAL HEALTH CARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
  THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER FINDS THAT THE  ENTIRE  BROOKLYN  HEALTH  CARE
 DELIVERY  SYSTEM  REMAINS  IN  NEED  OF  A CONTINUED GLOBAL EXAMINATION,
 ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF EACH OF ITS DIVERSE COMMUNITIES,  THE  ACCESS  TO
 S. 8306--B  118
 
 HIGH  QUALITY OF CARE THROUGHOUT BROOKLYN, THE DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH CARE
 EQUITIES AND DISPARITIES OF EACH COMMUNITY, THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIAL-
 TY SERVICES  FOR  LOW  INCOME  POPULATIONS,  AND  THE  INTERCONNECTIVITY
 BETWEEN  THE  VARIOUS HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM FINAN-
 CIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF EACH OF  THE  VARIOUS  DELIVERY  SYSTEMS  IN  THE
 BOROUGH.  SUCH  FURTHER EXAMINATION CAN BEGIN WITH THE MODERNIZATION AND
 REVITALIZATION OF DOWNSTATE CONTINUING AS A HOSPITAL  OFFERING  CRITICAL
 HOSPITAL SPECIALTY SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY, BECOMING A CORE SPECIALTY
 HOSPITAL CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR THOSE CRITICAL SPECIALTY SERVICES, BUT
 SIMULTANEOUSLY  UNDERTAKING  AN  EXAMINATION  OF  THE APPROPRIATENESS OF
 CONVERTING CERTAIN DESIGNATED INPATIENT BEDS THAT ARE NOT  UTILIZED  FOR
 THE  SPECIALTY  HOSPITAL  CENTER  OF  EXCELLENCE  (PROVIDING  SPECIALTY
 SERVICES PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION),  TO  AN  OUTPA-
 TIENT SETTING, EXPANDING SERVICES TO INCLUDE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE THRU
 CLINICS, URGENT CARE OR OTHER HOSPITAL AFFILIATED MEDICAL PRACTICES.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER  FINDS  THAT  THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE
 STATE UNIVERSITY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER AS A FREE-STANDING STATE-OPER-
 ATED PUBLIC HOSPITAL, STAFFED WITH  PUBLIC  EMPLOYEES,  AT  ITS  CURRENT
 LOCATION, WITHIN AND UNDER THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY OF THE STATE UNIVER-
 SITY  OF  NEW  YORK  IN  A MODERNIZED AND REVITALIZED FORM, IS VITAL AND
 NECESSARY, AND THE STATE SHOULD DEVELOP A  PLAN  TO  ENSURE  ITS  FUTURE
 SUSTAINABILITY  AND  SHALL  PROVIDE  STATE  FUNDING  AND OTHER RESOURCES
 NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT AND EXECUTE SUCH PLAN. SUCH PLAN SHALL  BE  BASED
 ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION FOR THE MODERNIZATION AND REVI-
 TALIZATION  OF  DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER. THE COMMISSION FOR THE MODERN-
 IZATION AND REVITALIZATION OF DOWNSTATE  MEDICAL  CENTER  SHALL  EXAMINE
 THOSE  SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BE PROVIDED AT DOWNSTATE, ALTERNA-
 TIVE SERVICES WHICH ARE MORE SUITABLE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WHICH ARE IN
 ADDITION TO THE CORE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE SPECIALTY SERVICES WHICH SHALL
 CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED AT DOWNSTATE.

  1. The tenant continues in possession of any portion of  the  premises
 after  the expiration of [his] THE TENANT'S term, without the permission
 of the landlord or, in  a  case  where  a  new  lessee  is  entitled  to
 possession, without the permission of the new lessee. Acceptance of rent
 after  commencement of the special proceeding upon this ground shall not
 terminate such proceeding nor effect any  award  of  possession  to  the
 landlord  or to the new lessee, as the case may be. A proceeding seeking
 to recover possession of real property by reason of the  termination  of
 the  term  fixed  in the lease pursuant to a provision contained therein
 giving the landlord the right to terminate the time fixed for  occupancy
 under  such  agreement if [he deem] THE LANDLORD DEEMS the tenant objec-

 TATION  OR  LEGAL CONSULTATION, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT
 HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.

 rent has been made with at least fourteen days' notice requiring, in the
 alternative, the payment of the rent, or the possession of the premises,
 has  been  served  upon  [him] THE TENANT as prescribed in section seven
 hundred thirty-five of this article. NO PROCEEDING SHALL  BE  MAINTAINED
 UNLESS  THE  COURT  HAS  NOTIFIED AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN
 LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL CONSULTATION, AS APPLICABLE,  PURSUANT  TO
 SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW. Any person succeeding
 to the landlord's interest in the premises may proceed under this subdi-
 vision  for  rent due [his] TO THE LANDLORD'S predecessor in interest if
 [he] SUCH PERSON has a right thereto. Where a  tenant  dies  during  the
 term  of  the  lease and rent due has not been paid and the apartment is
 S. 8306--B  138
 
 occupied by a person with a claim to possession,  a  proceeding  may  be
 commenced  naming  the  occupants  of the apartment seeking a possessory
 judgment only as against the estate. Entry of such a judgment  shall  be
 without  prejudice  to  the  possessory claims of the occupants, and any
 warrant issued shall not be effective as against the occupants.

 MENTS AS THE COURT DEEMS NECESSARY FOR SUCH COVERED INDIVIDUAL TO OBTAIN

  §  6. Subdivisions 1 and 3 of section 749 of the real property actions
 and proceedings law, as amended by section 19 of part M of chapter 36 of
 the laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  1. Upon rendering a final judgment for  petitioner,  the  court  shall
 issue  a warrant directed to the sheriff of the county or to any consta-
 ble or marshal of the city in which the property, or a portion  thereof,
 is  situated,  or,  if it is not situated in a city, to any constable of
 any town in the county, describing the property,  stating  the  earliest
 date  upon which execution may occur pursuant to the order of the court,
 and commanding the officer to remove all persons named in  the  proceed-
 ing,  provided  upon a showing of good cause, the court may issue a stay

 time.  HOWEVER, NO COURT SHALL ISSUE A JUDGMENT AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE
 OF A WARRANT OF EVICTION AGAINST A  RESPONDENT  WHO  HAS  DEFAULTED,  OR

 TION, AS APPLICABLE, PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT  HUNDRED  THIRTY  OF  THE
 EXECUTIVE LAW IN EVICTION PROCEEDINGS IN THE NOTICE REQUIRED BY SECTIONS
 SEVEN  HUNDRED  ELEVEN, SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-ONE AND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY-
 FIVE OF THIS ARTICLE.
  3. Nothing contained herein shall deprive the court of  the  power  to
 stay  or vacate such warrant for good cause shown prior to the execution
 thereof, or to restore the tenant to possession subsequent to  execution
 of  the  warrant.  THE  FAILURE  OF THE COURT TO ADVISE AN INDIVIDUAL OF
 THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION OR LEGAL  CONSULTATION,  AS
 APPLICABLE,  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY OF THE EXECUTIVE
 LAW IN AN EVICTION PROCEEDING SHALL CONSTITUTE GOOD  CAUSE  TO  STAY  OR
 VACATE  SUCH  WARRANT.  In a judgment for non-payment of rent, the court
 shall vacate a warrant upon tender or deposit with the court of the full
 rent due at any time prior  to  its  execution,  unless  the  petitioner
 establishes  that  the tenant withheld the rent due in bad faith.  Peti-
 tioner may recover by action any sum of money which was payable  at  the
 S. 8306--B  139
 
 time  when the special proceeding was commenced and the reasonable value
 of the use and occupation to the time when the warrant was  issued,  for
 any period of time with respect to which the agreement does not make any
 provision for payment of rent.

 cation  of  any  provision  of  this  act,  is held to be invalid, or to
 violate or be inconsistent with any  federal  law  or  regulation,  that
 shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of any other provision of

 tion;  and to that end, the provisions and applications of this act  are
 severable.
  § 9. This act shall take effect January 1,  2025;  provided,  however,

 jurisdiction  above  fifteen  years  of age, upon a showing of financial
 hardship by a county [or the city of New York] upon application  in  the

  PART BBB
 S. 8306--B  149
 
  Section  1.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as the "mothers
 and infants lasting change ("MILC") allowance".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares  that child poverty in New York city and cities across New York
 state is shamefully high and will  likely  worsen  if  current  economic
 trends  continue.  Half  of the top six cities in the United States with
 the highest child poverty rates are in New York state, disproportionate-
 ly affecting communities and children of color. In New York city, nearly
 1 in 4 children live in poverty. In Rochester and Buffalo,  that  number
 is even higher: 1 in 2 children live in poverty.
  The  legislature hereby finds and declares that New Yorkers are unable
 to cover their basic necessities and support their families, particular-
 ly in the face of rising interest rates and inflation. Most notably, the
 cost of childcare, which already consumes a massive  portion  of  family
 income,  rose  41%  during the pandemic, and the total cost of raising a
 child through high school has risen to more than $300,000,  which  is  a
 $26,000  increase from five years ago and is likely to present a heavier
 burden for low-income parents and families for  whom  expenses  such  as
 food, housing, and gas comprise an even larger portion of their income.
  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and  declares  there  is overwhelming
 evidence that the  prenatal-to-three  and  early  childhood  development
 period  are  critical  for  a child's future prospects and affects their
 physical, mental, emotional and  social  outcomes  over  a  lifetime.  A
 program  targeting  infants in this formative phase would help break the
 intergenerational cycle of poverty rather than attempting to mitigate it
 later on, creating a positive impact  on  children's  lives  and  saving
 government funds down the road.
  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and  declares it is proven that unre-
 stricted cash is a direct and effective solution to alleviating  poverty
 and  meeting needs for families. This was shown on a national level with
 the overwhelming success of the expanded Child Tax Credit, which  lifted
 millions of children out of poverty with its monthly payments and led to
 a  41%  spike  in  child  poverty  the first month it expired. The unre-
 stricted cash intervention further  proved  how  an  investment  in  the
 earliest  days  of life can have multiplying effects: studies have found
 that a permanent expansion of the expanded Child Tax Credit  would  have
 generated  10  times  as  much  revenue as it cost.  New York state has
 recently made a commitment through the Child Poverty  Reduction  Act  in
 December  2021  to  reduce  child  poverty by 50% over the course of ten
 years, with the support of the Child Poverty Reduction Advisory Council,
 and there is an opportunity for unrestricted cash to support  this  goal
 and help the state reach its target.
  Therefore,  the  legislature  hereby  finds and declares that New York
 state has an opportunity and obligation to invest in its most vulnerable
 residents by leading the fight against childhood poverty, and toward  an
 equitable  economy  for  all,  through  a  guaranteed income program for
 infants.

  §  1283. LEGISLATIVE  FINDINGS.  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY  FINDS  AND
 DECLARES  THAT  THERE EXISTS IN MUNICIPALITIES IN THIS STATE A SERIOUSLY
 INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES AND  INDI-
 VIDUALS.  THERE  IS  ALSO AN INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF HOUSING FOR PERSONS OF
 LOW, MODERATE, AND MIDDLE INCOMES, RESULTING IN INCREASING LOSS OF POPU-
 LATION, AS WELL AS UNSUSTAINABLY HIGH RENTS AND PURCHASE PRICES OF QUAL-
 ITY HOUSING STOCK.  THESE CONDITIONS ARE DUE, IN LARGE MEASURE, TO  LACK
 OF  HOUSING  SUPPLY  AND  THE DIFFICULTY OF THE PRIVATE MARKET TO CREATE
 HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO MANY LOW, MODERATE,  AND  MIDDLE-INCOME  RESIDENTS
 WITHIN  THIS  STATE.  SUCH  CONDITIONS  CONSTITUTE  A HOUSING CRISIS AND
 CREATE UNCONSCIONABLE SCARCITY OF QUALITY  AFFORDABLE  HOUSING  FOR  THE
 CITIZENS OF THIS STATE, NECESSITATING SPEEDY RELIEF.  THE CURRENT CONDI-
 TIONS  OF  THE  HOUSING AND RENTAL MARKETS WITHIN THIS STATE DEMONSTRATE
 SUCH RELIEF CANNOT READILY BE PROVIDED BY THE ORDINARY UNAIDED OPERATION
 OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND REQUIRE  THAT  PROVISIONS  BE  MADE  BY  WHICH
 PRIVATE FREE ENTERPRISE MAY BE ENCOURAGED TO INVEST IN PROVIDING HOUSING
 FACILITIES  AND  OTHER  FACILITIES  INCIDENTAL  THERETO  FOR FAMILIES OR
 PERSONS OF LOW, MODERATE, AND  MIDDLE  INCOMES.  IT  IS  NECESSARY  THAT
 PROVISION BE MADE FOR PARTICIPATION BY THE STATE, ITS MUNICIPALITIES AND
 THE  NEW  YORK  STATE  DIVISION  OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY RENEWAL IN THE
 FINANCING OF SUCH HOUSING, FOR THE ACQUISITION BY SUCH COMPANIES OF REAL
 PROPERTY REQUIRED FOR SUCH PURPOSES AND FOR PUBLIC  ASSISTANCE  TO  SUCH
 COMPANIES  IN  PROVIDING FINANCING FOR CONSTRUCTION.  THE COOPERATION OF
 THE STATE, ITS SUBDIVISIONS AND THE DIVISION OF  HOUSING  AND  COMMUNITY
 RENEWAL  IS NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH PURPOSES; THAT THE PROVISION OF
 SUCH SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS BY SUCH COMPANIES JOINT-
 LY OR SEVERALLY ARE PUBLIC USES AND PURPOSES FOR WHICH PUBLIC MONEY  MAY
 BE  LOANED  AND  PRIVATE PROPERTY MAY BE ACQUIRED BY AND FOR SUCH COMPA-
 NIES; THAT SUCH CONDITIONS REQUIRE THE CREATION OF THE COMPANIES HEREIN-
 AFTER PRESCRIBED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTAINING THE ENDS  HEREIN  RECITED;
 AND  THE NECESSITY IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST FOR THE PROVISIONS HEREINAFTER
 ENACTED IS HEREBY DECLARED AS A MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE DETERMINATION.
