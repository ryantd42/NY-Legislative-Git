 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to  creating  a  food
  security, empowerment and economic development program

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds there is  a  need
 for  community  economic development to improve the food system in areas
 where there is an inadequate food supply and many residents who rely  on
 fluctuating  government  and private food assistance. There is a need to
 develop food resources and businesses in these communities that  provide
 higher  quality,  more  accessible food. The legislature also finds that
 local farmers and food producers  can  and  should  benefit  from  these
 efforts.
  The  legislature  further finds that as the federal government and New
 York state attempt to reduce dependency on government, there is  a  need
 to  support families leaving public assistance for work. One approach to
 increasing work opportunities and addressing the  food  needs  in  these
 communities  is  through  the  development of "community food security",
 which is defined as people successfully obtaining an acceptable,  nutri-
 tious diet using local non-emergency sources.
  Community  food  security projects are designed to meet the food needs
 of low income people,  increase  the  self-reliance  of  communities  in
 providing  for their own food needs, and promote comprehensive responses
 to local food, farm and nutrition issues. For  example,  these  projects
 provide  training  in  urban  gardening  and sales, assist entrepreneurs
 starting  micro-enterprises,  support  farmers'  markets  in  distressed
 neighborhoods  and  provide  food-based  educational  opportunities  for
 schools.
  The legislature supports the goals of  self-reliance,  community-based
 economic  development,  profitable local agriculture, improved nutrition
 and helping families and individuals  help  themselves.  Therefore,  the
 legislature finds that the creation of a community food security program

 jobs  and  small businesses, and ensure healthier citizens and neighbor-
 hoods.
