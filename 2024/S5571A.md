 Introduced by Sen. GOUNARDES -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN  ACT to amend chapter 540 of the laws of 2021 amending the retirement
  and social security law relating to determination of salary  base  for
  members  of  the  city  of  New  York fire department pension fund, in
  relation to the application thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section 2 of chapter 540 of the laws of 2021 amending the
 retirement and social security law relating to determination  of  salary
 base  for  members of the city of New York fire department pension fund,
 is amended to read as follows:
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to members
 of the city of New York fire  department  pension  fund  who  retire  OR
 RETIRED on and after [such effective date] JULY 1, 2000.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Chapter 540 of
 the Laws of 2021 (Chapter 540) to extend the benefits  of  such  chapter
 law  to  members  who retired prior to the effective date of Chapter 540
 (i.e., October 29, 2021).
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  BACKGROUND: Prior to the passage of Chapter 540, the salary  base  use
 to  calculate  pension  benefits for Tier 2 members of the New York Fire
 Pension Fund (FIRE) hired on or after July 1, 2000,  was  equal  to  the
 pensionable  earnings  earned  in  the  final 12 months of service only.
 Chapter 540 revised the salary base for such members to equal the great-
 er of
  (1) the pensionable earnings in the final 12 months of service, or
  (2) the average pensionable earnings earned in any  consecutive  three
 years of service.

 S. 5571  2
 
  Chapter  540  did  not apply to members who had already retired. Under
 this proposed legislation, the pension benefits for  such  Tier  2  FIRE
 members  would be recalculated to the extent that the three-year average
 referenced above is larger than the pensionable earnings in the final 12
 months of service.
  For  the  purposes  of  this Fiscal Note, it has been assumed that any
 increased benefits resulting from this  proposed  legislation  would  be
 applied retroactively to the member's retirement date.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census data and the
 actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of
 this  proposed  legislation  would  result in an increase in the Present
 Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) and the present value of future employer
 contributions of approximately $41.3 million.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT -  EMPLOYER  CONTRIBUTIONS:  The  enactment  of  this
 proposed  legislation  would  result  in an increase in Fiscal Year 2024
 employer contributions of approximately $45.7 million.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, since those that would benefit are
 retired,  and  therefore  have no remaining working lifetime, the entire
 increase in PVFB would be recognized immediately.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of FIRE to determine
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer  contributions.  Since  actual
 historical  salary  data  was unavailable, historical valuation data was
 used to approximate the impact of recalculating members' benefits.
  The 386 retired members and beneficiaries assumed to benefit from this
 proposed legislation as of June 30, 2022 had an average age of  approxi-
 mately  46.1  years, and have been retired an average of 3.6 years.  The
 average annual benefit increase resulting from this proposed legislation
 is approximately $6,500.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions  and  methods  to  be
 used  for  the  Preliminary  Fiscal  Year 2024 employer contributions of
 FIRE.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of FIRE used to determine employer  contributions  for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted  population and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not  measured  in  this  Fiscal Note are the additional administrative
 costs  to  implement  the  proposed  legislation  (e.g.,  recalculating
 pensioner benefits).

 and  Pension  Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries and a
