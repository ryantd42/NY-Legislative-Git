  IMPACT  ON MEMBER BENEFITS: Prior to the passage of Chapter 540 of the
 Laws of 2021, the salary base used to  calculate  pension  benefits  for
 Tier  2 members of FIRE hired on or after July 1, 2000, was equal to the
 pensionable earnings earned in the final 12 months of service only.
  Chapter  540  revised  the  salary  base for such members to equal the
 greater of
  (1) the pensionable earnings in the final 12 months of service, or
  (2) the average pensionable earnings earned in any  consecutive  three
 years of service.
  Chapter  540  did  not apply to members who had already retired. Under
 this proposed legislation, the pension benefits for  such  Tier  2  FIRE
 members  would be recalculated to the extent that the three-year average
 referenced above is larger than the pensionable earnings in the final 12
 months of service.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it has  been  assumed  that  any
 increased  benefits  resulting  from  this proposed legislation would be
 applied retroactively to the member's retirement date.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
