  RECOGNIZING  the  Patriot Guard Riders of New York
  for their Honor Missions in  March  of  2024,  which
  consisted  of funeral escort services and flag lines
  for the memorials of Chief Warrant Officer  2  Casey
  Frankoski  and  Chief Warrant Officer 2 John Grassia
  III
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
citizens of the State of New York  whose  lifework  and  civic  endeavor
served  to  enhance  the  quality  of life in their communities and this
great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-  standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body is justly proud to
recognize the Patriot Guard Riders of New York for their Honor  Missions
In  March  of  2024, which consisted of funeral escort services and flag
lines for the memorials of Chief Warrant Officer 2 Casey  Frankoski  and
Chief  Warrant Officer 2 John Grassia III in Rensselaer and Schenectady,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Patriot Guard Riders was founded in 2005 to shield families
of fallen heroes from those that would disrupt  the  services  of  their
loved  ones; although originally founded in Kansas, the organization has
grown to include thousands of members across all 50 states in the  U.S.;
New York State began organizing its sect in 2006 and became a non-profit
corporation in 2010; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  mission  of  Patriot  Guard  Riders  is to attend the
funeral services and stand flag lines for  military  members,  veterans,
and  first  responders  as invited guests of the family, to show respect
and gratitude for those who served, as well as support  their  families;
the  organization's  flag  lines  may  be  present  at airport arrivals,
funeral  homes,  churches,  dignified  transfers,  and  at  burials  or
internments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  current  New  York  State  Captain  Bill Schaaf's and
Assistant State Captain Ray Sestak's commitment to honoring  the  fallen
and  all  wounded  veterans  and first responders is beyond compare; and
where their countless endeavors also include raising funds  for  Wreaths
Across  America, and most importantly, organizing civilian volunteers to
place wreaths in National Cemeteries; and
 
  WHEREAS, Patriot Guard Riders of New  York  supports  the  military,
veterans,  and  Blue  and  Gold Star New York State families through its
Help On The Homefront (HOTH) program; this esteemed organization  honors
those  "forgotten" veterans who have no family to claim their remains by
securing a final resting place and arranging for a full military funeral
through its Veteran Recovery Program; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize the Patriot Guard Riders of New York for their Honor  Missions
in  March  of  2024, which consisted of funeral escort services and flag
lines for the memorials of Chief Warrant Officer 2 Casey  Frankoski  and
Chief  Warrant Officer 2 John Grassia III in Rensselaer and Schenectady,
New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Patriot Guard Riders of New York.
