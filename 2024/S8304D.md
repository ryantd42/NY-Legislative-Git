  lease termination proceedings that apply to residents following  the
  use  of  such  funds,  which  shall  be consistent with any existing

  For  services  and  expenses  related  to  the  empire  state  poverty
  reduction initiative. Funds appropriated herein shall be made avail-
  able for sixteen local anti-poverty task forces  in  municipalities,
  or  a  borough, with high rates of poverty as determined by the U.S.
  Census Bureau's 2010-14 American Community  Survey  Five-year  Esti-
  mate:  Albany,  the  Bronx,  Binghamton, Buffalo, Elmira, Hempstead,
  Jamestown, Newburgh,  Niagara  Falls,  Oneonta,  Oswego,  Rochester,
  Syracuse,  Troy, Utica and Watertown. Provided that, except in muni-
  cipalities where a state-funded anti-poverty task  force  or  initi-
  ative  already exists and is receiving or has received State funding
  for such purpose, the mayor of each municipality, or in the case  of
  the  Bronx,  the  borough  president,  will  select a not-for-profit
  organization that provides services in the municipality, or  in  the
  case of the Bronx, the borough, to serve as the local coordinator of
  each such local task force. Provided further that, except in munici-
  palities  where  a state-funded antipoverty task force or initiative
  already exists and is receiving or has received funding,  each  such
  taskforce shall make efforts to be comprised of, but not limited to,
  the  following  members:  representatives  from  municipal,  county,
  and/or state government; individuals who have lived in or  currently
  live  in households in poverty; individuals and advocates represent-
  ing local  not-for-profit  and  community  organizations;  represen-
  tatives  from local school districts; and representatives from local
  social services districts. Of the  funds  appropriated  herein,  the
  amount  available  for  each  local anti-poverty task force shall be
  determined based on the number of people in each municipality, or  a
  borough,  who are living in poverty as determined by the U.S. Census
  Bureau's  2010-14  American  Community  Survey  Five-year  Estimate
  provided  that  each local anti-poverty task force shall be eligible
  to receive funding in the  following  amounts:  municipalities  with
  fewer  than  5,000  individuals in poverty shall each be eligible to
  receive $500,000; municipalities with between 5,000 and 10,000 indi-
  viduals in poverty shall each be  eligible  to  receive  $1,000,000;
  municipalities with between 10,000 and 40,000 individuals in poverty
  shall each be eligible to receive $1,500,000; and municipalities, or
  a  borough,  with more than 40,000 individuals in poverty shall each
  be eligible to receive $2,750,000. Funds appropriated  herein  shall
  be available to support the work of each anti-poverty task force and
  such  work shall be divided into two phases. During the first phase,
  the mayor of the municipality, or in the  case  of  the  Bronx,  the
  borough  president,  will  select a not-for-profit organization that
  has  demonstrated  successful  performance  working  with  community
  stakeholders  and  achieving objectives specified herein, to coordi-
  nate the local antipoverty task force. The not-for-profit  organiza-
  tion serving as coordinator will assemble the antipoverty task force
  using  the  criteria  outlined  above.  Provided  further that, with
  guidence and oversight of the commissioner of the office  of  tempo-
  rary  and  disability assistance, each local anti-poverty task force

  shall use data to identify high need issues and neighborhoods within
  the municipality, or in the case of the Bronx, the borough; identify
  problems that are common in  neighborhoods  throughout  the  munici-
  pality, or in the case of the Bronx, the borough; receive input from
  local  residents;  use data and resident input to select one or more
  focus areas related to either one or more  issues  or  one  or  more
  neighborhoods;  and  develop a plan for how funding will be targeted
  toward the identified issues or neighborhoods. Such focus areas  may
  include,  but are not limited to childhood poverty and homelessness.
  Activities included in such plan may include, but  are  not  limited
  to:  providing public assistance recipients opportunities to partic-
  ipate in enhanced work activities  that  either  provide  recognized
  credentialing  or  enhanced  career  readiness  or  job training for
  better linkage to potential employment; assisting families in pover-
  ty through services provided to parents and children; and addressing
  chronic homelessness or housing insecurity. Such plan  must  include
  measurable  objectives  and  a timeframe for completion and shall be
  submitted for approval to the commissioner of the office  of  tempo-
  rary  and  disability assistance. Of the total amount made available
  to each anti-poverty task  force,  the  lesser  of  $300,000  or  20
  percent  of  the  total  award may be used to carry out planning and
  administration, provided however, that the amount used for  planning
  and  administration  may  exceed  such  limitation if such amount is
  approved by the commissioner of the office of temporary and disabil-
  ity assistance as part of the plan required herein.  Upon  receiving
  approval  from the commissioner of the office of temporary and disa-
  bility assistance, each such anti-poverty task force shall  commence
  the  second phase of its work, which will support the implementation
  of the plan developed during the first phase.  Funding  appropriated
  herein  shall  be  made available to the not-for-profit organization
  serving as coordinator and its use shall be restricted  to  purposes
  or  initiatives  that  do  not  necessitate  ongoing state financial
  support. Such anti-poverty task forces shall be encouraged to secure
  match funding from private sector and foundation sources to  supple-
  ment  the  funds  appropriated  herein and provided further that any
  funding provided from  this  appropriation  shall  not  be  used  to
  supplant  funding  for programs already in existence. Such funds may
  be made available pursuant to a plan approved by the director of the
  budget (931A16SP) (79994) ... 25,000,000 ............. (re. $27,000)
