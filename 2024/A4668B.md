 RATE THE POLICY AND ARE LISTED BY THE APPLICANT ON THE PRIVATE PASSENGER
 MOTOR  VEHICLE  INSURANCE  APPLICATION, THROUGH THE USE OF A THIRD PARTY
 DATABASE. AN INSURER ALSO SHALL VERIFY, THROUGH A THIRD PARTY  DATABASE,
 THE DRIVING HISTORY OF A NAMED-DRIVER USED TO RATE THE POLICY WHEN ADDED
 DURING  THE  POLICY  PERIOD  AND SHALL VERIFY THE DRIVING HISTORY OF ALL
 DRIVERS USED TO RATE THE POLICY AT POLICY RENEWAL.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have  become  a law and shall apply to policies issued, renewed or modi-
 fied on or after such date. Effective immediately, the addition,  amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation  of  this act on its effective date are authorized to be made and
