  §  8-404.  Absentee voting; hospitalized veterans, special provisions.
 1. After entering upon the registration  records,  the  application  for
 registration  of  a  resident  or  patient of a veterans health adminis-
 tration hospital as to whom the medical superintendent or  medical  head
 of  such  hospital  has attested that he or she expects that [he or she]
 SUCH VETERAN will not be discharged prior to the day following the  next
 general  or  special village, primary, special, general or New York city
 community school board district  or  city  of  Buffalo  school  district
 election,  and the application for registration by the spouse, parent or
 child of such resident or patient, accompanying or  being  with  him  or
 her,  if a qualified voter and a resident of the same election district,
 the board  of  elections,  without  further  investigation  and  without
 further  application  by the applicant, shall send to him or her at such
 hospital an absentee ballot and shall record in the signature column  on
 the  back of his or her permanent personal registration poll record that
 such ballot has been sent.
  (a) Any voter who is duly registered and  whose  registration  records
 are  marked  "Hospitalized Veteran" or "Hospitalized Veteran's Relative"
 need not thereafter make application for an absentee ballot. Sixty  days
 before  each  election,  the board of elections shall compile and send a
 list to each veterans health administration hospital  of  all  residents
 and  patients  of veterans health administration hospitals who appear by
 the records of such board to  be  "hospitalized  veterans"  entitled  to
 receive  absentee  ballots  at  each  such  hospital  pursuant  to  the
 provisions of this section. Each veterans health administration hospital
 shall no later than fifteen days following the  receipt  of  such  list,
 return  it  with  notations made thereon showing whether the resident or
 patient continues to be confined therein or has been  discharged  there-
 from.  Upon  the receipt of such returned list from each veterans health
 administration hospital with the proper notations showing that a "hospi-
 talized veteran" continues to be confined in such hospital, the board of
 elections, by mail addressed to such "hospitalized veteran"  at  his  or
 her last known hospital address and by mail addressed to such "hospital-
 ized  veteran's relative" at his or her last known address shall send an
 absentee ballot for the ensuing election to such "hospitalized  veteran"
 and  such  "hospitalized  veteran's relative" [an absentee ballot in the
 same manner as provided in this section for a qualified  voter  entitled
 to  an absentee ballot because of permanent disability]. The board shall
 record on the back of his or her registration poll record in  the  space
 reserved  for  his or her signature at such election, the fact that such
 ballot has been sent.
  (b) If the returned list  from  a  veterans'  administration  hospital
 contains a notation showing that a "hospitalized veteran" is no longer a
 resident or patient at the veterans health administration hospital where
 he or she is recorded as staying, or if such letter containing an absen-
 tee  voter's  ballot  for  a  "hospitalized  veteran" or a "hospitalized
 veteran's relative" is returned by the post office as undeliverable, the
 board of elections shall ascertain whether the "hospitalized veteran" or
 "hospitalized veteran's relative" is residing at the  address  given  on
 his  or  her registration records as his or her permanent address. If he
 or she is residing there, the board shall [not] send  him  or  her  [any
 further  absentee ballots unless he or she applies therefor in the regu-
 lar way] AN ABSENTEE BALLOT AT SUCH ADDRESS.  If he or she is not resid-
 ing at the place of residence given on his or her  registration  records
 but  the board ascertains that he or she has been transferred to another
 veterans health administration hospital, the board shall cause a central
 S. 6008  6
 
 board of registration to make the necessary changes of temporary address
 on his or her registration records and shall continue sending him or her
 absentee ballots at the veterans health administration hospital where he
 or  she  is  staying. If he or she is not residing at the place of resi-
 dence given on his or her registration  records  and  the  board  cannot
 ascertain that he or she has been transferred to another veterans health
 administration hospital, the board shall cancel his or her registration.
 Whenever  a  registration is cancelled pursuant to this paragraph notice
 shall be mailed to the veteran or his or her  relative  at  his  or  her
 permanent residence address and last temporary address.
  2.  The board of elections shall furnish to each party county chairman
 in such county a list of the names and residence addresses of the hospi-
 talized veterans and hospitalized veterans' relatives to  whom  absentee
 ballots have been sent.
  3.  Such  ballots  shall  be  mailed,  voted,  returned,  counted, and
 canvassed as  provided  in  this  chapter  for  other  absentee  voters'
 ballots.
  §  5.  Section  8-406  of the election law, as amended by section 2 of
 part HH of chapter 55 of the  laws  of  2022,  is  amended  to  read  as

 States  to a country other than Canada or Mexico, such ballot or ballots
 shall be sent by air mail.  However, if [an applicant  who  is  eligible
 for  an absentee ballot] A VOTER is a resident of a facility operated or
 licensed by, or under the jurisdiction  of,  the  department  of  mental

 the  Veteran's Administration of the United States, such absentee ballot
 need not be so mailed or delivered to any such  applicant  but,  may  be
 delivered to the voter in the manner prescribed by section 8-407 of this
 [chapter]  TITLE  if  such  facility is located in the county or city in
 which such voter is eligible to vote.
  2. When mailing an absentee ballot to a voter the board  of  elections
 shall provide a domestic postage paid return envelope. When providing an
 absentee ballot to a voter in-person, the board of elections shall offer
 the  voter  a  domestic  postage paid return envelope and provide one if

  § 9. Section 11-302 of the election law, as amended by chapter 257  of
 the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  §  11-302.  Special  ballots for board of election employees. A person
 who is an employee of the board of elections or who has  been  appointed
 to  serve as an inspector of elections, poll clerk or election coordina-
 tor at a polling place other than the one at which he or she  is  regis-
 tered to vote, may deliver to the inspectors of election of the election
 district in which he or she is registered, or to the board of elections,
 at  any  time  during the period in which an application for an absentee
 ballot may be so delivered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, a
 written statement that he or she will be unable to appear at the polling
 place for such election district on the day of an election  because  his
 or  her  duties  as  an  employee of such board or as an inspector, poll
 clerk or election coordinator require him or her to  be  elsewhere.  The
 board  of  elections  shall provide such voter a special ballot any time
 prior to the close of the polls on election day, provided  however  that
 the distribution of such ballots to such voters shall be timed to afford
 such  voters  sufficient time to cast such ballots prior to the close of
 the polls on election day.  ABSENT  AFFIRMATIVE  PROOF  OF  FRAUD  SUCH
 BALLOTS  SHALL  BE  PRESUMED  VALID  AND  CAST. Such cast ballots may be
 delivered to an office of such board of elections or  to  any  board  of
 inspectors  not  later than the close of the polls on election day. Such
 ballots shall be retained  at  the  board  of  elections  and  cast  and
 canvassed pursuant to the provisions of section 9-209 of this chapter.
  §  10.  Subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (e) of subdivision 3 of section
 8-302 of the election law, as amended by section 8 of part XX of chapter
 55 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (ii) He or she may swear to and subscribe an affidavit stating that he
 or she has duly  registered  to  vote,  the  address  in  such  election
 district  from which he or she registered, that he or she remains a duly
 qualified voter in such election district, that his or her  registration
 poll  record  appears  to  be  lost or misplaced or that his or her name
 and/or his or her signature was  omitted  from  the  computer  generated
 registration  list or such record indicates the voter already voted when
 he or she did not do so or that he or she  has  moved  within  New  York
 state since he or she last registered, [the address from which he or she
 was  previously registered and] the address at which he or she currently
 resides, and at a primary election, the party in  which  he  or  she  is
 enrolled.  The  inspectors  of election shall offer such an affidavit to
 each such voter whose residence address is in  such  election  district.
 Each  such  affidavit  shall  SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLY WITH AND be in a form
 prescribed by the state board of  elections,  shall  be  printed  on  an
 envelope  of  the size and quality used for an absentee ballot envelope,
 S. 6008  11
 
 and shall contain an acknowledgment that the  affiant  understands  that
 any false statement made therein is perjury punishable according to law.
 Such  form  prescribed  by  the  state  board of elections shall request
 information  required  to  register  such  voter should the county board
 determine that such voter is not  registered  and  shall  constitute  an
 application  to  register  to  vote.  The  voter's  name and the entries
 required shall then be entered without delay and without further inquiry
 in the fourth section of the challenge report or in the  place  provided
 in  the computer generated registration list, with the notation that the
 voter has executed the affidavit hereinabove  prescribed,  or,  if  such
 person's  name appears in such registration list, the board of elections
 may provide a place to make such entry next to his or her name  in  such
 list.  The  voter  shall  then, without further inquiry, be permitted to
 vote an affidavit ballot provided for by this chapter. Such ballot shall
 thereupon be placed in the envelope containing his or her affidavit, and
 the envelope sealed and returned to the board of elections in the manner
 provided by this chapter for protested  official  ballots,  including  a
 statement of the number of such ballots.
  § 11. This act shall take effect immediately.
