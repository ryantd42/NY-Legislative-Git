  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 7-13, 2024, as Library Week in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
those  community-based  organizations  which  unselfishly  devote  their
energy,  resources,  and  thoughtful  care  on  behalf  of improving the
quality and character of life in that community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  April  7-13,  2024,  as
Library  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with the
observance of National Library Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Library Week is a time to highlight the  value  of
libraries,  librarians,  and  library workers through this year's theme,
"Ready, Set, Library!"; and
 
  WHEREAS, First celebrated in 1958, National Library Week  marks  its
66th  Anniversary  in  2024  as  a  national observance sponsored by the
American Library Association (ALA) and libraries across the country each
April; and
 
  WHEREAS, Libraries are a treasured part of American  culture  and  a
valuable  resource on a wide variety of popular topics, inspiring people
to read, helping to improve incomes  and  health,  and  encouraging  the
development of strong, happy lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Not  only  are  they places to borrow books, but libraries
also serve as creative and engaging community centers where  people  can
collaborate  and  use  new  technologies  to  further  their  skills and
passions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Libraries serve as a resource for students, small  business
owners,  English-language learners, older adults, lifelong learners, and
many others who depend on all the resources our libraries have to offer;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The  citizens  of  the  State  of  New  York  stand  firmly
committed  to  promote  reading as the catalyst for our students' future
academic success, preparation for America's  jobs  of  the  future,  and
ability to compete in a global economy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our  Nation's  libraries  may  take  just  pride  in their
purposeful growth as they  look  forward  to  continuing  to  serve  the
educational, cultural, and intellectual needs of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Librarians  are  the  foundation  of  libraries, providing
access  to  a  lifetime  of  learning  opportunities  and  building
intercultural  understanding  and  the programming which makes libraries
immense resources to New York State's communities; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April 7-13, 2024, as
Library Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
