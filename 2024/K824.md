  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 4, 2024, as Cancer Day in the State of  New
  York,  in  conjunction  with the observance of World
  Cancer Day
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  increase awareness of serious
diseases that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, World  Cancer  Day  is  an  initiative  of  the  Union  for
International  Cancer  Control  (UICC),  the  largest  and  oldest
international cancer organization,  dedicated  to  taking  the  lead  in
convening,  capacity  building  and  advocacy initiatives that unite the
cancer community to reduce the global  cancer  burden,  promote  greater
equity,  and  integrate  cancer  control  into  the  world  health  and
development agenda; and
 
  WHEREAS, By raising worldwide  awareness,  improving  education  and
catalyzing  personal,  collective  and  government  action,  we  are all
working together to reimagine a  world  where  millions  of  preventable
cancer  deaths  are saved and access to life-saving cancer treatment and
care is equitable for all - no matter who you are or where you live; and
 
  WHEREAS, Created on February 4, 2000, at the  World  Summit  Against
Cancer  for the New Millennium in Paris, World Cancer Day has grown into
a positive movement for everyone, everywhere to unite under one voice to
face one of our greatest challenges in history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, hundreds of activities  and  events  take  place
around  the  world, gathering communities, organizations and individuals
in schools, businesses, hospitals, marketplaces, parks, community halls,
places of worship - in the streets and online -  acting  as  a  powerful
reminder  that  we all have a role to play in reducing the global impact
of cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, While we live in a time of  awe-inspiring  advancements  in
cancer  prevention,  diagnosis and treatment, many of us who seek cancer
care  hit  barriers  at  every  turn;  income,  education,  geographical
location  and  discrimination  based  on  ethnicity,  gender,  sexual
orientation, age, disability and lifestyle are just a few of the factors
that can negatively affect care; and
 
  WHEREAS, The theme for this year's World Cancer Day, "Close the Care
Gap," is all about ensuring our leaders know that we demand a commitment
to prioritizing cancer, to creating innovative  strategies  designed  to
confront  inequity, and to investing our resources to achieve a just and
cancer-free world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Locally, Pancreatic Cancer  North  America  in  partnership
with  the Firefighter Cancer Support Network will recognize World Cancer
Day in New York City to address the increased risk of  cancer  diagnosis
among firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, the Social Media Prevention Awareness Campaign
sponsored  by  Brooklyn  College  Cancer  Center  will  spread awareness
throughout Brooklyn, New York, promoting cancer prevention  habits  with
an  emphasis  on  colorectal  and  prostate  cancers impact on the Black
Caribbean-American community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is imperative that there be greater awareness of these
serious health conditions, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  February 4, 2024, as
Cancer Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance
of World Cancer Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
