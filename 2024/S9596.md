 paragraph as added by chapter 480 of the laws of 2013, the closing para-
 graph  as amended by chapter 224 of the laws of 1994, is amended to read
 as follows:
  4. Notwithstanding any other provisions  of  this  section,  a  police
 officer  shall  arrest  a person, and shall not attempt to reconcile the
 parties or mediate, where such officer has reasonable cause  to  believe
 that:
  (a)  a  felony,  other  than  subdivision  three, four, nine or ten of
 section 155.30 of the penal law,  has  been  committed  by  such  person
 against  a member of the same family or household, as member of the same
 family or household is defined in subdivision one of section  530.11  of
 this chapter; or
  (b) a duly served order of protection, ANTI-STALKING ORDER, or special
 order of conditions issued pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii) of para-
 graph  (o)  of  subdivision  one of section 330.20 of this chapter is in
 effect, or an order of which the  respondent  or  defendant  has  actual
 knowledge  because  [he or she was] THEY WERE present in court when such
 order was issued, where the order appears to have been issued by a court
 S. 9596  9
 
 of competent jurisdiction of  this  or  another  state,  territorial  or
 tribal jurisdiction; and
  (i) Such order directs that the respondent or defendant stay away from
 persons  on  whose  behalf  the  order of protection or special order of
 conditions has been issued and the respondent or defendant committed  an
 act or acts in violation of such "stay away" provision of such order; or
  (ii)  The  respondent or defendant commits a family offense as defined
 in subdivision one of section eight hundred twelve of the  family  court
 act or subdivision one of section 530.11 of this chapter in violation of
 such order of protection or special order of conditions.
  The  provisions  of  this  subdivision  shall  apply only to orders of
 protection issued pursuant to sections two hundred forty and two hundred
 fifty-two of the domestic relations law, articles four,  five,  six  and
 eight  of  the  family  court  act  and  section 530.12 of this chapter,
 special orders of conditions issued pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii)
 of paragraph (o) of subdivision one of section 330.20  of  this  chapter
 insofar  as  they  involve  a  victim or victims of domestic violence as
 defined by subdivision one of section four hundred fifty-nine-a  of  the
 social  services law or a designated witness or witnesses to such domes-
 tic violence, ANTI-STALKING ORDERS ISSUED  PURSUANT  TO  ARTICLE  SIXTY-
 THREE-B OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, and to orders of protection
 issued by courts of competent jurisdiction in another state, territorial
 or  tribal  jurisdiction. In determining whether reasonable cause exists
 to make an arrest for a violation of an  order  issued  by  a  court  of
 another  state,  territorial  or  tribal jurisdiction, the officer shall
 consider, among other factors, whether the order, if available,  appears
 to  be  valid on its face or whether a record of the order exists on the
 statewide registry of orders  of  protection  and  warrants  established
 pursuant to section two hundred twenty-one-a of the executive law or the
 protection  order  file  maintained  by  the  national crime information
 center; provided, however, that entry of  the  order  of  protection  or
 special  order of conditions into the statewide registry or the national
 protection order file shall not  be  required  for  enforcement  of  the
 order.  When  a special order of conditions is in effect and a defendant
 or respondent has been taken into custody pursuant  to  this  paragraph,
 nothing  contained  in  this paragraph shall restrict or impair a police
 officer from acting pursuant to section 9.41 of the mental hygiene  law;
 or
  (c)  a  misdemeanor  constituting  a  family  offense, as described in
 subdivision one of section 530.11 of  this  chapter  and  section  eight
 hundred  twelve  of  the  family  court  act, has been committed by such
 person against such  family  or  household  member,  unless  the  victim
 requests  otherwise. The officer shall neither inquire as to whether the
 victim seeks an arrest of such person nor threaten  the  arrest  of  any
 person for the purpose of discouraging requests for police intervention.
 Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, when an officer has reasonable cause to
 believe that more than one family or household member has committed such
 a misdemeanor, the officer is not required to arrest each  such  person.
 In  such circumstances, the officer shall attempt to identify and arrest
 the primary physical aggressor after considering:  (i)  the  comparative
 extent of any injuries inflicted by and between the parties; (ii) wheth-
 er  any such person is threatening or has threatened future harm against
 another party or another family or household member; (iii)  whether  any
 such  person  has  a prior history of domestic violence that the officer
 can reasonably ascertain; and (iv) whether any such person acted  defen-
 sively to protect [himself or herself] THEMSELVES from injury. The offi-
 S. 9596  10

 cer  shall  evaluate  each  complaint separately to determine who is the
 primary physical aggressor and shall not base the decision to arrest  or
 not  to  arrest  on  the willingness of a person to testify or otherwise
 participate in a judicial proceeding.
  The  protected  party  in  whose  favor  the order of protection [or],
 temporary order of protection, OR ANTI-STALKING ORDER is issued may  not
 be  held  to violate an order issued in [his or her] THEIR favor nor may
 such protected party be arrested for violating such order.
  Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be deemed to  (a)  require
 the  arrest  of  any  person  when  the  officer reasonably believes the
 person's conduct is justifiable under article thirty-five of title C  of
 the  penal  law;  or (b) restrict or impair the authority of any munici-
 pality, political subdivision, or the  division  of  state  police  from
 promulgating  rules,  regulations  and  policies requiring the arrest of
 persons in additional circumstances where domestic violence has alleged-
 ly occurred.
  No cause of action for damages shall arise in favor of any  person  by
 reason  of any arrest made by a police officer pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion, except as provided in  sections  seventeen  and  eighteen  of  the
 public  officers  law and sections fifty-k, fifty-l, fifty-m and fifty-n
 of the general municipal law, as appropriate.
  § 6. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law; provided, however, that  the  amendments  to
 subdivision  4  of  section 140.10 of the criminal procedure law made by
 section five of this act shall not affect the expiration of such  subdi-
 vision and shall expire and be deemed repealed therewith.
