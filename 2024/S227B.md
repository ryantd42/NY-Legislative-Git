 Introduced  by  Sen.  MAY  --  read  twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  enacting the "PFAS surface water discharge disclosure act"

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act may be known and may be cited as  the
 "PFAS surface water discharge disclosure act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals) are
 a  class  of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals. PFAS have
 contaminated surface waters and groundwater in New York and  across  the
 country.  New York has led the nation by limiting two PFAS--perfluorooc-
 tanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)--in drinking
 water by setting a maximum contaminant level for  these  two  chemicals.
 However,  no  PFAS--not  even  PFOA  or  PFOS--are  currently limited in
 discharges to our surface waters. Further, those proposing to  discharge
 pollutants  into  New York's waterways are not even required to disclose
 whether their existing or proposed discharges contain PFAS. The lack  of
 information  about  the  suite  of PFAS chemicals currently entering New
 York's waterways serves  as  a  barrier  to  developing  regulations  to
 protect  people and the environment from the harms of PFAS in our water-
 ways. The modification of existing application requirements will  ensure
 all  facilities  currently  discharging  or  proposing to discharge into
 waters in New York disclose and monitor their discharge of PFAS.
  § 3. The environmental conservation law is amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 17-0833 to read as follows:
 § 17-0833. PFAS IN SURFACE WATER DISCHARGE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT.
  1.  AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE TERM "PFAS" SHALL MEAN PERFLUOROALKYL
 AND POLYFLUOROALKYL CHEMICALS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  2. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REQUIRE ALL  PUBLICLY  OWNED  TREATMENT  WORKS
 LICENSED  PURSUANT  TO THIS TITLE TO DISCLOSE ANNUALLY FOR THE PERIOD OF
 THEIR PERMIT AND EVERY YEAR THEREAFTER  UPON  RENEWAL  OF  SUCH  PERMIT,
 THROUGH  QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  MONITORING,  THE LEVELS OF PFAS
 PRESENT IN THE DISCHARGE PRODUCED BY SUCH TREATMENT WORKS.
  3.  (A) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REQUIRE ANY NEW SPDES PERMIT APPLICANT TO
 SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION ON WHETHER SUCH APPLICANT KNOWS OR  HAS  REASON  TO
 BELIEVE THAT ANY PFAS ARE OR WILL BE DISCHARGED FROM THE OUTLET OR POINT
 SOURCE  AS  INDICATED  ON  THE  APPLICATION  INTO  THE SURFACE WATERS OR
 GROUNDWATERS OF THE STATE.
  (B) AN APPLICANT  SHALL  MEASURE  ANY  PFAS  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE
 APPROVED  OR  DRAFTED  METHOD FOR ANALYZING SUCH PFAS PURSUANT TO 40 CFR
 PART 136 AND REPORT THE QUANTITATIVE DATA IN THEIR  APPLICATION  TO  THE
 DEPARTMENT.  IF  A  PFAS FOR WHICH THERE IS NOT AN APPROVED OR DRAFTED
 METHOD FOR ANALYZING SUCH PFAS PURSUANT TO 40 CFR PART 136  IS  EXPECTED
 TO  BE  DISCHARGED, THE APPLICANT SHALL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE REASONS THE
 PFAS IS EXPECTED TO BE DISCHARGED IN THEIR APPLICATION  TO  THE  DEPART-
 MENT.
  4. EACH PERSON DISCHARGING INDUSTRIAL WASTE TO A PUBLICLY OWNED TREAT-
 MENT  WORKS SHALL IDENTIFY ANY PFAS KNOWN OR SUSPECTED IN THE INDUSTRIAL
 WASTE TO SUCH TREATMENT WORKS.
  5. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL MAKE PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE  ALL  REPORTED  PFAS
 TESTING DATA ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
 completed on or before such effective date.
