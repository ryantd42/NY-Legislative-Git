 Introduced  by M. of A. BRONSON -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Labor
 
 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to establishing healthy work-
  places
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  labor law is amended by adding a new article 20-D to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 20-D
  HEALTHY WORKPLACES
 SECTION 760. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.
  761. DEFINITIONS.
  762. ABUSIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT.
  763. EMPLOYER LIABILITY.
  764. EMPLOYEE LIABILITY.
  765. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.
  766. REMEDIES.
  767. ENFORCEMENT.
  768. EFFECT ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.
  769. EFFECT OF OTHER LAWS.
  § 760. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. THE LEGISLATURE  HEREBY  FINDS
 THAT  THE  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE STATE IS DEPENDENT UPON
 HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYEES. AT LEAST ONE-THIRD  OF  ALL  EMPLOYEES
 DIRECTLY  EXPERIENCE  HEALTH  ENDANGERING  WORKPLACE BULLYING, ABUSE AND
 HARASSMENT DURING THEIR WORKING LIVES.  SUCH FORM  OF  MISTREATMENT  IS
 FOUR  TIMES  MORE  PREVALENT  THAN  SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALONE.  WORKPLACE
 BULLYING, MOBBING AND HARASSMENT CAN INFLICT SERIOUS HARM UPON  TARGETED
 EMPLOYEES,  INCLUDING FEELINGS OF SHAME AND HUMILIATION, SEVERE ANXIETY,
 DEPRESSION, SUICIDAL TENDENCIES, IMPAIRED IMMUNE SYSTEMS,  HYPERTENSION,
 INCREASED  RISK  OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH
 POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.
  FURTHERMORE, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT ABUSIVE WORK ENVIRONMENTS  CAN
 HAVE  SERIOUS  CONSEQUENCES  FOR  EMPLOYERS,  INCLUDING REDUCED EMPLOYEE

 PRODUCTIVITY AND MORALE, HIGHER  TURNOVER  AND  ABSENTEEISM  RATES,  AND
 SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN MEDICAL AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  HEREBY  FINDS  THAT IF MISTREATED EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE
 BEEN SUBJECTED TO ABUSIVE TREATMENT IN THE  WORKPLACE  CANNOT  ESTABLISH
 THAT THE BEHAVIOR WAS MOTIVATED BY RACE, COLOR, SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION,
 NATIONAL  ORIGIN  OR AGE, SUCH EMPLOYEES ARE UNLIKELY TO BE PROTECTED BY
 THE LAW AGAINST SUCH MISTREATMENT.
  THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY DECLARES THAT  LEGAL  PROTECTION  FROM  ABUSIVE
 WORK  ENVIRONMENTS  SHOULD  NOT  BE  LIMITED  TO  BEHAVIOR GROUNDED IN A
 PROTECTED CLASS STATUS AS REQUIRED BY  EMPLOYMENT  DISCRIMINATION  STAT-
 UTES.  EXISTING WORKERS' COMPENSATION PROVISIONS AND COMMON LAW TORT LAW
 ARE INADEQUATE TO DISCOURAGE SUCH MISTREATMENT OR  TO  PROVIDE  ADEQUATE
 REDRESS TO EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED BY ABUSIVE WORK ENVIRONMENTS.
  THE  PURPOSE  OF  THIS  ARTICLE  SHALL BE TO PROVIDE LEGAL REDRESS FOR
 EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED PSYCHOLOGICALLY,  PHYSICALLY  OR  ECONOM-
 ICALLY  BY  DELIBERATE  EXPOSURE  TO  ABUSIVE  WORK ENVIRONMENTS; AND TO
 PROVIDE LEGAL INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYERS TO PREVENT AND RESPOND TO ABUSIVE

 NON-VERBAL,  OR  PHYSICAL  CONDUCT  OF  A  THREATENING, INTIMIDATING, OR

 PERFORMANCE. IT SHALL BE CONSIDERED AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR IF THE CONDUCT
 EXPLOITED AN EMPLOYEE'S KNOWN PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR DISA-

 ACTION OR REDUCTION IN COMPENSATION.

 ABUSIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT;
  (B) THE EMPLOYEE RESIGNED BECAUSE OF THAT CONDUCT; AND
  (C) THE EMPLOYER WAS AWARE OF THE ABUSIVE CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE  RESIG-
 NATION AND FAILED TO STOP IT.
  5.  "PHYSICAL HARM" MEANS THE IMPAIRMENT OF A PERSON'S PHYSICAL HEALTH
 OR BODILY INTEGRITY, AS ESTABLISHED BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE.

 HEALTH, AS ESTABLISHED BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE.

 AN ABUSIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT.
