  COMMENDING  New  York  State  Trooper  Edward  T.
  Hernandez upon the occasion of  his  designation  as
  recipient of the Superintendent's Commendation Award
  on May 16, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Law  enforcement  officers  from the State of New York put
their lives on the line every day for the citizens of this great  Empire
State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  quality  and sanctity of community life are cherished
values, worthy of safeguarding, and this Legislative Body  is  moved  to
honor  those  individuals who serve to preserve and protect such values,
lauding particularly their unwavering  courage  and  dedication  in  the
daily performance of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long- standing traditions, this Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  New York State Trooper Edward T. Hernandez upon the occasion of
his designation as recipient of the Superintendent's Commendation  Award
on  May  16,  2024,  to  be celebrated at the New York State Police 48th
Annual Superintendent's Commendation and  Awards  Day  Ceremony  at  the
State Police Academy in Albany, New York, on Thursday, May 16, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
honor those distinguished officers who would devote themselves to public
service, demonstrating great courage and diligence in providing for  the
care  and  welfare  of  the citizens of their communities and this great
Empire State; it is appropriate to recognize and commend outstanding law
enforcement officers, such as Edward  T.  Hernandez,  for  their  valued
contributions to the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  the  shooting of Trooper Richard Albert on June
16, 2023, Trooper Edward T. Hernandez, along  with  Trooper  Matthew  G.
Strobeck,  Trooper Christopher D. White, and Trooper Matthew S. Gelbman,
quickly formed a four-person team to track the shooter  who  managed  to
escape  into  the  wood  line  along  Interstate  88,  in  the  town  of
Duanesburg; this team managed to flush out the suspect  and  pursue  him
with sound tactical movements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  locating  the  suspect,  who  had  sustained  a
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,  these  brave  State  Troopers
immediately  focused  on  providing  medical  assistance which showcased
their unwavering commitment to preserving human life; the gravity of the
situation cannot be understated,  with  the  suspect  having  access  to
additional rounds, escalating the threat faced; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Within every community of the State of New York, there are
certain individuals who, by virtue of their commitment  and  dedication,
command  the  respect  and  admiration  of  their  community  for  their
exemplary contributions and service on behalf of others; Trooper  Edward
T.  Hernandez  should  be  embraced  with  admiration  and  respect by a
grateful citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  those
dedicated  public  servants  who  unselfishly  devote their lives to the
preservation of order and the protection of others are  worthy  and  due
full praise for their commitment and noble endeavors; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Trooper Edward T. Hernandez upon the occasion of his designation
as recipient of the  Superintendent's  Commendation  Award;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to New York State Trooper Edward T. Hernandez.
