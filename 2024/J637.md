  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 27, 2023, as HIV Testing Day in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious public
health issues that affect the lives of the residents of New York  State;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is moved to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim June 27, 2023, as HIV Testing Day in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  National
HIV Testing Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, National HIV Testing Day is an annual campaign to encourage
people of all ages to "Take the Test, Take Control"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In the United States, nearly 1.1 million people are living
with HIV, and almost one in seven do not know they are infected; and
 
  WHEREAS, National HIV Testing Day presents an  annual  reminder  for
people  nationwide  to learn their HIV status, and to gain the knowledge
they need to take control of their health and their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, National  HIV  Testing  Day  also  provides  an  invaluable
opportunity  to dispel the myths and stigma associated with HIV testing,
and to reach those who have never been tested or  who  have  engaged  in
high-risk behavior since their last test; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the mid-1990s, the number of people who are diagnosed
with  HIV  each  year  has  remained  relatively  stable at about 50,000
infections  per  year;  however,  certain  groups,  including  African
Americans,  Latinos,  and gay and bisexual men of all races/ethnicities,
continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV; and
 
  WHEREAS, Of particular concern is the significant  increase  in  new
infections among young gay and bisexual men; nationally, between 2010 to
2016,  young men ages 13-24 had a 22 percent increase in new infections,
and young black  men  in  that  group  now  account  for  more  new  HIV
infections  than  any other subgroup by race/ethnicity, age, and gender;
and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State leads the nation in the number  of  new  HIV
cases, with more than 2,100 new diagnoses in 2017; and
 
  WHEREAS, As of 2012, approximately 129,000 people are diagnosed with
HIV/AIDS in New York State; almost 80 percent live in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  77  percent of people living with HIV in New York are over
40 years old, and 42 percent of positive New Yorkers are over  50  years
old; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  date,  over  125,000  New  Yorkers  have  died  from
AIDS-related causes,  yet  nearly  20  percent  do  not  know  they  are
infected; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  crucial that days such as National HIV Testing Day
are observed in order to continue to raise awareness and eventually halt
the spread of HIV/AIDS in communities throughout the State of New  York,
the  United  States of America, and around the world; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim June 27, 2023, as HIV
Testing Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
