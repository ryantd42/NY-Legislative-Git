  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 25, 2023, as Bangladeshi Immigrant Day  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness and  enhance  the
profile  of  cultural  diversity  which  strengthens  the  fabric of the
communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  September  25,  2023,  as
Bangladeshi Immigrant Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The year 2023 celebrates over five decades of a successful
partnership  between  Bangladesh  and  the  United  States;  Bangladeshi
immigrants  left  family  and  friends  behind and began arriving in the
United States in the late 19th Century; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York City is home  to  the  largest  and  most  vibrant
Bangladeshi  community  in  America;  the community is spread across the
Jackson Heights neighborhood in the borough of Queens; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a variety of Bangladeshi grocery and  clothing  stores
and  several authentic Bangladeshi restaurants, it is the ideal place to
visit if you  want  to  both  learn  about  and  experience  Bangladeshi
American culture; and
 
  WHEREAS, Neighboring communities like Elmhurst and Woodside are also
home to a large population of Bangladeshi Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, Bangladesh achieved independence from Pakistan in 1971; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  September  25,  1974,  an historic day for the Bengali
community, the first speech was delivered in the Bengali language to the
General Assembly of the United Nations; it was given by  the  father  of
the nation of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than  10,000  Bangladeshis  immigrate  to the United
States annually, primarily mainly from the regions of Dhaka, Chittagong,
Sylhet and Noakhali; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, there are more  than  600,000  million  non-resident
Bangladeshis  living  in  the  United  States;  in 2018, there were over
80,000 Bengalis living in New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York is the center of Bangladeshi  immigration  to  the
United States, and today has thriving Bangladeshi communities throughout
the  five boroughs; over 250,000 Bangladeshi-born immigrants live in New
York, and it has become a hub for Bangladeshis since the 1970s; and
 
  WHEREAS, For over 20 years, the Muktadhara Foundation,  a  New  York
based  organization  dedicated  to the promotion of Bengali culture, has
 
celebrated its history and  culture  through  various  community  events
including the Bangla Festival and Book Fair; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Currently, the Bangladeshi community within New York is so
developed that it is one of the most welcoming places  for  Bangladeshis
to move to if they want to start a new life outside of Bangladesh; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is also plenty of support in New York for Bangladeshi
immigrants;  the  Consulate General of Bangladesh in New York is able to
provide consular services and support for new immigrants and individuals
who have lived in New York for a while;  this  level  of  assistance  is
testament to the development of a great community of Bangladeshis in New
York over the past five decades; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body recognizes the perseverance of the
Bangladeshi people in their  fight  for  independence  as  well  as  the
accomplishments  of the Bengali people around the world and in the State
of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim September 25, 2023, as
Bangladeshi Immigrant Day in the State of New York, and to recognize the
many contributions of Bangladeshi-Americans  to  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and Bishawjit Saha, CEO and Founder of the Muktadhara Foundation,
 
  Inc.
