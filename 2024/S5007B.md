 AN ACT to amend the state technology law, in  relation  to  establishing
  the "secure our data act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "secure our
 data act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The legislature  finds  that  ransomware  and
 other  malware  attacks have affected the electronically stored personal
 information relating to thousands of people statewide  and  millions  of
 people  nationwide.  The  legislature  also  finds  that  state entities
 receive such personal information from various  sources,  including  the
 data  subjects themselves, other state entities, and the federal govern-
 ment.  In addition, the legislature finds that state entities  use  such
 personal information to make determinations regarding the data subjects.
 The  legislature  further  finds  that New Yorkers deserve to have their
 personal information that is in the possession of a state entity  stored
 in  a  manner  that  will  withstand any attempt by ransomware and other
 malware to alter, change, or encrypt such information.
  Therefore, the legislature enacts the secure our data act  which  will
 guarantee  that  state  entities  will  employ  the proper technology to
 protect the personal information stored as backup information  from  any
 unauthorized alteration or change.
  §  3.  The state technology law is amended by adding a new section 210
 to read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
