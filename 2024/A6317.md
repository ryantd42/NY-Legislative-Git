 AN ACT to amend the real property law, in relation to enacting the  "low

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 the "low impact landscaping rights act".
  §  2.  The real property law is amended by adding a new article 9-e to

 ADVERSELY AFFECT BIODIVERSITY OF FLORA AND FAUNA. TURFGRASS MONOCULTURES
 PROVIDE LITTLE TO NO BENEFIT FOR POLLINATORS AND OTHER NATIVE  WILDLIFE,
 AND REQUIRE PESTICIDES, HERBICIDES, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER TO RETAIN
 THE ARTIFICIAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS
 ARE  NOT PREVENTED BY HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATIONS FROM INSTALLING AND MAIN-
 TAINING BENEFICIAL LOW IMPACT LANDSCAPING ON THEIR PROPERTY.
  § 344-A. CERTAIN COVENANTS, CONDITIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS  OF  HOMEOWN-
 ERS'  ASSOCIATIONS  PROHIBITED. 1. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS

 LIMITATIONS ON, THE INSTALLATION OR MAINTENANCE OF LOW IMPACT  LANDSCAP-
 ING.  A  RESTRICTION ON USE WHICH EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITS THE INSTALLATION
 OR MAINTENANCE OF LOW IMPACT  LANDSCAPING  SHALL  BE  UNENFORCEABLE  AND
 SHALL BE VOID AS CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY.
  3.  NOTWITHSTANDING  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  THIS SECTION, A HOMEOWNERS'
