 ings pursuant to section two hundred four [herein] OF THIS ARTICLE. Such
 petition  shall  be  accompanied  by proof of service of a demand on the
 condemnor to file with said court a copy of a written transcript of  the
 record  of the proceeding before it, and a copy of its determination and
 findings. Upon receipt of such petition and demand, the condemnor  shall

  § 9. A temporary commission on eminent domain reform is hereby created
 to examine, evaluate, and make recommendations concerning the scope  and
 effectiveness of the eminent domain procedure law.
  1.  Legislative  findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares that eminent domain is an important tool for government to move
 forward on important public projects. However, there needs to be a thor-
 ough examination to determine how public  projects  that  are  primarily
 economic  development  projects  affect  homeowners. There needs to be a
 balance between the needs of society and  the  constitutional  power  of
 government to exercise its eminent domain powers, and the constitutional
 liberty and property rights of the people.
  2.  A  temporary  state  commission,  to be known as the commission on
 eminent domain reform, hereinafter referred to  as  the  commission,  is
 hereby created to examine, evaluate, and make recommendations concerning
 the  scope and effectiveness of the eminent domain procedure law and the
 legislature's grant to certain public and other entities to exercise the
 power of eminent domain. Specifically the commission  shall  examine  at
 least the following:
  (a)  the  appropriate  constitutional  standard  for  condemnation
 proceedings used for the economic development where  private  homeowners
 are affected; and
  (b) the procedural fairness of the eminent domain procedure laws.
  3.  The  commission shall consist of thirteen members, to be appointed
 as follows: three members to be appointed by the governor; three members
 to be appointed by the temporary president of the senate; three  members
 to  be  appointed  by  the  speaker  of  the  assembly; one member to be
 appointed by the minority  leader  of  the  senate;  one  member  to  be
 appointed  by  the  minority leader of the assembly; one member shall be
 appointed by the comptroller, and one member shall be appointed  by  the
 attorney  general.  The appointees shall have demonstrated expertise in
 the field of eminent domain law. The governor shall designate the chair-
 person and vice-chairperson of the commission. Vacancies in the  member-
 A. 5222  5
 
 ship  of  the  commission  and among its officers shall be filled in the
 manner provided for original appointments or designations.
  4.  The  members  of  the commission shall receive no compensation for
 their services, but shall be allowed their actual and necessary expenses
 incurred in the performance of their duties hereunder.  To  the  maximum
 extent feasible, the commission shall be entitled to request and receive
 and  shall  utilize and be provided with such facilities, resources, and
 data of any court, department, division, board, bureau,  commission,  or
 agency  of  the  state  or any political subdivision thereof as it deems
 necessary or desirable to carry out properly its powers and duties here-
 under.
  5. The commission may employ and at pleasure remove such personnel  as
 it may deem necessary for the performance of its functions and fix their
 compensation within the amounts made available therefor.
  6.  The  commission  may meet within and without the state, shall hold
 public hearings, and shall have all the powers of a legislative  commit-
 tee pursuant to the legislative law.
  7.  The  commission shall submit its findings and recommendations in a
 report to the governor, the temporary president of the senate,  and  the
 speaker of the assembly not later than one year after it first convenes.
  §  10.  The sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), or so much
 thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated to pay the  expenses
 incurred,  including personal service, in carrying out the provisions of
 section nine of this act. Such moneys shall be payable out of the  state
 treasury in the general fund to the credit of the state purposes account
 after  audit  by  and  on  the  warrant of the comptroller upon vouchers
 certified or approved by the  chairperson  or  vice-chairperson  of  the
 commission as prescribed by law.
  §  11.  This  act  shall  take effect on the one hundred twentieth day
 after it shall have become a law; provided that sections nine and ten of
 this act shall take effect immediately; provided  further  that  section
 nine  of  this  act shall expire and be deemed repealed on the first day
 next succeeding the date of the submission of the report as provided  in
 subdivision  seven  of  such section; and provided further, however that
 the chairperson of the temporary commission  on  eminent  domain  reform
 shall  notify  the  legislative  bill  drafting  commission  upon  the
 submission of its report as provided for in subdivision seven of section
 nine of this act in order that the commission may maintain  an  accurate
 and  timely  effective data base of the official text of the laws of the
 state of New York in furtherance of effecting the provisions of  section
 44 of the legislative law and section 70-b of the public officers law.
