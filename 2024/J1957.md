  WHEREAS,  In  1969,  Ward  Robinson  had  a  vision  to  introduce
European-style dirt bike racing to the Town of  New  Berlin,  New  York;

York's countryside,  rolling  hills,  and  rugged  terrain,  he  founded

new sections and a few track revisions have been added  for  intensified
racing and spectator experiences; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One spectacular section of the track, Sky Shot, has become
one of the most iconic and  most  photographed  jumps  on  the  circuit;

the Olympics of dirt bike racing, first appeared in the United States in
1987, welcomed by this legendary course; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recently,  MX  Rewind, an immensely crowd-pleasing vintage
racing weekend, has been featured at  Unadilla;  additionally,  numerous
amateur  racing  events  will  excite  spectators  who travel across the
United States to Chenango County's humble Town of New Berlin; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United  States  Pro  National  Championship  Series,  a
component of the SMX Championship, made its first appearance at Unadilla

  WHEREAS, The Pro National round at Unadilla is the largest or second
largest,  drawing  crowds of more than 25,000 motocross fans; spectators

attained its largest attendance in its history, with attendees from more
than a dozen countries and 34 American states, converging on the Town of
New Berlin, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than $25,000,000 of revenue will be generated by the
famous Pro National Championship, culminated  on  Saturday,  August  10,
2024;  this series will attract many of the world's motocross racers and
their fans to participate in this prodigious event which leads into  the
SMX three-round playoff series; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than $10 million in SMX prize money is disbursed among
the  victors;  the  overall  winner  will  be  awarded $1 million of the
winnings;  the  creation  of  the  SMX  Championship  has  rejuvenated
professional  motocross  racing, and Unadilla benefits tremendously from
increasing popularity among fans; this year's event is anticipated to be
immensely successful; and
 
  WHEREAS, Unadilla is presently a second-generation motocross  racing
venue,  owned  and  operated  by  siblings,  Greg  and  Jill  Robinson,
perpetuating their father's legacy since 2010; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend those organizations that have brought entertainment and cultural
enrichment  to the citizens of the State of New York; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
