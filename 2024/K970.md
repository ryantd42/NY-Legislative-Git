  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 28, 2024, as First  Responders  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
applaud outstanding individuals within our communities whose actions and
accomplishments contribute to the health, safety and well-being  of  the
communities  of  the State of New York and to the quality of life of its
people; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 28, 2024, as First
Responders Day in the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National First Responders Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  First  Responders  are  a  unique part of New York State's
history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  First  Responders  typically  include  law  enforcement
officers,  including  state  troopers,  deputies,  all  federal  law
enforcement-based agents, and  school  resource  officers,  as  well  as
paramedics,  emergency  medical  technicians,  firefighters,  rescuers,
military personnel, sanitation workers, public works; and
 
  WHEREAS, The methods used by today's First Responders date  back  to
the  American Civil War when Army doctors mobilized new methods of first
aid, helping shape our understanding of first aid and military  medicine
today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first  civilian  ambulance  service  in  New York was
organized in 1869 by Bellevue Hospital, the oldest operating hospital in
the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, National First Responders Day recognizes the heroic men and
women who make it their business to take immediate action when  disaster
strikes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  September  11, 2001, First Responders were critical in
the hours following the terrorist attacks at the World Trade  Center  in
New  York  City,  where  60  police  officers  and  343 firefighters and
paramedics died; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January 30, 2009, First Responder Mark David  from  Cape
Vincent,  New  York,  was  killed  in  the  line  of  duty, becoming the
inspiration behind Mark's Law, elevating penalties  for  the  murder  of
First Responders in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  Hurricane  Irene  in 2011, and Superstorm Sandy in
2012, First Responders  were  at  work  helping  others  before  helping
themselves,  providing care to the thousands of fellow citizens affected
by the storms, while their own homes were destroyed and  their  families
were in need of assistance; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2015, there were nearly 1.2 million people employed as
First Responders; many of them were veterans, including 10% of emergency
medical technicians (EMTs),  19%  of  firefighters  and  25%  of  police
officers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In September of 2017, the State of New York approved a bill
honoring  First  Responders  who  saved many lives and who put their own
lives in danger; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 7,  2019,  the  United  States  Senate  unanimously
passed  a bill designating October 28th as the Nation's First Responders
Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, A tragedy of  any  kind,  whether  a  natural  disaster  or
sense-less catastrophe, never leaves the heart of the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  First Responder is a person whose job entails being the
first one on the scene of an emergency; and
 
  WHEREAS, First Responders, in many cases, are volunteers and play an
integral role in making a difference in appalling circumstances; and
 
  WHEREAS, First Responders are there whenever  people  are  at  risk,
spending countless hours, and sacrificing personal and professional time
to  promote  the  safety  of  their  neighbors;  these  extraordinary
individuals continue  to  help  and  save  the  lives  of  their  fellow
citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When others are running away from danger, First Responders
are there to make certain lives are saved, doing whatever it takes  with
an amazing capacity for courage and compassion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our  unending  gratitude  and  respect  are  owed to these
devoted individuals whose responsibility is the preservation of life and
who make that responsibility their own by serving as  First  Responders;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 28, 2024, as First
Responders Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
