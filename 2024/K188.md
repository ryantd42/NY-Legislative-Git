  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 22-28, 2023, as Doula Week in the State of New
  York, in conjunction with the  observance  of  World
  Doula Week
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 22-28, 2023, as  Doula  Week  in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of World Doula
Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World Doula Week begins with World Doula Day on March 22nd
which was chosen because it is the spring equinox, which represents  the
return of fertility in countless cultures; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The purpose of World Doula Week (WDW) is to empower doulas
all over the world to improve the physiological, social, emotional,  and
psychological health of women, newborns and families in birth and in the
postpartum period; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World Doula Week events will take place all over the world
during the same week, stating the benefits of the presence of doulas  in
birth  and  in the postpartum period including reducing the incidence of
c-sections; and
 
  WHEREAS, The presence of doulas  during  labor  and  the  postpartum
period  are beneficial to the entire family by reducing the incidence of
postpartum mood; and
 
  WHEREAS, A doula may shorten the length of  labor;  reduce  epidural
and  analgesic  requests;  increase  breastfeeding  initiation  and
continuation; increase mother's satisfaction of  birth  experience;  and
increase new parents' confidence in the care of their newborn; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals, such as doulas, of such noble aims and accomplishments  are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim March 22-28th, 2023, as
Doula Week in the State of New York, in conjunction with the  observance
of World Doula Week; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
