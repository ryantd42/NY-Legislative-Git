 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in  relation  to  exempting
  antique motor vehicles from annual motor vehicle safety inspections
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision (e) of section 301 of the vehicle  and  traffic
 law, as amended by chapter 608 of the laws of 1993, is amended and a new
 subdivision (g) is added to read as follows:
  (e)  The  requirements of air contamination emission system inspection
 shall not apply to  ANTIQUE  OR  historical  motor  vehicles  registered
 pursuant  to schedule G of subdivision seven of section four hundred one
 of this chapter unless required by federal law.
  (G) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY  OTHER  PROVISION  OF  LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,
 ANTIQUE  OR  HISTORICAL  MOTOR  VEHICLES SHALL BE EXEMPT FROM THE ANNUAL
 SAFETY INSPECTION PROVIDED FOR IN SUBDIVISION (A) OF THIS SECTION.
  § 2. Schedule G of subdivision 7 of section 401  of  the  vehicle  and
 traffic  law,  as  amended  by section 25 of part G of chapter 59 of the
 laws of 2009, is amended to read as follows:
  G. Schedule for ANTIQUE OR historical motor vehicles. For  each  motor

 item,  and is used for participation in club activities, exhibit, tours,
 parades, occasional transportation and similar uses, but  not  used  for
 general  daily transportation, an annual fee of twenty-eight dollars and
 seventy-five cents. For purposes of this paragraph, [a]  AN  ANTIQUE  OR
 historical  motor vehicle shall mean any vehicle manufactured [more than
 twenty-five] AT LEAST FIFTY years prior to the  current  calendar  year,
 and  any  other model, year and type vehicle which has unique character-

 of a distinctive nature.  Except that, with the approval of the  commis-
 sioner,  an  owner  of  any such vehicle may utilize registration plates
 issued in the year corresponding to the model year  date  in  which  the
 vehicle was manufactured, if the registration plate is legible, durable,
 and  serviceable, of this state, and accurate in color, as determined by
 the department. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit
 the  use  of  previously  issued  registration  plates  that  have  been
 restored, without deviation from their original alphanumeric or pictori-
 al  content,  to  such  condition  as otherwise satisfies all applicable
 requirements. Such plates shall be used only for the  operation  of  the
 motor  vehicle listed on the registration application and on other motor
 vehicles which would qualify for registration under this schedule  owned
 by  persons other than the registrant for the purpose of test driving by
 the registrant or his or her agent in anticipation of possible purchase.
 No such registration will be issued unless evidence of financial securi-
 ty, in a  form  prescribed  by  the  commissioner,  is  submitted  which
 provides  coverage  for  the  motor  vehicle  listed on the registration
 application and for non-owned motor vehicles being  operated  with  such
 plates.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
