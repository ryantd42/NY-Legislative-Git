  read once and referred to the Committee on Labor
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the labor law, in relation to enacting the "Empowering
  People in Rights Enforcement (EMPIRE) Worker Protection Act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Empowering People in Rights Enforcement (EMPIRE) Worker  Protection
 Act".
  §  2. Legislative findings. 1. The legislature finds and declares that
 violations of the labor law are often systemic, affecting many workers.
  2. The legislature further finds and declares that despite  the  labor
 law's  strong  protections  for  workers,  limits on the availability of
 public enforcement resources have deleterious effects on the marketplace
 by allowing abuses targeting workers to persist unprosecuted. To  ensure
 the  robust enforcement of the labor law, while minimizing the outlay of
 scarce state funds, this act allows private individuals, labor organiza-
 tions, and labor organizations deputized by the state  to  bring  public
 enforcement actions in certain contexts in which the state does not have
 the means to fully enforce labor law protections.
  3.  The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of the
 EMPIRE Worker Protection Act is to create a means of empowering citizens
 as private attorneys general to enforce the New York labor law.
  4. The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of  the
 EMPIRE  Worker  Protection  Act  is  to  incentivize  private parties to
 recover civil penalties for the government that otherwise may  not  have
 been  assessed and collected by overburdened state enforcement agencies.
 When the New York labor law is effectively  enforced,  it  protects  the
 interests  of  all  New  Yorkers and the state of New York.  Such public
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 enforcement  actions  are  an  efficient  mechanism  to  limit  systemic
 violations, will enforce the rights of more workers, and can benefit the
 department of labor with enhanced resources.
  5.  The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of the
 EMPIRE Worker Protection Act is to benefit those employers who are oper-
 ating within the labor law, and who, as a result, face  unfair  competi-
 tion from individuals and entities shirking the labor law.
  6.  The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of the
 EMPIRE Worker Protection Act is to deter employers from  stealing  wages
 or  committing  other violations of the New York labor law and raise the
 cost of noncompliance with the New York labor law.
  7. The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of  the
 EMPIRE  Worker  Protection  Act is to incentivize labor organizations to
 aid working people to report violations of the New York labor law.
  8. The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of  the
 EMPIRE  Worker  Protection Act is to facilitate whistleblowers suffering
 from violations of the New York labor law to report abuses without  fear
 of retaliation and intimidation.
  9.  The  legislature further finds and declares that the EMPIRE Worker
 Protection Act is part of a history both in New York state  and  in  the
 United  States  of  laws  enabling  private  citizens  to  aid in public
 enforcement. In similar qui tam legislation enabling private citizens to
 aid in public enforcement, the resulting action is a public  enforcement
 action.
