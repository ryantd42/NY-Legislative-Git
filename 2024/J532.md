Senate Resolution No. 532
 
BY: Senator RYAN
 
  COMMENDING  Jay  Withey,  Jr. upon the occasion of
  his designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Jay  Withey,  Jr.  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Friday, December 23, 2022, Jay Withey, Jr. found himself
among the scores of people trapped in their cars during the catastrophic
blizzard which buried Buffalo, New York in nearly  52  inches  of  snow,
leaving  countless  people  stuck  on  snow-filled roadways as emergency
personnel were unable  to  push  through  extremely  dangerous  whiteout
conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  this  time,  Jay  Withey,  Jr.  began  walking and
knocking on doors to find  shelter  but  was  understandably  denied  by
people who were fearful to let a stranger into their homes; returning to
his  vehicle,  he  took a stranded woman and child in overnight, running
the vehicle on and off throughout the night for heat before running  out
of gas; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  his  vision  and  muscles  becoming  affected by the
extremely cold temperatures, Jay Withey, Jr., fearful for his life, once
again trudged through the snow desperate to find shelter; after breaking
into a nearby school for food and warmth, this selfless  man  went  back
into the storm, searching for others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A truly brave and courageous man, Jay Withey, Jr. gathered
two dozen people who were stranded in their cars and brought  them  back
to  the  school  building  where  the group remained for 24-hours before
using snow blowers they found in the janitors closet to eventually  free
their vehicles from the mounds of snow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jay  Withey, Jr., a 27-year-old mechanic from Kenmore, New
York, played a vital role  in  this  extraordinary  rescue  effort,  and
should  be  praised  by  the  people  of this great Empire State for his
astute actions in preserving the lives of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Justly recognized as a hero, Jay Withey, Jr. richly  merits
the  admiration  of  this  Legislative  Body  and  his community for his
consummate, swift actions in saving the lives of 24 people; moreover, he
should be meritoriously commended for remaining calm under pressure  and
for  showing  valor  and  true  courage while performing this lifesaving
deed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jay Withey, Jr. has so aptly demonstrated his character and
compassion for the welfare of others, personifying,  by  virtue  of  his
action, the collective concern of ordinary citizens across the community
of  New  York State who voluntarily respond without thought of danger or
reward when others are in need of help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Jay  Withey,  Jr.  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Jay Withey, Jr.
