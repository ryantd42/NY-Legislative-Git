  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of  WDKX-FM
  103.9, Rochester, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that  the  quality
and  character  of life in this great Empire State is indelibly enriched
by the faithful and untiring  efforts  of  those  individuals  who  have
helped shape the history of broadcasting in their area; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the 50th Anniversary of 103.9 WDKX-FM 103.9, Rochester, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, In  the  1960s,  Andrew  Langston  (1927-2010)  moved  from
Brooklyn  to Rochester, New York, with his wife and son, Gloria Langston
and Andre Marcel Langston; he was promised a new job  at  WROC-TV  which
was denied after the family relocated to their new home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Monroe  County  Broadcasting  Company  also  formed a
corporation in 1968 to compete for the available FM frequency  103.9  in
Monroe County, Rochester, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  That  rejection  from economic prosperity was the catalyst
for the beginning of the story about a  Black  man  who  persevered  and
introduced the Rochester-based radio station, WDKX, in 1974; and
 
  WHEREAS, WDKX commenced broadcasting on April 6, 1974 at 5:30 AM and
has  been  broadcasting  24  hours  a day, seven days a week ever since;
Andrew guided  the  station  through  the  early  and  lean  years  that
threatened  its  existence by establishing the radio station as a pillar
of the community; WDKX has the  distinction  of  being  under  the  same
ownership since its inception and is one of two remaining urban stations
in the state of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS;  W  stands for radio stations located east of the Mississippi
River; D stands for Frederick Douglass; K stands for Martin Luther King,
Jr.; and X stands for Malcolm X; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the past five decades, WDKX has  flourished  and
broadened its programming, becoming more popular with increasing support
from the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  WDKX  is  the  only remaining Black-owned commercial radio
station in New York State and one of only a few in the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Having previously received the  first  ever  Pioneer  Award
from  the Rochester Radio Broadcasters Hall of Fame, Andrew A. Langston,
founder, owner, and general manager of 103.9  WDKX  FM,  was  among  the
inaugural  inductees  into  the New York State Broadcasters Associations
Hall of Fame in June 2014; and
 
  WHEREAS, Andre Marcel Langston has honored his parents by preserving
and perpetuating their dream; today, under his leadership, WDKX-FM 103.9
 
is part of the Rochester Music Hall of Fame and the broadcasting  center
sits  on  the  street  near  East Avenue and Main Street named after its
visionary founder; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Andria Marcella Marie Langston is the granddaughter of the
late Andrew and Gloria Langston; she possesses both  a  business  degree
and  a  master's  in  marketing,  which  have  played  a pivotal role in
transforming  the  radio  station  into  an  entity  that  transcends
traditional terrestrial radio; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  station currently places first in Arbitron ratings of
under-35 listeners, both urban  and  suburban,  and  has  ranked  second
overall in the Rochester market and first among music stations in recent
ratings  surveys;  furthermore, the station has a wide-ranging playlist,
from classic soul to current hip hop and R&B; WDKX 103.9  is  known  for
the popular Memory Lane radio program on Saturday mornings; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
those  illustrious  broadcasters  who  have diligently and consistently,
year after year, recorded the history of their communities  and  brought
local  news  and  news  of  the  larger  world  to their listeners; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the 50th Anniversary of WDKX-FM 103.9, Rochester, New York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to WDKX-FM 103.9, Rochester, New York.
