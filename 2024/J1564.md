  COMMEMORATING  the  32nd  Anniversary  of  Myalgic
  Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Awareness
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 32nd Anniversary  of  Myalgic  Encephalomyelitis/Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International  Myalgic  Encephalomyelitis/Chronic  Fatigue
Syndrome (ME/CFS) Awareness Day is observed every year on  May  12th  to
support  and  recognize  people  with  this  disease  and  other chronic
immunological  and  neurological  diseases  by  raising  awareness  and
providing useful information; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  May  12,  2024,  people  from  across  the  world  are
encouraged to wear blue to raise awareness and show support  for  people
with  ME/CFS,  their  families and caregivers, and researchers who study
this disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  ME/CFS  is  a  serious,  long-term  illness  that  affects
multiple body systems; people with this illness suffer from inability to
perform  usual  activities  associated  with  extreme  fatigue,
post-exertional malaise or PEM, sleep problems, and other problems  with
thinking and concentrating, pain, and dizziness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2018, it was reported 1 to 2.5 million Americans of all
ages, races and  genders  are  living  with  ME/CFS,  and  approximately
62,000-152,000 people in New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis persists for years or decades due
to a lack of treatments, leaving 25% of patients housebound or bedbound,
with  many  students  unable  to  attend  school and 75%-85% of patients
unable to work, costing the  economy  of  New  York  State  millions  of
dollars; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The National Academy of Medicine noted a lack of knowledge
about the disease due to a lack of research and  funding  for  research,
owing largely to a lack of awareness of the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Academy of Medicine stated that as a result of
this  lack  of  awareness  and research, many patients encounter medical
professionals  who  doubt  the  existence  of  their  disease  and  have
tremendous difficulty being properly diagnosed and accessing appropriate
medical care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  ME/CFS  is  a tragic, disabling disease which destroys the
lives of many patients and imposes a  severe  toll  on  their  families,
friends, and caretakers; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done  to  increase  awareness
and  funding at the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  32nd  Anniversary of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome Awareness Day in the State of New York.
