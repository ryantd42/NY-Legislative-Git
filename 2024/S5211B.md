  § 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to section 25 of the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow certain members of the New York State and  Local
 Employees'  Retirement System (NYSLERS) employed as correction officers,
 correction supervisors, deputy sheriff patrol, or deputy sheriff  patrol
 supervisors to receive an accidental disability benefit if the member is
 impaired  due  to a condition of the lung as a result of an accident, in
 the performance of their duties, unless the contrary be proven by compe-
 tent evidence. For members in Tiers 1 and 2, the annual benefit would be
 3/4 of final average salary  (FAS)  less  Workers'  Compensation.  For
 members  in  Tiers  3-6  who are covered under the provisions of Article
 14-B of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL), the annual  bene-
 fit  would  be  2/3  of  FAS  less  Workers' Compensation. For all other
 affected members in Tiers 3-6, the annual benefit would be 1/3  of  FAS.
 The provisions of Section 25 of the RSSL will not apply.
  Insofar  as  this  bill  affects  the  NYSLERS, if this legislation is
 enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, it  would  likely  lead  to
 more  disabilities  being  classified  as  "accidental." The cost of the
 revised benefit will depend upon the applicant's age,  service,  salary,
 plan, and any benefit type otherwise payable but would average:
 
  Benefit prior  Ordinary  Performance  Service
  to enactment:  None  Disability  of Duty  Retirement
  NYSLERS cost for  10 times  5.5 times  3 times  2 times
  proposed benefit:  salary  salary  salary  salary
 
  Further,  we  anticipate that there could be some administrative costs
 to implement the provisions of this legislation.
  All costs arising from this bill would be shared by the State  of  New
 York and all the participating employers in the NYSLERS.
