  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 23 - September 29, 2024,  as  Diaper  Need
  Awareness Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Diaper  need,  the  condition  of  not having a sufficient
supply of clean diapers to ensure that infants and toddlers  are  clean,
healthy, and dry, can adversely affect the health and welfare of infants
and toddlers as well as their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National surveys report that one in two mothers experience
diaper need at some time while their children under the  age  of  three,
and 48% of families delay changing diapers to extend their supply; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  average  infant  or toddler requires an average of 50
diaper changes per week over the course of three years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Diapers cannot be bought with  the  Supplemental  Nutrition
Assistance  Program  (SNAP)  or  Women,  Infants,  and  Children  (WIC)
vouchers; a sufficient supply of diapers can cost as much  as  6%  of  a
full-time  minimum  wage  worker's  salary;  therefore,  obtaining  a
sufficient supply of diapers can cause economic  hardship  to  families;
and
 
  WHEREAS, A supply of diapers is generally an eligibility requirement
for  infants  and  toddlers  to  participate  in  childcare programs and
quality early education programs; and
 
  WHEREAS, The citizens of  the  State  of  New  York  recognize  that
addressing  diaper  need  can  lead to economic opportunity and improved
health for low-income families and their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State is proud to be  home  to  various  community
organizations,  including  the  Central New York Diaper Bank, the Allied
Foundation of Melville, Good Plus Foundation of Manhattan, Every  Bottom
Covered  of  Buffalo,  the  Junior League of Central Westchester, Little
Essentials of Brooklyn, NYC Mammas Give Back of  Manhattan,  the  Junior
League  of  Rochester Diaper Bank, the Food Pantries of Albany, HopeLine
of the Bronx, Baby Steps  Baby  Pantry  at  Christ  Lutheran  Church  of
Newburgh, Catholic Charities-Archdiocese of New York Diaper Distribution
of Manhattan, Her Village, Inc., of the Bronx, It takes a Village Diaper
Bank  of  Waterville,  the  Food  Bank  of the Southern Tier Diaper Bank
Program of Elmira, Moms for  Moms  of  Manhattan,  the  Brooklyn  Diaper
Project  of  Brooklyn, and 914Cares of White Plains; these organizations
recognize the importance of diapers for providing economic stability for
families and distribute diapers to low-income families  through  various
channels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 23  -  September
29, 2024, as Diaper Need Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
