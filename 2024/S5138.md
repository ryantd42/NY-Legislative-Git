 WITH SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, LABOR, AND OTHER ESSENTIAL CONSID-
 ERATIONS, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE, MINIMIZE OR  AVOID  ADVERSE
 ECONOMIC  EFFECTS,  INCLUDING  EFFECTS  REVEALED  IN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT
 STATEMENT  PROCESS.  SUCH A STATEMENT SHALL INCLUDE A DETAILED STATEMENT
 SETTING FORTH THE FOLLOWING:
  (A) A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ITS ECONOMIC  AND  SOCIAL
 SETTING;
  (B)  THE  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED ACTION, INCLUDING
 SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS, ESPECIALLY TO THE AFFECTED COMMUNITY;
  (C) ANY ADVERSE ECONOMIC EFFECTS WHICH CANNOT BE  AVOIDED  SHOULD  THE
 PROPOSAL BE IMPLEMENTED;
  (D) ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED ACTION;
  (E)  ANY  IRREVERSIBLE  AND  IRRETRIEVABLE  COMMITMENTS  AND  SOCIAL
 RESOURCES WHICH WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE PROPOSED ACTION, SHOULD  IT  BE
 IMPLEMENTED;
  (F)  MITIGATION MEASURES PROPOSED TO MINIMIZE THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, OR
 OTHER ESSENTIAL IMPACTS; AND
  (G) THE GROWTH-INDUCING ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED ACTION, WHERE APPLICA-
 BLE AND SIGNIFICANT. SUCH A STATEMENT SHALL ALSO  INCLUDE  COPIES  OR  A
 SUMMARY OF THE SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS RECEIVED BY THE CORPORATION PURSUANT
 TO  CLAUSE  (IV)  OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH AND THE CORPORATION'S RESPONSE TO
 SUCH COMMENTS. THE PURPOSE OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT IS TO PROVIDE
 DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFECT WHICH A PROPOSED ACTION IS  LIKELY
 TO  HAVE  ON  THE  ECONOMY, EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS, AND SOCIAL CHARACTER-
 ISTICS OF A COMMUNITY, TO LIST WAYS IN WHICH ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SUCH
 AN ACTION MIGHT BE MINIMIZED, AND TO SUGGEST  ALTERNATIVES  TO  SUCH  AN
 ACTION  SO  AS  TO FORM THE BASIS FOR A DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO
 UNDERTAKE OR APPROVE SUCH ACTION. SUCH STATEMENT SHALL BE CLEARLY  WRIT-
 TEN  IN  A  CONCISE  MANNER  CAPABLE OF BEING READ AND UNDERSTOOD BY THE
 PUBLIC, SHALL DEAL WITH THE SPECIFIC, SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACTS WHICH
 CAN BE REASONABLY ANTICIPATED, AND SHALL NOT CONTAIN MORE DETAIL THAN IS
 APPROPRIATE, CONSIDERING THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE PROPOSED ACTION
 AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ITS POTENTIAL IMPACTS.
  (II) THE CORPORATION MAY REQUIRE AN APPLICANT TO  SUBMIT  AN  ECONOMIC
 REPORT  TO  ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN CARRYING OUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES,
 INCLUDING THE INITIAL DETERMINATION AND, (WHERE THE APPLICANT  DOES  NOT
 PREPARE  THE  ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT), THE PREPARATION OF AN ECONOMIC
 IMPACT STATEMENT UNDER THIS SUBPARAGRAPH. THE  CORPORATION  MAY  REQUEST
 SUCH  OTHER  INFORMATION FROM AN APPLICANT AS IT DEEMS NECESSARY FOR THE
 REVIEW OF ECONOMIC  AND  SOCIAL  IMPACTS.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  USE  OF
 OUTSIDE RESOURCES OR WORK, CORPORATIONS SHALL MAKE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT
 JUDGMENT  OF  THE  SCOPE,  CONTENTS,  AND ADEQUACY OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT
 STATEMENT.
  (III) (A) AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE FORMULATION OF A PROPOSAL FOR AN
 ACTION, THE CORPORATION SHALL MAKE AN INITIAL DETERMINATION AS TO WHETH-
 ER OR NOT AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT NEED BE PREPARED FOR THE  ACTION.
 WITH  RESPECT  TO  ACTIONS  INVOLVING  THE ISSUANCE TO AN APPLICANT OF A
 PERMIT OR OTHER ENTITLEMENT, THE CORPORATION SHALL NOTIFY THE  APPLICANT
 IN  WRITING  OF  ITS INITIAL DETERMINATION, SPECIFYING THEREIN THE BASIS
 FOR SUCH DETERMINATION. NOTICE OF THE INITIAL DETERMINATION, ALONG  WITH
 APPROPRIATE SUPPORTING FINDINGS ON CORPORATION ACTIONS, SHALL BE KEPT ON
 FILE IN THE MAIN OFFICE OF THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION. IF THE
 CORPORATION  DETERMINES THAT SUCH STATEMENT IS REQUIRED, THE CORPORATION
 OR THE APPLICANT, AT THE APPLICANT'S OPTION, SHALL PREPARE OR  CAUSE  TO
 BE  PREPARED  A  DRAFT ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT.  IF THE APPLICANT DOES
 NOT EXERCISE THE OPTION TO PREPARE SUCH STATEMENT, THE CORPORATION SHALL
 S. 5138  3

 PREPARE IT, CAUSE IT TO BE PREPARED, OR  TERMINATE  ITS  REVIEW  OF  THE
 PROPOSED  ACTION.  SUCH STATEMENT SHALL DESCRIBE THE PROPOSED ACTION AND
 REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES TO THE ACTION, AND BRIEFLY DISCUSS, ON THE BASIS
 OF  INFORMATION  THEN  AVAILABLE,  THE  REMAINING  ITEMS  REQUIRED TO BE
 SUBMITTED BY CLAUSE (I) OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH. THE  PURPOSE  OF  A  DRAFT
 ECONOMIC  STATEMENT  IS  TO RELATE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS TO
 THE INCEPTION OF THE PLANNING PROCESS, TO INFORM THE  PUBLIC  AND  OTHER
 PUBLIC  AGENCIES  AS  EARLY  AS POSSIBLE ABOUT PROPOSED ACTIONS THAT MAY
 SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL  CONDITIONS,
 AND  TO  SOLICIT COMMENTS WHICH WILL ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN THE DECI-
 SION MAKING PROCESS IN DETERMINING THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL  CONSEQUENCES
 OF  THE  PROPOSED ACTION. THE DRAFT STATEMENT SHALL RESEMBLE IN FORM AND
 CONTENT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT TO BE PREPARED AFTER COMMENTS HAVE
 BEEN RECEIVED AND CONSIDERED PURSUANT TO CLAUSE  (I)  OF  THIS  SUBPARA-
 GRAPH;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  THE  LENGTH  AND  DETAIL OF THE DRAFT
 ECONOMIC STATEMENT WILL NECESSARILY REFLECT THE  PRELIMINARY  NATURE  OF
 THE PROPOSAL AND THE EARLY STAGE AT WHICH IT IS PREPARED;
  (B)  THE DRAFT STATEMENT SHALL BE FILED WITH THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNING
 BODY OF EACH MUNICIPALITY OR POLITICAL  SUBDIVISION  THEREOF  FOR  WHOSE
 BENEFIT SUCH CORPORATION IS ESTABLISHED.
  (IV)  (A)  AFTER  THE FILING OF A DRAFT ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT, THE
 CORPORATION SHALL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONDUCT A  PUBLIC  HEARING
 ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED ACTION. SUCH PUBLIC HEARING SHALL
 BE  HELD  IN A CITY, TOWN OR VILLAGE WHERE THE PROJECT IS PROPOSED TO BE
 LOCATED OR, IN CITIES HAVING A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE, IN THE
 COMMUNITY DISTRICT OR DISTRICTS IN WHICH SUCH PROJECT IS PROPOSED TO  BE
 LOCATED  OR IN THE RESPECTIVE BOROUGH, IF SUCH PROJECT IS PROPOSED TO BE
 LOCATED IN TWO OR MORE COMMUNITY DISTRICTS.  THE CORPORATION  MUST  GIVE
 AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS' PUBLISHED NOTICE OF SUCH PUBLIC HEARING AND SHALL,
 AT  THE SAME TIME, PROVIDE NOTICE OF SUCH HEARING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
 OFFICER OF EACH AFFECTED TAX JURISDICTION WITHIN WHICH  THE  PROJECT  IS
 PROPOSED  TO  BE  LOCATED. THE NOTICE OF HEARING MUST STATE THE TIME AND
 PLACE OF THE HEARING, CONTAIN A GENERAL, FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION  OF  THE
 PROJECT,  DESCRIBE THE PROSPECTIVE LOCATION OF THE PROJECT, IDENTIFY THE
 INITIAL OWNER, OPERATOR, OR MANAGER OF THE PROJECT,  GENERALLY  DESCRIBE
 THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CONTEMPLATED BY THE CORPORATION WITH RESPECT TO
 THE  PROJECT,  AND  PROVIDE  AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO REVIEW THE
 PROJECT APPLICATION, WHICH SHALL INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF  THE  COSTS  AND
 BENEFITS  OF  THE  PROPOSED  PROJECT.  THE  NOTICE  OF  HEARING  MUST BE
 PUBLISHED IN THE STATE REGISTER AND THE WEBSITE OF THE CORPORATION.  (B)
 IF THE CORPORATION DETERMINES TO HOLD SUCH A HEARING, IT SHALL  COMMENCE
 THE  HEARING  WITHIN  SIXTY  DAYS OF THE FILING AND, UNLESS THE PROPOSED
 ACTION IS WITHDRAWN  FROM  CONSIDERATION,  SHALL  PREPARE  THE  ECONOMIC
 IMPACT  STATEMENT WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE HEARING,
 EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED. THE NEED  FOR  SUCH  A  HEARING  SHALL  BE
 DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES ADOPTED BY THE CORPORATION.  IF
 NO HEARING IS HELD, THE CORPORATION SHALL PREPARE AND MAKE AVAILABLE THE
 ECONOMIC  IMPACT  STATEMENT  WITHIN  SIXTY  DAYS AFTER THE FILING OF THE
 DRAFT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED.
  (C) NOTWITHSTANDING THE SPECIFIED TIME  PERIODS  ESTABLISHED  BY  THIS
 SUBPARAGRAPH,  A CORPORATION SHALL VARY THE TIMES SO ESTABLISHED IN THIS
 CLAUSE FOR PREPARATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC HEARINGS  TO  COORDINATE  THE
 ECONOMIC  AND  SOCIAL  REVIEW  PROCESS WITH OTHER PROCEDURES RELATING TO
 REVIEW AND APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL  OF  AN  ACTION.  AN  APPLICATION  OR
 AUTHORIZATION FOR AN ACTION UPON WHICH A DRAFT ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT
 IS  DETERMINED  TO  BE  REQUIRED  SHALL NOT BE COMPLETE UNTIL SUCH DRAFT
 S. 5138  4
 
 STATEMENT HAS BEEN FILED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CORPORATION AS SATISFACTORY
 WITH RESPECT TO SCOPE,  CONTENT,  AND  ADEQUACY  FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS
 SUBPARAGRAPH.  COMMENCING  UPON  SUCH  ACCEPTANCE,  THE  ECONOMIC IMPACT
 STATEMENT  PROCESS SHALL RUN CONCURRENTLY WITH OTHER PROCEDURES RELATING
 TO THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE ACTION, SO LONG AS REASONABLE TIME  IS
 PROVIDED  FOR  PREPARATION,  REVIEW, AND PUBLIC HEARINGS WITH RESPECT TO
 THE DRAFT ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT.
  (V) TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE  ECONOMIC  IMPACT  STATEMENT  PREPARED
 PURSUANT  TO CLAUSE (I) OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH, TOGETHER WITH THE COMMENTS
 OF PUBLIC AGENCIES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, SHALL BE  FILED  WITH  THE
 GOVERNING BODY OF EACH MUNICIPALITY OR POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF FOR
 WHOSE  BENEFIT SUCH CORPORATION IS ESTABLISHED AND MADE AVAILABLE TO THE
 PUBLIC PRIOR TO ACTING ON THE PROPOSAL  WHICH  IS  THE  SUBJECT  OF  THE
 ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT.
  (VI)  A  CORPORATION  MAY  CHARGE A FEE TO AN APPLICANT TO RECOVER THE
 COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARING OR CAUSING TO BE  PREPARED  OR  REVIEWING  A
 DRAFT  ECONOMIC  IMPACT STATEMENT OR AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT ON THE
 ACTION WHICH THE APPLICANT  REQUESTS  FROM  THE  CORPORATION;  PROVIDED,
 HOWEVER,  THAT  AN  APPLICANT MAY NOT BE CHARGED A SEPARATE FEE FOR BOTH
 THE PREPARATION AND REVIEW OF SUCH STATEMENTS. THE TECHNICAL SERVICES OF
 THE CORPORATION MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE ON  A  FEE  BASIS  REFLECTING  THE
 COSTS THEREOF TO A REQUESTING APPLICANT, WHICH FEE OR FEES MAY APPROPRI-
 ATELY  BE  CHARGED  BY  THE CORPORATION TO THE APPLICANT UNDER RULES AND
 REGULATIONS, WHICH THE CORPORATION SHALL ISSUE FOR SUCH PURPOSE.
  (VII) WHEN A CORPORATION DECIDES TO CARRY OUT  OR  APPROVE  AN  ACTION
 WHICH  HAS  BEEN  THE  SUBJECT OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT, IT SHALL
 MAKE AN EXPLICIT FINDING THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH HAVE
 BEEN MET AND THAT, CONSISTENT WITH SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND OTHER ESSENTIAL
 CONSIDERATION, TO THE  MAXIMUM  EXTENT  PRACTICABLE,  ADVERSE  ECONOMIC,
 SOCIAL,  AND COMMUNITY EFFECTS REVEALED IN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT
 PROCESS WILL BE MINIMIZED OR AVOIDED.
  (3) Before any sale or lease to a local development corporation incor-
 porated or reincorporated under this  article  shall  be  authorized,  a
 public  hearing  shall be held by the local legislative body, or [by the
 board of estimate], IN CITIES HAVING A  POPULATION  OF  ONE  MILLION  OR
 MORE,  BY THE COMMUNITY BOARD OR BOARDS OR THE RESPECTIVE BOROUGH BOARD,
 as the case may be, to consider the proposed sale or  lease  ONLY  AFTER
 THE COMPLETION OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT REQUIRED BY SUBPARAGRAPH
 TWO-A  OF  THIS PARAGRAPH. A PUBLIC HEARING MAY ONLY BE CONVENED IF TWO-
 THIRDS OF THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE PRESENT. IF  NOT,  SUCH  PUBLIC  HEARING
 SHALL  NOT  BE  CONVENED  AND  SHALL BE RESCHEDULED, SUBJECT TO THE SAME
 QUORUM REQUIREMENTS.

 lieu of taxes  made  by  an  agency  shall  be  allocated  in  the  same

 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES, SUCH AS  EXISTING  PUBLIC
 SEWER AND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE, WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE NEEDS OF FUTURE
 GENERATIONS;  AND  LABOR  PROTECTION,  INCLUDING ALL FEDERAL, STATE, AND
 LOCAL LABOR LAWS, RULES, OR REGULATIONS. THE AGENCY SHALL NOT  GRANT  OR
 APPROPRIATE  ASSISTANCE  TO  ANY ENTITY THAT HAS COMMITTED VIOLATIONS OF
 ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS.
  1-a. The agency shall deliver a copy of the resolution adopted  pursu-
 ant to subdivision one of this section by certified mail, return receipt
 requested,  to the chief executive officer of each affected local taxing

 fied mail, return receipt requested, to the school  board  and  district
 superintendent of each affected school district.
  2.  THE AGENCY SHALL PREPARE (WHERE THE APPLICANT DOES NOT PREPARE THE
 ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT), OR CAUSE  TO  BE  PREPARED  BY  CONTRACT  OR
 OTHERWISE,  AN  ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT ON ANY ACTION THAT IT PROPOSES
 OR APPROVES WHICH MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON  THE  AFFECTED  LOCAL

 S. 5138  9
 
 LIST WAYS IN WHICH ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SUCH AN ACTION MIGHT BE  MINI-
 MIZED,  AND  TO SUGGEST ALTERNATIVES TO SUCH AN ACTION SO AS TO FORM THE
 BASIS FOR A DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO UNDERTAKE OR  APPROVE  SUCH
 ACTION.  SUCH  STATEMENT  SHALL  BE  CLEARLY WRITTEN IN A CONCISE MANNER
 CAPABLE OF BEING READ AND UNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC, SHALL DEAL WITH  THE
 SPECIFIC  SIGNIFICANT  ECONOMIC  IMPACTS  WHICH CAN BE REASONABLY ANTIC-
 IPATED, AND SHALL NOT CONTAIN MORE DETAIL THAN IS APPROPRIATE, CONSIDER-
 ING THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE PROPOSED ACTION AND THE SIGNIFICANCE
 OF ITS POTENTIAL IMPACTS.
  3. THE AGENCY MAY REQUIRE AN APPLICANT TO SUBMIT AN ECONOMIC REPORT TO
 ASSIST THE AGENCY IN CARRYING OUT ITS  RESPONSIBILITIES,  INCLUDING  THE
 INITIAL  DETERMINATION  AND,  (WHERE  THE APPLICANT DOES NOT PREPARE THE
 ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT), THE PREPARATION OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STATE-
 MENT UNDER THIS ARTICLE. THE AGENCY MAY REQUEST SUCH  OTHER  INFORMATION
 FROM  AN  APPLICANT  NECESSARY  FOR  THE  REVIEW  OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
 IMPACTS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY USE OF OUTSIDE RESOURCES OR WORK,  AGENCIES
 SHALL  MAKE  THEIR  OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT OF THE SCOPE, CONTENTS, AND
 ADEQUACY OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT.
  4. (A) AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE FORMULATION OF A  PROPOSAL  FOR  AN
 ACTION,  THE AGENCY SHALL MAKE AN INITIAL DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR
 NOT AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT NEED BE PREPARED FOR THE  ACTION.  WITH
 RESPECT TO ACTIONS INVOLVING THE ISSUANCE TO AN APPLICANT OF A PERMIT OR
 OTHER  ENTITLEMENT,  THE AGENCY SHALL NOTIFY THE APPLICANT IN WRITING OF
 ITS INITIAL DETERMINATION, SPECIFYING THEREIN THE BASIS FOR SUCH  DETER-
 MINATION.  NOTICE  OF  THE INITIAL DETERMINATION, ALONG WITH APPROPRIATE
 SUPPORTING FINDINGS ON AGENCY ACTIONS, SHALL BE KEPT ON FILE IN THE MAIN
 OFFICE OF THE AGENCY FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION.  IF  THE  AGENCY  DETERMINES
 THAT  SUCH  STATEMENT  IS  REQUIRED, THE AGENCY OR THE APPLICANT, AT THE
 APPLICANT'S OPTION, SHALL PREPARE  OR  CAUSE  TO  BE  PREPARED  A  DRAFT
 ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT. IF THE APPLICANT DOES NOT EXERCISE THE OPTION
 TO  PREPARE  SUCH STATEMENT, THE AGENCY SHALL PREPARE IT, CAUSE IT TO BE
 PREPARED, OR TERMINATE ITS REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED ACTION. SUCH STATEMENT
 SHALL DESCRIBE THE PROPOSED ACTION AND REASONABLE  ALTERNATIVES  TO  THE
 ACTION, AND BRIEFLY DISCUSS, ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION THEN AVAILABLE,
 THE  REMAINING ITEMS REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED BY SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS
 SECTION. THE PURPOSE OF A DRAFT ECONOMIC STATEMENT IS TO RELATE ECONOMIC
 AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS TO THE INCEPTION OF THE PLANNING  PROCESS,  TO
 INFORM  THE  PUBLIC AND OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE ABOUT
 PROPOSED ACTIONS THAT  MAY  SIGNIFICANTLY  AFFECT  THE  QUALITY  OF  THE
 ECONOMIC  AND  SOCIAL  CONDITIONS,  AND  TO  SOLICIT COMMENTS WHICH WILL
 ASSIST THE AGENCY IN THE DECISION  MAKING  PROCESS  IN  DETERMINING  THE
 ECONOMIC  AND  SOCIAL  CONSEQUENCES  OF  THE  PROPOSED ACTION. THE DRAFT
 STATEMENT SHALL RESEMBLE IN FORM AND CONTENT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT  STATE-
 MENT  TO  BE  PREPARED  AFTER COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND CONSIDERED
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION; HOWEVER,  THAT  THE  LENGTH
 AND  DETAIL OF THE DRAFT ECONOMIC STATEMENT WILL NECESSARILY REFLECT THE
 PRELIMINARY NATURE OF THE PROPOSAL AND THE EARLY STAGE AT  WHICH  IT  IS
 PREPARED.
  (B)  THE DRAFT STATEMENT SHALL BE FILED WITH THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNING
 BODY OF EACH MUNICIPALITY FOR WHOSE BENEFIT SUCH AGENCY IS ESTABLISHED.
  5. (A) AFTER THE FILING OF A  DRAFT  ECONOMIC  IMPACT  STATEMENT,  THE
 AGENCY SHALL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO CONDUCT A PUBLIC HEARING ON THE
 ECONOMIC  IMPACT  OF  THE  PROPOSED ACTION. SUCH PUBLIC HEARING SHALL BE
 HELD IN A CITY, TOWN, OR VILLAGE WHERE THE PROJECT  IS  PROPOSED  TO  BE
 LOCATED.  THE AGENCY MUST GIVE AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS' PUBLISHED NOTICE OF
 SUCH PUBLIC HEARING AND SHALL, AT THE SAME TIME, PROVIDE NOTICE OF  SUCH
 S. 5138  10
 
 HEARING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF EACH AFFECTED TAX JURISDICTION
 WITHIN  WHICH THE PROJECT IS PROPOSED TO BE LOCATED. THE NOTICE OF HEAR-
 ING MUST STATE THE TIME AND PLACE OF THE  HEARING,  CONTAIN  A  GENERAL,
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT, DESCRIBE THE PROSPECTIVE LOCATION
 OF  THE PROJECT, IDENTIFY THE INITIAL OWNER, OPERATOR, OR MANAGER OF THE
 PROJECT, GENERALLY DESCRIBE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CONTEMPLATED BY THE
 AGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROJECT, AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY  FOR  THE
 PUBLIC  TO REVIEW THE PROJECT APPLICATION, WHICH SHALL INCLUDE AN ANALY-
 SIS OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED  PROJECT.  THE  NOTICE  OF
 HEARING  MUST  BE PUBLISHED IN THE STATE REGISTER AND THE WEBSITE OF THE
 AGENCY.
  (B) IF THE AGENCY DETERMINES TO HOLD SUCH A HEARING, IT SHALL COMMENCE
 THE HEARING WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE FILING  AND,  UNLESS  THE  PROPOSED
 ACTION  IS  WITHDRAWN  FROM  CONSIDERATION,  SHALL  PREPARE THE ECONOMIC
 IMPACT STATEMENT WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE  HEARING,
 EXCEPT  AS  OTHERWISE  PROVIDED.  THE  NEED  FOR SUCH A HEARING SHALL BE
 DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES ADOPTED BY THE AGENCY  PURSUANT
 TO  SECTION  EIGHT  HUNDRED  FIFTY-EIGHT OF THIS TITLE. IF NO HEARING IS
 HELD, THE AGENCY SHALL PREPARE AND MAKE AVAILABLE  THE  ECONOMIC  IMPACT
 STATEMENT  WITHIN  SIXTY  DAYS  AFTER THE FILING OF THE DRAFT, EXCEPT AS
 OTHERWISE PROVIDED.
  (C) NOTWITHSTANDING THE SPECIFIED TIME  PERIODS  ESTABLISHED  BY  THIS
 ARTICLE, AN AGENCY SHALL VARY THE TIMES SO ESTABLISHED HEREIN FOR PREPA-
 RATION, REVIEW AND PUBLIC HEARINGS TO COORDINATE THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
 REVIEW  PROCESS WITH OTHER PROCEDURES RELATING TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF
 AN ACTION. AN APPLICATION OR AUTHORIZATION FOR AN ACTION  UPON  WHICH  A
 DRAFT  ECONOMIC  IMPACT STATEMENT IS DETERMINED TO BE REQUIRED SHALL NOT
 BE COMPLETE UNTIL SUCH DRAFT STATEMENT HAS BEEN FILED  AND  ACCEPTED  BY
 THE  AGENCY AS SATISFACTORY WITH RESPECT TO SCOPE, CONTENT, AND ADEQUACY
 FOR PURPOSES OF SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION. COMMENCING  UPON  SUCH
 ACCEPTANCE, THE ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT PROCESS SHALL RUN CONCURRENTLY
 WITH OTHER PROCEDURES RELATING TO THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE ACTION,
 SO  LONG  AS  REASONABLE  TIME  IS PROVIDED FOR PREPARATION, REVIEW, AND
 PUBLIC HEARINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE DRAFT ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT.
  6. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE,  THE  ECONOMIC  IMPACT  STATEMENT  PREPARED
 PURSUANT  TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION, TOGETHER WITH THE COMMENTS
 OF PUBLIC AGENCIES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, SHALL BE  FILED  WITH  THE
 GOVERNING  BODY  OF  EACH  MUNICIPALITY FOR WHOSE BENEFIT SUCH AGENCY IS
 ESTABLISHED AND MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC  PRIOR  TO  ACTING  ON  THE
 PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT.
  7.  AN  AGENCY  MAY  CHARGE A FEE TO AN APPLICANT TO RECOVER THE COSTS
 INCURRED IN PREPARING OR CAUSING TO BE PREPARED  OR  REVIEWING  A  DRAFT
 ECONOMIC  IMPACT STATEMENT OR AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT ON THE ACTION
 WHICH THE APPLICANT REQUESTS FROM THE AGENCY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT AN
 APPLICANT MAY NOT BE CHARGED A SEPARATE FEE FOR BOTH THE PREPARATION AND
 REVIEW OF SUCH STATEMENTS. THE TECHNICAL SERVICES OF THE AGENCY  MAY  BE
 MADE AVAILABLE ON A FEE BASIS REFLECTING THE COSTS THEREOF TO A REQUEST-
 ING AGENCY, WHICH FEE OR FEES MAY APPROPRIATELY BE CHARGED BY THE AGENCY
 TO  THE APPLICANT UNDER RULES AND REGULATIONS TO BE ISSUED BY THE AGENCY
 FOR SUCH PURPOSE UNDER SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY-EIGHT OF THIS TITLE.
  8. WHEN AN AGENCY DECIDES TO CARRY OUT OR APPROVE AN ACTION WHICH  HAS
 BEEN  THE  SUBJECT  OF  AN  ECONOMIC  IMPACT STATEMENT, IT SHALL MAKE AN
 EXPLICIT FINDING THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN MET AND
 THAT, CONSISTENT WITH SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND  OTHER  ESSENTIAL  CONSIDER-
 ATIONS, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE, ADVERSE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND
 S. 5138  11

 COMMUNITY EFFECTS REVEALED IN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT PROCESS WILL
 BE MINIMIZED OR AVOIDED.

 ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES, SUCH AS EXISTING
 PUBLIC SEWER AND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE, WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE NEEDS OF
 FUTURE  GENERATIONS; AND LABOR PROTECTION, INCLUDING ALL FEDERAL, STATE,
 AND LOCAL LABOR LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS. THE AGENCY SHALL  NOT  GRANT
 OR APPROPRIATE ASSISTANCE TO ANY ENTITY THAT HAS COMMITTED VIOLATIONS OF
 ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS.
  [4.] 11. Each agency shall develop a standard application form,  which

 agency involvement in the project.
  [5.]  12.  Each agency shall develop, and adopt by resolution, uniform
 criteria for the evaluation and selection for each category of  projects
 for  which  financial  assistance  will  be  provided. At a minimum, the
 criteria shall require that, for each project, the following must  occur

 tax  agreement that contains the same information may be attached to the
 uniform agency project agreement;

 assistance, or for the modification of any payment in lieu of tax agree-
 ment  to  require increased payments, in accordance with policies devel-
