 AN  ACT  directing  the  departments  of  environmental conservation and
  health to establish environmental standards for ambient lead and  lead
  contamination  in  soils;  and  providing  for  the  repeal  of  such
  provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings. The legislature finds and declares
 that there is a present  need  to  establish  New  York  standards  with
 respect  to  levels  of ambient lead and levels of lead contamination in
 soils and on floors and window sills. The  legislature  finds  that  the
 current  regulatory  standards  are  inadequate  to  protect the general
 public and particularly small  children  from  the  harmful  effects  of
 ingesting  or  inhaling  lead dust, often resulting from lead paint, and
 coming into contact with  lead  on  exposed  surfaces.  The  legislature
 declares  that  it  shall  be  the responsibility of the commissioner of
 environmental conservation, in consultation  with  the  commissioner  of
 health,  to  adopt  standards for ambient lead and lead contamination of
 soil and windows and floors, in a manner that would be fully  protective
 of children's health, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
 the environmental conservation law.
  § 2. a. No later than March 31, 2025, the departments of environmental
 conservation  and  health  shall  propose  new standards, and update any
 existing standards as appropriate,  for  dust  lead  hazards,  soil-lead
 hazards and ambient air quality standards for the level of lead in vari-
 ous  media that will result in blood lead levels that are no higher than
 a target that is fully protective of human health and which at a minimum
 include consideration of recommendations from the  centers  for  disease
 control.

  b.  No  later than June 1, 2025, such departments shall issue a report
 to the legislature describing the status of such reviews, adoptions, and
 revisions and expected health improvements resulting therefrom.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law and shall expire and be deemed repealed July 1,  2025.
 Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule
 or regulation necessary for the implementation of this act on its effec-
 tive  date  are  authorized  to  be made and completed on or before such
 date.
