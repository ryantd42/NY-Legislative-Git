 Introduced  by  Sen. ADDABBO -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Racing, Gaming and  Wager-
  ing
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law and
  the penal law, in relation to allowing certain interactive poker games
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  racing,  pari-mutuel  wagering  and  breeding law is
 amended by adding a new article 15 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 15
  INTERACTIVE POKER
 SECTION 1500. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
  1501. DEFINITIONS.
  1502. AUTHORIZATION.
  1503. REQUIRED SAFEGUARDS/MINIMUM STANDARDS.
  1504. SCOPE OF LICENSING REVIEW.
  1505. TAXATION AND FEES.
  § 1500. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS
 AND DECLARES THAT: 1. UNDER THE NEW YORK PENAL LAW A PERSON  ENGAGES  IN
 GAMBLING  WHEN  HE  OR  SHE  STAKES OR RISKS SOMETHING OF VALUE UPON THE
 OUTCOME OF A CONTEST OF CHANCE OR A FUTURE CONTINGENT  EVENT  NOT  UNDER
 HIS OR HER CONTROL OR INFLUENCE, UPON AN AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING THAT
 HE  OR  SHE  WILL  RECEIVE  SOMETHING OF VALUE IN THE EVENT OF A CERTAIN
 OUTCOME.
  2. A CONTEST OF CHANCE IS DEFINED AS ANY CONTEST, GAME, GAMING  SCHEME
 OR  GAMING DEVICE IN WHICH THE OUTCOME DEPENDS IN A MATERIAL DEGREE UPON
 AN ELEMENT OF CHANCE, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT SKILL OF THE CONTESTANTS  MAY
 ALSO  BE A FACTOR THEREIN. (SUBDIVISION 1 OF SECTION 225.00 OF THE PENAL
 LAW). THUS, GAMES OF CHANCE MAY INVOLVE SOME SKILL, BUT IN  THOSE  GAMES
 THE  LEVEL  OF  SKILL  DOES  NOT DETERMINE THE OUTCOME REGARDLESS OF THE
 DEGREE OF SKILL EMPLOYED. SEE PEOPLE V. TURNER, 165 MISC. 2D  222,  224,
 629  N.Y.S.2D  661,  662  (CRIM.  CT.  1995). ON THE OTHER HAND, WHERE A
 CONTEST PITS THE SKILL LEVELS OF THE PLAYERS  AGAINST  EACH  OTHER,  NEW
 YORK COURTS HAVE FOUND A GAME TO BE ONE OF SKILL RATHER THAN CHANCE. SEE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 9226  2
 
 PEOPLE  V.  HUNT,  162 MISC. 2D 70, 72, 616 N.Y.S.2D 168, 170 (CRIM. CT.
 1994) ("PLAYED FAIRLY, SKILL RATHER THAN CHANCE IS THE  MATERIAL  COMPO-
 NENT OF THREE-CARD MONTE.");
  3.  POKER  IN MANY INSTANCES HAS BEEN DEFINED AS A GAME OF SKILL AND A
 NEW YORK FEDERAL COURT IN U.S. V. DICRISTINA, 886 F. SUPP. 2D 164,  224,
 ASSESSED THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW POKER WAS PREDOMINANTLY A GAME OF SKILL;
  4.  NEW  YORK  COURTS  HAVE  INTERPRETED  NEW YORK LAW TO APPLY A MORE
 RIGOROUS TEST IN IDENTIFYING A "CONTEST OF CHANCE" THAN  IS  APPLIED  BY
 MOST  STATES  IN  THIS  NATION  AND  THE  COURTS HAVE FOUND THAT WHERE A
 CONTEST PITS THE SKILL LEVELS OF THE PLAYERS AGAINST EACH  OTHER,  THOSE
 GAMES  ARE  GAMES  OF  SKILL  AND  NOT GAMES OF CHANCE. FURTHERMORE, THE
 COURTS HAVE NOT LIMITED THE  LEGISLATURE'S  ABILITY  TO  DETERMINE  THAT
 CERTAIN  FORMS  OF  POKER  SHOULD FALL OUTSIDE THE GENERAL DEFINITION OF
 GAMBLING SINCE THOSE GAMES ARE GAMES OF SKILL;
  5. TEXAS HOLD'EM POKER INVOLVES TWO CARDS  DEALT  FACE  DOWN  TO  EACH
 PLAYER  AND  THEN  FIVE  COMMUNITY CARDS PLACED FACE-UP BY THE DEALER, A
 SERIES OF THREE, THEN TWO ADDITIONAL SINGLE CARDS, WITH  PLAYERS  DETER-
 MINING  WHETHER  TO  CHECK,  BET,  RAISE  OR FOLD AFTER EACH DEAL. OMAHA
 HOLD'EM POKER IS A SIMILAR GAME, IN WHICH  EACH  PLAYER  IS  DEALT  FOUR
 CARDS  AND  MAKES  HIS  OR HER BEST HAND USING EXACTLY TWO OF THEM, PLUS
 EXACTLY THREE OF THE FIVE COMMUNITY CARDS. THESE GAMES ARE CONSIDERED TO
 BE COMPLEX FORMS OF POKER WHICH INVOLVE PLAYER  STRATEGY  AND  DECISION-
 MAKING AND WHICH PIT THE SKILL LEVELS OF THE PLAYERS AGAINST EACH OTHER.
 AS GAMES OF SKILL, THESE FORMS OF POKER DO NOT FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION
 OF GAMBLING AS PROHIBITED BY THE PENAL LAW; AND
  6.  THE  LEGISLATURE  FURTHER FINDS THAT AS THE INTERNET HAS BECOME AN
 INTEGRAL PART OF SOCIETY, AND INTERNET POKER  A  MAJOR  FORM  OF  ENTER-
 TAINMENT  FOR  MANY  CONSUMERS,  ANY  INTERACTIVE GAMING ENFORCEMENT AND
 REGULATORY STRUCTURE MUST BEGIN FROM THE BEDROCK  PREMISE  THAT  PARTIC-
 IPATION  IN A LAWFUL AND LICENSED GAMING INDUSTRY IS A PRIVILEGE AND NOT
 A RIGHT, AND THAT REGULATORY OVERSIGHT  IS  INTENDED  TO  SAFEGUARD  THE
 INTEGRITY OF THE GAMES AND PARTICIPANTS AND TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND
 THE PUBLIC TRUST.

 CANT'S)  HOLDING OR INTERMEDIARY COMPANIES, SHALL BE GRANTED A WAIVER OF
 ANY INVESTIGATION OF SUITABILITY OR OTHER REQUIREMENT IF SUCH SECURITIES
 ARE THOSE OF A CORPORATION, WHETHER PUBLICLY TRADED OR  PRIVATELY  HELD,
 AND  ITS  HOLDINGS  OF  SUCH  SECURITIES  WERE  PURCHASED FOR INVESTMENT
 PURPOSES ONLY AND IT FILES A CERTIFIED STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT  THAT  IT
 HAS  NO INTENTION OF INFLUENCING OR AFFECTING THE AFFAIRS OF THE ISSUER,
 THE LICENSEE (OR SIGNIFICANT VENDOR OR APPLICANT, AS APPLICABLE) OR  ITS
 HOLDING  OR  INTERMEDIARY COMPANIES; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IT SHALL BE
 PERMITTED TO VOTE ON MATTERS PUT TO THE VOTE OF THE OUTSTANDING SECURITY
 HOLDERS. THE COMMISSION MAY GRANT SUCH  A  WAIVER  TO  AN  INSTITUTIONAL
 INVESTOR  HOLDING  A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SUCH SECURITIES UPON A SHOWING

 ISSUER; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IT SHALL BE PERMITTED TO VOTE ON MATTERS
 PUT TO THE VOTE OF THE OUTSTANDING SECURITY HOLDERS. IF AN INSTITUTIONAL
 INVESTOR CHANGES ITS INVESTMENT  INTENT,  OR  IF  THE  COMMISSION  FINDS
 REASONABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR MAY BE FOUND
 UNSUITABLE,  NO  ACTION  OTHER  THAN  DIVESTITURE SHALL BE TAKEN BY SUCH
 INVESTOR WITH RESPECT TO ITS SECURITY  HOLDINGS  UNTIL  THERE  HAS  BEEN
 COMPLIANCE  WITH  ANY  REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMISSION, WHICH

 ICANT VENDOR OR APPLICANT, AS  APPLICABLE)  AND  ITS  RELEVANT  HOLDING,
 INTERMEDIARY  OR  SUBSIDIARY  COMPANY  SHALL NOTIFY THE COMMISSION IMME-
 DIATELY OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT, OR ACTIONS OF, AN INSTITUTIONAL INVES-
 TOR HOLDING ITS EQUITY SECURITIES WHERE SUCH INFORMATION OR  ACTION  MAY
 IMPACT  UPON THE ELIGIBILITY OF SUCH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR FOR A WAIVER
 PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH.

 SUBSIDIARY COMPANY OF A HOLDING OR INTERMEDIARY COMPANY OF A LICENSEE OR
 SIGNIFICANT  VENDOR  OR  APPLICANT  WHICH  IS  RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE
 FINANCING OF THE LICENSEE OR SIGNIFICANT VENDOR OR APPLICANT,  FAILS  TO
 COMPLY  WITH  THE  TERMS  OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SECTION, OR IF AT ANY
 TIME THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT, BY REASON OF THE EXTENT OR NATURE OF ITS
 HOLDINGS, AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR IS IN A POSITION TO EXERCISE SUCH  A
 SUBSTANTIAL  IMPACT  UPON  THE  CONTROLLING  INTERESTS  OF A LICENSEE OR
 SIGNIFICANT VENDOR OR APPLICANT THAT INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINATION  OF
 SUITABILITY  OF  THE  INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE
 PUBLIC INTEREST, THE COMMISSION MAY TAKE ANY NECESSARY ACTION  OTHERWISE
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS ARTICLE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
  (C)  FOR  PURPOSES  OF THIS SECTION, AN "INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR" SHALL
 MEAN ANY RETIREMENT FUND ADMINISTERED BY A PUBLIC AGENCY FOR THE  EXCLU-

  §  4. Severability clause. If any provision of this act or application
 thereof shall for any reason be  adjudged  by  any  court  of  competent
