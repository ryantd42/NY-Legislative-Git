  WHEREAS,  Those who took a stand for human rights and dignity at the
Stonewall Inn in New York City on June 28, 1969, are among the  pioneers
within  this  movement  and  this year marks the 55th Anniversary of the
Stonewall Riots; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Stonewall protestors were subject to police  harassment
and  discrimination  based on sexual orientation and gender identity and
expression; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Stonewall uprising and the LGBTQIA+  movement  included
the  contributions  of  transgender  and gender non-conforming Americans
like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, who brought attention  to  the
continued struggle for the rights of this community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Various  decisive  moments in history were followed by the
creation of LGBTQIA+ rights organizations in every  major  city  in  the
United States within two years of the Stonewall uprising; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Stonewall uprising has been followed by many positive
progressive historic moments; and
 
  WHEREAS, One year after the Stonewall uprising on June 28, 1970, the
first marches for LGBTQIA+ equality took place in  New  York  City,  Los
Angeles, and San Francisco; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  since the Stonewall uprising, Pride Month has
been celebrated with marches and other events being held throughout  New
York State, and throughout the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  Marriage  Equality Bill first passed the New York State
Assembly in 2007; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Marriage Equality Act passed both houses and was signed
into law in New York State on June 24, 2011, making the state the  sixth
in the nation to do so; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  year  2012 marked the first year all 50 states in the
United States had at least one openly LGBTQIA+ elected official; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 26, 2013, New York State  resident  Edith  Windsor,
represented  by  Roberta Kaplan, won her case against the United States;
the Supreme Court ruled that section three of the  Defense  of  Marriage
Act  was unconstitutional and the Federal Government cannot discriminate
against married lesbian and gay couples for the purposes of  determining
Federal benefits and protections; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  On  June  26,  2015,  the  Supreme Court ruled that states
cannot ban same-sex marriage; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 24, 2016, then President Barack Obama announced the

encompasses Christopher Park, the  Stonewall  Inn  and  the  surrounding
streets  and  sidewalks  that  were  the  sites  of  the  1969 Stonewall
uprising; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 15, 2020, the United States Supreme Court  affirmed
that  the  1964  Civil  Rights  Act  protects  LGBTQIA+  Americans  from
discrimination in the workplace after Gerald  Bostock,  the  late  Aimee
Stephens,  and  the  late  Donald Zarda, also a New Yorker, brought suit
against their former employers when they were fired for  identifying  as
either  gay  or  transgender only after their employer was made aware of
their gender or sexual identity despite positive job performance; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January 25, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  signed

in the military; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  February  2,  2021, the United States Senate confirmed

and he is the first openly gay member of a Presidential Administration's
Cabinet  and  is  currently  serving  as  the  highest-ranking  LGBTQIA+
American in the Presidential line of succession; and
 
  WHEREAS, LGBTQIA+ people across this country should remain  vigilant
as  a  wave  of  anti-trans  legislation  has spread across the country,
demonizing and taking rights from our transgender community; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 25th, 2023, Trans Safe Haven legislation was signed
into law, officially designating New York State a safe haven  for  trans
youth,  their  families  and  their health care providers, ensuring that
families from around the nation can come to New York  for  legal  gender
affirming  care  with  protections  against legal repercussions from the
regressive laws in their home states; and
 
  WHEREAS, The month of June reminds us of all the achievements of the
past and highlights the work that remains to be done; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim June 2024, as LGBTQIA+
Pride Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
