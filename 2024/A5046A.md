 AN ACT in relation to directing the commissioner of taxation and finance
  to conduct a study of assessments, fees and tax rates, and  associated
  policies  of the state of New York relating to providers of telecommu-
  nications services
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative findings. The legislature finds that as tele-
 communications technologies continue to evolve, their expansion through-
 out the state has led to  increasing  competition  among  entities  both
 within and without the traditional regulatory approach of the department
 of public service, including but not limited to cable, satellite, wired,
 wireless  and  broadband  service providers.  Specifically, the ongoing
 modernization of the industry's service offerings and  the  delivery  of
 those services, as well as the intersecting spheres of business occupied
 by all entities within the telecommunications industry, necessitate that
 the  department,  in consultation with the department of public service,
 conduct a comprehensive study and analysis of New York's state and local
 tax laws to provide a fair, efficient, and  uniform  method  for  taxing
 communications  providers  and  their  services sold in the state of New
 York. New York's tax law needs to be restructured with regard  to  state
 and  local taxes, as necessary, to account for the impact of federal and
 state legislation, industry regulation, the impact  of  regulatory  fees
 and  assessments on total taxes paid, and the many and diverse providers
 offering functionally  equivalent  communications  services  in  today's
 marketplace.  The  legislature  further  finds  that, to both retain and
 attract business and customers, New York should strive to tax telecommu-
 nications industry providers in a uniform, consistent and nondiscrimina-
 tory manner which results in a neutral tax policy that will free consum-
 ers to choose a provider based on tax-neutral considerations.  To do so,

 the legislature calls on the department of taxation and finance to  make
 recommendations  to  streamline  and simplify the existing system, which
 includes various assessments, fees and rates imposed at  all  levels  of
 government  with an eye to simplifying the compliance process for commu-
 nications providers and lowering the cost of collecting taxes and  fees,
 increasing service availability and competition, spurring new technology
 expansion  into all of New York, and fostering fair, healthy competition
 as broadly as possible.
  § 2. a. The commissioner of taxation and finance, in consultation with
 the department of public service, is hereby authorized and  directed  to
 conduct a study of assessments, fees and tax rates, and associated poli-
 cies of the state of New York, relating to the telecommunications indus-
 try  including, but not limited to the cable, satellite, wired, wireless
 and broadband industries of the state. In  conducting  this  study,  the
 commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  shall examine the fairness and
 equitableness of the current tax and  assessment  structures  and  their
 applicability  to  the several and diverse providers in the telecommuni-
 cations industry and further assure that all end  customers,  regardless
 of  the  entity  from which they purchase their service, bear a fair and
 proportional share of the assessment imposed for such service,  as  such
 commissioner may determine.
  b.  Such study shall include, but not be limited to, an examination of
 the taxation of telecommunications industry entities and  all  providers
 of  communications  services, whether or not regulated by the department
 of public service and a set of recommendations to streamline and simpli-
 fy the existing system with an eye to simplifying the compliance process
 for communications providers, lowering the cost of collecting taxes  and
 fees, increasing service availability, spurring new technology expansion
 into all of New York, and fostering fair, healthy competition as broadly
 as possible.
  c.  Upon completion of the study, but no later than the first of Janu-
 ary, 2024, the commissioner of  taxation  and  finance  shall  submit  a
 report based on the findings of the study to the governor, the temporary
 president of the senate, the speaker of the assembly, the minority lead-
 er  of the senate, the minority leader of the assembly, the chair of the
 senate corporations, authorities  and  commissions  committee,  and  the
 chair  of the assembly corporations, authorities and commissions commit-
 tee which shall include the findings of the study as well as recommenda-
 tions for statutory changes that may be implemented  to  ensure  a  more
 fair  and  proportional  distribution of the assessments, fees and taxes
 imposed on telecommunications industry providers and their  end  custom-
 ers.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
