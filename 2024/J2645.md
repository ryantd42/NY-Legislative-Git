  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2024, as AVM Awareness Month in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
diseases that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2024,  as  AVM
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National AVM Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Brain  Arteriovenous  Malformation  (AVM)  are  abnormal
connections  between  arteries and veins, usually in the brain or spine,
that can be fatal if left undetected; and
 
  WHEREAS, Normally, arteries carry oxygen-rich blood  away  from  the
heart  to  the  body's cells, organs, and tissues and veins return blood
with less oxygen to the lungs and heart, but in an AVM, the  absence  of
capillaries  allows  blood  to  pass  directly  from  arteries to veins,
missing tissue that needs oxygenated blood; and
 
  WHEREAS, In most cases, people with AVMs in the brain or spinal cord
experience few, if any, significant  symptoms,  and  in  some  cases,  a
weakened  blood  vessel  may  burst,  spilling  blood  into  the  brain
(hemorrhage) that can cause stroke and brain damage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Symptoms caused by AVMs can appear at any age, because  the
malformations  tend to result from a slow buildup of neurological damage
over time; they are most often noticed when people are in their  20s  or
older; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  AVM  is very rare and affects less than one percent of
the population, or about  10  per  100,000  people,  with  an  estimated
300,000  Americans  affected  by  this condition, and a detection of 284
prospective AVM patients in New York according to a New York Islands AVM
Study; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  Joe  Niekro  Foundation  (named  after  the  legendary
baseball  player)  has been steadfast in its commitment to aiding in the
research and treatment of brain aneurysms, AVMs and hemorrhagic strokes;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Foundation's goal is to raise awareness about the  risk
factors,  causes  and  treatments  of  these  conditions,  while helping
support the advancement of neurological research; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October 2024, as AVM
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York  and Brain Aneurysm, AVM. Stroke and Brain Trauma Support Groups of
New York State.
