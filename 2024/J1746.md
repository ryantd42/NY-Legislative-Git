  CONGRATULATING  Chief Thomas M. Iacovissi upon the
  occasion  of  his  retirement  after  34  years  of
  dedicated service to the Rome Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and selfless dedication  merit  tribute  and
recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to congratulate Chief
Thomas  M.  Iacovissi upon the occasion of his retirement after 34 years
of dedicated service to the Rome Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than three decades, Chief Thomas M. Iacovissi  has
consistently  demonstrated a level of commitment, dedication, integrity,
and professionalism which  truly  exemplifies  excellence  in  the  fire
service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Thomas  M.  Iacovissi  joined  the Rome Fire Department in
September of 1989, following in the  footsteps  of  his  father,  Joseph
Iacovissi;  he rose through the ranks to Lieutenant, Captain, and Deputy
Chief before being appointed as Chief in  2020,  the  esteemed  position
from which he will officially retire on February 28, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  his  illustrious  career,  Chief  Thomas  M.
Iacovissi put his life on the line in an effort to protect the safety of
others, always working diligently  to  protect  his  community  and  its
residents from fire and other dangers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, In retirement, Chief Thomas M. Iacovissi plans on  spending
more time with his family, especially his cherished grandchildren; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With him throughout have been his wife, Christine, and his
two sons, Dustin and the late Jenner, who have all shown  him  love  and
support and rejoice in his many achievements; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  his  official  acts,  Chief  Thomas  M.  Iacovissi was
governed by a keen sense of duty and always showed  a  unique  grasp  of
human  problems;  during  his  tenure  with the Rome Fire Department, he
truly earned the admiration, esteem and affection of his colleagues; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
 
Chief Thomas M. Iacovissi is such a firefighter; throughout his years of
devoted  service,  he heroically performed, above and beyond the call of
duty, those responsibilities which define the task of  fire  protection;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate  Chief  Thomas  M.  Iacovissi  upon  the  occasion  of  his
retirement  after  34  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the  Rome Fire
Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Chief Thomas M. Iacovissi.
