the  success  of  the  Association; their involvement is, and always has
been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the business and the community it serves; and

acknowledges  the exceptional Kopernik Association for its hard work and
countless contributions, as well as its vibrant role  in  improving  the
quality  of life in its community, fully confident that it will continue
