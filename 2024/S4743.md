 Introduced  by  Sen.  WEBB  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing  a  Black
  Leadership Institute within the State University of New York
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative  intent.  The  State  University  of  New  York
 ("SUNY")  has committed to becoming the most inclusive university system
 in the country, where all students, faculty, and staff feel welcome  and
 supported.  To  meet this goal, SUNY must employ, in addition to faculty
 and staff, leaders at the highest levels who  share  common  experiences
 and  culture  with those who comprise the fastest-growing segment of its
 student population: diverse students who will become the  nation's  next
 generation of leaders.
  SUNY  has  seen  a  steady increase of Black students in recent years,
 reaching nearly 11 percent, or over 42,000 students,  in  the  2019-2020
 academic  year.  While  SUNY continues its efforts to ensure that campus
 leadership and faculty reflect the students they serve by hiring faculty
 who are more representative of the diverse student  population  at  SUNY
 campuses,  the  diversity  within  executive  leadership  teams  on many
 campuses can be expanded further with support from the legislature.
  It is, therefore, the intention of the legislature to create  a  Black
 Leadership  Institute ("the Institute") as an initiative for Black lead-
 ers in higher education with a mission to retain and  grow  from  within
 SUNY  a  greater proportion of Black professionals at SUNY campuses. The
 Institute shall offer support and foster  professional  development  for
 candidates  for senior leadership roles on SUNY campuses, which will, in
 turn, create a more diverse SUNY culture that represents New York  state
 and the SUNY student population.
  The  legislature  further intends that the Institute would be designed
 to open doors to executive-level positions and strengthen the  Universi-

 ty's  pool  of  Black leaders. The Institute will identify, develop, and
 recruit, and ultimately support, retain, and foster the success of Black
 leaders across the SUNY system.
  §  2. The education law is amended by adding a new section 362 to read
 as follows:
  § 362. BLACK LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE. 1.  SUBJECT TO AN APPROPRIATION FOR
 THIS PURPOSE, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY  OF  NEW  YORK,  IN
 CONSULTATION  WITH  THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW
 YORK, SHALL CREATE A BLACK LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE WITHIN THE STATE UNIVER-
 SITY OF NEW YORK TO FOSTER THE SUCCESS OF BLACK LEADERS AT THE UNIVERSI-
 TY PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT'S CABINET LEVEL. SUCH INSTITUTE SHALL DEVELOP
 CANDIDATE  IDENTIFICATION  AND  RECRUITMENT  EFFORTS,  SEARCH  COMMITTEE
 TRAINING,  PROFESSIONAL  DEVELOPMENT AND INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT MEASURES
 FOR  INSTITUTE  PARTICIPANTS,  PROFESSIONAL  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAMMING,
 SERVICES, RESEARCH AND RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION ACTIVITIES, AND ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS DEEMED NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS INSTITUTE.
  2.  THE  CHANCELLOR  SHALL  APPOINT AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND AN EIGHT
 MEMBER ADVISORY COUNCIL, TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND ADVICE TO  FURTHER  THE
 DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF THE INSTITUTE. THE DIRECTOR AND THE MEMBERS OF
 THE ADVISORY COUNCIL SHALL SERVE FOR THREE-YEAR TERMS, WITH THE DIRECTOR
 AND  THREE  ADVISORY  COUNCIL MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE
 INSTITUTE'S EXISTENCE, THREE OTHER MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE SECOND YEAR,
 AND TWO MEMBERS APPOINTED IN THE THIRD YEAR. THE DIRECTOR  AND  ADVISORY
 COUNCIL MEMBERS MAY BE REAPPOINTED AT THE END OF EACH TERM IN THE MANNER
 OF  THE  ORIGINAL  APPOINTMENT.  THE DIRECTOR AND ADVISORY COUNCIL SHALL
 RECEIVE NO COMPENSATION FOR THEIR WORK IN CONJUNCTION  WITH  THE  INSTI-
 TUTE.
  3.  IN  CONSIDERING  MEASURES  AND  PROGRAMMING  FOR  EFFECTUATING THE
 PURPOSE OF THE INSTITUTE, THE INSTITUTE SHALL CONSIDER SUCH  FACTORS  AS
 PROGRAM  COST-EFFECTIVENESS;  THE  ABILITY  OF  SUCH  PROGRAMS  TO OFFER
 PROGRAMMATICALLY APPROPRIATE, LONG-TERM, TRAINING, AND SUPPORT SERVICES;
 THE ABILITY OF SUCH PROGRAMS TO ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
 INSTITUTE TO RECEIVE REWARDING TRAINING,  SERVICES,  AND  SUPPORTS;  AND
 CURRENT  AND  PROJECTED  EMPLOYMENT  DATA  AT  CAMPUSES WITHIN THE STATE
 UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.
  4. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHALL PREPARE AND PRESENT TO  THE  GOVERNOR,
 THE  SPEAKER  OF  THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE AT
 THE BEGINNING OF EACH REGULAR SESSION  OF  THE  LEGISLATURE  A  SEPARATE
 REPORT  COVERING,  IN  SUMMARY, AND IN DETAIL, ALL PHASES OF ACTIVITY OF
 THE INSTITUTE FOR THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the first of April next  succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law.
