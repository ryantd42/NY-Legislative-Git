 AN ACT to amend the insurance law, in  relation  to  clarifying  certain
  provisions  related to excess use or wear and tear of a vehicle leased
  for personal use for purposes of service contracts

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subsection  (k)  of section 7902 of the insurance law, as
 separately amended by chapter 247 of the laws of 2019 and section  1  of
 subpart  Q  of  part XX of chapter 55 of the laws of 2020, is amended to
 read as follows:
  (k) "Service contract" means a contract or agreement, for  a  separate
 or  additional  consideration,  for  a  specific duration to perform the
 repair, replacement or maintenance of property, or  indemnification  for

 workmanship or wear and tear, with or without additional  provision  for
 indemnity  payments  for incidental damages, provided any such indemnity
 payment per incident shall not exceed the purchase price of the property
 serviced.  Service contracts may include towing,  rental  and  emergency
 road  service, and may also provide for the repair, replacement or main-
 tenance of property for damage resulting from  power  surges  and  acci-
 dental  damage  from  handling.  Service  contracts  may  also  include
 contracts to repair, replace  or  maintain  residential  appliances  and
 systems.  Such  term shall also mean a contract or agreement made (1) by
 or for the manufacturer or seller of a motor vehicle tire for repair  or
 replacement  of the tire or wheel as the result of damage arising from a
 road hazard, (2) by or for the supplier  or  seller  of  a  service  for
 repair of chips or cracks in a motor vehicle windshield, but not includ-
 ing  services that involve the replacement of the entire windshield, (3)

 er  of a service for repair or replacement of a motor vehicle key or key
 fob in the event that the key or key fob  becomes  inoperable,  lost  or
 stolen.  In  conjunction  with  a motor vehicle leased for personal use,
 such term shall also mean a contract to perform the repair,  replacement
 or  maintenance  of  property, or to provide indemnification for repair,
 replacement or maintenance, due to excess wear and  use  or  damage  for
 ITEMS  SUCH  AS  TIRES,  PAINT CRACKS OR CHIPS, interior stains, rips or
 scratches, EXTERIOR DENTS OR SCRATCHES, WINDSHIELD CRACKS OR  CHIPS,  or
