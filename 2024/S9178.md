 AN ACT authorizing the Hicksville United  Methodist  Church  to  receive
  retroactive real property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Hicksville United Methodist Church, an application  for  exemption  from
 real  property  taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax
 law with respect to all of the 2022 and 2023 general taxes, and  all  of
 2021-2022  and  2022-2023  school  taxes for the parcel conveyed to such
 organization, with such parcel being located at 130 W Old Country  Road,
 in  the  village of Hicksville, otherwise known as Nassau county tax map
 section 11, block 290, lots 201 and 202. If  accepted,  the  application
 shall  be  reviewed  as if it had been received on or before the taxable
 status dates established for such rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such organization had acquired the subject property
 and filed an application for exemption by the appropriate taxable status
 date, the assessor, upon approval by the Nassau county legislature,  may
 grant  exemption  from  all taxation and make appropriate corrections to
 the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such  organization
 therefore shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the
 governing  body  or  tax department may, in its sole discretion, provide
 for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel any taxes,  fines,  penal-
 ties, interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
