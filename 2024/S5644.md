 another facility within the past two years;

 been  placed on, and if placed on, removed from the department's "do not
 refer list" pursuant to subdivision  fifteen  of  section  four  hundred
 sixty-d  of  this  article; OR (F) WITHIN THE PREVIOUS THREE YEARS, BEEN
 CITED BY THE DEPARTMENT FOR A VIOLATION OF RESIDENTS' RIGHTS REGULATIONS
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION  FOUR  HUNDRED  SIXTY-ONE-D  OF
 THIS  ARTICLE.  Provided,  however,  that  in the case of an operator or
 affiliate that is not in good standing as provided  in  this  paragraph,
 the  department  may permit the operator or affiliate to use the stream-
 lined application process, in its discretion, if it determines that  the
 disqualifying  violation  was  an  isolated occurrence that was promptly
 corrected by the operator or affiliate.

 services  law, as amended by chapter 591 of the laws of 1999, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (a) The department shall not approve an application for  establishment
 of  an adult care facility unless it is satisfied insofar as applicable,
 as to (i) the character, competence and standing in  the  community,  of
 the applicant; provided, however, with respect to any such applicant who
 is already or within the past ten years has been an incorporator, direc-
 tor,  sponsor,  stockholder, operator, administrator, member or owner of
 any adult care facility which has been issued an  operating  certificate
 by  the  board or the department, or of a halfway house, hostel or other
 residential facility or of a program or facility licensed or operated by
 a health, mental hygiene, social services or education agency or depart-
 ment of this or any state, or a  program  serving  persons  with  mental
 disabilities,  or other persons with disabilities as defined in subdivi-
 sion twenty-one of section two hundred ninety-two of the executive  law,
 the  aged,  children  or other persons receiving health, mental hygiene,
 residential, social or educational services, no approval of such  appli-
 cation  shall  be granted unless the department shall affirmatively find
 by substantial evidence as to each such applicant that  a  substantially
 consistent  high  level  of  care is being or was being rendered in each
 such facility or institution with which such person  is  or  was  affil-
 iated; for the purposes of this paragraph, there may be a finding that a
 substantially  consistent  high  level  of  care has been rendered where
 there have been violations of applicable rules and regulations, that (1)
 did not threaten to directly affect the health, safety or welfare of any
 patient or resident, [and] (2) DID NOT VIOLATE RIGHTS OF A  RESIDENT  OF
 THE  FACILITY,  AND  (3) were promptly corrected and not recurrent; (ii)
 the financial resources of the proposed  facility  and  its  sources  of
 future revenue; and (iii) such other matters as it shall deem pertinent,

 CATIONS  FOR  ADULT  HOMES, ENRICHED HOUSING PROGRAMS, OR RESIDENCES FOR
 ADULTS, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL POST ON ITS WEBPAGE, AND WITH NOTICE TO THE
 LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM, AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, AND
 SHALL ACCEPT COMMENTS BY ELECTRONIC OR REGULAR MAIL.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition,  amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation  of  this act on its effective date are authorized to be made and
