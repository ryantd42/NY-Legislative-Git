 Introduced  by  Sen.  RAMOS  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Budget and Revenue
 
 AN ACT to amend the tax law,  in  relation  to  establishing  the  early
  learning  child  care act; to amend the state finance law, in relation
  to establishing the early learning child care fund; and to  amend  the
  social  services  law,  in relation to establishing the early learning
  child care program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This  act  shall  be known and may be cited as the "Early
 Learning Child Care Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares that New Yorkers are  struggling  to  find  quality  affordable
 child  care where the federal government and New York state have ignored
 their duty to provide children, particularly infants,  with  affordable,
 safe and proper care.
  The  legislature hereby finds and declares that recent studies suggest
 that working parents earning the median household wage must spend nearly
 31% of their income to afford center-based child care. Child care in New
 York city has an  average  annual  cost  for  infants  and  toddlers  in
 center-based child care of nearly nineteen thousand dollars, while home-
 based child care can cost over ten thousand dollars annually.
  The  legislature  hereby  finds and declares that currently child care
 agencies cannot afford to pay their workforce because of low  reimburse-
 ment  rates that have left the industry understaffed, with high employee
 turnover and employees living in poverty.
  Therefore, the legislature hereby finds and declares that the  govern-
 ment has an obligation to curb child care costs for families and provide
 a  proper education and environment to children under five years of age,
 while investing in the human infrastructure to make sure  providers  and
 educators are properly compensated and trained.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
