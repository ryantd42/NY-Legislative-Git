BY: Senator COONEY
 
  HONORING  the  life  and  legacy  Belen  Colon,  a
  champion of civil, voting, and human rights,  and  a
  tireless advocate for the voiceless
 
  WHEREAS,  Belen  Colon  was  born  in 1938 in Cayey, a valley in the
central mountain range of the Island of Puerto Rico; her undying passion
for democracy kicked in  shortly  after  Congress  granted  Puerto  Rico
self-governing status in 1948; and
 
  WHEREAS,  At  just  ten  years  old,  Belen  Colon  joined the Youth
Political Party, a subsidiary of  the  larger  organization  called  the
Popular  Party,  "Partido  POPULAR"  (PPD);  she  recruited  nearly  100
students in her Get Out to Vote (GOTV) efforts;  her  movement  was  the
first  of  its  kind  and  subsequently,  Puerto  Rico elected its first
Governor, PPD candidate, Luis Munoz Marin; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1963, shortly after  her  mother's  death,  Belen  Colon
moved  to  Manhattan, New York to join her sister; during this time, she
reconnected with Don Gabriel Vazquez, a family friend from her  hometown
of  Cayey in Puerto Rico; she married Gabriel and together they moved to
Rochester, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon settling in Rochester, Belen Colon immediately noticed
a disparity in education,  housing,  employment,  medical  and  language
access and began to organize the Latino movement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lovingly  referred  to  as  "The  Mayor  of  North Clinton
Avenue," Belen Colon established block  clubs  and  began  working  with
local  civil  rights activists including Father Laurence Tracy, Minister
Franklin Florence, and Reverend Lewis Stewart among others  locally,  to
help address issues impacting Latino and black communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, When Dona Belen Colon's application to register to vote was
denied  in  1965,  she  tirelessly fought alongside national heroes like
John Lewis to pass The Voting Rights Act of 1965 which did not allow for
the discrimination against any American regardless  of  their  language,
color, religion, or gender; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Belen  Colon  made it her priority and mission to register
and educate as many Latino and African American citizens in the City  of
Rochester;  for  more than 50 years, she walked door to door registering
residents and mobilizing the community to address inequities, giving a
 
  voice to voters on issues important to their futures; and
 
  WHEREAS, Belen Colon was instrumental  in  pushing  local  utilities
companies  such  as  Rochester  Gas and Electric and Rochester Telephone
Company, as well as property managers and banks, to have all  literature
translated  to Spanish; she also worked with New York State to establish
the same priority on language access materials in Spanish,  particularly
the Lemon Law and consumer laws impacting Latinos in the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Understanding  the  importance  of  education  for  future
generations, Belen Colon became active with the  Rochester  City  School
District  (RCSD); she helped author the "Aurora Report," a legal binding
report that ensured Bilingual Education in  the  Rochester  City  School
District and worked to make certain it remained intact and fully funded;
she  also  went  on to work for the Rochester City School District as an
instructional paraprofessional and assistant librarian,  retiring  after
30 years of dedicated service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Passionate about literacy, Belen Colon went on to start the
North  Clinton  Avenue Book Club and gifted over 100 books to inner city
children; she was instrumental in the naming of  Rochester  City  School
District  No.  8,  to  be  named after her good friend, Baseball Hall of
Famer and hero, Roberto Clemente; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  steadfast  and  unwavering  commitment  to  her
community,  Belen  Colon  was  an  active  member  of  Adelante  Title I
Committee, the first RCSD bilingual education committee, as well as  the
Bilingual  Education Committee, the Special Education Taskforce, and the
Superintendents Parent Committee; she also often organized parent  trips
to  Albany  to advocate on behalf of the Rochester City School District;
and
 
  WHEREAS, A strong woman of indomitable faith and  dedication,  Belen
Colon's  final  project  was  the  establishment  of  "Friends  of  St.
Michaels," a nonprofit organization dedicated to saving the church which
was at the heart of the Latino community in one of New York State's most
impoverished communities; the church represents  hope  for  a  community
abandoned and forgotten, and this extraordinary woman's tireless efforts
successfully saved its doors from permanently closing; and
 
  WHEREAS, On November 12, 2022, Belen Colon passed away at the age of
84;  she  is  survived  by her children, Gabriel (Rachel) Vazquez, Mateo
(Bonnie)  Vazquez,  Mercedes  Vazquez-Simmons,  Borgen  Vargas,  Norma
Diamond,  Abigail  Gonzalez,  Rosin  Rivera,  and  Devon  Vazquez;  11
grandchildren; and 11  great-grandchildren;  as  well  as  many  nieces,
nephews, and friends; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Belen  Colon's  infinite selflessness and benevolence will
shine on through her family's vivid and happy memories; her insight  and
strength  will  forever serve as a beacon of love, light and hope to the
countless lives she touched; and
 
  WHEREAS, Armed with a humanistic spirit and imbued with a  sense  of
compassion,  Belen  Colon  leaves behind a legacy which will long endure
the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory  to  all  who
were  privileged to have known and loved such an amazing woman; she will
be  deeply  missed  and  truly  merits  the  grateful  tribute  of  this
Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor the life and legacy Belen Colon, a champion of civil, voting,  and
human  rights,  and  a  tireless  advocate  for the voiceless; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of Belen Colon.
