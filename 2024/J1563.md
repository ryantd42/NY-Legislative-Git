  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Muslim History Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to  those  who
foster  ethnic pride and enhance the profile of cultural diversity which
strengthens the fabric of the communities of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as Muslim History Month in
the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of  the  First
International Muslim History Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International  Muslim  History  Month was founded by Nazma
Khan in 2021, to dismantle  Islamophobia  globally;  this  inspirational
woman  also established World Hijab Day (WHD) in recognition of millions
of Muslim women who choose to wear the hijab and live a life of modesty,
and to foster religious tolerance and understanding  by  inviting  women
(non-Hijabi  Muslims/non-Muslims)  to  experience the hijab for one day;
and
 
  WHEREAS, International  Muslim  History  Month  was  established  to
educate  Muslims  of  New York and around the world of authentic Islamic
history, the events, the  personalities,  and  the  contributions  which
changed  society,  in the hope all Muslims can bridge their relationship
with their non-Muslim neighbors through education and understanding; and
 
  WHEREAS, The history of the Muslim faith is full  of  wonder,  built
upon  the shoulders of giants whose courage did not waver at the thought
of being a paradigmatic  threat;  its  past  is  filled  with  dreamers,
believers, men and women of imagination and innovation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Some  notable  contributions  which  have daily impacts on
modern civilization include: Ibn  al-Haitham's  scholarship  established
fundamental  principles  of  optics including the connection between the
optic nerve and the brain in the First Century A.D.; algebra  originated
in  Al-Khwarizmi's Kitab al-Jabr Wal-Mugabala, the Book of Reasoning and
Balancing; Al-Zahrawi's illustrated medical encyclopedia was in wide use
for over 500 years; teaching hospitals as we know them originated in 9th
Century Egypt; Fatima al-Firhi  established  the  first-degree  granting
university  in Fez, now in Morocco; in the 9th Century, Abbas ibn Firnas
was the first human to successfully achieve flight; and coffee was first
brewed in Yemen in the 9th Century; and
 
  WHEREAS, Currently, there are Muslim legislators serving in both the
New York State Assembly and Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS, International Muslim History Month  provides  an  excellent
means  by  which  all  New  Yorkers can learn more about the rich Muslim
heritage, while fostering an appreciation for this ancient culture among
future generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative  Body  is  proud  to  acknowledge  various
cultures of people who add to the overall diversity of our State and, on
this  occasion,  we  take the opportunity to recognize the contributions
made by the Muslim-American community; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2024,  as  Muslim
History Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
