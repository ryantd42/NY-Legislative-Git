BY: Senator GOUNARDES
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 24, 2023, as Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, This resolution arises from a sense of  human  decency  and
respect for the Armenian people and their history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 24, 2023, as  Armenian  Genocide
Remembrance Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923, 1.5 million men,
women,  and  children  of Armenian descent, and hundreds of thousands of
Assyrian and Greek descent, lost their lives at the hands of the Ottoman
Turkish Empire in its attempt to systematically eliminate  the  Armenian
race,  while  hundreds  of  thousands  had become homeless and stateless
refugees; and
 
  WHEREAS, April 24, 1915, is globally observed as the commencement of
the Armenian Genocide because the arrest on  that  day,  and  subsequent
execution,  of  several hundred Armenian leaders alerted the world about
the Ottoman Turks' genocidal plan; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite  Armenians'  historic  presence,  stewardship,  and
autonomy  in  the region, Turkish rulers of the Ottoman Empire subjected
Armenians to severe  and  unjust  persecution  and  brutality  including
widespread  and wholesale massacres beginning in the 1890s, most notably
the Hamidian Massacres from 1894 to 1896,  and  the  Adana  Massacre  of
1909; and
 
  WHEREAS, By 1923, these crimes against humanity not only resulted in
the  killing  of  unprecedented numbers of innocent people, but also had
the consequence of permanently removing all traces of the Armenians  and
other  targeted peoples from their historic homelands of more than three
millennia, and enriching the  perpetrators  with  the  lands  and  other
property  of  the  victims  of these crimes, including the usurpation of
several thousand churches; and
 
  WHEREAS, By consistently remembering and forcefully  condemning  the
atrocities  committed  against the Armenians, and honoring the survivors
as well as other victims of similar heinous conduct,  we  guard  against
repetition of such acts of genocide and provide the American public with
a greater understanding of history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  resolution  declares  that  this  Legislative  Body
deplores the persistent, ongoing efforts by any person, in this  country
or abroad, to deny the historical fact of the Armenian Genocide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  failure  of  the  international  community  to  hold
responsible nations accountable for crimes against humanity  results  in
travesty of justice, and sets a negative precedent; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States  is  on  record  as  having officially
acknowledged the Armenian Genocide with House Resolution 26  on  October
29, 2019, unanimously confirmed by the Senate with Senate Resolution 150
on  December  12,  2019,  and  then formally recognized by President Joe
Biden on April 24, 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Even  prior  to  the  Convention  on  the  Prevention  and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the United States has a  record  of
having  sought  to justly and constructively address the consequences of
the Ottoman Empire's intentional destruction  of  the  Armenian  people,
including through Senate Concurrent Resolution 12 adopted on February 9,
1916,  Senate  Resolution  359  adopted  on  May 11, 1920, and President
Woodrow Wilson's November 22, 1920,  decision  entitled,  "The  Frontier
between Armenia and Turkey"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  generous philanthropy of the American people directly
resulted in the salvation of the Armenian and Assyrian refugee's  nation
from  being  annihilated by the genocide by saving more than one million
refugees, including more than 130,000 orphans through their humanitarian
assistance; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York is home to a vibrant  Armenian-American  community
who have enriched our State through their leadership and contribution in
business, agriculture, academia, government, and the arts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York's  more than 25,000 Armenian-Americans and their
ancestors have  made  numerous  contributions  to  our  State's  vibrant
history  and  culture, including the establishment of the Syrian Quarter
in Lower Manhattan and "Little Armenia" in  Murray  Hill,  the  Armenian
General  Benevolent  Union,  Armenia's  Permanent  Mission to the United
Nations, the Diocese and Prelacy of the Armenian  Church,  the  Armenian
Center  of  Columbia  University, the Armenian Students Association, the
Armenian Youth Federation, the literary  magazine  Ararat,  the  seminal
musical  group Friends of Armenian Music, the Anthropology Museum of the
People of New York at Queens College, and countless  acclaimed  eateries
across the State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The State of New York endeavors to encourage and promote a
curriculum relating to human rights and genocide  in  order  to  empower
future generations to prevent the recurrence of genocide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  April  24, 2023, will mark the 108th Anniversary since the
commencement of the Armenian Genocide; and
 
  WHEREAS, Armenians in New York, and throughout the world,  have  not
been  provided  with  justice  for  the  crimes  perpetrated against the
Armenian nation even though a century has passed since the  crimes  were
first committed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of the Armenian community honor the memory of the
victims of this genocide and emphasize that crimes against humanity must
be condemned and never be allowed; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  24,  2023, as
Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day in the State of New York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
