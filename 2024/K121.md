years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Susan  B.  Anthony  attended  the  National  Convention of

speeches  promoting  women's  suffrage  and risking arrest for doing so,
effectively organizing thousands of women across the country to  promote
this honorable cause; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1872, Susan B. Anthony was arrested outside of her home
in Rochester, New York, for voting  in  the  Presidential  Election  and

  WHEREAS, Susan B.  Anthony  served  as  President  of  the  National

  WHEREAS, In 1920, the women's suffrage amendment was ratified by the

vote; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1921, Susan B. Anthony was posthumously recognized  with
a  marble  statue  in  her  honor  in  the United States Capitol for her
lifetime of service and advocacy in support of women; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1966, Susan B. Anthony's home in  Rochester,  New  York,

national attraction for hundreds of thousands of Americans who  wish  to
 
learn  more  about  the legacy of this visionary and courageous American
Civil Rights leader; and

to express its highest admiration for Susan B. Anthony, a  lifelong  New
Yorker  and  champion  for equality who fought tirelessly to ensure that
our nation could continue to live up to its most sacrosanct  principles,
and ensuring that no American be denied of their constitutional right to
self-governance on the basis of their sex; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
