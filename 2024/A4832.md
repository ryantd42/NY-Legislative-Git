 Introduced  by  M. of A. RAMOS, DICKENS, STERN -- read once and referred
  to the Committee on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the penal law, in  relation  to  enacting  the  criminal
  street gang related crimes act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "criminal street gang related crimes act".
  §  2.  The penal law is amended by adding a new article 482 to read as
 follows:
  ARTICLE 482
  CRIMINAL STREET GANG RELATED CRIMES
 SECTION 482.00 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  482.05 DEFINITIONS.
  482.10 CRIMINAL STREET GANG RELATED CRIME.
  482.15 SENTENCING.
 § 482.00 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DETERMINES AS FOLLOWS:  GANG  RELATED  CRIME
 HAS  CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. IT IS NO LONGER UNCOMMON
 FOR GANGS TO SOLICIT YOUNGSTERS IN THE ELEMENTARY  SCHOOLS  TO  JOIN  IN
 THEIR  CRIMINAL  ACTIVITY. TOUGHER, NEW LAWS ARE REQUIRED TO BREAK THESE
 GANGS. IT IS TIME TO START GOING AFTER GANGS AS WE  DID  WITH  ORGANIZED
 CRIME.
  THIS  ARTICLE  INCREASES PENALTIES FOR VARIOUS VIOLENT CRIMES THAT ARE
 PERPETRATED IN THE FURTHERANCE OF GANG ACTIVITY. THE CONCEPT IS  SIMILAR
 TO  THE  LAW  THE  STATE  ENACTED TO DEAL WITH BIAS RELATED CRIMES.  THE
 PENALTY IS NOT ONLY GIVEN FOR THE UNDERLYING ASSAULT, BUT ALSO  FOR  THE
 FACT THAT IT WAS BIAS RELATED. IN THIS CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, AN E FELONY IS
 RAISED TO A D FELONY WHERE THE VIOLENT CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE FURTH-
 ERANCE  OF GANG ACTIVITY. THIS ARTICLE MIRRORS LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
