 may retire without reduction of [his or her]  SUCH  MEMBER'S  retirement
 benefit  upon  attainment  of  at  least  fifty-five  years  of  age and
 completion of thirty or more years of service, provided, however, that a
 uniformed court officer or peace officer employed by the  unified  court
 system  who  first  becomes  a  member  of  the New York state and local
 employees' retirement system on or after January first, two thousand ten
 and retires without reduction of [his or her] SUCH  MEMBER'S  retirement

  a.  The  service  retirement  benefit  at  normal retirement age for a
 member with less than twenty years of credited  service,  or  less  than
 twenty-five  years  credited service for a member who joins the New York

 sand ten, shall be a retirement allowance equal to one-sixtieth of final
 average  salary  times  years of credited service. Normal retirement age
 for members who first become members of a public  retirement  system  of
 the  state  on  or  after  April first, two thousand twelve shall be age
 sixty-three; EXCEPT THAT THE NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE  SHALL  BE  SIXTY-TWO
 FOR  A MEMBER WHO IS A PEACE OFFICER OR UNIFORMED COURT OFFICER EMPLOYED

 S. 8788  3
 
 average salary for each year of service in excess of twenty times  final
 average  salary  times  years of credited service. In no event shall any
 retirement benefit payable without optional modification  be  less  than
 the  actuarially  equivalent  annuitized  value of the member's contrib-
 utions accumulated with interest at five percent  per  annum  compounded
 annually to the date of retirement.
  § 4. Paragraph 3 of subdivision i of section 603 of the retirement and
 social  security  law,  as  added  by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, is
 amended to read as follows:
  3. A member of a public retirement system of the state who has met the
 minimum service requirement, but who is not  a  New  York  city  transit
 authority  member,  as  defined  in  paragraph  one  of subdivision a of
 section six hundred four-b of this article, may retire prior  to  normal
 retirement  age,  but  no  earlier than attainment of age fifty-five, in
 which event, the amount of [his or her] SUCH MEMBER'S retirement benefit
 computed without optional modification shall be reduced by six and  one-
 half  per  centum  for  each year by which early retirement precedes age
 sixty-three; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT FOR A MEMBER  WHO  IS  A  UNIFORMED
 COURT OFFICER OR PEACE OFFICER EMPLOYED BY THE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM, THE
 RETIREMENT  BENEFIT  COMPUTED  WITHOUT  OPTIONAL  MODIFICATION  SHALL BE
 REDUCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH ONE OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to the appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  § 6. This act shall take effect immediately; provided that the  amend-
 ments to subdivision a of section 603 of the retirement and social secu-
 rity law made by section two of this act shall not affect the expiration
 of such subdivision and shall be deemed to expire therewith.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow any Tier 6 member who is a uniformed court offi-
 cer  or  peace  officer  employed  by the unified court system to retire
 without early age  reduction  upon  attaining  30  years  of  creditable
 service  and age 55. It would also reduce the normal retirement age from
 63 to 62 and lessen the reductions in  benefits  for  those  who  retire
 prior to normal retirement age.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), the increased costs would be borne entirely
 by the State of New York. If this bill  were  enacted  during  the  2024
 Legislative Session, the increase in the present value of benefits would
 be approximately $34.2 million.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a  past  service  cost  to cover retrospective benefit increases and (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1) To fund retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New  York  will  be
 required to pay $18.9 million as of March 1, 2025.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of the
 State  of New York will include a separate itemized charge equal to 1.0%
 of billable salary reported to the NYSLERS for the affected members,  or
 approximately  $2.2  million  beginning  in fiscal year ending March 31,
 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST WILL INCREASE as Tier  6  salary  grows
 and  will  vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate.
  These estimated costs are based on 2,207 affected members employed  by
 New  York  State, with annual salary of approximately $166 million as of
 March 31, 2023.
