 Introduced  by  M. of A. COOK -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to  establishing
  an  alternative  resolution  program  for service members and veterans
  accused of certain felonies
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Title I of the criminal procedure law is amended by adding
 a new article 217 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 217
  JUSTICE FOR OUR VETERANS ACT
 SECTION 217.00 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.
  217.05 DEFINITIONS.
  217.10 ALTERNATIVE RESOLUTION PROGRAM; COURT PROCEDURES.
 § 217.00 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.
  THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT AN INCREASING  NUMBER  OF  NEW  YORK  STATE
 VETERANS  AND  SERVICE MEMBERS SUFFER FROM SERIOUS TRAUMA AS A RESULT OF
 THEIR MILITARY SERVICE, SUCH AS POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, TRAUMAT-
 IC BRAIN INJURY AND OTHER MENTAL OR PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS  OR  ILLNESSES.
 STUDIES  HAVE FOUND THAT MANY ARE NOT RECEIVING TREATMENT. THE DEVASTAT-
 ING CONSEQUENCES OF WAR ARE HARMING THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF  A
 GROWING  NUMBER  OF  SERVICE MEMBERS, RETURNING VETERANS AND THEIR FAMI-
 LIES.
  A NATIONAL STUDY, INVISIBLE WOUNDS OF WAR, BY RAND CORPORATION IN 2008
 FOUND ONE IN FIVE VETERANS RETURNING FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN  REPORTED
 SYMPTOMS  OF  PTSD  OR  MAJOR DEPRESSION. RESEARCHERS ALSO FOUND SERIOUS
 TREATMENT GAPS WITH ONLY 53% OF VETERANS WITH SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL  HEALTH
 CONDITIONS  SEEKING  HELP,  AND  OF  THOSE WHO SOUGHT CARE, ROUGHLY HALF
 RECEIVED MINIMALLY ADEQUATE  TREATMENT.  IN  NEW  YORK  STATE,  A  NEEDS
 ASSESSMENT OF NEW YORK STATE VETERANS 2011 STUDY BY RAND CORPORATION AND
 THE  NEW YORK STATE HEALTH FOUNDATION FOUND AN ESTIMATED 85,000 VETERANS
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 6169  2
 
 RETURNING HOME SINCE 2001 HAVE AN UNUSUALLY HIGH RATE OF  MENTAL  HEALTH
 PROBLEMS.  THIS STUDY FOUND NEARLY ONE IN FOUR NEW YORK STATE VETERANS
 HAD A PROBABLE DIAGNOSIS OF PTSD AND/OR MAJOR DEPRESSION.  A  FOLLOW  UP
 2011  REPORT BY THE IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN VETERANS OF AMERICA, NEW YORK'S
 NEWEST VETERANS: KEY FINDINGS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE RAND CORPO-
 RATION'S NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF NEW YORK STATE VETERANS RECOMMENDED A POLI-
 CY "TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE AN ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING PROGRAM FOR VETER-
 ANS WHOSE CRIMES STEM FROM SERVICE-RELATED INJURIES."
  THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED AND SACRIFICED FOR OUR COUNTRY FREQUENTLY
 COME HOME TO A NEW FRONTLINE  OF  INDIFFERENCE  WHEN  SUFFERING  FROM  A
 MENTAL OR PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR INJURY. UNTREATED VETERANS WHO THEN COMMIT
 A  CRIME ARE LOST IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.  THERE IS NO STATEWIDE
 MECHANISM TO IDENTIFY VETERANS, AND MANY ARE SENTENCED BY COURTS UNAWARE
 OF THEIR STATUS, LET ALONE IF THEY HAVE AN UNTREATED MENTAL OR  PHYSICAL
 HEALTH  CONDITION  THAT CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR CRIMINAL ACT. THE
 MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON  THE  LINE  FOR  AMERICA'S  FREEDOM
 DESERVE  ANY NEEDED SUPPORT UPON RETURNING HOME. ACCORDINGLY, THE LEGIS-
 LATURE FINDS THAT OUR LAWS MUST  BE  STRENGTHENED  TO  ENSURE  UNTREATED
 SERVICE  MEMBERS  AND  VETERANS WITH MENTAL OR PHYSICAL HEALTH AILMENTS,
 THE MOST VULNERABLE OF OUR RETURNING WARRIORS, RECEIVE TREATMENT AND  AN
 ALTERNATIVE  RESOLUTION  PROCESS  IN  THE  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE
 LEGISLATURE HEREBY  DECLARES  THAT  A  JUST  AND  HUMANITARIAN  CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE  PROCESS IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE VETERANS WITH A MEDICAL EVALUATION
 AND ANY NEEDED TREATMENT FOR A DIAGNOSED INJURY OR  ILLNESS  WHICH  WILL
 ASSIST  THEM  TO  SUCCESSFULLY  RE-ENTER  SOCIETY.  IN  THE INTERESTS OF
 JUSTICE, THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER DECLARES THAT COURTS NEED  TO  CONSIDER
 IF  A  VETERAN'S  SERVICE-RELATED  AILMENT  PLAYED  A ROLE IN HIS OR HER
 OFFENSE, AND WHETHER CHARGES SHOULD BE REDUCED  OR  DISMISSED  UPON  THE
 CONCLUSION OF THE VETERAN'S TREATMENT.
