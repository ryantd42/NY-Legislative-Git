  COMMENDING Broome County Office for Aging upon the
  occasion of celebrating its 50th Anniversary
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Broome County Office for Aging upon the occasion of  celebrating
its 50th Anniversary; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of  older generations have helped build and shape
our Nation to be the greatest in  the  world;  they  have  defended  our
freedoms  and  values  to ensure that those who come after them may have
better lives; nowhere in the Nation is the legacy of their efforts  more
visible  and  more  a part of the lives of all citizens than here in the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Older Americans Act (OAA) was passed in 1965 as part of
President  Johnson's  "Great  Society"  initiative  with  the  goal  of
supporting  older  Americans  to  live at home and in the community with
dignity and independence for as long as possible; and
 
  WHEREAS, Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) were  established  under  the
Older  Americans Act (OAA) in 1973; Broome County Office for Aging (OFA)
was established in 1974; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the 1970s, the OFA provided  2,000  information  and
assistance  contacts,  8,300  home-delivered meals, 79,000 senior center
meals, and 15,000 transportation  rides  to  those  individuals  without
options or resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Some  services,  such  as  the Foster Grandparents Program
(FGP), Yesteryears Group Respite, and in-home personal  care,  were  not
provided  then but are available to assist individuals who require these
programs today; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2023,  the  statistics  for  OFA's  provisions  had
drastically  increased;  18,219  information  and  assistance  contacts,
172,140  home-delivered  meals,  52,755  congregate  meals,  and  19,556
transportation rides were furnished for older community members in need;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Amendments to the Older Americans Act in 2006 broadened its
scope  of  the  advancement  of  long-term  care, focusing on empowering
individuals to make informed decisions  about  their  care  through  the
 
development  of  Aging  and  Disability Resource Centers, enabling older
adults  to  live  healthier  lives  through  the  implementation  of
evidence-based disease and disability prevention programs, and assisting
high-risk  older  adults  in  delaying  premature nursing home placement
through consumer-directed services; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Broome County Office for Aging is in  direct
correlation  to  the  efforts  of its members, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proudly  moved to commend the
members of Broome County Office for Aging, past and  present,  who  have
labored so conscientiously to secure and improve the quality of life for
the community it serves; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Broome County Office for Aging upon the occasion of  celebrating
its 50th Anniversary; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Broome County Office for Aging.
