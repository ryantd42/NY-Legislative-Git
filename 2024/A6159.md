 goal, in regard to any contract or any goal, set by an agency or author-
 ity, but such participation may not be counted towards both such  goals.
 Such  an  enterprise's  participation  in  a contract may not be divided

 business enterprise goal.

 ITY TO DESIGNATED MANAGERS WITHIN THE ENTERPRISE SO LONG AS THE MINORITY
 AND/OR  WOMEN  OWNERSHIP  HOLDS THE AUTHORITY TO MANAGE, SUPERVISE, HIRE
 AND FIRE SUCH MANAGERS AND ULTIMATELY CONTROLS THE  LONG-TERM  DECISION-
 MAKING AUTHORITY FOR THE ENTERPRISE;
  §  4. Subdivision 3 of section 314 of the executive law, as amended by
 chapter 96 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  3. Following application for certification pursuant to  this  section,
 the  director  shall  provide  the  applicant with written notice of the
 status of the application, including notice of any outstanding deficien-
 cies, within twenty-one days. Within forty-five days of submission of  a
 final  completed  application,  [the]  SUCH  APPLICANT  SHALL BE GRANTED
 CERTIFICATION AS A MINORITY OR WOMEN-OWNED  BUSINESS  ENTERPRISE  UNLESS
 THE DIRECTOR SEEKS TO DENY SUCH APPLICATION BASED UPON THE PREPONDERANCE
 OF  THE  EVIDENCE  PROVIDED  OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE INITIAL APPLICATION
 PROCESS. THE DIRECTOR SHALL MAKE ALL SUCH EVIDENCE AVAILABLE IN  WRITING
 SETTING  FORTH  THE  REASONS FOR SUCH DENIAL TO THE APPLICANT FOR REVIEW
 AND COMMENT.  SUCH APPLICANT SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR  A  PROVISIONAL  MWBE
 CERTIFICATION  FOR  A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS.  DURING THE PROVISIONAL MWBE
 CERTIFICATION TIME PERIOD, SUCH APPLICANT SHALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CURE
 ANY DEFICIENCIES AS NOTED BY THE DIRECTOR IN THE  ORIGINAL  APPLICATION.
 AFTER  THE  PROVISIONAL  MWBE  CERTIFICATION  PERIOD, THE DIRECTOR SHALL
 GRANT FULL MINORITY OR  WOMEN-OWNED  BUSINESS  ENTERPRISE  CERTIFICATION
 UNLESS  A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE
 APPLICATION PROCESS AND PROVISIONAL  MWBE  CERTIFICATION  PROCESS  SHOWS
 CAUSE NOT TO GRANT SUCH STATUS. THE director shall provide the applicant
 with  written notice of a determination by the office approving or deny-
 ing such certification [and, in the event of a]. ANY DENIAL OF AN APPLI-
 CATION SHALL BE BASED UPON THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED OR
 OBTAINED THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND SUCH denial SHALL INCLUDE a
 statement setting forth the reasons for such  denial.  Upon  a  determi-
 nation  denying  or  revoking certification, the business enterprise for
 which certification has been so denied or revoked  shall,  upon  written
 request  made within thirty days from receipt of notice of such determi-
 nation, be entitled to a hearing before an independent  hearing  officer
 designated  for  such purpose by the director. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW BY
 ANY HEARING OFFICER IN RELATION TO A WRITTEN REQUEST  MADE  PURSUANT  TO
 THIS SECTION SHALL BE A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. In the event that
 a  request for a hearing is not made within such thirty day period, such
 determination shall be deemed to be final. The independent hearing offi-
 cer shall conduct a hearing [and upon] WITHIN SIXTY DAYS FROM RECEIPT OF
 SUCH WRITTEN REQUEST FOR A HEARING AND NO LATER THAN  SIXTY  DAYS  AFTER
 the  conclusion of such hearing, SHALL issue a written recommendation to
 the director to affirm, reverse or  modify  such  determination  of  the
 director  AND  SHALL SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDE A COPY OF THE WRITTEN RECOM-
 MENDATION TO THE MINORITY OR WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. Such writ-
 ten recommendation shall be issued to the parties. The director,  within
 thirty days, by order, must accept, reject or modify such recommendation
 A. 6159  4
 
 of  the  hearing  officer and set forth in writing the reasons therefor.
 The director shall serve a copy of such order and reasons therefor  upon
 the  business enterprise by personal service or by certified mail return
 receipt  requested. The order of the director shall be subject to review
 pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately, provided,  however,  that
 the  amendments  to  sections  310  and 314 of the executive law made by
 sections one, two, three and four of  this  act  shall  not  affect  the
 repeal of such sections and shall be deemed repealed therewith.
