BY: Senator STEC
 
  COMMENDING  Corey  Howe  upon  the occasion of his
  designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Corey Howe upon the occasion of his designation as recipient  of
a  Liberty  Medal,  the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established  by
Resolution  and  is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have merited special
commendation for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf  of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  the evening of September 25, 2023, in St. Huberts, New
York, Corey Howe, a former member of the Marine  Corps,  had  ended  his
usual UPS route from Plattsburgh to Elizabethtown and Keene Valley in an
unusual way, by heroically saving a man's life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With a 25-year long career driving for UPS, Corey Howe was
the first person on the scene as a tanker truck rolled over on its  side
on the stretch of State Route 73 between Round Pond and Chapel Pond; the
overturned tanker blocked both lanes of traffic and spilled an estimated
3,500  gallons  of  asphalt  emulsion  and 35 gallons of diesel onto the
roadway; and
 
  WHEREAS, With  dust  filling  the  air  on  the  scene,  Corey  Howe
immediately became concerned with the condition of the driver; he rushed
to  the  wreck  and  thankfully, was able to sustain the driver, who had
suffered non-life threatening injuries from the crash; and
 
  WHEREAS, When Corey Howe initially approached the scene, the  driver
was  still trapped inside of the cab of the truck and diesel was leaking
around the crash site; before the situation intensified, he made  it  to
the  front of the vehicle and pulled the windshield, then with his knife
he cut the rubber blocking his view of the driver; and
 
  WHEREAS, Knowing a fire could break out any moment from the  spilled
fuel and damaged truck, Corey Howe cut the driver's seatbelt and bearhug
lifted  him  from danger, where a doctor bystander assessed his injuries
in a safe spot down the road; and
 
  WHEREAS, Suddenly, Corey Howe rushed back to his UPS truck  to  grab
the  fire  extinguisher  as  a  fire  broke  out  at  the crash site; he
extinguished the small fire in the cab of the truck and then waited  for
troopers and firefighters to arrive on the scene; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Aside  from  his military training, Corey Howe credits UPS
for properly equipping him to deal with emergencies; he is a  member  of
the  safety  committee at UPS Plattsburgh and helps train new drivers in
safety; and
 
  WHEREAS, Beyond making deliveries,  Corey  Howe  is  a  husband  and
father;  he  has  been married to his wife, Dana, for 25 years and their
21-year-old twins, Evan and Tanner, both also work at UPS; and
 
  WHEREAS, Justly recognized as a hero, Corey Howe richly  merits  the
admiration  of  this  Legislative  Body  and  his  community  for  his
consummate, swift action in saving the life of this driver; and
 
  WHEREAS, Moreover, Corey Howe should be meritoriously commended  for
remaining  calm  under  pressure  and for showing valor and true courage
while performing a lifesaving deed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Corey Howe, in his spontaneous and heroic act, has so aptly
demonstrated his character and compassion for  the  welfare  of  others,
personifying,  by  virtue  of  his  action,  the  collective  concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond without thought of danger or reward when others are in  need  of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Corey Howe upon the occasion of his designation as recipient  of
a  Liberty  Medal,  the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Corey Howe.
