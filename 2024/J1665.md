  COMMENDING  Chris  Hoke  upon  the occasion of her
  designation as Grand Marshal of the 2024  Utica  St.
  Patrick's Day Parade
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to pay tribute to
individuals  of  true  purpose  and  worthy  accomplishment  who  work
diligently to preserve and celebrate their rich cultural heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Chris Hoke upon the occasion of her designation as Grand Marshal
of the 200th Utica St. Patrick's Day Parade on Saturday, March 16, 2024;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The tradition of the Utica  St.  Patrick's  Day  Parade  is
steeped in 200 years of history, with John C. Devereux leading the first
march  down  the Historic Brewery and Arts District of Utica; today, the
Utica Parade draws around 30,000 spectators,  as  about  5,000  marchers
from  across  the  state  step  off from Oneida Square and head north to
Genesee Street; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  committee  for  this  year's  Utica,  New  York,  St.
Patrick's Day Parade designated Chris Hoke as one of the highly esteemed
Grand  Marshals  in  recognition  of  her  devotion  and passion for the
preservation and celebration of Irish culture in her community; and
 
  WHEREAS, A long time contributor to the Irish community, Chris  Hoke
is  a  head of the Irish Cultural Center alongside husband Mike Hoke, in
which  they  create,  attract,  and  schedule  Irish  cultural  events,
lectures,  presentations,  and  performances that promote Irish heritage
and educate the community concerning the impact and contributions of the
Irish people in the greater Utica area and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS, A testament to their resilience  and  ambition,  Chris  and
Mike  Hoke  started  the Irish Cultural Center with an empty room and no
funding and assembled a planning team, raised  funding,  acquired  sound
and  visual  equipment,  and  booked speakers and performers to ensure a
continuous series throughout the year, all while facing the  constraints
imposed by a world-wide pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  putting  together  an  Irish cultural and educational
series that engaged and attracted both presenters and attendees from  as
far  away  as  Ireland,  the  inaugural Matthew T. Sullivan Irish Spirit
Award was given to Chris Hoke in 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chris Hoke has  worked  for  the  Craobh  Dugan  branch  of
Comholtas  Ceoltoiri  Eireann  for almost 45 years; she helped found the
branch in 1978, and  in  2008,  she  was  inducted  into  the  Comhaltas
Ceoltoiri Eireann Northeast Region Hall of Fame; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chris  and  Mike  Hoke  lead  several  trad  sessions  and
performances each month throughout the Utica area, and they also host an
Irish picnic at their home every August; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The two Grand Marshals have also been representatives from
the Craobh Dugan O'Looney branch for the annual North America  Comhaltas
Ceoltoiri  Eireann (CCE) conventions; serving as President and Treasurer
of their local branch, Chris and Mike Hoke have supplied funds from dues
and performances to members to travel to North American CCE meetings, as
well as attend various music and dance workshops; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chris Hoke serves proudly as the Secretary of the Comhaltas
Ceoltoiri Eireann Northeast Regional Board; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Chris Hoke upon the occasion of her designation as Grand Marshal
of the 2024 Utica St. Patrick's Day Parade; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Chris Hoke.
