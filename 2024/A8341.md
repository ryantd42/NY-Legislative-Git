  Section 1. The office of children and family services, in  conjunction
 with  the  inspector  general,  is  authorized and directed to conduct a
 study on the family assessment response program. Such study shall:

  (c) identify areas where the program can be improved;
  (d)  suggest changes to the program to improve areas where the program
 needs improvement;
  (e) specify why certain areas of the program require changes;
  (f) identify if the application  and/or  approval  process  localities
 utilize for approval of family assessment response program plans require
 updates or modifications;
  (g)  determine  if  the  program  is worth expanding across the state,
 making the program either an opt-out or mandatory program;
  (h) examine the potential mandated expansion of the family  assessment
 response  program  in  the state of New York, including, but not limited
 to:
  (i) how has the program worked in localities which have  adopted  such
 family  assessment  response  program  via  application  approved by the
 office of children and family services;

  (ii) the frequency with  which  child  protective  services'  investi-
 gations  are  initiated  into  a familial unit within six months of such
 familial unit completing a family assessment response case; and
  (iii)  the percentage of children alleged to be maltreated in a family
 assessment response case who are later determined to be maltreated in  a
 subsequent child protective services' investigation within six months of
 the closure of such family assessment response case; and
  (i)  study anything else the office of children and family services or
 the inspector general determines necessary to determine  if  the  family
 assessment  response  program  is  working  as  designed,  if  it can be
 improved, and if it is worth expanding and/or mandating state-wide.
  § 2. The office of children and family services, in  conjunction  with
 the inspector general, shall publish a report containing the findings of
 the study. Such report shall be delivered to the governor, the temporary
 president  of  the senate, and the speaker of the assembly no later than
 one year after the effective date of this act.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed two years after such effective date.
