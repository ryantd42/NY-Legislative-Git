 AN  ACT  to  require  the New York state energy research and development
  authority to develop recommendations regarding  the  establishment  of
  microgrids

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  The New York state energy research and development author-
 ity, in consultation with the department of public service and the divi-
 sion of homeland security and emergency services, shall prepare a report
 including recommendations regarding the establishment of microgrids  for
 protection of critical facilities in the state of New York. For purposes
 of  this  act, the term "microgrid" shall mean a group of interconnected
 loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical
 boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the
 grid and can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to  oper-
 ate  in both grid-connected or island-mode.  Specifically, the authority
 shall develop recommendations which include, but are not limited to, the
 following:
  (a) Whether microgrids  should  be  established  at  hospitals,  first
 responder  headquarters,  such  as  police  and fire stations, emergency
 shelters, schools, water filtration plants, sewage treatment plants  and
 other critical facilities in the state of New York;
  (b) The geographic areas in the state of New York where the establish-
 ment  of  microgrids should be a priority, based upon prior severe storm
 damage and the consideration of disadvantaged communities as defined  in
 subdivision  5 of section 75-0101 of the environmental conservation law;
 and
  (c) Available or necessary funding mechanisms for the establishment of
 microgrids.
