 Introduced  by  COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Thiele) --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  the  mandatory  age  of  the members of the town of Southampton police
  department
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision m of section 384-d of the retirement and social
 security  law, as amended by chapter 476 of the laws of 2015, is amended
 to read as follows:
  m. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision  of  law,  if  the  town
 board  of  the  town  of Southampton elects to make the benefits of this
 section available to the members of its police department,  each  member
 of  such  department  shall be separated from service upon completion of
 twenty years of service, provided, however,  that  the  town  board  may
 permit  a  member  to  continue  in service on an annual basis after the
 completion of twenty years of service, but in no event shall such annual
 service be continued after a member has attained age sixty  unless  such
 member  has not attained twenty years of service, EXCEPT HOWEVER, THAT A
 MEMBER OF SUCH DEPARTMENT WHO  HOLDS  THE  RANK  OF  CHIEF  WITHIN  SUCH
 DEPARTMENT MAY BE PERMITTED BY THE TOWN BOARD TO REMAIN IN SERVICE UNTIL
 SUCH MEMBER HAS ATTAINED THE AGE OF SIXTY-FIVE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend subdivision m of Section 384-d of the Retirement
 and  Social  Security Law to allow a police officer employed by the Town
 of Southampton who holds the rank of chief to remain in  active  service
 until  attaining  age  65.  Currently,  such officers must separate from
 service after attaining age 60.
  If this bill is enacted during the  2024  Legislative  Session,  there
 could  be  additional  benefits for certain members who remain in active
 service beyond age 60, which would be  funded  by  the  normal  employer
 contributions.  If  such  members delay separation of service due to the
