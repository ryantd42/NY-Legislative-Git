BY: Senator MANNION
 
  COMMENDING  Aiden  B.  Carter upon the occasion of
  his designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Aiden  B.  Carter  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In September of 2022,  13-year-old  Aiden  Carter  and  his
father  were  driving  along  Route  481  in Oswego, New York, when they
witnessed a single  car  lose  control,  striking  a  bridge,  and  then
spinning  around  and  landing  on  the  shoulder  of  the highway; they
immediately pulled over  and  raced  to  the  vehicle,  whereupon,  they
noticed it was on fire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Aiden  Carter called 911, and then he and his father tried
to find a way to get the driver and other passengers out of the  locked,
burning  car;  along  with  other drivers who stopped to help, Aiden was
finally able to  pull  the  passengers  out,  just  as  the  car  became
completely engulfed in flames and filled with smoke; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Aiden  Carter  checked  on the driver, who was injured and
helped move him to a safer location several times before  the  ambulance
arrived; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A typical 8th grade teenager, Aiden Carter is homeschooled
and actively involved in his church youth group; he also enjoys  playing
the  violin,  learning the German language, and is a goalie for the Port
City Royals soccer team; a game master, he  loves  to  play  Dungeons  &
Dragons with his friends, has started writing his own book series and is
pursuing blacksmithing so he can create the weapons used in those books;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Aiden  Carter  plans  to join the Civil Air Patrol to help
pave the way towards his goal of attending the  Air  Force  Academy  and
becoming a C-17 pilot; and
 
  WHEREAS, Aiden B. Carter, in his spontaneous and heroic acts, has so
aptly  demonstrated  his  character  and  compassion  for the welfare of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
 
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond without thought of danger or reward when others are in  need  of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Aiden  B.  Carter  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient  of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed upon an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Aiden B. Carter.
