  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would create a new service-based retirement plan for members
 of the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System employed as
 a  constable with the Village of Westhampton Dunes. Provided the consta-
 ble has accrued at least ten years of creditable service while  employed
 by  the  Village  of  Westhampton  Dunes,  they would have the option to
 retire upon completion of twenty-five years of creditable service with a
 benefit of one-half of final average  salary  (FAS)  and  an  additional
 benefit  of  one-fiftieth  of FAS for each year of creditable service in
 excess of twenty-five years, limited to five years  of  additional  one-
 fiftieths.  Currently,  these  members  are covered under an age-based
 plan.
  Additionally, for those members covered under the provisions of  Arti-
 cle  14,  this  bill would permit an irrevocable election to forfeit the
 benefits of Article 14 in favor of the 25-year plan benefit  established
 by this legislation. The election must be made on or before December 31,
 2025  or  within  one  year  of entering service as a constable with the
 Village of Westhampton Dunes, whichever comes later.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of  approximately  $25,000  in  the
 annual  contributions of the Village of Westhampton Dunes for the fiscal
 year ending March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary  but  is
 expected to average 4.9% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past service cost of approximately $239,000 which will be
 borne by the Village of Westhampton Dunes as a  one-time  payment.  This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
  These  estimated  costs are based on nine affected members employed by
 the Village of Westhampton Dunes, with annual  salary  of  approximately
 $462,000  as  of  March  31,  2023. The affected members were identified
 using a roster provided by Lisa M. Lombardo from the office of Represen-
 tative Fred W. Thiele, Jr.
