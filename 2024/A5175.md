 whether or not to initiate a child protective proceeding,  and  criteria
 for  the  formulation  of  treatment plans and for the delivery of child
 protective services including specification of the services to be  clas-
 sified as child protective services, which shall also apply to any soci-
 ety  for  the prevention of cruelty to children which has entered into a
 currently valid contract with a local department of social  services  to
 investigate  child  abuse  or maltreatment reports. The department shall
 promulgate regulations establishing minimum standards and practices  for
 the  delivery of child protective services in connection with monitoring
 and supervising respondents and their families as ordered  by  a  family
 court  pursuant  to  section ten hundred thirty-nine and paragraphs (i),
 (iii), (iv) and (v) of subdivision (a) of section ten hundred  fifty-two
 of  the family court act.  THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REQUIRE THAT EVERY CASE-
 WORKER, CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES EMPLOYEE OR ANY PERSON ACTING PURSUANT

 CHILD  DURING SUCH VISIT OR CONTACT USING A TABLET OR COMPARABLE DEVICE.
 SUCH PHOTOGRAPH SHALL BE PART OF THE CONFIDENTIAL CASE RECORD  FOR  SUCH
 CHILD  AND  SHALL BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REVIEW BY THE SUPERVISOR OF THE
 CASE. SUCH PHOTOGRAPH MUST BE OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY TO CLEARLY  IDENTIFY
 THE CHILD, AND CONTAIN ACCURATE DATA WITH REGARD TO THE TIME AND DATE OF
 THE  PHOTOGRAPH.  THE  SUPERVISING  AUTHORITY MAY REQUIRE, TO THE EXTENT
 PRACTICABLE, THAT THE CASEWORKER UTILIZE  TECHNOLOGY  ALLOWING  FOR  THE
 GEOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION OF SAID VISIT.  Such regulations REQUIRED UNDER
 THIS  SUBDIVISION  shall also require local child protective services to
 comply with  notification  requirements  of  the  family  court  act  in
 connection with such monitoring and supervisory responsibilities.
  § 3. Section 372 of the social services law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 4-c to read as follows:
  4-C.  THE RECORDS MAINTAINED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION BY ANY CASEWORK-
 ER, CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES EMPLOYEE OR AUTHORIZED AGENCY  AS  DEFINED
 IN  SECTION THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-ONE OF THIS TITLE WHO HAS CONTACT WITH
 A FOSTER CHILD AS PART OF A TREATMENT PLAN OR SUPERVISION  AND  MONITOR-
 ING,  SHALL  DOCUMENT  EACH  SUCH CONTACT WITH A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN OF THE
 CHILD DURING SUCH VISIT OR CONTACT CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS  SET
 FORTH  IN  SUBDIVISION  THREE OF SECTION FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE OF THIS
 ARTICLE.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
