  HONORING Alexander Zamolodchikov upon the occasion
  of  his  designation  as  recipient  of  the  2024
  Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics
 
  WHEREAS, It is with profound intent that this Legislative Body  pays
just  tribute  to  a man of indomitable dedication whose purposeful life
and accomplishments will forever stand as a paradigm and inspiration for
others; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to  give  acclaim
to  individuals  of  great  character  whose lives exemplify the highest
ideals of humanity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Alexander  Zamolodchikov  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient of the 2024 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics,  to  be
celebrated  at  the 10th Annual Breakthrough Prize ceremony on April 13,
2024, in Los Angeles, California; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Breakthrough Prize honors  an  esteemed  group  of  the
world's  most  brilliant  minds  for  impactful  scientific discoveries,
including  a  subset  responsible  for  substantial  progress  in  the
understanding and treatment of major diseases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Prize, popularly known as the "Oscars of Science," was
created to celebrate the wonders  of  our  scientific  age  by  founding
sponsors Sergey Brin, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, Julia and Yuri
Milner, and Anne Wojcicki; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Stony  Brook  University  Distinguished Professor and C.N.
Yang-Wei Deng Endowed Chair Alexander Zamolodchikov was cited  for  this
most  esteemed  honor  for  his  profound  contributions  to statistical
physics  and  quantum  field  theory,  with  diverse  and  far-reaching
applications in different branches of physics and mathematics; and
 
  WHEREAS, A visionary physicist who has advanced fundamental research
in  physics  throughout  his  incredible career, Alexander Zamolodchikov
truly dedicated his lifetime to  quantum  field  theories;  these  field
theories describe not only particle physics, but emergent phenomena from
magnetism  and  superconducting  materials to the information content of
black holes, and have also become a rich field of study in  mathematics;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the able leadership of Alexander Zamolodchikov, the
C.N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics  and  more  generally  Stony
Brook's  Department  of  Physics  and Astronomy continue to redefine the
current field of theoretical physics, inspiring countless students; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the inaugural C.N. Yang-Wei Deng Endowed Chair in  Stony
Brook's  Department  of  Physics  and  Astronomy,  Professor  Alexander
Zamolodchikov has made an indelible impact not only on  the  institution
but on human's understanding of our shared reality; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Alexander  Zamolodchikov  is  one of the most accomplished
theoretical physicists worldwide; he has made  groundbreaking  advances,
with  enormous  impact  in many physics fields, such as condensed matter
physics, quantum statistical physics and high energy physics,  including
our understanding of fundamental matter and forces; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  his  insights have profoundly influenced the
way theoretical physicists think about foundational concepts,  providing
new  paths  which are being explored at many leading theoretical physics
centers,  including  Stony  Brook;  as  the  first  C.N.  Yang-Wei  Deng
Professor  of  Theoretical  Physics,  he  continues  the  tradition  of
theoretical physics at Stony Brook at the very highest level; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, it is appropriate to  publicly  proclaim  and  commend  those
individuals for the edification and emulation of others; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Alexander Zamolodchikov upon the occasion of  his  designation  as
recipient  of the 2024 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Alexander Zamolodchikov.
