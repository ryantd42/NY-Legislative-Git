  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing amendments to article 6 of the constitution,  in  relation  to
  the number of supreme court justices in any judicial district

  Section  1.  Resolved  (if  the  Senate concur), That subdivision d of
 section 6 of article 6  of  the  constitution  be  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  d.  The  supreme court is continued. It shall consist of the number of
 justices of the supreme court including the justices designated  to  the
 appellate  divisions of the supreme court, judges of the county court of
 the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens and  Richmond  and  judges  of  the
 court of general sessions of the county of New York authorized by law on
 the  thirty-first day of August next after the approval and ratification
 of this amendment by the people, all of whom shall be  justices  of  the
 supreme  court  for  the  remainder  of their terms. The legislature may
 increase the number of justices of the supreme  court  in  any  judicial
 district[, except that the number in any district shall not be increased
 to  exceed one justice for fifty thousand, or fraction over thirty thou-
 sand, of the population thereof as shown by the last federal  census  or
 state  enumeration]. The legislature may decrease the number of justices
 of the supreme court in any judicial district, except that the number in
 any district shall not be less  than  the  number  of  justices  of  the
 supreme court authorized by law on the effective date of this article.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendments be
 referred  to  the  first regular legislative session convening after the
 next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly,  and,  in
 conformity  with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution, be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
