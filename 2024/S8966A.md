  § 3. Subdivision 2 of section 575 of the public health law, as amended
 by section 19 of part A of chapter 59 of the laws of 2011, is amended to

 provisions  of  section five hundred seventy-three of this title, unless
 all fees and outstanding penalties, if any,  have  been  paid,  and  the
 department  finds  that  the clinical laboratory or blood bank is compe-
 tently staffed and properly equipped, and will be operated in the manner
 required by this title.
  § 4. Section 576-a of the public health law, as amended by chapter 436
 of the laws of 1993, is amended to read as follows:
  § 576-a. Clinical laboratories  and  cytotechnologists  examining  Pap
 smears.  1.  Definitions.  As  used  in this section, unless the context
 clearly requires otherwise, the following terms shall have the following
 meanings:
  (a) "Cytotechnologist". A clinical laboratory professional  specializ-
 ing  in the analysis of cytopathology samples, including Pap smears, for
 cervical cancer and related diseases who meets the qualifications speci-
 fied by the department.
  (b) "Cytotechnologist work standard". (i) A limitation on  the  number
 of  Pap  smears  (also  known as gynecologic slides) and non-gynecologic
 slides a cytotechnologist may examine during a particular  time  period,
 or  other  limitation on the quantity, speed or manner of examination of
 slides by a cytotechnologist, under regulations of the department.
  (ii) [Unless otherwise provided by the department,  the  cytotechnolo-
 gist  work  standard shall be: No cytotechnologist may examine more than
 eighty one-slide gynecologic cases or fifty two-slide gynecologic  cases
 per  work  day.  If  a  cytotechnologist also examines non-gynecologic
 slides in a given work day the cytotechnologist's workload  for  gyneco-
 logic  slides shall be correspondingly reduced, in accordance with writ-
 ten guidelines prepared by the clinical laboratory and  filed  with  the
 department,  so that a cytotechnologist examines no more than a total of
 one hundred gynecologic and non-gynecologic slides per  work  day.]  THE
 DEPARTMENT MAY ESTABLISH REGULATIONS FOR CYTOTECHNOLOGIST WORKLOAD STAN-
 DARDS THAT SHALL BE AT LEAST AS STRINGENT AS FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
  (c) "Employ". To employ or contract with a cytotechnologist to examine
 gynecologic slides.
  (d)  "Clinical  laboratory".  A  clinical  laboratory  issued a permit
 pursuant to this title.
  (e) "Work day". A twenty-four hour period during which a cytotechnolo-
 gist examines gynecologic slides for a clinical laboratory.
  2. Compliance with cytotechnologist work standard. No cytotechnologist
 shall exceed the applicable cytotechnologist work standard. No  clinical
 S. 8966  3
 
 laboratory  shall  require, authorize, encourage or permit any cytotech-
 nologist to exceed the applicable  cytotechnologist  work  standard.  In
 determining  whether a cytotechnologist exceeds the applicable cytotech-
 nologist  work  standard, all work done by the cytotechnologist during a
 given work day shall be considered, without  regard  to  which  clinical
 laboratory or other person for which or whom it was performed.
  3.  [Registration  of  cytotechnologist. All cytotechnologists who are
 employed by a clinical laboratory must register with the department. The
 department shall, by regulation, prescribe a form and procedure for  the
 registration  of  cytotechnologists. The registration form shall include
 at least the name, address,  and  an  individual  identification  number
 determined  by  the  department. The department shall notify each regis-
 trant of his or her identification number.
  4. Employment of registered cytotechnologists. No clinical  laboratory
 shall  employ  a  cytotechnologist unless the cytotechnologist is regis-
 tered under this section.
  5.]  Record-keeping.  (a)  Each  clinical  laboratory  shall  maintain
 records,  in  a  form prescribed by the department, which set forth, for
 each cytotechnologist employed by the clinical laboratory:
  (i) the name [and identification number] of the cytotechnologist;
  (ii) the number of hours worked by the cytotechnologist in  each  work
 day;
  (iii)  the  number  of  gynecologic  slides and non-gynecologic slides
 examined by the cytotechnologist[, and how many were one-slide and  two-
 slide cases,] during each work day; and
  (iv)  such  other  information  as the department may require by regu-
 lation.
  (b)  [Each  cytotechnologist  shall  maintain  records,  in  a  form
 prescribed by the department, which set forth:
  (i)  the  number  of hours worked by the cytotechnologist in each work
 day;
  (ii) the number of gynecologic slides and non-gynecologic slides exam-
 ined and how many were one-slide and two-slide cases, during  each  work
 day;
  (iii)  the name and address of the clinical laboratory or other person
 for which or whom the slides were examined; and
  (iv) such other information as the department  may  require  by  regu-
 lation.
  (c)] Such records of clinical laboratories and cytotechnologists shall
 be  made  available  for  inspection  and copying by the department upon
 request.
  [6.] 4. Multiple employers. Whenever a cytotechnologist is employed by
 more than one clinical laboratory or other person during a work day, the
 cytotechnologist shall advise each clinical laboratory of  any  previous
 employment  during  the  work  day  and the amount of work performed, to
 insure  that  the  applicable  cytotechnologist  work  standard  is  not
 exceeded.
  [7.] 5. Standards for gynecologic slides. (a) A gynecologic slide of a
 Pap smear shall not be tested or reported on if:
  (i) the apparent condition of the specimen indicates that it is unsat-
 isfactory  for  testing  or  that  it  is  inappropriate  for  the  test
 requested;
  (ii) it has been collected, labeled, preserved or otherwise handled in
 such a manner that it has become unsatisfactory or unreliable as a  test
 specimen;
  (iii) the slide is broken;
 S. 8966  4
 
  (iv)  it  contains  insufficient  cells  or  the cells are obscured by
 inflammation, blood or lubricating ointment, so that an adequate diagno-
 sis cannot be made; or
  (v)  the  slide  is otherwise unsatisfactory, as defined by department
 regulations.
  (b) If the slide is unsatisfactory as set forth in  this  subdivision,
 the  clinical  laboratory  shall  have an affirmative duty to advise the
 collecting physician or other practitioner that the slide is unsatisfac-
 tory and request the submission of a new slide.
  [8.] 6. Re-examination of slides. The department shall  prescribe,  by
 regulation,  a  system  of targeted re-examination of gynecologic slides
 examined and found to be not abnormal or questionable. The factors to be
 considered in the targeted  re-examination  may  include,  but  are  not
 limited  to,  the  prior  cancer  and  other history of the patient, the
 results of previous slide examinations, and the experience  and  ability
 of  the  cytotechnologist.  Each  clinical  laboratory  shall follow the
 prescribed re-examination system.
  [9. Regulations. The department may, by  regulation,  establish  cyto-
 technologist  work standards. Those standards may include, but shall not
 be limited to, standards which take  into  account  the  experience  and
 qualifications of the cytotechnologists and the performance of the clin-
 ical laboratory in proficiency testing programs conducted by the depart-
 ment.  However,  those  standards  shall  not exceed by more than twenty
 percent the maximum numbers of slides which may be examined  in  a  work
 day  under  clause  (ii)  of  paragraph  (b)  of subdivision one of this
 section. Such standards shall be at least as stringent as federal stand-
 ards promulgated  under  the  federal  clinical  laboratory  improvement
 amendments of nineteen hundred eighty-eight.
  10.]  7.  Notwithstanding any provisions of [subdivisions] SUBDIVISION
 one [and nine] of this section to  the  contrary,  the  department  may,
 pursuant  to regulation, increase the maximum number of slides which may
 be examined in a work day for clinical laboratories using slide examina-
 tion or preparation technology approved by the  federal  food  and  drug
 administration, provided that such standards shall be at least as strin-
 gent as federal standards promulgated under the federal clinical labora-
 tory  improvement  amendments  of nineteen hundred eighty-eight or other
 applicable federal law.
  [11.] 8. Violations. (a) Sections twelve, twelve-a,  and  twelve-b  of
 this  chapter shall apply to violations of this section, except that the
 civil penalty for a violation of  this  section  by  a  cytotechnologist
 shall not exceed five hundred dollars.
  (b)  [If  a cytotechnologist violates this section, the department may
 suspend  or  revoke  the  cytotechnologist's  registration  under  this
 section,  pursuant  to  department regulations including appropriate due
 process protections for the cytotechnologist.
  (c)] If any clinical laboratory or other person violating this section
 is licensed, certified or  registered  by  the  department  under  other
 provisions  of  law,  the  violation  of this section may be grounds for
 disciplining the person under such law.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
