BY: M. of A. Lupardo
 
  CONGRATULATING  Maria  Dibble upon the occasion of
  her retirement after 40 years of devoted service  as
  Executive Director of the Southern Tier Independence
  Center
 
  WHEREAS,  Individuals  and  organizations  devoted  to improving the
quality of life for others, enabling them to build lives of dignity  and
self-worth are deserving of the highest praise and recognition; and
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time, society calls upon these individuals and
organizations  to  be  recognized  for  the  significance  of  their
contributions and efforts to assist  others  in  developing  the  skills
necessary to be successful, productive citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to congratulate Maria
Dibble  upon  the  occasion  of her retirement after 40 years of devoted
service to the Southern Tier Independence Center; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a  steadfast  and  unwavering  commitment  to  serving
individuals with disabilities, Maria Dibble co-founded the Southern Tier
Independence Center (STIC) with Frank Pennisi in 1983; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  able  leadership  of  Maria  Dibble,  STIC, an
Independent Living Center serving children and adults with all types  of
disabilities,  promotes  the independence, integration, and inclusion of
people with disabilities in all  aspects  of  community  life  including
employment,  recreation,  housing,  education,  volunteering,  and civil
responsibilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, STIC also  provides  support,  consultation,  training  and
services  to families, businesses, agencies, and others within the local
community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Completely blind from birth, Maria Dibble  has  experienced
the  discrimination  and  false  assumptions  people make when meeting a
person with a disability, underestimating what  they  can  do,  or  even
completely  dismissing it; nevertheless, she was integrated into regular
schools as a child, and is a graduate of Binghamton University; and
 
  WHEREAS, This extraordinary woman understands the  issues  faced  by
children  and  their  families;  she  vowed as a teen to somehow have an
impact on the lives of people with disabilities, by changing  attitudes,
and working to remove barriers to inclusion and acceptance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  STIC  has  helped  her  to  achieve these goals; since its
inception, this vital organization has grown from a  grant  of  $100,000
and  four  staff,  to  a  budget  of  $17  million and approximately 750
employees,  all  dedicated  to  the  independence  of  people  with
disabilities, and advocating for their civil and economic rights; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Maria  Dibble  was on the front lines in Washington during
the battle for passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); she
took momentum from  the  ADA's  passage  and  used  it  to  advance  key
 
components  of  the  Independent  Living  mission,  including
deinstitutionalization,  supported  employment,  and  Consumer  Directed
Personal Assistance (CDPA); and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  she  was  a  leader  in  the  Association on
Independent Living, and was appointed to the New York State  Independent
Living  Council  (NYSILC)  board of directors and served as chair in the
early 2000s; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2004, after realizing a lack of services for people  who
have both mental health challenges and developmental disabilities, Maria
Dibble  mobilized  the resources of STIC to create the Children's Mental
Health Task  Force  and  address  this  gap  in  services  by  fostering
collaboration among voluntary and government agencies, schools, and care
providers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  her  direction, the task force created action steps
for the near and  long-term  future,  and  generated  a  dozen  detailed
recommendations  to  address  the  issue;  among  Maria's  many
accomplishments, this one stands out, truly demonstrating the  reach  of
her  efforts,  illustrating  her  willingness  to  tackle  complex  and
challenging issues, and proving her ability to  bring  a  diverse  group
together for a common purpose; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Widely  respected  for her advocacy work, Maria Dibble was
inducted into the New York State Disability Rights Hall of Fame in 2019;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Not only has Maria Dibble  brought  about  change  locally,
statewide,  and  nationally,  she has also inspired and mentored several
generations of advocates, each of whom have gone on to work  for  change
and  inspire  others  to  do  the  same;  this  ripple  effect  ensures
individuals with disabilities in Broome County and beyond will feel  the
impact of Maria's work for generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  occurrence  of such a compassionate
blending of strength, leadership,  intellect,  and  commitment  as  that
demonstrated by Maria Dibble over a lifetime of sacrifice and dedication
to others; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Maria Dibble upon the occasion of her  retirement,  and  to
wish her well in all her future endeavors; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Maria Dibble.
