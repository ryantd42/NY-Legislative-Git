  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 2024, as Radon Awareness Month in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  hereby  memorializes
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 2024, as Radon Awareness Month
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Radon Action Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Radon is a colorless, odorless, invisible gas that can only
be  detected  through  radon  testing;  it  is a radioactive gas that is
produced by the natural decay of uranium that is  found  in  nearly  all
soils; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is estimated that radon causes many thousands of deaths
each year due to breathing air containing radon  which  can  cause  lung
cancer;  the Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading
cause of lung cancer in the United States today; and
 
  WHEREAS, The only way to know if there is a risk from  radon  is  to
test  for  it;  the  EPA and the Surgeon General both strongly recommend
testing all homes below the third floor for radon; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Governor signed Chapter 414 of  2018  which  recognized
the  dangers  of  exposure  and  created a Radon Task Force to conduct a
comprehensive study on the human exposure to radon in indoor settings in
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
serious  health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim January 2024, as Radon
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
