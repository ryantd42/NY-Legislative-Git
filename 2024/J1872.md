  WHEREAS, Jean A. Borgatti's infinite  selflessness  and  benevolence
will shine on through her family's vivid and happy memories; her insight
and  strength  will forever serve as a beacon of love, light and hope to
the countless lives she touched; and

endure the passage of time and will remain as a comforting memory to all
