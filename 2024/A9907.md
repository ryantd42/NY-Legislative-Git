 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. STERN, FLOOD -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the  real  property  actions  and  proceedings  law,  in
  relation to providing for a limited alternative remedy to remove unau-
  thorized persons from residential real property
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The Legislature finds that
 the right to exclude others from  entering,  and  the  right  to  direct
 others  to  immediately  vacate,  residential real property are the most
 important real property  rights.  The  Legislature  further  finds  that
 existing  remedies  regarding unauthorized persons who unlawfully remain
 on residential real property fail to adequately protect  the  rights  of
 the  property  owner and fail to adequately discourage theft and vandal-
 ism.  The intent of this act is to quickly restore possession  of  resi-
 dential real property to the lawful owner of the property when the prop-
 erty  is  being  unlawfully  occupied  and  to thereby preserve property
 rights while limiting the opportunity for criminal activity.
  § 2. The real property actions  and  proceedings  law  is  amended  by
 adding a new section 758 to read as follows:
  §  758. LIMITED ALTERNATIVE REMEDY TO REMOVE UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS FROM
 RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY. 1. A PROPERTY OWNER OR THEIR AUTHORIZED AGENT
 MAY REQUEST FROM A POLICE OFFICER, AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION THIRTY-FOUR
 OF SECTION 1.20 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, THE IMMEDIATE REMOVAL  OF
 A PERSON OR PERSONS UNLAWFULLY OCCUPYING A RESIDENTIAL DWELLING PURSUANT
 TO THIS SECTION IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET:
  (A) THE REQUESTING PERSON IS THE PROPERTY OWNER OR AUTHORIZED AGENT OF
 THE PROPERTY OWNER;
  (B)  THE  REAL  PROPERTY THAT IS BEING OCCUPIED INCLUDES A RESIDENTIAL

  (C) AN UNAUTHORIZED PERSON OR  PERSONS  HAVE  UNLAWFULLY  ENTERED  AND
 REMAIN OR CONTINUE TO RESIDE ON THE PROPERTY OWNER'S PROPERTY;
  (D)  THE  REAL  PROPERTY  WAS NOT OPEN TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AT THE
 TIME THE UNAUTHORIZED PERSON OR PERSONS ENTERED;
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
