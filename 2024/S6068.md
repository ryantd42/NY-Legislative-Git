 provisions of section one hundred sixty-eight-f of this article shall BE
 DEEMED  TO apply TO SUCH OFFENDER. Any sex offender who fails or refuses
 to so comply shall  be  subject  to  the  same  penalties  as  otherwise
 provided  for in this article which would be imposed upon a sex offender
 who fails or refuses to so comply with the provisions of this article on
 or after such effective date.
  § 4. Subdivisions 1 and 2 of section 168-h of the correction  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  1  of  the  laws  of  2006, are amended to read as
 follows:
  1. The duration of registration and verification for  a  sex  offender
 who  has  not  been  designated a sexual predator, or a sexually violent
 offender, or a predicate sex offender, and who is classified as a  level

 al  predator,  or a sexually violent offender, or a predicate sex offen-

 der, may be relieved of the duty to register and verify as  provided  by
 subdivision one of section one hundred sixty-eight-o of this article.
