BY: Senator HINCHEY
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  150th  Anniversary  of  the
  Hudson-Athens Lighthouse
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate  the  Hudson-Athens  Lighthouse  upon  the  occasion  of
celebrating its 150th Anniversary on Saturday, June 1, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  Hudson  River  lies  Middle Ground Flats, a large
sandbar that historically  divided  the  river  for  nearly  two  miles,
wreaking  havoc  on  unsuspecting steamboats, cargo ships, tugboats, and
other commercial and recreational vessels; and
 
  WHEREAS, To warn mariners of the danger, after much  petitioning  to
the  United  States  Congress,  an  appropriation  of  $35,000  to begin
construction on the Hudson City Light, now known  as  the  Hudson-Athens
Lighthouse,  was approved in 1872; its inaugural oil lamp was lighted by
the first lightkeeper, Henry Best, in 1874; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Hudson-Athens Lighthouse is in the center of the Hudson
River, accessible only by boat and equidistant from the City  of  Hudson
and  the  Village of Athens; it is one of seven remaining lighthouses on
the Hudson River and one of  two  remaining  lighthouses  surrounded  by
water; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  eight-room Hudson-Athens Lighthouse is an engineering
marvel with its northern corner shaped like a ship's prow to deflect ice
floes and its granite foundation blocks resting on  200  wooden  pilings
driven  50  feet into the riverbed, packed with protective mud, and held
in place by huge boulder rip rap; this shining  icon  is  documented  by
nine architectural drawings in the Library of Congress; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United States Coast Guard automated the Hudson-Athens
Lighthouse's lamp in 1949, eliminating lightkeepers and ending  building
maintenance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  decades, neglect, weather, and river conditions
have taken a toll on the  Hudson-Athens  Lighthouse;  it  now  faces  an
existential  threat  from unintended damage caused by commercial vessels
passing in the nearby navigation channel  which  is  maintained  by  the
United States Army Corps of Engineers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1982,  a  small group of citizens formed the nonprofit
Hudson-Athens Lighthouse Preservation Society with the mission  to  save
the  lighthouse  and share its rich history, leasing it in 1984 from the
United States Coast Guard and receiving ownership in 2000; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Hudson-Athens Lighthouse is now  an  active,  chartered
New  York  State museum and is listed on the New York State and National
Registers of Historic Places; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Hudson-Athens Lighthouse continues to be enjoyed by the
community,  providing  popular tours for school children, residents, and
visitors from near and far; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  May  1,  2024,  the  National  Trust  for  Historic
Preservation  designated  the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse as one of 11 Most
Endangered Places because of the imminent threat to  the  lighthouse  as
well  as  its historic value and multi-faceted role in the identities of
its communities, the region, and the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Together  with  individual,  local,  state,  and  federal
partners,  the  Hudson-Athens  Lighthouse  Preservation  Society  is
relentlessly working to secure necessary funds to preserve, restore, and
protect the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse, from the  riverbed  to  its  tower
light, for another 100 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  June 1, 2024, a Hudson River flotilla of more than 100
vessels  of  all  shapes,  sizes,  and  purposes  will  mark  the  150th
Anniversary  of  the  Hudson-Athens  Lighthouse  and  launch a summer of
celebratory activities and events; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  150th Anniversary of the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse Preservation Society.
