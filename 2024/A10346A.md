 ment, liquidity or credit support arrangement or other similar agreement

 increase in interest rates.
  2. "Assignee" means any  individual,  corporation,  limited  liability
 company,  partnership  or  limited  partnership,  trust or other legally

  4. "Consumer" means any individual, governmental body, trust, business
 entity, nonprofit organization or other legally recognized  entity  that
 takes  electric  delivery  service  within  the service area by means of

 ration or other entity.

  (b) any payment approved in the financing order and required under  an
 ancillary agreement or other accounts established under the terms of any
 indenture,  ancillary agreement, or other financing documents pertaining
 to recovery bonds;
  (c)  provided  that  recovery  bonds  shall be the only method used to
 recover the costs identified in this paragraph, any other  cost  related
 to  issuing, supporting, repaying, and servicing recovery bonds, includ-
 ing but not limited to servicing fees,  accounting  and  auditing  fees,
 trustee  fees,  legal fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, place-
 ment and underwriting fees, capitalized interest,  rating  agency  fees,
 stock  exchange  listing and compliance fees, and filing fees, including

 franchise fees or license fees imposed on recovery charge revenues.
  6.  "Financing  order"  means an order of the commission which author-
 izes:
  (a) the issuance of recovery bonds;

  (d)  the  sale,  assignment,  or  transfer  of recovery property to an

 costs and financing costs, to such level as the commission may authorize
 in  a financing order, and which are secured by or payable from recovery
 property, and that have a final maturity date of no longer  than  twenty

 institutions, insurance companies, fiduciaries, and other  persons  that
 require statutory authority regarding legal investment.
  11.  "Recovery  charge" means the amounts authorized by the commission
 to recover recovery costs and financing costs.  If  provided  for  in  a

 the utility corporation or its successors or assignees under rate sched-
 ules  or  special  contracts  approved  by  the commission. The recovery

 component failures.
  18.  "Storm"  means  a  period of adverse weather during which service

 ing area and/or result in consumers being without electric  service  for

 zation,  staging,  and  construction,  reconstruction,  replacement,  or
 repair of electric generation, transmission, or distribution facilities.
  20. "Storm recovery costs" means, if requested  by  a  utility  corpo-
 ration  and  approved  by  the commission, costs incurred before July 1,

  § 3. Financing orders. 1. No utility corporation or its  affiliate  or
 other assignee shall issue any recovery bonds unless it has been specif-
 ically  authorized to do so by a financing order issued pursuant to this
 section. No later than two years after the effective date of this act, a
 utility corporation may petition the commission for  a  financing  order
 granting  such  authority.  Such  petition  shall be made under oath and
 shall be signed and filed on behalf of the utility  corporation  or  its
 affiliate  or  other  assignee  by the president or by a vice president,
 treasurer, or other executive officer having knowledge  of  the  matters
 set  forth therein and shall be submitted in such form as the commission
 shall prescribe.
  2. Each petition filed under this section shall  include  all  of  the
 following:
  (a)  A  description  of the storm recovery activities that the utility
 corporation has undertaken and the reasons for  undertaking  the  activ-
 ities.
  (b)  The  storm  recovery costs the utility corporation has determined
 would be appropriate to recover through recovery bonds and is seeking to
 recover, and the level that the utility corporation is funding  or  will
 seek  to  fund  through  other means, together with a description of the
 factors and calculations used in determining such amounts and methods of
 recovery.
  (c) Whether the utility corporation  proposes  to  finance  all  or  a
 portion  of  the  recovery  costs using recovery bonds.  If the utility
 corporation proposes to finance a portion of  such  costs,  the  utility
 corporation  must  identify  the  specific  portion  in the petition. An
 election not to finance a portion of the recovery costs  using  recovery
 bonds by a utility corporation shall not be deemed to waive its right to
 recover such costs pursuant to a separate proceeding with the commission
 pursuant to this act.
  (d) An estimate of the financing costs related to the recovery bonds.
  (e)  An  estimate  of  the  recovery  charges necessary to recover the
 recovery costs and financing costs and the period for recovery  of  such
 costs.
  (f) A comparison between the net present value of the costs to consum-
 ers that are estimated to result from the issuance of recovery bonds and
 the  result  from the application of the traditional method of financing
 and recovering recovery costs from consumers.  The  comparison  should
 demonstrate  that  the  issuance of recovery bonds and the imposition of
 recovery charges  are  expected  to  provide  quantifiable  benefits  to
 consumers.
  3.  (a)  The  commission may grant a petition under subdivision one of
 this section in whole or in part by issuing a financing order, with such
 modifications thereto and upon such terms and conditions as the  commis-
 sion  prescribes  and  that  are consistent with this act, provided such
 financing is prudent and would provide a net benefit to the consumer. If
 the commission issues a financing order approving the issuance of recov-
 ery bonds under this act, the commission shall consider whether:
 A. 10346--A  5
 
  (i) the proposed issuance of recovery bonds  and  the  imposition  and
 collection  of  a  recovery  charge are expected to provide quantifiable
 benefits to consumers as compared to the  costs  that  would  have  been
 incurred absent the issuance of recovery bonds; and
  (ii)  the  proposed structuring, expected pricing, and financing costs
 of the recovery bonds are reasonably expected to result  in  the  lowest
 recovery  charges  consistent  with  market  conditions  at the time the
 recovery bonds are priced and the terms of the financing order or  would
 avoid or mitigate rate impacts to consumers as compared with traditional
 methods of financing or recovering recovery costs.
  (b)  The commission may determine what degree of flexibility to afford
 to the utility corporation or assignees in establishing  the  terms  and
 conditions of the recovery bonds, including but not limited to repayment
 schedules,  interest  rates,  and  other  financing costs. A copy of any
 financing order issued under this act duly certified by  a  commissioner
 or  other  person authorized to act on behalf of the commission shall be
 sufficient evidence for all purposes of whole and complete compliance by
 the utility corporation with all procedural and other  matters  required
 precedent to the issuance of the order.
  4.  Proceedings on a petition submitted pursuant to this section begin
 with the petition for a financing order filed by a  utility  corporation
 with  the  commission  for  review  and  approval within 135 days of the
 filing of the petition and shall be disposed of in accordance  with  the
 requirements of this act and the rules of the commission.
  5. A financing order issued by the commission to a utility corporation
 shall:
  (a)  Specify the amount of storm recovery costs, taking into consider-
 ation, to the extent the commission deems appropriate, any other methods
 used to recover these costs and any offsets or credits to  those  costs,
 and  provide  with respect to the amount of financing costs which may be
 recovered through recovery charges;
  (b) Provide that the proposed financing through issuance  of  recovery
 bonds and the imposition and collection of recovery charges are expected
 to  provide  quantifiable benefits to consumers as compared to the costs
 that would have been incurred absent the issuance of the recovery  bonds
 and  that the net present value of the costs to consumers that are esti-
 mated to result from the  financing through issuance of  recovery  bonds
 is  less  than  the net present value of costs of the application of the
 traditional method of  financing  and  recovering  recovery  costs  from
 consumers;
  (c) Provide that the structuring and pricing of the recovery bonds are
 expected to result in the lowest recovery charges consistent with market
 conditions  at  the time the recovery bonds are priced and the terms set
 forth in such financing order;
  (d) Specify and create the recovery property of a utility  corporation
 or  its successors or assignees that may be used to pay or secure recov-
 ery bonds and financing costs;
  (e) Provide that such recovery property may be: (i) sold, assigned, or
 transferred by the utility corporation to  (A)  a  subsidiary  which  is
 wholly  owned,  directly  or  indirectly, by the utility corporation and
 which will be the issuer of the recovery bonds or (B)  another  assignee
 which will be the issuer of the recovery bonds; or
  (ii)  created  or  recognized as property of an assignee which will be
 the issuer of the recovery bonds;
  (f) Provide that the recovery charges shall be sufficient at all times
 to pay the principal of and interest on the recovery bonds as  the  same
 A. 10346--A  6
 
 shall become due and payable and all other financing costs and establish
 a  true-up mechanism requiring that the recovery charges be reviewed and
 adjusted at least annually to correct any  overcollection  or  undercol-
 lection during the period since the issuance or preceding adjustment and
 to ensure the projected recovery of amounts sufficient to provide timely
 payment  of  all  principal,  interest  and  other financing costs. Each
 adjustment to the recovery charge, in amounts as  calculated  by  or  on
 behalf  of  the  owner of recovery property, pursuant to a method estab-
 lished in the financing order, shall automatically become  effective  60
 days  following  the date on which the periodic adjustment is filed with
 the commission unless the commission approves an earlier effective  date
 requested by the issuer of recovery bonds;
  (g)  Provide  and  pledge  that  after  the earlier of the transfer of
 recovery property to an assignee  or  the  issuance  of  recovery  bonds
 authorized thereby, a financing order is irrevocable until the indefeas-
 ible  payment in full of the recovery bonds and the financing costs and,
 provided that, except as provided in subdivision 8 of this section or to
 implement any true-up mechanism adopted by the commission  as  described
 in  paragraph  (f)  of  this  subdivision, the commission may not amend,
 modify, or terminate the financing order by  any  subsequent  action  or
 reduce, impair, postpone, terminate, or otherwise adjust recovery charg-
 es  approved  in  the  financing  order, provided nothing shall preclude
 limitation or alteration if and when full compensation,  including  full
 cost  recovery,  is made for the full protection of the recovery charges
 collected pursuant to a financing order and the full protection  of  the
 holders of recovery bonds and any assignee or financing party;
  (h)  Specify  how  amounts collected from consumers shall be allocated
 between recovery charges and other charges;
  (i) Provide that a financing order remains in effect until the  recov-
 ery  bonds  issued  pursuant to the order have been indefeasibly paid in
 full and the financing costs of such bonds have been recovered in full;
  (j) Provide that a financing order shall remain in effect and unabated
 notwithstanding the  reorganization,  bankruptcy,  or  other  insolvency
 proceedings, or merger or sale, of the applicable utility corporation or
 its successors or assignees;
  (k)  Authorize and require the utility corporation, to the extent that
 any interest in recovery property is sold or  assigned,  shall  contract
 with  the  assignee  or  any  financing party to continue to operate its
 system to provide service to its consumers, collect amounts  in  respect
 of  the recovery charges for the benefit and account of such assignee or
 financing party, and account for and remit such amounts to  or  for  the
 account  of  such  assignee  or financing party, including pursuant to a
 sequestration order authorized by  subdivision  6  of  section  four  or
 subdivision 7 of section six of this act; and
  (l)  Provide  that  any  cost  to  the consumer in connection with the
 financing order, that is not identified in  and  provided  for  in  such
 financing  order,  shall  not be recovered through any rates or recovery
 charges, and shall solely be the obligation of the  utility  corporation
 or its successors or assignees.
  6.  In each financing order issued to or on behalf of a utility corpo-
 ration, the commission shall:
  (a) Prescribe any limitations on potential assignees of recovery prop-
 erty;
  (b) Authorize an assignee which is a subsidiary of  a  utility  corpo-
 ration  and which issues recovery bonds or another assignee which issues
 recovery bonds to provide and establish in its organizational documents,
 A. 10346--A  7
 
 partnership agreement, or operating agreement, as  applicable,  that  in
 order  for a person to file a voluntary bankruptcy petition on behalf of
 such assignee, the prior unanimous consent of the  directors,  partners,
 or  managers,  as  applicable, shall be required.  If so authorized in a
 financing order, any such provision  set  forth  in  the  organizational
 documents,  partnership  agreement,  or  operating  agreement of such an
 assignee shall constitute a legal, valid, and binding agreement  of  the
 shareholders,  partners, or members, as applicable, of such assignee and
 shall be enforceable against such shareholders,  partners,  or  members;
 and
  (c)  Provide  that  the  creation of the recovery property pursuant to
 paragraph (d) of subdivision 5 of  this  section  shall  be  conditioned
 upon,  and  shall be simultaneous with either: (i) the sale, assignment,
 or other transfer of the recovery property to an assignee; or  (ii)  the
 issuance  of the recovery bonds and the security interest created in the
 recovery property to secure recovery bonds.
  7. After the issuance of a financing order, and within such  time  and
 subject  to  any other limitations set forth in the financing order, the
 utility  corporation  retains  discretion  regarding  whether  to  sell,
 assign, or otherwise transfer recovery property or to cause the recovery
 bonds  to be issued, including the right to defer or postpone such sale,
 assignment, transfer, or issuance.
  8. At the  request  of  a  utility  corporation,  the  commission  may
 commence  a  proceeding  and  issue  a  subsequent  financing order that
 provides for the refinancing, retiring, or refunding of  recovery  bonds
 issued  by  an  affiliate  of  the  utility  corporation pursuant to the
 original financing order if the commission  finds  that  the  subsequent
 financing  order satisfies all of the criteria specified in subdivisions
 3 and 5 of this section or that provides for an  accounting,  refunding,
 or  crediting  to  consumers  of  the  proceeds of any true-up mechanism
 adopted by the commission in accordance with paragraph (f)  of  subdivi-
 sion  5 of this section.  Effective on retirement of the refunded recov-
 ery bonds and the issuance of new recovery  bonds,  the  commission  may
 adjust  the related recovery charges accordingly or establish substitute
 recovery charges, provided any such subsequent order shall be consistent
 with the provisions of subdivision 5 of this section.
  9. (a) The commission shall not, in exercising its powers and carrying
 out its duties regarding any matter within  its  authority  pursuant  to
 this  act,  consider  the  recovery bonds issued pursuant to a financing
 order to be the debt of the utility corporation other than  for  federal
 income  tax  purposes,  consider  the  recovery  charges  paid under the
 financing order to be the revenue of the  utility  corporation  for  any
 purpose,  or consider the recovery costs or financing costs specified in
 the financing order to be the costs of the utility corporation.
  (b) The commission may not order or otherwise directly  or  indirectly
 require  a  utility  corporation  to  use  recovery bonds to finance any
 project, addition,  plant,  facility,  extension,  capital  improvement,
 equipment,  or  any other expenditure. After the issuance of a financing
 order, the utility corporation retains sole discretion whether to  cause
 the  recovery  bonds to be issued, including the right to defer or post-
 pone such sale, assignment, transfer or issuance. Nothing shall  prevent
 the  utility  corporation from abandoning the issuance of recovery bonds
 under the financing order by filing with the commission a  statement  of
 abandonment  and  the reasons therefor.  The commission shall not refuse
 to allow a utility corporation to recover recovery costs that  would  be
 otherwise  permissible for recovery or refuse or condition authorization
 A. 10346--A  8
 
 or approval of the issuance and sale by a utility corporation of securi-
 ties or the assumption by the  utility  corporation  of  liabilities  or
 obligations,  solely  because  of the potential availability of recovery
 bond financing.
  10.  All  financing orders issued by the commission shall be operative
 and in full force and effect on the date of the issuance of such order.
  11. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, any action, suit or
 proceeding to which the commission or the recovery bond issuer may be  a
 party,  in  which  any question arises as to the validity of this act or
 any financing order, shall be preferred over all other civil  causes  in
 all courts of the state, except election matters, and shall be heard and
 determined  in  preference  to all other civil business pending therein,
 except election matters, irrespective of position on the calendar.  Such
 preference shall also be granted upon petition of counsel to the commis-
 sion in any action or proceeding questioning the validity of any financ-
 ing  order  or  other  decision made by the commission under this act in
 which such counsel may be allowed to  intervene.  Notwithstanding  any
 other  provision  of  law to the contrary, the validity of any financing
 order or other decision may only be challenged  by  an  aggrieved  party
 pursuant to an action, suit or proceeding filed within thirty days after
 such  financing  order  becomes  final; provided, however, that any such
 action, suit or proceeding and all supporting papers shall be  commenced
 directly  in  the  supreme  court,  appellate  division,  third judicial
 department.
  12. A financing order shall require the recovery bond  issuer  or  the
 assignee  to  file  at least annually with the commission, the governor,
 the temporary president of the senate, the speaker of the assembly,  the
 chair  of  the  senate  finance committee, and the chair of the assembly
 ways and means committee, a periodic  report  showing  the  billing  and
 collection  of  recovery  charges,  the  application  of recovery charge
 revenues to debt service on the recovery bonds and other ongoing financ-
 ing costs, and the balances in any accounts required  by  the  financing
 order, and any other information the commission deems necessary.
  §  4.  Recovery  property.  1.  All recovery property specified in a
 financing order shall constitute an existing,  present  property  right.
 Such  property shall exist whether or not the revenues or proceeds aris-
 ing from the property have been  billed,  have  accrued,  or  have  been
 collected.
  2.  Recovery property specified in a financing order shall continue to
 exist until the recovery bonds issued pursuant to such order are paid in
 full and all financing costs of the bonds have been recovered in full.
  3. All or any portion of recovery property specified  in  a  financing
 order  issued  to a utility corporation may be sold, assigned, or trans-
 ferred to a successor or an assignee, including an affiliate  or  affil-
 iates  of  the utility corporation or any other assignee created for the
 limited purpose of acquiring, owning, or administering recovery property
 or issuing recovery bonds under the financing order.  All or any portion
 of recovery property may be encumbered by a security interest to  secure
 recovery  bonds  issued pursuant to the order and other financing costs.
 Each such sale, assignment, transfer, or security interest granted by  a
 utility  corporation  or  affiliate of a utility corporation or assignee
 shall be considered to be a transaction in the ordinary course of  busi-
 ness.
  4.  The  description  of  recovery  property  being sold, assigned, or
 transferred to an assignee in any sale agreement, purchase agreement, or
 other transfer agreement or created and recognized  as  property  of  an
 A. 10346--A  9
 
 assignee  in  accordance  with  subdivision  nine of this section, being
 encumbered to a secured party in any security agreement,  pledge  agree-
 ment,  or  other security document, or indicated in any financing state-
 ment  is only sufficient if such description or indication refers to the
 specific financing order that created the recovery property  and  states
 that  such  agreement  or financing statement covers all or part of such
 recovery property described in such financing order.  A description  of
 recovery  property  in  a  financing statement shall be sufficient if it
 refers to the financing order creating  the  recovery  property.  This
 subdivision  shall  apply to all purported sales, assignments, or trans-
 fers of, and all purported liens  or  security  interests  in,  recovery
 property,  regardless  of  whether  the related sale agreement, purchase
 agreement, other transfer agreement, security agreement,  pledge  agree-
 ment,  or  other  security  document  was entered into, or any financing
 statement was filed, before or after the effective date of this act.
  5. Every electric bill  issued  by  a  utility  corporation  that  has
 obtained  a financing order and caused recovery bonds to be issued shall
 comply with the provisions of this subdivision; provided, however,  that
 the  failure  of  a  utility corporation to comply with this subdivision
 shall not invalidate, impair, or affect any  financing  order,  recovery
 property, recovery charge, or recovery bonds.  Every such bill shall:
  (a)  Explicitly  reflect  that  a  portion of the charges on such bill
 represents recovery charges approved in a financing order issued to  the
 utility  corporation  and, if the recovery property has been transferred
 to, or created at, an assignee, must include a statement to  the  effect
 that  the  assignee  is  the owner of the rights to recovery charges and
 that the utility corporation or other entity, if applicable,  is  acting
 as  a collection agent or servicer for that assignee.  The tariff appli-
 cable to consumers must indicate the recovery charge and  the  ownership
 of the charge.
  (b)  Include the recovery charge on each consumer's bill as a separate
 line item and include either the rate or the amount  of  the  charge  on
 each bill.
  6. If a utility corporation defaults on any required payment of charg-
 es  arising  from  recovery property specified in a financing order, the
 supreme court, Albany county, upon petition by an interested party,  and
 without  limiting  any  other  remedies available to the applying party,
 shall order the sequestration and payment of the revenues  arising  from
 the recovery property to the financing parties or their representatives.
 Any such order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any
 reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency proceedings with respect
 to the utility corporation or its successors or assignees.
  7.  The  interest of an assignee or secured party in recovery property
 specified in a financing order shall not be subject to setoff,  counter-
 claim,  surcharge,  or  defense  by the utility corporation or any other
 person, or in connection with the reorganization, bankruptcy,  or  other
 insolvency of the utility corporation or any other entity.
  8.  Any  successor  to  a utility corporation, whether pursuant to any
 reorganization, bankruptcy, or other insolvency  proceeding  or  whether
 pursuant  to any merger or acquisition, sale, or other business combina-
 tion, or transfer by operation of law, as a  result  of  utility  corpo-
 ration  restructuring  or otherwise, shall perform and satisfy all obli-
 gations of, and have the same rights under  a  financing  order  as  the
 utility  corporation under the financing order in the same manner and to
 the same extent as the utility  corporation,  including  collection  and
 A. 10346--A  10
 
 payment  of  any  revenues  and proceeds of the recovery property to any
 person entitled thereto.
  9.  Upon petition by the utility corporation, recovery property may be
 immediately created by operation of law on the latter of the issuance of
 a financing order, or the issuance of the recovery bonds by an assignee.
 Recovery property created in accordance  with  this  subdivision  shall,
 upon  creation,  belong  to the assignee and such assignee will have the
 same rights to and benefits arising from the  recovery  property  as  it
 would  have  if  it  acquired  such  recovery  property as a result of a
 purchase, acquisition or other transfer from the utility corporation.
  § 5. Sale, assignment, or transfer of recovery property.  1. The sale,
 assignment, or other transfer of recovery property by a  utility  corpo-
 ration  to  an  assignee that the parties have in the governing contract
 expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer  shall  consti-
 tute  an absolute transfer and true sale of, and not a security interest
 in, the transferor's right, title, and interest in, to, and  under  such
 recovery property, other than for federal and state income tax purposes.
 The parties' characterization of such transaction as a sale of an inter-
 est  in  recovery property shall be conclusive that the transaction is a
 true sale and that ownership has passed to the  party  characterized  as
 the purchaser, regardless of whether the purchaser has possession of any
 documents  evidencing  or  pertaining  to the interest.  After any such
 transaction, the recovery property shall not be subject to any claims of
 the transferor or the transferor's creditors, other than creditors hold-
 ing a prior security interest in the recovery property  perfected  under
 section eight of this act.
  2.  Notwithstanding  any provision of law to the contrary, the charac-
 terization of any sale, assignment, or other transfer as a true sale  or
 other  absolute  transfer  pursuant to subdivision 1 of this section and
 the corresponding characterization of the assignee's  property  interest
 shall  be determinative and conclusive irrespective of, and not affected
 or impaired by, the existence of any or all  of  the  following  circum-
 stances:
  (a)  Commingling of amounts arising with respect to the recovery prop-
 erty with other amounts;
  (b) The retention by the transferor of a partial or residual interest,
 including an equity interest or  entitlement  to  any  surplus,  in  the
 recovery property, whether direct or indirect, or whether subordinate or
 otherwise;
  (c)  Any  recourse  that the assignee may have against the transferor,
 except that any such recourse shall not be created, contingent upon,  or
 otherwise occurring or resulting from the inability or failure of one or
 more of the transferor's consumers to timely pay all or a portion of the
 recovery charge;
  (d)  Any  indemnifications,  obligations, or repurchase rights made or
 provided by the transferor, except that  such  indemnity  or  repurchase
 rights  shall  not  be  based  solely upon the inability or failure of a
 transferor's consumers to timely pay all or a portion  of  the  recovery
 charge;
  (e)  The transferor acting as the collector of the recovery charges or
 the existence of any contract described in paragraph (k) of  subdivision
 5 of section three of this act;
  (f)  The contrary or other treatment of the sale, assignment, or other
 transfer for tax, financial reporting, or other purposes;
  (g) The granting or providing to holders of the recovery  bonds  of  a
 preferred  right  to  the recovery property or credit enhancement by the
 A. 10346--A  11
 
 utility corporation or its  affiliates  with  respect  to  the  recovery
 bonds; or
  (h)  The  status  of the assignee as a direct or indirect wholly owned
 subsidiary or other affiliate of the utility corporation.  The  separate
 juridical  personality  of  any assignee of recovery property which is a
 subsidiary or affiliate of the utility corporation shall not  be  disre-
 garded  due  to  the  fact that the assignee and the utility corporation
 share any one or more incidents of control, including  common  managers,
 officers,  directors,  members,  accounting  or  administrative systems,
 consolidated tax returns, or office space, that the assignee  may  be  a
 disregarded  entity  for  tax  purposes,  that  the electric corporation
 caused the formation of the assignee, that a  contract  by  the  utility
 corporation and the assignee described in paragraph (k) of subdivision 5
 of  section  three  of  this  act exists, that the assignee has no other
 business other than  pertaining  to  the  recovery  property,  that  the
 capitalization  of  the  assignee  is  limited  to  amounts required for
 compliance with certain applicable federal income tax laws  and  revenue
 procedures,  or  that  other  factors used in applying a single business
 enterprise test to juridical persons are present.
  3. Any right that a utility corporation has in the  recovery  property
 prior  to  its  sale,  assignment, or transfer shall be in the form of a
 contractual right or chose in action notwithstanding any contrary treat-
 ment thereof for accounting or tax purposes.  The ownership of an inter-
 est in recovery  property  is  voluntarily  transferred  by  a  contract
 between  the owner and the assignee that purports to transfer the owner-
 ship of that interest.  Unless  otherwise  provided,  the  transfer  of
 ownership  between  the  parties  shall be effective as soon as there is
 written agreement on the interest, the purchase price is fixed, and  the
 financing  order  has been issued.  Such transfer shall be perfected and
 take effect against all third parties including,  but  not  limited  to,
 subsequent lien creditors when the transfer has become effective between
 the  parties  and  when a financing statement giving notice of the sale,
 assignment, or transfer is filed in accordance  with  subdivision  4  of
 this  section.  Delivery of such an interest in recovery property shall
 take place by operation of law upon the filing of the  financing  state-
 ment.
  4.  Financing statements required to be filed under this section shall
 be filed, indexed, maintained, and continued in the same manner  and  in
 the same system of records maintained for the filing of financing state-
 ments  under  article  9  of the uniform commercial code.  The filing of
 such financing statement shall be the only method of perfecting a  sale,
 assignment,  or transfer of recovery property.  The sale, assignment, or
 transfer of an interest in  recovery  property  perfected  by  filing  a
 financing  statement  shall  be  effective  against  any consumers owing
 payment of the recovery charges, creditors of the transferor, subsequent
 transferees, and all other third persons notwithstanding the absence  of
 actual  knowledge  of  or notice to such consumers of such sale, assign-
 ment, or transfer.
  5. The priority of the conflicting ownership interests of assignees in
 the same interest or rights in any recovery property shall be determined
 as follows:
  (a) Conflicting  perfected  interests  or  rights  of  assignees  rank
 according to priority in time of perfection.
  (b)  A  perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority over a
 conflicting unperfected interest or right of an assignee.
 A. 10346--A  12
 
  (c) A perfected interest or right of an assignee has priority  over  a
 person  who  becomes  a  lien  creditor  after  the  perfection  of such
 assignee's interest or right.
  6.  The  priority  of  a sale, assignment, or transfer perfected under
 this section shall not be impaired by  any  later  modification  of  the
 financing  order  or  recovery  property  or by the commingling of funds
 arising from recovery property with other funds.  Any  other  security
 interest  that  may  apply to such funds, other than a security interest
 perfected under section six of this act, shall be terminated when  those
 funds  are  transferred  to  a  segregated account for the assignee or a
 financing party.  If recovery property has been transferred to an assig-
 nee or financing party, any proceeds of such property shall be held  for
 and  delivered to the assignee or financing party by any collector under
 any contract described in paragraph (k)  of  subdivision  5  of  section
 three of this act as a mandatary and fiduciary.
  § 6. Security interests. 1. The provisions of article 9 of the uniform
 commercial  code  relating  to  secured  transactions shall not apply to
 recovery property or any right, title, or interest of a  corporation  or
 assignee  therein,  whether  before or after the issuance of a financing
 order, except as provided in subdivision 1 of section seven of this act.
 In addition, such right, title, or interest pertaining  to  a  financing
 order,  including  but not limited to, the associated recovery property,
 and any revenues, collections,  claims,  rights  to  payment,  payments,
 money,  or proceeds of or arising from recovery charges pursuant to such
 order, shall not be deemed proceeds of any right or interest other  than
 of  the  financing  order  and  the  recovery  property arising from the
 financing order.  All revenues and collections resulting  from  recovery
 property shall constitute proceeds only of the recovery property arising
 from the financing order.
  2.  Except  to the extent provided in this act with respect to filings
 of financing statements or control of  deposit  accounts  or  investment
 property  as  original  collateral,  the creation, attachment, granting,
 perfection, and priority of security interests in recovery  property  to
 secure  recovery  bonds shall be governed solely by this article and not
 by the uniform commercial code.
  3. (a) A security interest in recovery property is valid and enforcea-
 ble against the utility corporation and its successor or an assignee and
 third parties and attaches to recovery property only after  all  of  the
 following conditions are met:
  (i) The issuance of a financing order;
  (ii) The execution and delivery of a security agreement with a financ-
 ing party in connection with the issuance of recovery bonds; and
  (iii) The receipt of value for the recovery bonds.
  (b) A security interest attaches to recovery property without physical
 delivery of collateral or other act when all of the foregoing conditions
 have  been  met,  unless  the security agreement expressly postpones the
 time of attachment.
  4. A security interest in recovery property is perfected  only  if  it
 has  attached and a financing statement indicating the recovery property
 collateral covered thereby has been filed.  A financing  statement  must
 be  filed  to perfect all security interests and liens in storm recovery
 property under this act.  A security interest in  recovery  property  is
 perfected  when it has attached and when the applicable financing state-
 ment has been filed.  The interest of a secured party is  not  perfected
 unless  a financing statement sufficient under this act and otherwise in
 accordance  with  the  uniform  commercial  code  is  filed,  and  after
 A. 10346--A  13

 perfection  the secured party's interest continues in the recovery prop-
 erty and all proceeds of such recovery property, whether or not  billed,
 accrued,  or  collected,  and  whether  or  not deposited into a deposit
 account  and  however  evidenced.  A  security interest in proceeds of
 recovery property is a  perfected  security  interest  if  the  security
 interest  in the recovery property was perfected under this act. Financ-
 ing statements required to be filed pursuant to this act shall be filed,
 indexed, maintained, and continued in the same manner and  in  the  same
 system  of  records  maintained  for  the filing of financing statements
 under the uniform commercial code, except that  the  requirement  as  to
 continuation  statements does not apply.  The filing of such a financing
 statement shall be the only method of  perfecting  a  lien  or  security
 interest  on  recovery property.  The financing statement shall be filed
 as if the debtor named therein were located in this state.
  5. The priority of  the  conflicting  security  interests  of  secured
 parties  in  the  same  interest  or  rights in any recovery property is
 determined as follows:
  (a) Conflicting perfected security interests of secured  parties  rank
 according to priority in time of perfection;
  (b) A perfected security interest of a secured party has priority over
 a conflicting unperfected security interest of a secured party; and
  (c) A perfected security interest of a secured party has priority over
 a  person  who  becomes  a  lien  creditor  after the perfection of such
 secured party's security interest.
  6. A perfected security interest in recovery property and all proceeds
 of such recovery property, whether or not billed, accrued, or collected,
 and whether  or  not  deposited  into  a  deposit  account  and  however
 evidenced,  shall  have priority over a conflicting lien or privilege of
 any nature in the same collateral property, except a  security  interest
 is  subordinate  to  the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor
 before the perfection of such security interest.  A security interest in
 recovery property which qualifies for priority over a conflicting  secu-
 rity interest, lien, or privilege also has priority over the conflicting
 security  interest, lien, or privilege in proceeds of the recovery prop-
 erty.  The relative priority of a  perfected  security  interest  of  a
 secured party is not adversely affected by any lien, privilege, or secu-
 rity  interest in a deposit account of the utility corporation that is a
 collector as described in paragraph (k)  of  subdivision  5  of  section
 three of this act and into which the revenues are deposited. The priori-
 ty  of  a  security  interest  perfected under this section shall not be
 defeated or impaired by any later modification of the financing order or
 recovery property or by the commingling of funds arising  from  recovery
 property  with  other funds.  Any other security interest that may apply
 to those funds shall be terminated as to  all  funds  transferred  to  a
 segregated  account  for the benefit of an assignee or a financing party
 or to an  assignee  or  financing  party  directly.  The  perfection  by
 control,  the  effect  of  perfection  by control, and the priority of a
 security interest granted by the issuer of and securing  recovery  bonds
 held  by  a secured party having control of a segregated deposit account
 or securities  account  as  original  collateral  into  which  revenues,
 collections,  or proceeds of recovery property are deposited or credited
 shall be governed by section 1-301 of uniform commercial code.
  7. If a default occurs under the  terms  of  any  recovery  bond,  the
 secured  party may foreclose on or otherwise enforce the security inter-
 est in any recovery property as if it was  a  secured  party  under  the
 uniform  commercial code. A secured party holding a security interest in
 A. 10346--A  14
 
 recovery property shall be entitled to exercise all of the  same  rights
 and  remedies  available to a secured party under the uniform commercial
 code, to the same extent as if those rights and remedies were set  forth
 in  this  act.  The  court  may order that amounts arising from recovery
 property be transferred to a separate account of the secured  party  for
 the  financing  parties' benefit, to which their security interest shall
 apply. On petition by or on behalf of a secured party, the  court  shall
 order the sequestration and payment to the financing parties of revenues
 arising from the recovery property.
  8.  A  security  interest created under this section may provide for a
 security interest in after-acquired collateral.  Such security  interest
 shall  not be invalid or fraudulent against creditors solely because the
 grantor or the utility corporation as  collector  or  servicer  has  the
 right  or  ability  to commingle the collateral or proceeds, or collect,
 compromise, enforce, and otherwise deal with collateral.
  9. Any action arising under the provisions of this act  to  enforce  a
 security  interest  in  recovery property, or which otherwise asserts an
 interest in, or a right in, to or against any recovery property, wherev-
 er located or deemed located, or any security interest governed by  this
 act,  shall be brought in the supreme court, Albany county. Such actions
 shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the civil practice law
 and rules and other law applicable to executory  proceedings,  including
 provisional  remedies,  but  only to the extent such laws are consistent
 with the language and purposes of this act.
  § 7. Choice of law; conflicts. 1.  The  law  governing  the  validity,
 enforceability,  attachment, perfection, priority, exercise of remedies,
 and venue with respect to the creation, recognition,  sale,  assignment,
 or transfer of an interest or right or the creation of a security inter-
 est  in  any  recovery  property  shall  be exclusively the laws of this
 state, without applying  this  state's  law  on  conflict  of  laws  and
 notwithstanding  any  contrary contractual provision, except as provided
 in subdivision 6 of section six of this act. The validity, enforceabili-
 ty, attachment, perfection, priority,  and  exercise  of  remedies  with
 respect  to  the creation, recognition, sale, assignment, or transfer of
 an interest or right or the creation  of  a  security  interest  in  any
 recovery  property  shall  be  governed  by  this act, and solely to the
 extent not addressed by this act, by the  uniform  commercial  code  and
 other  laws  of this state. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this
 act provides that the uniform commercial code applies to the filings  of
 financing  statements  referenced in this act, to perfection, the effect
 of perfection or nonperfection, and the priority of  security  interests
 held by a secured party having control of deposit accounts or securities
 accounts as original collateral securing recovery bonds, notwithstanding
 that  proceeds  of  recovery  charges  are deposited therein, and to the
 enforcement of security interests in recovery  property,  in  each  case
 subject to subdivision 2 of this section.
  2.  Insofar  as  the  provisions of this act are inconsistent with the
 provisions of any other law or part thereof  regarding  the  attachment,
 creation,  perfection,  the  effect  of  perfection, or priority of, and
 sale, assignment, or transfer of,  or  security  interest  in,  recovery
 property,  or  the  exercise  of  remedies  with  respect  thereto,  the
 provisions of this act shall be controlling.
  3. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to  conflict  with
 the provisions of subdivision 6 of section six of this act.
  §  8. Recovery bonds not public debt. Recovery bonds are not a debt or
 a general obligation of the state or any of its political  subdivisions,
 A. 10346--A  15
 
 agencies,  or instrumentalities and are not a charge on their full faith
 and credit.  An issue of recovery bonds shall not, directly or indirect-
 ly or contingently, obligate the state or any agency, political subdivi-
 sion, or instrumentality of the state to levy any tax or make any appro-
 priation  for  payment  of  the  bonds,  other  than for paying recovery
 charges in their capacity as consumers of  electricity.  All  recovery
 bonds  authorized by a financing order by the commission must contain on
 the face thereof a statement to the following effect: "Neither the  full
 faith  and  credit  nor  the  taxing  power  of the State of New York is
 pledged to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, this bond."
  § 9. State pledge. 1. The state pledges to and agrees with the holders
 of recovery bonds, any assignee and all financing parties that the state
 will not in any way take or permit any action  that  limits,  alters  or
 impairs the value of recovery property or, except as required by a true-
 up  mechanism  described in the financing order, reduce, alter or impair
 recovery charges that are imposed, collected and remitted for the  bene-
 fit  of  the  owners  of recovery bonds, any assignee, and all financing
 parties, until all principal, interest and redemption premium in respect
 of recovery bonds, all other financing costs and all amounts to be  paid
 to  an assignee or financing party under an ancillary agreement are paid
 or performed in full.
  2. Any person that issues recovery bonds shall be permitted to include
 the pledge specified in subdivision 1 of this section  on  the  face  of
 such  bonds  and  in  any  ancillary  agreements  or other documentation
 related to the issuance and marketing of such bonds.
  § 10. Assignee not a utility corporation.  An  assignee  or  financing
 party shall not be considered a utility corporation as defined in subdi-
 vision  24  of  section  2 of the public service law solely by virtue of
 engaging in any of the transactions described in this act.
  § 11. Effect of invalidity. If any  provision  of  this  act  is  held
 invalid  or  is  invalidated, superseded, replaced, repealed, or expires
 for any reason, such occurrence shall not affect  the  validity  of  any
 action  allowed  under  this  act  taken by a utility corporation, or an
 assignee, a financing party, a collection agent, or a party to an ancil-
 lary agreement. Any such action shall remain in full  force  and  effect
 with  respect  to all recovery bonds issued or authorized in a financing
 order issued pursuant to this act  on  or  before  the  date  that  such
 provision  is  held  invalid or is invalidated, superseded, replaced, or
 repealed, or expires for any reason.
  § 12. Effect of a financing order. Section 70 of  the  public  service
 law  shall not apply to: 1. Any sale, assignment or transfer of recovery
 property or any equity position held by the utility  corporation  in  an
 assignee; or
  2.  Any  other  transaction contemplated by or approved in a financing
 order issued by the commission pursuant to this act.
  § 13. This act shall take effect immediately.
