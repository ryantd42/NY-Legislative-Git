 STANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, THE VALIDITY OF ANY
 FINANCING ORDER OR OTHER DECISION MAY ONLY BE CHALLENGED BY AN AGGRIEVED
 A. 10346  9
 
 PARTY PURSUANT TO AN ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING FILED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS
 AFTER SUCH FINANCING ORDER BECOMES FINAL; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  ANY
 SUCH  ACTION,  SUIT  OR  PROCEEDING  AND  ALL SUPPORTING PAPERS SHALL BE
 COMMENCED DIRECTLY IN THE SUPREME COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, THIRD JUDI-
 CIAL DEPARTMENT.
  §  303.  RECOVERY  PROPERTY. 1. ALL RECOVERY PROPERTY SPECIFIED IN A
 FINANCING ORDER SHALL CONSTITUTE AN EXISTING,  PRESENT  PROPERTY  RIGHT.
 SUCH  PROPERTY SHALL EXIST WHETHER OR NOT THE REVENUES OR PROCEEDS ARIS-
 ING FROM THE PROPERTY HAVE BEEN  BILLED,  HAVE  ACCRUED,  OR  HAVE  BEEN
 COLLECTED.
  2.  RECOVERY PROPERTY SPECIFIED IN A FINANCING ORDER SHALL CONTINUE TO
 EXIST UNTIL THE RECOVERY BONDS ISSUED PURSUANT TO SUCH ORDER ARE PAID IN
 FULL AND ALL FINANCING COSTS OF THE BONDS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED IN FULL.
  3. ALL OR ANY PORTION OF RECOVERY PROPERTY SPECIFIED  IN  A  FINANCING
 ORDER  ISSUED  TO A UTILITY CORPORATION MAY BE SOLD, ASSIGNED, OR TRANS-
 FERRED TO A SUCCESSOR OR AN ASSIGNEE, INCLUDING AN AFFILIATE  OR  AFFIL-
 IATES  OF  THE UTILITY CORPORATION OR ANY OTHER ASSIGNEE CREATED FOR THE
 LIMITED PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING, OWNING, OR ADMINISTERING RECOVERY PROPERTY
 OR ISSUING RECOVERY BONDS UNDER THE FINANCING ORDER.  ALL OR ANY PORTION
 OF RECOVERY PROPERTY MAY BE ENCUMBERED BY A SECURITY INTEREST TO  SECURE
 RECOVERY  BONDS  ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE ORDER AND OTHER FINANCING COSTS.
 EACH SUCH SALE, ASSIGNMENT, TRANSFER, OR SECURITY INTEREST GRANTED BY  A
 UTILITY  CORPORATION  OR  AFFILIATE OF A UTILITY CORPORATION OR ASSIGNEE
 SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO BE A TRANSACTION IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF  BUSI-
 NESS.
  4.  THE  DESCRIPTION  OF  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  BEING SOLD, ASSIGNED, OR
 TRANSFERRED TO AN ASSIGNEE IN ANY SALE AGREEMENT, PURCHASE AGREEMENT, OR
 OTHER TRANSFER AGREEMENT OR CREATED AND RECOGNIZED  AS  PROPERTY  OF  AN
 ASSIGNEE  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  SUBDIVISION  NINE OF THIS SECTION, BEING
 ENCUMBERED TO A SECURED PARTY IN ANY SECURITY AGREEMENT,  PLEDGE  AGREE-
 MENT,  OR  OTHER SECURITY DOCUMENT, OR INDICATED IN ANY FINANCING STATE-
 MENT IS ONLY SUFFICIENT IF SUCH DESCRIPTION OR INDICATION REFERS TO  THE
 SPECIFIC  FINANCING  ORDER THAT CREATED THE RECOVERY PROPERTY AND STATES
 THAT SUCH AGREEMENT OR FINANCING STATEMENT COVERS ALL OR  PART  OF  SUCH
 RECOVERY  PROPERTY  DESCRIBED IN SUCH FINANCING ORDER.  A DESCRIPTION OF
 RECOVERY PROPERTY IN A FINANCING STATEMENT SHALL  BE  SUFFICIENT  IF  IT
 REFERS  TO  THE  FINANCING  ORDER CREATING THE RECOVERY PROPERTY.  THIS
 SUBDIVISION SHALL APPLY TO ALL PURPORTED SALES, ASSIGNMENTS,  OR  TRANS-
 FERS  OF,  AND  ALL  PURPORTED  LIENS OR SECURITY INTERESTS IN, RECOVERY
 PROPERTY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE  RELATED  SALE  AGREEMENT,  PURCHASE
 AGREEMENT,  OTHER  TRANSFER AGREEMENT, SECURITY AGREEMENT, PLEDGE AGREE-
 MENT, OR OTHER SECURITY DOCUMENT WAS  ENTERED  INTO,  OR  ANY  FINANCING
 STATEMENT WAS FILED, BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ARTICLE.
  5.  EVERY  ELECTRIC  BILL  ISSUED  BY  A  UTILITY CORPORATION THAT HAS
 OBTAINED A FINANCING ORDER AND CAUSED RECOVERY BONDS TO BE ISSUED  SHALL
 COMPLY  WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
 THE FAILURE OF A UTILITY CORPORATION TO  COMPLY  WITH  THIS  SUBDIVISION
 SHALL  NOT  INVALIDATE,  IMPAIR, OR AFFECT ANY FINANCING ORDER, RECOVERY
 PROPERTY, RECOVERY CHARGE, OR RECOVERY BONDS.  EVERY SUCH BILL SHALL:
  (A) EXPLICITLY REFLECT THAT A PORTION OF  THE  CHARGES  ON  SUCH  BILL
 REPRESENTS  RECOVERY CHARGES APPROVED IN A FINANCING ORDER ISSUED TO THE
 UTILITY CORPORATION AND, IF THE RECOVERY PROPERTY HAS  BEEN  TRANSFERRED
 TO,  OR  CREATED AT, AN ASSIGNEE, MUST INCLUDE A STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT
 THAT THE ASSIGNEE IS THE OWNER OF THE RIGHTS  TO  RECOVERY  CHARGES  AND
 THAT  THE  UTILITY CORPORATION OR OTHER ENTITY, IF APPLICABLE, IS ACTING
 AS A COLLECTION AGENT OR SERVICER FOR THAT ASSIGNEE.  THE TARIFF  APPLI-
 A. 10346  10
 
 CABLE  TO  CONSUMERS MUST INDICATE THE RECOVERY CHARGE AND THE OWNERSHIP
 OF THE CHARGE.
  (B)  INCLUDE THE RECOVERY CHARGE ON EACH CONSUMER'S BILL AS A SEPARATE
 LINE ITEM AND INCLUDE EITHER THE RATE OR THE AMOUNT  OF  THE  CHARGE  ON
 EACH BILL.
  6. IF A UTILITY CORPORATION DEFAULTS ON ANY REQUIRED PAYMENT OF CHARG-
 ES  ARISING  FROM  RECOVERY PROPERTY SPECIFIED IN A FINANCING ORDER, THE
 SUPREME COURT, ALBANY COUNTY, UPON PETITION BY AN INTERESTED PARTY,  AND
 WITHOUT  LIMITING  ANY  OTHER  REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO THE APPLYING PARTY,
 SHALL ORDER THE SEQUESTRATION AND PAYMENT OF THE REVENUES  ARISING  FROM
 THE RECOVERY PROPERTY TO THE FINANCING PARTIES OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.
 ANY SUCH ORDER SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
 REORGANIZATION, BANKRUPTCY, OR OTHER INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT
 TO THE UTILITY CORPORATION OR ITS SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNEES.
  7.  THE  INTEREST OF AN ASSIGNEE OR SECURED PARTY IN RECOVERY PROPERTY
 SPECIFIED IN A FINANCING ORDER SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO SETOFF,  COUNTER-
 CLAIM,  SURCHARGE,  OR  DEFENSE  BY THE UTILITY CORPORATION OR ANY OTHER
 PERSON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE REORGANIZATION, BANKRUPTCY,  OR  OTHER
 INSOLVENCY OF THE UTILITY CORPORATION OR ANY OTHER ENTITY.
  8.  ANY  SUCCESSOR  TO  A UTILITY CORPORATION, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ANY
 REORGANIZATION, BANKRUPTCY, OR OTHER INSOLVENCY  PROCEEDING  OR  WHETHER
 PURSUANT  TO ANY MERGER OR ACQUISITION, SALE, OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINA-
 TION, OR TRANSFER BY OPERATION OF LAW, AS A  RESULT  OF  UTILITY  CORPO-
 RATION  RESTRUCTURING  OR OTHERWISE, SHALL PERFORM AND SATISFY ALL OBLI-
 GATIONS OF, AND HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS UNDER  A  FINANCING  ORDER  AS  THE
 UTILITY  CORPORATION UNDER THE FINANCING ORDER IN THE SAME MANNER AND TO
 THE SAME EXTENT AS THE UTILITY  CORPORATION,  INCLUDING  COLLECTION  AND
 PAYMENT  OF  ANY  REVENUES  AND PROCEEDS OF THE RECOVERY PROPERTY TO ANY
 PERSON ENTITLED THERETO.
  9. UPON PETITION BY THE UTILITY CORPORATION, RECOVERY PROPERTY MAY  BE
 IMMEDIATELY CREATED BY OPERATION OF LAW ON THE LATTER OF THE ISSUANCE OF
 A FINANCING ORDER, OR THE ISSUANCE OF THE RECOVERY BONDS BY AN ASSIGNEE.
 RECOVERY  PROPERTY  CREATED  IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL,
 UPON CREATION, BELONG TO THE ASSIGNEE AND SUCH ASSIGNEE  WILL  HAVE  THE
 SAME  RIGHTS  TO  AND  BENEFITS ARISING FROM THE RECOVERY PROPERTY AS IT
 WOULD HAVE IF IT ACQUIRED SUCH  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  AS  A  RESULT  OF  A
 PURCHASE, ACQUISITION OR OTHER TRANSFER FROM THE UTILITY CORPORATION.
  §  304.  SALE,  ASSIGNMENT,  OR TRANSFER OF RECOVERY PROPERTY.  1. THE
 SALE, ASSIGNMENT, OR OTHER TRANSFER OF RECOVERY PROPERTY  BY  A  UTILITY
 CORPORATION  TO  AN  ASSIGNEE  THAT  THE  PARTIES  HAVE IN THE GOVERNING
 CONTRACT EXPRESSLY STATED TO BE A SALE OR OTHER ABSOLUTE TRANSFER  SHALL
 CONSTITUTE  AN  ABSOLUTE  TRANSFER  AND TRUE SALE OF, AND NOT A SECURITY
 INTEREST IN, THE TRANSFEROR'S RIGHT, TITLE, AND  INTEREST  IN,  TO,  AND
 UNDER  SUCH  RECOVERY  PROPERTY, OTHER THAN FOR FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME
 TAX PURPOSES.  THE PARTIES' CHARACTERIZATION OF SUCH  TRANSACTION  AS  A
 SALE  OF  AN  INTEREST IN RECOVERY PROPERTY SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE THAT THE
 TRANSACTION IS A TRUE SALE AND THAT OWNERSHIP HAS PASSED  TO  THE  PARTY
 CHARACTERIZED  AS THE PURCHASER, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PURCHASER HAS
 POSSESSION OF ANY DOCUMENTS EVIDENCING OR PERTAINING  TO  THE  INTEREST.
 AFTER  ANY  SUCH TRANSACTION, THE RECOVERY PROPERTY SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT
 TO ANY CLAIMS OF THE TRANSFEROR OR  THE  TRANSFEROR'S  CREDITORS,  OTHER
 THAN CREDITORS HOLDING A PRIOR SECURITY INTEREST IN THE RECOVERY PROPER-
 TY PERFECTED UNDER SECTION THREE HUNDRED SEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE.
  2.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, THE CHARAC-
 TERIZATION OF ANY SALE, ASSIGNMENT, OR OTHER TRANSFER AS A TRUE SALE  OR
 OTHER  ABSOLUTE TRANSFER PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION AND
 A. 10346  11
 
 THE CORRESPONDING CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ASSIGNEE'S  PROPERTY  INTEREST
 SHALL  BE DETERMINATIVE AND CONCLUSIVE IRRESPECTIVE OF, AND NOT AFFECTED
 OR IMPAIRED BY, THE EXISTENCE OF ANY OR ALL  OF  THE  FOLLOWING  CIRCUM-
 STANCES:
  (A)  COMMINGLING OF AMOUNTS ARISING WITH RESPECT TO THE RECOVERY PROP-
 ERTY WITH OTHER AMOUNTS;
  (B) THE RETENTION BY THE TRANSFEROR OF A PARTIAL OR RESIDUAL INTEREST,
 INCLUDING AN EQUITY INTEREST OR  ENTITLEMENT  TO  ANY  SURPLUS,  IN  THE
 RECOVERY PROPERTY, WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT, OR WHETHER SUBORDINATE OR
 OTHERWISE;
  (C)  ANY  RECOURSE  THAT THE ASSIGNEE MAY HAVE AGAINST THE TRANSFEROR,
 EXCEPT THAT ANY SUCH RECOURSE SHALL NOT BE CREATED, CONTINGENT UPON,  OR
 OTHERWISE OCCURRING OR RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OR FAILURE OF ONE OR
 MORE OF THE TRANSFEROR'S CONSUMERS TO TIMELY PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE
 RECOVERY CHARGE;
  (D)  ANY  INDEMNIFICATIONS,  OBLIGATIONS, OR REPURCHASE RIGHTS MADE OR
 PROVIDED BY THE TRANSFEROR, EXCEPT THAT  SUCH  INDEMNITY  OR  REPURCHASE
 RIGHTS  SHALL  NOT  BE  BASED  SOLELY UPON THE INABILITY OR FAILURE OF A
 TRANSFEROR'S CONSUMERS TO TIMELY PAY ALL OR A PORTION  OF  THE  RECOVERY
 CHARGE;
  (E)  THE TRANSFEROR ACTING AS THE COLLECTOR OF THE RECOVERY CHARGES OR
 THE EXISTENCE OF ANY CONTRACT DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (K) OF  SUBDIVISION
 FIVE OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE;
  (F)  THE CONTRARY OR OTHER TREATMENT OF THE SALE, ASSIGNMENT, OR OTHER
 TRANSFER FOR TAX, FINANCIAL REPORTING, OR OTHER PURPOSES;
  (G) THE GRANTING OR PROVIDING TO HOLDERS OF THE RECOVERY  BONDS  OF  A
 PREFERRED  RIGHT  TO  THE RECOVERY PROPERTY OR CREDIT ENHANCEMENT BY THE
 UTILITY CORPORATION OR ITS  AFFILIATES  WITH  RESPECT  TO  THE  RECOVERY
 BONDS; OR
  (H)  THE  STATUS  OF THE ASSIGNEE AS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED
 SUBSIDIARY OR OTHER AFFILIATE OF THE UTILITY CORPORATION.  THE  SEPARATE
 JURIDICAL  PERSONALITY  OF  ANY ASSIGNEE OF RECOVERY PROPERTY WHICH IS A
 SUBSIDIARY OR AFFILIATE OF THE UTILITY CORPORATION SHALL NOT  BE  DISRE-
 GARDED  DUE  TO  THE  FACT THAT THE ASSIGNEE AND THE UTILITY CORPORATION
 SHARE ANY ONE OR MORE INCIDENTS OF CONTROL, INCLUDING  COMMON  MANAGERS,
 OFFICERS,  DIRECTORS,  MEMBERS,  ACCOUNTING  OR  ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS,
 CONSOLIDATED TAX RETURNS, OR OFFICE SPACE, THAT THE ASSIGNEE  MAY  BE  A
 DISREGARDED  ENTITY  FOR  TAX  PURPOSES,  THAT  THE ELECTRIC CORPORATION
 CAUSED THE FORMATION OF THE ASSIGNEE, THAT A  CONTRACT  BY  THE  UTILITY
 CORPORATION  AND  THE ASSIGNEE DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (K) OF SUBDIVISION
 FIVE OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED TWO  OF  THIS  ARTICLE  EXISTS,  THAT  THE
 ASSIGNEE  HAS  NO  OTHER  BUSINESS OTHER THAN PERTAINING TO THE RECOVERY
 PROPERTY, THAT THE CAPITALIZATION OF THE ASSIGNEE IS LIMITED TO  AMOUNTS
 REQUIRED  FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN APPLICABLE FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS
 AND REVENUE PROCEDURES, OR THAT OTHER FACTORS USED IN APPLYING A  SINGLE
 BUSINESS ENTERPRISE TEST TO JURIDICAL PERSONS ARE PRESENT.
  3.  ANY  RIGHT THAT A UTILITY CORPORATION HAS IN THE RECOVERY PROPERTY
 PRIOR TO ITS SALE, ASSIGNMENT, OR TRANSFER SHALL BE IN  THE  FORM  OF  A
 CONTRACTUAL RIGHT OR CHOSE IN ACTION NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY TREAT-
 MENT THEREOF FOR ACCOUNTING OR TAX PURPOSES.  THE OWNERSHIP OF AN INTER-
 EST  IN  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  IS  VOLUNTARILY  TRANSFERRED  BY A CONTRACT
 BETWEEN THE OWNER AND THE ASSIGNEE THAT PURPORTS TO TRANSFER THE  OWNER-
 SHIP  OF  THAT  INTEREST.  UNLESS  OTHERWISE PROVIDED, THE TRANSFER OF
 OWNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AS  SOON  AS  THERE  IS
 WRITTEN  AGREEMENT ON THE INTEREST, THE PURCHASE PRICE IS FIXED, AND THE
 FINANCING ORDER HAS BEEN ISSUED.  SUCH TRANSFER SHALL BE  PERFECTED  AND
 A. 10346  12
 
 TAKE  EFFECT  AGAINST  ALL  THIRD PARTIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 SUBSEQUENT LIEN CREDITORS WHEN THE TRANSFER HAS BECOME EFFECTIVE BETWEEN
 THE PARTIES AND WHEN A FINANCING STATEMENT GIVING NOTICE  OF  THE  SALE,
 ASSIGNMENT,  OR TRANSFER IS FILED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBDIVISION FOUR OF
 THIS SECTION.  DELIVERY OF SUCH AN INTEREST IN RECOVERY  PROPERTY  SHALL
 TAKE  PLACE  BY OPERATION OF LAW UPON THE FILING OF THE FINANCING STATE-
 MENT.
  4. FINANCING STATEMENTS REQUIRED TO BE FILED UNDER THIS SECTION  SHALL
 BE  FILED,  INDEXED, MAINTAINED, AND CONTINUED IN THE SAME MANNER AND IN
 THE SAME SYSTEM OF RECORDS MAINTAINED FOR THE FILING OF FINANCING STATE-
 MENTS UNDER ARTICLE NINE OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.  THE FILING  OF
 SUCH  FINANCING STATEMENT SHALL BE THE ONLY METHOD OF PERFECTING A SALE,
 ASSIGNMENT, OR TRANSFER OF RECOVERY PROPERTY.  THE SALE, ASSIGNMENT,  OR
 TRANSFER  OF  AN  INTEREST  IN  RECOVERY  PROPERTY PERFECTED BY FILING A
 FINANCING STATEMENT SHALL  BE  EFFECTIVE  AGAINST  ANY  CONSUMERS  OWING
 PAYMENT OF THE RECOVERY CHARGES, CREDITORS OF THE TRANSFEROR, SUBSEQUENT
 TRANSFEREES,  AND ALL OTHER THIRD PERSONS NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABSENCE OF
 ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF OR NOTICE TO SUCH CONSUMERS OF  SUCH  SALE,  ASSIGN-
 MENT, OR TRANSFER.
  5. THE PRIORITY OF THE CONFLICTING OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF ASSIGNEES IN
 THE SAME INTEREST OR RIGHTS IN ANY RECOVERY PROPERTY SHALL BE DETERMINED
 AS FOLLOWS:
  (A)  CONFLICTING  PERFECTED  INTERESTS  OR  RIGHTS  OF  ASSIGNEES RANK
 ACCORDING TO PRIORITY IN TIME OF PERFECTION.
  (B) A PERFECTED INTEREST OR RIGHT OF AN ASSIGNEE HAS PRIORITY  OVER  A
 CONFLICTING UNPERFECTED INTEREST OR RIGHT OF AN ASSIGNEE.
  (C)  A  PERFECTED INTEREST OR RIGHT OF AN ASSIGNEE HAS PRIORITY OVER A
 PERSON WHO  BECOMES  A  LIEN  CREDITOR  AFTER  THE  PERFECTION  OF  SUCH
 ASSIGNEE'S INTEREST OR RIGHT.
  6.  THE  PRIORITY  OF  A SALE, ASSIGNMENT, OR TRANSFER PERFECTED UNDER
 THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE IMPAIRED BY  ANY  LATER  MODIFICATION  OF  THE
 FINANCING  ORDER  OR  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  OR BY THE COMMINGLING OF FUNDS
 ARISING FROM RECOVERY PROPERTY WITH OTHER FUNDS.  ANY  OTHER  SECURITY
 INTEREST  THAT  MAY  APPLY TO SUCH FUNDS, OTHER THAN A SECURITY INTEREST
 PERFECTED UNDER SECTION THREE HUNDRED FIVE OF  THIS  ARTICLE,  SHALL  BE
 TERMINATED  WHEN THOSE FUNDS ARE TRANSFERRED TO A SEGREGATED ACCOUNT FOR
 THE ASSIGNEE OR A FINANCING PARTY.  IF RECOVERY PROPERTY HAS BEEN TRANS-
 FERRED TO AN ASSIGNEE OR FINANCING PARTY, ANY PROCEEDS OF SUCH  PROPERTY
 SHALL  BE  HELD  FOR AND DELIVERED TO THE ASSIGNEE OR FINANCING PARTY BY
 ANY COLLECTOR UNDER ANY CONTRACT DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (K) OF  SUBDIVI-
 SION  FIVE  OF  SECTION THREE HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE AS A MANDATARY
 AND FIDUCIARY.
  § 305. SECURITY INTERESTS. 1. THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE  NINE  OF  THE
 UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE RELATING TO SECURED TRANSACTIONS SHALL NOT APPLY
 TO  RECOVERY  PROPERTY OR ANY RIGHT, TITLE, OR INTEREST OF A CORPORATION
 OR ASSIGNEE THEREIN, WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE ISSUANCE OF A FINANCING
 ORDER, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF  SECTION  THREE  HUNDRED
 SIX  OF  THIS  ARTICLE.  IN  ADDITION,  SUCH RIGHT, TITLE, OR INTEREST
 PERTAINING TO A FINANCING ORDER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ASSO-
 CIATED RECOVERY PROPERTY, AND ANY REVENUES, COLLECTIONS, CLAIMS,  RIGHTS
 TO  PAYMENT,  PAYMENTS,  MONEY,  OR PROCEEDS OF OR ARISING FROM RECOVERY
 CHARGES PURSUANT TO SUCH ORDER, SHALL NOT  BE  DEEMED  PROCEEDS  OF  ANY
 RIGHT  OR  INTEREST  OTHER  THAN OF THE FINANCING ORDER AND THE RECOVERY
 PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE FINANCING ORDER.  ALL REVENUES AND COLLECTIONS
 RESULTING FROM RECOVERY PROPERTY SHALL CONSTITUTE PROCEEDS ONLY  OF  THE
 RECOVERY PROPERTY ARISING FROM THE FINANCING ORDER.
 A. 10346  13
 
  2.  EXCEPT  TO  THE  EXTENT  PROVIDED  IN THIS ARTICLE WITH RESPECT TO
 FILINGS OF FINANCING  STATEMENTS  OR  CONTROL  OF  DEPOSIT  ACCOUNTS  OR
 INVESTMENT  PROPERTY  AS  ORIGINAL COLLATERAL, THE CREATION, ATTACHMENT,
 GRANTING, PERFECTION, AND PRIORITY OF  SECURITY  INTERESTS  IN  RECOVERY
 PROPERTY TO SECURE RECOVERY BONDS SHALL BE GOVERNED SOLELY BY THIS ARTI-
 CLE AND NOT BY THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.
  3. (A) A SECURITY INTEREST IN RECOVERY PROPERTY IS VALID AND ENFORCEA-
 BLE AGAINST THE UTILITY CORPORATION AND ITS SUCCESSOR OR AN ASSIGNEE AND
 THIRD  PARTIES  AND  ATTACHES TO RECOVERY PROPERTY ONLY AFTER ALL OF THE
 FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET:
  (I) THE ISSUANCE OF A FINANCING ORDER;
  (II) THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF A SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH A FINANC-
 ING PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF RECOVERY BONDS; AND
  (III) THE RECEIPT OF VALUE FOR THE RECOVERY BONDS.
  (B) A SECURITY INTEREST ATTACHES TO RECOVERY PROPERTY WITHOUT PHYSICAL
 DELIVERY OF COLLATERAL OR OTHER ACT WHEN ALL OF THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS
 HAVE BEEN MET, UNLESS THE SECURITY  AGREEMENT  EXPRESSLY  POSTPONES  THE
 TIME OF ATTACHMENT.
  4.  A  SECURITY  INTEREST IN RECOVERY PROPERTY IS PERFECTED ONLY IF IT
 HAS ATTACHED AND A FINANCING STATEMENT INDICATING THE RECOVERY  PROPERTY
 COLLATERAL  COVERED  THEREBY HAS BEEN FILED.  A FINANCING STATEMENT MUST
 BE FILED TO PERFECT ALL SECURITY INTERESTS AND LIENS IN  STORM  RECOVERY
 PROPERTY  UNDER  THIS ARTICLE.  A SECURITY INTEREST IN RECOVERY PROPERTY
 IS PERFECTED WHEN IT HAS ATTACHED  AND  WHEN  THE  APPLICABLE  FINANCING
 STATEMENT  HAS  BEEN  FILED.  THE  INTEREST  OF A SECURED PARTY IS NOT
 PERFECTED UNLESS A FINANCING STATEMENT SUFFICIENT UNDER THIS ARTICLE AND
 OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE IS  FILED,  AND
 AFTER  PERFECTION THE SECURED PARTY'S INTEREST CONTINUES IN THE RECOVERY
 PROPERTY AND ALL PROCEEDS OF SUCH  RECOVERY  PROPERTY,  WHETHER  OR  NOT
 BILLED,  ACCRUED,  OR  COLLECTED,  AND  WHETHER  OR NOT DEPOSITED INTO A
 DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AND HOWEVER EVIDENCED.  A SECURITY INTEREST IN  PROCEEDS
 OF  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  IS A PERFECTED SECURITY INTEREST IF THE SECURITY
 INTEREST IN THE RECOVERY PROPERTY  WAS  PERFECTED  UNDER  THIS  ARTICLE.
 FINANCING STATEMENTS REQUIRED TO BE FILED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE SHALL
 BE  FILED,  INDEXED, MAINTAINED, AND CONTINUED IN THE SAME MANNER AND IN
 THE SAME SYSTEM OF RECORDS MAINTAINED FOR THE FILING OF FINANCING STATE-
 MENTS UNDER THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, EXCEPT THAT THE REQUIREMENT  AS
 TO CONTINUATION STATEMENTS DOES NOT APPLY.  THE FILING OF SUCH A FINANC-
 ING  STATEMENT SHALL BE THE ONLY METHOD OF PERFECTING A LIEN OR SECURITY
 INTEREST ON RECOVERY PROPERTY.  THE FINANCING STATEMENT SHALL  BE  FILED
 AS IF THE DEBTOR NAMED THEREIN WERE LOCATED IN THIS STATE.
  5.  THE  PRIORITY  OF  THE  CONFLICTING  SECURITY INTERESTS OF SECURED
 PARTIES IN THE SAME INTEREST OR  RIGHTS  IN  ANY  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  IS
 DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS:
  (A)  CONFLICTING  PERFECTED SECURITY INTERESTS OF SECURED PARTIES RANK
 ACCORDING TO PRIORITY IN TIME OF PERFECTION;
  (B) A PERFECTED SECURITY INTEREST OF A SECURED PARTY HAS PRIORITY OVER
 A CONFLICTING UNPERFECTED SECURITY INTEREST OF A SECURED PARTY; AND
  (C) A PERFECTED SECURITY INTEREST OF A SECURED PARTY HAS PRIORITY OVER
 A PERSON WHO BECOMES A  LIEN  CREDITOR  AFTER  THE  PERFECTION  OF  SUCH
 SECURED PARTY'S SECURITY INTEREST.
  6. A PERFECTED SECURITY INTEREST IN RECOVERY PROPERTY AND ALL PROCEEDS
 OF SUCH RECOVERY PROPERTY, WHETHER OR NOT BILLED, ACCRUED, OR COLLECTED,
 AND  WHETHER  OR  NOT  DEPOSITED  INTO  A  DEPOSIT  ACCOUNT  AND HOWEVER
 EVIDENCED, SHALL HAVE PRIORITY OVER A CONFLICTING LIEN OR  PRIVILEGE  OF
 ANY  NATURE  IN THE SAME COLLATERAL PROPERTY, EXCEPT A SECURITY INTEREST
 A. 10346  14
 
 IS SUBORDINATE TO THE RIGHTS OF A PERSON THAT BECOMES  A  LIEN  CREDITOR
 BEFORE THE PERFECTION OF SUCH SECURITY INTEREST.  A SECURITY INTEREST IN
 RECOVERY  PROPERTY WHICH QUALIFIES FOR PRIORITY OVER A CONFLICTING SECU-
 RITY INTEREST, LIEN, OR PRIVILEGE ALSO HAS PRIORITY OVER THE CONFLICTING
 SECURITY  INTEREST, LIEN, OR PRIVILEGE IN PROCEEDS OF THE RECOVERY PROP-
 ERTY.  THE RELATIVE PRIORITY OF A  PERFECTED  SECURITY  INTEREST  OF  A
 SECURED PARTY IS NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY LIEN, PRIVILEGE, OR SECU-
 RITY  INTEREST IN A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT OF THE UTILITY CORPORATION THAT IS A
 COLLECTOR AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (K) OF SUBDIVISION FIVE  OF  SECTION
 THREE HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE AND INTO WHICH THE REVENUES ARE DEPOS-
 ITED.  THE  PRIORITY OF A SECURITY INTEREST PERFECTED UNDER THIS SECTION
 SHALL NOT BE DEFEATED OR IMPAIRED  BY  ANY  LATER  MODIFICATION  OF  THE
 FINANCING  ORDER  OR  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  OR BY THE COMMINGLING OF FUNDS
 ARISING FROM RECOVERY PROPERTY WITH OTHER FUNDS.  ANY  OTHER  SECURITY
 INTEREST  THAT  MAY  APPLY  TO THOSE FUNDS SHALL BE TERMINATED AS TO ALL
 FUNDS TRANSFERRED TO A SEGREGATED ACCOUNT FOR THE BENEFIT OF AN ASSIGNEE
 OR A FINANCING PARTY OR TO AN ASSIGNEE OR FINANCING PARTY DIRECTLY.  THE
 PERFECTION  BY  CONTROL,  THE  EFFECT  OF PERFECTION BY CONTROL, AND THE
 PRIORITY OF A SECURITY INTEREST GRANTED BY THE ISSUER  OF  AND  SECURING
 RECOVERY  BONDS  HELD  BY A SECURED PARTY HAVING CONTROL OF A SEGREGATED
 DEPOSIT ACCOUNT OR SECURITIES ACCOUNT AS ORIGINAL COLLATERAL INTO  WHICH
 REVENUES, COLLECTIONS, OR PROCEEDS OF RECOVERY PROPERTY ARE DEPOSITED OR
 CREDITED SHALL BE GOVERNED BY SECTION 1-301 OF UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.
  7.  IF  A  DEFAULT  OCCURS  UNDER  THE TERMS OF ANY RECOVERY BOND, THE
 SECURED PARTY MAY FORECLOSE ON OR OTHERWISE ENFORCE THE SECURITY  INTER-
 EST  IN  ANY  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  AS IF IT WAS A SECURED PARTY UNDER THE
 UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. A SECURED PARTY HOLDING A SECURITY INTEREST  IN
 RECOVERY  PROPERTY  SHALL BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE ALL OF THE SAME RIGHTS
 AND REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A SECURED PARTY UNDER THE  UNIFORM  COMMERCIAL
 CODE,  TO THE SAME EXTENT AS IF THOSE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES WERE SET FORTH
 IN THIS ARTICLE.  THE COURT MAY ORDER THAT AMOUNTS ARISING FROM RECOVERY
 PROPERTY BE TRANSFERRED TO A SEPARATE ACCOUNT OF THE SECURED  PARTY  FOR
 THE  FINANCING  PARTIES' BENEFIT, TO WHICH THEIR SECURITY INTEREST SHALL
 APPLY.  ON PETITION BY OR ON BEHALF OF A SECURED PARTY, THE COURT  SHALL
 ORDER THE SEQUESTRATION AND PAYMENT TO THE FINANCING PARTIES OF REVENUES
 ARISING FROM THE RECOVERY PROPERTY.
  8.  A  SECURITY  INTEREST CREATED UNDER THIS SECTION MAY PROVIDE FOR A
 SECURITY INTEREST IN AFTER-ACQUIRED COLLATERAL.  SUCH SECURITY  INTEREST
 SHALL  NOT BE INVALID OR FRAUDULENT AGAINST CREDITORS SOLELY BECAUSE THE
 GRANTOR OR THE UTILITY CORPORATION AS  COLLECTOR  OR  SERVICER  HAS  THE
 RIGHT  OR  ABILITY  TO COMMINGLE THE COLLATERAL OR PROCEEDS, OR COLLECT,
 COMPROMISE, ENFORCE, AND OTHERWISE DEAL WITH COLLATERAL.
  9. ANY ACTION ARISING UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE TO  ENFORCE
 A  SECURITY INTEREST IN RECOVERY PROPERTY, OR WHICH OTHERWISE ASSERTS AN
 INTEREST IN, OR A RIGHT IN, TO OR AGAINST ANY RECOVERY PROPERTY, WHEREV-
 ER LOCATED OR DEEMED LOCATED, OR ANY SECURITY INTEREST GOVERNED BY  THIS
 ARTICLE,  SHALL  BE  BROUGHT  IN  THE SUPREME COURT, ALBANY COUNTY. SUCH
 ACTIONS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE  APPLICABLE  PROVISIONS  OF  THE  CIVIL
 PRACTICE  LAW  AND  RULES  AND  OTHER  LAW  APPLICABLE  TO  EXECUTORY
 PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING PROVISIONAL REMEDIES, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SUCH
 LAWS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE LANGUAGE AND PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE.
  § 306. CHOICE OF LAW; CONFLICTS. 1. THE LAW  GOVERNING  THE  VALIDITY,
 ENFORCEABILITY,  ATTACHMENT, PERFECTION, PRIORITY, EXERCISE OF REMEDIES,
 AND VENUE WITH RESPECT TO THE CREATION, RECOGNITION,  SALE,  ASSIGNMENT,
 OR TRANSFER OF AN INTEREST OR RIGHT OR THE CREATION OF A SECURITY INTER-
 EST  IN  ANY  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  SHALL  BE EXCLUSIVELY THE LAWS OF THIS
 A. 10346  15
 
 STATE, WITHOUT APPLYING  THIS  STATE'S  LAW  ON  CONFLICT  OF  LAWS  AND
 NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  CONTRARY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED
 IN SUBDIVISION SIX OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED FIVE OF  THIS  ARTICLE.  THE
 VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY, ATTACHMENT, PERFECTION, PRIORITY, AND EXERCISE
 OF REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO THE CREATION, RECOGNITION, SALE, ASSIGNMENT,
 OR TRANSFER OF AN INTEREST OR RIGHT OR THE CREATION OF A SECURITY INTER-
 EST  IN  ANY  RECOVERY  PROPERTY  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THIS ARTICLE, AND
 SOLELY TO THE EXTENT NOT ADDRESSED  BY  THIS  ARTICLE,  BY  THE  UNIFORM
 COMMERCIAL  CODE  AND  OTHER  LAWS  OF  THIS  STATE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
 PRECEDING SENTENCE, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES THAT  THE  UNIFORM  COMMERCIAL
 CODE  APPLIES  TO THE FILINGS OF FINANCING STATEMENTS REFERENCED IN THIS
 ARTICLE, TO PERFECTION, THE EFFECT OF PERFECTION OR  NONPERFECTION,  AND
 THE  PRIORITY  OF  SECURITY  INTERESTS  HELD  BY  A SECURED PARTY HAVING
 CONTROL OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS OR SECURITIES ACCOUNTS AS  ORIGINAL  COLLAT-
 ERAL  SECURING RECOVERY BONDS, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT PROCEEDS OF RECOVERY
 CHARGES ARE DEPOSITED THEREIN, AND TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF SECURITY INTER-
 ESTS IN RECOVERY PROPERTY, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO  SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF
 THIS SECTION.
  2. INSOFAR AS THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  ANY  OTHER LAW OR PART THEREOF REGARDING THE ATTACHMENT,
 CREATION, PERFECTION, THE EFFECT OF  PERFECTION,  OR  PRIORITY  OF,  AND
 SALE,  ASSIGNMENT,  OR  TRANSFER  OF,  OR SECURITY INTEREST IN, RECOVERY
 PROPERTY,  OR  THE  EXERCISE  OF  REMEDIES  WITH  RESPECT  THERETO,  THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE CONTROLLING.
  3.  NOTHING  IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED SO AS TO CONFLICT WITH
 THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION SIX OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED FIVE OF  THIS
 ARTICLE.
  §  307.  RECOVERY BONDS NOT PUBLIC DEBT. RECOVERY BONDS ARE NOT A DEBT
 OR A GENERAL OBLIGATION OF THE STATE OR ANY OF  ITS  POLITICAL  SUBDIVI-
 SIONS, AGENCIES, OR INSTRUMENTALITIES AND ARE NOT A CHARGE ON THEIR FULL
 FAITH  AND  CREDIT.  AN ISSUE OF RECOVERY BONDS SHALL NOT, DIRECTLY OR
 INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENTLY, OBLIGATE THE STATE OR ANY AGENCY,  POLITICAL
 SUBDIVISION, OR INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE STATE TO LEVY ANY TAX OR MAKE ANY
 APPROPRIATION  FOR  PAYMENT OF THE BONDS, OTHER THAN FOR PAYING RECOVERY
 CHARGES IN THEIR CAPACITY AS CONSUMERS OF  ELECTRICITY.  ALL  RECOVERY
 BONDS  AUTHORIZED BY A FINANCING ORDER BY THE COMMISSION MUST CONTAIN ON
 THE FACE THEREOF A STATEMENT TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT: "NEITHER THE  FULL
 FAITH  AND  CREDIT  NOR  THE  TAXING  POWER  OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS
 PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF, OR INTEREST ON, THIS BOND."
  § 308. STATE PLEDGE. 1. THE STATE PLEDGES TO AND AGREES WITH THE HOLD-
 ERS OF RECOVERY BONDS, ANY ASSIGNEE AND ALL FINANCING PARTIES  THAT  THE
 STATE  WILL NOT IN ANY WAY TAKE OR PERMIT ANY ACTION THAT LIMITS, ALTERS
 OR IMPAIRS THE VALUE OF RECOVERY PROPERTY OR, EXCEPT AS  REQUIRED  BY  A
 TRUE-UP  MECHANISM  DESCRIBED  IN  THE FINANCING ORDER, REDUCE, ALTER OR
 IMPAIR RECOVERY CHARGES THAT ARE IMPOSED, COLLECTED AND REMITTED FOR THE
 BENEFIT OF THE OWNERS OF RECOVERY BONDS, ANY ASSIGNEE, AND ALL FINANCING
 PARTIES, UNTIL ALL PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND REDEMPTION PREMIUM IN RESPECT
 OF RECOVERY BONDS, ALL OTHER FINANCING COSTS AND ALL AMOUNTS TO BE  PAID
 TO  AN ASSIGNEE OR FINANCING PARTY UNDER AN ANCILLARY AGREEMENT ARE PAID
 OR PERFORMED IN FULL.
  2. ANY PERSON THAT ISSUES RECOVERY BONDS SHALL BE PERMITTED TO INCLUDE
 THE PLEDGE SPECIFIED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION ON THE  FACE  OF
 SUCH  BONDS  AND  IN  ANY  ANCILLARY  AGREEMENTS  OR OTHER DOCUMENTATION
 RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE AND MARKETING OF SUCH BONDS.

 PARTY SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED A UTILITY CORPORATION AS DEFINED IN SUBDI-

 VISION  TWENTY-FOUR  OF  SECTION TWO OF THIS CHAPTER SOLELY BY VIRTUE OF
 ENGAGING IN ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS ARTICLE.
  §  310. EFFECT OF INVALIDITY. IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE IS HELD
 INVALID OR IS INVALIDATED, SUPERSEDED, REPLACED REPEALED, OR EXPIRES FOR
 ANY REASON, SUCH OCCURRENCE SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF ANY  ACTION
 ALLOWED  UNDER THIS ARTICLE TAKEN BY A UTILITY CORPORATION, OR AN ASSIG-
 NEE, A FINANCING PARTY, A COLLECTION AGENT, OR A PARTY TO  AN  ANCILLARY
 AGREEMENT.  ANY  SUCH  ACTION SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT WITH
 RESPECT TO ALL RECOVERY BONDS ISSUED OR AUTHORIZED IN A FINANCING  ORDER
 ISSUED  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  ARTICLE  ON  OR  BEFORE  THE  DATE THAT SUCH
 PROVISION IS HELD INVALID OR IS INVALIDATED,  SUPERSEDED,  REPLACED,  OR
 REPEALED, OR EXPIRES FOR ANY REASON.

 SHALL NOT APPLY TO: 1. ANY SALE,  ASSIGNMENT  OR  TRANSFER  OF  RECOVERY
 PROPERTY  OR  ANY  EQUITY POSITION HELD BY THE UTILITY CORPORATION IN AN
