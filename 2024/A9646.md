  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY: This proposed legislation would allow current and future full
 time  or part time New York City Department of Education employees serv-
 ing in New York City Board of Education Retirement System (BERS)  eligi-
 ble  titles  represented  by  the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) to
 join or transfer into the New  York  City  Teachers'  Retirement  System
 (TRS)  by filing a notice with BERS within one year of becoming eligible
 for such TRS membership.

  The Employer Contribution impact shown  above  reflects  the  cost  of
 expected  benefit increases using TRS assumptions only. Not shown is any
 impact due to valuing impacted BERS members using TRS  assumptions.  The
 potential  impact  of assumption changes is discussed further below. The
 Employer Contribution impact beyond  Fiscal  Year  2049  is  not  shown.
 Projected contributions include future new hires that may be impacted.

  Unfunded  Accrued Liability increases were amortized over the expected
 remaining working lifetime of those  impacted  by  the  benefit  changes
 using level dollar payments.
  IMPACT  ON CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUNDING: Employer contributions are actu-
 arially determined to fund expected benefit  payments  over  the  future
 working  lifetime  of  the members, with any gain or loss resulting from
 actual experience differing from expectations recognized separately.
  Applying TRS assumptions to members currently in BERS would change the
 funding pattern for these members, immediately increasing  the  employer
 contributions,  and  over time, gains and losses would ultimately offset
 any  changes  in  the  required  contributions.  Reevaluating  actuarial
 assumptions  (e.g.,  salary  scale, mortality, etc.) may be warranted if
 there is a significant change in  the  demographics  of  the  underlying
 population.  The  first-year  impact of valuing these BERS members using
 current TRS assumptions, assuming no change in  benefits,  is  an  addi-
 tional net increase in the employer contributions of $19.6 million.
  In  addition,  the transfer of reserves based on the accrued liability
 for members who switch between systems is  dependent  on  the  actuarial
 assumptions  utilized. The calculation of reserves based on BERS assump-
 tions would be less than the reserves calculated based  on  TRS  assump-
 tions.  The  net  impact will ultimately be reconciled through actuarial
 gains and losses but may vary  by  system.  The  accrued  liability  and
 expected  reserve  transfer  from BERS to TRS due to the proposed legis-
 lation is approximately $730 million.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data  collected  as  of  June  30, 2023. The census data for the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  BERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  5,533
  - Average Age:  47
  - Average Service:  8.6
  - Average Salary:  80,300
 
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: Employees  in  the  impacted  titles  would
 generally, except as provided below, be eligible for the same respective
 plans in TRS in which they are eligible to participate in BERS.

  Under the proposed legislation, if a member elects to join or transfer
 to TRS, members may be entitled to additional benefits. Among those, the
 following differences were valued for purposes of this Fiscal Note:
  * Unreduced Retirement with 30 years of service for Tier 4 members
  * Provisions for additional member contributions
  * Greater Accidental Disability Retirement benefits
  * Loans Factors applied to outstanding balances at retirement
  * Early Deferred Vested Retirement commencement
  Additional  differences may apply but were not valued for the purposes
 of this Fiscal Note.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of TRS. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  To  determine the impact of the elective nature of the proposed legis-
 lation, a subgroup of members in UFT represented  titles  was  developed
 based  on  who  is  assumed  to benefit actuarially by comparing the net
 present value of future employer costs of each  member's  benefit  under
 their current plan and under the comparable TRS plan.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
  In  addition,  this  Fiscal  Note  does  not measure the impact of the
 significant transfer of member contributions and reserves from  BERS  to
 TRS.
