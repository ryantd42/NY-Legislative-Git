 cle so far as such provisions  can  be  made  applicable  to  the  taxes
 imposed by this article with such limitations as set forth in this arti-

 TIME  AND UPON SUCH TERMS AS HE OR SHE MAY DEEM PROPER IF SATISFIED THAT

  (C) IF ANY PERSON REGISTERED OR WHO HAS OBTAINED A LICENSE UNDER  THIS
 ARTICLE,  OR  THEIR  AGENTS,  REFUSES  TO  GIVE THE COMMISSIONER, OR THE
 COMMISSIONER'S DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES,  THE  MEANS,  FACILITIES
