  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision  12  of  section  400.00 of the penal law, as
 amended by chapter 207 of the laws  of  2022,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  12. Records required of gunsmiths and dealers in firearms. In addition
 to  the  requirements set forth in article thirty-nine-BB of the general
 business law, any person licensed as  gunsmith  or  dealer  in  firearms
 shall  keep a record book approved as to form, except in the city of New
 York, by the superintendent of state police. In the record book shall be
 entered at the time of every transaction involving a firearm  the  date,
 name, age, occupation and residence of any person from whom a firearm is
 received  or  to  whom  a  firearm  is delivered, and the calibre, make,
 model, manufacturer's name and serial number,  or  if  none,  any  other
 distinguishing  number  or  identification  mark on such firearm. Before
 delivering a firearm to any person, the licensee shall  require  him  to
 produce  either  a  license valid under this section to carry or possess
 the same, or proof of lawful authority as an exempt person  pursuant  to
 section  265.20  of  this  chapter and [either (a)] the National Instant
 Criminal Background Check System (NICS) or  its  successor  [has]  SHALL
 HAVE  issued a "proceed" response to the licensee[, or (b) thirty calen-
 dar days have elapsed since the date  the  licensee  contacted  NICS  to
 initiate  a  national instant criminal background check and NICS has not
 notified the licensee that the transfer of the firearm  to  such  person
 should  be  denied]. In addition, before delivering a firearm to a peace
 officer, the licensee shall verify that person's status as a peace offi-
 cer with the division of state police. After completing  the  foregoing,
 the  licensee  shall  remove and retain the attached coupon and enter in

 the  licensing  officer, in the case of the holder of a license to carry
 or possess, or the shield  or  other  number,  if  any,  assignment  and
 department,  unit  or  agency,  in  the  case  of  an exempt person. The
 original transaction report shall be forwarded to the division of  state
 police  within  ten  days  of  delivering a firearm to any person, and a
 duplicate copy shall be kept by  the  licensee.  The  superintendent  of
 state police may designate that such record shall be completed and tran-
 smitted in electronic form. A dealer may be granted a waiver from trans-
 mitting such records in electronic form if the superintendent determines
 that  such dealer is incapable of such transmission due to technological
 limitations that are not reasonably within the control of the dealer, or
 other exceptional circumstances demonstrated by the dealer, pursuant  to
 a process established in regulation, and at the discretion of the super-
 intendent.  Records assembled or collected for purposes of inclusion in
 the database created pursuant to section 400.02 of  this  article  shall
 not be subject to disclosure pursuant to article six of the public offi-
 cers  law. The record book shall be maintained on the premises mentioned
 and described in the license and shall be open at all  reasonable  hours
 for  inspection  by  any  peace  officer, acting pursuant to his special
 duties, or police officer. In the event of cancellation or revocation of
 the license for gunsmith or dealer in  firearms,  or  discontinuance  of
 business  by  a  licensee, such record book shall be immediately surren-
 dered to the licensing officer in the city of New York, and in the coun-
 ties of Nassau and Suffolk, and elsewhere in the state to the  executive
 department, division of state police.
