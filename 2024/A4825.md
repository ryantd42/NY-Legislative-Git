 Introduced  by M. of A. RAMOS -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Judiciary
 
 AN ACT to amend the judiciary law,  in  relation  to  establishing  gang
  courts;  and  providing for the repeal of such provisions upon expira-
  tion thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Findings. The legislature hereby finds and declares that
 the growth of criminal gang activities  have  created  a  public  safety
 crisis and social disorder in many communities across our state. To this
 point, our system of justice has failed to successfully deter the spread
 of  this  criminality.  Whether  it  is  the  distribution  and  sale of
 controlled substances,  street  crime,  gun  violence,  prostitution  or
 simply  the  climate of fear, intimidation, and disorder that poison our
 neighborhoods, many afflicted localities appear to be  under  siege.  To
 address  this  problem, the state should be flexible and seek integrated
 ways of employing the resources of our  judicial  and  criminal  justice
 system and other state and local entities.
  Based  on  the foregoing findings the legislature hereby declares that
 the New York unified court system should be  empowered  to  establish  a
 gang  court  pilot  program  within  available  appropriations,  to help
 address these broad based issues. The legislature contemplates that  the
 program authorized in this act may consist of three special gang courts,
 one in the county of Orange, one in the county of Nassau, and one in the
 county  of  Suffolk,  to hear and determine gang related criminal cases,
 properly venued in compliance with  the  criminal  procedure  law,  from
 within  each  respective county, commencing no later than January first,
 two thousand twenty-four and continuing, at least, until January  first,
 two thousand twenty-nine.
  The  legislature  declares  that  the  resources  necessary  for these
 special gang parts of the courts of Orange county, the courts of  Nassau

 county,  and  the  courts  of  Suffolk county can be made available only
 through a combination of federal funds from the law enforcement  assist-
 ance  administration  of  the  United  States department of justice, and
 state and local funds, services and facilities.
