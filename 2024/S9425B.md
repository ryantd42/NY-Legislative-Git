 AN ACT authorizing Kolel Rachmistrivka to receive retroactive real prop-
  erty tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Ramapo is hereby authorized to  accept  from
 Kolel  Rachmistrivka  an  application  for  exemption from real property
 taxes pursuant to section 420-a  of  the  real  property  tax  law  with
 respect  to  the  2021,  2022  and  2023 assessment rolls for the parcel
 conveyed to such organization located at 2 Hopal Lane, hamlet of Monsey,
 town of Ramapo, county of Rockland, otherwise known as  Rockland  county
 parcel  ID  section  56.07  block 4 lot 38. If accepted, the application
 shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or  before  the  taxable
 status date established for such roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval by the town board of Ramapo, may make appropriate correction to
 the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and  such  organization,
 therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls,
 the applicable governing  body  or  tax  department  may,  in  its  sole
 discretion,  provide for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel those
 taxes, fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
