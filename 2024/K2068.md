  HONORING  Kathy  Miller  upon  the occasion of her
  designation for special recognition by the New  York
  State Office for the Aging on May 14, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and knowledge
to the increasingly active roles they play  in  today's  society;  their
past  contributions  and  future  participation are a vital part of, and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Kathy Miller
upon the occasion of her designation for special recognition by the  New
York  State  Office  for the Aging on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at The Hart
Theater Lounge at the Egg Performing Arts Theater at  the  Empire  State
Plaza; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each May, the New York State Office for the Aging pauses to
acknowledge  the outstanding contributions made by older citizens during
National Older Americans Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Members of older generations have helped  build  and  shape
our  Nation  to  be  the  greatest  in the world; they have defended our
freedoms and values to ensure that those who come after  them  may  have
better  lives; nowhere in the Nation is the legacy of their efforts more
visible and more a part of the lives of all citizens than  here  in  the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kathy  Miller  of  Oxford, New York in Chenango County has
continually displayed the utmost competence, extraordinary intelligence,
and diligent leadership in her unwavering service to her community  and,
consequently, has been selected for this most prestigious honor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kathy  Miller, with a bachelor's degree in psychology from
SUNY Oneonta, crafted a deeply  purposeful  life  working  as  a  social
worker  across many counties across New York State; she served as a case
manager and counselor for the Health Insurance  Information,  Counseling
and  Assistance  Program  (HIICAP),  which  provides  free and objective
counseling to older adults on Medicare  with  various  health  insurance
related questions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  esteemed honoree also gives of her time to volunteer
during the agency's busy  HIICAP  season;  her  valuable  and  extensive
knowledge  and  genuine care for clients does not go unrecognized by all
those she serves with, as well as by all those she  continues  to  help;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In her leisure time, beyond her volunteerism, Kathy Miller
enjoys spending time with  her  family,  including  with  her  sons  and
grandchildren, as well as traveling whenever possible; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Rare  indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by
individuals for the benefit of others which Kathy Miller  has  displayed
throughout her life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kathy Miller has enriched the lives of her family, friends,
and  colleagues through her love and respect for others, and through the
wisdom which comes from many years of living life to the  fullest;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Kathy Miller upon the occasion  of  her  designation  for  special
recognition  by the New York State Office for the Aging on May 14, 2024;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Kathy Miller.
