  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Item (vii) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph 6 of subsection
 (k) of section 3221 of the insurance law, as amended  by  section  1  of
 part L of chapter 57 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (vii)  Every  large  group  policy delivered or issued for delivery in
 this state that provides medical, major medical  or  similar  comprehen-
 sive-type coverage shall provide coverage for [three cycles of in-vitro]
 IN  VITRO  fertilization  used in the treatment of infertility. Coverage
 may be subject to annual deductibles and coinsurance,  including  copay-

 in-vitro fertilization using a fresh embryo transfer; or medications are
 administered  for  endometrial preparation with the intent of undergoing
 in-vitro fertilization using a frozen embryo transfer.]

 similar comprehensive-type coverage shall provide  coverage  for  [three
 cycles  of  in-vitro]  IN  VITRO  fertilization used in the treatment of
 infertility.  Coverage may be subject to annual deductibles and  coinsu-
 rance,  including copayments, as may be deemed appropriate by the super-
 intendent and as are consistent with those established for  other  bene-
 fits  within  a  given  contract.  [For purposes of this subparagraph, a
