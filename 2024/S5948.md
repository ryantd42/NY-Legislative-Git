  § 2. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 of section 467 of the real proper-
 ty tax law, as separately amended by chapter 488 and section 1 of part B
 of chapter 686 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  (a) if the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of
 the property for the income tax year immediately preceding the  date  of
 making  application  for  exemption  exceeds  the  sum of three thousand
 dollars, or such other sum not less than three thousand dollars nor more
 than twenty-six thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand six,
 twenty-seven thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand  seven,
 twenty-eight  thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand eight,
 twenty-nine thousand dollars beginning July first,  two  thousand  nine,
 fifty  thousand  dollars  beginning July first, two thousand twenty-two,
 and [in a city with a population of one million or more] fifty  thousand
 dollars beginning July first, two thousand seventeen, as may be provided
 by  the  local  law,  ordinance  or  resolution adopted pursuant to this
 section. Where the taxable status date is on or before April fourteenth,
 income tax year shall mean the twelve-month period for which  the  owner
 or owners filed a federal personal income tax return for the year before
 the  income  tax  year immediately preceding the date of application and
 where the taxable status date is on or after April fifteenth, income tax
 S. 5948  3
 
 year shall mean the twelve-month period for which the  owner  or  owners
 filed a federal personal income tax return for the income tax year imme-
 diately  preceding  the  date  of  application. Where title is vested in
 either  the  husband  or  the wife, their combined income may not exceed
 such sum, except where the husband or wife, or ex-husband or ex-wife  is
 absent  from  the property as provided in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph
 (d) of this subdivision, then only the income of the spouse or ex-spouse
 residing on the property shall be considered and  may  not  exceed  such
 sum.  Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits,
 interest, dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of  a  capital
 asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capi-
 tal  asset  in  the  same  income tax year, net rental income, salary or
 earnings, and net income from self-employment, but shall not  include  a
 return  of  capital,  gifts,  inheritances, payments made to individuals
 because of their status as victims of Nazi persecution,  as  defined  in
 P.L.  103-286  or monies earned through employment in the federal foster
 grandparent program and any such income shall be offset by  all  medical
 and  prescription  drug expenses actually paid which were not reimbursed
 or paid for by insurance, if the  governing  board  of  a  municipality,
 after  a  public  hearing,  adopts  a local law, ordinance or resolution
 providing therefor. In addition, an exchange of an annuity for an annui-
 ty contract, which  resulted  in  non-taxable  gain,  as  determined  in
 section  one thousand thirty-five of the internal revenue code, shall be
 excluded from such income. Provided that such exclusion shall  be  based
 on satisfactory proof that such an exchange was solely an exchange of an
 annuity  for an annuity contract that resulted in a non-taxable transfer
 determined by such section of the internal  revenue  code.  Furthermore,
 such  income  shall  not  include the proceeds of a reverse mortgage, as
 authorized by section six-h of the banking law, and sections two hundred
 eighty and two hundred eighty-a of  the  real  property  law;  provided,
 however,  that  monies  used  to  repay  a  reverse  mortgage may not be
 deducted from income, and provided additionally  that  any  interest  or
 dividends  realized  from  the  investment  of reverse mortgage proceeds
 shall be considered income. The provisions of  this  paragraph  notwith-
 standing,  such  income  shall  not  include veterans disability compen-
 sation, as defined in Title 38 of the United States  Code  provided  the
 governing  board  of  such  municipality, after public hearing, adopts a
 local law, ordinance or resolution providing therefor. In computing  net
 rental  income  and  net  income  from  self-employment  no depreciation
 deduction shall be allowed for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real  or
 personal property held for the production of income;
  § 3. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 459-c of the real prop-
 erty  tax  law,  as amended by section 2 of part B of chapter 686 of the
 laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  (b) Any local law or resolution adopted pursuant to paragraph  (a)  of
 this  subdivision  may  be  amended, or a local law or resolution may be
 adopted, to provide an exemption so as to increase  the  maximum  income
 eligibility  level of such municipal corporation as provided in subdivi-
 sion five of this section (represented in the  hereinbelow  schedule  as
 M), to the extent provided in the following schedule:

  § 4. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 5 of section 459-c of the real prop-
 erty tax law, as separately amended by chapter 488 and section 2 of part
 B of chapter 686 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  (a) if the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of
 the  property  for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of
 making application for exemption  exceeds  the  sum  of  three  thousand
 dollars, or such other sum not less than three thousand dollars nor more

 two,  and  [in  a  city  with a population of one million or more] fifty
 thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand seventeen, as may be
 provided by the  local  law  or  resolution  adopted  pursuant  to  this
 section.  Income  tax  year shall mean the twelve month period for which
 the owner or owners filed a federal personal income tax return, or if no
 such return is filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in either
 the husband or the wife, their combined income may not exceed such  sum,
 except  where  the  husband  or wife, or ex-husband or ex-wife is absent
 from the property due to divorce, legal separation or abandonment,  then
 only  the  income  of  the  spouse or ex-spouse residing on the property
 shall be considered and may not  exceed  such  sum.  Such  income  shall
 include  social  security  and retirement benefits, interest, dividends,
 total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital  asset  which  may  be
 offset  by  a  loss  from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the
 same income tax year, net rental income, salary  or  earnings,  and  net
 income  from self-employment, but shall not include a return of capital,
 gifts, inheritances or monies earned through employment in  the  federal
 foster  grandparent  program  and any such income shall be offset by all
 medical and prescription drug expenses  actually  paid  which  were  not
 reimbursed or paid for by insurance, if the governing board of a munici-
 pality, after a public hearing, adopts a local law or resolution provid-
 ing  therefor.  In computing net rental income and net income from self-
 employment  no  depreciation  deduction  shall  be  allowed  for  the
 exhaustion,  wear  and  tear  of  real or personal property held for the
 production of income;
  § 5. The state shall, within an appropriation made available therefor,
 reimburse municipal corporations for the difference between  the  amount
 of  real property tax revenue abated for the fiscal year of such munici-
 pality that occurs after April 1, 2023 pursuant to the income thresholds

 pursuant to the income thresholds that were in effect immediately  prior
 to the effective date of this act.
  §  6.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any
 local law, resolution or ordinance amended or adopted on and  after  the
