 Introduced  by  Sen.  ASHBY  -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law and the state finance law, in relation
  to establishing the New York state preceptor stipend program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "New York state preceptor stipend program".
  § 2. Legislative intent. New York state health care is in crisis  from
 staffing  shortages  that  are  exacerbated  by  staff  burnout. Quality
 preceptorships are  an  essential  component  of  clinical  professional
 development,  and  also a powerful tool for recruitment and retention in
 the healthcare industry. By providing supervision during clinical  prac-
 tice and facilitating the application of theory to practice for students
 and staff learners, preceptors can help promote self-awareness and crit-
 ical thinking for students. That confidence and on-the-job training will
 foster  a  healthy  mentorship  and encourage future health care profes-
 sionals to pursue their health career in New  York  state.  Preceptor-
 ships,  however, are a time-consuming commitment and health care workers
 in New York state are hard-pressed  to  add  more  to  their  plates.  A
 stipend  program  would  incentivize  health  care  professionals  to be
 preceptors and take on the  responsibility  of  training  future  health
 professionals.
  §  3.  The  education law is amended by adding a new section 6505-e to
 read as follows:
  § 6505-E. NEW YORK STATE PRECEPTOR STIPEND PROGRAM. 1. PROGRAM  ESTAB-
 LISHED.  THE  CHIEF  ADMINISTRATIVE  OFFICER  OF  THE  OFFICE  OF  THE
 PROFESSIONS SHALL CREATE A "NEW YORK STATE  PRECEPTOR  STIPEND  PROGRAM"
 FOR PRECEPTOR CLINICIANS.  UNDER SUCH PROGRAM, A STIPEND SHALL BE ISSUED
 OUT  OF  FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE FOR SUCH PROGRAM PURSUANT TO APPROPRIATION
 FROM THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE OFFICE OF THE  PROFESSIONS  ACCOUNT  UNDER
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
