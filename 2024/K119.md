BY: M. of A. Rosenthal L
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 20-26, 2023, as Eating Disorders  Awareness
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  weeks  that  are  set  aside  to increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 20-26,  2023,  as
Eating Disorders Awareness Week in the State of New York, in conjunction
with  the  observance of National Eating Disorders (NED) Awareness Week;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In the United States, 20 million women and 10  million  men
suffer  from  clinically  significant  eating  disorders at some time in
their life including Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN),  Binge
Eating  Disorder (BED), or an Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder
(OSFED) and affect people across all racial and ethnic backgrounds; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Eating  disorders  are  serious  conditions  that  are
potentially  life-threatening  and  have  a  serious  impact  on  an
individual's emotional and physical  health,  including  abnormal  heart
rate,  low  blood  pressure,  and  reduction in bone density; too often,
signs and symptoms are overlooked, and many individuals,  families,  and
communities  are  unaware  of  the  devastating  mental  and  physical
consequences of eating disorders, as well as the  pressures,  attitudes,
and behaviors which shape them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The National Eating Disorders Association, which calls New
York  State  its  home,  strives  to  address  the  many  misconceptions
regarding  eating  disorders,  and  to  highlight  the  availability  of
resources for treatment and support; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Eating Disorder Awareness Week is a  collaborative
effort  consisting  primarily  of  volunteers, including eating disorder
professionals,  health  care  providers,  students,  educators,  social
workers,  and  individuals committed to raising awareness of the dangers
surrounding eating disorders and the need  for  early  intervention  and
treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Eating  disorders  usually  appear  in adolescence and are
associated  with  substantial  psychological  problems,  including
depression, substance abuse and suicide; they are serious illnesses, not
lifestyle  choices;  in fact, anorexia has the highest mortality rate of
any mental illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many cases of eating disorders  go  undetected;  less  than
one-third  of  youth  with  eating  disorders  will  receive  treatment;
although primarily  affecting  females,  one  in  every  three  to  four
individuals with these illnesses is male; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Eating  disorders experts have found that prompt intensive
treatment significantly improves the chances of recovery; therefore,  it
is  important  for  educators, medical providers, parents, and community
members to be aware of the warning signs  and  the  symptoms  of  eating
disorders; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Eating Disorder Awareness Week will highlight the
fact that body size and shape  are  strongly  influenced  by  biological
factors,  while  also  calling  attention to some of the new discoveries
surrounding the role of genetics in the development of eating disorders;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Concerned individuals are asked to talk with others  during
National  Eating  Disorder  Awareness  Week,  in  hopes  that  their
participation will raise awareness that eating disorders are  a  serious
illness,  provide  accurate  information to the medical, educational and
business  communities,  and  direct  people  to  potentially  lifesaving
information and resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2004,  New York State took a leading role in the fight
against eating  disorders  by  establishing  an  integrated  network  of
Comprehensive  Care  Centers  for  Eating  Disorders  which  provide
evidence-based treatment to those afflicted throughout the State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body recognizes the vital work of National
Eating Disorder Awareness Week in promoting public and  media  attention
to  the  seriousness  of  eating  disorders  and  for working to improve
education about their biological and environmental causes,  as  well  as
how  to  help  those  who are struggling with this debilitating disease;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 20-26, 2023, as
Eating Disorders Awareness Week in the State of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; and The National Eating Disorders Association.
