  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 26, 2024, as  Women's  Equality  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the practice of this Legislative Body to acknowledge
and celebrate individuals and events of historic significance which  add
inspiration  and  understanding to the diversity and value of this great
Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  26,  2024,  as
Women's  Equality  Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Women's Equality Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Women's Equality Day, August 26th,  the  hard  work  and
perseverance  of  those who helped secure women's suffrage in the United
States is recognized; and
 
  WHEREAS, First introduced in 1878, the 19th Amendment was passed  by
the United States Congress on June 4, 1919; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the  ratification  of  the  19th  Amendment  to  the
Constitution in 1920, American women gained one of  the  most  cherished
rights  and  fundamental  responsibilities  of citizenship: the right to
vote; and
 
  WHEREAS, The struggle for women's suffrage in America dates back  to
the founding of our country; the movement began in earnest at the Seneca
Falls Convention in 1848, when women drafted a Declaration of Sentiments
proclaiming they had the same rights as men; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1916,  Jeannette  Rankin  of  Montana became the first
American woman elected to the United States  House  of  Representatives,
despite  the  fact  that  her  fellow  women  would  not be able to vote
nationally for four more years; these women  and  many  more  like  them
worked  to  ensure  that  future  generations of women could realize the
promise of America; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, American women are leaders in business,  government,
law,  science,  medicine,  the  arts,  education, and many other fields;
women-owned businesses account for nearly half  of  all  privately  held
firms and are opening at twice the rate of male-owned businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  vision,  determination,  and a strong work ethic,
remarkable American women have broadened  opportunities  for  themselves
and women around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The full participation of women and the protection of their
rights  as citizens are essential for freedom and democracy to flourish;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to celebrate  the
extraordinary accomplishments of women in the State of New York, America
and  throughout  the  world and renew our commitment to equality for all
women, both at home and abroad; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  26,  2024,  as
Women's Equality Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
