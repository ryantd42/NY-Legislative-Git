  COMMEMORATING  the  223rd  Birthday  of William H.
  Seward, former New York State  Senator,  former  New
  York  State  Governor, former United States Senator,
  former  United  States  Secretary  of  State,  and
  purchaser of Alaska
 
  WHEREAS,  William  Henry Seward was born in Florida on May 16, 1801,
and died in Auburn, New York, on October 12, 1872, where he  spent  much
of his adult life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  honor William Henry Seward, a celebration will be held
in the Village of Florida, New York, which will include  wreath  laying,
speeches, live music, and various family activities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  William  Henry  Seward  made  a  monumental  impact in the
histories of not only Orange County, but New York State and  the  entire
country,  serving  in  numerous  leadership  capacities such as New York
Senator, New York Governor, United States Senator and Secretary of State
for both the Lincoln and Johnson administrations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sympathetic to the plights of runaway slaves, William Henry
Seward offered his home in Auburn as a stop on the Underground Railroad,
where he hid slaves on their way to Canada; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1867, William  Henry  Seward  acquired  Alaska  for  the
United  States  from  Russia;  through  the  years  he  tried in vain to
purchase Hawaii and the Dutch West Indies, as well as build a  canal  in
Panama; all of which came to fruition long after his death; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  a  failed  presidential  bid in 1860, William Henry
Seward served as President Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State; in this
capacity, he  was  instrumental  in  the  passage  of  the  Emancipation
Proclamation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bound  to his roots, William Henry Seward was a vital part
of the S.S. Seward Institute in Florida, New York, a  school  which  his
father founded in 1846; and
 
  WHEREAS,  William  Henry  Seward  will forever be remembered for his
achievements in office, and for his foresight in anticipating the future
needs of the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is pleased to have  this  opportunity
to  express its highest admiration for William Henry Seward, and for all
of the individuals who have worked  to  bring  proper  attention  to  an
individual  and  time  which merits recognition in the grand panorama of
the history of our State and Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  223rd  Birthday  of William H. Seward, former New York
State Senator, former New York  State  Governor,  former  United  States
Senator,  former  United  States  Secretary  of  State, and purchaser of
Alaska; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Florida Historical Society.
