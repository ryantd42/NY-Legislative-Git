 provisions of the following sections of this article, the wage board and
 the  commissioner  shall  consider  the  amount  sufficient  to  provide
 adequate maintenance and to protect health and, in  addition,  the  wage

  4. Report. Within forty-five days of the appointment of the wage board
 to inquire into wages in any occupation or occupations, the board  shall
 (a) conduct public hearings and (b) submit to the commissioner a report,
 including  its  recommendations  as to minimum wages and regulations for
 the  employees  in such occupation or occupations. The report and recom-
 mendations of the board shall be submitted only after [a] THE  UNANIMOUS
 vote of [not less than a majority of] all its members in support of such
 report and recommendations. No report or recommendation of a panel shall
 be submitted without the prior vote of [not less than a majority of] all
 the  members  of  the board in support of such report or recommendation.
 The commissioner may extend up to ninety days  the  time  in  which  the
 report shall be submitted.
  § 4. Section 656 of the labor law, as added by chapter 619 of the laws
 of 1960, is amended to read as follows:
  §  656.  Action by commissioner upon wage board report.  When the wage
 board submits its report and recommendations to  the  commissioner,  the
 commissioner shall forthwith file them with the secretary of the depart-
 ment.  Within five days of their receipt, the commissioner shall publish
 a notice of such filing in at least ten  newspapers  of  general  circu-
 lation  in  the  state. Any objections to the report and recommendations
 shall be filed with the commissioner  within  fifteen  days  after  such
 publication.  The  commissioner  may,  if he deems it appropriate, order
 oral argument, which shall be scheduled before the commissioner, or such
 representative as he may designate, on five days' notice to the  persons
 who  have filed objections to the report and recommendations. Whether or
 not oral argument is scheduled, the commissioner shall [by order] accept
 [or], reject, OR MODIFY the board's report  and  recommendations  within
 forty-five  days  after  filing with the secretary of the department AND
 SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE, WHICH SHALL INCLUDE (I)  THE  RECOM-
 MENDATIONS  OF  THE  WAGE BOARD; (II) A STATEMENT INDICATING WHETHER THE
 COMMISSIONER ACCEPTS, REJECTS OR RECOMMENDS MODIFICATION OF THE  BOARD'S
 REPORT  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS; (III) ANY AND ALL OBJECTIONS TO THE REPORT
 AND RECOMMENDATIONS FILED WITH THE COMMISSIONER; AND (IV)  THE  ANALYSIS
 REQUIRED BY SECTION SIX HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR OF THIS ARTICLE. [The commis-
 sioner  may  by  such  order  modify  the regulations recommended by the
 board. Such order of the commissioner shall become effective thirty days
 after publication, in the manner prescribed in this section, of a notice
 of such order.] The  commissioner  may,  within  such  forty-five  days,
 confer with the wage board, which may make such changes in its report or
 recommendations  as  it may deem fit.  The commissioner also may, within
 such forty-five days, remand the matter to the board  for  such  further
 proceeding as he may direct.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
