  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024 as Prader-Willi Syndrome Awareness Month in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim May 2024, as Prader-Willi Syndrome
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex  genetic  disorder  that
occurs  in  approximately  1 out of every 15,000 births, and is the most
commonly known genetic cause of life-threatening obesity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prader-Willi syndrome affects males and females with  equal
frequency and affects all races and ethnicities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Prader-Willi  syndrome  causes  an  extreme and insatiable
appetite, often resulting in morbid obesity, which is the major cause of
death for individuals with the syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prader-Willi syndrome also causes  cognitive  and  learning
disabilities,  and behavioral difficulties, such as obsessive-compulsive
disorder and difficulty controlling emotions; and
 
  WHEREAS, The hunger, metabolic, and  behavioral  characteristics  of
Prader-Willi syndrome force affected individuals to require constant and
lifelong supervision in a controlled environment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Studies  have  shown  that  there  is a high morbidity and
mortality rate for individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is no known cure for Prader-Willi syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS, Early diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome allows families to
access  treatment,  intervention  services,  and  support  from  health
professionals,  advocacy  organizations,  and  other  families  who  are
dealing with the syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recently  discovered  treatments,  such  as  human  growth
hormone,  and  many  promising new research studies ongoing currently in
New York State offer hope to and are improving the quality of  life  for
individuals  with  the  syndrome and offer new hope to families, helping
the many difficult symptoms associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome remain
untreated; and
 
  WHEREAS, Increased research into Prader-Willi Syndrome can lead to a
better understanding of the disorder, more effective treatments, and  an
eventual cure for Prader-Willi Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In addition, increased research into Prader-Willi Syndrome
is likely to improve our understanding of common public health concerns,
including childhood obesity and mental health; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as  Prader-Willi
Syndrome Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this  Legislative  Body  pause  further  to support
raising awareness and educating the public about Prader-Willi  Syndrome;
to  applaud  the  efforts  of advocates and organizations that encourage
awareness, promote research, provide  education,  support  and  hope  to
those  impacted by Prader-Willi Syndrome; to recognize the commitment of
parents,  families,  researchers,  health  professionals,  and  others
dedicated  to  finding  an  effective  treatment  and  eventual cure for
Prader-Willi Syndrome; and to support  increased  funding  for  research
into  the  causes, treatment, and cure for Prader-Willi Syndrome; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
