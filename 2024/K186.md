  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 12, 2023 as Working Moms Day in the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body that mothers who
faithfully serve the needs of the community and its citizens while  also
caring  for  a  child  with  utmost  diligence and compassion profoundly
strengthen our shared commitment to family and community life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 12, 2023 as  Working
Moms Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Working Moms Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Working Moms Day, celebrated during Women's History Month,
brings awareness to the women in New York State who work  tirelessly  as
mothers and devote their lives to benefiting their community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mothers  are both breadwinners and bread makers, and March
12th recognizes these miraculous individuals  who  serve  as  educators,
role models, and inspirational fixtures in our children's lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Working  Moms of Milwaukee (WMM) launched National Working
Moms Day in 2020 to celebrate working moms everywhere; the day  aims  to
create  a  supportive  space  where  moms  can  connect  both online and
in-person, get support from other mothers, access services to  make  the
day-to-day a little easier, and celebrate motherhood; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded  in December of 2017 by Susannah Lago, a local mom
who needed support, WMM has expanded nationally, working to help mothers
who work full-time, part-time, inside the home, or outside of the  home;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  vital  day  of  recognition,  Working Moms Day provides
opportunities for mothers to network  with  other  moms  from  different
backgrounds, fields, and professions online and in-person, and socialize
in time frames that work for busy families; and
 
  WHEREAS, Community members should be encouraged to celebrate working
moms  who  provide  essential  care  and  support  to  children in their
communities, while also serving to  enhance  the  quality  of  New  York
State's economy and professional industry; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 12, 2023, as Working
Moms Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and Working Moms of Milwaukee (WMM).
