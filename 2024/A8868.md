  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of any general or special
 law, rule or regulation to the contrary, an application  for  conversion
 of  service  or  disability  retirement to accidental death benefits for
 victims of the 2001 World Trade Center disaster filed  by  Cynthia  Adam
 with  the New York state and local police and fire retirement system, on
 behalf of her deceased husband Paul C. Adam who was previously  employed
 by  the  department  of environmental conservation and who was granted a
 service retirement benefit in March 2013, which was filed  on  September
 11, 2018 shall be considered timely filed.
  §  2.  All  costs  of implementing the provisions of this act shall be
 borne by the state of New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would deem the Application  for  Conversion  of  Service  or
 Disability  Retirement  to  Accidental  Death Benefit for Victims of the
 2001 World Trade Center Disaster originally filed by Cynthia  Adam,  the
 beneficiary  of  deceased environmental conservation police officer Paul
 Adam, on September 11, 2018 to  be  timely  filed.  Paul  Adam  died  on
 September  8,  2015.  Such  application for conversion is required to be
 filed within two years of a retiree's  date  of  death  as  provided  in
 Section 361 of the Retirement and Social Security Law.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of  approximately  $3.17  million
 which will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
