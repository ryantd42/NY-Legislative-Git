 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  administrative code of the city of New York, in
  relation to the pensionable earnings of first grade police officers
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature here-
 by  finds  and  declares  that  an adjustment to pensionable earnings of
 first grade police officers is necessary to enhance  public  safety  and
 prevent the loss of vital public services in this state. The legislature
 hereby  finds and declares that such adjustment is necessary to address,
 inter alia,  the  historic  police  officer  recruitment  and  retention
 crisis, the increase in police overtime, and the rise in crime impacting
 New  Yorkers.  Therefore, the legislature declares the necessity for the
 enactment of this act to  enhance  public  safety  and  protect  against
 disruption of vital public services in this state.
  § 2. Section 14-111 of the administrative code of the city of New York
 is amended by adding two new subdivisions c and d to read as follows:
  C.  WHEN  A  FIRST  GRADE POLICE OFFICER OF THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL HAVE SERVED IN THE RANK OF POLICE OFFICER FOR A  PERIOD
 OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, HE OR SHE SHALL HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS IN RESPECT TO
 THE  NEW  YORK  STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR THE
 NEW YORK CITY POLICE PENSION FUND AS A POLICE OFFICER DESIGNATED TO  ACT
 AS  DETECTIVE  OF  THE  THIRD  GRADE WHO SHALL HAVE SERVED AS SUCH FOR A
 PERIOD OF TIME AGGREGATING TWO YEARS AT THE HIGHEST SALARY  RATE  FOR  A
 DETECTIVE OF THE THIRD GRADE.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:

 mining pension benefits for first grade NYPD officers who have served in
 such rank for 25 or 30 years, to salaries equivalent  to  detective  3rd
 grade or sergeant, respectively.

  Projected  contributions are based on historical experience for Tier 2
 members. Future retirement patterns may differ due to a  larger  Tier  3
 population  (e.g.,  Tier 2 is expected to retire at 20 years of service,
 and Tier 3 is expected to retire at 25 years of service).
  The entire increase in employer contributions will be allocated to New
 York City.
  EXPECTED INCREASE (DECREASE) IN ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES
  The enactment of this proposed legislation is expected to increase the
 Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) by approximately $8.2 million in
 the first year and every year thereafter. Each year's PVFB increase will
 A. 5202--B  3
 
 depend on the actual experience  of  benefiting  retirees  and  will  be
 recognized in the year benefits are first payable.
  AMORTIZATION OF UNFUNDED ACCRUED LIABILITY
 
  Recognized as Ongoing Gain/Loss  POLICE
 
  Number of Payments:  14
  Fiscal Year of Last Payment:  N/A
  First-year Amortization Payment:  $ 1.0 M
 
  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census  data  for  POLICE
 active members is summarized below.
 
  POLICE
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  33,800
  - Average Age:  37.6
  - Average Service:  11.3
  - Average Salary:  128,600
 
  The salaries used in this analysis were provided by the Police Benevo-
 lent Association of the City of New York and reflect the latest contract
 negotiations. Below is a summary of the salary data provided:
  * Police Officer 1st Grade - $105,146
  * Detective 3rd Grade - $111,999
  * Sergeant - $125,852
  Data  from  prior actuarial valuations was used to estimate the number
 of retirees who could potentially benefit from this proposed legislation
 and is summarized below.
  * Police Officer 1st Grade who retired with 25-29 years in rank -  930
 retired over the past 10 years.
  *  Police  Officer  1st Grade who retired with 30+ years in rank - 218
 retired over the past 10 years.
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: The proposed legislation would permit first
 grade police officers, who have met  certain  service  requirements,  to
 have their pension calculations based on a higher assumed salary.
  For  example,  under this proposed legislation a Tier 2 Police Officer
 1st Grade who holds such position for at least 25, or  30,  years  would
 receive  an  increase  in  their annual pension benefit of approximately
 $4,300 or $12,200 per year, respectively,  due  to  the  higher  assumed
 pensionable salary.
  Based  on an estimate of the number of POLICE members who are expected
 to be impacted by the increased pensionable salary, it is estimated that
 if this proposed legislation is enacted, the annual increase  in  POLICE
 pension  benefits  paid  will be approximately $0.7 million in the first
 year and increase in every year thereafter.
  With respect to an individual member, the impact on  benefits  due  to
 this  proposed  legislation could vary greatly depending on the member's
 age, years of service, retirement cause, and Tier.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods to be used for
 the  Preliminary Fiscal Year 2025 employer contributions of the impacted
 retirement systems. In addition:
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-

 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  * Future contribution impacts have been developed assuming a homogene-
 ous population and consistent retirement pattern.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
