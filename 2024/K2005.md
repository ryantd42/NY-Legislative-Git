BY: M. of A. Buttenschon
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary of the World
  Series of Bocce on July 18, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to  commemorate
those  sporting  events  of  historical significance which add strength,
vigor and inspiration to the quality of life in the communities  of  the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of the World Series of Bocce, to be
celebrated during its renowned annual competition on Thursday,  July  18
to Sunday, July 21, 2024 at the Toccolana Club in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Growing  from humble beginnings, the World Series of Bocce
is held every third week in July in Rome, New York and  is  the  premier
event  in  the  bocce community, with teams travelling from all over the
Nation to compete for the prestigious title; and
 
  WHEREAS, A  harmonious  blend  of  culture,  youth  and  experience,
delicious  food,  lively  music,  intense  yet friendly competition, and
fellowship, the World Series of Bocce  attracts  tens  of  thousands  of
spectators  to  the Rome area and has generated significant revenue from
tourism for the local community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Historically played among Roman soldiers during  the  Roman
Empire's  wars  with  Carthage,  Bocce  has  been enjoyed by a myriad of
cultures throughout the centuries; the sport was  named  by  an  Italian
man,  Luigi Boccharini, who designed the first authentic balls made from
the wood of willow trees; and
 
  WHEREAS, Brought to the United States by Italian immigrants  in  the
early  20th  century,  the World Series of Bocce was first held in Rome,
New  York  when  former  Mayor,  Carl  Eilenberg,  teamed  with  bocce
enthusiast,  Cosimino  Costello,  to  create  and  host  a tournament to
attract the best players in the world; with the support of the  Facciolo
brothers,  Nick (Fox), Greg (D.A.), Joe (Scud), Tony (Cappie), and Frank
(Frankie) Facciolo, as well as Joe Taverna, Romeo Cecelia, and a host of
other volunteers, the inaugural World Series of Bocce was held  in  July
1974  at  the  John  F.  Kennedy  Arena  in  Rome,  NY  with  44 teams
participating; and
 
  WHEREAS, On December 23, 1974, the first World Series of  Bocce  was
featured  in  a  Sports  Illustrated article written by Jeannette Bruce;
this article brought national  attention  to  the  event  and  the  Rome
community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Reaching tremendous success, the World Series of Bocce now
welcomes over 168 teams, 128 in the Open Division and another 40 in  the
Women's  Division;  it  is broadcasted nationwide on the Bocce Broadcast
Network and is the subject of a documentary to  be  released  this  year
produced  by  local  filmmakers,  called  "The  World Series of Bocce: A
Celebration of Sport, Family and Community"; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
sporting events  which  enhance  the  well-being  and  vitality  of  its
community  and  have shown a long and sustained commitment to excellence
certainly have earned the recognition and applause of all  the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the World Series of  Bocce  on  July
18, 2024 to July 21, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the World Series of Bocce Organizing Committee.
