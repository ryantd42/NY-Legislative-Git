BY: Senator STEC
 
  COMMENDING  Eric VanAuken upon the occasion of his
  designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Eric VanAuken upon the occasion of his designation as  recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Thursday, August 1, 2024, Eric  VanAuken  gathered  with
his  fellow employees on the dock at the Lake George Club located on the
shore of Lake George; Eric  VanAuken  had  decided  to  go  for  a  swim
following  his  shift,  and invited a coworker to the waterfront to join
him; and
 
  WHEREAS, Suddenly and inexplicably, his coworker, who does not  know
how  to  swim, dove into the water, rising to the surface immediately in
need of  assistance;  Eric  VanAuken  sprang  into  action,  immediately
attempting  to aid the struggling individual, but was not successful due
to the victim's thrashing attempts to keep afloat; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Lake  George  Club  sailing  instructor,  Brandon
Gruttemeyer,  immediately  leapt  into  action  to find a flashlight; he
rushed back  to  the  scene  and  was  able  to  locate  the  struggling
individual; the victim was found under 10-12 feet of water; and
 
  WHEREAS, Eric VanAuken and Brandon Gruttemeyer were able to pull the
individual  in  need  from  the  water,  and  began  administering  CPR
compressions as well as mouth-to-mouth maneuvers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Emergency medical  service  professionals  arrived  at  the
scene and were able to get the victim to a point of stabilized breathing
with a strong pulse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Once  at Glens Falls Hospital, the condition of the victim
began  decreasing  and  destabilizing  rapidly,  causing  the  immediate
transfer of the individual to Albany Medical Center where an expert team
of  specially  trained healthcare professionals utilized equipment known
as an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  machine;  this  decision  was
paramount to ensuring the individual's opportunity for recovery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The victim showed signs of great improvement over the days
following the incident, sitting  up,  smiling,  and  responding  to  his
father's  voice;  the likes of which were able to occur due to the swift
and lifesaving efforts of Eric VanAuken that night; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  truly  brave and courageous man, Eric VanAuken played a
vital role in this extraordinary rescue effort, and should be praised by
the people of this great Empire State for his astute actions in  working
to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Eric  VanAuken,  in his spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated his character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without  thought of danger or reward when others are in need of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Eric VanAuken upon the occasion of his designation as recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Eric VanAuken.
