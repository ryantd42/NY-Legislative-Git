  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the
  Cazenovia Area Volunteer Ambulance Corps on March 2,
  2024
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
applaud outstanding individuals within our communities whose actions and
accomplishments  contribute  to the health, safety and well-being of the
communities of the State of New York and to the quality of life  of  its
people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the  Cazenovia  Area  Volunteer
Ambulance Corps; this momentous occasion was celebrated with  a  Banquet
on  Saturday,  March  2, 2024, at the Hampton Inn & Suites in Cazenovia,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of the visionaries who laid  the  foundation
of the Cazenovia Area Volunteer Ambulance Corps (CAVAC) a half a century
ago,  special  recognition  was given to its founding members, including
active  charter  members  Tom  Davies,  1974-1995,  2022-present;  Peter
Diefendorf,  1974-2001,  2012-present;  Bryan  Ramsay,  1974-1995,
1997-present; and John Stephenson, 1974-1982, 1996-present; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established in 1974  and  currently  based  at  106  Nelson
Street,  Cazenovia  Area  Volunteer  Ambulance Corps relies on volunteer
drivers, crew coordinators, emergency medical  technicians  (EMTs),  and
general  members, as well as paid professional paramedics; a high school
student corps also supports its operations; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to providing emergency medical  services  (EMS)
to  Cazenovia and surrounding communities, CAVAC offers short-term loans
of medical equipment, such as crutches, walkers,  and  wheelchairs,  and
has a New York State-certified child/baby car seat installer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  organization is led by the CAVAC Executive Committee,
which currently consists of Kerstin McKay, president;  Ron  Scott,  vice
president  and  student  corps  advisor;  Niki Ammann, secretary; Dennis
Goldmann, treasurer; Rick Macheda, chief of operations;  Chris  Marconi,
ombudsman;  John  McCabe, medical director; and Sara Mitchell, immediate
past president; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2023, this vital  ambulance  service  responded  to  958
calls;  ensuring  the  local  community is covered 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, 52 weeks a year takes commitment and dedication  from  many
people,  including  its  paramedics,  EMTs,  and  drivers who respond to
neighbors in need; its crew coordinators  and  operational  members  who
keep  CAVAC running, organized, and on track; its intrepid student corps
who bravely tackle the challenge of learning  about  EMS;  and  all  the
family members who encourage its members; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  five  decades, the Cazenovia Area Volunteer Ambulance
Corps has provided dedicated and professional Emergency Medical Services
 
to the Town of Cazenovia, Town of Fenner, Town of Nelson, the Village of
Cazenovia, and the surrounding areas of Madison County; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion presents an opportunity for this
Legislative Body to recognize and pay  tribute  to  the  Cazenovia  Area
Volunteer Ambulance Corps; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility their own by
serving their local Ambulance Corps; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the  Cazenovia  Area  Volunteer
Ambulance Corps on March 2, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Cazenovia Area Volunteer Ambulance Corps.
