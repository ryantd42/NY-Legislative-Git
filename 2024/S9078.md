  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law, Giuseppe T.
 Rosini, a member of the New York state and local police and fire retire-
 ment system, who was employed in October 2004, by the Wading River  Fire

 state and local police and fire retirement  system  until  December  15,
 2014,  which gave him Tier VI status instead of Tier II status, where he
 would have been had he been able to file a membership  application  when
 he  became  an  employee  in October 2004 may be deemed to have become a
 member of the New York state and local police and fire retirement system
 on October 25, 2004 if, within one year of the effective  date  of  this
 act,  he shall file with the state comptroller a written request to that

 current Tier 6 member of the NYSLPFRS employed by the Town of Riverhead,
 by  changing  their  date of membership to October 25, 2004. Giuseppe T.

 Retirement System, beginning October 2004. There will be  no  refund  of
 member contributions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $23,000 in the
 annual contributions of the Town of Riverhead for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the billing rates
 and salary of Giuseppe T. Rosini change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $24,100  which  will  be
 borne  by  the  Wading  River  Fire District as a one-time payment. This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
