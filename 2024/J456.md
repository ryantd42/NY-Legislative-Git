  HONORING  Mary  Cheng  upon  the  occasion  of her
  designation as recipient of the PASEsetter Award  by
  the  Partnership  for  After  School  Education  on
  February 28, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare of the  community
and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Mary Cheng upon the occasion of her  designation  as  recipient  of  the
PASEsetter  Award  by  the Partnership for After School Education at its
30th Anniversary PASEsetter Awards  Benefit  on  Tuesday,  February  28,
2023, at Cipriani, New York, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mary Cheng is receiving this prestigious award for her role
as  an  afterschool educator whose commitment, energy and creativity has
had an indelible impact on the children and youth of New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS, PASE is a  child-focused  organization  that  promotes  and
supports  quality afterschool programs, particularly those serving young
people from underserved communities; Mary Cheng truly  exemplifies  this
vital  organization's  mission  of  delivering  consistent, high-quality
programming to youth and increases their capacity to meet the  needs  of
their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a  first-generation immigrant growing up in Chinatown,
Mary Cheng did not always feel like she fit in at  school;  after  being
accepted  into the Chinese-American Planning Council's (CPC) afterschool
program, she discovered the joy of learning while  being  surrounded  by
teachers and fellow students she could relate to; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  staff  at  CPC  also  helped  Mary  Cheng's family by
connecting  them  with  translated  information  and  valuable  public
resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary  Cheng  earned  her  bachelor's  degree in Elementary
Education from the City College of New  York,  followed  by  a  master's
degree  in Childhood Education from Hunter College; she then returned to
CPC and began working as a teacher; and
 
  WHEREAS, For seven years, Mary Cheng was head teacher at  Chung  Pak
Day Care Center, followed by seven years as site director of Little Star
of  Broome  Street  Early Childhood Center; in 2018, she was promoted to
her current role as Director of Childhood Development Services; and
 
  WHEREAS, In this capacity, Mary  Cheng  oversees  the  agency's  six
early  childhood centers and six afterschool programs located throughout
Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, serving over 1,300 children every year;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary  Cheng  goes  out  of her way to train and mentor all
teachers and staff at the centers, and to bond with as many students and
families as possible; she cooks for  the  staff  at  Little  Star  every
Friday,  and  has organized cooking classes for parents of the students,
turkey drives and homemade Thanksgiving dinners for many families during
the holiday season; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mary Cheng diligently  worked
to  keep  Little  Star  open  and repurposed it as a regional enrichment
center for the community, providing programming  and  support  during  a
strange and isolating time; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary Cheng also recruited staff to support the children of
essential workers who were a part of CPC, and  organized  COVID  vaccine
clinics for parents and staff; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each and every day, Mary Cheng strives to ensure the people
around  her  feel loved and supported; for her steadfast and unremitting
commitment to those individuals, she was named a 2017 Unsung Hero by the
Care Council of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Mary Cheng upon the occasion of her designation  as  recipient  of
the  PASEsetter Award by the Partnership for After School Education; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Mary Cheng.
