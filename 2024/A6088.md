 AN  ACT to amend the elder law, in relation to reports by the office for
  the aging regarding assistance to  families  for  caring  for  elderly
  dependents;  and  to  amend  the  tax law, in relation to providing an
  additional personal income tax exemption for resident  individuals  in

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  existing  programs to encourage the elderly to remain in
 their own homes or the homes of caring relatives, including the informal
 caregivers and respite programs, as  well  as  other  programs  provided
 under  the auspices of the state office for the aging to provide assist-
 ance to families to care for their elderly, could  be  enhanced  by  the
 provision  of  an  additional incentive to families to further stimulate
 the retention of the elderly at home and that limited  financial  relief
 to  families offered in conjunction with existing programs, would result
 in closer familial ties and a more satisfactory life for our elderly.
  The legislature further finds and declares that the creation, enhance-
 ment and stimulation of such programs is to the benefit of the public as
 well as to the individual family, and that  such  creation,  enhancement
 and  stimulation  aid  in maintaining the dignity and quality of life of
 aged and elderly persons.
  The legislature additionally finds and declares that such creation  of
 programs  and  enhancement  of  other existing programs should include a
 recognition of the financial commitment and obligation  of  the  family,
 and  that  the  state has a moral obligation to be of assistance in such
 situations, and that although the state can in no manner place a  finan-
 cial value on the provision of assistance by a family to its elderly and

 aged  relatives,  the  state  can and should recognize that such efforts
 inure not only to the family's but also the general public's good.
