 YEARS OF TOTAL CREDITABLE SERVICE OR UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF  AGE  SIXTY-

  (I) UPON COMPLETION OF TWENTY YEARS OF SUCH SERVICE AND  UPON  RETIRE-
 MENT, EACH SUCH MEMBER SHALL RECEIVE A PENSION SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE HIM

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  create  Article  14-C in the New York State (State)
 Retirement and Social Security Law, covering any State correction  offi-
 cer  or  State  employee  engaged directly in correction officer duties,
 which provides a retirement benefit equal to 50% of final average salary
 after 20 years of service. If  the  legislature  elects,  members  would
 become  eligible  for  additional 60ths for service beyond 20 years. All
 service rendered as a State correction officer, a member or  officer  of
 the State police, a paid firefighter, a police officer, or an officer of
 any organized fire department or police force is creditable. The retire-
 ment benefit is not to exceed 75% of final average salary.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that there will be an increase in the annual contributions of the
 State of New York of approximately $48 million for the 20-year  plan  or
 $61  million  for  the 20-year plan with additional 60ths for the fiscal
 year ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as  the
 billing rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service  cost of approximately $697 million for the
 20-year plan or $1.29 billion for  the  20-plan  with  additional  60ths
 which will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
 S. 6165  4
 
  These estimated costs are based on 18,387 affected members employed by
 the  State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $1.6 billion
 as of March 31, 2022.
  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  plan qualification issues: granting
 correction officers service credit towards retirement in a 20-year  plan
 could  jeopardize  the  Retirement System's governmental plan status and
 its exemption from ERISA. This could result in  the  loss  of  qualified
 status, which would mean the loss of tax benefits and would substantial-
 ly  impair  the  Retirement  System's value to our more than one million
 participants.
  Prior to the enactment of this legislation, we recommend that a favor-
 able ruling be obtained from the IRS stating that these provisions would
 not harm the qualification status of the Retirement System. It is  esti-
 mated  that  the  costs to obtain such a ruling would be $38,000 for the
 services of the IRS, and $1,000 per hour for legal consultants.
