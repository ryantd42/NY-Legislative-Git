 SUBDIVISION  NINE-A OF THIS SECTION GOVERNING THE PROVISION OF FINANCIAL

  § 2.  Subdivision 9-a of section 2807-k of the public health  law,  as
 added by section 39-a of part A of chapter 57 of the laws of 2006, para-
 graph  (k) as added by section 43 of part B of chapter 58 of the laws of

 seven-w of this article for periods on  and  after  January  first,  two
 thousand  nine,  general  hospitals  shall, effective for periods on and

 ASSISTANCE policies and procedures, in accordance with the provisions of
 this  subdivision, for reducing HOSPITAL charges otherwise applicable to
 low-income individuals [without health insurance, or who have  exhausted
 their  health  insurance benefits, and] who can demonstrate an inability
 to pay full charges, and also, at the hospital's discretion, for  reduc-
 ing  or  discounting  the  collection of co-pays and deductible payments
 from those individuals who can demonstrate  an  inability  to  pay  such
 amounts.  IMMIGRATION  STATUS  SHALL NOT BE AN ELIGIBILITY CRITERION FOR
 THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS SECTION.
  (II) A GENERAL HOSPITAL MAY USE THE NEW YORK STATE OF  HEALTH  MARKET-
 PLACE  ELIGIBILITY  DETERMINATION PAGE TO ESTABLISH THE PATIENT'S HOUSE-
 HOLD INCOME AND RESIDENCY IN LIEU OF  THE  FINANCIAL  APPLICATION  FORM,
 PROVIDED  IT  HAS SECURED THE CONSENT OF THE PATIENT. A GENERAL HOSPITAL
 SHALL NOT REQUIRE A PATIENT TO APPLY FOR COVERAGE THROUGH THE  NEW  YORK
 STATE  OF  HEALTH  MARKETPLACE  IN  ORDER  TO  RECEIVE CARE OR FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE.
  (III) UPON SUBMISSION OF A COMPLETED APPLICATION FORM, THE PATIENT  IS
 NOT  LIABLE  FOR  ANY BILLS AND NO INTEREST MAY ACCRUE UNTIL THE GENERAL
 HOSPITAL HAS RENDERED A DECISION ON THE APPLICATION IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH
 THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (b)  [Such]  THE  reductions  from  charges  for  [uninsured] patients
 DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION with  incomes  below  [at
 least  three]  SIX  hundred  percent  of the federal poverty level shall
 result in a charge to such individuals that does not exceed [the greater
 of] the amount that would have been paid for the same services  [by  the
 "highest  volume payor" for such general hospital as defined in subpara-
 graph (v) of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to  title
 XVIII  of  the  federal social security act (medicare), or for services]
 provided pursuant to title [XIX] XVIII of the  federal  social  security
 act (medicaid), and provided further that such [amounts] AMOUNT shall be
 adjusted according to income level as follows:
  (i)  For  patients with incomes at or below [at least one] TWO hundred
 percent of the federal poverty level, the  hospital  shall  [collect  no
 more  than  a  nominal payment amount, consistent with guidelines estab-
 lished by the commissioner] WAIVE ALL CHARGES. NO NOMINAL PAYMENT  SHALL
 BE COLLECTED;
  (ii)  For  patients  with  incomes  [between  at  least one] ABOVE TWO
 hundred [one] percent and [one] UP TO FOUR hundred  [fifty]  percent  of
 the  federal  poverty level, the hospital shall collect no more than the
 amount identified after application of a proportional sliding fee sched-
 A. 6027--A  3
 
 ule under which patients with lower incomes shall pay the lowest amount.
 [Such] THE schedule shall provide  that  the  amount  the  hospital  may
 collect  for  [such  patients]  THE  PATIENT  increases from the nominal
 amount  described  in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph in equal incre-
 ments as the income of the patient increases, up to a maximum of  twenty
 percent of the [greater of the] amount that would have been paid for the
 same  services [by the "highest volume payor" for such general hospital,
 as defined in subparagraph  (v)  of  this  paragraph,  or  for  services
 provided  pursuant  to  title  XVIII  of the federal social security act
 (medicare) or for services] provided pursuant to title  [XIX]  XVIII  of
 the federal social security act (medicaid);
  (iii)  [For  patients with incomes between at least one hundred fifty-
 one percent and two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty  level,
 the  hospital  shall  collect  no  more than the amount identified after
 application of a proportional sliding fee schedule under which  patients
 with  lower  income  shall  pay  the lowest amounts. Such schedule shall
 provide that the amount the  hospital  may  collect  for  such  patients
 increases  from the twenty percent figure described in subparagraph (ii)
 of this paragraph in equal increments  as  the  income  of  the  patient
 increases,  up to a maximum of the greater of the amount that would have
 been paid for the same services by the "highest volume payor"  for  such
 general  hospital,  as defined in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or
 for services provided pursuant to title  XVIII  of  the  federal  social
 security  act  (medicare) or for services provided pursuant to title XIX
 of the federal social security act (medicaid); and
  (iv)] For patients with incomes [between at least two  hundred  fifty-
 one  percent and three hundred] ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT AND UP TO SIX
 HUNDRED percent of the federal poverty level, the hospital shall collect
 no more than the [greater of the] amount that would have been  paid  for
 the same services [by the "highest volume payor" for such general hospi-
 tal  as  defined  in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, or for services
 provided pursuant to title XVIII of  the  federal  social  security  act
 (medicare),  or  for services] provided pursuant to title [XIX] XVIII of
 the federal social security act (medicaid).
  [(v) For the purposes of this paragraph, "highest volume payor"  shall
 mean  the  insurer,  corporation  or organization licensed, organized or
 certified pursuant to article thirty-two, forty-two  or  forty-three  of
 the insurance law or article forty-four of this chapter, or other third-
 party  payor,  which  has  a  contract  or  agreement  to pay claims for
 services provided by the  general  hospital  and  incurred  the  highest
 volume of claims in the previous calendar year.
  (vi)  A  hospital may implement policies and procedures to permit, but
 not require, consideration on a case-by-case basis of exceptions to  the
 requirements  described  in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph
 based upon the existence of significant assets owned by the patient that
 should be taken into account  in  determining  the  appropriate  payment
 amount  for  that  patient's care, provided, however, that such proposed
 policies and procedures  shall  be  subject  to  the  prior  review  and
 approval  of the commissioner and, if approved, shall be included in the
 hospital's financial assistance  policy  established  pursuant  to  this
 section,  and  provided  further  that, if such approval is granted, the
 maximum amount that may be collected shall not exceed the greater of the
 amount that would have been paid for the same services by  the  "highest
 volume  payor"  for such general hospital as defined in subparagraph (v)
 of this paragraph, or for services provided pursuant to title  XVIII  of
 the  federal  social  security  act (medicare), or for services provided
 A. 6027--A  4

 pursuant to title XIX of the federal social security act (medicaid).  In
 the  event  that a general hospital reviews a patient's assets in deter-
 mining payment  adjustments  such  policies  and  procedures  shall  not
 consider  as assets a patient's primary residence, assets held in a tax-
 deferred or  comparable  retirement  savings  account,  college  savings
 accounts,  or  cars  used  regularly  by  a  patient or immediate family
 members.
  (vii)] (C) Nothing in this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION shall be  construed
 to  limit  a  hospital's  ability  to  establish patient eligibility for
 payment discounts at income levels higher than  those  specified  herein
 and/or  to  provide greater payment discounts for eligible patients than
 those required by this [paragraph] SUBDIVISION.
  [(c)] (D) Such policies and procedures shall be clear, understandable,
 in writing and publicly available in summary  form  [and  each].  EACH
 general  hospital  participating  in  the  pool  shall ensure that every
 patient is made aware of the existence of [such] THE policies and proce-
 dures and is provided, in a timely manner, with a summary AND A COPY  of
 [such  policies  and  procedures  upon  request]  THE POLICY AND FORM AT
 INTAKE, ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE.  Any  summary  provided  to  patients
 shall, at a minimum, include, IN PLAIN LANGUAGE, specific information as
 to  income  levels  used  to  determine  eligibility  for assistance, [a
 description of the primary  service  area  of  the  hospital]  FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE  AVAILABLE  and  the  means  of applying for assistance. [For
 general hospitals with  twenty-four  hour  emergency  departments,  such
 policies  and  procedures]  A  PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY OF THE COLLECTIONS
 PROCESS MUST ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE. A GENERAL HOSPITAL  shall  [require
 the notification of patients] NOTIFY PATIENTS BY PROVIDING WRITTEN MATE-
 RIALS  TO PATIENTS OR THEIR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES during the intake
 and registration process, BY MAKING MATERIALS AVAILABLE  IN  CONSPICUOUS
 LOCATIONS IN THE HOSPITAL INCLUDING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, WAITING AREAS
 AND OTHER PLACES PATIENTS CONGREGATE, through the conspicuous posting of
 language-appropriate information in the general hospital, and BY INCLUD-
 ING information on bills and statements sent to patients, that financial
 [aid]  ASSISTANCE  may  be  available  to  qualified patients and how to
 obtain further information. [For specialty hospitals without twenty-four
 hour emergency departments, such notification shall take  place  through
 written  materials  provided to patients during the intake and registra-
 tion process prior to the provision  of  any  health  care  services  or
 procedures,  and  through  information  on  bills and statements sent to
 patients, that financial aid may be available to qualified patients  and
 how to obtain further information. Application materials shall include a
 notice  to  patients  that  upon  submission of a completed application,
 including any information  or  documentation  needed  to  determine  the
 patient's  eligibility  pursuant  to the hospital's financial assistance
 policy, the patient may disregard  any  bills  until  the  hospital  has
 rendered  a  decision  on  the application in accordance with this para-
 graph] GENERAL HOSPITALS SHALL POST THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION
 POLICY, PROCEDURES AND FORM, AND A SUMMARY OF THE POLICY AND  PROCEDURES
 AND  COLLECTION PROCESS, IN A CONSPICUOUS LOCATION AND DOWNLOADABLE FORM
 ON THE GENERAL HOSPITAL'S WEBSITE.
  [(d) Such] (E) THE HOSPITAL'S APPLICATION MATERIALS  SHALL  INCLUDE  A
 NOTICE TO PATIENTS THAT UPON SUBMISSION OF A COMPLETED APPLICATION FORM,
 THE PATIENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY BILLS UNTIL THE GENERAL HOSPITAL
 HAS  RENDERED  A  DECISION  ON  THE  APPLICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
 SUBDIVISION.  THE APPLICATION MATERIALS SHALL INCLUDE SPECIFIC  INFORMA-
 TION  AS  THE  INCOME LEVELS USED TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL
 A. 6027--A  5
 
 ASSISTANCE, A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA  OF  THE  HOSPITAL
 AND THE MEANS TO APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE. NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL
 BE  CONSTRUED  AS PRECLUDING THE USE OF PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY DETERMI-
 NATIONS  BY HOSPITALS ON BEHALF OF PATIENTS. THE policies and procedures
 shall include clear, objective  criteria  for  determining  a  patient's
 ability  to  pay  and for providing such adjustments to payment require-
 ments as are necessary. In addition to  adjustment  mechanisms  such  as
 sliding  fee  schedules  and discounts to fixed standards, such policies
 and procedures shall also provide for the use of installment  plans  for
 the  payment  of  outstanding  balances  by  patients  pursuant  to  the
 provisions of the hospital's financial assistance  policy.  The  monthly
 payment  under  such  a  plan shall not exceed [ten] FIVE percent of the
 gross monthly income of the patient[, provided, however, that if patient
 assets are considered under such a policy, then patient assets which are
 not excluded assets pursuant to subparagraph (vi) of  paragraph  (b)  of
 this  subdivision  may be considered in addition to the limit on monthly
 payments]. INSTALLMENT PLAN PAYMENTS MAY NOT BE REQUIRED TO BEGIN BEFORE
 ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE DATE  OF  THE  SERVICE  OR  DISCHARGE,
 WHICHEVER  IS LATER. THE POLICY SHALL ALLOW THE PATIENT AND THE HOSPITAL
 TO MUTUALLY AGREE TO MODIFY THE TERMS OF AN INSTALLMENT PLAN.  The  rate
 of  interest charged to the patient on the unpaid balance, if any, shall
 not exceed [the rate for a ninety-day  security  issued  by  the  United
 States  Department of Treasury, plus .5 percent] TWO PERCENTUM PER ANNUM
 and no plan shall include an accelerator or similar clause under which a
 higher rate of interest is triggered upon a missed payment.  [If  such]
 THE policies and procedures SHALL NOT include a requirement of a deposit
 prior to [non-emergent,] medically-necessary care[, such deposit must be
 included  as  part  of  any financial aid consideration].  THE HOSPITAL
 SHALL REFUND ANY PAYMENTS MADE BY THE PATIENT BEFORE  THE  DETERMINATION
 OF  ELIGIBILITY  FOR  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  THAT  EXCEEDS THE PATIENT'S
 LIABILITY AFTER DISCOUNTS ARE  APPLIED.  Such  policies  and  procedures
 shall be applied consistently to all eligible patients.
  [(e) Such policies and procedures shall permit patients to] (F) IN ANY
 LEGAL  ACTION  BY  OR ON BEHALF OF A HOSPITAL TO COLLECT A MEDICAL DEBT,
 THE COMPLAINT SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN  AFFIDAVIT  BY  THE  HOSPITAL'S
 CHIEF  FINANCIAL  OFFICER STATING THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS TAKEN REASONABLE
 STEPS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT QUALIFIES FOR  FINANCIAL  ASSIST-
 ANCE  AND  UPON  INFORMATION  AND  BELIEF  THE PATIENT DOES NOT MEET THE
 INCOME OR RESIDENCY CRITERIA  FOR  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE.  PATIENTS  MAY
 apply  for FINANCIAL assistance [within at least ninety days of the date
 of discharge or date of service and provide at  least  twenty  days  for
 patients  to  submit  a  completed  application]  AT ANY TIME DURING THE
 COLLECTION PROCESS, INCLUDING AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF A  MEDICAL  DEBT
 COURT  ACTION  OR  UPON  THE  PLAINTIFF OBTAINING A DEFAULT JUDGMENT.  A
 DETERMINATION THAT A PATIENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  SHALL
 BE  VALID FOR A MINIMUM OF TWELVE MONTHS AND WILL APPLY TO ALL OUTSTAND-
 ING MEDICAL BILLS. A HOSPITAL MAY USE CREDIT SCORING  SOFTWARE  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES  OF  ESTABLISHING  INCOME  ELIGIBILITY  AND APPROVING FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE, BUT ONLY IF THE HOSPITAL MAKES CLEAR  TO  THE  PATIENT  THAT
 PROVIDING A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS NOT MANDATORY AND THE SCORING DOES
 NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PATIENT'S CREDIT SCORE.  HOWEVER, CREDIT SCOR-
 ING  SOFTWARE SHALL NOT BE SOLELY RELIED UPON BY THE HOSPITAL IN DENYING
 A PATIENT'S APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FURTHER, PROPENSITY TO
 PAY SCORES MAY NOT DISQUALIFY PATIENTS WHO OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR  ELIGI-
 BILITY  FROM  RECEIVING  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE.  [Such] THE policies and
 procedures [may require that]  SHALL  ALLOW  patients  seeking  [payment
 A. 6027--A  6

 adjustments] FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO provide [appropriate] THE FOLLOWING
 financial  information  and  documentation  in support of their applica-
 tion[, provided, however, that such application  process  shall  not  be
 unduly  burdensome  or  complex]:  PAY CHECKS OR PAY STUBS; UNEMPLOYMENT
 DOCUMENTATION; SOCIAL SECURITY INCOME; RENT RECEIPTS; A LETTER FROM  THE
 PATIENT'S  EMPLOYER  ATTESTING TO THE PATIENT'S GROSS INCOME; DOCUMENTA-
 TION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER MEANS-TESTED GOVERNMENT BENEFITS;  OR,  IF
 NONE  OF THE AFOREMENTIONED INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION ARE AVAILABLE,
 A WRITTEN SELF-ATTESTATION OF THE PATIENT'S INCOME MAY BE USED.  General
 hospitals  [shall,  upon  request,] MUST TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO assist
 patients in understanding the hospital's APPLICATION AND FORM,  policies
 and  procedures  and  in  applying  for payment adjustments. Application
 forms shall be printed  AND  POSTED  TO  ITS  WEBSITE  in  the  "primary
 languages"  of patients served by the general hospital. For the purposes
 of this paragraph, "primary languages" shall include any  language  that
 is  either  (i)  used  to  communicate,  during at least five percent of
 patient visits in a year, by patients who cannot speak, read,  write  or
 understand  the  English  language at the level of proficiency necessary
 for effective communication with health care providers, or  (ii)  spoken
 by  [non-English]  LIMITED-ENGLISH  speaking individuals comprising more
 than one percent of the primary hospital  service  area  population,  as
 calculated  using  demographic  information  available  from  the United
 States Bureau of the Census, supplemented by data from  school  systems.
 Decisions  regarding  such applications shall be made within thirty days
 of receipt of a completed application. [Such] THE  policies  and  proce-
 dures shall require that the hospital issue any [denial/approval] DENIAL
 OR  APPROVAL of [such] THE application in writing WHICH CLEARLY COMMUNI-
 CATES THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE GRANTED,  ANY  AMOUNTS  STILL  OWED  with
 information on how to appeal the [denial] DECISION and shall require the
 hospital  to  establish  an appeals process under which it will evaluate
 the [denial of] DECISION ABOUT an application. [Nothing in this subdivi-
 sion shall be interpreted as prohibiting  a  hospital  from  making  the
 availability  of  financial assistance contingent upon the patient first
 applying for coverage under title XIX of the social security act  (medi-
 caid)  or another insurance program if, in the judgment of the hospital,
 the patient may be eligible for medicaid or another  insurance  program,
 and upon the patient's cooperation in following the hospital's financial
 assistance application requirements, including the provision of informa-
 tion  needed  to  make  a  determination on the patient's application in
 accordance with the hospital's financial assistance policy]  NOTHING  IN
 THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL PREVENT A HOSPITAL FROM INFORMING AND ASSISTING A
 PATIENT  WITH  AN APPLICATION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH A LOCAL
 SERVICES DISTRICT OR THE MARKETPLACE. A  HOSPITAL  SHALL  NOT  MAKE  THE
 AVAILABILITY  OF  FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  CONTINGENT  UPON  THE PATIENT'S
 APPLICATION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.  THE HOSPITAL  SHALL  INFORM
 PATIENTS  ON  HOW  TO  FILE  A  COMPLAINT AGAINST THE HOSPITAL OR A DEBT
 COLLECTOR THAT IS CONTRACTED ON BEHALF OF  THE  HOSPITAL  REGARDING  THE
 PATIENT'S BILL.  GENERAL HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE REASONABLE MEAS-
 URES  TO  DETERMINE IF A PATIENT  IS  ELIGIBLE  FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
 INCLUDING PRIOR TO MAKING A REFERRAL TO A THIRD-PARTY DEBT COLLECTOR  OR
 OTHER EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTIONS MEASURES.
  [(f) Such] (G) THE policies and procedures shall provide that patients
 with  incomes  below  [three] SIX hundred percent of the federal poverty
 level are deemed [presumptively] eligible for  payment  adjustments  and
 shall  conform  to  the  requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this
 subdivision, provided, however, that nothing in this  subdivision  shall
 A. 6027--A  7
 
 be  interpreted  as  precluding  hospitals  from  extending such payment
 adjustments to other patients, either generally  or  on  a  case-by-case
 basis.  [Such  policies  and  procedures shall provide financial aid for
 emergency  hospital  services, including emergency transfers pursuant to
 the federal emergency medical treatment and active  labor  act  (42  USC
 1395dd),  to  patients  who  reside  in New York state and for medically
 necessary hospital services for patients who reside  in  the  hospital's
 primary  service area as determined according to criteria established by
 the commissioner. In developing such criteria,  the  commissioner  shall
 consult  with  representatives  of  the  hospital  industry, health care
 consumer advocates and local  public  health  officials.  Such  criteria
 shall  be made available to the public no less than thirty days prior to
 the date of implementation and shall, at a minimum:
  (i) prohibit a  hospital  from  developing  or  altering  its  primary
 service  area in a manner designed to avoid medically underserved commu-
 nities or communities with high percentages of uninsured residents;
  (ii) ensure that every geographic area of the state is included in  at
 least  one  general  hospital's  primary  service  area so that eligible
 patients may access care and financial assistance; and
  (iii) require the hospital to notify the commissioner upon making  any
 change  to its primary service area, and to include a description of its
 primary service area in  the  hospital's  annual  implementation  report
 filed  pursuant  to  subdivision  three  of section twenty-eight hundred
 three-l of this article.
  (g) Nothing in this subdivision shall  be  interpreted  as  precluding
 hospitals  from  extending  payment  adjustments for medically necessary
 non-emergency hospital services to patients outside  of  the  hospital's
 primary service area.] For patients determined to be eligible for finan-
 cial  [aid]  ASSISTANCE  under the terms of a hospital's financial [aid]
 ASSISTANCE policy, [such] THE policies and procedures shall prohibit any
 limitations on financial [aid] ASSISTANCE  for  services  based  on  the
 medical  condition  of  the applicant, other than typical limitations or
 exclusions based on medical necessity or  the  clinical  or  therapeutic
 benefit of a procedure or treatment.
  (h)  [Such  policies  and  procedures  shall  not permit the forced] A
 HOSPITAL OR ITS AGENT SHALL NOT ISSUE, AUTHORIZE  OR  PERMIT  AN  INCOME
 EXECUTION  OF  A PATIENT'S WAGES, SECURE A LIEN OR FORCE A sale or fore-
 closure of  a  patient's  primary  residence  in  order  to  collect  an
 outstanding medical bill and shall [require the hospital to refrain from
 sending]  NOT SEND an account to collection if the patient has submitted
 a completed application  for  financial  [aid,  including  any  required
 supporting  documentation] ASSISTANCE, while the hospital determines the
 patient's eligibility for [such aid] FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  [Such]  THE
 policies  and  procedures  shall provide for written notification, which
 shall include notification on a patient bill, to a patient not less than
 thirty days prior to the referral of  debts  for  collection  and  shall
 require that the collection agency obtain the hospital's written consent
 prior  to  commencing a legal action. [Such] THE policies and procedures
 shall require all general hospital staff who interact with  patients  or
 have  responsibility for billing and collections to be trained in [such]
 THE policies and procedures, and require the implementation of  a  mech-
 anism for the general hospital to measure its compliance with [such] THE
 policies  and  procedures.  [Such]  THE  policies and procedures shall
 require that any collection agency, LAWYER OR FIRM under contract with a
 general hospital for the  collection  of  debts  follow  the  hospital's
 financial assistance policy, including providing information to patients
 A. 6027--A  8
 
 on  how  to apply for financial assistance where appropriate. [Such] THE
 policies and procedures shall prohibit collections from a patient who is
 determined to be eligible for medical assistance [pursuant to title  XIX
 of  the  federal social security act] UNDER TITLE ELEVEN OF ARTICLE FIVE
 OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW at the time services were  rendered  and  for
 which services medicaid payment is available.

 paragraph one of this subdivision,] that compliance with  this  subdivi-
 sion  is  a  condition of participation in pool distributions authorized
 pursuant to this section and section  twenty-eight  hundred  seven-w  of
 this  article, then such condition of participation shall be deemed null
 and void [and, notwithstanding]. NOTWITHSTANDING section twelve of  this
 chapter,  failure to comply with [the provisions of] this subdivision by
 a GENERAL hospital [on and after the date of such  determination]  shall
 make  [such]  THE  hospital liable for a civil penalty not to exceed ten
 thousand dollars for each [such] violation. The imposition of [such] THE
 civil penalties shall be subject to [the provisions of] section twelve-a
 of this chapter.
  (M) A HOSPITAL OR ITS  COLLECTION  AGENTS  SHALL  NOT  REPORT  ADVERSE
 INFORMATION ABOUT A PATIENT TO A CONSUMER OR FINANCIAL REPORTING ENTITY.
 A  HOSPITAL  OR  ITS  COLLECTION AGENT SHALL NOT COMMENCE A CIVIL ACTION
 AGAINST A PATIENT OR DELEGATE A COLLECTION ACTIVITY TO A DEBT  COLLECTOR
 FOR  NONPAYMENT FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE FIRST POST-SERVICE
 BILL IS ISSUED AND UNTIL A  HOSPITAL  HAS  MADE  REASONABLE  EFFORTS  TO
 DETERMINE WHETHER A PATIENT QUALIFIES FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. A HOSPI-
 TAL  SHALL  NOT  COMMENCE A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST A PATIENT OR DELEGATE A
 COLLECTION ACTIVITY TO A DEBT COLLECTOR, IF: THE HOSPITAL  WAS  NOTIFIED
 THAT  AN  APPEAL  OR  A REVIEW OF A HEALTH INSURANCE DECISION IS PENDING
 WITHIN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SIXTY DAYS; OR THE PATIENT HAS A  PEND-
 ING APPLICATION FOR OR QUALIFIED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
  §  3.  Subdivision  9-a of section 2807-k of the public health law, as
 amended by section two of this act, is amended to read as follows:
  9-a. (a) (i) As a condition for participation  in  pool  distributions
 authorized  pursuant  to  this  section and section twenty-eight hundred
 seven-w of this article for periods on  and  after  January  first,  two
 thousand  nine,  general  hospitals  shall, effective for periods on and
 after January first, two thousand [seven, establish] TWENTY-FIVE,  ADOPT
 AND IMPLEMENT THE UNIFORM financial assistance [policies and procedures,
 in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision,] FORM AND POLICY,
 TO  BE DEVELOPED AND ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER. GENERAL HOSPITALS SHALL
 IMPLEMENT THE UNIFORM POLICY AND  FORM  for  reducing  hospital  charges
 otherwise  applicable  to  low-income individuals who can demonstrate an
 inability to pay full charges, and also, at the  hospital's  discretion,
 for  reducing  or  discounting  the collection of co-pays and deductible
 payments from those individuals who can demonstrate an inability to  pay
 such  amounts.  Immigration status shall not be an eligibility criterion
 for the purpose of determining financial assistance under this  section.
 AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "AFFILIATED PROVIDER" MEANS A PROVIDER THAT IS:
 (A)  EMPLOYED  BY THE HOSPITAL; (B) UNDER A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREE-
 MENT WITH THE HOSPITAL; OR (C) A CLINICAL FACULTY MEMBER  OF  A  MEDICAL
 SCHOOL  OR OTHER SCHOOL THAT TRAINS INDIVIDUALS TO BE PROVIDERS AND THAT
 IS AFFILIATED WITH THE HOSPITAL OR HEALTH SYSTEM.
 A. 6027--A  10
 
  (ii) A general hospital may use the New York state of  health  market-
 place  eligibility  determination page to establish the patient's house-
 hold income and residency in lieu of  the  financial  application  form,
 provided  it  has secured the consent of the patient. A general hospital
 shall  not  require a patient to apply for coverage through the New York
 state of health marketplace  in  order  to  receive  care  or  financial
 assistance.
  (iii)  Upon submission of a completed application form, the patient is
 not liable for any bills and no interest may accrue  until  the  general
 hospital  has  rendered a decision on the application in accordance with
 this subdivision.
  (b) The reductions from charges for patients  described  in  paragraph
 (a)  of  this  subdivision with incomes below six hundred percent of the
 federal poverty level shall result in a charge to such individuals  that
 does  not  exceed  the  amount  that  would  have been paid for the same
 services provided pursuant to title XVIII of the federal social security
 act (medicaid), and provided further that such amount shall be  adjusted
 according to income level as follows:
  (i)  For  patients with incomes at or below two hundred percent of the
 federal poverty level, the hospital shall waive all charges. No  nominal
 payment shall be collected;
  (ii)  For  patients  with  incomes above two hundred percent and up to
 four hundred percent of the federal poverty level,  the  hospital  shall
 collect  no  more  than  the  amount  identified  after application of a
 proportional sliding  fee  schedule  under  which  patients  with  lower
 incomes  shall  pay  the lowest amount.  The schedule shall provide that
 the amount the hospital may collect for the patient increases  from  the
 nominal  amount described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph in equal
 increments as the income of the patient increases, up to  a  maximum  of
 twenty  percent  of  the  amount  that would have been paid for the same
 services provided pursuant to title XVIII of the federal social security
 act (medicaid);
  (iii) For patients with incomes above four hundred percent and  up  to
 six  hundred  percent  of  the federal poverty level, the hospital shall
 collect no more than the amount that would have been paid for  the  same
 services provided pursuant to title XVIII of the federal social security
 act (medicaid).
  (c)  Nothing  in this subdivision shall be construed to limit a hospi-
 tal's ability to establish patient eligibility for payment discounts  at
 income  levels  higher  than  those  specified  herein and/or to provide
 greater payment discounts for eligible patients than those  required  by
 this subdivision.
  (d)  [Such  policies and procedures shall be clear, understandable, in
 writing and publicly available in summary form.] Each  general  hospital
 participating  in the pool shall ensure that every patient is made aware
 of the existence of [the policies and procedures] THE UNIFORM  FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE  FORM AND POLICY and is provided, in a timely manner, with [a
 summary and] a copy of the policy and  form  at  intake,  admission  and
 discharge.  [Any  summary  provided  to  patients shall, at a minimum,
 include, in plain language, specific information  as  to  income  levels
 used to determine eligibility for assistance, financial assitance avail-
 able and the means of applying for assistance.] A plain language summary
 of the collections process must also be made available. A general hospi-
 tal  shall notify patients by providing written materials to patients or
 their authorized representatives  during  the  intake  and  registration
 process,  by  making materials available in conspicuous locations in the
 A. 6027--A  11
 
 hospital including emergency departments, waiting areas and other places
 patients congregate, through the conspicuous posting of  language-appro-
 priate information in the general hospital, and by including information
 on  bills and statements sent to patients, that financial assistance may
 be available to qualified patients and how to  obtain  further  informa-
 tion.  General  hospitals  shall post the UNIFORM financial assistance
 application policy[, procedures] and form, and a summary of  the  policy
 [and  procedures]  and collection process, in a conspicuous location and
 downloadable form on the general hospital's  website.  THE  COMMISSIONER
 SHALL POST THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FORM AND POLICY IN DOWNLOAD-
 ABLE  FORM  ON  THE  DEPARTMENT'S HOSPITAL PROFILE PAGE OR ANY SUCCESSOR
 WEBSITE.
  (e) The [hospital's] COMMISSIONER SHALL PROVIDE APPLICATION  MATERIALS
 TO  GENERAL HOSPITALS, INCLUDING THE UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLI-
 CATION FORM AND POLICY. THESE  application  materials  shall  include  a
 notice to patients that upon submission of a completed application form,
 the patient shall not be liable for any bills until the general hospital
 has  rendered  a  decision  on  the  application in accordance with this
 subdivision.  The application materials shall include specific  informa-
 tion  as  the  income levels used to determine eligibility for financial
 assistance[, a description of the primary service area of the  hospital]
 and the means to apply for assistance. Nothing in this subdivision shall
 be  construed  as precluding the use of presumptive eligibility determi-
 nations by hospitals on behalf of patients.  The  [policies  and  proce-
 dures]  UNIFORM  APPLICATION FORM AND POLICY shall include clear, objec-
 tive criteria for  determining  a  patient's  ability  to  pay  and  for
 providing  such adjustments to payment requirements as are necessary. In
 addition to adjustment mechanisms such  as  sliding  fee  schedules  and
 discounts to fixed standards, [such policies and procedures] THE UNIFORM
 POLICY  shall  also  provide  for  the  use of installment plans for the
 payment of outstanding balances by patients [pursuant to the  provisions
 of  the  hospital's  financial  assistance  policy]. The monthly payment
 under such a plan shall not exceed five percent  of  the  gross  monthly
 income of the patient.  Installment plan payments may not be required to
 begin  before  one  hundred eighty days after the date of the service or
 discharge, whichever is later. The policy shall allow  the  patient  and
 the  hospital  to  mutually  agree to modify the terms of an installment
 plan.  The rate of interest  charged  to  the  patient  on  the  unpaid
 balance,  if  any,  shall not exceed two percentum per annum and no plan
 shall include an accelerator or similar clause under which a higher rate
 of interest is triggered upon a  missed  payment.  The  [policies  and
 procedures]  UNIFORM POLICY shall not include a requirement of a deposit
 prior to medically-necessary  care.  The  hospital  shall  refund  any
 payments made by the patient before the determination of eligibility for
 financial  assistance  that  exceeds  the  patient's  liability  after
 discounts are applied.  Such policies and procedures  shall  be  applied
 consistently to all eligible patients.
  (f)  In  any  legal  action by or on behalf of a hospital to collect a
 medical debt, the complaint shall be accompanied by an affidavit by  the
 hospital's  chief  financial officer stating that the hospital has taken
 reasonable steps to determine whether the patient qualifies  for  finan-
 cial  assistance  and  upon  information and belief the patient does not
 meet the income or residency criteria for financial assistance. Patients
 may apply for financial assistance at any  time  during  the  collection
 process, including after the commencement of a medical debt court action
 or  upon  the  plaintiff  obtaining a default judgment.  A determination
 A. 6027--A  12
 
 that a patient is eligible for financial assistance shall be valid for a
 minimum of twelve months and  will  apply  to  all  outstanding  medical
 bills.  A hospital may use credit scoring software for the purposes of
 establishing  income eligibility and approving financial assistance, but
 only if the hospital makes clear to the patient that providing a  social
 security  number  is  not  mandatory and the scoring does not negatively
 impact the patient's credit score.  However,  credit  scoring  software
 shall  not  be solely relied upon by the hospital in denying a patient's
 application for financial assistance. Further, propensity to pay  scores
 may  not  disqualify patients who otherwise qualify for eligibility from
 receiving financial assistance. FURTHER, PROPENSITY TO PAY SCORES  SHALL
 NOT  DISQUALIFY  PATIENTS  WHO  OTHERWISE  QUALIFY  FOR ELIGIBILITY FROM
 RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The [policies  and  procedures]  UNIFORM
 POLICY  AND  FORM  policies  and procedures shall allow patients seeking
 financial assistance to provide the following financial information  and
 documentation in support of their application:  pay checks or pay stubs;
 unemployment  documentation;  social  security  income; rent receipts; a
 letter from the patient's employer  attesting  to  the  patient's  gross
 income;  documentation  of eligibility for other means-tested government
 benefits; or, if none of the aforementioned information  and  documenta-
 tion  are  available, a written self-attestation of the patient's income
 may be used. General hospitals must  take  reasonable  steps  to  assist
 patients  in understanding the hospital's application and form, policies
 and procedures and in applying  for  payment  adjustments.  [Application
 forms  shall be printed and posted] THE COMMISSIONER SHALL TRANSLATE THE
 UNIFORM FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE  APPLICATION  FORM  AND  POLICY  INTO  THE
 "PRIMARY  LANGUAGES"  OF  EACH  GENERAL  HOSPITAL. EACH GENERAL HOSPITAL
 SHALL PRINT AND POST THESE MATERIALS to  its  website  in  the  "primary
 languages"  of patients served by the general hospital. For the purposes
 of this paragraph, "primary languages" shall include any  language  that
 is  either  (i)  used  to  communicate,  during at least five percent of
 patient visits in a year, by patients who cannot speak, read,  write  or
 understand  the  English  language at the level of proficiency necessary
 for effective communication with health care providers, or  (ii)  spoken
 by limited-English speaking individuals comprising more than one percent
 of  the  primary  hospital  service area population, as calculated using
 demographic information available from the United States Bureau  of  the
 Census,  supplemented  by  data from school systems. Decisions regarding
 such applications shall be made within  thirty  days  of  receipt  of  a
 completed  application.  The [policies and procedures] UNIFORM FINANCIAL
 ASSISTANCE POLICY shall require that the hospital issue  any  denial  or
 approval  of  the  application in writing which clearly communicates the
 amount of assistance granted, any amounts still owed with information on
 how to appeal the decision and shall require the hospital  to  establish
 an  appeals  process  under which it will evaluate the decision about an
 application. Nothing in this subdivision shall prevent a  hospital  from
 informing  and assisting a patient with an application for health insur-
 ance coverage with a local  services  district  or  the  marketplace.  A
 hospital shall not make the availability of financial assistance contin-
 gent  upon the patient's application for health insurance coverage.  The
 hospital shall inform patients on how to file a  complaint  against  the
 hospital  or a debt collector that is contracted on behalf of the hospi-
 tal regarding the patient's bill.  General hospitals  are  required  to
 take  reasonable  measures  to determine if a patient  is  eligible  for
 financial assistance including prior to making a referral  to  a  third-
 party debt collector or  other extraordinary collections measures.
 A. 6027--A  13
 
  (g)  The [policies and procedures] UNIFORM FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY
 shall provide that patients with incomes below six  hundred  percent  of
 the  federal  poverty  level are deemed eligible for payment adjustments
 and shall conform to the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this
 subdivision,  provided,  however, that nothing in this subdivision shall
 be interpreted as  precluding  hospitals  from  extending  such  payment
 adjustments  to  other  patients,  either generally or on a case-by-case
 basis.  For patients determined to be eligible for financial  assistance
 under the terms of [a hospital's] THE UNIFORM financial assistance poli-
 cy,  the  [policies  and  procedures]  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY shall
 prohibit any limitations on financial assistance for services  based  on
 the  medical  condition of the applicant, other than typical limitations
 or exclusions based on medical necessity or the clinical or  therapeutic
 benefit of a procedure or treatment.
  (h)  A  hospital  or its agent shall not issue, authorize or permit an
 income execution of a patient's wages, secure a lien or force a sale  or
 foreclosure  of  a  patient's  primary  residence in order to collect an
 outstanding medical bill and shall not send an account to collection  if
 the  patient has submitted a completed application for financial assist-
 ance, UNTIL IT HAS  MADE  REASONABLE  EFFORTS  TO  DETERMINE  WHETHER  A
 PATIENT  QUALIFIES FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR while the hospital deter-
 mines the patient's eligibility for financial assistance.  The [policies
 and procedures] UNIFORM POLICY shall provide for  written  notification,
 which  shall  include  notification  on a patient bill, to a patient not
 less than thirty days prior to the referral of debts for collection  and
 shall  require  that the collection agency obtain the hospital's written
 consent prior to commencing a legal action.  The [policies  and  proce-
 dures]  UNIFORM  POLICY  shall  require  all  general hospital staff who
 interact  with  patients  or  have  responsibility  for  billing  and
 collections to be trained in the [policies and procedures] UNIFORM POLI-
 CY, and require the implementation of a mechanism for the general hospi-
 tal to measure its compliance with the [policies and procedures] UNIFORM
 POLICY.  The [policies and procedures] UNIFORM POLICY shall require that
 any  collection  agency,  lawyer  or  firm under contract with a general
 hospital for the collection of debts  follow  the  [hospital's]  UNIFORM
 financial assistance policy, including providing information to patients
 on  how to apply for financial assistance where appropriate.  The [poli-
 cies and procedures] UNIFORM POLICY shall prohibit  collections  from  a
 patient  who  is  determined to be eligible for medical assistance under
 title eleven of article five of the social  services  law  at  the  time
 services were rendered and for which services medicaid payment is avail-
 able.
  (i) Reports required to be submitted to the department by each general
 hospital  as  a  condition for participation in the pools shall contain:
 (i) a certification from an independent certified public  accountant  or
 independent  licensed  public accountant or an attestation from a senior
 official of the hospital that the hospital is in compliance with  condi-
 tions of participation in the pools;
  (ii)  a  report  on hospital costs incurred and uncollected amounts in
 providing services to patients found eligible for financial  assistance,
 including  the  amount  of  care provided for patients under two hundred
 percent poverty, during the period covered by the report;
  (iii) hospital costs incurred and uncollected amounts for  deductibles
 and coinsurance for eligible patients with insurance or other third-par-
 ty payor coverage;
 A. 6027--A  14
 
  (iv)  the  number  of  patients,  organized according to United States
 postal service zip code, race, ethnicity and  gender,  who  applied  for
 financial assistance under the [hospital's] UNIFORM financial assistance
 policy,  and  the  number,  organized  according to United States postal
 service  zip  code,  race, ethnicity and gender, whose applications were
 approved and whose applications were denied;
  (v) the reimbursement received for indigent care from the pool  estab-
 lished under this section;
  (vi)  the amount of funds that have been expended on financial assist-
 ance from charitable bequests made or trusts established for the purpose
 of providing financial  assistance  to  patients  who  are  eligible  in
 accordance with the terms of the bequests or trusts;
  (vii)  for hospitals located in social services districts in which the
 district allows hospitals to assist patients with such applications, the
 number of applications for eligibility for medicaid under  title  eleven
 of  article  five  of the social services law that the hospital assisted
 patients in completing and the number denied and approved;
  (viii)  the  hospital's  financial  losses  resulting  from  services
 provided under medicaid; and
  (ix)  the  number  of  referrals  to  collection  agents or contracted
 external collection vendors, court cases and liens placed on  any  resi-
 dences of patients through the collection process used by a hospital.
  (j)  [Within  ninety  days of the effective date of the chapter of the
 laws of two thousand twenty-three which amended  this  subdivision  each
 hospital  shall submit to the commissioner a written report on its poli-
 cies and procedures for financial assistance to patients which are  used
 by  the  hospital  as  of such effective date. Such report shall include
 copies of its policies  and  procedures,  including  material  which  is
 distributed  to  patients, and a description of the hospital's financial
 aid policies and procedures. Such description shall include  the  income
 levels  of  patients  on  which  eligibility is based, the financial aid
 eligible patients receive and the means of calculating such aid, and the
 service area, if any, used by the hospital to determine eligibility.
  (k)] The commissioner shall include the data collected under paragraph
 (i) of this subdivision in regular audits of the annual general hospital
 institutional cost report.
  [(l)] (K) In the event the state is unable  to  secure  all  necessary
 federal approvals to include, as part of the state's approved state plan
 under  title  nineteen of the federal social security act, a requirement
 that compliance with this subdivision is a condition of participation in
 pool distributions authorized pursuant to this section and section twen-
 ty-eight hundred seven-w of this article, then such condition of partic-
 ipation shall be deemed null and void. Notwithstanding section twelve of
 this chapter, failure to comply  with  this  subdivision  by  a  general
 hospital  shall  make  the  hospital  liable  for a civil penalty not to
 exceed ten thousand dollars for each violation. The  imposition  of  the
 civil penalties shall be subject to section twelve-a of this chapter.
  [(m)] (L) A hospital or its collection agents shall not report adverse
 information about a patient to a consumer or financial reporting entity.
 A  hospital  or  its  collection  agent  shall not commence civil action
 against a patient or delegate a collection activity to a debt  collector
 for  nonpayment for one hundred eighty days after the first post-service
 bill is issued and until a  hospital  has  made  reasonable  efforts  to
 determine whether a patient qualifies for financial assistance. A hospi-
 tal  OR ITS COLLECTION AGENT shall not commence a civil action against a
 patient or delegate a collection activity to a debt collector,  if:  the
 A. 6027--A  15
 
 hospital  was  notified that an appeal or a review of a health insurance
 decision is pending within the immediately preceding sixty days; or  the
 patient has a pending application for or qualified for financial assist-
 ance.
