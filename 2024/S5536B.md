 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  providing certain death benefits to  correction  officers,  correction
  officer-sergeants,  correction  officer-captains,  assistant  wardens,
  associate wardens or wardens employed by Orange county
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding
 a new section 606-d to read as follows:
  §  606-D.  DEATH  BENEFITS  FOR CORRECTION OFFICERS EMPLOYED BY ORANGE
 COUNTY. A. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE TERM "CORRECTION OFFICER"  SHALL
 MEAN A PERSON EMPLOYED BY THE ORANGE COUNTY CORRECTION DEPARTMENT WITH A
 TITLE  OF  CORRECTION  OFFICER,  CORRECTION OFFICER-SERGEANT, CORRECTION
 OFFICER-CAPTAIN, ASSISTANT WARDEN, ASSOCIATE WARDEN OR WARDEN.
  B. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF  LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,  WHERE  A
 CORRECTION  OFFICER  WOULD  HAVE  BEEN  ENTITLED TO A SERVICE RETIREMENT
 BENEFIT AT THE TIME OF HIS OR HER DEATH  AND  WHERE  HIS  OR  HER  DEATH
 OCCURS  ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAPTER OF THE LAWS OF TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR THAT ADDED THIS SECTION, THE BENEFICIARY OR BENEFI-
 CIARIES MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE, IN A LUMP SUM,  AN  AMOUNT  PAYABLE  WHICH
 SHALL  BE  EQUAL TO THE PENSION RESERVE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
 HAD THE MEMBER RETIRED ON THE DATE OF HIS OR HER DEATH, OR THE VALUE  OF

 THE  DEATH  BENEFIT AND THE RESERVE-FOR-INCREASED-TAKE-HOME-PAY, IF ANY,
 WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
  §  2.  All  past  service  costs  associated  with  implementing  the
 provisions of this act shall be borne by the county of Orange and may be
 amortized over a period of ten years.
  § 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to the appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would modify the in-service  death  benefit  for  retirement
 eligible  members  of the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement
 System who are employed by Orange County in certain  correction  officer
 titles.  The  in-service  death benefit will be the value of the pension
 reserve as if the member had retired on their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of  approximately  $34,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of Orange County for the fiscal year ending March
 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary but is expected to average
 0.1% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $240,000 which  will  be
 borne by Orange County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment  will  be  made  on February 1, 2025. If Orange County elects to
 amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for each year includ-
 ing interest would be $30,700.
  These estimated costs are based on 277 affected  members  employed  by
 Orange  County,  with annual salary of approximately $30.8 million as of
 March 31, 2023.
