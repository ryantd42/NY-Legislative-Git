 Introduced  by  Sen. SKOUFIS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Civil Service and Pensions
 
 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  providing  certain  death  benefits to correction officers, correction
  officer-sergeants,  correction  officer-captains,  assistant  wardens,
  associate wardens or wardens employed by Orange county
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding
 a new section 606-c to read as follows:
  § 606-C. DEATH BENEFITS FOR CORRECTION  OFFICERS  EMPLOYED  BY  ORANGE
 COUNTY.  A. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE TERM "CORRECTION OFFICER" SHALL
 MEAN A PERSON EMPLOYED BY THE ORANGE COUNTY CORRECTION DEPARTMENT WITH A
 TITLE OF CORRECTION  OFFICER,  CORRECTION  OFFICER-SERGEANT,  CORRECTION
 OFFICER-CAPTAIN, ASSISTANT WARDEN, ASSOCIATE WARDEN OR WARDEN.
  B.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  PROVISION  OF  LAW  TO THE CONTRARY, WHERE A
 CORRECTION OFFICER WOULD HAVE BEEN  ENTITLED  TO  A  SERVICE  RETIREMENT
 BENEFIT  AT  THE  TIME  OF  HIS  OR HER DEATH AND WHERE HIS OR HER DEATH
 OCCURS ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAPTER OF THE LAWS OF  TWO
 THOUSAND  TWENTY-THREE THAT ADDED THIS SECTION, THE BENEFICIARY OR BENE-
 FICIARIES MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE, IN A LUMP SUM, AN AMOUNT  PAYABLE  WHICH
 SHALL  BE  EQUAL TO THE PENSION RESERVE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
 HAD THE MEMBER RETIRED ON THE DATE OF HIS OR HER DEATH, OR THE VALUE  OF
 THE  DEATH  BENEFIT AND THE RESERVE-FOR-INCREASED-TAKE-HOME-PAY, IF ANY,
 WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
  §  2.  All  past  service  costs  associated  with  implementing  the
 provisions of this act shall be borne by the county of Orange and may be
 amortized over a period of ten years.
  §  3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall  be  subject  to  the  appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  modify  the in-service death benefit for retirement
 eligible members of the New York State and Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System  who  are employed by Orange County in certain correction officer
 titles. The in-service death benefit will be the value  of  the  pension
 reserve as if the member had retired on their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $34,000 in the
 annual contributions of Orange County for the fiscal year  ending  March
 31,  2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $252,000 which  will  be
 borne by Orange County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment  will  be  made  on February 1, 2024. If Orange County elects to
 amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for  the  first  year
 including interest would be $32,200.
  These  estimated  costs  are based on 290 affected members employed by
 Orange County, with annual salary of approximately $31.5 million  as  of
 March 31, 2022.
