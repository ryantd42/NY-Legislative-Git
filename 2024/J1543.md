  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Older Americans Month in the  State  of
  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the observance of
  National Older Americans Month
 
  WHEREAS, Senior citizens bring a wealth of experience and  knowledge
to  the  increasingly  active  roles they play in today's society; their
past contributions and future participation are a  vital  part  of,  and
valuable asset to, the fabric of community life and activity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2024, as Older Americans Month  in
the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Older Americans Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Every  May,  the  Administration  on  Aging,  part  of  the
Administration  for  Community  Living, leads our nation's observance of
Older American's Month; this vital campaign  is  celebrated  across  the
country  through  ceremonies,  events, fairs, and other such activities;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Older Americans Month was established in 1963 to honor  the
legacies  and  contributions  of  older Americans and to support them as
they enter their next stage of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, When Older Americans Month was first  recognized,  only  17
million  living Americans had reached their 65th birthday, about a third
of older Americans lived in poverty, and there were few programs to meet
their needs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Interest in older Americans and their concerns was growing;
a meeting in April of 1963 between President John F. Kennedy and members
of the National Council of Senior Citizens led  to  designating  May  as
"Senior Citizens Month," the prelude to "Older Americans Month"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Historically,  Older  Americans  Month  has been a time to
acknowledge the contributions of past and current older persons  to  our
country, in particular those who defended our country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  President  since  Kennedy  has  issued  a  formal
proclamation during or before the month of May asking the entire  nation
to  pay  tribute in some way to older persons in their communities; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2024,  as Older
Americans Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Older Americans Month; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
