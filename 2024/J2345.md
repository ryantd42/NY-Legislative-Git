  COMMEMORATING the 75th Anniversary of Mary Cariola
  Center
 
  WHEREAS,  Individuals  and  organizations  devoted  to improving the
quality of life for others, enabling them to build lives of dignity  and
self-worth are deserving of the highest praise and recognition; and
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time, society calls upon these individuals and
organizations  to  be  recognized  for  the  significance  of  their
contributions and efforts to assist  others  in  developing  the  skills
necessary to be successful, productive citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Mary Cariola Center; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary  Cariola  Center  has  a  rich tradition of providing
innovative programs to individuals  with  complex  disabilities  through
personalized, interdisciplinary, evidence-based education and life skill
solutions which inspire and empower them and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Born  in  1896,  Mary  Cariola  and her family moved to an
Italian-American community in Rochester when  she  was  a  child;  as  a
teenager,  she  served  as an interpreter and advocate for her immigrant
neighbors who had difficulty communicating in their  new  culture;  this
was just the beginning of her fight for other people's rights; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Later,  Mary  Cariola  worked  as  a  deputy  employment
certification officer for the Rochester Board of Education, and then  as
a  caseworker  for  the  Society  for Prevention of Cruelty to children,
where  she  observed  the  hardships  of  discrimination,  poverty,  and
unacceptable treatment of children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In the 1940s, children with disabilities were often placed
in institutions; Mary Cariola's nephew, Butchie, was  born  with  severe
developmental  and  physical disabilities, and she could not imagine him
being institutionalized; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mary Cariola took the initiative and joined forces with six
other families and business leaders, to raise the necessary  funds,  and
founded  The  Day  Care  Center  for  Handicapped  Children, designed to
provide social, recreational and vocational experiences for children not
eligible for public school, within the limits  of  their  capacity;  the
Center opened in 1949 with eight students; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1977,  the  Center was renamed Mary Cariola Center, 10
years before her death, to honor her dedication to offering the  highest
quality  innovative  educational  programs  and  small  group  homes for
individuals with complex disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mary Cariola Center was the first in the nation to  open  a
group  home  for children and youth with significant behavior management
needs, and the  first  to  offer  a  sensory  room  which  uses  special
 
lighting,  music,  and  objects  as  a therapy for children with limited
communication skills; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Mary  Cariola Center serves more than 450 students
ages 3-21 in three school campuses, as well as nearly  50  residents  in
six  residential homes; each day, students travel from over 50 referring
school districts from 11 surrounding counties in  addition  to  Buffalo,
Syracuse, and Niagara Falls; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mary  Cariola  Center  School  is recognized statewide for
innovative  instructional  strategies,  design  and  construction  of
therapeutic  equipment  and  educational programs for children and youth
with complex cognitive, medical, social, and behavioral needs; and
 
  WHEREAS, The residential program provides 24-hour care in  a  family
setting  to  individuals  with  multiple  disabilities  and  behavior
management needs;  the  program's  six  residential  facilities  located
throughout  Monroe  County focus on life skill development and assisting
individuals in experiencing all that life and their communities have  to
offer; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Mary Cariola Center is in direct correlation
to  the  efforts of its dedicated teachers, aides, and clinicians, whose
involvement is, and always has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive
commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard of
excellence in all endeavors  on  behalf  of  the  organization  and  the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
organizations  which  unselfishly  devote  their  energy,  talent  and
thoughtful  care  on behalf of improving the quality and dignity of life
in the community, are worthy and due full  praise  and  recognition  for
their noble and dedicated efforts; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of  Mary  Cariola  Center;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Mary Cariola Center.
