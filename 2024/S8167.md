 insurers from property insurance coverage for losses from flooding;
  (b) identify the potential impact, over the next  ten  years,  of  the
 cost  of property insurance and the unavailability of property insurance
 coverage for losses from flooding and any other topic or issue  that  is
 determined  to be relevant to the completion of the study by the depart-
 ment; and
  (c) analyze the possibility of supporting a  private  flood  insurance
 market  in  the  state  as  a  supplement to the existing National Flood
 Insurance Program.
  § 2. The department of financial services shall prepare a report which
 shall be submitted to the  governor,  the  temporary  president  of  the
 senate,  the  speaker of the assembly, the minority leader of the senate
 and the minority leader of the assembly, within eleven months after  the
 effective  date of this act, containing findings and recommendations for
