  Colomba upon the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
  recipient  of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the highest honor
  bestowed upon an individual by the  New  York  State
  Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Port Authority Police Officer Kevin Colomba upon the occasion of
his designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor
bestowed upon an individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the morning of Monday, October 30, 2023, Port  Authority
Police  Officer Kevin Colomba, 35, a seven-year veteran of the force and
a Captain with the Warwick Fire Department, had just finished a midnight
shift with the Port Authority at the George Washington  Bridge  when  he
came upon a head-on crash on Route 17A in Tuxedo, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite being off-duty in both roles, Officer Kevin Colomba
sprang  into  action, pulling the driver of one vehicle to safety before
turning to two people in the second car as flames began  to  engulf  the
vehicle; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Officer Kevin Colomba pulled the second driver through the
driver's window as the fire spread, with an injured woman still  trapped
in the passenger seat of the burning wreck; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Without  hesitation or concern for his own safety, Officer
Kevin Colomba instructed the woman to cover  her  face,  and  broke  the
passenger-side window before pulling her to safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Tuxedo Fire Department arrived shortly after to douse
the flames, and all three victims were brought to a nearby hospital  and
are expected to survive; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Justly  recognized as a hero, Officer Kevin Colomba richly
merits the admiration of this Legislative Body and his community for his
consummate, swift action in saving the lives of these three individuals;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Moreover, Officer Kevin  Colomba  should  be  meritoriously
commended  for  remaining  calm under pressure and for showing valor and
true courage while performing a lifesaving deed; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Officer  Kevin Colomba, in his spontaneous and heroic act,
has so aptly demonstrated his character and compassion for  the  welfare
of others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern
of  ordinary  citizens  across  the  community  of  New  York  State who
voluntarily respond without thought of danger or reward when others  are
in need of help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Port Authority Police Officer Kevin Colomba upon the occasion of
his designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor
bestowed  upon  an  individual  by  the New York State Senate; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Officer Kevin Colomba.
