 published by the United States department  of  labor,  bureau  of  labor
 statistics,  for  the  third  quarter of the calendar year preceding the

 commissioner to annually determine such base figures.
  (B) The base figure for the basic STAR exemption shall be thirty thou-

 STATISTICS,  FOR  THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF THE CALENDAR YEAR PRECEDING THE
 APPLICABLE SCHOOL YEAR, AS COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER  OF  THE  PRIOR
 CALENDAR  YEAR,  MULTIPLIED BY TWO. IF A BASE FIGURE AS SO DETERMINED IS

 of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (i) The tax savings for each parcel receiving the exemption authorized
 by section four hundred twenty-five of this chapter shall be computed by
 subtracting the amount actually  levied  against  the  parcel  from  the
 amount  that  would have been levied if not for the exemption[, provided
 however, that for the two thousand eleven-two  thousand  twelve  through
 two  thousand  eighteen-two  thousand  nineteen  school  years,  the tax
 savings applicable to any "portion" (which as  used  herein  shall  mean
 that  part  of an assessing unit located within a school district) shall
 not exceed the tax savings applicable  to  that  portion  in  the  prior
 school  year  multiplied  by  one  hundred  two percent, with the result
 rounded to the nearest dollar; and provided further that beginning  with
 the  two  thousand  nineteen-two  thousand  twenty  school year: (A) for
 purposes of the exemption authorized by section four hundred twenty-five
 of this chapter, the tax savings applicable to  any  portion  shall  not
 exceed  the  tax savings for the prior year, and (B) for purposes of the
 credit authorized by subsection (eee) of section six hundred six of  the
 tax  law, the tax savings applicable to any portion shall not exceed the
 tax savings applicable to that portion in the prior school  year  multi-
 plied by one hundred two percent, with the result rounded to the nearest
 dollar].  The  tax  savings  attributable  to  the  basic  and  enhanced
 exemptions shall be calculated separately. It shall be the  responsibil-
 ity  of  the  commissioner  to  calculate  tax  savings  limitations for
 purposes of this subdivision.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
