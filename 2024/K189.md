  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as American Red Cross Month in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the quality and character of life in the  communities  across  New  York
State  are  reflective  of  the concerned and dedicated efforts of those
organizations and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare
of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March  2023,  as  American
Red Cross Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  more  than  70  years,  United  States Presidents and
Governors around the country have recognized March as American Red Cross
Month to thank this vital humanitarian  organization  and  to  urge  the
public  to  continue to support its work through volunteerism, financial
contributions, or the donation of blood; and
 
  WHEREAS, American Red Cross Month celebrates the everyday heroes who
work tirelessly in times of disaster to offer the comfort of  a  helping
hand; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Red Cross, founded in 1881 by Clara Barton and
chartered  by the United States Congress in 1905, is one of our nation's
oldest and most recognized humanitarian organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than a century, the American Red Cross, along with
its generous donors, volunteers and employees, have shared a mission  of
preventing  and  relieving suffering, here at home and around the world,
through  disaster  relief,  support  of  America's  military  families,
lifesaving  blood,  international services, as well as health and safety
services; and
 
  WHEREAS, In New York State, this esteemed  nonprofit  organization's
12 regional chapters, along with the New York-Penn Blood Services Region
and  its  Fort  Drum  service,  have  a  long  history  of  providing
compassionate care to those in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, On a daily basis, this remarkable  institution  helps  make
communities  safer  in  these  uncertain  times  through  its  disaster
preparedness and response efforts; its volunteers are always  among  the
first  on the scene providing food, shelter, clothing and friendly faces
for support; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, the American  Red  Cross  provides  nationally
recognized  training  in  first  aid  and  water safety, cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), child care, and HIV/AIDS prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS, As a vital part of its preparedness efforts,  the  American
Red  Cross provides approximately half of the nation's blood supply and,
 
through the New York-Penn Blood Services  Region,  provides  the  safest
blood products possible to those in need throughout New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American  Red  Cross continues to provide comfort and
support to our military families and, working with the International Red
Cross, collects and  distributes  funds  to  those  suffering  from  the
effects  of  civil  unrest  and natural disasters around the world; they
have also spearheaded a campaign to immunize  millions  of  children  in
developing countries who do not have access to life saving vaccines; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim March 2023, as American
Red Cross Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
