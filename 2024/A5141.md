 vation, the following factors shall be among those considered:  (A)  the
 history and nature of the relationship between the donor and the recipi-
 ent,  including whether or not items have previously been exchanged; (B)
 whether the item was purchased by the donor; and (C) whether or not  the
 donor at the same time gave similar items to other public officials; the
 transfer shall not be considered to be motivated by a family, household,

 value of such item as a business expense or seeks reimbursement  from  a
 client.  CONTRIBUTIONS  MADE  BY ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY REQUIRED TO BE
 LISTED ON A STATEMENT OF REGISTRATION PURSUANT  TO  THIS  ARTICLE  TO  A
