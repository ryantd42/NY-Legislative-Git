  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 9-15, 2023, as Public Safety Telecommunicators
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  weeks  that  are  set  aside  to  recognize the vital work and
knowledge dispatchers bring during emergencies that affect the lives  of
citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April 9-15, 2023, as
Public Safety Telecommunicators Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance  of  National  Public  Safety
Telecommunicators Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1991, Congress proclaimed the second week  of  April  as
National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week to honor and recognize the
men  and  women  who serve as the first "first responders" when you need
help; and
 
  WHEREAS, Whether you need police, fire or  medical  personnel,  when
you  call  9-1-1,  a  dispatcher answers your call for help by gathering
vital information to instruct the appropriate agency on  the  nature  of
your emergency; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dispatchers are certified to give pre-arrival instructions
to the caller in medical emergencies, trained on what questions  to  ask
the caller during police emergencies, and provide instruction to victims
of fire emergencies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dispatchers work around the clock all year-long to support
police, firefighters and medics to help keep them and the  public  safe;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sufficient  gratitude  cannot  be  expressed  to all those
individuals who generously give of their time and  talents,  working  to
keep their communities safe; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Special  recognition  should be given to those who work so
assiduously for the betterment of their communities, and they should  be
acknowledged  publicly  for  the  good works they do for the citizens of
this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April 9-15, 2023, as
Public Safety Telecommunicators Week in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
