  Schuylerville, New York on July 9, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to recognize
milestones of significance which provide a  vital  service  to  veterans
throughout the communities of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  25th  Anniversary of the Gerald B. H. Solomon Saratoga
National Cemetery in Schuylerville, New York on Tuesday, July  9,  2024;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dedicated  on July 9, 1999, as Saratoga National Cemetery,
The Gerald B.H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery is New  York  State's
sixth  national  veteran's  cemetery and the 116th in the United States;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The first phase of this  National  Cemetery's  construction
encompassed  60  acres  of  the  351-acre  cemetery  and  included 5,000
gravesites, 2,000 lawn crypts, 1,500 columbaria niches  and  700  garden
niches  for cremated remains; at full capacity, the cemetery can provide
burial space for 175,500 veterans and eligible dependents; and
 
  WHEREAS, On January  24,  2002,  President  George  W.  Bush  signed
legislation  renaming  Saratoga  National  Cemetery  as  the Gerald B.H.
Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery after Congressman  Solomon,  who  was
known as the champion of veterans' causes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  past  two years, the Saratoga National Cemetery
Veteran Memorial Tree Program took root, replanting trees throughout the
cemetery that have been lost due to  weather  and  age  while  providing
families of veterans the opportunity to memorialize their loved one with
a living, growing memorial; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  honor  of  this  upcoming  anniversary, the cemetery's
Memorial Tree Program has designated section 20 as the site of the  25th
Anniversary  Commemorative  Oak  Grove,  a space which holds significant
meaning as the gravesite of Congressman Gerald B. H. Solomon; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Gerald B.H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery  has  an
Honor  Guard  Association,  which  consists  of  five  squads  of  12-18
volunteers each to ensure that every veteran receives a proper  military
burial service at no cost; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  three  Medal  of  Honor  recipients  buried or
memorialized at this National Cemetery; they  are:  Sergeant  Thomas  A.
Barker  (World  War II veteran); Technical Sergeant Peter J. Dalessandro
(former New York State Senator and World War II veteran): and Specialist
Fourth Class Raymond R. Wright (Vietnam veteran); and
 
  WHEREAS, There are several monuments and memorials  located  on  the
grounds  of  the  Saratoga National Cemetery, including: the ship's bell

bronze  memorial  erected  on  October  19,  2002,  in honor of the U.S.
Submarine  Veterans  and AMVETS (American Veterans) donated the carillon
in 1999; and
 
  WHEREAS, For 25 years, the Gerald B. H.  Solomon  Saratoga  National
Cemetery  has  served  as  a final resting place for many who embodied a
service above self-persona in service to this Nation, with a  staff  and
board of directors that have been steadfast in maintaining and enhancing
the beauty of these grounds; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to observe events
which symbolize the historical, social, and cultural development of this
great  Empire State and embody the principles upon which this Nation was
founded, and honor those uniformed soldiers who served  to  protect  its
freedom; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Gerald B.  H.  Solomon  Saratoga
National  Cemetery in Schuylerville, New York on July 9, 2024; and be it

the Honor Guard; and members of the Board of Directors of the Gerald  B.
H.  Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery.
