  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.

  POLICE
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  20,176
  - Average Age:  32.8
  - Average Service:  6.1
  - Average Salary:  107,600
 
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, Tier 3 POLICE members who retire
 with  at  least  20  years  of service are eligible to receive an annual
 benefit that is equal to 42% of Final Average Salary (FAS),  plus  0.33%
 of FAS for each month of service (up to 24 months) in excess of 20 years
 of  service,  resulting  in  a  benefit  of 50% of FAS after 22 years of
 service.
  Under the proposed legislation, Tier 3 POLICE members who retire  with
 at  least  20  years  of  service would be eligible to receive an annual
 benefit that is equal to 50% of FAS.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems except for:
  * Retirement rates were adjusted to reflect the earlier payability  of
 the service retirement benefit associated with the proposed legislation.
  *  New  entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so that total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
