  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 17 of section 501 of the retirement and  social
 security  law,  as amended by chapter 18 of the laws of 2012, is amended
 to read as follows:
  17. "Normal retirement  age"  shall  be  age  sixty-two,  for  general

 CLE  SHALL  BE  PAID  TO POLICE/FIRE MEMBERS OF THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE
 PENSION FUND, AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE.  Early service  retirement

 city  police/fire  revised  plan  members,  New  York  city  uniformed
 correction/sanitation revised plan members and investigator revised plan

  §  3. Section 505 of the retirement and social security law is amended

 POLICE/FIRE  MEMBERS  OF  THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE PENSION FUND SHALL BE

 SERVICE  RETIREMENT  BENEFIT  UPON  COMPLETING  TWENTY  YEARS OF SERVICE
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION D OF SECTION FIVE HUNDRED THREE OF THIS ARTICLE.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend  Sections  501,
 503,  and 505 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to reduce
 the Normal Retirement Age for Tier 3  original,  revised,  and  enhanced
 plan members of the New York City Police Pension Fund (POLICE) to be the
 age  at which a member completes or would have completed twenty years of
 service.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: Currently, Tier 3 POLICE members who  retire  with
 at  least  20 years of service are eligible to receive an annual benefit
 that is equal to 42% of Final Average Salary (FAS), plus  0.33%  of  FAS
 for  each  month  of  service (up to 24 months) in excess of 20 years of
 service, resulting in a benefit of 50% of FAS after 22 years of service.
  Under the proposed legislation, Tier 3 POLICE members who retire  with
 at  least  20  years  of  service would be eligible to receive an annual
 benefit that is equal to 50% of FAS.
  The annual benefit in either case would be subject to a Social Securi-
 ty Offset commencing at age 62, which is not affected  by  the  proposed
 legislation.  There  is  also  no  change  to the benefit provisions for
 deferred vested members who terminate employment  prior  to  earning  20
 years of service.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT:  Based on the census data and the actuarial assump-
 tions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of  this  proposed
 legislation  would  result in an increase in the present value of future
 employer contributions of approximately $82.9 million  for  the  current
 population.
  The  financial  impact  will  increase  as  the  impacted  population
 increases over time. The estimate of the  increase  in  annual  employer
 contributions  for Fiscal Years 2024 through 2028 are shown in the table
 below.
  Fiscal  Increase in
  Year  Employer Contributions
  ($ Millions)
  2024  $ 10.7
  2025  $ 11.5
  2026  $ 12.4
  2027  $ 13.3
  2028  $ 14.4
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 18 years
 and the increase in UAL was therefore amortized over an  18-year  period
 (17  payments  under  the  One-Year  Lag Methodology) using level dollar
 payments.

  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used  in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of POLICE to deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  There  are  19,375 active Tier 3 members of POLICE as of June 30, 2022
 and they have an  average  age  of  approximately  32.2  years,  average
 service  of  approximately  5.7 years, and an average salary of approxi-
 mately $101,600.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of POLICE except
 for  adjustments to the retirement rates to reflect changes in eligibil-
 ity for service retirement associated with the proposed legislation.
  New entrants were projected to replace the members expected  to  leave
 the active population to maintain a steady-state population. New entrant
 demographics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actu-
 arial judgement.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of POLICE used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population, and other factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  *  Pension  costs  for  future  members  of  POLICE  hired on or after
 7/1/2026.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit costs.

 Actuary for, and independent of, the New York  City  Retirement  Systems
 and  Pension  Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries and a
 Member of the American Academy of Actuaries. I am a member of NYCERS but
