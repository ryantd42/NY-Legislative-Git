  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:

 Casey Skudin to have attained 20 years of firefighter service as of June
 16,  2022  (the  day before his death), and to have retired on that same
 day  entitling  his  surviving  spouse,  Angela  Skudin,  to  apply  for

  INITIAL INCREASE (DECREASE) IN ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES
  as of June 30, 2024 ($)
  Present Value (PV)  FIRE
  PV of Benefits:  368,000
  PV of Employee Contributions:  0

  AMORTIZATION OF UNFUNDED ACCRUED LIABILITY

  Number of Payments:  1
  Fiscal Year of Last Payment:  2026
  Amortization Payment:  408,000
 
  Since  Mr.  Skudin is deceased, and therefore has no remaining working
 lifetime, the entire increase in Unfunded  Accrued  Liability  would  be
 recognized immediately.
  CENSUS DATA: As of June 30, 2023, Angela Skudin would be approximately
 age 44 and is not receiving an annual pension.
  The  Ordinary  Death Benefit and reserve equal to the present value of
 the service retirement benefit (Death  Gamble  Benefit)  were  estimated
 using  data  sets provided by the New York City Fire Pension Fund (FIRE)
 which were not audited but were reviewed for reasonableness.  The  Ordi-
 nary  Death  Benefit  was estimated using an earnings amount of approxi-
 S. 9845  3
 
 mately $181,500, and the Death Gamble  Benefit  was  estimated  using  a
 Final Average Salary of approximately $151,000.
  BACKGROUND:  New  York  City firefighter Casey Skudin died as a Tier 2
 member of FIRE on June 17, 2022 with less  than  20  years  of  service.
 Accordingly, his beneficiary is entitled to an Ordinary Death Benefit of
 a  lump sum payment equal to three times his final years earnings plus a
 refund of member contributions.
  Under the proposed legislation, Mr. Skudin would  be  deemed  to  have
 attained 20 years of service at the time of his death, and his surviving
 spouse  would be authorized to file a retirement election option form on
 his behalf for a 100% Joint and Survivor allowance.  Alternatively,  the
 proposed  legislation  may entitle Angela Skudin to a Death Gamble Bene-
 fit.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
  * For purposes of this Fiscal Note, Angela Skudin was assumed to elect
 a Death Gamble Benefit instead of a 100% Joint and  Survivor  allowance.
 Therefore,  the  estimated  financial  impact  of this proposal has been
 calculated as the difference between the  present  value  of  the  Death
 Gamble Benefit and the Ordinary Death Benefit.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the  impacted population and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
