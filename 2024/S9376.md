 Introduced  by Sens. GIANARIS, COMRIE -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Commerce, Econom-
  ic Development and Small Business
 
 AN ACT to amend the economic development law  and  the  New  York  state
  urban  development  corporation  act, in relation to enacting the good
  jobs guarantee program

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  economic  development law is amended by adding a new
 article 28 to read as follows:
 
  ARTICLE 28
  GOOD JOBS GUARANTEE PROGRAM
 
 SECTION 500. SHORT TITLE.
  501. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  502. GOOD JOBS GUARANTEE PROGRAM.
  503. DEFINITIONS.
  504. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
  § 500. SHORT TITLE. THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY  BE  CITED  AS
 THE "GOOD JOBS GUARANTEE PROGRAM ACT".
  § 501. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. FOR MANY NEW YORKERS, THERE ARE FEW PATH-
 WAYS TO GOOD JOBS, AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY IS NO LONGER ATTAINABLE. TRADI-
 TIONAL  PATHS  ARE FAILING, AND THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. OVER 76% OF AMERI-
 CANS, WHICH EQUATES TO 218+ MILLION ADULTS, DO NOT HAVE COLLEGE  DEGREES
 EVEN  THOUGH  MOST  HIGH-PAYING  JOBS REQUIRE ONE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE
 UNITED STATES IS BURDENED BY A $1.7 TRILLION STUDENT LOAN CRISIS BECAUSE
 COLLEGE FINANCING HAS DECOUPLED FROM OUTCOMES. THE SYSTEM IS  ESPECIALLY
 STACKED  AGAINST LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN NEW YORK
 STATE, THIS PROBLEM PERSISTS: 60% OF ADULTS LACK  A  4-YEAR  DEGREE  AND
 DEGREE HOLDERS OWE $90 BILLION IN LOANS. COLLEGE IS NOT THE ONLY PATH TO
 A  GOOD  JOB  -  ALTERNATIVES  FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING EXIST. WHILE THESE
 MODELS HAVE HIGH POTENTIAL, LIMITED FUNDING AND FRAMEWORKS PREVENT  THEM
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 9376  2
 
 FROM CONFRONTING THIS CHALLENGE AND NEW MODELS ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE
 SCALE.
  ACCORDINGLY,  THE  GOOD  JOBS  GUARANTEE PROGRAM ACT WOULD ESTABLISH A
 PROGRAM WITHIN THE EMPIRE STATE DEVELOPMENT  CORPORATION  TO  FACILITATE
 THE  IMPLEMENTATION  OF  WORKFORCE  TRAINING  FOR LOW-INCOME NEW YORKERS
 THROUGH A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP CAPPED EQUITY FINANCING  FRAMEWORK.
 CORE  TO THE GOOD JOBS GUARANTEE PROGRAM IS ENSURING THAT LOW-INCOME NEW
 YORKERS SEEKING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER  OFF  UPON
 COMPLETING  WORKFORCE  TRAINING  THAN  THEY WERE BEFORE. INDIVIDUALS WHO
 PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING PROGRAMS UNDER THE GOOD JOBS GUARANTEE WILL  NOT
 BE  CHARGED  ANY  TUITION OR UPFRONT COSTS; THEY WILL ONLY INCUR PAYMENT
 OBLIGATIONS IF THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY SUCCEEDS IN SECURING THEM EMPLOYMENT
 AT  HIGH,  FAMILY-SUSTAINING  WAGES.  THE  BILL  ALSO  CONTAINS  SEVERAL
 PROTECTIONS  TO  ENSURE THAT PARTICIPANTS CAN RECEIVE WORKFORCE TRAINING
 FOR GOOD PAYING JOBS WITHOUT BEING SADDLED BY UNDULY BURDENSOME DEBT. IF
 AT ANY TIME AFTER THEIR TRAINING A PARTICIPANT IS UNABLE TO  MAINTAIN  A
 GOOD  JOB  FOR  ANY  REASON,  THE PARTICIPANT'S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WILL
 CEASE. THIS PROGRAM SHIFTS THE BURDEN AWAY FROM THE JOB SEEKER AND  ONTO
 APPROVED  WORKFORCE  TRAINING  PROVIDERS TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. BY BRINGING
 THIS OUTCOME-BASED FINANCING MODEL TO SCALE, THIS BILL AIMS  TO  REVOLU-
 TIONIZE  WORKFORCE  TRAINING IN NEW YORK AND GUARANTEE GOOD JOBS TO LOW-
 INCOME NEW YORKERS.
  § 502. GOOD JOBS GUARANTEE PROGRAM. THERE IS HEREBY ESTABLISHED A GOOD
