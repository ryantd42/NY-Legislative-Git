  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  The  closing paragraph of subdivision 1 of section 156 of
 the public housing law, as amended by chapter 893 of the laws  of  1974,
 is amended to read as follows:
  C.  The "probable aggregate annual income" means the annual NET income
 [of the chief wage earner of the family] AFTER FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNIC-
 IPAL INCOME TAXES ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE GROSS INCOME OF THE  CHIEF  WAGE
 EARNER  plus  all other  income of other members of the family over the
 age of twenty-one years, plus a proportion  of  the  income  of  members
 under  the  age  of  twenty-one  years to be determined by the authority
 solely for the purpose of establishing rent to be paid except  that  the
 authority may exclude a proportion of the income of other members of the
 family  over  the age of twenty-one years for the purpose of determining

 ing finance law, as amended by section 1 of subpart  G  of  part  XX  of
 chapter 55 of the laws of 2020, is amended to read as follows:

 outside  a  metropolitan  statistical  area,  the median income for such
 persons or families for the county in which the project is  located,  as
 most  recently determined by the United States department of housing and
 urban  development, in which case any person or family becoming eligible
 for admission pursuant to this subparagraph shall pay, from the time  of
 admission,  a  rental  surcharge as provided for in subdivision three of
 this section, computed on the basis of the income limitations applicable
 to such persons or families in the absence of this subparagraph, or (ii)
 eight times the rental, including the value or cost  to  them  of  heat,
 light, water and cooking fuel, of the dwellings that may be furnished to
 such persons or families, except that in the case of families with three
 or  more dependents, such ratio shall not exceed nine to one. Persons or
 families with two or less dependents eligible for admission or continued
 occupancy pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this  paragraph  or  subpara-
 graph  (ii) of this paragraph prior to the effective date of [a] chapter
 726 of the laws of two thousand nineteen [that amended subparagraph (ii)

 of  an  income  limitation  of  seven times the rental and families with
 three or more dependents eligible for admission or  continued  occupancy
 pursuant  to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph or subparagraph (ii) of
 this paragraph prior to the effective date of [a]  chapter  726  of  the
 laws  of  two  thousand nineteen [that amended subparagraph (ii) of this
 paragraph], shall pay a rental surcharge computed on  the  basis  of  an
 income  limitation  of  eight times the cost of the rental, including in
 each instance the value or cost to the  persons  or  families  of  heat,
 light,  water  and  cooking  fuel,  of  the  dwellings furnished to such
 persons or families.
  The "probable aggregate annual income" in the case of dwelling  accom-
 modations  means  the annual NET income [of the chief wage earner of the
 family] AFTER FEDERAL, STATE AND MUNICIPAL TAXES ARE DEDUCTED  FROM  THE
 GROSS  INCOME  OF  THE CHIEF WAGE EARNER, plus all other income of other
 members of the family over the age of twenty-one years, plus  a  propor-
 tion of income of gainfully employed members under the age of twenty-one
 years, the proportion to be determined by the company as approved by the
 commissioner  or  the  supervising agency, as the case may be, excluding
 therefrom a deduction of fifteen thousand dollars  from  the  income  of
 secondary  wage  earners of the family or a larger deduction if approved
 by the commissioner or the supervising  agency,  as  the  case  may  be,
 except  that  the company, as approved by the commissioner or the super-
 vising agency, as the case may be,  may  exclude  a  proportion  of  the
 income  of  other members of the family over the age of twenty-one years
 for the purpose of determining eligibility for  admission  or  continued
 occupancy,  or  for  establishing  the rental of such family, or for all
 such purposes; in the case of such  non-housekeeping  accommodations  it
 means  the annual income of the occupant, provided that the commissioner
 or supervising agency, as the case may be,  may  make  rules  and  regu-
 lations  relative  to the allocation of the income of a family among the
 members thereof for the purpose of determining the  income  attributable
 to such occupant.

 as  amended  by  chapter  182 of the laws of 1997, is amended to read as

 age of twenty-one years to be determined by the commissioner,  excluding
 therefrom  a  deduction  of  fifteen thousand dollars from the income of
 secondary  wage  earners of the family or a larger deduction if approved
 by the commissioner or the supervising  agency,  as  the  case  may  be,
 except  that the company, as approved by the commissioner, may exclude a
 proportion of the income of other members of the family over the age  of
 twenty-one  years  for the purpose of determining eligibility for admis-
