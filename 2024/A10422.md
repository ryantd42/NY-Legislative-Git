 Introduced by COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Gonzalez-Ro-
  jas)  -- read once and referred to the Committee on Governmental Oper-
  ations
 
 AN ACT to amend the state finance law,  in  relation  to  requiring  all
  state  agencies  and  offices  to  cease purchasing single-use plastic
  water bottles and provides for the installation of water bottle  fill-
  ing stations

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. 1. The legislature finds  and  declares
 that:
  (a)  climate  change is adversely affecting the people of New York and
 poses a threat to public health, the well-being of our  communities  and
 families, and our state's economy and infrastructure;
  (b)  the  combustion  of fossil fuels is a primary cause of greenhouse
 gas emissions that cause climate change;
  (c) the production of plastic bottles relies on fossil fuels, and most
 plastic bottles are made from petroleum-based polyethylene terephthalate
 in refineries that run on fossil fuels;
  (d) plastic pollution has resulted in harm to communities in New York;
  (e) by some estimates Americans throw away about 2.5  million  plastic
 bottles every hour;
  (f) plastic pollution harms wildlife across New York, including in our
 ocean ecosystems; and
  (g)  purchasing  single-use plastic water bottles instead of utilizing
 less harmful alternatives is inconsistent with the best interests of the
 people of the state.
  2. Therefore, the legislature determines it to be in the best interest
 of the state to require all state departments, agencies and  offices  to
 cease  purchasing  single-use  plastic water bottles and to require that
 installation of water bottle filling stations on  premises  occupied  by
 the department, agency or office.
  § 2. The state finance law is amended by adding a new section 163-e to
 read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
