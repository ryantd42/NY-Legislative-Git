  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2, 2023, as Queens Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to  commemorate
those  events  of  historical significance which add strength, vigor and
inspiration to the  cultural  diversity  and  quality  of  life  in  the
communities of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2, 2023, as Queens Day
in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  May 2, 2023, the best of the Borough of Queens will be
on display at the Capitol in Albany, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  event  is  coordinated  by  the  Queens  Chamber  of
Commerce,  in conjunction with the Queens Delegation, which will put the
spotlight on Queens and include an evening reception featuring foods and
beverages  as  well  as  a  display  of  Queens'  favorite  dining
establishments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Queens  was  established  in  the  year 1683 as one of the
original 12 counties  of  New  York,  presumably  named  for  the  Queen
Catherine of Braganza, wife of King Charles II; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  symbol  of Queens, the Unisphere, is a giant globe in
Flushing Meadows Park, home of the U.S Open Tennis Championships and the
Mets at Citi Field; and
 
  WHEREAS, Downtown Flushing is New York City's other Chinatown; and
 
  WHEREAS, With over 2.3 million people, the Borough of Queens is  the
most  culturally  diverse  county in the United States, and has become a
tourist destination for its  many  cultural  attractions  including  the
arts,  businesses,  culinary  delights, and the many charms this vibrant
community has to offer; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, Queens is the largest borough  geographically,
consisting  of  178 square miles; is the second most populous county; is
the most diverse, with 138 languages spoken; and is represented by  more
than 150 countries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More than half of all Queens residents are foreign born, a
much greater concentration than any other borough in New York City,  and
many  of  the  neighborhoods  reflect  the rich cultural heritage of its
residents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Long  Island  City  has  emerged  as  a  major  cultural
destination,  with  the  second  highest  concentration  of  museums and
galleries in New York City such as: Museum of the Moving  Image,  Queens
Museum,  New  York  Hall  of  Science;  The  Noguchi  Museum;  and Louis
Armstrong Home Museum, who was one of the most recognizable entertainers
 
in the world when he chose the  working-class  neighborhood  of  Corona,
Queens, to be his home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  Queens  is  home  to  several  large  company
headquarters, no  single  industry  dominates  its  economy;  the  first
Steinway  grand and upright pianos were crafted in Astoria back in 1853,
and for the past one hundred years, the trusted  company  has  kept  its
same  factory  for  creating superior instruments; it is one of the last
standing manufacturers in New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, two-thirds of all businesses in Queens employs
between one and four people, making small businesses the cornerstone  of
the borough's economic vitality; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2, 2023, as Queens Day
in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; the Office of the Queens Borough President; and the Queens Chamber
of Commerce.
