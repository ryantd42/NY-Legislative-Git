 Introduced  by Sen. HARCKHAM -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law and a chapter of  the
  laws  of  2023 amending the environmental conservation law relating to
  exempting certain geothermal boreholes at depths beyond  five  hundred
  feet  from  certain  requirements,  as  proposed  in legislative bills
  numbers S. 6604 and A. 6949, in  relation  to  regulation  of  certain
  closed-loop  boreholes  installed  for  the  purpose of facilitating a
  geothermal heating or cooling system
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Subdivisions 4 and 5 of section 1 of a chapter of the laws
 of 2023 amending the environmental conservation law relating to  exempt-
 ing certain geothermal boreholes at depths beyond five hundred feet from
 certain  requirements,  as proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 6604
 and A. 6949, are amended to read as follows:
  4. [Extension of the] APPROPRIATE permitting rules [currently  applied
 to  closed-loop  geothermal systems less than five hundred feet deep to]
 FOR closed-loop geothermal boreholes deeper than five hundred feet  will
 reduce  the  cost  of  meeting New York state's building decarbonization
 requirements by nearly $9.9 billion by 2050; reduce the cost of  meeting
 the  state's  goal of electrifying one million homes by 2030 by approxi-
 mately $900 million; and reduce the cost  of  electrifying  85%  of  the
 state's  building  stock  by  approximately  $9 billion between 2030 and
 2050, in 2023 dollars.  In  nominal  dollars,  the  total  cost  savings
 increase to $16.3 billion by 2050.
  5.  [Extension of the] APPROPRIATE permitting rules [currently applied
 to closed-loop geothermal systems less than five hundred  feet  deep  to
 such] FOR FACILITATING CLOSED-LOOP GEOTHERMAL boreholes deeper than five
 hundred feet will obviate unnecessary technical and permitting barriers,
 open  new  markets  to clean heating and cooling technologies in densely
 populated regions, and enable drastically increased leverage of  federal
 funding to meet New York state's emissions reductions targets.
