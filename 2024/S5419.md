 ized New York state snowmobile club that is a trail  maintenance  entity
 and  a  member  of  the  New  York  state snowmobile association for the
 purposes of this subdivision.
  §  2. Section 21.07 of the parks, recreation and historic preservation
 law, as amended by chapter 609 of the laws of 2005, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  §  21.07  Fee  for snowmobile trail development and maintenance.  1. A

  2. Notwithstanding the fee as established in subdivision one  of  this

 who provides proof at the time of registration, that such individual  is
 a member of an organized New York state snowmobile club that is a member

 and a member of the New York state  snowmobile  association,  shall  pay
 [thirty-five]  FIFTY-FIVE dollars for each snowmobile for the snowmobile

  §  3.  Subdivisions  3 and 5 of section 27.17 of the parks, recreation
 and historic preservation law, subdivision 3 as amended by section 2  of
 part G of chapter 82 of the laws of 2002 and subdivision 5 as amended by
 chapter 88 of the laws of 1988, are amended to read as follows:
  3. Every county or, where applicable, any city, town or village within
 such county, shall be eligible for a grant for the development and main-
 tenance  of  a  system  of snowmobile trails and a program with relation
 thereto within its boundaries. Such grants shall be made by the  commis-
 sioner  and may constitute up to one hundred percent of the cost of such
 program including expenditures incurred for signs and markers of snowmo-
 bile trails. Any county or, where applicable, any city, town or  village
 within  such county, applying for such grant shall submit to the commis-
 sioner by September first of each year an [estimate of such expenditures
 for the current fiscal year,] APPLICATION in such  form  and  containing
 such  information  as  the  commissioner  may  require. No city, town or
 village may apply for such grant where the county  within  which  it  is
 contained has submitted an application for the same fiscal year. For the
 purpose  of this section, "fiscal year" shall mean the period from April
 first through March thirty-first. The commissioner shall review all such
 applications and shall determine the amount of state aid to be allocated
 to each county or, where applicable, any city, town  or  village  within
 such  county  in  accordance  with the provisions of subdivision five of
 this section. Of the amount the commissioner determines each county  or,
 where applicable, any city, town or village within such county is eligi-
 ble to receive, seventy percent shall be made available for distribution
 by November first and thirty percent for distribution upon demonstration
 of  completion,  submitted by June first[, of the program] FOLLOWING THE
 PROJECT YEAR, OR SUCH DATE AS CONTAINED IN THE APPLICATION.
 S. 5419  3
 
  5. The amount of state aid to be allocated to each  county  or,  where
 applicable, any city, town or village within such county, shall be drawn
 upon  the monies remaining in the snowmobile trail development and main-
 tenance fund after withdrawal pursuant to subdivisions two and  four  of
 this  section and shall be determined by the commissioner as hereinafter
 provided. [The commissioner shall determine  the  percentage  proportion
 which  the  authorized  expenditures of each individual county or, where
 applicable, any city, town or village within such county shall  bear  to
 the  total authorized expenditures of all the counties, cities, towns or
 villages for snowmobile trail development and  maintenance  pursuant  to
 this  section  during  the fiscal year. Such percentage proportion shall
 then be applied against the amount received in additional  fees  imposed
 by  section 21.07 of this chapter for registration of snowmobiles during
 such fiscal year, to the extent only and not exceeding  the  balance  of
 such  fund  remaining after the payment of expenses as set forth in this
 section. The amount thus determined shall constitute the maximum  amount
 of  state  aid to which each county or, where applicable, any city, town
 or village within such county, shall be entitled. The commissioner shall
 certify to the comptroller the amount thus determined  for  each  county
 or,  where  applicable, any city, town or village within such county, as
 the amount of state aid to be  apportioned  to  such  county  or,  where
 applicable,  any  city, town or village within such county.] THE COMMIS-
 SIONER SHALL ESTIMATE AN AMOUNT THAT IS AVAILABLE  FOR  STATE  AID,  AND
 SHALL  DEFINE  AND  ESTABLISH A BASE RATE PER MILE OF TRAIL, WHICH SHALL
 CONSTITUTE THE BASE GRANT TO EACH LOCAL SPONSOR.  FOR THE PURPOSES  OF
 THIS  SECTION,  LOCAL SPONSOR SHALL MEAN A COUNTY ENGAGING AND ASSISTING
 IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A SYSTEM OF SNOWMOBILE TRAILS  AND
 A PROGRAM WITH RELATION THERETO WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES TO ENCOURAGE SAFE-
 TY, TOURISM AND UTILIZATION, OR IN THE EVENT A COUNTY DOES NOT UNDERTAKE
 SUCH  A  PROGRAM  OR  SYSTEM OF TRAILS, ANY CITY, TOWN OR VILLAGE WITHIN
 SUCH COUNTY WHICH UNDERTAKES THE SAME. SUCH STATE AID SHALL BE  PROVIDED
 AS  DESCRIBED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL
 PAY OVER TO THE MUNICIPAL SPONSOR THE THIRTY PERCENT OF THE  OUTSTANDING
 BASE  GRANT UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT. THE COMMISSIONER, IN CONSUL-
 TATION WITH THE DIVISION OF BUDGET, MAY PAY EXPENSES IN  EXCESS  OF  THE
 BASE  GRANT  WHEN  THE  MUNICIPAL  SPONSOR CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT APPROVED
 EXPENSES EXCEEDED AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR IN  THE  COMBINED  PAYMENTS,  AND
 ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE SNOWMOBILE TRAIL DEVELOPMENT AND
 MAINTENANCE  FUND. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL CALCULATE ALL EXPENSES SUBMIT-
 TED IN EXCESS OF THE BASE GRANT AND MAY DISTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL AID  ON  A
 PRORATED BASIS TO SUPPORT SUCH EXPENSES.
  §  4.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
 on or before such effective date.
