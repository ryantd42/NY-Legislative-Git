  Section  1. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 1 of arti-

  Exemptions  from  taxation  may  be  granted  only  by  general  laws.
 Exemptions  may  be  altered  or repealed except those exempting real or
 personal property used exclusively for religious, educational or  chari-
 table purposes as defined by law and owned by any corporation or associ-
 ation  organized  or  conducted  exclusively  for  one  or  more of such
 purposes  and  not  operating  for  profit;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT
 EXEMPTIONS  OF  REAL  OR  PERSONAL PROPERTY USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR PRIVATE
 INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION MAY  BE  ALTERED  OR  REPEALED  BY  THE
 PASSAGE  OF A PRIVATE BILL BY THE LEGISLATURE AND APPROVAL BY THE GOVER-
 NOR.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That the foregoing be referred
