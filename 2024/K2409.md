  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2024, as Reunification Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, All children need the care, love, security and stability of
family,  including  parents,  siblings,  grandparents and other extended
family members to  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  personal  growth,
development and maturity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2024, as Reunification  Month  in
the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Reunification Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  year's  theme,  "Reunification:  Shifting  Power  and
Reconnecting  Families  All Year Long," focuses on: when children cannot
safely remain  with  their  parents  and  need  to  enter  foster  care,
reunifying  them  with  family  remains  the  primary  goal;  authentic,
equitable family engagement  and  integrating  the  voice  of  children,
youth,  and  families  into  the  case planning and court processes; and
enhancing birth parent-foster parent partnerships to improve the  foster
care  experience for children, youth, and parents when a child's removal
from the home is necessary and to support reunification; and
 
  WHEREAS, Reunification with family  is  the  preferred  outcome  for
children  removed  from  their homes and placed in foster care; for most
children in foster care, reunification with their family is  their  best
option for a permanent and loving home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People  looking  to  encourage  family  reunification  may
utilize  strategies  that  build  on  family  strengths,  including:
encouraging  family  engagement;  maintaining  family  and  cultural
connections; connecting families  to  evidenced-based  services  in  the
community; facilitating regular and frequent visits among family members
with the caseworker present; and promoting parent education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  most  effective  foster  caregivers  encourage
reunification by extending their role beyond supporting the children  in
their  care  to  supporting  the  children's  whole  family,  working to
maintain  positive  partnerships  between  birth  parents,  caregivers,
caseworkers,  and  older  youth  increase  the  chances  of  successful
reunifications; and
 
  WHEREAS, Reunification takes work,  commitment,  and  investment  of
time  and  resources  by parents, family members, social workers, foster
parents, service providers, attorneys, courts, and the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Child welfare agencies, courts, schools, businesses, media,
religious institutions, civic, and service organizations  are  urged  to
commemorate National Reunification Month with appropriate ceremonies and
activities  in  acknowledgement of the importance of supporting families
and communities; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  June  2024,  as
Reunification Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
