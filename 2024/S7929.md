 THIS  SECTION, "RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING" MEANS AN INVESTIGATION OF
 THE ENTIRE HUMAN GENOME, INCLUDING CODING  AND  NON-CODING  REGIONS  AND
 MITOCHONDRIAL DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID, TO IDENTIFY DISEASE-CAUSING GENETIC
 CHANGES  THAT RETURNS THE PRELIMINARY POSITIVE RESULTS WITHIN SEVEN DAYS
 AND FINAL RESULTS WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS FROM THE DATE OF  RECEIPT  OF  THE
 SAMPLE  BY  THE LAB PERFORMING THE TEST. "RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING"
 INCLUDES PATIENT-ONLY WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING AND  DUO  AND  TRIO  WHOLE
