  COMMEMORATING  the 95th Anniversary of the Capitol
  Theatre in Rome, New York on December 10, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor  and  pay
tribute  to  those  cultural  institutions  and  organizations  whose
commitment to promoting the richness  and  diversity  of  the  arts  and
entertainment  world  has  contributed  to  the  strength, vitality, and
cultural enrichment of their communities and  the  great  State  of  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern, and fully in accord with its
long-standing traditions, it gives this Legislative Body great  pleasure
to  commemorate  the 95th Anniversary of the Capitol Theatre, celebrated
with a series of history-related events throughout the year, culminating
with the 95th Anniversary show on Sunday, December 10, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Capitol Theatre opened its doors for the first time  on
Monday  evening,  December  10,  1928,  as  a  joint venture by the M.E.
Commerford  Amusement  Company  of  Scranton,  Pennsylvania  and  Kallet
Theaters,  Inc.,  headquartered  in  Oneida,  New  York; the theater was
designed by Leon H. Lempert, Jr., and was the first building in the city
to be purpose-built as a movie house; and
 
  WHEREAS, With Joseph Kallet as Managing  Director  of  the  theater,
Rome's  first  theatre  with  the  ability  to play the new sound movies
displayed their initial showing on their opening day, which  included  a
newsreel,  two  Vitaphone shorts, and the First National feature, "Lilac
Time," starring Colleen Moore and Gary Cooper, with accompanying  music;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Visitors  attending  the  Capitol Theatre originally would
experience a Spanish-Moroccan themed interior with brown,  gold,  blues,
and  reds,  however  in 1939, the Capitol Theatre received a modernistic
design which is preserved to this day with geometric shapes  of  yellow,
green,  orange,  red,  gold,  and  silver  hues  decorating the historic
building and a 1,788 seat auditorium; and
 
  WHEREAS, Though primarily made to be a movie house by  the  Kallets,
in  1929 the Capitol Theatre hosted its first celebrity act with the Art
Kahn's Orchestra performing on the Capitol stage; after that, many  live
performances  graced  the theatre, such as the California Ramblers, Paul
Whiteman's Rhythm Boys, the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra, Bill Haley &  the
Comets' and others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Capitol Theatre closed its doors on May 28, 1974, but
was later revived in 1985 by a group of dedicated individuals who opened
the Capitol Civic Center as a not-for-profit corporation to preserve the
arts in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, there are over 100  performances  per  year  at  the
historic  Capitol  Theatre;  the  amazing  establishment  features  live
theatrical  performances  of  SummerStage,  world  famous  bands,  dance
programs, and classic silent and talking films; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The Capitol Arts Complex, a not-for-profit organization in
Rome, New York, provides the community with artistic and cultural events
of all spectrums; they  host  classic  films  at  the  Capitol  Theatre,
independent and foreign films at Cinema Capitol, the Rising Stars acting
program  for  youth,  SummerStage,  and Capitolfest to strengthen Rome's
Downtown Arts District; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Capitol Theatre is in direct correlation
to the efforts of its leadership staff and supporters, whose involvement
is, and always has been, characterized by an impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the theatre and the population it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The arts are the building blocks of civilization; they  are
central  to  human  expression;  they  enlighten  us  and  inspire  the
imagination; educational institutions,  individuals,  and  organizations
which  further  such  worthy  purposes  richly merit the recognition and
appreciation of this Legislative Body and the people of the State of New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the Capitol Theatre looks back with great pride  to  its
beginnings,  viewing,  with just satisfaction, its successful evolution,
it renews both its dedication to supporting artistic excellence, and its
commitment to the community it has served  since  1928,  expressing  its
appreciation to all those who have helped to sustain and enhance it over
the years; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 95th Anniversary of the Capitol  Theatre  in  Rome,  New
York on December 10, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Art Pierce, Executive Director, Capitol Theatre.
