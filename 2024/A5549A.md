 formation of a manufactured homeowners' association.
  2.  [(a)  If a manufactured home park owner receives a bona fide offer
 to purchase a manufactured home park that such  manufactured  home  park
 owner  intends  to accept, or respond with a counteroffer, such manufac-
 tured home  park  owner  shall  require  the  prospective  purchaser  to
 provide, in writing, the certification required by paragraph (b) of this
 subdivision,  and  shall  not  accept any offer to purchase, nor respond
 with a counteroffer until such manufactured home park owner has received
 such certification and met the requirements of this section.
  (b) A purchaser seeking to purchase a manufactured home park,  or  the
 land  upon which a manufactured home park is located, shall provide such
 owner with a written letter certifying  whether  or  not  the  purchaser
 will,  upon  the closing of the sale of the park, or within sixty months

 purchaser of a manufactured home park shall be subject to the  right  of

 section  that  he  intends to change the use of the land,] such manufac-
 tured home park owner shall notify:

 been notified of the establishment of a manufactured homeowners' associ-
 ation and been provided with the names and addresses of the officers  of

 the price specified in the notice to the homeowners' association  or  at
 terms  substantially  different from those presented to the association,
 the park owner has no further obligations under this section.
  [(iii)] (IV) If the park owner, after such one hundred forty day peri-
 od, elects to offer to sell the park at a price  lower  than  the  price
 specified  in  the notice given or at terms substantially different from

 ciation.

 writing. During this time period, the park  owner  shall  not  accept  a
 final unconditional offer to purchase the park[.];
  (ii) If the homeowners fail to form a manufactured homeowners' associ-
 ation,  or  if  upon the formation of a manufactured homeowners' associ-
 ation, the association does not deliver an executed offer to purchase as

 forty  day  period, then, unless the park owner elects to offer the park
 at a price lower than the  price  specified  in  the  notice  previously
 presented  to  the  homeowners, the park owner has no further obligation
 under this section; and
  (iii) If the park owner thereafter elects to sell the park at a  price
 lower  than  the  price  specified in the notice to the homeowners or at
 terms substantially different from those previously presented, then  the
