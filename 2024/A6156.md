  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation would amend provisions of
 the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to reopen the 55/25  Plans
 for  active or retired Tier 2 and Tier 4 City Council employees who were
 New York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) members and employed
 in such position as of June 28, 1995.
  Effective Date: The 90th day after enactment.
  BACKGROUND: Tier 2 or Tier 4 members who were employed in an  Eligible
 Position  on  June 28, 1995 had an option, pursuant to Chapter 96 of the
 Laws of 1995, to join the 55/25 Plans by filing an  election  form  with
 NYCERS  within  90  days. Eligible Members who failed to elect the 55/25
 Plans, or other plans enacted by Chapter 96, generally participate in  a
 Basic 62/5 Plan.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation, active and retired members who were
 City Council employees on June 28, 1995 would be  allowed  to  join  the
 55/25  Plans at any time after the Effective Date of the proposed legis-
 lation. Such members would be required  to  pay  any  additional  member
 contributions required by the 55/25 Plans.
  IMPACT  ON  PAYABILITY:  Currently,  members  in a Basic 62/5 Plan can
 begin collecting an unreduced pension at age 62 with at least five years
 of service, or as early as age 55 with benefit reductions  depending  on
 their  age  of  retirement.  Electing  the  55/25 Plans would allow such
 A. 6156  5
 
 members to begin collecting an unreduced pension, assuming at  least  25
 years of service, at age 55.
  Members  who have already retired with at least 25 years of service at
 retirement but whose benefit was reduced due to their age at retirement,
 would be able to elect to join the 55/25 Plans and have  their  benefits
 recalculated. They would also receive a retroactive payment equal to the
 difference between their current benefit and revised benefit as of their
 retirement date.
  MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS: Members of the 55/25 Plans are required to make,
 in  addition  to the Basic Member Contributions (BMCs) of 3%, Additional
 Member Contributions (AMCs) ranging from 1.85% to  4.35%  (depending  on
 the dates of service rendered) until the attainment of 25 or 30 years of
 credited  service,  depending  on Tier.  Active and retired members who
 join the Plans through this legislation will be required  to  contribute
 any AMCs, with interest, they would have had to make had they joined the
 plans  in  1995.  It  has  been assumed that interest on such AMCs would
 cease accruing on the earlier of the date of payment or retirement date.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on the anticipated  group  of
 members  electing  to join the 55/25 Plans and the actuarial assumptions
 and methods described herein, the enactment of this proposed legislation
 would result in an increase in the  present  value  of  future  employer
 contributions of approximately $536,000.
  This  net  increase is a result of an increase in the Present Value of
 Future Benefits (PVFB) of approximately $1.6 million and an increase  in
 the  present value of member contributions of approximately $1.1 million
 which includes the required retroactive AMCs.
  Under the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the  employer
 contributions  to  NYCERS,  there  would  be an increase in the Unfunded
 Accrued Liability (UAL) of approximately $884,000 offset by  a  decrease
 in  the  present  value  of future employer Normal Cost of approximately
 $348,000.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - ANNUAL EMPLOYER  CONTRIBUTIONS:  The  enactment  of
 this proposed legislation would result in an increase in annual employer
 contributions  over the next five years of approximately $359,000 in the
 first year and $167,000 in years two through five.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining  working  lifetime  for  active  members of this group is
 approximately six years and the increase in UAL for actives  was  there-
 fore  amortized over a six-year period (five payments under the One-Year
 Lag Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  For members who would benefit that are retired, and therefore have  no
 remaining  working  lifetime, the entire increase in UAL would be recog-
 nized immediately.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used  in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS to deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The 16 NYCERS City Council members assumed to elect the 55/25 Plans as
 of June 30, 2022 include 13  active  members  and  three  retirees.  The
 active  members  had an average age of approximately 53.9 years, average
 service of approximately 30.6 years, and an average salary  of  approxi-
 mately $109,200. The three retired members had an average age of approx-
 imately  65.7  years,  and  an  average  annual benefit of approximately
 $43,400.
 A. 6156  6

  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  To  determine the impact of the elective nature of the proposed legis-
 lation, a subgroup of NYCERS City Council members was developed based on
 who is assumed to benefit actuarially by comparing the net present value
 of future employer costs of each member's benefit  under  their  current
 plan and under the 55/25 Plan.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  * The  initial,  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  *  The  impact  of  this  proposed legislation on Other Postemployment
 Benefit costs.
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: I, Marek  Tyszkiewicz,  am  the  Chief
 Actuary  for,  and  independent of, the New York City Retirement Systems
 and Pension Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries  and  a
 Member of the American Academy of Actuaries. I am a member of NYCERS but
 do  not  believe  it impairs my objectivity and I meet the Qualification
 Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries to render  the  actuarial
 opinion  contained  herein.  To  the  best  of my knowledge, the results
 contained  herein  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally
 accepted  actuarial  principles  and  procedures  and with the Actuarial
 Standards of Practice issued by the Actuarial Standards Board.
  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note 2023-10 dated  March  14,
 2023  was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City Employees'
 Retirement System. This estimate is intended for  use  only  during  the
 2023 Legislative Session.
