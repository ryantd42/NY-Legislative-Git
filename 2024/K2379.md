  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2024, as Blood Cancer Awareness  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2024, as Blood
Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Blood Cancer Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, During September, National  Blood  Cancer  Awareness  Month
sheds  light on the cancers that affect the blood and lymphatic systems;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital observance focuses its attention  on  all  blood
cancers,  including  leukemia,  lymphoma,  multiple  myeloma,  and
myelodysplastic syndromes; by raising awareness, the goal is  to  inform
the  public  about  the  causes  of  blood  cancers, how to identify the
symptoms, available treatments, and progress made through research; and
 
  WHEREAS, Blood cancers affect white blood cells or  in  some  cases,
red  blood  cells  or  platelets;  while  no effective screening exists,
knowing the symptoms and risk factors helps to understand when to see  a
doctor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Symptoms  of  blood  cancers include: lymph node swelling,
persistent fatigue, night  sweats,  fever,  difficulty  catching  breath
and/or unexplained weight loss; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Risk  factors  of  blood  cancers include: family history,
genetic disorders,  smoking,  exposure  to  radiation  or  chemotherapy,
individuals  with HIV who take immune-suppressing drugs, and people with
Epstein-Barr; and
 
  WHEREAS, Although the leukemia survival rate  has  quadrupled  since
1960,  in  the  United States, approximately 14,000 people are diagnosed
with blood cancers every month; depending on the  type  of  cancer,  the
survival rate varies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hodgkin's lymphoma, for example, has a much higher survival
rate  and  is  diagnosed  less often; conversely, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
will be diagnosed more often  and  will  have  a  lower  expectation  of
survival; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Even though survival rates continue to improve, someone in
the United States dies from a blood cancer every nine  minutes;  in  the
United  States,  nearly  10% of the people who die from cancer, die from
blood cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, Awareness and education are powerful tools in the  race  to
find a cure for blood cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  health  and  vitality  of  the people of New York are
significantly enhanced by local efforts to  increase  communication  and
education pertaining to blood cancers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 2024,  as  Blood
Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
