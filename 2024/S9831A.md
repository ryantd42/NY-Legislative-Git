  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow a beneficiary of any member of a public  retire-
 ment  system  to  be  paid an accidental death benefit, as if the member
 died in the performance and discharge of duty, provided that the member
  a) physically reported for work on or after March 1, 2020,
  b) contracted COVID-19 within 45 days from such work date, and
  c) died from such disease on or before July 31, 2025.
  In addition to the first two criteria state above, Chapter 783 of  the
 Laws  of  2022 currently requires a member to have died from COVID-19 on
 or before December 31, 2024.
  A positive test result, death certificate citing COVID-19, or  certif-
 ication  by  certain  medical  personnel  is  sufficient  to  establish
 contraction and death from COVID-19.
  The accidental death benefit would  be  based  on  the  member's  plan
 coverage.  This bill also would create benefits payable under the Public
 Authorities Law.
  Under section 13 of chapter 78 of the laws  of  2021,  as  amended  by
 chapter  783  of  the  laws of 2022, the provisions of Section 25 of the
 Retirement and Social Security Law shall not apply.
  Insofar as this bill would affect the New York State and Local  Police
 and  Fire  Retirement System (NYSLPFRS) and the New York State and Local
 Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS), qualifying COVID-19 deaths which
 currently are considered ordinary deaths will be treated  as  accidental
 deaths.  The  cost  of  the proposed benefit will depend upon the appli-
 cant's age, service, salary, plan, and benefit type otherwise payable.
 
  Service Retirement Eligible:  Yes  No
  NYSLPFRS Benefit Increase/Cost:  10 times salary  15 times salary
  NYSLERS Benefit Increase/Cost:  4.5 times salary  4.5 times salary
 
  The number of members and retirees  who  could  be  affected  by  this
 legislation  cannot  be  readily  determined.  However, all NYSLPFRS and
 NYSLERS members will be covered and eligible for these benefits, includ-
 ing new hires through the expiration of the coverage provided under this
 legislation.
  All costs incurred in the NYSLPFRS will be shared by the State of  New
 York  and  the  local participating employers in the NYSLPFRS. All costs
 incurred in the NYSLERS will be shared by the State of New York and  the
 local participating employers in the NYSLERS.
  In addition to these per-person costs, there would be annual increases
 in  administrative  and  legal costs to implement the provisions of this
 legislation.

  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate,  dated  June 4, 2024, and intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2024-199,  prepared  by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  fiscal  note was requested by the New York State Senate Majority
 Conference. Pursuant to Section 50 of the Legislative  Law,  the  fiscal
 note that must be appended in its entirety to this bill is:
  This  bill  would extend the provisions of the COVID-19 enhanced death
 benefit provided under Chapter 78 of the Laws of  2021  until  July  31,
 2025 for eligible active members of the New York State Teachers' Retire-
 ment  System  (NYSTRS)  who die due to contracting COVID-19. The current
 expiration date is December 31, 2024. Chapter 78 of  the  Laws  of  2021
 provides  a  member's  statutory  beneficiary  with the accidental death
 benefit, consisting of a lifetime annuity of 50% of  the  member's  most
 recent  year's salary. Under current law the death benefit for an active
 member who dies in service, not due to  COVID-19,  with  three  or  more
 years  of  active service is a lump-sum benefit equal to three times the
 member's most recent year's salary. An active member must have  reported
 to  work  on  or  after March 1, 2020, and contracted COVID-19 within 45
 days of reporting to work, and then died either due to COVID-19, or  had
 COVID-19 as a contributing factor in the member's death.
  The  overall  cost  of  this  bill cannot be readily determined as the
 ultimate number of COVID-19 deaths cannot be determined at this time. It
 is estimated that it will provide on  average  an  additional  cost  per
 affected  member of 3 to 4 times salary. The average cost per individual
 member impacted in terms of the additional present value  of  liability,
 is estimated as follows:
  Member age 30: $240,000
  Member age 40: $310,000
  Member age 50: $340,000
  The  actual cost per member would be dependent on the member and bene-
 ficiary's age, tier, years of service, and salary. The costs  above  are
 determined  based  on averages, so the actual cost for a member could be
 higher or lower.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can
 be found in the System's Annual Report for fiscal year  ended  June  30,
 2023. System assets are as reported in the System's financial statements

 and  can  also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuarial assump-
 tions and methods are  provided  in  the  System's  Actuarial  Valuation
 Report as of June 30, 2023.
  The  source of this estimate is Fiscal Note 2024-36 dated June 4, 2024
 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New  York  State  Teachers'
 Retirement  System and is intended for use only during the 2024 Legisla-
 tive Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the New York
 State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the American Academy
