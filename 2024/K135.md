  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
Thursday, February 23, 2023, as Student Press Freedom Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  February  23,  2023,  the  Student Press Law Center is
holding a day of action known as Student Press Freedom  Day,  with  this
year's theme being "Bold Journalism & Brave Advocacy"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Student  Press  Law  Center  will  host  and  promote
trainings and community building  opportunities  that  are  designed  to
uplift  student  journalists'  voices  and  prepare them to advocate for
press freedom; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Student Press  Law  Center  established  Student  Press
Freedom Day in 2018 to mark the 30th anniversary of the Hazelwood School
District v. Kuhlmeier Supreme Court case; this case greatly expanded the
ability of school officials to censor student work; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Student  Press  Freedom  Day  responds  to  this  case  by
celebrating the  field  of  student  journalism,  promoting  freedom  of
speech, and advocating for liberty from censorship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Journalism  is  a  pillar of democracy and a free press is
protected by the U.S.  Constitution,  the  responsibility  and  freedoms
allowed  therein  should  apply  to  student  journalists  guided  by
educational institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Journalists and media across the country, which are  needed
in a democratic society, have come under attack; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  Voices  of  New  York,  the  high  school  student
organization in New York which advocates  for  student  press  freedoms,
promotes the passage of the Student Journalist Free Speech Act; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  integrity  of  journalism is derived from the Code of
Ethics as determined by the Society of Professional Journalists; and
 
  WHEREAS, Student reporters are the next generation  of  journalists;
recognizing  the  importance of the profession will support journalistic
integrity  and  independence  for  journalists  of  the  future;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize February 23, 2023, as Student Press Freedom  Day;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Student Press Law Center and New Voices of  New  York
chapters throughout the State of New York.
