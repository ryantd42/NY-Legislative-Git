  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph 1 of subsection (c-1) of section 606 of the tax
 law, as amended by section 1 of part P of chapter  59  of  the  laws  of
 2018, is amended to read as follows:
  (1)  A  resident taxpayer shall be allowed a credit as provided herein
 equal to the greater of one hundred dollars times the number of qualify-
 ing children of the taxpayer or the applicable percentage of  the  child
 tax  credit allowed the taxpayer under section twenty-four of the inter-
 nal revenue code for the same taxable year for  each  qualifying  child.
 Provided,  however,  in  the  case  of a taxpayer whose federal adjusted
 gross income exceeds  the  applicable  threshold  amount  set  forth  by
 section  24(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, the credit shall only be
 equal to the applicable percentage of the child tax credit  allowed  the
 taxpayer under section 24 of the Internal Revenue Code for each qualify-
 ing child. For the purposes of this subsection, a qualifying child shall
 be  a  child  who  meets the definition of qualified child under section
 24(c) of the internal revenue code [and is at least four years of  age].
 The  applicable  percentage  shall  be thirty-three percent OR SIXTY-SIX
 PERCENT FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE FOUR FOR THE TAXABLE  YEAR  BEGINNING  IN
 TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR. For purposes of this subsection, any reference
 to  section 24 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be a reference to such
 section as it existed immediately prior to the enactment of  Public  Law
 115-97.
  § 2. This act shall take effect April 1, 2024.
