BY: M. of A. Wallace
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th Anniversary of the Doyle
  Hose Company No. 2 of Cheektowaga, New York,  to  be
  celebrated on April 10, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is proud to commemorate the 100th
Anniversary of the Doyle Hose Company No. 2 and to honor  its  past  and
present  firefighting  members  for 100 years of fire protection for the
citizens of Cheektowaga, New York, and its  surrounding  communities  on
Wednesday, April 10, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fire  departments  are  an  integral  part  of  community
protection services in every locality of our State; during the past  100
years, the courageous and devoted firefighters of the Doyle Hose Company
No. 2 have valiantly responded to all types of fire emergencies and have
won the praise and respect of the community which they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters serve without pay, devote hundreds
of hours of time away from family, and in many  cases  spend  their  own
money  on  firefighting gear and bear the responsibility for recruitment
and retention to maintain organizational stability; and
 
  WHEREAS, On February 24, 1924, at a regular meeting of  the  Clinton
Garden Taxpayers' Association, held at Joseph Galamb's Hall, a motion to
organize a fire department was made by Peter Kojm and seconded by Andrew
Partacz;  the objective was to obtain lower fire insurance rates for the
community; and
 
  WHEREAS, On April 10, 1924, the Doyle Hose Company No. 2 was founded
with the following men  joining:  Peter  Kojm,  Stephen  Rogowski,  Gust
Kalwicki,  Joseph  Galamb,  Albert  Krawczyk,  Ambrose  Cegielski,  Adam
Strauch, Michael Nikel,  Stanley  Michalski,  Herbert  Hunsinger,  Louis
Lubecki,  Valentine  Stachowski,  John  Krinke,  Frank  Tokasz,  Frank
Witkowski, Casimir Witkowski, and Edward Witkowski; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a membership of dedicated firefighters, the record  of
the  Doyle  Hose  Company No. 2 in public service and fire protection is
one to be applauded; for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for 100 years,
whenever the alarm sounded, these noble volunteers left their homes  and
went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The brave firefighters of the Doyle Hose Company No. 2 are
prepared to risk their lives every day to help save the lives of  others
and  to  protect homes and property from the destruction caused by fire;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the skill and devoted  service  demonstrated
by  individual  firefighters,  the Doyle Hose Company No. 2 reflects the
history and development of firefighting over the past 100 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body cannot express  sufficient  gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment of their communities and publicly acknowledge the heroic good
works  performed  by the volunteer fire departments of this great Empire
State, their officers, and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly  commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the Doyle Hose Company No.
2 to be celebrated on April 10, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the members of the Doyle Hose Company No. 2.
