 THREE  YEARS.  THE AGENCY SHALL ESTABLISH PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED BY A
 POLICY HOLDER/OWNER IN THE EVENT OF A PAYMENT UNDER  THE  TERMS  OF  ANY
 HOME  EQUITY  PROTECTION  INSURANCE  POLICY.  THE  AGENCY  SHALL  NOT BE
 REQUIRED TO PAY ON A CLAIM FOR A LOSS OF EQUITY IF  IT  DETERMINES  THAT
 SUCH  LOSS OCCURRED PREDOMINANTLY FROM THE POLICY HOLDER/OWNER'S NEGLECT
 OF THE REAL PROPERTY'S PHYSICAL CONDITION.
  (3)(A) THE AGENCY SHALL CREATE A HOME EQUITY PROTECTION INSURANCE FUND
 TO BE USED AS A REVOLVING FUND FOR CARRYING OUT THE PROVISIONS  OF  THIS
 SECTION  WITH  RESPECT  TO RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY INSURED THEREUNDER.

 NY,  SAVINGS BANK OR SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION LOCATED AND AUTHORIZED

 GOVERNMENT; OR (B) IN OBLIGATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE
 STATE  WHICH MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE LEGALLY PURCHASED BY SAVINGS BANKS
 WITHIN THE STATE AS AN INVESTMENT OF FUNDS BELONGING TO THEM OR IN THEIR
 CONTROL, OR IN OBLIGATIONS OF THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE  ASSOCIATION
 PROVIDED  SUCH  OBLIGATIONS SHALL BE PAYABLE OR REDEEMABLE AT THE OPTION
 OF THE OWNER WITHIN SUCH TIMES AS THE PROCEEDS MAY  BE  NEEDED  TO  MEET
