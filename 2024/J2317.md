  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 18, 2024, as HIV Vaccine Awareness  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious public
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  18,  2024,  as  HIV
Vaccine  Awareness Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National HIV Vaccine Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, HIV  Vaccine  Awareness  Day  (HVAD)  is  an  annual  event
established  to  recognize  and  thank  the  thousands  of  volunteers,
community members, health professionals, and scientists who are  working
together  to  find a safe and effective HIV vaccine; it is also a day to
educate our Nation's communities about the importance of preventive  HIV
vaccine research; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More than 36 million people worldwide are living with HIV,
and more than 20 million lives have  been  lost  due  to  HIV  and  AIDS
related  illness;  the  need  for  an  HIV  vaccine remains urgent; once
infected, most people will eventually need to stay on treatment for  the
rest of their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In addition, treatments are complex, costly, and only slow
the disease, there is no cure; to ensure the end of  the  HIV  and  AIDS
epidemic, prevention is essential; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  vaccine  helps our body learn how to fight off a virus,
such as HIV; a preventive HIV vaccine would protect HIV-negative  people
from being infected with the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  long-term  goal is to develop a vaccine that protects
everyone from getting infected with HIV, however, even  a  vaccine  that
protects  only  some  people would still be very helpful; such a vaccine
could decrease the number of people who are  infected  with  HIV,  which
would  reduce  the number of people who can pass the virus on to others;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, researchers are looking  to  see  whether  HIV
vaccines  could  help  people  who  are  already  infected  with HIV; if
effective, such a vaccine would teach the body to control HIV infection,
so the progression from silent HIV infection to  full-blown  AIDS  would
happen much more slowly or could even be stopped; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  2024  targets  include  reducing the number of people
dying from HIV-related causes to fewer than 500,000;  based  on  current
estimates,  this  provides an opportunity to prevent over 400,000 deaths
per year; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of  HIV  Vaccine  Awareness  Day,  community
activities  and  media  events  will be held across the United States to
educate  communities  throughout  the  country  on  the  importance  of
preventative HIV and AIDS research; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious public health issue, and more  must  be  done  to  increase
activity at the local, State and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  18,  2024,  as  HIV
Vaccine Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
