  COMMEMORATING the 60th Anniversary of the Yorktown
  Volunteer Ambulance Corps
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
give outstanding service to the people of the  Empire  State  and  whose
extraordinary  achievements  save  the  lives  of  their fellow citizens
should be recognized because their efforts so profoundly strengthen  our
shared commitment to family and community life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  60th  Anniversary  of the Yorktown Volunteer Ambulance
Corps; and
 
  WHEREAS, Volunteer ambulance corps members are an important part  of
the  safety  net of America's healthcare system; they provide lifesaving
care to those in need, 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Access to quality emergency care dramatically improves  the
survival  and  recovery  rate  of those who experience sudden illness or
injury; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Yorktown Volunteer Ambulance Corps (YVAC) is a not  for
profit,  Basic Life Support provider, which has been providing Emergency
Medical Service to the Town of Yorktown, New York since 1963; and
 
  WHEREAS, YVAC has  the  distinct  honor  of  being  the  very  first
Ambulance  Corps  in Westchester County to provide 24 hours a day, seven
days a week EMT-I (Intermediate) service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, its membership is a diverse group of  citizens
drawn  from  all  walks of life, spanning more than 50 years in age with
varied interests and  skills,  but  all  with  the  common  interest  in
providing  emergency medical service and a strong desire to give back to
the community in which they reside; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  its  distinguished  60-year  history,  the  Yorktown
Volunteer  Ambulance  Corps  has  demonstrated continuous service to the
residents and communities which it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Yorktown Volunteer Ambulance Corps is in
direct correlation to the efforts of its volunteers,  whose  involvement
is,  and  always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an
unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard  of  excellence  in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion presents an opportunity for this
Legislative Body to recognize and  pay  tribute  to  Yorktown  Volunteer
Ambulance Corps; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
 
is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility their own by
serving as EMS volunteers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of  the  Yorktown  Volunteer  Ambulance
Corps; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Yorktown Volunteer Ambulance Corps.
