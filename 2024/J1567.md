  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 22-26, 2024, as Every Kid Healthy Week in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  citizens  of  the  State of New York are committed to
ensuring the safety and well-being of our most  precious  resource,  our
children,  and  to protecting them, in every facet of their daily lives;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  22-26,  2024, as Every Kid
Healthy Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Every Kid Health Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York's future relies upon its youth; more than 20% of
New York's population is under 18 years of age; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over 15.9% of New York's children are considered obese; and
 
  WHEREAS, Action For Healthy Kids (AFHK) is a  nationwide  grassroots
network  mobilizing  school  professionals,  families and communities to
take actions that lead to improvements in school-based foods,  nutrition
education, physical activity and education, all of which have been shown
to improve student health, learning and academic performance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Launched  by  AFHK  in  2013, Every Kid Healthy Week is an
annual observance designed to celebrate  school  wellness  achievements,
and  shine  a  spotlight  on  the  epidemic of childhood obesity and the
connection  between  healthy  eating,  physical  activity  and  academic
success; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  prevalence  of  children  in  New  York  considered
overweight or obese has increased since 2003; and
 
  WHEREAS, Being overweight as a child increases  the  risk  of  being
obese as a young adult; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Childhood  obesity  is a major health epidemic facing this
State, and these health concerns lead to higher health care  costs  that
negatively impact New York's taxpayers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Being  overweight  as  a  child can lead to serious health
problems,  such  as  heart  disease,  Type  2  diabetes,  asthma,  sleep
problems, low self-esteem and being bullied; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Regular  physical  activity  can  produce long-term health
benefits; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans
report issued by the  United  States  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services,  children,  and adolescents benefit from 60 minutes or more of
physical  activity  daily  through  a  combination  of  aerobic,  muscle
strengthening, and bone strengthening activities; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Health  benefits  for  children and adolescents associated
with regular physical activity include  improved  cardiorespiratory  and
muscular  fitness,  improved  bone  health,  favorable body composition,
reduced symptoms of depression and improved academic performance; and
 
  WHEREAS, Obesity and physical  inactivity  are  directly  linked  to
increasing public and private health care costs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nationally,  90%  of  annual  health  care expenditures go
toward  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  chronic  and  mental  health
conditions,  many  of  which  have  been  linked to obesity and physical
inactivity; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State  has  the  highest  health  care  costs  per
capita, ranking first in the Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  response  to  the  health challenges facing New York's
adolescents, many health clubs  in  this  State  have  created  programs
targeting  children  and  adolescents  and  have also developed specific
programs for families to exercise and live healthier lives together; and
 
  WHEREAS, Parents are a positive influence in helping their  children
eat healthier food and become more physically active; and
 
  WHEREAS, Promoting healthy behavior promotes a healthy population in
general,  reduces  health  care  costs and provides a healthier and more
productive work force; and
 
  WHEREAS, In order to improve  the  quality  of  life  for  many  New
Yorkers  and  to prevent an increased burden on its taxpayers, the State
needs to develop a coordinated approach to  addressing  the  problem  of
childhood obesity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Everyone  in  the  country  can  get involved in Every Kid
Healthy Week  and  be  a  part  of  the  solution  by  supporting  sound
nutrition,  regular  physical  activity and health-promoting programs at
their schools; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to  promote  the
coordination  of  activities  to  support  physical  activity,  and  to
encourage all New Yorkers to adopt a healthy lifestyle; now,  therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  22-26,  2024,  as
Every Kid Healthy Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
