 to a prevailing plaintiff.

 THE  COURT  SHALL  HAVE  EXCLUSIVE  JURISDICTION OVER SUCH CLAIM WITHOUT
 REGARD TO ANY DEFENSES  ALLEGED  OR  DOCTRINES  RAISED,  NOR  SHALL  ANY
 DEFENSE  ALLEGED OR DOCTRINE RAISED PRECLUDE THE COURT FROM ADJUDICATING
 THE MERITS OF ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THIS SECTION.

 of the laws of 1963, is amended to read as follows:
