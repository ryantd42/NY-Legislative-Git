and
 
  WHEREAS,  Essential to getting fresh and healthy food on supermarket
shelves, farmworkers grow, harvest, process  and  pack  fresh  food  for
stores  every  day;  nearly  2.6  million  farmworkers  are on farms and
ranches throughout the United States, performing hard and skilled labor;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Farmworkers are the root of the Nation's supply  chain  and
ensure  the  availability,  quality,  and  safety  of  our food; farmers
contribute $164.7 billion to the United States gross  domestic  product;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The celebration of National Farmworker Awareness Week is in
recognition  of  farmers  from  all  racial,  ethnic  and socio-economic
