  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 2024, as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness  Month
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in participating in
months designated to raise awareness of important issues; and
 
  WHEREAS,  November  2024  will  be  observed  as  Pancreatic  Cancer
Awareness  Month  to  create  awareness  of  pancreatic  cancer,  the
third-leading  cause  of cancer-related death among men and women in the
United States, and is anticipated to become the second leading cause  by
2030; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pancreatic cancer has the lowest relative survival rate of
all the cancers tracked by both the  American  Cancer  Society  and  the
National Cancer Institute; and
 
  WHEREAS,  74  percent  of  pancreatic cancer patients die within the
first year of their diagnosis and only seven percent survive  more  than
five years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  American Cancer Society expects 60,430 people (31,950
men and 28,480 women) will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in  2021,
and  48,220  people  will  die  from  the  disease in the United States;
further- more, the New York State Department of  Health  estimates  that
2,600 New Yorkers die from this disease annually; and
 
  WHEREAS, There has been no significant improvement in survival rates
in  the  last  40  years  and pancreatic cancer research is still in the
earliest scientific stages; and
 
  WHEREAS, The number of new pancreatic cancer cases and the number of
deaths caused by the disease are increasing; the expected number of  new
pancreatic  cancer  cases  is  projected  to increase by 55% between the
years 2010 and 2030; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When  symptoms  of  pancreatic  cancer  generally  present
themselves,  it  is  often too late for an optimistic prognosis, and the
average survival rate is only five to seven months; and
 
  WHEREAS, People of  Eastern  European  Jewish  and  African-American
descent  are  diagnosed  at  a  higher  frequency  than  the rest of the
population; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additional risk factors include  but  are  not  limited  to
smoking,  obesity,  recent on-set diabetes, family history of pancreatic
cancer and pancreatitis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pancreatic  cancer  research  is  currently  severely
underfunded  as  compared to other cancers with similar mortality; it is
urgent that we focus on this matter; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  November  2024,  as
Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month in the State of New York, and to  urge
its  citizens to educate themselves about pancreatic cancer and the need
for research funding, early detection methods, effective treatments, and
prevention programs; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
