 related] THE TERM "SIBLING" SHALL INCLUDE PERSONS WHOSE RELATIONSHIP  AS
 SIBLINGS  HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED through EITHER half blood, whole blood or
 adoption.
  (d) The real property tax or PILOT exemption on real property owned by
 [husband and wife] A MARRIED COUPLE, one of whom is sixty-five years  of

  §  2.  Subdivision  3  of section 467 of the real property tax law, as
 amended by section 1 of part B of chapter 686 of the laws of 2022, para-
 graph (a) as separately amended by chapter 488 of the laws of  2022,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  3. No exemption shall be granted:
  (a)  (I)  if  the  income  of  the owner or the combined income of the
 owners of the property for the APPLICABLE income tax  year  [immediately
 preceding  the date of making application for exemption] exceeds the sum
 of three thousand dollars, or such other sum not less than  three  thou-
 sand  dollars  nor more than [twenty-six thousand dollars beginning July
 first, two thousand six, twenty-seven thousand  dollars  beginning  July
 first,  two thousand seven, twenty-eight thousand dollars beginning July
 first, two thousand eight, twenty-nine thousand dollars  beginning  July
 first,  two  thousand nine, fifty thousand dollars beginning July first,

 or more fifty thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand seven-
 teen,]  FIFTY  THOUSAND  DOLLARS,  as  may be provided by the local law,

  (II) Where the taxable status date is on or before  April  fourteenth,
 THE  APPLICABLE  income tax year shall [mean] BE the twelve-month period
 for which the owner or owners filed a federal personal income tax return
 for the year before the income tax year immediately preceding  the  date
 of  application  and  where the taxable status date is on or after April
 fifteenth, THE APPLICABLE income tax year shall [mean]  BE  the  twelve-
 month  period  for  which  the  owner or owners filed a federal personal

 SPOUSE  may  not  exceed such sum, except where [the husband or wife, or
 ex-husband or ex-wife] ONE-SPOUSE OR EX-SPOUSE is absent from the  prop-
 erty  as provided in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of this subdivi-
 sion, then only the income of the spouse or ex-spouse  residing  on  the
 property  shall  be considered and may not exceed such sum. [Such income
 shall include social security and retirement benefits,  interest,  divi-
 dends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may
 be  offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the
 same income tax year, net rental income, salary  or  earnings,  and  net
 income  from self-employment, but shall not include a return of capital,
 gifts, inheritances, payments  made  to  individuals  because  of  their

 prescription drug expenses actually paid which were  not  reimbursed  or
 paid for by insurance, if the governing board of a municipality, after a
 public  hearing,  adopts  a local law, ordinance or resolution providing
 therefor. In  addition,  an  exchange  of  an  annuity  for  an  annuity
 contract,  which  resulted in non-taxable gain, as determined in section
 one thousand thirty-five of the internal revenue code, shall be excluded
 from such income. Provided that such exclusion shall be based on  satis-
 factory proof that such an exchange was solely an exchange of an annuity
 for  an  annuity contract that resulted in a non-taxable transfer deter-
 mined by such section of the internal revenue  code.  Furthermore,  such
 income  shall not include the proceeds of a reverse mortgage, as author-
 ized by section six-h of the  banking  law,  and  sections  two  hundred
 eighty  and  two  hundred  eighty-a  of the real property law; provided,
 however, that monies used  to  repay  a  reverse  mortgage  may  not  be
 deducted  from  income,  and  provided additionally that any interest or
 dividends realized from the  investment  of  reverse  mortgage  proceeds
 shall  be  considered  income. The provisions of this paragraph notwith-
 standing, such income shall  not  include  veterans  disability  compen-
 sation,  as  defined  in Title 38 of the United States Code provided the
 governing board of such municipality, after  public  hearing,  adopts  a
 local  law, ordinance or resolution providing therefor. In computing net
 rental income  and  net  income  from  self-employment  no  depreciation
 deduction  shall be allowed for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real or
 personal property held for the production of income;]
  (IV) THE TERM "INCOME" AS USED HEREIN SHALL MEAN THE  "ADJUSTED  GROSS
 INCOME"  FOR  FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AS REPORTED ON THE APPLICANT'S
 FEDERAL OR STATE INCOME TAX RETURN FOR THE APPLICABLE INCOME  TAX  YEAR,
 SUBJECT TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS OR REVISIONS, PLUS ANY SOCIAL SECU-
 RITY  BENEFITS  NOT  INCLUDED  IN  SUCH ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME, MINUS ANY
 DISTRIBUTIONS, TO THE EXTENT INCLUDED IN FEDERAL ADJUSTED GROSS  INCOME,
 RECEIVED FROM AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT AND AN INDIVIDUAL RETIRE-
 MENT ANNUITY; PROVIDED THAT IF NO SUCH RETURN WAS FILED FOR THE APPLICA-
 BLE INCOME TAX YEAR, THE APPLICANT'S INCOME SHALL BE DETERMINED BASED ON
 THE  AMOUNTS  THAT WOULD HAVE SO BEEN REPORTED IF SUCH A RETURN HAD BEEN
 FILED; AND PROVIDED FURTHER, THAT THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A  MUNICIPALITY
 MAY ADOPT A LOCAL LAW, ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROVIDING THAT ANY SOCIAL
 SECURITY  BENEFITS  THAT  WERE  NOT INCLUDED IN THE APPLICANT'S ADJUSTED
 GROSS INCOME SHALL  NOT  BE  CONSIDERED  INCOME  FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS
 SECTION;
  (b)  unless  the owner shall have held an exemption under this section
 for [his] THE OWNER'S previous residence or  unless  the  title  of  the
 property shall have been vested in the owner or one of the owners of the
 property  for  at  least  twelve consecutive months prior to the date of
 making application for exemption, provided, however, that in  the  event
 of  the  death  of  [either a husband or wife] A MARRIED PERSON in whose
 name title of the property shall have been vested at the time  of  death
 and then becomes vested solely in [the survivor] SUCH PERSON'S SURVIVING
 SPOUSE  by  virtue of devise by or descent from the deceased [husband or
 wife] SPOUSE, the time of ownership of  the  property  by  the  deceased
 [husband or wife] SPOUSE shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the
 [survivor]  SURVIVING  SPOUSE and such ownership shall be deemed contin-
 uous for the purposes of computing such  period  of  twelve  consecutive
 months.  In  the event of a transfer by [either a husband or wife to the
 other] A MARRIED PERSON TO SUCH PERSON'S spouse of all or  part  of  the
 A. 3009--B  44
 
 title  to  the  property,  the  time of ownership of the property by the
 transferor spouse shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the trans-
 feree spouse and such ownership  shall  be  deemed  continuous  for  the
 purposes  of  computing  such period of twelve consecutive months. Where
 property of the owner or owners has been acquired  to  replace  property
 formerly  owned  by  such owner or owners and taken by eminent domain or
 other involuntary proceeding, except a tax sale, the period of ownership
 of the former property shall be combined with the period of ownership of
 the property for which application is made for exemption and such  peri-
 ods  of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for purposes of this
 section. Where a residence is sold and replaced with another within  one
 year  and  both residences are within the state, the period of ownership
 of both properties shall be  deemed  consecutive  for  purposes  of  the
 exemption from taxation by a municipality within the state granting such
 exemption. Where the owner or owners transfer title to property which as
 of  the  date  of  transfer  was exempt from taxation or PILOT under the
 provisions of this section, the reacquisition of title by such owner  or
 owners  within  nine  months  of the date of transfer shall be deemed to
 satisfy the requirement of this paragraph that the title of the property
 shall have been vested in the owner or one of the owners for such period
 of twelve consecutive months. Where, upon or subsequent to the death  of
 an owner or owners, title to property which as of the date of such death
 was exempt from taxation or PILOT under such provisions, becomes vested,
 by  virtue of devise or descent from the deceased owner or owners, or by
 transfer by any other means within nine months after such death,  solely
 in  a  person or persons who, at the time of such death, maintained such
 property as a primary residence, the requirement of this paragraph  that
 the  title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or one of
 the owners for such period of twelve consecutive months shall be  deemed
 satisfied;
  (c)  unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes,
 provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is not
 so used exclusively for residential  purposes  but  is  used  for  other
 purposes,  such  portion  shall  be subject to taxation or PILOT and the
 remaining portion only shall be entitled to the  exemption  provided  by
 this section;
  (d) unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied
 in  whole or in part by the owner or by all of the owners of the proper-
 ty: except where, (i) an  owner  is  absent  from  the  residence  while
 receiving  health-related  care  as an inpatient of a residential health
 care facility, as defined in section twenty-eight  hundred  one  of  the
 public  health  law,  provided  that  any income accruing to that person
 shall only be income only to the extent that it exceeds the amount  paid
 by  such  owner,  spouse,  or  co-owner  for  care  in the facility, and
 provided further, that during such  confinement  such  property  is  not
 occupied  by  other  than the spouse or co-owner of such owner; or, (ii)
 the real property is owned by a [husband and/or wife, or  an  ex-husband
 and/or an ex-wife, and either] MARRIED PERSON OR A MARRIED COUPLE, OR BY
 A  FORMERLY  MARRIED PERSON OR A FORMERLY MARRIED COUPLE, AND ONE SPOUSE
 OR EX-SPOUSE is absent from the residence due to  divorce,  legal  sepa-
 ration  or  abandonment and all other provisions of this section are met
 provided that where  an  exemption  was  previously  granted  when  both
 resided  on the property, then the person remaining on the real property
 shall be sixty-two years of age or over.
 A. 3009--B  45
 
  § 3. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3-a of section 467 of the real prop-
 erty tax law, as amended by section 1 of part B of chapter  686  of  the
 laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  (a)  For  the  purposes of this section, title to that portion of real
 property owned  by  a  cooperative  apartment  corporation  in  which  a
 tenant-stockholder  of such corporation resides and which is represented
 by [his] THE TENANT-STOCKHOLDER'S share  or  shares  of  stock  in  such
 corporation  as  determined by its or their proportional relationship to
 the total outstanding stock of the corporation, including that owned  by
 the  corporation, shall be deemed to be vested in such tenant-stockhold-
 er.
  § 4. Subdivisions 5 and 5-a of section 467 of the  real  property  tax
 law,  as  amended  by  section 1 of part B of chapter 686 of the laws of

  5. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner, or all of
 the owners of the property, on forms prescribed by the  commissioner  to
 be  furnished  by  the appropriate assessing authority and shall furnish
 the information and be executed in the manner required or prescribed  in
 such  forms,  and  shall be filed in such assessor's office on or before
 the appropriate taxable status date. Notwithstanding any other provision
 of law, at the option of the municipal corporation, any person otherwise
 qualifying under this section shall not be denied  the  exemption  under
 this  section  if [he] SUCH PERSON becomes sixty-five years of age after
 the appropriate taxable status date and on or  before  December  thirty-
 first of the same year.
  5-a.  Any  local law or ordinance adopted pursuant to paragraph (a) of
 subdivision one of this section may be amended, or a local law or  ordi-
 nance  may  be  adopted  to provide, notwithstanding subdivision five of
 this section, that an application for such exemption may be  filed  with
 the  assessor  after  the  appropriate taxable status date but not later
 than the last date on which a petition with  respect  to  complaints  of
 assessment  may  be  filed,  where  failure to file a timely application
 resulted from: (a) a death of the applicant's  spouse,  child,  parent[,
 brother  or sister] OR SIBLING; or (b) an illness of the applicant or of
 the applicant's spouse, child, parent[, brother or sister]  OR  SIBLING,
 which  actually prevents the applicant from filing on a timely basis, as
 certified by a licensed physician. The assessor shall  approve  or  deny
 such application as if it had been filed on or before the taxable status
 date.
  §  5.  Subdivision  6  of section 467 of the real property tax law, as
 amended by section 1 of part B of chapter 686 of the laws  of  2022,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  6.  (a)  At  least  sixty days prior to the appropriate taxable status
 date, the assessing authority shall mail to each person who was  granted
 exemption  pursuant  to  this section on the latest completed assessment
 roll an application form and a notice  that  such  application  must  be
 filed  on or before the taxable status date and be approved in order for
 the exemption to be granted. The assessing authority shall, within three
 days of the completion and filing  of  the  tentative  assessment  roll,
 notify  by mail any applicant [who has included with his] WHOSE applica-
 tion INCLUDES at least one self-addressed,  pre-paid  envelope,  of  the
 approval  or  denial  of  the  application;  provided, however, that the
 assessing authority shall, upon the receipt and filing of  the  applica-
 tion,  send  by  mail  notification  of receipt to any applicant who has
 included two of such envelopes with the application. Where an  applicant
 is  entitled  to  a  notice of denial pursuant to this subdivision, such
 A. 3009--B  46
 
 notice shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall state
 the reasons for such denial and shall further state that  the  applicant
 may  have  such  determination  reviewed  in the manner provided by law.
 Failure  to  mail any such application form or notices or the failure of
 such person to receive any of the  same  shall  not  prevent  the  levy,
 collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes or PILOT on prop-
 erty owned by such person.
  (b)  Except  in cities of one million or more, any person who has been
 granted exemption pursuant to  this  section  on  five  (5)  consecutive
 completed  assessment  rolls, including any years when the exemption was
 granted to a property owned by [a husband and/or wife] A MARRIED  PERSON
 OR  A  MARRIED COUPLE while both SPOUSES resided in such property, shall
 not be subject to the requirements set forth in paragraph  (a)  of  this
 subdivision  provided  the  governing board of the municipality in which
 said property is situated after public hearing adopts a local law, ordi-
 nance or resolution providing therefor  however  said  person  shall  be
 mailed  an  application form and a notice [informing him of his] SETTING
 FORTH SUCH PERSON'S rights. Such exemption shall be automatically grant-
 ed on each subsequent assessment roll. Provided, however, that when  tax
 payment  is  made by such person a sworn affidavit must be included with
 such payment which shall state that such person continues to be eligible
 for such exemption. Such affidavit shall be on a form prescribed by  the
 commissioner.  If  such  affidavit is not included with the tax payment,
 the collecting officer shall proceed pursuant to  section  five  hundred
 fifty-one-a of this chapter.
  (c)  In cities of one million or more, any person who has been granted
 exemption pursuant to this section shall file the completed  application
 with  the  appropriate assessing authority every twenty-four months from
 the date such exemption was granted without the necessity of having been
 granted exemption pursuant to  this  section  on  five  (5)  consecutive
 completed  assessment  rolls  including any years when the exemption was
 granted to a property owned by [a husband and/or wife] A MARRIED  PERSON
 OR A MARRIED COUPLE while both SPOUSES resided in such property.
  §  6.  Subdivision 8-a of section 467 of the real property tax law, as
 amended by section 1 of part B of chapter 686 of the laws  of  2022,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  8-a.  Notwithstanding  any provision of law to the contrary, the local
 governing body of a municipal corporation that is authorized to adopt  a
 local  law  pursuant  to  subdivision  eight  of this section is further
 authorized to adopt a local law providing that where a renewal  applica-
 tion  for the exemption authorized by this section has not been filed on
 or before the taxable status date, and  the  owner  believes  that  good
 cause  existed  for  the failure to file the renewal application by that
 date, the owner may, no later than the last  day  for  paying  taxes  or
 PILOT without incurring interest or penalty, submit a written request to
 the assessor asking [him or her] THE ASSESSOR to extend the filing dead-
 line  and grant the exemption. Such request shall contain an explanation
 of why the deadline was missed, and shall be accompanied  by  a  renewal
 application,  reflecting  the facts and circumstances as they existed on
 the taxable status date. The assessor may extend the filing deadline and
 grant the exemption if [he or she] THE ASSESSOR is  satisfied  that  (i)
 good  cause  existed  for the failure to file the renewal application by
 the taxable status date, and that (ii) the applicant is otherwise  enti-
 tled  to the exemption. The assessor shall MAKE A DETERMINATION AND mail
 notice [of his or her determination] THEREOF to the owner. If the deter-
 mination states that the assessor has granted the exemption, [he or she]
 A. 3009--B  47
 
 THE ASSESSOR shall thereupon be authorized and directed to  correct  the
 assessment  roll  accordingly,  or,  if  another  person  has custody or
 control of the assessment roll, to direct that person to make the appro-
 priate  corrections.  If  the  correction  is  not made before taxes are
 levied, the failure to take the exemption into account in  the  computa-
 tion of the tax shall be deemed a "clerical error" for purposes of title
 three of article five of this chapter, and shall be corrected according-
 ly.

  1.  There  is hereby imposed and shall be paid a tax on all cigarettes
 possessed in the state by any person for sale, except that no tax  shall
 be  imposed  on cigarettes sold under such circumstances that this state
 is without power to impose such tax, including sales to qualified  Indi-
 ans for their own use and consumption on their nations' or tribes' qual-
 ified  reservation,  or  sold  to  the  United States or sold to or by a
 voluntary unincorporated organization of the armed forces of the  United
 States  operating  a place for the sale of goods pursuant to regulations
 promulgated by the appropriate executive agency of the United States, to
 the extent provided in such regulations and policy statements of such an
 agency applicable to such sales. The tax  imposed  by  this  section  is
 imposed  on  all cigarettes sold on an Indian reservation to non-members
 of the Indian nation or tribe and to non-Indians and  evidence  of  such
 tax  shall be by means of an affixed cigarette tax stamp. Indian nations
 or tribes may elect to participate in the Indian  tax  exemption  coupon
 system established in section four hundred seventy-one-e of this article
 which provides a mechanism for the collection of the tax imposed by this
 section on cigarette sales on qualified reservations to such non-members
 and  non-Indians  and for the delivery of quantities of tax-exempt ciga-
 rettes to Indian nations or tribes for the personal use and  consumption
 of  qualified members of the Indian nation or tribe. If an Indian nation
 or tribe does not elect to  participate  in  the  Indian  tax  exemption
 coupon  system, the prior approval system shall be the mechanism for the
 delivery of quantities of tax-exempt cigarettes  to  Indian  nations  or
 tribes  for the personal use and consumption of qualified members of the
 Indian nation or tribe as provided for in paragraph (b)  of  subdivision
 five  of  this  section.  Such tax on cigarettes shall be at the rate of
 [four] FIVE dollars and thirty-five cents for each twenty cigarettes  or
 fraction  thereof,  provided,  however,  that if a package of cigarettes
 contains more than twenty cigarettes, the rate of tax on the  cigarettes
 in  such  package  in  excess  of twenty shall be one dollar and [eight]
 THIRTY-THREE and three-quarters cents for each five cigarettes or  frac-
 tion  thereof.  Such tax is intended to be imposed upon only one sale of
 the same package of cigarettes. It shall be presumed that all cigarettes
 within the state are subject to tax until the contrary  is  established,
 and  the  burden  of proof that any cigarettes are not taxable hereunder
 shall be upon the person in possession thereof.
  § 2.  Section 471-a of the tax law, as amended by section 5 of part  D
 of chapter 134 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  §  471-a.  Use tax on cigarettes. There is hereby imposed and shall be
 paid a tax on all cigarettes used in the state  by  any  person,  except
 that  no  tax  shall  be imposed (1) if the tax provided in section four
 hundred seventy-one of this article is paid, (2) on  the  use  of  ciga-
 rettes  which are exempt from the tax imposed by said section, or (3) on
 the use of four hundred or less cigarettes, brought into the  state  on,
 or  in the possession of, any person. Such tax on cigarettes shall be at
 the rate of [four] FIVE dollars and thirty-five cents  for  each  twenty
 cigarettes  or fraction thereof, provided, however, that if a package of
 cigarettes contains more than twenty cigarettes, the rate of tax on  the
 cigarettes  in  such package in excess of twenty shall be one dollar and
 [eight] THIRTY-THREE and three-quarters cents for each  five  cigarettes
 or  fraction  thereof.  Within twenty-four hours after liability for the
 tax accrues, each such person shall file with the commissioner a  return
 A. 3009--B  52
 
 in  such  form  as the commissioner may prescribe together with a remit-
 tance of the tax shown to be due thereon. For purposes of this  article,
 the  word  "use"  means  the  exercise  of  any right or power actual or
 constructive  and shall include but is not limited to the receipt, stor-
 age or any keeping or retention for any length of time,  but  shall  not
 include possession for sale. All other provisions of this article if not
 inconsistent  shall  apply  to the administration and enforcement of the
 tax imposed by this section in the same manner as  if  the  language  of
 said provisions had been incorporated in full into this section.
  §  3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the
 tax due on cigarettes possessed in New York state as  of  the  close  of
 business  on August 31, 2023, by any person for sale solely attributable
 to the increase imposed by the amendments to section 471 of the tax law,
 as amended by section one of this act, shall be  paid  by  November  20,
 2023,  subject to such terms and conditions as the commissioner of taxa-
 tion and finance shall prescribe.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on September 1, 2023, and shall  apply
 to all cigarettes possessed in this state by any person for sale and all
 cigarettes used in this state by any person on or after such date.

  Section  1.  Legislative findings. The legislature finds that it is in
 the interests of the state to assist The New  York  Racing  Association,
 Inc.,  which  is  the  franchised  corporation  pursuant  to section two
 hundred six of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering  and  breeding  law,  to
 renovate  Belmont  Park  racetrack.  The legislature further finds and
 determines that the anticipated cost of renovating  Belmont  Park  race-
 track is four hundred fifty-five million dollars and that the renovation
 of  Belmont  Park  racetrack  shall  initially  be financed by the state
 subject to the provisions of the repayment agreement of  the  franchised
 corporation  required  by section two of this act. The franchised corpo-
 ration will be responsible for repayment of the state funds  in  accord-
 ance with the terms of such repayment agreement.
  §  2.  Prior  to,  and as a condition to the state initially providing
 funds for the renovation  of  Belmont  Park  racetrack,  the  franchised
 corporation  shall  enter  into  a  repayment  agreement  with the state
 authorizing and directing that a portion of the funds of the  franchised
 corporation  dedicated for capital expenditures of the franchised corpo-
 ration pursuant to paragraph 3 of  subdivision  f  and  paragraph  3  of
 subdivision  f-1  of  section 1612 of the tax law shall be used to repay
 the state for the funds provided by the  state  for  the  renovation  of
 Belmont  Park  racetrack,  in  accordance  with  the repayment agreement
 between the state and the franchised corporation. Such  agreement  shall
 further  provide  that  in the event the franchised corporation receives
 future statutory payments enacted for the specific  purpose  of  holding
 the franchised corporation harmless for any loss of payments pursuant to
 paragraph  3  of  subdivision  f  and  paragraph 3 of subdivision f-1 of
 section 1612 of the tax law, such statutory payments shall also be  used
 to  repay  the  state  for the funds provided by the state for the reno-
 vation of Belmont Park racetrack. Such agreement  may  also  be  amended
 from  time  to  time as agreed to by the state and the franchised corpo-
 ration.  At any time prior to the repayment of the state funds  for  the
 renovation of Belmont Park racetrack, the state may issue state personal
 income  tax revenue bonds or state sales tax revenue bonds. In the event
 of the issuance of such bonds, the repayment agreement shall be  revised
 to  reflect  the obligation of the franchised corporation to fully repay
 the debt service costs associated with such bonds.
  § 3. As a condition of the state initially  providing  funds  for  the
 renovation  of  Belmont  Park  racetrack,  the franchise oversight board
 shall include a requirement in any request for proposals for such  reno-
 vation  that  any  projects  in  connection with such work shall only be
 undertaken pursuant to a project  labor  agreement  in  accordance  with
 section 222 of the labor law. For the purposes of this section, "project
 labor  agreement"  shall  have the meaning set forth in subdivision 1 of
 section 213 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law.
  § 4. The New York State Gaming Commission shall  ensure  that  to  the
 extent  that  the law allows for a franchise agreement for the operation
 A. 3009--B  55
 
 of Belmont Park racetrack with a franchisee other  than  the  franchised
 corporation,  the  term  of  any  such franchise agreement awarded after
 funding provided by the state for the renovation of Belmont  Park  race-
 track  described  by  section  one of this act shall include a provision
 obligating such franchisee to assume  the  payments  of  the  franchised
 corporation required by section two of this act.
  §  5. The opening paragraph of paragraph 3 of subdivision f of section
 1612 of the tax law is designated subparagraph (i) and  a  new  subpara-
 graph (ii) is added to read as follows:

 follows:
  (a) Any  racing  association  or  corporation  or  regional  off-track
 betting  corporation,  authorized  to conduct pari-mutuel wagering under
 this chapter, desiring to display the simulcast of horse races on  which
 pari-mutuel  betting shall be permitted in the manner and subject to the
 conditions provided for in this article may apply to the commission  for
 a  license  so to do. Applications for licenses shall be in such form as
 may be prescribed by the commission and shall contain  such  information
 or  other material or evidence as the commission may require. No license
 A. 3009--B  58
 
 shall be issued by the commission authorizing the simulcast transmission
 of thoroughbred races from a track located in Suffolk  county.  The  fee
 for  such  licenses shall be five hundred dollars per simulcast facility

 residences,  homes or other areas to be conducted jointly by one or more
 regional off-track betting corporations and one or more of  the  follow-
 ing:  a  franchised  corporation,  thoroughbred  racing corporation or a
 harness racing corporation or association; provided (i) the simulcasting
 consists only of those races on which pari-mutuel betting is  authorized
 by  this  chapter  at  one  or more simulcast facilities for each of the
 contracting off-track betting corporations which  shall  include  wagers
 made  in  accordance  with  section  one  thousand fifteen, one thousand

 that  the  contract  provisions or other simulcast arrangements for such
 simulcast facility shall be no less favorable than those  in  effect  on
 January  first,  two  thousand  five;  (ii)  that each off-track betting
 corporation having within its  geographic  boundaries  such  residences,
 homes  or  other  areas  technically  capable of receiving the simulcast
 signal shall be a contracting party; (iii) the distribution of  revenues
 shall  be  subject  to  contractual agreement of the parties except that
 statutory payments to  non-contracting  parties,  if  any,  may  not  be
 reduced;  provided,  however,  that nothing herein to the contrary shall
 prevent a track from televising its races on an irregular basis primari-
 ly for promotional or marketing purposes as found by the commission. For
 purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of section one thousand thir-
 teen of this article shall  not  apply.  Any  agreement  authorizing  an
 in-home simulcasting experiment commencing prior to May fifteenth, nine-
 teen hundred ninety-five, may, and all its terms, be extended until June

 decreased  in  the  amount  of  fifty percent of the difference in total
 commissions determined by  comparing  the  total  commissions  available
 after  July  twenty-first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  to the total

 half  of one percent of total daily on-track pari-mutuel pools resulting

 provisions of this act. Any such regulations to implement  a  change  in
 withholding  tables  and  methods for tax year 2023 shall be adopted and
 effective as soon  as practicable and the commissioner of  taxation  and

  1. Subject to the provisions of chapter 59 of the laws  of  2000,  but
 notwithstanding the provisions of section 18 of section 1 of chapter 174
 of the laws of 1968, the New York state urban development corporation is
 hereby  authorized  to  issue  bonds,  notes and other obligations in an
 aggregate principal amount not to exceed [nine hundred sixty-two million
 seven hundred fifteen thousand dollars $962,715,000]  ONE BILLION  FOUR-
 TEEN  MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS $1,014,735,000,
 which authorization increases the aggregate principal amount  of  bonds,
 notes  and  other obligations authorized by section 40 of chapter 309 of
 the laws of 1996, and shall include all bonds,  notes  and  other  obli-
 gations  issued  pursuant to chapter 211 of the laws of 1990, as amended

 shall be paid to the state, for deposit in the youth facilities improve-
 ment fund OR THE CAPITAL PROJECTS FUND, to pay for all or any portion of
 the  amount or amounts paid by the state from appropriations or reappro-

 repayment  bonds,  notes  or  other  obligations  to be issued shall not
 exceed the present value of the aggregate debt  service  of  the  bonds,
 notes or other obligations so to be refunded or repaid. For the purposes
 hereof, the present value of the aggregate debt service of the refunding
 or repayment bonds, notes or other obligations and of the aggregate debt
 service  of the bonds, notes or other obligations so refunded or repaid,
 shall be calculated by utilizing the  effective  interest  rate  of  the
 refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other obligations, which shall be
 that  rate  arrived  at  by  doubling  the  semi-annual  interest  rate
 (compounded  semi-annually)  necessary  to  discount  the  debt  service
 payments on the refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other obligations
 from  the payment dates thereof to the date of issue of the refunding or
 repayment bonds, notes or other obligations and to the price bid includ-
 ing estimated accrued interest or proceeds received by  the  corporation

 purposes, the establishment of reserves to secure such bonds and  notes,
 the  cost  or  premium  of  bond insurance or the costs of any financial
 mechanisms which may be used to reduce the debt service  that  would  be
 payable  by the agency on its mental health services facilities improve-
 ment bonds and notes and all other expenditures of the  agency  incident
 to  and  necessary or convenient to providing the facilities development
 corporation, or any successor agency, with funds for  the  financing  or
 refinancing of or for any such design, construction, acquisition, recon-

 purposes hereof, the present values of the aggregate debt service of the
 refunding or repayment bonds, notes or  other  obligations  and  of  the
 aggregate  debt  service  of  the  bonds,  notes or other obligations so
 refunded or repaid, shall  be  calculated  by  utilizing  the  effective
 interest  rate of the refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other obli-
 gations, which shall be that rate arrived at by doubling the semi-annual
 interest rate (compounded semi-annually) necessary to discount the  debt
 service  payments  on  the  refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other
 obligations from the payment dates thereof to the date of issue  of  the
 refunding  or  repayment  bonds,  notes  or other obligations and to the

 thereof  shall not exceed five years from the date of the original issue

 issued  or  outstanding  for  such  purposes  shall  not be included for
 purposes of determining the amount of  bonds  issued  pursuant  to  this
 section. The director of the budget shall allocate the aggregate princi-
 pal  authorized  to  be  issued by the agency among the office of mental
 health, office for  people  with  developmental  disabilities,  and  the

 INSURANCE TRUST FUND" WILL, ABSENT PROVISION  FOR  LONG-TERM  FINANCING,
 RESULT  IN  THE IMPOSITION OF INCREASED COSTS ON EMPLOYERS THROUGH UNEM-
 PLOYMENT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS;  THAT  SUCH  INCREASED
 ASSESSMENTS  AND  CONTRIBUTIONS  MAY  HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON BUSI-
 NESSES IN NEW YORK STATE AND ON THEIR ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN EMPLOY-
 EES; THAT WITHOUT SUCH FINANCING EMPLOYERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE  REQUIRED
 TO  PAY  HIGHER  ASSESSMENTS  AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO PAY SUCH OBLIGATIONS;
 THAT THE BONDS WILL PROVIDE A MORE  EFFICIENT  MEANS  OF  COVERING  SUCH
 OBLIGATIONS  IN THE SHORT-TERM; THAT BONDS ISSUED BY THE AUTHORITY WOULD
 ALLOW THE STATE TO LIMIT THE ASSESSMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS NEEDED TO PAY
 SUCH OBLIGATIONS, THEREBY FURTHERING THE POLICY OF THE STATE TO  IMPROVE
 THE  BUSINESS  CLIMATE  IN THE STATE; THAT ALL COSTS OF THE AUTHORITY IN
 RELATION TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE PAID FROM CONTRIBUTIONS  PROVIDED  FOR
 IN  THE  LABOR  LAW; AND THAT, THEREFORE, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION
 ARE FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT AND GOOD AND THE AUTHORIZATION AS PROVIDED IN
 THIS SECTION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF REVENUE OBLIGATIONS OF THE AUTHORITY IS
 DECLARED TO BE FOR A PUBLIC PURPOSE AND THE  EXERCISE  OF  AN  ESSENTIAL

 INVESTMENT OF NET PROCEEDS OF THE BONDS AND OTHER AMOUNTS IN THE FINANC-
 ING AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN A TAX REGULATORY AGREEMENT AS NECESSARY OR
 DESIRABLE TO ASSURE THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM TAXATION.
  5. (A) (I) THE AUTHORITY SHALL HAVE THE POWER AND IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED

  (II) EACH ISSUANCE OF BONDS SHALL BE AUTHORIZED BY A RESOLUTION OF THE
 AUTHORITY,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, THAT ANY SUCH RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE
 ISSUANCE OF BONDS MAY DELEGATE TO AN OFFICER OF THE AUTHORITY THE  POWER
 TO ISSUE SUCH BONDS FROM TIME TO TIME AND TO FIX THE DETAILS OF ANY SUCH
 ISSUES  OF  BONDS BY AN APPROPRIATE CERTIFICATE OF SUCH AUTHORIZED OFFI-
 CER.  EVERY ISSUE OF THE BONDS OF THE  AUTHORITY  FOR  THE  UNEMPLOYMENT
 INSURANCE  TRUST  FUND SHALL BE SPECIAL REVENUE OBLIGATIONS PAYABLE FROM

 MAY  BE  DETERMINED  BY  THE AUTHORITY AND MAY BE MADE REDEEMABLE BEFORE
 MATURITY, AT THE OPTION OF THE AUTHORITY, AT SUCH PRICE  OR  PRICES  AND

 PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF SUCH BONDS MAY BE MADE PAYABLE IN  ANY  LAWFUL
 MEDIUM.  THE  RESOLUTION  OR  THE  CERTIFICATE OF THE AUTHORIZED OFFICER
 SHALL DETERMINE THE FORM OF THE BONDS, EITHER REGISTERED  OR  BOOK-ENTRY
 FORM, AND THE MANNER OF EXECUTION OF THE BONDS AND SHALL FIX THE DENOMI-
 NATION  OR DENOMINATIONS OF THE BONDS AND THE PLACE OR PLACES OF PAYMENT
 OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST THEREOF, WHICH MAY BE AT  ANY  BANK  OR  TRUST
 COMPANY WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE STATE. IF ANY OFFICER WHOSE SIGNATURE OR A
 FACSIMILE  THEREOF  APPEARS  ON ANY BONDS SHALL CEASE TO BE SUCH OFFICER

 UNDER  SUCH  RESTRICTIONS  AS THE FINANCING AGREEMENT AND THE RESOLUTION
 AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH BONDS OR THE  RELATED  TRUST  INDENTURE

 AND WITHOUT ANY OTHER APPROVALS, FILINGS, PROCEEDINGS OR  THE  HAPPENING
 OF  ANY  OTHER  CONDITIONS OR THINGS OTHER THAN THE APPROVALS, FINDINGS,
 PROCEEDINGS, CONDITIONS, AND THINGS THAT ARE SPECIFIED AND  REQUIRED  BY
 THIS  SECTION.  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, THAT ANY ISSUANCE OF BONDS UNDER THE
 AUTHORITY OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSIDERED A PROJECT FOR THE PURPOSES
 OF SECTION FIFTY-ONE OF THIS CHAPTER, AND SUBJECT TO APPROVAL UNDER SUCH
 SECTION.
  (D) ANY PLEDGE MADE BY THE AUTHORITY SHALL BE VALID AND BINDING AT THE
 TIME THE PLEDGE IS MADE. THE ASSETS,  PROPERTY,  REVENUES,  RESERVES  OR
 EARNINGS  SO  PLEDGED  SHALL  IMMEDIATELY BE SUBJECT TO THE LIEN OF SUCH
 PLEDGE WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL DELIVERY THEREOF OR FURTHER ACT AND THE LIEN
 OF ANY SUCH PLEDGE SHALL BE VALID AND BINDING  AS  AGAINST  ALL  PARTIES
 HAVING CLAIMS OF ANY KIND AGAINST THE AUTHORITY, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER
 SUCH PARTIES HAVE NOTICE THEREOF. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF
 LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY, NEITHER THE BOND RESOLUTION NOR ANY INDENTURE OR
 OTHER INSTRUMENT, INCLUDING THE FINANCING AGREEMENT, BY WHICH  A  PLEDGE
 IS CREATED OR BY WHICH THE AUTHORITY'S INTEREST IN PLEDGED ASSETS, PROP-
 ERTY,  REVENUES, RESERVES OR EARNINGS THEREON IS ASSIGNED NEED BE FILED,

 TY.
  (E) WHETHER OR NOT THE BONDS OF THE AUTHORITY ARE  OF  SUCH  FORM  AND
 CHARACTER AS TO BE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE UNIFORM

 ALL PURPOSES, SUBJECT ONLY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BONDS FOR  REGISTRA-
 TION.

 AND BETWEEN THE AUTHORITY AND THE TRUST INDENTURE TRUSTEE, WHICH MAY  BE
 ANY  TRUST COMPANY OR BANK HAVING THE POWERS OF A TRUST COMPANY, WHETHER
 LOCATED WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE STATE,  PROVIDED  IT  IS  CARRIED  OUT  IN
 ACCORDANCE  WITH  SECTION  SIXTY-NINE-D  OF  THE STATE FINANCE LAW. SUCH

 MAY  PROVIDE  FOR  THE  CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF SUCH RESERVES AS THE
 AUTHORITY SHALL DETERMINE TO BE PROPER AND MAY INCLUDE COVENANTS SETTING
 FORTH THE DUTIES OF THE AUTHORITY IN RELATION TO THE BONDS,  THE  INCOME
 OF  THE  AUTHORITY,  OR THE FINANCING AGREEMENT. SUCH TRUST INDENTURE OR
 RESOLUTION MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS: (I)  RESPECTING  THE  CUSTODY,  SAFE-
 GUARDING  AND  APPLICATION OF ALL MONEYS AND SECURITIES; (II) PROTECTING
 AND ENFORCING THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES (PURSUANT TO THE  TRUST  INDENTURE

 GATIONS RECEIVED ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHORITY TO FURNISH SUCH INDEMNIFYING
 BONDS OR TO PLEDGE SUCH SECURITIES AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE  AUTHORITY.
 ANY SUCH TRUST INDENTURE OR RESOLUTION MAY CONTAIN SUCH OTHER PROVISIONS
 AS  THE  AUTHORITY  MAY  DEEM  REASONABLE  AND PROPER FOR PRIORITIES AND
 SUBORDINATION AMONG THE OWNERS OF THE  BONDS  AND  OTHER  BENEFICIARIES.
 FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION,  A "RESOLUTION" OF THE AUTHORITY SHALL

 AND  CREDIT  OF  THE  STATE OR OF THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE, AND THE
 STATE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS  THEREON  NOR  SHALL  ANY
 BOND  OR  ANY  ANCILLARY  BOND  FACILITY  BE PAYABLE OUT OF ANY FUNDS OR

 REDEMPTION,  OR  IN THE EVENT THAT THE AUTHORITY OR THE STATE SHALL FAIL
 TO COMPLY WITH ANY AGREEMENT MADE WITH  THE  HOLDERS  OF  ANY  ISSUE  OF
 BONDS,  THE HOLDERS OF TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT
 OF THE BONDS OF SUCH ISSUE THEN OUTSTANDING, BY  INSTRUMENT  OR  INSTRU-

 APPOINT  A  TRUSTEE  TO  REPRESENT  THE  HOLDERS  OF  SUCH BONDS FOR THE
 PURPOSES HEREIN PROVIDED.

 CONTRACT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT SUCH CONTRACT MAY BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION. MONIES HELD IN TRUST OR  OTHERWISE  FOR  THE
 PAYMENT  OF  BONDS  OR  IN  ANY WAY TO SECURE BONDS AND DEPOSITS OF SUCH
 MONEYS MAY BE SECURED IN THE SAME MANNER AS MONIES OF THE AUTHORITY  AND
 ALL  BANKS  AND TRUST COMPANIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO GIVE SUCH SECURITY FOR
 SUCH DEPOSITS. ANY MONIES OF THE AUTHORITY NOT  REQUIRED  FOR  IMMEDIATE
 USE OR DISBURSEMENT MAY, AT THE DISCRETION OF THE AUTHORITY, BE INVESTED
 IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  LAW  AND  SUCH  GUIDELINES  AS ARE APPROVED BY THE
 AUTHORITY.

  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  PART NN
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "Suffolk county water quality restoration act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  The  county of Suffolk ("county"), with a
 population of one million five hundred thousand persons, has  in  excess
 of  three  hundred  eighty  thousand existing onsite wastewater disposal
 systems, comprised mostly of cesspools  and  septic  systems,  with  two
 hundred  nine thousand of these onsite systems in environmentally sensi-
 tive areas which could benefit from nitrogen-reducing technologies.  The
 United  States Environmental Protection Agency recognizes Long Island as
 having a sole source aquifer  system  for  its  drinking  water  supply.
 Suffolk  county  has  an  imminent  need to preserve this valuable water
 resource by reducing the amount of nitrogen discharged into the  ground-
 water  by onsite systems. The full water cycle is impacted by increasing
 quantities of nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, volatile organic contam-
 inants and saltwater intrusion, as well as a number of emerging  threats
 such as prescription drugs and sea level rise.
  The Suffolk county subwatersheds wastewater plan ("SWP"), certified by
 the  department  of  environmental  conservation  as  a  Nine  Elements
 Watershed (9E) plan, has documented  the  devastating  effects  of  high
 levels  of  nitrogen  pollution, not only on the drinking water quality,
 but  also  on  coastal  ecosystems,  dissolved  oxygen,  water  clarity,
 eelgrass,  wetlands,  shellfish,  coastal  resilience  and in triggering
 harmful algal blooms. The SWP, is a long-term plan to address  the  need
 for wastewater treatment infrastructure throughout the county comprehen-
 sively  over  a period of fifty years. The SWP delineates the source and
 concentration of nitrogen loading  in  one  hundred  ninety-one  subwat-
 ersheds  throughout the county, and establishes nitrogen reduction goals
 for each watershed.
  For many areas of the county, installing or connecting sewers is not a
 practical or cost-effective method  of  treating  wastewater.  For  that
 reason,  the  SWP  prescribes  a hybrid approach that relies on sewering
 where feasible, and the replacement of cesspools and septic systems with
 innovative/alternative onsite wastewater treatment systems. The  consol-
 idation  of  any  or  all of the twenty-seven county sewer districts, as
 well as unsewered areas of the county, into a county wastewater  manage-
 ment  district,  the  establishment of a water quality restoration fund,
 and a county board of trustees to monitor progress and the allocation of
 resources consistent with the goals of  the  SWP  would  allow  for  the
 implementation of a much needed integrated long-term wastewater solution
 for  the county through comprehensive planning and management to improve
 water quality.
 A. 3009--B  126
 
  The purpose of this act is to create a water quality restoration  fund
 to  finance capital projects for the protection, preservation, and reha-
 bilitation of groundwater and surface waters as recommended by the  SWP.
 This  act would allow the funding of capital projects that will mitigate
 wastewater pollutants utilizing the best available technology consistent
 with the SWP.  The water quality restoration fund would be financed with
 a  dedicated  and  recurring revenue source by the enactment of an addi-
 tional sales and compensating use tax at the rate of one-eighth  of  one
 percent  until 2060.  Such tax would be enacted pursuant to a mandatory
 referendum.
  This act shall also provide  Suffolk  county  with  the  authority  to
 create a county wastewater management district through the consolidation
 of existing county sewer districts with currently unsewered areas of the
 county.  A  county  wastewater management district will provide an inte-
 grated and efficient approach to managing wastewater services across the
 county; allow the county to enhance and expand its incentive program  to
 property  owners  to  upgrade  their  wastewater  treatment  systems; to
 manage, monitor and enforce nitrogen reduction programs  throughout  the
 county;  complete  additional  sewer  extension  projects;  improve  the
 economic wellbeing of communities; and provide an opportunity to consol-
 idate and streamline the county's existing  sewer  district  system  and
 normalize the inequitable rate structure that has long existed.
  In  addition,  this  act  will  extend the existing one-quarter of one
 percent  sales  tax  utilized  to  finance  the  county  drinking  water
 protection program until 2060.
  §  3.  The county law is amended by adding a new section 256-b to read

  §  4.  Subdivisions (a) and (d) of section 1210-A of the tax law, as
 amended by chapter 683 of the laws of  2007,  are  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (a)  In addition to the taxes imposed by section twelve hundred ten or
 any other provision of this article, the county  of  Suffolk  is  hereby
 authorized  and  empowered  to adopt and amend a local law, ordinance or
 resolution imposing within the territorial  limits  of  said  county  an
 additional  sales and compensating use tax at the rate of one-quarter of
 one percent for the period beginning December  first,  nineteen  hundred
 eighty-four  and ending November thirtieth, two thousand [thirty] SIXTY,
 which tax shall be identical to the tax imposed by said county  pursuant
 to  section  twelve  hundred  ten of this article. Except as hereinafter
 provided, all provisions of this article, including the  definition  and
 exemption  provisions and the provisions relating to the administration,
 collection  and  distribution  by  the  commissioner,  shall  apply  for
 purposes  of the tax imposed by this section in the same manner and with
 the same force and effect as if the language of this  article  had  been
 A. 3009--B  132
 
 incorporated  in  full in this section and had expressly referred to the
 tax imposed by this  section;  provided,  however,  that  any  provision
 relating  to a maximum rate shall be calculated without reference to the
 additional  sales  and  compensating  use  tax  herein  authorized.  For
 purposes of part IV of this article,  relating  to  the  disposition  of
 revenues  resulting from taxes collected and administered by the commis-
 sioner, the additional sales and compensating use  tax  herein  provided
 shall  be  deemed  to  be  imposed under the authority of section twelve
 hundred ten of this article and all provisions relating to the  deposit,
 administration and disposition of taxes, penalties and interest relating
 to  a  tax  imposed  by  a  county under the authority of section twelve
 hundred ten of this article  shall,  except  as  otherwise  specifically
 provided in this section, apply to the additional sales and compensating
 use tax imposed pursuant to this section.
  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contra-
 ry, the net collections from the tax imposed pursuant to subdivision (a)
 of  this  section  for  the  period  beginning  December first, nineteen
 hundred eighty-eight and ending November thirtieth, two thousand  [thir-
 ty]  SIXTY shall, upon payment to the county of Suffolk, be deposited in
 a special fund, to be designated as a drinking water protection  reserve
 fund,  to be created by said county therefor separate and apart from any
 other funds and accounts of the county. Moneys in  such  fund  shall  be
 deposited  in one or more of the banks or trust companies designated, in
 the manner provided by law, as a depository of the funds of such county.
 Pending expenditure from such fund, moneys therein may  be  invested  in
 the  manner provided in section eleven of the general municipal law. Any
 interest earned or capital gain realized on the moneys so  deposited  or
 invested  shall  accrue  to and become part of such fund. Moneys in said
 fund may be appropriated from and transferred  to  or  expended  in  any
 fiscal  year only for the purposes of making payments pursuant to subdi-
 visions (b) and (c) of this section for the  period  beginning  December
 first,  nineteen hundred eighty-eight, to the extent that moneys in said
 fund are remaining, and if authorized by local law,  for  the  following
 purposes:
  (i) for the purposes of specific environmental protection (acquisition
 of:  farmland  development rights; open space, wetlands, woodlands, pine
 barrens and other lands for passive recreational uses; lands for  hamlet
 greens,  hamlet  parks, pocket parks, historic parks, cultural parks and
 other lands for active/parkland recreational uses; lands  necessary  for
 maintaining and protecting the quality of surface water, groundwater and
 coastal resources);
  (ii)  for  a  water  quality  protection  and  restoration  program or
 programs and land stewardship initiatives;
  (iii) for the purposes of county-wide property tax protection; and
  (iv) for the purpose of sewer taxpayer protection.
  Notwithstanding any  special  or  local  law,  resolution  or  charter
 provision  to  the  contrary,  moneys  in  said fund which have not been
 appropriated from and transferred to or expended in any fiscal year  for
 the  purposes of making payments pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of
 this section, may alternatively be  appropriated  for  the  purposes  of
 paying debt service on any new indebtedness incurred after the effective
 date  of  the  chapter of the laws of two thousand one that enacted this
 paragraph pursuant to the local finance law in order to  effectuate  the
 purposes described in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this subdivision. For the
 purpose  of  allocating  moneys in said fund pursuant to local law among
 the purposes described in paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)  of  this
 A. 3009--B  133
 
 subdivision,  moneys  applied  to  the payment of debt service under the
 authority of the previous sentence shall be considered by said county to
 have been expended for the purposes  for  which  such  indebtedness  was
 incurred.
