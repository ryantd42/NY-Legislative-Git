 y-six of this chapter, AND (II) ANY SUCH TAXPAYER THAT  IS  AN  ELIGIBLE

 as an owner of a new business for purposes  of  paragraph  ten  of  this
 subsection may, at [his] THE TAXPAYER'S option, receive such excess as a
 refund,  AND  (B)  A  TAXPAYER  THAT IS AN ELIGIBLE FARMER AS DEFINED IN

 BLE  YEARS  BEGINNING  BEFORE  JANUARY  FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-EIGHT

 graph  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  refund  of an overpayment of tax as
 provided in section six hundred eighty-six of  this  article,  provided,

  (1) THE GOVERNING BODY OF A  MUNICIPAL  CORPORATION,  AFTER  A  PUBLIC
 HEARING,  MAY  ADOPT A LOCAL LAW, ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION PROVIDING THAT
 ANY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN  THE  APPLICANT'S
 FEDERAL ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED INCOME;
  (2)  DISTRIBUTIONS  RECEIVED  FROM AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT OR
 INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITY THAT  WERE  INCLUDED  IN  THE  APPLICANT'S
 FEDERAL  ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED INCOME UNLESS THE
 GOVERNING BODY OF A  MUNICIPAL  CORPORATION,  AFTER  A  PUBLIC  HEARING,

 PRESCRIPTION DRUG EXPENSES ACTUALLY PAID THAT  WERE  NOT  REIMBURSED  OR
 PAID  FOR  BY  INSURANCE,  IF  THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A MUNICIPAL CORPO-
 RATION, AFTER A PUBLIC HEARING, ADOPTS A LOCAL LAW, ORDINANCE OR  RESOL-
 UTION PROVIDING THEREFOR;
  (4)  ANY  TAX-EXEMPT INTEREST OR DIVIDENDS THAT WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE
 APPLICANT'S FEDERAL ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME SHALL  BE  CONSIDERED  INCOME;
 AND
  (5)  ANY  LOSSES  THAT  WERE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE APPLICANT'S FEDERAL
 ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LIMITATIONS:
  (A) THE NET AMOUNT OF LOSS REPORTED ON FEDERAL SCHEDULE C, D, E, OR  F

 for [his] THE OWNER'S previous residence or  unless  the  title  of  the
 property shall have been vested in the owner or one of the owners of the
 property  for  at  least  twelve consecutive months prior to the date of
 making application for exemption, provided, however, that in  the  event
 of  the  death  of  [either a husband or wife] A MARRIED PERSON in whose
 name title of the property shall have been vested at the time  of  death
 and then becomes vested solely in [the survivor] SUCH PERSON'S SURVIVING
 SPOUSE  by  virtue of devise by or descent from the deceased [husband or
 wife] SPOUSE, the time of ownership of  the  property  by  the  deceased
 [husband or wife] SPOUSE shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the
 [survivor]  SURVIVING  SPOUSE and such ownership shall be deemed contin-
 uous for the purposes of computing such  period  of  twelve  consecutive
 months.  In  the event of a transfer by [either a husband or wife to the
 other] A MARRIED PERSON TO SUCH PERSON'S spouse of all or  part  of  the
 title  to  the  property,  the  time of ownership of the property by the
 transferor spouse shall be deemed also a time of ownership by the trans-
 feree spouse and such ownership  shall  be  deemed  continuous  for  the
 purposes  of  computing  such period of twelve consecutive months. Where
 property of the owner or owners has been acquired  to  replace  property
 formerly  owned  by  such owner or owners and taken by eminent domain or
 S. 4009--C  38  A. 3009--C
 
 other involuntary proceeding, except a tax sale, the period of ownership
 of the former property shall be combined with the period of ownership of
 the property for which application is made for exemption and such  peri-
 ods  of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for purposes of this
 section. Where a residence is sold and replaced with another within  one
 year  and  both residences are within the state, the period of ownership
 of both properties shall be  deemed  consecutive  for  purposes  of  the
 exemption from taxation by a municipality within the state granting such
 exemption. Where the owner or owners transfer title to property which as
 of  the  date  of  transfer  was exempt from taxation or PILOT under the
 provisions of this section, the reacquisition of title by such owner  or
 owners  within  nine  months  of the date of transfer shall be deemed to
 satisfy the requirement of this paragraph that the title of the property
 shall have been vested in the owner or one of the owners for such period
 of twelve consecutive months. Where, upon or subsequent to the death  of
 an owner or owners, title to property which as of the date of such death
 was exempt from taxation or PILOT under such provisions, becomes vested,
 by  virtue of devise or descent from the deceased owner or owners, or by
 transfer by any other means within nine months after such death,  solely
 in  a  person or persons who, at the time of such death, maintained such
 property as a primary residence, the requirement of this paragraph  that
 the  title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or one of
 the owners for such period of twelve consecutive months shall be  deemed
 satisfied;
  (c)  unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes,
 provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is not
 so used exclusively for residential  purposes  but  is  used  for  other
 purposes,  such  portion  shall  be subject to taxation or PILOT and the
 remaining portion only shall be entitled to the  exemption  provided  by
 this section;
  (d) unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied
 in  whole or in part by the owner or by all of the owners of the proper-
 ty: except where, (i) an  owner  is  absent  from  the  residence  while
 receiving  health-related  care  as an inpatient of a residential health
 care facility, as defined in section twenty-eight  hundred  one  of  the
 public  health  law,  provided  that  any income accruing to that person
 shall only be income only to the extent that it exceeds the amount  paid
 by  such  owner,  spouse,  or  co-owner  for  care  in the facility, and
 provided further, that during such  confinement  such  property  is  not
 occupied  by  other  than the spouse or co-owner of such owner; or, (ii)
 the real property is owned by a [husband and/or wife, or  an  ex-husband
 and/or an ex-wife, and either] MARRIED PERSON OR A MARRIED COUPLE, OR BY
 A  FORMERLY  MARRIED PERSON OR A FORMERLY MARRIED COUPLE, AND ONE SPOUSE
 OR EX-SPOUSE is absent from the residence due to  divorce,  legal  sepa-
 ration  or  abandonment and all other provisions of this section are met
 provided that where  an  exemption  was  previously  granted  when  both
 resided  on the property, then the person remaining on the real property
 shall be sixty-two years of age or over.

 er.

 the appropriate taxable status date. Notwithstanding any other provision
 of law, at the option of the municipal corporation, any person otherwise
 qualifying  under  this  section shall not be denied the exemption under
 this section if [he] SUCH PERSON becomes sixty-five years of  age  after
 the  appropriate  taxable  status date and on or before December thirty-
 first of the same year.

 authorized to adopt a local law providing that where a renewal  applica-
 tion  for the exemption authorized by this section has not been filed on

 date, the owner may, no later than the last  day  for  paying  taxes  or
 PILOT without incurring interest or penalty, submit a written request to
 the assessor asking [him or her] THE ASSESSOR to extend the filing dead-

 good  cause  existed  for the failure to file the renewal application by
 the taxable status date, and that (ii) the applicant is otherwise  enti-
 tled  to the exemption. The assessor shall MAKE A DETERMINATION AND mail
 notice [of his or her determination] THEREOF to the owner. If the deter-
 mination states that the assessor has granted the exemption, [he or she]
 THE ASSESSOR shall thereupon be authorized and directed to  correct  the
 assessment  roll  accordingly,  or,  if  another  person  has custody or
 control of the assessment roll, to direct that person to make the appro-
 priate corrections. If the correction  is  not  made  before  taxes  are
 levied,  the  failure to take the exemption into account in the computa-
 tion of the tax shall be deemed a "clerical error" for purposes of title

  PART S
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 471 of the tax law, as amended  by
 section  1  of  part D of chapter 134 of the laws of 2010, is amended to
 read as follows:
  1. There is hereby imposed and shall be paid a tax on  all  cigarettes
 possessed  in the state by any person for sale, except that no tax shall
 be imposed on cigarettes sold under such circumstances that  this  state
 is  without power to impose such tax, including sales to qualified Indi-
 ans for their own use and consumption on their nations' or tribes' qual-
 ified reservation, or sold to the United States  or  sold  to  or  by  a
 voluntary  unincorporated organization of the armed forces of the United
 States operating a place for the sale of goods pursuant  to  regulations
 promulgated by the appropriate executive agency of the United States, to
 the extent provided in such regulations and policy statements of such an
 agency  applicable  to  such  sales.  The tax imposed by this section is
 imposed on all cigarettes sold on an Indian reservation  to  non-members
 of  the  Indian  nation or tribe and to non-Indians and evidence of such
 tax shall be by means of an affixed cigarette tax stamp. Indian  nations
 or  tribes  may  elect to participate in the Indian tax exemption coupon
 system established in section four hundred seventy-one-e of this article
 which provides a mechanism for the collection of the tax imposed by this
 section on cigarette sales on qualified reservations to such non-members
 and non-Indians and for the delivery of quantities of  tax-exempt  ciga-
 rettes  to Indian nations or tribes for the personal use and consumption
 of qualified members of the Indian nation or tribe. If an Indian  nation
 or  tribe  does  not  elect  to  participate in the Indian tax exemption
 coupon system, the prior approval system shall be the mechanism for  the
 delivery  of  quantities  of  tax-exempt cigarettes to Indian nations or
 tribes for the personal use and consumption of qualified members of  the
 Indian  nation  or tribe as provided for in paragraph (b) of subdivision
 five of this section. Such tax on cigarettes shall be  at  the  rate  of
 [four]  FIVE dollars and thirty-five cents for each twenty cigarettes or
 fraction thereof, provided, however, that if  a  package  of  cigarettes
 S. 4009--C  48  A. 3009--C
 
 contains  more than twenty cigarettes, the rate of tax on the cigarettes
 in such package in excess of twenty shall  be  one  dollar  and  [eight]
 THIRTY-THREE  and three-quarters cents for each five cigarettes or frac-
 tion  thereof.  Such tax is intended to be imposed upon only one sale of
 the same package of cigarettes. It shall be presumed that all cigarettes
 within the state are subject to tax until the contrary  is  established,
 and  the  burden  of proof that any cigarettes are not taxable hereunder
 shall be upon the person in possession thereof.
  § 2.  Section 471-a of the tax law, as amended by section 5 of part  D
 of chapter 134 of the laws of 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  §  471-a.  Use tax on cigarettes. There is hereby imposed and shall be
 paid a tax on all cigarettes used in the state  by  any  person,  except
 that  no  tax  shall  be imposed (1) if the tax provided in section four
 hundred seventy-one of this article is paid, (2) on  the  use  of  ciga-
 rettes  which are exempt from the tax imposed by said section, or (3) on
 the use of four hundred or less cigarettes, brought into the  state  on,
 or  in the possession of, any person. Such tax on cigarettes shall be at
 the rate of [four] FIVE dollars and thirty-five cents  for  each  twenty
 cigarettes  or fraction thereof, provided, however, that if a package of
 cigarettes contains more than twenty cigarettes, the rate of tax on  the
 cigarettes  in  such package in excess of twenty shall be one dollar and
 [eight] THIRTY-THREE and three-quarters cents for each  five  cigarettes
 or  fraction  thereof.  Within twenty-four hours after liability for the
 tax accrues, each such person shall file with the commissioner a  return
 in  such  form  as the commissioner may prescribe together with a remit-
 tance of the tax shown to be due thereon. For purposes of this  article,
 the  word  "use"  means  the  exercise  of  any right or power actual or
 constructive and shall include but is not limited to the receipt,  stor-
 age  or  any  keeping or retention for any length of time, but shall not
 include possession for sale. All other provisions of this article if not
 inconsistent shall apply to the administration and  enforcement  of  the
 tax  imposed  by  this  section in the same manner as if the language of
 said provisions had been incorporated in full into this section.
  § 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary,  the
 tax  due  on  cigarettes  possessed in New York state as of the close of
 business on August 31, 2023, by any person for sale solely  attributable
 to the increase imposed by the amendments to section 471 of the tax law,
 as  amended  by  section  one of this act, shall be paid by November 20,
 2023, subject to such terms and conditions as the commissioner of  taxa-
 tion and finance shall prescribe.
  §  4. This act shall take effect on September 1, 2023, and shall apply
 to all cigarettes possessed in this state by any person for sale and all
 cigarettes used in this state by any person on or after such date.

 wholesale dealer, and at the time of delivering tobacco products to  any
 person  each  distributor or wholesale dealer of tobacco products, shall

 of packages and number of cigarettes contained therein, in each shipment
 of  cigarettes delivered, and the items and quantity and wholesale price
 of each item in each shipment of tobacco  products  delivered,  and  the
 name  of  the  purchaser  to whom delivery is made, and shall retain the

 eof, and the name of the shipper, and shall retain the same for a period

 taxation and finance]. The commissioner [of  taxation  and  finance]  by
 regulation  may provide that whenever cigarettes or tobacco products are
 shipped into the state, the railroad company, express company,  trucking
 company  or other public carrier transporting any shipment thereof shall
 file with the commissioner [of taxation  and  finance]  a  copy  of  the
 freight  bill  within  ten  days after the delivery in the state of each
 shipment. All dealers shall maintain and keep  for  a  period  of  three
 years  such  other  records  of cigarettes or tobacco products received,
 sold or delivered within the state as may be required by the commission-
 er [of taxation and finance]. The commissioner [of taxation and finance]
 is hereby authorized to examine the books, papers,  invoices  and  other
 records  of  any person in possession, control or occupancy of any prem-
 ises where cigarettes or tobacco products are placed,  stored,  sold  or
 offered for sale, and the equipment of any such person pertaining to the
 stamping of cigarettes or the sale and delivery of cigarettes or tobacco
 products  taxable under this article, as well as the stock of cigarettes
 or tobacco products in any such premises or vehicle. To verify the accu-
 racy of the tax imposed and assessed by this article, each  such  person
 is hereby directed and required to give to the commissioner [of taxation
 and  finance]  or his OR HER duly authorized representatives, the means,
 facilities and opportunity for such examinations as are herein  provided
 for and required.

  PART X
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that it  is  in
 the  interests  of  the state to assist The New York Racing Association,
 Inc., which is  the  franchised  corporation  pursuant  to  section  two
 hundred  six  of  the  racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, to
 renovate Belmont Park racetrack and  repurpose  the  Aqueduct  property.
 The  legislature  further finds and determines that the anticipated cost
 of renovating Belmont Park racetrack is four hundred fifty-five  million
 dollars and that the renovation of Belmont Park racetrack shall initial-
 ly  be  financed by the state subject to the provisions of the repayment
 agreement of the franchised corporation required by section two of  this
 act. The franchised corporation will be responsible for repayment of the
 state funds in accordance with the terms of such repayment agreement.
  §  2.  Prior  to,  and as a condition to the state initially providing
 funds for the renovation  of  Belmont  Park  racetrack,  the  franchised
 corporation shall enter into a repayment agreement with the state acting
 through  the budget director authorizing and directing that a portion of
 the funds of the franchised corporation dedicated for  capital  expendi-
 tures  of the franchised corporation pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivi-
 sion f and paragraph 3 of subdivision f-1 of section 1612 of the tax law
 shall be used to repay the state for the funds provided by the state for
 the renovation of Belmont Park racetrack, in accordance with the  repay-
 ment agreement between the state and the franchised corporation. For the
 purposes  of this act, the terms "renovate", "renovation", and "renovat-
 ing" are limited to any and all construction funded by  and  subject  to
 the  repayment  agreement  required  by subparagraph (ii) of the opening
 paragraph of paragraph 3 of subdivision f of section  1612  of  the  tax
 law. Such agreement shall further provide that:
  (1)  in the event the franchised corporation receives future statutory
 payments enacted for the specific  purpose  of  holding  the  franchised
 corporation harmless for any loss of payments pursuant to paragraph 3 of
 subdivision  f and paragraph 3 of subdivision f-1 of section 1612 of the
 tax law, such statutory payments shall also be used to repay  the  state
 for  the  funds provided by the state for the renovation of Belmont Park
 racetrack;
  (2) the franchised corporation shall provide to  the  franchise  over-
 sight  board,  as  an  exhibit  to  the  agreement,  descriptions of the
 construction work to be paid for with the loan provided by the state  to
 the  franchised  corporation, which may include but shall not be limited
 to renderings, reports, and construction goals; provided  however,  that
 the  franchise  oversight board shall make such exhibit available on its
 website at least thirty days prior to execution of such  agreement;  and
 provided  further, that the franchise oversight board shall receive such
 exhibit at least sixty days prior to execution of such agreement;
 S. 4009--C  54  A. 3009--C

  (3) the franchise oversight board shall include a requirement  in  any
 request  for  proposals  for  such  renovation  that  any  projects  in
 connection with such work shall only be undertaken pursuant to a project
 labor agreement in accordance with section 222 of the labor law. For the
 purposes of this section, "project labor agreement" shall have the mean-
 ing set forth in subdivision 1 of section 213 of the racing, pari-mutuel
 wagering and breeding law;
  (4) for purposes of article 15-A of the executive law and article 3 of
 the  veterans'  services  law, the franchised corporation and any person
 entering into a contract for any project authorized pursuant to this act
 shall be deemed a state agency as such term is defined in such  articles
 and such contracts shall be deemed state contracts within the meaning of
 such  term as set forth in such articles. Additionally it must be demon-
 strated that:
  (i) the franchised corporation and its contractors and  subcontractors
 have  made  significant  efforts  to attract and retain minority, women,
 local, and  veteran apprentices; and (ii) the franchised corporation and
 its contractors and subcontractors have committed to work with  minority
 and  women  owned  business  enterprises pursuant to article 15-A of the
 executive law through joint ventures or subcontractor relationships;
  (5) the franchised  corporation  shall  establish  affirmative  action
 goals  to  provide  equal  employment  opportunities  to  all employees,
 including minorities,  women  and  persons  with  disabilities,  at  the
 Belmont Park racetrack;
  (6)  the  franchise  oversight  board  shall consult with the New York
 state energy research and development authority to determine what energy
 efficiencies may  be  realized  with  the  Belmont  project,  which  may
 include,  but  not  be  limited to, the number of zero emissions vehicle
 charging facilities, use of  geothermal  networks,  mini-split  systems,
 solar  photovoltaic  technologies,  energy  storage, and other renewable
 energy opportunities that the authority finds sufficient;
  (7) the franchise oversight board shall ensure that, subsequent to the
 franchised corporation relinquishing to the state its leasehold interest
 in real property located in South Ozone Park, commonly known as Aqueduct
 Racetrack, the franchised corporation shall, in  good  faith,  take  all
 commercially  reasonable  steps to ensure that, upon closure of Aqueduct
 Racetrack, any individual who was employed by the franchised corporation
 and held a full time equivalent job at  Aqueduct  Racetrack  or  Belmont
 Park  racetrack during the year two thousand twenty-three and has a full
 time equivalent job at the time the  franchised  corporation  terminates
 all  races  at  Aqueduct  and  moves all operations to Belmont, shall be
 offered an opportunity to continue to work at the Belmont Park racetrack
 in a comparable position with access to the same or  greater  number  of
 work hours and at the same or greater rate of pay; and
  (8) such agreement shall be subject to approval of the franchise over-
 sight board; provided, further, that the gaming commission shall publish
 such  agreement  on its website. Such agreement may also be amended from
 time to time as agreed to by the state and the  franchised  corporation;
 provided however, that such amendment must comply with the provisions of
 this act.  At any time prior to the repayment of the state funds for the
 renovation of Belmont Park racetrack, the state may issue state personal
 income  tax revenue bonds or state sales tax revenue bonds. In the event
 of the issuance of such bonds, the repayment agreement shall be  revised
 to  reflect  the obligation of the franchised corporation to fully repay
 the debt service costs associated with such bonds.
 S. 4009--C  55  A. 3009--C
 
  § 3. Prior to, and as a condition of, the  state  initially  providing
 funds  for  the  renovation  of  Belmont  Park racetrack, the franchised
 corporation shall also enter into an agreement  with  the  state  relin-
 quishing to the state its leasehold interest in real property located in
 South Ozone Park, commonly known as Aqueduct Racetrack, upon substantial
 completion  of the renovation of Belmont Park racetrack; provided howev-
 er, that upon such relinquishment,  such  lands  shall  fall  under  the
 jurisdiction  of  the  franchise  oversight  board and the provisions of
 section 212 of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding  law  shall
 govern the disposition and future real estate development of such lands.
 It  is  the  intention  of  the  legislature  for  race  dates presently
 conducted at Aqueduct racetrack to be transferred to  and  conducted  at
 Belmont  Park  racetrack,  when  the commission determines the franchise
 corporation is capable of hosting such dates. The number  of race  days
 at  Belmont  Park  racetrack shall be  agreed  to  in  writing by the
 franchised corporation, New York Thoroughbred  Breeders  Inc.,  the  New
 York  Thoroughbred  Horsemen's Association  (or  such  other entity  as
 is certified  and  approved pursuant to section 228 of the racing, pari-
 mutuel wagering and breeding law) and approved by the gaming commission.
 If such agreement cannot be made, the gaming commission shall  determine
 the number of race days at Belmont Park racetrack.
  §  4.  The  New  York State Gaming Commission shall ensure that to the
 extent that the law allows for a franchise agreement for  the  operation
 of  Belmont  Park  racetrack with a franchisee other than the franchised
 corporation, the term of any  such  franchise  agreement  awarded  after
 funding  provided  by the state for the renovation of Belmont Park race-

 racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law, as amended by  section  1
 of  part  EE  of  chapter  59 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (a) Any  racing  association  or  corporation  or  regional  off-track
 betting  corporation,  authorized  to conduct pari-mutuel wagering under
 this chapter, desiring to display the simulcast of horse races on  which
 pari-mutuel  betting shall be permitted in the manner and subject to the
 conditions provided for in this article may apply to the commission  for
 a  license  so to do. Applications for licenses shall be in such form as
 may be prescribed by the commission and shall contain  such  information
 or  other material or evidence as the commission may require. No license
 shall be issued by the commission authorizing the simulcast transmission
 of thoroughbred races from a track located in Suffolk  county.  The  fee
 for  such  licenses shall be five hundred dollars per simulcast facility
 and for account wagering licensees that do not operate either  a  simul-
 cast facility that is open to the public within the state of New York or
 a  licensed racetrack within the state, twenty thousand dollars per year
 payable by the licensee to the commission for deposit into  the  general
 fund.  Except  as  provided  in  this  section, the commission shall not
 approve any application to conduct simulcasting into individual or group
 residences, homes or other areas for the purposes of  or  in  connection
 with  pari-mutuel wagering. The commission may approve simulcasting into
 residences, homes or other areas to be conducted jointly by one or  more
 regional  off-track  betting corporations and one or more of the follow-
 ing: a franchised corporation,  thoroughbred  racing  corporation  or  a
 harness racing corporation or association; provided (i) the simulcasting
 consists  only of those races on which pari-mutuel betting is authorized
 by this chapter at one or more simulcast  facilities  for  each  of  the
 contracting  off-track  betting  corporations which shall include wagers
 made in accordance with  section  one  thousand  fifteen,  one  thousand
 sixteen  and  one  thousand  seventeen of this article; provided further
 that the contract provisions or other simulcast  arrangements  for  such
 simulcast  facility  shall  be no less favorable than those in effect on
 January first, two thousand  five;  (ii)  that  each  off-track  betting
 corporation  having  within  its  geographic boundaries such residences,
 homes or other areas technically  capable  of  receiving  the  simulcast
 signal  shall be a contracting party; (iii) the distribution of revenues
 shall be subject to contractual agreement of  the  parties  except  that
 statutory  payments  to  non-contracting  parties,  if  any,  may not be
 reduced; provided, however, that nothing herein to  the  contrary  shall
 prevent a track from televising its races on an irregular basis primari-
 ly for promotional or marketing purposes as found by the commission. For
 purposes of this paragraph, the provisions of section one thousand thir-
 teen  of  this  article  shall  not  apply. Any agreement authorizing an
 in-home simulcasting experiment commencing prior to May fifteenth, nine-
 teen hundred ninety-five, may, and all its terms, be extended until June
 thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-three] TWENTY-FOUR;  provided,  however,
 that  any  party to such agreement may elect to terminate such agreement
 S. 4009--C  60  A. 3009--C
 
 upon conveying written notice to all other parties of such agreement  at
 least  forty-five  days  prior to the effective date of the termination,

 an  intent  to  terminate, may request the commission to mediate between
 the parties new terms and conditions in a replacement agreement  between
 the  parties  as will permit continuation of an in-home experiment until
 June thirtieth, two thousand [twenty-three]  TWENTY-FOUR;  and  (iv)  no
 in-home  simulcasting in the thoroughbred special betting district shall
 occur without the approval of the regional thoroughbred track.

 exclusively for purses to be awarded at races conducted by such  receiv-
 ing track shall be computed as follows: of the sums so retained, two and
 one-half  percent  of the total pools. Such amount shall be increased or
 decreased in the amount of fifty percent  of  the  difference  in  total
 commissions  determined  by  comparing  the  total commissions available
 after July twenty-first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  to  the  total
 commissions  that  would have been available to such track prior to July
 twenty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-five.

 casting  facility licensed in accordance with section one thousand seven

 or  any  receiver, referee, trustee, assignee or other fiduciary, or any
 officer or agent appointed by any court, who conducts  the  business  of
