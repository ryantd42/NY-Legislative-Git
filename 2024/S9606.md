 AN  ACT  authorizing the county of Nassau assessor to accept an applica-
  tion for a real property tax exemption from  the  Lighthouse  Interna-
  tional Christian Gathering

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the Lighthouse International  Christian  Gathering  an  application  for
 exemption  from  real property taxes pursuant to section 430 of the real
 property tax law for the assessment roll for the 2022-2023, portions  of
 the  2023-2024  and  the 2024-2025 school taxes and portions of the 2024
 and 2025 general taxes for the  parcel  conveyed  to  such  organization
 located  at  800 West Merrick Road, town of Hempstead, county of Nassau,
 otherwise known as Nassau county parcel ID section 37, block  407,  lots
 222,  223, 224, 225, 236. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed
 as if it had been received on or before the taxable status  date  estab-
 lished for such roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction  to  the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such
 organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax  with  respect  to  the
 subject  rolls,  the applicable governing body or tax department may, in
 its sole discretion, provide for the refund  of  those  taxes  paid  and
 cancel  those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
