 tory personnel regardless of the laboratory's final analysis or results.

 received results from, a forensic science laboratory or  similar  entity
 not under the prosecution's direction or control, the court on motion of
 a  party shall issue subpoenas or orders to such laboratory or entity to
 cause materials under this paragraph to be made  available  for  disclo-

 search  or  seizure  by  a public servant or an agent thereof, and which

 after  allegedly  being  abandoned  by the defendant. If the prosecution

 (f),  (g),  (h), (j), (l) and (o)] SUBPARAGRAPHS (IV), (V), (VI), (VIII)
 S. 5885  11
 
 OR (XII) OF PARAGRAPH (A), SUBPARAGRAPHS (III), (IV), OR (VI)  OF  PARA-
 GRAPH  (B), OR SUBPARAGRAPHS (I) OR (II) OF PARAGRAPH (C) of subdivision
 one of this section, which the defendant intends to introduce  at  trial
 or  a  pre-trial hearing, and the names, addresses, birth dates, and all
 statements, written or recorded or summarized in any writing or  record-
 ing,  of  those  persons  other  than  the  defendant whom the defendant
 intends to call as witnesses at trial or a pre-trial hearing.
  (b) Disclosure of the name, address, birth date, and  all  statements,
 written  or  recorded  or  summarized  in any writing or recording, of a
 person whom the defendant intends to call as  a  witness  for  the  sole

 effect  of  a  court order, and failure to provide discovery pursuant to
 such section or subdivision may result in application of any remedies or
 sanctions permitted for non-compliance with a court order under  section
 245.80 of this article. However, if in the judgment of either party good
 cause  exists  for  declining  to  make any of the disclosures set forth
 above, such party may move for a protective order  pursuant  to  section
 245.70  of this article and production of the item shall be stayed pend-
 ing a ruling by the court. The opposing party shall be notified in writ-
 ing that information has not been disclosed under a particular  section.
 When  some  parts of material or information are discoverable but in the
 judgment of a party good cause exists for declining  to  disclose  other
 parts,  the  discoverable  parts  shall  be disclosed and the disclosing
 party shall give notice in writing that non-discoverable parts have been
 withheld.

 tion  have been furnished pursuant to section 700.70 of this chapter, or

 not  represented  by  counsel and has requested an adjournment to obtain
 S. 5885  12

 counsel or to have counsel assigned, such forty-five  day  period  shall
 commence on the date counsel initially appears on defendant's behalf.]
  §  5.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
