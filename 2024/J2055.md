BY: Senator GIANARIS
 
  RECOGNIZING  the  Federation  of  Cypriot American
  Organizations in conjunction with its  commemoration
  of  the 50th Anniversary of the Turkish invasion and
  occupation of Northern Cyprus
 
  WHEREAS, On July 20, 1974, Turkish  troops  invaded  the  island  of
Cyprus and captured and occupied the northern part of the island; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Turkish invasion ended in the partition of Cyprus along
the UN-monitored Green Line, which still divides Cyprus; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  Nations  Security  Council  has  repeatedly
reaffirmed its respect for the territorial integrity of the Republic  of
Cyprus,  and  in 1983 resolved that it considers the purported secession
of the northern part of the island to be "legally invalid;" and
 
  WHEREAS, The invasion violently uprooted tens of thousands of  Greek
Cypriots; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  such refugees settled in New York, which is now home
to the largest Cypriot diaspora community in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are approximately 80,000 Americans  of  Greek-Cypriot
descent in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The year 2024 will mark the 50th Anniversary of the Turkish
invasion; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Federation of Cypriot American Organizations represents
dozens  of  Cypriot  community  groups  across the United States for the
purpose of building solidarity among its chapters, preserving Greek  and
Cypriot  cultural  heritage,  and  promoting  social,  educational,  and
community enrichment; and
 
  WHEREAS, On July 20,  2024,  the  Federation,  along  with  Cypriots
across  the world, will commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the invasion
and partition of Cyprus; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
pay  tribute  to  the  Federation  of  Cypriot American Organizations in
conjunction with its  commemoration  of  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the
Turkish invasion and occupation of Northern Cyprus; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Federation of Cypriot American Organizations.
