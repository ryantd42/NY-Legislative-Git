  MOURNING  the  death  of  Ava  Conklin,  beloved
  daughter and sister, bright student,  and  cherished
  friend to many
 
  WHEREAS, It is with feelings of deepest regret that this Legislative
Body  records  the  passing  of  Ava Conklin, an exceptional young woman
whose unending joy, spirit of generosity, and sincerity  endure  through
all those who knew her; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ava Conklin of New York, New York died on June 24, 2023, at
the age of 19; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A young woman raised in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of
New York  City,  who  also  spent  considerable  time  on  the  Rockaway
Peninsula  in  Queens, Ava Conklin was a student and psychology major at
Northern Vermont University; her eagerness to  learn  rivaled  only  her
passion  for  performing  arts  and theater, as exemplified by a special
love for Broadway and performances of her own; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ava Conklin was known by her family as an  eternally  happy
spirit,  with an old soul but a child's heart, known for her love of ice
cream, travel, animals, and music, most notably the  Beatles;  she  knew
the  joy  of  bringing  happiness  to  others  and always found time for
family, even when there seemed to be none; and
 
  WHEREAS, Her bright  light  still  shines  through  the  people  she
unexpectedly  brought  together,  including  unlikely  friendships built
among Ava Conklin's friends of all different eras  of  her  life;  these
enduring  relationships  continue  to  reflect  her  outgoing spirit and
innate generosity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ava Conklin is survived by  her  mother,  Chrissy  Collins;
father,  Matthew  Conklin;  siblings,  Emma,  Hudson,  Dylan, Gabby, and
Peyton; dear lifelong friends, Samantha, Kilsey, Mina,  Eddie,  Patrick,
Heaven, and Mya, to whom she was closest for the longest period; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Characterized  by  a profound capacity for love, be it for
family, friends, or the Earth, Ava Conklin leaves behind a legacy  which
will  long  endure  the  passage of time and will remain as a comforting
memory to all she knew and all those who loved her; now,  therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
mourn the death of Ava Conklin, and to express its  deepest  condolences
to her family, friends, and community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Ava Conklin.
