  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 8, 2023, as International Women's Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year  New  York  State officially sets aside time to
recognize the unique contributions that New York women have made to  New
York State and beyond; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State has a distinguished history of monumental
achievements in the area of women's rights; and
 
  WHEREAS, International Women's Day  (IWD),  recognized  annually  on
March  8th,  is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural,
and political achievements of women; the day also marks a call to action
for accelerating women's equality; and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital day of recognition has occurred for well over  a
century,  with  the  first  International  Women's Day gathering in 1911
supported by over a million people; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, International Women's  Day  belongs  to  all  groups
collectively  everywhere,  and  is  not  country,  group or organization
specific; and
 
  WHEREAS, The theme for International Women's Day  2023  is  "Embrace
Equity,"  and  encourages  all  people  to  actively support and embrace
equity within their own sphere of influence; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, individuals are encouraged to strike  the  IWD
2023  pose,  embracing  oneself in solidarity and support of challenging
gender stereotypes, calling out  discrimination,  drawing  attention  to
bias, and seeking out inclusion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Whether deliberate or unconscious, bias makes it difficult
for women to move ahead; knowing that bias exists is not enough;  action
is needed to level the playing field; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Collective  action and shared ownership for driving gender
parity is what makes International Women's  Day  impactful;  celebrating
women's  achievements  and  increasing  visibility,  while  calling  out
inequality, is key to its success; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining true to its mission,  International  Women's  Day
builds  workplaces  where women thrive, elevates the visibility of women
creatives, promotes women's empowerment worldwide, champions  the  women
forging  innovation  through technology, elevates women fostering change
via technology and sustainability in communities, workplaces and beyond,
and empowers women to make informed decisions about their  health;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  8,  2023,  as
International Women's Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
