 forth in subdivision (c) of this section;
  (ii) facts which support the petitioner's belief that the  subject  of

  [(3)] (4) The petition shall be accompanied by an affirmation or affi-
 davit of a physician, who shall not be the petitioner, stating THAT SUCH
 PHYSICIAN  IS WILLING AND ABLE TO TESTIFY AT THE HEARING ON THE PETITION
 AND THAT either [that]:
  (i) such physician has personally examined the subject of the petition

 tion[, and is willing and able to testify at the hearing  on  the  peti-
 tion]; or

 PRIOR TO PROVIDING TESTIMONY.
  [(4)] (5) In counties with a population of less than eighty  thousand,

  [(g)] (H) Right to counsel. The subject of the petition shall have the
 right to be represented by the mental hygiene legal service, or private-
 ly  financed counsel, at all stages of a proceeding commenced under this
 section.
  [(h)] (I) Hearing. (1) Upon receipt of the petition, the  court  shall
 fix  the date for a hearing. Such date shall be no later than three days
 from the date such petition is received by the court,  excluding  Satur-
 days,  Sundays  and  holidays.  Adjournments shall be permitted only for
 good cause shown. In granting adjournments, the court shall consider the
 need for further examination by a physician or  the  potential  need  to
 provide  assisted  outpatient  treatment  expeditiously. The court shall
 cause the subject of the petition, any  other  person  receiving  notice
 pursuant  to  subdivision [(f)] (G) of this section, the petitioner, the
 physician whose affirmation or affidavit accompanied the  petition,  and
 such  other  persons  as  the  court may determine to be advised of such
 date. Upon such date, or upon such other date to  which  the  proceeding
 may  be  adjourned,  the court shall hear testimony and, if it be deemed
 advisable and the subject of the  petition  is  available,  examine  the
 subject  of the petition in or out of court. If the subject of the peti-
 tion does not appear at the hearing, and appropriate attempts to  elicit
 the  attendance  of  the  subject have failed, the court may conduct the
 hearing in the subject's absence. In such  case,  the  court  shall  set
 forth  the factual basis for conducting the hearing without the presence
 of the subject of the petition.
  (2) The court shall not order assisted outpatient treatment unless  an
 examining  physician,  who  recommends assisted outpatient treatment and
 has personally examined the subject of the petition  no  more  than  ten
 days before the filing of the petition, testifies in person or by video-
 conference  at  the hearing. Provided however, a physician shall only be
 authorized to testify by video conference when it has  been:  (i)  shown
 that  diligent  efforts  have been made to attend such hearing in person
 and the subject of the petition consents to the physician testifying  by
 video  conference;  or (ii) the court orders the physician to testify by
 video conference upon a finding of  good  cause.  Such  physician  shall
 state the facts and clinical determinations which support the allegation
 that the subject of the petition meets each of the criteria for assisted
 outpatient  treatment;  PROVIDED  THAT  THE  PARTIES MAY STIPULATE, UPON
 MUTUAL CONSENT, THAT SUCH PHYSICIAN NEED NOT TESTIFY.
  (3) If the subject of the petition has refused to  be  examined  by  a
 physician,  the  court may request the subject to consent to an examina-
 tion by a physician appointed by the court. If the subject of the  peti-
 tion  does  not  consent and the court finds reasonable cause to believe
 that the allegations in the petition are true, the court may order peace
 officers, acting pursuant to their special duties,  or  police  officers
 who  are  members  of  an authorized police department or force, or of a
 sheriff's department to take the subject of the  petition  into  custody
 and  transport  him or her to a hospital for examination by a physician.
 A. 4451  8
 
 Retention of the subject of the petition  under  such  order  shall  not
 exceed twenty-four hours. The examination of the subject of the petition
 may  be performed by the physician whose affirmation or affidavit accom-
 panied  the  petition  pursuant to paragraph [three] FOUR of subdivision
 [(e)] (F) of this section, if  such  physician  is  privileged  by  such
 hospital  or  otherwise  authorized  by  such hospital to do so. If such
 examination is performed by another physician, the  examining  physician
 may  consult  with the physician whose affirmation or affidavit accompa-
 nied the petition as to whether  the  subject  meets  the  criteria  for
 assisted outpatient treatment.
  (4) A physician who testifies pursuant to paragraph two of this subdi-
 vision  shall  state:  (i) the facts [which] AND CLINICAL DETERMINATIONS
 THAT support the allegation that the subject meets each of the  criteria
 for  assisted outpatient treatment, (ii) that the treatment is the least
 restrictive  alternative,  (iii)  the  recommended  assisted  outpatient
 treatment,  and  (iv)  the rationale for the recommended assisted outpa-
 tient  treatment.  If  the  recommended  assisted  outpatient  treatment
 includes medication, such physician's testimony shall describe the types
 or  classes of medication which should be authorized, shall describe the
 beneficial and detrimental physical and mental effects of  such  medica-
 tion,  and shall recommend whether such medication should be self-admin-
 istered or administered by authorized personnel.
  (5) The subject of the petition shall be afforded  an  opportunity  to
 present  evidence, to call witnesses on his or her behalf, and to cross-
 examine adverse witnesses.
  [(i)] (J) Written treatment  plan.  (1)  The  court  shall  not  order
 assisted outpatient treatment unless a physician appointed by the appro-
 priate  director,  in  consultation  with  such  director,  develops and
 provides to the court a proposed written  treatment  plan.  The  written
 treatment  plan  shall  include  case  management  services or assertive
 community treatment team services  to  provide  care  coordination.  The
 written treatment plan also shall include all categories of services, as
 set  forth  in  paragraph  one of subdivision (a) of this section, which
 such physician recommends that the subject of the petition receive.  All
 service  providers  shall  be  notified regarding their inclusion in the
 written treatment plan. If the written treatment plan  includes  medica-
 tion, it shall state whether such medication should be self-administered
 or  administered  by  authorized  personnel,  and shall specify type and
 dosage range of medication most likely to provide  maximum  benefit  for
 the subject. If the written treatment plan includes alcohol or substance
 abuse  counseling  and  treatment,  such  plan  may  include a provision
 requiring relevant testing for  either  alcohol  or  illegal  substances
 provided  the  physician's  clinical  basis  for  recommending such plan
 provides sufficient facts for the court to find (i) that such person has
 a history of alcohol or substance abuse that is  clinically  related  to
 the mental illness; and (ii) that such testing is necessary to prevent a
 relapse or deterioration which would be likely to result in serious harm
 to  the  person  or others. If a director is the petitioner, the written
 treatment plan shall be provided to the court no later than the date  of
 the  hearing  on  the petition. If a person other than a director is the
 petitioner, such plan shall be provided to the court no later  than  the
 date  set  by the court pursuant to paragraph three of subdivision [(j)]
 (K) of this section.
  (2) The physician appointed to  develop  the  written  treatment  plan
 shall  provide  the  following  persons  with an opportunity to actively
 participate in the development of such plan: the subject  of  the  peti-
 A. 4451  9
 
 tion;  the  treating  physician,  if  any;  and  upon the request of the
 subject of the  petition,  an  individual  significant  to  the  subject
 including  any  relative, close friend or individual otherwise concerned
 with  the  welfare  of the subject. THE APPOINTED PHYSICIAN SHALL MAKE A
 REASONABLE EFFORT TO GATHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT  OF
 THE  TREATMENT  PLAN FROM THE SUBJECT OF THE PETITION'S FAMILY MEMBER OR
 MEMBERS, OR HIS OR HER SIGNIFICANT OTHER. If the subject of the petition
 has executed a health care proxy, the appointed physician shall consider
 any directions included in such proxy in developing the  written  treat-
 ment plan.
  (3)  The  court shall not order assisted outpatient treatment unless a
 physician appearing on behalf of a director  testifies  to  explain  the
 written  proposed  treatment  plan; PROVIDED THAT THE PARTIES MAY STIPU-
 LATE, UPON MUTUAL CONSENT, THAT SUCH PHYSICIAN NEED NOT TESTIFY.  Such
 physician  shall  state  the categories of assisted outpatient treatment
 recommended, the rationale for each such category, facts which establish
 that such treatment is the least restrictive alternative,  and,  if  the
 recommended assisted outpatient treatment plan includes medication, such
 physician  shall  state  the types or classes of medication recommended,
 the beneficial and detrimental physical and mental effects of such medi-
 cation, and whether  such  medication  should  be  self-administered  or
 administered  by an authorized professional. If the subject of the peti-
 tion has executed a health care proxy, such physician  shall  state  the
 consideration given to any directions included in such proxy in develop-
 ing  the written treatment plan. If a director is the petitioner, testi-
 mony pursuant to this paragraph shall be given at  the  hearing  on  the
 petition.  If  a  person  other  than a director is the petitioner, such
 testimony shall be given on the date set by the court pursuant to  para-
 graph three of subdivision [(j)] (K) of this section.
  [(j)] (K) Disposition. (1) If after hearing all relevant evidence, the
 court does not find by clear and convincing evidence that the subject of
 the  petition  meets the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment, the
 court shall dismiss the petition.
  (2) If after hearing all relevant evidence, the court finds  by  clear
 and  convincing  evidence  that  the  subject  of the petition meets the
 criteria for assisted outpatient treatment, and there is no  appropriate
 and  feasible  less  restrictive  alternative,  the  court may order the
 subject to receive assisted outpatient treatment for an  initial  period
 not to exceed one year. In fashioning the order, the court shall specif-
 ically  make findings by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed
 treatment is the least restrictive treatment  appropriate  and  feasible
 for  the subject. The order shall state an assisted outpatient treatment
 plan, which shall include all categories of assisted  outpatient  treat-
 ment,  as set forth in paragraph one of subdivision (a) of this section,
 which the assisted outpatient is to receive, but shall not  include  any
 such category that has not been recommended in [both] the proposed writ-
 ten  treatment  plan  and  [the]  IN ANY testimony provided to the court
 pursuant to subdivision [(i)](J) of this section.
  (3) If after hearing all relevant evidence presented by  a  petitioner
 who  is not a director, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence
 that the subject of the petition meets the criteria for assisted  outpa-
 tient  treatment,  and  the  court has yet to be provided with a written
 proposed treatment plan and testimony pursuant to subdivision [(i)]  (J)
 of  this  section,  the  court  shall  order the appropriate director to
 provide the court with such plan and testimony no later than  the  third
 day,  excluding  Saturdays,  Sundays and holidays, immediately following
 A. 4451  10
 
 the date of such order; PROVIDED THAT THE PARTIES  MAY  STIPULATE,  UPON
 MUTUAL  CONSENT, THAT SUCH TESTIMONY NEED NOT BE PROVIDED.  Upon receiv-
 ing such plan and ANY REQUIRED testimony, the court may  order  assisted
 outpatient treatment as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision.
  (4)  A  court  may  order  the patient to self-administer psychotropic
 drugs or accept the administration of such drugs by authorized personnel
 as part of an assisted outpatient  treatment  program.  Such  order  may
 specify  the  type  and dosage range of such psychotropic drugs and such
 order shall be effective for the duration of  such  assisted  outpatient
 treatment.
  (5)  If  the petitioner is the director of a hospital that operates an
 assisted outpatient treatment program, the court order shall direct  the
 hospital  director  to provide or arrange for all categories of assisted
 outpatient treatment for the assisted outpatient throughout  the  period
 of the order. In all other instances, the order shall require the appro-
 priate  director, as that term is defined in this section, to provide or
 arrange for all categories of  assisted  outpatient  treatment  for  the
 assisted  outpatient  throughout the period of the order.  ORDERS ISSUED
 ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAPTER OF THE LAWS OF  TWO  THOU-
 SAND  TWENTY-THREE THAT AMENDED THIS SECTION SHALL REQUIRE THE APPROPRI-
 ATE DIRECTOR "AS DETERMINED BY THE PROGRAM COORDINATOR"  TO  PROVIDE  OR
 ARRANGE  FOR  ALL  CATEGORIES  OF  ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT FOR THE
 ASSISTED OUTPATIENT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE ORDER.
  (6) The director shall cause a copy of any court order issued pursuant
 to this section to be served personally, or by mail, facsimile or  elec-
 tronic  means,  upon  the  assisted outpatient, the mental hygiene legal
 service or anyone  acting  on  the  assisted  outpatient's  behalf,  the
 original  petitioner, identified service providers, and all others enti-
 tled to notice under subdivision [(f)] (G) of this section.
  [(k)] (L) RELOCATION OF ASSISTED OUTPATIENTS. THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL
 PROMULGATE  REGULATIONS  REQUIRING THAT, DURING THE PERIOD OF THE ORDER,
 AN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT AND ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE  PERSONS  SHALL  NOTIFY
 THE  PROGRAM COORDINATOR WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME PRIOR TO SUCH ASSISTED
 OUTPATIENT RELOCATING WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO AN AREA NOT SERVED
 BY THE DIRECTOR WHO HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO  PROVIDE  OR  ARRANGE  FOR  THE
 ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. UPON RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF SUCH RELO-
 CATION,  THE  PROGRAM  COORDINATOR SHALL REDETERMINE WHO THE APPROPRIATE
 DIRECTOR SHALL BE AND CAUSE A COPY OF THE COURT ORDER AND TREATMENT PLAN
 TO BE TRANSMITTED TO SUCH DIRECTOR.
  (M) Petition for [additional  periods  of]  CONTINUED  treatment.  (1)
 [Prior]  WITHIN THIRTY DAYS PRIOR to the expiration of an order pursuant
 to this section, the  appropriate  director  shall  review  whether  the
 assisted  outpatient  continues to meet the criteria for assisted outpa-
 tient treatment. [If, as documented in the petition, the director deter-
 mines that such criteria continue to be  met  or  has  made  appropriate
 attempts  to,  but has not been successful in eliciting, the cooperation
 of the subject to submit to an examination, within thirty days prior  to
 the expiration of an order of assisted outpatient treatment, such direc-
 tor may petition the court to order continued assisted outpatient treat-
 ment  pursuant  to  paragraph  two of this subdivision. Upon determining
 whether such criteria continue to be met, such director shall notify the
 program coordinator in writing as to whether a  petition  for  continued
 assisted  outpatient  treatment is warranted and whether such a petition
 was or will be filed.] UPON DETERMINING THAT ONE OR MORE OF SUCH  CRITE-
 RIA  ARE NO LONGER MET, SUCH DIRECTOR SHALL NOTIFY THE PROGRAM COORDINA-
 TOR IN WRITING THAT A PETITION FOR CONTINUED ASSISTED OUTPATIENT  TREAT-
 A. 4451  11
 
 MENT  IS NOT WARRANTED.  UPON DETERMINING THAT SUCH CRITERIA CONTINUE TO
 BE MET, HE OR SHE SHALL PETITION THE COURT TO ORDER  CONTINUED  ASSISTED
 OUTPATIENT  TREATMENT FOR A PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED ONE YEAR FROM THE EXPI-
 RATION  DATE  OF  THE  CURRENT ORDER. IF THE COURT'S DISPOSITION OF SUCH
 PETITION DOES NOT OCCUR PRIOR TO THE  EXPIRATION  DATE  OF  THE  CURRENT
 ORDER,  THE CURRENT ORDER SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL SUCH DISPOSITION.
 THE PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING ANY  ORDER  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SUBDIVISION
 SHALL  BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE FOREGOING SUBDIVISION
 OF THIS SECTION; PROVIDED THAT THE TIME RESTRICTIONS INCLUDED  IN  PARA-
 GRAPH  FOUR  OF SUBDIVISION (C) OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE APPLICABLE.
 THE NOTICE PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH SIX OF SUBDIVISION  (K)  OF

 OPED THE WRITTEN TREATMENT PLAN OR ANOTHER PHYSICIAN DESIGNATED  BY  THE
 DIRECTOR, AND SUCH PHYSICIAN SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO TERMINATE SUCH BLOOD
 TESTS OR URINALYSIS WITHOUT FURTHER ACTION BY THE COURT.
  (2) Within thirty days prior to the expiration of an order of assisted
 outpatient  treatment,  [the  appropriate director or] the current peti-
 tioner, if the current petition was filed pursuant to  subparagraph  (i)
 or  (ii)  of paragraph one of subdivision [(e)] (F) of this section, and
 the current petitioner retains his or her original  status  pursuant  to
 the  applicable  subparagraph, may petition the court to order continued
 assisted outpatient treatment for a period not to exceed one  year  from
 the  expiration date of the current order. If the court's disposition of
 such petition does not occur prior to the expiration date of the current
 order, the current order shall remain in effect until such  disposition.
 The  procedures  for  obtaining  any  order pursuant to this subdivision

 developed  the written treatment plan or another physician designated by
 the director, and such physician shall be authorized to  terminate  such
 blood tests or urinalysis without further action by the court.
  [(l)]  (3)  IF  NEITHER THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTOR NOR THE CURRENT PETI-
 TIONER PETITION FOR CONTINUED ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PURSUANT  TO
 THIS  PARAGRAPH  AND  THE  ORDER  OF THE COURT EXPIRES, ANY OTHER PERSON
 AUTHORIZED TO PETITION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH ONE OF SUBDIVISION  (F)  OF
 THIS SECTION MAY BRING A NEW PETITION FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT.
 IF  SUCH NEW PETITION IS FILED LESS THAN SIXTY DAYS AFTER THE EXPIRATION
 OF SUCH ORDER, THE TIME  RESTRICTIONS  PROVIDED  IN  PARAGRAPH  FOUR  OF
 SUBDIVISION (C) OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE APPLICABLE TO THE NEW PETI-
 TION.
  (4)  IF, THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF AN ORDER, THE ASSISTED
 OUTPATIENT IS DEEMED BY THE  APPROPRIATE  DIRECTOR  TO  BE  MISSING  AND
 THEREBY  UNAVAILABLE FOR EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER HE OR SHE CONTINUES TO
 MEET THE CRITERIA FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT, SUCH DIRECTOR SHALL
 PETITION THE COURT TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CURRENT ORDER  UNTIL  SIXTY
 DAYS AFTER SUCH TIME AS THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT IS LOCATED. IF THE COURT
 GRANTS  THE EXTENSION, THE DIRECTOR SHALL CONTINUE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO
 LOCATE THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT.  UPON LOCATION OF  THE  ASSISTED  OUTPA-
 TIENT, THE DIRECTOR SHALL REVIEW WHETHER THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT CONTIN-
 A. 4451  12

 UES  TO MEET THE CRITERIA FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT, PURSUANT TO
 PARAGRAPH TWO OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (N)  Petition  for an order to stay, vacate or modify. (1) In addition
 to any other right or remedy available by law with respect to the  order
 for  assisted  outpatient treatment, the assisted outpatient, the mental
 hygiene legal service, or anyone acting  on  the  assisted  outpatient's
 behalf  may  petition  the court on notice to the director, the original
 petitioner, and all others entitled to notice  under  subdivision  [(f)]
 (G) of this section to stay, vacate or modify the order.
  (2)  The  appropriate  director  shall petition the court for approval
 before instituting a proposed material change in the assisted outpatient
 treatment plan, unless such change is authorized by  the  order  of  the
 court.  SUCH PETITIONS TO CHANGE AN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PLAN,
 AS WELL AS PETITIONS FOR CONTINUED TREATMENT, MAY BE MADE TO  ANY  JUDGE
 OF  THE  SUPREME  OR COUNTY COURTS IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE SUBJECT OF
 THE PETITION IS PRESENT OR REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE PRESENT. Such peti-
 tion shall be filed on notice to all parties entitled  to  notice  under
 subdivision  [(f)]  (G)  of this section. Not later than five days after
 receiving such petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays,  the
 court  shall  hold  a  hearing  on  the  petition;  provided that if the
 assisted outpatient informs the court that  he  or  she  agrees  to  the
 proposed  material  change,  the court may approve such change without a
 hearing. Non-material changes may be instituted by the director  without
 court approval. For the purposes of this paragraph, a material change is
 an  addition  or deletion of a category of services to or from a current
 assisted  outpatient  treatment  plan,  or  any  deviation  without  the
 assisted outpatient's consent from the terms of a current order relating
 to the administration of psychotropic drugs.
  [(m)]  (O) Appeals. Review of an order issued pursuant to this section
 shall be had in like  manner  as  specified  in  section  9.35  of  this
 article;  PROVIDED THAT NOTICE SHALL BE PROVIDED TO ALL PARTIES ENTITLED
 TO NOTICE UNDER SUBDIVISION (G) OF THIS SECTION.
  [(n)] (P) Failure to comply with assisted outpatient treatment.  Where
 in  the  clinical  judgment of a physician, (i) the assisted outpatient,
 has failed or refused to comply with the assisted outpatient  treatment,
 (ii)  efforts  were  made to solicit compliance, and (iii) such assisted
 outpatient may be in need of involuntary admission to a hospital  pursu-
 ant  to  section 9.27 of this article or immediate observation, care and
 treatment pursuant to section 9.39 or 9.40 of this article, such  physi-
 cian  may  request  the  appropriate director of community services, the
 director's designee, or any physician  designated  by  the  director  of
 community  services  pursuant to section 9.37 of this article, to direct
 the removal of such assisted outpatient to an appropriate  hospital  for
 an  examination  to  determine  if  such person has a mental illness for
 which HE OR SHE IS IN NEED OF hospitalization is necessary  pursuant  to
 section  9.27,  9.39  or  9.40  of  this  article[. Furthermore, if such
 assisted outpatient refuses to take medications as required by the court
 order, or he or she refuses to take, or fails a blood test,  urinalysis,
 or  alcohol  or drug test as required by the court order, such physician
 may consider such refusal or failure when determining whether]; PROVIDED
 THAT IF, AFTER EFFORTS TO SOLICIT COMPLIANCE, SUCH PHYSICIAN  DETERMINES
 THAT  THE  ASSISTED  OUTPATIENT'S  FAILURE  TO  COMPLY WITH THE ASSISTED
 OUTPATIENT TREATMENT INCLUDES A SUBSTANTIAL FAILURE TO TAKE  MEDICATION,
 PASS  OR SUBMIT TO BLOOD TESTING OR URINALYSIS, OR RECEIVE TREATMENT FOR
 ALCOHOL OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE, SUCH PHYSICIAN MAY PRESUME THAT the assisted
 outpatient is in need of an examination to determine whether he  or  she
 A. 4451  13
 
 has  a  mental  illness for which hospitalization is necessary. Upon the
 request of such physician,  the  appropriate  director,  the  director's
 designee,  or  any physician designated pursuant to section 9.37 of this
 article,  may  direct  peace  officers, acting pursuant to their special
 duties, or police officers who  are  members  of  an  authorized  police
 department  or  force  or of a sheriff's department to take the assisted
 outpatient into custody and transport him or her to the hospital operat-
 ing the assisted outpatient treatment program or to any hospital author-
 ized by the director of community services to receive such persons. Such
 law enforcement officials shall  carry  out  such  directive.  Upon  the
 request  of  such  physician,  the  appropriate director, the director's
 designee, or any physician designated pursuant to section 9.37  of  this
 article,  an ambulance service, as defined by subdivision two of section
 three thousand one of the public  health  law,  or  an  approved  mobile
 crisis outreach team as defined in section 9.58 of this article shall be
 authorized  to  take  into  custody and transport any such person to the
 hospital operating the assisted outpatient treatment program, or to  any
 other  hospital  authorized  by  the  appropriate  director of community
 services to receive such persons. Any director of community services, or
 designee, shall be authorized to  direct  the  removal  of  an  assisted
 outpatient  who is present in his or her county to an appropriate hospi-
 tal, in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision, based upon a
 determination of the appropriate director of community services  direct-
 ing  the  removal  of such assisted outpatient pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion. Such person may be retained for observation,  care  and  treatment
 and  further  examination in the hospital for up to seventy-two hours to
 permit a physician to determine whether such person has a mental illness
 and is in need of involuntary care and treatment in a hospital  pursuant
 to  the  provisions of this article. Any continued involuntary retention
 OF THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT in such hospital beyond the initial  seventy-
 two hour period shall be in accordance with the provisions of this arti-
 cle  relating to the involuntary admission and retention of a person. If
 at any time during the seventy-two hour period the person is  determined
 not  to  meet the involuntary admission and retention provisions of this
 article, and does not agree to stay in the hospital as  a  voluntary  or
 informal  patient, he or she must be released. Failure to comply with an
 order of assisted outpatient treatment shall not be grounds for involun-
 tary civil commitment or a finding of contempt of court.
  [(o)] (Q) Effect of determination that a person is in need of assisted
 outpatient treatment. The determination by a court that a person  is  in
 need  of  assisted  outpatient  treatment  shall  not be construed as or
 deemed to be a determination that such person is incapacitated  pursuant
 to article eighty-one of this chapter.
  [(p)] (R) False petition. A person making a false statement or provid-
 ing  false information or false testimony in a petition or hearing under
 this section shall be subject to criminal prosecution pursuant to  arti-
 cle  one  hundred  seventy-five  or article two hundred ten of the penal
 law.
  [(q)] (S) Exception. Nothing in this section  shall  be  construed  to
 affect  the  ability of the director of a hospital to receive, admit, or
 retain patients who  otherwise  meet  the  provisions  of  this  article
 regarding receipt, retention or admission.
  [(r)]  (T)  Education and training. (1) The office [of mental health],
 in consultation with the office of court administration,  shall  prepare
 educational  and  training  materials  on the use of this section, which
 shall be made  available  to  local  governmental  units,  providers  of
 A. 4451  14
 
 services,  judges,  court  personnel,  law enforcement officials and the
 general public.
  (2)  The  office,  in  consultation  with the office of court adminis-
 tration, shall establish a mental health training  program  for  supreme
 and  county  court  judges  and  court personnel, AND SHALL PROVIDE SUCH
 TRAINING WITH SUCH FREQUENCY AND IN SUCH LOCATIONS AS MAY BE APPROPRIATE
 TO MEET STATEWIDE NEEDS.  Such training shall focus on the use  of  this
 section  and  generally  address  issues  relating to mental illness and
 mental health treatment.
  [(s)] (U) A director of community services or his or her designee  may
 require  a  provider  of  inpatient  psychiatric  services  operated  or
 licensed by the office  of  mental  health  to  provide  contemporaneous
 information,  including  but  not  limited to relevant clinical records,
 documents,  and  other  information  concerning  the  person  receiving
 assisted  outpatient treatment pursuant to an active assisted outpatient
 treatment order, that is deemed necessary by such director  or  designee
 who is required to coordinate and monitor the care of any individual who
 was  subject  to an active assisted outpatient treatment order to appro-
 priately discharge their duties pursuant to section 9.47 of  this  arti-
 cle,  and  where  such  provider  of  inpatient  psychiatric services is
 required to disclose such information pursuant to  paragraph  twelve  of
 subdivision  (c) of section 33.13 of this chapter and such disclosure is
 in accordance with all other applicable state and federal confidentiali-
 ty laws. None of the records or information obtained by the director  of
 community services pursuant to this subdivision shall be public records,
 and  the  records shall not be released by the director to any person or
 agency, except as already authorized by law.
  § 6. Section 29.15 of the mental hygiene law is amended  by  adding  a
 new subdivision (o) to read as follows:

 ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 9.60 OF  THIS  CHAPTER
 UPON  THE  DISCHARGE  OF AN INPATIENT ADMITTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 9.27,
 9.39 OR 9.40 OF THIS CHAPTER, OR UPON THE  EXPIRATION  OF  A  PERIOD  OF
 CONDITIONAL  RELEASE FOR SUCH INPATIENT, SUCH DIRECTOR SHALL REPORT SUCH
 DISCHARGE OR SUCH EXPIRATION IN WRITING TO  THE  DIRECTOR  OF  COMMUNITY
 SERVICES  OF  THE  LOCAL  GOVERNMENTAL  UNIT  IN  WHICH THE INPATIENT IS
 EXPECTED TO RESIDE.

 shall ensure that a clinical assessment has been completed to  determine
 whether  the  incarcerated  individual  meets  the criteria for assisted
 outpatient treatment pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 9.60 of  the
 mental  hygiene  law.  If,  as a result of such assessment, the director
 determines that the incarcerated individual meets such  criteria,  prior
 to  discharge  the  director of the hospital shall either petition for a
 court order pursuant to section 9.60  of  the  mental  hygiene  law,  or
 report  in  writing  to  the director of community services of the local
 governmental unit in which the incarcerated individual  is  expected  to
 reside  so  that  an  investigation [may] SHALL be conducted pursuant to
 section 9.47 of the mental hygiene law.
  5. WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD PRIOR TO  RELEASE  OR  DISCHARGE  OF  AN
 INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL WHO IS NOT CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO A HOSPITAL IN
 A. 4451  15
 
 THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HYGIENE FROM A STATE CORRECTIONAL  FACILITY  TO
 THE  COMMUNITY,  IF  SUCH  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL HAS A SERIOUS MENTAL
 ILLNESS PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (E) OF  SUBDIVISION  SIX  OF  SECTION  ONE
 HUNDRED  THIRTY-SEVEN  OF  THIS CHAPTER, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL NOTIFY THE
