 The 1999 medicaid revenue reduction  percentages,  taking  into  account
 regional and program differences in utilization of medicaid and medicare

  (i)  eight  hundred  twenty-five  thousandths (.825) of one percentage
 point for CHHAs located within the downstate region;

 age is not equal to or  less  than  the  1996  target  medicaid  revenue
 percentage,  the  commissioner of health shall compare the 1996 medicaid
 revenue percentage to the 1996 target  medicaid  revenue  percentage  to
 determine  the  amount  of the shortfall which, when divided by the 1996
 medicaid  revenue  reduction  percentage,  shall  be  called  the  1996
 reduction  factor.  These  amounts, expressed as a percentage, shall not
 exceed one hundred percent. If the 1996 medicaid revenue  percentage  is

 as  a  proportion  of  the  total of each CHHA's and LTHHCP's failure to
 achieve the 1996 target medicaid revenue percentage within the  applica-
 ble  regional group. This proportion shall be multiplied by the applica-

 the applicable year within the applicable regional group.  This  propor-
 tion  shall be multiplied by the applicable year's state share reduction
 amount calculation pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision 6  of
 this  section.  This  amount shall be called the provider specific state
 share reduction amount for the applicable year.

 ution as follows:
  Distributions  shall  first  be made to consortia and teaching general
 hospitals for the empire clinical research investigator program  (ECRIP)
 to  help  secure federal funding for biomedical research, train clinical
 researchers, recruit national leaders as faculty to act as mentors,  and
 train  residents  and  fellows  in  biomedical  research skills based on
 hospital-specific data submitted to the commissioner  by  consortia  and
 teaching general hospitals in accordance with clause (G) of this subpar-
 agraph.  Such distributions shall be made in accordance with the follow-
 ing methodology:
  (A) The greatest number of clinical research  positions  for  which  a
 consortium  or  teaching general hospital may be funded pursuant to this
 subparagraph shall be one percent  of  the  total  number  of  residents
 training  at  the consortium or teaching general hospital on July first,
 two thousand eight for the  period  January  first,  two  thousand  nine
 through December thirty-first, two thousand nine rounded up to the near-
 est one position.
  (B)  Distributions  made  to a consortium or teaching general hospital
 shall equal the product of the total number of clinical  research  posi-
 tions  submitted  by  a  consortium  or  teaching  general  hospital and
 accepted by the commissioner as meeting the criteria set forth in  para-
 graph  (b)  of subdivision one of this section, subject to the reduction
 calculation set forth in clause (C)  of  this  subparagraph,  times  one
 hundred ten thousand dollars.
  (C)  If  the  dollar  amount for the total number of clinical research
 positions in the region  calculated  pursuant  to  clause  (B)  of  this
 subparagraph  exceeds the total amount appropriated for purposes of this
 S. 4007--C  40  A. 3007--C
 
 paragraph, including clinical research positions that continue from  and
 were funded in prior distribution periods, the commissioner shall elimi-
 nate  one-half  of  the  clinical  research  positions submitted by each
 consortium  or teaching general hospital rounded down to the nearest one
 position. Such reduction shall be repeated until the dollar  amount  for
 the  total  number of clinical research positions in the region does not
 exceed the total amount appropriated for purposes of this paragraph.  If
 the  repeated  reduction  of the total number of clinical research posi-
 tions in the region by one-half does not render a total  funding  amount
 that  is equal to or less than the total amount reserved for that region
 within the appropriation, the funding for each clinical  research  posi-
 tion  in  that  region  shall  be reduced proportionally in one thousand
 dollar increments until the total dollar amount for the total number  of
 clinical  research  positions  in  that region does not exceed the total
 amount reserved for that region within the appropriation. Any  reduction
 in  funding will be effective for the duration of the award. No clinical
 research positions that continue from and were funded in prior  distrib-
 ution periods shall be eliminated or reduced by such methodology.

 subsequent funding cycle.
  (II)  Each  consortium  or  teaching  general hospital with a two-year
 ECRIP award shall receive its first annual distribution amount  in  full
 upon  completion  of the requirements set forth in items (I) and (II) of

  § 4. Section 40 of chapter 266 of the laws of 1986, amending the civil
 practice law and rules  and  other  laws  relating  to  malpractice  and
 professional medical conduct, as amended by section 4 of part Z of chap-
 ter 57 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  §  40.  The superintendent of financial services shall establish rates
 for policies providing coverage  for  physicians  and  surgeons  medical
 malpractice  for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June 30,
 [2023] 2024; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
 of law, the superintendent shall not establish or approve  any  increase
 in  rates  for  the  period  commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
 2010. The superintendent shall direct insurers to  establish  segregated
 accounts  for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income attrib-
 utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
 insurers regarding claims and expenses attributable to such  periods  to
 monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
 and  expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall impose
 a surcharge on premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected  deficiency  that  is
 attributable  to the premium levels established pursuant to this section
 S. 4007--C  102  A. 3007--C
 
 for such periods; provided, however, that such  annual  surcharge  shall
 not  exceed  eight  percent of the established rate until July 1, [2023]
 2024, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
 ty-five  percent  of  the  approved  adequate rate, and that such annual
 surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
 to satisfy such deficiency. The superintendent  shall  not  impose  such
 surcharge  during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
 2010. On and after July  1,  1989,  the  surcharge  prescribed  by  this
 section  shall  be  retained by insurers to the extent that they insured
 physicians and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30,  [2023]
 2024  policy  periods;  in  the  event  and to the extent physicians and
 surgeons were insured by another insurer during such periods, all  or  a
 pro  rata  share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall be remitted
 to such other insurer in accordance with rules  and  regulations  to  be
 promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
 and  surgeons  who  were not insured during such policy periods shall be
 apportioned among all insurers in proportion to the premium  written  by
 each  insurer  during such policy periods; if a physician or surgeon was
 insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
 during such policy periods, and  at  any  time  thereafter  a  hospital,
 health  maintenance organization, employer or institution is responsible
 for responding in damages for liability arising out of such  physician's
 or  surgeon's  practice  of medicine, such responsible entity shall also
 remit to such prior insurer the equivalent amount  that  would  then  be
 collected  as  a  surcharge if the physician or surgeon had continued to
 remain insured by such prior insurer. In  the  event  any  insurer  that
 provided  coverage  during  such  policy  periods is in liquidation, the
 property/casualty insurance security fund shall receive the  portion  of
 surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
 The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
 the  purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The superintendent,
 in establishing adequate rates and in determining  any  projected  defi-
 ciency  pursuant  to  the requirements of this section and the insurance
 law, shall give substantial weight, determined  in  his  discretion  and
 judgment,  to  the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of any regulations
 promulgated and laws enacted and the  public  benefit  of  stabilizing
 malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
 od  of  time  necessary for the development of more reliable statistical
 experience as to the efficacy of such  laws  and  regulations  affecting
 medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
 1986,  by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any provision
 of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
 the superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if  such
 rates  would be adequate when taken together with the maximum authorized
 annual surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time  whether
 or  not  any  such  annual surcharge has been actually imposed as of the
 establishment of such rates.
  § 5. Section 5 and subdivisions (a) and (e) of section 6 of part J  of
 chapter  63  of  the  laws  of 2001, amending chapter 266 of the laws of

  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 12 of section 203 of the elder
 law, as added by section 1 of part U of chapter 57 of the laws of  2019,
 is amended to read as follows:
  (a)  The director is hereby authorized to implement private pay proto-
 cols for programs and services administered by the office. These  proto-
 cols  may  be  implemented by area agencies on aging at their option and
 such protocols shall not be applied to services for a  participant  when
 being  paid for with federal funds or funds designated as federal match,
 or for individuals with an income below [four]  TWO  hundred  AND  FIFTY
 percent  of  the  federal  poverty  level. All private payments received
 directly by an area agency on aging or indirectly by one of its contrac-
 tors shall be used to supplement, not supplant, funds by state, federal,
 or county appropriations. Such private pay payments shall be  set  at  a
 cost to the participant of not more than twenty percent above either the
 unit  cost to the area agency on aging to provide the program or service
 directly, or the amount that the  area  agency  on  aging  pays  to  its
 contractor  to  provide  the  program  or  service. Private pay payments
 received under this subdivision shall be used  by  the  area  agency  on
 S. 4007--C  105  A. 3007--C
 
 aging to first reduce any unmet need for programs and services, and then
 to  support and enhance services or programs provided by the area agency
 on aging. No participant, regardless of income, shall be required to pay
 for  any  program  or  service that they are receiving at the time these
 protocols are implemented by the area agency on aging. This  subdivision
 shall not prevent cost sharing for the programs and services established
 pursuant  to section two hundred fourteen of this title [for individuals
 below four hundred percent of the  federal  poverty  level].  Consistent
 with  federal and state statute and regulations, when providing programs
 and services, area agencies on aging and their contractors shall contin-
 ue to give priority for programs and services to  individuals  with  the
 greatest  economic  or  social  needs. In the event that the capacity to
 provide programs and services is limited,  such  programs  and  services
 shall  be  provided to individuals with incomes below [four] TWO hundred
 AND FIFTY percent of the federal poverty level before such programs  and
 services are provided to those participating in the private pay protocol
 pursuant to this subdivision.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  Section 1.  Legislative findings.  The legislature finds that it is in
 the best interest of the people of this state to expand  article  77  of
 the  insurance law to protect insureds and health care providers against
 the failure or inability of a health or property/casualty insurer  writ-
 ing  health  insurance  to  perform  its  contractual obligations due to
 financial impairment or insolvency.  The  superintendent  of  financial
 services  has  the right and responsibility to enforce the insurance law
 and the authority to seek redress against any person responsible for the
 impairment or insolvency of the insurer, and  nothing  in  this  act  is
 intended to restrict or limit such right, responsibility, or authority.
  § 2.  The article heading of article 77 of the insurance law, as added
 by chapter 802 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:

 gations due to the impairment or insolvency of the insurer issuing  such

 article to enable the guarantee of payment of benefits and of  continua-

 ment to carry out the purposes of this article.

  § 14-a. The superintendent of financial services, in consultation with

 ate, shall be authorized and required to develop  an  assessment  offset
 plan  to limit the impact of the assessments imposed pursuant to section
 7709 of the insurance law on not-for-profit member insurers. Such offset
 shall be comparable, to the extent possible, to the tax credit available
 to for-profit member insurers. The plan shall consider  tax,  assessment
 or  other  credits or financial benefits to offset such assessments in a
 manner that has a comparable impact as the  tax  credits  applicable  to
 for-profit  insurers;  the feasibility of a cap or limit on premium rate
 increases, cost-sharing requirements, or any other surcharges passed  on
 to  policyholders due to the assessments pursuant to section 7709 of the
 insurance law; and any other mechanism that minimizes the costs to poli-
 cyholders while addressing the need to provide relief to  not-for-profit
 member  insurers  subject to article 77 of the insurance law. The super-
 intendent of financial services shall transmit the written plan  to  the
 governor,  the temporary president of the senate, and the speaker of the
 assembly by January 15, 2024,  and  the  superintendent  may  promulgate
 regulations  to  implement such plan for not-for-profit member insurers.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Life  and  Health  Insurance  Company
 Guaranty  Corporation  of  New  York shall not impose any assessments on
 not-for-profit member insurers pursuant to article 77 of  the  insurance
 law until the offset plan has been implemented.
  §  15.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall be deemed to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2023; provided,
 however, that the amendments made by this act shall  not  apply  to  the
 estate  of  an insurer for which a court entered a final order of liqui-
 dation prior to the effective date of this act.
  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of

  PART PP
 
  Section  1.  Subject  to  available appropriation, the commissioner of
 mental  health  shall  establish  a  maternal  mental  health  workgroup
 (referred  to  in  this section as the "workgroup") within the office of
 mental health. The workgroup shall  consist  of,  at  the  minimum,  the
 commissioner of mental health or their designee, the commissioner of the
 office  of  children  and family services or their designee; the commis-
 sioner of the department of health  or  their  designee;  and  represen-
 tatives from statewide mental health organizations, maternal health care
 provider  organizations,  health care provider organizations, the health
 insurance industry, and communities that are disproportionately impacted
 by the underdiagnoses of maternal mental health disorders; and any addi-
 tional stakeholders that the commissioners deem necessary.
  § 2.  Workgroup  members  shall  receive  no  compensation  for  their
 services as members of the workgroup, but shall be reimbursed for actual
 expenses  incurred in the performance of their duties on the work group.
 To allow members who represent communities  disproportionately  impacted
 by  the  underdiagnoses  of  maternal  mental  health disorder to wholly
 participate in the performance of their duties on the  workgroup,  their
 reimbursement  may  include,  but  not be limited to, childcare, travel,
 meals and lodging.
  § 3. It shall be the duty of the workgroup to study and  issue  recom-
 mendations  related to maternal mental health and perinatal and postpar-
 tum mood and anxiety disorders. The workgroup shall:
  a. identify  underrepresented  and  vulnerable  populations  and  risk
 factors in the state for maternal mental health disorders that may occur
 during pregnancy and through the first postpartum year;
  b.  identify and recommend effective, culturally competent, and acces-
 sible screening and identification, and prevention and treatment strate-
 gies, including  public  education  and  workplace  awareness,  provider
 education and training, and social support services;
  c.  identify  successful postpartum and perinatal mental health initi-
 atives in other states and recommend programs,  tools,  strategies,  and
 funding  sources that are needed to implement similar initiatives in the
 state;
  d. identify and recommend evidence-based  practices  for  health  care
 providers and public health systems;
  e. identify and recommend private and public funding models;
  f.  make  recommendations  on legislation, policy initiatives, funding
 requirements and budgetary priorities to address maternal mental  health
 needs in the state;
  g. any other relevant issues identified by the workgroup; and
  h.  submit  a final report containing all findings and recommendations
 to the governor, the temporary president of the senate, the  speaker  of
 the assembly, the commissioner of mental health, the commissioner of the
 office  of children and family services, the commissioner of the depart-
 ment of health, the minority leader of the senate and the minority lead-
 er of the assembly on or before December 31, 2024.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire two years
 after such effective date when upon such date the provisions of this act
 shall be deemed repealed.
  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,

 S. 4007--C  185  A. 3007--C

 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately  provided,  however,  that
 the applicable effective date of Parts A through PP of this act shall be
