 percentage.  The  medicaid revenue reduction percentages for 1997, 1998,
 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,  2011,

 downstate region;
  (ii)  six-tenths  of one percentage point for CHHAs located within the
 upstate region;
  (iii) one and eight-tenths percentage points for LTHHCPs located with-
 in the downstate region; and
  (iv) one and seven-tenths percentage points for LTHHCPs located within

 age shall  be  calculated  by  subtracting  the  1999  medicaid  revenue
 reduction  percentage  from the base period medicaid revenue percentage.
 A. 3007--B  13
 
 The 1999 medicaid revenue reduction  percentages,  taking  into  account
 regional and program differences in utilization of medicaid and medicare
 services, for the following regional groups shall be equal to:
  (i)  eight  hundred  twenty-five  thousandths (.825) of one percentage
 point for CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii) forty-five hundredths (.45) of one  percentage  point  for  CHHAs

  5.  (a) For each regional group, if the 1996 medicaid revenue percent-
 age is not equal to or  less  than  the  1996  target  medicaid  revenue
 percentage,  the  commissioner of health shall compare the 1996 medicaid
 revenue percentage to the 1996 target  medicaid  revenue  percentage  to
 determine  the  amount  of the shortfall which, when divided by the 1996
 medicaid  revenue  reduction  percentage,  shall  be  called  the  1996
 reduction  factor.  These  amounts, expressed as a percentage, shall not
 exceed one hundred percent. If the 1996 medicaid revenue  percentage  is
 equal  to  or less than the 1996 target medicaid revenue percentage, the
 1996 reduction factor shall be zero.
  (b) For 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003,  2004,  2005,  2006,

 regional  group,  if  the medicaid revenue percentage for the respective
 year is not equal to or less than the target medicaid revenue percentage
 for such respective year, the commissioner of health shall compare  such
 respective  year's medicaid revenue percentage to such respective year's
 target medicaid revenue percentage to determine the amount of the short-
 fall which, when divided  by  the  respective  year's  medicaid  revenue
 reduction  percentage,  shall  be  called  the reduction factor for such
 respective year. These amounts, expressed as  a  percentage,  shall  not
 exceed  one  hundred  percent.  If the medicaid revenue percentage for a
 particular year is equal to or less than  the  target  medicaid  revenue
 percentage  for  that  year, the reduction factor for that year shall be
 zero.
  6. (a) For each regional group, the 1996  reduction  factor  shall  be
 multiplied  by  the following amounts to determine each regional group's
 applicable 1996 state share reduction amount:
  (i) two million three hundred ninety thousand dollars ($2,390,000) for
 CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii) seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) for CHHAs located

 for LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv)  five  hundred  ninety  thousand  dollars  ($590,000) for LTHHCPs
 located within the upstate region.
  For each regional group reduction, if the 1996 reduction factor  shall
 be zero, there shall be no 1996 state share reduction amount.
  (b)  For  1997,  1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007,

 2020,  2021,  2022  [and],  2023,  2024,  2025,  2026 AND 2027, for each
 regional group, the reduction factor for the respective  year  shall  be
 multiplied  by  the following amounts to determine each regional group's
 applicable state share reduction amount for such respective year:
 A. 3007--B  14
 
  (i) two million three hundred ninety thousand dollars ($2,390,000) for
 CHHAs located within the downstate region;

 of this section to be allocated regionally with two-thirds of the avail-
 able funding going to New York city and one-third of the available fund-
 ing going to the rest of the state and shall be available  for  distrib-
 ution as follows:
  Distributions  shall  first  be made to consortia and teaching general
 hospitals for the empire clinical research investigator program  (ECRIP)
 to  help  secure federal funding for biomedical research, train clinical
 researchers, recruit national leaders as faculty to act as mentors,  and
 train  residents  and  fellows  in  biomedical  research skills based on
 hospital-specific data submitted to the commissioner  by  consortia  and
 teaching general hospitals in accordance with clause (G) of this subpar-
 agraph.  Such distributions shall be made in accordance with the follow-
 ing methodology:
  (A) The greatest number of clinical research  positions  for  which  a
 consortium  or  teaching general hospital may be funded pursuant to this
 subparagraph shall be one percent  of  the  total  number  of  residents
 training  at  the consortium or teaching general hospital on July first,
 two thousand eight for the  period  January  first,  two  thousand  nine
 through December thirty-first, two thousand nine rounded up to the near-
 est one position.
  (B)  Distributions  made  to a consortium or teaching general hospital
 shall equal the product of the total number of clinical  research  posi-
 tions  submitted  by  a  consortium  or  teaching  general  hospital and
 accepted by the commissioner as meeting the criteria set forth in  para-
 graph  (b)  of subdivision one of this section, subject to the reduction
 calculation set forth in clause (C)  of  this  subparagraph,  times  one
 hundred ten thousand dollars.
  (C)  If  the  dollar  amount for the total number of clinical research
 positions in the region  calculated  pursuant  to  clause  (B)  of  this
 subparagraph  exceeds the total amount appropriated for purposes of this
 A. 3007--B  39
 
 paragraph, including clinical research positions that continue from  and
 were funded in prior distribution periods, the commissioner shall elimi-
 nate  one-half  of  the  clinical  research  positions submitted by each
 consortium  or teaching general hospital rounded down to the nearest one
 position. Such reduction shall be repeated until the dollar  amount  for
 the  total  number of clinical research positions in the region does not
 exceed the total amount appropriated for purposes of this paragraph.  If
 the  repeated  reduction  of the total number of clinical research posi-
 tions in the region by one-half does not render a total  funding  amount
 that  is equal to or less than the total amount reserved for that region
 within the appropriation, the funding for each clinical  research  posi-
 tion  in  that  region  shall  be reduced proportionally in one thousand
 dollar increments until the total dollar amount for the total number  of
 clinical  research  positions  in  that region does not exceed the total
 amount reserved for that region within the appropriation. Any  reduction
 in  funding will be effective for the duration of the award. No clinical
 research positions that continue from and were funded in prior  distrib-
 ution periods shall be eliminated or reduced by such methodology.
  (D)  Each  consortium  or  teaching general hospital shall receive its
 annual distribution amount in accordance with the following:
  (I) Each consortium or teaching general hospital with a one-year ECRIP
 award  shall  receive  its  annual  distribution  amount  in  full  upon
 completion of the requirements set forth in items (I) and (II) of clause
 (G)  of  this subparagraph. The requirements set forth in items (IV) and

 tium  or teaching general hospital in order for the consortium or teach-
 ing general hospital to be eligible to apply for ECRIP  funding  in  any
 subsequent funding cycle.
  (II)  Each  consortium  or  teaching  general hospital with a two-year
 ECRIP award shall receive its first annual distribution amount  in  full
 upon  completion  of the requirements set forth in items (I) and (II) of
 clause (G) of this subparagraph. Each  consortium  or  teaching  general
 hospital will receive its second annual distribution amount in full upon
 completion  of the requirements set forth in item (III) of clause (G) of

 cable medicaid rates in effect January first of the  distribution  year,
 as summed and adjusted by a statewide cost adjustment factor and reduced

 inpatient days paid by Medicaid.
  (iii) For calendar years two  thousand  twenty  through  two  thousand

 for such periods; provided, however, that such  annual  surcharge  shall
 not  exceed  eight  percent of the established rate until July 1, [2023]
 2024, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
 ty-five percent of the approved adequate  rate,  and  that  such  annual
 surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
 to  satisfy  such  deficiency.  The superintendent shall not impose such
 surcharge during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June  30,
 2010.  On  and  after  July  1,  1989,  the surcharge prescribed by this
 section shall be retained by insurers to the extent  that  they  insured
 physicians  and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30, [2023]
 2024 policy periods; in the event  and  to  the  extent  physicians  and
 surgeons  were  insured by another insurer during such periods, all or a
 pro rata share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall  be  remitted
 to  such  other  insurer  in accordance with rules and regulations to be
 promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
 and surgeons who were not insured during such policy  periods  shall  be
 apportioned  among  all insurers in proportion to the premium written by
 each insurer during such policy periods; if a physician or  surgeon  was
 insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
 during  such  policy  periods,  and  at  any time thereafter a hospital,
 health maintenance organization, employer or institution is  responsible
 for  responding in damages for liability arising out of such physician's
 or surgeon's practice of medicine, such responsible  entity  shall  also
 A. 3007--B  99
 
 remit  to  such  prior  insurer the equivalent amount that would then be
 collected as a surcharge if the physician or surgeon  had  continued  to
 remain  insured  by  such  prior  insurer. In the event any insurer that
 provided  coverage  during  such  policy  periods is in liquidation, the
 property/casualty insurance security fund shall receive the  portion  of
 surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
 The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
 the  purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The superintendent,
 in establishing adequate rates and in determining  any  projected  defi-
 ciency  pursuant  to  the requirements of this section and the insurance
 law, shall give substantial weight, determined  in  his  discretion  and
 judgment,  to  the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of any regulations
 promulgated and laws enacted and the  public  benefit  of  stabilizing
 malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
 od  of  time  necessary for the development of more reliable statistical
 experience as to the efficacy of such  laws  and  regulations  affecting
 medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
 1986,  by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any provision
 of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
 the superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if  such
 rates  would be adequate when taken together with the maximum authorized
 annual surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time  whether
 or  not  any  such  annual surcharge has been actually imposed as of the
 establishment of such rates.

  SUBPART D
 
  Section 1.  Legislative findings.  The legislature finds that it is in
 the  best  interest  of the people of this state to expand article 77 of
 the insurance law to protect insureds and health care providers  against
 the  failure or inability of a health or property/casualty insurer writ-
 ing health insurance to  perform  its  contractual  obligations  due  to
 A. 3007--B  121
 
 financial  impairment  or  insolvency.  The superintendent of financial
 services has the right and responsibility to enforce the  insurance  law
 and the authority to seek redress against any person responsible for the
 impairment  or  insolvency  of  the  insurer, and nothing in this act is
 intended to restrict or limit such right, responsibility, or authority.
  § 2.  The article heading of article 77 of the insurance law, as added
 by chapter 802 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  THE LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY
  GUARANTY CORPORATION
  OF NEW YORK ACT
  § 3. Section 7701 of the insurance law, as added by chapter 802 of the

 COMPANIES, AND PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, subject to certain
 limitations, against failure in the  performance  of  contractual  obli-
 gations  due to the impairment or insolvency of the insurer issuing such
 policies, contracts, or funding  agreements.  In  the  judgment  of  the
 legislature,  the  foregoing  objects  and purposes not being capable of
 accomplishment by a corporation created under general laws, the creation
 of a not-for-profit corporation of insurers  is  provided  for  by  this
 article  to enable the guarantee of payment of benefits and of continua-
 tion of coverages, and members of the corporation are subject to assess-
 ment to carry out the purposes of this article.

 policy, contract, or funding agreement was issued  or  on  the  date  of
 entry  of a court order of liquidation or rehabilitation with respect to
 such a company that is an impaired or insolvent insurer, as the case may
 be.

 ing agreement and in each case who:

 following conditions:
  (I) the insurer that issued the  policy,  contract,  or  agreement  is
 domiciled in this state;
  (II)  the  state  or  states in which the person resides has or have a
 guaranty entity similar to the corporation created by this article; and
 A. 3007--B  122
 
  (III) the person is not eligible for coverage by a guaranty entity  in
 any  other  state  because the insurer was not licensed or authorized in
 that state at the time specified in that state's  guaranty  entity  law;

  (B)  the  beneficiary,  assignee,  or payee of the person specified in
 subparagraph (A) of this  paragraph,  regardless  of  where  the  person

 if  the  superintendent finds that the premiums are unreasonable, exces-
 sive, inadequate, [or] unfairly discriminatory, [and]  OR  VIOLATES  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  SUBSECTION  (G)  OF SECTION SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED
 NINE OF THIS CHAPTER. THE  SUPERINTENDENT  may  consider  the  financial
 condition of the corporation in approving, modifying or disapproving any
 premium  adjustment.  The  determination  of the superintendent shall be
 supported by sound actuarial  assumptions  and  methods,  and  shall  be
 rendered in writing between thirty and sixty days from the date the rate
 filing  or  application  is  submitted to the superintendent. Should the
