  (ii) six-tenths of one percentage point for CHHAs located  within  the
 upstate region;
  (iii) one and eight-tenths percentage points for LTHHCPs located with-
 in the downstate region; and
  (iv) one and seven-tenths percentage points for LTHHCPs located within
 the upstate region.
  (c) For each regional group, the 1999 target medicaid revenue percent-
 age  shall  be  calculated  by  subtracting  the  1999  medicaid revenue
 reduction percentage from the base period medicaid  revenue  percentage.
 The  1999  medicaid  revenue  reduction percentages, taking into account
 regional and program differences in utilization of medicaid and medicare
 services, for the following regional groups shall be equal to:
  (i) eight hundred twenty-five thousandths  (.825)  of  one  percentage
 point for CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii)  forty-five  hundredths  (.45)  of one percentage point for CHHAs
 located within the upstate region;
  (iii) one and thirty-five  hundredths  percentage  points  (1.35)  for
 LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv)  one  and  two hundred seventy-five thousandths percentage points
 (1.275) for LTHHCPs located within the upstate region.
  5. (a) For each regional group, if the 1996 medicaid revenue  percent-
 age  is  not  equal  to  or  less  than the 1996 target medicaid revenue
 percentage, the commissioner of health shall compare the  1996  medicaid
 revenue  percentage  to  the  1996 target medicaid revenue percentage to
 determine the amount of the shortfall which, when divided  by  the  1996
 medicaid  revenue  reduction  percentage,  shall  be  called  the  1996
 reduction factor. These amounts, expressed as a  percentage,  shall  not
 exceed  one  hundred percent. If the 1996 medicaid revenue percentage is
 equal to or less than the 1996 target medicaid revenue  percentage,  the
 1996 reduction factor shall be zero.
  (b)  For  1997,  1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006,

 regional group, if the medicaid revenue percentage  for  the  respective
 year is not equal to or less than the target medicaid revenue percentage
 for  such respective year, the commissioner of health shall compare such
 respective year's medicaid revenue percentage to such respective  year's
 target medicaid revenue percentage to determine the amount of the short-
 fall  which,  when  divided  by  the  respective year's medicaid revenue
 reduction percentage, shall be called  the  reduction  factor  for  such
 respective  year.  These  amounts,  expressed as a percentage, shall not
 exceed one hundred percent. If the medicaid  revenue  percentage  for  a
 S. 4007--A  15  A. 3007--A
 
 particular  year  is  equal  to or less than the target medicaid revenue
 percentage for that year, the reduction factor for that  year  shall  be
 zero.
  6.  (a)  For  each  regional group, the 1996 reduction factor shall be
 multiplied by the following amounts to determine each  regional  group's
 applicable 1996 state share reduction amount:
  (i) two million three hundred ninety thousand dollars ($2,390,000) for
 CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii) seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) for CHHAs located
 within the upstate region;

 for LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv) five hundred  ninety  thousand  dollars  ($590,000)  for  LTHHCPs
 located within the upstate region.
  For  each regional group reduction, if the 1996 reduction factor shall
 be zero, there shall be no 1996 state share reduction amount.
  (b) For 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004,  2005,  2006,  2007,

 2020, 2021, 2022 [and], 2023,  2024,  2025,  2026  AND  2027,  for  each
 regional  group,  the  reduction factor for the respective year shall be
 multiplied by the following amounts to determine each  regional  group's
 applicable state share reduction amount for such respective year:
  (i) two million three hundred ninety thousand dollars ($2,390,000) for
 CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii) seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) for CHHAs located
 within the upstate region;

 for LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv) five hundred  ninety  thousand  dollars  ($590,000)  for  LTHHCPs
 located within the upstate region.
  For  each  regional  group  reduction,  if  the reduction factor for a
 particular year shall be zero, there shall be no state  share  reduction
 amount for such year.
  (c) For each regional group, the 1999 reduction factor shall be multi-
 plied by the following amounts to determine each regional group's appli-
 cable 1999 state share reduction amount:
  (i) one million seven hundred ninety-two thousand five hundred dollars
 ($1,792,500) for CHHAs located within the downstate region;
  (ii)  five  hundred sixty-two thousand five hundred dollars ($562,500)
 for CHHAs located within the upstate region;

 for LTHHCPs located within the downstate region; and
  (iv)  four  hundred forty-two thousand five hundred dollars ($442,500)
 for LTHHCPs located within the upstate region.
  For each regional group reduction, if the 1999 reduction factor  shall
 be zero, there shall be no 1999 state share reduction amount.
  7.  (a) For each regional group, the 1996 state share reduction amount
 shall be allocated by the commissioner of health among CHHAs and LTHHCPs
 on the basis of the extent  of  each  CHHA's  and  LTHHCP's  failure  to
 achieve  the  1996  target  medicaid revenue percentage, calculated on a
 provider specific basis utilizing revenues for this  purpose,  expressed
 as  a  proportion  of  the  total of each CHHA's and LTHHCP's failure to
 achieve the 1996 target medicaid revenue percentage within the  applica-
 ble  regional group. This proportion shall be multiplied by the applica-
 ble 1996 state share reduction amount calculation pursuant to  paragraph
 S. 4007--A  16  A. 3007--A

 (a)  of  subdivision  6 of this section. This amount shall be called the

 on the basis of the extent  of  each  CHHA's  and  LTHHCP's  failure  to
 achieve  the target medicaid revenue percentage for the applicable year,
 calculated on a provider specific  basis  utilizing  revenues  for  this
 purpose,  expressed  as  a  proportion  of  the total of each CHHA's and
 LTHHCP's failure to achieve the target medicaid revenue  percentage  for
 the  applicable  year within the applicable regional group. This propor-
 tion shall be multiplied by the applicable year's state share  reduction
 amount  calculation pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of subdivision 6 of
 this section. This amount shall be called the  provider  specific  state
 share reduction amount for the applicable year.
  8.  (a)  The 1996 provider specific state share reduction amount shall

 ution as follows:
  Distributions  shall  first  be made to consortia and teaching general
 hospitals for the empire clinical research investigator program  (ECRIP)
 to  help  secure federal funding for biomedical research, train clinical
 researchers, recruit national leaders as faculty to act as mentors,  and
 train  residents  and  fellows  in  biomedical  research skills based on
 hospital-specific data submitted to the commissioner  by  consortia  and
 teaching general hospitals in accordance with clause (G) of this subpar-
 S. 4007--A  40  A. 3007--A
 
 agraph.  Such distributions shall be made in accordance with the follow-
 ing methodology:
  (A)  The  greatest  number  of clinical research positions for which a
 consortium or teaching general hospital may be funded pursuant  to  this
 subparagraph  shall  be  one  percent  of  the total number of residents
 training at the consortium or teaching general hospital on  July  first,
 two  thousand  eight  for  the  period  January first, two thousand nine
 through December thirty-first, two thousand nine rounded up to the near-
 est one position.
  (B) Distributions made to a consortium or  teaching  general  hospital
 shall  equal  the product of the total number of clinical research posi-
 tions submitted  by  a  consortium  or  teaching  general  hospital  and
 accepted  by the commissioner as meeting the criteria set forth in para-
 graph (b) of subdivision one of this section, subject to  the  reduction
 calculation  set  forth  in  clause  (C) of this subparagraph, times one
 hundred ten thousand dollars.
  (C) If the dollar amount for the total  number  of  clinical  research
 positions  in  the  region  calculated  pursuant  to  clause (B) of this
 subparagraph exceeds the total amount appropriated for purposes of  this
 paragraph,  including clinical research positions that continue from and
 were funded in prior distribution periods, the commissioner shall elimi-
 nate one-half of the  clinical  research  positions  submitted  by  each
 consortium  or teaching general hospital rounded down to the nearest one
 position. Such reduction shall be repeated until the dollar  amount  for
 the  total  number of clinical research positions in the region does not
 exceed the total amount appropriated for purposes of this paragraph.  If
 the  repeated  reduction  of the total number of clinical research posi-
 tions in the region by one-half does not render a total  funding  amount
 that  is equal to or less than the total amount reserved for that region
 within the appropriation, the funding for each clinical  research  posi-
 tion  in  that  region  shall  be reduced proportionally in one thousand
 dollar increments until the total dollar amount for the total number  of
 clinical  research  positions  in  that region does not exceed the total
 amount reserved for that region within the appropriation. Any  reduction
 in  funding will be effective for the duration of the award. No clinical
 research positions that continue from and were funded in prior  distrib-
 ution periods shall be eliminated or reduced by such methodology.
  (D)  Each  consortium  or  teaching general hospital shall receive its
 annual distribution amount in accordance with the following:
  (I) Each consortium or teaching general hospital with a one-year ECRIP
 award  shall  receive  its  annual  distribution  amount  in  full  upon

 subsequent funding cycle.
  (II)  Each  consortium  or  teaching  general hospital with a two-year
 ECRIP award shall receive its first annual distribution amount  in  full

 funding cycle.
  (E)  Each  consortium  or teaching general hospital receiving distrib-
 utions pursuant to this subparagraph shall reserve seventy-five thousand
 dollars to primarily fund salary and fringe  benefits  of  the  clinical
 research  position  with  the remainder going to fund the development of
 faculty who are involved in biomedical research, training  and  clinical
 care.
  (F)  Undistributed  or  returned  funds  available  to  fund  clinical
 research positions pursuant to this paragraph for a distribution  period
 shall  be  available to fund clinical research positions in a subsequent

  § 4. Section 40 of chapter 266 of the laws of 1986, amending the civil
 practice law and rules  and  other  laws  relating  to  malpractice  and
 professional medical conduct, as amended by section 4 of part Z of chap-
 ter 57 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  §  40.  The superintendent of financial services shall establish rates
 for policies providing coverage  for  physicians  and  surgeons  medical
 malpractice  for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June 30,
 [2023] 2024; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision
 of law, the superintendent shall not establish or approve  any  increase
 in  rates  for  the  period  commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June 30,
 2010. The superintendent shall direct insurers to  establish  segregated
 accounts  for premiums, payments, reserves and investment income attrib-
 utable to such premium periods and shall require periodic reports by the
 insurers regarding claims and expenses attributable to such  periods  to
 monitor whether such accounts will be sufficient to meet incurred claims
 and  expenses. On or after July 1, 1989, the superintendent shall impose
 a surcharge on premiums  to  satisfy  a  projected  deficiency  that  is
 attributable  to the premium levels established pursuant to this section
 for such periods; provided, however, that such  annual  surcharge  shall
 not  exceed  eight  percent of the established rate until July 1, [2023]
 2024, at which time and thereafter such surcharge shall not exceed twen-
 ty-five percent of the approved adequate  rate,  and  that  such  annual
 surcharges shall continue for such period of time as shall be sufficient
 to  satisfy  such  deficiency.  The superintendent shall not impose such
 surcharge during the period commencing July 1, 2009 and ending June  30,
 2010.  On  and  after  July  1,  1989,  the surcharge prescribed by this
 section shall be retained by insurers to the extent  that  they  insured
 physicians  and surgeons during the July 1, 1985 through June 30, [2023]
 2024 policy periods; in the event  and  to  the  extent  physicians  and
 S. 4007--A  102  A. 3007--A
 
 surgeons  were  insured by another insurer during such periods, all or a
 pro rata share of the surcharge, as the case may be, shall  be  remitted
 to  such  other  insurer  in accordance with rules and regulations to be
 promulgated by the superintendent.  Surcharges collected from physicians
 and  surgeons  who  were not insured during such policy periods shall be
 apportioned among all insurers in proportion to the premium  written  by
 each  insurer  during such policy periods; if a physician or surgeon was
 insured by an insurer subject to rates established by the superintendent
 during such policy periods, and  at  any  time  thereafter  a  hospital,
 health  maintenance organization, employer or institution is responsible
 for responding in damages for liability arising out of such  physician's
 or  surgeon's  practice  of medicine, such responsible entity shall also
 remit to such prior insurer the equivalent amount  that  would  then  be
 collected  as  a  surcharge if the physician or surgeon had continued to
 remain insured by such prior insurer. In  the  event  any  insurer  that
 provided  coverage  during  such  policy  periods is in liquidation, the
 property/casualty insurance security fund shall receive the  portion  of
 surcharges to which the insurer in liquidation would have been entitled.
 The surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned for
 the  purposes of section 2303 of the insurance law.  The superintendent,
 in establishing adequate rates and in determining  any  projected  defi-
 ciency  pursuant  to  the requirements of this section and the insurance
 law, shall give substantial weight, determined  in  his  discretion  and
 judgment,  to  the  prospective  anticipated  effect  of any regulations
 promulgated and laws enacted and the  public  benefit  of  stabilizing
 malpractice rates and minimizing rate level fluctuation during the peri-
 od  of  time  necessary for the development of more reliable statistical
 experience as to the efficacy of such  laws  and  regulations  affecting
 medical, dental or podiatric malpractice enacted or promulgated in 1985,
 1986,  by this act and at any other time.  Notwithstanding any provision
 of the insurance law, rates already established and to be established by
 the superintendent pursuant to this section are deemed adequate if  such
 rates  would be adequate when taken together with the maximum authorized
 annual surcharges to be imposed for a reasonable period of time  whether
 or  not  any  such  annual surcharge has been actually imposed as of the
 establishment of such rates.
  § 5. Section 5 and subdivisions (a) and (e) of section 6 of part J  of
 chapter  63  of  the  laws  of 2001, amending chapter 266 of the laws of
 1986, amending the civil practice law and rules and other laws  relating
 to malpractice and professional medical conduct, as amended by section 5

  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 12 of section 203 of the elder
 law,  as added by section 1 of part U of chapter 57 of the laws of 2019,
 is amended to read as follows:
  (a) The director is hereby authorized to implement private pay  proto-
 cols  for programs and services administered by the office. These proto-
 cols may be implemented by area agencies on aging at  their  option  and
 such  protocols  shall not be applied to services for a participant when
 being paid for with federal funds or funds designated as federal  match,
 or  for  individuals  with  an income below [four] TWO hundred AND FIFTY
 percent of the federal poverty  level.  All  private  payments  received
 directly by an area agency on aging or indirectly by one of its contrac-
 tors shall be used to supplement, not supplant, funds by state, federal,
 or  county  appropriations.  Such private pay payments shall be set at a
 cost to the participant of not more than twenty percent above either the
 unit cost to the area agency on aging to provide the program or  service
 directly,  or  the  amount  that  the  area  agency on aging pays to its
 contractor to provide the  program  or  service.  Private  pay  payments
 received  under  this  subdivision  shall  be used by the area agency on
 aging to first reduce any unmet need for programs and services, and then
 to support and enhance services or programs provided by the area  agency
 on aging. No participant, regardless of income, shall be required to pay
 for  any  program  or  service that they are receiving at the time these
 protocols are implemented by the area agency on aging. This  subdivision
 shall not prevent cost sharing for the programs and services established
 pursuant  to section two hundred fourteen of this title [for individuals
 below four hundred percent of the  federal  poverty  level].  Consistent
 with  federal and state statute and regulations, when providing programs
 and services, area agencies on aging and their contractors shall contin-
 ue to give priority for programs and services to  individuals  with  the
 S. 4007--A  105  A. 3007--A
 
 greatest  economic  or  social  needs. In the event that the capacity to
 provide programs and services is limited,  such  programs  and  services
 shall  be  provided to individuals with incomes below [four] TWO hundred
 AND  FIFTY percent of the federal poverty level before such programs and
 services are provided to those participating in the private pay protocol
 pursuant to this subdivision.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

 SEVEN OF THIS CHAPTER OR ARTICLE FORTY-FOUR OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW  TO
 PAY  SUCH  A  CLAIM  IS  CLEAR,  EXCEPT FOR THE DESIRE OF THE INSURER OR
 ORGANIZATION OR CORPORATION TO REVIEW CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION OR, TO  THE
 EXTENT  AGREED  UPON  BY  A  HOSPITAL AND THE INSURER OR ORGANIZATION OR
 CORPORATION, ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, TO CONFIRM THE MEDICAL NECESSI-
 TY OF EMERGENCY SERVICES OR INPATIENT SERVICES  FOLLOWING  AN  EMERGENCY
 DEPARTMENT  VISIT  PROVIDED  BY  A  HOSPITAL  THAT PARTICIPATES IN THE
 NETWORK OF THE INSURER OR ORGANIZATION OR  CORPORATION,  WHICH  INCLUDES
 WHETHER  THE  SERVICES PROVIDED WERE EMERGENCY SERVICES OR THAT THE SITE
 OF SERVICE OR LEVEL OF CARE BILLED  WAS  APPROPRIATE  FOR  THE  SERVICES
 PROVIDED, THE INSURER OR ORGANIZATION OR CORPORATION SHALL PAY THE CLAIM
 AT  THE CONTRACTED RATE FOR THE SERVICES AND SITE BILLED BY THE HOSPITAL
 WITHIN THE TIMEFRAMES SET FORTH IN THIS  SUBSECTION.  THE  INSURER  OR
 ORGANIZATION OR CORPORATION MAY, WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF PAYING THE CLAIM,
 REQUEST  THAT  THE  HOSPITAL  SUBMIT  TO  THE INSURER OR ORGANIZATION OR
 CORPORATION ONLY THE CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION OR,  TO  THE  EXTENT  AGREED
 UPON  BY  THE  HOSPITAL  AND THE INSURER OR ORGANIZATION OR CORPORATION,

 WERE  NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY BY THE JOINT COMMITTEE, WHICH SHALL NOT BE
 SUBJECT TO REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE FORTY-NINE OF THIS CHAPTER  AND  ARTICLE
 FORTY-NINE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW.
  (A)  IN  THE  EVENT A JOINT DETERMINATION CANNOT BE AGREED UPON WITHIN

 BEEN CERTIFIED  BY THE SUPERINTENDENT AS AN EXTERNAL APPEAL AGENT PURSU-
 ANT  TO  ARTICLE FORTY-NINE OF THIS CHAPTER OR AS AN INDEPENDENT DISPUTE
 RESOLUTION ENTITY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SIX OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES LAW.

 TIME  AS  THERE  IS  A FINAL DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE SERVICES IN
 QUESTION WERE MEDICALLY NECESSARY. THE HOSPITAL MAY THEREAFTER BILL  THE
 INSURED  FOR  THE AMOUNT OF THE COPAYMENT, COINSURANCE OR DEDUCTIBLE FOR
 SERVICES DETERMINED TO BE MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND SHALL HOLD THE INSURED
 HARMLESS FOR ANY OTHER AMOUNTS, INCLUDING AMOUNTS  FOR  SERVICES  DETER-
 MINED TO BE NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY.
  (4) NOTHING IN THIS SUBSECTION SHALL IN ANY WAY BE DEEMED TO LIMIT THE
 ABILITY  OF  INSURERS  OR ORGANIZATIONS OR CORPORATIONS AND HOSPITALS TO
 AGREE TO ESTABLISH PARAMETERS FOR REFERRAL OR REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS,
 INCLUDING WHILE THE INSURED IS IN  THE  HOSPITAL,  OR  FOR  INSURERS  OR
 ORGANIZATIONS  OR  CORPORATIONS TO REQUIRE PREAUTHORIZATION FOR SERVICES
 THAT ARE NOT EMERGENCY SERVICES.
  (5) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SUBSECTION, "HOSPITAL" SHALL MEAN  A  GENERAL
 HOSPITAL  AS  DEFINED  IN  SECTION TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED ONE OF THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH LAW AND RURAL EMERGENCY HOSPITALS AS  DEFINED  BY  42  USC
 1395X(KKK).
 S. 4007--A  126  A. 3007--A
 
  (6)  NOTHING IN THIS SUBSECTION SHALL PRECLUDE AN INSURER OR ORGANIZA-
 TION OR CORPORATION AND A HOSPITAL FROM AGREEING TO OTHER DISPUTE RESOL-
 UTION MECHANISMS, PROVIDED THAT THE PARTIES MAY NOT NEGOTIATE  AWAY  THE
 REQUIREMENT  THAT  THE  INSURER  OR  ORGANIZATION OR CORPORATION PAY THE
 CLAIM  AS  BILLED  BY  THE  HOSPITAL  PRIOR  TO REVIEWING SUCH CLAIM FOR
 MEDICAL NECESSITY. WHEN A HOSPITAL AND AN  INSURER  OR  ORGANIZATION  OR
 CORPORATION ARE PARTIES TO A PARTICIPATING PROVIDER AGREEMENT APPLICABLE
 TO  THE INPATIENT HOSPITAL ADMISSION BEING REVIEWED BY THE JOINT COMMIT-
 TEE, THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY SET FORTH IN SUCH PARTICIPATING
 PROVIDER AGREEMENT SHALL APPLY FOR PURPOSES OF JOINT COMMITTEE AND INDE-
 PENDENT THIRD-PARTY REVIEW.

  § 5. The public health law is amended by adding a new article 45-A  to
 read as follows:
  ARTICLE 45-A
  REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS
 SECTION 4550. LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND INTENT.
  4551. DEFINITIONS.
  4552. REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS.
  4553. NOTICE OF MATERIAL TRANSACTION; REQUIREMENTS.
  4554. MATERIAL TRANSACTION REVIEW.
  4555. PENALTY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
  4556. RULES AND REGULATIONS.
  4557. SEPARABILITY.
  §  4550.  LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND INTENT. WHILE HOSPITALS REMAIN VITAL
 TO THE HEALTH SYSTEM, SERVICES ARE INCREASINGLY BEING DELIVERED  THROUGH
 AMBULATORY  CARE.  THIS  SHIFT  TO AMBULATORY CARE IS GIVING RISE TO NEW
 HEALTH CARE DELIVERY STRUCTURES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME FACILI-
 TY LICENSURE AND OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS. IN PARTICULAR, THERE HAS BEEN A
 PROLIFERATION OF LARGE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES  BEING  MANAGED  BY  ENTITIES
 THAT  ARE  INVESTOR-BACKED. AS A GENERAL MATTER, PHYSICIAN PRACTICES ARE
 SUBJECT TO FAR LESS REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT THAN HOSPITALS UNDER  ARTI-
 CLE TWENTY-EIGHT OF THIS CHAPTER, HOME CARE AGENCIES UNDER ARTICLE THIR-
 TY-SIX  OF  THIS  CHAPTER, HOSPICE PROVIDERS, OR PROVIDERS OF BEHAVIORAL
 HEALTH SERVICES UNDER ARTICLES THIRTY-ONE AND THIRTY-TWO OF  THE  MENTAL
 HYGIENE  LAW,  AS  WELL  AS MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER INSURERS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS CHAPTER OR THE INSURANCE LAW. EVEN AS THESE  INVE-
 STOR-BACKED ENTITIES INCREASINGLY TAKE ON THE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED
 WITH DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT CENTERS UNDER ARTICLE TWENTY-EIGHT OF THIS
 CHAPTER  OR  OTHER LICENSED PROVIDER TYPES, OR MAY ASSUME MORE RISK FROM
 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND LICENSED INSURERS,  THEY  REMAIN  UNREGU-
 LATED  BY  THE  STATE OUTSIDE OF THE LICENSURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PRACTI-
 TIONERS WHO PRACTICE AT THESE SITES AND ENROLLMENT  IN  MEDICAID.  MORE-
 OVER, TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE CHANGE OF CONTROL, BY VIRTUE OF A SALE,
 MERGER  OR  ACQUISITION OF THESE PROVIDERS, ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY STATE
 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL REVIEW, SUCH THAT THE STATE IS  NOT  ABLE
 TO  TRACK  OR MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ON COST, QUALITY,
 ACCESS, EQUITY, AND COMPETITION.
  THIS PHENOMENON MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT  ON  PATIENT  CARE,  HEALTH
 CARE  COSTS,  AND  ULTIMATELY  ACCESS TO SERVICES. THESE LARGE INVESTOR-
 BACKED HEALTH CARE ENTITIES SHIFT VOLUME AND BUSINESS AWAY FROM COMMUNI-
 TY HOSPITALS AND THEIR AMBULATORY CARE NETWORKS  AND  OTHER  SAFETY  NET
 PROVIDERS,  UNDERMINING  THEIR  FINANCIAL  SUSTAINABILITY,  WHICH  MUST
 CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO THE  COMMUNITY.  IN  ADDITION,
 THE  CONCENTRATION  OF  THESE  INVESTOR-BACKED  PHYSICIAN PRACTICES IS A
 SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION,  WHICH  HAS  ALSO
 GIVEN  RISE  TO  OTHER  LEGISLATION,  INCLUDING  THE NO SURPRISE BILLING
 PROVISIONS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES LAW.
  § 4551. DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE,  THE  FOLLOWING
 TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:

 SERVICES) OR OTHERWISE; BUT NO PERSON SHALL BE DEEMED TO CONTROL ANOTHER
 PERSON SOLELY BY REASON OF BEING AN OFFICER OR DIRECTOR OF A HEALTH CARE
 ENTITY.  "CONTROL" SHALL BE PRESUMED TO EXIST IF ANY PERSON DIRECTLY OR
 S. 4007--A  139  A. 3007--A

 INDIRECTLY OWNS, CONTROLS, OR HOLDS WITH THE POWER TO VOTE  TEN  PERCENT
 OR MORE OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF A HEALTH CARE ENTITY.
  2.  "HEALTH  CARE ENTITY" SHALL INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO A PHYSI-

 ORGANIZATION, HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN, OR ANY OTHER KIND  OF  HEALTH  CARE
 FACILITY,  ORGANIZATION  OR  PLAN PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THIS
 STATE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT A "HEALTH CARE ENTITY" SHALL NOT  INCLUDE
 AN  INSURER DIRECTLY AUTHORIZED TO DO BUSINESS IN THIS STATE, OR A PHAR-
 MACY BENEFIT MANAGER REGISTERED OR LICENSED IN THIS STATE. AN  "INSURER"
 SHALL  NOT INCLUDE NON-INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES OF
 INSURANCE COMPANIES REGULATED UNDER THE INSURANCE LAW OR THIS CHAPTER.
  3. "HEALTH EQUITY" SHALL MEAN ACHIEVING THE HIGHEST  LEVEL  OF  HEALTH
 FOR  ALL  PEOPLE  AND  SHALL ENTAIL FOCUSED EFFORTS TO ADDRESS AVOIDABLE
 INEQUALITIES BY EQUALIZING THOSE CONDITIONS FOR HEALTH  FOR  THOSE  THAT
 HAVE  EXPERIENCED  INJUSTICES, SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGES, AND SYSTEMIC
 DISADVANTAGES.
  4. "MATERIAL TRANSACTION" SHALL MEAN:
  (A) ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, OCCURRING DURING A SINGLE TRANSACTION OR  IN

 OF CONTROL;
  (III)  AN  AFFILIATION OR CONTRACT FORMED BETWEEN A HEALTH CARE ENTITY
 AND ANOTHER PERSON; OR
  (IV) THE FORMATION OF A PARTNERSHIP, JOINT VENTURE,  ACCOUNTABLE  CARE
 ORGANIZATION,  PARENT  ORGANIZATION, OR MANAGEMENT SERVICES ORGANIZATION
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADMINISTERING CONTRACTS WITH HEALTH PLANS, THIRD-PAR-
 TY ADMINISTRATORS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS, OR HEALTH  CARE  PROVIDERS
 AS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMMISSIONER BY REGULATION.
  (B) "MATERIAL TRANSACTION" SHALL NOT INCLUDE A CLINICAL AFFILIATION OF
 HEALTH CARE ENTITIES FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLABORATING ON CLINICAL
 TRIALS  OR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY
 TRANSACTION THAT IS ALREADY SUBJECT  TO  REVIEW  UNDER  ARTICLE  TWENTY-
 EIGHT, THIRTY, THIRTY-SIX, FORTY, FORTY-SIX, FORTY-SIX-A, OR FORTY-SIX-B
 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  §  4552. REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS. 1. THE DEPART-
 MENT SHALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO  REVIEW  AND  APPROVE  MATERIAL  TRANS-
 ACTIONS, WHICH MAY BE FURTHER DEFINED BY THE COMMISSIONER IN REGULATION,
 TO  ASSESS  SUCH  TRANSACTIONS'  IMPACT ON COST, QUALITY, ACCESS, HEALTH
 EQUITY AND COMPETITION IN THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE MARKET.
  2. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE, AND WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
 PROMULGATED BY THE COMMISSIONER PURSUANT TO SECTION  FORTY-FIVE  HUNDRED
 FIFTY-SIX  OF  THIS ARTICLE, THE DEPARTMENT SHALL ADOPT CRITERIA FOR THE
 CONSIDERATION OF REQUESTS BY HEALTH CARE ENTITIES TO CONSUMMATE A  MATE-
 RIAL  TRANSACTION.  THE  CRITERIA  SHALL  INCLUDE  THE FACTORS LISTED IN

 S. 4007--A  140  A. 3007--A
 
 SEVENTEEN, FORTY-TWO, FORTY-THREE, SEVENTY-ONE, OR SEVENTY-THREE OF  THE
 INSURANCE LAW, OR REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER.
  § 4553. NOTICE OF MATERIAL TRANSACTION; REQUIREMENTS. 1. A HEALTH CARE

 effective  date  for  each  particular  provision  contained within such
 Subpart is set forth in the last section of such Subpart. Any  provision
 in  any section contained within a Subpart, including the effective date

 be  used  as  the  affidavit of the facts constituting the claim and the
 amount due; in such case, an affidavit as to the default shall  be  made
 by  the  party  or  the  party's attorney. In an action arising out of a
 consumer credit transaction, if the plaintiff is not the original credi-
 tor, the applicant shall include: (1) an affidavit by the original cred-
 itor of the facts constituting the debt, the  default  in  payment,  the
 sale  or  assignment of the debt, and the amount due at the time of sale

 AUTHORIZED UNDER TITLE EIGHT OF THE EDUCATION LAW, THE  APPLICANT  SHALL
 INCLUDE: (1) AN AFFIDAVIT BY THE HOSPITAL OR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL OF

 MEDICAL DEBT TO ANOTHER ENTITY, AN AFFIDAVIT OF SALE OF THE MEDICAL DEBT
 BY  THE  DEBT  SELLER,  COMPLETED  BY THE SELLER OR ASSIGNOR; AND (3) AN
 AFFIDAVIT OF A WITNESS OF THE PLAINTIFF, WHICH INCLUDES A CHAIN OF TITLE
 OF THE MEDICAL DEBT, COMPLETED BY THE PLAINTIFF OR PLAINTIFF'S  WITNESS.

 attachment of property, the  affidavit  must  state  that  an  order  of
 attachment  granted in the action has been levied on the property of the
 defendant, describe the property and state its value. Proof  of  mailing
 the  notice  required by subdivision (g) of this section, where applica-
 ble, shall also be filed.
  (j) Affidavit. A request for a default judgment entered by the  clerk,
 must  be  accompanied  by  an  affidavit by the plaintiff or plaintiff's
 attorney stating that after reasonable inquiry, he or she has reason  to

  Section  1.  This  act  shall  be  known  and  may  be  cited  as  the

 providing for transparency into the price of prescription drugs and  the
 regulation  of  entities  that  play  a  role  in  the  distribution  of
 prescription drugs in this state. The impact of ever rising prescription
 drug costs impacts consumers in this state both at the pharmacy  counter
 and  in  health  plan  premium  costs. Prescription drug costs also have
 direct costs to the state fiscal, health  insurance  companies,  pharma-
 cies, pharmacy benefit managers, hospitals, employers, and unions.

  Section 1.  Legislative findings.  The legislature finds that it is in
 the best interest of the people of this state to expand  article  77  of
 the  insurance law to protect insureds and health care providers against
 the failure or inability of a health or property/casualty insurer  writ-
 ing  health  insurance  to  perform  its  contractual obligations due to
 financial impairment or insolvency.  The  superintendent  of  financial
 services  has  the right and responsibility to enforce the insurance law
 and the authority to seek redress against any person responsible for the
 impairment or insolvency of the insurer, and  nothing  in  this  act  is
 intended to restrict or limit such right, responsibility, or authority.
  § 2.  The article heading of article 77 of the insurance law, as added
 by chapter 802 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  THE LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY
  GUARANTY CORPORATION
  OF NEW YORK ACT
  § 3. Section 7701 of the insurance law, as added by chapter 802 of the
 laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  §  7701.  Short title. This article shall be known and may be cited as
 "The Life AND HEALTH Insurance Company Guaranty Corporation of New  York
 Act".
  §  4.  Section 7702 of the insurance law, as amended by chapter 454 of
 the laws of 2014, is amended to read as follows:
  § 7702. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to  provide  funds  to
 protect  policy  owners, insureds, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, beneficiaries,
 annuitants, payees and assignees  of  life  insurance  policies,  health
 insurance  policies,  annuity  contracts, funding agreements and supple-
 mental contracts issued by life insurance  companies,  HEALTH  INSURANCE
 COMPANIES, AND PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES, subject to certain
 limitations,  against  failure  in  the performance of contractual obli-
 gations due to the impairment or insolvency of the insurer issuing  such
 policies,  contracts,  or  funding  agreements.  In  the judgment of the
 legislature, the foregoing objects and purposes  not  being  capable  of
 accomplishment by a corporation created under general laws, the creation
 of  a  not-for-profit  corporation  of  insurers is provided for by this
 article to enable the guarantee of payment of benefits and of  continua-
 tion of coverages, and members of the corporation are subject to assess-
 ment to carry out the purposes of this article.
  §  5.  Paragraphs  1  and  2  of subsection (a) of section 7703 of the

 policy,  contract,  or  funding  agreement  was issued or on the date of
 entry of a court order of liquidation or rehabilitation with respect  to
 such a company that is an impaired or insolvent insurer, as the case may

 PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE TWO-A OF ARTICLE TWO OF  THIS  CHAP-
 TER. EACH OF THE REMAINING TITLES APPLIES TO A PARTICULAR PROFESSION.
  §  6501.  ADMISSION TO A PROFESSION (LICENSING). 1. ADMISSION TO PRAC-
 TICE OF A PROFESSION IN THIS STATE IS ACCOMPLISHED BY  A  LICENSE  BEING
 ISSUED TO A QUALIFIED APPLICANT BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. TO QUALIFY FOR

 TITLE FOR THE PARTICULAR PROFESSION  AND  SHALL  MEET  THE  REQUIREMENTS
 PRESCRIBED IN SECTION 3-503 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW.

 CANT  SEEKING  TO  QUALIFY FOR A LICENSE PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE WHO IS

 STATES, NATIONAL GUARD OR RESERVES AS DEFINED IN 10 U.S.C. SECTIONS 1209
 AND  1211,  AND SUCH SPOUSE IS TRANSFERRED BY THE MILITARY TO THIS STATE

 SHALL BE AFFORDED AN EXPEDITED REVIEW OF  HIS  OR  HER  APPLICATION  FOR
 LICENSURE. SUCH APPLICATION SHALL BE ON A FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE DEPART-
 MENT  AND  SHALL INCLUDE AN ATTESTATION BY THE APPLICANT OF THE MILITARY
 STATUS  OF HIS OR HER SPOUSE AND ANY OTHER SUCH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION
 THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY REQUIRE. UPON REVIEW OF  SUCH  APPLICATION,  THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL ISSUE A LICENSE TO THE APPLICANT IF THE APPLICANT HOLDS
 A  LICENSE  IN  GOOD STANDING IN ANOTHER STATE AND IN THE OPINION OF THE
 DEPARTMENT, THE REQUIREMENTS FOR  LICENSURE  OF  SUCH  OTHER  STATE  ARE

 APPLICANT WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSURE IN THIS STATE BECAUSE
 HE OR SHE HOLDS A LICENSE IN  GOOD  STANDING  FROM  ANOTHER  STATE  WITH
 SIGNIFICANTLY  COMPARABLE LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE OF THIS STATE,
 EXCEPT THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE DIRECT SOURCE  VERIFI-
 CATION  OF  THE  APPLICANT'S  UNDERLYING  CREDENTIALS  (E.G., RECEIPT OF
 ORIGINAL TRANSCRIPT, EXPERIENCE  VERIFICATION).  SUCH  PERMIT  SHALL  BE
 VALID  FOR  SIX  MONTHS  OR  UNTIL  TEN DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION THAT THE
 APPLICANT DOES NOT MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR LICENSURE. AN  ADDITIONAL
 SIX  MONTHS  MAY  BE GRANTED UPON A DETERMINATION BY THE DEPARTMENT THAT
 THE APPLICANT IS EXPECTED TO QUALIFY FOR THE FULL LICENSE  UPON  RECEIPT
 OF  THE  REMAINING DIRECT SOURCE VERIFICATION DOCUMENTS REQUESTED BY THE
 DEPARTMENT IN SUCH TIME PERIOD AND  THAT  THE  DELAY  IN  PROVIDING  THE
 NECESSARY  DOCUMENTATION  FOR  FULL  LICENSURE  WAS  DUE  TO EXTENUATING
 CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE MILITARY SPOUSE COULD NOT AVOID.
  C. A TEMPORARY PRACTICE PERMIT ISSUED UNDER PARAGRAPH B OF THIS SUBDI-
 VISION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE FULL DISCIPLINARY AND REGULATORY AUTHORI-
 TY OF THE DEPARTMENT, PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE, AS IF SUCH AUTHORIZATION

 PROCEDURES OF THIS SECTION. THE DETERMINATION  OF  THE  PANEL  SHALL  BE
 FINAL  AND  SHALL  NOT  BE SUBJECT TO THE REGENTS DECISION PROCEDURES OF

 TO THE DEPARTMENT, WHICH MAY ACCEPT AND HOLD  SUCH  LICENSE  DURING  THE
 PERIOD  OF  SUCH  ALLEGED  INCAPACITY  OR  THE DEPARTMENT MAY ACCEPT THE
 SURRENDER OF SUCH LICENSE AFTER AGREEMENT TO CONDITIONS TO BE MET  PRIOR

 GRAPH D OR E OF SUBDIVISION TEN OF THIS SECTION, THE PRACTITIONER SHALL,
 UPON ISSUING SUCH PRESCRIPTION, INDICATE IN THE PATIENT'S HEALTH  RECORD

 TIMELY MANNER AND SUCH DELAY WOULD HAVE ADVERSELY IMPACTED THE PATIENT'S
 S. 4007--A  346  A. 3007--A
 
 MEDICAL  CONDITION,  OR  B.  WAS  TO  BE DISPENSED BY A PHARMACY LOCATED
 OUTSIDE THE STATE.

 UNDER INSANITARY CONDITIONS WHEREBY IT MAY HAVE BEEN  CONTAMINATED  WITH
 FILTH,  OR  WHEREBY  IT  MAY  HAVE BEEN RENDERED INJURIOUS TO HEALTH; OR

 USERS; PROVIDED, THAT, WHERE ANY REQUIREMENT OF SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OF THIS
 PARAGRAPH, AS APPLIED TO ANY DRUG OR DEVICE, IS NOT  NECESSARY  FOR  THE
 PROTECTION  OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH, THE BOARD SHALL PROMULGATE REGULATIONS
 EXEMPTING SUCH DRUG OR DEVICE FROM SUCH REQUIREMENT.

  1. A state board for professional medical conduct is hereby created in
 the department in matters  of  professional  misconduct  as  defined  in
 sections  sixty-five hundred thirty and sixty-five hundred thirty-one of
 [the education  law]  THIS  CHAPTER.  Its  physician  members  shall  be
 appointed by the commissioner at least eighty-five percent of whom shall
 be  from among nominations submitted by the medical society of the state
 of New York, the New York state osteopathic society, the New York acade-
 my of medicine, county medical societies, statewide specialty  societies
 recognized by the council of medical specialty societies, and the hospi-
 tal association of New York state. Its lay members shall be appointed by
 the commissioner with the approval of the governor. The board of regents
 shall  also appoint twenty percent of the members of the board. Not less
 than sixty-seven percent of  the  members  appointed  by  the  board  of
 regents  shall  be  physicians. Not less than eighty-five percent of the
 physician members appointed by the board of regents shall be from  among
 nominations  submitted  by the medical society of the state of New York,
 the New York state osteopathic society, the New York  academy  of  medi-
 cine,  county  medical societies, statewide medical societies recognized
 by the council of medical specialty societies, and the hospital  associ-
 ation  of  New York state. Any failure to meet the percentage thresholds
 stated in this subdivision shall not be  grounds  for  invalidating  any
 action  by or on authority of the board for professional medical conduct
 or a committee or a member thereof. The board for  professional  medical
 conduct  shall consist of not fewer than eighteen physicians licensed in
 the state for at least five years, two  of  whom  shall  be  doctors  of
 osteopathy,  not fewer than two of whom shall be physicians who dedicate
 a significant portion of their practice to the use  of  non-conventional
 medical  treatments who may be nominated by New York state medical asso-
 ciations dedicated to the advancement of such treatments, at  least  one
 of  whom  shall  have  expertise  in palliative care, and not fewer than
 seven lay members. An executive secretary  shall  be  appointed  by  the
 chairperson  and shall be a licensed physician. Such executive secretary
 shall not be a member of the board, shall hold office  at  the  pleasure
 of,  and shall have the powers and duties assigned and the annual salary
 fixed by, the chairperson. The chairperson shall also assign such secre-
 taries or other persons to the board as are necessary.
  9-b. Neither the board for professional medical conduct nor the office
 of professional medical conduct shall charge a licensee with  misconduct
 as  defined in sections sixty-five hundred thirty and sixty-five hundred
 thirty-one of [the education law] THIS CHAPTER, or cause a  report  made
 to  the  director of such office to be investigated beyond a preliminary
 review as set forth in clause (A) of subparagraph (i) of  paragraph  (a)
 of  subdivision  ten of this section, where such report is determined to
 be based solely upon the recommendation  or  provision  of  a  treatment
 modality  to  a  particular  patient  by  such  licensee  that  is  not
 universally accepted by the medical profession, including but not limit-
 ed to, varying modalities used in the  treatment  of  Lyme  disease  and
 other  tick-borne diseases.  When a licensee, acting in accordance with
 paragraph e of subdivision four of section  sixty-five  hundred  twenty-
 seven  of  [the  education  law]  THIS CHAPTER, recommends or provides a
 treatment modality that effectively treats human disease, pain,  injury,
 S. 4007--A  490  A. 3007--A
 
 deformity  or  physical  condition  for which the licensee is treating a
 patient, the recommendation or provision of that modality to  a  partic-
 ular  patient  shall not, by itself, constitute professional misconduct.
 The  licensee shall otherwise abide by all other applicable professional
 requirements.
  (2) make arrangements for the transfer and maintenance of the  medical
 records  of  his  or her former patients. Records shall be either trans-
 ferred to the licensee's former patients consistent with the  provisions
 of  sections seventeen and eighteen of this chapter or to another physi-
 cian or health care practitioner as  provided  in  clause  (1)  of  this
 subparagraph  who  shall  expressly assume responsibility for their care
 and maintenance and for providing access to such records, as provided in
 subdivisions twenty-two and thirty-two  of  section  sixty-five  hundred
 thirty  of  [the education law] THIS CHAPTER, the rules of the [board of
 regents] DEPARTMENT or the regulations of the  commissioner  of  [educa-
 tion]  HEALTH  and sections seventeen and eighteen of this chapter. When
 records are not transferred to the  licensee's  former  patients  or  to
 another  physician  or  health  care  practitioner,  the  licensee whose
 license has been revoked, annulled, surrendered, suspended or restricted
 shall remain responsible for the care and  maintenance  of  the  medical
 records of his or her former patients and shall be subject to additional
 proceedings pursuant to subdivisions twenty-two, thirty-two and forty of
 section sixty-five hundred thirty of [the education law] THIS CHAPTER in
 the  event  that the licensee fails to maintain those medical records or
 fails to make them available to a former patient.
  (p) Convictions of crimes or administrative violations.  In  cases  of
 professional  misconduct  based  solely  upon a violation of subdivision
 nine of section sixty-five hundred thirty of [the  education  law]  THIS
 CHAPTER, the director may direct that charges be prepared and served and
 may  refer  the  matter  to  a committee on professional conduct for its
 review and report of findings, conclusions as  to  guilt,  and  determi-
 nation. In such cases, the notice of hearing shall state that the licen-
 see  shall  file a written answer to each of the charges and allegations
 in the statement of charges no later than ten days prior to the hearing,
 and that any charge or allegation not so answered shall be deemed admit-
 ted, that the licensee may wish to seek the advice of counsel  prior  to
 filing  such  answer  that  the licensee may file a brief and affidavits
 with the committee on professional conduct, that the licensee may appear
 personally before the committee on professional conduct, may be  repres-
 ented  by  counsel and may present evidence or sworn testimony in his or
 her behalf, and the notice may contain such other information as may  be
 considered  appropriate by the director. The department may also present
 evidence or sworn testimony and file a brief at the  hearing.  A  steno-
 graphic  record  of  the  hearing  shall be made. Such evidence or sworn
 testimony offered to the committee  on  professional  conduct  shall  be
 strictly  limited  to  evidence and testimony relating to the nature and
 severity of the penalty to be  imposed  upon  the  licensee.  Where  the
 charges  are based on the conviction of state law crimes in other juris-
 dictions, evidence may be offered to the committee which would show that
 the conviction would not be a crime in New York state. The committee  on
 professional  conduct may reasonably limit the number of witnesses whose
 testimony will be received and the length of time any  witness  will  be
 permitted to testify. The determination of the committee shall be served
 upon  the  licensee and the department in accordance with the provisions
 of paragraph (h) of this subdivision. A determination pursuant  to  this
 S. 4007--A  491  A. 3007--A
 
 subdivision  may  be  reviewed  by  the  administrative review board for
 professional medical conduct.
  (a)  The  medical society of the state of New York, the New York state
 osteopathic society or any district osteopathic society,  any  statewide
 medical  specialty  society  or  organization,  and every county medical
 society, every person licensed pursuant to [articles one  hundred  thir-
 ty-one,  one hundred thirty-one-B, one hundred thirty-three, one hundred
 thirty-seven and one hundred thirty-nine of the  education  law]  TITLES
 TWO,  FOUR, SEVEN, TEN, AND TWELVE OF ARTICLE FIFTY-ONE OF THIS CHAPTER,
 and the chief executive officer, the chief of the medical staff and  the
 chairperson of each department of every institution which is established
 pursuant  to  article  twenty-eight  of this chapter and a comprehensive
 health services plan pursuant to article forty-four of this  chapter  or
 article  forty-three  of  the insurance law, shall, and any other person
 may, report to the board any  information  which  such  person,  medical
 society,  organization  institution or plan has which reasonably appears
 to show that a licensee is guilty of professional misconduct as  defined
 in  sections sixty-five hundred thirty and sixty-five hundred thirty-one
 of [the education law] THIS CHAPTER. Such reports shall remain confiden-
 tial and shall not be admitted into evidence in  any  administrative  or
 judicial  proceeding except that the board, its staff, or the members of
 its committees may begin investigations on the basis of such reports and
 may use them to develop further information.
  (a) Temporary surrender. The license and registration  of  a  licensee
 who may be temporarily incapacitated for the active practice of medicine
 and  whose  alleged incapacity has not resulted in harm to a patient may
 be  voluntarily  surrendered  to  the  board  for  professional  medical
 conduct,  which  may  accept  and hold such license during the period of
 such alleged incapacity or the board for  professional  medical  conduct
 may  accept  the surrender of such license after agreement to conditions
 to be met prior to the restoration of the license. The board shall  give
 prompt written notification of such surrender to the division of profes-
 sional licensing services of the state education department, and to each
 hospital  at  which  the  licensee  has  privileges.  The licensee whose
 license is so surrendered shall notify all patients and all persons  who
 request  medical  services  that  the licensee has temporarily withdrawn
 from the practice of medicine. The licensure status of each such  licen-
 see  shall  be  "inactive"  and  the licensee shall not be authorized to
 practice medicine. The temporary surrender shall not be deemed to be  an
 admission  of disability or of professional misconduct, and shall not be
 used as evidence of a violation of subdivision seven or eight of section
 sixty-five hundred thirty of [the education law] THIS CHAPTER unless the
 licensee practices while the license is "inactive".  Any  such  practice
 shall constitute a violation of subdivision twelve of section sixty-five
 hundred  thirty  of [the education law] THIS CHAPTER. The surrender of a
 license under this subdivision shall not  bar  any  disciplinary  action
 except  action  based solely upon the provisions of subdivision seven or
 eight of section sixty-five hundred thirty of [the education  law]  THIS
 CHAPTER  and  where no harm to a patient has resulted, and shall not bar
 any civil or criminal action or proceeding which might be brought  with-
 out  regard  to  such surrender. A surrendered license shall be restored
 upon a showing to  the  satisfaction  of  a  committee  of  professional
 conduct  of  the  state  board for professional medical conduct that the
 licensee is not  incapacitated  for  the  active  practice  of  medicine
 provided,  however,  that the committee may impose reasonable conditions
 on the licensee, if it determined that due to the nature and  extent  of
 S. 4007--A  492  A. 3007--A
 
 the  licensee's  former  incapacity  such  conditions  are  necessary to
 protect the health of the people. The chairperson of the committee shall
 issue a restoration order adopting the decision of the committee. Prompt
 written  notification of such restoration shall be given to the division
 of professional licensing services of the [state  education]  department
 and  to  all  hospitals  which  were  notified  of  the surrender of the
 license.
  (b) Permanent surrender. The license and registration  of  a  licensee
 who  may  be  permanently incapacitated for the active practice of medi-
 cine, and whose alleged  incapacity  has  not  resulted  in  harm  to  a
 patient,  may  be  voluntarily surrendered to the board for professional
 medical conduct. The board shall give  prompt  written  notification  of
 such surrender to the division of professional licensing services of the
 state  education  department, and to each hospital at which the licensee
 has privileges. The licensee whose license is so surrendered shall noti-
 fy all patients and all persons who request medical  services  that  the
 licensee  has  permanently withdrawn from the practice of medicine.  The
 permanent surrender shall not be deemed to be an admission of disability
 of or professional misconduct, and shall not be used as  evidence  of  a
 violation  of  subdivision  seven or eight of section sixty-five hundred
 thirty of [the education law] THIS CHAPTER. The surrender shall not  bar
 any  civil or criminal action or proceeding which might be brought with-
 out regard to such surrender. There shall be no restoration of a license
 that has been surrendered pursuant to this subdivision.
  (c) If the committee determines that reasonable cause exists as speci-
 fied in paragraph (a) of this subdivision and that there is insufficient
 evidence for the matter to constitute misconduct as defined in  sections
 sixty-five  hundred  thirty and section sixty-five hundred thirty-one of
 [the education law] THIS CHAPTER,  the  committee  may  issue  an  order
 directing  that  the  licensee's practice of medicine be monitored for a
 period specified in the order, which shall in no event exceed one  year,
 by  a  licensee  approved  by the director, which may include members of
 county medical societies or district osteopathic societies designated by
 the commissioner. The licensee responsible for monitoring  the  licensee
 shall submit regular reports to the director. If the licensee refuses to
 cooperate  with  the licensee responsible for monitoring or if the moni-
 toring licensee submits a report that the  licensee  is  not  practicing
 medicine  with  reasonable  skill and safety to his or her patients, the
 committee may refer the matter to the director for  further  proceedings
 pursuant  to  subdivision ten of this section. An order pursuant to this
 paragraph shall be kept confidential and shall not be subject to discov-
 ery or subpoena, unless the licensee refuses to comply with the order.
