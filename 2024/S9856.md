 Introduced  by  Sen. HOYLMAN-SIGAL -- (at request of the Office of Court
  Administration) -- read twice and ordered printed, and when printed to
  be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil practice law and rules, in relation to  alter-
  nate jurors
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 4106 of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  as
 amended  by  chapter  204  of  the  laws  of 2013, is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 4106. Alternate jurors. One or more additional jurors, to  be  known
 as  "alternate  jurors",  may  be  drawn upon the request of a party and
 consent of the court. Such alternate juror or jurors shall be  drawn  at
 the  same  time,  from the same source, in the same manner, and have the
 same qualifications as regular jurors, and be subject to the same  exam-
 inations  and challenges. They shall be seated with, take the oath with,
 and be treated in the same manner as the  regular  jurors.  After  final
 submission  of  the  case, the court may, in its discretion, retain such
 alternate juror or jurors to ensure availability if needed. At any time,
 before or after the final submission of the case,  if  a  regular  juror
 dies, or becomes ill, or is unable to perform the duties of a juror, the
 court may order that juror discharged and draw the name of an alternate,
 or  retained  alternate, if any, who shall replace the discharged juror,
 and be treated as if that juror had been selected as one of the  regular
 jurors.  Once deliberations have begun, the court may allow an alternate
 juror to participate in such  deliberations  only  if  a  regular  juror
 becomes  unable  to  perform  the  duties of a juror. AFTER AN ALTERNATE
 JUROR HAS BEEN SUBSTITUTED, THE JURY SHALL DELIBERATE ANEW ON ALL OF THE
 ISSUES THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO THE JURY AT THE OUTSET  OF  DELIBERATIONS.
 WHERE  A  JURY  HAS  RENDERED  THE VERDICT ON ONE OR MORE ISSUES, AND AN
 ALTERNATE JUROR MUST BE SEATED, THE JURY SHALL DELIBERATE  ANEW  ON  ALL
 ISSUES THAT WERE NOT DETERMINED BY SUCH RENDERED VERDICT.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all
 actions and proceedings pending on or after such effective date.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
