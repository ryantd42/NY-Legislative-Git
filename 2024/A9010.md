  (c) how being a caregiver child impacts the child's education;
  (d) the circumstances that lead to a child becoming a caregiver child;
 and
  (e)  any  recommendations  on  how  to reduce the negative educational
 impacts of being a caregiver child.
  § 2. Within one year of the effective date of this  act,  the  commis-
 sioner  of  education  shall  submit  a  report  of his or her findings,
 conclusions and recommendations to the governor, the temporary president
 of the senate, the speaker of the assembly, and the chairs of the senate
 and assembly committees on education. Such  report  shall  also  include
 such  legislative  proposals  as  such  commissioner  deems necessary to
 implement his or her recommendations.
