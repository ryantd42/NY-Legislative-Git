 a  licensed  pharmacist  employed in such a [facility or] pharmacy. Such

 tered  pharmacy  technician  has received appropriate training to ensure
 competence before he or she begins assisting a  licensed  pharmacist  in
 compounding,  preparing,  labeling,  ADMINISTERING  IMMUNIZATIONS  or
 dispensing of drugs, in accordance with this  article  and  article  one
 hundred  thirty-seven  of  this title. For the purposes of this article,
 direct [personal] supervision means supervision of procedures  based  on
 instructions  given  directly  by  a supervising licensed pharmacist who
 [remains in the immediate area where the procedures are being performed]
