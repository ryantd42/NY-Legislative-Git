  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 12-18, 2024, as Police Week in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the intent of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 12-18, 2024, as Police Week in the
State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National Police
Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, This observance is to recognize and to  honor  the  service
and  sacrifice  of  those law enforcement officers killed in the line of
duty while protecting our communities and  safeguarding  our  democracy;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  is  proudly  home  to  601  strong,  robust and
impactful police agencies with over 68,980  men  and  women  working  as
police officers throughout the State, while over 900,000 law enforcement
officers serve in communities across the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Police  officers  in New York bravely put the wellbeing of
the community before themselves on a daily basis as these  professionals
are  among the best our State has to offer, and truly exemplify the best
of the New York spirit; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the history of the State of New York, over 1,772
brave men and women have made the  ultimate  sacrifice  and  lost  their
lives  in  the line of duty for the safety and protection of others, and
since the first recorded death in 1791, more than 20,000 law enforcement
officers in the United States have been killed in the line of duty; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1962, President Kennedy proclaimed May 15th as  National
Peace  Officers  Memorial  Day  and  the calendar week in which May 15th
falls as National Police Week, which was further established by a  joint
resolution  of  Congress which proclaimed that National Police Week pays
special recognition to those law  enforcement  officers  who  have  lost
their lives in the line of duty for the safety and protection of others;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The names of all New York State heroes who sacrificed their
lives  in the performance of their duty are engraved on the walls of the
New York State Police Officers Memorial  in  Albany,  while  the  Police
Memorial  Wall  in  New York City commemorates fallen members of the New
York City Police Department, along with  the  National  Law  Enforcement
Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C.; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to commend the
long-standing efforts of law enforcement in the State of  New  York  who
diligently  contribute  to  the  efficient  and  just  operation  of our
criminal justice system; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
this  serious  issue,  and  more  must be done to eradicate the assault,
 
injury and death of our valued police officers at the local,  State  and
national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 12-18, 2024, as Police
Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to all police-based unions and organizations throughout New
York; the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund; the  Concerns
of Police Survivors; and the Fraternal Order of Police.
