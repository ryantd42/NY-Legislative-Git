  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 20, 2024, as Transgender Day of Remembrance
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to  commemorate
and  increase awareness of the community issues that are of significance
to the citizens of this great Nation and Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  November  20,  2024,  as
Transgender  Day of Remembrance in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of International Transgender Day of Remembrance; and
 
  WHEREAS, Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR), also  known  as  the
International Transgender Day of Remembrance, has been observed annually
since  its  inception on November 20th as a day to memorialize those who
have been murdered as a result of transphobia; it is also a day to  draw
attention to the continued violence endured by transgender people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Transgender  Day  of  Remembrance was founded in 1999 by a
small group, including Gwendolyn Ann Smith, to memorialize the murder of
Rita Hester, a transgender woman in  Allston,  Massachusetts;  by  2010,
TDoR  was observed in over 185 cities throughout more than 20 countries;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, a typical TDoR memorial includes  a  reading  of
the  names  of those who lost their lives from November 20 of the former
year to November 20 of the current year, and may include other tributes,
such as candlelight vigils,  dedicated  church  services,  marches,  art
shows, food drives and film screenings; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Formerly  the  Gay  & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,
GLAAD has extensively covered Transgender Day of Remembrance through its
interviews of numerous transgender advocates  including  actress  Candis
Cayne;  this  vital  organization  has also profiled an event at the New
York City LGBT Community Center and has widely discussed media  coverage
of TDoR; and
 
  WHEREAS, Transgender violence and bigotry harm our communities, with
statistics  showing  that  one  in two transgender and gender non-binary
individuals have encountered verbal,  physical,  emotional,  or  digital
violence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  in  five transgender people in the United States have
been denied housing and 11% have been evicted for their gender identity;
furthermore, one in 12 transgender people report  being  kicked  out  of
their family homes and one in five transgender people have been homeless
at some point in their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Transgender  people  have a rate of depression nearly four
times that of the general population and 40% of transgender people  have
 
attempted  suicide in their lifetime (nine times the rate of the general
population); and
 
  WHEREAS,  One in two transgender people have been sexually assaulted
at some point in their life,  with  that  percent  only  increasing  for
females and people of color; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More than half of transgender individuals have experienced
harassment due to their gender identity at  their  work  or  in  medical
offices; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Transgender  people  are four times more likely to live in
poverty than the general population; and
 
  WHEREAS, We must work together  to  educate  our  communities  about
transgender  rights,  supporting the transgender community, and speaking
out against harmful attitudes and actions which condone transphobia; and
 
  WHEREAS, When we as a New York State Legislative Body  actively  get
involved, we can prevent transphobia by increasing education, awareness,
and community involvement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is time to create a safer environment in the workplace,
the community, and the whole State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, November 20th is National Transgender  Day  of  Remembrance
and  each  day  in  the  year is an opportunity to create change for the
future; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Transgender  violence  is  a  horrific  hate  crime  which
deserves the attention of this Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  November  20,  2024,  as
Transgender  Day  of  Remembrance  in  the  State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of  the  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
