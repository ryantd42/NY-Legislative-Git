  CONGRATULATING  the  Cardinal  Hayes  High  School
  Football Team upon the  occasion  of  capturing  the
  2023  New  York  State Catholic High School Athletic
  Association Championship on December 2, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, Individual and team championships are highly  sought  after
in  high  school  sports;  this  Legislative Body commends rare athletic
achievements and pays special  recognition  to  those  who  pursue  such
excellence and become examples for the youth of this great Empire State;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Athletic  competition  helps to enhance both the moral and
physical development of young athletes, preparing them for the future by
instilling in them the importance of teamwork, encouraging a standard of
healthy living, and developing a sense of fair play and competition; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to  congratulate  the
Cardinal  Hayes High School Football Team upon the occasion of capturing
the 2023 New  York  State  Catholic  High  School  Athletic  Association
Championship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Beginning  its  inaugural season winning one game in 1942,
eighty-one years later, Cardinal Hayes became the first  New  York  City
football team to win the prestigious New York State Catholic High School
Football Championship; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  the praise and applause of their excited fans, alumni,
and New York City at large, the Cardinals defeated the St.  Francis  Red
Raiders  of  Buffalo  in  a  decisive  40-22  victory  to  capture  the
Championship on Saturday, December 2,  2023,  at  Columbia  University's
Robert K. Kraft Field; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Cardinal  Hayes  Cardinals  overcame  extraordinary
adversity on their way to a 12 and 2  record,  recovering  from  a  last
place finish season a year ago, to capture the 2023 state title; student
athletes experienced severe COVID-related disruptions over the course of
their  playing  careers,  which  limited  games and shifted seasons; the
Cardinals overcame the additional novel obstacles of an accidental  fire
in  the coaches' offices, relocating the team's weight lifting equipment
outside to a school parking lot, as well as limited practice spaces; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite these adversities,  long-tenured  Head  Coach  C.J.
O'Neil and the Cardinals resolutely persevered through the season with a
dominating  record  to  secure  their first ever championship, adding to
Cardinal Hayes Bronx legacy much to the delight and pride of their  home
borough and New York City; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Head Coach C.J. O'Neil and all the outstanding athletes on
the Cardinal Hayes High  School  Football  Team  have  clearly  utilized
dedication,  determination,  and  teamwork  in  providing  a  lasting
contribution to the spirit of excellence which is a tradition  of  their
school; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate the Cardinal Hayes High  School  Football  Team:  Cleveland
