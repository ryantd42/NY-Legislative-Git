  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
those outstanding school districts who dedicate their time, energy,  and
resources to music education and the refinement of the arts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to

Union Free School District has been designated as a Best  Community  for
Music  Education  by  the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM)

  WHEREAS, Now in its  25th  year,  the  Best  Communities  for  Music
Education  designation  is  awarded  to  districts  which  demonstrate
outstanding achievement for providing music access and education to  all
students;  Ken-Ton  was  one  of  just  975  school districts across the
country to receive this esteemed designation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  impressive  achievement  of  the  Kenmore-Town  of
Tonawanda  Union  Free  School  District  music  program  is  in  direct
correlation to the unwavering attention and  efforts  of  the  dedicated
music educators within the district: Phil Aguglia, Laura Anderson, Maria

Free School District are committed to actively promoting and nurturing a
comprehensive music program for all the students of the district; and
 
  WHEREAS, Music is an extremely important part of the  curriculum  at
all  grade  levels  in  Ken-Ton  schools;  music  education  begins  in
kindergarten  for  every  student  with  band,  chorus,  and  orchestra
ensembles  beginning  in  fourth  grade;  there  are  a  wide variety of
different band, jazz, orchestra, and vocal ensembles of  varying  sizes,
compositions,  and  skill  levels,  as well as many music electives that
students  can  take  advantage  of,  including  Advanced  Placement  and
International Baccalaureate music classes; and

performers and routinely bring their  student  ensembles  out  into  the
community,  performing  at  a variety of venues across Western New York;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Ken-Ton  students  and  ensembles  routinely  perform  in
regional and state competitions; in recent years, hundreds  of  students
have  earned  a  place  in  All-County,  Area  All-State, and Conference
All-State  festivals,  as  well  as  other  highly  selective  regional,
national, and even international ensembles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Additionally,  numerous  Ken-Ton graduates have gone on to
the nation's elite music colleges and are  now  professional  musicians;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Music education provides positive outcomes for students in
many educational,  cognitive,  and  social  skills,  including  enhanced
neural processing, conflict resolution, and teamwork; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Music faculty commit their time, passion, and hard work to
the task of musical training, and to guiding music  students  through  a
successful  music  training  journey that provides lifelong benefits for
the students; and
 
  WHEREAS, Talent, dedication, and countless hours of teaching by  the
music  educators  and  practice  by  the student musicians have made the
Kenmore-Town of Tonawanda Union Free School District suitable  for  this
prestigious accolade; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Kenmore-Town  of Tonawanda Union Free School District
student musicians, teachers, and the  entire  school  community  can  be
justifiably  proud  of  their musical achievements and for demonstrating
outstanding support for  and  participation  in  music  education;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Kenmore-Town of Tonawanda Union Free  School  District  upon
the  occasion  of  its  designation  as  a 2024 Best Community for Music
