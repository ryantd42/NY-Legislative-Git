  COMMEMORATING  the  75th  Anniversary  of  the New
  Hackensack Fire Company to be celebrated on  June  7
  to 9, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud to commemorate the 75th
Anniversary of the New Hackensack Fire Company to be celebrated on  June
7  to 9, 2024 and to honor its past and present firefighting members for
75 years of fire protection to the citizens of Wappinger, New  York  and
its surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With a membership of dedicated firefighters, the record of
the New Hackensack Fire Company in public service and fire protection is
one to be envied; for 24 hours a day, for 365 days a year, for 75 years,
whenever the alarm sounded, these noble volunteers left their homes  and
went to the aid of their neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brave firefighters of the New Hackensack Fire Company
are prepared to risk their lives every day to help  save  the  lives  of
others  and to protect homes and property from the destruction caused by
fire; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the skill and devoted  service  demonstrated
by individual firefighters, the New Hackensack Fire Company reflects the
history and development of firefighting over the past 75 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  New Hackensack Fire Company will be hosting a weekend
celebration  from  Friday,  June  7  through  Sunday,  June  9,  2024,
culminating  with  the  Dutchess County Volunteer Firefighters Parade on
Saturday, June 8, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, With no fire protection in the New Hackensack Fire District
prior to June 6, 1949,  fires  that  occurred  then  often  just  burned
naturally;  this  section  of  the  Town of Wappinger that was called No
Man's Land took in the majority of the town; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1948, several concerned citizens  that  resided  in  the
area  known  as Myers Corners and the hamlet of New Hackensack, embarked
on the journey of forming a fire district that would cover  and  provide
fire  protection  for  this No Man's Land area; No Man's Land officially
became a new Fire District on March 3, 1949, and five men were appointed
Fire Commissioners by the Town Board; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 6, 1949, about 40 local men  met  in  the  upstairs
meeting  room  of  the Mt. Hope Grange for the first meeting of the fire
company;  31  men  volunteered  and  signed  up  to  become  the  first
firefighters of the New Hackensack Fire Company; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Soon  thereafter,  the Commissioners of the New Hackensack
Fire Company purchased 1.9 acres of land; then, a 30 x 50 foot  building
was soon constructed which had room for 2 vehicles, and a kitchen; and
 
  WHEREAS, Expanding throughout the years, a Ladies Auxiliary was also
formed,  and  they became a very integral part of the fledgling new Fire
Company; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  May of 1950, the New Hackensack Fire Company purchased
its first fire engine, a Sanford Fire Equipment pumper with a 500-gallon
water tank, a 500 GPM pump mounted on a 1949 Ford F-7 flathead V8; their
technology and system has greatly improved as their members continue  to
innovate their department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body cannot express sufficient gratitude
to those devoted individuals who recognize that the preservation of life
and property is a sacred responsibility and who make that responsibility
their own by serving as firefighters; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  we  should
give  special  recognition  to  those  who  work  so assiduously for the
betterment of their communities, and  acknowledge  publicly  the  heroic
good  works  performed  by  the volunteer fire departments of this great
Empire State, their officers and auxiliaries; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
proudly  commemorate  the  75th  Anniversary  of the New Hackensack Fire
Company to be celebrated on June 7 to 9, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the New Hackensack Fire Company.
