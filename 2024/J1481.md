  COMMENDING  Fire  Captain  Gregory Baranowski upon
  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition  after  32 years of dedicated service to
  the Utica Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, The firefighters of New York State are renowned  throughout
the  Nation;  their  reputation  is  synonymous  with  excellence in the
arduous field of fire protection and prevention; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud to commend Fire
Captain Gregory Baranowski upon the  occasion  of  his  designation  for
special  recognition  after  32  years of dedicated service to the Utica
Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gregory Baranowski began his career of  serving  the  Utica
Community  on December 9, 1991; he was promoted to Lieutenant on July 9,
2004, and then for his continued impressive work ethic he  was  promoted
to Captain on June 17, 2016; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Residing  in Utica, Fire Captain Gregory Baranowski's last
day of Duty was on December 5, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  and  fire  departments  not  only
provide the critical service of fire protection but also engage in other
activities  of  great  benefit  and  importance  to the communities they
serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many firefighters have lost their lives to save  the  lives
of  others;  each and every day, they face danger and peril without fear
and perform their job with the utmost concern and professionalism; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Gregory Baranowski is such a firefighter; throughout 32 years of devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Fire Captain Gregory Baranowski for 32  years  of  distinguished
service; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Fire Captain Gregory Baranowski.
