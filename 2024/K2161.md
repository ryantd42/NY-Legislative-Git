BY: M. of A. Barrett
 
  COMMEMORATING the 200th Anniversary of the Town of
  Copake
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the Town of Copake; and
 
  WHEREAS,  2024  marks  the 200th anniversary of the Town of Copake's
incorporation as an independent township; and
 
  WHEREAS, Originally inhabited by the proud Mohican people, the  Town
of  Copake's  name  is derived from the word Achkookpeck, meaning "Snake
Pond", the original Mohican name for what we now call Copake Lake; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is thought that the land that would  later  become  this
historic  town  was  acquired under a land grant by Robert Livingston in
1686; on April 4, 1824, the Town of Copake  officially  split  from  the
Town  of  Granger,  now  the  Town of Taghkanic, becoming an independent
township which currently includes the hamlets of  Copake  Flats,  Copake
Falls, Craryville, and West Copake; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  December 1844, local Anti-Rent Movement members played
an important role in preventing the unconstitutional seizure  of  tenant
farmers' assets, thus contributing to an eventual end of the semi-feudal
control of Copake's farmland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  October 1902, the Copake Grange 935 was established to
assist individuals, families, and communities through grassroots action,
service, education, advocacy, cultural  activities,  entertainment,  and
agriculture awareness, and is still active to this day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Town of Copake's farms, historic Iron Works, and other
past  and  current  businesses  continue  to  be  a  distinguishing
characteristic  of the community, providing jobs, services, and benefits
for residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, This historic town  continues  to  celebrate  its  glorious
history,  hosting  museums  of  the  Copake  Iron  Works and the Roe Jan
Historical Society as well as a permanent local history exhibit  located
in the Town Hall; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Town of Copake's lakes, bucolic landscapes, and other
natural features have attracted visitors to  the  area  since  the  19th
century; and
 
  WHEREAS, Copake's various religious and civic organizations, and its
fire  department and community rescue squad, have enriched and protected
the community for generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Copake continues to evolve as it enters its  third  century
as  a  bucolic  community  rich with tradition, historical relevance and
heart; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the  Town  of  Copake;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Town of Copake.
