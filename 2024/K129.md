  RECOGNIZING March 3, 2023, as World Hearing Day
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of health  issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such concern, and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize March 3, 2023, as World Hearing Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Hearing  Day,  founded  by  the  World  Health
Organization, is observed annually on March 3rd to  raise  awareness  on
how  to  prevent  deafness  and hearing loss and promote ear and hearing
care across the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The sense of hearing plays a critical role in communication
and  personal  relationships,  overall  health  outcomes,  psychological
well-being and safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hearing  loss  has  been  tied  to impaired communication,
learning  and  academic  delays,  economic  loss,  falls,  depression,
isolation,  and cognitive decline; hearing loss can also be a symptom of
an underlying treatable medical condition, including infections, tumors,
otosclerosis, ototoxicity, and Meniere's disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Noise-induced  hearing  loss  is  a  preventable  and
significant,  yet  often unrecognized, health problem among New Yorkers,
and is a growing concern with adolescents; and
 
  WHEREAS, A hearing healthcare team  may  include  otolaryngologists,
audiologists, and hearing aid specialists; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Almost  all  types  of  hearing  loss  are treatable by an
audiologist; most hearing loss that is caused by  nerve  damage  can  be
treated  with  hearing  aids,  assistive  listening devices, and hearing
rehabilitation; and
 
  WHEREAS, A comprehensive hearing evaluation  includes  the  thorough
assessment,  rehabilitation  through  use  of  hearing  aids  and  other
devices, and counseling by educated and trained professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Every citizen of  New  York  State  deserves  access  to  a
high-quality hearing aid that is covered by insurance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this issue and more must be done to improve hearing health for  all  New
Yorkers  and  those  affected  by  such hearing health issues, including
patient  access  to  early  detection  and  intervention  by  healthcare
professionals  in  the  process  of  identification,  treatment,  and
rehabilitation of hearing loss; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
recognize March 3, 2023, as World Hearing Day; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the World Health Organization.
