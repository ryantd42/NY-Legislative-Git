 Introduced  by Sen. HARCKHAM -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  enacting  the  restriction of anticoagulant pesticide transactions for
  online and retail stores act
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "restriction of anticoagulant pesticide transactions for online  and
 retail stores act" or "RAPTORS act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  The legislature hereby finds and declares
 that it is the policy of this state to ensure that aquatic, terrestrial,
 and avian wildlife species remain a fully functional  component  of  the
 ecosystems  they  inhabit and move through in New York. It is the intent
 of this act to facilitate this goal by prohibiting  the  general  public
 from  purchasing and utilizing the world's deadliest rodenticides, noto-
 riously deployed via helicopter to "restore  the  ecosystem"  of  entire
 rat-infested islands and often killing scores of raptors and other birds
 in the process.
  This legislation also comes in the wake of Flaco's passing. Flaco, the
 Eurasian  eagle-owl  whose  escape from the Central Park Zoo and life on
 the loose captivated New York, had been exposed at the time of his death
 to four of the seven pesticides this bill restricts.  The  legislature
 takes  this  action  to protect all non-target species, not only raptors
 such as eagles, hawks, and owls, but also the thousands of children  and
 pets exposed to anticoagulants that poison control centers receive calls
 for each year.
  §  3. Section 33-1301 of the environmental conservation law is amended
 by adding a new subdivision 14 to read as follows:
  14. A. FOR ANY PERSON WITHIN THE STATE TO SELL, OFFER FOR SALE OR USE,
 DISTRIBUTE, USE, OR DEPLOY ANY PESTICIDE  OR  RODENTICIDE  CONTAINING  A
 RESTRICTED  SGAR  OR FGAR, IN ANY CONCENTRATION, UNLESS SUCH A PURCHASER
 OR USER HAS A VALID PURCHASE PERMIT OR CERTIFICATION IDENTIFICATION CARD
 PURSUANT TO SECTION 33-0903 OF THIS ARTICLE.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 AGRICULTURE  AND MARKETS, MAY PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO PERMIT
 THE USE OF PESTICIDES CONTAINING SGARS OR FGARS BY PESTICIDE APPLICATORS
 CERTIFIED PURSUANT TO SECTION 33-0905 OF THIS ARTICLE WHERE SUCH USE  IS
 NOT  REASONABLY  EXPECTED  TO  RESULT  IN SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS TO
