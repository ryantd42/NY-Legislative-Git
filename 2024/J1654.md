  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June  19,  2024,  as  World  Sickle  Cell  Disease
  Awareness Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are  set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim June 19, 2024, as World
Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sickle cell disease is a chronic hereditary blood  disorder
that  can  cause severe pain and result in damage to the brain and other
vital organs like the kidneys, liver, spleen and heart; and
 
  WHEREAS, People who have the  disease  but  do  not  experience  the
symptoms are said to have the sickle cell trait; currently, an estimated
100,000 Americans are living with the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Frequent pain episodes can result in necrosis of the hips,
knees, ankle and shoulder; there can  be  entrapment  of  blood  in  the
spleen,  severe anemia, acute lung complications (acute chest syndrome),
priapism in males, and difficult pregnancy for women  of  child  bearing
age; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  life-threatening complications can develop rapidly,
including infections of  the  blood  (sepsis),  meningitis  and  stroke;
stroke  can  be  either  silent  (no  overt  symptoms) or clinical (with
symptoms) and can affect children as young as 18 months; and
 
  WHEREAS, Up to 40% of children will have  had  either  a  silent  or
clinical stroke by the age of 18 and this impacts their ability to learn
and/or hold a job; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sickle  cell  disease  is  most  common  in  Africans  and
African-Americans,  but  the  disease  can  also  be  found  in  other
demographics,  primarily  in  South  and Central America, the Caribbean,
Mediterranean  countries  and  India;  approximately  1  in  12
African-Americans are diagnosed with the trait; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sickle cell disease affects approximately 100,000 Americans
and  10%  of  these  patients reside in New York State, and 80% of those
patients live in the New York City area; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sickle cell disease is the most costly per patient  to  New
York State Medicaid, costing $15,000/year/patient; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  only  known cure for sickle cell disease is through a
transplant of bone marrow or stem cells; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim June 19, 2024, as World
Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Day in the State of New York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
