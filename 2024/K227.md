  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 24, 2023, as Women in Agriculture Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  agricultural  industry is part of the foundation upon
which our distinct American heritage is built; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  24,  2023,  as  Women  in
Agriculture Day in the State of New York, in conjunction  with  National
Women in Agriculture Day and National Women's History Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hardworking American women farmers provide New York State,
the Nation, and much of the world with a safe, healthy, affordable,  and
abundant  food  supply;  currently, there are more than 1,200,000 female
agricultural producers in the United States, making up more than a third
of the agricultural producers in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2017, farms operated by women in the United States  sold
$148,000,000,000  in agricultural products, accounting for 38 percent of
the total agriculture sales in the United States for that year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Women working in agriculture also make a difference  across
the  United  States  in  various  commodity and industry fields, such as
research  and  development,  manufacturing,  sales  and  distribution,
agricultural  education,  agribusiness  and  advocacy,  which  extends
benefits to individuals across the globe through the international trade
of the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, women farmers are vital in fostering the  next
generation  of  the  agricultural  workforce  by  promoting  STEM  and
agricultural education and entrepreneurial and community initiatives and
by serving as mentors for 4-H, FFA, the  Cooperative  Extension  System,
and numerous postsecondary agricultural science educator programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  celebration of National Women's Agriculture Day is in
recognition of women farmers from all racial, ethnic and  socio-economic
backgrounds  and  walks  of life, who feed us and our families every day
and of the importance of agriculture as a vital  industry  and  economic
driver in New York State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 24, 2023,  as  Women
in  Agriculture  Day  in  the State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of  National  Agriculture  Day  and  Women's  History  Month,
honoring  and recognizing the important contributions of all branches of
farming to the health, economic  well-being,  environment,  beauty,  and
future of New York State; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York; USDA Farm Services Agency; and NY FarmNet.
