  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of subsection (a) of section 674 of  the

 paragraph 2 as amended by chapter 477 of the laws of 1998,  are  amended
 to read as follows:
  (1)  If, after having made a payroll, an employer has been required to
 deduct and withhold, but has  not  paid  over,  a  cumulative  aggregate
 amount  of  [seven hundred] ONE THOUSAND dollars or more of tax during a
 calendar quarter, such employer shall file a return  and  pay  over  the
 tax.  If an employer was required to remit a cumulative aggregate amount
 of less than fifteen thousand dollars  in  withholding  tax  during  the
 calendar  year  which precedes the previous calendar year, the tax shall
 be paid over on or before the fifth business day following the  date  of
 making such a payroll. If an employer was required to remit a cumulative
 aggregate amount more than or equal to fifteen thousand dollars in with-
 holding  tax during the calendar year which precedes the previous calen-
 dar year, the tax shall be paid over on or before the third business day
 following the date of making such a payroll. In the case of  an  "educa-
 tional  organization"  as  defined in paragraph two of subsection (a) of
