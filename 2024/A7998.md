 Introduced  by  M.  of A. BICHOTTE HERMELYN -- read once and referred to
  the Committee on Ways and Means
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to  contingency  planning
  by state agencies for extended federal government shutdowns
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that:
  a. Shutdowns of  operations  by  federal  agencies,  once  unthinkable
 events, are now occurring with increasing frequency and duration;
  b.  Such  shutdowns  may  cause  financial  hardships in this state to
 federal employees, whether furloughed or  required  to  report  to  work
 without  pay,  and  to  businesses  and  their employees involved in the
 provision of goods and  services  to  federal  agencies,  and  may  also
 adversely  impact  New  York's  economy, environment, and the people and
 institutions in this state who rely on programs and services provided by
 the federal government;
  c. In recent federal shutdowns  New  York  state  has  properly  taken
 several  steps to mitigate adverse impacts, but has not undertaken other
 remedial actions that have been determined to be essential in  similarly
 impacted states;
  d.  The  use of short-term continuing resolutions has made the federal
 budget process unpredictable, yet unlike other  states  New  York  state
 currently has no formal planning process for evaluation and coordination
 of potential mitigation measures; and
  e.  Federal  employees  and contractors and the general public in this
 state would benefit from a systematic effort to develop informed contin-
 gency plans to ensure state agencies are prepared to initiate  proactive
 measures to mitigate the impacts of an extended federal shutdown.
  Therefore  the legislature intends by this act to provide for a flexi-
 ble and effective contingency planning effort to  provide  guidance  and
 information to each appropriate state agency on the activities it should
