  WHEREAS,  Members  of the Armed Services from the State of New York,

  WHEREAS,  Giving  the ultimate sacrifice to protect our great Nation
and vulnerable people around the world, John Kehoe was killed in  action
Christmas morning in 1944; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  that  date,  he showed extraordinary heroism in action
when he encountered an intense flak on the bombing line to the target in
 
his aircraft; despite great damage to  his  aircraft,  Lieutenant  Kehoe

crawling to the aid of a wounded comrade in a direct line of fire from a
nearby enemy machine gun; with  utter  disregard  for  his  own  safety,
Private  First  Class Kehoe was instantly killed in his efforts, but his
