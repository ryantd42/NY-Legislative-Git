  LEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION memorializing Governor Kathy
  Hochul  to  proclaim  October 20-26, 2024, as Lead
  Poisoning Prevention Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York  takes  great  pride  in  recognizing
official  weeks established to increase awareness of serious issues that
affect the lives of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 20-26, 2024, as Lead Poisoning
Prevention  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observation of National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Lead Poisoning Prevention  Week  (NLPPW)  aims  to
help  individuals,  organizations,  and state and local governments work
together to reduce childhood exposure to lead; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is important to discuss lead  poisoning  prevention  and
response,  raise awareness about the sources of lead exposure, and share
helpful initiatives, policies, and resources; and
 
  WHEREAS, Human exposure to lead is a  global  public  health  issue;
inhaled  or consumed lead causes long-term consequences and irreversible
damage among children and adults; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lead poisoning at very high levels can be  fatal,  and  low
blood  lead  levels  can profoundly affect the brain and nervous system;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Childhood lead poisoning is considered the most preventable
environmental  disease  affecting  children,  and  data  shows  that
particularly  in  communities  like the City of Buffalo with old housing
stock, childhood lead poisoning remains a major risk for many  families;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends
early childhood lead screening to identify asymptomatic exposure as well
as targeted screening  of  at-risk  children  according  to  known  risk
patterns; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Moreover,  homes  built  before  1978 should be tested for
potential  lead  hazards,  and  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health
Administration  has  recommended  reducing or eliminating workplace lead
exposures through engineering controls such as  substitution,  isolation
and ventilation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  encourages cities across New York
State to implement policies that  take  a  proactive  approach  to  lead
mitigation  in  their  communities, like the Proactive Rental Inspection
program in Buffalo which authorizes the City to work with inspectors  to
help residents identify lead hazards and resources to mitigate them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body recognizes that more resources are
needed to address the true cost of lead remediation in both  public  and
private buildings across New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week, observed annually
during the last week of October,  addresses  the  public  health  burden
caused  by the widespread use of lead and lead products and advances the
goal of eliminating childhood lead poisoning in the United States;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October  20-26,  2024,  as
Lead  Poisoning  Prevention  Week  in  the  State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
