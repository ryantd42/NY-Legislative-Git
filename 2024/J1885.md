  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 10-16, 2024, as  Child  and  Adult  Care  Food
  Program Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative Body that those
individuals who faithfully serve the needs  of  the  community  and  its
citizens  with  steadfast  dedication  and  compassionate  commitment
profoundly strengthen our shared  commitment  to  family  and  community
life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 10-16, 2024, as
Child and Adult Care Food Program Week in the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction  with  the  observance of National Child and Adult Care Food
Program Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception  in  1968  by  the  Department  of
Agriculture,  the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) has provided
daily meals and snacks to children and adults; the program  has  reached
more  than  4,200,000 children and 138,000 adults in child care centers,
adult day care homes, and  after-school  programs  daily,  covering  the
costs of nearly 2,100,000,000 nutritious meals and snacks each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Research has displayed that the issue of childhood obesity
could  be  significantly  reduced  from  the  implementation  of  CACFP;
additionally,  the  program  increases  the  quality  of  child  care,
especially for children in low-income communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, 16,000 child care centers currently face permanent  closure
because of increased costs and burdens from the COVID-19 pandemic; CACFP
increases  the  effectiveness  and  viability  of child care centers and
adult day care homes for many providers, especially in rural areas; and
 
  WHEREAS, CACFP improves the cognitive, social,  emotional,  physical
health,  and  development  of  children;  participants  benefit  from  a
decreased likelihood of being hospitalized, an increased  likelihood  of
healthy  weight gain, and an increased likelihood of a more varied diet,
including increased consumption of vegetables; and
 
  WHEREAS, The two fundamental goals of the CACFP  are  that  children
serviced  by  this  program  will be well nourished during their crucial
years, while concurrently learning healthy eating  behaviors  that  will
last their lifetime; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their
profession,  certainly  have  earned the recognition and applause of all
the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 10-16, 2024, as
 
Child and Adult Care Food Program Week in the State of New York; and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York and the Department of Agriculture.
