 AN ACT to amend the public health  law,  in  relation  to  enacting  the
  reproductive freedom and equity program
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "reproductive freedom and equity program".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds:
  1.  Abortion  is  essential  health  care  and integral to the overall
 health and wellbeing of individuals.
  2. In 1970, New York legalized abortion,  three  years  prior  to  the
 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which enumerated a constitutional
 right to abortion care.
  3.  On  January  22,  2019,  the 36th anniversary of the Supreme Court
 Decision Roe v. Wade, New York modernized our state law to be consistent
 with the holdings of Roe v. Wade, articulating in that every  individual
 has a fundamental right to abortion.
  4. Despite a constitutional and state right to abortion care, barriers
 exist  that challenge an individual's ability to exercise their right to
 care.
  5. Individuals seeking abortion care can often experience obstacles to
 obtaining an abortion, whether that is an inability to afford  the  cost
 of  care, the distance one must travel, the costs associated with travel
 including transportation needs, childcare, lodging, lost wages and more.
  6. Barriers to  care  are  often  intensified  for  immigrants,  young
 people, people with disabilities and those living in rural areas.
  7. If the United States Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, access to
 care  across the country will dramatically shift with people in at least

 26 states - 36,000,000 women and individuals with the capacity to become
 pregnant - losing access to care.
  8.  It  is estimated that in the wake of state bans on abortion across
 the country, New York would be the nearest provider of care for  190,000
 to 280,000 more women of reproductive age.
  9.  Abortion  funds,  abortion  providers,  and  other community-based
 organizations have provided  essential  support  to  individuals  facing
 practical  support  needs.  These  entities  assist  individuals seeking
 abortion care including those living in New York, those traveling to New
 York and those who must travel outside of New York for care.
  10. With no direct state investment, safety-net abortion providers and
 abortion funds predominately rely on  philanthropic  giving  to  address
 unmet  needs  of  abortion  patients,  challenging their ability to meet
 present need, or any future increase demand for care.
  11. New York has a proud legacy of protecting and expanding access  to
 comprehensive  reproductive  and  sexual health care services, including
 abortion.
  12. In furtherance of that legacy, it is incumbent upon the  state  to
 adopt bold and innovative programs and policies that protect and advance
 reproductive freedom.
  §  3. Article 25-A of the public health law is amended by adding a new
