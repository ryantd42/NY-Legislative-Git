 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the Saint James  Evangelical  Lutheran
  Church of Saint James Long Island NY receive retroactive real property
  tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of  Smithtown,  county  of  Suffolk  is  hereby
 authorized to accept from the Saint James Evangelical Lutheran Church of
 Saint  James Long Island NY an application for exemption from real prop-
 erty taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real property  tax  law  for
 the  2022-2023  assessment  roll  for  a portion of the 2022-2023 school
 taxes and the 2023 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such  organ-
 ization  located at 200 7th Street, St. James, town of Smithtown, county
 of Suffolk, otherwise known as Suffolk tax map  district  0800,  section
 055.00, block 02.00, lots 055.000 and 056.000. If accepted, the applica-
 tion shall be reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxa-
 ble status dates established for such roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval by the Smithtown town board, may make appropriate correction to
 the subject roll. If such exemption is granted  and  such  organization,
 therefore, shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject roll, the
 applicable governing body or tax department may, in its sole discretion,
 provide  for  the  refund  of  those  taxes paid and cancel those taxes,
 fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
