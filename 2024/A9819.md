 ture hereby finds and declares all of the following:

 York state continues to exist, and this emergency puts individuals at  a
 heightened risk of death, illness, and economic hardship. These closures
 impact  both  public  and  private  healthcare  facilities, full-service
 hospitals, and critical care units.
  2. The legislature therefore finds  and  declares  that  in  order  to
 prevent  death, hardship, and other negative health outcomes to New York
 state residents, the provisions of this act  are  necessary  to  protect
 public  health, safety, and general welfare. The necessity in the public
 interest for the provisions hereinafter enacted is hereby declared as  a
 matter of legislative determination.
  §  3. The public health law is amended by adding a new section 2831 to
 read as follows:

 ATRIC EMERGENCY SERVICES, GENDER IDENTITY SERVICES, URGENT CARE SERVICES
 AND PEDIATRIC SERVICES.
  2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW, RULE  OR  REGULATION  TO  THE
 CONTRARY,  THE  STATE  SHALL  INSTITUTE  A  MORATORIUM ON THE CLOSURE OF
 HOSPITALS UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT COMPLETES A  STATEWIDE  REPORT  EXAMINING
