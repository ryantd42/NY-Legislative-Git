 DESIGNING  THE  NET  PRICE  CALCULATOR  DESCRIBED  HEREIN.  IF A COLLEGE
 UPDATES ITS ESTIMATED COST OF  ATTENDANCE,  EITHER  ON  ITS  WEBSITE  OR
 OTHERWISE, THE NET PRICE CALCULATOR SHALL INCORPORATE SUCH UPDATED COSTS
 INTO ITS CALCULATIONS.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
 on or before such effective date.
