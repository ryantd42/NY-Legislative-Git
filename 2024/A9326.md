 real property concerned. Such title shall be full and  complete  in  the
 absence of an agreement between tax districts as herein provided that it
 shall be subject to the tax liens of one or more tax districts. Upon the
 execution  of such deed, the grantee shall be seized of an estate in fee
 simple absolute in such parcel unless the conveyance is  expressly  made
 subject  to  tax  liens  of  a tax district as herein provided[, and all
 persons, including the state, infants, incompetents, absentees and  non-
 residents,  who  may have had any right, title, interest, claim, lien or
 equity of redemption in or upon such parcel, shall be barred and forever

 foreclosed of all such right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity  of
 redemption].
  3.  When  no  answer has been interposed. The court shall make a final
 judgment awarding to such tax district the possession of any  parcel  of

 provided in this title and as  to  which  no  answer  is  interposed  as
 provided  herein.  In  addition  thereto  such  judgment shall contain a
 direction to the enforcing officer  of  the  tax  district  to  prepare,
 execute  and  cause to be recorded a deed conveying to such tax district
 full and complete title to such parcel. Upon the execution of such deed,
 the tax district shall be seized of an estate in fee simple absolute  in
 such  parcel  [and  all  persons, including the state, infants, incompe-
 tents, absentees and non-residents who may have had  any  right,  title,
 interest,  claim,  lien  or  equity of redemption in or upon such parcel
 shall be barred and forever foreclosed of all such right, title,  inter-
 est, claim, lien or equity of redemption].
  §  3.  Subdivision 10 of section 1194 of the real property tax law, as
 amended by chapter 149 of the laws  of  2003,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  10.  The  conveyance made pursuant to a judgment in any action brought
 under this title shall vest in the purchaser [all] A PROPORTION  OF  THE
 right,  title,  interest,  claim,  lien  and equity of redemption in and
 against the real property sold of all parties to the action, and of  all
 persons  whose  right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemp-
 tion has accrued subsequent in time to the filing of the notice  of  the
 pendency of the action by assignment of an interest existing prior ther-
 eto  from one of the parties to the action or any or either of them. All
 such parties and persons shall [be barred and forever foreclosed by  the
 judgment  in such action of all] RETAIN A right, title, interest, claim,
 lien and equity of redemption in and to the real property  sold  or  any
 part  thereof IN PROPORTION TO THE SURPLUS EQUITY REMAINING IN THE PROP-
 ERTY AFTER SALE, except that the conveyance  shall  be  subject  to  all
 taxes  or  other legal charges of all tax districts which accrued subse-
 quent to the taxes or other legal charges which were the subject of  the
 action.  [Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision two of] PROCEEDS
 OF THE SALE SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  section  thirteen
 hundred  fifty-four  of  the real property actions and proceedings law[,
 this subdivision shall prevail].
  § 4. Subdivision 1 and paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section  1112
 of  the  real property tax law, as amended by chapter 532 of the laws of
 1994, are amended to read as follows:
  1.  When a tax district holds more than one tax lien against a parcel,
 the liens need not be redeemed simultaneously. However, the liens [must]
 SHALL be redeemed in [reverse] chronological order,  so  that  the  lien
 with  the  [most  recent]  EARLIEST lien date is redeemed first, and the
 lien with the  [earliest]  MOST  RECENT  lien  date  is  redeemed  last.
 Notwithstanding  the  redemption  of  one or more of the liens against a
 parcel as provided herein, the enforcement process shall proceed accord-
 ing to the provisions of this article as long  as  the  [earliest]  MOST
 RECENT lien remains unredeemed.
  (a)  When  one or more liens against a parcel are redeemed as provided
 herein, but the [earliest] MOST  RECENT  lien  remains  unredeemed,  the
 receipt  issued  to  the  person  redeeming shall include a statement in
 substantially the following form:  "This parcel remains subject  to  one
 or  more  delinquent tax liens. The payment you have made will not post-
 A. 9326  5
 
 pone the enforcement of the outstanding lien or liens. Continued failure
 to pay the entire amount owed will result in the loss of the property."
  §  5. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 1125 of the real prop-
 erty tax law, as added by chapter 415 of the laws of 2006  and  subpara-

 IS DIRECTED MAY REDEEM THE PARCEL IN QUESTION OR SERVE A  DULY  VERIFIED
 ANSWER  TO  THE  PETITION  OF FORECLOSURE UNTIL EITHER THE THIRTIETH DAY
 AFTER SUCH POSTING OR DELIVERY, OR THE DATE SPECIFIED BY THE  NOTICE  OF
 FORECLOSURE AS THE LAST DAY FOR REDEMPTION, WHICHEVER IS LATER.
  (II)  Such notice shall ALSO be sent to each such party both by certi-
 fied mail and ordinary first class mail, subject to  the  provisions  of
 subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. The notice shall be deemed received
 unless  both  the certified mailing and the ordinary first class mailing
 are returned by the United States postal service within forty-five  days
 after  being  mailed. In that event, the enforcing officer or his or her
 agent shall attempt to obtain an alternative mailing  address  from  the
 United  States postal service. When notice is required to be sent to the
 commissioner of taxation and finance, an alternative notice may be  used
 by  the enforcing officer, in accordance with instructions prescribed by
 the commissioner of taxation and finance.
  [(ii)] (III) If an alternative mailing address is found, the enforcing
 officer shall cause the notice to  be  mailed  to  such  owner  at  such
 address  both  by  certified  mail  and  by  ordinary  first class mail.
 Notwithstanding any provision of law to the  contrary,  such  owner  may
 redeem  the  parcel  in  question or serve a duly verified answer to the
 petition of foreclosure until either the thirtieth day after such  mail-
 ing,  or the date specified by the notice of foreclosure as the last day
 for redemption, whichever is later.
  [(iii) If no alternative mailing address can be  found,  then  in  the
 case  of  an  owner,  the  enforcing  officer shall cause a copy of such
 notice to be posted as provided herein on  the  property  to  which  the
 delinquent  tax  lien relates; in the case of a non-owner, the enforcing
 officer shall cause a copy of such notice to be posted  in  his  or  her
 office and in the office of the clerk of the court in which the petition
 of  foreclosure  has been filed. Notwithstanding any provision of law to
 the contrary, the party to whom such notice is directed may  redeem  the
 parcel  in  question  or serve a duly verified answer to the petition of
 foreclosure until either the thirtieth day after such posting or  deliv-
 ery,  or the date specified by the notice of foreclosure as the last day
 for redemption, whichever is later.]
  (iv) Where an owner is listed as "unknown" on the  tax  roll  and  the
 name  of  such  owner  cannot  be found in the public record, the notice
 shall be mailed to the property address by  ordinary  first  class  mail
 addressed  to "occupant" and a copy thereof shall be posted on the prop-
 erty to which the tax lien relates.
  § 6. Subdivision 3 of section 1180 of the real property  tax  law,  as

 [full]  DIFFERENTIAL  value  [of]  BETWEEN  THAT  TOTAL TAX DEBT AND THE
 MARKET  VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AT THE TIME OF FORECLOSURE ATTRIBUTABLE TO
 any buildings, timber or other products  cut  or  destroyed  or  removed
 therefrom,  from  the date of the filing of the list of delinquent taxes
 to the termination of such action or proceeding, and may  be  restrained
 by  injunction from committing any waste thereon. WHERE THE VALUE OF THE
 PROPERTY AT THE TIME OF FORECLOSURE EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF THE TOTAL  TAX
 DEBT,  THERE  SHALL  BE  NO LIABILITY FOR DESPOLIATION. THE VALUE OF THE
 PROPERTY AT THE TIME OF FORECLOSURE MAY BE MEASURED BY EITHER THE AMOUNT
 GENERATED BY SALE OF THE PROPERTY AT PUBLIC AUCTION, IN ACCORDANCE  WITH
 SECTION  ELEVEN  HUNDRED  SIXTY-SIX  OF  THIS  TITLE,  OR  BY  VALUATION
 PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE FIVE OF THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCE-
 DURE LAW.
  § 7. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal  of  any  rule  or regulation necessary for the implementation of
 this act on its effective date are authorized to be made  and  completed
 on or before such effective date.
