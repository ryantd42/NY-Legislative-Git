  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 trailer in accordance with provisions of this article: The annual fee of
 twenty-eight dollars and seventy-five cents. However, upon  the  request
 of the applicant upon the registration or renewal of a registration of a
 nineteen hundred eighty-nine or later model year semitrailer, such semi-
 trailer  may  be  registered for a period of not less than five and one-
 half nor more than six and  one-half  years  for  a  fee  of  eighty-six

 provisions and pursuant to regulations and limitations to be established
 by the commissioner and upon payment of a fee of two dollars and  thirty
 cents  therefor  a  temporary permit to move a coach or house trailer on
 the public highways from one site to another  shall  be  issued  to  the
 owner  thereof upon application therefor. Such application shall be made
 in the manner prescribed by the commissioner.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately, and shall  apply  to  all
 registrations and reregistrations issued on or after such date.
