 such hearing shall be held in accordance  with  such  notice;  provided,
 however,  that if the corporation determines that trade secrets or other
 confidential information about the prospective purchaser's  or  lessee's

 that  a  public hearing will be held to consider the plan at a specified
 time and place on a date not less  than  [ten]  FOURTEEN  BUSINESS  days
 after such publication;
