 letting of such contracts by counties except that  where  the  estimated
 expense  of  a  contract  does not exceed [fifteen] THIRTY-FIVE thousand

 any  contract that it would not be in the public interest to comply with
 this section and the governing body of each county, by resolution,  rule
 or  regulation  adopted by the vote of two-thirds of the whole number of
 votes authorized to be cast by all of the members of such body,  concurs
 in  such  determination,  then  it  may enter into such contract without
 public letting as authorized by said resolution, rules and  regulations;
 (ii)  in  conjunction with one or more regional off-track betting corpo-
 rations pursuant to this section; or (iii) in  the  manner  provided  in
