  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Civil Service and
  Pensions
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil service law, in relation to safe staffing  for
  public employees of institutional settings

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. It is in the interest and the responsi-
 bility of the state and local governments to provide for a safe,  stable
 and  humane environment for residents and staff of the custodial facili-
 ties within the state of New York. The maintenance of  order,  security,
 safety  and  care for all in custodial facilities currently falls upon a
 workforce stretched beyond its  limits.  Recruitment  and  retention  of
 staff  is  at  a  crisis  at all levels and in all facilities within the
 state. Double and triple shifts are the norm, creating unsafe conditions
 for residents and staff. Therefore, it is in the interest of  the  state
 to set maximum overtime levels to ensure staff safety and a humane envi-
 ronment for residents of custodial facilities.
  §  2.  The civil service law is amended by adding a new section 137 to
 read as follows:
  § 137. SAFE STAFFING FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OF  INSTITUTIONAL  SETTINGS.
