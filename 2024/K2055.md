  LEIGLSLATIVE  RESOLUTION  congratulating  the Hobart
  College Men's Ice Hockey Team upon the  occasion  of
  winning  their  second consecutive NCAA Division III
  National Championship
 
  WHEREAS, The New  York  State  Assembly  celebrates  and  recognizes
excellence  in  athletic  competition, especially when teams at colleges
and universities of our state win a  national  collegiate  championship;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  For ice hockey players, the road to such excellence begins
when young skaters first  lace  up  the  skates  playing  youth  hockey,
traveling  from rink to rink, competing at every level, developing their
skills and dreaming of winning  games,  tournaments,  and  championships
earned through years of practice, dedication, and commitment to the game
they love; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is justly proud to congratulate the
Hobart College Men's Ice Hockey Team's winning  the  NCAA  Division  III
National  Championship,  with  a  thrilling  2-0 victory against Trinity
College at the March 23, 2024 title game played at Trinity's home  rink;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  exceptional  accomplishment  marked  Hobart's second
consecutive NCAA ice hockey championship, becoming only the 12th college
in collegiate hockey history to win back to back NCAA crowns, capping  a
28-2-1  season where the Statesman were ranked number one throughout the
season, a year in which Hobart went undefeated in their last  25  games,
last  having lost a game on November 11th and sharing the record for the
10th longest undefeated streak in Division III history; and
 
  WHEREAS, The distinctive style of the this championship  program  is
led  by  the  guiding  vision  of  Head  Coach  Mark  Taylor, repeatedly
recognized with Coach of the Year honors by the AHCA and  the  USCHO.com
as  well  as honored with the 2024 New England Hockey Conference's Coach
of the Year Award; and
 
  WHEREAS, Coach Taylor's style of intense two-way hockey is  embraced
by every player on the roster, each skilled at immediately transitioning
from  offense to defense with the skip of a puck making shifts extremely
difficult for opposing teams and backed by outstanding goaltending;  the
results,  only  30  goals  given  up  in  31  games - the second best in
Division III history, Hobart killed 92  of  their  opponent's  95  power
plays breaking the NCAA season record and recording 13 shutouts matching
the NCAA Division III record; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Congratulations  also  go  to  Hobart's  home  rink  fans
supporting this year's home ice 17-0-0 record at the  City  of  Geneva's
storied  "Cooler" Arena with enthusiasm and appreciation, where the home
ice advantage for the last two seasons is an amazing 36-0-0; and
 
  WHEREAS, With every shift, every period, and every game, those  fans
know  of the championship caliber of each of the players we honor today:

the  season,  scoring  161 goals while only allowing 30 goals against in
the season's 31 games,  allowing  only  4  goals  against  in  the  NCAA
tournament,  and  winning  a nationally noted four-overtime quarterfinal
NCAA tournament  game  becoming  the  second  longest  contest  in  NCAA
Division III Men's Hockey game lasting 135:17 minutes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Celebration  and  recognition is shared by the current and
past parents, alumni players, college leadership, and boosters who  have
supported  Hobart  Ice  Hockey  for  decades,  and  we  offer  special
recognition to  former  Athletic  Director  Bill  Stiles  who  made  the
decision  in  1977 to elevate the decades-old Hobart Club Hockey Team to
the NCAA Division III program we honor today; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body  recognizes  and  honors  the  Hobart
Men's Ice Hockey Team for this second consecutive national title and how
