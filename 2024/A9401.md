  §  58.  Liability  of state for damages. The state shall not be liable
 for damages suffered by  any  person  from  defects  in  state  highways

 WHEN THE DEFECT FOUND TO CAUSE THE DAMAGES WAS REPORTED BY TELEPHONE  OR
 BY  AN ONLINE REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE TELEPHONE NUMBER OR WEBSITE DESIG-
 NATED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO RECEIVE SUCH REPORTS AND FOURTEEN  DAYS  HAVE
 ELAPSED  FROM  THE  DATE THE INITIAL REPORT WAS SUBMITTED AND THE DEFECT

 fifteenth  day  of  November  on  such highways as are maintained by the
 state under such system as the commissioner of transportation may  adopt
 pursuant  to  section  twelve,  but the liability for such damages shall
 otherwise  remain  as  now  provided  by  law,  notwithstanding  the

 of  pavement  constructed  or improved at the expense of the state, if a

 it shall have become a law.  Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation  of  this act on its effective date are authorized to be made and
