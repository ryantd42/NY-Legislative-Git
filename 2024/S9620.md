 Introduced  by  Sen.  COONEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive  law,  in  relation  to  establishing  the
  distributed generation for community solar siting commission
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Legislative intent. The Legislature finds and declares  the
 following:
  It  is  the policy of the State of New York as laid out in the Climate
 Leadership and Community Protection act (CLCPA) as well as  other  laws,
 regulations  and  proceedings  of the public service commission, that by
 the year 2040, New York State will derive 100% of its energy from carbon
 free sources with an interim goal of 70% by 2030. Further, the state has
 and continues to move toward a carbon free  future  and  a  carbon  free
 economy.  As  a  part  of this movement, NYS has adopted legislation and
 regulations related to community solar projects and worked  through  the
 NY  Sun  program  and  other means to assist in funding more distributed
 solar projects and encouraging investment and job creation in the  clean
 energy  sector.  Audits by the Comptroller and reports from NYSERDA and
 other agencies have, however, begun to show  a  troubling  pattern.  New
 York is not on track to meet its energy goals, with many projects in the
 pipeline  but  fewer and fewer coming to fruition and completion. If our
 state does not triple its renewable energy capacity in the coming years,
 we will miss our 2030 goal. "Distributed Generation, including Community
 Distributed Generation ("CDG")" for "Community Solar" is one of the keys
 to New York meeting its stated goals, and yet, in this important sector,
 development is slowing, and local opposition is mounting.  The  legisla-
 ture  wishes to discover the causes of this slowdown and evaluate policy
 recommendations that  can  accelerate  the  siting  of  community  solar
 projects in support of our 2030 and 2040 goals.
  § 2. The executive law is amended by adding a new article 49-D to read
 as follows:
  ARTICLE 49-D
  DISTRIBUTED GENERATION FOR COMMUNITY SOLAR SITING COMMISSION
 SECTION 997. DISTRIBUTED  GENERATION  FOR COMMUNITY SOLAR SITING COMMIS-
  SION.
  997-A. POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.
