  read once and referred to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to elec-
  tronic identification of hunting license holders and  the  tagging  of
  deer and bears
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subparagraph 1 of paragraph a of subdivision 1, subdivision
 2 and subdivision 3 of section 11-0705 of the environmental conservation
 law, as amended by section 21 of part R of chapter 58  of  the  laws  of
 2013, are amended to read as follows:
  (1)  have  such license, tag or privilege on the holder's person IN AN
 ELECTRONIC OR OTHER ACCEPTABLE FORMAT  PURSUANT  TO  REGULATIONS,  while
 exercising  any  privilege  of that license stated in section 11-0701 of
 this title, or while assisting or accompanying a  minor  in  hunting  as
 provided in section 11-0929 of this article, and
  2. [a. Holders of a hunting license while exercising the privileges of
 such license, shall have the back tag issued with their license attached
 to  and displayed on the back of the outer garment between the shoulders
 in such manner that all figures are plainly visible at all times.
  b. The license tag for the current year only shall be displayed.
  c. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs a and b of this subdi-
 vision, a license holder shall not be required to display  such  license
 tag in the Northern Zone or the Catskill Park.
  3.] Failure of a licensee to have the holder's license, tag or license
 with  bowhunting  and/or muzzle-loading privilege included, on the hold-
 er's person IN AN ELECTRONIC OR  OTHER  ACCEPTABLE  FORMAT  PURSUANT  TO
 REGULATIONS, while hunting, fishing or trapping, is presumptive evidence
 that  the  holder  is  hunting, fishing or trapping, as the case may be,
 without holding the license, tag or license and  bowhunting  or  muzzle-
 loading  privilege  required by subdivision 6 of section 11-0703 of this
 title.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 the  taker] OUT THE DEER TAG IN AN ELECTRONIC OR OTHER ACCEPTABLE FORMAT
 as provided in regulations of the department.  [The  taker  shall  imme-
 diately  cut out or mark the month and date of kill on the tag and shall
 attach it to the deer, except that it need not be attached to  the  deer
 while  it  is being dragged or physically carried by the taker to a camp
 or point where other  transportation  is  available.]  The  taker  shall
 report  details of the location and date of harvest and data on the deer
 as required by regulation.

 tag [issued to taker] IN AN ELECTRONIC OR  OTHER  ACCEPTABLE  FORMAT  as

 details of the location and date of harvest and  data  on  the  bear  as
 required by regulation.

 section two of this act shall take effect August 1, 2025.
