 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to

  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law and shall expire and be deemed  repealed  on  the  one
 hundred eightieth day after it shall have become a law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would permit members employed as security hospital treatment
 assistants  by the Office of Mental Health a one-time election to switch
 their current plan from an age-55 plan to a  25-year  service  plan,  or
 vice  versa.  Currently,  members  so  employed must elect plan coverage
 within one year from their employment in such  title.  The  election  to
 switch  plans will be irrevocable and the member will forfeit all rights
 and privileges of their current plan. This bill has a  sunset  provision
 of 180 days.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $1.6 million in
 the annual contributions of the State of New York for  the  fiscal  year
 ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the bill-
 ing rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $18.4 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
  These estimated costs are based on 696 affected  members  employed  by
 the  Office  of  Mental  Health, with annual salary of approximately $73
 million as of March 31, 2022.
