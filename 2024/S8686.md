 AN ACT to authorize the city of Buffalo to offer an optional twenty year
  retirement plan to firefighters Rhiannon Maguire and Jeffrey Brett
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  city of Buffalo, in the county of Erie, a participating employer in
 the New York state and local police and fire  retirement  system,  which
 previously  elected  to  offer the optional twenty year retirement plan,
 established pursuant to section 384-d of the retirement and social secu-
 rity law, to firefighters employed by such city, is hereby authorized to
 make participation in  such  plan  available  to  Rhiannon  Maguire  and
 Jeffrey  Brett,  firefighters  employed by the city of Buffalo, who, for
 reasons not ascribable to their own negligence, failed to make a  timely
 application to participate in such optional twenty year retirement plan.
 The  city  of Buffalo may so elect by filing with the state comptroller,
 within nine months of the effective date of this act,  a  resolution  of
 its  own common council together with certification that such firefight-
 ers did not bar themselves from participation in such retirement plan as
 a result of their own  negligence.  Thereafter,  such  firefighters  may
 elect to be covered by the provisions of section 384-d of the retirement
 and  social  security  law, and shall be entitled to the full rights and
 benefits associated with coverage under such section as well as  section
 384-e  of  such  law,  by filing a request to that effect with the state
 comptroller within one year of the effective date of this act.
  § 2. All employer past service costs associated with implementing  the
 provisions  of this act shall be borne by the city of Buffalo and may be
 amortized over a ten year period.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow the City of Buffalo to reopen the provisions  of
 section 384-d, together with 384-e, of the Retirement and Social Securi-
 ty Law for firefighters Jeffrey Brett and Rhiannon Maguire.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 8686  2
 
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $10,000 in the
 annual contributions of the City of Buffalo for the fiscal  year  ending
 March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the billing rates
 and salary of Jeffrey Brett and Rhiannon Maguire change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past service cost of approximately $357,000 which will be
 borne by the City of Buffalo as  a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes  that  payment  will be made on February 1, 2025. If the City of
 Buffalo elects to amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for
 each year including interest would be $45,600.
