 counting only days attributable to adjournment requests made  solely  at
 the  request  of  the respondent and not counting an initial adjournment
 requested by a respondent unrepresented by counsel for  the  purpose  of
 securing counsel, whichever occurs sooner, the court may, upon consider-
 ation  of  the  equities,  direct  that the respondent, upon a motion on
 notice made by the petitioner, deposit with the court sums  of  rent  or
 use  and  occupancy  that  shall  accrue  subsequent  to the date of the
 court's order, which may be established without the use of expert testi-
 mony. The court shall not order deposit or payment of use and  occupancy
 where  the  respondent  can  establish, to the satisfaction of the court
 that respondent has properly interposed one of the following defenses or
 established the following grounds:
  (i) the petitioner is not a proper party to the proceeding pursuant to
 section seven hundred twenty-one of this article; or
  (ii) (A) actual eviction, or  (B)  actual  partial  eviction,  or  (C)
 constructive eviction; and respondent has quit the premises; or
  (iii)  a  defense pursuant to section one hundred forty-three-b of the
 social services law; or
  (iv) a defense based upon the existence of  hazardous  or  immediately
 hazardous  violations  of  the  housing  maintenance code in the subject
 apartment or common areas; or
  (v) a colorable defense of rent overcharge; or
  (vi) a defense that the unit is in violation of the building's certif-
 icate of occupancy or is otherwise illegal under the  multiple  dwelling
 law or the New York city housing maintenance code; or
  (vii) the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the respondent.
  Two  adjournments  shall  not  include  an  adjournment requested by a
 respondent unrepresented by counsel for the purpose of securing  counsel
 made on a return date of the proceeding, INCLUDING AN ADJOURNMENT PURSU-
 ANT  TO  PARAGRAPH  (B) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION. Such rent or
 use and occupancy sums shall be deposited with the clerk of the court or
 paid to such other person or entity,  including  the  petitioner  or  an
 agent  designated  by  the division of housing and community renewal, as
 the court shall direct or shall be expended for such  emergency  repairs
 as the court shall approve.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to actions
 and proceedings pending on and after such date.
