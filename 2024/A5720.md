 Introduced by M. of A. ARDILA -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Housing
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  real property tax law, in relation to requiring
  affordable housing projects to calculate and only use the area  median
  income  for  the  specific zip code that the project is located in for
  determining affordability

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 1 of section 421-a of the real property tax law
 is amended by adding a new paragraph e to read as follows:
  E.  "AREA MEDIAN INCOME (AMI)." WHENEVER CALCULATING THE AFFORDABILITY
 OF A PROJECT, AMI SHALL BE BASED SOLELY ON THE SPECIFIC ZIP  CODE  WHERE
 THE PROJECT SHALL BE LOCATED.
  §  2.  All affordable housing projects, including, but not limited to,
 421-a projects, shall only use the area  median  income  (AMI)  for  the
 specific zip code that the project is located in for determining afford-
 ability.  However, for any affordable housing project in the five coun-
 ties that make up New York City, including, but not limited to  a  421-a
 project,  that  is  being  located  in a zip code where the AMI for that
 specific zip code is higher than  the  New  York  City  Region  AMI,  as
 defined  by  HUD,  the AMI for the affordability project, including, but
 not limited to a 421-a project, will be the AMI that HUD has  determined
 to be the New York City Region AMI.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
