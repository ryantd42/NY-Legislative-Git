 AN ACT to amend the real property tax law, in relation to tax  abatement
  for  rent-controlled  and  rent  regulated property occupied by senior
  citizens or persons with disabilities

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph g of subdivision 3 of section 467-b of the real
 property tax law, as amended by chapter 553 of  the  laws  of  2015,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  g. notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where a
 head  of  the household holds a current, valid tax abatement certificate
 and, after the effective date of this paragraph, there  is  a  permanent
 decrease  in  the  combined income of all members of the household in an
 amount which exceeds twenty percent of such  income  as  represented  in
 such  head of the household's last approved application for a tax abate-
 ment certificate or for renewal thereof, such head of the household  may
 apply for a redetermination of the amount set forth therein. Upon appli-
 cation,  such  amount  shall  be  redetermined so as to re-establish the
 ratio of adjusted rent to income which existed at the time  of  approval
 of  such  head  of  the household's last application for a tax abatement
 certificate or for renewal thereof; provided, however, that in no  event
 shall  the  amount of the adjusted rent be redetermined to be (i) in the
 case of a head of the household who does not receive a monthly allowance
 for shelter pursuant to the social services law, less than one-third  of
 the  combined income of all members of the household unless such head of
 the household has been granted a rent increase exemption order  that  is
 in  effect  as of January first, two thousand fifteen or takes effect on
 or before July first, two thousand fifteen; or (ii) in  the  case  of  a
 head  of  the  household  who  receives  a monthly allowance for shelter
 pursuant to the social services law, less than the maximum allowance for

 shelter which such head of the household is entitled to receive pursuant
 to such law.  WHEN A REDETERMINATION OF THE ADJUSTED RENT HAS BEEN  MADE
 PURSUANT  TO  THIS PARAGRAPH, SUCH REDETERMINATION MAY, AT LOCAL OPTION,
 BE  MADE RETROACTIVE TO THE DATE ON WHICH THERE WAS A PERMANENT DECREASE
 IN THE COMBINED INCOME OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD; PROVIDED, HOWEV-
 ER, THAT THE LOOK-BACK PERIOD FOR THE RETROACTIVE  BENEFIT  PURSUANT  TO
 THE  REDETERMINATION SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE DATE UPON WHICH THE HEAD OF
 HOUSEHOLD FILED FOR THE MOST RECENTLY APPROVED APPLICATION  OR  RENEWAL.
 For purposes of this paragraph, a decrease in the combined income of all
 members  of  the household shall not include any decrease in such income
 resulting from the manner in which income is calculated pursuant to  any
 amendment  to  paragraph c of subdivision one of this section made on or
 after April first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven. For purposes  of  this
 paragraph,  "adjusted  rent"  shall mean maximum rent or legal regulated
 rent less the amount set forth in a tax abatement certificate.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
