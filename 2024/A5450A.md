 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

 A. 5450--A  2
 
  3. A MEMBER, UPON APPLICATION TO A PUBLIC  RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  OF  THE
 STATE,  MAY  OBTAIN  ONE  YEAR OF SERVICE CREDIT FOR EVERY FIVE YEARS OF
 VOLUNTEER FIRE OR EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDED  IN  THE  STATE.  A  MEMBER
 SHALL  BE LIMITED UNDER THIS SECTION TO OBTAIN NOT MORE THAN THREE YEARS
 OF  SERVICE  CREDIT  FOR  A  TOTAL OF FIFTEEN YEARS OF VOLUNTEER FIRE OR
 EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDED.  PROOF  OF  VOLUNTEER  FIRE  OR  EMERGENCY
 SERVICE SHALL BE CERTIFIED BY THE VOLUNTEER AGENCY FOR WHICH SUCH MEMBER
 VOLUNTEERED HIS OR HER TIME.
  4.  A  MEMBER  SHALL HAVE AT LEAST FIVE YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE, NOT
 INCLUDING SERVICE GRANTED HEREUNDER, TO BE ELIGIBLE  TO  RECEIVE  CREDIT
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.
  5.  TO  OBTAIN CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, A MEMBER SHALL PAY THE
 APPROPRIATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM, FOR DEPOSIT IN THE FUND USED  TO  ACCUMU-
 LATE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS, A SUM EQUAL TO THE PRODUCT OF THE NUMBER OF
 YEARS  OF  VOLUNTEER  FIRE  OR EMERGENCY SERVICE BEING CLAIMED AND THREE
 PERCENT OF SUCH MEMBER'S COMPENSATION EARNED DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS OF
 CREDITED SERVICE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE THAT  SUCH  MEMBER  MADE
 APPLICATION FOR CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION. IF PERMITTED BY RULE OR
 REGULATION  OF  THE  APPLICABLE RETIREMENT SYSTEM, A MEMBER MAY PAY SUCH
 MEMBER COSTS BY PAYROLL DEDUCTION FOR A PERIOD WHICH  SHALL  NOT  EXCEED
 THE  TIME  PERIOD  OF VOLUNTEER FIRE OR EMERGENCY SERVICE TO BE CREDITED
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION. IN THE EVENT SUCH MEMBER LEAVES  THE  EMPLOYER
 PAYROLL  PRIOR  TO  COMPLETION  OF  PAYMENT, HE OR SHE SHALL FORWARD ALL
 REMAINING REQUIRED PAYMENTS TO THE APPROPRIATE RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  PRIOR
 TO  THE  EFFECTIVE DATE OF RETIREMENT. IF THE FULL AMOUNT OF SUCH MEMBER
 COSTS IS NOT PAID TO THE APPROPRIATE  RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  PRIOR  TO  THE
 MEMBER'S  RETIREMENT,  THE  AMOUNT  OF SERVICE CREDITED SHALL BE PROPOR-
 TIONAL TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENTS MADE PRIOR TO RETIREMENT.
  6. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CREDIT GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, WHEN
 ADDED TO CREDIT GRANTED FOR VOLUNTEER FIRE OR EMERGENCY SERVICE WITH ANY
 RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF THIS STATE PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER PROVISION OF  LAW,
 EXCEED A TOTAL OF THREE YEARS.
  7.  TO  BE  ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR VOLUNTEER FIRE OR EMERGENCY
 SERVICE UNDER THIS SECTION, A MEMBER SHALL  MAKE  APPLICATION  FOR  SUCH
 CREDIT BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF RETIREMENT.
  8.  ALL  COSTS  FOR  SERVICE  CREDITED  TO  A  MEMBER PURSUANT TO THIS
 SECTION, OTHER THAN THE MEMBER COSTS SET FORTH IN  SUBDIVISION  FIVE  OF
 THIS SECTION, SHALL BE PAID BY THE STATE AND ALL EMPLOYERS WHICH PARTIC-
 IPATE IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM IN WHICH SUCH MEMBER IS GRANTED CREDIT.
  9.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, IN THE EVENT OF DEATH
 PRIOR TO RETIREMENT, AMOUNTS PAID BY A MEMBER FOR THE PURCHASE OF VOLUN-
 TEER FIRE OR EMERGENCY SERVICE CREDIT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL  BE
 REFUNDED,  WITH  INTEREST, TO THE EXTENT THE VOLUNTEER FIRE OR EMERGENCY
 SERVICE PURCHASED WITH SUCH AMOUNTS DOES NOT  PRODUCE  A  GREATER  DEATH
 BENEFIT  THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE HAD SUCH MEMBER NOT PURCHASED SUCH
 CREDIT.
  10. SERVICE CREDIT GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE  CREDITA-
 BLE IN ANY SPECIAL TWENTY OR TWENTY-FIVE YEAR RETIREMENT PLAN.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would allow members of any New York State retirement system
 to purchase service credit for time rendered in volunteer fire or  emer-
 gency  service. A member may obtain one year of service credit for every
 five years of volunteer fire or emergency service, not to  exceed  three
 years of total credit. Members must have at least five years of credited
 service  (not including volunteer service). Members would be required to
 A. 5450--A  3
 
 make a payment of three percent of their most  recent  compensation  per
 year  of  additional service credit granted by this bill. Service credit
 would be creditable  on  regular  age-based  and  special  service-based
 plans.  Members may not be credited more than one year for all service
 obtained in a calendar year.
  This bill would not be consistent with the Retirement System's  policy
 that  service  credit may only be granted for service for which a salary
 has been paid.
  Insofar as this proposal affects the New York State and Local  Employ-
 ees' Retirement System (NYSLERS), all costs would be shared by the State
 of  New  York  and  the local participating employers in the NYSLERS. If
 enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it is  estimated  that  the
 past  service  cost will be 18% of an affected member's compensation for
 each year of service credit that is purchased.
  Insofar as this proposal affects the New York State and  Local  Police
 and  Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), all costs would be shared by the
 State of New York and the local participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
 If enacted during the 2023 legislative session, it is estimated that the
 past service cost will be 22% of an affected member's  compensation  for
 each year of service credit that is purchased.
  Further,  we  anticipate  additional administrative costs to implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
