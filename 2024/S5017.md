  Section 1. Subdivision 3 of section 150.10 of the  criminal  procedure
 law is REPEALED.
  § 2. Subdivision 1 of section 150.20 of the criminal procedure law, as
 amended  by  section  1-a of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019,
 subparagraph (viii) as amended and subparagraphs (ix), (x) and  (xi)  of
 paragraph  (b)  as added by section 1 of subpart B of part UU of chapter
 56 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  1. [(a)] Whenever a police officer is authorized pursuant  to  section
 140.10 of this title to arrest a person without a warrant for an offense
 other than a class A, B, C or D felony or a violation of section 130.25,
 130.40,  205.10,  205.17,  205.19 or 215.56 of the penal law, he [shall,
 except as set out in paragraph (b) of  this  subdivision]  OR  SHE  MAY,
 subject  to  the  provisions  of  subdivisions three and four of section

 S. 5017  2

  (i)  the  person  has  one or more outstanding local criminal court or
 superior court warrants;
  (ii)  the person has failed to appear in court proceedings in the last
 two years;
  (iii) the person has been given a reasonable opportunity to make their
 verifiable identity and a method of contact known, and has  been  unable
 or  unwilling  to  do  so,  so  that  a custodial arrest is necessary to
 subject the individual  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court.  For  the
 purposes  of  this  section,  an  officer may rely on various factors to
 determine a person's identity, including but  not  limited  to  personal
 knowledge  of  such person, such person's self-identification, or photo-
 graphic identification. There is no requirement that  a  person  present
 photographic  identification  in order to be issued an appearance ticket
 in lieu of arrest where the person's identity is  otherwise  verifiable;
 however,  if offered by such person, an officer shall accept as evidence
 of identity the following: a valid driver's license or non-driver  iden-
 tification card issued by the commissioner of motor vehicles, the feder-
 al  government, any United States territory, commonwealth or possession,
 the District of Columbia, a state  government  or  municipal  government
 within  the  United States or a provincial government of the dominion of
 Canada; a valid passport issued by the United States government  or  any
 other  country; an identification card issued by the armed forces of the
 United States; a public benefit card, as defined  in  paragraph  (a)  of
 subdivision one of section 158.00 of the penal law;
  (iv)  the  person  is charged with a crime between members of the same
 family or household, as defined in subdivision one of section 530.11  of
 this chapter;
  (v)  the  person is charged with a crime defined in article 130 of the
 penal law;
  (vi) it reasonably appears the person should  be  brought  before  the
 court  for consideration of issuance of an order of protection, pursuant
 to section 530.13 of this chapter, based on the facts of  the  crime  or
 offense that the officer has reasonable cause to believe occurred;
  (vii)  the  person  is  charged  with  a crime for which the court may
 suspend or revoke his or her driver license;
  (viii) it reasonably appears to the officer,  based  on  the  observed
 behavior  of  the individual in the present contact with the officer and
 facts regarding the person's condition that indicates a sign of distress
 to such a degree that the  person  would  face  harm  without  immediate
 medical or mental health care, that bringing the person before the court
 would  be  in  such person's interest in addressing that need; provided,
 however, that before making the  arrest,  the  officer  shall  make  all
 reasonable  efforts  to  assist  the  person  in  securing  appropriate
 services;
  (ix) the person is eighteen years of age or  older  and  charged  with
 criminal  possession of a weapon on school grounds as defined in section
 265.01-a of the penal law;
  (x) the person is eighteen years of age or older and  charged  with  a
 hate crime as defined in section 485.05 of the penal law; or
  (xi)  the offense is a qualifying offense pursuant to paragraph (t) of
 subdivision four of section 510.10 of this chapter, or pursuant to para-
 graph (t) of subdivision four of section 530.40 of this chapter.]

  9.  "Bail"  means  cash  bail[,]  OR a bail bond [or money paid with a

 paragraph  (u)  of  subdivision  4 as added by section 2 of subpart B of

 follows:
 § 510.10 Securing  order; when required; alternatives available[; stand-
  ard to be applied].
  [1.] When a principal, whose future court  attendance  at  a  criminal
 action  or  proceeding  is or may be required, INITIALLY comes under the
 control of a court, such court shall, [in accordance with  this  title,]
 by  a securing order EITHER release the principal on the principal's own
 recognizance, [release the principal under non-monetary conditions,] or,
 where authorized, fix bail or commit the principal to the custody of the
 sheriff. [In all such cases, except where another type of securing order
 is shown to be required by law, the court shall  release  the  principal
 pending  trial  on the principal's own recognizance, unless it is demon-
 strated and the court makes an  individualized  determination  that  the
 principal poses a risk of flight to avoid prosecution. If such a finding
 is  made,  the  court  must select the least restrictive alternative and
 condition or conditions that  will  reasonably  assure  the  principal's
 return to court.  The court shall explain its choice of release, release
 with  conditions,  bail or remand on the record or in writing. In making
 its determination, the court must consider and take into account  avail-
 able information about the principal, including:
 S. 5017  5

  (a) The principal's activities and history;
  (b) If the principal is a defendant, the charges facing the principal;
  (c) The principal's criminal conviction record if any;
  (d)  The  principal's  record  of  previous adjudication as a juvenile
 delinquent, as retained pursuant to section 354.1 of  the  family  court
 act,  or,  of  pending cases where fingerprints are retained pursuant to
 section 306.1 of such act, or a youthful offender, if any;
  (e) The principal's previous record with respect to  flight  to  avoid
 criminal prosecution;
  (f)  If monetary bail is authorized, according to the restrictions set
 forth in this title, the principal's individual financial circumstances,
 and, in cases where bail is authorized, the principal's ability to  post
 bail  without  posing  undue  hardship, as well as his or her ability to
 obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond;
  (g) Any violation by the principal of an order of protection issued by
 any court;
  (h) The principal's history of use or possession of a firearm;
  (i) Whether the charge is alleged to have caused serious  harm  to  an
 individual or group of individuals; and
  (j) If the principal is a defendant, in the case of an application for
 a  securing  order  pending  appeal,  the  merit or lack of merit of the
 appeal.
  2. A principal is entitled to representation  by  counsel  under  this
 chapter  in  preparing an application for release, when a securing order
 is being considered and when a securing  order  is  being  reviewed  for
 modification, revocation or termination. If the principal is financially
 unable to obtain counsel, counsel shall be assigned to the principal.
  3.  In  cases  other  than  as  described  in subdivision four of this
 section the court shall release the principal pending trial on the prin-
 cipal's own recognizance, unless the court finds on  the  record  or  in
 writing  that  release  on  the  principal's  own  recognizance will not
 reasonably assure the principal's return to court.  In  such  instances,
 the  court  shall  release  the principal under non-monetary conditions,
 selecting the least restrictive alternative  and  conditions  that  will
 reasonably  assure  the  principal's  return  to  court. The court shall
 explain its choice of alternative and conditions on  the  record  or  in
 writing.
  4.  Where  the principal stands charged with a qualifying offense, the
 court, unless otherwise prohibited by law, may in its discretion release
 the principal pending trial on the principal's own recognizance or under
 non-monetary conditions, fix bail, or, where the  defendant  is  charged
 with  a  qualifying  offense which is a felony, the court may commit the
 principal to the custody of the sheriff. A principal stands charged with
 a qualifying offense for the purposes of this subdivision when he or she
 stands charged with:
  (a) a felony enumerated in section 70.02 of the penal law, other  than
 robbery  in  the  second degree as defined in subdivision one of section
 160.10 of the penal law, provided, however, that burglary in the  second

 entering the living area of the dwelling;
  (b) a crime involving witness intimidation under section 215.15 of the
 penal law;

 charge arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released  on

 of  this subparagraph, any of the underlying crimes need not be a quali-
 fying offense as defined in this subdivision. For the purposes  of  this
 paragraph,  "harm  to  an identifiable person or property" shall include
 but not be limited to theft of or damage  to  property.  However,  based
 upon  a review of the facts alleged in the accusatory instrument, if the
 court determines that such theft is negligible and does not appear to be

 tary conditions; or

 court set bail in a nominal amount requested by  the  defendant  in  the
 form  specified in paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 520.10 of
 this title; if the court is satisfied that the request is voluntary, the
 court shall set such bail in such amount.
  6.] When a securing order is revoked or otherwise  terminated  in  the
 course of an uncompleted action or proceeding but the principal's future
 court  attendance still is or may be required and the principal is still
 under the control of a court, a new securing order must be issued.  When
 S. 5017  8
 
 the court revokes or otherwise terminates a securing order which commit-
 ted  the  principal  to the custody of the sheriff, the court shall give
 written notification to the sheriff of such revocation or termination of
 the securing order.

 section 3 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is  amended  to

 pal  may  make an application for recognizance[, release under non-mone-

 nity  to  be  heard[,  present evidence] and to contend that an order of

 principal  on  the  principal's  own recognizance [or under non-monetary
 conditions] rather than fix bail, and that if bail is  [authorized  and]
 fixed it should be in a suggested amount and form.

 section 5 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, and subdivision

  2. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ISSUANCE OF AN ORDER OF RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL
 AND  THE  TERMS THEREOF ARE MATTERS OF DISCRETION RATHER THAN OF LAW, AN
 APPLICATION IS DETERMINED ON THE BASIS  OF  THE  FOLLOWING  FACTORS  AND
 CRITERIA:
  (A)  With  respect  to  any principal, the court [in all cases, unless
 otherwise provided by law,] must [impose the least restrictive] CONSIDER
 THE kind and degree of control  or  restriction  that  is  necessary  to
 secure  the  principal's  return  to court when required. In determining
 that matter, the court must, on  the  basis  of  available  information,
 consider  and take into account [information about the principal that is
 relevant to the principal's return to court, including:
  (a) The principal's activities and history;
  (b) If the principal is a defendant, the charges facing the principal;
  (c)]:
 S. 5017  9
 
  (I) THE PRINCIPAL'S CHARACTER, REPUTATION, HABITS  AND  MENTAL  CONDI-
 TION;
  (II) THE PRINCIPAL'S EMPLOYMENT AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES;
  (III)  THE  PRINCIPAL'S FAMILY TIES AND THE LENGTH OF HIS OR HER RESI-
 DENCE IF ANY IN THE COMMUNITY;
  (IV) The principal's criminal [conviction] record if any;
  [(d)] (V) The principal's record of previous adjudication as  a  juve-
 nile  delinquent,  as  retained  pursuant to section 354.2 of the family
 court act, or, of pending cases where fingerprints are retained pursuant
 to section 306.1 of such act, or a youthful offender, if any;
  [(e)] (VI) The principal's previous record IF  ANY  IN  RESPONDING  TO
 COURT APPEARANCES WHEN REQUIRED OR with respect to flight to avoid crim-
 inal prosecution;
  [(f) If monetary bail is authorized, according to the restrictions set
 forth in this title, the principal's individual financial circumstances,
 and,  in cases where bail is authorized, the principal's ability to post
 bail without posing undue hardship, as well as his  or  her  ability  to
 obtain a secured, unsecured, or partially secured bond;
  (g)  any]  (VII)  ANY  violation  by  the  principal  of  an  order of
 protection issued by any court;
  [(h) the] (VIII) THE principal's history of use  or  possession  of  a
 firearm;
  [(i)  whether] (IX) WHETHER the charge is alleged to have caused seri-
 ous harm to an individual or group of individuals; [and
  (j)] (X) If the principal is a defendant, THE WEIGHT OF  THE  EVIDENCE
 AGAINST  HIM  OR HER IN THE PENDING CRIMINAL ACTION AND ANY OTHER FACTOR
 INDICATING PROBABILITY OR IMPROBABILITY OF CONVICTION; OR, in  the  case
 of  an  application  for [a securing order] BAIL OR RECOGNIZANCE pending
 appeal, the merit or lack of merit of the appeal; AND
  (XI) IF HE OR SHE IS A DEFENDANT, THE SENTENCE WHICH  MAY BE  OR  HAS
 BEEN IMPOSED UPON CONVICTION.
  [2.]  (B)  Where  the  principal is a defendant-appellant in a pending
 appeal from a judgment of conviction, the court must also  consider  the
 likelihood  of  ultimate  reversal of the judgment. A determination that
 the appeal is palpably without  merit  alone  justifies,  but  does  not
 require,  a  denial  of the application, regardless of any determination
 made with respect to the factors specified  in  PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF  THIS
 subdivision [one of this section].
  3.  When  bail  or recognizance is ordered, the court shall inform the
 principal, if the principal is a defendant charged with  the  commission
 of  a  felony,  that  the  release is conditional and that the court may
 revoke the order of release and may be authorized to commit the  princi-
 pal  to  the custody of the sheriff in accordance with the provisions of
 subdivision two of section 530.60 of this [chapter] TITLE if the princi-
 pal commits a subsequent felony while at liberty upon such order.
  § 11. Section 510.40 of the criminal  procedure  law,  as  amended  by
 section  6  of  part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019 and paragraph
 (c) of subdivision 4 as amended by section 7 of part UU of chapter 56 of
 the laws of 2020, is amended to read as follows:
 § 510.40 [Court notification to principal of conditions of  release  and
  of  alleged  violations of conditions of release] APPLICATION
  FOR RECOGNIZANCE OR  BAIL;  DETERMINATION  THEREOF,  FORM  OF
  SECURING ORDER AND EXECUTION THEREOF.
  1.  AN  APPLICATION  FOR  RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL MUST BE DETERMINED BY A
 SECURING ORDER WHICH EITHER:
 S. 5017  10
 
  (A) GRANTS THE APPLICATION AND RELEASES THE PRINCIPAL ON  HIS  OR  HER
 OWN RECOGNIZANCE; OR
  (B) GRANTS THE APPLICATION AND FIXES BAIL; OR
  (C)  DENIES  THE  APPLICATION AND COMMITS THE PRINCIPAL TO, OR RETAINS
 HIM OR HER IN, THE CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF.
  2. Upon ordering that a principal be released on the  principal's  own
 recognizance,  [or  released  under non-monetary conditions, or, if bail
 has been fixed, upon the posting of bail,] the  court  must  direct  the
 principal  to appear in the criminal action or proceeding involved when-
 ever the principal's attendance may be required and to [be]  RENDER  THE
 PRINCIPAL  at  all  times  amenable to the orders and processes of the
 court. If such principal is in the custody of the sheriff or at  liberty
 upon bail at the time of the order, the court must direct that the prin-
 cipal  be  discharged from such custody or, as the case may be, that the
 principal's bail be exonerated.
  [2.] 3. Upon the issuance of an order fixing bail[, where authorized,]
 and upon the posting thereof, the court must examine the bail to  deter-
 mine  whether it complies with the order. If it does, the court must, in
 the absence of some factor or circumstance  which  in  law  requires  or
 authorizes  disapproval  thereof,  approve  the  bail  and  must issue a
 certificate of release, authorizing the principal to be at liberty, and,
 if the principal is in the custody of the sheriff at the time, directing
 the sheriff to discharge the principal therefrom. If the bail  fixed  is
 not  posted, or is not approved after being posted, the court must order
 that the principal be committed to the custody of the sheriff.  [In  the
 event  of  any  such  non-approval,  the court shall explain promptly in
 writing the reasons therefor.
  3. Non-monetary conditions of  release  shall  be  individualized  and
 established  in  writing  by the court. At future court appearances, the
 court shall consider a lessening of conditions or modification of condi-
 tions to a less burdensome form based on the principal's compliance with
 such conditions of release. In the event of alleged non-compliance  with
 the  conditions  of  release  in  an important respect, pursuant to this
 subdivision, additional conditions may be imposed by the court,  on  the
 record  or  in writing, only after notice of the facts and circumstances
 of such alleged  non-compliance,  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,
 affording  the  principal and the principal's attorney and the people an
 opportunity to present relevant, admissible evidence, relevant witnesses
 and to cross-examine witnesses, and a finding by  clear  and  convincing
 evidence that the principal violated a condition of release in an impor-
 tant respect. Following such a finding, in determining whether to impose
 additional  conditions  for non-compliance, the court shall consider and
 may select conditions consistent with the court's obligation  to  impose
 the  least  restrictive  condition  or  conditions  that will reasonably
 assure the defendant's return to court. The court shall explain  on  the
 record  or  in  writing  the  reasons  for its determination and for any
 changes to the conditions imposed.
  4. (a) Electronic monitoring of a principal's location may be  ordered
 only if the court finds, after notice, an opportunity to be heard and an
 individualized determination explained on the record or in writing, that
 the  defendant  qualifies  for  electronic monitoring in accordance with
 subdivision twenty-one of section 500.10 of this  title,  and  no  other
 realistic  non-monetary condition or set of non-monetary conditions will
 suffice to reasonably assure a principal's return to court.
  (b) The specific method of electronic monitoring  of  the  principal's
 location must be approved by the court. It must be the least restrictive
 S. 5017  11

 procedure  and method that will reasonably assure the principal's return
 to court, and unobtrusive to the greatest extent practicable.
  (c)  Electronic  monitoring  of  the  location  of  a principal may be
 conducted only by a public entity under the supervision and control of a
 county or municipality or a non-profit  entity  under  contract  to  the
 county,  municipality  or  the  state. A county or municipality shall be
 authorized to enter into a contract with another county or  municipality
 in  the  state  to  monitor  principals under non-monetary conditions of
 release in its county, but counties, municipalities and the state  shall
 not  contract  with  any  private  for-profit  entity for such purposes.
 Counties, municipalities and the state may contract with a private  for-
 profit  entity  to  supply electronic monitoring devices or other items,
 provided that any interaction with persons under  electronic  monitoring
 or  the  data  produced  by such monitoring shall be conducted solely by
 employees of a county, municipality, the state, or a  non-profit  entity
 under contract with such county, municipality or the state.
  (d) Electronic monitoring of a principal's location may be for a maxi-
 mum  period  of  sixty  days,  and may be renewed for such period, after
 notice, an opportunity to be heard and a de novo, individualized  deter-
 mination  in  accordance with this subdivision, which shall be explained
 on the record or in writing.
  A defendant subject  to  electronic  location  monitoring  under  this
 subdivision shall be considered held or confined in custody for purposes
 of  section  180.80 of this chapter and shall be considered committed to
 the custody of the sheriff for purposes of section 170.70 of  the  chap-
 ter, as applicable.
  5. If a principal is released under non-monetary conditions, the court
 shall,  on the record and in an individualized written document provided
 to the principal, notify the principal, in plain language and  a  manner
 sufficiently clear and specific:
  (a) of any conditions to which the principal is subject, to serve as a
 guide for the principal's conduct; and
  (b)  that  the possible consequences for violation of such a condition
 may include revocation of the securing order and the ordering of a  more
 restrictive securing order.]
  §  12.  Sections  510.43  and 510.45 of the criminal procedure law are
 REPEALED.
  § 13. Section 510.50 of the criminal  procedure  law,  as  amended  by
 section  9  of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended to
 read as follows:
 § 510.50 Enforcement of securing order.
  [1.] When the attendance of a principal confined in the custody of the
 sheriff is required at the criminal action or proceeding at a particular
 time and place, the court may compel such attendance  by  directing  the
 sheriff  to produce the principal at such time and place. If the princi-
 pal is at liberty on the principal's own recognizance  [or  non-monetary
 conditions]  or  on  bail, the principal's attendance may be achieved or
 compelled by various methods, including notification and the issuance of
 a bench warrant, prescribed by law in provisions governing such  matters
 with respect to the particular kind of action or proceeding involved.
  [2.  Except  when  the  principal is charged with a new crime while at
 liberty, absent relevant, credible evidence demonstrating that a princi-
 pal's failure to appear for a scheduled court  appearance  was  willful,
 the  court, prior to issuing a bench warrant for a failure to appear for
 a scheduled court appearance, shall provide at least  forty-eight  hours
 notice to the principal or the principal's counsel that the principal is
 S. 5017  12

 required  to  appear,  in  order to give the principal an opportunity to
 appear voluntarily.]
  § 14. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 520.10 of the criminal
 procedure law, as amended by section 10 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the
 laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  (b) The court [shall] MAY direct that the bail be posted in any one of
 [three]  TWO  or  more of the forms specified in subdivision one of this
 section, designated in the  alternative,  and  may  designate  different
 amounts  varying  with the forms[, except that one of the forms shall be
 either an unsecured or partially secured surety bond, as selected by the
 court].
  § 15. Section 530.10 of the criminal  procedure  law,  as  amended  by
 section  11 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended to

 tion of a defendant charged with or convicted of an offense, is required
 [to  issue a securing order] OR AUTHORIZED TO ORDER BAIL OR RECOGNIZANCE
 for THE RELEASE OR PROSPECTIVE RELEASE  OF  such  defendant  during  the
 pendency of either:
  1. A criminal action based upon such charge; or
  2. An appeal taken by the defendant from a judgment of conviction or a
 sentence  or  from an order of an intermediate appellate court affirming
 or modifying a judgment of conviction or a sentence.
  § 16. Subdivision 4 of section 530.11 of the criminal  procedure  law,
 as  amended by section 12 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019,
 is amended to read as follows:
  4. When a person is arrested for  an  alleged  family  offense  or  an
 alleged  violation  of  an  order  of  protection  or temporary order of
 protection or arrested pursuant to a warrant issued by  the  supreme  or
 family  court, and the supreme or family court, as applicable, is not in
 session, such person shall be brought before a local criminal  court  in
 the  county  of arrest or in the county in which such warrant is return-
 able pursuant to article one hundred twenty of this chapter. Such  local
 criminal  court  may issue any order authorized under subdivision eleven
 of section 530.12 of this article, section one hundred  fifty-four-d  or
 one hundred fifty-five of the family court act or subdivision three-b of
 section  two  hundred  forty or subdivision two-a of section two hundred
 fifty-two of the domestic relations  law,  in  addition  to  discharging
 other  arraignment  responsibilities  as  set  forth in this chapter. In
 making such order, the local criminal court shall consider [de novo] the
 BAIL recommendation [and securing order], if any, made by the supreme or
 family court as indicated on the  warrant  or  certificate  of  warrant.
 Unless  the  petitioner or complainant requests otherwise, the court, in
 addition to scheduling further criminal proceedings, if  any,  regarding
 such  alleged  family  offense  or violation allegation, shall make such
 matter returnable in the supreme or family court, as applicable, on  the
 next day such court is in session.
  §  17. Subdivision 11 of section 530.12 of the criminal procedure law,
 as amended by section 15 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of  2019,

 order, the court may:
  (a)  revoke  an  order  of recognizance [or release under non-monetary
 conditions] or revoke an order of bail or order forfeiture of such  bail
 and commit the defendant to custody; or
  (b)  restore  the case to the calendar when there has been an adjourn-

 protection is a crime or a violation the defendant may be  charged  with
 and tried for that crime or violation.

 OR BAIL AS FOLLOWS:
  1. WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED, BY INFORMATION, SIMPLIFIED  INFORMA-
 TION, PROSECUTOR'S INFORMATION OR MISDEMEANOR COMPLAINT, WITH AN OFFENSE
 OR  OFFENSES OF LESS THAN FELONY GRADE ONLY, THE COURT MUST ORDER RECOG-
 NIZANCE OR BAIL.

 OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS SUBDIVISION:
  (A) A CITY COURT, A TOWN COURT OR A VILLAGE COURT MAY NOT ORDER RECOG-
 NIZANCE OR BAIL WHEN (I) THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH A CLASS A FELONY,
 OR  (II)  IT  APPEARS  THAT  THE  DEFENDANT  HAS  TWO  PREVIOUS  FELONY

  Order of recognizance[,  release  under  non-monetary  conditions]  or
 bail;  by  superior court judge when action is pending in local criminal
 court.
  1. When a criminal action is pending in a local criminal court,  other
 than  one  consisting of a superior court judge sitting as such, a judge
 of a superior court holding a term thereof in the county, upon  applica-
 tion of a defendant, may order recognizance[, release under non-monetary
 conditions] or[, where authorized,] bail when such local criminal court:
  (a)  Lacks  authority to issue such an order, pursuant to the relevant

 monetary conditions] or bail; or
  (c) Has fixed bail[, where authorized,] which is excessive[; or
  (d)  Has set a securing order of release under non-monetary conditions
 which are more restrictive  than  necessary  to  reasonably  assure  the
 defendant's return to court].
  In  such  case, such superior court judge may vacate the order of such
 local criminal court and release the defendant on HIS OR HER OWN  recog-
 nizance  [or  under non-monetary conditions,] or [where authorized,] fix
 bail in a lesser amount or in a less burdensome form[, whichever are the
 least restrictive alternative and conditions that will reasonably assure
 the defendant's return to court. The court shall explain its  choice  of
 alternative and conditions on the record or in writing].

 when the defendant is charged with a felony in a local criminal court, a
 superior court judge may not order recognizance, [release under non-mon-
 etary conditions] or[, where authorized,]  bail  unless  and  until  the

 such judge [and counsel for the defendant have] HAS been furnished  with
 a  report as described in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of subdivi-

 § 530.40 ORDER OF RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL; BY SUPERIOR COURT WHEN ACTION IS
  PENDING THEREIN.
 S. 5017  15
 
  WHEN  A  CRIMINAL  ACTION  IS PENDING IN A SUPERIOR COURT, SUCH COURT,
 UPON APPLICATION OF A DEFENDANT, MUST OR MAY ORDER RECOGNIZANCE OR  BAIL

 INDICTMENT (A) HAS RESULTED FROM AN ORDER  OF  A  LOCAL  CRIMINAL  COURT
 HOLDING THE DEFENDANT FOR THE ACTION OF THE GRAND JURY, OR (B) WAS FILED
 AT  A TIME WHEN A FELONY COMPLAINT CHARGING THE SAME CONDUCT WAS PENDING
 IN A LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT, AND IN WHICH SUCH LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT  OR  A
 SUPERIOR  COURT  JUDGE HAS ISSUED AN ORDER OF RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL WHICH
 IS STILL EFFECTIVE, THE SUPERIOR COURT'S ORDER MAY BE IN THE FORM  OF  A

 CLASS B OR CLASS C FELONY AS DEFINED IN ARTICLE ONE  HUNDRED  THIRTY  OF
 THE  PENAL  LAW COMMITTED OR ATTEMPTED TO BE COMMITTED BY A PERSON EIGH-
 TEEN YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER AGAINST A PERSON LESS THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS  OF
 AGE. IN EITHER CASE THE COURT MUST COMMIT OR REMAND THE DEFENDANT TO THE
 CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF.
  4.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION,
 A SUPERIOR COURT MAY NOT ORDER RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL WHEN  THE  DEFENDANT
 IS  CHARGED WITH A FELONY UNLESS AND UNTIL THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS HAD
 AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD  IN  THE  MATTER  AND  SUCH  COURT  HAS  BEEN
 FURNISHED  WITH  A REPORT AS DESCRIBED IN SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF PARAGRAPH
 (B) OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION 530.20 OF THIS ARTICLE.

 penal  law  committed  or attempted to be committed by a person eighteen
 years of age or older against a person less than eighteen years of age.
  2. [Notwithstanding the provisions  of  subdivision  four  of  section
 510.10,  paragraph (b) of subdivision one of section 530.20 and subdivi-
 sion four of section 530.40 of this title, when a defendant charged with
 an offense that is not such a qualifying offense applies, pending deter-
 mination of an appeal, for an order of recognizance or release  on  non-
 monetary  conditions,  where authorized, or fixing bail, a judge identi-
 fied  in  subdivision  two  of  section  460.50  or  paragraph  (a)  of
 subdivision  one  of  section  460.60 of this chapter may, in accordance
 with law, and except as otherwise provided  by  law,  issue  a  securing
 order:  releasing  the  defendant on the defendant's own recognizance or

 ing the defendant to the custody of the sheriff where authorized.

 dismissing one or more counts of an accusatory instrument for failure to
 comply with a discovery order pursuant to subdivision twelve of  section
 450.20  of  this  chapter and the defendant is charged with a qualifying
 offense in the remaining counts in the  accusatory  instrument,  pending
 determination  of  an  appeal,  the  defendant may apply for an order of

 of this chapter or paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section 460.60 of
 this  chapter  may,  in  accordance  with  law,  and except as otherwise
 provided by law, issue a securing order releasing the defendant  on  the

 authorized], fixing bail, or remanding the defendant to the  custody  of
 the sheriff where authorized.
  §  26.  Section  530.60  of  the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 section 20 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended  to
 read as follows:
 § 530.60 [Certain  modifications  of a securing order] ORDER OF RECOGNI-
  ZANCE OR BAIL; REVOCATION THEREOF.
  1. Whenever in the course of a criminal action or proceeding a defend-
 ant is at liberty as a result of  an  order  of  recognizance[,  release
 under  non-monetary conditions] or bail issued pursuant to this chapter,
 and the court considers it necessary to review such order, [whether  due
 to  a  motion by the people or otherwise,] the court may, and [except as
 provided in subdivision two of section 510.50 of this title concerning a
 failure to appear in court,] by a bench warrant  if  necessary,  require
 the  defendant  to  appear  before  the court. Upon such appearance, the
 court, for good cause shown, may  revoke  the  order  of  recognizance[,
 release  under  non-monetary  conditions,]  or bail. If the defendant is
 entitled to recognizance[, release under  non-monetary  conditions,]  or
 bail  as  a matter of right, the court must issue another such order. If
 the defendant is not, the court may either issue such an order or commit
 the defendant to the custody of the  sheriff  in  accordance  with  this
 section.
 S. 5017  17
 
  Where  the defendant is committed to the custody of the sheriff and is
 held on a felony complaint, a new period as provided in  section  180.80
 of  this  chapter shall commence to run from the time of the defendant's
 commitment under this subdivision.
  2.  (a)  Whenever  in  the course of a criminal action or proceeding a
 defendant charged with the commission of a felony is  at  liberty  as  a
 result  of  an order of recognizance, [release under non-monetary condi-
 tions] or bail issued pursuant to this article it shall be  grounds  for
 revoking such order that the court finds reasonable cause to believe the
 defendant  committed  one  or  more  specified class A or violent felony
 offenses or intimidated a victim or  witness  in  violation  of  section
 215.15, 215.16 or 215.17 of the penal law while at liberty.
  [(b)  Except  as  provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision or any
 other law, whenever in the course of a criminal action or  proceeding  a
 defendant  charged  with the commission of an offense is at liberty as a
 result of an order of recognizance, release  under  non-monetary  condi-
 tions  or  bail  issued pursuant to this article it shall be grounds for
 revoking such order and fixing bail in such criminal action or  proceed-
 ing when the court has found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the
 defendant:
  (i) persistently and willfully failed to appear after notice of sched-
 uled appearances in the case before the court; or
  (ii)  violated  an  order  of  protection  in the manner prohibited by
 subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of section 215.51 of the penal law while  at
 liberty; or
  (iii)  stands  charged  in  such  criminal action or proceeding with a
 misdemeanor or violation and, after  being  so  charged,  intimidated  a
 victim  or  witness  in violation of section 215.15, 215.16 or 215.17 of
 the penal law or tampered with a witness in violation of section 215.11,
 215.12 or 215.13 of the penal law, law while at liberty; or
  (iv) stands charged in such action or proceeding with  a  felony  and,
 after being so charged, committed a felony while at liberty.
  (c)] Before revoking an order of recognizance[, release under non-mon-
 etary  conditions,] or bail pursuant to this subdivision, the court must
 hold a hearing and shall receive any relevant, admissible  evidence  not
 legally  privileged.  The  defendant may cross-examine witnesses and may
 present relevant, admissible evidence on his own  behalf.  Such  hearing
 may  be  consolidated  with, and conducted at the same time as, a felony
 hearing conducted pursuant to article one hundred eighty of  this  chap-
 ter.  A transcript of testimony taken before the grand jury upon presen-
 tation of the subsequent offense shall be admissible as evidence  during
 the  hearing.  The  district  attorney  may move to introduce grand jury
 testimony of a witness in lieu of that witness' appearance at the  hear-
 ing.
  [(d)]  (B) Revocation of an order of recognizance[, release under non-
 monetary conditions] or bail and [a new securing order fixing  bail  or]
 commitment[, as specified in this paragraph and] pursuant to this subdi-
 vision shall be for the following periods, EITHER:
  [(i)  Under paragraph (a) of this subdivision, revocation of the order
 of recognizance, release under non-monetary conditions or, as  the  case
 may  be,  bail,  and  a new securing order fixing bail or committing the
 defendant to the custody of the sheriff shall be as follows:
  (A)] (I) For a period not to exceed ninety days exclusive of any peri-
 ods of adjournment requested by the defendant; or
 S. 5017  18
 
  [(B)] (II) Until the charges contained within the  accusatory  instru-
 ment  have  been  reduced  or dismissed such that no count remains which
 charges the defendant with commission of a felony; or
  [(C)]  (III)  Until  reduction  or  dismissal of the charges contained
 within the accusatory instrument charging the  subsequent  offense  such
 that  no  count remains which charges the defendant with commission of a
 class A or violent felony offense.
  Upon expiration of any of the  three  periods  specified  within  this
 [subparagraph]  PARAGRAPH, whichever is shortest, the court may grant or
 deny release upon an order of bail or recognizance  in  accordance  with
 the  provisions  of  this  article.  Upon  conviction  to an offense the
 provisions of THIS article [five hundred thirty of this  chapter]  shall
 apply[; and
  (ii)  Under paragraph (b) of this subdivision, revocation of the order
 of recognizance, release under non-monetary conditions or, as  the  case
 may  be, bail shall result in the issuance of a new securing order which
 may, if otherwise authorized by law, permit the principal's  release  on
 recognizance  or  release  under non-monetary conditions, but shall also
 render the defendant eligible for an order fixing bail provided,  howev-
 er,  that in accordance with the principles in this title the court must
 select the least restrictive alternative  and  condition  or  conditions
 that will reasonably assure the principal's return to court.  Nothing in
 this  subparagraph  shall  be  interpreted  as  shortening the period of
 detention, or requiring or authorizing any less restrictive  form  of  a
 securing order, which may be imposed pursuant to any other law].
  [(e)]  (C) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) [or (b)] of
 this subdivision a defendant, against whom a felony complaint  has  been
 filed  which  charges  the  defendant  with  commission  of a class A or
 violent felony offense [or violation of section 215.15, 215.16 or 215.17
 of the penal law] committed while he OR SHE was at liberty as  specified
 therein,  may be committed to the custody of the sheriff pending a revo-
 cation hearing for a period not to exceed seventy-two  hours.  An  addi-
 tional  period  not  to  exceed  seventy-two hours may be granted by the
 court upon application of the district attorney upon a showing  of  good
 cause  or  where  the  failure  to  commence  the hearing was due to the
 defendant's request or occurred with his OR HER consent. Such good cause
 must consist of some compelling fact  or  circumstance  which  precluded
 conducting the hearing within the initial prescribed period.
  § 27. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 9 of section 216.05 of the criminal
 procedure law, as amended by chapter 435 of the laws of 2021, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (a)  If  at any time during the defendant's participation in the judi-
 cial diversion program, the court has reasonable grounds to believe that
 the defendant has violated a release condition [in an important respect]
 or has [willfully] failed to appear before the court as  requested,  the
 court  [except  as provided in subdivision two of section 510.50 of this
 chapter regarding a failure to appear,] shall direct  the  defendant  to
 appear  or  issue  a bench warrant to a police officer or an appropriate
 peace officer directing him or her to take the  defendant  into  custody
 and  bring  the  defendant  before  the court without unnecessary delay;
 provided, however, that under no circumstances  shall  a  defendant  who
 requires  treatment  for opioid use be deemed to have violated a release
 condition on  the  basis  of  his  or  her  participation  in  medically
 prescribed  drug treatments under the care of a health care professional
 licensed or certified under title eight of  the  education  law,  acting
 within his or her lawful scope of practice. The [relevant] provisions of
 S. 5017  19
 
 SUBDIVISION  ONE OF section 530.60 of this chapter relating to [issuance
 of securing orders] REVOCATION OF RECOGNIZANCE OR BAIL  shall  apply  to

  A person who has been taken into custody pursuant to section 410.40 or
 [section]  410.50  of  this  article  for  violation of a condition of a
 sentence of probation or a sentence of conditional discharge must forth-
 with be brought before the court that  imposed  the  sentence.  Where  a
 violation of probation petition and report has been filed and the person
 has  not  been  taken  into  custody  nor  has a warrant been issued, an
 initial court appearance shall occur within ten  business  days  of  the
 court's  issuance  of  a  notice  to appear. If the court has reasonable
 cause to believe that such  person  has  violated  a  condition  of  the
 sentence,  it may commit such person to the custody of the sheriff[,] OR
 fix bail[, release such person under non-monetary conditions] or release
 such person on such person's own recognizance for future appearance at a
 hearing to be held in accordance with section 410.70 of this article. If
 the court does not have reasonable cause to believe that such person has
 violated a condition of the sentence, it must direct that such person be
 released.
  § 29. Subdivision 3 of section 620.50 of the criminal  procedure  law,
 as  amended by section 24 of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019,
 is amended to read as follows:
  3. A material witness order must be executed as follows:
  (a) If the bail is posted and approved by the court, the witness must,
 as provided in subdivision [two] THREE of section 510.40 of  this  part,
 be  released and be permitted to remain at liberty; provided that, where
 the bail is posted by  a  person  other  than  the  witness  himself  OR
 HERSELF,  he OR SHE may not be so released except upon his OR HER signed
 written consent thereto;
  (b) If the bail is not posted, or if though posted it is not  approved
 by  the  court, the witness must, as provided in subdivision [two] THREE
 of section 510.40 of this part, be committed to the custody of the sher-
 iff.

 in whole or in part, the court must, to the extent a protective order is
 not warranted, order the prosecutor to comply with the request if it  is
 satisfied that the items of factual information requested are authorized
 to  be  included  in a bill of particulars, and that such information is
 necessary to enable the defendant adequately to prepare or  conduct  his
 OR HER defense and, if the request was untimely, a finding of good cause
 for  the  delay.  Where  a  prosecutor  has  not timely served a written

 or control that was secured in  connection  with  the  investigation  or
 prosecution  of the defendant upon credible allegations by the defendant
 and a finding by the court that such property,  if  obtained,  would  be
 probative to the determination of defendant's actual innocence, and that
 the  request is reasonable. The court shall deny or limit such a request
 upon a finding that such a  request,  if  granted,  would  threaten  the
 integrity  or chain of custody of property or the integrity of the proc-
 esses or functions of a laboratory conducting DNA testing, pose  a  risk
 of  harm,  intimidation, embarrassment, reprisal, or other substantially
 negative consequences to any person, undermine the proper  functions  of
 law  enforcement  including the confidentiality of informants, or on the
 basis of any other factor identified by the court in  the  interests  of
 justice  or public safety. The court shall further ensure that any prop-
 erty produced pursuant to this paragraph  is  subject  to  a  protective
 order, where appropriate. The court shall deny any request made pursuant
 to this paragraph where:

 an officer of a criminal court, may issue  a  subpoena  of  such  court,
 subscribed  by  himself  OR HERSELF, for the attendance in such court of
 any witness whom the defendant is entitled to call  in  such  action  or
 proceeding.  An  attorney for a defendant may not issue a subpoena duces
 tecum of the court directed to any department, bureau or agency  of  the
 state or of a political subdivision thereof, or to any officer or repre-
 sentative  thereof[,  unless  the  subpoena is indorsed by the court and
 provides at least three days for the production of the requested materi-
 als. In the case of an emergency, the court may by order  dispense  with
 the  three-day  production  period].  SUCH A SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM MAY BE
 ISSUED IN BEHALF OF A DEFENDANT UPON ORDER OF A COURT  PURSUANT  TO  THE
 RULES  APPLICABLE  TO  CIVIL  CASES  AS PROVIDED IN SECTION TWENTY-THREE
 HUNDRED SEVEN OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES.

  10.  Where  there  has been a failure to comply with the provisions of
 this section, and where the district attorney does  not  demonstrate  to
 the  satisfaction  of  the  court  that  such failure has not caused the
 defendant prejudice, the court shall  instruct  the  jury  that  it  may
 consider  such  failure  in  determining  the  weight  to  be given such
 evidence and may also impose any other sanction set forth in subdivision
 one of section [245.80] 240.70 of the criminal procedure law;  provided,
 however,  that  unless  the  defendant has convinced the court that such
 failure has caused him OR HER  undue  prejudice,  the  court  shall  not
 preclude  the district attorney from introducing into evidence the prop-
 erty, photographs, photocopies, or other reproductions of  the  property
 or,  where  appropriate,  testimony  concerning its value and condition,
 where such evidence is otherwise properly authenticated  and  admissible
 under  the  rules of evidence. Failure to comply with any one or more of
 the provisions of this section  shall  not  for  that  reason  alone  be
 grounds for dismissal of the accusatory instrument.

 property not otherwise disclosed which is material and reasonably neces-
 sary for preparation by the defendant with  respect  to  the  forfeiture
 proceeding  pursuant  to  such section. The court may issue a protective
 order denying,  limiting,  conditioning,  delaying  or  regulating  such
 discovery  where  a  danger  to  the integrity of physical evidence or a
 substantial risk of  physical  harm,  intimidation,  economic  reprisal,
 bribery  or  unjustified  annoyance or embarrassment to any person or an
 adverse effect upon the legitimate needs of law  enforcement,  including
 the protection of the confidentiality of informants, or any other factor
 or set of factors outweighs the usefulness of the discovery.

 defendant's arraignment on the special forfeiture information, the court
 shall order discovery of any information not otherwise  disclosed  which
 is  material  and  reasonably necessary for preparation by the defendant
 with respect to a forfeiture proceeding brought pursuant to  this  arti-
 cle.  Such  material  shall  include  those  portions  of the grand jury
 minutes and such other information which pertain solely to  the  special
 forfeiture  information and shall not include information which pertains
 to the criminal charges. Upon application of the prosecutor,  the  court
 may  issue a protective order pursuant to section [245.70] 240.40 of the
 criminal procedure law with respect to any information  required  to  be
 disclosed pursuant to this subdivision.
  § 44. Subdivision 5 of section 216 of the judiciary law is REPEALED.
