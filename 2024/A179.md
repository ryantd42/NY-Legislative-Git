 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. SANTABARBARA -- read once and referred to the

 AN ACT to amend the public service law, in relation to requiring  legis-
  lative approval of increases in utility charges

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as  the  "utility
 ratepayer protection act".
  §  2.  Subdivision  12  of  section  66 of the public service law is
 amended by adding a new paragraph (b-1) to read as follows:
  (B-1) NO CHANGE SHALL BE MADE IN ANY RATE OR CHARGE, WHICH SHALL  HAVE
 BEEN  FILED  BY A UTILITY IN COMPLIANCE WITH AN ORDER OF THE COMMISSION,
 WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE BY A MAJORITY VOTE
 IN EACH HOUSE. THE UTILITY SHALL SUBMIT A WRITTEN REPORT TO THE LEGISLA-
 TURE AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED  EIGHTY  DAYS  PRIOR  TO  THE  DATE  WHEN  ANY
 PROPOSED  INCREASE  IN  FEES,  RENTALS  AND CHARGES FOR THE PROVISION OF
 SERVICES BY THE UTILITY IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE EFFECT. SUCH  REPORT  SHALL
 INCLUDE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSED INCREASE, AND INFORMATION SETTING
 FORTH  THE  CURRENT  FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE UTILITY. THE LEGISLATURE
 MAY REQUIRE ANY ADDITIONAL DATA OR INFORMATION THAT IT DEEMS  NECESSARY.
 IF  THE  LEGISLATURE,  OR THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES THEREOF, FINDS THAT
 THE PROPOSED INCREASES ARE NOT NECESSARY TO PRODUCE  SUFFICIENT  REVENUE
 TO  MEET THE EXPENSE OF THE PROVISION OF SERVICES, INCLUDING THE MAINTE-
 NANCE AND OPERATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE, THEN NO PROPOSED  INCREASE  SHALL
 TAKE  EFFECT  UNTIL  APPROVED  BY  A  MAJORITY VOTE OF EACH HOUSE OF THE
 LEGISLATURE.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
