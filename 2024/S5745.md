 performed by the workmen, laborers and mechanics employed on such public
 work, or both.  The fiscal officer or his agents, examiners and  inspec-
 tors  may examine or cause to be examined the books and records pertain-
 ing to the rate of wages paid and supplements provided to the  laborers,
 workmen  and  mechanics  on  said  public  work  and  the hours of labor
 performed by such laborers, workmen and mechanics on said  public  work.

 ister  oaths and examine witnesses. The enforcement of a subpoena issued
 under this section shall be regulated by  the  civil  practice  law  and
 rules.  Such fiscal officer shall make either an order, determination or
 any other disposition, including but  not  limited  to  an  agreed  upon
