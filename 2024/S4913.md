  and  to  repeal  certain  provisions of the correction law relating to
  certificates of good conduct
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  1  of section 700 of the
 correction law, as amended by chapter  342  of  the  laws  of  1972,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a)  "Eligible offender" shall mean a person who has been convicted of
 a crime or of an offense[, but who has not been convicted more than once
 of a felony].
  § 2. Section 701 of the correction law, as amended by chapter  342  of
 the  laws of 1972, subdivision 2 as amended by section 3 of subpart J of
 part II of chapter 55 of the  laws  of  2019,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  §  701.  Certificate  of  [relief from disabilities] RESTORATION. 1. A
 certificate of [relief from disabilities] RESTORATION may be granted  as
 provided  in this article to relieve an eligible offender of any forfei-
 ture or disability, or to remove any bar  to  his  employment,  automat-
 ically imposed by law by reason of his conviction of the crime or of the
 offense  specified  therein.  Such  certificate may be limited to one or
 more enumerated forfeitures, disabilities or bars, or  may  relieve  the

 eligible  offender of all forfeitures, disabilities and bars. [Provided,
 however, that no such certificate shall apply, or be construed so as  to
 apply,  to  the  right  of  such  person to retain or to be eligible for
 public office.]
  2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except subdivision five
 of  section  twenty-eight  hundred six of the public health law or para-
 graph (b) of subdivision two of section eleven hundred  ninety-three  of
 the  vehicle  and  traffic law, a conviction of a crime or of an offense
 specified in a certificate of  [relief  from  disabilities]  RESTORATION
 shall  not  cause  automatic  forfeiture  of  any  license, other than a
 license issued pursuant to section 400.00 of the penal law to  a  person
 convicted  of a class A-I felony or a violent felony offense, as defined
 in subdivision one of section 70.02 of the penal  law,  permit,  employ-
 ment,  or  franchise,  including the right to register for or vote at an
 election, or automatic forfeiture of any other right or privilege,  held
 by  the eligible offender and covered by the certificate. Nor shall such
 conviction be deemed to be  a  conviction  within  the  meaning  of  any
 provision  of  law that imposes, by reason of a conviction, a bar to any
 employment, a disability to exercise any right, or a disability to apply
 for or to receive any license, permit, or other authority  or  privilege
 covered  by  the certificate; provided, however, that a conviction for a
 second or subsequent violation of  any  subdivision  of  section  eleven
 hundred  ninety-two  of the vehicle and traffic law committed within the
 preceding ten years shall impose a disability to apply for or receive an
 operator's license during the period provided in such law; and  provided
 further,  however, that a conviction for a class A-I felony or a violent
 felony offense, as defined in subdivision one of section  70.02  of  the
 penal  law,  shall impose a disability to apply for or receive a license
 or permit issued pursuant to section 400.00 of the penal law.
  3. A certificate of [relief from disabilities] RESTORATION shall  not,
 however,  in  any way prevent any judicial, administrative, licensing or
 other body, board or authority from relying upon the  conviction  speci-
 fied therein as the basis for the exercise of its discretionary power to
 suspend,  revoke, refuse to issue or refuse to renew any license, permit
 or other authority or privilege.
  § 3.  Section 702 of the correction law, as amended by chapter 342  of
 the  laws  of 1972, the section heading as amended by chapter 931 of the
 laws of 1976, subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 488  of  the  laws  of
 2011,  subdivision 3 as amended by section 64 of part A of chapter 56 of
 the laws of 2010 and subdivisions 4 and 6 as amended by  section  32  of
 subpart  B  of  part  C of chapter 62 of the laws of 2011, is amended to
 read as follows:
  § 702. Certificates of [relief from disabilities]  RESTORATION  issued
 by  courts.  1. Any court of this state [may, in its discretion,] SHALL,
 ABSENT A FINDING THAT  ISSUANCE  OF  SUCH  CERTIFICATE  WILL  JEOPARDIZE
 PUBLIC  SAFETY, issue a certificate of [relief from disabilities] RESTO-
 RATION AT  THE  TIME  OF  SENTENCING  to  an  eligible  offender  for  a
 conviction that occurred in such court, if the court [either (a) imposed
 a  revocable sentence or (b)] imposed a sentence other than one executed
 by commitment to an institution under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  state
 department  of  corrections  and community supervision. Such certificate
 [may be] issued [(i)] at the time sentence is pronounced[, in which case
 it] may grant relief from forfeitures, as well as from disabilities[, or
 (ii) at any time thereafter, in which case it shall apply only to  disa-
 bilities].  Where  such  court  either imposes a revocable sentence or
 imposes a sentence other than one executed by commitment to an  institu-
 S. 4913  3
 
 tion  under  the jurisdiction of the state department of corrections and
 community supervision, the court, upon  application  and  in  accordance
 with  subdivision  two  of  this  section, shall initially determine the
 fitness  of an eligible offender for such certificate prior to or at the
 time sentence is pronounced. WHERE THE COURT FINDS THAT ISSUANCE OF  THE
 CERTIFICATE  AT  SENTENCING  WILL JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY, SUCH CERTIF-
 ICATE SHALL BE ISSUED AS FOLLOWS:
  (A) FOR AN OFFENDER WHO RECEIVES A REVOCABLE SENTENCE,  SUCH  OFFENDER
 SHALL  BE ISSUED SUCH CERTIFICATE AFTER SERVING ONE YEAR OF SUCH REVOCA-
 BLE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE COURT PROVIDED THAT SUCH  OFFENDER  HAS  NOT
 BEEN CONVICTED OF A NEW CRIME DURING THAT TIME AND IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF
 AN UNDISPOSED ARREST. SUCH CERTIFICATE SHALL APPLY ONLY TO DISABILITIES.
 IN ORDER TO RECEIVE SUCH A CERTIFICATE, THE ELIGIBLE OFFENDER MUST APPLY
 TO THE COURT IN WHICH THEY WERE SENTENCED.
  (B)  FOR AN OFFENDER WHO RECEIVES A DEFINITE SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT,
 SUCH OFFENDER SHALL BE ISSUED SUCH CERTIFICATE ONE  YEAR  AFTER  RELEASE
 FROM INCARCERATION PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFENDER HAS NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF
 A  NEW  CRIME  DURING  THAT TIME AND IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF AN UNDISPOSED
 ARREST. SUCH CERTIFICATE SHALL APPLY ONLY TO DISABILITIES.  IN ORDER  TO
 RECEIVE  SUCH  A  CERTIFICATE,  THE  ELIGIBLE OFFENDER MUST APPLY TO THE
 COURT IN WHICH THEY WERE SENTENCED.
  IN CALCULATING THE ONE-YEAR PERIODS UNDER PARAGRAPHS (A)  AND  (B)  OF
 THIS  SUBDIVISION, ANY PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THE PERSON WAS INCAR-
 CERATED FOR ANY REASON BETWEEN THE TIME OF CONVICTION AND  THE  DATE  ON
 WHICH  THE ELIGIBLE OFFENDER BECOMES ELIGIBLE FOR A CERTIFICATE SHALL BE
 EXCLUDED AND SUCH ONE-YEAR PERIOD SHALL BE EXTENDED BY A PERIOD OR PERI-
 ODS EQUAL TO THE TIME SERVED UNDER SUCH INCARCERATION.
  2. [Such] THE RELIEF GRANTED BY SUCH certificate shall [not be  issued
 by the court unless the court is satisfied that:
  (a) The person to whom it is to be granted is an eligible offender, as
 defined in section seven hundred;
  (b) The relief to be granted by the certificate is] BE consistent with
 the rehabilitation of the eligible offender[;] and
  [(c)  The  relief  to  be granted by the certificate is] BE consistent
 with the public interest.
  3. [Where a certificate of relief from disabilities is not  issued  at
 the  time sentence is pronounced it shall only be issued thereafter upon
 verified application to the court. The court may,  for  the  purpose  of
 determining  whether  such  certificate  shall  be  issued,  request its
 probation service to conduct an investigation of the  applicant,  or  if
 the  court has no probation service it may request the probation service
 of the county court for the county in which  the  court  is  located  to
 conduct  such  investigation. Any probation officer requested to make an
 investigation pursuant to this section shall prepare and submit  to  the
 court a written report in accordance with such request.
  4.]  Where  the court has imposed a revocable sentence and the certif-
 icate of [relief from disabilities] RESTORATION is issued prior  to  the
 expiration  or  termination  of the time which the court may revoke such
 sentence, the certificate shall be deemed to be a temporary  certificate
 until  such  time  as  the  court's authority to revoke the sentence has
 expired or is terminated. While temporary, such certificate (a)  may  be
 revoked  by  the  court for violation of the conditions of the sentence,
 and (b) shall be revoked by the court if it  revokes  the  sentence  and
 commits the person to an institution under the jurisdiction of the state
 department of corrections and community supervision. Any such revocation
 shall  be  upon  notice  and  after  an  opportunity to be heard. If the
 S. 4913  4
 
 certificate is not so revoked, it shall become a  permanent  certificate
 upon  expiration  or  termination of the court's authority to revoke the
 sentence.
  [5]  4.  Any court that has issued a certificate of [relief from disa-
 bilities] RESTORATION may at any time issue a new certificate to enlarge
 the relief previously granted, provided, however, that the provisions of
 subdivisions one through [four] THREE of this section shall apply to the
 issuance of any such new certificate.
  [6.] 5. Any written report submitted to the court  [pursuant  to]  FOR
 THE  PURPOSES OF this section is confidential and may not be made avail-
 able to any person or public or private agency except where specifically
 required or permitted by statute or upon specific authorization  of  the
 court. However, upon the court's receipt of such report, the court shall
 provide a copy of such report, or direct that such report be provided to
 the  applicant's attorney, or the applicant himself, if he or she has no
 attorney. In its discretion, the court may except from disclosure a part
 or parts of the report which are not  relevant  to  the  granting  of  a
 certificate,  or  sources  of  information which have been obtained on a
 promise of confidentiality, or any other portion thereof, disclosure  of
 which  would  not be in the interest of justice. The action of the court
 excepting information from disclosure  shall  be  subject  to  appellate
 review.  The  court,  in  its  discretion, may hold a conference in open
 court or in chambers to afford an applicant an opportunity to controvert
 or to comment upon any portions  of  the  report.  The  court  may  also
 conduct  a  summary  hearing at the conference on any matter relevant to
 the granting of the application and may take testimony under oath.
  § 4. Section 703 of the correction law, as amended by  section  34  of
 subpart  B  of  part  C of chapter 62 of the laws of 2011, is amended to
 read as follows:
  § 703. Certificates of [relief from disabilities]  RESTORATION  issued
 by  the  department  of  corrections  and  community supervision. 1. The
 department of corrections and  community  supervision  shall  [have  the
 power  to] issue a certificate of [relief from disabilities] RESTORATION
 to:
  (a) any eligible offender who has been  committed  to  an  institution
 under the jurisdiction of the state department of corrections and commu-
 nity  supervision WHO SUCCESSFULLY EARNED MERIT TIME OR A CERTIFICATE OF
 EARNED ELIGIBILITY DURING THEIR PERIOD OF INCARCERATION.  Such  certif-
 icate  [may]  SHALL be issued by the department at the time the offender
 is released from such institution under the department's supervision [or
 otherwise or at any time thereafter]. IF SUCH ELIGIBLE OFFENDER DID  NOT
 EARN  MERIT  TIME  OR  A CERTIFICATE OF EARNED ELIGIBILITY, THE BOARD OF
 PAROLE SHALL ISSUE  SUCH  CERTIFICATE  AT  THE  TIME  OF  SUCH  ELIGIBLE
 OFFENDER'S RELEASE TO COMMUNITY SUPERVISION UNLESS IT IS DETERMINED THAT
 THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH CERTIFICATE WOULD JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY. IF SUCH
 CERTIFICATE  IS  NOT  ISSUED  UPON  SUCH  ELIGIBLE OFFENDER'S RELEASE TO
 COMMUNITY SUPERVISION, SUCH OFFENDER SHALL BE ISSUED  A  CERTIFICATE  BY
 THE  BOARD  OF  PAROLE  AFTER TWO YEARS OF UNREVOKED PAROLE, CONDITIONAL
 RELEASE OR POST-RELEASE SUPERVISION.  SUCH INDIVIDUAL SHALL APPLY TO THE
 BOARD OF PAROLE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE SUCH CERTIFICATE.
  IN CALCULATING THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH, ANY PERIOD OF
 TIME DURING WHICH THE PERSON WAS INCARCERATED FOR ANY REASON BETWEEN THE
 TIME OF CONVICTION AND THE DATE ON WHICH THE ELIGIBLE  OFFENDER  BECOMES
 ELIGIBLE  FOR  A  CERTIFICATE SHALL BE EXCLUDED AND SUCH TWO-YEAR PERIOD
 SHALL BE EXTENDED BY A PERIOD OR PERIODS EQUAL TO THE TIME SERVED  UNDER
 SUCH INCARCERATION;
 S. 4913  5
 
  (b)  any  eligible  offender  who  resides within this state and whose
 judgment of conviction was rendered by a court in any other jurisdiction
 WHERE SUCH ELIGIBLE OFFENDER APPLIES FOR SUCH CERTIFICATE, IS NOT INCAR-
 CERATED AT THE TIME OF THE APPLICATION AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO  AN  UNDIS-
 POSED ARREST, UNLESS THE BOARD OF PAROLE DETERMINES THAT THE ISSUANCE OF
 SUCH  CERTIFICATE  WOULD  JEOPARDIZE  PUBLIC SAFETY. IF A CERTIFICATE OF
 RESTORATION IS NOT ISSUED AT THE TIME  OF  THE  APPLICATION,  THE  BOARD
 SHALL  ISSUE  A CERTIFICATE TO SUCH ELIGIBLE OFFENDER ONE YEAR AFTER THE
 DATE OF THE APPLICATION WHERE THE  JUDGMENT  OF  CONVICTION  WAS  FOR  A
 MISDEMEANOR  AND  TWO  YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE APPLICATION WHERE THE
 JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION WAS FOR A FELONY, PROVIDED THAT SUCH OFFENDER HAS
 NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF A NEW CRIME AND IS NOT THE SUBJECT  OF  AN  UNDIS-
 POSED ARREST.
  2. Where the department has issued a certificate of [relief from disa-
 bilities]  RESTORATION,  the  department  may  at  any  time issue a new
 certificate enlarging the relief previously granted.
  3. The RELIEF GRANTED BY THE department [shall not  issue  any]  IN  A
 certificate  of  [relief  from  disabilities]  RESTORATION  pursuant  to
 [subdivisions] SUBDIVISION one or two[, unless the department is  satis-
 fied that:
  (a) The person to whom it is to be granted is an eligible offender, as
 defined in section seven hundred;
  (b)  The  relief  to be granted by the certificate is] OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL BE consistent with the rehabilitation of the eligible  offender[;]
 and
  [(c)  The  relief  to  be granted by the certificate is] BE consistent
 with the public interest.
  4. Any certificate of [relief from disabilities] RESTORATION issued by
 the department to an eligible offender who at time of  the  issuance  of
 the  certificate  is under the department's supervision, shall be deemed
 to be a temporary certificate until such time as the  eligible  offender
 is  discharged  from the department's supervision, and, while temporary,
 such certificate may be revoked by the department for violation  of  the
 conditions  of community supervision. Revocation shall be upon notice to
 the releasee, who shall  be  accorded  an  opportunity  to  explain  the
 violation  prior  to  decision  thereon.  If  the  certificate is not so
 revoked, it shall become a  permanent  certificate  upon  expiration  or
 termination of the department's jurisdiction over the individual.
  5. In granting or revoking a certificate of [relief from disabilities]
 RESTORATION  the  action  of  the  department shall be deemed a judicial
 function and shall not be reviewable if done according to law.
  6. For the purpose of determining whether such  certificate  shall  be
 issued, the department may conduct an investigation of the applicant.
  7. Presumption based on federal recommendation. Where a certificate of
 [relief  from  disabilities] RESTORATION is sought pursuant to paragraph
 (b) of subdivision one of this  section  on  a  judgment  of  conviction
 rendered by a federal district court in this state and the department is
 in  receipt of a written recommendation in favor of the issuance of such
 certificate from the  chief  probation  officer  of  the  district,  the
 department  shall  issue the requested certificate, unless it finds that
 the requirements of [paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of]  subdivision  three
 of  this  section  have  not  been  satisfied;  or that the interests of
 justice would not be advanced by the issuance of the certificate.
  § 5. Section 703-a of the correction law is REPEALED.
  § 6. Section 703-b of the correction law is REPEALED.

 certificate of [relief from disabilities] RESTORATION is  deemed  to  be
 temporary  and such certificate is revoked, disabilities and forfeitures
 thereby relieved shall be reinstated as  of  the  date  upon  which  the
 person  to  whom  the  certificate was issued receives written notice of
 such revocation. Any such person  shall  upon  receipt  of  such  notice
 surrender the certificate to the issuing court or board.
  2.  A  person who knowingly uses or attempts to use, a revoked certif-
 icate of [relief from disabilities] RESTORATION in order to obtain or to
 exercise any right or privilege that he would not be entitled to  obtain
 or  to  exercise without a valid certificate shall be guilty of a misde-
 meanor.

 tive  pardon therefor or a certificate of [relief from disabilities or a

 age  control  law,  subdivisions  1  and 1-a as amended by section 50 of
 subpart B of part C of chapter 62 of the laws of 2011 and subdivision  4
 as  amended  by  chapter 669 of the laws of 2022, are amended to read as
 follows:
  1. Except as provided in subdivision one-a of this section,  a  person
 who  has been convicted of a felony or any of the misdemeanors mentioned
 in section eleven hundred forty-six of the former penal law as in  force
 and  effect  immediately  prior  to  September  first,  nineteen hundred
 sixty-seven, or of an offense defined in section 230.20 or 230.40 of the
 penal law, unless subsequent to such conviction such person  shall  have
 received  an  executive  pardon  therefor  removing  this  disability, a
 certificate of [good conduct granted by the  department  of  corrections
 and community supervision, or a certificate of relief from disabilities]
 RESTORATION  granted  by  the  department  of  corrections and community
 supervision or a court of this state pursuant to the provisions of arti-
 cle twenty-three of the correction law to remove  the  disability  under
 this section because of such conviction.
  1-a. Notwithstanding the provision of subdivision one of this section,
 a  corporation holding a license to traffic in alcoholic beverages shall
 not, upon conviction of a felony or any of the misdemeanors or  offenses
 described in subdivision one of this section, be automatically forbidden
 to  traffic in alcoholic beverages, but the application for a license by
 such a corporation shall be subject to denial, and the license of such a
 corporation shall be subject to revocation or suspension by the authori-
 ty pursuant to section one hundred eighteen of this  [chapter]  ARTICLE,
 consistent  with  the  provisions  of  article  twenty-three-A  of  the
 correction law. For any felony conviction by a court other than a  court
 of  this  state, the authority may request the department of corrections
 and community supervision  to  investigate  and  review  the  facts  and
 circumstances  concerning  such a conviction, and such department shall,
 if so requested, submit its findings to the authority as to whether  the
 S. 4913  9
 
 corporation  has  conducted  itself  in a manner such that discretionary
 review by the authority would not be inconsistent with the public inter-
 est. The department of corrections and community supervision may  charge
 the  licensee or applicant a fee equivalent to the expenses of an appro-
 priate investigation under this subdivision. For any conviction rendered
 by a court of this state, the authority may request the corporation,  if
 the  corporation is eligible for a certificate of [relief from disabili-
 ties] RESTORATION, to seek such a  certificate  [from  the  court  which
 rendered  the conviction] IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE TWENTY-THREE OF THE
