  HONORING  outgoing  Chief John D. Chester upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  many  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
  Williston Park Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly  proud  to  honor  outgoing
Chief  John  D. Chester upon the occasion of his designation for special
recognition after many years of dedicated service to the Williston  Park
Fire  Department,  to  be celebrated at its 97th Annual Installation and
Inspection Dinner  and  Dance  on  Saturday,  April  27,  2024,  at  the
Milleridge Cottage in Jericho, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  John  D.  Chester has consistently demonstrated a level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  member  of  the  Williston  Park  Fire Department since
November 8, 1995, John D.  Chester  climbed  the  ranks  to  become  2nd
Lieutenant  (2003-05,  2010-12,  2015-17),  1st  Lieutenant  (2005-06,
2012-13, 2017-19), and Captain (2006-08, 2013-15, 2019-20); he  went  on
to  serve  as  2nd  Assistant  Chief  (2020-22),  1st  Assistant  Chief
(4/2022-7/2022) and Chief of Department (7/2022-4/2024); and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
John  D.  Chester is such a firefighter; throughout his years of devoted
service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the  call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  outgoing  Chief  John  D.  Chester  upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation for  special  recognition  after  many  years  of  dedicated
service to the Williston Park Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to outgoing Chief John D. Chester.
