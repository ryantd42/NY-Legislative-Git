  § 11. No expenditure may be made from any appropriation in  this  act,
 until  a  certificate of approval has been issued by the director of the
 budget and a copy of such certificate shall have  been  filed  with  the
 state  comptroller, the chairman of the senate finance committee and the
 chairman of the assembly ways and  means  committee  provided,  however,
 that  any  expenditures  from  any appropriation in this act made by the
 legislature or judiciary shall not require such certificate.
 
  § 12. All expenditures and disbursements made  against  the  appropri-
 ations in this act shall, upon final action by the legislature on appro-
 priation  bills submitted by the governor pursuant to article VII of the
 state constitution for the support of government for  the  state  fiscal
 year  beginning  April  1,  2024,  be  transferred by the comptroller as
 expenditures and disbursements to  such  appropriations  for  all  state
 departments and agencies, as applicable, in amounts equal to the amounts
 charged against the appropriations in this act for each such department,
 agency, and the legislature and the judiciary.

  §  13. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdi-
 vision, section or part of this act shall be adjudged by  any  court  of
 A. 9771  13
 
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
 
  § 14. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  be  deemed  to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 1, 2024; provided,
 however, that upon the transfer of expenditures and disbursements by the
 comptroller  as  provided  in  section twelve of this act, the appropri-
 ations made by this act and subject to  such  section  shall  be  deemed
 repealed.
