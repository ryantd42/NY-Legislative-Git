  §  99-M.  MUNICIPAL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER REVOLVING LOAN FUND.  1.
 THERE IS HEREBY ESTABLISHED IN THE JOINT CUSTODY OF THE COMPTROLLER  AND
 THE  PUBLIC  SERVICE  COMMISSION  A  FUND  TO BE KNOWN AS THE "MUNICIPAL
 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER REVOLVING LOAN FUND". SUCH FUND SHALL  CONSIST
 OF MONEYS MADE AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO APPROPRIATION AND ANY OTHER SOURCES
 IN  ORDER  TO  PROVIDE  SUPPORT  FOR MUNICIPALITIES ATTEMPTING TO CREATE
 THEIR OWN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER.
  2. THE ACCOUNT SHALL  CONSIST  OF  ALL  MONEYS  APPROPRIATED  FOR  ITS
 PURPOSE, ALL MONEYS TRANSFERRED TO SUCH ACCOUNT PURSUANT TO LAW, AND ALL
 MONEYS  REQUIRED  BY  THIS  SECTION  OR ANY OTHER LAW TO BE PAID INTO OR
 CREDITED TO THIS ACCOUNT, INCLUDING ALL MONEYS RECEIVED BY  THE  ACCOUNT
 OR  DONATED TO IT, PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON LOANS MADE FROM
 THE ACCOUNT, AND ANY INTEREST EARNINGS WHICH MAY ACCRUE FROM THE INVEST-
 MENT OR REINVESTMENT OF MONEYS FROM THE ACCOUNT.
  3. MONEYS OF THE ACCOUNT, WHEN ALLOCATED, SHALL BE  AVAILABLE  TO  THE

 APPLICATION  WHICH  CONTAINS  NO ADEQUATE DEMONSTRATION OF NEED OR WHICH
 WOULD RESULT IN INEQUITABLE OR INEFFICIENT USE  OF  THE  MONEYS  IN  THE
 ACCOUNT.
  (II) IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS ON LOAN APPLICATIONS, THE PUBLIC SERVICE
 COMMISSION  SHALL ASSURE THAT LOAN FUND MONEYS ARE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED
 AMONG ALL GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OF THE STATE.
  (D) THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION SHALL, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT  FEASI-
 BLE,  AND  CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, SEEK TO
 PROVIDE THAT LOANS AUTHORIZED BY THIS  SECTION  REFLECT  AN  APPROPRIATE
 GEOGRAPHIC  DISTRIBUTION,  ARE  DISTRIBUTED  EQUITABLY  AND  ENCOURAGE
 REGIONAL COOPERATION.
  § 2. The sum of two hundred fifty million dollars  ($250,000,000),  or
