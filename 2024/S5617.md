 by chapter 475 of the laws of 2008, are amended to read as follows:
  5. In the case of a sale of part or all of an employer's business, the

 TY closing or mass layoff in accordance with this  section,  up  to  and
 S. 5617  4

 provision of this article, any person who is an employee of  the  seller
 as  of the effective date of the sale shall be considered an employee of
 the purchaser immediately after the effective date of the sale.
  7. Nothing set forth herein shall be read to prevent an  employer  who
 is  not required to comply with the notice requirements of this section,
 to the extent possible, to provide  notice  to  its  employees  about  a
 proposal  to  close  a  [plant] FACILITY or permanently reduce its work-
 force.
  § 4. Subdivision 1 of section 860-c of the  labor  law,  as  added  by
 chapter 475 of the laws of 2008, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  In  the  case  of  a  [plant]  FACILITY closing OR MASS LAYOFF, an
 employer is not required to comply with the notice requirement in subdi-
 vision one of section eight hundred sixty-b of this article if:
  (a)[(i) at the time the notice would have been required, the  employer
 was actively seeking capital or business; and
  (ii)  the  capital or business sought, if obtained, would have enabled
 the employer to avoid or postpone the relocation or termination; and
  (iii) the employer reasonably and in good faith believed  that  giving
 the  notice required by subdivision one of section eight hundred sixty-b
 of this article would have precluded the  employer  from  obtaining  the
 needed capital or business;
  (b)  the  need for a notice was not reasonably foreseeable at the time
 the notice would have been required;
  (c)] the [plant] FACILITY closing is of a temporary  facility  or  the

 [six] THREE months which, at its outset, was  announced  to  be  a  mass
 layoff  of [six] THREE months or less WITH AN ANNOUNCED EXPECTED DATE OF
 RECALL shall be treated as an employment loss under this article unless:
  1. the extension beyond [six]  THREE  months  is  caused  by  business
 circumstances  (including  unforeseeable  changes  in price or cost) not
 reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial mass layoff; and
  2. notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable  that
 the extension beyond [six] THREE months will be required.
  §  6.  Section  860-e of the labor law, as added by chapter 475 of the
 laws of 2008, is amended to read as follows:
 S. 5617  5

 TEN  of  section  eight hundred sixty-a of this article but which in the
 aggregate meet or exceed that minimum number set forth in such  subdivi-
 sions,  and which occur within any ninety-day period shall be considered
 to be a [plant] FACILITY closing or  mass  layoff  unless  the  employer
 demonstrates  that  the employment losses are the result of separate and
 distinct actions and causes and are not an attempt by  the  employer  to
 evade the requirements of this article.
  §  7.  The section heading of section 860-g of the labor law, as added
 by chapter 475 of the laws of 2008, is amended to read as follows:

 employer, whichever period is smaller.
  4. The amount of an employer's liability under subdivision one of this

 employer's  violation,  paid  by the employer to the employee during the
 period of the employer's violation.

 the employee that were not required to satisfy any legal obligation.
  (c)  Any payments by the employer to a third party or trustee, such as
 premiums for health benefits  or  payments  to  a  defined  contribution
 pension  plan,  on  behalf  of  and attributable to the employee for the
 period of the violation.
  (d) Any liability paid by the employer under  any  applicable  federal
 law  governing  notification of mass layoffs, [plant] FACILITY closings,

 result of a private action brought under this article.
  (f) In a private action brought under this article, any liability paid
 by  the  employer  in  an  administrative proceeding by the commissioner
 prior to the adjudication of such private action.
  6. [If an employer proves to the satisfaction of the commissioner that
 the act or omission that violated this article was  in  good  faith  and
 that  the  employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or
 omission was not a violation of this article, the commissioner  may,  in
 his  or  her  discretion, reduce the amount of liability provided for in
 this section. In determining the amount of such reduction,  the  commis-
 sioner  shall  consider  (a) the size of the employer; (b) the hardships
 imposed on employees by the violation; (c) any efforts by  the  employer
 to  mitigate  the  violation;  and  (d)  the  grounds for the employer's
 belief.]
  (A) WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AFTER A NATURAL  DISASTER,  SUCH  AS  A  FLOOD,
 EARTHQUAKE,  OR DROUGHT, AN EMPLOYER MAY MAKE APPLICATION TO THE COMMIS-
 SIONER FOR A REDUCTION IN LIABILITY IMPOSED UNDER THIS ARTICLE. IF  SUCH
 EMPLOYER  PROVES, TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE COMMISSIONER, THAT THE MASS
 S. 5617  6
 
 LAYOFF, RELOCATION OR EMPLOYMENT LOSS OUT OF WHICH LIABILITY AROSE WAS A
 DIRECT RESULT OF SUCH NATURAL DISASTER, THE COMMISSIONER MAY, IN HIS  OR
 HER  DISCRETION,  REDUCE ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH MASS LAYOFF,
 RELOCATION  OR  EMPLOYMENT  LOSS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS ARTICLE, INCLUDING
 THE SEVERANCE OBLIGATIONS PROVIDED BY SUBDIVISION TEN OF  THIS  SECTION.
 IN  DETERMINING  THE  AMOUNT OF ANY APPROVED REDUCTION, THE COMMISSIONER
 SHALL CONSIDER:(I) THE SIZE OF THE EMPLOYER; (II) THE HARDSHIPS  IMPOSED
 ON EMPLOYEES BY ANY AND ALL VIOLATIONS; (III) ANY EFFORTS BY THE EMPLOY-
 ER  TO MITIGATE ANY VIOLATION OR VIOLATIONS AND ANY REDUCTION IN LIABIL-
 ITY TO EMPLOYEES; AND (IV) THE DEGREE OF HARM CAUSED TO THE EMPLOYER AND
 THE EMPLOYEES BY THE NATURAL DISASTER.

 TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES. THE COURT  MAY
 AWARD  REASONABLE  ATTORNEY'S FEES AS PART OF COSTS TO ANY PLAINTIFF WHO
 PREVAILS IN A CIVIL ACTION BROUGHT UNDER THIS ARTICLE.
  8. Neither the commissioner nor any court shall have the authority  to
 enjoin a [plant] FACILITY closing, relocation, or mass layoff under this

 TION,  AND  UPON  NOTICE TO THE DEFENDANT OF NOT LESS THAN FIVE DAYS, TO
 ENJOIN AND RESTRAIN THE ACTIONS OF SUCH  EMPLOYER  OR  TAKE  SUCH  OTHER
 ACTIONS  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL  MAY  DEEM  APPROPRIATE  TO  ENFORCE THE
 PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION.  IN CONNECTION  WITH  ANY
 SUCH  PROPOSED  APPLICATION,  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE
 PROOF AND MAKE A DETERMINATION  OF  THE  RELEVANT  FACTS  AND  TO  ISSUE
 SUBPOENAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES.
  9.  NO  WAIVERS  OF  LIABILITY UNDER THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE
 UNLESS SUPERVISED BY A COURT, THE COMMISSIONER OR CERTIFIED CLASS  COUN-
 SEL.
  10.  WHENEVER  THERE  IS  A  PLANT CLOSING, RELOCATION, OR MASS LAYOFF
 UNDER THIS ARTICLE, THE EMPLOYER SHALL PAY SEVERANCE  TO  EACH  EMPLOYEE
 ENTITLED  TO  NOTICE WHO LOST HIS OR HER EMPLOYMENT EQUAL TO ONE WEEK OF
 PAY FOR EACH FULL YEAR OF EMPLOYMENT. AN  EMPLOYER  WHO  FAILS  TO  GIVE
 NOTICE  AS REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION EIGHT
 HUNDRED SIXTY-B OF THIS ARTICLE BEFORE ORDERING  A  MASS  LAYOFF,  RELO-
 CATION,  OR  EMPLOYMENT  LOSS SHALL PAY EACH SUCH EMPLOYEE AN ADDITIONAL
 FOUR WEEKS OF SEVERANCE PAY. THE RATE OF SEVERANCE PAY PROVIDED  BY  THE
 EMPLOYER  PURSUANT  TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE THE AVERAGE REGULAR RATE OF
 COMPENSATION RECEIVED BY THE EMPLOYEE DURING THE  LAST  THREE  YEARS  OF
 EMPLOYMENT  WITH  THE  EMPLOYER, OR THE EMPLOYEE'S FINAL REGULAR RATE OF
 COMPENSATION, WHICHEVER IS  HIGHER.  SEVERANCE  UNDER  THIS  SUBDIVISION
 SHALL  BE REGARDED AS COMPENSATION DUE TO AN EMPLOYEE FOR LOSSES ASSOCI-
 ATED WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP, AND EARNED  IN
 FULL  UPON THE TERMINATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP, NOTWITHSTAND-
 ING THE CALCULATION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT WITH REFERENCE  TO  THE
 EMPLOYEE'S  LENGTH  OF SERVICE. THE EMPLOYER SHALL PAY THE SEVERANCE PAY
 REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION OR THE SEVERANCE PAY REQUIRED BY A
 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT OR FOR ANY OTHER  REASON,  WHICHEVER  IS

 S. 5617  7
 
 PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION  EIGHT  HUNDRED  SIXTY-B  OF

 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION OR SUBSECTION 5 OF SECTION 2104 OF THE  FEDERAL
 WORKER  ADJUSTMENT AND RETRAINING NOTIFICATION ACT (29 U.S.C.  SEC. 2104
 ET SEQ.), BECAUSE OF A VIOLATION OF SUBSECTION 3 OF SECTION 2102 OF SUCH
 ACT (29 U.S.C. SEC. 2102 ET SEQ.). NO WAIVER OF THE RIGHT  TO  SEVERANCE
 PROVIDED  PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SUBDIVISION  SHALL  BE  EFFECTIVE  WITHOUT
 APPROVAL OF THE WAIVER BY THE  COMMISSIONER  OR  A  COURT  OF  COMPETENT
 JURISDICTION.
  §  9.  Severability. If any provision or application of this act shall
 be held to be invalid, or to violate or be inconsistent with any  appli-
 cable  federal law or regulation, that shall not affect other provisions
 or applications of this act which  can  be  given  effect  without  that
 provision  or  application; and to that end, the provisions and applica-
 tions of this act are severable.
  § 10. This act shall take effect immediately.
