 PROOF THAT A COURT PROCEEDING THAT HAS BEEN INITIATED AGAINST THE APPLI-
 CANT OR RECIPIENT SHALL NOT BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH  EMERGENCY  CIRCUM-
 STANCES  SUFFICIENT  FOR  THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO COVER
 RENT ARREARS.
  § 2. Section 131 of the social services law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 21 to read as follows:
  21. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW, RULE OR REGULATION TO THE CONTRARY,
 ANY EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO PAY RENT ARREARS MAY BE PROVIDED FOR A PERI-
 OD  OF  UP  TO  TWELVE  MONTHS,  UNLESS A LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT
 DETERMINES IN ITS DISCRETION THAT ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE IS NECESSARY  TO
 COVER  RENT  ARREARS  IN  A  PARTICULAR CASE.  A RECIPIENT OF EMERGENCY
 ASSISTANCE FOR PAYMENT OF RENT ARREARS SHALL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR  SUBSE-
 QUENT  EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO PAY RENT ARREARS FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST
 TWENTY-FOUR MONTHS UNLESS THE LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICT  DETERMINES
 AT  ITS  DISCRETION  THAT ADDITIONAL RENT ARREARS PAYMENTS ARE NECESSARY
 BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL CASE CIRCUMSTANCES.
  § 3. Subdivision 3 of section 350-j of the  social  services  law,  as
 amended  by  section 38 of part B of chapter 436 of the laws of 1997, is
 amended to read as follows:
  3.  Emergency assistance to needy families  with  children  shall  be
 provided  to  the  extent  of  items  of  need and services set forth in
 sections one hundred thirty-one and one  hundred  thirty-one-a  of  this
 [chapter]  ARTICLE,  and  items of medical services set forth in section
 three hundred sixty-five-a of this [chapter] ARTICLE, and in amounts set
 forth in the regulations of the department for children who are  without
 available  resources,  and  when  such  assistance is necessary to avoid
 destitution or to provide them with living arrangements  in  a  home  TO
 PREVENT  LOSS  OF  LIVING ARRANGEMENTS RESULTING FROM THE NON-PAYMENT OF
 RENT, and such destitution or such need did not arise because such chil-
 dren or relatives refused without good cause  to  accept  employment  or
 training  for employment; provided, however, that no assistance shall be
 provided which would duplicate assistance  under  sections  one  hundred
 thirty-one  and  one  hundred  thirty-one-a  of this article for which a
 person is eligible or would be eligible but for a sanction for violation
 of the requirements of title nine-B of THIS article [five of this  chap-
 ter]  or  other  requirement  of  state  law  and provided further that,
 notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this  section  or  section
 one  hundred  thirty-one-a  of this article, persons for whom preventive
 services are being provided under title four  of  article  six  of  this
 chapter  or  who  are  living in foster care or in public, congregate or
 group facilities, such as residential facilities for victims of domestic
 violence, may, pursuant to regulations of the department within  amounts
 specifically  appropriated therefor and subject  to the terms and condi-
 tions of such  appropriation,  receive  assistance  hereunder  on  their
 behalf  for  such  services  or  for  care in such facilities in amounts
 exceeding those set forth in section one hundred  thirty-one-a  of  this
 article.
  § 4. Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part
 of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to
 be invalid and after exhaustion of  all  further  judicial  review,  the
 judgment  shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof,
 but shall be confined in its operation to the  clause,  sentence,  para-
 graph,  section or part of this act directly involved in the controversy
 in which the judgment shall have been rendered.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
