  Section 1. Section 390-e of the general business law, as  added  by  a

 install any keyless security device used to control and secure access to
 the common areas of any residential building without the express written
 consent of the owner, board of managers, board of directors, or  author-
 ized  party  of  such property. Where a keyless security device has been
 authorized, any installation of such device shall be  performed  by,  or
 with  the  consent  of,  the owner, property manager, board of managers,
 board of directors, or authorized party in place in such  building.  THE
 OWNER,  BOARD  OF  MANAGERS,  BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OR AUTHORIZED PARTY OF

 INCORPORATION OR THE BY-LAWS OF A COOPERATIVE OR CONDOMINIUM, THE OWNER,
