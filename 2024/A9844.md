  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would permit counties that participate in the New York State
 and Local Employees' Retirement  System  to  elect  to  provide  members
 employed in the title of police communications operator, police communi-
 cations  operator  supervisor,  assistant  bureau  director  (police 911
 communications) or  bureau  director  (police  911  communications)  the
 option  to  retire  upon  completion  of twenty-five years of creditable
 service with a benefit of one-half of final average salary (FAS) and for
 Tiers 3 through 6 an additional benefit of one-sixtieth of FAS for  each
 year of creditable service in excess of twenty-five years, not to exceed
 fifteen  years.  Additionally,  for  those  members  covered  under  the
 provisions of Article 14, this bill would permit an irrevocable election
 to forfeit the benefits of Article 14 in favor of  the  twenty-five-year
 plan  benefit.  Such election must be made within one year of the effec-
 tive date of this bill or within one year of entering employment with an
 electing county in any of the above titles, whichever comes later.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase in the annual contributions  of  an
 electing  county  of approximately 5% of salary paid to eligible members
 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. In  future  years  this  cost
 will vary as the billing rates of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an  immediate  past  service cost of approximately 16% of salary paid to
 eligible members which will be borne by the electing county  as  a  one-
 time  payment. This estimate assumes that payment will be made on Febru-
 ary 1, 2025.
 A. 9844  6
 
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this  legislation  cannot  be  readily  determined.
 Prior  to electing to provide these benefits, a county would be required
 to submit a roster of eligible members to the New York State  and  Local
 Retirement  System. This roster would be used to determine an exact cost
 to the electing county.
