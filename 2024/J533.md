  COMMENDING  Theodore  Naftali  Schischa  upon  the
  occasion  of  his  designation  as  recipient  of  a
  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest honor bestowed upon an
  individual by the New York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Theodore  Naftali Schischa upon the occasion of his designation
as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Early in the morning on Thursday, January 26, 2023, JetBlue
flight 571 was enroute from New York to Florida when about an hour  into
the  flight  a  woman  suddenly  fainted  in the aisle; fortunately, EMT
Theodore Naftali Schischa from the  Hatzoloh  in  Rockland  County,  New
York,  immediately  sprang  into action and knelt to check on the woman;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Using his  extensive  experience  and  knowledge,  Theodore
Naftali  Schischa  checked  her pulse and placed an oxygen mask over the
woman's mouth and nose and through his due diligence, she  came  to  and
was conscious and talking when the plane landed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to Theodore Naftali Schischa's expertise, the plane was
able  to continue to Florida without further incident, and the woman was
treated on the scene by Broward County Sheriff emergency responders  and
did not have to go to the hospital; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Theodore  Naftali  Schischa, in his spontaneous and heroic
act, has so aptly demonstrated his  character  and  compassion  for  the
welfare of others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective
concern  of ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who
voluntarily respond without thought of danger or reward when others  are
in need of help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Theodore Naftali Schischa upon the occasion of  his  designation
as  recipient  of  a  Liberty  Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Theodore Naftali Schischa.
