 service,  despite  customers'  requests  to  remain on copper wire based
 service;
  c. the number and location of service areas  where  both  the  company
 informed  customers  that the customer's copper wire based service shall
 be discontinued and where customers also did not  have  the  ability  to
 switch to fiber based service at the time of such notification;
  d.  the  number  of  customers who requested or attempted to return to
