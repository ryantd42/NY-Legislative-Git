 INDIVIDUALS AS A PRIVATE DWELLING, ABODE OR PLACE OF RESIDENCE,  BUT  IT
 SHALL  NOT APPLY TO ANY PERSON WHO FOR ANOTHER AND FOR A FEE, COMMISSION
 OR OTHER VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, SUPERVISES, ORGANIZES, ARRANGES,  COOR-
 DINATES,  HANDLES  OR  IS  OTHERWISE IN CHARGE OF OR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
 RELOCATION OF COMMERCIAL OR RESIDENTIAL TENANTS FROM BUILDINGS OR STRUC-
 TURES THAT ARE TO BE DEMOLISHED, REHABILITATED, REMODELED  OR  OTHERWISE
 STRUCTURALLY ALTERED.
  §  4.  The provisions of this act requiring the licensure of apartment
 information vendors as real estate  brokers  shall  not  affect  persons
 holding  an  apartment  information vendor license, during the unexpired
 period of time such persons are currently licensed under article 12-C of
 the real property law, prior to the date this act shall  have  become  a
 law,  but  all  requirements of practice as set forth in article 12-A of
 the real property law shall govern the  practice  and  conduct  of  such
 apartment information vendor licensees.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after

 state and the state real estate board may adopt  such  rules  and  regu-
 lations as may be necessary for the implementation of this act.
