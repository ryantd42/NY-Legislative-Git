 AN ACT in relation to determining whether the state  can  claim  federal
  financial  participation  for  coverage  of  and  payment  for certain
  evidence-based mobile medical applications

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and  declaration.  Within the past
 decade, it has become clear more needs to be done for New  Yorkers  with
 substance  use  disorders.  From  2010 to 2021, the number of fatal drug
 overdoses in New York state alone increased from 1,557  to  5,841.  This
 problem  was  only  exacerbated  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic, which was a
 relapse and addiction  catalyst  for  many  individuals.  Evidence-based
 smartphone  apps  are new, software-based disease treatments designed to
 directly treat disease, tested for safety  and  efficacy  in  randomized
 clinical  trials, evaluated by  the FDA,  and  prescribed  by healthcare
 providers. These  therapies  are designed and tested  much  like  tradi-
 tional prescription  drugs  with  one distinction: rather  than swallow-
 ing  a pill  or taking an injection, patients are treated with software.
 Certain  evidence-based  smartphone  apps  provide  clinicians and
 patients  with  evidence-based  remote  treatment  modalities  to  treat
 substance  and  opioid  use  disorders, mental health,  and  other
 diseases and conditions. However, there is no  clear  statutory  benefit
 category  to allow Medicaid coverage for evidence-based smartphone apps.
 In light of the promise of  evidence-based  smartphone apps  for  the
 treatment  of  patients  with  substance  use and opioid use disorders
 during  the  COVID-19 pandemic,  this  legislation  would require  that
 the  New  York state department of health seek guidance from the Centers
 for Medicare and Medicaid Services  relative  to  a  coverage  and
 reimbursement  pathway for evidence-based smartphone apps, in order to
 accelerate access to such therapies for enrollees.
