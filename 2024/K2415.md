  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2024, as Pet Rescue Awareness Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the sense of this Legislative Body that all living
creatures have value  and  to  recognize  and  appreciate  the  service,
companionship,  loyalty,  unconditional love and happiness animals bring
to the lives of New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2024,  as  Pet
Rescue Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are approximately 13,600 independent community animal
shelters  nationwide,  and  there is no national organization monitoring
these  shelters;  currently,  no  government  institution  or  animal
organization  is  responsible for tabulating national statistics for the
animal protection movement; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than seven  million  companion  animals  enter  animal
shelters  nationwide  every  year, of which 3.9 million are dogs and 3.4
million are cats; most of these animals are given up by their owners  or
found by Animal Control on the streets; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately  2.7  million dogs and cats are killed every
year because shelters are too full and there  are  not  enough  adoptive
homes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year,  1.2  million  dogs  and  1.4 million cats are
euthanized, while 2.7 million of these shelter animals are adopted; and
 
  WHEREAS, Only about 649,000 animals who enter shelters as strays are
returned to their owners; of those, 542,000 are  dogs  and  100,000  are
cats; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  United States, only one out of every 10 dogs born
will find a permanent home;  in  addition,  homeless  animals  outnumber
homeless people five to one; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Of  the dogs entering shelters, 35 percent are adopted, 31
percent are euthanized and 26 percent of dogs who came in as strays  are
returned  to their owner; furthermore, of the cats entering shelters, 37
percent are adopted, 41 percent  are  euthanized,  and  less  than  five
percent of cats who came in as strays are returned to their owners; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  vital that we encourage empathy and compassion for
our companion animals, and that we provide a voice for those who  cannot
speak for themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  New York State in the month of October, animal
advocates,  supporters,  pet  owners,  and  citizens  come  together  to
 
protect,  and acknowledge all animals' positive contribution to society;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  October  2024,  as  Pet
Rescue Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
