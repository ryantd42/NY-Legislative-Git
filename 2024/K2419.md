Assembly Resolution No. 2419
 
BY: M. of A. Miller
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  125th  Anniversary  of  Oneida
  Health
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize those
institutions which have  faithfully  served  the  health  needs  of  the
community  and  its  citizens  with  unwavering  diligence,  unrelenting
compassion, and a strong sense of commitment to  upholding  the  highest
practices and standards in their field; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 125th Anniversary of Oneida Health; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1894, a railroad accident in Oneida brought to light the
need for immediate health care services; with a makeshift treatment room
established  at  the  Presbyterian Church to treat the railroad victims,
the concept of delivering organized healthcare services in the community
was born; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1899, Oneida Mayor, J.M. Goldstein  donated  a  plot  of
land  on Williams Street and Oneida Health opened the doors to its first
hospital, a four-bed city-operated facility; after an  expansion  a  few
years  later,  it  was clear more was needed, and the first Broad Street
Hospital was built in 1906,  followed  by  a  new  80-bed  Board  Street
facility in 1938; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1972, a 126-bed hospital opened its doors at 321 Genesee
Street  which  serves  as the hospital's primary location today, and two
years later, the Broad Street facility  was  converted  into  a  skilled
nursing  facility,  marking  the  beginning  stages  of  Oneida Health's
healthcare system; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  the  1990s  and  2000s,  Oneida  Health  saw
tremendous  growth  in services offered with the expansion of outpatient
locations; this transformed Oneida Health into an integrated  healthcare
system; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recognizing  the  need  for  primary  and  preventive care
services, Oneida Health opened its first outpatient office in Camden  in
1991  marking  the  beginning of what is now a six-location primary care
network with 18 primary care providers; to support access to  diagnostic
services,  Oneida  Health expanded its lab and imaging services with the
development of five outpatient lab draw  locations  and  two  outpatient
imaging centers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the expansion of primary care, Oneida Health
recognized  the need for increased access to specialty services close to
home; this commitment  has  created  an  integrated  healthcare  network
offering  specialty  services  that  include:  allergy;  breast surgery;
cardiology; convenient care; ear, nose,  and  throat;  gastroenterology;
neurology;  obstetrics  and gynecology; oncology; orthopedics; podiatry;
pulmonology; sleep; vascular; and wound care; and
 
  WHEREAS, With a strong belief in leading-edge technology,  in  2002,
Oneida  Health  was  the  first  hospital  in  Central New York (CNY) to
introduce computer aided mammography; this was later followed  by  being
among  the  first  in  CNY  to  invest  in  3D mammography, the new gold
standard  in  early  breast  cancer  detection;  this revered healthcare
system also has instituted robotic surgery in 2012 to  provide  TrueBeam
radiotherapy,  the  most  advanced  linear  accelerator and radiosurgery
treatment system available; and
 
  WHEREAS, By developing strategic partnerships, Oneida Health is able
to bring in a high level of expertise in  specialized  areas  to  become
operational  in  a  short  time  frame;  the  William L. Griffin Medical
Oncology Center, Dorothy G. Griffin Radiation Oncology Center,  and  the
Oneida  Health  Wound  Care Center are shining examples of the result of
such impactful partnerships and collaborations  with  entities  such  as
Roswell  Health  Network  and  Restorix, bringing nuanced and vital care
close to home for many residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, A testament  to  its  dedication  to  outstanding  service,
compassionate  patient  care,  extensive  knowledge,  and vast treatment
opportunities, Oneida Health has received  the  following  distinctions:
the  region's only 5-star rated hospital by the Centers for Medicaid and
Medicare (CMS) for quality care  in  2021;  ranked  in  the  top  2%  of
hospitals  nationally  for  patient  safety  and  patient  experience by
Healthgrades in 2019; Women's Choice Award for Best  100  Hospitals  for
Patient  Experience  four  years in a row, 2020-2023; and is a five-star
recipient for Vaginal Delivery from Healthgrades for 5 years  in  a  row
(2015-2019); and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  pillar of its community, Oneida Health today includes a
101-bed acute care hospital, state-of-the-art  robotic  surgery  center,
160  bed  extended-care  facility,  multiple  primary  and  urgent  care
offices,  comprehensive  lab  and  imaging  services,  outpatient  and
inpatient therapy, and a variety of specialty services providing care to
approximately  29  communities  with  a  population  of  over  a 100,000
throughout Madison and Oneida counties; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the Oneida Health is in  direct  correlation
to  the  efforts  of  its  host  of  dedicated leaders, doctors, nurses,
support staff, and community groups and  volunteers,  whose  involvement
is,  and  always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an
unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard  of  excellence  in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  this Legislative Body
acknowledges this  exceptional  institution  and  its  vibrant  role  in
improving  the quality of life in its community, fully confident it will
continue to enjoy the same sparkling successes it has  experienced  thus
far; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 125th Anniversary of Oneida Health; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Oneida Health.
