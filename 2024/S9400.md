 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to requiring  limited
  services  pregnancy  centers  to  disclose to clients that they do not
  have a licensed medical provider on staff
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 it is in the state's interest to ensure pregnant New Yorkers have timely
 access to the full range of reproductive health services that are avail-
 able  to  them,  including  prenatal  care, emergency contraception, and
 abortion. Article 25-A of the public health law, commonly referred to as
 the reproductive health act of 2019 guarantees this right, clearly stat-
 ing that "every individual who  becomes  pregnant  has  the  fundamental
 right  to  choose  to  carry  the  pregnancy to term, to give birth to a
 child, or to have an abortion, pursuant to this article".
  Moreover, the legislature finds that due to the  sensitive  timing  of
 receiving  emergency  contraception,  the importance of receiving prompt
 prenatal care in ensuring a healthy pregnancy, and statutory  timeframes
 that  limit the legality of abortion services, pregnant New Yorkers must
 receive timely and accurate information regarding their  pregnancy.  The
 health care options available to them must be presented free from unnec-
 essary  delay  or  religious or moral persuasion. Any delay in receiving
 reproductive health care services can lead to negative outcomes for  the
 pregnant  person  and  their  fetus,  or  a  complete loss in ability to
 receive emergency contraception or abortion services, effectively elimi-
 nating their reproductive autonomy.
  The legislature is aware that some limited service  pregnancy  centers
 that are ideologically opposed to comprehensive reproductive health care
 employ  deceptive  practices on customers that avail themselves of their
 services. These  practices  include  presenting  themselves  as  medical
 facilities  through  the  use  of  medical  history and health insurance
 intake, wearing of medical clothes and devices such  as  lab  coats  and
 stethoscopes, and siting of facilities near licensed health care facili-

 ties.  Pregnant  New  Yorkers who have visited limited service pregnancy
 centers that are religiously or philosophically opposed to abortion have
 been inappropriately led to believe that they have received care from  a
 New  York state licensed health care professional. Although the legisla-
 ture respects  the  right  for  individuals  to  seek  any  reproductive
 services they wish to seek, it is critical that pregnant New Yorkers are
 not  misled into believing they have received services and medical coun-
 seling from a licensed provider when in  actuality  they  have  received
 unlicensed  counseling  from  someone  who  is  unwilling to objectively
 discuss how to seek emergency contraception or abortion, and  is  unable
 to refer for those services.
  Therefore,  it  is  the  intent  of the legislature to ensure pregnant
 individuals are fully informed as to whether they are receiving services
 and counseling from a  licensed  medical  professional  when  they  seek
 prenatal care, emergency contraception, or abortion services.
