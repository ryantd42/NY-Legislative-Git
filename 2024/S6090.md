 INJURED OR LIKELY TO BE INJURED BY A VIOLATION OR IMPENDING VIOLATION OF
 THIS ARTICLE OR ANY RULES OR REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

 ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE COURT SHALL PRESUME THE EXISTENCE OF IRREPARA-

  § 698-D. DUTY OF GOOD FAITH. EVERY FRANCHISE SHALL INCLUDE AN  IMPLIED
 DUTY  UPON  ALL  PARTIES  TO  EXERCISE GOOD FAITH IN THE PERFORMANCE AND
 ENFORCEMENT OF THE TERMS OF THE FRANCHISE. SUCH DUTY OF GOOD FAITH OBLI-
 GATES EACH PARTY TO A FRANCHISE, WHEN MAKING A DECISION OR EXERCISING  A
 RESERVED  POWER  OR  DISCRETION  WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE INTERESTS OF
 ANOTHER PARTY OR PARTIES TO THE FRANCHISE, TO GIVE DUE AND EQUAL  REGARD
 TO  THE  INTERESTS OF SUCH OTHER PARTY OR PARTIES TO THE FRANCHISES THAT
 ARE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED.
  § 698-E. DUTY OF COMPETENCE. UNLESS A FRANCHISOR  REPRESENTS  THAT  IT
 HAS  GREATER  SKILL OR KNOWLEDGE, OR CONSPICUOUSLY DISCLAIMS THAT IT HAS
 SUCH SKILL OR KNOWLEDGE, THE FRANCHISOR SHALL, IN ITS  UNDERTAKING  WITH
 THE FRANCHISEE, BE REQUIRED TO EXERCISE THE SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE NORMALLY
 POSSESSED  BY  FRANCHISORS  IN  GOOD  STANDING IN SIMILAR COMMUNITIES OR
 TRADE AREAS. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE WAIVED OR QUAL-
 IFIED BY AGREEMENT OR BY CONDUCT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FRANCHISOR
 MAY BY WRITTEN AGREEMENT PARTICULARLY DEFINE THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF ITS
 SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE, AND OF ITS UNDERTAKING WITH THE FRANCHISEE.
  § 698-F. NEGOTIATED CHANGES PERMITTED. A FRANCHISOR, WHO HAS  LAWFULLY
 DELIVERED  AN  OFFERING  TO  A PROSPECTIVE FRANCHISEE, MAY NEGOTIATE THE
 TERMS OF A FRANCHISE WITH SUCH PROSPECTIVE FRANCHISEE, AND MAY EXECUTE A
 FRANCHISE CONTAINING NEGOTIATED  TERMS  WHICH  ARE  DIFFERENT  FROM  THE
 INITIAL OFFERING.
  §  698-G.  INDEPENDENT  SOURCING.  1.  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN
 SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION,  A  FRANCHISEE  MAY  OBTAIN  EQUIPMENT,
 FIXTURES,  SUPPLIES AND SERVICES USED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION
 OF A FRANCHISED BUSINESS FROM SOURCES OF THE FRANCHISEE'S OWN  CHOOSING,
 S. 6090  4
 
 PROVIDED  THAT  SUCH GOODS AND SERVICES SHALL MEET REASONABLE STANDARDS,
 AS TO THEIR NATURE AND QUALITY, AS PROMULGATED BY THE FRANCHISOR.
  2. SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO A REQUIREMENT BY
 A  FRANCHISOR  THAT REASONABLE QUANTITIES OF INVENTORY GOODS OR SERVICES
 (INCLUDING DISPLAY AND SAMPLE ITEMS) BE OBTAINED FROM THE FRANCHISOR  OR
 ITS  AFFILIATE,  IF  SUCH GOODS OR SERVICES ARE A CENTRAL FEATURE OF THE
 FRANCHISE BUSINESS AND:
  (A) ARE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED OR PRODUCED BY  THE  FRANCHISOR  OR  ITS
 AFFILIATE; OR
  (B)  ARE MANUFACTURED SOLELY ON BEHALF OF THE FRANCHISOR OR ITS AFFIL-
 IATE AND INCORPORATE A TRADE SECRET  OWNED  BY  THE  FRANCHISOR  OR  ITS
 AFFILIATE.

 REFUSE TO RENEW A FRANCHISE WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE.
  § 698-I. TRANSFER OF A FRANCHISE. 1. A FRANCHISEE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT
 TO  TRANSFER THE FRANCHISED BUSINESS AND THE FRANCHISE TO ANOTHER PERSON
 WHO MEETS THE FRANCHISOR'S CURRENT REASONABLE, ESSENTIAL AND  NONDISCRI-
 MINATORY  STANDARDS FOR NEW FRANCHISEES OR TRANSFEREES. A FRANCHISOR MAY
 NOT WITHHOLD ITS CONSENT TO A  TRANSFER  OF  A  FRANCHISE  WITHOUT  GOOD
 CAUSE.
  2. A FRANCHISOR MAY EXERCISE A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL IN RELATION TO A
 PROPOSED  TRANSFER,  IF  THE  FRANCHISOR  HAS RESERVED SUCH RIGHT IN THE
 FRANCHISE. HOWEVER, A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL SHALL NOT BE  INVOKED  MORE
 THAN  THIRTY  DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF THE FRANCHISEE'S REQUEST FOR CONSENT
 TO THE TRANSFER.  SUCH RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL MAY NOT  BE  EXERCISED  IF
 THE  RESULT WOULD BE TO LEAVE THE FRANCHISOR HOLDING A PARTIAL OWNERSHIP
 INTEREST IN THE FRANCHISE OR FRANCHISEE. A FRANCHISOR  SHALL  ONLY  BASE
 ITS DECISION TO EXERCISE A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL IN A PROPOSED TRANSFER
 OF A FRANCHISE, UPON THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSED TRANSFER AND THE PARTIC-
 ULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PROPOSED TRANSFER.
  3. A FRANCHISOR MAY REQUIRE AS CONDITIONS OF A TRANSFER THAT:
  (A)  THE TRANSFEREE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES A REASONABLE, ESSENTIAL AND
 NONDISCRIMINATORY TRAINING PROGRAM;
  (B) A REASONABLE TRANSFER FEE BE PAID TO REIMBURSE THE FRANCHISOR  FOR
 ITS REASONABLE AND ACTUAL EXPENSES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE TRANSFER; AND
  (C) THE FRANCHISEE PAY OR MAKE REASONABLE PROVISIONS TO PAY ANY AMOUNT
 DUE THE FRANCHISOR OR ITS AFFILIATE.
  4. A FRANCHISOR SHALL NOT WITHHOLD ITS CONSENT TO A PUBLIC OFFERING BY
 A  FRANCHISEE  OF ITS SECURITIES, PROVIDED THAT THE FRANCHISEE OR OWNERS
 OF THE FRANCHISE RETAIN MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE VOTING  POWER  IN
 THE  FRANCHISE. A FRANCHISOR SHALL NOT WITHHOLD ITS CONSENT TO A POOLING
 OF INTERESTS OR EXCHANGE OF ASSETS OF ITS EXISTING FRANCHISEES.
  5. A FRANCHISEE MAY ASSIGN ITS INTEREST IN ITS FRANCHISE FOR THE UNEX-
 PIRED TERM OF THE FRANCHISE WITHOUT ANY CHANGE  IN  THE  TERMS  OF  SUCH
 FRANCHISE.  FURTHERMORE, THE FRANCHISOR SHALL NOT REQUIRE THE FRANCHISEE
 OR THE TRANSFEREE TO ENTER INTO ANY NEW OR DIFFERENT  TERMS  DURING  THE
 UNEXPIRED TERM OF THE FRANCHISE.
  6. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION THE FOLLOWING SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE
 A TRANSFER AND A FRANCHISOR SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH:
  (A)  THE SUCCESSION TO OWNERSHIP OR MANAGEMENT OF A FRANCHISE UPON THE
 DEATH OR DISABILITY OF A FRANCHISEE, OR AN OWNER, OFFICER OR DIRECTOR OF
 A FRANCHISEE, BY THE SPOUSE, CHILDREN, PARTNERS OR  FELLOW  SHAREHOLDERS
 OF SUCH DECEASED OR DISABLED PERSON;
  (B) INCORPORATION BY A FRANCHISEE;
 S. 6090  5
 
  (C)  TRANSFER  OF  INTERESTS  WITHIN  AN EXISTING GROUP OF OWNERS OF A
 FRANCHISEE WHEN SUCH TRANSFERS DO NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE CONTROL-
 LING INTEREST IN THE FRANCHISE;
  (D)  TRANSFERS OF LESS THAN A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE FRANCHISE TO
 THE SPOUSE OR CHILDREN OF THE FRANCHISEE, OR OWNERS, OFFICERS OR  DIREC-
 TORS OF THE FRANCHISEE;
  (E)  TRANSFERS  OF  LESS  THAN A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE FRANCHISE
 PURSUANT TO AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN, EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE COMPEN-
 SATION PLAN OR DEFERRED BENEFIT PLAN;
  (F) A GRANT OR RETENTION OF A SECURITY INTEREST IN THE FRANCHISE,  THE
 FRANCHISED BUSINESS OR ITS ASSETS, OR AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE FRAN-
 CHISEE,  PROVIDED  THAT  THE SECURITY AGREEMENT CREATES AN OBLIGATION ON
 THE PART OF THE SECURED PARTY, WHICH IS ENFORCEABLE BY  THE  FRANCHISOR,
 TO GIVE NOTICE TO THE FRANCHISOR SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH NOTICE TO THE FRAN-
 CHISEE  OF THE SECURED PARTY'S INTENTION TO FORECLOSE ON THE COLLATERAL,
 AND GRANTING A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO  REDEEM  THE  INTEREST  OF  THE
 SECURED  PARTY  AND  RELEASE THE SECURED PARTY'S LIEN UPON THE FRANCHISE
 AND THE FRANCHISED BUSINESS BY SATISFYING THE  FRANCHISEE'S  OBLIGATIONS
 TO THE SECURED PARTY; OR
  (G)  THE  FRANCHISEE'S  USE  OF  MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS OR HIRING OF A
 PROFESSIONAL MANAGER.
  7. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (F) OF  SUBDIVISION  SIX  OF
 THIS  SECTION,  NO FRANCHISOR SHALL PREVENT A FRANCHISEE, WHO HAS TRANS-
 FERRED THE FRANCHISE, FROM RETAINING  OR  FORECLOSING  UPON  A  SECURITY
 INTEREST  IN  ONE  OR  MORE ASSETS TRANSFERRED, INCLUDING THE FRANCHISE,
 CREATED TO SECURE THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE TRANSFEREE TO THE TRANSFEROR.
  8. EVERY FRANCHISEE SHALL GIVE ITS FRANCHISOR  NOT  LESS  THAN  THIRTY
 DAYS'  NOTICE  OF  A PROPOSED TRANSFER AND UPON REQUEST SHALL ADVISE THE
 FRANCHISOR, IN WRITING, OF THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF ALL PERSONS  HOLD-
 ING  OR CLAIMING AN EQUITABLE OR BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN THE FRANCHISE OR
 THE FRANCHISEE.
  9. NO FRANCHISOR SHALL TRANSFER ITS INTEREST IN A FRANCHISE UNLESS  IT
 MAKES  REASONABLE PROVISION FOR THE PERFORMANCE BY THE TRANSFEREE OF ITS
 OBLIGATIONS PURSUANT TO THE FRANCHISE. A FRANCHISOR  SHALL  PROVIDE  ITS
 FRANCHISEES  WITH  NOTICE  OF THE PROPOSED TRANSFER AT SUCH TIME AS SUCH
 DISCLOSURE WOULD BE  REQUIRED  PURSUANT  TO  APPLICABLE  SECURITIES  AND
 EXCHANGE LAWS, IF SECURITIES OF THE FRANCHISOR WERE PUBLICLY TRADED.
  10.  A  FRANCHISOR  SHALL  BE OBJECTIVELY REASONABLE IN DETERMINING TO
 WITHHOLD ITS CONSENT TO A PROPOSED TRANSFER OF A FRANCHISE. EVERY TRANS-
 FER SHALL BE DEEMED APPROVED THIRTY DAYS AFTER  THE  FRANCHISEE  SUBMITS
 THE PROPOSED TRANSFER FOR CONSENT TO THE FRANCHISOR, UNLESS THE FRANCHI-
 SOR SHALL EARLIER PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTICE OF ITS DISAPPROVAL, OR EXERCISE
 OF  RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. ALL SUCH NOTICES STATING THE BASES OF DISAP-
 PROVAL SHALL BE PRIVILEGED AGAINST CLAIMS OF DEFAMATION.
  11. NO FRANCHISOR SHALL DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A PROPOSED TRANSFEREE  OF
 A FRANCHISE ON THE BASIS OF RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX,
 OR DISABILITY.
  12.  AS  A CONDITION OF A TRANSFER OF A FRANCHISE, NO FRANCHISOR SHALL
 OBLIGATE A FRANCHISEE TO UNDERTAKE  OTHER  OBLIGATIONS  OR  FORGO  OTHER
 RIGHTS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE FRANCHISE PROPOSED TO BE TRANSFERRED, OR
 TO  ENTER  INTO  RELEASE  OF  CLAIMS BROADER IN SCOPE THAN A COUNTERPART
 RELEASE OF CLAIMS OFFERED BY THE FRANCHISOR TO THE FRANCHISEE.
  13. NO FRANCHISOR SHALL ENFORCE AGAINST THE TRANSFEROR OF A  FRANCHISE
 AFTER  A TRANSFER, ANY COVENANT IN THE TRANSFERRED FRANCHISE PROHIBITING
 THE TRANSFEROR FROM ENGAGING IN ANY  LAWFUL  OCCUPATION  OR  ENTERPRISE.
 HOWEVER, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL NOT LIMIT THE RIGHT OF
 S. 6090  6
 
 THE FRANCHISOR TO ENFORCE CONTRACTUAL COVENANTS PROHIBITING THE TRANSFE-
 ROR FROM EXPLOITING THE FRANCHISOR'S TRADE SECRETS OR INTELLECTUAL PROP-
 ERTY RIGHTS.
  14. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION:
  (A)  "TRANSFER"  SHALL  MEAN  ANY  CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL OF A
 FRANCHISE, FRANCHISED BUSINESS OR FRANCHISEE.
  (B) "FRANCHISE" SHALL INCLUDE FRANCHISEE AS APPROPRIATE IN CONTEXT.
  § 698-J. ANTI-COMPETITIVE COVENANTS. NO FRANCHISOR SHALL  PROHIBIT  OR
 ENFORCE  A  PROHIBITION AGAINST A FRANCHISEE FROM ENGAGING IN ANY LAWFUL
 BUSINESS AT ANY LOCATION AFTER EXPIRATION, TERMINATION FOR GOOD CAUSE OR
 TRANSFER OF A FRANCHISE, UNLESS NOT LESS THAN TEN DAYS BEFORE SUCH EXPI-
 RATION, TERMINATION OR TRANSFER THE  FRANCHISOR  OFFERS  IN  WRITING  TO
 PURCHASE  THE  FRANCHISED  BUSINESS FOR ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE AS A GOING
 CONCERN. SUCH AN OFFER MAY BE CONDITIONED UPON ASCERTAINMENT OF THE FAIR
 MARKET VALUE BY AN IMPARTIAL APPRAISER. THE PROVISIONS OF  THIS  SECTION
 SHALL  NOT PROHIBIT ENFORCEMENT OF PROVISIONS OF A FRANCHISE REQUIRING A
 FRANCHISEE, AFTER EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THE FRANCHISE TO:
  1. ALTER THE APPEARANCE OF THE PREMISES AND THE MANNER OF OPERATION OF
 THE FORMERLY FRANCHISED BUSINESS TO AVOID THE LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION AS
 TO THE AFFILIATION OF THE BUSINESS WITH ITS  FORMER  FRANCHISOR  OR  THE
 ORIGIN OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES IT OFFERS; OR
  2.  CEASE  AND  REFRAIN FROM USING A TRADE SECRET OF THE FRANCHISOR OR
 ITS AFFILIATE.
  § 698-K. FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION. 1. NO FRANCHISOR  SHALL  DIRECTLY  OR
 INDIRECTLY  INHIBIT  ITS FRANCHISEES FROM FORMING AN ASSOCIATION OR FROM
 ASSOCIATING WITH OTHER FRANCHISEES FOR ANY LAWFUL PURPOSE. NOR SHALL ANY
 FRANCHISOR PENALIZE, IN ANY WAY, ITS FRANCHISEES FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES.
  2. EVERY FRANCHISOR WHICH HAS MORE THAN  FIVE  HUNDRED  FRANCHISES  OR
 MORE  THAN  THREE  HUNDRED  FRANCHISEES, WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, SHALL
 HAVE A DUTY TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH WITH AN ORGANIZATION OF  ITS  FRAN-
 CHISEES  WHICH  REPRESENTS  IN  GENERAL OR ON A SPECIFIC ISSUE OR SET OF
 ISSUES A MAJORITY OF ITS FRANCHISEES IN THIS STATE.
  § 698-L. ENCROACHMENT. 1. SUBJECT TO  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISION
 THREE  OF  THIS SECTION, NO FRANCHISOR SHALL PLACE OR LICENSE ANOTHER TO
 PLACE A NEW OUTLET IN AN UNREASONABLE PROXIMITY TO AN ESTABLISHED  FRAN-
 CHISED  OUTLET  WHICH  OFFERS  GOODS  OR SERVICES IDENTIFIED BY THE SAME
 TRADEMARK AS THE NEW OUTLET, IF THE INTENT OR PROBABLE EFFECT OF  ESTAB-
 LISHING  THE  NEW  OUTLET IS TO CAUSE A DIMINUTION OF GROSS SALES BY THE
 EXISTING OUTLET OF MORE THAN TEN PERCENT IN THE TWELVE MONTHS  FOLLOWING
 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW OUTLET.
  2.  A  FRANCHISEE  INJURED OR LIKELY TO BE INJURED BY VIOLATION OF THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION MAY ENJOIN THE VIOLATION OR PENDING VIOLATION
 AND RECOVER DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE VIOLATION, WHICH MAY INCLUDE A REASON-
 ABLE ESTIMATION OF THE PLAINTIFF'S PROFITS LOST AS A CONSEQUENCE OF  THE
 VIOLATION, AND OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF.
  3. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT
 OF  A  NEW OUTLET IF, BEFORE THE NEW OUTLET OPENS FOR BUSINESS THE FRAN-
 CHISOR OFFERS IN WRITING TO THE FRANCHISEE OF THE ESTABLISHED OUTLET  OR
 OUTLETS TO PAY TO THE FRANCHISEE, IF THE SALES OF THE ESTABLISHED OUTLET
 OR OUTLETS DECLINE BY MORE THAN TEN PERCENT IN THE TWELVE MONTHS FOLLOW-
 ING  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW OUTLET AS A CONSEQUENCE OF OPENING THE NEW
 OUTLET, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO TEN PERCENT OF THE GROSS SALES (NET OF  SALES
 TAXES,  RETURNS  AND ALLOWANCES) OF THE NEW OUTLET FOR THE FIRST TWENTY-
 FOUR MONTHS OF THE NEW OUTLET'S OPERATION.
  4. IF THE FRANCHISOR MAKES A WRITTEN OFFER  UNDER  THE  PROVISIONS  OF
 SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF THIS SECTION, OR IN AN ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER
 S. 6090  7
 
 SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION, THE FRANCHISOR HAS THE BURDEN OF  PROOF
 TO  SHOW  THAT, OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH, A DECLINE IN SALES OF THE ESTAB-
 LISHED FRANCHISE OUTLET OR OUTLETS OCCURRED FOR REASONS OTHER  THAN  THE
 OPENING OF THE NEW OUTLET.
  §  698-M. DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED. IN GRANTING FRANCHISES, CONSIDER-
 ING APPROVAL OF TRANSFERS OF FRANCHISES, AND IN ADMINISTERING ITS  FRAN-
 CHISE  SYSTEM,  A FRANCHISOR SHALL NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A FRANCHISEE
 OR PROSPECTIVE  FRANCHISEE  ON  THE  BASIS  OF  RACE,  COLOR,  RELIGION,
 NATIONAL ORIGIN, SEX, OR DISABILITY.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
