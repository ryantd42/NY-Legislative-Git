 2007, is amended to read as follows:
  The commissioner shall distribute special vehicle identification park-

 the  state.  Notwithstanding any local law or ordinance to the contrary,
 such permits shall entitle any vehicle displaying such permit to park in
 any area in any city, town or village of the state which has been desig-
 nated by such city, town or village or pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 section  twelve  hundred  three-c of this article as a place for parking

 indelibly inscribe or otherwise mark, on the face of  such  permit,  the
 last  three  digits of the identification number of the driver's license
 or non-driver identification card of the person to whom  the  permit  is

 license or identification card available to an issuing agent at the time
 of  permit issuance or renewal by presenting such license or identifica-
 tion  card to such issuing agent. Any person issued a permit pursuant to
 this section who holds a driver's license or  non-driver  identification
 card  shall  carry  and make available to a law enforcement officer upon
 demand, or as soon  as  practicable  thereafter,  his  or  her  driver's
 license  or  non-driver  identification  card which shall be presumptive
 evidence of the validity of his or her  special  vehicle  identification
 parking  permit. Failure to make available such driver's license or non-
 driver identification card upon demand shall not be deemed a  violation.
 The permits shall be issued to:
