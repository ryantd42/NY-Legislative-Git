 AN  ACT  to  amend the state finance law and the tax law, in relation to
  establishing and funding the close the waitlist fund

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The Older Americans Act was signed into
 law  by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 as part of "The Great Socie-
 ty". The primary purpose of the Older Americans Act was to  support  the
 local  provision  of  quality  services to seniors, including home care,
 meals,  preventative  medical  services,  transportation  and  caregiver
 assistance.  The  basic  structure  of  the  Older Americans Act and its
 implementation at the state,  city  and  municipal  level  has  remained
 largely  unchanged  for six decades, despite the composition, preponder-
 ance and needs of Older New Yorkers changing in dynamic fashion. Signif-
 icant changes are warranted as the senior population in our state is the
 fastest growing of all segments; in particular those age  80  and  above
 are  growing at the swiftest rate of all subgroups. Efforts are underway
 in the United States congress to modernize the Older Americans  Act  and
 provide additional funding to meet historical demand. New York State has
 undertaken  a  State  Master Plan On Aging Process in recognition of the
 fact that the system needs to change to  ensure  that  our  seniors  are
 empowered, supported and put in a position to thrive. However, irrespec-
 tive  of  all  these grand designs, there are still tens of thousands of
 individuals who, for decades, have been waitlisted for  senior  services
 and  thousands  more  who when they hear they will be put on a waitlist,
 decline to be added for fear they will die before services are rendered.
 The purpose of this bill is to close the waitlist forever, by  providing
 necessary,  modest  funding  from specific sources. This investment will
 actually save money as senior services allow people to stay at home, age
 in place, avoid institutionalization and/or spending down to Medicare.
  § 2. The state finance law is amended by adding a new section 99-rr to
 read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
