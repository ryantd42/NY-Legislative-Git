 SUBJECT  TO  THIS  CODE, AN OWNER SHALL FURNISH TO EACH TENANT SIGNING A
 VACANCY LEASE, A NOTICE IN A FORM PROMULGATED OR APPROVED BY  THE  STATE
 DIVISION  OF  HOUSING  AND  COMMUNITY  RENEWAL  THAT SETS FORTH THE RENT

 THE  VACANCY,  IF  ANY, AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE RENTAL AMOUNT PROVIDED
 FOR IN THE VACANCY LEASE HAS BEEN COMPUTED ABOVE THE AMOUNT SHOWN IN THE
 MOST RECENT ANNUAL REGISTRATION STATEMENT,  AND  A  STATEMENT  THAT  ANY
 INCREASE ABOVE THE AMOUNT SET FORTH IN SUCH REGISTRATION STATEMENT IS IN
 ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE ADJUSTMENTS PERMITTED BY THE RENT GUIDELINES BOARD

  B. UPON COMPLAINT BY THE TENANT THAT HE OR SHE WAS NOT FURNISHED  WITH
 A COPY OF THE NOTICE REQUIRED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION A OF THIS SECTION,
