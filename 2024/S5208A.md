  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other  law  to  the  contrary,  Richard
 Stueber,  a  deputy  sheriff employed by Suffolk County who retired from
 such service on March 1, 2019, and who participated in the  World  Trade
 Center  rescue,  recovery  and cleanup operations as a member of the New
 York City police department, shall be entitled to a 75% accidental disa-
 bility retirement  benefit pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision  d  of
 section  605  of  the  retirement and social security law based upon the
 determination by the New York  state  and  local  employees'  retirement
 system  on March 12, 2020 that Richard Stueber was permanently incapaci-
 tated  for the performance of his duties as  a  result  of  his  partic-
 ipation  in  the  World  Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup oper-
 ations. Such benefit shall be payable from the date of his retirement.
  § 2. All costs associated with implementing this act shall be borne by
 the state of New York.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow Richard Stueber, a service retiree  of  the  New
 York  State and Local Employees' Retirement System who previously worked
 for Suffolk County, to be entitled to an accidental  disability  retire-
 ment  benefit  equal to 75% of final average salary, payable pursuant to
 §605(d)(4) of the Retirement and Social Security Law,  as  a  result  of
 their participation in the World Trade Center (WTC) rescue, recovery and
 cleanup  operations.  The  retirement  benefit would be recalculated and
 payment would be made retroactive to the date of retirement.
