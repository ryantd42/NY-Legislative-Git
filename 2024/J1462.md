  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 21-27, 2024, as Data  Privacy  Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January  21-27,  2024,  as
Data  Privacy  Week  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Data Privacy Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  purpose  of  Data  Privacy  Week  is  to  encourage
individuals to make informed decisions about the information they choose
to  share  and  to  be  mindful  of  the applications they use and their
privacy settings; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is also important for companies to  respect  privacy  by
fulfilling  their obligation to their users of protecting their personal
data, evaluating their data collection and storage practices  and  being
transparent  with  users  about  how their data is collected, stored and
used; and
 
  WHEREAS, Data Privacy Day began in the United States in  January  of
2008,  and commemorates the January 28, 1981, signing of Convention 108,
the first legally binding international treaty dealing with privacy  and
data protection; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  Data  Privacy  Day  is  observed for a week in the
United States, Canada, Israel and 47 European countries; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National  Cyber  Security  Alliance  (NCSA)  officially
leads  the  Data Privacy Week campaign and is advised by a distinguished
advisory committee of privacy professionals to help the  campaign  align
with the most current privacy issues in a thoughtful and meaningful way;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Data  Privacy  Week's  educational  initiative  originally
focused on raising awareness among businesses as well as users about the
importance of protecting  the  privacy  of  their  personal  information
online, particularly in the context of social networking; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The educational focus has expanded over the past six years
to include families, consumers and businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to its  educational  initiative,  Data  Privacy
Week  promotes  events  and activities that stimulate the development of
technology  tools  that  promote  individual  control  over  personally
identifiable  information;  encourages  compliance with privacy laws and
regulations; and  creates  dialogue  among  stakeholders  interested  in
advancing data protection and privacy; and
 
 
  WHEREAS, Many examples abound of the perils of poor data management;
lives  and  livelihoods  can  be  destroyed by theft of identity, credit
information, and the like, including the denial of a loan or new  credit
card,  removal  from one's hard-earned state of financial stability, and
the mental duress of loss of privacy  and  security  of  one's  personal
information and data; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  threat  of  data breaches and data theft continues to
loom large and continues  to  grow  and  plague  more  New  Yorkers  and
Americans each day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  more commerce, communication, and other aspects of the
daily lives of New Yorkers occur digitally, it is  more  important  than
ever  to  be  educated on the safe practices of data privacy and safety,
and to take steps whenever possible to increase data security; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be  greater  awareness  of  the
importance  of  data privacy, and more must be done to increase activity
at the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim January 21-27, 2024, as
Data Privacy Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
