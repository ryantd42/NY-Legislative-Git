 Introduced by Sens. RIVERA, MYRIE -- read twice and ordered printed, and
  when printed to be committed to the Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to setting reimburse-
  ment rates for essential safety net hospitals
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. Essential safety net hospitals predomi-
 nately serve historically marginalized neighborhoods and communities  of
 color,  with  Medicaid  and  uninsured patients comprising 36 percent or
 more of their patient population. Years of disinvestment and the current
 financing system impedes the ability  of  these  facilities  to  provide
 equitable  care  in  the  communities they serve. The perpetual cycle of
 underfunding of these hospitals prevents critical investment in services
 and requires annual supplemental state support to simply remain open  to
 provide care. The legislature seeks to implement a permanent solution to
 address decades-long inequities faced by communities served by essential
 safety  net  hospitals.  It  is the intent of the legislature to provide
 enhanced rates to essential safety net hospitals to support  investments
 to  stabilize the safety net workforce, allow for investment in critical
 hospital infrastructure, and provide expanded and equitable programs and
 services to  underserved  communities.  This  legislation  will  promote
 access  to  care  by ensuring that essential safety net hospitals in New
 York's most marginalized communities remain open and  are  better  posi-
 tioned  to successfully meet community needs. It is recognized that this
 legislation may require eligible hospitals to waive the receipt of Medi-
 caid Disproportionate  Share  Hospital  allotments  as  a  condition  of
 receiving  enhanced reimbursement rates as a result of this legislation.
 It is further recognized that an eligible essential safety net  hospital
 may  decline  to  participate  in the reimbursement structure created by
 this legislation.
