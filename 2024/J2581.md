  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to pay tribute  to
those  exemplary  athletes  and organizations that excel in professional
athletics, distinguishing themselves through  notable  achievements  and
representing the great Empire State with pride and determination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its

congratulate  the  Buffalo  Bandits  Lacrosse  Team upon the occasion of
capturing the National Lacrosse League Championship; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Bandits clinched the title after defeating  the  Albany

best-of-three series; and
 
  WHEREAS, The series concluded with a 15-13 victory on Saturday,  May
18,  2024 during which the Bandits never trailed, drawing the praise and
applause of a sellout crowd of 19,070 excited fans at KeyBank Center  in
Buffalo, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The championship is the sixth in Bandits franchise history,
earning  the  team  the  distinction  of  back-to-back champions for the
second  time  in  the  team's  storied  history,  having  previously
accomplished the feat in 1992 and 1993; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Proudly donning the team's colors of orange, black, white,
and purple, family members, friends, and the community at large  loyally
and  enthusiastically  supported  the  Bandits throughout their journey,
helping the team average nearly 17,000 fans per game at  KeyBank  Center
during the regular season; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  athletic  talent  displayed  by  the  Buffalo Bandits
Lacrosse Team is due in great part to the  efforts  of  General  Manager
Steve  Dietrich, Head Coach John Tavares, and the entire coaching staff,
skilled and inspirational tutors respected for their ability to  develop
potential into excellence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  hallmarks  of the Buffalo Bandits Lacrosse Team, from
the opening game of the season to their outstanding win in the  National
Lacrosse  League  Championship  game,  were  a  brotherhood  of athletic
ability, of good sportsmanship, and of honor, demonstrating  that  these
team players are second to none; and
 
  WHEREAS, Athletic competitions instill the values of teamwork, pride
and  accomplishment;  Head  Coach  John  Tavares and the Buffalo Bandits
Lacrosse Team's outstanding athletes have clearly made a contribution to
the spirit of excellence which is a  tradition  of  their  organization;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate the Buffalo Bandits Lacrosse  Team  upon  the  occasion  of
capturing the National Lacrosse League Championship on May 18, 2024; and
