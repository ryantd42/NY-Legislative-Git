  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November  2024,  as  Hospice  and  Palliative  Care
  Awareness Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State places the highest priority on the health
and well-being of all its citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, Honoring patient  preferences  is  a  critical  element  in
providing quality end-of-life care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  November  2024,  as  Hospice  and
Palliative Care Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction
with  the  observance  of National Hospice and Palliative Care Awareness
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than 40  years,  hospice  has  given  comfort  and
provided  dignity  to  millions  of people, allowing them to spend their
final days and months at home, surrounded by  the  people  important  to
them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  hospice  model is built on an interdisciplinary, team
approach to  treatment  and  support,  including  expert  medical  care,
quality  symptom  control,  and  comprehensive  pain  management  as  a
foundation of care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Beyond providing clinical treatment, hospice attends to the
patient's emotional, spiritual and social needs, caregiver training, and
bereavement support; and
 
  WHEREAS, As hospice organizations are some of the best providers  of
community-based  palliative  care  helping  to  improve  the  quality of
end-of-life life through pain and symptom control  and  other  services;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  an  increasingly  fragmented  and  broken  health care
system, hospice is one of the few sectors that demonstrates  how  health
care can and should work at its best for the people it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  1.72  million  Medicare  beneficiaries  and their families
throughout the United States living with life-limiting illness, received
care through hospice programs in the year 2020 alone; and
 
  WHEREAS, As changes in patient diagnoses call for innovation in  how
hospices provide care to those in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hospice and palliative care organizations are advocates and
educators about advance care planning that help individuals and families
make decisions about the care they want; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  the  criteria  to  be  enrolled  in  hospice and
palliative care differs, both services  manage  symptoms  to  help  keep
 
loved one comfortable, and services can be provided at any time during a
serious illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sharing  a  holistic  and  integrative approach to care by
treating the whole person - physically,  emotionally,  spiritually,  and
socially,  both hospice and palliative care focus on relieving symptoms,
pain and stress, for the patient, their  caregivers  and  their  family;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as  Hospice
and  Palliative Care Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
