 WITHIN  A TWENTY-FOUR HOUR PERIOD, THE COMMISSION SHALL REQUIRE AN ELEC-
 TRIC CORPORATION THAT DISTRIBUTES ELECTRICITY IN A CITY OF  ONE  MILLION

 LISHMENTS  OR  RESIDENCES;  AND  (2) PROVIDE APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION TO
 THOSE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE LOST BUSINESS AS  A  RESULT  OF  THE

 OF SERVICE FOR A PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS OR SUCH LONGER  PERIOD  AS  THE
 COMMISSION  MAY  PRESCRIBE;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, THAT THE COMMISSION MAY
 PRESCRIBE A SCHEDULE SETTING FORTH BOTH MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM AMOUNTS THAT
 A CUSTOMER MAY RECEIVE IN REFUNDS OR REDUCTIONS. IN ADDITION,  IN  EVERY
 INSTANCE  WHERE SERVICE IS INTERRUPTED FOR A PERIOD OF FORTY-EIGHT HOURS
 OR SUCH LESSER PERIOD AS THE COMMISSION MAY  DETERMINE,  THE  COMMISSION
 SHALL REQUIRE A STEAM CORPORATION THAT PROVIDES SERVICE IN A CITY OF ONE
 MILLION OR MORE TO REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS FOR DAMAGES TO OR LOSSES OF PROP-
 ERTY AND TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION TO THOSE COMMERCIAL CUSTOM-

 MENT  AND  COMPENSATION  AVAILABLE  TO  A  CUSTOMER;  PROVIDED THAT SUCH
 AMOUNTS SHALL NOT BE LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR LOSSES OF  PROP-
