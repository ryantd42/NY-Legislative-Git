  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 9-103 of the general obligations law, as amended by
 chapter  408  of the laws of 1979, paragraph a of subdivision 1 as sepa-
 rately amended by chapters 141 and 286 of the laws of 1984 and paragraph

 amended to read as follows:
  § 9-103. No  duty to keep premises safe for certain uses; responsibil-
 ity for acts of such users. 1.  THE LEGISLATURE REAFFIRMS THE PURPOSE OF
 THIS SECTION WHICH IS TO ENCOURAGE PROPERTY  OWNERS  TO  MAKE  LAND  AND
 WATER  AREAS  AVAILABLE  TO  THE PUBLIC FOR RECREATIONAL OR CONSERVATION
 PURPOSES BY LIMITING THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE  TOWARD  PERSONS
 ENTERING  THEREON  FOR SUCH PURPOSES. ITS PROVISIONS SHOULD BE CONSTRUED
 TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE OBJECTIVES.
  1-A. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN THIS SECTION:
  A. "LANDS USED IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION" MEANS LAND  AS  DEFINED  IN
 SUBDIVISION  FOUR  OF  SECTION  THREE HUNDRED ONE OF THE AGRICULTURE AND
 MARKETS LAW, EXCEPT THAT THE PARCEL OF LAND MAY BE LESS THAN  TEN  ACRES

 EXCLUSIVE OR NON-EXCLUSIVE USE OR POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES,  INCLUDING
 HOLDERS OF CONSERVATION AND TRAIL EASEMENTS.

 OCCURRING STATE, WITHOUT STRUCTURES,  IMPROVEMENTS  OR  MANMADE  OBJECTS

 DEVELOPED  AREAS, THE OWNER, LESSEE OR OCCUPANT OWES NO DUTY TO KEEP THE
 UNDEVELOPED PORTION OF THE PREMISES SAFE FOR ENTRY OR USE BY OTHERS  FOR
 RECREATIONAL PURPOSES, BUT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION AFFECTS OR ALTERS THE
 LIABILITY OF SUCH OWNER, LESSEE OR OCCUPANT TO OTHERS WHO ENTER UPON THE
 DEVELOPED  PORTION  OF  THE  PREMISES.  UNDEVELOPED  LAND  MAY INCLUDE A
 CLEARED PATH IF IT IS NOT PAVED AND THE  PATH  SHALL  NOT  CEASE  TO  BE
 "UNDEVELOPED"  BECAUSE ITS CREATION OR MAINTENANCE REQUIRES MINOR ALTER-
 ATION OF LANDSCAPE. LAND DOES NOT CEASE TO BE "UNDEVELOPED" IF THE  ONLY
 MANMADE  ALTERATION  IS THE PLANTING AND MAINTENANCE OF FLORA, INCLUDING
 TREES, SHRUBS, FLOWERS, OR GRASS.

 of any hazardous condition or use of or structure or  activity  on  such
 premises to persons entering for such purposes;
  b.  an  owner,  lessee or occupant of premises who gives permission to
 another to pursue any such activities upon such premises does not there-
 by (1) extend any assurance that the premises are safe for such purpose,
 or (2) constitute the person to whom permission is granted an invitee to
 whom a duty of care is owed, or (3) assume responsibility for  or  incur
 liability  for  any  injury  to  person or property caused by any act of
 persons to whom the permission is granted.
  c. an owner, lessee or occupant of a farm, as defined in  section  six
 hundred  seventy-one of the labor law, whether or not posted as provided

 remains in or upon such farm without consent or privilege,  or  to  give
 warning of any hazardous condition or use of or structure or activity on
 such  farm to persons so entering or remaining. This shall not be inter-
 preted, or construed, as a limit on liability for acts of  gross  negli-
 gence  in  addition to those other acts referred to in subdivision [two]
 THREE of this section.
  [2.] 3. This section does not limit the liability which  would  other-
 wise exist:
  a.  for  willful  or malicious failure to guard, or to warn against, a
 dangerous condition, use, structure or activity; or
  b. for injury suffered in any case where permission to pursue  any  of
 the  activities  enumerated  in this section was granted for a consider-
 ation other than the consideration, if any, paid to  said  landowner  by
 the state or federal government, or permission to train dogs was granted
 for  a  consideration other than that provided for in section 11-0925 of
 the environmental conservation law; or
  c. for injury caused, by acts of persons to whom permission to  pursue
 any  of  the activities enumerated in this section was granted, to other
 persons as to whom the person granting permission, or the owner,  lessee
 or occupant of the premises, owed a duty to keep the premises safe or to
 warn of danger.
 S. 5931  3
 
  [3.]  4.  Nothing  in this section creates a duty of care or ground of
 liability for injury to person or property.
  5.  NO CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL ARISE AGAINST THE OWNER, TENANT OR LESSEE
 OF LAND OR PREMISES FOR INJURIES TO ANY PERSON, OTHER THAN  AN  EMPLOYEE
 OR  CONTRACTOR  OF  THE  OWNER,  TENANT OR LESSEE, WHO IS ON THE LAND OR
 PREMISES FOR THE PURPOSE OF PICKING AND PURCHASING AGRICULTURAL OR  FARM
