York, on Monday, May 20, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Village of Sleepy Hollow's name  is  Dutch  in  origin,

group  of  concerned  citizens, and their commitment is still sustained,

farther than 1874 with The Old Dutch Church, built by Frederick Philipse

still holding worship services; this national landmark  is  the  setting
for  Washington Irving's short story, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", and
General George Washington and his Continental Army rested at the  church
on  July  2,  1781, on their way to meet the French Army in Dobbs Ferry;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Through preserving the  natural  beauty  of  the  area  the
residents  have  created  a  charming  atmosphere and contributed to the
captivating history which has made Sleepy Hollow a popular  destination;

Sleepy Hollow  Cemetery,  Sleepy  Hollow  Lighthouse,  and  Kykuit,  the
Rockefeller Estate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Being  tied  to one of the oldest American horror stories,
"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," the village has a  historical  connection
to  Halloween;  an estimated 100,000 tourists visit the village annually
to celebrate the holiday and discover the area's legends of lore; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is a range of famous figures who rest in  the  Sleepy
Hollow  Cemetery,  including  Washington  Irving,  Andrew  Carnegie, and
Elizabeth Arden; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Village of Sleepy  Hollow  offers  a  wide  variety  of
outdoor  adventures  and activities, with parks, forests, rivers, lakes,
streams and trails along one of the most scenic stretches of the  Hudson
River;  it  also offers many programs for all residents from the seniors
to the youngest generations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Of historic  origin,  the  Village  of  Sleepy  Hollow  has
remained fruitful over the ebb and flow of decades of growth and change,
 
and will continue to adapt for the challenges of the future while always
remembering the history and tradition that has led its community to such
an exceptional milestone; and

State a charming and welcoming community, its population growing to more
than 12,000 residents who are grateful to call it home; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of  the  Village  of  Sleepy  Hollow's  rich
history  and  enduring  contribution  to  the  State  of  New York, this
