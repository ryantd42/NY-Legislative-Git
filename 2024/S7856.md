  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The election law is amended by adding a new  section  3-109
 to read as follows:
  §  3-109. DISRUPTION; ADDITIONAL TIME FOR VOTING; PUBLICITY OF REMEDY.
 1. (A) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION TWO OF  THIS  SECTION,  IN  THE
 EVENT  THAT  EARLY  VOTING OR ELECTION DAY VOTING AT ONE OR MORE POLLING
 PLACES, OR FOR ONE OR MORE ELECTION DISTRICTS, IS DELAYED  OR  DISRUPTED
 PRIOR  TO  THE  CLOSE  OF  POLLS  ON  ANY DAY OF ELECTION FOR A DURATION
 EXCEEDING FIFTEEN CONSECUTIVE MINUTES,  THE  BOARD  OF  ELECTIONS  SHALL
 TOLL,  ADJUST, AND EXTEND THE SCHEDULED TIMEFRAME FOR VOTING ON THAT DAY
 OF ELECTION TO ACCOUNT FOR AND COMPENSATE THE LOST TIME  FOR  VOTING  AT
 ALL SUCH IMPACTED POLLING PLACES OR ELECTION DISTRICTS.
  (B)  PURSUANT  TO PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, IN THE EVENT THAT
 EARLY VOTING OR ELECTION DAY VOTING AT ONE OR MORE  POLLING  PLACES,  OR
 FOR ONE OR MORE ELECTION DISTRICTS, IS DELAYED OR DISRUPTED, SUCH SCHED-
 ULED  TIMEFRAME  FOR  VOTING  SHALL BE TOLLED, BEGINNING FROM THE ACTUAL
 TIME OF COMMENCEMENT OF THE DELAY OR DISRUPTION TO VOTING, OR,  IF  SUCH
 ACTUAL  TIME  CANNOT BE REASONABLY DETERMINED BY THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS,
 BEGINNING AT THE LATEST  FROM  THE  TIME  A  REPORT  OF  SUCH  DELAY  OR
 DISRUPTION  IS FIRST ELECTRONICALLY TRANSMITTED OR TELEPHONICALLY COMMU-
 NICATED TO THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS. SUCH  TOLLING  SHALL  CONTINUE  UNTIL
 SUCH  TIME  AS  THE  DELAY  OR  DISRUPTION  TO  VOTING HAS ENDED AND THE
 IMPACTED ELECTION DISTRICTS AND POLLING PLACES HAVE REOPENED FOR VOTING,
 OR THE TIME FOR THE SCHEDULED CLOSE OF POLLS ON THAT  DAY  OF  ELECTION,
 WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST. THE SCHEDULED TIMEFRAME FOR VOTING SHALL THEN BE
 ADJUSTED,  PROPORTIONATELY,  FOR  EACH  SUCH  POLLING  PLACE OR ELECTION
 DISTRICT, AND EXTENDED ON THAT DAY OF ELECTION,  OR,  IF  EXTENDING  THE
 TIMEFRAME  FOR  VOTING  AT  SUCH ELECTION DISTRICTS OR POLLING PLACES ON
 THAT DAY OF ELECTION, OR IN THAT  LOCATION,  WOULD  BE  ADMINISTRATIVELY

 IMPRACTICABLE, SUCH ADDITIONAL TIME FOR VOTING SHALL BE SCHEDULED ON THE
 NEXT  DAY  FOR  VOTING  OR A SUCCESSIVE DAY FOR VOTING SCHEDULED FOR THE
 SAME ELECTION, BUT NOT LATER THAN ELECTION  DAY,  IN  THE  SAME  POLLING
 PLACE OR, IF SUCH POLLING PLACE IS UNAVAILABLE, AT ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS
 THAT  MAY  BE DESIGNATED AS POLLING PLACES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
 SECTION 4-104 OF THIS CHAPTER AND IS,  TO  THE  EXTENT  PRACTICABLE,  IN
 CLOSE  PROXIMITY  TO THE DELAYED OR DISRUPTED POLLING PLACES OR ELECTION
 DISTRICTS, TO ACCOUNT FOR AND COMPENSATE  THE  LOST  TIME  AT  ALL  SUCH
 IMPACTED POLLING PLACES OR ELECTION DISTRICTS.
  (C)  IN  ANY  ELECTION  DISTRICT  OR  POLLING  PLACE IN WHICH A VOTING
 MACHINE OR VOTING SYSTEM WAS USED PRIOR TO A DELAY OR  DISRUPTION,  SUCH
 MACHINE  OR  SYSTEM  SHALL  BE  USED  FOR THE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR VOTING

 MAY DETERMINE THAT THE REMEDY OF ADDITIONAL TIME FOR VOTING  TO  ACCOUNT

 RIALIZE  IN  WRITING  THE  RESULTS  OF  ANY SUCH VOTE AND THE PARTICULAR
 CONSIDERATIONS RELIED UPON BY THE  BOARD  OF  ELECTIONS  IN  REACHING  A
 DETERMINATION  THAT  A  PROPORTIONATE  EXTENSION  OF TIME TO ACCOUNT AND
 COMPENSATE FOR THE LOST TIME AT SUCH IMPACTED POLLING PLACES OR ELECTION
 DISTRICTS WOULD CONSTITUTE INAPPROPRIATE OR UNNECESSARY RELIEF.
  (B) IN THE EVENT THAT THE BOARD OF  ELECTIONS REACHES  SUCH  DETERMI-
 NATION,  SUCH  BOARD  SHALL  ELECTRONICALLY OR TELEPHONICALLY INFORM THE
 BIPARTISAN CO-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF THE STATE BOARD  OF  ELECTIONS  AND
 THE CIVIL RIGHTS BUREAU OF  THE  OFFICE OF  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REGARD-

 ELECTIONS IN REACHING A DETERMINATION THAT A  PROPORTIONATE  EXTENSION
 OF  TIME  TO  ACCOUNT  AND COMPENSATE FOR THE LOST TIME AT SUCH IMPACTED
 POLLING PLACES OR ELECTION DISTRICTS WOULD CONSTITUTE INAPPROPRIATE  OR
 UNNECESSARY  RELIEF,  ANY  ALTERNATIVE  REMEDIAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE
 BOARD OF ELECTIONS OR OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, AND  A  DESCRIPTION
 OF ALL RELATED PUBLICITY EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERTAKEN OR TO BE UNDERTAKEN.
  3.  (A)  IN THE EVENT THAT THE SCHEDULED TIMEFRAME FOR EARLY VOTING OR
 ELECTION DAY VOTING AT ONE OR MORE POLLING PLACES, OR FOR  ONE  OR  MORE
 ELECTION  DISTRICTS,  IS  EXTENDED  PURSUANT  TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS
 SECTION, THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS SHALL, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE  STATE
 BOARD  OF  ELECTIONS,  AND  UNDER THE COORDINATION OF THE STATE BOARD OF
 ELECTIONS IF NECESSARY, MAKE USE OF ALL REASONABLE MEANS AND CHANNELS OF
 COMMUNICATIONS TO PUBLICIZE, FORTHWITH, THE REMEDIAL ACTION  TAKEN  WITH

 APPEAR TO HAVE CAUSED THE DELAY OR DISRUPTION AT ISSUE, AN ACCOUNTING OF
 THE POLLING PLACES OR ELECTION DISTRICTS  IMPACTED  AND  THE  RESPECTIVE
 DURATIONS  OF SUCH DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS, THE REMEDIAL ACTION TAKEN, AND
 A DESCRIPTION OF ALL RELATED PUBLICITY EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERTAKEN OR  TO
 BE UNDERTAKEN;
  (II)  ELECTRONICALLY OR TELEPHONICALLY INFORM ANY CANDIDATE OR COMMIT-
 TEE WITH CANDIDATES OR QUESTIONS APPEARING ON A BALLOT TO BE VOTED  UPON
 IN  ANY  SUCH POLLING PLACE OR ELECTION DISTRICT IMPACTED, OR THE DESIG-
 NATED AGENT OF SUCH CANDIDATE OR COMMITTEE OF THE REMEDIAL ACTION TAKEN,
 AND INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF ALL  RELATED  PUBLICITY  EFFORTS  ALREADY
 UNDERTAKEN OR TO BE UNDERTAKEN;
  (III)  ELECTRONICALLY  OR TELEPHONICALLY INFORM LOCAL PRINT AND BROAD-
 CAST NEWS MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL NON-PARTISAN CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS

 REMAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE.

 SHALL DIRECT ATTENTION TO ANY CHANGE OF THE LOCATION OF IMPACTED POLLING
 PLACES OR ELECTION DISTRICTS, IF  APPLICABLE,  AND  SHALL  CONTAIN  SUCH
 OTHER  INFORMATION  AS  THE  BOARD OF ELECTIONS SHALL DEEM NECESSARY AND

 BE SEGREGATED FROM OTHER BALLOTS CAST BY ELIGIBLE VOTERS OR  SUBJECT  TO
 CHALLENGE  OR  JUDICIAL  REVIEW ON THE BASIS THAT SUCH BALLOTS WERE CAST
 OUT OF TIME; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL  NOT  PREJU-
 DICE  THE  RIGHT  OF  ANY  REGISTERED  VOTER  ELIGIBLE TO VOTE AT SUCH A
 DELAYED OR DISRUPTED POLLING PLACE OR ELECTION DISTRICT, OR  ANY  CANDI-
 DATE  OR COMMITTEE WITH CANDIDATES OR QUESTIONS APPEARING ON A BALLOT TO
