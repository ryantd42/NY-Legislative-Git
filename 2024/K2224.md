BY: M. of A. Reyes
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  2nd  Anniversary  of  Latina
  History Day in the State of New  York  on  June  12,
  2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those individuals and organizations of high  purpose  and
worthy accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare
of the citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  2nd  Anniversary of Latina History Day in the State of
New York on Wednesday, June 12, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State is home to nearly four million Latinos,  and
Latinas  have  increasingly become a driving force behind the community;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Latinas have roots in various cultures and regions  of  the
world,  including  South  America,  Central  America, the Caribbean, and
across the globe; and
 
  WHEREAS, Latina History Day, led and promoted by Hispanas  Organized
for  Political  Equality  (HOPE), presents an opportunity to commemorate
the historic and current achievements of  Latinas  while  embracing  the
rich diversity of the Latina experience; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  New  York  State, Latinas are of all ages and walks of
life,  including  students,  teachers,  labor  leaders,  entrepreneurs,
community  leaders,  and  elected officials; we take this opportunity to
honor the contributions that Latina  women  have  made  to  our  State's
history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Employment and wage discrimination, healthcare disparities,
and inequities in the education system are still experienced by Latinas,
prompting  them  to  advocate  for  a  world with political and economic
parity through leadership and education; and
 
  WHEREAS, Latinas are increasingly becoming more politically engaged,
contributing to rising rates in voter turnout, and some are  elected  to
public office and appointed to powerful positions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Latinas  in New York State emulate legends such as Supreme
Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Representative Nydia Velazquez, and  many
others who have set a precedent for others to follow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all  the  citizens  of  this  great  Empire  State;  we  justly  honor
contemporary Latinas who continue building upon the foundation of  their
predecessors  for  the betterment of future generations; now, therefore,
be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 2nd Anniversary of Latina History Day in  the  State  of
New  York  on June 12, 2024, and to honor its members, past and present,
who have labored so conscientiously to secure and improve the quality of
life for the citizens of the community; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Latina leaders in New York State.
