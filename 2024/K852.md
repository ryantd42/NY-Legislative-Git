  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2024, as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and
  Prevention Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
issues that affect the lives of our teens  and  young  adults  from  the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern, and fully in accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim February 2024, as Teen
Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month in the State of New York,
in conjunction with the observance  of  National  Teen  Dating  Violence
Awareness and Prevention Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Domestic  violence  is  a serious problem, and not just an
adult problem; teens also experience abuse in  their  relationships;  in
fact,  according  to  a report in 2006 by the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), nearly 1.5 million high school students nationwide
experience physical abuse from a dating partner every year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dating violence refers to a pattern of actual or threatened
acts of physical and/or emotional abuse  perpetrated  by  an  adolescent
against a current or former dating partner; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Abuse  may  include  insults,  coercion,  social sabotage,
threats, and/or acts of physical  abuse;  the  abusive  teen  uses  this
pattern  of  violent  and  coercive  behavior in order to gain power and
maintain control over the dating partner; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Resource Center  on  Domestic  Violence  found
that  girls and young women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the
highest rate of intimate partner violence, almost  triple  the  national
average; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nearly  1.5  million  high  school  students in the United
States are physically abused by dating partners every year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Females are more likely to be the victims;  1  in  4  women
have  been  assaulted  by  a  partner; men are also at risk: 1 in 14 men
report being victims; and
 
  WHEREAS, Regardless of sex, it is likely that abusive  relationships
are underreported due to the nature of the problem; and
 
  WHEREAS, 1 in 3 female teenagers in a dating relationship has feared
for her physical safety; and
 
  WHEREAS,  1 in 2 teenagers in a serious relationship has compromised
personal beliefs to please a partner; and
 
  WHEREAS, 1 in 5 teenagers in a serious relationship  reports  having
been hit, slapped, or pushed by a partner; and
 
  WHEREAS,  27  percent of teenagers have been in dating relationships
in which their partners called them names or put them down; and
 
  WHEREAS, Approximately 70% of college students say  they  have  been
sexually coerced; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Unfortunately, only 33% of teenagers who were in a violent
relationship ever told anyone about the abuse; and
 
  WHEREAS, Technologies such as cell phones and the Internet have made
dating abuse both more pervasive and more hidden; and
 
  WHEREAS,  30  percent  of  teenagers  who  have  been  in  a  dating
relationship  say  they  have been text-messaged between 10 and 30 times
per hour by a partner seeking to find out where they are, what they  are
doing, or who they are with; and
 
  WHEREAS,  72 percent of teenagers who reported they had been checked
up on by a boyfriend or girlfriend 10 times per hour by  email  or  text
messaging did not tell their parents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Parents are largely unaware of the cell phone and Internet
harassment experienced by teenagers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Violent  relationships  in  adolescence  can  have  serious
ramifications  for  victims,  putting  them at higher risk for substance
abuse, eating disorders, suicide, and adult revictimization; and
 
  WHEREAS, The severity of violence among  dating  partners  has  been
shown  to  be  greater  in  cases where the pattern of violence has been
established in adolescence; and
 
  WHEREAS, The establishment of Teen  Dating  Violence  Awareness  and
Prevention  Month  will  benefit  schools,  communities,  and  families
regardless of socio-economic status, race, or gender; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body recognizes the efforts of  all  those
who  raise  awareness  and educate others about the very real dangers of
teen dating violence, thereby improving the  quality  of  life  for  our
youth, our most precious resource; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  February  2024,  as  Teen
Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month in the State of New York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
