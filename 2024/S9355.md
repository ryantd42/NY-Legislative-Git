  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  real property law is amended by adding a new section
 235-j to read as follows:
  § 235-J.  STANDARD LEASE CLAUSE. 1. EVERY  WRITTEN  RESIDENTIAL  LEASE
 SHALL CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING CLAUSES:
  A.  "WARRANTY  OF HABITABILITY". THE LANDLORD PROMISES THAT THE APART-
 MENT AND BUILDING ARE FIT TO LIVE IN AND  NOT  DANGEROUS  TO  THE  LIFE,
 HEALTH  OR  SAFETY  OF  THE  OCCUPANTS. UNLESS THE APARTMENT OR BUILDING
 BECOMES UNFIT TO LIVE IN DUE TO THE MISCONDUCT  OF  THE  TENANT  OR  THE
 TENANT'S FAMILY OR GUESTS, THE LANDLORD WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF THIS
 PROMISE IS BROKEN, EVEN IF IT IS NOT THE FAULT OF SUCH LANDLORD.
  CONDITIONS  WHICH  WOULD  VIOLATE  THIS  PROMISE  INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT
 LIMITED TO: INSECT OR RODENT INFESTATION, INSUFFICIENT HEAT AND PLUMBING
 FACILITIES, SIGNIFICANTLY DANGEROUS ELECTRICAL OUTLETS  OR  WIRING,  AND
 INADEQUATE SANITATION FACILITIES.
  IF THE PROMISE IS VIOLATED, THE TENANT MAY WITHHOLD FROM RENT THE LOSS
 IN THE VALUE OF THE APARTMENT DUE TO THE VIOLATION.
  B.  "WILLFUL  VIOLATION  OF LEASE". IF THE LANDLORD OR SUCH LANDLORD'S
 EMPLOYEE OR AGENT INTENTIONALLY VIOLATES A PROVISION OF  THIS  LEASE  OR
 INTENTIONALLY INTERFERES WITH THE TENANT'S QUIET ENJOYMENT OF THE APART-
 MENT, THE LANDLORD IS GUILTY OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
  C.  "TENANT'S  ASSOCIATIONS". THE TENANT HAS THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND
 PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTIVITIES OF ANY GROUP OR  ASSOCIATION  OF  TENANTS.
 TENANT GROUPS HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO MEET IN COMMON AREAS OF THE BUILD-
 ING  AT REASONABLE HOURS AS LONG AS THESE MEETINGS DO NOT INTERFERE WITH
 THE RIGHT OF OTHERS TO ENTER, LEAVE OR MOVE ABOUT THE BUILDING.

 ING THE APARTMENT.

 JURY IN ANY ACTION FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE.
  F.  "UTILITY  PAYMENT  OFFSET".  IF  THE  LANDLORD  IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

 ANOTHER  QUALIFIED  PERSON  FOR THE TIME REMAINING UNDER THIS LEASE. BUT
 THE TENANT WILL STILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE LANDLORD IF THE OTHER PERSON
 DOES NOT PAY THE RENT OR VIOLATES THE LEASE IN ANY OTHER WAY.

 HAS THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THE LEASE.

 ATTORNEYS' FEES OR EXPENSES FROM THE TENANT FOR ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
 ARISING OUT OF THE LEASE, THE LEASE SHALL CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING CLAUSE:
  "IF  THE  TENANT  IS  SUCCESSFUL  IN  THE DEFENSE OR PROSECUTION OF AN
 ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS LEASE, THE TENANT  MAY  RECOVER
 ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES FROM THE LANDLORD."
