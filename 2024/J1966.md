  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 12-18, 2024, as Prevention Week in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the intent of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 12-18, 2024, as Prevention Week in
the State of New York, in conjunction with National Prevention Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Recognition of this annual designation helps  to  encourage
communities to raise awareness about substance use and misuse and mental
health  concerns,  foster  partnerships  and  collaborations  with
organizations dedicated to preventing substance abuse and mental  health
issues, and promote and disseminate prevention resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Prevention  Week  is a public education platform
showcasing the work of communities and organizations across the  country
that  are  preventing  substance use and misuse while promoting positive
mental health; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health  Services
Administration  (SAMHSA)  created  a  new,  ongoing  virtual  series  to
showcase, elevate, and celebrate the important prevention ideas, events,
news,  and  activities  that  impact  communities  across  the  country;
throughout  the  year,  the series will focus on spotlighting prevention
organizations and cultivating social innovation to address the needs  of
communities and the young people who reside within them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Schools  and local communities are encouraged to take part
in prevention-themed events prior to the end of the school year to  help
raise  awareness  about  the  potential harms of substance use and abuse
among students and individuals of all ages; and
 
  WHEREAS, Opioids, such  as  heroin,  prescription  painkillers,  and
illicitly  manufactured fentanyl, have become an ever-growing concern in
New York State; fentanyl  is  now  the  most  common  drug  involved  in
overdose  deaths;  in  2020,  1,580  New  Yorkers  died  from  a
fentanyl-involved overdose; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fentanyl increasingly can be found across the United States
and is often added to other  substances  or  replaces  other  substances
entirely,  commonly  without  the  knowledge of the end-user; due to its
severe potency, just three  milligrams  of  fentanyl  can  prove  fatal,
providing  a new complexity to the already multifaceted opioid epidemic;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The number of people who died from a drug overdose in  2021
was  over  six  times  the  number  in 1999; the number of drug overdose
deaths increased more than 16% from 2020 to 2021, with over 75%  of  the
 
nearly  107,000  total drug overdose deaths in 2021 involving an opioid;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Harm  reduction strategies are essential in keeping people
alive and decreasing potential harms for people who are  using  opioids;
syringe  services  programs,  overdose  prevention  and  intervention,
including naloxone and fentanyl test strip distribution, and  medication
for  opioid  use  disorder  (MOUD) help address the immediate health and
safety needs of people who use opioids; and
 
  WHEREAS, One of  the  primary  goals  of  the  SAMHSA  is  fostering
partnerships  and  collaborations  with  federal  agencies  and national
organizations dedicated to improving public health; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, the New York State Office  of  Alcoholism  and
Substance  Abuse  Services  offers  important  information,  tips,  and
resources to help parents, schools, and members of  the  community  keep
young  people  safe  from  alcohol,  drugs, and problem gambling through
initiatives such as its Talk2Prevent, Combat  Heroin,  and  Prescription
Drug Abuse campaigns and websites; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  this  observance,  this  Legislative  Body  also
recognizes substance abuse  prevention  providers  throughout  New  York
State  and  their  important  work in reducing the risks associated with
such abuse, as well as their  dedication  to  prevention  efforts  along
these lines; and
 
  WHEREAS,  All  New  Yorkers are encouraged to join in supporting the
goal to keep all citizens of this noble State and Nation healthy,  safe,
and informed; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pauses in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  12-18,  2024,  as
Prevention Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
