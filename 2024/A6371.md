 in  a  prominent  place in each guest room, including but not limited to
 the following information:
  a. location of nearest exits and fire alarms;
  b.  procedures  to  be  followed when the fire or smoke detector gives
 warning; and
  c. procedures to be followed in the event of fire  or  smoke  develop-
 ment.
  8.  Standards  for hotels, motels, PRIVATE RESIDENCES RENTED OUT FOR A

 system.  Incorporation  into the existing system shall be in lieu of the
 portable alarms. Standards shall require operators of  any  such  estab-
 lishment to post conspicuously at the main desk or other similar station

 detector alarm devices for the deaf and hard of hearing  are  available.
 The  council shall mandate by rule and regulation the specific design of
 the smoke-detector alarm devices.
