 Introduced  by  Sen.  RYAN  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Housing, Construction  and
  Community Development
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend  the private housing finance law, the tax law and the
  real property tax law, in relation to enacting the accessory  dwelling
  unit incentive act

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "accessory dwelling unit incentive act".
  §  2. The private housing finance law is amended by adding a new arti-
 cle 32 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 32
  ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAM
 
 SECTION 1290. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
  1291. DEFINITIONS.
  1292. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAM.
  § 1290. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS
 THAT ACCORDING TO A 2019 REPORT FROM THE STATE COMPTROLLER, MILLIONS  OF
 RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS IN OUR STATE STRUGGLE WITH HIGH HOUSING COSTS. AS
 OF 2017, NEARLY 2.8 MILLION NEW YORK HOUSEHOLDS FACED HOUSING COSTS THAT
 WERE  30  PERCENT OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME, A COMMONLY ACCEPTED BENCHMARK
 FOR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. ALMOST HALF OF ALL RENTERS AND MORE THAN  ONE
 IN  FOUR  HOMEOWNERS  WERE  IN  THIS  CATEGORY, ACCORDING TO U.S. CENSUS
 BUREAU DATA. BASED ON CRITERIA USED BY THE U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  HOUSING
 AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, MORE THAN 1.3 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS - INCLUDING MORE
 THAN  ONE  OF  EVERY  FOUR RENTERS - WERE "SEVERELY BURDENED" BY HOUSING
 COSTS OF HALF OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME.  HIGH  HOUSING  COSTS  MAY  FORCE
 FAMILIES  AND  INDIVIDUALS  TO REDUCE OR FOREGO OTHER NECESSITIES.  MANY
 FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT ASIDE SAVINGS FOR EMERGENCY NEEDS, COLLEGE  OR
 RETIREMENT.  SOME  MAY FACE EVICTION OR CONCLUDE THEIR ONLY CHOICE IS TO
 MOVE TO LOWER-COST LOCATIONS. SUCH OUTCOMES HAVE BROADER, HARMFUL IMPLI-
 CATIONS FOR NEW YORK'S ECONOMY.
  THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGE  RESULTS  FROM  A  COMBINATION  OF
 FACTORS. STATEWIDE, MEDIAN RENTAL COSTS ROSE BY NEARLY 13 PERCENT, AFTER
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 9090  2
 
 ADJUSTING  FOR  INFLATION, OVER THE DECADE ENDING IN 2017, COMPARED TO A
 2.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR RENTERS.
  WHILE  RENTAL  AND  HOMEOWNER  COSTS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER IN DOWNSTATE
 REGIONS, THE CHALLENGE OF  AFFORDABILITY  EXTENDS  THROUGHOUT  NEW  YORK
 STATE.  HOUSING  AFFORDABILITY  CAN BE ELUSIVE FOR NEW YORKERS IN URBAN,
 SUBURBAN AND RURAL SETTINGS ALIKE.
  THESE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES HAVE ONLY BEEN  EXACERBATED  BY
 THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WITH HOUSING COSTS INCREASING AND HOUSING AVAIL-
 ABILITY DECREASING, WHILE NEW YORKERS FACE A MYRIAD  OF  OTHER  ECONOMIC
 AND  PERSONAL CHALLENGES BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC. THE AVAILABILITY OF
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS REACHED CRISIS PROPORTIONS.
  ONE PROVEN SOLUTION TO AUGMENTING THE INVENTORY OF AFFORDABLE  HOUSING
 IS  THE  CREATION  OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS
 ARE  ATTACHED  OR  DETACHED  RESIDENTIAL  DWELLING  UNITS  THAT  PROVIDE
 COMPLETE  INDEPENDENT  LIVING FACILITIES FOR ONE OR MORE PERSONS LOCATED
 ON A LOT WITH A PROPOSED  OR  EXISTING  PRIMARY  RESIDENCE.  SUCH  UNITS
 INCLUDE  PERMANENT PROVISIONS FOR LIVING, SLEEPING, EATING, COOKING, AND
 SANITATION ON THE SAME LOT AS THE SINGLE-FAMILY OR MULTIFAMILY DWELLING.
  ONE OF THE LARGEST IMPEDIMENTS TO THE CREATION OF  ACCESSORY  DWELLING
 UNITS,  WHERE THEY ARE ALREADY LEGALLY PERMITTED, IS THE UPFRONT CAPITAL
 COST OF PERMITTING, DESIGN, AND CONSTRUCTION. IT IS THE PURPOSE OF  THIS
 ARTICLE TO CREATE A FORGIVABLE LOAN PROGRAM FOR THE CREATION OF ACCESSO-
 RY  DWELLING UNITS TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO PROPERTY OWNERS WHERE SUCH
 UNITS ARE LEGALLY PERMITTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE
 LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL NEW YORKERS.
  § 1291. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN  THIS  ARTICLE,  THE  FOLLOWING  TERMS

 PROPOSED OR EXISTING  PRIMARY  RESIDENCE  AND  SHALL  INCLUDE  PERMANENT
 PROVISIONS  FOR LIVING, SLEEPING, EATING, COOKING, AND SANITATION ON THE
 SAME LOT AS THE SINGLE-FAMILY OR MULTIFAMILY DWELLING.

 COMMUNITY RENEWAL.
