  HONORING  the  brave  members of the Bedford Hills
  Fire Department and Police Department in recognition
  of their prompt and heroic actions on May 31, 2024
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our noble first responders who exhibit courage and bravery
every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their  own  lives  in  an  effort  to  preserve the life and property of
another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the  brave  members  of  the  Bedford  Hills  Fire Department and Police
Department in recognition of their prompt and heroic actions on May  31,
2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  early  morning hours of Friday, May 31, 2024, the
Westchester County Emergency Communications Center received a  911  call
from  the  resident  of  a  Park Avenue home in Bedford Hills, New York,
reporting her house was on fire and that she and her two  children  were
trapped in the smoke and unable to escape; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Once  Bedford  patrol  units quickly arrived on the scene,
they found a 35-year-old woman  in  distress  hanging  out  of  a  small
bathroom  window;  the  woman  told  officers that her two children were
still trapped inside the home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bedford  Hills  Fire  Department's  1st  Assistant  Chief
Patierno,  along  with Bedford Police Officers Jordan Baschnagel, Ronald
Sauber, and Joseph Sagliano forced a door off the rear porch where  they
faced heavy smoke; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Despite  limited visibility, they followed the sounds of a
10-year-old child crying out from just inside the doorway in the kitchen
and were able to pull him out of the smoke-filled house; in an effort to
locate the second child, officers began breaking  windows  and  removing
air conditioner units; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Without  hesitation  and  despite  not  being  able to see
through thick smoke, these brave men followed the faint cry coming  from
an  elevated  window, climbed a small ledge, and were able to access the
window, removing the terrified 9-year-old boy; and
 
  WHEREAS, The woman and her two children were  taken  to  Westchester
County  Medical  Center by the Katonah-Bedford Hills Volunteer Ambulance
Corps where they were treated for smoke inhalation;  the  Bedford  Hills
Fire Department maintained the scene and quickly put out the fire; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition  to  acknowledging  the  Bedford  Hills  Fire
Department and Police Department, members of the  Katonah-Bedford  Hills
Volunteer  Ambulance  Corps, Westchester Emergency Medical Services, and
the  Westchester  County  Department  of  Emergency  Services  actively
assisted  in  the rescue and should be meritoriously commended for their
sacrifices and selfless dedication; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  heroic  first  responders  have  consistently
demonstrated  a  level  of  commitment,  dedication,  integrity,  and
professionalism which truly exemplifies the  finest  traditions  of  the
Bedford Hills Fire and Police Departments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that we should
give special recognition to  those  who  work  so  assiduously  for  the
betterment  of  their  communities,  and acknowledge publicly the heroic
actions performed by the  courageous  first  responders  of  this  great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor the brave members of the Bedford Hills Fire Department and  Police
Department  in recognition of their prompt and heroic actions on May 31,
2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Bedford Hills Fire Department and Police Department.
