 AN  ACT  to amend the public service law and the public authorities law,
  in relation to advancing grid enhancement technologies
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The public service law is amended by adding a new section
 66-x to read as follows:
  § 66-X. ADVANCING GRID ENHANCEMENT TECHNOLOGIES. 1. FOR  THE  PURPOSES
 OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A)  "GRID  ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY" MEANS ANY HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE TECH-
 NOLOGY THAT ENABLES ENHANCED OR  MORE  EFFICIENT  PERFORMANCE  FROM  THE
 ELECTRIC  TRANSMISSION  SYSTEM,  INCLUDING,  BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DYNAMIC
 LINE RATING, ADVANCED POWER FLOW CONTROL TECHNOLOGY, TOPOLOGY  OPTIMIZA-
 TION AND ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING.
  (B) "ADVANCED RECONDUCTORS" MEANS HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN CONDUCT
 ELECTRICITY  ACROSS TRANSMISSION LINES AND DEMONSTRATE ENHANCED PERFORM-
 ANCE OVER TRADITIONAL CONDUCTOR PRODUCTS.
  (C) "DYNAMIC LINE RATING" MEANS HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE  TECHNOLOGIES
 USED  TO  APPROPRIATELY UPDATE THE CALCULATED THERMAL LIMITS OF EXISTING
 TRANSMISSION LINES BASED ON REAL-TIME AND FORECASTED WEATHER CONDITIONS.
  (D) "ADVANCED POWER FLOW CONTROL" MEANS HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE TECH-
 NOLOGIES USED TO PUSH OR PULL ELECTRIC POWER IN A MANNER  THAT  BALANCES
 OVERLOADED  LINES  AND  UNDERUTILIZED  CORRIDORS WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION
 NETWORK.
  (E) "TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION" MEANS HARDWARE AND/OR  SOFTWARE  TECHNOLO-
 GIES  THAT  IDENTIFY  RECONFIGURATIONS  OF THE TRANSMISSION GRID AND CAN
 ENABLE THE ROUTING OF POWER FLOWS AROUND CONGESTED OR OVERLOADED  TRANS-
 MISSION ELEMENTS.
  (F)  "ELECTRIC  CORPORATION"  AND "COMBINATION ELECTRIC AND GAS CORPO-
 RATION" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS IN SECTION TWO OF THIS CHAPTER.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 7868--A  2
 
  (G) "TRANSMISSION" SHALL HAVE THE  SAME  MEANING  AS  "MAJOR  ELECTRIC
 TRANSMISSION FACILITY" AS DEFINED IN SECTION ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN OF
 THIS CHAPTER.
  2.  FOR  PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION IN WHICH AN ELECTRIC CORPO-
 RATION OR COMBINATION ELECTRIC  AND  GAS  CORPORATION  PROPOSES  CAPITAL
 IMPROVEMENTS OR ADDITIONS TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, THE DEPARTMENT MAY
 AUTHORIZE  SUCH  ELECTRIC  CORPORATIONS  OR COMBINATION ELECTRIC AND GAS
 CORPORATIONS TO CONDUCT A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE STRAT-
 EGIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE DEPLOYMENT OF  GRID  ENHANCING
 TECHNOLOGIES,  AND  ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING.  WHERE GRID ENHANCING TECH-
 NOLOGIES OR ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING,  WHETHER  IN  COMBINATION  WITH  OR
 INSTEAD OF OTHER CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, OFFER A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE STRAT-
 EGY  TO  ACHIEVE  TRANSMISSION  GOALS,  INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT LIMITED TO,
 DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE INTERCONNECTION, THE COMMISSION MAY  APPROVE
 THE DEPLOYMENT OF GRID ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES OR ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING
 AS PART OF THE OVERALL SOLUTIONS STRATEGY.
  3.  AS PART OF A PROCEEDING BEFORE THE COMMISSION IN WHICH IT PROPOSES
 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OR ADDITIONS TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM,  AN  ELEC-
 TRIC CORPORATION OR COMBINATION ELECTRIC AND GAS CORPORATION MAY PROPOSE
 A  PERFORMANCE  INCENTIVE  MECHANISM THAT PROVIDES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE
 FOR THE COST-EFFECTIVE DEPLOYMENT  OF  GRID  ENHANCING  TECHNOLOGIES  OR
 ADVANCED RECONDUCTORING.
  4.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL  PROMULGATE ANY RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS IT
 DEEMS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION.
  5. BEGINNING FIVE YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION,  AND
 EVERY  FIVE  YEARS  THEREAFTER, EACH ELECTRIC CORPORATION OR COMBINATION
 ELECTRIC AND GAS CORPORATION SHALL REPORT TO  THE  FEDERALLY  DESIGNATED
 BULK SYSTEM OPERATOR, AND THE COMMISSION ON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER FIRST ON
 THE  DEPLOYMENT OF ANY GRID ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES OR ADVANCED RECONDUC-
 TORING IN A FORMAT DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT.
  § 2. Section 1005 of the public authorities law is amended by adding a
 new subdivision 31 to read as follows:
  31. FOR ANY TRANSMISSION FACILITY THE AUTHORITY CONSTRUCTS OR UPGRADES
 IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SECTION THE AUTHORITY MAY CONDUCT A  COST-EFFEC-
 TIVENESS ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE STRATEGIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 THE  DEPLOYMENT OF GRID ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES AND ADVANCED RECONDUCTOR-
 ING. WHERE  GRID  ENHANCING  TECHNOLOGIES  OR  ADVANCED  RECONDUCTORING,
 WHETHER  IN  COMBINATION  WITH  OR INSTEAD OF OTHER CAPITAL INVESTMENTS,
 OFFER A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE  STRATEGY  TO  ACHIEVE  TRANSMISSION  GOALS,
 INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO, DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE INTERCON-
 NECTION, THE AUTHORITY, AS DEEMED FEASIBLE AND ADVISABLE BY THE TRUSTEES
 AND WITH ANY NECESSARY APPROVAL FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE  COMMISSION,  IS
 AUTHORIZED  TO  DEPLOY GRID ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES OR ADVANCED RECONDUC-
 TORING, AS PART OF THE OVERALL SOLUTIONS STRATEGY.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
