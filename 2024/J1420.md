BY: Senator PALUMBO
 
  COMMENDING  Richard  Scriven  upon the occasion of
  his designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in  emergency  situations,  nobly  risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Richard  Scriven  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  July  21,  2023,  Richard  Scriven  had  boarded  his
California-bound  flight at JFK International Airport, when suddenly his
relaxation time was postponed as he was immediately called to help a man
suffering from a heroin overdose; and
 
  WHEREAS, Trained to respond to emergency situations, Richard Scriven
was a Stony Brook University Hospital paramedic prior  to  entering  the
police  academy and being recruited by Suffolk County Police; his prompt
and brave actions after the announcement was made for medical  personnel
saved the unconscious man's life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  identifying himself and requesting medical supplies
from the plane's crew, Richard Scriven provided an  intranasal  dose  of
Narcan  to  the man, who regained consciousness about two minutes later;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Truly a caring individual, Richard  Scriven  remained  with
the  man  until  Emergency  Medical  Services  arrived  at  the scene to
transport the subject to Jamaica Hospital and then he was  finally  able
to continue his journey to the West Coast; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Justly recognized as a hero, Richard Scriven richly merits
the admiration of this  Legislative  Body  and  his  community  for  his
consummate, swift action in saving the life of this man; and
 
  WHEREAS, Moreover, Richard Scriven should be meritoriously commended
for remaining calm under pressure and for showing valor and true courage
while performing a lifesaving deed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Richard Scriven, in his spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated his character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
 
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without  thought of danger or reward when others are in need of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend  Richard  Scriven  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient  of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed upon an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Richard Scriven.
