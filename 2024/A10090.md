  Section  1.  1.  The  commissioner of transportation is authorized and

 with safer modern alternatives. Such study shall  include,  but  not  be
 limited to:
  a. The approximate location and mileage within the state where 3-cable
 guide rails are still in use;
  b.  The  estimated  cost  to  remove and replace the remaining 3-cable
 guide rails and whether such costs would be primarily borne by the state
 or the localities where such rails are in use;
  c. The estimated duration the removal would take if conducted  in  the
 most  cost-effective  manner for both the state and affected localities;
 and
  d. The estimated impact on vehicle and motorist safety by removing and
 replacing 3-cable guide rails with modern alternatives.
  § 2. In conducting such study, the commissioner of transportation  may
 consult  with any federal, state, or local office, agency, or department
 and request information from any such entity that is relevant and  mate-
 rial to the completion of such study and subsequent report.
  § 3. Within one year after the effective date of this act, the commis-
 sioner  of  transportation shall prepare and submit to the governor, the
 temporary president of the senate, the  speaker  of  the  assembly,  the
 minority leader of the senate, and the minority leader of the assembly a
 report  containing  the  study's  findings concerning the feasibility of
 removing and replacing all existing 3-cable  guide  rails  on  New  York
