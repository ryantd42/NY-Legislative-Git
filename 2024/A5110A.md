  Section  1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Eileen Saumell

 retirement systems, with a start date of August 8, 1994 until August 27,
 2004, and at that time a member of the United  Jewish  Appeal-Federation

  This bill would allow Eileen Saumell, an active member of the New York
 State Teachers' Retirement System with Tier 4 status, to receive service
 credit for the period August 8, 1994 until August 27, 2004 while she was
 employed with the Nassau County Demonstration Project, a non-participat-
 ing employer of the New York State public retirement systems. During Ms.
 Saumell's  employment with the  Nassau County Demonstration Project, she
 was a member of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation  of  Jewish  Philan-
 thropies of New York, Inc. Retirement Plan and could not become a member
 of  one  of  the New York State public retirement systems. Contributions
 made to the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies  of
 New  York,  Inc. Retirement Plan by Ms. Saumell shall not be returned or
 refunded to her pursuant to this bill. Ms. Saumell must file  a  written
 request  with the head of the New York State Teachers' Retirement System
 within  one year of the effective date of this bill.
  The cost of this benefit is equal to the increase in the present value
 of liabilities, which is estimated to be $432,000. This  cost  would  be
 borne  by  the  county of Nassau. Granting service credit for employment
 with an organization that may potentially be considered a non-governmen-
 tal or private employer could jeopardize the System's governmental  plan
 status  and  its  exemption from ERISA which could result in the loss of
 tax-qualified status.
