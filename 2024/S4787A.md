  (C) The committee shall consider any matter regarding material changes
 in  the  coverage  status  of  a  particular  item, health technology or
 service, and any matter relative to new health technology assessment  or

 body  of  evidence exists to warrant committee deliberation. The commis-
 sioner shall provide members of  the  committee  with  any  evidence  or
 information  related to the health technology or medical service assess-
 ment including but not limited to, information submitted by  members  of

 five days public notice on the department's website prior to any meeting
 of the committee to develop recommendations concerning health technology
 or  medical service coverage determinations. Such notice shall include a

 the conditions or diseases impacted by the health technology or service,
 the proposals to be considered by  the  committee,  and  the  systematic
 evidence-based  assessment prepared in accordance with this subdivision.
 The committee shall allow interested parties a reasonable opportunity to
 make an oral presentation to the committee related to the  health  tech-
 nology or service to be reviewed and to submit written information.  The
 committee  shall  consider  any  information  provided by any interested
 party, including, but not limited to, health care providers, health care
 facilities, patients, consumers and manufacturers. For all health  tech-
 nologies  or  services selected for review, the department shall conduct
 or commission a systematic evidence-based assessment of the health tech-
 nology's or service's safety and clinical efficacy. The assessment shall
 use established systematic review elements,  study  quality  assessment,
 and  data  synthesis.  Upon  completion,  the systematic, evidence-based
 assessment shall be made available to the public.
  (D) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL MAKE A  DETERMINATION  OF  COVERAGE  WITHIN
 SIXTY DAYS OF THE ISSUANCE OF RECOMMENDATION BY THE COMMITTEE.
  (E) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW OR REGULATION, IN THE EVENT A DETER-
 MINATION  OF  COVERAGE  STATUS IS NOT MADE UNDER THIS SECTION WITHIN ONE
