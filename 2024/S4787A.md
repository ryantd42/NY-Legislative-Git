 (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION. SUCH REPORT SHALL PROVIDE THE DATE OF  APPLICA-
 TION,  DATE  OF  REVIEW,  AND  A  STATED DETERMINATION OF SUFFICIENCY OF
 EVIDENCE WARRANTING COMMITTEE DELIBERATION AND  RECOMMENDATION.  IN  THE
 EVENT  OF  AN  AFFIRMATIVE DETERMINATION OF SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE, THE
 COMMISSIONER SHALL REQUIRE THE COMMITTEE TO ISSUE A RECOMMENDATION WITH-
 IN SIX MONTHS OF SUCH DETERMINATION OF SUFFICIENCY. IN THE  EVENT  OF  A
 NEGATIVE DETERMINATION, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL DETAIL SUCH INSUFFICIENCY
 OF  EVIDENCE  AND  ALLOW  THE  APPLICANT TO CURE STATED DEFICIENCIES FOR
 REVIEW UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION.
  (C) The committee shall consider any matter regarding material changes
 in the coverage status  of  a  particular  item,  health  technology  or
 service,  and any matter relative to new health technology assessment or
 medical evidence review for which the department determines a sufficient
 body of evidence exists to warrant committee deliberation.  The  commis-
 sioner  shall  provide  members  of  the  committee with any evidence or
 information related to the health technology or medical service  assess-
 ment  including  but not limited to, information submitted by members of
 the public. The department shall report to  the  committee  programmatic
 changes  to benefits that do not rise to the level of a material change,
 as well as determinations of when sufficient medical evidence exists  to
 warrant  committee  deliberations. The commissioner shall provide forty-
 five days public notice on the department's website prior to any meeting
 of the committee to develop recommendations concerning health technology
 or medical service coverage determinations. Such notice shall include  a
 description of the proposed health technology or service to be reviewed,
 the conditions or diseases impacted by the health technology or service,
 the  proposals  to  be  considered  by the committee, and the systematic
 evidence-based assessment prepared in accordance with this  subdivision.
 The committee shall allow interested parties a reasonable opportunity to
 make  an  oral presentation to the committee related to the health tech-
 nology or service to be reviewed and to submit written information.  The
 committee shall consider any  information  provided  by  any  interested
 party, including, but not limited to, health care providers, health care
 facilities,  patients, consumers and manufacturers. For all health tech-
 nologies or services selected for review, the department  shall  conduct
 or commission a systematic evidence-based assessment of the health tech-
 nology's or service's safety and clinical efficacy. The assessment shall
 use  established  systematic  review elements, study quality assessment,
 and data synthesis.  Upon  completion,  the  systematic,  evidence-based
 assessment shall be made available to the public.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
