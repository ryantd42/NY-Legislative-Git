 AN ACT to amend the public service law and the  state  finance  law,  in
  relation to enacting the accessible electronic information act

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title.  This act shall be known and may be  cited  as
 the "accessible electronic information act".
  §  2. Legislative finding. The National Federation of the Blind estab-
 lished the NFB-NEWSLINE to increase the  ability  of  visually  impaired
 individuals  to  receive  information provided by newspapers, magazines,
 journals and other print media which are traditionally unavailable in  a
 limited  electronic  broadcast.  Since  2002,  this  vital  service  has
 provided visually impaired New Yorkers with information on job listings,
 self-help magazines, do-it-yourself guides, political magazines, several
 newspapers, TV guide listings, and other literary necessities  that  all
 sighted  New  Yorkers  have  enjoyed. This legislation provides a stable
 means to bring NEWSLINE to New York.
  § 3. The public service law is amended by adding a new section 92-j to
 read as follows:
  § 92-J. ACCESSIBLE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION; BLIND AND DISABLED PERSONS.
 1. A QUALIFIED NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITY CAPABLE OF PROVIDING  SUCH  SERVICE
 SHALL  PROVIDE AN ACCESSIBLE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SERVICE FOR ELIGIBLE

 TION  FROM  YEAR TO YEAR AND MAKE MAXIMUM USE OF FEDERAL, STATE, PRIVATE
 AND OTHER FUNDS AVAILABLE, INCLUDING OBTAINING GRANT OR IN-KIND  SUPPORT
 FROM  APPROPRIATE  PROGRAMS  AND  SECURING ACCESS TO LOW-COST INTERSTATE
 RATES FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS BY REIMBURSEMENT OR OTHERWISE.
  2. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOW-
 ING MEANINGS, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
