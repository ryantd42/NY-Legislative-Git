 AN ACT to  amend  the  education  law,  in  relation  to  payment  under
  contracts for transportation services during a declared state of emer-
  gency

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 14 of section  305  of  the  education  law  is
 amended by adding a new paragraph h to read as follows:
  H.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY LAW, RULE, OR REGULATION TO THE CONTRARY, IF A
 SCHOOL DISTRICT IS CLOSED DUE TO A PROPERLY EXECUTED  DECLARATION  OF  A
 STATE OR LOCAL EMERGENCY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE TWO-B OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW,
 SUCH  DISTRICT SHALL CONTINUE TO MAKE PAYMENTS OF BENEFITS, COMPENSATION
 AND EMOLUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF ANY CONTRACT FOR  TRANSPORTATION
 OF  SCHOOL  CHILDREN ENTERED INTO PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION THAT WERE
 IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF THE CLOSURE AS IF THE SERVICES FOR  SUCH  BENE-
 FITS,  COMPENSATION,  AND  EMOLUMENTS  HAD  BEEN PROVIDED, AND AS IF THE
 SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD REMAINED OPEN. PAYMENTS RECEIVED  PURSUANT  TO  THIS
 PARAGRAPH  BY A CONTRACTOR PROVIDING PUPIL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SHALL
 BE USED TO MEET PAYROLL AND FIXED COST OBLIGATIONS OF THE CONTRACTOR.  A
 SCHOOL  DISTRICT  SHALL  MAKE  ALL  REASONABLE  EFFORTS TO RENEGOTIATE A
 CONTRACT IN GOOD FAITH SUBJECT TO THIS PARAGRAPH AND MAY DIRECT CONTRAC-
 TORS PROVIDING PUPIL TRANSPORTATION  SERVICES  WHO  ARE  A  PARTY  TO  A
 CONTRACT  AND RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT UNDER THIS PARA-
 GRAPH, TO PROVIDE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL  DISTRICT  WHICH  MAY
 REASONABLY  BE  PROVIDED AND ARE WITHIN THE GENERAL EXPERTISE OR SERVICE
 PROVISIONS OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT.  NEGOTIATIONS  SHALL  NOT  INCLUDE
 INDIRECT  COSTS SUCH AS FUEL OR TOLLS. AS A CONDITION OF NEGOTIATIONS, A
 CONTRACTOR FOR PUPIL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SHALL REVEAL TO THE  SCHOOL
 DISTRICT  WHETHER  THE  ENTITY HAS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE PAYMENT OF
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 S. 4956  2
 
 BENEFITS, COMPENSATION, AND  EMOLUMENTS  PURSUANT  TO  THE  TERMS  OF  A
 CONTRACT  WITH A CONTRACTOR FOR PUPIL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES UNDER THIS
 PARAGRAPH FOR SERVICES WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED  HAD
 THE  SCHOOL FACILITIES REMAINED OPEN.  A CONTRACTOR SHALL DIVULGE TO ITS
 SCHOOL DISTRICT CUSTOMERS  ALL  GOVERNMENT  AND  PRIVATE  SUBSIDIES  AND
 PROGRAMS WHICH IT IS UTILIZING DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY TO MAINTAIN
 FINANCIAL  SOLVENCY  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND
 LOANS, AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR ITS LABOR FORCE. NOTHING  IN  THIS
 PARAGRAPH  SHALL  BE  CONSTRUED  TO  REQUIRE  A  SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MAKE
 PAYMENTS TO A PARTY IN MATERIAL BREACH OF A CONTRACT WITH  A  CONTRACTOR
 FOR PUPIL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES IF THE BREACH WAS NOT DUE TO A CLOSURE
 RESULTING  FROM  A  DECLARED  STATE OF EMERGENCY, DECLARED PUBLIC HEALTH
 EMERGENCY, OR A DIRECTIVE BY AN APPROPRIATE HEALTH AGENCY OR OFFICER.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of  this  act,  if  a  school
 district  continues  to  pay  a  school bus transportation contractor or
 operates its own school  bus  transportation,  such  district  shall  be
 eligible  for  reimbursement  from the department of education at a rate
 the school district would have received had the  pandemic  of  2020  not
 occurred,  had  the minimum instruction days requirement not been waived
 under executive order 202.4 or had the  commissioner  not  taken  action
 under subdivision 7 of section 3604 of the education law.
  §  3.  This  act  shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any
 contracts or collective bargaining agreements in effect  beginning  with
 the 2019-2020 academic year.
