  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 22, 2023,  as  Hypertrophic  Cardiomyopathy
  Awareness Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase public awareness of serious
health conditions that affect the lives of citizens of New  York  State;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 22, 2023, as
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Designated as the fourth Wednesday  of  February  annually,
the  observance of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day is meant to
educate the citizens of New York on this chronic disease and to advocate
for  advancing  research,  understanding,  and  care  to  those  with
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hypertrophic  Cardiomyopathy  (HCM)  is  a  chronic
cardiovascular disease, involving thickening of the heart  muscle,  that
can  lead  to  the  development  of  debilitating  symptoms  and serious
complications; if  not  diagnosed  and  treated,  HCM  can  cause  heart
failure,  atrial  fibrillation, stroke, and in rare cases sudden cardiac
death; and
 
  WHEREAS, The most common inheritable heart disease, HCM  can  affect
anyone  regardless  of  age,  gender,  or  ethnicity,  with  a  reported
prevalence ranging from one  in  200  to  one  in  500  in  the  general
population; and
 
  WHEREAS, Affecting an estimated 700,000 people in the United States,
HCM  is commonly left untreated for a long time; it is hypothesized that
of that estimation, 85% remain undiagnosed; and
 
  WHEREAS, HCM shares symptoms with other  common  cardiovascular  and
pulmonary  diseases,  such  as shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue,
palpitations, and fainting, making it difficult to distinguish HCM  from
these other diseases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  All-cause  mortality risk is three to four times higher in
patients with HCM than that of people not diagnosed with the  condition;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Knowing one's medical history and any signs and symptoms of
HCM is an important first step in receiving an accurate diagnosis of the
disease;  a  healthcare  provider must conduct a thorough screening with
cardiac health questions to help identify a risk  of  cardiac  disorders
both genetic and congenital; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  healthcare  provider  may  conduct  several  tests  to
determine a diagnosis of HCM, including  an  echocardiogram,  a  cardiac
 
MRI,  or  genetic  testing  to confirm a family history of HCM, and must
examine the heart; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Following  a diagnosis of HCM, it is critical for patients
to work with their healthcare provider to learn more about their disease
and understand  different  management  options,  including  prescription
medicines and surgical treatment options; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Association (HCMA) is the
preeminent  organization  improving  the  lives  of  those  with  HCM,
preventing  untimely  deaths  and  advancing global understanding of the
complicated heart disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Founded in 1996, HCMA is committed  to  providing  support,
education, and advocacy to those with HCM; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health  condition,  and  more  must  be  done  to  increase
activity at the local, State, and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  February  22,  2023,  as
Hypertrophic  Cardiomyopathy Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Association.
