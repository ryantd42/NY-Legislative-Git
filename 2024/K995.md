has  achieved Scouting's highest and most prestigious rank, Eagle Scout;
the Eagle Court of Honor ceremony will be held at Our  Lady  of  Sorrows
Church in White Plains, New York, on Saturday, April 6, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nicholas  Bucaj is a member of Boy Scouts of America Troop

the dedication, determination, and tireless efforts of  the  outstanding
citizens of this Nation; and

youth, tomorrow's leaders, that America will maintain her glory; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Boy Scouts of America and its members are dedicated to
the development of character and leadership in the youth of this Nation;
and

by  approximately  five  percent of all Boy Scouts, is the distinguished
rank of Eagle Scout; and
 
  WHEREAS, This outstanding student of White Plains  High  School  has
been  involved  in  Scouting  for many years, has lived up to Scouting's
ideals, and has attained all of the  necessary  achievements,  including

planned, developed, and executed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nicholas Bucaj  contributed  his  time  and  hard  work  to
complete  his  project for the Battle Hill Dog Park in the City of White

  WHEREAS,  The  project  required building and painting of the wooden
structures prior to the installation of the obstacle course on  November
