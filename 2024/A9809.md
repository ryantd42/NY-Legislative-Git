 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  ZEBROWSKI  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Transportation
 
 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in  relation  to  requiring
  police  reports  of traffic accidents to include insurance information
  for the parties to the accident
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Subdivision  1  of section 603 of the vehicle and traffic
 law, as amended by chapter 432 of the laws of 1997, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  1.  Every  police or judicial officer to whom an accident resulting in
 injury to a person shall have been reported, pursuant to  the  foregoing
 provisions  of this chapter, shall immediately investigate the facts, or
 cause the same to be investigated, and report the matter to the  commis-
 sioner  forthwith; provided, however, that the report of the accident is
 made to the police officer or judicial officer within  five  days  after
 such  accident.  Every  coroner, or other official performing like func-
 tions, shall likewise make a report to the commissioner with respect  to
 all  deaths found to have been the result of motor vehicle or motorcycle
 accidents.  Such report shall include  information  on  the  width  and
 length  of  trucks,  tractors,  trailers  and semitrailers, which are in
 excess of ninety-five inches in width or thirty-four feet in length  and
 which  are  involved in such accidents, whether such accident took place
 in a work area and whether it was being operated with an  overweight  or
 overdimension permit.  Such report shall distinctly indicate and include
 information  as  to whether the inflatable restraint system inflated and
 deployed. SUCH REPORT SHALL DISTINCTLY INDICATE AND INCLUDE  INFORMATION
 CONCERNING  THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE POLICIES OF EACH PARTY TO THE ACCI-
 DENT. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be deemed to  preclude
 a  police  officer from reporting any other accident which, in the judg-
 ment of such police officer, would be required to  be  reported  to  the
 commissioner  by  the  operator  of  a  vehicle  pursuant to section six
 hundred five of this article.
