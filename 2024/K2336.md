  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of Varflex
  Corporation of Rome, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to  honor  those
businesses  within  the  State  of New York which distinguish themselves
through outstanding professional  behavior,  corporate  innovation,  and
enduring commitment to the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary of Varflex Corporation of Rome, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Varflex pioneered braiding fiberglass electrical  insulated
sleeving  and  the use of silicone varnishes on fiberglass sleeving; the
company focuses on up-twisting and plying high-performance  fibers  like
Fiberglass,  Spectra, Kevlar, Basalt, Polyester, Nomex, Nylon, and other
fibers, and distributes  its  products  from  braiding  and  winding  to
different  coatings  domestically  and  internationally  across  various
industries; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1924, radios were beginning to be produced in the United
States; two brothers, Charles A. and R. Harry Jenny,  along  with  their
brother-in-law,  James  E. Griffin of Rome, New York, saw a need for the
United States to begin manufacturing what use to be known as  "spaghetti
tubing," which was only being produced in Germany at the time; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The original Varflex operation was set up in a small room,
adjoining an auto repair garage owned by Charles A. Jenny and  James  E.
Griffin;  for  about  15  years,  the  partners worked part-time between
Varflex and the auto repair, growing the new business slowly  but  large
enough to shift focus to the new endeavor; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1940, James E. Griffin and Charles A. Jenny assumed full
ownership  of  the  company,  and from there, the business experienced a
steady, healthy expansion; these two  dedicated  businessmen  worked  at
Varflex until their passing in 1969 and 1974, respectively; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dorothy and William Griffin kept the family business alive,
learning  the  ins  and outs of Varflex, with Dorothy Griffin serving as
President of the company until her passing in 2015, and William  Griffin
serving  as  Vice President until his passing in 2019; these two leaders
were pillars of the Rome community and leave an  enduring  legacy  which
stands  as a testament to hard work, dedication, and unwavering service;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Varflex  developed  sleeving  for  vital  usages  in  many
aircrafts  and  various electrical equipment for the United States Armed
Forces as well as for radios and radar equipment,  dynamotors,  aircraft
generators  and  electrical  apparatus  used  by the United States Navy;
since then, the  company  has  expanded  applications  beyond  just  the
military; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Electrical insulated sleeving is an essential component of
any electrical machine, motor, or appliance;  in  response  to  customer
demand within these vast market areas, Varflex has developed an array of
types of insulated sleeving that are available in a variety of sizes and
colors, and come in coils, cut lengths, or on spools; and
 
  WHEREAS, Varflex manufactures sleeving that is suitable for high and
low  temperatures,  high  and  low voltages, as well as for abrasive and
other physically demanding applications and hostile environments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Experiencing  remarkable  growth  since  the  business'
conception,  Varflex  has  grown  from  a  company  with  an  initial 12
employees to an astounding 150 employees, now  occupying  an  incredible
200,000 square foot facility; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  June 2017, Varflex achieved ISO 9001:2015 registration
by NSF-ISR; and
 
  WHEREAS, Varflex Corporation's most recent expansion includes adding
a second facility to expand their Twist & Ply operations; with  Twist  &
Ply, the company has the capability to take single-strand yarns composed
of  continuous,  multi-filament  fibers  and increase the desired design
diameter as well as tensile strength; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  meet  worldwide  demand  from  both  industrial  and
commercial  applications, Varflex markets its products through a network
of sales representatives and distributors located in the United  States,
Canada,  Mexico,  Europe,  and the Far East; Varflex maintains life-long
relationships with many of its customers by continuing  to  supply  them
with  the  highest-quality  electrical insulated sleevings, coupled with
exceptional service; and
 
  WHEREAS, In dedication to serving their community,  Varflex  commits
100%  of  their  profits,  after  normal business expense deductions, to
charities across the central New York region; to date,  the  corporation
has contributed over $3.5 million to various local organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of  Varflex  is in direct correlation to the
efforts of its dedicated leadership and staff, whose involvement is, and
always has been, characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors  on  behalf  of the businesses and the communities they serve;
and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and state economies, and its vibrant role in improving  the  quality  of
life  in  its  community,  fully confident it will continue to enjoy the
same sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of  Varflex Corporation; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Varflex Corporation, Rome, New York.
