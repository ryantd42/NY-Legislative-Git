in providing  for  the  care  and  welfare  of  the  citizens  of  their
communities and this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Within  every community of the State of New York there are
certain individuals who, by virtue of their commitment  and  dedication,
command  the  respect  and  admiration  of  their  community  for  their
exemplary contribution and service on behalf of others; and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in participating in

Florists, Metro Ford, Saratoga Eagle and RC Lacy Ford Lincoln Subaru  to
sponsor  and recognize April 28, 2023, as the 19th Annual Blue Friday in
honor of all law enforcement officers who have given their lives in  the
line of duty as well as all of those who still protect and serve; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  August 6, 2004, Albany Police Officer Pat Fox proposed

  WHEREAS, In 2010, the Capital Region COPS Chapter  was  incorporated
as the Blue Friday New York nonprofit organization; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The mission of Blue Friday New York is to help rebuild the
lives of survivors of law enforcement officers killed  in  the  line  of
duty  by  serving  as  a  clearinghouse  for federal and state benefits,
information, and resources that may be available to surviving  families;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each year, approximately 140 to 160 officers are killed in
the line of duty and their families and co-workers are left to cope with
the tragic loss; and
 
  WHEREAS, Blue Friday is a reminder to pay tribute to  those  in  the
law enforcement community who have made the ultimate sacrifice; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  April  28, 2023, WGNA and Blue Friday New York will be

countless  individuals and longtime business partners who have supported
this program over the years and furthered its mission; and

different  police  agencies  participating in the Capital District area;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York is eternally grateful for the service
of  its brave men and women in law enforcement, and applauds the efforts
of Blue Friday New York to assist the families of those  who  have  made
the ultimate sacrifice; now, therefore, be it
