 AN ACT to amend the civil practice law and rules, in relation to provid-
  ing a statute of limitations for certain actions against  professional
  engineers,  architects,  landscape  architects,  land  surveyors  and
  construction contractors and to repeal section 214-d, subdivision  (h)
  of  rule  3211  and subdivision (i) of rule 3212 of the civil practice
  law and rules relating thereto
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Statement  of findings and purpose. The legislature finds
 that (a) the open-ended and continuing liability imposed upon members of
 the design professions and  construction  contractors,  due  to  alleged
 deficiencies  relating to improvements to real property, has resulted in
 an unfair burden on such professionals and a  general  increase  in  the
 cost  of  both public and private improvements to real property, (b) the
 cost of maintaining adequate insurance coverage is so expensive  that  a
 significant  number of design professionals and construction contractors
 are forced to forego insurance coverage altogether to the  detriment  of
 the  public's safety and welfare. The legislature further finds that the
 best designed and constructed improvement is dependent upon proper main-
 tenance to preserve its integrity and safety and it is  thus  of  impor-
 tance to the public safety and welfare to ensure than an owner maintains
 and  repairs  that  which  is the property of the owner. The legislature
 therefore finds that it is necessary and desirable to establish  a  time
 limit  after which tort claims for personal injury or wrongful death may
 not be asserted against such professionals and contractors. That statute
 of repose set forth herein, with a claim accruing on the date  that  the
 improvement  was  completed,  will preserve the liability of the profes-
 sional and contractor during a period in which the defects, if any, will

 be revealed, and  therefore  will  establish  an  appropriate  limit  on
 liability, while affording adequate protection to the public.
  § 2. Section 214-d of the civil practice law and rules is REPEALED and
 a new section 214-d is added to read as follows:
  §  214-D.  LIMITATIONS  ON  CERTAIN ACTIONS AGAINST PROFESSIONAL ENGI-
 NEERS, ARCHITECTS, LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS, LAND SURVEYORS OR  CONSTRUCTION

 A  PROFESSIONAL  ENGINEER, ARCHITECT, LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT, LAND SURVEYOR
 OR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS AFTER THE  COMPLETION  OF
 SUCH IMPROVEMENT.
  2.  IF, BY REASON OF SUCH DEFECT, AN INJURY TO THE PERSON OR AN INJURY
 CAUSING WRONGFUL DEATH OR DAMAGES TO PROPERTY OCCURS  DURING  THE  TENTH

 WRONGFUL DEATH OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY MAY  BE  BROUGHT  WITHIN  ONE  YEAR
