  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 9, 2024, as Lung Cancer Screening Awareness
  Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious health
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 9, 2024, as Lung
Cancer Screening Awareness Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the  American  Cancer  Society,  over  238,000
Americans  will  be  newly diagnosed with lung cancer this year and over
127,000 will die from the disease making it the leading cause of  cancer
deaths in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related death
in  New  York State, with over 14,000 estimated new cases of the disease
in New York State in 2024, and an estimated 6,000 New Yorkers  will  die
from lung cancer this year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Any person is at risk for developing lung cancer, as there
are many risk factors including smoking, family  history,  environmental
causes and other lifestyle factors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nearly half of lung cancer cases are not detected until it
is too late, and the  survival  rate  is  only  six  percent  for  those
diagnosed at a late stage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The screening and early detection of lung cancer are vital
to the health and well-being of New York State residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, More needs to be done to educate high-risk Americans  about
lung  cancer,  as it accounts for more deaths than breast, prostate, and
colorectal cancer combined; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United  States  Preventative  Services  Task  Force
recommends  annual  screening  for  lung  cancer  with low-dose computed
tomography (LDCT) in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have  a  20  pack  a
year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15
years;  screening  people  who are at high risk for lung cancer can find
lung cancer at an early stage and improve their  chances  of  surviving;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lung  cancer  screening  with  low-dose  CT scans has been
recommended for those at high risk since  2013,  but  according  to  the
American Cancer Society only 6.5 percent of the eight and a half million
people  who  are  at  high-risk  for developing the disease are actually
undergoing screening; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT scans has been shown
to decrease mortality by 20 percent; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  the  most common lung
cancer, the 5-year survival rate is 65% when found at a localized  stage
but only 9% when found at a distant stage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Only  31.0% of non-small cell lung cancer cases are caught
at an early stage in New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Cancer Institute (NCI) states that lung cancer
screenings can find abnormal tissues or lung cancer at an  early  stage,
before  a  person has symptoms, and can make lung cancer easier to treat
and achieve higher survival rates; waiting to treat until after symptoms
appear may increase the likelihood the cancer has already  metastasized;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year  marks  the  53rd  Anniversary  of  passing the
National Cancer Act, yet screening for  and  education  of  lung  cancer
continues to be alarmingly low compared to other forms of cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative  that there be greater public awareness
about the risk of lung cancer to New Yorkers and the importance for  New
York  citizens  to  talk  to their healthcare provider about recommended
lung cancer screenings, and  be  screened  with  low-dose  CT  scans  as
appropriate; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 9, 2024, as  Lung
Cancer  Screening  Awareness  Day  in  the  State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  New  York;  and
the American Lung Association in New York.
