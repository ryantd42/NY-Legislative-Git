 PART,  FOR A PERIOD OF ONE CALENDAR YEAR FROM THE DATE OF BILLING OF THE

 BE PLACED ON THE PROPERTY BY THE  SEWAGE-WORKS  CORPORATION.  SUCH  LIEN
 SHALL  BE  ENFORCED UNDER ARTICLE THREE OF THE LIEN LAW. SUCH LIEN SHALL
 NOT HAVE PRIORITY OVER ANY OTHER SECURITY INTEREST IN THE REAL PROPERTY.

 APPROPRIATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL OFFICE HANDLING SUCH MATTERS WHERE THE REAL
 PROPERTY IS LOCATED.
  3.  THE  AGGRIEVED PARTY HAS ONE YEAR FROM AFTER THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD

 PERSONALLY,  OR  BY  MAIL, UPON THE PERSON WITH WHOM THE UNPAID SERVICES
 WERE PROVIDED TO.
