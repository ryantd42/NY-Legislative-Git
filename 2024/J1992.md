  HONORING  Steve  Davis  upon  the  occasion of his
  designation for special recognition after  55  years
  of  dedicated  service  to  the  West  Winfield Fire
  Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are inspired  by,  and
indebted  to,  our  noble  firefighters  who exhibit courage and bravery
every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Steve Davis
upon the occasion of his designation for special  recognition  after  55
years of dedicated service to the West Winfield Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Steve  Davis  has  consistently  demonstrated  a  level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity,  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the firefighting service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected men and women are often the first
to  respond  to  an  emergency,  whether  the  emergency  is  a  fire,
transportation  accident,  natural  disaster,  act of terrorism, medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others,  and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Steve  Davis  is  such a firefighter; throughout his 55 years of devoted
service, he heroically performed, above and beyond  the  call  of  duty,
those  responsibilities  which  define the task of fire protection; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Steve  Davis  upon  the  occasion  of his designation for special
recognition after 55 years of dedicated service  to  the  West  Winfield
Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Steve Davis.
