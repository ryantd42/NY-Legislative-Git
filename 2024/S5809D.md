 benefits are to be continued for life to the surviving spouse after  the

  g. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, EFFECTIVE THE FIRST DAY
 OF SEPTEMBER, TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FIVE,  the  surviving  spouse  of  a
 deceased  retired member who retired under an option which provides that
 benefits are to be continued for life to the surviving spouse after  the

 payment  for  the  month of September, two thousand TWENTY-FIVE, or (ii)
 the month following the death of the deceased retired member,  whichever
 is later.
  § 4. Subdivision g of section 13-696 of the administrative code of the
 city  of  New  York,  as  added  by  chapter 125 of the laws of 2000, is
 amended to read as follows:
  g. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, EFFECTIVE THE FIRST DAY
 OF SEPTEMBER, TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FIVE,  the  surviving  spouse  of  a
 deceased  retired  member  of  the  New  York city employees' retirement
 system, the New York city teachers' retirement system, the New York city
 police pension fund, the New York city fire department pension  fund  or
 the New York city board of education retirement system who retired under
 an  option  which provides that benefits are to be continued for life to
 the surviving spouse after the death of the member, shall be entitled to
 receive a benefit pursuant  to  this  section.  Said  benefit  shall  be
 [fifty]  ONE  HUNDRED percent of the monthly benefit which the pensioner
 would be receiving if living, and shall commence (i) with a payment  for
 the  month  of  September,  two  thousand TWENTY-FIVE, or (ii) the month
 following the death of the deceased retired member, whichever is later.
  § 5. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would provide an increase in the  defined  benefit  cost-of-
 living  adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems. Start-
 ing with a payment in September 2025, the cost-of-living benefit payable
 to a surviving spouse who is eligible for COLA will  be  increased  from
 fifty  percent  to one hundred percent of the benefit that the pensioner
 would have received.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  (NYSLERS),  pursuant to Section 25 of the Retirement
 and Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely  by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $1.7 billion.
 S. 5809--C  3
 
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a  past  service  cost  to cover retrospective benefit increases and (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New York will be
 required to pay $1.82 billion (including interest) as of March 1, 2025.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in NYSLERS  is  0.03%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $4.4  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $6.6 million to the local participating employers.  This permanent annu-
 al cost will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the bill-
 ing rate and salary of the affected members.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $180 million.
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in required
  value benefits  contributions
 
  Tiers 1-5  $173 million  $86 million
  Tier 6  $7 million  $94 million
  Total  $180 million  $180 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit increases.  The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in NYSLPFRS  is  0.4%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $3.4  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $14 million to the local participating employers. This permanent  annual
 cost  will vary in subsequent billing cycles with changes in the billing
 rate and salary of the affected members.

  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.

 during the  2024  Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note  No.  2024-45,
 prepared  by  the  Actuary  for  the New York State and Local Retirement
 System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 S. 5809--C  4
 
  As it relates to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System,  this
 bill  would amend subdivision g of Section 532-a of the Education Law to
 increase the  cost-of-living  adjustment  (COLA)  benefit  to  surviving
 spouse  beneficiaries  of  deceased retirees who elected an option which
 provides a lifetime benefit to their surviving spouse. The COLA survivor
 benefit  would be equal to 100% of the monthly benefit which the retiree
 would be receiving if alive. The current COLA survivor benefit is  equal
 to  50%  of  the  benefit  the retiree would be receiving if alive. This
 increase in spousal survivor benefit would also  be  applicable  to  the
 "catch-up"  supplementation  provided  under  subdivision  f to eligible
 retirees who retired before January 1, 1997.  This  benefit  improvement
 would be effective in September of 2025.
  The annual cost to the employers of members of NYSTRS for this benefit
 is  estimated  to  be  $42.0 million or 0.22% of payroll if this bill is
 enacted.
  Member data is from the System's most recent actuarial valuation files
 as of June 30, 2023, consisting of data provided by the employers to the
 Retirement System. The most recent data distributions and statistics can

 tions and methods are  provided  in  the  System's  Actuarial  Valuation

 Legislative Session. I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary  for  the
