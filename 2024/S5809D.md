  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As it relates to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System,  this
 bill  would amend subdivision g of Section 532-a of the Education Law to
 increase the  cost-of-living  adjustment  (COLA)  benefit  to  surviving
 spouse  beneficiaries  of  deceased retirees who elected an option which
 provides a lifetime benefit to their surviving spouse.  The COLA  survi-
 vor  benefit  would  be  equal  to 100% of the monthly benefit which the
 retiree would be receiving if alive. The current COLA  survivor  benefit
 is  equal to 50% of the benefit the retiree would be receiving if alive.
 This increase in spousal survivor benefit would also  be  applicable  to
 the  "catch-up" supplementation provided under subdivision f to eligible
 retirees who retired before January 1, 1997.  This  benefit  improvement
 would be effective in September of 2024.
  The annual cost to the employers of members of NYSTRS for this benefit
 is  estimated  to  be  $39.3 million or 0.21% of payroll if this bill is
 enacted.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System. Data distributions and statistics can be found in  the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 S. 5809--A  3
 
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.
  The  source  of  this  estimate is Fiscal Note 2023-20 dated March 13,
 2023 prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State  Teach-
 ers'  Retirement  System  and  is  intended for use only during the 2023
 Legislative Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for  the
 New  York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the Ameri-
 can Academy of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards  of  the
 American  Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would bill would provide an increase in the defined  benefit
 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems.
 Starting  with  a  payment in September 2024, the cost-of-living benefit
 payable to a surviving spouse who is eligible for COLA will be increased
 from fifty percent to one  hundred  percent  of  the  benefit  that  the
 pensioner would have received.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS), pursuant to Section 25  of  the  Retirement
 and  Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2023 legislative session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $1.5 billion.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a past service cost to cover retrospective  benefit  increases  and  (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1)  To  fund  retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New York will be
 required to pay $1.60 billion (including interest) as of March 1, 2024.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in the NYSLERS is 0.04% of billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $4.5  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 $6.5 million to local participating employers in the fiscal year  ending
 March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent bill-
 ing  cycles  with changes in the billing rate and salary of the affected
 members.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and Local  Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would be shared
 by the State of New York and the local participating  employers  in  the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2023 legislative session,
 the  increase  in  the  present value of benefits would be approximately
 $158 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in future
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1-5  $152 million  $85 million
  Tier 6  $6 million  $73 million
  Total  $158 million  $158 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the billing rates charged  annually  to  cover  both  retrospective  and
 prospective  benefit  increases. The annual contribution required of all
 participating employers in NYSLPFRS  is  0.4%  of  billable  salary,  or
 approximately  $3.4  million  to the State of New York and approximately
 S. 5809--A  4
 
 $14 million to the local participating  employers  in  the  fiscal  year
 ending  March  31,  2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subse-
 quent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of  the
 affected members.
