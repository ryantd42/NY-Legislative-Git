  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As  it relates to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System, this
 bill would amend subdivision g of Section 532-a of the Education Law  to
 increase  the  cost-of-living  adjustment  (COLA)  benefit  to surviving
 spouse beneficiaries of deceased retirees who elected  an  option  which
 provides  a lifetime benefit to their surviving spouse.  The COLA survi-
 vor benefit would be equal to 100% of  the  monthly  benefit  which  the
 retiree  would  be receiving if alive. The current COLA survivor benefit
 is equal to 50% of the benefit the retiree would be receiving if  alive.
 This  increase  in  spousal survivor benefit would also be applicable to
 the "catch-up" supplementation provided under subdivision f to  eligible
 retirees  who  retired  before January 1, 1997. This benefit improvement
 would be effective in September of 2024.
  The annual cost to the employers of members of NYSTRS for this benefit
 is estimated to be $39.3 million or 0.21% of payroll  if  this  bill  is
 enacted.
