  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  As it relates to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System,  this
 bill  would amend subdivision g of Section 532-a of the Education Law to
 increase the  cost-of-living  adjustment  (COLA)  benefit  to  surviving
 spouse  beneficiaries  of  deceased retirees who elected an option which
 provides a lifetime benefit to their surviving spouse.  The COLA  survi-
 vor  benefit  would  be  equal  to 100% of the monthly benefit which the
 retiree would be receiving if alive. The current COLA  survivor  benefit
 is  equal to 50% of the benefit the retiree would be receiving if alive.
 This increase in spousal survivor benefit would also  be  applicable  to
 the  "catch-up" supplementation provided under subdivision f to eligible
 retirees who retired before January 1, 1997.  This  benefit  improvement
 would be effective in September of 2024.
  The annual cost to the employers of members of NYSTRS for this benefit
 is  estimated  to  be  $39.3 million or 0.21% of payroll if this bill is
 enacted.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation

 System. Data distributions and statistics can be found in  the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al  assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial Valu-
 ation Report.
  The source of this estimate is Fiscal Note  2023-20  dated  March  13,
 2023  prepared by the Office of the Actuary of the New York State Teach-
 ers' Retirement System and is intended for  use  only  during  the  2023
 Legislative  Session.  I, Richard A. Young, am the Chief Actuary for the
 New York State Teachers' Retirement System. I am a member of the  Ameri-
 can  Academy  of Actuaries and I meet the Qualification Standards of the
 American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion  contained
 herein.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would bill would provide an increase in the defined benefit
 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for New York public retirement systems.
 Starting with a payment in September 2024,  the  cost-of-living  benefit
 payable to a surviving spouse who is eligible for COLA will be increased
 from  fifty  percent  to  one  hundred  percent  of the benefit that the
 pensioner would have received.
  Insofar as this bill affects the New York State and  Local  Employees'
 Retirement  System  (NYSLERS),  pursuant to Section 25 of the Retirement
 and Social Security Law, the increased costs would be borne entirely  by
 the State of New York and would require an itemized appropriation suffi-
 cient to pay the cost of the provision. If this bill were enacted during
 the 2023 legislative session, the increase in the present value of bene-
 fits would be approximately $1.5 billion.
  In the NYSLERS, this benefit improvement will be funded by (1) billing
 a  past  service  cost  to cover retrospective benefit increases and (2)
 increasing the billing rates charged annually to cover prospective bene-
 fit increases, as follows:
  (1) To fund retrospective  costs,  the  State  of  New  York  will  be
 required to pay $1.60 billion (including interest) as of March 1, 2024.
  (2) To fund prospective costs, the annual contribution required of all
 participating  employers  in the NYSLERS is 0.04% of billable salary, or
 approximately $4.5 million to the State of New  York  and  approximately
 $6.5  million to local participating employers in the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subsequent bill-
 ing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of  the  affected
 members.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS), the increased costs would  be  shared
 by  the  State  of New York and the local participating employers in the
 NYSLPFRS. If this bill were enacted during the 2023 legislative session,
 the increase in the present value of  benefits  would  be  approximately
 $158 million.
 
  NYSLPFRS  Increase in present  Increase in future
  value benefits  contributions
  Tiers 1-5  $152 million  $85 million
  Tier 6  $6 million  $73 million
  Total  $158 million  $158 million
 
  In the NYSLPFRS, this benefit improvement will be funded by increasing
 the  billing  rates  charged  annually  to  cover both retrospective and
 prospective benefit increases. The annual contribution required  of  all
 S. 5809--B  4
 
 participating  employers  in  NYSLPFRS  is  0.4%  of billable salary, or
 approximately $3.4 million to the State of New  York  and  approximately
 $14  million  to  the  local  participating employers in the fiscal year
 ending  March  31,  2025. This PERMANENT ANNUAL COST will vary in subse-
 quent billing cycles with changes in the billing rate and salary of  the
 affected members.

 of  the  proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a substitute for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This estimate, dated March 30, 2023, and intended for use only  during
 the  2023  Legislative  Session, is Fiscal Note No. 2023-79, prepared by
 the Actuary for the New York State and Local Retirement System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation, as it relates to  the  New
 York  City  Retirement  Systems  and  Pension Funds (NYCRS), would amend
 Section 13-696 of the Administrative Code of the City  of  New  York  to
 increase  the  Cost-of-Living  Adjustment (COLA), effective September 1,
 2024, to an eligible surviving spouse from 50% to 100% of the  COLA  the
 pensioner  would  be  receiving  if  still  alive  for the New York City
 Employees' Retirement System  (NYCERS),  the  New  York  City  Teachers'
 Retirement System (NYCTRS), the New York City Board of Education Retire-
 ment  System (BERS), the New York City Police Pension Fund (POLICE), and
 the New York City Fire Pension Fund (FIRE).
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  BACKGROUND: The COLA currently provides for an annual  increase  equal
 to  a  percentage  of the annual retirement allowance otherwise payable,
 computed without optional modification on the first $18,000  of  retire-
 ment  allowance.  That percentage is equal to 50% of the increase in the
 consumer price index (CPI) in the one-year period ending on the March 31
 prior to the COLA effective on the ensuing September 1.  The  percentage
 is  rounded to the next higher one-tenth of one percent and shall not be
 less than 1% nor more than 3%.
  The surviving spouse of a deceased retired member who retired under an
 option which provides that benefits are to be continued for life to  the
 surviving  spouse  after  the  death  of the retired member is currently
 entitled to receive a COLA equal to 50% of the COLA the pensioner  would
 be  receiving if living. This proposed legislation would change from 50%
 to 100% the percentage of COLA a surviving  spouse  receives  after  the
 death of the retired member.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT:  The  estimated  financial  impact  to  NYCRS is an
 increase in Present Value of Future  Benefits  of  approximately  $658.3
 S. 5809--B  5
 
 million  and  an  increase  in Fiscal Year 2024 annual employer contrib-
 utions of approximately $634.3 million.
  The  increase  in  Fiscal  Year  2024 annual employer contributions of
 $634.3 million is estimated to be $421.5 million for New York  City  and
 $212.8  million  for  the  other  obligors  of NYCRS. A breakdown of the
 financial impact by System is shown in the table below.
 
  Additional  Additional First Year
 NYCRS  Present Value of Future Benefits  Annual Employer
  ($ Millions)  Contributions*
  ($ Millions)
 
 NYCERS  $402.6  $382.8
 NYCTRS  183.8  180.9
 BERS  19.4  18.9
 POLICE  40.3  40.1
 FIRE  12.2  11.6
  Total  $658.3  $634.3
 * Total additional employer contributions after the first year are esti-
 mated to be approximately $12.2 million per year.
  New Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) attributable to  benefit  changes
 are  generally  amortized  over  the remaining working lifetime of those
 impacted by the benefit changes. For purposes of this  Fiscal  Note,  it
 has  been assumed that increases in UAL attributable to current retirees
 would be recognized immediately and that increases in  UAL  attributable
 to  active members would be amortized over periods ranging from 12 to 15
 years depending on the System (11 to  14  payments  under  One-Year  Lag
 Methodology) using level dollar payments.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuations of NYCRS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCRS.  Also,
 assumptions  for active members electing a form of pension at retirement
 that would continue a payment to a surviving spouse (ranging from 15% to
 30%) were made based on the distribution of  current  elections  and  an
 estimate of future elections.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuations  of NYCRS used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population, and other factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  * The initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
