  CELEBRATING  Gandhi  Jayanti,  the day of Mohandas
  Karamchand Gandhi's birth, on October 2, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, The true architects of  society  and  community  are  those
extraordinary  individuals  whose  faith and unremitting commitment have
served to sustain the spiritual and cultural values  of  life;  Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi, a civil rights leader who inspired freedom across the
world, was undoubtedly such an individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is justly proud to celebrate Gandhi
Jayanti, the day of  Mohandas  Karamchand  Gandhi's  birth,  on  Monday,
October 2, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  of  three  nationally  celebrated  holidays in India,
Gandhi Jayanti marks the birth of the enormously  influential  life  and
work of Mohandas Gandhi on India's history and culture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Gandhi  Jayanti  is marked by prayer services and tributes
all over India, including at Gandhi's memorial Raj  Ghat  in  New  Delhi
where  he  was  cremated;  popular celebratory activities include prayer
meetings and commemorative  ceremonies  by  colleges,  local  government
institutions and socio-political organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The year 2019 marked the 150th Anniversary of the birth of
Mohandas Gandhi, which was celebrated by the minting of  "150"  currency
in  his  honor, paintings of his face on vehicles, and the commissioning
of an art exhibition titled "Picture Postcards of Gandhi"; and
 
  WHEREAS, Gandhi Jayanti is also celebrated by  the  United  Nations,
which  in  a 2007 resolution marked October 2nd as the International Day
of Non-Violence; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born on October 2, 1869,  Mohandas  Gandhi  was  an  Indian
lawyer,  politician,  writer  and  social  activist  who helped lead the
Indian independence movement; he is  internationally  esteemed  for  his
doctrine  of  nonviolent  protest,  satyagraha, which he used to achieve
political and social progress; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within India, Mohandas Gandhi's philosophy lived on in  the
messages  of reformers such as Vinoba Bhave; abroad, Martin Luther King,
Jr., borrowed heavily from Gandhi's practice of  nonviolence  and  civil
disobedience to achieve social equality; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, and perhaps most impactful of all, the freedom
of  which  Mohandas  Gandhi's  movement  won  for India inspired similar
movements in Asia and Africa; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mohandas Gandhi died on January 30, 1948; even many decades
after his death, his legacy continues in countless ways as organizations
and  institutions  across  the  globe  host  numerous  festivals  and
celebrations in his honor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout his purposeful journey of life, Mohandas Gandhi
compiled, with  dignity  and  kindness,  decades  filled  with  gracious
literary  works,  moral causes, and humanitarian efforts, justly earning
the devotion of his followers and the  admiration  and  respect  of  his
fellow man; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, the day of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's birth,
on October 2, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to The Honorable Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India.
