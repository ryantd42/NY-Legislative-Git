 Introduced by Sens. SKOUFIS, MARTINEZ -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Civil Service and
  Pensions
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  authorizing retired firefighters to be employed as instructors of fire
  sciences by a career and technical education center without diminution
  of his or her retirement benefits
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding
 a new section 214-c to read as follows:
  §  214-C.  EMPLOYMENT OF CERTAIN RETIRED PERSONS WHO RETIRED FROM FIRE
 SERVICE.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  CHAPTER  OR  THE
 PROVISIONS  OF  ANY  STATE  OR  LOCAL LAW OR CHARTER TO THE CONTRARY, NO
 RETIRED PERSON WHO RETIRED FROM FIRE SERVICE AS A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK
 STATE AND LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR THE NEW  YORK  FIRE
 DEPARTMENT  PENSION  FUND, AND WHO IS EMPLOYED BY A CAREER AND TECHNICAL
 EDUCATION CENTER AS AN INSTRUCTOR IN A FIRE SCIENCE PROGRAM APPROVED  BY
 THE  EDUCATION DEPARTMENT, SHALL HAVE HIS OR HER RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE OR
 BENEFITS SUSPENDED OR REDUCED BECAUSE OF  COMPENSATION  EARNED  BY  SUCH
 RETIRED PERSON FROM SERVICE AS A FIRE SCIENCE INSTRUCTOR.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  Insofar  as  it  would  affect the New York State and Local Retirement
 System (NYSLRS), this bill would  allow  retired  firefighters  who  are
 employed  as  fire  science instructors in a program approved by the New
 York State Department of Education to continue  to  receive  their  full
 retirement  benefit.  Currently,  the  post-retirement earnings limit is
 $35,000.
  If this bill were enacted during the  2023  legislative  session,  the
 direct  cost  incurred  would  be the retiree's post-retirement earnings

 more than $35,000 each calendar year, not to  exceed  the  full  pension
 benefit paid by the NYSLRS during that period.
  The  number  of  members  and  retirees  who could be affected by this
 legislation cannot be readily determined. For each retiree hired  pursu-
 ant  to  this  proposal, an annual cost of $90,000 is expected. If large
 numbers of retirees are hired into such  positions,  significant  annual
 costs would result.
  All  costs will be shared by the State of New York and all participat-
 ing employers in the NYSLRS and spread over future billing cycles. Since
 this proposal exclusively benefits retirees,  the  increased  costs  are
 primarily  attributable to retirees from Tiers 1 - 4. Approximately half
 the contributions required to fund this proposal will  be  collected  on
 salary reported for current members of Tier 6.
