  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  FIRE
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  5,030
  - Average Age:  33.5
  - Average Service:  5.5
  - Average Salary:  112,400
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, Tier 3 FIRE members who retire
 with 20 years of service are eligible to receive an annual benefit  that
 is  equal  to 42% of Final Average Salary (FAS), increasing to a maximum
 benefit of 50% of FAS after 22 years of service.
  Under the proposed legislation, Tier 3 FIRE members who retire with 20
 years of service would be eligible to receive the maximum benefit  equal
 to 50% of FAS.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems except for:
  *  Retirement rates were adjusted to reflect the earlier payability of
 the service retirement benefit associated with the proposed legislation.
  * New entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so  that  total
 payroll increases by 3% each year for impacted groups. New entrant demo-
 graphics were developed based on data for recent new hires and actuarial
 judgement.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
