 Introduced by Sen. FERNANDEZ -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the family court act, in relation to the extension of an
  order of protection for aggravating circumstances
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The opening paragraph of section 842 of  the  family  court
 act,  as  amended by chapter 335 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read
 as follows:
  An order of protection under section eight hundred forty-one  of  this
 part  shall  set  forth reasonable conditions of behavior to be observed
 for a period not in excess of two years by the petitioner or  respondent
 or  for  a  period not in excess of five years upon (i) a finding by the
 court on the record of the existence  of  aggravating  circumstances  as
 defined  in  paragraph (vii) of subdivision (a) of section eight hundred
 twenty-seven of this article; or (ii) a finding  by  the  court  on  the
 record  that  the  conduct  alleged in the petition is in violation of a
 valid order of protection.  Any  finding  of  aggravating  circumstances
 pursuant  to  this  section  shall  be stated on the record and upon the
 order of protection. [The court may also, upon motion, extend the  order
 of  protection  for  a  reasonable period of time upon a showing of good
 cause or consent of the parties] THE COURT  SHALL  ALSO,  UPON  REQUEST,
 EXTEND THE ORDER OF PROTECTION FOR AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DEFINED
 IN  PARAGRAPH  (VII) OF SUBDIVISION (A) OF SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY-
 SEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE, TO A LIFETIME ORDER OF PROTECTION. The fact  that
 abuse  has  not  occurred  during the pendency of an order shall not, in
 itself, constitute sufficient ground for denying or  failing  to  extend
 the  order.  The  court  must articulate a basis for its decision on the
 record. The duration of any temporary order shall not  by  itself  be  a
 factor  in  determining  the  length or issuance of any final order. Any
 order of protection issued pursuant to this section shall specify if  an
 order of probation is in effect. Any order of protection issued pursuant
 to this section may require the petitioner or the respondent:
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
