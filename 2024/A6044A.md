 in active service who has credit for at least one year of member service
 may borrow, no more than  once  during  each  twelve  month  period,  an
 amount, not less than one thousand dollars and which would not cause the
 balance  owed  pursuant  to this section, including any amounts borrowed
 then outstanding, to exceed (i) fifty  percent  of  the  member's  total
 contributions  made  pursuant  to section five hundred seventeen of this
 article (including interest credited at the rate set forth  in  subdivi-
 sion  c  of such section five hundred seventeen compounded annually); or
 (ii) fifty thousand dollars, whichever is less.
  § 2. Subdivisions d and i of  section  517-c  of  the  retirement  and
 social  security  law, subdivision d as added by chapter 920 of the laws
 of 1990 and subdivision i as amended by chapter 426 of the laws of 2018,
 are amended to read as follows:
  d. The rate of interest payable  upon  loans  made  pursuant  to  this
 section  shall:  (1) for members of the New York state and local employ-
 ees' retirement system, be one percent less than the valuation  rate  of
 interest adopted for such system, however, in no event shall the rate be
 less  than  the  rate set forth in subdivision c of section five hundred
 seventeen of this article; (2) for members of the New York city  employ-
 ees'  retirement  system,  be one percent less than the regular interest
 rate established pursuant to  [subdivision  (c)  of  section  13-101.12]
 PARAGRAPH (C) OF SUBDIVISION TWELVE OF SECTION 13-101 of the administra-
 tive  code of the city of New York for such system, however, in no event

 less than the regular interest rate established pursuant to subparagraph

 hundred  seventy-five  of the education law for such system, however, in
 no event shall the rate be less than the rate set forth in subdivision c

 ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION B OF SECTION 13-638.2 OF THE  ADMIN-
 ISTRATIVE  CODE  OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK FOR SUCH SYSTEM, HOWEVER, IN NO
 EVENT SHALL THE RATE BE LESS THAN THE RATE SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION C OF

 change  in  the  interest  rate, it shall be applicable to loans made or
 renegotiated after the date of such change in the interest rate.
  i. Notwithstanding the provisions of section five hundred  sixteen  of
 this  article, whenever a member of such a retirement system, for whom a
 loan is outstanding, retires, the retirement allowance  payable  without
 optional  modification shall be reduced by a life annuity which is actu-
 arially equivalent to the amount of the outstanding loan (all  outstand-
 ing  loans  shall continue to accrue interest charges until retirement),
 such life annuity being calculated utilizing the interest rate on thirty
 year United States treasury bonds as of January first  of  the  calendar
 year  of  the  effective date of retirement and the mortality tables for
 options available under section five hundred fourteen of this article. A
 retiree of the New York city  employees'  retirement  system,  board  of
 education  retirement  system of the city of New York, [or] the New York
 state and local employees' retirement  system,  OR  THE  NEW  YORK  CITY
 POLICE  PENSION  FUND  whose  benefit  has been so reduced may repay the
 outstanding balance of the loan at any time.  Benefits payable after the
 repayment of the loan shall not be subject to  the  actuarial  reduction
 required by this subdivision.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend the Retirement
 and Social Security Law (RSSL) to permit Tier 3,  Tier  3  Revised,  and
 Tier  3 Enhanced members (who are subject to Article 14) of the New York
 City Police Pension Fund (POLICE) to take loans  against  their  accumu-
 lated total member contributions with interest.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  BACKGROUND:  Tier 1 and Tier 2 members of POLICE are generally permit-
 ted, subject to certain restrictions, to borrow from  their  accumulated
 Basic  Member Contributions (BMC) with interest. However, Tier 3, Tier 3
 Revised, and Tier 3 Enhanced members are currently not permitted to take
 loans on their contributions.
  The proposed legislation would permit Tier 3, Tier 3 Revised, and Tier
 3 Enhanced members of POLICE to  borrow  from  their  accumulated  total
 member  contributions,  which  include  Enhanced  Plan Additional Member
 Contributions (AMC). Loans may be taken no more than once  a  year,  and
 the  dollar  amount  is subject to minimum and maximum restrictions. For
 members with a date of membership before January 1,  2018,  the  members
 may  take out a loan up to 75% of their total contributions plus accumu-
 lated interest. For members with a date of membership on and after Janu-
 ary 1, 2018, the loan is limited to 50% of their total  member  contrib-
 utions plus accumulated interest or $50,000, whichever is less.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT:  In the event an outstanding loan exists at retire-
 ment, the balance of the unpaid loan is converted to an annuity based on
 the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury  securities  and  deducted  from  the
 annual  retirement  allowance otherwise payable. This conversion is made
 on an actuarial basis that is different than the basis used to determine
 the employer contribution to POLICE. As a result of this  difference  in
 actuarial  bases  and based on the census data and actuarial assumptions
 and methods described herein, the enactment of this proposed legislation
 would increase the Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB)  by  approxi-
 mately $43.7 million.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to POLICE, there would be  an  increase  in  the  Unfunded
 Accrued  Liability  (UAL) of approximately $11.3 million and an increase
 in the Present Value of Future Employer  Normal  Cost  of  approximately
 $32.4 million.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer  contributions  of  approximately  $3.4  million. This increase
 consists of an increase in the  Normal  Cost  in  addition  to  the  UAL
 payment.
  Future  costs  will  vary  based on the amount of member contributions
 eligible for loans. Individual member balances are expected to increase,
 however in the future, a larger portion  of  the  membership  will  have
 membership  dates  on or after January 1, 2018, and therefore be limited
 to a maximum loan percentage  of  50%  and  a  maximum  loan  amount  of
 $50,000.
  New  UAL  attributable to benefit changes are generally amortized over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately 18  years
 and  the  increase in UAL was therefore amortized over an 18-year period
 (17 payments under the One-Year  Lag  Methodology)  using  level  dollar
 payments.

  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of POLICE  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The  19,375  Tier  3,  Tier  3 Revised, and Tier 3 Enhanced members in
 POLICE as of June 30, 2022 had an  average  age  of  approximately  32.2
 years, average service of approximately 5.7 years, and an average salary
 of approximately $101,600.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of POLICE.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  the  changes
 would  be  reflected  for  the first time in the June 30, 2022 actuarial
 valuation of POLICE used to determine employer contributions for  Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  It  has  been  further assumed that the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury
 securities, on a long-term basis would equal 3.5% per year and that  25%
 of  member  balances  available for borrowing would be taken as loans at
 retirement.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
