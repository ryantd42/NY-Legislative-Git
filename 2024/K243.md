  HONORING  Firefighter  Robert  Sykes  upon  the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  50  years  of  dedicated service to the North
  Bailey Fire Company
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
Robert  Sykes  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to the North Bailey Fire
Company to be celebrated at the Annual Installation of Officers  banquet
on Saturday, April 22, 2023, at the Ellicott Creek Banquet Facility; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Robert  Sykes,  affectionately  known as Bobby, joined the
North Bailey Fire Company on January 15, 1973; throughout his  50  years
of service, he has been a longtime member of the drill team and softball
team,  and  is  a  well-respected mentor to all the new firefighters who
join the Company; and
 
  WHEREAS, Volunteer Firefighter Robert Sykes is consistently a Top 10
responder within the North Bailey Fire Company; he continues  to  attend
many  fire  and  EMS  calls,  training  drills,  fundraisers,  and  fire
prevention details, proving to be a prime example of dedication  to  the
volunteer fire service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Robert Sykes is one such firefighter; throughout  50  years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Robert Sykes upon the occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to the North Bailey Fire
Company; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter Robert Sykes.
