  Banks
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the state finance law, the financial services law and
  the New York state urban development corporation act, in  relation  to
  establishing the empire state enhanced public payment system act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as  the  "enhanced
 public payment system act".
  §  2.  Legislative intent. Many New York residents, including individ-
 uals who receive public benefits and payments related to  nutrition  and
 social  services, are targets of identity and consumer theft. Similarly,
 many New York residents who rely on Medicaid  home  and  community  care
 services  are  victims  of  exploitation  by private intermediaries that
 manage public payments.
  A system of individual digital wallets or payment accounts, linked  to
 a single master account that enables payments to move between such indi-
 vidual  wallets or payment accounts, is now easy to construct and admin-
 ister with the use of secure digital payment technologies. The state  of
 New  York  annually disburses more than thirty billion dollars of social
 and health  benefits,  including  home  care  services,  and  fifty-five
 billion  dollars  in  the  form  of  tax  credits, procurement payments,
 pension payouts, and other program dispersals, all of which can  readily
 be  disbursed via a system of individual wallets or accounts linked to a
 master account. The state of New York also receives more than fifty-five
 billion dollars annually in the form of service  payments,  tax  monies,
 licensing  fees,  civil fines and other remittances, all of which can be
 readily paid into a master account from individual wallets  or  accounts
 of the kind just described.
  A system of individual digital wallets or payment accounts linked to a
 master account could accordingly function as a state-provided and admin-
 istered  payment  infrastructure,  in  and  through which value could be
 accumulated, stored, grown and exchanged in 'real-time,'  with  no  need
 for fees or other forms of exploitative value extraction, thereby assur-
