 to read as follows:
  1. No sheriff of a county, mayor of a  city,  or  official,  or  other
 persons  authorized  by  law to appoint special deputy sheriffs, special
 constables, marshals, police officers, or peace officers in this  state,
 to preserve the public peace or quell public disturbance, shall hereaft-

 PERSON.  Nothing herein contained, however, shall apply to the  appoint-
 ment  of  a non-resident, as an emergency special deputy sheriff, by the
 sheriff of any county to act when such sheriff has declared a  state  of
 special  emergency  pursuant  to  the  provisions of section two hundred
 nine-f of the general municipal law. Provided further, that  any  person
 otherwise  qualified  who  resides in either the county of Nassau or the
 county of Suffolk may at the instance of a society for the prevention of
 cruelty to animals be appointed as a peace officer  by  the  appropriate
 appointing official of either of such counties notwithstanding that such
 appointee does not reside in the same county as the appointing official.
 Provided,  further,  that  any  person qualified who resides in a county
 adjacent to the county of Allegany may at the instance  of  the  society
 for  the  prevention of cruelty to animals for the county of Allegany be
 appointed as a peace officer by the appropriate appointing  official  of
 the county of Allegany. Provided, further, that any person qualified who
 resides in a county adjacent to the county of Albany may at the instance
