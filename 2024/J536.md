  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2023, as Kidney Disease Awareness Month in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2023,  as  Kidney  Disease
Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Kidney Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD)  is a major health problem
affecting 1.5 million New Yorkers and an  estimated  30  million  people
nationwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, CKD is a progressive condition in which kidneys do not work
as  well  as  they  should to filter waste, toxins, and fluids from your
body; and
 
  WHEREAS, CKD can progress quickly or take years to  worsen,  and  is
described  as having five stages, and progression through each stage can
eventually lead to kidney failure, also known as End Stage Renal Disease
(ESRD), which can be treated with a kidney replacement or dialysis; and
 
  WHEREAS, The incidence of  ESRD  is  rising  fast,  with  more  than
546,000  Americans  currently  receiving  treatment,  including  557,838
dialysis  patients  and  245,846  people  with  functioning  kidney
transplants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  7,250  New  Yorkers  are on the transplant waiting
list; New York State encourages all to join the State's tissue and organ
donation registry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to the fact that there are little to no  signs  of  the
condition, most individuals are not aware they have kidney disease until
it  reaches  the  later stages, thus making laboratory tests critical in
the diagnosis; some symptoms of CKD can include  changes  in  urination,
swelling  of  the  feet,  ankles, hands, and/or face, fatigue, weakness,
shortness of breath, ammonia breath or  ammonia  or  metallic  taste  in
mouth,  back or flank pain, itching, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting,
and if diabetic, more hypoglycemic episodes; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tragically, in 2016, more than 100,000 Americans died  from
end stage kidney disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Diabetes  and  hypertension  are the two leading causes of
chronic kidney disease which strikes minorities disproportionately; and
 
  WHEREAS, Kidney failure has a disproportionate impact on  people  of
color;  compared to White Americans, the likelihood of developing kidney
failure is 4.2 times greater for Black Americans, 2.3 times greater  for
American  Indians,  2.3 times greater for Latino and Hispanic Americans,
and 1.5 times greater for Asian Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, Also at particular risk are the elderly, as the  chance  of
developing  kidney  disease  increases  significantly with age; in 2020,
older adults with CKD died at a rate three times that of people  without
CKD; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People  afflicted  with  chronic  kidney disease typically
develop  other  chronic  and  life-threatening  conditions  such  as
cardiovascular disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Early  intervention  is  the  best method for managing the
complications of chronic kidney disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American Kidney Fund works on behalf of the 37  million
Americans  living with kidney disease, and the millions more at risk, to
support people wherever they are in their fight against kidney  disease-
from prevention through post-transplant living; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Northeast  Kidney  Foundation  provides  early
intervention,  community  education  and  support  programs  for  those
suffering from chronic kidney disease; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  March  2023,  as  Kidney
Disease Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
