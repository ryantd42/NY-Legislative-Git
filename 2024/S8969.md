 by  section  4 of part ZZZ of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, is amended
 to read as follows:
  19.  "surplus" means [those funds where the total sum of contributions
 received and] THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN public [matchable]  MATCHING  funds
 received  by a participating candidate and [his or her] SUCH CANDIDATE'S
 authorized committee [exceeds the total campaign  expenditures  of  such
 candidate  and  authorized  committee] for all covered elections held in
 the same calendar year or for a special election to fill a  vacancy  AND
 THE TOTAL SUCH CANDIDATE AND SUCH CANDIDATE'S AUTHORIZED COMMITTEE SPENT
 ON  QUALIFIED CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES; PROVIDED THAT IN CASES WHERE QUALI-
 FIED CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES OF  SUCH  CANDIDATE  EXCEED  PUBLIC  MATCHING
 FUNDS RECEIVED BY SUCH CANDIDATE AND SUCH CANDIDATE'S AUTHORIZED COMMIT-
 TEE  FOR  ALL  COVERED ELECTIONS HELD IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR OR FOR A
 SPECIAL ELECTION TO FILL A VACANCY, THE SURPLUS IS ZERO.
  § 3. Section 14-203 of the election law, as added by section 4 of part
 ZZZ of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, is amended to read as follows:
  § 14-203. Eligibility. 1. Terms and conditions.  To  be  eligible  for
 [voluntary  public  financing] PUBLIC MATCHING FUNDS under this title, a
 candidate must:
  (a) be a candidate in a covered election;
  (b) meet all the requirements of law to have [his or her] SUCH  CANDI-
 DATE'S  name  on  the ballot, subject to the requirements of subdivision
 three of section 1-104 and subdivision one  of  section  6-142  of  this
 chapter;
  (c)  in  the case of a covered general or special election, be opposed
 by another candidate on the ballot who is not a write-in candidate;
  (d) submit a certification in the form of an affidavit, in  such  form
 as  may  be  prescribed  by  the PCFB, that sets forth [his or her] SUCH
 CANDIDATE'S acceptance of and agreement to comply  with  the  terms  and
 conditions  for the provision of such funds in each covered election and
 such certification shall be submitted at  least  four  months  before  a
 primary  election  and on the last day in which a certification of nomi-
 nation is filed in a special election pursuant to a schedule promulgated
 by the PCFB;
  (e) be certified as a participating candidate by the PCFB;
  (f) not make, and not have made, expenditures from or use [his or her]
 SUCH CANDIDATE'S personal funds or property or  the  personal  funds  or
 property  jointly  held  with  [his  or her] SUCH CANDIDATE'S spouse, or
 unemancipated children in connection with [his or her] SUCH  CANDIDATE'S
 nomination  for election or election to a covered office, but may make a
 contribution to [his or her] SUCH CANDIDATE'S authorized committee in an
 amount that does not exceed  three  times  the  applicable  contribution
 limit  from  an individual contributor to candidates for the office that
 [he or she] SUCH CANDIDATE is seeking;
  (g) meet the threshold for eligibility set forth in subdivision two of
 this section;
  (G-1) NOT OWE ANY PAYMENTS, REPAYMENTS, OR CIVIL PENALTIES PURSUANT TO
 THIS TITLE OR ANY REGULATIONS PROMULGATED  THEREUNDER,  OR  ANY  SIMILAR
 PAYMENTS, REPAYMENTS, OR CIVIL PENALTIES UNDER ANY LOCAL PUBLIC CAMPAIGN
 FINANCE PROGRAM WITHIN THE PREVIOUS TEN YEARS;
  (h)  continue  to  abide  by all requirements during the post-election
 period; and
  (i) not have accepted contributions in amounts exceeding the  contrib-
 ution  limits set forth for candidates in paragraphs a and b of subdivi-
 S. 8969  3
 
 sion one of section 14-114 of this article during the election cycle for
 which the candidate seeks certification;
  (i)  Provided  however,  that,  if  a candidate accepted contributions
 exceeding such limits, such acceptance shall not prevent  the  candidate
 from  being certified by the PCFB if the candidate in a reasonable time,
 as determined by rule, pays to the fund or returns  to  the  contributor
 the  portion  of  any contribution that exceeded the applicable contrib-
 ution limit.
  (ii) If the candidate is unable to return such funds in  a  reasonable
 time,  as  determined  by  rule,  because  they have already been spent,
 acceptance of contributions exceeding the limits shall not  prevent  the
 candidate  from  being certified by the PCFB if the candidate submits an
 affidavit agreeing to pay to the fund all portions of any  contributions
 that  exceeded  the  limit  no later than thirty days before the general
 election. If a candidate provides the PCFB with such an  affidavit,  any
 disbursement  of  public  funds  to the candidate shall be reduced by no
 more than twenty-five percent until the total amount owed by the  candi-
 date is repaid.
  (iii) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a candi-
 date  who  retains  funds  raised  during any previous election cycle to
 forfeit such funds. Funds raised during a previous election cycle may be
 retained and used by the candidate for the candidate's campaign  in  the
 next  election  cycle  but  funds  shall  not qualify for satisfying the
 threshold for participating  in  the  public  campaign  finance  program
 established  in this title nor shall they be eligible to be matched. The
 PCFB shall adopt regulations to ensure  that  contributions  that  would
 satisfy  the  applicable  contribution  limits  authorized in this title
 shall be transferred into the appropriate campaign account.
  (iv) Contributions received and expenditures made by the candidate  or
 an  authorized committee of the candidate prior to the effective date of
 this title shall not constitute a violation of  this  title.  Unexpended
 contributions  shall  be  treated  the  same as campaign surpluses under
 subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph.  Nothing  in  this  recommendation
 shall  be  construed to limit, in any way, any candidate or public offi-
 cial from expending any portion of pre-existing campaign funds  for  any
 lawful purpose other than those related to [his or her] SUCH CANDIDATE'S
 campaign.
  (v)  A  candidate  who  has raised matchable contributions but, in the
 case of a covered primary, general or special election, is  not  opposed
 by  another  candidate on the ballot who is not a write-in candidate, or
 who chooses not to accept matchable funds, may retain such contributions
 and apply them in  accord  with  this  title  to  the  candidate's  next
 campaign, should there be one, in the next election cycle.
  (VI)  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PUBLIC MATCHING FUNDS AVAILABLE TO A PARTIC-
 IPATING CANDIDATE  AND  SUCH  CANDIDATE'S  AUTHORIZED  COMMITTEE  FOR  A
 COVERED  GENERAL  ELECTION PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION 14-204

 fifty dollars of] any PORTION OF A contribution [of more than] WHEN  THE
 AGGREGATE  OF  CONTRIBUTIONS  ARE IN EXCESS OF two hundred fifty dollars
 FROM ANY ONE CONTRIBUTOR to a candidate or a candidate's committee which
 would otherwise be matchable except that it comes from a contributor who
 has contributed more than two hundred fifty dollars to such candidate or
 candidate's committee, [is deemed to be a  matchable  contribution  and]
 shall  NOT  count  toward  satisfying such monetary threshold [but shall
 not] OR otherwise be considered a matchable contribution.

 candidates  for state senate and state assembly, in such districts where

 public funds are sought, such minimum dollar threshold  for  eligibility
 shall  be  reduced  [by  one-third]  TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE
 SENATE AND SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE ASSEMBLY.  The PCFB  shall  make
 public  which  districts are subject to such reduction no later than two
 years before the first primary election for which funding is sought.

 district, while ensuring that the number of  audited  candidates  within
 those  districts  does  not  exceed  fifty  percent of all participating

 elections  shall  be weighted to increase the likelihood that a district
 for the relevant office is audited based on how frequently  it  has  not
 been  selected  for  auditing during the past three election cycles. The
 PCFB shall promulgate rules  concerning  the  method  of  weighting  the
 senate  and assembly lotteries, including provisions for the first three

 candidate  and  committee shall [use such surplus funds to reimburse the
 fund for payments received by such authorized committee  from  the  fund

 candidate's  authorized  committee;  provided, however, that all unspent
 public campaign funds for a participating candidate shall be immediately

 date may make post-election expenditures  with  public  funds  only  for
 routine  activities involving nominal [cost] COSTS associated with wind-
 ing up a campaign and responding to the post-election audit. Nothing  in
 this  title  shall  be  construed to prevent a candidate or [his or her]
 SUCH CANDIDATE'S authorized committee from using campaign  contributions
 received from private contributors for otherwise lawful expenditures.
