 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Investigations and Govern-
  ment Operations
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to providing  for  awards
  of attorney's fees in actions under the human rights law

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 10 of section 297  of  the  executive  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  154  of  the  laws  of 2022, is amended to read as
 follows:
  10. In an action or proceeding at law under this  section  or  section
 two  hundred ninety-eight of this article, the commissioner or the court
 [may in its discretion] SHALL award reasonable attorney's  fees  to  any
 prevailing or substantially prevailing [party; provided, however, that a
 prevailing  respondent  or defendant in order to recover such reasonable
 attorney's fees must make a motion requesting such fees  and  show  that
 the  action  or  proceeding  brought was frivolous; and further provided
 that in a proceeding brought  in  the  division  of  human  rights,  the
 commissioner  may  only  award  attorney's fees as part of a final order
 after a public  hearing  held  pursuant  to  subdivision  four  of  this
 section]  PLAINTIFF OR COMPLAINANT.  In no case shall attorney's fees be
 awarded to the division, nor shall the division be liable to a  prevail-
 ing  or  substantially prevailing party for attorney's fees, except in a
 case in which the division is a party to the action or the proceeding in
 the division's capacity as an employer.  Expert  witness  fees  may  be
 awarded  in  the  same manner as attorney's fees. In cases of employment
 discrimination, a respondent shall only be liable  for  attorney's  fees
 under  this  subdivision  if  the  respondent  has been found liable for
 having committed an unlawful discriminatory practice. [In order to  find
 the  action or proceeding to be frivolous, the court or the commissioner
 must find in writing one or more of the following:

 S. 5767  2

  (a) the action or proceeding was commenced, used or continued  in  bad
 faith, solely to delay or prolong the resolution of the litigation or to
 harass or maliciously injure another; or
  (b)  the  action or proceeding was commenced or continued in bad faith
 without any reasonable basis and could not be supported by a good  faith
 argument  for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. If
 the action or proceeding was promptly discontinued  when  the  party  or
 attorney  learned  or  should have learned that the action or proceeding
 lacked such a reasonable basis, the court may find that the party or the
 attorney did not act in bad faith.]
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
