  § 390-F. LIABILITY FOR CHATBOT RESPONSES. 1. AS USED IN  THIS  SECTION
 THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A)  "CHATBOT"  SHALL MEAN AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM, SOFTWARE

 SATION  AND  INTERACTION  THROUGH  TEXT  MESSAGES,  VOICE COMMANDS, OR A
 COMBINATION THEREOF TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND SERVICES TO USERS.
  (B) "PROPRIETOR" REFERS TO ANY PERSON,  BUSINESS,  COMPANY,  ORGANIZA-

 ACT WITH USERS. PROPRIETORS SHALL  NOT  INCLUDE  THIRD-PARTY  DEVELOPERS
 THAT LICENSE THEIR CHATBOT TECHNOLOGY TO A PROPRIETOR.

 REPRESENTATIVE, OR OTHERWISE AS AN AGENT OF THE  PROPRIETOR  TO  PROVIDE
 ANY  SUBSTANTIVE  RESPONSE,  INFORMATION, ADVICE, OR ACTION ON BEHALF OF
 THE PROPRIETOR MAY NOT DISCLAIM LIABILITY OF ANY KIND  WHERE  A  CHATBOT
 PROVIDES  MATERIALLY  MISLEADING,  INCORRECT,  CONTRADICTORY  OR HARMFUL
 INFORMATION TO A USER THAT RESULTS IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR OTHER DEMONSTRA-
 BLE HARM TO THE USER; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO SUCH LIABILITY SHALL BE
 IMPOSED WHERE THE PROPRIETOR HAS CORRECTED THE INFORMATION AND  SUBSTAN-
 TIALLY  OR  COMPLETELY  CURED THE HARM TO THE USER WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF
 NOTICE OF SUCH HARM.
  (B) THE PROPRIETOR OF A CHATBOT SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING SUCH

 CIES,  PRODUCT  DETAILS,  DISCLOSURES  AND  TERMS  OF SERVICE OFFERED TO
 USERS.

 NOTIFYING  CONSUMERS  THAT THEY ARE INTERACTING WITH A NON-HUMAN CHATBOT
 SYSTEM.
  3. PROPRIETORS UTILIZING CHATBOTS SHALL PROVIDE CLEAR, CONSPICUOUS AND
 EXPLICIT  NOTICE  TO  USERS THAT THEY ARE INTERACTING WITH AN ARTIFICIAL

 TEXT OF THE NOTICE SHALL APPEAR IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AND IN A SIZE EASI-
 LY  READABLE  BY THE AVERAGE VIEWER AND NO SMALLER THAN THE LARGEST FONT
 SIZE OF OTHER TEXT APPEARING ON THE WEBSITE  ON  WHICH  THE  CHATBOT  IS
