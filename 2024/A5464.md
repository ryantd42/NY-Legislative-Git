  § 3. Subdivision 3 of section 1263 of the public authorities  law,  as
 amended  by chapter 929 of the laws of 1986, paragraph (b) as amended by
 chapter 14 of the laws of 2006, is amended to read as follows:
  3.  [(a)]  A  majority of the whole number of members of the authority
 then in office shall constitute a quorum  for  the  transaction  of  any
 business or the exercise of any power of the authority. Except as other-
 wise specified in this title, for the transaction of any business or the
 exercise  of  any power of the authority, the authority shall have power
 to act by a majority vote of the members present at any meeting at which
 a quorum is in attendance and except further, that in the event of a tie
 vote the chairman shall cast one additional vote.
  [(b) For purposes of determining the presence of  a  quorum,  and  for
 purposes  of  participation  on  any  committee  or  subcommittee, those
 members who collectively cast a single vote pursuant to  the  provisions
 of  paragraph (a) of subdivision one of this section shall be considered
 to be a single member, and the presence of such member shall  be  deter-
 mined as provided in this subdivision. Except as otherwise provided in a
 by-law  adopted as hereinafter provided, such single member constituting
 those members entitled to a collective vote shall be deemed present as a
 single member for purposes of a quorum if one or  more  of  the  members
 then  in  office  entitled  to cast such collective vote is present, and
 such collective vote shall be  cast  in  accordance  with  the  majority
 agreement  of  the members entitled to a collective vote who are present
 or in the event a single member entitled to a collective vote is present
 it shall be cast by that member.  To  evidence  the  existence  of  such
 majority agreement among the members entitled to a collective vote, each
 such  member  shall  be  polled  as  to  his vote and such poll shall be
 recorded in the minutes. In the event a majority vote is not achieved by
 the members entitled to a collective vote who are present, then the vote
 shall not be cast. Nothing herein shall limit the right of an individual
 member to participate in board meetings or in other  activities  of  the
 authority when the other members then in office entitled to collectively
 cast  a  vote  are not present. At any meeting of the authority at which
 there is a quorum including all the members then in office  entitled  to
 cast  a  collective  vote,  the  authority may adopt a by-law or by-laws
 regulating the casting of such collective  vote,  provided  all  members
 then  in office entitled to cast a collective vote affirmatively approve
 such by-law or by-laws. Any action taken by the authority in  accordance
 with  any  such  by-law or by-laws adopted pursuant to the provisions of
 this paragraph shall take effect in the same manner as any other  action
 of  the  authority. Any such by-law or by-laws shall not provide for the
 casting of any fractional vote. Nor  shall  such  a  by-law  or  by-laws
 provide  for  the  amendment, repeal or adoption in the future of such a
 by-law or by-laws in a manner other than that set forth  in  this  para-
 graph.
  (c)  No provision of paragraph (b) of this subdivision relating to the
 adoption of certain by-laws by the authority shall affect the manner  in
 which  by-laws of the authority are adopted concerning any subject other
 than the voting and presence for quorum purposes of the members from the
 counties of Dutchess, Putnam, Orange and Rockland.
  (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of subdivision one
 of this section, any member  appointed  from  the  county  of  Dutchess,
 Orange,  Putnam  or  Rockland  prior  to  the  increase in the number of
 members of the authority to include a member from each such county shall
 continue in office as the member from such counties pursuant to  section
 five  of  the public officers law until the appointment and confirmation
 A. 5464  5

 of all of the new members from such counties pursuant to the  provisions
 of  this  section, and no individual member exercising a collective vote
 appointed and confirmed pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision one  of
 this  section shall take office until all such new members are appointed
 and confirmed.]
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately, provided that the  amend-
 ments  to  paragraph  (a) of subdivision 1 of section 1263 of the public
 authorities law made by section one of this act shall be subject to  the
 expiration  and  reversion  of such paragraph pursuant to chapter 549 of
 the laws of 1994, as amended, when upon  such  date  the  provisions  of
 section two of this act shall take effect.
