  COMMEMORATING the 75th Anniversary of Watkins Glen
  International of Watkins Glen, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Certain  organizations  empower communities to attract new
visitors while capitalizing on  local  commercial  and  cultural  value;
Watkins Glen International is one of those corporations that have had an
economic impact on their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
support events of significance which contribute to the entertainment and
vitality of the communities they serve and which exemplify  the  history
and development of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  75th  Anniversary  of  Watkins  Glen  International of
Watkins Glen, New York, which was celebrated in 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1948, Cameron Argetsinger  had  a  vision  to  introduce
European  road  racing  to  the  Village  of Watkins Glen, New York; the
Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) cooperated with the local  Chamber  of
Commerce and approved the Watkins Glen Grand Prix from 1948-1952; during
this  time,  drivers across the United States raced on a 6.6-mile course
on public roads; presently, that circuit is listed in the  Registers  of
Historic Places for New York State and the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  the safety of the public, the racing route moved to a
4.6-mile layout located outside Watkins Glen in 1953; three years later,
a permanent 2.35-mile circuit was constructed to accommodate auto  races
and  motorsports  events  from  1956-1970;  in  1971,  an  extensive
reconstruction of the  course  was  completed,  adding  the  boot-shaped
section; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  NASCAR  Cup  Series  utilized  this  historic  racing
facility in 1957, 1964, and 1965; since its return in 1986, it continues
to entertain crowds of fans; in  1983,  NASCAR  partnered  with  Corning
Enterprises  and  purchased  the  racetrack,  renaming  it  Watkins Glen
International;  the  objectives  were  an  increase  in  tourism  and
restoration of the historic landmark; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1997, International Speedway Corporation (ISC) acquired
the facility as the sole owner, investing millions of dollars to improve
its profitability by constructing new  grandstands,  the  Media  Center,
various  experiences  for the fans, and a complete repaving of the track
in 2015; in 2019, NASCAR acquired ISC; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the 75 years of its accommodations to excite  racing
fans,  Watkins Glen International has hosted NASCAR, International Motor
Sports Association (IMSA), Sports Car Club of America, Championship Auto
Racing Teams (CART), Can-Am, Trans Am, and INDYCAR; from  1961-1980,  it
was the home of the United States Formula One Grand Prix; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Auto  racing  legends  Mario  Andretti, Jeff Gordon, Derek
Bell, Nikki Lauda, Dale Earnhardt,  and  many  other  drivers  have  had
success at Watkins Glen International; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Two  natives  of  New  York  have claimed victories at the
facility; Geoff Bodine triumphed during the NASCAR Cup Series  event  in
1996,  and  Steve  Park  dominated Mark Martin to claim his first NASCAR
victory at "The Glen" in 2000; and
 
  WHEREAS, Watkins Glen International has been  chosen  as  "America's
Best  NASCAR  Track"  on four occasions; spectacular finishes, including
Chase Elliott's capture of his first NASCAR victory at the historic  and
famous  venue,  have amazed crowds; on September 15, 2024, the acclaimed
racetrack will participate in the NASCAR Cup Series by hosting a Playoff
race; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through numerous track  events,  including  IMSA  Sportscar
Championship,  Sports  Car  Club of America, United States Vintage Grand
Prix, NASCAR Cup Series Weekend, and the  Finger  Lakes  Wine  Festival,
Watkins  Glen  International provides a lucrative economic impact on the
Village of Watkins Glen and neighboring towns,  providing  entertainment
and  enjoyment  for  the  spectators  who  travel  nationally  and
internationally to witness exciting experiences that  will  thrill  fans
for generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend those organizations that have brought entertainment and cultural
enrichment to the citizens of the State of New York; now, therefore,  be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Watkins Glen International;  and  be
it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Watkins Glen International.
