 Introduced  by  Sen.  CANZONERI-FITZPATRICK  --  read  twice and ordered
  printed, and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to enacting
  "Bella's Law"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 "Bella's Law".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The  legislature  hereby  finds  that  animal
 cruelty  is  a  serious  problem and that individuals who harm and abuse
 animals are statistically more likely to engage in domestic violence and
 child abuse than individuals who do not harm and abuse animals. A strong
 correlation has been established linking individuals who  abuse  animals
 with  incidents of domestic violence. Therefore, the purpose of this law
 is to establish a requirement that the state of New York office of chil-
 dren and family services must investigate any individual who is  accused
 of or investigated for animal cruelty to ensure that there is no associ-
 ated  domestic  or  family  violence and that law enforcement notify and
 coordinate with the office of children and  family  services  in  animal
 cruelty investigations and arrests.
  §  3.  The  agriculture  and  markets  law  is amended by adding a new
 section 353-aa to read as follows:
  § 353-AA. ANIMAL ABUSE ACCUSAL REQUIRING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE
 INVESTIGATION. 1. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN THIS  SECTION,  THE  FOLLOWING
 TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A)  "ANIMAL"  SHALL MEAN ANY LIVE MAMMAL, BIRD, OR REPTILE, BUT SHALL
 NOT INCLUDE FEEDER ANIMALS.
