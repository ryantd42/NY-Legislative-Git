  HONORING  Past  Chief Dan Abrial upon the occasion
  of his designation for special recognition after  50
  years  of  dedicated  service to the Otter Lake Fire
  Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Past  Chief
Dan Abrial, upon the occasion of his designation for special recognition
after  50  years of dedicated service to the Otter Lake Fire Department,
which was celebrated at its Annual Installation Dinner at the  firehouse
on Saturday, May 18, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dan  Abrial  has  consistently  demonstrated  a  level  of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity,  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; for this dedication, he
was  given  an  award  and  life  membership  with  the  Otter Lake Fire
Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others,  and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Dan  Abrial  is  such  a  firefighter;  throughout  his years of devoted
service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the  call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Past  Chief  Dan  Abrial upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition after 50 years of dedicated  service  to  the  Otter
Lake Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Past Chief Dan Abrial.
