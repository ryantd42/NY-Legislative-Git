  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 17-23, 2024, as Constitution Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  On  September 17, 1787, the United States Constitution was
signed  by  55  delegates  to  the  Constitutional  Convention  in
Philadelphia's  Independence  Hall;  by  joint resolution of Congress on
August 2, 1956, the President may proclaim the week beginning  September
17 and ending September 23 of each year as "Constitution Week"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  "We  the  people  of the United States, in order to form a
more perfect Union,  establish  Justice,  insure  domestic  Tranquility,
provide  for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure
the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do  ordain  and
establish  this  Constitution  for  the  United  States of America"; our
Forefathers laid the foundations for a great Nation  with  these  words,
written  more than 200 years ago, adopting a Constitution that has since
proven to be an enduring and true guide for American government; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States Constitution is a powerful framework  for
establishing  and  preserving  liberty, justice, and opportunity; it has
enabled us to prosper as a Nation and thrive as a  people  through  more
than  two  centuries  of  political  change,  social transformation, and
economic challenge; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Founders of our great  Nation  secured  the  principles
expressed  in  the  Declaration  of  Independence  by  establishing  a
government that derives its power  from  the  consent  of  the  American
people;  the  government  established  by  the  Constitution  formed  a
remarkably  resilient  structure,  balancing  necessary  authority  with
inherent  freedoms,  national  unity with individual rights, and Federal
interests with State powers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, in structuring the Constitution, the  Founders
also  recognized  the  potential  for  necessary  change  and included a
constitutional amendment process, which  has  proven  to  be  a  vitally
important  mechanism  for  achieving  equality  and fairness for all our
citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the United States stands as a  beacon  of  democracy
and  tolerance,  inviting  the  nations  of the world to pursue justice,
provide freedom, and protect liberty for their people; drawing  strength
and guidance from the Constitution, the people of the United States work
to  ensure  that the blessings of American liberty endure and extend for
generations to come and remain resolved and vigilant in the  defense  of
life and liberty against tyranny and terror; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  New  York State Legislature affirms its commitment to
exercise a leadership  role  in  urging  all  its  citizens  to  support
Constitution  Week  in  the  State  of  New York in conjunction with the
observance of National Constitution Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  most  appropriate  that  this  great  Empire  State
recognizes  the  worthy  and  beneficial  purposes  of  celebrating
Constitution Week in the State of New York in conjunction with  National
Constitution Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to call attention
to events that serve to bring people together for the united purpose  of
actively  pursuing improvements in their communities; now, therefore, he
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September 17-23, 2024, as
Constitution Week in the State of New York in conjunction with  National
Constitution Week; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
