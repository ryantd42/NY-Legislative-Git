  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2024, as Endometriosis Awareness Month in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2024,  as
Endometriosis Awareness Month in the State of New York,  in  conjunction
with the observance of National Endometriosis Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Endometriosis  is  a  disease  of  the female reproductive
system; it occurs when tissue similar to  that  normally  found  in  the
uterus  begins  to  grow  outside  of  the  uterus,  leading to chronic,
debilitating pelvic pain; and
 
  WHEREAS, Endometriosis affects an estimated 1  in  10  women  during
their reproductive years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  leading  cause of female infertility, Endometriosis may
affect more than 11% of American women between the ages  of  15  and  44
which is approximately 176 million women in the world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  especially common among women in their 30s and 40s
and may make it harder to  get  pregnant;  several  different  treatment
options  can help manage the symptoms and improve the chances of getting
pregnant; and
 
  WHEREAS, There is an average of a 10-year delay from  the  onset  of
symptoms to the final diagnosis of Endometriosis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  51  percent  of  Endometriosis  patients report that their
disease detrimentally affects their job; women  with  Endometriosis  can
lose  11  hours  per work week through lost productivity and absenteeism
due to pain; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  is  no  cure  for  Endometriosis;  traditionally,
providers  have  focused  on  managing  the  associated  pain  with oral
contraceptives,  progestins,  danazol,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory
drugs  (NSAIDs),  opioids,  and  GnRH  agonists,  many  of which are not
specifically indicated for the treatment of Endometriosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, In more extensive cases,  surgical  interventions  such  as
laparotomy or laparoscopy are often pursued, and may not be curative for
all individuals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Endometriosis Awareness Month aims to raise awareness about
this  hidden  and  often  unrecognized  condition by promoting a greater
understanding of endometriosis as a  real,  debilitating  and  disabling
disease; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious disease, and more must be  done  to  increase  activity  at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2024,  as
Endometriosis  Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
