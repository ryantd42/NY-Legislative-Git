 AN ACT  to  amend  the  public  health  law,  in  relation  to  limiting
  exemptions  from  immunizations;  and  to repeal certain provisions of

  students

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The public health law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 2164-a to read as follows:
  §  2164-A. IMMUNIZATION EXEMPTIONS. NO ORGANIZATION OR ENTITY, INCLUD-
 ING A LOCAL GOVERNMENT,  SCHOOL  BOARD,  BUSINESS,  OR  EMPLOYER,  WHICH
 REQUIRES  IMMUNIZATION  AGAINST  ANY  DISEASE SHALL PERMIT ANY EXEMPTION
 FROM SUCH REQUIREMENT EXCEPT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION.  ANY  PROVISION  OF  A
 LAW, RULE, REGULATION, OR POLICY ADOPTED BY ANY ENTITY THAT ALLOWS FOR A
 NON-MEDICAL  EXEMPTION  TO  AN  IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENT SHALL BE DEEMED
 NULL AND VOID. A MEDICAL EXEMPTION SHALL  BE  ESTABLISHED  IN  THE  SAME
 MANNER  AS  SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION EIGHT OF SECTION TWENTY-ONE HUNDRED
 SIXTY-FOUR OF THIS TITLE.
  § 2. Subdivision 9 of  section  2165  of  the  public  health  law  is
 REPEALED.
  §  3.  Severability.  If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision,
 section or part of this title shall be adjudged by any court  of  compe-
 tent  jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair
 or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its opera-
 tion to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision,  section  or  part
 thereof  directly  involved  in  the  controversy in which such judgment
 shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared the intent of the legis-
 lature that this act would  have  been  enacted  even  if  such  invalid
 provisions had not been included herein.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
