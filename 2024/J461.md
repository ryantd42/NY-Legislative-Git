  HONORING  ex-Chief  Gregory  Weisburd  upon  the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  many  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
  Manhasset-Lakeville Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly  proud  to  honor  ex-Chief
Gregory  Weisburd  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation for special
recognition  after  many  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
Manhasset-Lakeville  Fire  Department  to  be  celebrated  at its Annual
Awards Night on Thursday, April  6,  2023,  at  the  Manhasset-Lakeville
Company 5 Firehouse in New Hyde Park, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Gregory  Weisburd has consistently demonstrated a level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Gregory Weisburd is such a firefighter; throughout his years of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor ex-Chief Gregory Weisburd upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition  after  many  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
Manhasset-Lakeville Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to ex-Chief Gregory Weisburd.
