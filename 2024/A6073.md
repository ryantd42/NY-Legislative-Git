 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  family  court act, in relation to modifying the
  existing exemption from what constitutes prima facie evidence of child
  neglect where a parent  or  guardian  voluntarily  participates  in  a
  recognized rehabilitative program

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (i)  of  subdivision  (f)  of
 section  1012  of the family court act, as amended by chapter 984 of the
 laws of 1981, is amended to read as follows:
  (B) in providing the child with proper supervision or guardianship, by
 unreasonably inflicting or allowing to be inflicted harm, or a  substan-
 tial  risk  thereof,  including  the  infliction  of  excessive corporal
 punishment; or by misusing a drug or drugs;  or  by  misusing  alcoholic
 beverages to the extent that he loses self-control of his actions; or by
 any  other  acts  of a similarly serious nature requiring the aid of the
 court; provided, however, that where the respondent [is] HAS voluntarily
 [and regularly participating] PARTICIPATED in AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED
 a RECOGNIZED rehabilitative program AND HAS  BEEN  VERIFIABLY  REHABILI-
 TATED  FOR  AN UNINTERRUPTED PERIOD OF ONE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE
 HEARING DATE, evidence that the respondent has repeatedly misused a drug
 or drugs or alcoholic beverages to the extent that he loses self-control
 of his actions shall not establish that the child is a  neglected  child
 in  the  absence  of  evidence  establishing  that the child's physical,
 mental or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger
 of becoming impaired as set forth in THIS paragraph [(i) of this  subdi-
 vision]; or
  §  2. Paragraph (iii) of subdivision (a) of section 1046 of the family
 court act, as amended by chapter 92 of the laws of 2021, is  amended  to
 read as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  (iii)  proof that a person repeatedly misuses a drug or drugs or alco-
 holic beverages, to the extent that it has or would ordinarily have  the
 effect  of  producing in the user thereof a substantial state of stupor,
 unconsciousness, intoxication, hallucination, disorientation, or  incom-
 petence,  or  a  substantial  impairment  of  judgment, or a substantial
 manifestation of irrationality, shall be prima  facie  evidence  that  a
 child  of  or  who  is  the  legal  responsibility  of  such person is a
 neglected child except that such  drug,  or  alcoholic  beverage  misuse
 shall  not  be prima facie evidence of neglect when such person [is] HAS
 voluntarily [and regularly participating] PARTICIPATED in  AND  SUCCESS-
 FULLY COMPLETED a recognized rehabilitative program AND HAS BEEN VERIFI-
 ABLY  REHABILITATED  FOR AN UNINTERRUPTED PERIOD OF ONE YEAR IMMEDIATELY
 PRIOR TO THE HEARING DATE. Provided however, the sole fact that an indi-
 vidual consumes cannabis, without a separate finding  that  the  child's
 physical,  mental  or emotional condition was impaired or is in imminent
 danger of becoming impaired established by a fair preponderance  of  the
 evidence  shall  not  be sufficient to establish prima facie evidence of
 neglect; and
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
