 major repair or renovation of real property  and  improvements  thereon,

 contractor that a contracting agency has violated such provisions or has
 failed or refused to issue a waiver  where  one  has  been  applied  for
 pursuant  to  subdivision  six of section three hundred thirteen of this
 article or has denied such application, the director  shall  attempt  to
 resolve  the matter giving rise to such complaint. If efforts to resolve
 such matter to the satisfaction of all  parties  are  unsuccessful,  the
 director  shall  refer  the matter, within thirty days of the receipt of
 the complaint, to the division's hearing officers.  Upon  conclusion  of
 the  administrative  hearing,  the  hearing  officer shall submit to the
 S. 5464  9
 
 director his or her decision regarding  the  alleged  violation  of  the
 contract  and  recommendations  regarding  the  imposition of sanctions,

 contract may include a determination that the contractor shall be ineli-
 gible to submit a bid to any contracting agency or be awarded  any  such
 contract  for a period not to exceed one year following the final deter-
 mination; provided however, if a contractor has previously  been  deter-
 mined  to  be  ineligible  to submit a bid pursuant to this section, the
 penalties imposed for any subsequent violation, if such violation occurs
 within five years of the first violation, may  include  a  determination
 that the contractor shall be ineligible to submit a bid to any contract-
 ing  agency  or  be awarded any such contract for a period not to exceed
 five years following the final determination. The division  of  minority

 contractors that have been deemed ineligible to submit a bid pursuant to
 this section and the date after which each contractor shall  once  again
 become eligible to submit bids.
  [2.] 3. Any fines, or portion thereof, imposed pursuant to the forego-
 ing subdivision, or imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction related
 to  convictions  involving  fraud  related  to this article or otherwise
 involving a minority or women-owned business enterprise, may be required

 moneys due to all persons furnishing labor or materials to the  contrac-
 tor or any subcontractors in the prosecution of the work provided for in

 to  compliance  with  section  two hundred twenty of the labor law, such
 permittee or its contractor or subcontractors furnishing  workers  shall
 post a payment bond subject to this section. Provided, however, that all
 performance  bonds  and payment bonds may, at the discretion of the head
 of the state agency, public benefit corporation or commission, or his or
 her designee, be dispensed with for the completion of a  work  specified
 in  a contract for the prosecution of a public improvement for the state
 of New York for which bids are solicited where the aggregate  amount  of
 the  contract  is  under one hundred FIFTY thousand dollars and provided
 further, that in a case where the contract is not subject to the  multi-
 ple  contract  award  requirements of section one hundred thirty-five of
 this article, such requirements may be dispensed with where the head  of
 the  state  agency, public benefit corporation or commission finds it to
 be in the public interest and where the aggregate amount of the contract
 awarded or to be awarded is less than two hundred thousand dollars.  THE
 HEAD  OF  THE STATE AGENCY, PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION OR COMMISSION, OR
 HIS OR HER DESIGNEE, SHALL ADJUST THE AGGREGATE CONTRACT AMOUNTS  LISTED
 IN  THIS SUBDIVISION EVERY YEAR TO ACCOUNT FOR INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF
 CONSTRUCTION. ADVERTISEMENTS FOR BIDS SHALL PROVIDE INFORMATION  ON  THE
 REQUIREMENTS  FOR,  OR  DISPENSATION  OF, PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS.
 Provided further, that in a case where a performance or payment bond  is
 dispensed  with,  twenty  per  centum may be retained from each progress
 payment or estimate until the entire contract work  has  been  completed
 and accepted, at which time the head of the state agency, public benefit
 corporation  or commission shall, pending the payment of the final esti-
 mate, pay not to exceed seventy-five per centum of  the  amount  of  the
 retained percentage.

 state  agency  or  corporation  described  in  subdivision one-a of this
 section and the aggregate amount  of  the  contract  awarded  or  to  be
 awarded  is  under  fifty  thousand  dollars  and,  in  a case where the
 contract is not subject to the multiple contract award  requirements  of
 section  one  hundred thirty-five of this article, such requirements may
 be dispensed with where the head of  the  state  agency  or  corporation
 finds  it to be in the public interest and where the aggregate amount of
 the contract awarded or to be awarded is under [two] THREE hundred thou-
 sand dollars.  THE HEAD OF THE STATE AGENCY, PUBLIC BENEFIT  CORPORATION
 OR  COMMISSION,  OR  HIS  OR  HER  DESIGNEE,  SHALL ADJUST THE AGGREGATE
 CONTRACT AMOUNTS LISTED IN THIS SUBDIVISION EVERY YEAR  TO  ACCOUNT  FOR
 INCREASES  IN  THE  COSTS OF CONSTRUCTION. ADVERTISEMENTS FOR BIDS SHALL
 PROVIDE  INFORMATION  ON  THE  REQUIREMENTS  FOR,  OR  DISPENSATION  OF,
 PERFORMANCE  AND PAYMENT BONDS. Provided further, that in a case where a
 performance or payment bond is dispensed with, twenty per centum may  be
 retained  from  each  progress  payment  or  estimate  until  the entire
 contract work has been completed and accepted, at which time the head of
 the state agency or corporation shall, pending the payment of the  final
 S. 5464  11
