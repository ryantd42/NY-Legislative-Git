 Introduced by M. of A. FORREST, BURDICK, GALLAGHER, MAMDANI, SHRESTHA --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Correction
 
 AN  ACT to amend the correction law, in relation to the rights of people
  in prisons, jails, and forensic facilities
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "rights behind bars; protecting the rights  of  people  in  prisons,
 jails,  and forensic facilities, and their loved ones, in New York state
 act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares:
  A. Incarcerated individuals, their families, and loved ones have human
 rights.  The legislature finds that New York's prisons and jails system-
 atically fail to recognize and protect the human rights of  incarcerated
 individuals,  their  families, and their loved ones. While some of these
 rights are protected by the law and constitution of New York State,  and
 the  law  and  constitution  of the United States, it is well-documented
 that the rights protected under existing law are often not recognized in
 practice and that there are gaps in existing law.  The intent  of  this
 act  is  to:  (i) make clear some of the rights that already exist under
 New York law but are not being consistently followed, (ii) close some of
 the gaps in existing law, and (iii) enshrine into  New  York  State  law
 some  of  the well-established principles and obligations under interna-
 tional human rights law.
  B. Numerous recent studies, reports, and court  decisions  have  docu-
 mented  systemic,  widespread, and persistent human rights violations in
 New York's correctional facilities. These include: NYS Inspector General
 Lucy Lang, RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF DISCIPLINE IN NEW
 YORK STATE PRISONS, November 2022; Neff, Santo, and Meagher, HOW A 'BLUE

 issued  by  Court-appointed Monitor as part of the settlement of a class
 action lawsuit relating to conditions in NYC  jails  on  Rikers  Island,
 starting in 2016 and continuing to the present); and Post-Visit Briefing
 Reports  issued periodically by the Correctional Association of New York
 ("CANY") pursuant to their statutory  authority  to  conduct  monitoring
 visits  in  NYS  prisons  (Nine Post-Visit Briefings were issued by CANY
 from June 2021 through December 2022. Among  the  findings  during  this
 period  were  that  45% of incarcerated individuals interviewed reported
 witnessing or experiencing verbal, physical, or sexual abuse  by  prison
 staff,  and  36% reported witnessing or experiencing racialized abuse by
 prison staff.).
  C. Some of the human rights of incarcerated individuals  in  New  York
 State  are  protected  by provisions in the New York State Constitution,
 including, Article I, sections 5 (prohibiting cruel and unusual  punish-
 ment),  6 (right to due process), 8 (right to speak freely), 11 (guaran-
 teeing equal protection of the laws), and 12  (prohibiting  unreasonable
 searches  and  seizures);  the United States Constitution, including the
 1st Amendment (free speech), 4th Amendment (prohibition of  unreasonable
 searches  and seizures), 8th Amendment (prohibition of cruel and unusual
 punishments), and 14th Amendment (guaranteeing equal protection  of  the
 law  and due process of law).  However, these provisions and laws do not
 go far enough to protect the rights of people incarcerated in New  York.
 The  intent  of  this  act, in part, is to incorporate into New York law
 additional human rights protections for incarcerated people as enshrined
 in key documents included in the body of international human rights law,
 including, the United Nations Declaration of Human  Rights,  recognizing
 basic  human  rights  applicable to all people, including, in Article 5,
 the right not to be subjected  to  torture  or  to  cruel,  inhuman,  or
 degrading  treatment  or punishment; the International Covenant of Civil
 and Political Rights, including Article 7 (No one shall be subjected  to
 torture  or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), and
 Article 10 (All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated  with
 humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person);
 the  Basic  Principles  for the Treatment of Prisoners (General Assembly
 Resolution 45/111); the Convention  Against  Torture  and  Other  Cruel,
 Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the United Nations Stand-
 ard  Minimum  Rules  for  the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela
 Rules); and other applicable and  binding  principles  of  international
 human rights law.
  D.  The  fundamental approach of international human rights law to the
 treatment of people in prison is expressed in  Rule  3  of  the  Mandela
 Rules,  which  recognizes  that  "imprisonment  and  other measures that
 result in cutting off persons from the outside world are  afflictive  by
 the  very fact of taking from these persons the right of self-determina-
 A. 8364  3
 
 tion by depriving them of their liberty.  Therefore  the  prison  system
 shall not, except as incidental to justifiable separation or the mainte-
 nance  of  discipline,  aggravate the suffering inherent in such a situ-
 ation."  In  turn,  Rule  4  requires that incarceration must be used to
 "ensure the reintegration of such persons into society upon  release  so
 that  they  can  lead a law-abiding and self-supporting life" and Rule 5
 thus requires prisons and jails to  "minimize  any  differences  between
 prison  life  and life at liberty that tend to lessen the responsibility
 of the {incarcerated people} or the respect  due  to  their  dignity  as
 human beings."
  To  effectuate  these  rights,  the Mandela Rules require, among other
 protections, that incarcerated people be allowed  regular  communication
 with  their  family  and  friends,  including through visits and through
 writing, telecommunication, electronic means, and  digital  means  (Rule
 58.1),  that people in prison have a right to "food of nutritional value
 adequate for health and strength, of wholesome quality and well prepared
 and served", and that any use of force against an incarcerated  individ-
 ual  be "no more than is strictly necessary" (Rule 82). They also estab-
 lish basic rights  related  to  access  to  programming  and  treatment,
 connections  to  community  entities,  and  restrictions  on  the use of
 restraints.
  E. In keeping with these legislative findings, this act aims to clear-
 ly recognize  and  establish  the  broad  human  rights  framework  that
 protects  all  incarcerated  individuals  in  New  York  State. This act
 specifically addresses certain issues that have arisen in New York pris-
 ons and jails in recent years.  That has included:  violations  of  the
 HALT  Solitary  Confinement  Law;  restrictions on packages, visits, and
 mail; staff abuse and brutality; and denials of other basic rights.
  In regard to some of these issues, the law is already clear,  but  New
 York's prisons and jails are not consistently following it. For example,
 despite  clarity  concerning  who  qualifies  as disabled under the HALT
 Solitary Confinement Law, and who, therefore, cannot be placed in segre-
 gated confinement, the  NYS  Department  of  Corrections  and  Community
 Supervision  has  consistently placed people with disabilities in segre-
 gated confinement. The intent of the  amendments  to  paragraph  (c)  of
 subdivision  33  of section 2 of the correction law made by section five
 of this act is not to define disability, which is already  in  the  law,
 but rather to make clear via examples what is already required. Similar-
 ly,  while the correction law is already clear that people facing possi-
 ble placement in segregated confinement or facing Tier III tickets  must
 have access to meaningful representation, including by any lawyer or law
 student;  that  hearing officers must conduct individualized assessments
 of the fact to determine if the allegations meet the threshold  require-
 ments  for placement in segregated confinement or alternatives; and that
 people in alternative disciplinary units must have access to out-of-cell
 time in group settings, access to core programs available in the general
 population; and a presumption against the use of  restraints  unless  an
 individualized determination is made finding a significant and unreason-
 able risk, prisons and jails are not complying with these provisions and
 so this act reiterates and clarifies these requirements.
  This  act  is not intended as an all-inclusive compendium of the human
 rights protections afforded to people in jail or prison  under  interna-
 tional  law,  as  the  intent is to correct and clarify certain specific
 rights  within  the  overall  human  rights  framework.  Among  other
 protections,  this  act aims to ensure that people have a right to visit
 with their loved ones, to have regular communication  with  their  loved
 A. 8364  4
 
 ones,  to receive care packages from their loved ones, to have access to
 healthy and nutritious food, to be free from staff brutality and retali-
 ation, to be free from the torture of  prolonged  solitary  confinement,
 and  to have access to real and meaningful out-of-cell group programming
 and engagement. Recognition of these basic human rights  will  alleviate
 suffering of incarcerated individuals, strengthen ties with families and
 communities, better prepare people for release, increase safety in pris-
 ons and jails and in outside communities, and unequivocally establish as
 the  policy  of  the  State  of  New York that brutality, racism, sexual
 abuse, harassment, and denials of access to family and loved  ones  have
 no place in New York's jails and prisons and will not be tolerated.
  §  3.  Section 2 of the correction law is amended by adding eleven new
