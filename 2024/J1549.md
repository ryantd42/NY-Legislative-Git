  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2024, as Alopecia Areata  Awareness  Month
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
official months established to  increase  awareness  of  serious  health
issues that affect the lives of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim September  2024,  as  Alopecia  Areata
Awareness  Month  in  the  State  of  New  York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Alopecia Areata Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Alopecia Areata affects as many as 6.8  million  people  in
America  and  causes  hair  loss  which  can range from patches of hair,
typically circular and coin-size, to complete hair loss, otherwise known
as Alopecia Totalis; and
 
  WHEREAS, While there is no known cause for this autoimmune  disease,
several  factors  seem  to  contribute;  some evidence shows genes which
control T regulator cells  may  be  involved  in  Alopecia  Areata,  and
patients  who  have  other  autoimmune  diseases  like  autoimmune
polyglandular syndrome (APS) or autoimmune thyroid disease  (AITD),  may
be predictive of poor outcomes with treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Although  there is no known cure, it is generally possible
for Alopecia Areata patients to regrow hair because the hair follicle is
not totally destroyed or scarred as it is  with  cicatricial  (scarring)
alopecias; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bringing  awareness  to  this  disease is designed to help
those experiencing hair loss  remain  confident  and  positive,  despite
their  condition;  hair  loss  often  carries  a stigma that can only be
dispelled with education and knowledge, and for many with this  disease,
the  emotional  aspect  of  living  with  hair  loss can be the greatest
challenge; and
 
  WHEREAS, During the month  of  September,  many  communities  across
America  will  be  holding  special  events  to  bring awareness to this
disease, and minor and  major  league  baseball  teams  have  joined  in
helping NAAF get the word out that it is nothing to be ashamed of; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National Institutes of Health and other organizations
are continuously supporting research that may one day put an end to this
disease; currently, researchers are studying  the  development  of  hair
follicles in hopes of finding treatments which will address the cause of
this  disease,  and  investigating  genetic  clues  with  the  hopes  of
developing therapies and early intervention strategies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fortunately, Alopecia  Areata  is  not  a  life-threatening
illness,  nor  does  it  cause  any  pain; it is not contagious and most
people with this disease are generally healthy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Alopecia Areata does not interfere with life  or  long-term
plans  and,  while  the  course  of  the disease varies and is generally
unpredictable, hair often regrows; there are treatments which  can  help
restart  hair  regrowth,  and  hair  replacement  can ease the emotional
struggles for those who have less than optimal regrowth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body is aware of the impact that Alopecia
Areata can have on people living with the disorder, and  recognizes  the
need  for  enhanced  public awareness, as well as supports the goals and
ideals of Alopecia Areata Awareness Month, as designated by the National
Alopecia Areata Foundation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2024,  as
Alopecia Areata Awareness Month in the State of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
