BY: M. of A. Jones
 
  CONGRATULATING  Jim  McKenna,  CEO of the Regional
  Office of Sustainable Tourism, upon the occasion  of
  his  retirement  after  more  than  40  years  of
  distinguished service at the helm of  various  local
  tourism councils and offices
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
honor those distinguished citizens of this great Empire State  who  have
devoted  themselves  to  faithfully  serving the best interests of their
community and the needs of its residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to

Tourism, upon the occasion of his retirement after more than 40 years of
distinguished  service at the helm of various local tourism councils and
offices; and
 
  WHEREAS, Born in New York City,  Jim  McKenna,  72,  graduated  from
Mount  Assumption High School in Plattsburgh in 1970 and, after college,
moved to Lake Placid to operate Newman Opera House, a country, rock  and
blues club, with a college friend; they sold the club in 1979; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jim McKenna first pitched the Lake Placid Convention Bureau
to the North Elba Town Council in the fall of 1981, as a way to maintain
the  village's  tourism  momentum  following the end of the 1980 Olympic
Winter Games; the following year, the bureau was given  $35,000  by  the
town and he was hired as one if its two employees; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Approximately  five  years  later,  the  convention bureau
combined with the Lake Placid Chamber of Commerce  to  create  the  Lake
Placid  Visitors  Bureau,  which  then turned into the Lake Placid-Essex
County Visitors Bureau in 1990; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this time, in addition to being  in  charge  of  the
bureau,  Jim  McKenna  served  on  many of the major boards in the area,
giving him profound knowledge and a chance  to  network  throughout  the
county;  he  subsequently  became  a  big force not only in Lake Placid,
North Elba, Essex County, and the State of New York,  but  also  in  the
international sports community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2010, the bureau renamed itself as the Regional Office
of Sustainable Tourism (ROOST)  to  signal  its  commitment  to  tourism
across  the  region,  not  just  Lake  Placid,  as well as its new-found
emphasis on sustainable tourism and its community-first approach; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the able leadership of Jim McKenna, ROOST focused  on
building  up  the  region  for  its  year-round  occupants  and avoiding
overcrowding,  while  still  making  the  economy  and  infrastructure
conducive to tourism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  most  prominent  component of Jim McKenna's community
support in recent years has been  his  advocacy  for  Community  Tourism
 
Enhancement  Funds;  one  of  his major visionary accomplishments is the
development of the occupancy tax as a dedicated revenue stream  to  fund
these vital initiatives; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  by  transferring  responsibility  for  these
expenses from local taxpayers to visitors, Jim McKenna ensured  a  level
of  financial  stability  that was necessary for Essex County's success,
and he paved the way for other important initiatives, including the CTEF
which has supported community betterment projects necessary for  tourism
growth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jim McKenna was also instrumental in the creation of North
Elba's Local Enhancement and Enhancement Fund grants,  which  help  fund
local  organizations  such  as  the  Adirondack Film Society, John Brown
Lives! and the Adirondack Sports Council, where he is  the  chairman  of
the board of directors; under Jim's direction, ROOST received a New York
State  Tourism  Excellence Award for its work with CTEF in July of 2023;
and
 
  WHEREAS, For decades, Jim McKenna has been the face  and  voice  for
Adirondack  tourism;  he  has  been  instrumental  in  supporting  and
preserving the region's winter sports legacy, and  promoting  the  areas
incredible  year-round events and attractions that welcome visitors from
around the world; he spearheaded the Adirondack  Sports  Council,  which
organized the 2023 FISU Winter World University Games; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  his  dedication and tireless efforts, Jim McKenna
has helped make Lake Placid and its surrounding community a place  where
families  want  to  live, tourists want to visit, and businesses want to
locate; his unwavering  commitment,  as  well  as  his  willingness  and
ability  to  understand  and respond to the concerns of its people, have
made a substantial contribution to the betterment of this community; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than 40  years,  Jim  McKenna  rendered  faithful,
conscientious  and  valuable service to his community, truly earning the
admiration, esteem and affection of his colleagues; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare indeed is  the  occurrence  of  such  a  compassionate
blending  of  strength,  leadership,  intellect,  and commitment as that
demonstrated by Jim McKenna over a lifetime of sacrifice and  dedication
to others; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Jim McKenna upon the occasion of  his  retirement,  and  to
wish him well in all his future endeavors; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
