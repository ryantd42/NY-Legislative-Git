 PROVIDED THAT THE LIFETIME CREDIT ALLOWABLE WITH REGARD TO  EXPENDITURES
 FOR  THE INSTALLATION OF QUALIFIED IMPROVEMENTS AT A PARTICULAR DWELLING

 FOR  IMPROVEMENTS  MADE  TO  THAT DWELLING. SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
 THIS SUBSECTION, A TAXPAYER SHALL BE ALLOWED A  CREDIT,  NOT  TO  EXCEED

 THE DWELLING AS HIS OR HER PRIMARY RESIDENCE.

 TWO  OR  MORE PERSONS, OTHER THAN A HUSBAND AND WIFE, THE PORTION OF THE
 TOTAL EXPENDITURES MADE IN THE REHABILITATION OF THE  BUILDING  THAT  IS
 ATTRIBUTABLE  TO EACH TAXPAYER SHALL BE EQUAL TO THE TAXPAYER'S SHARE OF
