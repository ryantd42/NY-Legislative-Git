  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2024, as Kidney Disease Awareness Month in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  2024,  as  Kidney  Disease
Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Kidney Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD)  is a major health problem
affecting millions of New Yorkers and an  estimated  37  million  people
nationwide; and
 
  WHEREAS, CKD is a progressive condition in which kidneys do not work
as  well  as  they  should to filter waste, toxins, and fluids from your
body; and
 
  WHEREAS, CKD can progress quickly or take years to  worsen,  and  is
described  as having five stages, and progression through each stage can
eventually lead to kidney failure, also known as End Stage Renal Disease
(ESRD), which can be treated with a kidney replacement or dialysis; and
 
  WHEREAS, The incidence of  ESRD  is  rising  fast,  with  more  than
556,000  Americans currently receiving treatment and 251,988 people with
functioning kidney transplants; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, 7,926 New Yorkers  are  on  the  transplant  waiting
list; New York State encourages all to join the State's tissue and organ
donation registry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due  to  the fact that there are little to no signs of the
condition, most individuals are not aware they have kidney disease until
it reaches the later stages, thus making laboratory  tests  critical  in
the  diagnosis;  some  symptoms of CKD can include changes in urination,
swelling of the feet, ankles, hands,  and/or  face,  fatigue,  weakness,
shortness  of  breath,  ammonia  breath  or ammonia or metallic taste in
mouth, back or flank pain, itching, loss of appetite, nausea,  vomiting,
and if diabetic, more hypoglycemic episodes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tragically, in 2021, more than 127,000 Americans died from
end stage kidney disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are genetic factors that can increase an individual's
risk for kidney disease, and one such genetic factor is having  variants
(mutations) in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene; and
 
  WHEREAS,  People are more likely to have APOL1 gene variants if they
are from Western or Central Africa or have an  ancestor  who  came  from
these  regions,  and  these  variants  can  increase  susceptibility for
APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease (AMKD),  a  rapidly  progressive  form  of
kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Diabetes  and  hypertension  are the two leading causes of
chronic kidney disease which strikes minorities disproportionately; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kidney  failure has a disproportionate impact on people of
color; compared to White Americans, the likelihood of developing  kidney
failure  is 4.3 times greater for Black Americans, 2.3 times greater for
American Indians, 2.2 times greater for Latino and  Hispanic  Americans,
and 1.6 times greater for Asian Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Also  at particular risk are the elderly, as the chance of
developing kidney disease increases significantly  with  age;  in  2020,
older  adults with CKD died at a rate three times that of people without
CKD; and
 
  WHEREAS, People afflicted  with  chronic  kidney  disease  typically
develop  other  chronic  and  life-threatening  conditions  such  as
cardiovascular disease; and
 
  WHEREAS, Early intervention is the  best  method  for  managing  the
complications of chronic kidney disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The American Kidney Fund works on behalf of the 37 million
Americans living with kidney disease, and the millions more at risk,  to
support  people  wherever they are in their fight against kidney disease
from prevention through post-transplant living; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Northeast  Kidney  Foundation  provides  early
intervention,  community  education  and  support  programs  for  those
suffering from chronic kidney disease; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 2024, as Kidney
Disease Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
