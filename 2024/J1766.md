  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 2024, as Teach CTE Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, The State of New York takes great pride in participating in
days  and  months  of  awareness  for  important community and education
issues; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is also the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize
the  dedication  and  commitment  of  our  educators  who  distinguish
themselves  through  excellence  in  teaching and to encourage others to
pursue the field of education to continue to best support student growth
and the needs  of  future  learners,  contribute  to  the  expansion  of
opportunities  and to promote program development aligned with workforce
trends; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
recognize and to memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  February
2024,  as  Teach  CTE  Month  in  the State of New York, recognizing the
contributions and the importance of the field of  Career  and  Technical
Education for students, educators and industry partners; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  investment  is  needed  to scale and grow Career and
Technical Education (CTE) programs  across  the  state  to  meet  future
workforce  demands  and to ensure that all learners receive an equitable
experience through the awareness of opportunities; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is important to recognize the invaluable contribution of
career and technical education to the future workers in our state in  an
effort  to  increase workforce readiness and industry development, as 49
percent of jobs in our great state require skills training,  however  37
percent are trained at this level; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Career  and  Technical  Education  professionals  assist
students all across New York in exploring, planning  for,  and  training
for  their  future  occupation  through  a comprehensive experience that
provides for higher rates of high school graduation than non-CTE  peers,
industry  credentials,  licenses,  postsecondary  certificates,  college
degrees, work-based learning opportunities, industry based learning  and
cross-curricular  applications in the disciplines of math, science, ELA,
oral and written communication, ascetic, and  the  development  of  soft
skills; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  numerous  career  and  technical  education
organizations throughout this great  state  that  provide  training  and
professional  development in every sector of the New York State economy;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Association  for  Career  and  Technical
Education  (NYSACTE)  is  a  statewide  organization  representing  and
supporting thousands of career and technical education professionals who
 
work collaboratively with students, educators and industry to carry  out
the mission of NYSACTE in developing a competitive workforce; and
 
  WHEREAS,  NYSACTE  members  understand  that together, as Career and
Technical Educators, it is critical to offer cutting edge, rigorous  and
relevant  education that prepares individuals for high-wage, high-scale,
high-demand careers in established and emerging industries; and
 
  WHEREAS, This education addresses the needs of  closing  the  skills
gap  through  placing  an emphasis on fostering leadership skills inside
and  outside  of  the  classroom,  as  well  as  offering  students  the
opportunity  to  work together to accomplish goals, run student-centered
events and meetings where ideas, initiatives and solutions are developed
through project-based learning to develop a foundation  of  skills  that
will help students learn how to excel as future leaders in the workforce
of tomorrow; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  the
importance of  the  field  of  teaching  in  the  Career  and  Technical
Education sector should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February  2024,  as  Teach
CTE Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
