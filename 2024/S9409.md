 MOTION  OR ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE HAS BEEN FILED PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF
 THE PERIOD OF SUSPENDED JUDGMENT ALLEGING  A  VIOLATION  OR  SEEKING  AN

 SIXTY-ONE OF THIS ARTICLE.

 parent  or  other person legally responsible for a child's care violated
 the terms and conditions of a suspended judgment  issued  under  section
 one  thousand  fifty-three  of this article, the period of the suspended
 judgment shall be tolled AS OF THE DATE OF SUCH FILING pending  disposi-
 tion of the motion or order to show cause.  IF A MOTION OR ORDER TO SHOW

 REMOVAL OF THE CHILD FROM THE HOME PENDING DISPOSITION OF THE MOTION  OR

 ANT TO SECTION ONE THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR OF THIS ARTICLE WHERE  COMPELLED

 VIOLATION, the court is satisfied by competent proof that the parent  or
 other  person  violated  the  order of suspended judgment, the court may
 revoke the suspension of judgment and enter any order  that  might  have
 been made at the time judgment was suspended OR MAY EXTEND THE PERIOD OF
 SUSPENDED  JUDGMENT  PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION (B) OF SECTION ONE THOUSAND
 FIFTY-THREE OF THIS ARTICLE. THE  COURT  SHALL  STATE  ITS  REASONS  FOR
 REVOKING OR EXTENDING A PERIOD OF SUSPENDED JUDGMENT UNDER THIS SECTION.
