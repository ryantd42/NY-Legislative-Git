 Introduced  by M. of A. CLARK -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Children and Families
 
 AN ACT to amend the social services law, the environmental  conservation
  law  and  the  public health law, in relation to the protection of air
  quality for day care centers

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds and declares that
 it  shall  be the policy of the state of New York to provide every child
 with an environmentally safe and healthy learning environment  in  which
 to  grow, learn and mature into productive and healthy adults. To ensure
 that day care facilities provide this  setting  for  our  children,  the
 legislature finds that standards for day care facilities must be protec-
 tive of children's environmental health and safety. Children are unique-
 ly  vulnerable to and may be severely affected by exposure to chemicals,
 hazardous wastes and other environmental  hazards,  which  affect  their
 learning abilities as well as create chemical-based responses and sensi-
 tivities.  It  is  the  purpose of this legislation to reduce as much as
 possible such exposures for children and day care facility staff.
  § 2. Section 390-a of the social services law  is  amended  by  adding
 three new subdivisions 6, 7 and 8 to read as follows:

 ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT OF NINETEEN HUNDRED SIXTY-FOUR, AS AMENDED,  IF
