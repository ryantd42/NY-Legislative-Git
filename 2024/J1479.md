  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend those individuals of outstanding purpose whose lives  have  been
committed to public service and the pursuit of excellence in the conduct
of the legislative process in this noble Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
congratulate  Mayor  Robert Palmieri upon the occasion of his retirement
after serving diligently as Mayor of the City of Utica, New York, to  be
recognized at his official send-off celebration on Tuesday, December 12,
2023 at 72 Tavern & Grill, 400 Oriskany St. W., Utica New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Robert Palmieri began his illustrious career with the City
of Utica in 2011, when he was elected as Mayor; he was heavily  involved
in  public  service  prior  to  his election, serving as a member of the
Utica Common Council for fourteen years on behalf of his  community,  as

2007, and as Deputy Public Safety Commissioner and Codes Commissioner in
2011; and

Robert Palmieri was the Girls'  Basketball  Coach  at  Notre  Dame  High

volunteer basketball official; and

Valley Community College, Robert Palmieri has  earned  recognition  from

financial  transformation;  the development of Nano Utica, Utica Harbor,

million-dollar deficit budgets skyrocketing into  a  fund  balance  that

  WHEREAS, In his official acts, Mayor Robert Palmieri was governed by
a keen sense of duty and always showed a unique grasp of human problems;

of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
