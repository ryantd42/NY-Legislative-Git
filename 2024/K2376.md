  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  July 2024, as Fibroid Awareness Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  has  an interest in fostering the
health and well-being of its citizens and engaging  in  a  conscientious
commitment to advancing women's health; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim July 2024, as Fibroid Awareness  Month
in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Uterine  fibroids,  clinically known as uterine leiomyoma,
are the most common benign tumors in the  uterus  and  the  single  most
common indication for hysterectomy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  African  American  women  experience uterine fibroids at a
rate of three times that of the general population, a higher  rate  than
any other ethnic group; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  United  States,  obstetric  outcomes  that  were
attributed to fibroid tumors resulted in a cost of $238 million to $7.76
billion annually; uterine fibroid tumors  were  estimated  to  cost  the
United States $5.9-34.4 billion annually, and over $3.6 billion is spent
annually  on  the medical expense of hysterectomy procedures, and 1.6 to
17.2 billion estimated annual lost work costs in  terms  of  absenteeism
and short-term disability in women ages 25 to 54; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  establishment  of  health  seminars,  funding
opportunities, medical information panels, and community programs  would
empower  and  inform  residents  of  the State of New York about uterine
fibroids and would encourage earlier diagnosis,  more  research,  better
treatment  options,  and  eventually  a  cure for uterine fibroids; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim July 2024, as Fibroid
Awareness Month in the State of New  York,  fully  confident  that  this
recognition  will  emanate the journey to fostering appropriate measures
to battle this disadvantageous disease; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
