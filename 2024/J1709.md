Showtime to be its blow-by-blow voice of the new series ShoBox: the  New

stepping back in 2009 due to health setbacks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Returning to the mic to call his last ShoBox fight on April
30,  2010,  Nick  Charles  decided  to  take  a  step  back  to focus on

on  June  25,  2011,  leaving behind a legacy that will long outlast his
existence and bring joy to his memory; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nick  Charles  clearly  contributed  to  the  spirit  of
excellence  which  is  a  tradition  of the International Boxing Hall of
Fame; and

individuals  of  such  outstanding  accomplishments  are  brought to our
 
attention, they should be recognized by all the citizens of  this  great
Empire State; now, therefore, be it
