  LEGISLATION  RESOLUTION memorializing Governor Kathy
  Hochul to proclaim January 28 to February  3,  2024,
  as  Physician Anesthesiologists Week in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official weeks that are set aside to inform key audiences about the role
and  value  of Physician Anesthesiologists in delivering anesthesia care
in today and tomorrow's United States health care system; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 28 to February  3,
2024,  as  Physician Anesthesiologists Week in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance of National  Physician  Anesthesiologist
Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Physician anesthesiologists are guardians of patient safety
in  health  care, whether that be in the operating room, in the delivery
room, in the intensive care unit, in pain management clinics, and at the
U.S.  Department of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  protecting  our  Nation's
Veterans; and
 
  WHEREAS, A certification that requires tremendous effort to achieve,
the  12  to 14 years of education and 12,000 to 16,000 hours of training
physician  anesthesiologists  receive  prepare  them  to  navigate
life-and-death  moments  and  help  ensure  patients  receive  the
highest-quality care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Physician anesthesiologists  are  made  for  working  under
pressure,  playing a critical role in keeping patients safe in the State
and their community, whether managing a crisis during surgery  or  labor
and  delivery, providing pain management, or caring for our Veterans who
are among the most vulnerable  patients  often  suffering  from  medical
conditions associated with their military service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Anesthesia  Team  model,  led  by  physician
anesthesiologists, is widely recognized as the  gold  standard  of  care
used  in  all  of  the  Nation's  top hospitals and in the Department of
Veterans Affairs to protect patients and the millions  of  Veterans  who
have  served  our  country  and  deserve  the same high standard of care
available for 95% of Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, Every person in New York is entitled  to  and  should  have
universal  access to the highest level of anesthesia care, every patient
regardless of socioeconomic status deserves a physician anesthesiologist
leading their care, advocating for them, and safeguarding them when they
are under anesthesia and therefore, unable to advocate  for  themselves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Physician anesthesiologists are recognized leaders who are
committed to safe and high-quality patient care, educating  patients  on
 
anesthesia  safety,  and reducing risks of complications before, during,
and after surgery; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 28 to February  3,
2024,  as  Physician Anesthesiologists Week in the State of New York, in
recognition of our appreciation  for  physician  anesthesiologists,  who
serve  as  critical  care  specialists  and  work to greatly improve the
safety of anesthesia and the well-being of surgical patients,  Veterans,
and chronic pain patients each day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  and  Board  Members  of  the  New  York  State  Society  of
Anesthesiologists.
