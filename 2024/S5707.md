 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law and the  insurance  law,  in
  relation  to  reckless  driving  and  the implementation of a reckless
  driving and vehicular violence awareness component of the  pre-licens-
  ing course for driver's licenses
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The Legislature recognizes the  height-
 ened  responsibility of operating a multi-ton car or truck and that such
 motor vehicle is a dangerous instrument under  state  law  that,  in  an
 instant,  can  cause lethal physical harm. For example, when operating a
 car at 30 miles per hour the average risk of  a  pedestrian  dying  upon
 impact  with  such car is 40%, at 40 miles per hour the risk of death is
 80%, and at speeds greater than 50 miles  per  hour  the  likelihood  of
 death is near certain at nearly 100%.
  When  deaths resulting from alcohol-impaired driving were reduced from
 approximately 30,000 annually in  the  early  1980s  across  the  United
 States to approximately 10,000 annually in recent years, that remarkable
 reduction  was  achieved in part by the certainty experienced by drivers
 that they would suffer legal consequences for driving impaired and risk-
 ing the lives of themselves and others, resulting from changes  in  laws
 prohibiting impaired driving. However, that certainty does not exist for
 other  types  of dangerous driving. A 2016 survey by the National Safety
 Council showed that "although 83% of drivers surveyed believe driving is
 a safety concern, a startling number say they are  comfortable  speeding
 (64%)  and  texting  either  manually  or through voice controls (47%),"
 whereas far fewer (10%) say they are comfortable driving after they feel
 they've had too much alcohol. This shows that, while drunk  driving  has
 become socially unacceptable, most other forms of dangerous driving have

 not, and New Yorkers are paying the price with lives lost and bodies and
 families  shattered. Moreover, the New York city Department of Transpor-
 tation estimated in 2010 that the annual cost  of  all  traffic  crashes
 just  in  New  York  city  to be $4.29 billion annually, about 1% of the
 Gross City Product.
  As evidenced by our country's  experience  combatting  drunk  driving,
 research  has  shown  that  perceived certainty of legal consequences is
 necessary to deter or prevent harmful acts, including dangerous driving.
 The original statutory language of the New York vehicle and traffic  law
 section  1212,  in  and of itself, is favorable to a reasonable standard
 for reckless or dangerous driving, specifying that driving in  a  manner
 that  "unreasonably  interferes with" or "unreasonably endangers others"
 constitutes a violation of that section and is an unclassified misdemea-
 nor. However, that reasonableness standard has subsequently been height-
 ened by New York judicial interpretations that require factors such as a
 finding of seriously blameworthy conduct, an "affirmative  act"  by  the
 driver,  a  "gross  deviation" from the standard of conduct a reasonable
 person would observe, and additional "aggravating factors" on behalf  of
 the  driver -- all judicial interpretations not required by the original
 statutory text. This judicially imposed requirement fails  to  recognize
 the  awesome  responsibility  that operating a multi-ton car or truck is
 and as a consequence, evidenced in part by the staggering  injuries  and
 deaths in our state, the statute has failed to achieve what it intended.
 Cars  and trucks are dangerous instruments under state law and should be
 recognized as such when applying vehicle and traffic law  section  1212.
 For  these  reasons  the legislature is correcting the misapplication of
 vehicle and traffic law section 1212 and restoring the  statute  to  its
 original  intent to deter and prevent dangerous operation of heavy motor
 vehicles that pose a daily threat to public health and risk the lives of
 New Yorkers throughout our state.
  § 2. Section 1212 of the vehicle and traffic law, as added by  chapter
 47 of the laws of 1988, is amended to read as follows:
  § 1212. Reckless  driving.  (A)  Reckless driving shall mean [driving]
 OPERATING or using any motor vehicle, motorcycle or  any  other  vehicle
 propelled  by  any  power  other than muscular power or any appliance or
 accessory thereof in a manner which  unreasonably  interferes  with  the
 free and [proper] SAFE use of the public highway, or unreasonably endan-
 gers  users of the public highway. Reckless driving is prohibited. Every
 person violating this  provision  shall  be  guilty  of  a  misdemeanor.
 NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER  PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER OR THE PENAL LAW,
 THERE SHALL BE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT EVERY PERSON VIOLATING THIS
 SECTION AND WHO CAUSES PHYSICAL INJURY, SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY OR DEATH
 TO ANOTHER PERSON SHALL BE FOUND TO HAVE ACTED WITH CRIMINAL  NEGLIGENCE
 UNDER  SECTION  15.05  OF THE PENAL LAW, AND EVERY PERSON VIOLATING THIS
 SECTION WHILE ACTING WITH CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE SHALL BE GUILTY OF A CLASS
 A MISDEMEANOR. A VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION DOES NOT REQUIRE A FINDING OF
 A MINIMUM NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS OF LAW OR A FINDING  THAT  A  PERSON  WAS
 AWARE  OF,  HAD  PERCEIVED,  OR  HAD CREATED THE RISK OF HARM TO ANOTHER
 PERSON.
  (B) PROVIDED FURTHER, IF THE OPERATOR OF A MOTOR  VEHICLE,  MOTORCYCLE
 OR ANY OTHER VEHICLE PROPELLED BY ANY POWER OTHER THAN MUSCULAR POWER OR
 ANY  APPLIANCE  OR  ACCESSORY  THEREOF  OPERATES IN A MANNER THAT CAUSES
 PHYSICAL INJURY, SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY  OR  DEATH  TO  ANOTHER  PERSON
 WHILE  VIOLATING ONE OR MORE SECTIONS OF THIS CHAPTER OR OF A LAW, ORDI-
 NANCE, ORDER, RULE OR REGULATION RELATING TO  TRAFFIC,  EXCEPT  PARKING,
 STANDING,  OR  STOPPING  OFFENSES,  THEN  THERE  SHALL  BE  A REBUTTABLE

 more than fifteen days or by both such fine and imprisonment.
  2.  If  such  driver  of  a motor vehicle causes physical injury while
 failing to exercise due care in violation of  subdivision  (a)  of  this
 section,  then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that, as a result
 of such failure to exercise due care, such  person  operated  the  motor
 vehicle in a manner that caused such physical injury.
  (c)  1. A driver of a motor vehicle who causes serious physical injury
 as defined in article ten of the penal law to a pedestrian or  bicyclist

 tration  pursuant to subparagraph (xiv) or (xv) of paragraph b of subdi-
 vision two of section five hundred ten of this chapter.
  2. If such driver of a motor vehicle causes  serious  physical  injury

 result  of  such  failure to exercise due care, such person operated the
 motor vehicle in a manner that caused such serious physical injury.
  (d) A violation of subdivision (b) or (c) of this section committed by
 a person who has previously been convicted  of  any  violation  of  such
 subdivisions within the preceding five years, shall constitute a class B

 nity service.]

 law,  as  amended  by  section  3  of  chapter 4 of the laws of 2021, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (1)  Any  schedule of rates or rating plan for motor vehicle liability

 prevention courses shall be monitored by the department of  motor  vehi-
 cles  and  shall include components of instruction in "Road Rage" aware-
