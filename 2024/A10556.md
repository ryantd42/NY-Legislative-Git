 Introduced  by  COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (at request of M. of A. Burgos) --
  read once and referred to the Committee on Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing an  arti-
  ficial  intelligence  literacy in the digital equity competitive grant
  program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Artificial Intelligence Literacy Act of 2024".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature,  as  well  as  the  United
 States congress, finds that:
  (1) Artificial intelligence is transformative technology.
  (2) Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly ubiquitous making
 artificial intelligence literacy important.
  (3) Technological leadership in artificial intelligence is an economic
 and national security imperative.
  (4)  Effective  artificial intelligence literacy initiatives encompass
 not only technical training but also comprehensive education  about  the
 potential benefits and risks.
  (5) Informed developers and consumers of artificial intelligence tech-
 nologies  can help mitigate risks and biases often found in systems that
 use artificial intelligence.
  (6) Basic artificial intelligence literacy  is  critical  to  ensuring
 Americans  have  the  tools and knowledge needed to navigate the economy
 and digital world.
  (7)  Successful  artificial  intelligence  literacy  initiatives  will
 prepare  Americans of all ages and technical backgrounds to safely navi-
 gate artificial intelligence tools and  artificial  intelligence-enabled
 technologies.
  (8)  Communities  most negatively impacted by artificial intelligence-
 enabled technologies often have the least access to artificial  intelli-
 gence education.
  (9)  Artificial  intelligence  literacy initiatives must engage stake-
 holders and communities in all  stages  and  specific  outreach  efforts

 should  be  made  for  communities  disproportionately  impacted  by the
 digital divide, including minority and rural communities.
  (10) Jobs for the Future survey found 58% believe that learning oppor-
 tunities  around  artificial  intelligence should be offered to workers,
 53% believe such opportunities should  be  available  to  learners,  54%
 believe  they  would feel more prepared for the future impact of artifi-
 cial intelligence if they were given learning tools for it.
  (11) As of 2018, the U.S. artificial intelligence workforce  stood  at
 about  14,000,000  workers  or  9%  of employment. Demand for artificial
 intelligence occupations is projected to grow twice as fast as  for  all
 occupations in the U.S.
  (12)  In 2021, black students made up only 7.5% of artificial intelli-
 gence-related bachelor's degrees despite making  up  14%  of  the  popu-
 lation.  Women account for 60% of college graduates and only 40% of STEM
 graduates and 25% of artificial intelligence graduates.
  (13) The need for a strong workforce of artificial intelligence  work-
 ers,  as  well  an artificial intelligence-literate population, requires
 investment in artificial intelligence literacy education.
