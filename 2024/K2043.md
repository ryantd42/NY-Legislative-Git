  HONORING  Vice  President  Hugh  Sullivan upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  50  years  of  dedicated  service to the Lake
  George Volunteer Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are inspired  by,  and
indebted  to,  our  noble  firefighters  who exhibit courage and bravery
every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters exemplify the power of  human  compassion  and
the  strength  of the American spirit through actions of the most heroic
magnitude; their sacrifices and their selfless dedication merit  tribute
and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  honor Vice
President Hugh Sullivan upon the occasion of his designation for special
recognition after 50 years of  dedicated  service  to  the  Lake  George
Volunteer Fire Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hugh  "Jim" Sullivan has consistently demonstrated a level
of commitment, dedication, integrity, and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the firefighting service; and
 
  WHEREAS, A member of the Lake George Volunteer Fire Department since
1974, Hugh Sullivan has served to protect his community from the hazards
to life and property in every position in the Department; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hugh  Sullivan  progressed through the firematic chairs as
Lieutenant, Captain, 2nd Assistant Chief, 1st Assistant Chief, and Chief
of  the  Department  from  1987-1991;  currently,  he  serves  as  Vice
President; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  the  administrative  side of the Lake George Volunteer
Fire Department's  staff,  Hugh  Sullivan  advanced  to  President  from
2000-2004; additionally, he served as Treasurer for many years; in 1988,
he  received  the Phil Wood Award, a prestigious honor bestowed upon the
Department's members who have exceptionally served all  aspects  of  the
community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hugh Sullivan has served on numerous committees, including
one for the creation of the Lake George Water Rescue Unit  in  1985;  he
was  one  of  the  original  drivers  of  the team, responsible for many
rescues of his neighbors in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected men and women are often the  first
to  respond  to  an  emergency,  whether  the  emergency  is  a  fire,
transportation accident, natural disaster,  act  of  terrorism,  medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others, and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
 
Hugh Sullivan is such a firefighter; throughout his 50 years of  devoted
service,  he  heroically  performed,  above and beyond the call of duty,
those responsibilities which define the task of  fire  protection;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Vice President Hugh Sullivan upon the occasion of his  designation
for  special recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to the Lake
George Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Vice President Hugh Sullivan.
