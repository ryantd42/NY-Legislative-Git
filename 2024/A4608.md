 Introduced  by M. of A. GLICK -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to preserving  ecological
  integrity, wildlife and open space in the Adirondack park
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and statement of purpose. When enacted
 in nineteen hundred seventy-three, the  Adirondack  park  land  use  and
 development  plan  represented  an  historic  application  of  natural
 resource-based land use control and economic opportunity for the  park's
 residents  and communities. For over forty years, the plan has sought to
 insure optimum overall conservation, protection, preservation,  develop-
 ment  and  use  of the unique scenic, aesthetic, wildlife, recreational,
 open space, historic, ecological and natural resources of this cherished
 area and the essential interdependence of economic and  community  needs
 through balanced apportionment of land use within the park.
  Conservation  science  and  land use planning techniques have advanced
 since the enactment of the plan.  It is now recognized that the  spatial
 pattern  of development is fully, if not more, as ecologically important
 as its overall density.
  Subdivision of land into large  residential  lots,  or  rural  sprawl,
 impairs  ecosystem  function, decreases biotic integrity, alters species
 behavior and composition, increases human-wildlife conflicts,  fragments
 ownership,  impairs  cohesive land management, undermines the open space
 character of the park, and threatens its agricultural and forestry work-
 ing landscapes.
  Conservation development is an approach to  the  design,  construction
 and  stewardship  of  development that achieves functional protection of
 natural resources, while providing social and economic benefits to human
 communities. It requires a process that  ensures  thorough  analysis  of
 ecological  systems  and  environmental  conditions before the developer

 actually designs the project. This saves  the  preparation  of  detailed
 subdivision  plans, the most expensive part of design, to the end of the
 planning process. The process provides for  smaller  initial  costs  and
 allows for agency and public input before design funds are exhausted and
 ensures  that  the  developer  is  not committed to a design that is not
 supported by ecological and environmental conditions.
  The purpose of this act is to strengthen the land use and  development
 plan  and its administration by incorporating modern conservation design
 principles therein and to curtail rural sprawl. It is acknowledged  that
 each  property  is  unique  and  that  subdivision  should be pursued in
 accordance  with  ecologically-sound  principles  including  appropriate
 dedication  and preservation of substantial open space areas in further-
 ance of environmental protection goals and working landscapes.
  § 2. Section 802 of the executive law is amended  by  adding  six  new
 subdivisions 17-b, 18-a, 18-b, 18-c, 43-a and 52-a to read as follows:
  17-B.  "CONSERVATION  SUBDIVISION"  MEANS THE DIVISION OF ANY TRACT OF
 LAND INTO A RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION OF TWENTY-FIVE OR MORE LOTS, PARCELS
 OR SITES IN LOW INTENSITY USE AREAS, TEN OR MORE LOTS, PARCELS OR  SITES
 IN  RURAL USE AREAS, AND FIVE OR MORE LOTS, PARCELS OR SITES IN RESOURCE
 MANAGEMENT AREAS. A SUBDIVISION INVOLVING SOLELY LAWFULLY EXISTING PRIN-
 CIPAL BUILDINGS AND ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE  SHALL  NOT  BE  DEEMED  A
 CONSERVATION  SUBDIVISION. A SUBDIVISION CREATED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH C
 OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED ELEVEN OF  THIS  ARTICLE  IS
 NOT A CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION.
  18-A.  "DEVELOPMENT ENVELOPE" MEANS THE AREA OF LAND WITHIN A RESIDEN-
 TIAL LOT, PARCEL OR SITE WITHIN WHICH  ALL  PRINCIPAL  BUILDINGS,  GUEST
 COTTAGES, ROADS, DRIVEWAYS, AND OTHER STRUCTURES AND INFRASTRUCTURE MUST
 BE  LOCATED.  ROADS AND TRAILS ASSOCIATED WITH FORESTRY, AGRICULTURE AND
 OPEN SPACE RECREATION ARE ALLOWED OUTSIDE OF  THE  DEVELOPMENT  ENVELOPE
 PURSUANT TO THE OPEN SPACE MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP PLAN.
  18-B.  "ECOLOGICAL  IMPACT  ZONE"  MEANS  THAT  AREA OF A PROJECT SITE
 EXTENDING SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FEET BEYOND  THE  DEVELOPMENT  ENVELOPE  FOR
 EACH DEVELOPMENT SITE AND ANY CONTIGUOUS DEVELOPED SITES.
  18-C.  "ECOLOGICAL  SITE ANALYSIS" MEANS AN ANALYSIS OF A PROJECT SITE
 THAT IDENTIFIES IMPORTANT  ECOLOGICAL  SYSTEMS,  NATURAL  RESOURCES  AND
 HABITAT ON AND ADJACENT TO THE PROJECT SITE AND IDENTIFIES AREAS DESERV-
 ING PROTECTION AND POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AREAS FOR HOUSE LOTS, ROADS AND
 ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE.
  43-A.  "OPEN  SPACE  MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP PLAN" MEANS A PLAN FOR
 THE OWNERSHIP,  CONFIGURATION,  PERMANENT  LEGAL  PROTECTION,  FORESTRY,
 AGRICULTURE  AND  RECREATIONAL OPEN SPACE USES, AND MANAGEMENT OF DESIG-
 NATED OPEN SPACES.  OPEN SPACE MANAGEMENT  AND  STEWARDSHIP  PLAN  ALSO
 MEANS  A  PLAN  FOR  THE OWNERSHIP, CONFIGURATION AND MANAGEMENT OF OPEN
 SPACES PROVIDING PERMANENT LEGAL PROTECTION OF OPEN SPACES WHILE  ALLOW-
 ING FOR FORESTRY, AGRICULTURE AND RECREATION OPEN SPACES.
  52-A.  "PROJECT  SITE" MEANS THE LAND INCLUDED IN A PROJECT UPON WHICH
 THE APPLICABLE OVERALL INTENSITY GUIDELINE  IS  CALCULATED  PURSUANT  TO
 PARAGRAPH  C  OF  SUBDIVISION  TEN OF SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED NINE OF THIS
 ARTICLE.
  § 3. Subparagraph 2 of paragraph f of subdivision 3 of section 805  of
 the  executive  law,  as  amended by chapter 348 of the laws of 1973, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (2) Purposes, policies and objectives. The basic purpose and objective
 of rural use areas is to provide for and encourage those rural land uses
 that are consistent and compatible with the relatively low tolerance  of
 the  areas'  natural  resources  and the preservation of the open spaces
 A. 4608  3
 
 that are essential and basic to the unique character of the park. Anoth-
 er objective of rural use areas is to prevent  strip  development  along
 major  travel  corridors  in order to enhance the aesthetic and economic
 benefit derived from a park atmosphere along these corridors.
  Residential  development and related development and uses should occur
 [on large lots or] in relatively small clusters  on  carefully  selected
 and  well  designed  sites.  This  will provide for further diversity in
 residential and related development opportunities in the park.
  § 4. Subparagraph 2 of paragraph g of subdivision 3 of section 805  of
 the  executive  law,  as  amended by chapter 348 of the laws of 1973, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (2) Purposes, policies and objectives. The basic purposes  and  objec-
 tives  of resource management areas are to protect the delicate physical
 and biological resources, encourage proper and  economic  management  of
 forest,  agricultural  and  recreational resources and preserve the open
 spaces that are essential and basic to the unique character of the park.
 Another objective of these areas is to prevent strip  development  along
 major  travel  corridors  in order to enhance the aesthetic and economic
 benefits derived from a park atmosphere along these corridors.
  [Finally, resource management areas will allow for residential]  RESI-
 DENTIAL development [on substantial acreages or] AND RELATED DEVELOPMENT
 AND USES SHOULD OCCUR in RELATIVELY small clusters on carefully selected
 and well designed sites.
  §  5.  Section  809  of  the  executive law is amended by adding a new
 subdivision 11-a to read as follows:
