  HONORING Ex-Chief John Clarke upon the occasion of
  his  designation  for  special  recognition after 50
  years of dedicated service to  Williston  Park  Fire
  Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Ex-Chief John Clarke upon the occasion of his  designation  for  special
recognition  after  50 years of dedicated service to Williston Park Fire
Department, to  be  celebrated  at  its  97th  Annual  Installation  and
Inspection  Dinner  and  Dance  on  Saturday,  April  27,  2024,  at the
Milleridge Cottage in Jericho, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ex-Chief John Clarke has consistently demonstrated a  level
of  commitment,  dedication,  integrity  and professionalism which truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters and fire  departments  not  only  provide  the
critical  service of fire protection but also engage in other activities
of great benefit and importance to the communities they serve; and
 
  WHEREAS, A member of the Williston Park Fire Department since  March
18,  1974,  John  Clarke  climbed  the  ranks  to become: FASNY Delegate
(1976-1977 & 1994-1995),  Nassau  County  Chiefs  Delegate  (1983),  2nd
Lieutenant of Company No. 2 (1984-1985), 1st Lieutenant of Company No. 2
(1989-1990), Captain of Company No. 2 (1990-1992), Warden of Company No.

(2000-2002), 1st Assistant Chief (2002-2004), and  Chief  of  Department
(2004-2006); and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Ex-Chief John Clarke is such a  firefighter;  throughout  his  years  of
devoted  service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond
the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Ex-Chief John Clarke for 50  years  of  distinguished  service  to
Williston Park Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Ex-Chief John Clarke.
