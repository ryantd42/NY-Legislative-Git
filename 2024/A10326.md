 AN ACT relating to authorizing the state university of New York at Stony
  Brook  to lease certain lands to construct multi-purpose facilities to
  support housing needs and supporting amenities
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the state
 university of New York at Stony  Brook  ("Stony  Brook")  seeks  to  use
 approximately  10 acres of underutilized land on Stony Brook's Southamp-
 ton campus to build multi-purpose facilities to  support  housing  needs
 and  supporting  amenities,  fulfilling  a  necessary  and  vital public
 purpose.  The legislature further finds that granting  the  trustees  of
 the State University of New York ("Trustees") the authority and power to
 lease and otherwise contract to make available grounds and facilities of
 Stony  Brook's  campus will ensure such land is utilized for the benefit
 of Stony Brook, the surrounding community, and the general public.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the  trustees  are
 authorized  and  empowered,  without  any  public  bidding, to lease and
 otherwise contract to make available to a ground lessee a portion of the
 lands of Stony Brook generally described in this act for the purpose  of
 developing, constructing, maintaining and operating multi-purpose facil-
 ities  to  support housing needs and supporting amenities. Such lease or
 contract shall be for a period not exceeding ninety-nine  years  without
 any fee simple conveyance and otherwise upon terms and conditions deter-
 mined  by  such trustees, subject to the approval of the director of the
 division of the budget, the attorney general and the state  comptroller.
 In the event that the real property that is the subject of such lease or
 contract  shall  cease to be used for the purpose described in this act,
 such lease or contract shall immediately terminate and the real property
 and any improvements thereon shall revert to the state university of New
 York. Any lease or contract entered into  pursuant  to  this  act  shall

 provide  that  the  real  property  that is the subject of such lease or
 contract and any improvements thereon shall revert to the state  univer-
 sity  of  New  York on the expiration of such contract or lease. Any and
 all  proceeds related to the leases authorized by this act shall be used
 for the benefit of the Stony Brook campus and  the  allocation  of  such
 proceeds shall be subject to approval by the Trustees.
  §  3. Any contract or lease entered into pursuant to this act shall be
 deemed to be a state contract for purposes of article 15-A of the execu-
 tive law, and any contractor, subcontractor, lessee or sublessee  enter-
 ing into such contract or lease for the construction, demolition, recon-
 struction, excavation, rehabilitation, repair, renovation, alteration or
 improvement  authorized  pursuant  to  this  act shall be deemed a state
 agency for the purposes of article 15-A of the executive law and subject
 to the provisions of such article.
  § 4. Notwithstanding any general, special or  local  law  or  judicial
 decision  to the contrary, all work performed on a project authorized by
 this act where all or any portion thereof involves a lease or  agreement
 for  construction,  demolition,  reconstruction,  excavation,  rehabili-
 tation, repair, renovation, alteration or improvement shall  be  subject
 to  and  performed in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the
 labor law to the same extent and in the same manner as a contract of the
 state, and compliance with all the provisions of article 8 of the  labor
 law  shall  be  required of any lessee, sublessee, contractor or subcon-
 tractor on the project, including the  enforcement  of  prevailing  wage
 requirements by the fiscal officer as defined in paragraph e of subdivi-
 sion  5 of section 220 of the labor law to the same extent as a contract

 state  university of New York shall not contract out for the instruction
 or  any  pedagogical  functions  or  services,  or  any  administrative
 services, and similar professional services currently being performed by
 state  employees.  All such functions and services shall be performed by
 state employees pursuant to the civil service law. Nothing in  this  act
 shall  result in the displacement of any currently employed state worker
 or  the  loss  of  position  (including  partial  displacement  such  as
 reduction  in  the hours of non-overtime, wages or employment benefits),
 or result in the  impairment  of  existing  contracts  for  services  or
 collective  bargaining rights pursuant to existing agreements. All posi-
 tions currently at the state university of New York in the  unclassified
 service  of  the  civil  service  law  shall  remain in the unclassified
 service. No services or work on  the  property  described  in  this  act
 currently  performed  by public employees or future work that is similar
 in scope and nature to the work  being  currently  performed  by  public
 employees  shall be contracted out or privatized by the state university
 of New York or by an affiliated entity or associated entity of the state
 university of New York. All such  future  work  shall  be  performed  by
 public employees.

 which  provides that only contractors and subcontractors who sign a pre-
 negotiated agreement with the labor  organization  can  perform  project
 work.
  §  7. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special, or local
 law or judicial decision  to  the  contrary,  the  ground  lessee  shall
 require  the use of a project labor agreement, as defined in subdivision
 1 of section 222 of the labor law, for all contractors  and  subcontrac-
 tors  on  the project, consistent with paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of
 section 222 of the labor law.

 or benefits of employees of the state university of New York that other-
 wise would be available to them pursuant  to  the  terms  of  agreements
 between the certified representatives of such employees and the state of
 New  York  pursuant  to  article  14  of the civil service law; all work
 performed on such property that ordinarily would be performed by employ-
 ees subject to article 14 of the civil service law shall continue to  be
 performed by such employees.

 ground  lessee  and  parties  contracting with the ground lessee for the
 purposes of completing the project described in this act.

 lessee  or sublessee promises to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the
 lessor against all claims, suits, actions, and liability to all  persons
 on  the leased premises, including tenant, tenant's agents, contractors,
 subcontractors, employees, customers, guests,  licensees,  invitees  and
 members of the public, for damage to any such person's property, whether
 real  or  personal, or for personal injuries arising out of tenant's use
 or occupation of the demised premises.
