  CONGRATULATING  the Finger Lakes Community College
  Women's Logging Sports Team  upon  the  occasion  of
  capturing the Northeast Division Title
 
  WHEREAS,  Individual  and team championships are highly sought after
in college school sports; this Legislative Body commends  rare  athletic
achievements  and  pays  special  recognition  to  those who pursue such
excellence and become examples for the youth of this great Empire State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Athletic competition helps to enhance both  the  moral  and
physical development of young athletes, preparing them for the future by
instilling in them the importance of teamwork, encouraging a standard of
healthy living, and developing a sense of fair play and competition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
congratulate  the  Finger Lakes Community College (FLCC) Women's Logging
Sports Team upon the occasion of capturing the Northeast Division  Title
at the 2024 Spring Meet held at Paul Smiths College; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Competing  against  opponents  from  12  colleges  and
universities across the Northeast, the Lakers put  together  a  standout
performance  amidst  the  four  divisions-Women, Men, Jack and Jill, and
Open; and
 
  WHEREAS, The FLCC women's team, composed of  six  student  athletes,
outperformed  rivals  by  significant  margins, amassing over 200 points
more than their closest competitor, SUNY ESF, and leading by 261  points
over Colby College of Maine; their victory included first-place finishes
in nine out of the 19 events; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Morgan Cheney and her teammates shone in the portage canoe
race, while Mackenzie Ferris and Rachel Joseph  secured  a  win  in  the
standing block chop; team captain Nita Schumacher demonstrated her skill
in  the super bow saw event, with Lydia Culbert and Naomi Weed excelling
in the doubles scoot load; and
 
  WHEREAS, The win is even more noteworthy for the Lakers competing as
the only two-year  college  amongst  a  competition  pool  of  four-year
institutions,  including  UConn,  UMaine,  Dartmouth,  and  various SUNY
schools, highlighting the list of notable competitors; and
 
  WHEREAS, As the FLCC Women's Logging Sports  Team  celebrates  their
impressive  victory, they continue to honor a 50-year-old tradition that
has led the Lakers to become  one  of  the  most  dominant  programs  in
logging sports; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Coaches Ryan Staychock, Brandon Graves, Hanna Quigley, and
Blaise Cox, and all the outstanding athletes on the FLCC Women's Logging
Sports have clearly utilized dedication, determination, and teamwork  in
providing  a lasting contribution to the spirit of excellence which is a
tradition of their school; now, therefore, be it
