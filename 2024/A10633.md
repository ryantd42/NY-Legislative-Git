  in relation to prohibiting the governor  from  issuing  a  message  of
  necessity for budget related bills; proposing an amendment to sections
  4  and 7 of article 7, in relation to a balanced budget; and proposing
  amendments to article 7, in relation to limitations on state-supported
  debt and the rainy day reserve fund
 
  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 14 of article
 3 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 14. No bill shall be passed or become a law  unless  it  shall  have
 been  printed  and  upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at
 least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage, unless
 the governor, or the acting governor, shall have certified, under his or
 her hand and the seal of the state, the facts which in his or her  opin-
 ion  necessitate an immediate vote thereon, in which case it must never-
 theless be upon the desks of the members in final form, not  necessarily
 printed,  before  its  final  passage, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, SUCH IMMEDIATE
 VOTE SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED FOR  BUDGET  BILLS  OR  APPROPRIATION  BILLS
 RELATING THERETO EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS; nor shall any bill
 be  passed  or  become  a law, except by the assent of a majority of the
 members elected to each branch of the legislature;  and  upon  the  last
 reading  of a bill, no amendment thereof shall be allowed, and the ques-
 tion upon its final passage shall be taken immediately  thereafter,  and
 the ayes and nays entered on the journal.
  For purposes of this section, a bill shall be deemed to be printed and
 upon the desks of the members if: it is set forth in a legible electron-
 ic  format  by  electronic means, and it is available for review in such
 format at the desks of the members. For purposes of this section  "elec-
 tronic  means"  means  any method of transmission of information between
 computers or other machines designed for  the  purpose  of  sending  and

 expression; and does not permit additions, deletions or other changes to
 be made without leaving an adequate record thereof.
  §  2.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 4 of article 7 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 4. The legislature may not alter an appropriation bill submitted  by
 the  governor  except  to strike out or reduce items therein, but it may
 add thereto items of appropriation  provided  that  such  additions  are
 stated separately and distinctly from the original items of the bill and
 refer  each  to  a single object or purpose.  SUCH NEW ITEMS SHALL STATE
 REVENUES SUFFICIENT TO MEET SUCH  PROPOSED  EXPENDITURES.  None  of  the
 restrictions of this section, however, shall apply to appropriations for
 the legislature or judiciary.
  Such  an  appropriation bill shall when passed by both houses be a law
 immediately without further action by the governor, except  that  appro-
 priations  for the legislature and judiciary and separate items added to
 the governor's bills by the legislature shall be subject to approval  of
 the governor as provided in section 7 of article IV.
  §  3.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 7 of article 7 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 7. No money shall ever be paid out of the state treasury or  any  of
 its funds, or any of the funds under its management, except in pursuance
 of  an  appropriation by law; nor unless such payment be made within two
 years next after the passage of such appropriation act; and  every  such
 law  making  a  new appropriation or continuing or reviving an appropri-
 ation, shall distinctly specify the sum appropriated, and the object  or
 purpose to which it is to be applied, AND EVERY APPROPRIATION SHALL HAVE
 MONEYS  AND  REVENUES SUFFICIENT TO MEET SUCH EXPENDITURES; and it shall
 not be sufficient for such law to refer to any other  law  to  fix  such
 sum.
  §  4. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 10 of article 7 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 10. In addition to the above limited power to  contract  debts,  the
 state  may  contract  debts to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, or
 defend the state in war,  or  to  [suppress  forest  fires]  RESPOND  TO
 NATURAL  DISASTERS  OR  AN  EPIDEMIC OF A DISEASE; but the money arising
 from the contracting of such debts shall be applied for the purpose  for
 which  it  was  raised,  or to repay such debts, and to no other purpose
 whatever.
  § 5. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That article 7 of the  constitu-
 tion be amended by adding a new section 20 to read as follows:
  §  20.  LIMITATIONS  ON  THE ISSUANCE OF STATE-SUPPORTED DEBT. 1.  (A)
 STATE-SUPPORTED  DEBT  MAY  NOT  BE  CONTRACTED  FOR  UNLESS  THE  TOTAL
 OUTSTANDING  PRINCIPAL  AMOUNT  OF  SUCH DEBT, AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THE
 IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR, IS LESS THAN THE DESIGNATED  PERCENT-

 tion be amended by adding a new section 21 to read as follows:
 A. 10633  4
 
  § 21. RAINY DAY RESERVE FUND. 1. THERE SHALL BE IN THE STATE  TREASURY
 A  FUND  TO  BE  KNOWN AS THE "RAINY DAY RESERVE FUND".  SUCH FUND SHALL
 CONSIST OF MONEYS DEPOSITED THEREIN AND MONEYS SHALL BE  WITHDRAWN  FROM
 SUCH FUND ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES AS PROVIDED THEREIN.
  2.  SUCH  FUND  SHALL  HAVE A MAXIMUM BALANCE NOT TO EXCEED THIRTY PER
 CENTUM OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT PROJECTED TO BE DISBURSED FROM THE GENER-
 AL FUND DURING THE THEN-CURRENT FISCAL  YEAR.  AT  THE  REQUEST  OF  THE

 THE RAINY DAY RESERVE FUND UP TO AND INCLUDING AN AMOUNT  EQUIVALENT  TO
 TWENTY PER CENTUM OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT PROJECTED TO BE DISBURSED FROM

 FER  WOULD INCREASE THE RAINY DAY RESERVE FUND TO AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF
 THIRTY PER CENTUM OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT PROJECTED TO BE DISBURSED FROM
 THE GENERAL FUND DURING THE THEN-CURRENT FISCAL  YEAR,  IN  WHICH  EVENT
 SUCH TRANSFER SHALL BE LIMITED TO SUCH AMOUNT AS WILL INCREASE THE RAINY
 DAY RESERVE FUND TO SUCH THIRTY PER CENTUM LIMITATION.

 OF.  ANY  AMOUNTS  TRANSFERRED  FROM  THE  RAINY DAY RESERVE FUND TO THE
 GENERAL FUND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO ALL THE REPAYMENT  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS
 SECTION.
  4.  ANY TRANSFER AUTHORIZED IN SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION SHALL
 BE REPAID IN CASH WITHIN A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS  AFTER  THE  DATE  THAT

 SION LAPSES, PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT ANY TRANSFER AUTHORIZED AS  A  RESULT
 OF  A  CATASTROPHIC EVENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO REPAYMENT PROVISIONS TO BE
 PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND IMPLEMENTED BY APPROPRIATION OR TRANSFER OF
 FUNDS.
  5. MONEYS IN THE RAINY DAY RESERVE FUND MAY BE TEMPORARILY  LOANED  TO
 THE  GENERAL  FUND DURING ANY FISCAL YEAR IN ANTICIPATION OF THE RECEIPT
