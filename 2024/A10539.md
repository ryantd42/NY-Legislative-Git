 during such calendar year or for such special election] PAY THE FUND THE
 AMOUNT  OF  SUCH  SURPLUS.  Participating  candidates  shall  make  such
 payments not later than twenty-seven days after all liabilities for  the
 election  have  been  paid  and  in any event, not later than the day on
 which the PCFB issues its  final  audit  report  for  the  participating
 candidate's  authorized  committee;  provided, however, that all unspent
 public campaign funds for a participating candidate shall be immediately
 due and payable to the PCFB upon a determination by the  PCFB  that  the
 participant  has delayed the post-election audit. A participating candi-
 date may make post-election expenditures  with  public  funds  only  for
 routine  activities involving nominal [cost] COSTS associated with wind-
 ing up a campaign and responding to the post-election audit. Nothing  in
 this  title  shall  be  construed to prevent a candidate or [his or her]
 SUCH CANDIDATE'S authorized committee from using campaign  contributions
 received from private contributors for otherwise lawful expenditures.
  §  3. This  act shall take effect immediately. Effective immediately,
 the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or  regulation  neces-
 sary  for  the  implementation  of  this  act  on its effective date are
 authorized to be made and completed by the public campaign finance board
 on or before such effective date.
