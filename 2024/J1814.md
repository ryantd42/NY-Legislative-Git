  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 11-15, 2024, as Civic  Learning  Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to highlight
weeks of awareness which draw  attention  to  important  and  beneficial
causes,  and  to  pay tribute to those who have dedicated their time and
energy to generate future  generations  of  informed  and  knowledgeable
students  and  citizens  who  participate actively and pridefully in all
civic matters; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  March  11-15,  2024,  as
Civic Learning Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Civic  engagement includes communities working together or
individuals working alone in both political and non-political actions to
protect public values or make a change in a community; the goal of civic
engagement is to address public concerns and promote the quality of  the
community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Youth  civic  engagement  is  defined as working to make a
difference in the civic  life  of  one's  community;  it  also  involves
developing  the combination of knowledge, skills, values, and motivation
to make that difference; these activities enrich the lives of the  youth
in our State, and are socially beneficial to the community at large; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to the 2006 National Civic and Political Health
Survey, seven percent of 15- to 25-year-old Americans participated in 10
or more community engagement or political activities within the previous
year; and
 
  WHEREAS, Organizations such as  DemocracyReady  NY  believe  in  and
focus  on preparing all New York students for civic participation; their
members include  educators,  academics,  education  stakeholder  groups,
youth  leaders,  civic  education  practitioners,  youth-development
specialists, parents, civic leaders, and advocates; and
 
  WHEREAS, The goals of DemocracyReady NY are to raise awareness about
all the rights of all students to an education that  prepares  them  for
civic  participation,  to  strengthen  state  policy,  practice,  and
investment  to  help  students  develop  the  knowledge,  skills,  and
dispositions  they  need  to  engage  effectively in civic and political
life, today and in the future, and to mobilize the expertise  of  youth,
parents,  guardians,  educators,  researchers,  advocates,  attorneys,
youth-development specialists, and  philanthropy  to  work  collectively
toward these goals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  meaningful  education  equips  young  people with the
knowledge, skills, habits, and experiences they need to build their  own
futures  and  shape  the  futures  of  their communities; securing every
 
child's right to education is  key  to  a  fair  society  and  a  strong
democracy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Civic  engagement  can  take  many  forms,  ranging  from
individual volunteerism to organizational involvement and  to  electoral
participation; it can include efforts to directly address an issue, work
with  others  in  a  community  to solve a problem, or interact with the
institutions of representative democracy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  importance  of  youth  civic  engagement  cannot  be
understated;  the  effects  of such active involvement are unmeasurable,
creating  enduring  change  which  positively  affects  communities,
democracy,  youth  minds,  and  equity across the State and Nation; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 11-15, 2024, as
Civic Learning Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Kathy  Hochul,  Governor  of the State of New York, and
DemocracyReady NY.
