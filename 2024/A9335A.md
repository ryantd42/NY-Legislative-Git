 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to  establishing
  an automatic expunction system for certain records
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent.  On  August  12,  2013,  United  States
 District  Judge  Shira A. Scheindlin issued an order in Floyd v. City of
 New York that found the city of New York had  violated  the  Fourth  and
 Fourteenth  Amendments  by  acting with "deliberate indifference" toward
 the New York City Police Department's (NYPD) practice of  making  suspi-
 cionless  "stops"  and  "frisks"  and  by adopting "a policy of indirect
 racial profiling by targeting racially defined groups" for  "stops"  and
 "frisks". Additionally, a remedial order was issued imposing remedies or
 "reforms"  to the NYPD's "stop and frisk" practices. (959 F.Supp.2d 540,
 562, 668 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)). In a settlement to a lawsuit brought  by  the
 New  York Civil Liberties Union the city was required to delete personal
 information including names  and  addresses  of  individuals  that  were
 stopped,  questioned  and/or frisked. Between January 2004 and June 2012
 the NYPD made 4.4 million stops in which 83% of them were made on  Afri-
 can  Americans  and  Hispanics.  The  legislature finds that any records
 associated with such unconstitutional stops, frisks and arrests shall be
 automatically expunged and notification shall be made to  such  individ-
 uals of such expunction.
  §  2.  The  criminal  procedure law is amended by adding a new section
 160.65 to read as follows:
 § 160.65 NEW YORK CITY STOP AND FRISK AUTOMATIC EXPUNCTION.
  1. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS  SHALL  HAVE  THE
 FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  (A)  "STOP AND FRISK" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS SECTION 140.50 OF
 THIS TITLE.
  (B) "VOIDABLE STOP" SHALL MEAN ANY STOP THAT:
  (I) QUALIFIES AS A STOP AND FRISK;
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 TWELVE BY THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT; AND

  (A) A UF-250 FORM, A STOP, QUESTION AND FRISK REPORT WORKSHEET; OR
  (B)  A  FORM  61  COMPLAINT IN WHICH THE SQF SECTION WAS COMPLETED AND

 UREMENTS, OR ANY OTHER RECORD OF IDENTIFICATION.

 UAL AT THEIR LAST KNOWN ADDRESS OF SUCH EXPUNCTION; AND
  (B) AN AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION MECHANISM FOR ALL LICENSING AGENCIES  TO
 NOTIFY  SUCH THAT SUCH EXPUNCTIONS HAVE OCCURRED AND NO INDIVIDUAL SHALL
 BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH VOIDABLE STOP AND/OR QUALIFIED ARREST.
  4. (A) ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO KNOWINGLY FAILS TO EXPUNGE OR OBLITERATE, OR
 WHO RELEASES INFORMATION ORDERED EXPUNGED, IS GUILTY OF A CLASS A MISDE-
 MEANOR. AN INDIVIDUAL, WHO, KNOWING THE RECORDS ARE EXPUNGED,  USES  THE

 repeal  of  any  rule  or regulation necessary for the implementation of
 this act on its effective date are authorized to be made  and  completed
