  COMMENDING  the  West Indian American Day Carnival
  Association upon the occasion of  hosting  its  2024
  Festival Week and Carnival
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay just tribute to the cultural heritage of  the  ethnic  groups  which
comprise  and  contribute to the richness and diversity of the community
of the State of New York, as well as those organizations and individuals
who work so diligently to perpetuate the valuable practices, events, and
celebrations recognizing such cultural traditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend the West Indian  American  Day  Carnival  Association  upon  the
occasion of hosting its 2024 Festival Week and Carnival in Brooklyn, New
York, from August 29-September 2, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  momentous festival, now known as the West Indian Day
Parade, is a product of Caribbean people  migrating  to  North  America,
bringing  with  them  this set of cultural traditions, combined with the
celebrations put on by former  slaves,  blending  into  a  day  rich  in
heritage and festivity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  the  1920s  in  New York, a Trinidadian immigrant,
Jesse Waddle, began to organize a carnival  celebration  to  take  place
before Lent in February or March; due to New York's cold winter weather,
these celebrations originally occurred indoors at places like the Savoy,
the Renaissance, and the Audubon Ballroom; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Eventually,  the indoor locations became a problem because
of the  confinement  of  the  movement  and  freedom  that  defined  the
carnival;  Jesse  Waddle applied for and received a street parade permit
in the 1940s and shifted the celebrations to  a  warmer  time  of  year,
Labor Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Harlem  permit  was  revoked in 1964 due to a violent
riot; five years later, a  committee  organized  by  Trinidadian  Carlos
Lezama  obtained  another  permit  for  a  parade  on  Eastern  Parkway,
Brooklyn, and the parade has been held at this location since; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the guidance of the West Indian American Day Carnival
Association, the West Indian Day Parade has expanded and grown into  one
of  the  biggest parades in New York City, attracting an astounding four
million spectators and participants from around the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, The parade's artistic and historical value  is  clear,  and
outstanding  costumes  are  recognized  with  various  prizes;  most
importantly, the parade displays participants' pride in  their  country,
heritage,  and  culture,  strengthening  the  diverse  cultural  fabric
representative of our State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
 
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the West Indian  American  Day  Carnival  Association  upon  the
occasion  of  hosting  its  2024  Festival  Week and Carnival; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the West Indian American Day Carnival Association.
