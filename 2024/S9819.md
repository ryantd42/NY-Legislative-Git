 parties,  shall receive an annual payment of $750. Such payment shall be
 a lump sum and paid in a check when payment is made for the payroll that
 includes December 1. Such payment shall be in addition to, and shall not
 be a part of, a member's annual basic salary, and shall  not  affect  or
 impair  any  increments  or other rights or benefits to which the member
 may be entitled; provided, however, that the payment shall  be  included
 as  compensation  for  purposes  of  computation of overtime pay and for
 retirement purposes.
  § 17. Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, any
 employees of the state in the security services unit who are  ineligible
 for  interest  arbitration  and  who are eligible for additional compen-
 sation pursuant to subdivision 5 of section 134 of the civil service law
 shall be deemed ineligible  for  such  additional  compensation  to  the
 extent,  in  the  manner  and  under the circumstances provided for in a
 negotiated agreement on behalf of such employees.
  § 18. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the appro-
 priations contained in this act shall be available to the state for  the
 payment  and  publication  of  grievance and arbitration settlements and
 awards pursuant to articles 7 and 8 of the collective negotiating agree-
 ment between the state and the employee  organization  representing  the
 collective  negotiating  unit  designated  as the security services unit
 established pursuant to article 14 of the civil service law.
  § 19. The salary  increases,  benefit  modifications,  and  any  other
 modifications to terms and conditions of employment provided for by this
 act for state employees in the collective negotiating unit designated as
 the  security  services  unit  established pursuant to article 14 of the
 civil service law shall not be implemented until the director of employ-
 ee relations shall have delivered to the director of the budget and  the
 comptroller a letter certifying that there is in effect, with respect to
 such negotiating unit, a collective negotiating agreement which provides
 for  such  increases  and  modifications, and which is fully executed in
 writing with the state pursuant to article 14 of the civil service  law,
 and  ratified  pursuant  to  the  ratification procedure of the employee
 organization certified pursuant to article 14 of the civil  service  law
 to represent such collective negotiating unit.
  §  20.  Date  of  entitlement  to salary increase. Notwithstanding the
 provisions of this act or of any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the increases in salary or compensation of any members of  the  security
 services  unit  established  pursuant to article 14 of the civil service
 law provided by this act shall be added to the salary of such member  at
 the  beginning  of that payroll period the first day of which is nearest
 to the effective date of such increase as provided in this  act,  or  at
 the  beginning  of  the earlier of two payroll periods the first days of
 which are nearest but  equally  near  to  the  effective  date  of  such
 increase  as  provided  in  this  act;  provided,  however, that for the
 purposes of determining the salary of such unit members  upon  reclassi-
 fication,  reallocation,  appointment,  promotion,  transfer,  demotion,
 reinstatement, or other change of status, such salary increase shall  be
 deemed  to  be  effective on the date thereof as prescribed by this act,
 with payment thereof pursuant to this section on a date  prior  thereto,
 instead  of  on such effective date, and shall not operate to confer any
 additional salary rights or benefits on such unit  members.  Payment  of
 S. 9819  14
 
 such  salary  increase may be deferred pursuant to section twenty-one of
 this act.
  §  21.  Deferred  payment  of  salary  increase.  Notwithstanding  the
 provisions of any other section of this act, or of any other law to  the
 contrary, pending payment pursuant to this act of the basic annual sala-
 ries  and  other compensation to incumbents of positions subject to this
 act, such incumbents shall receive, as partial compensation for services
 rendered, the rate of compensation otherwise payable in their respective
 positions. An incumbent holding a position subject to this  act  at  any
 time  during  the  period  from April 1, 2023, until the time when basic
 annual salaries and other compensation are first paid pursuant  to  this
 act  for  such  services in excess of the compensation actually received
 therefor, shall be entitled to a lump sum  payment  for  the  difference
 between the salary to which such incumbent is entitled for such services
 and  the  compensation actually received therefor in accordance with the
 terms of the agreement between the  employee  organization  representing
 such  members and the state. The amounts paid under this act shall count
 as compensation earned during the year or years for which it  is  calcu-
 lated  and  not as compensation earned wholly in the year in which it is
 paid. Notwithstanding any provision of law, rule, or regulation  to  the
 contrary, no member of the security services unit to whom the provisions
 of  this  act apply shall be entitled to, or owed, any interest or other
 penalty for any reason on any monies due to such member pursuant to  the
 terms  of  this act and the terms of the agreement covering employees in
 the security services unit.
  § 22. Use of appropriations.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  the
 state  finance  law  or  any other provision of law to the contrary, the
 state comptroller is authorized to pay any amounts required  during  the
 fiscal  year commencing April 1, 2023, by the provisions of this act for
 any state department or agency from any  appropriation  or  other  funds
 available to such state department or agency for personal service or for
 other  related  employee benefits during such fiscal year. To the extent
 that such appropriations are insufficient in any fund to accomplish  the
 purposes  herein  set forth, the director of the budget is authorized to

 ations available in any fund, the amounts necessary to pay such amounts.
 The  aforementioned appropriations shall be available for payment of any
 liabilities or obligations incurred prior to April 1, 2024, in  addition
 to current liabilities.

 other provision of law to the contrary, the sum of $252,000,000 is here-
 by appropriated in the general fund/state purposes  account  (10050)  in
 miscellaneous-all  state  departments  and  agencies  solely  for

 state  department  or  agency  in any fund for the period April 1,  2023
 through  March  31,  2025  to  supplement  appropriations  for  personal
 service,  other  than personal service and fringe benefits, and to carry
 out the provisions of this act. No money shall be available for expendi-
 ture from this appropriation until a certificate of  approval  has  been

  § 24. The several amounts as hereinafter set forth, or so much thereof
 as may be necessary, are hereby appropriated from the fund so designated
