 reversed, then, notwithstanding such charges and suspension,  [he]  SUCH
 MEMBER  shall be entitled to full pay from the date of suspension to the

 member  or  members  of  such  police force shall be fined, reprimanded,
 removed or dismissed until written charges  shall  have  been  made  and
 preferred against [him] SUCH MEMBER or them, nor until such charges have
 been investigated, examined, heard and determined by such board of trus-
 tees or municipal board in such manner, procedure, practice, examination
 and  investigation  as such board may by such rules and regulations from
 time to time prescribe, except that the trial of such charges shall  not
