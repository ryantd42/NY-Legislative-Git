  COMMEMORATING  the  10th  Anniversary  of  the CNY
  Memorial Stair Climb on September 7, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  The  memory  of  those  who  lost  their  lives  in  the
unprecedented tragedy which befell our State and Nation on September 11,
2001,  will  forever  remain  with  their families, and will live in the
hearts of every New Yorker and every American; and
 
  WHEREAS, To those who were lost and the loved ones they left behind,
and to those who were there to help, we will never forget; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to commemorate the
10th Anniversary of the CNY Memorial Stair Climb to be held on Saturday,
September 7, 2024, at the New York State Office Building in  Utica,  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  the  morning  of  September 11, 2001, thousands of New
York's Bravest and Finest responded to the terrorist attacks to  perform
the largest rescue and high-rise firefighting operation in history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon their arrival, firefighters climbed the stairs of the
110-story  buildings  in  their  forty  to  sixty  pounds  of  personal
protective  gear plus twenty to thirty pounds of additional firefighting
equipment; Law Enforcement Officers and EMTs  were  right  there  beside
them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Central New York Memorial Stair Climb remembers these
emergency responders who made the ultimate sacrifice  on  September  11,
2001,  during  the  terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center complex,
saving thousands of civilians before the collapse; and
 
  WHEREAS, As a  Memorial  Stair  Climb,  this  honorable  event  pays
tribute  to the fallen first responders while supporting and holding the
surviving family in high esteem; and
 
  WHEREAS, The CNY Memorial Stair Climb is not a race,  but  rather  a
tribute  honoring  the  sacrifices of fallen heroes - both near and far;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Fulfilling a promise to "never forget" their  brothers  and
sisters  who  have  died  in  the line of duty, 343 firefighters, 70 law
enforcement  officers  and  8  EMTs,  the  number  of  firefighters/law
enforcement/EMTs  who  perished  at Ground Zero with the collapse of the
Twin Towers, climb 110 floors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, most climbers wear their  personal  protective
equipment, and all climbers wear the name and picture of a hero they are
climbing in memory of; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of the CNY Memorial Stair Climb is in direct
correlation to the efforts of its Event  Director  and  Founder  Jeffrey
Burkhart, whose involvement is, and always has been, characterized by an
impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
 
standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf  of  the  organization
and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body that when events
of such significance are  brought  to  our  attention,  they  should  be
celebrated  and  recognized  by  all  the  citizens of this great Empire
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  10th  Anniversary  of  the CNY Memorial Stair Climb on
September 7, 2024; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  Jeffrey Burkhart, Event Director and Founder of the CNY
Memorial Stair Climb.
