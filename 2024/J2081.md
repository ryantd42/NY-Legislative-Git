  HONORING  1st  Assistant  Chief  Anthony J. Vulpis
  upon the occasion of  his  designation  for  special
  recognition  after  30 years of dedicated service to
  the Williston Park Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  honor  1st
Assistant  Chief Anthony J. Vulpis, upon the occasion of his designation
for special recognition after 30  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
Williston  Park  Fire  Department,  to  be celebrated at its 97th Annual
Installation and Inspection Dinner and  Dance  on  Saturday,  April  27,
2024, at the Milleridge Cottage in Jericho, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Anthony J. Vulpis has consistently demonstrated a level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity,  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a  member  of the Williston Park Fire Department since
March 1, 1994, Anthony  J.  Vulpis  climbed  the  ranks  to  become  2nd
Lieutenant  of  Company No. 2 (2000-02), 1st Lieutenant of Company No. 2
(2002-03 and 2005-06),  and  Captain  of  Company  No.  2  (2006-10  and
2013-17);  he went on to serve as Warden of Company No. 2 (2018-22), 2nd
Assistant Chief (2022-24), and 1st Assistant Chief (2024-Present); and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others,  and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Anthony J. Vulpis is such a firefighter; throughout his years of devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor 1st Assistant Chief Anthony J. Vulpis upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation  for special recognition after 30 years of dedicated service
to the Williston Park Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to 1st Assistant Chief Anthony J. Vulpis.
