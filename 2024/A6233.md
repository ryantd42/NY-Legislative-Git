 TOR  FOR  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, AND, AS

 THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH THE  UNITED  STATES  SUPREME  COURT'S
 OLMSTEAD  DECISION.  IN  ITS 1999, OLMSTEAD V. L.C. DECISION, THE UNITED
 STATES SUPREME COURT RULED THAT NEW YORK, LIKE ALL STATES, IN ACCORDANCE
 WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA), HAVE  AN  OBLIGATION  TO
 PROVIDE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE MOST INTEGRATED
 SETTING APPROPRIATE TO THEIR NEEDS. A COMPREHENSIVE OLMSTEAD IMPLEMENTA-
 TION  PLAN THAT WILL ADDRESS INTEGRATED HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, TRANSPORTA-
 TION, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND OTHER  IMPORTANT  ISSUES  WILL  AFFIRM  NEW
 YORK'S  POSITION AS A NATIONAL LEADER ON DISABILITY RIGHTS. AS SUCH, THE
 OFFICE OF COMMUNITY LIVING WILL ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY OF CHAIRMANSHIP OF
 THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTINGS COORDINATING COUNCIL. THE OFFICE FOR COMMU-
 NITY LIVING SHALL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING SERVICES THAT  PROMOTE
 AND  ADVOCATE  FOR  INDEPENDENCE  AND  COMMUNITY LIVING FOR PERSONS WITH
 DISABILITIES.
  § 462. DIRECTOR; GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES.  THE  HEAD  OF  THE  OFFICE
 SHALL  BE  THE  DIRECTOR,  WHO SHALL BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR BY AND
 WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE.  THE DIRECTOR SHALL RECEIVE A

 FOR. THE DIRECTOR, SUBJECT TO RULES  PRESCRIBED  BY  THE  GOVERNOR,  MAY
 APPOINT  AND  FIX  THE COMPENSATION OF SUBORDINATES AND EMPLOYEES OF THE
 DIVISION WITHIN THE AMOUNTS APPROPRIATED THEREFOR.
  § 463. ADDITIONAL POWERS OF THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY LIVING. THE OFFICE
 SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL POWERS:
  1. SUBMISSION, REVIEWS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. (A) EACH  DIVISION  WITHIN
 THE  EXECUTIVE  DEPARTMENT  AND ALL OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE SHALL
 SUBMIT TO THE  OFFICE  FOR  REVIEW  PROPOSED  LEGISLATION,  REGULATIONS,
 ORDERS  AND PLANS WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE LIVES OR WELL-BEING
 OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE STATE. SUCH MATTERS  SHALL,  IN  THE
 CASE OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION, BE SUBMITTED AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO

  §  464.  MOST  INTEGRATED SETTING COORDINATING COUNCIL. 1. LEGISLATIVE
 FINDINGS AND INTENT. THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES  ACT  REQUIRES  THE
 STATE  OF  NEW  YORK TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WITH DISABILITIES
 RESIDE AND FUNCTION  IN  THE  MOST  INTEGRATED  SETTING  POSSIBLE.  THIS
 REQUIREMENT  WAS  RECOGNIZED AND UPHELD BY THE SUPREME COURT IN THE CASE
 OF OLMSTEAD, COMMISSIONER, GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES, ET AL.
 V. L.C., BY ZIMRING, GUARDIAN AD LITEM AND NEXT FRIEND, ET AL.  (138  F.
 3D  893).  WHILE  THE  STATE OF NEW YORK PROVIDES COMMUNITY SUPPORTS FOR
 PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WITH DISABILITIES AND WHILE THE  STATE  OF  NEW  YORK
 DOES  OPERATE  A  HOME  AND COMMUNITY-BASED WAIVER MEDICAID PROGRAM, THE
 LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS THAT THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAS  NO  CENTRALIZED
 MECHANISM  IN  PLACE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WITH
 DISABILITIES ARE RESIDING IN THE MOST INTEGRATED  SETTING  POSSIBLE.  IN
 ORDER  TO  ENSURE  THAT  THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE
 REQUIREMENTS OF THE OLMSTEAD DECISION, THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS THAT
 IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO DEVELOP  AND  IMPLEMENT  A
