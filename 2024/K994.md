BY: M. of A. Burdick
 
  CONGRATULATING  Cedric  Dell  upon the occasion of
  receiving the distinguished rank of Eagle Scout, the
  most prestigious of Scouting honors
 
  WHEREAS, Cedric Dell, through his diligence  and  rigorous  efforts,
has  achieved Scouting's highest and most prestigious rank, Eagle Scout;
the Eagle Court of Honor ceremony will be held at Our  Lady  of  Sorrows
Church in White Plains, New York, on Saturday, April 6, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cedric Dell is a member of Boy Scouts of America Troop 73,
part of the Greater Hudson Valley Council, in White  Plains,  New  York;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  America has achieved her greatest heights of glory through
the dedication, determination, and tireless efforts of  the  outstanding
citizens of this Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is only with the continued diligence and devotion of our
youth, tomorrow's leaders, that America will maintain her glory; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Boy Scouts of America and its members are dedicated to
the development of character and leadership in the youth of this Nation;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The highest achievement of leadership in  Scouting,  earned
by  approximately  five  percent of all Boy Scouts, is the distinguished
rank of Eagle Scout; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  outstanding  17-year-old  student  of  German
International  School of New York has been involved in Scouting for many
years, has lived up to Scouting's ideals, and has attained  all  of  the
necessary  achievements,  including  completion  of  a community service
project, which was successfully planned, developed, and executed; and
 
  WHEREAS, In September of 2023, Cedric Dell contributed his time  and
hard  work  to complete his project for the Pre-Kindergarten students of
the Bronxville Montessori School in Yonkers, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The project required designing, building, and  staining  of
two  wooden  planter  boxes  intended to beautify the entranceway of the
school, replacing the existing ones; a larger planter box was  installed
behind the school at the Head of School's request, providing an area for
the  students  to  learn  the  fundamentals  of  gardening  by  planting
vegetables and herbs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thoughtfully planning, Cedric Dell ensured  the  height  of
the  garden  planter  was accessible for the small caretakers and filled
with soil so the gardening project could commence immediately; and
 
  WHEREAS, At the front of the school, there was  limited  seating  in
the  playground  area; Cedric Dell designed and built two stained wooden
benches for the comfort of students, parents, and teachers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Most of the Scouts in Troop 73, several Troop Leaders,  and
parents assisted Cedric Dell with building, assembling, and transporting
the  planters and benches, cooperatively enhancing the aesthetics of the
Bronxville Montessori School for many years to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cedric  Dell's perseverance in rising through the ranks to
Eagle Scout is a strong indication of his ability  to  master  difficult
tasks;  his  accomplishment will enable him to emerge as a leader, fully
equipped to meet the challenges of today's complex society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cedric Dell's dedication to the well-being of the  citizens
of  White Plains is represented through his project and demonstrates his
devotion to both community and commitment to others; and
 
  WHEREAS, This new Eagle Scout is a credit to his family, his school,
his community, his State, and his Nation; undoubtedly, his  future  will
be  filled  with accomplishments of equal importance; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations,  in
recognition  of  the  significance  of  this meritorious achievement, to
congratulate and honor Cedric Dell on achieving the rank of Eagle Scout;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Cedric Dell.
