BY: Senator MAYER
 
  COMMENDING  the Boys & Girls Club of New Rochelle,
  New York, upon the occasion of celebrating its  95th
  Anniversary on April 12, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
youth of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  the  Boys  &  Girls  Club  of New Rochelle upon the occasion of
celebrating its 95th Anniversary to be  celebrated  at  its  Anniversary
Gala at the Remington Clubhouse on Friday, April 12, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  November  of 1929, the Boys & Girls Club (called Boys'
Club originally) was established by the community of New  Rochelle,  New
York,  with the purpose of aiding the children of the families that were
devastated by the Stock Market Crash and  subsequent  Great  Depression;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  this  tumultuous  part of our history, many of the
country's youth had little food to eat or clothing to wear, and numerous
children were forced to abandon their education and obtain  jobs,  which
were  not always available, to assist in providing necessities for their
households; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New Rochelle community acknowledged its  obligation  to
the future generations of this State and Nation and decided to provide a
resource that would accommodate the requirements to produce well-rounded
and successful citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  statement,  "To  enable  all young people, especially
those who need us most, to reach their  full  potential  as  productive,
caring,  responsible  citizens,"  became the mission of the Boys & Girls
Club of New Rochelle; over time, this undertaking has aided thousands of
youths  from  all  races  and  creeds  and  produced  successful  and
community-minded adults; and
 
  WHEREAS, The original meeting place of the Boys & Girls Club was the
old  Washington  School building; through the years, this youth-centered
organization's transformation has continually  progressed  to  meet  the
needs  of  not  only  the children but also the entire community; as the
demands of the populace increased, the organization expanded; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the early 1940s, the South Side Unit was opened  in  the
basement of the old Jefferson School; in 1953, due to the dedication and
fundraising  of  the  Remington Women's Auxiliary Club and the Remington
Advisory Board, a portion of the existing facility was built; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1972, the Charles Hayden Foundation and the City of  New
Rochelle  granted  the funding that afforded the Women's Auxiliary Club,
 
along with  other  community  members,  the  plausibility  of  adding  a
gymnasium, game room, showers, locker room, and office was realized; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1983, the South Side Unit moved to a new building; the
Respect Extension was opened at the MacLeay Apartment Complex, which was
owned by the New Rochelle Neighborhood  Revitalization  Corporation,  in
2001; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Three  years  later, the Boys & Girls Club of New Rochelle
expanded further to meet the changing needs of the youth  by  partnering
with  the Board of Education, providing after-school programs as part of
the 21st Century Program, a federally funded grant under  the  No  Child
Left  Behind  initiative,  at the Isaac E. Young Middle School; in 2006,
the South Side Unit unified with the A. E. Mascaro Unit; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2007, in partnership with Iona College, the New Rochelle
School District, and other organizations in the community, a new program
for youth, Readiness thru  Integrated  Service  Engagement  (RISE),  was
established  to  accommodate  the  needs  of middle school children; the
following year, this alliance with the school  district  instituted  the
Safe  Schools  grant,  which  provides programs for teens, and the SHAPE
grant, which focuses on fitness, broadening the outreach of services  to
the younger generation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  September  of  2008,  the Boys & Girls Club opened its
first school-based site at Trinity Elementary  School,  followed  by  an
after-school  program at Ward Elementary School; January of 2013 ushered
in a new affiliation between the Boys & Girls Club and New Rochelle High
School, launching an after-school program for teens; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Boys  &  Girls  Club  has  provided  opportunities  for
leadership  development,  community  outreach,  and  overall  personal
development for their young people; many members have become  volunteers
and served on the Board of Directors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The success of the Boys & Girls Club of New Rochelle is in
direct correlation to the efforts of its members, whose involvement  is,
and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an impressive commitment, an
unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard  of  excellence  in
all  endeavors  on behalf of the Board of Directors, the Remington Men's
Club, Remington Women's Auxiliary Club, staff members,  and  volunteers,
serving approximately 1,200 members per year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Boys & Girls Club  of  New  Rochelle,  New  York,  upon  the
occasion  of celebrating its 95th Anniversary, and to honor its members,
past and present, who have labored  so  conscientiously  to  secure  and
improve  the  quality  of life for the youth of the community; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Boys & Girls Club.
