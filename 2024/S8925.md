 AN ACT in relation to establishing a temporary commission to reform tier
  VI status in the  New  York  state  and  local  employees'  retirement
  system; and providing for the repeal of such provisions upon the expi-
  ration thereof

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that the enact-
 ment of chapter 18 of the laws of  2012  has  caused  severe  employment
 recruitment  and  retention  shortages throughout the New York state and
 local public workforce. These shortages have caused  massive  reductions
 in  the  size of the public workforce, significant increases in overtime
 costs, and unacceptable delays to the citizens of the state.
  Further, New York state and local governments also face a coming  wave
 of  retirements, with over one-quarter of the current workforce eligible
 to retire in the next five years. These retirements will further exacer-
 bate worker shortages and overtime costs to unsustainable levels.
  It is incumbent on the state to proactively  address  these  near-term
 workforce management challenges to maintain acceptable levels of govern-
 ment service delivery to all New York state residents.
  §  2.  Temporary  state commission to reform tier VI status in the New
 York state and local employees' retirement system. 1. A temporary  state
 commission is hereby created to reform and improve tier VI status in the
 New York state and local employees' retirement system.
  2.  The  commission  shall consist of nine members, to be appointed as
 follows: five shall be appointed by the governor; one shall be appointed
 by the temporary president of the senate; one shall be appointed by  the
 minority  leader of the senate; one shall be appointed by the speaker of
 the assembly; and one shall be appointed by the minority leader  of  the
 assembly.
  3.  The commission may employ and at pleasure remove such personnel as
 it may deem necessary for the performance of its functions and fix their
 compensation within the amounts made available therefor.

  4. The commission may meet within and without the state, shall hold at
 least three public hearings, and shall have all the powers of a legisla-
 tive committee pursuant to the legislative law.
  5.  The  members  of  the commission shall receive no compensation for
 their services, but shall be allowed their actual and necessary expenses
 incurred in the performance of their duties hereunder.
  6. To the maximum extent feasible, the commission shall be entitled to
 request and receive and shall utilize and be provided with such  facili-
 ties,  resources,  and  data  of any court, department, division, board,
 bureau, commission, or agency of the state or any political  subdivision
 thereof  as  it  may reasonably request to properly carry out its powers
 and duties hereunder.
  7. No later than one year after the effective date of  this  act,  the
 commission  shall  submit  a final report to the governor, the temporary
 president of the senate, and the speaker of the assembly containing  its
 findings,  conclusions,  and recommendations for reforming and improving
 tier VI status in the New York state  and  local  employees'  retirement
 system.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect immediately and shall expire and be
 deemed repealed 1 year after such date.
