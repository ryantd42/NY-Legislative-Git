 qualified production costs (excluding post  production  costs)  paid  or
 incurred  which  are attributable to the use of tangible property or the
 performance of services at a qualified film production facility  in  the
 production  of  such qualified film equal or exceed seventy-five percent
 of the production  costs  (excluding  post  production  costs)  paid  or
 incurred  which  are attributable to the use of tangible property or the
 performance of services at any film production facility within and with-
