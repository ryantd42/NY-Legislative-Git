  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2024, as Cyber Security Awareness  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim October 2024, as Cyber
Security Awareness Month in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with
the observance of National Cyber Security Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cyber Security is the mechanism that maximizes our ability
to grow commerce, communications, community and content in  a  connected
world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM), observed
each October, was created as a collaborative effort  between  government
and  industry  to  ensure every American has the resources to stay safer
and more secure online; and
 
  WHEREAS, NCSAM was established in 2004, under  leadership  from  the
United  States  Department  of  Homeland Security and the National Cyber
Security Alliance; since its inception, NCSAM has  grown  exponentially,
reaching  consumers,  small  and  medium-sized businesses, corporations,
educational institutions and young people across the nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is critical for anyone using the internet to continually
learn about  and  consistently  practice  good  cyber  security  habits;
organizations  must  also  implement  a  plan  for  employee  education,
training and awareness that emphasizes risk management,  resistance  and
resilience; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Realizing  the full potential of our ever-evolving digital
lives can only happen when a  culture  of  cyber  security  and  privacy
serves as the foundation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be done to increase  activity  at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  October  2024,  as  Cyber
Security Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
