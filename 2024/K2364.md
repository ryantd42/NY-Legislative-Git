  CONGRATULATING  Luke  Montano upon the occasion of
  receiving the distinguished rank of Eagle Scout, the
  most prestigious of Scouting honors
 
  WHEREAS, Luke Montano, through his diligence and  rigorous  efforts,
has  achieved Scouting's highest and most prestigious rank, Eagle Scout;
the Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony will be held at the  New  Castle
Community Center in Chappaqua, New York, on Sunday, June 23, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Luke Montano is a member of Boy Scouts of America Troop 2,
in Chappaqua, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, America has achieved her greatest heights of glory  through
the  dedication,  determination, and tireless efforts of the outstanding
citizens of this Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is only with the continued diligence and devotion of our
youth, tomorrow's leaders, that America will maintain her glory; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Boy Scouts of America and its members are dedicated  to
the development of character and leadership in the youth of this Nation;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  highest achievement of leadership in Scouting, earned
by approximately five percent of all Boy Scouts,  is  the  distinguished
rank of Eagle Scout; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  outstanding  young man has been involved in Scouting
for many years, has lived up to Scouting's ideals, and has attained  all
the  necessary achievements, including completion of a community service
project, which was successfully planned, developed, and executed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Luke Montano contributed his time and hard work to complete
his project for the First Congregational Church of Chappaqua; and
 
  WHEREAS, For his Scouting project, Luke Montano, with the assistance
of other Scouts under his leadership, dismantled an existing  fence  and
constructed  a split-rail fence with a gate; this enclosure's purpose is
the safety of the church's nursery school playground; the  Scouts  lined
the entire fence with mesh material for the children's security; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Luke  Montano's  perseverance in rising through the ranks,
from Cub Scout in 2014 to Eagle Scout  ten  years  later,  is  a  strong
indication  of his ability to master difficult tasks; his accomplishment
will enable him to emerge as  a  leader,  fully  equipped  to  meet  the
challenges of today's complex society; and
 
  WHEREAS, Luke Montano's dedication to the well-being of the citizens
of  Chappaqua  is  represented  through  his  devotion  to community and
commitment to others; he has spent several summers as a camper  and  has
worked  as  a  lifeguard  at  Camp  Read  in New York State's Adirondack
Region; and
 
  WHEREAS, This new Eagle Scout is a credit to his family, his school,
his community, his State, and his Nation; undoubtedly, his  future  will
be  filled  with accomplishments of equal importance; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations, in
recognition of the significance  of  this  meritorious  achievement,  to
congratulate  and  honor  Luke  Montano  on  achieving the rank of Eagle
Scout; and be it further
