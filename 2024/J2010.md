  WHEREAS, Dr. Hari Krishna Shukla has dedicated himself to finding  a
solution  to safely administer lifesaving care to babies born premature;

  WHEREAS, This new formula Dr. Hari Krishna  Shukla  created  for  an
umbilical  venous catheter (UVC) has been recognized and used worldwide;

teaching settings from Johns Hopkins to Harvard University; in 2018, the
National  Institute  of  Health cited that Dr. Shukla's formula achieved
"optimum UVC tip position" and the formula was 84% accurate compared  to
the only 57% accuracy achieved through other methods; and

demonstrating compassion in all facets of his life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rare indeed  is  the  impressive  dedication  shown  by  an
individual  for  the benefit of others which Dr. Hari Krishna Shukla has
displayed throughout his life; and

of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
