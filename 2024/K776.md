Assembly Resolution No. 776
 
BY: M. of A. Shimsky
 
  COMMENDING  Dr. Louis E. Brus upon the occasion of
  his designation as recipient of the Nobel  Prize  in
  Chemistry
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their
profession,  certainly  have  earned the recognition and applause of all
the citizens of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Dr. Louis E. Brus  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient  of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Sunday, December 10, 2023;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Alfred Nobel believed that people are capable of helping to
improve society through knowledge,  science,  and  humanism,  so,  as  a
result,  he  created the Nobel Prize to reward the discoveries that have
conferred the greatest benefit to humankind; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has been awarded in  the  field
of  physics,  chemistry,  physiology or medicine, literature, and peace,
with a memorial prize in economic sciences being added in 1968; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dr. Louis E. Brus, following time  at  Rice  University  in
Houston,  Texas,  continued  to  pursue  post-graduate research; with an
early interest in chemistry, he began his doctoral studies  at  Columbia
University  in  New  York,  where  he  diligently  worked  on his thesis
alongside mentor Richard Bersohn  on  the  photodissociation  of  sodium
iodide vapor; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  receiving  his  Doctorate  in Physical Chemistry in
1969, Dr.  Louis E. Brus entered the Navy as a lieutenant and served  as
a  scientific  staff  officer  at  the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington D.C.; he and his colleagues studied which gases and reactions
produced the best conditions for the use of  infrared  chemical  lasers;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  leaving  to  work  at  the  company  AT&T  Bell
Laboratories, Dr.  Louis E. Brus' focus shifted to gaining a fundamental
understanding of energy  flows  in  solids,  specifically,  how  excited
electronic  energy  becomes  vibrational  and  heat energy over time; he
worked  initially  on  the  electronic  relaxation  dynamics  of  small
molecules  trapped in rare gas matrices near 4 degrees K, then developed
time resolved Raman  spectroscopy,  and  this  led  to  an  interest  in
colloidal metallic and semiconducting nanocrystals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  metallic  nanocrystal research led to single molecule
SERS  and  photocatalysis  on  silver  particles;  the  semiconducting
nanocrystal  work  led  to quantum size effects and colloidal core/shell
qdot chemical synthesis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  work  on  colloidal  semiconductor  nanocrystals,  or
quantum  dots,  that  led  to his being recognized as one of the leading
researchers in the field of nanoscience began in the early 1980s when he
began studying liquids at room temperature;  a  key  discovery  came  in
1983, when he noticed how conductivity changed with the particle size of
materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Dr.  Louis  E.  Brus  returned to Columbia University as a
professor in 1996, where he still does important work  today;  here,  he
explored  optical  properties  and  Rayleigh scattering of single carbon
nanotubes, and this led to optical characterization of  charge  transfer
and Raman scattering by molecules adsorbed on few layer graphenes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Most  recently, Dr. Louis E. Brus explored the liquid-like
relaxation  dynamics  of  lead  halide  perovskite  crystals  at  room
temperature, and is driven to understand the behavior of electrons; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  recipient  of  numerous  awards and accolades for his
fundamental  research  contributions,  Dr.  Louis  E.  Brus  has  been
recognized  in  recent  years with the Irving Langmuir Prize in Chemical
Physics from the American Physical Society in 2001, election to the U.S.
National Academy  of  Sciences  in  2004,  and  the  2005  Chemistry  of
Materials  Prize  from the American Chemical Society; now, most notably,
Dr. Louis E. Brus has justly received the internationally-esteemed Nobel
Prize in Chemistry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Dr. Louis E. Brus  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Dr. Louis E. Brus.
