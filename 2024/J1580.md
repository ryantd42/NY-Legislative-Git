  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 21, 2024, as Acute Myeloid Leukemia Day in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set  aside  to  increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 21, 2024,  as  Acute
Myeloid Leukemia Day (AML) in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of AML World Awareness Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  AML  World  Awareness  Day is the one day of the year that
people from all around  the  world  can  come  together  to  help  raise
awareness  of  this  cancer and tell the world that AML is a cancer that
cannot be ignored; and
 
  WHEREAS, AML is a rare aggressive  cancer  of  the  blood  and  bone
marrow; it is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Normally,  blood  cells are made from stem cells (immature
cells) in the bone marrow which is the soft inner part of the bone; and
 
  WHEREAS, A blood stem cell can become either a myeloid stem cell  or
a  lymphoid  stem  cell;  a myeloid stem cell in healthy bone marrow can
give rise to three different mature types of cells which  together  make
up  the  blood; these include: red blood cells - they give blood its red
color and are responsible for carrying oxygen  from  the  lungs  to  all
parts  of  the  body;  white  blood  cells  -  they fight infections and
disease; and platelets - they help blood to clot and  prevent  bleeding;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  AML, there is an abnormal production of one or more of
these blood cells in the bone marrow  due  to  certain  changes  in  the
genetic material (DNA); these are called genetic abnormalities; and
 
  WHEREAS, These abnormal cells are called leukemia cells and can fill
up  the  bone  marrow and spill into the blood, where they can spread to
parts of the body including the brain, skin, spleen and gums; and
 
  WHEREAS, As a result,  the  production  of  normal  blood  cells  is
affected,  and  the  bone marrow cannot make enough healthy blood cells;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The most common signs and symptoms of AML include shortness
of breath,  bruising,  fever,  weakness,  and  infection;  usually,  AML
develops quickly and becomes worse unless it is treated; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 21, 2024,  as  Acute
Myeloid Leukemia Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
