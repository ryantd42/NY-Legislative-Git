 FOLLOWING:  1.  ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE FEDERAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE
 CONTROL AND PREVENTION AS REPORTED IN THE  YEAR  TWO  THOUSAND  SIXTEEN,
 SUICIDE  IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS
 TEN TO TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE, INCLUSIVE, IN BOTH  THE  UNITED  STATES
 AND IN NEW YORK STATE.
  2.  AS  CHILDREN  AND  TEENS SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THEIR YOUNG
 LIVES IN SCHOOL, THE PERSONNEL WHO INTERACT WITH THEM ON A  DAILY  BASIS
 ARE  ESSENTIAL  GATEKEEPERS FOR RECOGNIZING WARNING SIGNS OF SUICIDE AND
 MAKING THE APPROPRIATE REFERRALS FOR HELP.
  3. IN A NATIONAL SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE JASON FOUNDATION,  A  TEACHER
 WAS  IDENTIFIED AS THE NUMBER ONE PERSON TO WHOM A STUDENT WOULD TURN TO
 HELP A FRIEND WHO MIGHT BE SUICIDAL. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WHEN A  YOUNG

 PERSON  COMES  TO  A  TEACHER  FOR HELP, SUCH TEACHER HAS THE KNOWLEDGE,
 TOOLS, AND RESOURCES TO RESPOND CORRECTLY.
  4.  IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN, THE FEDERAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE
 CONTROL AND PREVENTION FOUND IN ITS  YOUTH  RISK  BEHAVIOR  SURVEY  THAT
 LESBIAN,  GAY,  AND  BISEXUAL YOUTH ARE ALMOST FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO
