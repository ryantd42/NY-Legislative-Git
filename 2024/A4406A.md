  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The state finance law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 163-e to read as follows:
  §  163-E.  PROCUREMENT  GOALS FOR NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS. 1. FOR
 THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOW-
 ING MEANINGS:
  (A) "NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCT" SHALL MEAN A FOOD OR DRINK ITEM THAT
 IS:
  (I) GROWN, HARVESTED, OR PRODUCED IN THIS STATE;

 PERCENT AGRICULTURAL RAW MATERIALS GROWN, HARVESTED, OR PRODUCED IN THIS

 GOVERNOR HAS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY, INCLUDING ALL  OFFICES  AND  DIVISIONS

 PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY. STATE  AGENCY  SHALL  INCLUDE
 THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AND THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK.
  2.  (A) IN ORDER TO CREATE, STRENGTHEN, AND EXPAND LOCAL FARM AND FOOD
 ECONOMIES THROUGHOUT NEW YORK, ALL STATE AGENCIES ANNUALLY  SPENDING  AN
 AMOUNT  EXCEEDING  FIFTY  THOUSAND  DOLLARS  ON  FOOD PRODUCTS SHALL SET
 PERCENTAGE GOALS FOR NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS PURCHASED  YEARLY  AND
 IF  A STATE AGENCY SPENDS AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO TWO MILLION
 DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON FOOD PRODUCTS THEN:
  (I) ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND  TWENTY-FIVE,  AT
 LEAST FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ALL FOOD PRODUCTS PURCHASED BY SUCH STATE AGEN-
 CY SHALL BE NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS;
  (II)  ON  OR BEFORE DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX, AT
 LEAST TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL FOOD PRODUCTS PURCHASED BY SUCH STATE AGENCY
 SHALL BE NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS;
  (III) ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-SEVEN,
 AT  LEAST  TWENTY-FIVE  PERCENT  OF  ALL FOOD PRODUCTS PURCHASED BY SUCH
 STATE AGENCY SHALL BE NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS; AND
  (IV) ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER THIRTY-FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-EIGHT AND
 THEREAFTER, AT LEAST THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL FOOD  PRODUCTS  PURCHASED  BY
 SUCH STATE AGENCY SHALL BE NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS.
  (B) TO MEET THE GOAL SET FORTH IN THIS SUBDIVISION, WHEN A STATE AGEN-
 CY'S  CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE OF FOOD PRODUCTS IS TO BE AWARDED TO THE
 LOWEST RESPONSIBLE  BIDDER,  AN  OTHERWISE  QUALIFIED  BIDDER  WHO  WILL
 FULFILL THE CONTRACT THROUGH THE USE OF NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS MAY
 BE  GIVEN PREFERENCE OVER OTHER BIDDERS, PROVIDED THAT THE COST INCLUDED
 IN THE BID OF NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS IS NOT MORE THAN TEN  PERCENT
 GREATER  THAN  THE COST INCLUDED IN A BID THAT IS NOT FOR NEW YORK STATE
 FOOD PRODUCTS.
  3. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY IF THE HEAD  OF  THE
 CONTRACTING  STATE  AGENCY  PURCHASING FOOD PRODUCTS, IN HIS OR HER SOLE
 DISCRETION, DETERMINES THAT: (A) PURCHASING NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS
 PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION  WOULD  BE
 AGAINST THE PUBLIC INTEREST; (B) PURCHASING NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS
 WOULD  INCREASE  THE COST OF THE CONTRACT BY AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT; (C)
 NEW YORK STATE FOOD  PRODUCTS  CANNOT  BE  OBTAINED  IN  SUFFICIENT  AND
 REASONABLE  AVAILABLE QUANTITIES AND OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY TO MEET THE
 CONTRACTING STATE AGENCY'S REQUIREMENTS; OR (D) PURCHASING FOOD PRODUCTS
 GROWN, HARVESTED, OR PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THIS  STATE,  OR  PROCESSED  IN
 FACILITIES  INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THIS STATE COMPRISING LESS THAN  FIFTY-
 ONE PERCENT AGRICULTURAL RAW MATERIALS GROWN, HARVESTED, OR PRODUCED  IN
 THIS  STATE,  BY  WEIGHT OR VOLUME, IS NECESSARY TO AVOID A DELAY IN THE
 DELIVERY OF FOOD PRODUCTS.
  4. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE  CONSTRUED  TO  CONFLICT  WITH  OR
 OTHERWISE  LIMIT  THE  GOALS  AND  REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH BY SECTION ONE
 HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO OF THIS ARTICLE AND ARTICLES FIFTEEN-A AND SEVENTEEN-B
 OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW. ANY CONTRACTS MEETING THE GOALS  AND  REQUIREMENTS
 SET  FORTH  BY  THIS  SECTION,  IN ADDITION TO REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH BY
 SECTION ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO OF THIS ARTICLE AND/OR ARTICLES  FIFTEEN-A
 AND SEVENTEEN-B OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW, SHALL BE COUNTED TOWARD ALL APPLI-
 CABLE GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS IT MAY SATISFY.
  5.  THE COMMISSIONER, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF AGRICUL-
 TURE AND MARKETS SHALL PERIODICALLY,  BUT  NO  LATER  THAN  EVERY  THREE
 YEARS, REVIEW THE NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCT GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS SET
 FORTH BY SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION, AND SHALL ISSUE A JOINT RECOM-
 MENDATION  SUGGESTING  ANY CHANGES IN SUCH GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS DEEMED
