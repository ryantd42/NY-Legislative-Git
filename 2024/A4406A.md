 AN ACT to amend the state  finance  law,  in  relation  to  establishing
  procurement  goals for the purchase of New York state food products by

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  state finance law is amended by adding a new section
 163-c to read as follows:
  § 163-C. PROCUREMENT GOALS FOR NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS. 1.  DEFI-
 NITION.  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE TERM "NEW YORK STATE FOOD
 PRODUCT" SHALL MEAN A FOOD ITEM THAT IS:
  (A) GROWN, HARVESTED, OR PRODUCED IN THIS STATE; OR
  (B) PROCESSED INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THIS STATE COMPRISING  OVER  FIFTY-ONE
 PERCENT AGRICULTURAL RAW MATERIALS GROWN, HARVESTED, OR PRODUCED IN THIS
 STATE, BY WEIGHT OR VOLUME.
  2.  (A) IN ORDER TO CREATE, STRENGTHEN, AND EXPAND LOCAL FARM AND FOOD
 ECONOMIES THROUGHOUT NEW YORK, ALL STATE AGENCIES ANNUALLY  SPENDING  AN
 AMOUNT  EXCEEDING  FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON FOOD OR FOOD PRODUCTS SHALL
 SET PERCENTAGE GOALS FOR NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS  PURCHASED  YEARLY
 AND  IF  A  STATE  AGENCY  SPENDS AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO TWO
 MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON FOOD OR FOOD PRODUCTS THEN:  IN  THE  FIRST
 AND  SECOND  YEAR  AFTER  THE  EFFECTIVE  DATE OF THIS SECTION, AT LEAST
 FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ALL FOOD AND FOOD PRODUCTS PURCHASED  BY  SUCH  STATE
 AGENCY  SHALL  BE  NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS; IN THE THIRD YEAR AFTER
 THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION, AT LEAST TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL  FOOD

 A. 4406  2
 
 FOOD  PRODUCTS  PURCHASED  BY  SUCH STATE AGENCY SHALL BE NEW YORK STATE
 FOOD PRODUCTS.
  (B) TO MEET THE GOAL SET FORTH IN THIS SUBDIVISION, WHEN A STATE AGEN-
 CY'S CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE OF FOOD OR FOOD PRODUCTS IS TO BE AWARDED
 TO THE LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDER, AN OTHERWISE QUALIFIED BIDDER WHO WILL
 FULFILL THE CONTRACT THROUGH THE USE OF NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS MAY
 BE  GIVEN PREFERENCE OVER OTHER BIDDERS, PROVIDED THAT THE COST INCLUDED
 IN THE BID OF NEW YORK STATE FOOD PRODUCTS IS NOT MORE THAN TEN  PERCENT
 GREATER  THAN  THE COST INCLUDED IN A BID THAT IS NOT FOR NEW YORK STATE
 FOOD PRODUCTS.
  3. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY IF THE HEAD  OF  THE
 CONTRACTING STATE AGENCY PURCHASING FOOD OR FOOD PRODUCTS, IN HIS OR HER
 SOLE  DISCRETION, DETERMINES THAT: (A) PURCHASING NEW YORK STATE FOOD OR
 FOOD PRODUCTS PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS  IN  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS
 SECTION  WOULD  BE  AGAINST THE PUBLIC INTEREST; (B) PURCHASING NEW YORK
 STATE FOOD OR FOOD PRODUCTS WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF THE  CONTRACT  BY
 AN  UNREASONABLE  AMOUNT;  (C)  NEW  YORK  STATE FOOD PRODUCTS CANNOT BE
 OBTAINED IN SUFFICIENT AND REASONABLE AVAILABLE QUANTITIES AND OF SATIS-
 FACTORY QUALITY TO MEET THE CONTRACTING STATE AGENCY'S REQUIREMENTS;  OR
 (D)  PURCHASING  FOOD  OR  FOOD  PRODUCTS  GROWN, HARVESTED, OR PRODUCED
 OUTSIDE OF THIS STATE, OR FOOD PROCESSED IN FACILITIES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE
 OF THIS STATE COMPRISING LESS THAN  FIFTY-ONE PERCENT  AGRICULTURAL  RAW
 MATERIALS  GROWN,  HARVESTED,  OR  PRODUCED  IN THIS STATE, BY WEIGHT OR
 VOLUME, IS NECESSARY TO AVOID A DELAY IN THE DELIVERY OF  FOOD  OR  FOOD
 PRODUCTS.
  4.  NOTHING  IN  THIS  SECTION  SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO CONFLICT WITH OR
 OTHERWISE LIMIT THE GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS  SET  FORTH  BY  SECTION  ONE
 HUNDRED  SIXTY-TWO OF THE THIS ARTICLE AND ARTICLES FIFTEEN-A AND SEVEN-
 TEEN-B OF THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW.  ANY  CONTRACTS  MEETING  THE  GOALS  AND
 REQUIREMENTS  SET FORTH BY THIS SECTION, IN ADDITION TO REQUIREMENTS SET
 FORTH BY SECTION ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO OF THIS ARTICLE  AND/OR  ARTICLES
 FIFTEEN-A  AND SEVENTEEN-B OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW, SHALL BE COUNTED TOWARD
 ALL APPLICABLE GOALS AND REQUIREMENTS IT MAY SATISFY.
  5. THE COMMISSIONER, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF  AGRICUL-
 TURE  AND  MARKETS  SHALL  PERIODICALLY,  BUT  NO LATER THAN EVERY THREE
 YEARS, REVIEW THE NEW  YORK  STATE  FOOD  AND  FOOD  PRODUCT  GOALS  AND
 REQUIREMENTS  SET  FORTH  BY  SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION, AND SHALL
 ISSUE A JOINT RECOMMENDATION SUGGESTING ANY CHANGES IN  SUCH  GOALS  AND
 REQUIREMENTS DEEMED NECESSARY. SUCH RECOMMENDATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO
 THE  GOVERNOR, THE TEMPORARY PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, AND THE SPEAKER OF
 THE ASSEMBLY.
  §  2. Paragraph g of subdivision 4 of section 165 of the state finance
 law, as amended by chapter 533 of the laws of 2013, is amended  to  read
 as follows:
  g.  No  later  than December first of each year the commissioner shall

 this subdivision. Such report shall include, at minimum:
  (i) a description of the office's efforts to improve and increase  the
 tracking  of  information  relating  to  New York state food procured by

  (III)  AN  ANNUAL  SUMMARY  DETAILING  EACH STATE AGENCY CONTRACT MADE
