  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 2024, as Reading Month in  the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside to increase awareness of  initiatives
which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim March 2024, as Reading
Month in the State of New York, in conjunction with  the  observance  of
National Reading Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  25  Million  children  in  the  United  States do not have
proficient reading skills; and
 
  WHEREAS, Reading  proficiency  levels  amongst  4th  and  8th  Grade
students as of 2022 in New York were approximately the same as they were
in  1998, with 42% of 4th Graders below the basic proficiency levels and
30% of 8th Graders below the basic proficiency levels; and
 
  WHEREAS, A vital issue that needs to be addressed, 3.9  Million  New
York  State residents lack a functional level of literacy; with economic
situations causing a lack of resources, 43% of adults  with  the  lowest
levels of literacy live at or below the poverty line; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Reading proficiency and literacy are linked with financial
stability, prospects of future employment, and give all individuals  the
ability to interact with the society around them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Those  individuals with higher levels of literacy are more
likely to involve  themselves  in  civic  engagement,  whether  that  be
through  voting  in  elections, or volunteering with local organizations
that are important to them; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year the month of March is recognized as Reading Month
in honor of the beloved children's author Dr. Suess, whose  career  made
countless contributions to the field of children's literature, which are
now enshrined in the hearts and minds of millions across the globe; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  March  2024,  as  Reading
Month  in  the  State  of  New York, and to encourage all New Yorkers to
focus on reading as an important activity in  their  lives;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
