 WORLD'S LEADING FINANCIAL CENTER, TO SUPPORT ORDERLY, COLLABORATIVE  AND
 EFFECTIVE  INTERNATIONAL SOVEREIGN DEBT RELIEF FOR COUNTRIES WITH UNSUS-
 TAINABLE LEVELS OF DEBT. DEBT  DISTRESS,  DEBT  CRISES,  AND  DISORDERLY
 DEFAULT  ARE  ASSOCIATED  WITH  UNACCEPTABLE  HUMAN  SUFFERING, ECONOMIC
 DECLINE, AND FINANCIAL MARKET AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS DISRUPTION.  MOREOVER,
 DEBT  RESTRUCTURING  IS  INEFFECTIVE  AND  DOES  NOT LEAD TO SUSTAINABLE
 OUTCOMES WHEN IT IS NOT PERCEIVED AS EQUITABLE OR LEGITIMATE  BY  STAKE-
 HOLDERS  IN BORROWING AND LENDING COUNTRIES. ADDITIONALLY, PUBLIC CREDI-
 TORS ARE UNLIKELY  TO  PARTICIPATE  IN  DEBT  RESTRUCTURING  INITIATIVES
 UNLESS  THERE IS FAIR BURDEN SHARING AMONG ALL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CREDI-
 TORS, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE LEGITIMACY  AND  EFFECTIVENESS  OF  DEBT
 RELIEF  INITIATIVES.  THEREFORE, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DECLARES THAT
 IT SHALL BE THE POLICY OF NEW YORK STATE TO SUPPORT  INTERNATIONAL  DEBT
 RELIEF  INITIATIVES  FOR  COUNTRIES TO ENSURE THAT THE COST OF SUCH DEBT
 RELIEF IS ALLOCATED IN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE MANNER, AND THAT SUCH  COSTS
 DO  NOT  FALL  DISPROPORTIONATELY  ON THE RESIDENTS AND TAXPAYERS OF NEW
 YORK STATE, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE  IS  TO
 PROVIDE EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS FOR RESTRUCTURING SOVEREIGN AND SUBNATIONAL
 DEBT SO AS TO:
  1. REDUCE THE SOCIAL COSTS OF SOVEREIGN AND SUBNATIONAL DEBT CRISES TO
 RESIDENTS OF NEW YORK STATE;
  2.  REDUCE  SYSTEMIC  RISK  TO  THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, A SYSTEM THAT IS
 CONCENTRATED IN NEW YORK STATE;
  3. REDUCE CREDITOR UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING TO THE NUMEROUS  HOLDERS  OF
 SOVEREIGN DEBT THAT ARE RESIDENTS IN NEW YORK STATE;
  4. STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF NEW YORK STATE AS A PRIMARY LOCATION FOR THE
 ISSUING AND TRADING OF SOVEREIGN DEBT;
  5.  REDUCE THE NEED FOR SOVEREIGN AND SUBNATIONAL DEBT BAILOUTS, WHICH
 CREATE MORAL HAZARD AND ARE COSTLY TO RESIDENTS OF NEW YORK STATE;
  6.  OTHERWISE  PROTECT  ECONOMIC  ACTIVITY  WITHIN  NEW  YORK  STATE'S
 BORDERS,  BY  REDUCING  THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SOVEREIGN DEBT DEFAULT WHICH
 COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT NEW YORK STATE'S ECONOMY;
  7. REDUCE, OUT OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN IMPERATIVES,
 THE SOCIAL COST OF UNRESOLVED  SOVEREIGN  DEBT  CRISES  IMPOSED  ON  THE
 PEOPLE  OF NATIONS WITH UNSUSTAINABLE DEBT, ESPECIALLY THE POOREST AMONG
 THEM, TAKING DUE ACCOUNT OF CREDITOR RIGHTS; AND
  8. ENABLE DEBTOR STATES TO CHOOSE A  DEBT  RESTRUCTURING  OPTION  THAT
 APPROPRIATELY SUITS ITS CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEEDS.
