 Introduced  by  Sen.  MAY  --  read  twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to establishing a  Finger
  Lakes commission
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The executive law is amended by adding a new  article  37-A
 to read as follows:
 
  ARTICLE 37-A
  FINGER LAKES COMMISSION
 
 SECTION 848. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
  848-A. FINGER LAKES COMMISSION ESTABLISHED.
  848-B. FINGER LAKES COMMISSION POWER AND DUTIES.
  848-C. COMPENSATION.
  848-D. REPORTS.
  848-E. COMMISSION STAFF; BENEFITS.
  §  848. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. THE LEGISLATURE
 HEREBY FINDS THAT THE FINGER LAKES REGION SPANS  FOURTEEN  COUNTIES  AND
 APPROXIMATELY  NINE  THOUSAND  SQUARE  MILES  THAT  ENCOMPASSES  TOWNS,
 VILLAGES, AND CITIES SPREAD ACROSS A  LANDSCAPE  COMPRISED  OF  NUMEROUS
 FRESHWATER  SOURCES, ONE GREAT LAKE, AND MINERAL-RICH SOIL THAT MAKES IT
 AMONG THE MOST DESIRABLE AGRICULTURAL SETTINGS  IN  THE  NORTHEAST.  THE
 CORE  OF  THE  REGION  CONSISTS  OF  THE  FINGER LAKES WATERSHED, ELEVEN
 GLACIAL FRESHWATER LAKES AND THEIR WATERSHEDS. THIS AREA INCLUDES  THREE
 OF  THE TEN LARGEST LAKES IN NEW YORK STATE. THIS WATERSHED IS IMPORTANT
 TO NEW YORK STATE AS A MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY FOR TWO MILLION RESIDENTS,
 AS WILDLIFE AND PLANT HABITAT, AS  A  RESOURCE  SUPPORTING  AGRICULTURE,
 RECREATION,  AND  TOURISM, AND OFFERS MORE TRADITIONAL LAND USES SUCH AS
 HUNTING AND FISHING. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-ONE, NEW YORK STATE WAS  THE

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets

 FIFTH-LARGEST  DAIRY PRODUCER IN THE UNITED STATES, LARGELY SUPPORTED BY
 AGRICULTURE IN THIS REGION. RICH IN AGRITOURISM, THE AREA ALSO  CONTAINS
 MORE  THAN  ONE  HUNDRED WINERIES, CONTRIBUTING TO THE INDUSTRY GROSSING
 3.76 BILLION DOLLARS IN WINE RETAIL ANNUALLY. DUE TO THE VASTNESS OF THE
 REGION,  ITS  CENTRALITY  TO  PUBLIC HEALTH, ITS ECONOMIC VALUE, AND ITS
 UNIQUE GEOLOGICAL CHARACTER, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE CREATION  OF
 A  FINGER  LAKES  COMMISSION IS ESSENTIAL IN ASSISTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
 AND ORGANIZATIONS IN PRESERVING THE RESOURCES OF THE REGION  FOR  FUTURE
 GENERATIONS.
  THE  LEGISLATURE  FINDS THAT A FINGER LAKES COMMISSION WOULD UNIFY THE
 MULTITUDINOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OF SHORELINE
 UNDER A COMMON SET OF BELIEFS AND CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THIS  REGION
 OF NEW YORK STATE. THE COMMISSION WOULD ASSIST THESE LOCAL AND MUNICIPAL
 BODIES TO DEVELOP OVERARCHING, APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS FOR
 THE  BENEFIT  OF  THE MORE THAN TWO MILLION RESIDENTS OF THE REGION. THE
 COMMISSION WOULD PROVIDE TECHNICAL  ASSISTANCE  TO  THE  REGION'S  LOCAL
 GOVERNMENTS  AND  REPORT  TO STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE REGARDING THE
 CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE FINGER LAKES  REGION.  IN  PROVIDING
 THIS  ASSISTANCE,  ITS  PURPOSE  WOULD  BE  TO ENABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS,
 PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS, AND INDIVIDUALS TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF THE FINGER
 LAKES REGION WITH A FOCUS ON CONSERVING ITS RESOURCES AND NATURAL  BEAU-
 TY,  STRENGTHENING  THE LOCAL ECONOMY, INCREASING EMPLOYMENT, PRESERVING
 CULTURAL AND SOCIAL CHARACTER, AND IMPROVING THE GENERAL  WELL-BEING  OF
 RESIDENTS  IN  THE  AREA. BY UNITING THE LEADERS AND STAKEHOLDERS OF THE
 REGION WHILE STILL MAINTAINING ITS DISTINCT VALUES AND WAY OF LIFE,  THE
 COMMISSION  WOULD  BE  MORE SUITED TO RESOLVING ISSUES PARTICULAR TO THE
 REGION AND CAPITALIZING ON ITS STRENGTHS.
  FOR MANY YEARS, THE TUG HILL COMMISSION, A SIMILAR  BODY,  HAS  SERVED
 THAT REGION'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VERY WELL. THE TUG HILL COMMISSION HAS A
 STRONG  TRACK  RECORD DEMONSTRATING ITS IMPORTANCE IN WORKING WITH TOWNS
 AND VILLAGES TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY AND  ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT
 AND  RESOURCE  PROTECTION.  THE  FINGER  LAKES COMMISSION WILL SIMILARLY
 SUPPLEMENT THE IMPORTANT WORK OF LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS  ACROSS  THE  FINGER
 LAKES, TO THE BETTERMENT OF THE WHOLE REGION.
  IT  IS  THE  PURPOSE  OF THIS ARTICLE TO PROVIDE MUNICIPAL ASSISTANCE,
 CONSERVATION, PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION BY ESTABLISHING
 THE FINGER LAKES COMMISSION, IN ORDER TO SERVE  THOSE  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT
 AND REGIONAL NEEDS, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE.
