 AN ACT to amend the executive  law,  in  relation  to  establishing  the
  empire  state  performance  commission in the executive department for
  the purpose of designing and advising the governor and the legislature
  on the implementation of  a  performance-management  and  performance-
  budgeting system
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "empire state performance commission act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent. New York's lack of a comprehensive perfor-
 mance-budgeting scheme for state-funded programs often leads  to  irreg-
 ular  appropriation  practices  and rigid across-the-board cuts, without
 regard to the  programs'  effectiveness.  A  performance-management  and
 performance-budgeting  system  that  ties program funding to the results
 the programs achieve would provide lawmakers with  more  flexibility  in
 making  budget  decisions  and  provide the public with a means by which
 they can evaluate how their tax dollars are being spent.
  The legislature recognizes that implementing and maintaining a compre-
 hensive system of performance-management and performance-budgeting is  a
 complicated  process  that will require cooperation between the legisla-
 tive and executive branches in  order  to  be  successful.  Unilaterally
 imposing  performance-management  and performance-budgeting requirements
 on executive agencies would  likely  be  unproductive  and  ineffective.
 Reforming  the  state  budget process requires careful deliberation that
 includes feedback from the various stakeholders in the process,  includ-
 ing the public.
  This legislation creates a blue ribbon commission that will be charged
 with  designing a performance-management and performance-budgeting model
 for New York to adopt. The commission is structured to elicit input from

 both houses of the legislature, the governor,  executive  agencies,  and
 the  public.  Additionally,  it  is  expected  that  the commission will
 consult  with  performance-management  and/or  performance-budgeting
 experts,  other  state  governments, and/or academic research on perfor-
 mance-management and performance-budgeting. The intent of  the  legisla-
 ture  in  creating  this  commission  is  to  have legislation ready for
 passage in 2023 that implements  a  performance-management  and  perfor-
 mance-budgeting system starting with the 2025-2026 budget.
