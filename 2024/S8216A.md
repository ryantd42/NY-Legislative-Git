 Introduced  by  Sen. JACKSON -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Civil Service and Pensions
 
 AN ACT to amend the civil service law, in relation to authorizing  those
  who  are  within  a  year  of  fulfilling the minimum age or education
  prerequisites for a competitive class civil service  position  to  sit
  for the civil service test associated with that role
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 54 of the civil service law, as amended by  chapter
 278 of the laws of 1994, is amended to read as follows:
  § 54. Age  AND  EDUCATIONAL  requirements.  1.  Notwithstanding  any
 provision of law to the contrary, except as herein provided, neither the
 state civil service department nor the state civil  service  commission,
 nor  any  municipal  civil  service  commission shall prohibit, prevent,
 disqualify, or discriminate against, any person who  is  physically  and
 mentally qualified, from participating in a civil service examination or
 from  qualifying  for  a  position  in  the classified civil service, or
 penalize any such person in a final rating by reason of his or her  age;
 and  any  such rule, requirement, resolution, regulation or penalization
 shall be void. Nothing herein  contained,  however,  shall  prevent  the
 adoption  of  reasonable  minimum  or  maximum age requirements for open
 competitive examinations for positions where it  is  determined  by  the
 department  and  approved  by  the commission that such age requirements
 would be reasonable minimum qualification for such position. Minimum age
 requirements shall in no case prohibit an applicant who is within  [six]
 TWELVE months of the minimum age requirement from taking any competitive
 examination. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the
 disqualification, on account of age, of any applicant for a position who
 has reached the mandatory retirement age applicable by law to such posi-
 tion.
  2.  MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS FOR A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION SHALL
 IN NO CASE PROHIBIT AN APPLICANT WHO IS WITHIN ONE YEAR OF OBTAINING THE
 MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS FROM TAKING ANY COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
