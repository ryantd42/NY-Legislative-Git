BY: Senator BAILEY
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  30th  Anniversary  of  the
  Notorious B.I.G.'s "Ready to Die" album
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor  and  pay
just  tribute  to  those  musical geniuses whose commitment and creative
talents contributed to the  entertainment  and  cultural  enrichment  of
their community, the State of New York, and the entire Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  30th  Anniversary  of the Notorious B.I.G.'s "Ready to
Die" album; and
 
  WHEREAS, The rise of the  Notorious  B.I.G.  brought  a  significant
shift  in  hip-hop's mid-90s landscape, setting the stage for so much of
how  the  world  would  see  the  genre  going  forward;  the  man  born
Christopher  Wallace  was  a peerless emcee, and his debut is one of the
most fully-formed in music history;  the  way  it  changed  hip-hop  has
reverberated for three decades; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Christopher Wallace grew up in poverty in the Clinton Hill
section of Brooklyn, in a single-parent household; but he was clever and
ambitious, and quickly built a name for himself, popping up on  mixtapes
with his DJ 50 Grand; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Big  Daddy Kane's DJ Mister Cee heard Biggie on a tape and
invited the burgeoning rapper to a showcase for The Source; from  there,
word  got  to  upstart  mogul-in-the-making Sean "Puffy" Combs about the
gifted lyricist from Brooklyn; during  this  time,  Biggie  earned  some
noteworthy  early  guest appearances on tracks by artists like Super Cat
and Heavy D, working closely with Combs at Uptown Records; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album,  "Ready  to  Die,"  was
released  in  September of 1994, and quickly rose to mainstream success;
Biggie's  rhymes  were  fiercely  personal,  relaying  the  fatalistic
worldview  and  "money  over  everything" ethos of Brooklyn culture; its
first single,  "Juicy,"  brought  the  East  Coast  back  to  commercial
prominence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  album's  second  single, "Big Poppa," was a smash hit
that proved Biggie was formidable as a pop star, as it  zoomed  all  the
way  to  the top 10 on Billboard's Hot 100, and pushed "Ready to Die" to
Platinum status; and
 
  WHEREAS, With his music transcending time, the Notorious B.I.G. made
an impact on the world that can still be seen today; and
 
  WHEREAS, A man  of  colossal  talent,  the  Notorious  B.I.G  was  a
brilliant  artist  and  an inspiration to millions around the world; his
message of triumph over struggle, rags to riches,  and  his  pursuit  of
truth and grace brought us all closer to our own humanity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Notorious  B.I.G.  was nothing less than a giant; his
dedication to his music leaves an indelible legacy of inspiration  which
will  long  endure  the  passage of time and will remain as a comforting
memory to his family, friends and countless fans; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the  Notorious  B.I.G.'s  "Ready  to
Die" album; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of the Notorious B.I.G.
