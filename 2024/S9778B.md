 AN  ACT  in  relation  to  authorizing  the county of Nassau assessor to
  accept an application for a real property tax exemption from  Gurdwara
  Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib, Inc.
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Gurdwara Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib, Inc. an application for exemption from
 real property taxes pursuant to section 430 of the real property tax law
 with respect to the 2022 and 2023 assessment rolls for all of  the  2023
 general taxes and all of the 2022-2023 school taxes for the parcel owned
 by such corporation located at 2000 Hillside Avenue, village of New Hyde
 Park,  town  of  Hempstead,  county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau
 county tax map district section 8 block 21114 lots 607, 608 and 609.  If
 accepted,  the  application shall be reviewed as if it had been received
 on or before the taxable status date  established  for  such  assessment
 roll.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status date, including acknowledge-
 ment of the letter from the Internal Revenue Service dated September 19,
 2022  granting  such organization exemption from federal income tax, the
 assessor, upon approval by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make
 appropriate correction to the subject roll. If such exemption is granted
 and  such  organization, therefore, shall have paid any tax with respect
 to the subject roll, the applicable governing  body  or  tax  department
 may,  in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of those taxes paid
 and cancel those taxes, fines, penalties, liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
