  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May  5-11,  2024,  as  Correctional  Officers  and
  Employees Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  operation  of  correctional  facilities  represents a
crucial component of the criminal justice system in the  United  States,
and correctional personnel play a vital role in protecting the rights of
the public to be safeguarded from criminal activity; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are over 16,178 corrections officers and employees in
the  State  of  New York who oversee the State's correctional facilities
and are responsible for the care, custody, and maintenance of more  than
31,329 inmates charged to their care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  carry out their responsibilities, corrections officers
work under demanding circumstances and face danger in their  daily  work
lives, which sometimes results in the loss of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1984, former President Ronald Reagan signed Proclamation
5187,  which  designated  the  first  full  week  in  May  as  "National
Correctional Officers Week" in honor of  corrections  officers  who  put
their  lives  on the line every day to protect the public from dangerous
criminals and to help prisoners work toward becoming productive  members
of society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1996,  Congress expanded and renamed this special week
"National Correctional Officers and Employees Week"  in  recognition  of
all  those  employed  with  city,  state  and  federal  correctional
departments; and
 
  WHEREAS, In accordance with the federal government's recognition  of
the indispensable contributions that corrections officers make every day
to  protect  our  citizens from harm, it is proper and befitting for the
State of New York to honor all corrections officers and employees;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  5-11,  2024,  as
Correctional  Officers  and Employees Week in the State of New York; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
