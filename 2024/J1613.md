  RECOGNIZING  September  17-23,  2023, as Emergency
  Management  Professionals  and  Community  Emergency
  Response Team Appreciation Week
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
official weeks which celebrate the vital work  and  knowledge  Emergency
Management  Professionals  and  Community Emergency Response Teams bring
during disaster situations and which greatly affect  the  lives  of  the
citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  recognize
September  17-23,  2023,  as  Emergency  Management  Professionals  and
Community Emergency Response Team Appreciation Week, in conjunction with
the observance of National Preparedness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Emergencies and disasters can strike anywhere, at any time;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital  week  recognizes the steadfast and unwavering
dedication of emergency management professionals and Community Emergency
Response Team (CERT) members who work  tirelessly  to  manage  incidents
impacting  our  communities, counties, states and nation such as natural
and human caused disasters, technological hazards and pandemics; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, when  these  professionals  are  not  managing
incidents,  they  are  supporting  community  awareness and preparedness
efforts, as well as continuously planning for various types of incidents
and emergencies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Emergency management coordinators and their staff  dedicate
countless  hours  to  developing  preparedness  and response programs to
protect the lives and property of residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, Emergency management personnel across the state are charged
with establishing and maintaining the capability to effectively  direct,
control,  and  coordinate  emergency  and disaster response and recovery
efforts that impact New York State residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, and  Recovery  are  the
four  main  phases  of  activities  that emergency managers implement to
create a successful emergency management program; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first CERT team was created in 1986 with  the  goal  of
creating  citizen  volunteers  equipped  to  provide  assistance  during
disaster response; CERT  graduates  go  through  a  nationally  approved
training  program  to  learn about fire safety, light search and rescue,
first aid and CPR, traffic management, team organization,  and  disaster
medical operations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  there are more than 2,800 CERT programs across the
country;  the  assistance  provided  by  these  volunteers  frees  up
professional  emergency  responders  to  focus on more specialized tasks
during a crisis; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Sufficient  gratitude  cannot  be  expressed  to all those
individuals who generously give of their time and  talents,  working  to
keep their communities safe; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Special  recognition  should be given to those who work so
assiduously for the betterment of their communities, and they should  be
acknowledged  publicly  for  the  good works they do for the citizens of
this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
recognize  September  17-23, 2023, as Emergency Management Professionals
and Community Emergency Response  Team  Appreciation  Week;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted  to  Emergency  Management  Professionals  and  Community
Emergency  Response  Team  members and organizations across the State of
New York.
