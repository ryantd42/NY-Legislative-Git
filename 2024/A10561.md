 ity or family leave caused by the same or related injury or sickness  OR

 The superintendent of financial services shall have discretion to  delay
 the  increases  in  the  family leave benefit level provided in subpara-
 graphs (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this paragraph by one or  more  calendar
 years.  In determining whether to delay the increase in the family leave
 benefit for any year, the superintendent  of  financial  services  shall
 consider:  (1) the current cost to employees of the family leave benefit
 and any expected change in the cost after the benefit increase; (2)  the
 current  number  of  insurers  issuing  insurance policies with a family
 leave benefit and any expected change in the number of insurers  issuing
 such  policies after the benefit increase; (3) the impact of the benefit
 increase on employers' business and the overall stability of the program
 to the extent that information is readily available; (4) the  impact  of
 the  benefit  increase  on the financial stability of the disability and
 family leave insurance market  and  carriers;  and  (5)  any  additional
 factors that the superintendent of financial services deems relevant. If

 family leave benefit level for one or more calendar  years,  the  family
 leave  benefit  level  that  shall take effect immediately following the
 delay shall be the same benefit level that would have taken  effect  but
 for  the  delay.  The weekly benefits for family leave that occurs on or
 after January first, two thousand eighteen shall not be  less  than  one

 shall  receive [his or her] THEIR full wages. Benefits may be payable to
 employees for paid family leave taken intermittently or for less than  a
 full  work week in increments of one full day or one fifth of the weekly
 benefit.
  (b) THE WEEKLY BENEFIT WHICH THE  DISABLED  EMPLOYEE  IS  ENTITLED  TO

 AFTER JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX SHALL BE FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT
 OF THE EMPLOYEE'S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE BUT SHALL NOT EXCEED FIFTY PERCENT

 TWENTY-SIX  AND  EACH  SUCCEEDING  YEAR  SHALL  BE THIRTY PERCENT OF THE
 EMPLOYEE'S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE BUT SHALL NOT EXCEED  THIRTY  PERCENT  OF

 DISABILITY AFTER THE TWELFTH WEEK OF DISABILITY THROUGH THE TWENTY-SIXTH
 WEEK OF DISABILITY, PROVIDED THAT SUCH BENEFIT SHALL NOT  EXCEED  SIXTY-
 SEVEN  PERCENT  OF THE STATE AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE. IN DETERMINING WHETHER
 TO INCREASE THE DISABILITY BENEFIT FOR ANY YEAR, THE CHAIR OF THE  WORK-
 ERS'  COMPENSATION  BOARD  IN  CONSULTATION  WITH  THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
 FINANCIAL SERVICES SHALL CONSIDER FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT  LIMITED  TO
 UTILIZATION  OF  THE  CURRENT  BENEFIT,  THE EXPECTED UTILIZATION OF ANY
 INCREASE, THE NEED FOR A BENEFIT INCREASE, THE CURRENT CONTRIBUTION COST
 TO EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS AND THE EXPECTED COST AFTER ANY SUCH  BENEFIT
 INCREASE;  THE  CURRENT  NUMBER OF INSURERS  ISSUING INSURANCE  POLICIES
 WITH  A  DISABILITY  BENEFIT  AND ANY EXPECTED CHANGE IN THE  NUMBER  OF
 INSURERS  ISSUING  SUCH  POLICIES  AFTER THE BENEFIT INCREASE; AND ANY

 THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES DEEMS  RELEVANT.  THE  WEEKLY
 BENEFIT WHICH THE DISABLED EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FOR DISABILI-
 TY  LEAVE THAT OCCURS ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-SIX
 SHALL NOT BE LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK EXCEPT THAT  IF  THE
 EMPLOYEE'S  WAGES  AT  THE  TIME  OF  DISABILITY LEAVE ARE LESS THAN ONE
 HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK, THE EMPLOYEE SHALL RECEIVE THEIR  FULL  WAGES.
 The  weekly  benefit  which the disabled employee is entitled to receive
 for disability commencing on or after May first, nineteen hundred eight-
 y-nine AND PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-SIX  shall  be
 one-half  of the employee's weekly wage, but in no case shall such bene-
 fit exceed one hundred seventy dollars; except that  if  the  employee's

 ly  benefit which the disabled employee is entitled to receive for disa-
 bility commencing on or after July first, nineteen hundred  eighty-three
 and  prior to July first, nineteen hundred eighty-four shall be one-half

 exceed one hundred thirty-five dollars nor be less than twenty  dollars;
 except  that  if  the employee's average weekly wage is less than twenty
 dollars the benefit shall be such average weekly wage. The weekly  bene-
 fit  which  the  disabled employee is entitled to receive for disability

 the  employee's  average  weekly wage, but in no case shall such benefit
 exceed ninety-five dollars nor be less than twenty dollars; except  that
 if  the  employee's average weekly wage is less than twenty dollars, the

 age  weekly  wage, but in no case shall such benefit exceed seventy-five
 dollars nor be less than twenty dollars; except that if  the  employee's
 average  weekly  wage  is  less than twenty dollars the benefit shall be

 full  week,  the  benefits  payable  shall be calculated by dividing the
 weekly benefit by the number of the employee's normal work days per week
 and multiplying the quotient by the number of normal work days  in  such
 period of disability.] BENEFITS MAY BE PAYABLE TO EMPLOYEES FOR DISABIL-
 ITY  LEAVE  TAKEN  INTERMITTENTLY  OR  FOR LESS THAN A FULL WORK WEEK IN
 INCREMENTS OF ONE FULL DAY OR ONE-FIFTH OF THE WEEKLY BENEFIT. The week-
 ly benefit for a disabled employee  who  is  concurrently  eligible  for

 within the maximum and minimum herein provided, be one-half of the total
 of the employee's average weekly wages received from  all  such  covered
 employers,  and shall be allocated in the proportion of their respective
 average weekly wage payments.

 BILITY BENEFITS GREATER THAN THE BENEFITS REQUIRED HEREIN.
