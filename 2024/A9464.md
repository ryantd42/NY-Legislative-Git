  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  2 of section 4371 of the
 public health law, as amended by chapter 66 of  the  laws  of  2023,  is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a)  Subject  to  appropriations  therefor,  the program shall pay the
 living donor expenses for living donors: (I) who are  residents  of  the
 state  [and  make];  OR  (II)  ARE MAKING a living donation in which the
 ultimate recipient, either directly or  through  paired  donation  is  a
 resident of the state. The commissioner through regulations shall estab-
 lish  eligible living donor expenses that are eligible for reimbursement
 under the program which shall include at a minimum: lost wages  (includ-
 ing  demonstrated  lost  non-employment income) or the economic value of
 sick or vacation days expended; travel and lodging, child care and elder
 care expenses; and costs of medications and  care  associated  with  the
 living  donation  surgery  that are not covered by health insurance. The
 total period of time related to lost wages or expended sick or  vacation
 days shall not exceed four weeks unless special circumstances are demon-
 strated,  such  as  the nature of physical labor required for the living
 donor's employment; provided that the total period  shall  in  no  event
 exceed  eight weeks. The commissioner may, by regulation, impose reason-
 able limitations on: (i) the amount of lost wages  for  a  living  donor
 making  an income in excess of an annual rate of one hundred twenty-five
 thousand dollars; or (ii) the amount  of  living  donor  expenses  above
 fourteen  thousand  dollars for any single living donor; and may include
 additional living donor expenses including reimbursement  for  costs  of
 care performed by relatives or family members of the living donor.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
