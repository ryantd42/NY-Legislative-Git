 TARY SEWER SYSTEM.  EXISTING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES ALL THE  MAN-
 MADE AND NATURAL FEATURES THAT MOVE AND TREAT WATER IN TERMS OF DRINKING

 FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS OF EXISTING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL  AS
 NEW  WATER  INFRASTRUCTURE  EXPANSION,  BUT  ONLY INTO ALREADY DEVELOPED
 AREAS SO AS NOT TO SUPPORT SPRAWL  AND  DEVELOPMENT  OF  NATURAL  AREAS.

 OF  THIS  SECTION  DIVIDED  BY THE NUMBER OF PAYMENT DATES IN THAT STATE
 FISCAL YEAR. SUCH AMOUNTS SHALL BE  DISTRIBUTED  AND  PAID  PURSUANT  TO
 SUBDIVISION THREE OF THIS SECTION.
  3.  AMOUNTS SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED FOR LOCAL DRINKING WATER, STORM WATER
 AND SANITARY SEWER SYSTEMS BASED UPON A FUNDING FORMULA THAT THE DEPART-
 MENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SHALL CREATE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION
 FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  THE SYSTEM'S LENGTH AND WIDTH  OF
 PIPES;  OTHER PHYSICAL ASSETS MAINTAINED BY THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING TREAT-
 MENT FACILITIES AND PUMPING STATIONS; THE AGE OF  THE  SYSTEM'S  INFRAS-
 TRUCTURE;  AND RELEVANT SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF
 DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITHIN A SYSTEM'S SERVICE AREA, TO ACHIEVE  AN
 EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF AID.

 SYSTEM PURCHASES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ACQUISITION OF MATE-
 RIALS FOR THE REPLACEMENT OR REHABILITATION.
  5.  FOR  ANY  CITY,  TOWN,  VILLAGE OR PUBLIC AUTHORITY WHICH PROPOSES
 INFRASTRUCTURE CONSOLIDATION UNDER THIS SECTION OR MERGES  WITH  ANOTHER
 MUNICIPALITY,  THE  FUNDS APPROPRIATED UNDER THIS SECTION MAY FUND COSTS
 ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH CONSOLIDATION.
  6. FOR EACH FISCAL YEAR, STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND  TWENTY-FIVE,  FUNDS
 ARE  TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE ACCOUNT
 OF THE GENERAL FUND, AND DISTRIBUTED FROM THAT ACCOUNT.
  7. AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, EACH COUNTY,  CITY,  TOWN,  VILLAGE
 AND  PUBLIC  AUTHORITY  THAT  RECEIVES  FUNDING PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
 SHALL SUBMIT AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT DETAILING HOW SUCH MONEY
 WAS USED. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL COMPILE ALL REPORTS AND  SUBMIT  THEM  TO
 THE  COMPTROLLER  FOR THEIR REVIEW. ONCE A REPORT IS FINALIZED, IT SHALL
 BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE.  THE  DEPARTMENT
 AND  THE  COMPTROLLER SHALL RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT SIGHT VISITS TO
 ENSURE THE MONEY IS BEING USED ACCURATELY.

 have become a law.
