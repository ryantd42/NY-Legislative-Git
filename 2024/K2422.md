  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that

projects to preserve the water quality of the  bay,  including:  wetland

with  New  York State Federation of Lake Associations and the Department
of Environmental Conservation to  routinely  test  the  quality  of  the
water; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Whether  it  be a letter-writing campaign to their federal
representatives to  help  repair  a  break  wall  or  opening  lines  of

and  its  neighbors  will not be subject to flooding, Save Our Sodus has
been instrumental in advocating  for  projects  that  will  protect  and
enhance shoreline resiliency; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recognizing  the  pivotal connection between environmental
health, and environmental vitality and community participation, Save Our
