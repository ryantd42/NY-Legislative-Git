  § 3. At the time of submitting  the  budget  to  the  legislature  the

  (A)  a  bill  or  bills containing all the proposed appropriations and
 reappropriations included in the budget [and], PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT
 SUCH  APPROPRIATIONS  AND  REAPPROPRIATIONS SHALL BE CONSISTENT WITH AND
 CONSTRAINED BY THE PROVISIONS OF EXISTING STATE LAW  AND  SHALL  NEITHER
 AMEND NOR WITHSTAND SUCH EXISTING STATE LAW, EXCEPT FOR MONETARY AMOUNTS
 WHERE APPROPRIATE; AND
  (B) the proposed legislation, if any, recommended therein, WHICH SHALL
 BE  IN  A  NONAPPROPRIATION BILL OR BILLS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE
 APPROPRIATION BILL OR BILLS.
  The governor may at any time within thirty days thereafter  and,  with
 the consent of the legislature, at any time before the adjournment ther-
 eof,  amend  or supplement the budget and submit amendments to any bills
 submitted by him or her or submit supplemental bills.
  The governor and the heads of departments shall have the right, and it
 shall be the duty of the heads of departments when requested  by  either

 ances and inquiries shall be provided by law.

 government,  no  appropriations  shall  be made except by separate bills
 each for a single object or purpose. All such  bills  and  such  supple-
 mental appropriation bill shall be subject to the governor's approval as
 provided in section 7 of article IV.
  [No provision shall be embraced in any] ANY appropriation bill submit-
 ted by the governor or [in] such supplemental appropriation bill [unless

 THEREOF. SUCH ITEM OF APPROPRIATION SHALL  NOT  CONTAIN  MULTIPLE  ITEMS
 UNLESS  SEPARATELY SCHEDULED AND SHALL, WHERE PRACTICABLE, INCLUDE IDEN-
 TIFICATION  OF  THE  STATUTORY  BASIS  FOR  SUCH  EXPENDITURE.  SUCH
 DESCRIPTION:
  (A)  SHALL RELATE specifically to some particular appropriation in the
 bill[, and any such provision shall be limited in its operation to  such
 appropriation];
  (B)  SHALL  IDENTIFY THE OBJECT OR PURPOSE OF THE APPROPRIATION TO THE
 EXTENT NECESSARY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND PUBLIC  TO  EFFECTIVELY  REVIEW
 THE PROPOSED APPROPRIATION;
  (C)  SHALL  NOT  INCLUDE  THE  CONDITIONS,  RULES OR REQUIREMENTS OF A
 PROGRAM TO BE FUNDED THEREBY; PROVIDED ANY  SUCH  CONDITIONS,  RULES  OR
 REQUIREMENTS  SHALL  BE  SEPARATELY  SET FORTH BY THE GOVERNOR IN EITHER
 NONAPPROPRIATION BILLS CONTAINING PROPOSED LEGISLATION OR THE ADDITIONAL
 BUDGETARY INFORMATION SUBMITTED  BY  THE  GOVERNOR  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH
 SECTION TWO OF THIS ARTICLE; AND
  (D)  SHALL  NOT  ABROGATE  OR  MODIFY  AN  EXISTING  PROVISION OF LAW,
 PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNOR MAY PROPOSE  SUCH  MODIFICATIONS  TO  AN
 EXISTING  PROVISION  OF  LAW  IN  NONAPPROPRIATION  BILLS IN ACCORD WITH
 SUBDIVISION (B) OF SECTION THREE OF THIS ARTICLE.
  § 3. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendment  be
 referred  to  the  first regular legislative session convening after the
 next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly,  and,  in
 conformity  with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution, be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
