  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 24, 2024, as Schizophrenia Awareness Day in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to help increase
awareness of serious health conditions that affect the lives of citizens
of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  24,  2024,  as
Schizophrenia  Awareness  Day  in  the State of New York, in conjunction
with World Schizophrenia Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  imperative  to  raise  awareness  of  mental  health
conditions  that,  absent  early  and  effective intervention, are often
severely debilitating, impacting the  individual,  their  families,  and
loved ones; and
 
  WHEREAS, Schizophrenia is a serious mental health condition and also
one of the top 15 leading causes of disability worldwide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Schizophrenia  is  characterized  by  persistent psychotic
symptoms such  as  auditory  and/or  visual  hallucinations,  delusional
thinking,  dissociation  from  reality,  and  disorganized  thoughts and
behavior; these  symptoms  typically  emerge  in  adolescence  or  early
adulthood  and  can  be  persistent  and  disabling when left untreated,
interfering with a person's ability to engage in typical  school,  work,
and social activities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Schizophrenia affects about 24 million people in the world
and over 217,000 people in the State of New York; the life expectancy of
those living with schizophrenia is reduced by 10-20  years  compared  to
the general population, often due to multiple chronic health conditions,
and approximately 5% of people living with schizophrenia die by suicide,
a rate that is far greater than the general population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Schizophrenia  is  one  of  the  most  misunderstood  and
stigmatized disorders, therefore, it is vital that New York continues to
be a leader in providing education and awareness,  reducing  the  stigma
surrounding schizophrenia to create easier access to treatment for those
who need it; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The standard of care for mental health condition treatment
has been largely unchanged  for  over  60  years  and  many  individuals
continue to suffer with unmet needs as a result; this is largely because
there has been a significant lack of treatment innovation for severe and
disabling mental health conditions; and
 
  WHEREAS, One promising exception is the development of First Episode
Psychosis  treatment  protocols;  however,  the  limited advancements in
serious mental  health  condition  treatments  hinder  individuals  from
 
accessing  the  care,  medications,  therapeutic treatment, and recovery
support services to be able to live a full and happy life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  objective  of Schizophrenia Awareness Day is to raise
awareness of serious mental  health  issues  around  the  world  and  to
mobilize  efforts  in  support  of  mental  health;  the day provides an
opportunity for all stakeholders working on mental health issues to talk
about their work and what needs to be done to make mental  healthcare  a
reality for people worldwide; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  24,  2024,  as
Schizophrenia Awareness Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
