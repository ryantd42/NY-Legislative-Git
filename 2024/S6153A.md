 S. 6153--A  6
 
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of approximately  $1.1  million  in
 the  annual  contributions  of  Nassau County for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary but is  expected  to
 average 4.8% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $4.77 million which will
 be  borne  by Nassau County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes
 that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
  These estimated costs are based on 233 affected  members  employed  by
 Nassau  County,  with annual salary of approximately $20.3 million as of
 March 31, 2023. The affected members were identified  using  information
 provided by the Office of Senator Robert Jackson.
