blindly, to ensure fairness, and the top eight scoring students  compose
the team and team support; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  SUNY  Delhi Culinary Hot Food Team made a four-course
meal with six portions and served it to the judges; they had 90  minutes

inspiration  from  the  region;  the entree was a modern version of Chef
Auguste Escoffier's Poulet Saute a la Catalane; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the able  leadership  of  culinary  instructors  Chef
Victor  Sommo  and  Chef Sean Pehrsson, the SUNY Delhi Culinary Hot Food
Team faced a team from Monroe College in New  Rochelle,  New  York;  the
hundreds of hours of practice paid off, and these talented students were
able to earn a gold medal; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  students  on  the  team,  including  Brennan  Spencer
(captain) of Painted Post, New York; McKena Giles of Castle  Creek,  New
York;  and  Moses  Rojas  of Bronx, New York, all sophomores, as well as

American Culinary Federation (ACF) state, regional, and national titles;
and
