 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the assessor of the town of Brookhaven
  to accept an application for exemption from real property  taxes  from
  Al-Muneer Foundation, Inc.

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the town of Brookhaven, county  of  Suffolk,  is  hereby
 authorized  to  accept  from Al-Muneer Foundation, Inc. a not-for-profit
 corporation, an application  for  exemption  from  real  property  taxes
 pursuant  to  section 420-a of the real property tax law with respect to
 the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 assessment rolls for  the  parcel  owned  by
 such  organization  located  in  the  town  of Brookhaven, located at 72
 Neighborhood Road in Mastic Beach, also known as district 0200,  section
 979.10,  block 09.00, lot 017.000. If accepted, the application shall be
 reviewed as if it had been received on or before the taxable status date
 established for such assessment rolls.
  If satisfied that such corporation would otherwise be entitled to such
 exemption if such corporation had filed an application for exemption  by
 the  appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon approval of the
 town of Brookhaven town board, may grant exemption from taxation on such
 assessment rolls and make the appropriate  corrections  of  the  subject
 rolls.  If exemptions are granted and such corporation, therefore, shall
 have paid any tax with respect to  the  subject  rolls,  the  applicable
 governing  body  or  tax  departments,  in  their sole discretion, shall
 provide for the refund of the taxes paid, along with any fines or penal-
 ties paid, and cancel taxes remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
