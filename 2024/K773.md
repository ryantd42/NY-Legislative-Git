  COMMEMORATING the 150th Anniversary of the Village
  of Sleepy Hollow, New York, on January 2, 2024
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  150th Anniversary of the Village of Sleepy Hollow, New
York, on Tuesday, January 2, 2024; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Village of Sleepy Hollow's name  is  Dutch  in  origin,
believed  to  denote a description of a cove; the bordering Hudson River
contributed to the flourishing of the Village; and
 
  WHEREAS, On May 20, 1874, the local government was established by  a
group  of  concerned  citizens, and their commitment is still sustained,
meeting the needs of the residents of the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Frederick Philipse settled in America around 1650; he was a
Master Carpenter by trade, acting as an architect,  a  builder,  a  real
estate  developer,  and  an  entrepreneur;  he  met and married Margaret
Hardenbroeck, the widow of wealthy merchant Pieter DeVries;  the  couple
were  the  most  affluent  in the colony, and over the next two decades,
they  amassed  a  vast  estate  along  the  Hudson  River,  eventually
encompassing  more  than  52,000 acres of land, including the Village of
Sleepy Hollow; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Old Dutch Church, built by Frederick Philipse in  1685,
has  been  recognized  as  one of the oldest churches in New York State,
still holding worship services; this national landmark  is  the  setting
for  Washington  Irving's  short  story,  "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow";
General George Washington and his Continental Army rested at the  church
on  July  2,  1781, on their way to meet the French Army in Dobbs Ferry;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Of historic origin, and remaining fruitful over the ebb and
flow of decades of growth and  change,  the  Village  of  Sleepy  Hollow
continues  to  provide  the  quintessential  quality  of  life  for  its
residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, The residents of the Village of Sleepy Hollow have a bright
outlook for the future of their  community  which  remains  a  beautiful
place  in which to live, raise a family, conduct business, and enjoy the
natural beauty and historical sites that make this sector  of  New  York
State a charming and welcoming community, its population growing to more
than 12,000 residents who are grateful to call it home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition  of  the  Village  of Sleepy Hollow's rich
history and enduring  contribution  to  the  State  of  New  York,  this
Legislative  Body  is proud to pay tribute to this spirited village upon
the occasion of its 150th Anniversary; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Village of Sleepy  Hollow,  New
York,  on  January  2, 2024, recognizing the significance of the role it
continues to play in the life of the communities of  the  State  of  New
York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Village of Sleepy Hollow.
