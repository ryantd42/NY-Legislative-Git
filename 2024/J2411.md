  COMMEMORATING  the  15th  Anniversary  of Feed Our
  Vets of Utica, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
Veterans of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 15th Anniversary Feed Our Vets of Utica, New York, to be
celebrated with an Open House and Barbecue on Wednesday, May  22,  2024;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception  in February 2009, Feed Our Vets has
provided free food assistance to more than  52,000  Veterans  and  their
family members, distributing 3,850,000 pounds of food; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Feed Our Vets is a nonprofit organization whose mission is
to help Veterans in the United States, as well  as  their  spouses,  and
children,  whose  circumstances  have  left  them  on the battlefield of
hunger, and to involve the public in fighting Veteran hunger; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  vital  organization  achieves  its  mission  through:
community  food  pantries which provide regular, free food distributions
to Veterans and their families;  Walmart  gift  card  program  for  food
purchase;  distribution  of  related  goods  and  services;  and  public
education and outreach; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 130,000 Veterans are homeless and hungry  on  any
given  night  in  America;  one in three homeless people in America is a
U.S.  Military Veteran, and nearly  four  million  Veterans  and  their
families  don't  have  enough  to  eat  during  the  year; Feed Our Vets
provides food for Veterans and active-duty members in 39 states; and
 
  WHEREAS, Feed Our  Vets  solution  is  to  help  feed  Veterans  and
Military  members  in cities and towns across the United States; while a
brick-mortar pantry in every state is impossible because of  significant
operating  costs,  its  Walmart  gift  card  program  covers  states and
communities who can't support a pantry; and
 
  WHEREAS, With low overhead, Feed Our Vets is  able  to  assist  more
hungry  families  and put more food on their tables; in 2022, 94% of its
expenditures went right back to  Veterans  and  active-duty  members  in
need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  dedication  and  sacrifices of our military personnel
ensure our continued role as a  Nation  which  embodies  the  ideals  of
democracy,  and  is  a  defender  of  liberty for peoples throughout the
world; it our duty to give back to these men and women who have given so
much for our country; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 15th Anniversary of Feed Our Vets of  Utica,  New  York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Feed Our Vets of Utica, New York.
