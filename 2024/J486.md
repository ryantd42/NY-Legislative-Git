Education Law; and
 
  WHEREAS, Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES)  are  an

and inclusion,  supporting  professional  learning  for  educators,  and
developing  new  programs and services to meet the changing needs of the

development  to countless educators each year, serving as a link between
local schools and the State Education Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, A partner to both industry and higher education,  New  York
BOCES  chapters  collaborate  with  more  than  2,000  colleges  and
universities, giving students the opportunity to further their education

  WHEREAS, In addition, each year, over 20,000 New Yorkers earn  their
high  school  equivalency  and  study  English as a second language with
BOCES services and programs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Steeped in a proud and distinguished history, OHM BOCES may
look back with pride upon its humble beginnings, find just  satisfaction
in  its purposeful growth, and hold true of purpose in its commitment to
serving the educational needs of the citizens of the State of New  York;
