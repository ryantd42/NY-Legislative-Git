 AN ACT to amend the local finance law, in relation to providing a period
  of probable usefulness for lead service line replacement programs as a
  capital asset

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph  a of section 11.00 of the local finance law is
 amended by adding a new subdivision 109 to read as follows:
  109. LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED BY  A  MUNICI-
 PALITY,  SCHOOL  DISTRICT  OR  DISTRICT  CORPORATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO PROGRAMS THAT INVENTORY, DESIGN AND  REPLACE  PUBLICLY  OWNED
 AND  PRIVATELY  OWNED  LEAD  SERVICE  LINES  WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED WATER
 SYSTEM, THIRTY YEARS.  AS USED IN THIS SUBDIVISION, "LEAD SERVICE  LINE"
 MEANS  A SERVICE LINE MADE IN WHOLE OR IN PART OF LEAD, WHICH CONNECTS A
 WATER MAIN TO A BUILDING INLET. A LEAD SERVICE LINE MAY BE OWNED BY  THE
 WATER  SYSTEM,  A PROPERTY OWNER, OR BOTH. A LEAD GOOSENECK, PIGTAIL, OR
 CONNECTOR IS CONSIDERED A LEAD SERVICE LINE, REGARDLESS OF  THE  SERVICE
 LINE  MATERIAL  TO  WHICH  A  LEAD  GOOSENECK,  PIGTAIL, OR CONNECTOR IS
 ATTACHED. GOOSENECK, PIGTAIL, OR CONNECTOR  MEANS  A  SHORT  SECTION  OF
 PIPING, TYPICALLY NOT EXCEEDING TWO FEET, WHICH CAN BE BENT AND USED FOR
 CONNECTIONS  BETWEEN  RIGID  SERVICE  PIPING. A GALVANIZED IRON OR STEEL
 SERVICE LINE IS CONSIDERED A LEAD SERVICE LINE IF  IT  EVER  WAS  OR  IS
 CURRENTLY DOWNSTREAM OF ANY LEAD SERVICE LINE OR SERVICE LINE OF UNKNOWN
 MATERIAL.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
