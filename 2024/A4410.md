 quality  of  or  enrollees'  appropriate  access  to medically necessary

 practices for network adequacy for behavioral health, the superintendent
 of financial services shall update any regulations or guidance regarding

 services.  Such  updated  regulations  or  guidance  shall  be  based on
 national best practices and  shall  include  quantitative  measures  for
 geographic  distance  and/or  travel  time,  appointment  wait  time and
 provider/enrollee ratios and any other appropriate metric determined  by
 the  superintendent  to  be  necessary to ensure access to needed mental
 health and substance  use  disorder  services.  Such  regulations  shall
 include  a  review  of  the appropriate use of telephonic and telehealth
 services to supplement in-person services, as well as  the  adequacy  of
