 Introduced  by M. of A. BRONSON -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Labor
 
 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to dependent workers
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "dependent worker act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. 1. It is hereby declared  to  be
 the public policy of the state to ensure that laborers and other workers
 who  depend  for  their livelihood on working for others, offering their
 time, labor and personal services in exchange for hourly wages or  other
 compensation,  are  timely  and  fully paid and informed regarding their
 earnings, without the uncertainty, delay and denial that may result when
 their employment status is disputed by claims that they are  independent
 contractors rather than employees.
  2.  It  is  further  declared  to be the public policy of the state to
 ensure that such dependent workers shall have the right to organize  and
 bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing based
 on the state's constitutional recognition that the labor of human beings
 is  not  a  commodity  or  an  article of commerce and shall never be so
 considered or construed.
  3. The legislature finds that the ability of such dependent workers to
 find opportunities for work has been transformed by technology to expand
 day work to digital work, allowing workers to establish their availabil-
 ity by the minute and hour, rather than simply by the day. In  light  of
 this  shift, the legislature finds that further examination is warranted
 to determine  the  extent  to  which  various  employment  benefits  and
 substantive  protections  that  were historic bargains struck with input
 from labor and management, through bargaining, legislation, and adminis-
 trative rate setting and rulemaking, should be extended to such  digital
 work,  regardless of employment status. The collective bargaining oppor-
 tunities and public  meetings  provided  through  this  legislation  can
 provide  experience  and  input  that  is not currently available to the

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 legislature  to  inform  determinations  regarding  such  benefits  and
 substantive protections.
  4. This chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the
 state  for the protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health, and
 peace of the people of the state.
  5. Nothing herein shall diminish the rights of any  worker,  including
 those  already  or prospectively determined by a court or administrative
 agency to be an employee.
  § 3. Section 2 of the labor law, is amended by adding a  new  subdivi-
 sion 19 to read as follows:
  19.  "DEPENDENT  WORKER"  MEANS  AN  INDIVIDUAL  WHO PROVIDES PERSONAL
 SERVICES TO A CONSUMER OF  SUCH  PERSONAL  SERVICES  THROUGH  A  PRIVATE
 SECTOR  THIRD-PARTY  THAT:  ESTABLISHES  THE GROSS AMOUNTS EARNED BY THE
 INDIVIDUAL; ESTABLISHES THE AMOUNTS CHARGED TO  THE  CONSUMER;  COLLECTS
 PAYMENT  FROM  THE  CONSUMER; PAYS THE INDIVIDUAL; OR ANY COMBINATION OF
 THE PRECEDING. THE TERM "DEPENDENT WORKER"  APPLIES  WITHOUT  REGARD  TO
 WHETHER  THE  INDIVIDUAL PROVIDES SUCH SERVICES IN THE NAME OF THE INDI-
 VIDUAL OR IN THE NAME OF A BUSINESS OR AS A  SEPARATE  BUSINESS  ENTITY,
 AND  WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE CONSUMER OF SUCH PERSONAL SERVICES IS
 AN INDIVIDUAL, BUSINESS, OTHER ENTITY, OR ANY  COMBINATION  THEREOF.  NO
 GOVERNMENTAL  ENTITY  SHALL  BE CONSIDERED A THIRD-PARTY FOR PURPOSES OF
 THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM "DEPENDENT WORKER". WHENEVER THE TERM EMPLOY-
 EE IS DEFINED BY LAW TO INCLUDE A DEPENDENT WORKER FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES,
 THEN FOR SUCH STATUTE AND PURPOSES A DEPENDENT WORKER SHALL BE DEEMED TO
 BE EMPLOYED BY THE THIRD-PARTY REFERENCED ABOVE, WHO SHALL BE DEEMED  TO
 BE  AN  EMPLOYER  ENGAGED IN AN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH A DEPENDENT
 WORKER, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXCLUDED FROM SUCH STATUTE OR PURPOSES.  WORK-
 ERS  CLASSIFIED  AS  EMPLOYEES  BY  OTHER MEANS OR WHO SATISFY ANY OTHER
 LEGAL TEST FOR EMPLOYMENT,  INCLUDING  THOSE  ALREADY  OR  PROSPECTIVELY
 DETERMINED  BY  A  COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY TO BE EMPLOYEES, SHALL
 NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS OR PROTECTIONS DIMINISHED  BY  APPLICATION  OF  THIS
 SUBDIVISION.
  §  4. Subdivision 2 of section 190 of the labor law, as added by chap-
 ter 548 of the laws of 1966, is amended to read as follows:

 benefits to identify which  provisions  could  be  extended  to  provide
