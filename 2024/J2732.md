BY: Senator SCARCELLA-SPANTON
 
  COMMENDING Jose Cristales upon the occasion of his
  designation  as  recipient  of  a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
commend  the  caring  concern  and  heroic  acts of individuals who take
prompt and appropriate action in emergency situations  to  preserve  the
life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend Jose Cristales upon the occasion of his designation as recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the morning of Thursday, September  12,  2024,  off-duty
firefighter,  Jose  Cristales, was asleep at his home in Brighton Beach,
Brooklyn, New York, when he was awakened by the sound of screams; and
 
  WHEREAS, Acting immediately, Jose Cristales descended the stairs  of
his home and ran outside where he observed a woman who was trapped under
a wheel of the vehicle that struck her; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Instantly,  the  life-saving  training  Jose Cristales had
mastered came to his mind, and he was readily available  to  assist  the
suffering victim; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jose  Cristales assessed the situation and ascertained the
need for bystanders to help him lift the vehicle so the woman  could  be
freed; however, fortunately, a bulldozer was nearby; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Alerting  the construction crew members who were using the
powerful land-moving equipment, Jose Cristales orchestrated  a  plan  to
hoist the vehicle; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  the woman no longer trapped, Jose Cristales was able
to move her to safety and perform CPR during which  time  the  emergency
crews  arrived; the victim, who had sustained life-threatening injuries,
was rushed to a hospital; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Friday, September  13,  2024,  Jose  Cristales  and  his
fellow first responders were commended by the FDNY Commissioner; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Due to the noble and courageous actions of Jose Cristales,
a precious life was saved, and a seemingly dire situation  had  positive
results;  he  had  exemplified  FDNY's  values--training,  teamwork, and
heroism; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Jose  Cristales, in his spontaneous and heroic act, has so
aptly demonstrated his character  and  compassion  for  the  welfare  of
others, personifying, by virtue of his action, the collective concern of
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without thought of danger or reward when others need help; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend Jose Cristales upon the occasion of his designation as recipient
of a Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the
New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Jose Cristales.
