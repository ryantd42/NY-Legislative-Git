  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2024, as Jaundice Awareness Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim May 2024, as Jaundice
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Globally,  jaundice  affects  almost  half  of  full-term
newborns  and  80  percent  of  pre-term newborns; in the United States,
three out of five babies are  born  with  jaundice,  resulting  in  many
families having to seek treatment for their children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  New  York  State,  it  is  imperative  for  parents to
understand how to detect the early  warning  signs  of  jaundice,  which
could  potentially spiral into a more serious condition for their child;
and
 
  WHEREAS, A common condition, particularly in babies born  before  38
weeks'  gestation  and  some  breast-fed  babies, jaundice is the yellow
discoloration of a newborn baby and young children's skin and  eyes;  it
occurs  because  the  baby's  blood  contains  an excess of bilirubin, a
yellow pigment of red blood cells, and the baby's liver  is  not  mature
enough to get rid of bilirubin in the bloodstream; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  main  sign of jaundice in infants is the yellowing of
the skin and the whites  of  the  eyes;  this  symptom  usually  appears
between the second and fourth day after birth; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  check for infant jaundice, press gently on your baby's
forehead or nose, if the skin looks yellow  where  you  pressed,  it  is
likely  your  baby has mild jaundice; examine your baby in good lighting
conditions, preferably in natural daylight; and
 
  WHEREAS, The good health and well-being of the people of  the  State
of New York are enhanced by the support of a statewide effort to educate
parents  and  citizens  about  detecting  the  early  warning  signs  of
jaundice, to  prevent  life-threatening  conditions  that  affect  young
children and infants; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  May  2024,  as  Jaundice
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
