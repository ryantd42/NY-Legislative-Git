 Introduced by M. of A. WEPRIN -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Insurance
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the insurance law, the penal law, and the vehicle and
  traffic law, in relation to insurance fraud and combatting  the  theft
  of motor vehicles
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 401 of the insurance law is amended by adding a new
 subsection (d) to read as follows:
  (D) THE SUPERINTENDENT SHALL HAVE AUTHORITY PURSUANT TO  THIS  CHAPTER
 TO  INVESTIGATE  FRAUDULENT  ACTIVITIES  WITH REGARD TO INDIVIDUALS THAT
 OPERATE MOTOR VEHICLES WITH NO INSURANCE  COVERAGE,  AND  MOTOR  VEHICLE
 INSUREDS  WHO MISREPRESENT THE PRINCIPAL PLACE WHERE INSURED MOTOR VEHI-
 CLES ARE GARAGED AND OPERATED. OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLES  WITHOUT  PROPER
 INSURANCE  IN VIOLATION OF ARTICLE SIX OF THE VEHICLE AND TRAFFIC LAW IS
 A SIGNIFICANT DANGER TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE DRIVERS ARE UNABLE TO COMPEN-
 SATE INDIVIDUALS FOR PERSONAL INJURIES, DEATH AND PROPERTY  DAMAGE  THEY
 INFLICT  UPON OTHERS.  FURTHERMORE, MOTOR VEHICLE INSUREDS WHO MISREPRE-
 SENT THE PRINCIPAL PLACE WHERE SUCH VEHICLES ARE  GARAGED  AND  OPERATED
 IMPROPERLY  SHIFT  THEIR  HIGH  LIABILITY  EXPOSURE COSTS TO OTHER MOTOR
 VEHICLE INSUREDS THAT DO NOT FACE SUCH HIGH LIABILITY RISK AND INSURANCE
 PREMIUM COSTS.
  § 2. Subsection (a) of section 405 of the insurance law, as amended by
 section 7 of part A of chapter 62 of the laws of  2011,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  (a)  Any  person  licensed or registered pursuant to the provisions of
 this chapter, and any person engaged in the  business  of  insurance  or
 life  settlement  in this state who is exempted from compliance with the
 licensing requirements of this chapter, including  the  state  insurance
 fund  of  this state, who has reason to believe that an insurance trans-
 action or life settlement act may be fraudulent, or has knowledge that a
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 fraudulent insurance transaction or fraudulent life  settlement  act  is
 about  to take place, or has taken place shall, within thirty days after
 determination by such person that the transaction appears to be  fraudu-
 lent, send to the superintendent on a form prescribed by the superinten-
 dent, the information requested by the form and such additional informa-
 tion  relative  to  the factual circumstances of the transaction and the
 parties involved as the superintendent may require.  The  superintendent
 shall  accept  reports of suspected fraudulent insurance transactions or
 fraudulent life settlement acts from any self insurer, including but not
 limited to self insurers  providing  health  insurance  coverage,  THOSE
 PROVIDING  MOTOR VEHICLE LIABILITY INSURANCE or those defined in section
 fifty of the workers' compensation law, and shall treat such reports  as
 any other received pursuant to this section.
  §  3.  Section  2133 of the insurance law, as amended by chapter 77 of

 employee or agent, KNOWINGLY possesses, transfers or uses: (A) ANY DOCU-
 MENT  WHICH  PURPORTS TO EVINCE INSURANCE COVERAGE WHEN SUCH COVERAGE IS
 NOT IN EFFECT OR IS IN EFFECT AT LIMITS LESS THAN THOSE  STATED  IN  THE
 DOCUMENT;  OR  (B)  a  forged  insurance identification card for a motor
 vehicle, having knowledge, personally or through such employee or agent,
 of the fact that such insurance identification card,  when  issued,  did
 not  actually  represent  an  owner's policy of liability insurance or a
 financial security bond issued by an insurance company  licensed  to  do
 business  in  this  state  covering the motor vehicle identified on such
 card, shall be liable for payment to the people of this state of a civil
 penalty in a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars for the  first  such
 violation  and a sum not exceeding five thousand dollars for each subse-
 quent violation. For the purposes  of  this  section  the  term  "forged
 insurance  identification card" means a written insurance identification
 card which has been falsely made, completed or  altered,  and  the  term
 "falsely  made, completed or altered" shall have the same meaning as set
 forth in section 170.00 of the penal law.
  § 4. Section 165.06 of the penal law, as amended by chapter 413 of the
