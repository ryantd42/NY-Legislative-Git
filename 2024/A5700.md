 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 24 of section 20 of the general  city  law,  as

 given area, and for said purposes to divide  the  city  into  districts.
 Such regulations shall be uniform for each class of buildings throughout
 any  district,  but  the regulations in one or more districts may differ
 from those in other districts. Such regulations  shall  be  designed  to
 secure  safety  from  fire,  flood  and other dangers and to promote the
 public health and welfare, including, so far as conditions  may  permit,
 provision for adequate light, air, convenience of access, and the accom-
 modation  of  solar  energy systems and equipment and access to sunlight
 necessary therefor, and shall be made  with  reasonable  regard  to  the
 character  of  buildings erected in each district, the value of land and
 the use to which it may be put, to the end  that  such  regulations  may
 promote public health, safety and welfare and the most desirable use for
 which  the land of each district may be adapted and may tend to conserve
 the value of buildings and enhance the  value  of  land  throughout  the
 city.
  (B)  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  PROVISION  OF  LAW TO THE CONTRARY, NO CITY
 SHALL:
