  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  200th  Anniversary  of Utica Commandery No. 3, Knights
Templar of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1118, nine Crusader knights took pious vows  to  protect
pilgrims  to  the  Holy Land, forming the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ
and of the Temple of Solomon; and
 
  WHEREAS, A movement began in 1737, among the Freemasons  to  emulate
these  knights,  and  in 1814, what is now known as the Grand Commandery
was formed; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1816, the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar of the USA
was established with DeWitt Clinton elected as its first  Grand  Master;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1823, Grand Master Clinton signed a warrant constituting
what  is now known as Utica Commandery No. 3, to which the City of Utica
continued to provide a home during the Masonically dark time that  began
only three years later; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Utica  Commandery  hosted the Annual Conclave of its Grand
Commandery in 1896, with a parade of thousands of Knights  Templar,  and
welcoming  the  Grand Master of Knights Templar, Prince Hall Affiliated,
in 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  City  of  Utica  is  known  throughout  the  world  as
welcoming  and  assisting  immigrants  and refugees from tyrants, as the
crusader Knights Templar welcomed and protected  pilgrims  to  the  Holy
Land; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  for  some  time,  Utica  was the westernmost
recognized Commandery in New York, seeding Commanderies further west and
spreading Masonic Templary across the state; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, with a steadfast and unwavering  commitment  to  its
community,  Utica  Commandery  No.  3  continues  to  sponsor  clergy
pilgrimages to the Holy Land; this vital organization also supports  the
Knights  Templar  Eye  Foundation  to  improve  vision through research,
education, and care; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  success  of  Utica  Commandery  No.  3  is  in  direct
correlation  to  the efforts of its dedicated members, whose involvement
 
is, and always has been, characterized by an impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to honor and commend
the  members  of Utica Commandery No. 3, Knights Templar of the State of
New York, past and present,  who  have  labored  so  conscientiously  to
secure and improve the quality of life for the community it serves; now,
