 PERSONNEL  RECORD  AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION. A PERSONNEL RECORD SHALL

 UNWARRANTED  INVASION  OF  SUCH OTHER PERSON'S PRIVACY. WITHOUT LIMITING
 THE APPLICABILITY OR GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, ALL OF  THE  FOLLOWING
 WRITTEN  INFORMATION  OR DOCUMENTS TO THE EXTENT PREPARED BY AN EMPLOYER
 REGARDING AN EMPLOYEE SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE PERSONNEL RECORD FOR THAT

  2. AN EMPLOYER SHALL NOTIFY AN EMPLOYEE WITHIN TEN DAYS OF THE EMPLOY-
 ER  PLACING  IN  THE  EMPLOYEE'S PERSONNEL RECORD ANY INFORMATION TO THE
 EXTENT THAT THE INFORMATION IS, HAS BEEN USED OR MAY BE USED,  TO  NEGA-
 TIVELY  AFFECT  THE  EMPLOYEE'S QUALIFICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT, PROMOTION,
 TRANSFER, ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION OR THE POSSIBILITY THAT  THE  EMPLOYEE
 WILL  BE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION. AN EMPLOYER RECEIVING A WRITTEN
 REQUEST FROM AN EMPLOYEE TO  ACCESS  SUCH  EMPLOYEE'S  PERSONNEL  RECORD

 COST TO THE EMPLOYEE, WITHIN FIVE BUSINESS DAYS OF SUBMISSION OF A WRIT-
 TEN REQUEST FOR SUCH COPY TO THE EMPLOYER.  AN  EMPLOYER  SHALL  NOT  BE

 PERSONNEL RECORD, REMOVAL OR CORRECTION OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE MUTU-

 NOT  REACHED, THE EMPLOYEE MAY SUBMIT A WRITTEN STATEMENT EXPLAINING THE
 EMPLOYEE'S POSITION WHICH SHALL BE CONTAINED AND BECOME A PART  OF  SUCH
 EMPLOYEE'S  PERSONNEL  RECORD. THE STATEMENT SHALL BE INCLUDED WHEN SAID
 INFORMATION IS TRANSMITTED TO A THIRD PARTY  AS  LONG  AS  THE  ORIGINAL
 INFORMATION  IS  RETAINED AS PART OF THE FILE. IF AN EMPLOYER PLACES ANY
 INFORMATION IN A PERSONNEL RECORD WHICH SUCH  EMPLOYER  KNEW  OR  SHOULD
 HAVE  KNOWN  TO  BE  FALSE,  THE  EMPLOYEE SHALL HAVE REMEDY THROUGH THE
 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, OTHER PERSONNEL PROCEDURES OR  JUDICIAL
 PROCESS  TO  HAVE  SUCH  INFORMATION  EXPUNGED.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
 SECTION SHALL NOT PROHIBIT THE REMOVAL OF  INFORMATION  CONTAINED  IN  A
 PERSONNEL  RECORD UPON MUTUAL AGREEMENT OF THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE FOR
 ANY REASON.

 THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT, SUCH PERSONNEL  POLICY,  AS  THE
 SAME  MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, SHALL BE CONTINUOUSLY MAINTAINED

 TO THEIR PERSONNEL RECORDS AS THAT PROVIDED BY THIS SECTION.
