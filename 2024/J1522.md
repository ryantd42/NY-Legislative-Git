  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 22, 2024, as Celebrating  Life  Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside  to  increase  important  awareness  of
initiatives that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  January 22, 2024, as
Celebrating Life Day in the State of New York, in conjunction  with  the
observance of National Celebrating Life Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Originally  instituted  to  celebrate  the children in our
lives, Celebrating Life Day has come to signify all that is  good  about
being  alive;  gratitude  is the quality of being thankful; readiness to
show appreciation for and to return kindness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Celebrating  Life  Day  is  the  perfect  opportunity  for
individuals  to make a gratitude jar, get outside and play, indulge in a
childhood favorite activity or  spend  extra  time  with  their  nieces,
nephews, children, grandchildren, or even kids they babysit; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  happy  and  grateful  life  can help people boost one's
immune system, sleep better, improve self-esteem, and  feel  less  pain;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  human life is precious, and Celebrating Life Day is
the day to remind ourselves we are all lucky to be  here  and  lead  the
lives  we  do, and despite our individual and group challenges, there is
always good to be found and gratitude to be shown; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  help  increase
awareness  of initiatives which affect the lives of citizens of New York
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  January 22, 2024, as
Celebrating Life Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
