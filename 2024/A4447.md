 of contact with any law enforcement agency, provided however, incarcera-
 tion  is  permissible if the person intended to hide illegal behavior OR

 TY SUPERVISION IN AN IMPORTANT RESPECT AND SUCH CONDUCT  MAY  RESULT  IN
 SERIOUS  HARM  TO  THE  RELEASEE  OR  OTHERS;  (h) failing to obey other
 special conditions, provided however that incarceration  is  permissible
