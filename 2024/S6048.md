  §  2.  The penal law is amended by adding a new title Y-1-A to read as
 follows:
  TITLE Y-1-A
  DISASTER-RELATED CRIMES
 
  ARTICLE 493
  ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR DISASTER-RELATED CRIMES
 SECTION 493.00 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  493.05 DISASTER-RELATED CRIMES.
  493.10 SENTENCING.
 § 493.00 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
  THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY IT IS  IMPERATIVE
 THAT  THE  STATE  OF NEW YORK HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS FOR THE STREAM-
 LINED PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE, AS WELL AS THE POWERS TO ENSURE THE SAFE-
 TY OF THE PUBLIC AND THE OPERATION OF  LAW.  DURING  EMERGENCIES,  WHERE
 POLICE  AND  FIRE  PERSONNEL  HAVE  THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF EVACUATING,
 RESCUING, AND/OR PROVIDING MEDICAL SERVICES TO ENDANGERED  NEW  YORKERS,
 COMMUNITY  POLICING IS APPROPRIATELY LEFT AS A SECONDARY TASK. NEVERTHE-
 LESS, DURING THESE TIMES OF VULNERABILITY, THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS  OF
 THEFT,  VANDALISM, LOOTING, AND EXPLOITATION OF THOSE IMPACTED. AS SUCH,
 THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVES THAT THE PUNISHMENT FOR THESE CRIMES  SHALL  BE
 PROPORTIONATE TO THE LEVEL OF THREAT AND/OR EMERGENCY PRESENTED TO THESE
 COMMUNITIES,  AND THAT THE GOVERNOR SHALL PROVIDE PUBLIC NOTICE, WHERE A
 STATE DISASTER EMERGENCY HAS BEEN DECLARED, AND THERE  IS  A  REASONABLE
 BELIEF  OF  AN  IMMEDIATE  THREAT  TO PUBLIC SAFETY, THAT THERE EXISTS A
 PERIOD OF ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR THOSE  WHO  TARGET  COMMUNITIES,  BUSI-
 NESSES,  AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FACED WITH NATURAL DISASTERS OR TERROR-
 IST ACTS.
 § 493.05 DISASTER-RELATED CRIMES.

 SPECIFIED OFFENSE AND EITHER:

 S. 6048  3
 
 STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN DECLARED AND THERE IS A BELIEF OR PERCEPTION
 THAT EMERGENCY PERSONNEL ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR POLICING; OR
  B. INTENTIONALLY SELECTS THE TIME PERIOD WHEN THE OFFENSE IS COMMITTED
 OR  INTENDED  TO  BE COMMITTED IN WHOLE OR IN SUBSTANTIAL PART BECAUSE A
 STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN DECLARED AND THERE IS A BELIEF OR PERCEPTION
 THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ABANDONED PROPERTY DUE TO EVACUATION OR PUBLIC SAFE-
 TY EFFORTS.
  FOR PURPOSES OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION,  A  DISASTER-RELATED  CRIME  SHALL
 INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, THE STEALING, EMBEZZLEMENT, OR OBTAINING
 BY FRAUD, FALSE PRETENSES, OR OTHER ILLEGAL MEANS, OF RETAIL MERCHANDISE
