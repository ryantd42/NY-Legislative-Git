BY: M. of A. Barclay
 
  CONGRATULATING  Nancy Fox upon the occasion of her
  retirement after 12 years of  dedicated  service  as
  Executive  Director and Founder of the CNY Community
  Arts Center
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge the
significant milestones in the distinguished careers of those outstanding
community leaders, whose professional lives and civic endeavors serve to
enhance the stature of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Nancy  Fox  upon  the  occasion  of  her  retirement  after  12 years of
distinguished service as Executive  Director  and  Founder  of  the  CNY
Community Arts Center; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2011, Nancy Fox founded the CNY Community Arts Center in
Fulton,  New York, and since then, has rendered faithful, conscientious,
and invaluable service for the greater community; and
 
  WHEREAS, In her capacity as Executive Director, Nancy Fox served the
CNY Community Arts Center with loyalty, honor, and distinction;  in  her
first  year, she mobilized and inspired a group of like-minded residents
to build awareness of the economic and cultural  benefits  of  the  arts
with the common goal "to build a better future through the arts"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  her  vision  and  dedication, Nancy Fox attracted
visual, literary, and performing artists who joined in  the  opportunity
to  offer  the  greater  Fulton  community painting, drawing and theater
classes, art competitions, writing courses, performances, and  more  for
the past 12 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2014, after much success, the CNY Community Arts Center
partnered with Cayuga Community College and moved to the Fulton  campus;
this  move  enabled the center to expand their presence in the community
with an upgraded stage in a newer and more modern facility;  during  the
next  4  years,  the  center's  theater  program experienced exponential
growth; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under Nancy Fox's commendable leadership, the CNY Community
Arts Center continued to grow, flourish and gain in popularity with both
attendees at performances and the  center  attracting  talented  artists
from around the region; and
 
  WHEREAS, Following the success of the Center, a decision was made to
purchase  a  vacant downtown building; and with the community's support,
Fulton's first dedicated community arts center building was created; and
 
  WHEREAS, After multiple infrastructure upgrades to bring  the  1970s
building  to  code,  the  CNY  Community  Arts  Center celebrated a soft
opening, on February 15, 2019, with the premier of "Little  Women,"  the
Broadway musical, on its new stage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Phase two renovations were completed for the new Center in
June of 2019 to improve handicap access, install  new  energy  efficient
lighting  in  the  80-seat  theater,  create two art classrooms, a green
room, two art  galleries,  an  alternative  black  box  theatre  in  the
basement,  a  theater  scene, costume storage area, and art supply room;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, live theater was  put  on
pause  and  revenue  streams  lost,  but  under  Nancy  Fox's  steadfast
leadership, the  Center  diversified  its  services  and  persevered  by
offering art classes with proper social distancing, limited class sizes,
daytime  classes  for  kids  who were learning remotely at home, outdoor
events where possible, and a cookie shop in the  Center's  new  teaching
kitchen; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Center  also  secured  a grant for a movie projection
system, cinema arts and a community presentation space; and
 
  WHEREAS, With COVID-19 restrictions lifted, the Center has been able
to return to full capacity and offer its  slate  of  robust  programming
once again under Nancy Fox's direction; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  her unremitting commitment, Nancy Fox and the CNY
Community Arts Center have made  it  possible  for  the  greater  Fulton
community  to  take part in studio fine arts, writing and culinary arts,
cinema, and performing arts; together,  these  offerings  fill  critical
gaps in art education and quality of life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Along the way, Nancy Fox and the CNY Community Arts Center
have  garnered  financial  and  in-kind  support  from  private  donors,
foundations,  the  Oswego  County  government  leadership,  the  City of
Fulton, state leaders, and state grants to  support  its  vital  mission
over the years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nancy  Fox,  through  her  dedication  to her mission, has
indeed built a "better future through the arts"; and
 
  WHEREAS, As Nancy Fox embarks upon a well-deserved  retirement,  she
leaves  behind an impact which will be felt for generations and a legacy
of appreciation for culture and the arts that will  continue  to  enrich
the lives of many; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Nancy Fox upon the occasion  of  her  retirement  after  12
years  of dedicated service as Executive Director and Founder of the CNY
Community Arts Center and to wish her continued success  in  all  future
endeavors; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Nancy Fox.
