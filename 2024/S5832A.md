 AN  ACT to amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law, in
  relation to increasing the mandatory retirement age of New York  state
  regional park police
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 4 of section 13.17 of the parks, recreation and
 historic preservation law, as amended by chapter  662  of  the  laws  of
 1972, is amended to read as follows:
  4.  Any  member  appointed  on  or after April first, nineteen hundred
 sixty-five shall be separated from such service upon  attaining  [sixty-
 two] SIXTY-FIVE years of age.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  increase the mandatory retirement age from 62 to 65
 for members of the New York State and Local Police and  Fire  Retirement
 System  (NYSLPFRS)  covered under the provisions of section 383-a of the
 Retirement and Social Security Law.
  If this bill is enacted during the  2024  Legislative  Session,  there
 would  be  additional  benefits  for certain members who remain employed
 beyond age 62 which would be funded  by  the  normal  employer  contrib-
 utions.  If  members delay retirement due to the enactment of this bill,
 we do not anticipate any increases in the annual contribution rates  for
 any of the participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
