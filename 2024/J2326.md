  RECOGNIZING May 10, 2024, as World Lupus Day
 
  WHEREAS,  May  10th  is known as World Lupus Day to show support for
the 105,400 New Yorkers, 1.5 million  Americans  and  5  million  people
worldwide  who  suffer  from  the often debilitating effects of Lupus, a
chronic autoimmune disease that can cause severe damage  to  the  tissue
and organs in the body and, in some cases, death; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  year  thousands  of  people are newly diagnosed with
Lupus, the great majority of whom are young people in the prime of their
lives, and 90% of whom are women; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lupus is most prevalent among African-Americans, Hispanics,
Native Americans, and Asians; tragically, thousands of people  die  from
Lupus each year because a cure remains elusive; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  health  professionals  are  unaware  of symptoms and
health effects of Lupus, causing people with Lupus to  suffer  for  many
years  before  they  obtain  a  correct diagnosis and medical treatment,
demonstrating the need for increased public and  professional  awareness
of Lupus; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Medical  research  efforts into Lupus and the discovery of
safer, more effective treatments for Lupus patients are under-funded  in
comparison with diseases of comparable magnitude and severity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Increasing  community  awareness  and  focusing  public
attention on Lupus and its devastating impact on  patients'  lives  will
provide hope for a better future for those affected; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  recognizes  the  needs  of  those
chronically ill people who are living with Lupus and urges all  citizens
to  support  the  search  for  a  cure  and assist those individuals and
families who deal with this devastating disease on a daily  basis;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize May 10, 2024, as World Lupus Day.
