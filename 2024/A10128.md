  (e)  "Women-owned  business  enterprise"  shall mean a business enter-
 prise, including a sole proprietorship, partnership,  limited  liability
 company or corporation that is:
  (i)  at  least  fifty-one  percent  owned by one or more United States

  (ii) an enterprise in which the ownership interest of  such  women  is

  A firm owned by a minority group member who is also  a  woman  may  be
 certified  as  a minority-owned business enterprise, a women-owned busi-
 ness enterprise, or both, and may be counted towards either a  minority-
 owned  business  enterprise  goal  or  a women-owned business enterprise
 goal, in regard to any contract or any goal, set by an agency or author-
 ity, but such participation may not be counted towards both such  goals.
 Such  an  enterprise's  participation  in  a contract may not be divided
 between the minority-owned business enterprise goal and the  women-owned
 business enterprise goal.
  2.  Disparity  study. (a) The department shall commission a state-wide
 disparity study regarding the participation of  minority-owned  business
 enterprises  and  women-owned business enterprises in state contracts to
 be delivered to the governor and the legislature no later  than  January
 1,  2026.  The  study  shall  be  prepared  by an independent entity and
 selected through a request for proposal process. The study shall  deter-
 mine:
  (i)  Whether  there  is  a  disparity  between the number of qualified
 minority-owned business enterprises and women-owned business enterprises
 ready, willing, and able to perform state contracts and  the  number  of
 such contractors actually engaged to perform such contracts; and
  (ii)  What changes, if any, should be made to state policies affecting
 minority-owned business  enterprises  and  women-owned  business  enter-
 prises.

  (b) Upon completion of the study, the department shall post such study
 on its website.
  (c)  Within  one  year  of  the completion of the state-wide disparity
 study commissioned pursuant to this subdivision, the department shall:

 ness enterprises and women-owned business enterprises in the performance
 of  state contracts to the extent that any disparity is revealed by such
 study;
  (ii) Establish  procedures  to  ensure  that  minority-owned  business
 enterprises  and  women-owned  business  enterprises  shall be given the
 opportunity for equitable participation  in  the  performance  of  state
 contracts  and  to assist in identifying those state contracts for which
 minority-owned business enterprises and women-owned business enterprises
 may best bid to achieve the goals set forth pursuant  to  this  subdivi-
 sion;
  (iii)  Provide  for the certification and decertification of minority-
 owned business enterprises and women-owned business enterprises as  such
 and  the  maintenance  by  the department of a current list of certified
 minority-owned business  enterprises  and  women-owned  business  enter-
 prises; and
  (iv)  Collect  statistical  data  concerning  actual  participation of
 minority-owned business enterprises and women-owned business enterprises
 in state contracting.

 priate,  shall  assess the diversity practices of contractors submitting
 bids or proposals in connection with the award of a state  contract  and
 promote the achievement of goals set forth by the department pursuant to
 paragraph (c) of this subdivision.
