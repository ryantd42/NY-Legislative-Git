 except  those that are reasonable and are necessarily expended for games
 of chance supplies and equipment,  prizes,  security  personnel,  stated

 ule of compensation prescribed by the  board,  janitorial  services  and
 utility supplies if any, and license fees, and the cost of bus transpor-
 tation,  if authorized by such clerk or department. No commission, sala-
 ry, compensation, reward or recompense shall be paid  or  given  to  any

 lineal or collateral consanguinity to members of an authorized organiza-
 tion licensed to conduct a raffle.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
