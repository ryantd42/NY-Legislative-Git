 REPRESENTATIVE,  OR  OTHERWISE  AS AN AGENT OF THE PROPRIETOR TO PROVIDE
 ANY SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSE, INFORMATION, ADVICE, OR ACTION  ON  BEHALF  OF
 THE  PROPRIETOR  MAY  NOT DISCLAIM LIABILITY OF ANY KIND WHERE A CHATBOT
 PROVIDES MATERIALLY  MISLEADING,  INCORRECT,  CONTRADICTORY  OR  HARMFUL
 INFORMATION TO A USER THAT RESULTS IN FINANCIAL LOSS OR OTHER DEMONSTRA-
 BLE HARM TO THE USER; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO SUCH LIABILITY SHALL BE
 IMPOSED  WHERE THE PROPRIETOR HAS CORRECTED THE INFORMATION AND SUBSTAN-
 TIALLY OR COMPLETELY CURED THE HARM TO THE USER WITHIN  THIRTY  DAYS  OF
 NOTICE OF SUCH HARM.

 SYSTEM.
  3. PROPRIETORS UTILIZING CHATBOTS SHALL PROVIDE CLEAR, CONSPICUOUS AND
 EXPLICIT  NOTICE  TO  USERS THAT THEY ARE INTERACTING WITH AN ARTIFICIAL
