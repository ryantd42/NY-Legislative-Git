  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 3, 2023, as Employee Appreciation Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative Body that those
employees who faithfully serve the needs of the employer and  the  local
community  with  the  utmost  diligence  and professionalism, profoundly
strengthen our shared commitment to economic and community life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 3, 2023, as Employee
Appreciation Day in the State of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Employee Appreciation Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Observed  annually  on the first Friday in March, National
Employee Appreciation Day was created as a way of focusing the attention
of all  employers,  in  all  industries,  on  employee  recognition;  an
employee's  recognition  and  appreciation  are  both  known  as  key
motivational factors in the workplace; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Employee Appreciation Day  reminds  managers  that
strong  employer-employee  relations  are  at  the  core  of  any  truly
successful business; having a strong relationship with your employees is
an integral part of being a manager, and appreciating their efforts  can
go a long way towards making workers feel valued; and
 
  WHEREAS, The American labor movement has its origins in the earliest
years  of  the  republic  when artisans banded together to maintain wage
levels; the earliest strike in the United States happened in 1768,  when
New York tailors stood their ground against wage reductions; after that,
American craftsmen started organizing guilds and unions to protect wages
and  benefits  for their respective trades, bringing on the beginning of
American trade unionism; and
 
  WHEREAS, On Employee Appreciation Day, businesses and  organizations
plan  celebrations  across  the country recognizing the achievements and
contributions of their employees; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  help  increase
awareness  of initiatives which affect the lives of citizens of New York
State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 3, 2023, as Employee
Appreciation Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
