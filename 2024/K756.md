BY: M. of A. Friend
 
  HONORING  Lydia  Kunte  upon  the  occasion of her
  designation  as  recipient  of  the  President's
  Volunteer  Service  Silver  Award by the President's
  Council on Service and Civic Participation
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time, this  Legislative  Body  takes  note  of
certain  extraordinary  individuals  it  wishes  to  recognize for their
valued contributions to the success and progress of society and publicly
acknowledge their endeavors which have enhanced the basic humanity among
us all; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor Lydia  Kunte
upon  the  occasion  of  her designation as recipient of the President's
Volunteer Service Silver Award by the President's Council on Service and
Civic Participation; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2003, the  President's  Council  on  Service  and  Civic
Participation  founded  the  President's  Volunteer  Service  Award  to
recognize the important role of volunteers  in  America's  strength  and
national  identity;  this  award  honors  individuals  whose  service
positively impacts  communities  in  every  corner  of  the  nation  and
inspires those around them to take action; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over the course of the school year, a group of 39 students,
with  the  assistance  of  Mr. Lindridge, have been engaged in machining
parts  for  prosthetic  legs  with  the  guidance  of  Life  Changer
Manufacturing and SKY (Skilled Knowledgeable Youth) program; SKY aims to
expose  youth to STEM projects that will enhance their abilities through
challenging projects that interest them in engineering and skilled trade
jobs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Mr. Lindridge, the student's  teacher,  decided  to  become
involved with Brian Copes' program, who teaches at Chickasaw High School
in  Mobile,  Alabama  and has been working on prosthetic leg designs for
the past 12  years  with  his  students;  Candor  students  developed  a
mass-production  model  to streamline the creation of 206 ankle and knee
joints and 24 adjustable shin bones, which will ultimately help amputees
in developing countries; and
 
  WHEREAS, With the leadership of  Mr.  Lindridge,  students  involved
with  the  project will interface with other students across the country
to solve manufacturing issues, work with Solidworks to solidify designs,
use Mastercam to program CNC machines and operate machine  tools;  also,
several  of  the  students will be invited to join him and Brian Cope to
fly to Latin America and fit the legs to the recipients; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of this project was amazing, and the Technology
Department at Candor High School hopes to give students the  opportunity
to support this cause and work with other schools year after year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body that those who
enhance the quality of life in their community and have shown a long and
sustained commitment to the  maintenance  of  high  standards  in  their
 
profession,  certainly  have  earned the recognition and applause of all
the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Lydia Kunte upon the occasion of her designation as  recipient  of
the  President's  Volunteer  Service  Silver  Award  by  the President's
Council on Service and Civic Participation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Lydia Kunte.
