 PRIOR  CONVICTION  of  any  individual,  to exclude or to expel from its
 membership such individual or to discriminate in any way against any  of
 its  members  or  against  any employer or any individual employed by an
 employer.
  (d) For any employer or employment agency to  print  or  circulate  or
 cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement or publi-
 cation,  or to use any form of application for employment or to make any
 inquiry in  connection  with  prospective  employment,  which  expresses
 directly  or indirectly, any limitation, specification or discrimination
 as to age, race, creed, color, national  origin,  citizenship  or  immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary  status,  sex,  disability,  predisposing  genetic characteristics,
 familial status, marital status, [or] status as  a  victim  of  domestic
 violence OR STATUS AS A PERSON WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION, or any intent to
 make  any such limitation, specification or discrimination, unless based
 upon a bona fide occupational  qualification;  provided,  however,  that
 neither  this  paragraph  nor any provision of this chapter or other law
 shall be construed to prohibit the department of civil  service  or  the
 department of personnel of any city containing more than one county from
 requesting  information  from  applicants for civil service examinations
 concerning any of the aforementioned characteristics, other than  sexual
 orientation,  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  studies to identify and
 resolve possible problems in  recruitment  and  testing  of  members  of
 minority  groups  to ensure the fairest possible and equal opportunities
 for employment in the civil service for all persons, regardless of  age,
 race,  creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status,
 sexual orientation or gender identity or  expression,  military  status,
 sex,  disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, familial status,
 [or] marital status OR STATUS AS A PERSON WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION.
  (e) For any employer,  labor  organization  or  employment  agency  to
 discharge,  expel  or  otherwise discriminate against any person because
 [he or she] SUCH PERSON has opposed any practices forbidden  under  this
 article or because [he or she] SUCH PERSON has filed a complaint, testi-
 fied or assisted in any proceeding under this article.
  (f) Nothing in this subdivision shall affect any restrictions upon the
 activities  of  persons  licensed  by  the  state  liquor authority with
 respect to persons under twenty-one years of age.
  (g) For an employer to compel an employee who is pregnant  to  take  a
 leave  of  absence,  unless  the employee is prevented by such pregnancy
 from performing the activities involved in the job or  occupation  in  a
 reasonable manner.
  (h)  For  an  employer,  licensing  agency, employment agency or labor
 organization to subject any individual to harassment because of an indi-
 vidual's age, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or  immi-
 gration status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mili-
 tary  status,  sex,  disability,  predisposing  genetic characteristics,
 familial  status,  marital  status,  status  as  a  victim  of  domestic

 because  the  individual has filed a complaint, testified or assisted in
 any proceeding under this article, regardless of whether such harassment
 would be considered severe  or  pervasive  under  precedent  applied  to
 harassment  claims.  Such harassment is an unlawful discriminatory prac-
 S. 9189  3
 
 tice when it subjects an individual to  inferior  terms,  conditions  or
 privileges  of  employment because of the individual's membership in one
 or more of these protected categories.  The fact that  such  individual
 did  not make a complaint about the harassment to such employer, licens-
 ing agency, employment agency or labor organization shall not be  deter-
 minative  of  whether such employer, licensing agency, employment agency
 or labor organization shall be liable. Nothing  in  this  section  shall
 imply  that  an employee must demonstrate the existence of an individual
 to whom the employee's treatment must be compared. It shall be an affir-
 mative defense to liability under this subdivision  that  the  harassing
 conduct  does  not  rise  above the level of what a reasonable victim of
 discrimination with the same protected characteristic or characteristics
 would consider petty slights or trivial inconveniences.

 domestic violence, OR STATUS AS A PERSON WITH  A  PRIOR  CONVICTION  the
 right to be admitted to or participate in a guidance program, an appren-

 familial  status,  marital  status,  [or] status as a victim of domestic

 ification or discrimination as to race, creed, color,  national  origin,

 or expression, military status, sex, age, disability,  familial  status,
