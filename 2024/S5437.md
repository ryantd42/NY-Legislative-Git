 AN ACT to amend the financial services law,  in  relation  to  requiring

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds and declares  all
 of the following:
  (a)  Climate  change is affecting New York's environment, communities,
 and economy with impacts including wildfires, sea  level  rise,  extreme
 weather  events,  extreme droughts, and associated impacts to the global
 economy.
  (b) These impacts are expected to accelerate in coming decades  unless
 aggressive  action  is taken both to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
 to adapt New York's environments, communities and economy.
  (c) Global economic  and  climate  policy  leaders  have  conclusively
 established  that  the  long-term strength of global and local economies
 will depend on their ability to  withstand  the  climate  change-related
 risks  including  physical impacts, economic transitions, and policy and
 legal responses.
  (d) Failure of economic actors to adequately plan  for  and  adapt  to
 climate change-related risks to their businesses and to the economy will
 result  in  significant harm to New York and to individual residents and
 investors, in particular to financially vulnerable  New  York  residents
 who  are employed by, live in communities reliant on or have invested in
 or obtained financing from these institutions.
  (e) New York is a global leader in addressing  climate  change  causes
 and impacts. In recent years, the state has enacted multiple legislative
 measures,  including  enacting  The  Climate  Leadership  and  Community

 Protection Act of 2019 that limits statewide greenhouse gas emissions to
 60% of 1990 levels by 2030 and 15% by 2050, the  formation  of  the  New
 York  state Climate Action Council and the Climate Justice Working Group
 in  2019,  and  enacting the 2021 Soil Health and Climate Resiliency Act
 that encourages management and optimization of soil health  to  mitigate
 and adapt to climate change.
  (f) Leading voluntary initiatives have begun to develop frameworks for
 disclosure  of  climate  change- and sustainability-related information,
 including the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on  Climate-Related
 Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.
  (g) Other jurisdictions have begun to require private and public enti-
 ties  to  develop  and disclose sustainability policies, including Illi-
 nois' Sustainable Investing Act and France's Energy Transition Law Arti-
 cle 173.
  (h)  Given  business  and  financial  institutions'  contributions  to
 climate  change  and  vulnerability  to  its impacts on New York and the
 broader economy and the state's leadership in analyzing, addressing, and
 mitigating climate risks, it is in the interest of the state to  require
 disclosure of climate-related risks and risk-reduction strategies.
