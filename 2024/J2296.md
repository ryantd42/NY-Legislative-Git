  HONORING longtime educational professional Delores
  Roberts  for a lifetime of service upon the occasion
  of her retirement
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that  teachers  of
this great Empire State deserve our recognition as they support students
to  reach  their goals of integration, independence, and equality in our
communities and society at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
longtime  educational  professional  Delores  Roberts  for a lifetime of
service upon the occasion of her retirement; and
 
  WHEREAS, Achieving a wealth of experience and knowledge of the needs
of the Harlem community over her 30-year career, Delores Roberts grew up
exposed to resources and programs that would help her lead a  successful
life  outside  of  Harlem;  she  attended Wadleigh Secondary School from
grades 7 to 9 and her teachers inspired her by providing students with a
wide range of activities and essential tools; and
 
  WHEREAS, Aspiring towards the mission to give back to her  community
and present opportunities to raise awareness and ensure academic success
for  our  youth, Delores Roberts began teaching as a special educator at
Wadleigh; within a year, she became a crisis  intervention  teacher  for
the CEH/CLASS for emotionally handicapped students; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  her tenure, Delores Roberts was able to create
and develop many school-wide initiatives, programs, and events aimed  at
developing  successful  global  productive  citizens;  she  founded Swap
Students  Court  to  create  a  peer-to-peer  system  aimed  to  address
low-level  infractions;  students served as judges, lawyers, and jurors,
which exposed the students to courtrooms and allowed them to participate
in small group workshops facilitated by lawyers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Delores Roberts was the Head Dean and COSA Coordinator  for
Student  Affairs;  Wadleigh  students  also  had  the  opportunity  to
participate in  college  tours,  the  CFES  College  for  Every  Student
program,  foreign  exchange  programs  to  Amsterdam  and  Europe,  Big
Brother/Sister internship programs, and  a  variety  of  extracurricular
activities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Truly  devoted  to  her students and the Harlem community,
Delores Roberts serves as founder and CEO of the Harlem Luft  Initiative
Inc.;  the  organization  is  committed  to  improving  youth,  through
leadership; these programs have become essential for  youth  development
in  New  York's  metropolitan  area,  providing  leadership  innovation
fundamentals, teamwork workshops, and training; and
 
  WHEREAS, The lifework of Delores Roberts is inextricably linked with
the history of Wadleigh; many times over the  past  three  decades,  the
school  has  been slated for closure of diminution and each time Delores
has rallied to the community to save this neighborhood treasure;  today,
 
Wadleigh  Secondary  School  for the Visual and Performing Arts stands a
beacon and is exemplary of the legacy and vision of Delores Roberts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  great  community  is only as great as those persons who
provide exemplary service, whether through  participation  in  voluntary
programs,  through  unique  personal  achievement in their profession or
other endeavors, or simply through a lifetime of good citizenship; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is pleased to have  this  opportunity
to  express  its  highest admiration for Delores Roberts and to wish her
continued success in all of her future endeavors; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  longtime  educational professional Delores Roberts for a lifetime
of service upon the occasion of her retirement; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Delores Roberts.
