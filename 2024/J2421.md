  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2024, as Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness  Month
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2024 as Alzheimer's
and Brain Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  more  than  6  million  people  living  with
Alzheimer's  disease  and dementia in the United States, 410,000 of whom
are New York State residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, Every 65 seconds someone  in  the  United  States  develops
Alzheimer's,  which  could  result  in  an estimated 460,000 New Yorkers
living with the disease by 2025; and
 
  WHEREAS, Alzheimer's kills more  people  than  breast  and  prostate
cancer combined; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  total  cost  of caring for those in the United States
with Alzheimer's disease  and  other  dementias  is  estimated  at  $355
billion in 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Average  per-person  Medicare  spending  for  seniors with
Alzheimer's  is  almost  three  times  higher  than  average  per-person
spending for all other seniors; under Medicaid, spending is, on average,
23 times higher; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Caregivers provide approximately 15.3 billion unpaid hours
of care, of which New York caregivers account  for  586  million  hours,
valued  over 14 billion dollars, to their loved ones who are living with
Alzheimer's disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Findings  from  two  national  surveys  reveal  that
discrimination  is a barrier to Alzheimer's and dementia care; more than
one-third of Black Americans (36%), and  nearly  one-fifth  of  Hispanic
Americans  (18%) and Asian Americans (19%), believe discrimination would
be a barrier to receiving Alzheimer's care; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, half or more of non-White caregivers say  they
have experienced discrimination when navigating health care settings for
their care recipient; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at
the local, State and national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2024, as Alzheimer's
and Brain Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
