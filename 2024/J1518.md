  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 2024, as Diabetic Eye Disease Month in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as Diabetic
Eye  Disease  Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the
observance of National Diabetic Eye Disease Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Diabetic Eye Disease Month focuses attention on keeping our
eyes healthy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each  November,  vision  care  organizations,  physicians,
ophthalmologists,  and  opticians  share  resources  on how diabetes can
decrease their sight; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the National Eye  Institute,  over  7  million
Americans  are  impacted  by diabetic retinopathy, a condition involving
chronic high blood sugar that damages the retina's blood vessels; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  August  16,  1968,  President  Johnson  signed  a  law
establishing  the National Eye Institute; this vital organization became
the first government agency exclusively committed to research  on  human
visual diseases and disorders, a cause championed by LBJ; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  March  of  1993,  a  five-year  follow-up  diabetic
retinopathy results were released, confirming the 95% success  rate  for
the current treatment plans used in maintaining vision; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2000, the National Eye Institute was named the primary
agency for a new vision education project as part of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services People 2010 initiative; and
 
  WHEREAS, Two years later, an Early Manifest  Glaucoma  Trial  showed
that treating early-stage glaucoma patients can slow the disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In December of 2003, a major retinopathy study found early
treatment improved vision for preemies; this was a groundbreaking report
revealing  that  high-risk  premature  infants  gained  better  vision
potential with early treatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health issue, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 2024, as Diabetic
Eye Disease Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
