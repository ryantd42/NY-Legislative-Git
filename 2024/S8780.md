  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

 PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER OR OF ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL OR LOCAL LAW TO THE

 CER, CORRECTION SUPERVISOR, DEPUTY  SHERIFF  PATROL  OR  DEPUTY  SHERIFF
 PATROL SUPERVISOR, PRESENTLY EMPLOYED, AND WHO SHALL HAVE SUSTAINED SUCH

 OTHER IMPAIRMENT OF THE HEART.
  §  3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, none
 of the provisions of this act shall be subject  to  section  25  of  the
 retirement and social security law.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would allow certain members of the New York State and Local
 Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS) employed as correction  officers,
 correction  supervisors, deputy sheriff patrol, or deputy sheriff patrol
 supervisors to receive an accidental disability benefit if the member is
 impaired due to a condition of the heart as a result of an accident,  in
 the performance of their duties, unless the contrary be proven by compe-
 tent evidence. For members in Tiers 1 and 2, the annual benefit would be
 3/4  of  final  average  salary  (FAS) less workers' compensation.  For
 members in Tiers 3-6 who are covered under  the  provisions  of  Article
 14-B  of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL), the annual bene-
 fit would be 2/3 of  FAS  less  workers'  compensation.  For  all  other
 affected members in Tiers 3-6, the annual benefit would be 1/3 of FAS.
  The provisions of Section 25 of the RSSL shall not apply.
  If this legislation is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, it
 would  likely  lead  to more disabilities and deaths being classified as
 "accidental."
  We anticipate that there will be a  total  increase  of  approximately
 $2.84 million in the annual contributions made by the counties employing
 the  affected  members  for  the  fiscal  year ending March 31, 2025. In
 future years this cost will vary as the billing rates and salary of  the
 affected members change, but is expected to average:
 
  Current Plan  Increase to Employer
  Billing Rate
  Article 14-B  0.3% of salary
  89-series, 25-Year Plans  0.2% of salary
 
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $7.42 million which will
 be shared by the State of New York and the local participating employers
 in  the  NYSLERS.  This  estimate  assumes  that payment will be made on
 February 1, 2025.
  Further, we anticipate that there will be some administrative costs to
 implement the provisions of this legislation.
  The number of members and retirees  who  could  be  affected  by  this
 legislation  cannot  be  readily determined, but this cost was developed
 based on the 10,930 affected members covered under RSSL Article 14-B and
 the Section 89 series 25-Year Plans, with annual salary of approximately
 $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2023.
