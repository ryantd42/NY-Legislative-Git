 authorities  law  are  REPEALED and four new subdivisions 7, 8, 9 and 10
 are added to read as follows:
  7. EVERY PUBLIC AUTHORITY THAT OPERATES A CASHLESS  TOLLING  FACILITY,
 TOLLS  BY  MAIL PROGRAM, OR ANY PHOTO-MONITORING SYSTEM SHALL PROMULGATE
 RULES AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING A PROCEDURE BY WHICH A PERSON ALLEGED
 TO BE  LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF A TOLL OR A VIOLATION MAY  APPEAL  SUCH
 ALLEGED  LIABILITY OR VIOLATION. SUCH RULES AND REGULATIONS SHALL ENSURE
 SUCH PUBLIC AUTHORITY COMPLETES ITS  INVESTIGATION  AND  ISSUES,  WITHIN
 THIRTY  DAYS,  TO  THE OWNER A FINAL WRITTEN DETERMINATION OF ANY APPEAL
 PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION. SUCH WRITTEN DETERMINATION SHALL  INCLUDE  THE
 RELEVANT  FACTS  ESTABLISHED,  THE  REASONS  FOR THE DETERMINATION, WHAT
 A. 5214--A  4
 
 ACTIONS MUST BE TAKEN BY THE OWNER  IN  ASSOCIATION  WITH  THE  DETERMI-
 NATION, AND WHAT FURTHER PROCEDURES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE OWNER.
  8.  ADJUDICATION OF AN OWNER'S LIABILITY SHALL BE BY THE ENTITY HAVING
 JURISDICTION OVER THE CASHLESS TOLLING FACILITY OR, WHERE AUTHORIZED, BY
 AN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL AND ALL SUCH LIABILITY  DETERMINATIONS  SHALL
 BE  HEARD  AND  DETERMINED  EITHER: (A) IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE OBLI-
 GATION TO PAY A TOLL THROUGH THE CASHLESS TOLLING PROGRAM WAS ALLEGED TO
 OCCUR; OR (B) WHERE THE TOLL IS ALLEGED TO HAVE  BEEN  INCURRED  IN  THE
 CITY  OF  NEW  YORK  AND UPON THE CONSENT OF BOTH PARTIES, IN ANY COUNTY
 WITHIN THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN WHICH THE PUBLIC  AUTHORITY  OPERATES  OR
 MAINTAINS A CASHLESS TOLLING FACILITY. SUCH ADJUDICATIONS SHALL BE HEARD
 AND  DETERMINED  IN  THE  SAME  MANNER  AS  CHARGES  OF OTHER REGULATORY
 VIOLATIONS OF SUCH PUBLIC AUTHORITY OR PURSUANT TO THE RULES  AND  REGU-
 LATIONS OF SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL AS THE CASE MAY BE.
  9.  IT  SHALL  BE  A VALID DEFENSE TO AN ALLEGATION OF LIABILITY FOR A
 TOLL AND/OR VIOLATION  THAT:
  (A)  THE VEHICLE WAS NOT USED OR OPERATED IN INCURRING A TOLL PURSUANT
 TO THIS SECTION OR THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED HEREUNDER;
  (B) THE VEHICLE WAS USED OR OPERATED WITHOUT  THE  PERMISSION  OF  THE
 OWNER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED;
  (C)  THE  RECIPIENT  OF A NOTICE OF LIABILITY, PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION
 FIVE  OF  THIS SECTION, WAS NOT THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME THE
 OBLIGATION TO PAY THE  TOLL OCCURRED;
  (D) THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN STOLEN PRIOR TO THE TIME THE  OBLIGATION  WAS
 INCURRED  AND  WAS  NOT  IN  THE POSSESSION OF THE OWNER AT THE TIME THE
 OBLIGATION WAS INCURRED. FOR THE PURPOSES OF ASSERTING THIS DEFENSE,  IT
 SHALL  BE  SUFFICIENT  THAT A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE POLICE REPORT ON THE
 STOLEN VEHICLE IS SUBMITTED TO THE  PUBLIC  AUTHORITY,  COURT  OR  OTHER
 ENTITY HAVING JURISDICTION; AND
  (E)  THE  VEHICLE  HAD  BEEN  LEASED  AT  THE  TIME THE OBLIGATION WAS
 INCURRED. FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING THIS DEFENSE, IT SHALL BE  SUFFI-
 CIENT  THAT A COPY OF THE RENTAL LEASE OR OTHER CONTRACT DOCUMENT COVER-
 ING THE VEHICLE ON THE DATE AND TIME THE  TOLL  WAS  INCURRED  HAS  BEEN
 SUBMITTED  TO  THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY, COURT OR OTHER ENTITY HAVING JURIS-
 DICTION WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE LESSOR RECEIVING THE  FIRST  NOTICE  OF
 LIABILITY  PURSUANT  TO SUBDIVISION FIVE OF THIS SECTION.  SUCH DOCUMENT
 SHALL INCLUDE THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF  THE  LESSEE.  FAILURE  TO  TIMELY
 SUBMIT SUCH INFORMATION SHALL CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF THIS DEFENSE. WHERE
 THE  LESSOR  COMPLIES  WITH  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, THE LESSEE
 SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE THE OWNER OF THE  VEHICLE  FOR  PURPOSES  OF  THIS
 SECTION  AND  SHALL  BE  SUBJECT  TO LIABILITY PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION,
 PROVIDED THAT THE AUTHORITY MAILS A TOLL BILL TO THE LESSEE  WITHIN  TEN
 DAYS  AFTER THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY, COURT OR OTHER ENTITY HAVING JURISDIC-
 TION, DEEMS THE LESSEE TO BE THE OWNER.
  10. IF THE OWNER LIABLE FOR A  TOLL  OR  VIOLATION  PURSUANT  TO  THIS
 SECTION  WAS  NOT  THE  OPERATOR OF THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME THE TOLL WAS
 INCURRED, SUCH OWNER MAY MAINTAIN AN ACTION FOR INDEMNIFICATION  AGAINST
 THE OPERATOR.

 REPEALED and subdivisions 13 and 14 are renumbered subdivisions  11  and
 12.

 microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images  prepared  pursuant
 A. 5214--A  5
 
 to  this section shall be for the exclusive use of a public authority in
 the discharge of its duties under this section and shall not be open  to
 the  public nor be used in any court in any action or proceeding pending
 therein unless such action or proceeding relates to the imposition of or
 indemnification  for  liability  pursuant  to  this  section. The public
 authority, INCLUDING ANY SUBSIDIARY OR CONTRACTOR INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENT-
 ING OR OPERATING ANY CASHLESS TOLLING FACILITY, PHOTO-MONITORING SYSTEM,
 ELECTRONIC TOLL COLLECTION SYSTEM OR TOLL BY  MAIL  PROGRAM,  shall  not

 of electronic toll collection system account holders, OR ANY OWNER  THAT
 PARTICIPATES  IN,  OR  IS  SUBJECT TO, SUCH SYSTEMS OR PROGRAMS, without
 such account holders' OR OWNERS' consent to any  entity  that  will  use
 such  information for any commercial purpose provided that the foregoing
 restriction shall not be deemed to preclude the exchange of such  infor-
 mation  between any entities with jurisdiction over [and] SUCH SYSTEM OR
 PROGRAMS or [operating] THE OPERATION OF a toll  highway  bridge  and/or
 tunnel facility.
