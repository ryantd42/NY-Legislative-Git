  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  December 16, 2024, as Bangladesh Victory Day in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the people of this State  acknowledge  significant  days  of  historical
importance; Victory Day in Bangladesh is such an event; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Liberation  War,  also known as the Bangladesh War of
Independence, began after the Pakistani military  junta  based  in  West
Pakistan  launched  Operation  Searchlight  against  the  people of East
Pakistan on the night of March 25, 1971; and
 
  WHEREAS, The war ended on December 16,  1971,  after  West  Pakistan
surrendered and Bangladesh sent them back to their country by expressing
a spirit of generosity and forgiveness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Victory Day is a national holiday in Bangladesh, celebrated
on  December  16th  each  year  to commemorate the victory of the allied
forces over the Pakistani forces in the Bangladesh Liberation War; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Commanding Officer of the Pakistani Forces, General AAK
Niazi, surrendered to the Allied Forces Commander, General Jagjit  Singh
Aurora  of  Bangladesh,  which  marked  the  end  of the nine-month-long
Bangladesh Liberation War  and  the  1971  official  secession  of  East
Pakistan into Bangladesh; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bangladesh  Victory Day is observed as a national holiday;
the country's government begins the day with 31  rounds  of  gunfire  at
sunrise, and
 
  WHEREAS,  Special  prayers at all Armed Forces Mosques for peace and
advancement of the nation and the continuous progress  of  Armed  Forces
are employed on this special day; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is custom for the Honorable President and Prime Minister
to  pay  their  respects  at  the National Mausoleum and memorial of the
martyrs of the Liberation War on this day annually; and
 
  WHEREAS, The total number of lives lost as a cause of the Bangladesh
Liberation War, both military and civilian, is estimated to fall in  the
range  of  500,000 to 3 million; these casualties serve as a reminder of
the cost of freedom, urging the beneficiaries of said freedom  to  never
take it for granted; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  proud  to acknowledge various
cultures and practices of people who add to the overall diversity of our
State, and, on this occasion, we take the opportunity to  recognize  the
contributions  made by the Bangladesh-American community and extend best
wishes to all  its  members  as  they  hold  appropriate  ceremonies  to
commemorate this important day; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  December  16,  2024,  as
Bangladesh Victory Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of New York.
