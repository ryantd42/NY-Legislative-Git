BY: Senator GRIFFO
 
  COMMENDING  Andrew  Costello  upon the occasion of
  his designation as recipient of a Liberty Medal, the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
honor  those  distinguished  officers  and  citizens  who  would  devote
themselves to public service, demonstrating great courage and  diligence
in  providing  for  the  care  and  welfare  of  the  citizens  of their
communities and this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within every community of the State of New York  there  are
certain  individuals  who, by virtue of their commitment and dedication,
command  the  respect  and  admiration  of  their  community  for  their
exemplary contributions and service on behalf of others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is justly proud to commend Andrew
Costello upon the occasion of his designation as recipient of a  Liberty
Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed upon an individual by the New York
State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established  by
Resolution  and  is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have merited special
commendation for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf  of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A remarkable Oneida Nation police officer from Bridgeport,
New York, Andrew Costello is worthy of recognition for his actions  that
saved the life of another individual; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  Sunday  February  4,  2024, Andrew Costello heroically
rescued his neighbor who had fallen through the  ice  while  fishing  on
Oneida  Lake;  while off duty, and with no hesitation, he called 911 and
grabbed a ladder to run to the aid of the fisherman; and
 
  WHEREAS, Using the ladder and remaining calm under pressure,  Andrew
Costello  was  able to safely pull the fisherman from the ice and assist
him to shore; Oneida Indian Nation Police and members of the  Bridgeport
Fire Department reported to the scene shortly after; and
 
  WHEREAS,  EMTs  on  scene reported that the fisherman's safety float
suit was severely waterlogged and if Andrew Costello had  not  acted  as
quickly as he did, the fisherman would not have survived; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Andrew  Costello's  brave  and  swift  response  to  this
life-saving incident is a  testament  to  the  values  he  holds  as  an
individual;  he has shown his commitment to the safety and well-being of
Oneida Indian  Nation  Members  and  residents  of  Oneida  and  Madison
Counties; and
 
  WHEREAS, For his astute and courageous actions, Oneida Indian Nation
Representative  Ray  Halbritter  and  Oneida  Indian Nation Police Chief
David Verne awarded Costello for his life-saving efforts; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body that those
dedicated public servants who unselfishly  devote  their  lives  to  the
preservation  of  order  and the protection of others are worthy and due
full praise for their commitment and noble endeavors; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commend  Andrew  Costello  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  as
recipient of a  Liberty  Medal,  the  highest  honor  bestowed  upon  an
individual by the New York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Andrew Costello.
