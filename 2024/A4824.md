 Introduced  by M. of A. RAMOS -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Economic Development
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in  relation  to  providing  for  the
  regulation  of  the sale, use and storage of nitric acid; and to amend
  the penal law, in relation to disseminating material on  the  manufac-
  ture of an explosive

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds that while
 there are important uses for substances like nitric acid, it  is  impor-
 tant  that  we  safeguard these substances in order to prevent them from
 being used to harm both people and property. Nitric acid can be used  to
 cause  harmful  explosions and its use carries the ability, if fallen in
 the wrong hands, of resulting in massive destruction.
  Currently, the sale of nitric acid is not regulated on an  appropriate
 level.  Retailers  are  not  required to check the identification of the
 buyers when selling them nitric acid. They  are  also  not  required  to
 maintain  records  of  the  sale.  This act would require that retailers
 check the identification of buyers purchasing  nitric  acid  and  record
 their name and address.
  In  addition,  there are no standard rules or requirements maintaining
 the security of nitric acid in academia. While this act does not  hinder
 the  important  academic  work  that surrounds the use of nitric acid in
 colleges, universities and even high schools, it  would  provide  a  set
 standard  ensuring  we  do  our part in not allowing our academic insti-
 tutions to become tools for potential terrorists.
  Finally, while the advent of the internet has  provided  us  countless
 benefits,  it  has also increased the threat we face from people looking
 to harm Americans, using information widely available on the  web.  This
 act  bans websites that provide guides on taking nitric acid and turning
 it into explosives.

 MADE AVAILABLE TO THE DIRECTOR, AND ANY OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE STATE
 OFFICE OF HOMELAND SECURITY.
