  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 11, 2024, as Coming Out Day in the State  of
  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the observance of
  National Coming Out Day
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are set aside to celebrate diversity, and in doing
so, help to enfranchise all populations within the larger  community  of
humanity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  October 11, 2024, as
Coming Out Day in the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Coming Out Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Coming  Out  Day (NCOD) is celebrated on October
11th each year; the first observation was in 1988, and by 1990,  it  was
being celebrated in all 50 states; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  October  11th, NCOD will continue to raise awareness
for individuals within the LGBTQ+ community, and champion the idea  that
homophobia thrives in silence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On this day, many people who identify as LGBTQ+ will "come
out" (a term stemming from the phrase  "come  out  of  the  closet")  to
friends or family about their sexuality, which is a very big moment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Coming  out  never  ends,  for the last twenty-five years,
October 11 continues to  raise  awareness  for  individuals  within  the
LGBTQ+  community,  and  champion  the  idea  that homophobia thrives in
silence; and
 
  WHEREAS, NCOD  was  inspired  by  a  single  march;  500,000  people
participated  in  the  March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights on
October 11, 1987, generating momentum which lasted four months after the
march had ended; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this period, over  one  hundred  LGBTQ+  identifying
individuals gathered outside Washington, D.C., and decided on creating a
national  day to celebrate coming out; this began on the 1st Anniversary
of their historic march; and
 
  WHEREAS, It was Rob Eichberg and Jean O'Leary who first proposed the
idea of NCOD;  Rob  Eichberg  founded  a  person  growth  workshop,  The
Experience,  and  at the time, Jean O'Leary was the head of National Gay
Rights Advocates; and
 
  WHEREAS, Rob Eichberg, who would later die in 1995 of  complications
from  AIDS, had said the strongest tool in the human rights movement was
to illustrate that most people already know and respect someone  in  the
LGBTQ+ community, and NCOD helps these people come to light; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There have also been different spokespeople for each NCOD;
some notable names include "Frasier"  actor,  Dan  Butler  and  Candance
Gingrich, half-sister of Newt Gingrich, in the 1990s; and
 
  WHEREAS,  NCOD  gains  popularity and participants every year; since
its inception, countless public  figures  and  celebrities  have  openly
identified  themselves  as  LGBTQ+, and yearly share messages of support
and hope for those still in the closet; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recent years, numerous public figures have  "come  out,"
bravely  demonstrating  their  pride  and assurance of self-worth to all
those who look up to them; these individuals  include  Madame  Cassandra
Uzumaki  LaQueer  of  RuPaul's  Drag  Race  season 4; Sean Gunn, Olympic
swimmer representing Zimbabwe in the 2016 Rio  Olympics;  and  WNBA  and
Chicago  Sky  star,  Candace  Parker, among many other brave individuals
taking admirable, bold steps into a new chapters of their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Diversity is one of New York  State's  greatest  strengths,
and  this  Legislative Body supports the LGBT+ community and is proud to
join them in celebrating Coming Out Day; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorializing  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim October 11, 2024, as
Coming Out Day in the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Coming Out Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
