  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 8-12, 2024,  as  Early  Childhood  Educator  and
  Child  Care  Provider Appreciation Week In the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Child care plays an essential role for working parents;  an
estimated  844,100  children under the age of 6 live in households where
all available adults were in the labor force; and
 
  WHEREAS, Child care providers offer care  vital  to  the  growth  of
young  children; beyond preparing meals and changing diapers, child care
workers provide the building  blocks  of  intellectual,  emotional,  and
social development for children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In New York State, 94% of the child care workforce is made
of women, compared to 49% of workers in other occupations; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite the important nature of their work, people who work
in the child care industry are among the most underpaid and  undervalued
in New York State, twelve percent of early childhood educators and child
care workers in New York State fall below the poverty line; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New York State's child day care services industry was hard
hit  at  the  onset  of  the  pandemic  and  heavily  impacted  by  the
restrictions put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Child  care  provides  a number of services, including the
provision  of  nurturance  and  learning  opportunities  for  children,
preparation  for  school,  support  for working parents and reduction of
poverty, respite care in child welfare cases, and access to supplemental
services such as vision and hearing  screening,  developmental  testing,
feeding programs, and even parent support and literacy programs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Beneficial  outcomes  for  children  are  associated  with
settings that provide both nurturance and support for early learning and
language development; now therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 8-12, 2024, as Early
Childhood Educator and Child Care Provider Week in New York  State,  and
to  recognize the important services provided by child care providers to
New York's Communities; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the New York State Chairs of Children's Committee.
