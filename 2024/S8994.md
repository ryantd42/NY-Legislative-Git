 amount  allowed  by  this section or the maximum rent or legal regulated
 rent does not exceed one-third of the combined income of all members  of
 the  household, may submit a new application during the following calen-
 dar year, and if such head of the household  receives  a  rent  increase
 exemption order that commences during such calendar year, the tax abate-
 ment  amount  for  such  order shall be calculated as if such prior rent
 increase exemption order had not  expired.  However,  no  tax  abatement
 benefits may be provided for the period of ineligibility.

 exemption  orders calculated as if a prior rent increase exemption order
