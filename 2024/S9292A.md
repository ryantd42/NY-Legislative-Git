 the district from sources other than a school district, board of cooper-
 ative  educational services or county vocational education and extension

 ment for the lease of a motor vehicle or vehicles shall be for a term of
 more  than  one  school year, provided that when authorized by a vote of
 the qualified voters of the district such lease may have a term of up to
 five years, or [twelve] EIGHT  years  for  the  lease  of  zero-emission

  §  3.  Paragraph  e  of subdivision 7 of section 3602 of the education
 law, as amended by section 3 of subpart A of part B of chapter 56 of the
 laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  e. In determining approved transportation capital,  debt  service  and
 lease expense for aid payable in the two thousand five--two thousand six
 school  year  and  thereafter,  the  commissioner,  after  applying  the
 provisions of paragraph c of this subdivision  to  such  expense,  shall
 establish  an  assumed amortization pursuant to this paragraph to deter-
 mine the approved capital, debt service and lease expense of the  school
 district  that is aidable in the current year, whether or not the school
 district issues debt for such expenditures,  subject  to  any  deduction
 pursuant  to  paragraph d of this subdivision. Such assumed amortization
 shall be for a period of five years, and for the  two  thousand  twenty-
 two--two  thousand  twenty-three school year and thereafter such assumed
 amortization for zero-emission school buses as defined in section  thir-
 ty-six  hundred  thirty-eight of this article and related costs pursuant
 to paragraph f of subdivision two of section thirty-six hundred  twenty-
 three-a  of  this article shall be for a period of [twelve] EIGHT years,
 and shall commence twelve months after the school district enters into a
 purchase contract or lease of the school bus, charging station, hydrogen
 fueling  station,  or  equipment,  or  a  general  contract  for  the
 construction,  reconstruction,  lease  or  purchase  of a transportation
 storage facility or site in an amount less than  ten  thousand  dollars.
 Such assumed amortization shall provide for equal semiannual payments of
 principal  and interest based on an assumed interest rate established by
 the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph. By the first day of Septem-
 ber of the current year commencing with the two thousand five--two thou-
 sand six school year, each school district shall provide to the  commis-
 sioner  in  a  format prescribed by the commissioner such information as
 the commissioner shall require for all capital  debt  incurred  by  such
 school  district during the preceding school year for expenses allowable
 pursuant to subdivision two of section thirty-six hundred twenty-three-a
 of this article. Based on such reported amortizations and a  methodology
 prescribed  by  the  commissioner in regulations, the commissioner shall
 compute an assumed interest rate that shall equal  the  average  of  the
 interest  rates  applied  to  all  such debt issued during the preceding
 school year. The assumed interest rate shall be  the  interest  rate  of
 each  such  school  district  applicable  to  the  current  year for the
 purposes of this paragraph and shall be expressed as a decimal  to  five
 places rounded to the nearest eighth of one-one hundredth.
