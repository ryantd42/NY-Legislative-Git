  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Neurofibromatosis Month in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Neurofibromatosis Month
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Neurofibromatosis Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Neurofibromatosis  (NF),  a  debilitating  tumor  disorder,
affects more than 130,000 Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS, Neurofibromatosis Northeast has worked for over 30 years on
its mission to find a cure for NF; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  mission  to  finding a treatment and cure for NF,
Neurofibromatosis Northeast promotes  research,  creates  awareness  and
supports those who are affected by NF; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Growing  awareness  of  NF  has  resulted  in  increased
investment in research through private charities such  as  NF  Northeast
and  the  NF  Research  Program  in  the Department of Defense which has
resulted in new clinical trials involving  application  of  drugs  which
have been shown to reduce malignant tumors in cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2019, the FDA approved the use of Koselugo (selumetinib)
for  treatment of NF1, and  promising science using combination therapy,
gene therapy and bacterial  therapy  has  led  to  new  clinical  trials
offering hope for families dealing with the uncertainties of NF; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Increased  awareness  of  NF  will  help initiate critical
research;  NF  patients  and  their  families  are  determined  to  make
Neurofibromatosis a household word; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative that there be greater awareness of this
serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity  at
the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as
Neurofibromatosis Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
