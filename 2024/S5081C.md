 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to establishing the warehouse
  worker injury reduction program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "warehouse
 worker injury reduction program".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares that:
  (a) Workplace injuries can take a  terrible  toll  on  workers,  their
 families  and  their  communities,  and can create substantial costs for
 employers. According to recent data (2022) released  by  the  bureau  of
 labor  statistics,  the  warehouse  industry in New York state reports a
 rate of the most serious work-related injuries involving  lost  time  or
 restricted duty (7.8 cases/100 full-time workers) that is more than five
 times  the  average  rates  of  these  types of injuries for all private
 industry in New York state (1.5 cases/100 full-time workers).  In  2022
 alone,  there  were 5,472 workers injured in the warehousing industry in
 New York state.  The most common types of  work-related  serious  injury
 reported  by employers in the warehouse sector are musculoskeletal inju-
 ries, which often require workers to miss work  and  can  force  workers
 permanently out of the job and even out of the workforce.
  (b)  The  amount  and severity of injuries in New York's warehouses is
 having a direct impact on public health and safety. Each year, thousands
 of injured warehouse workers return to their  communities  with  chronic

 back,  neck,  shoulder and wrist pain that is often remedied by opiates.
 This feeds into the opiate epidemic that is  at  crisis  levels  in  our
 state.
  (c)  Many  communities  in  New  York  are underserved by full-service
 supermarkets and other essential stores and lack access  to  transporta-
 tion  to  buy  these essential supplies. Online retail may be their only
 source of basic necessities, including medical supplies  and  food.  The
 high  rate  of injuries at warehouses could lead to service disruptions,
 jeopardizing the health and safety of our communities. In fact,  accord-
 ing  to  an internal Amazon memo leaked to the press in 2021, Amazon has
 concerns that given the injury rates in the industry,  it  will  deplete
 the  available  warehouse labor supply in its U.S. network by 2024. This
 could impact the entire warehouse and  distribution  network,  impacting
 the public health of our communities.
  §  3. Section 780 of the labor law is amended by adding two new subdi-
 visions 8 and 9 to read as follows:
  8. "MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES AND DISORDERS" MEANS WORK  RELATED  INJU-
 RIES,  OR DISORDERS, OF THE MUSCLES, NERVES, TENDONS, LIGAMENTS, JOINTS,
 CARTILAGE OF THE UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS, NECK AND LOWER  BACK  (INCLUDING
 SPINAL  DISCS)  THAT:  (A)  ARE  CAUSED  BY SUDDEN OR SUSTAINED PHYSICAL
 EXERTION; OR (B) ARE NOT THE RESULT OF  ANY  INSTANTANEOUS  NON-EXERTION
 EVENT, SUCH AS SLIPS, TRIPS, OR FALLS.
  9.  "QUALIFIED  ERGONOMIST"  MEANS AN ERGONOMIST WHO IS ABLE TO DEMON-
 STRATE PROFICIENCY IN THE CORE, MINIMUM COMPETENCIES OF  ERGONOMICS  AND
 INJURY PREVENTION, AS DEFINED BY THE COMMISSIONER. UNTIL THE COMMISSION-
 ER DEFINES SUCH COMPETENCIES AND APPROVES ERGONOMISTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 SUCH  COMPETENCIES,  CONSULTANTS  APPROVED  BY THE COMMISSIONER UNDER 12
 NYCRR 59 AND 60 WITH A CREDENTIAL AS A CERTIFIED SAFETY PROFESSIONAL  OR
 CERTIFIED INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST SHALL BE DEEMED TO QUALIFY AS AN ERGONOM-
 IST.

 sion 3 to read as follows:
