  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding
 a new section 605-h to read as follows:
  § 605-H. ACCIDENTAL  DISABILITY  RETIREMENT  FOR  DEPUTY  SHERIFFS  IN
 ORANGE COUNTY. A. A MEMBER EMPLOYED AS A DEPUTY SHERIFF IN ORANGE COUNTY
 SHALL  BE  ENTITLED TO AN ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE IF,
 AT THE TIME APPLICATION THEREFOR IS FILED, SUCH MEMBER IS:
  1. PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY INCAPACITATED FOR PERFORMANCE OF DUTY AS THE
 NATURAL AND PROXIMATE RESULT OF AN  ACCIDENT,  UNLESS  THE  CONTRARY  BE
 PROVED  BY  COMPETENT  EVIDENCE, NOT CAUSED BY SUCH MEMBER'S OWN WILLFUL
 NEGLIGENCE, SUSTAINED IN SUCH SERVICE AND WHILE ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF THE
 RETIREMENT SYSTEM; AND
  2. ACTUALLY IN SERVICE UPON WHICH SUCH MEMBER'S MEMBERSHIP  IS  BASED.
 HOWEVER,  IN  A  CASE WHERE A MEMBER IS DISCONTINUED FROM SERVICE SUBSE-
 QUENT TO THE ACCIDENT, EITHER VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY, AND PROVIDED
 THAT THE MEMBER MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF PARAGRAPH ONE OF THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION, APPLICATION MAY BE MADE NOT LATER THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE  MEMBER

 MEMBER'S  BEHALF  SHALL  HAVE  FILED WRITTEN NOTICE IN THE OFFICE OF THE
 COMPTROLLER WITHIN NINETY DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT, SETTING FORTH:
  (A) THE TIME WHEN AND THE PLACE WHERE SUCH ACCIDENT OCCURRED; AND
  (B) THE PARTICULARS THEREOF; AND
  (C) THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE MEMBER'S INJURIES; AND
  (D) SUCH MEMBER'S ALLEGED INCAPACITY.
  2. THE NOTICE HEREIN REQUIRED NEED NOT BE GIVEN:
  (A)  IF  THE NOTICE OF SUCH ACCIDENT SHALL BE FILED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
 THE PROVISIONS OF THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION  LAW  OF  ANY  STATE  WITHIN
 WHICH A PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER IN ORANGE COUNTY SHALL HAVE ITS EMPLOYEES
 LOCATED  OR  PERFORMING  FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES WITHIN THE NORMAL SCOPE OF
 THEIR EMPLOYMENT; OR
  (B) IF THE APPLICATION FOR ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY RETIREMENT  IS  FILED
 WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF SUCH ACCIDENT; OR
  (C)  IF A FAILURE TO FILE NOTICE HAS BEEN EXCUSED FOR GOOD CAUSE SHOWN
 AS PROVIDED BY RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE COMPTROLLER.
  D. IF THE COMPTROLLER DETERMINES THAT  THE  MEMBER  IS  PHYSICALLY  OR
 MENTALLY  INCAPACITATED  FOR  THE  PERFORMANCE  OF  DUTY AND OUGHT TO BE
 RETIRED FOR ACCIDENTAL DISABILITY, SUCH MEMBER SHALL BE SO RETIRED. SUCH
 RETIREMENT SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AS OF A DATE APPROVED BY THE COMPTROLLER.
  E. THE ANNUAL RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE PAYABLE UPON ACCIDENTAL  DISABILITY
 RETIREMENT  SHALL  BE A PENSION OF THREE-QUARTERS OF SUCH MEMBER'S FINAL
 AVERAGE SALARY. THE PAYMENT OF SUCH PENSION  SHALL  BE  SUBJECT  TO  THE
 PROVISIONS OF SECTION SIXTY-FOUR OF THIS CHAPTER.
  F.  IF  THE  MEMBER, AT THE TIME OF THE FILING OF AN APPLICATION UNDER

 APPLICATION IS FILED WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE APPLICATION FOR ACCIDENTAL
 DISABILITY RETIREMENT.
  G. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION  OF  LAW,  THIS  SECTION  SHALL
 APPLY  TO  DEPUTY  SHERIFFS  IN ORANGE COUNTY WHO WERE HIRED ON OR AFTER
 JULY TWENTY-SEVENTH, NINETEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX.
  § 2. All costs associated with implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by Orange county.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would establish an improved  accidental  disability  benefit
 for  eligible members of the New York State and Local Employees' Retire-
 ment System in Tiers 3 through 6 who are employed by  Orange  County  as
 deputy sheriffs. The improved disability benefit would be three-quarters
 of final average salary less workers' compensation. The current disabil-
 ity  benefit is two-thirds of final average salary less workers' compen-
 sation.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of  approximately  $21,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of Orange County for the fiscal year ending March
 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary but is expected to average
 0.2% of salary annually.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $108,000 which  will  be
 borne  by  Orange  county  as a one-time payment.  This estimate assumes
 that payment will be made on February 1, 2025.
 S. 9628--A  3
 
  These estimated costs are based on 86  affected  members  employed  by
 Orange  county,  with annual salary of approximately $10.5 million as of
 March 31, 2023.
