BY: Senator MANNION
 
  COMMENDING  Tom  Drumm  upon  the  occasion of his
  designation as recipient of  a  Liberty  Medal,  the
  highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the New
  York State Senate
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend the caring concern and  heroic  acts  of  individuals  who  take
prompt  and  appropriate  action  in emergency situations, nobly risking
their own lives in an effort to preserve the life of another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Tom Drumm upon the occasion of his designation as recipient of a
Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the  New
York State Senate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Senate Liberty Medal was established by
Resolution and is  awarded  to  individuals  who  have  merited  special
commendation  for exceptional, heroic, or humanitarian acts on behalf of
their fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, On April 23, 2024, 31-year-old Tom Drumm was  driving  down
Route  31 in Clay, New York, when an SUV went off the road and landed in
a retention pond; and
 
  WHEREAS, Without hesitation, Tom Drumm hopped out  of  his  vehicle,
ran  straight  toward  the accident, and began swimming to the middle of
the pond; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tom Drumm and another gentleman found a woman  in  the  car
with the window down; the two brave men pried the car door open, pulling
hard  against the weight of the water; when the door finally opened, the
car began to fill with water and sink; and
 
  WHEREAS, While the second gentleman brought the woman to shore,  Tom
Drumm  stayed  in  the  water,  examining  the  car  to  ensure no other
passengers or pets were trapped before exiting the freezing  cold  pond;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tom  Drumm  met  this extraordinary emergency with equally
extraordinary courage; and
 
  WHEREAS, Justly recognized as a hero, Tom Drumm  richly  merits  the
admiration  of  this  Legislative  Body  and  his  community  for  his
consummate, swift action in saving the life of this woman in need; and
 
  WHEREAS, Moreover, Tom Drumm should be meritoriously  commended  for
remaining  calm  under  pressure  and for showing valor and true courage
while performing a lifesaving deed; and
 
  WHEREAS, Tom Drumm, in his spontaneous and heroic act, has so  aptly
demonstrated  his  character  and  compassion for the welfare of others,
personifying, by  virtue  of  his  action,  the  collective  concern  of
 
ordinary citizens across the community of New York State who voluntarily
respond  without  thought of danger or reward when others are in need of
help; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Tom Drumm upon the occasion of his designation as recipient of a
Liberty Medal, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual by the  New
York State Senate; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Tom Drumm.
