 tive code of the city of New York is amended to read as follows:

 S. 4914  4

 drawn cabs] in the city of New York and set forth in  local  law  number
 ten of nineteen hundred sixty-four continue to be valid; such businesses
 are  vested  with  a  public  interest  and their regulation and control
 continue  to  be  necessary  and essential in order to cope with certain
 evils and hazards which existed in the absence  of  governmental  super-
 vision. The supervision formerly was reposed in the police commissioner,
 but  recent  experience  and  study indicate that jurisdiction over such
 businesses should be transferred to the  commissioner.  [It  is  further
 found  that  the present number of horse drawn cabs licensed in the city
 of New York is adequate to meet the public need and demand and should be
 preserved, unless the commissioner finds that  additional  licenses  are
 necessary and advisable.]

 therefor  from  the  commissioner  of motor vehicles of the state of New
 York.

 S. 4914  5
 
  b. It shall be unlawful for a  license,  after  being  issued  by  the

  §  17.  Subdivision  c of section 20-374 of the administrative code of
 the city of New York is REPEALED and subdivisions d and e are relettered

  § 18. Section 20-375 of the administrative code of  the  city  of  New
 York,  as  amended by local law number 2 of the city of New York for the
 year 1994, is amended to read as follows:
  § 20-375 License plate. Upon  the  payment  of  the  license  fee  the
 commissioner  shall  issue a license to the owner of the sightseeing bus
 [or horse drawn cab] together  with  a  license  plate  to  be  securely
 affixed  to a conspicuous and indispensable part of such sightseeing bus
 [or securely and conspicuously affixed to the rear axle  of  such  horse
 drawn  cab,]  on  which shall be clearly set forth the license number of
 such sightseeing bus [or horse drawn cab]. The license plate  issued  to
 the licensee may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be a plate of a
 permanent  nature with a replaceable date tag attached thereto, indicat-
 ing the expiration date of the plate during each license  year  and  the
 issuance  of such a plate with such date tag to a person possessing such
 a plate, shall be deemed issuance of a license plate. Such license plate
 and the replaceable date tag to be  issued  from  year  to  year  to  be
 attached  thereto, shall be of such material, form, design and dimension
 and set forth such distinguishing number or other  identification  marks
 as  the  commissioner  shall prescribe. The commissioner upon renewal of
 the license hereunder, may continue the use of the license plate for  as
 many  additional license years as he or she in his or her discretion may
 determine, in which event he or she  shall  issue  and  deliver  to  the
 licensee  a  replaceable date tag as evidence of renewal of the license,
 which shall be attached or affixed in such  manner  as  he  or  she  may
 prescribe  by  rule.  The failure to affix or display such date tag in a
 manner prescribed by the commissioner shall constitute  a  violation  of
 this section. In the event of the loss, mutilation or destruction of any
 license  plate  or  date  tag  issued hereunder, the owner may file such
 statement and proof of facts as the commissioner shall require,  with  a
 fee  of twenty-five dollars, at the department, and the department shall
 issue a duplicate or substitute license plate or date tag.

 inspection and the signature of the person making the  inspection  shall
 be recorded upon the inspection card in the spaces provided therefor.
  §  21.  Section  20-379  of the administrative code of the city of New
