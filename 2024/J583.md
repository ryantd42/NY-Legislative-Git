  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 19-25, 2023, as Surveyors' Week in  the  State
  of  New  York, in conjunction with the observance of
  National Surveyors Week
 
  WHEREAS, Land surveyors have been instrumental  in  determining  the
boundaries  of  property  throughout  New  York  State  and  the nation,
enabling the populace to fulfill the dream of property ownership; and
 
  WHEREAS, Some  of  our  most  distinguished  forefathers  were  land
surveyors, including Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and
John  Adams;  these  founders of our country contributed to the historic
mapping of the United States in its early years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the Colonial Period,  the  nature  of  surveying  has
evolved  to  include  hydrographic  surveys,  engineering  surveys  in
construction,  geodetic  surveys  which  determine  precise  global
positioning  for  aircraft  and  missile  navigation,  and  cartographic
surveys used for mapping and charting; and
 
  WHEREAS, Professional surveyors  in  the  State  of  New  York  must
complete  rigorous  educational  and experiential training, know applied
mathematics, provide technical and research skills and must pass both  a
national and a state-specific examination; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  more than 1,400 professional land surveyors in
New York State and more than 45,000  nationwide,  whose  profession  has
been,  and continues to be, essential in the development and advancement
of our State and Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  important  to  recognize  the  contributions  of
professional  land  surveyors  to the layout of the state and country as
well as their specialized knowledge and expertise; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim March 19-25, 2023, as
Surveyors' Week in the State of New York,  in  conjunction  of  National
Surveyors Week; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
