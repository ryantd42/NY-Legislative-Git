 AN ACT authorizing Maimonides Educational Center to receive  retroactive
  real property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Maimonides Educational Center an application  for  exemption  from  real
 property  taxes  pursuant  to section 420-a of the real property tax law
 with respect to the 2019-2020  and  2020-2021  assessment  rolls  for  a
 portion  of  the  2019-2020  school taxes,  all of the 2020-2021 school
 taxes, a portion of the 2020 general taxes and all of the  2021  general
 taxes for the parcel conveyed to such organization located at 2083 Sene-
 ca  Gate, hamlet of Merrick, town of Hempstead, county of Nassau, other-
 wise known as Nassau county parcel ID section 56 block 447  lot  13.  If
 accepted,  the  application shall be reviewed as if it had been received
 on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
