  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Subdivision  4-a  of  section  65.10 of the penal law, as
 amended by chapter 67 of the  laws  of  2008,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  4-a.  Mandatory  conditions  for  sex  offenders.  (a) When imposing a

 court shall require, as a mandatory condition  of  such  sentence,  that

 LY OCCURRING STOP WHERE PASSENGERS ARE DISCHARGED OR TAKEN  ON,  or  any
 other  facility  or institution primarily used for the care or treatment

 offender  may,  with  the  written authorization of his or her probation
 officer or the court and the superintendent or  chief  administrator  of
 such  facility, institution or grounds, enter such facility, institution
 or  upon  such  grounds  for  the  limited  purposes  authorized  by the
 probation officer or the court  and  superintendent  or  chief  officer.
 Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as restricting any lawful
 condition of supervision that may be imposed on such sentenced offender.
  (b)  When  imposing  a  sentence of probation or conditional discharge
 upon a person convicted of an offense for which registration  as  a  sex
 offender is required pursuant to subdivision two or three of section one
 hundred  sixty-eight-a  of  the  correction  law, and the victim of such
 offense was under the age of eighteen at the time  of  such  offense  or
 such  person  has been designated a level three sex offender pursuant to
 subdivision six of section one hundred sixty-eight-l of  the  correction
 law  or the internet was used to facilitate the commission of the crime,
 the court shall require, as mandatory conditions of such sentence,  that
 such  sentenced offender be prohibited from using the internet to access
 pornographic material, access a commercial  social  networking  website,
 communicate  with other individuals or groups for the purpose of promot-
 ing sexual relations with persons under the age of eighteen, and  commu-
 nicate  with  a  person  under the age of eighteen when such offender is
 over the age of eighteen, provided that the court may permit an offender
 to use the internet to communicate with a person under the age of  eigh-
 teen when such offender is the parent of a minor child and is not other-
 wise  prohibited  from  communicating  with  such child. Nothing in this
 subdivision shall be construed as restricting any other lawful condition
 of supervision that may be imposed on such sentenced offender.  As  used
 in this subdivision, a "commercial social networking website" shall mean
 any  business,  organization  or  other  entity operating a website that
 permits persons under eighteen years of age to be registered  users  for
 the  purpose  of  establishing  personal relationships with other users,
 where such persons under eighteen years of age may: (i) create web pages
 or profiles that provide information about  themselves  where  such  web
 pages  or  profiles  are available to the public or to other users; (ii)
 engage in direct or real time communication with other users, such as  a
 chat  room or instant messenger; and (iii) communicate with persons over
 eighteen years of age; provided, however, that,  for  purposes  of  this
 subdivision,  a commercial social networking website shall not include a
 website that permits users to engage in such other activities as are not
 enumerated herein.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
