 THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY PERSONS PROGRAM UNDER TITLE  ELEVEN  OF
 ARTICLE  FIVE OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW ANY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL COMMIT-

 INTO THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY PERSONS PROGRAM UNDER TITLE ELEVEN
 OF ARTICLE FIVE OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES LAW,  UNLESS  THE  SUPERINTENDENT
 DETERMINES  THAT  SUCH APPLICATION IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL
 WAS ENROLLED IN THE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM  AT  THE  TIME  OF  THEIR
 INCARCERATION  AND  IS  EXPECTED TO REMAIN SO AT THE TIME OF RELEASE, OR
 BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL IS INELIGIBLE FOR ENROLLMENT IN SUCH  PROGRAM  OR
 DOES  NOT  WISH  TO BE ENROLLED. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NO SUCH MEDICAL

 PROVIDED  DURING  SUCH  TIME  AS  THE  PERSON  IS INCARCERATED EXCEPT AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER SUBDIVISION ONE-A OF SECTION THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX OF

  §  3.  Paragraph  (b)  of subdivision 3 of section 366-a of the social
 services law, as amended by chapter 41 of the laws of 1992,  is  amended
 to read as follows:
  (b)  notify  the  applicant in writing of the decision, and where such
 applicant is found eligible, provide a tamper  resistant  identification
 card  containing  a  photo  image  of  the applicant for use in securing
 medical assistance under this title provided, however, that an identifi-
 cation card need not contain a photo image of a  person  other  than  an
 adult member of an eligible household or a single-person eligible house-
 hold.  The department is not required to provide, but shall seek practi-
 cal methods for providing, a card with such picture  to  a  person  when
 such  person  is homebound or is a resident of a residential health care
 facility, or an in-patient  psychiatric  facility,  or  is  expected  to
 remain  hospitalized  for  an  extended period.  WHERE THE APPLICANT IS
 INCARCERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND COMMUNITY  SUPERVISION
 OR  IN  A  LOCAL  CORRECTIONAL FACILITY AS DEFINED IN SECTION TWO OF THE
 CORRECTION LAW, THE APPROPRIATE SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICIAL OR THE  DEPART-
 MENT  OF  HEALTH  OR ITS AGENT SHALL PROVIDE SUCH IDENTIFICATION CARD TO
 THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR LOCAL CORREC-
 TIONAL FACILITY FOR KEEPING WITH THE INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL'S  RECORDS
 UNTIL  SUCH  INDIVIDUAL  IS  RELEASED.  The  commissioner shall have the
 authority to define categories of recipients who  are  not  required  to
 have  a  photo  identification  card  where  such card would be limited,
 unnecessary or impracticable.
  § 4. Section 71 of the correction law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 subdivision 10 read as follows:

 HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS IN THE CUSTODY OF EACH FACILITY WERE:
  (I) ENROLLED IN MEDICAL ASSISTANCE OR OTHER MEDICAL INSURANCE PROGRAMS
 AT THE TIME OF THEIR INCARCERATION;
  (II) ENROLLED INTO SUCH PROGRAMS DURING THEIR INCARCERATION, INCLUDING
 WHETHER  THEY WERE ENROLLED THROUGH SOCIAL SERVICES DISTRICTS OR THE NEW
 YORK STATE HEALTH BENEFITS EXCHANGE PORTAL;
  (III) RELEASED WITH PROOF OF ENROLLMENT IN SUCH PROGRAMS; AND
  (IV) RELEASED WITHOUT PROOF OF ENROLLMENT IN SUCH PROGRAMS.
  (B) THE FIRST REPORT UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION  SHALL  BE  COMPLETED  AND

 lations and take other actions reasonably  necessary  to  implement  the
 provisions of this act on its effective date.
