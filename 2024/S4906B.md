 PROVIDED TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHERE PRACTICABLE.
  2.  WHEN A LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IS UNABLE TO COMPLETE AN APPLI-
 CATION FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PRIOR TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S RELEASE FROM  ITS
 CUSTODY,  THE  FACILITY SHALL ASSIST THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE COMPLETION OF
 ANY REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR A PRESUMPTIVE  ELIGIBILITY  DETERMINATION

 cation  card  need  not  contain a photo image of a person other than an
 adult member of an eligible household or a single-person eligible house-
 hold. The department is not required to provide, but shall seek  practi-
 cal  methods  for  providing,  a card with such picture to a person when
 such person is homebound or is a resident of a residential  health  care
 facility,  or  an  in-patient  psychiatric  facility,  or is expected to
 remain hospitalized for an extended period.  WHERE  THE  APPLICANT  IS
 INCARCERATED  BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND COMMUNITY SUPERVISION
 OR IN A LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY AS DEFINED IN  SECTION  TWO  OF  THE

 MENT OF HEALTH OR ITS AGENT SHALL PROVIDE SUCH  IDENTIFICATION  CARD  TO

 have a photo identification card  where  such  card  would  be  limited,
 unnecessary or impracticable.
