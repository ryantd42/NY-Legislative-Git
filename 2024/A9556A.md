 VOUCHER UNDER SECTION 8 OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSING  ACT  OF  1937  (42
 U.S.C.  §  1437F),  AND  THE  MONTHLY  RENT IS WITHIN THE RENTAL PAYMENT
 LIMITS ALLOWABLE BY SUCH  HOUSING  SUBSIDY  OR  VOUCHER  PROVIDER  UNDER
 PROGRAM RULES OR REGULATIONS.

 RECIPIENTS.  FOR PURPOSES  OF  SUBDIVISIONS  TWO-A  AND  FIVE  OF  THIS
 SECTION,  IT  SHALL CONSTITUTE UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF LAWFUL
 SOURCE OF INCOME TO COMMIT ANY PRACTICE PROHIBITED BY SUCH  SUBDIVISIONS
 BASED  UPON  THE  AMOUNT  OF A PERSON'S INCOME WHERE SUCH PERSON USES OR
 WILL USE HOUSING ASSISTANCE OR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THAT IS PROVIDED  BY  A
 PUBLIC  OR NON-PROFIT ENTITY THAT ISSUES RENTAL PAYMENT, WHETHER PARTIAL
 OR FULL, MADE DIRECTLY TO THE  HOUSING  PROVIDER  AND  THE  INDIVIDUAL'S

 UAL'S MONTHLY GROSS INCOME.
