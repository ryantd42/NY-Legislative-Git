 CAPABLE OF DISPOSING OF SUCH LOW-LEVEL WASTE BUT IN THE FORM(S) REQUIRED
 BY REGULATIONS OR LICENSE CONDITIONS. SPECIALIZED FACILITIES FOR PARTIC-
 ULAR TYPES OF LOW-LEVEL WASTE MANAGEMENT, REDUCTION OR TREATMENT MAY NOT
 BE DEVELOPED IN ANY PARTY STATE UNLESS THEY ARE IN ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF SUCH STATE AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS AND REGU-
 LATIONS.
  (B) EQUAL ACCESS TO REGIONAL FACILITIES
  EACH  PARTY  STATE  SHALL  HAVE  EQUAL ACCESS AS OTHER PARTY STATES TO
 REGIONAL FACILITIES LOCATED WITHIN THE REGION  AND  ACCEPTING  LOW-LEVEL
 WASTE,  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  THE HOST STATE MAY CLOSE THE REGIONAL
 FACILITY LOCATED WITHIN ITS BORDERS WHEN NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND

 (30) WORKING DAYS, PROVIDE IN WRITING THE REASONS FOR THE CLOSING.
 (C) INITIAL HOST STATE
 PENNSYLVANIA AND PARTY STATES WHICH GENERATED 25 PERCENT OR MORE OF  THE
 VOLUME  OR CURIES OF LOW-LEVEL WASTE GENERATED BY PENNSYLVANIA, BASED ON
 A COMPARISON OF AVERAGES OVER THE THREE YEARS  1982  THROUGH  1984,  ARE
 DESIGNATED AS "INITIAL HOST STATES" AND ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND HOST
 LOW-LEVEL  WASTE  SITES  AS REGIONAL FACILITIES. THE PERCENTAGE OF WASTE
 FROM EACH STATE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY CUBIC FOOT VOLUME OR TOTAL  CURIE
 CONTENT, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
  (D) EXEMPTION FROM BEING INITIAL HOST SITE
 PARTY  STATES  WHICH  GENERATED  LESS  THAN  25 PERCENT OF THE VOLUME OR
 CURIES OF LOW-LEVEL WASTE GENERATED BY PENNSYLVANIA, BASED ON A  COMPAR-
 ISON  OF AVERAGES OVER THE YEARS 1982 THROUGH 1984, SHALL BE EXEMPT FROM
 S. 9120  7
 
 INITIAL HOST STATE RESPONSIBILITIES. THESE STATES SHALL CONTINUE  TO  BE

 SUCCESSIVE 3-YEAR PERIODS. ONCE A  STATE  GENERATES  AN  AVERAGE  OF  25
 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE VOLUME OR CURIES GENERATED BY PENNSYLVANIA OVER A
 SUCCESSIVE 3-YEAR PERIOD, IT SHALL BE DESIGNATED AS A "HOST STATE" FOR A
 30-YEAR PERIOD BY THE COMMISSION AND SHALL IMMEDIATELY INITIATE DEVELOP-
 MENT,  OF  A REGIONAL FACILITY TO BE OPERATIONAL WITHIN FIVE YEARS. SUCH
 HOST STATE SHALL BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT AT ITS REGIONAL FACILITY LOW-LEV-
 EL WASTE AT LEAST EQUAL TO THAT GENERATED IN THE STATE. WITH  COMMISSION

 PENNSYLVANIA AND OTHER HOST STATES ARE  OBLIGATED  TO  DEVELOP  REGIONAL
 FACILITIES  FOR  THE  DURATION  OF THIS COMPACT. ALL REGIONAL FACILITIES
 SHALL BE DESIGNED FOR AT LEAST A 30-YEAR USEFUL LIFE. AT THE END OF  THE
 FACILITY'S  LIFE,  NORMAL  CLOSURE  AND  MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES SHALL BE
 INITIATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE  REQUIREMENTS  OF  THE  HOST
 STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. EACH HOST STATE'S OBLIGATION FOR OPER-
 ATING REGIONAL FACILITIES SHALL REMAIN AS LONG AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO
 PRODUCE  OVER A 3-YEAR PERIOD 25 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE VOLUME OR CURIES
 OF LOW-LEVEL WASTE GENERATED BY PENNSYLVANIA.
 (F) DUTIES OF HOST STATE

 IN  THE  STATE  AT A TIME EARLIER THAN WAS PROJECTED IN THE STATE'S MOST
 RECENT ANNUAL REPORT TO THE COMMISSION.
  (G) REQUIRE THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL  CONTROL  PERIOD  OF  ANY  DISPOSAL
 FACILITY  BE AT LEAST AS LONG AS THE HAZARDOUS LIFE, AS DEFINED IN ARTI-

 LIABILITY ARISES FROM NEGLIGENCE, MALFEASANCE OR NEGLECT ON THE PART  OF
 A  HOST  STATE OR ANY PARTY STATE, THEN ANY OTHER HOST OR PARTY STATE(S)
 MAY MAKE ANY CLAIM ALLOWABLE UNDER LAW FOR THAT NEGLIGENCE,  MALFEASANCE
 OR NEGLECT. IF SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM A PARTICULAR WASTE SHIPMENT OR
 SHIPMENTS TO, OR QUANTITY OF WASTE OR CONDITION AT, THE REGIONAL FACILI-
 TY,  THEN ANY HOST OR PARTY STATE MAY MAKE ANY CLAIM ALLOWABLE UNDER LAW
