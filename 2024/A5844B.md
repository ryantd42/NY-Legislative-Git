 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the assessor of the town  of  Brookha-
  ven,  county  of  Suffolk to accept an application for a real property
  tax exemption from De Bethesda Eglise

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor  of  the  town of Brookhaven, county of Suffolk, is hereby
 authorized  to  accept  from  De  Bethesda  Eglise  an  application  for
 exemption from real property taxes pursuant to sections 420-a and 462 of
 the  real  property tax law with respect to the 2020 and 2021 assessment
 rolls for all of the 2020 and 2021 general taxes for the parcel owned by
 such organization located at 48 Edgewater Drive, in the hamlet of Mastic
 Beach, town of Brookhaven, county of Suffolk, otherwise known as Suffolk
 county tax map district 0209, section 013.00, block 06.00,  lot  004.00.
 If  accepted,  the  application  shall  be  reviewed  as  if it had been
 received on or before the  taxable  status  date  established  for  such
 assessment rolls.
  If  satisfied  that  such  organization would otherwise be entitled to
 such exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application  for
 exemption  by  the  appropriate  taxable status date, the assessor, upon
 approval by the Brookhaven town board, may make  appropriate  correction
 to  the  subject  rolls. If such exemption is granted and such organiza-
 tion, therefore, shall have paid any tax with  respect  to  the  subject
 rolls,  the applicable governing body or tax department may, in its sole
 discretion, provide for the refund of those taxes paid and cancel  those
 taxes, fines, penalties, liens or interest remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
