 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Cultural Affairs, Tourism,
  Parks and Recreation
 
 AN ACT to amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law,  in
  relation  to  creating the "Pennies for Parks" program providing funds
  for capital expenditures at  state  parks,  historic  sites  and  city
  parks;  to  amend the tax law, in relation to imposing a fee on single
  use plastic carryout bags; and to amend  the  state  finance  law,  in
  relation to establishing the pennies for parks fund
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds  and
 declares  that  state  parks,  historic sites and city parks enhance the
 character and quality of life and enhance the economic vitality of local
 communities and provide healthy and affordable recreational  and  educa-
 tional  opportunities  to  New  York  state  residents  and visitors. If
 allowed to fall into disrepair, state parks, historic sites as  well  as
 city  parks  may  become inaccessible and uninviting to the public. Once
 closed or sold, state parks and historic sites  are  difficult,  if  not
 impossible,  to  recover  or  rehabilitate.  Accordingly,  state  parks,
 historic sites and city parks should be provided necessary capital fund-
 ing in a manner which is cognizant  of  their  aforementioned  intrinsic
 values.
  The  legislature  also  finds and declares that the single use plastic
 carryout bags distributed by New York retailers have a  negative  impact
 on  the environment, littering our communities, parks and beaches; fill-
 ing our landfills; harming wildlife; and using  millions  of  trees  and
 gallons  of  oil  to produce. An additional economic incentive should be
 put in place to encourage the use of reusable bags and reduce the stream
 of single use plastic carryout bags.
  It is hereby declared to be the public policy and in the public inter-
 est of this state to establish a  comprehensive  program  to  provide  a
 dedicated  funding  stream  for our state parks, historic sites and city
 parks. Such a dedicated funding stream should be devoted as supplemental

 to the existing budget of the office of parks, recreation  and  historic
 preservation.  The  funding  stream should be created by imposing a five
 cent fee on each single use plastic carryout bag distributed by  retail-
 ers  in  New  York, to be collected and used to fund capital projects in
 state parks, historic sites and city parks. In order to meet the  afore-
 mentioned  goals  and  uphold  the  cultural fabric and integrity of the
 system of state parks, and historic sites and city parks,  the  "Pennies
 for  Parks"  program,  a  fee  on  single  use plastic carryout bags and
 pennies for parks fund are established and codified in sections 13.32 of
 the parks, recreation and historic preservation law, 1105-D of  the  tax
 law and 92-kk of the state finance law.
  § 2. The parks, recreation and historic preservation law is amended by
