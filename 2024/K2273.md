  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 1, 2024, as Uzbekistan Independence Day in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored traditions, it is the intent of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim September 1, 2024, as
Uzbekistan Independence Day in the State of  New  York,  in  conjunction
with the observance of Uzbekistan Independence Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Republic of Uzbekistan is a trusted ally of our State
and Nation, serving as a  partner  in  security,  economic  development,
humanitarian aid, and regional stability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Uzbekistan  Independence  dates  to  1991,  when  both the
President of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, Islam Karimov, and the
nation's legislative body, the Supreme Soviet,  declared  Uzbekistan  as
independent from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  United States is home to over 60,000 Uzbek Americans,
about half of whom live in New York  State  and  the  surrounding  area,
where they contribute to every facet of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York City is home to a diverse Uzbek community composed
of  Bukharan  Jews  fleeing  persecution  starting  in the 1970s, Uzbeks
seeking refuge from political turmoil in the 1980s, and "New Uzbeks" who
arrived in recent decades in pursuit of the American Dream; and
 
  WHEREAS, Uzbeks around the world are renowned for their work  ethic,
hospitality,  kindness, cuisine, dance, music, and dedication to family;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Uzbek New Yorkers have established vibrant institutions and
businesses that include the Silk Road Foundation, Tashkent  Supermarket,
Mahalla USA Public Association, the Uzbek American Community Center, and
the Turkestanian American Association; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York's Uzbek community reached multiple milestones in
2023, a year in which the Mayor of New York hosted the first ever Gracie
Mansion celebration of Navruz, the most popular holiday  in  Uzbekistan,
and the first ever raising of the Uzbek flag in Bowling Green; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim September 1, 2024, as
Uzbekistan Independence Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  the Consul General of Uzbekistan; and various Uzbek organizations
in New York State.
