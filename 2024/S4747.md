 Introduced  by Sen. HOYLMAN-SIGAL -- read twice and ordered printed, and

 AN ACT to amend the debtor and creditor law, in relation to the recover-
  ability of sovereign debt
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 it  is  a  longstanding policy of the United States and the state of New
 York, as the world's  leading  financial  center,  to  support  orderly,
 collaborative  and  effective  international  debt relief for developing
 countries with unsustainable levels of debt. Debt distress, debt crises,
 and disorderly default are associated with unacceptable human suffering,
 economic decline, and financial market and payment  systems  disruption.
 Moreover,  debt  restructuring  is  ineffective  and  does  not  lead to
 sustainable outcomes when it is not perceived as equitable or legitimate
 by stakeholders in borrowing and lending countries. Additionally, public
 creditors are unlikely to participate in debt restructuring  initiatives
 unless  there is fair burden sharing among all public and private credi-
 tors, which is essential to the legitimacy  and  effectiveness  of  debt
 relief  initiatives.  The  United  Kingdom  has successfully implemented
 legislation to promote such burden-sharing in support  of  international
 debt relief initiatives since 2010. Therefore, the legislature finds and
 declares that it shall be the policy of the state of New York to support
 international debt relief initiatives for developing countries in, or at
 high risk of, debt distress, to ensure that the cost of such debt relief
 is  allocated in a fair and equitable manner, and that such costs do not
 fall disproportionately on the residents and taxpayers of the  state  of
 New York, and for other purposes.
  §  2.  The  debtor and creditor law is amended by adding a new article
 10-B to read as follows:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
