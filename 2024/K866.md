  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 21, 2024, as Mother  Language  Day  in  the
  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
  observance of International Mother Language Day
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize  that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York
State are reflective of the concerned and  dedicated  efforts  of  those
organizations  and  individuals  that  are devoted to the welfare of the
community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is also the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness  of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International  Mother  Language  Day is an observance held
annually on February 21st worldwide to promote awareness  of  linguistic
and cultural diversity and multilingualism; this year's theme is "Spirit
of Youth"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  date  represents  the day in 1952, when students from
different institutions such as Dhaka  University,  Jagannath  University
and  Dhaka  Medical  College  demonstrating  for  recognition  of  their
language, Bangla, were shot and killed by police in Dhaka,  the  capital
of present-day Bangladesh; and
 
  WHEREAS, First announced on November 17, 1999, by the United Nations
Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO),
International  Mother  Language  Day  is  based  on  the  premise  that
linguistic  and  cultural  diversity  represent  universal  values  that
strengthen the union and cohesion of societies;  it  has  been  observed
every year since its inaugural celebration in February of 2000; and
 
  WHEREAS,  UNESCO  sets  the  theme  for  each  International  Mother
Language Day, and holds related events at its headquarters in  Paris  on
or around February 21 each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Presented  annually  on International Mother Language Day,
the Linguapax Prize recognizes and awards outstanding  contributions  in
the  preservation  of  linguistic  diversity,  revitalization  and
reactivation  of  linguistic  communities,  and  the  promotion  of
multilingualism; and
 
  WHEREAS, On May 16, 2009, the United Nations General Assembly in its
resolution,  called  upon  Member States to promote the preservation and
protection of all languages used by people of the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, by the same resolution, the  General  Assembly
proclaimed 2008 as the International Year of Languages, to promote unity
in  diversity  and  international understanding, through multilingualism
and multiculturalism; and
 
  WHEREAS, Linguistic diversity is increasingly threatened as more and
more languages disappear; globally, 40 percent of  the  population  does
not  have access to an education in a language they speak or understand;
and
 
  WHEREAS, At least 43 percent of the estimated 6,000 languages spoken
in the world are endangered; only a few hundred languages have genuinely
been  given a place in education systems and the public domain, and less
than a hundred are used in the digital world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nevertheless, progress is being made in mother tongue-based
multilingual education with growing  understanding  of  its  importance,
particularly  in early schooling, and more commitment to its development
in public life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Languages are the most powerful instruments  of  preserving
and  developing  our  tangible  and  intangible  heritage;  all moves to
promote the dissemination of mother tongues will serve  not  only  to  a
encourage  linguistic  diversity and multilingual education, but also to
develop fuller awareness of linguistic  cultural  traditions  throughout
the  world  to  inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and
dialogue; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim February 21, 2024, as
Mother Language Day in the State of New York, in  conjunction  with  the
observance of International Mother Language Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
