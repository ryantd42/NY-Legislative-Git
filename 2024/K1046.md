BY: M. of A. Eachus
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 30, 2024, as Doctors' Day in the State of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to recognize certain professionals  who
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  30,  2024, as
Doctors' Day  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Doctors' Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  annual  observance  of  Doctors'  Day  provides  an
opportunity for the people of the Empire State to  recognize  the  vital
contributions  of physicians who practice in communities large and small
throughout New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, The idea for National Doctors' Day came from  Eudora  Brown
Almond,  wife  of  Dr.  Charles  B.  Almond, and the date chosen was the
anniversary of the first use of general anesthesia in surgery which  was
performed on March 30, 1842, in Jefferson, Georgia, by Dr. Crawford Long
who used ether to anesthetize a patient; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  March 28, 1933, the first Doctors' Day was observed in
Winder, Georgia, with cards mailed to the physicians  and  their  wives,
flowers  were  placed on graves of deceased doctors, including Dr. Long,
and a formal dinner was held at the home of  Dr.  and  Mrs.  William  T.
Randolph; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  the  Barrow  County  Alliance  adopted Eudora Brown
Almond's resolution  to  pay  tribute  to  the  doctors,  the  plan  was
presented  to  the Georgia State Medical Alliance in 1933, by Mrs. E. R.
Harris of Winder, president of the Barrow County Alliance; and
 
  WHEREAS, On May 10, 1934, the resolution was adopted at  the  annual
state  meeting  in  Augusta,  Georgia, and was introduced to the Women's
Alliance of the Southern Medical Association at its 29th annual  meeting
held in St. Louis, Missouri; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During the 101st United States Congress, the United States
Senate and House of Representatives passed  S.J.  RES.  No.  366,  which
former  President  Bush  signed  on  October  30, 1990, thereby creating
Public Law 101-473, designating Doctors' Day as a national holiday to be
celebrated on March 30th; and
 
  WHEREAS, Years later,  Dr.  Marion  Mass  along  with  Dr.  Kimberly
Jackson and Dr. Christina Lang applied to officially have physicians day
changed to physicians week, which was accepted in March of 2017; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2017,  Physicians  Working  Together (PWT) sponsored a
series of articles in observance of National Physicians week which  were
hosted on KevinMD; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  following  year,  PWT along with Openxmed sponsored a
free online conference focusing on physician well-being and support, and
in 2019, these two vital organizations funded a scholarship program  for
medical students and residents; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, we continue to celebrate medical advances like using
ether anesthesia and thank all doctors everywhere who have spent so much
time and energy mastering their respective field of expertise; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  appropriate  for the citizens of New York State to
recognize that the quality of life in the communities across this  great
State  of  New  York  is  enriched  by  the  diligence and compassionate
commitment of those individuals whose singular purpose is the  care  and
welfare of others; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  March  30,  2024,  as
Doctors' Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
