 AN ACT to authorize Lee Weinstein  to  receive  certain  service  credit
  under section 384-d of the retirement and social security law
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Lee Weinstein, currently employed as a police officer with the  town  of
 Chester police department, who was employed as a police officer with the
 village of Greenwood Lake between August 15, 2001 and September 6, 2005,
 and  who,  through no fault of his own, failed to file a timely applica-
 tion to participate in the special twenty year retirement plan contained
 in section 384-d of the retirement and social security law resulting  in
 the  crediting  of his service with the village of Greenwood Lake in the
 general retirement plan contained in section 375-c of such law and  with
 the  town of Chester in the general retirement plan contained in section
 375-i of such law, shall be given full credit in the special twenty year
 retirement plan for such  additional  cost  of  such  service  upon  the
 election  of the village of Greenwood Lake to assume the additional cost
 of such service to such village and the town of Chester  to  assume  the
 additional  cost of such service to such town.  The village of Greenwood
 Lake may so elect by filing with the state comptroller, within one  year
 from  the effective date of this act, a resolution of its local legisla-
 tive body together with certification that  such  officer  did  not  bar
 himself  from  participation  in such retirement plan as a result of his
 own negligence.  The town of Chester may so elect  by  filing  with  the
 state  comptroller, within one year from the effective date of this act,
 a resolution of its local legislative body together  with  certification
 that such officer did not bar himself from participation in such retire-
 ment  plan  as a result of his own negligence.  Thereafter, such officer
 may elect to be covered by  the provisions  of  section  384-d  of  the
 retirement  and  social security  law,  and  shall  be  entitled to the
 full rights and benefits associated with coverage under such section, by

 filing a request to that effect with the state comptroller within  the
 effective date  of  such resolution.
  §  2. All employer past service costs associated with implementing the
 provisions of this act shall be borne by the village of  Greenwood  Lake
 and the town of Chester and may be amortized over a ten-year period.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would allow the Town of Chester to reopen the provisions of
 section 384-d of the Retirement and Social Security Law for police offi-
 cer Lee Weinstein. This bill  would  also  grant  service  credit  under
 section  384-d  to  Lee  Weinstein for the period during which they were
 employed as a police officer by the Village of Greenwood Lake.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of  approximately  $15,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of the Town of Chester for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the billing rates
 and salary of Lee Weinstein change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $435,000.  The  Town  of
 Chester  and the Village of Greenwood Lake will each be required to make
 one-time payments of $411,000 and $24,000, respectively.  This  estimate
 assumes  that  payments will be made on February 1, 2025. If the Town of
 Chester and the Village of Greenwood Lake elect to amortize these  costs
 over  a  10-year period, the cost for each year including interest would
 be $52,400 and $3,110, respectively.
