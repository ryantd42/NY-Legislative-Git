  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 1-7, 2024, as Testicular Cancer Awareness Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  weeks  that  are  set  aside  to increase awareness of serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  1-7,  2024,  as
Testicular  Cancer  Awareness  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in
conjunction with the observance of National Testicular Cancer  Awareness
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer in men
ages 15-35 years, but can affect men of all ages; and
 
  WHEREAS, The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) Program estimates  that  in  2022,  approximately
8,850  men  in  the United States were diagnosed with testicular cancer;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Testicular  Cancer  Awareness  Week  is  to  heighten  the
awareness  of this disease and other preventable health problems as well
as to encourage early detection and treatment of disease among  men  and
boys; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Educating  both the public and health care providers about
the importance of early detection of testicular cancer  will  result  in
reducing rates of mortality for this disease; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Appropriate  use  of  tests  in  conjunction with clinical
examination and self-testing for problems can result in the detection of
many of these problems in their early stages and increases the  survival
rates to nearly 100 percent; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  men  are  reluctant  to visit their health center or
physician for regular screening examinations of  male  related  problems
for  a  variety of reasons including fear, lack of information, and cost
factors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Men who are educated  about  the  value  that  preventative
health  can  play  in  prolonging  their  lifespan  and their roles as a
productive family member will be more likely to  participate  in  health
screenings; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  1-7,  2024,  as
Testicular  Cancer  Awareness  Week  in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
