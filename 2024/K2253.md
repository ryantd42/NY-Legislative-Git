  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 1, 2024, as Vegan Day in the State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness  of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 1, 2024, as Vegan
Day  in  the  State  of  New York, in conjunction with the observance of
World Vegan Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Vegan Day is an annual  event  celebrated  by  vegans
around the world every November 1st; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  day  was  established  in 1994 by Louise Wallis, then
President and Chair of The Vegan Society, the oldest  vegan  society  in
the world which was founded in the United Kingdom in 1944; and
 
  WHEREAS, The purpose of World Vegan Day is to recognize and champion
the vegan lifestyle, which has health, animal welfare, and environmental
benefits; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  Vegan  Day is also an opportunity to bring together
the vegan community in supporting one another; and
 
  WHEREAS, Vegans eat a plant-based diet and avoid  all  animal  foods
including meat, fish, shellfish and insects; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Two  in three Americans have stopped or reduced their meat
consumption, according to Cambridge University researchers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Increasingly,  Americans,  including  New  Yorkers  are
recognizing  the  appeal  of eating vegan alternatives; between 2020 and
2021, sales of vegan foods which are direct replacements  for  milk  and
meat have grown; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Vegan Day is celebrated around the world as a time to
recognize  how  far  the  vegan  movement  has  come,  reflect  on their
successes, and to  highlight  how  accessible  and  beneficial  a  vegan
lifestyle is; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November 1, 2024, as Vegan
Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York and The Vegan Society.
