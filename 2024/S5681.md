  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "unfunded mandate review act".
  § 2. Section 51 of the legislative law, as added by chapter 985 of the
 laws of 1983, is amended to read as follows:
  § 51. Fiscal  impact  notes on bills affecting political subdivisions.
 1. For the purpose of this section,  the  term  "political  subdivision"
 means  THE  STATE,  OR ANY DIVISION, AGENCY OR BODY OF THE STATE; OR any
 county, city, town, village, special district or school district.
  2. [The legislature shall by concurrent resolution of the  senate  and
 assembly prescribe rules requiring fiscal notes to accompany, on a sepa-
 rate form, bills and amendments to bills, except as otherwise prescribed
 by  such  rules,  which  would  substantially  affect  the  revenues  or
 expenses, or both, of any political subdivision] WHENEVER A COMMITTEE OF
 EITHER HOUSE REPORTS A BILL THAT INCLUDES AN UNFUNDED MANDATE  AFFECTING
 A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION, THE BILL SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY:
  (A)  AN  IDENTIFICATION  AND  DESCRIPTION  OF  ANY MANDATE IN THE BILL
 ANTICIPATED TO HAVE A DIRECT OR INDIRECT COST,  A  QUALITATIVE,  AND  IF
 PRACTICABLE,  A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE
 MANDATE; AND
  (B) A FISCAL IMPACT NOTE PROVIDED  BY  THE  COMPTROLLER.  FISCAL  NOTE
 ESTIMATES SHALL INCLUDE TOTAL COST OF COMPLYING WITH THE BILL AND FUTURE
 PROJECTED  COSTS.  IF THE COMPTROLLER DETERMINES THAT AN ESTIMATE IS NOT
 FEASIBLE TO MAKE, THE COMPTROLLER SHALL REPORT REASONS  FOR  DETERMINING
 AN ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE.

  3. Fiscal notes shall not, however, be required for bills: (a) subject
 to  the  provisions of section fifty of this chapter, or (b) accompanied
 by special home rule requests submitted by  political  subdivisions,  or
 (c)  which provide discretionary authority to political subdivisions, or
 (d) submitted pursuant to section twenty-four of the state finance law.
  4. If the estimate or estimates contained in a fiscal note are inaccu-
 rate,  such  inaccuracies  shall  not  affect, impair or invalidate such
 bill.
  5. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISIONS THREE AND FOUR OF THIS  SECTION,
 THE  LEGISLATURE SHALL NOT CONSIDER A BILL INCLUDING AN UNFUNDED MANDATE

 as follows:
  § 50-A. REVIEW OF LEGISLATION AFFECTING POLITICAL  SUBDIVISIONS.  1.
 FISCAL  IMPACT NOTES ON BILLS AFFECTING POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS. UPON THE

 THAT INCLUDES AN UNFUNDED MANDATE  AFFECTING  A  POLITICAL  SUBDIVISION.
 FISCAL  NOTE  ESTIMATES  SHALL  INCLUDE TOTAL COST OF COMPLYING WITH THE

  2. CONTINUING MANDATE STUDY. THE COMPTROLLER SHALL CONDUCT A STUDY  OF
 LEGISLATIVE  PROPOSALS  CONTAINING  AN UNFUNDED MANDATE UPON A POLITICAL
 SUBDIVISION. IN CONDUCTING THIS CONTINUING STUDY, THE COMPTROLLER  SHALL
 SOLICIT  AND  CONSIDER  INFORMATION  OR COMMENTS FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS,
 ADVISORY PANELS AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO THE EXTENT ACCURATE  ESTIMATES  ARE
 REASONABLY  FEASIBLE,  THE  ESTIMATES  SHALL INCLUDE FUTURE COSTS TO THE
 EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OR EXTEND BEYOND FIVE YEARS.
  3. COST OF REGULATIONS. THE COMPTROLLER  SHALL  PREPARE  A  COMPARISON
 BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING A REGULATION PROVIDED BY THE

 ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION REVIEW COMMISSION. IT SHALL BE THE DUTY OF THE

 REGULATION, AND TO PROVIDE SUCH ESTIMATE TO THE COMPTROLLER FOR  HIS  OR
 HER  REVIEW PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION FIFTY-A OF THE EXECU-
 TIVE LAW.
  2. IT SHALL BE  THE  DUTY  OF  THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  REGULATION  REVIEW
 COMMISSION  TO  EXAMINE ALL UNFUNDED MANDATES IMPOSED UPON ANY POLITICAL
 SUBDIVISION AND REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS  BIENNIALLY  TO  THE  LEGISLATURE
 REGARDING:
  (A)  WAYS  TO  ALLOW  FLEXIBILITY  IN COMPLYING WITH SPECIFIC MANDATES
 WHICH MAY BE UNNECESSARILY RIGID OR COMPLEX;
  (B) RECONCILING ANY TWO OR MORE MANDATES WHICH IMPOSE CONTRADICTORY OR
 INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS;
