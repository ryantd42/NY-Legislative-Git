 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 238-a of the real

 to read as follows:
  (a) Except in instances where statutes or regulations  provide  for  a
 payment,  fee  or charge, no landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor may
 demand any payment, fee, or charge for the processing, review or accept-
 ance of an application, or demand  any  other  payment,  fee  or  charge
 before  or at the beginning of the tenancy, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 BROKERS' FEES, except background checks and credit checks as provided by

  4. a. For  buyer-seller  transactions,  the  following  shall  be  the
 disclosure form:
  NEW YORK STATE DISCLOSURE FORM
  FOR
  BUYER AND SELLER
  THIS IS NOT A CONTRACT
  New  York  state  law requires real estate licensees who are acting as
 agents of buyers or sellers of property to advise the  potential  buyers
 or  sellers  with whom they work of the nature of their agency relation-
 ship and the rights and obligations it  creates.  This  disclosure  will
 help  you to make informed choices about your relationship with the real
 estate broker and its sales agents.
  Throughout the transaction you may receive more  than  one  disclosure
 form.  The  law  may  require each agent assisting in the transaction to
 present you with this disclosure form. A real estate agent is  a  person
 qualified to advise about real estate.
  If you need legal, tax or other advice, consult with a professional in
 that field.
  DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS
  SELLER'S AGENT
  A  seller's  agent is an agent who is engaged by a seller to represent
 the seller's interests. The seller's agent does this by securing a buyer
 for the seller's home at a price and on terms acceptable to the  seller.
 A seller's agent has, without limitation, the following fiduciary duties
 to the seller: reasonable care, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full
 disclosure,  obedience  and  duty  to account. A seller's agent does not
 represent the interests of the buyer.  The  obligations  of  a  seller's
 agent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in an agree-
 ment  between  the  agent  and the seller. In dealings with the buyer, a
 seller's agent should (a) exercise reasonable skill and care in perform-
 ance of the agent's duties; (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good faith;
 and (c) disclose all facts known to the agent materially  affecting  the
 value or desirability of property, except as otherwise provided by law.
  BUYER'S AGENT
  A buyer's agent is an agent who is engaged by a buyer to represent the
 buyer's  interests.  The  buyer's  agent  does  this  by negotiating the
 purchase of a home at a price and on terms acceptable to  the  buyer.  A
 buyer's agent has, without limitation, the following fiduciary duties to
 the  buyer:  reasonable  care,  undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full
 disclosure, obedience and duty to account.  A  buyer's  agent  does  not
 represent  the  interests  of  the  seller. The obligations of a buyer's
 agent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in [an]  THE
 REPRESENTATION  agreement  between the agent and the buyer.  A REPRESEN-
 TATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ENTERED INTO PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION  OF  THE
 OFFER  TO PURCHASE TO THE SELLER OR SELLER'S AGENT. In dealings with the
 seller, a buyer's agent should (a) exercise reasonable skill and care in
 performance of the agent's duties; (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good
 faith; and (c) disclose all facts known to the agent materially  affect-
 ing  the  buyer's  ability  and/or  willingness to perform a contract to
 acquire seller's property that are not  inconsistent  with  the  agent's
 fiduciary duties to the buyer.
  BROKER'S AGENTS
  A  broker's agent is an agent that cooperates or is engaged by a list-
 ing agent or a buyer's agent (but does not work for the same firm as the
 listing agent or buyer's agent) to assist the listing agent  or  buyer's
 agent in locating a property to sell or buy, respectively, for the list-
 S. 9686  7
 
 ing  agent's  seller or the buyer agent's buyer. The broker's agent does
 not have a direct relationship with the buyer or seller and the buyer or
 seller can  not  provide  instructions  or  direction  directly  to  the
 broker's agent. The buyer and the seller therefore do not have vicarious
 liability  for  the  acts  of  the  broker's agent. The listing agent or
 buyer's agent do provide direction and instruction to the broker's agent
 and therefore the listing agent or buyer's agent will have liability for
 the acts of the broker's agent.
  [DUAL AGENT
  A real estate broker may represent both the buyer and  the  seller  if
 both  the  buyer  and  seller give their informed consent in writing. In
 such a dual agency situation, the agent will not be able to provide  the
 full  range of fiduciary duties to the buyer and seller. The obligations
 of an agent are also subject to any specific provisions set forth in  an
 agreement  between  the agent, and the buyer and seller. An agent acting
 as a dual agent must explain carefully to both the buyer and seller that
 the agent is acting for the other party as well. The agent  should  also
 explain  the  possible effects of dual representation, including that by
 consenting to the dual agency relationship  the  buyer  and  seller  are
 giving  up  their  right  to undivided loyalty. A buyer or seller should
 carefully consider the possible consequences of a dual agency  relation-
 ship  before  agreeing  to  such  representation.  A seller or buyer may
 provide advance informed consent to dual agency by indicating  the  same
 on this form.]
  DUAL AGENT
  WITH
  DESIGNATED SALES AGENTS
  If the buyer and the seller provide their informed consent in writing,
 the principals and the real estate broker who represents both parties as
 a  dual  agent  may  designate  a sales agent to represent the buyer and
 another sales agent to represent the seller to  negotiate  the  purchase
 and  sale  of  real estate. A sales agent works under the supervision of
 the real estate broker. With the informed consent of the buyer  and  the
 seller  in  writing, the designated sales agent for the buyer will func-
 tion as the buyer's agent representing the interests of  and  advocating
 on  behalf  of  the  buyer and the designated sales agent for the seller
 will function as the seller's agent representing the  interests  of  and
 advocating on behalf of the seller in the negotiations between the buyer
 and  seller.  A  designated sales agent cannot provide the full range of
 fiduciary duties to the buyer or seller. The designated sales agent must
 explain that like the dual agent under whose supervision they  function,
 they cannot provide undivided loyalty. A buyer or seller should careful-
 ly consider the possible consequences of a dual agency relationship with
 designated sales agents before agreeing to such representation. A seller
 or buyer may provide advance informed consent to dual agency with desig-
 nated sales agents by indicating the same on this form.
 
  This  form  was  provided to me by ____________________ (print name of

  NEW YORK STATE DISCLOSURE FORM
  FOR
  LANDLORD AND TENANT
 
  THIS IS NOT A CONTRACT
  New  York  state  law requires real estate licensees who are acting as
 agents of landlords and tenants of real property to advise the potential
 landlords and tenants with whom they work of the nature of their  agency
 relationship  and the rights and obligations it creates. This disclosure
 will help you to make informed choices about your relationship with  the
 real estate broker and its sales agents.
  Throughout  the  transaction  you may receive more than one disclosure
 form. The law may require each agent assisting  in  the  transaction  to
 present  you  with this disclosure form. A real estate agent is a person
 qualified to advise about real estate.
 If you need legal, tax or other advice, consult with a  professional  in
 that field.
 
  DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS
  LANDLORD'S AGENT
 
  A  landlord's agent is an agent who is engaged by a landlord to repre-
 sent the landlord's interest. The landlord's agent does this by securing
 a tenant for the landlord's apartment or house at a rent  and  on  terms
 acceptable  to the landlord. A landlord's agent has, without limitation,
 the following fiduciary duties to the landlord: reasonable  care,  undi-
 vided  loyalty,  confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and duty to
 account. A landlord's agent does not  represent  the  interests  of  the
 tenant.  The  obligations  of a landlord's agent are also subject to any
 specific provisions set forth in an agreement between the agent and  the
 landlord.  In  dealings  with  the tenant, a landlord's agent should (a)
 exercise reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent's duties;
 (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good faith; and (c) disclose all  facts
 S. 9686  9
 
 known  to  the  agent  materially affecting the value or desirability of
 property, except as otherwise provided by law.

  TENANT'S AGENT
 
  A  tenant's  agent is an agent who is engaged by a tenant to represent
 the tenant's interest. The tenant's agent does this by  negotiating  the
 rental or lease of an apartment or house at a rent and on terms accepta-
 ble to the tenant. A tenant's agent has, without limitation, the follow-
 ing  fiduciary duties to the tenant: reasonable care, undivided loyalty,
 confidentiality, full disclosure,  obedience  and  duty  to  account.  A
 tenant's  agent  does  not  represent  the interest of the landlord. The
 obligations of a  tenant's  agent  are  also  subject  to  any  specific
 provisions  set  forth  in [an] THE REPRESENTATION agreement between the
 agent and the tenant.  A REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT MUST BE  ENTERED  INTO
 PRIOR  TO  OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TENANT'S AGENT SHOWS ANY PROPERTY TO
 THE TENANT FOR THE FIRST TIME. In dealings with the landlord, a tenant's
 agent should (a) exercise reasonable skill and care  in  performance  of
 the agent's duties; (b) deal honestly, fairly and in good faith; and (c)
 disclose  all facts known to the  tenant's ability and/or willingness to
 perform a contract to rent or lease landlord's  property  that  are  not
 inconsistent with the agent's fiduciary duties to the buyer.
 
  BROKER'S AGENTS
 
  A  broker's agent is an agent that cooperates or is engaged by a list-
 ing agent or a tenant's agent (but does not work for the  same  firm  as
 the  listing  agent  or  tenant's  agent) to assist the listing agent or
 tenant's agent in locating a property to rent or lease for  the  listing
 agent's  landlord  or the tenant agent's tenant. The broker's agent does
 not have a direct relationship with  the  tenant  or  landlord  and  the
 tenant or landlord can not provide instructions or direction directly to
 the  broker's  agent.  The tenant and the landlord therefore do not have
 vicarious liability for the acts of  the  broker's  agent.  The  listing
 agent  or  tenant's  agent  do  provide direction and instruction to the
 broker's agent and therefore the listing agent or  tenant's  agent  will
 have liability for the acts of the broker's agent.

  A real estate broker may represent both the tenant and the landlord if
 both  the tenant and landlord give their informed consent in writing. In
 such a dual agency situation, the agent will not be able to provide  the
 full range of fiduciary duties to the landlord and the tenant. The obli-
 gations  of  an  agent  are  also subject to any specific provisions set
 forth in an agreement between the agent, and the tenant and landlord. An
 agent acting as a dual agent must explain carefully to both the landlord
 and tenant that the agent is acting for the other  party  as  well.  The
 agent  should  also explain the possible effects of dual representation,
 including that by consenting to the dual agency relationship  the  land-
 lord  and tenant are giving up their right to undivided loyalty. A land-
 lord and tenant should carefully consider the possible consequences of a
 dual agency relationship before agreeing  to  such  representation.  A
 landlord  or  tenant may provide advance informed consent to dual agency
 by indicating the same on this form.]

  DUAL AGENT
  WITH
  DESIGNATED SALES AGENTS
 
  If the tenant and the landlord provide their informed consent in writ-
 ing,  the  principals  and  the  real  estate broker who represents both
 parties as a dual agent may designate a sales  agent  to  represent  the
 tenant  and another sales agent to represent the landlord. A sales agent
 works under the supervision of the real estate broker. With the informed
 consent in writing of the tenant and the landlord, the designated  sales
 agent  for  the  tenant will function as the tenant's agent representing
 the interests of and advocating on behalf of the tenant and  the  desig-
 nated sales agent for the landlord will function as the landlord's agent
 representing  the  interests of and advocating on behalf of the landlord
 in the negotiations between the tenant and the  landlord.  A  designated
 sales  agent  cannot  provide  the full range of fiduciary duties to the
 landlord or tenant. The designated sales agent must  explain  that  like
 the  dual  agent  under  whose  supervision  they  function, they cannot
 provide undivided loyalty. A landlord or tenant should carefully consid-
 er the possible consequences of a dual agency relationship  with  desig-
 nated  sales  agents before agreeing to such representation.  A landlord
 or tenant may provide advance  informed  consent  to  dual  agency  with
 designated sales agents by indicating the same on this form.
