 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to providing a credit against
  unemployment fund contributions for employers who  employ  persons  in

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 5 of section 570 of the labor law,  as  amended
 by chapter 595 of the laws of 1985, is amended to read as follows:
  5.  Refunds and credits. (A) If an employer shall make application for
 a refund of any contribution, interest, or penalty paid by him or for  a
 credit  thereof  and the commissioner shall determine that such contrib-
 ution, interest or penalty,  or  any  portion  thereof  was  erroneously
 collected,  the  commissioner shall refund said amount or allow a credit
 therefor. If said refund was created as a result of  departmental  error
 then  the  commissioner  shall pay said refund with interest paid at the
 rate of three-fourths of one per centum of the amount of  such  contrib-
 ution, interest and penalty for each month between the time of the erro-
 neous  collection  and  thirty  days  previous to the date of the refund
 check, as specified in this subdivision, unless the employer shall  have
 already  deducted said amount by way of credit against moneys payable by
 him into the fund. No refund or credit shall be allowed unless an appli-
 cation therefor shall be made on or before whichever  of  the  following
 dates shall be the later: [(a)] (I) one year from the date on which such
 payment  was  made;  or  [(b)] (II) three years from the last day of the
 first month following the end of that calendar quarter during which  the
 remuneration  was  paid which formed the basis for contributions, inter-
 est, or penalty claimed to have been erroneously collected. For  a  like
 cause  and  within  the  same period a refund may be so made or a credit
 allowed on the initiative of the commissioner. Any credit or  refund  of
 interest and penalties erroneously collected, any interest on such cred-

 erroneously collected, allowed by the commissioner under  the  foregoing
 conditions,  shall  be  a charge against the special fund. Any credit or
