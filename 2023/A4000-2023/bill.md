  Section  1.  The environmental conservation law is amended by adding a
 new section 71-0520 to read as follows:
 § 71-0520. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT PROJECTS IN LIEU OF CIVIL PENALTIES.
  1. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE FOLLOWING TERMS  SHALL  HAVE  THE
 FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
  A.  "ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF NONCOMPLIANCE" SHALL MEAN THAT PORTION OF THE
 CIVIL PENALTY WHICH INCLUDES THE ECONOMIC GAIN TO THE RESPONDENT RESULT-
 ING FROM ITS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE STANDARDS, CALCULATED
 FROM THE FIRST DAY OF  VIOLATION  AND  INCLUDES  THE  PRESENT  VALUE  OF
 AVOIDED  CAPITAL AND OPERATION COSTS AND PERMANENTLY AVOIDED COSTS WHICH
 WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPENDED IF COMPLIANCE HAD OCCURRED WHEN REQUIRED.
  B. "ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT PROJECT" OR "PROJECT" SHALL MEAN  A  PROJECT
 IN LIEU OF FULL PAYMENT OF CIVIL PENALTIES UNDERTAKEN BY A VIOLATOR THAT
 IS INTENDED TO COMPENSATE FOR A VIOLATION OR CONTRAVENTION OF APPLICABLE
 STANDARDS.
  C.  "GRAVITY  COMPONENT"  SHALL MEAN THAT PORTION OF THE CIVIL PENALTY
 WHICH REFLECTS THE SERIOUSNESS OF A VIOLATION, CALCULATED ON  THE  BASIS
 OF  THE POTENTIAL AND ACTUAL HARM CAUSED BY THE VIOLATION, AND THE VALUE
 OF THE NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES, IF THE VIOLATOR IS  NOT  REPAIRING  THE
 HARM.
  2.  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL NOT ENTER INTO ANY AGREEMENT OR ADMINISTRA-
 TIVE ORDER WHICH PROVIDES FOR A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT OF CONDITIONS IN  THE
 FORM  OF  ANY  ENVIRONMENTAL  BENEFIT  PROJECT IN LIEU OF THE PAYMENT OF
 CIVIL PENALTIES UNLESS ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
