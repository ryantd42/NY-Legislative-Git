 ive services to a dentist in his or her performance of  dental  services

 such other dental supportive services authorized by the dentist consist-
 ent with regulations promulgated by the commissioner, provided that such
 functions  are  performed  under  the  direct  personal supervision of a
 licensed dentist in the course of the performance  of  dental  services.
 Such  services  shall  not include diagnosing and/or performing surgical
 procedures, irreversible procedures or procedures that would  alter  the
 hard  or  soft  tissue  of  the oral and maxillofacial area or any other
 procedures determined by the  department.  The  practice  of  registered
 dental  assisting may be conducted in the office of any licensed dentist

 Direct personal supervision, for purposes of this section, means  super-
 vision  of  dental  procedures based on instructions given by a licensed
 dentist in the course of a procedure who remains in  the  dental  office
 where  the supportive services are being performed, personally diagnoses
 the condition to be treated, personally authorizes the  procedures,  and
 before  dismissal  of the patient, who remains the responsibility of the
 licensed dentist, evaluates the services  performed  by  the  registered
 dental  assistant. Nothing herein authorizes a registered dental assist-
 ant to perform any of the services or functions defined as part  of  the
 practice of dental hygiene in accordance with the provisions of subdivi-
 sion  one of section sixty-six hundred six of this article, except those
 functions authorized pursuant to this  section.  All  dental  supportive
 services  provided  in this section may be performed by currently regis-
 tered dental hygienists either under a dentist's supervision, as defined
 in regulations of the commissioner, or, in  the  case  of  a  registered
 dental  hygienist  working  for a hospital as defined in article twenty-
 eight of the public health law, pursuant to a collaborative  arrangement
 with  a  licensed  dentist in accordance with subdivision one of section
 sixty-six hundred six of this article.  Such  collaborative  arrangement
 shall  not  obviate  or  supersede  any law or regulation which requires
 identified services to be performed under the personal supervision of  a
 dentist.
  § 2. Subdivision 2 of section 6902 of the education law, as amended by
 chapter 781 of the laws of 1990, is amended to read as follows:
  2. The practice of nursing as a licensed practical nurse is defined as
 performing  tasks and responsibilities within the framework of casefind-
 ing, health teaching, health  counseling,  THE  APPLICATION  OF  TOPICAL
 FLUORIDE VARNISH, and provision of supportive and restorative care under
 the  direction of a registered professional nurse or licensed physician,
 dentist or other licensed health care provider legally authorized  under
 this title and in accordance with the commissioner's regulations.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
