  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as "the Jessica
 Nicole Gentile law".
  § 2. Legislative intent. (a) Opioid addiction  is  a  chronic  disease
 that can cause major health, social and economic problems. Opioids are a
 class  of  drugs  that  act in the nervous system to produce feelings of
 pleasure and pain relief. Some opioids are legally prescribed by  health
 care  providers  to  manage severe and chronic pain. Commonly prescribed
 opioids include oxycodone, fentanyl, buprenorphine,  methadone,  oxymor-
 phone,  hydrocodone,  codeine,  and  morphine.  Other  opioids,  such as
 heroin, are illegal drugs of abuse.
  Opioid addiction is characterized by a powerful,  compulsive  urge  to
 use opioid drugs, even if or when they are no longer required medically.
 Opioids have a high potential for causing addiction in some people, even
 when the medications are prescribed appropriately and taken as directed.
 Many  prescription  opioids are misused or diverted to others.  Individ-
 uals who become addicted may prioritize getting and  using  these  drugs
 over  other  activities in their lives, often negatively impacting their
 professional and personal relationships. It is unknown why  some  people
 are more likely to become addicted than others.

  Opioids  change the chemistry of the brain and lead to drug tolerance,
 which means that over time the dose needs to be increased to achieve the
 same effect.  Taking opioids over a long period of time produces depend-
 ence, such that when people stop taking the drug, they have physical and
 psychological  symptoms of withdrawal (such as muscle cramping, diarrhea
 and anxiety). Dependence is not the same thing  as  addiction;  although
 everyone who takes opioids for an extended period will become dependent,
 only  a small percentage also experience the compulsive, continuing need
 for the drug that characterizes addiction.
  Opioid addiction can cause life-threatening health problems, including
 the risk of overdose. Overdose occurs when high doses of  opioids  cause
 breathing  to  slow or stop, leading to unconsciousness and death if the
 overdose is not treated immediately.  Both  legal  and  illegal  opioids
 carry  a  risk of overdose if a person takes too much of the drug, or if
 opioids are combined with other drugs (particularly tranquilizers called
 benzodiazepines).
  In many cases, addiction requires a gateway drug.  Gateway  drugs  are
 substances  that,  when  consumed,  give  way  to harder, more dangerous
 drugs. These  milder  substances,  such  as  nicotine  or  alcohol,  are
 believed  to  open the door to the use of drugs such as meth, heroin and
 cocaine, which can lead to  addiction.  Opioid  abuse  does  not  always
 entail  prior  use  of  a gateway drug as opioids themselves are gateway
 drugs.
  Opioid abuse, along with the resulting overdose deaths, has  risen  to
 the point of being one of the worst drug epidemics in the history of the
 United  States.  According  to  the  Centers  for  Disease Control and
 Prevention (CDC) more than 750,000 people have died since  1999  from  a
 drug overdose. Two out of three drug overdose deaths in 2018 involved an
 opioid.  The  CDC reports that opioids were involved in more than 47,600
 overdose deaths in 2017 alone.
  Rarely do people abusing or addicted to  opioids  seek  treatment  for
 their  addiction  problems  until  they  run into problems with the law.
 According to research, opioid abusers do not believe  that  quitting  is
 even  an  option,  as  the  addiction  is  so powerful, they cannot even
 comprehend being free of it. For the most part, there are no  volunteers
 in  current  opioid  recovery programs, just forced participants ordered
 into the programs by the court. This makes the legal system, in  partic-
 ular  the  drug courts, an important part of this societal mental health
 crisis.
  (b) New York state leads the nation in the expansion  and  implementa-
 tion of drug courts into daily court operations.
  Drug  courts  use  a  collaborative  approach  to  treatment involving
 defense attorneys, prosecutors, treatment and education  providers,  and
 law  enforcement  officials.  Article  216 of the criminal procedure law
 authorizes a criminal drug court to  divert  eligible  felony  offenders
 into  substance  abuse  treatment programs in lieu of incarceration in a
 correctional  facility.  Non-violent  offenders  voluntarily  enter  the
 program  in  which  rules are clearly defined and a contract between the
 offender, attorneys, the district attorney and the court is signed.
  There are 141 drug courts in operation  statewide.  Defendants  facing
 certain  felony  or misdemeanor charges where drug addiction is a compo-
 nent of their offense may be eligible to participate in a criminal  drug
 treatment  court  program.  Those  who  successfully complete their drug
 treatment court program may have their charges dismissed or  reduced  or
 may receive a reduction in their sentence.
 A. 4146  3
 
  Young  adult  drug  treatment courts are operational in several of the
 criminal  courts.  These  courts  target  defendants  in  the  16-  to
 21-year-old population.
  In  2017,  New York state opened the first opioid court in the nation.
 The Buffalo Opioid Intervention Court provides  immediate  intervention,
 treatment  and medication for defendants who screen positive for opioids
 and who staff feel are at risk of overdose or addiction. The  University
 of  Buffalo  School of Family Medicine (UBFM), a grant partner, contrib-
 utes key staff positions. Those staff members provide daily case manage-
 ment for program participants and link those participants to  medication
 assisted treatment (MAT) within 48 hours of arraignment when indicated.
  In  the  Bronx,  which has one of the highest number of opioid-related
 overdoses and deaths in the state, the Bronx Opioid Avoidance and Recov-
 ery Court is a collaboration between the  court,  prosecutors,  and  the
 defense  bar.  Defendants  charged  with misdemeanor drug possession are
 diverted to existing treatment services. Because only misdemeanor offen-
 ders are eligible, charges are generally dismissed  upon  completion  of
 the recommended intervention.
  Results  from these diversion treatment programs have been positive. A
 2003 study of six drug courts conducted by the Center  for  Court  Inno-
 vation  demonstrated that the rates at which drug court graduates re-of-
 fend were significantly reduced as compared to rates at which  incarcer-
 ated  individuals  re-offended.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  an
 additional treatment option is required.
  Unfortunately, a percentage of defendants passing through drug  courts
 and  their  treatment  options  have  a difficult time remaining free of
 drugs after completing treatment,  particularly  those  individuals  who
 abuse  or  are  addicted to opioids. As the American Medical Association
 has declared substance abuse a disease, it can be  assumed  some  people
 are  sicker than others.  After completing treatment in a rehabilitation
 program and returning into society, usually in the same town where their
 drug contacts were, these individuals have a  difficult  time  remaining
 drug-free.
  The  current  model of drug court will tolerate relapse after relapse,
 to a certain point.  When judges get weary of these chronically addicted
 defendants, they place them directly into the  criminal  system  of  the
 court  to  serve  prison  time.  There is no middle ground between "drug
 court" rehabilitation referral and "criminal  court  system"  incarcera-
 tion.  Once  in  the criminal court system, each opioid abuser or addict
 will cost the state approximately $65,000 to $80,000 a year (the average
 cost of maintaining a prisoner). The recidivism rate for those sentenced
 to prison is approximately 45%.
  The cost of maintaining long-term or even lifelong inmates  in  prison
 and  the  destruction of many lives could be reduced by adding an option
 to the system between drug court and the criminal  system:  a  mandatory
 state-run  opioid  rehabilitation center, where people could voluntarily
 sign away their right to leave for one year or longer  in  exchange  for
 not  being  put into the prison system. In other words, a lock-up treat-
 ment center.
  This approach stands in contrast to  current  rehabilitation  referral
 measures  which entail outpatient treatment or residential treatment for
 limited periods of time. For some  individuals,  rehabilitation  options
 are determined by their insurance plan, not their actual needs.
  A state-run residential rehabilitation center would provide drug court
 judges  with  another  alternative  to  criminal court. It would provide
 ongoing treatment over an extended period of  time;  participants  would
 A. 4146  4
 
 not be released until health care providers believed they could success-
 fully refrain from drug use. Drug court judges would have another alter-
 native  to criminal court. They would no longer have to tolerate relapse
 after  relapse.  Participants  would benefit from an environment where
 recovery would be easier for them.
  (c) The legislature finds and declares that it is in the best interest
 of the people of the state of New York to reduce the burden on the  drug
 courts, the cost to the state and the amount of time needed by the judi-
 cial  system to handle drug cases by referring opioid-abusing or opioid-
 addicted criminal defendants to a facility under the supervision of  the
 Office  of  Addiction  Services  and  Supports,  while  at the same time
 providing desperately needed treatment to such individuals.  As  opposed
 to  incarceration,  a  mental  health  response is more likely to reduce
 recidivism, saving both lives and taxpayer money.

 procedure  law,  as  amended  by  chapter  435  of the laws of 2021, are
 amended to read as follows:
  4. When an authorized court determines, pursuant to paragraph  (b)  of
 subdivision  three of this section, that an eligible defendant should be
 offered alcohol or substance use treatment, or when the parties and  the
 court  agree  to  an  eligible  defendant's  participation in alcohol or
 substance use treatment, an eligible defendant may be allowed to partic-
 ipate in the judicial diversion program offered by this article.  Prior
 to  the court's issuing an order granting judicial diversion, the eligi-
 ble defendant shall be required to enter a plea of guilty to the  charge
 or  charges;  provided,  however,  that  no  such  guilty  plea shall be
 required when:
  (a) the people and the court consent to the entry  of  such  an  order
 without a plea of guilty; or
  (b)  based on a finding of exceptional circumstances, the court deter-
 mines that a plea of guilty shall not be required. For purposes of  this
 subdivision,  exceptional  circumstances  exist  when, regardless of the
 ultimate disposition of the case, the entry of a plea of guilty is like-
 ly to result in severe collateral consequences; OR
  (C) THE DEFENDANT IS ORDERED TO ENTER  A DEDICATED  OPIOID  REHABILI-
 TATION  PROGRAM  PURSUANT  TO ARTICLE TWENTY-THREE OF THE MENTAL HYGIENE
 LAW.
  5.  The  defendant shall agree on the record or in writing to abide by
 the release conditions set by the court, which, shall  include:  partic-
 ipation in a specified period of alcohol or substance use treatment at a
 specified program or programs identified by the court, which may include
 periods of detoxification, residential or outpatient treatment, or both,
 as  determined  after  taking  into account the views of the health care
 professional who conducted the alcohol and substance use evaluation  and
 any  health  care professionals responsible for providing such treatment
 or monitoring the  defendant's  progress  in  such  treatment;  and  may
 include:  (i)  periodic  court  appearances,  which may include periodic
 urinalysis; (ii) a requirement that the defendant refrain from  engaging
 in criminal behaviors; (iii) if the defendant needs treatment for opioid
 use,  that he or she may participate in and receive medically prescribed
 drug treatments under the care of a health care professional licensed or
 certified under title eight of the education law, acting within  his  or
 her  lawful  scope of practice, provided that no court shall require the
 use of any specified  type  or  brand  of  drug  during  the  course  of
 medically  prescribed  drug  treatments;  AND  (IV) IF A DEFENDANT IN  A
 CASE  BROUGHT  IN  AN OPIOID COURT NEEDS TREATMENT FOR OPIOID  ABUSE  OR
 DEPENDENCE,  THAT  HE  OR  SHE MAY BE REFERRED  TO  A  DEDICATED  OPIOID
 REHABILITATION FACILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  ARTICLE
 TWENTY-THREE OF THE MENTAL HYGIENE LAW.
  6.  (A)  Upon an eligible defendant's agreement to abide by the condi-
 tions set by the court, the court shall issue a securing order providing
 for bail or release on the defendant's own recognizance and conditioning
 any release upon the agreed upon conditions. The period  of  alcohol  or
 substance  use  treatment  shall  begin as specified by the court and as
 soon as practicable after the defendant's release, taking  into  account
 the  availability  of  treatment, so as to facilitate early intervention
 A. 4146  13
 
 with respect to the defendant's  substance  use  or  condition  and  the
 effectiveness  of  the  treatment program. In the event that a treatment
 program is not immediately available or becomes unavailable  during  the
 course  of  the  defendant's  participation  in  the  judicial diversion
 program, the court may release the defendant pursuant  to  the  securing
 order.
  (B)  UPON THE AGREEMENT OF AN ELIGIBLE DEFENDANT IN A CASE  BROUGHT IN
 AN  OPIOID  COURT TO ABIDE BY THE CONDITIONS SET BY THE COURT, THE COURT
 SHALL ISSUE AN ORDER DIRECTING THE COMMITMENT OF  SUCH  DEFENDANT TO  A
 DEDICATED  OPIOID  REHABILITATION  FACILITY  IN  ACCORDANCE WITH  THE
 PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE TWENTY-THREE OF THE MENTAL HYGIENE LAW.
  7. (A) When participating in judicial diversion treatment pursuant  to
 this  article, any resident of this state who is covered under a private
 health insurance policy or contract issued for delivery  in  this  state
 pursuant to article thirty-two, forty-three or forty-seven of the insur-
 ance  law  or  article  forty-four  of  the public health law, or who is
 covered by a self-funded plan which provides coverage for the  diagnosis
 and  treatment of chemical abuse and chemical dependence however defined
 in such policy; shall first seek reimbursement  for  such  treatment  in
 accordance with the provisions of such policy or contract.

 REHABILITATION FACILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  ARTICLE
 TWENTY-THREE  OF  THE MENTAL HYGIENE LAW, WHO IS COVERED UNDER A PRIVATE
 HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY OR CONTRACT ISSUED FOR DELIVERY  IN THIS  STATE
 PURSUANT TO ARTICLE THIRTY-TWO, FORTY-THREE OR FORTY-SEVEN OF THE INSUR-
 ANCE  LAW  OR  ARTICLE  FORTY-FOUR  OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH LAW, OR WHO IS
 COVERED BY A SELF-FUNDED PLAN WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE FOR THE  DIAGNOSIS
 AND  TREATMENT OF CHEMICAL ABUSE AND CHEMICAL DEPENDENCE HOWEVER DEFINED
 IN SUCH POLICY, SUCH DEFENDANT SHALL FIRST SEEK REIMBURSEMENT  FOR  SUCH
 TREATMENT IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH POLICY OR  CONTRACT
 AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION TO THE DEDICATED OPIOID  REHABILITATION  CENTER
 AND  AGAIN UPON DISCHARGE FROM SUCH FACILITY AND RESUMPTION OF TREATMENT
 THROUGH ANY ALTERNATIVE IN-PATIENT OR OUTPATIENT PROGRAM.
  8.  During  the  period of a defendant's participation in the judicial
 diversion program, the court shall retain jurisdiction of the defendant,
 provided, however, that, UNLESS THE DEFENDANT HAS BEEN ORDERED TO  ENTER
 A  DEDICATED  OPIOID  REHABILITATION  FACILITY  IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE
 PROVISIONS  OF ARTICLE TWENTY-THREE OF THE MENTAL HYGIENE LAW, the court
 may allow such defendant to (i) reside in another jurisdiction, or  (ii)
 participate in alcohol and substance use treatment and other programs in
 the  jurisdiction  where the defendant resides or in any other jurisdic-
 tion, while participating in a judicial diversion program  under  condi-
 tions set by the court and agreed to by the defendant pursuant to subdi-
 visions  five  and  six  of  this  section.  The  court  may require the
 defendant to appear in court at any time to enable the court to  monitor
 the  defendant's  progress  in  alcohol  or substance use treatment. The
 court shall provide notice, reasonable under the circumstances,  to  the
 people,  the treatment provider, the defendant and the defendant's coun-
 sel whenever it orders or  otherwise  requires  the  appearance  of  the
 defendant  in  court.  Failure  to appear as required without reasonable
 cause therefor shall constitute a violation of  the  conditions  of  the
 court's agreement with the defendant.

 vision 7 to read as follows:
