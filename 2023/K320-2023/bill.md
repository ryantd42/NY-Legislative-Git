  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Mathematics and Statistics  Awareness
  Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative Body to observe
official months that are  set  aside  to  recognize  the  importance  of
Mathematics and Statistics to the citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Mathematics
and  Statistics Awareness Month in the State of New York, in conjunction
with the observance of National  Mathematics  and  Statistics  Awareness
Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  mission of Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month
is to increase the understanding and appreciation of the  two  subjects;
both play a significant role in addressing many real-world problems such
as  internet security, sustainability, disease, climate change, the data
deluge, and much more; and
 
  WHEREAS, Research in these and other areas is ongoing, revealing new
results  and  applications  every  day  in  fields  such  as  medicine,
manufacturing, energy, biotechnology, and business; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mathematics  and  statistics  are  important  drivers  of
innovation  in  our  technological  world,  in  which  new  systems  and
methodologies continue to become more complex; and
 
  WHEREAS, Basic research in mathematics is valuable in itself, but it
often  contributes  to  research  in other sciences and has often, years
later, led to discoveries that affect society today; and
 
  WHEREAS, An encryption algorithm used today in e-commerce relies  on
results discovered in the 17th and 18th centuries, long before computers
were  invented;  mathematics  has  inspired  some  of  the most stunning
architecture and art; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the age of big data, statistics underlies  almost  every
decision  made  today,  whether it is the effectiveness of a new drug or
treatment or the debut  of  a  new  mobile  device;  statistics  is  how
analysts  convert  raw  data  into  useful  information, from studies of
proteins to surveys of galaxies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Research in statistics and  the  mathematical  sciences  is
important  for  its  applications  and because it trains one in critical
thinking and problem solving; and
 
  WHEREAS, From magic squares and Mobius bands to magical card  tricks
and  illusions,  mysterious  phenomena  with elegant "Aha!" explanations
have been part of both subjects for centuries; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that all New Yorkers celebrate mathematics
and statistics and the diverse researchers and students in these  fields
who  are  contributing  so  much  to  furthering  discoveries,  solving
problems, and finding beauty in our world; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Mathematics
and Statistics Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York;  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
