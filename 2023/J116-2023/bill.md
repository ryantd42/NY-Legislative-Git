  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 15-21, 2023, as Healthy Weight Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Beauty,  health and strength come in all sizes; this truth
is affirmed by Health at Every Size, a  health-centered  approach  which
focuses on health and well-being, not on dieting which can be harmful to
an individual's self-esteem; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Many  people  diet  because  they  view  themselves  as
overweight, and begin to punish and deprive  themselves  by  restricting
calories;  however,  if someone is always hungry or feeling deprived and
sees themselves as fat, then the reverse happens and the individual  may
pack on the pounds; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Health and Wellness is the feeling of health, happiness or
well-being in regard to one's  physical  health,  energy  level,  mental
state,  emotions,  and ability to regulate one's lifestyle as pertaining
to individuals in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Healthy Weight Week was implemented in 1994 to  let  people
know that a healthy lifestyle is about wellness and wholeness, eating in
normal,  healthy ways, and living actively; it is not about dieting, but
about acceptance, respect and appreciation of diversity and one's  self;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is also important that individuals understand what is a
healthy weight; uncontrollable elements which affect weight are  height,
bone  density,  body type such as endomorph, mesomorph or ectomorph, and
body composition which is the innate ratio of body muscle to fat; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body regards healthy  weight  programs  in
New  York  State  as sustainable and crucial components to public health
and education policy; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body affirms  the  importance  of  caring,
healing,  and  improving  the minds and bodies of individuals throughout
this great Empire State, making New York a healthier and  happier  place
to  work and reside which leads to safer cities, productive environments
and greater opportunity for all New Yorkers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim January 15-21, 2023, as
Healthy Weight Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
