  enacting the "childhood lead poisoning prevention and safe housing act
  of 2023"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the "childhood
 lead poisoning prevention and safe housing act of 2023".
  § 2. Legislative findings and purposes. 1. (a) Lead poisoning of chil-
 dren persists as one of the most prevalent and preventable environmental
 diseases in New York. Nearly 100,000 children were newly identified with
 levels of lead in their blood at or above  5  micrograms  per  deciliter
 (ug/dL)  in  New  York state between 2011 and 2015. Moreover, only about
 one-third of  children  are  receiving  the  lead  screenings  that  are
 required by law and therefore, the actual number of children affected by
 the ingestion or inhalation of lead is undoubtedly significantly greater
 than  reported. Prevention is the only effective way to protect children
 from irreversible damage. Unless lead poisoning is  prevented,  elevated
 blood  lead  levels will result in impairment of the ability of children
 to think, concentrate, and learn.
  (b) Medical research indicates that  children  can  suffer  permanent,
 irreparable  damage  at  blood  levels  even lower than 5ug/dL, and that
 there is no level of lead  ingestion  or  inhalation  which  is  without
 adverse impact. Medical research also indicates that fetal injuries from
 lead paint can occur if women have elevated blood levels during pregnan-
 cy.  Because  of  this, intervention measures that wait until children

 have been exposed have limited benefits,  and  the  pursuit  of  primary
 prevention,  which  means  eliminating  lead hazards before children are
 exposed, has been recommended by the federal centers for disease control
 and  prevention  (CDC) and promoted by leading experts in the field as a
 critical course of action to protect the health of young children.
  (c) Adult exposure to lead is also dangerous. It increases the risk of
 mortality from hypertension and cardiovascular  disease  with  a  recent
 large-scale  study  finding that 400,000 deaths per year in the U.S. are
 attributable to lead exposure. The study found  that  even  adult  blood
 lead concentrations lower than 5 ug/dL are associated with mortality. In
 addition,  the  federal environmental protection agency (EPA) classifies
 lead as a probable human carcinogen.
  (d) The predominant cause of lead poisoning in children is the  inges-
 tion or inhalation of lead particles from deteriorating or abraded lead-
 based paint from older and poorly maintained residences.
  (e) Deteriorating lead-based paint or excessive amounts of lead-conta-
 minated dust in these poorly maintained homes, or lead-contaminated soil
 around  residences, endangers the intellectual and emotional development
 and physical well-being of affected children, and  endangers  the  long-
 term  health of all inhabitants. In addition, unsafe work practices that
 inadequately control lead dust in the  repair  or  renovation  of  older
 homes can cause substantial lead hazards.
  (f)  Although  New  York  state  banned the sale of lead paint in 1970
 (chapter 338 of the laws of 1970), seventy percent of New York's housing
 stock was constructed prior  to  1970,  and  seventy-eight  percent  was
 constructed  prior to 1978, the year federal law banned the use of lead-
 based paint in residential homes. At least ninety percent of  lead-based
 paint  still  remaining in occupied housing exists in units built before
 1960. New York state has both the largest  percentage  and  the  largest
 absolute number of older housing units with lead paint in the nation.
  (g)  The  dangers  posed  by  lead-based  paint  can  be substantially
 reduced, although not eliminated, by taking measures  to  prevent  paint
 deterioration  and  limiting children's exposure to paint chips and lead
 dust.
  (h) The deterioration of lead-based paint in older residences  results
 in increased expenses each year for the state of New York in the form of
 special  education  and  other education expenses, medical care for lead
 poisoned children, and expenditures  for  delinquent  youth  and  others
 needing  special supervision. The overall social costs of lead poisoning
 are estimated to amount to at least six billion dollars annually.
  (i) Older housing units remain an important part of New York's housing
 stock, particularly for those of modest or limited incomes. The  problem
 of  lead-based paint in housing, as well as in surrounding soil, affects
 urban, suburban and rural areas of the state.
  (j) The existing housing codes and enforcement  systems  in  most  New
 York  jurisdictions  do not include primary prevention measures for lead
 hazards and have proven ineffective in encouraging widespread lead-based
 paint hazard abatement, mitigation, and control. As a  result,  in  many
 cases  lead  hazards  are often not identified until a child is found to
 have high concentrations of lead in their blood.
  (k) The financial incentives currently in place have not proven suffi-
 cient to motivate landlords and other property owners to undertake wide-
 spread and effective lead-based paint hazard abatement, mitigation,  and
 control;  moreover  low and moderate income property owners may not have
 access to the  resources  to  eliminate  or  substantially  reduce  lead
 hazards.
 S. 2947  3
 
  (l)  Insurance companies are reluctant to provide coverage to property
 owners in the absence of evidence that lead hazards have been  appropri-
 ately addressed.
  (m)  Knowledge of lead-based paint hazards, their control, mitigation,
 abatement, and risk avoidance is not sufficiently widespread, especially
 outside urban areas.
  2. The purposes of this act are:
  (a) to increase the supply of affordable rental housing in  the  state
 of  New  York in which measures have been taken to eliminate or substan-
 tially reduce the risk of childhood lead poisoning;
  (b) to ensure that New York's response  to  lead-based  paint  hazards
 focuses  on primary prevention as the essential tool to combat childhood
 lead poisoning - meaning that lead hazards are  eliminated  or  substan-
 tially  reduced  before  a child has been poisoned, and thus to substan-
 tially reduce, and eventually eliminate, the incidence of childhood lead
 poisoning in the state of New York;
  (c) to establish lead hazard control standards in  the  state  of  New
 York, and make their enforcement more certain and more effective;
  (d)  to  improve  public  awareness of the dangers of exposure to lead
 even at low levels, and to educate  both  property  owners  and  tenants
 about practices that can reduce the incidence of lead poisoning; and
  (e)  to  provide resources for property owners who commit to undertake
 specified lead hazard reduction measures;
  (f) to improve the responses of the  department  of  health  in  those
 situations  where  children  are  identified  with  elevated  blood lead
 levels; and
  (g) to better coordinate across various departments  and  agencies  to
 protect children from lead poisoning.
