  COMMEMORATING  the  105th  Anniversary  of Enjem's
  Flooring America of Utica, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  the
achievements  of  those  individuals  and  businesses  that  contribute
substantially to the economic vitality  of  their  communities,  thereby
enhancing economic well-being of the entire Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the 105th Anniversary of Enjem's Flooring America of Utica,
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Enjem's Flooring America was established by Matilda and Jim
Enjem in 1917 at a storefront in Utica, New York; the family now has  an
additional store in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A family owned and operated business for the past century,
Matilda and Jim Enjem proudly passed the reins of managing the store  to
their  two  sons,  David,  and  Joseph Enjem; they continued to grow the
flooring segment of the business, helping many local  families  set  the
foundations of their homes for the generations to come; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the two locations are managed by Tony Enjem, who was
one  of  the  very first Carpetmax dealers, and his son, Mark Enjem; the
Enjem family more recently partnered with Carpetmax, which later  became
Flooring America; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Enjem's  Flooring  America  carries  a  full assortment of
flooring products  which  includes  area  rugs,  vinyl,  wood,  ceramic,
laminate,  luxury  tile, bamboo, cork, natural stone, and oriental rugs;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its distinguished history spanning nearly  a  century,
Enjem's  Flooring  America  has  demonstrated  continuous service to the
residents and communities which it serves; they try  to  help  those  in
need  whenever  they  can,  with a history of donating their services at
little or no cost to local charities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Enjem's  Flooring  America  has  completed  notable  jobs,
including  providing  flooring  for  their  local NBC affiliate, gaining
consumer  visibility  through  news  broadcasts,  and  even  during  the
much-watched  1980  Winter  Olympics;  the  company  also  aided  in the
restoration of Utica's historic Stanley Theatre; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success  of  Enjem's  Flooring  America  is  in  direct
correlation  to  the efforts of its hardworking and dedicated staff, all
of whom are considered a part of the Enjem family; their involvement is,
and always has been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the business and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional business, its contributions to the local
and state economies, and its vibrant role in improving  the  quality  of
life  in  its  community, fully confident that it will continue to enjoy
the  sparkling successes it has experienced thus far; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate the 105th Anniversary of Enjem's Flooring America; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
