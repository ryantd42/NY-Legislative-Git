  55.  STRETCH  LIMOUSINE  AGE  AND  MILEAGE PARAMETERS. (A) IT SHALL BE
 UNLAWFUL TO OPERATE OR CAUSE TO BE OPERATED A STRETCH  LIMOUSINE  REGIS-

 TITLE  AND  ABSENCE  OF  OUT-OF-SERVICE "A" DEFECTS PURSUANT TO 17 NYCRR
 720.11.
  (D) (I) A STRETCH LIMOUSINE WITH AN ODOMETER READING THAT DIFFERS FROM
 THE NUMBER OF MILES THE STRETCH LIMOUSINE HAS ACTUALLY TRAVELED OR  THAT
 HAS HAD A PRIOR HISTORY INVOLVING THE DISCONNECTION OR MALFUNCTIONING OF
 AN  ODOMETER  OR WHICH APPEARS TO THE COMMISSIONER TO HAVE AN INACCURATE
 ODOMETER READING BASED ON PRIOR INSPECTION RECORDS, WILL BE ASSIGNED  AN
 IMPUTED MILEAGE FOR EACH MONTH FROM THE LAST RELIABLE ODOMETER RECORDING

 INSPECTIONS, INCLUDING ROADSIDE INSPECTIONS CONDUCTED BY THE COMMISSION-
 ER OF TRANSPORTATION OR DIVISION OF  STATE  POLICE,  WHICHEVER  IS  MORE

 ED MONTHLY MILEAGE.

 RELIABLE BASELINE ODOMETER READING CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED.
  (IV)  A  MOTOR  CARRIER OR OPERATOR WHO KNOWS OR HAS REASON TO BELIEVE
 THAT THE ODOMETER READING OF A LIMOUSINE  DIFFERS  FROM  THE  NUMBER  OF
 MILES  THE  STRETCH  LIMOUSINE HAS ACTUALLY TRAVELED SHALL DISCLOSE THAT
 STATUS TO THE COMMISSIONER OR THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  TRANSPORTATION  IMME-
 DIATELY.
