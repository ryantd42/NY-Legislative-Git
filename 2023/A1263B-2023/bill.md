 treatment.  THE  FREQUENCY  OF  APPEARANCES  SHALL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A
 PERSON'S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND TREATMENT PROGRESS  IN  ACCORDANCE
 WITH  BEST  PRACTICES.  The court shall provide notice, reasonable under
 the circumstances, to the people, the treatment provider,  the  [defend-
 ant] PARTICIPANT and the [defendant's] PARTICIPANT'S counsel whenever it
 orders  or  otherwise  requires  the  appearance  of  the [defendant in]
 PARTICIPATION FOR court APPEARANCES. Failure to appear as required with-
 out reasonable cause therefor shall constitute a violation of the condi-
 tions of the court's agreement with the [defendant] PARTICIPANT.

 willfully failed to appear before the  court  as  requested,  the  court
 except  as provided in subdivision two of section 510.50 of this chapter

 dy and bring the defendant before the court without  unnecessary  delay;
 A. 1263--A  8

 provided,  however,  that  under  no circumstances shall a defendant who
 requires treatment for opioid use be deemed to have violated  a  release
 condition  on  the  basis  of  his  or  her  participation  in medically
 prescribed  drug treatments under the care of a health care professional
 licensed or certified under title eight of  the  education  law,  acting
 within  his  or  her  lawful  scope  of  practice]  FOR A HEARING ON THE
 VIOLATION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SUBDIVISION  WITH  AT  LEAST
 FORTY-EIGHT  HOURS  NOTICE TO THE PARTICIPANT OR THE PARTICIPANT'S COUN-
 SEL, UNLESS NOTICE IS WAIVED BY THE PARTICIPANT.  THE  COURT  MAY  NOT
 MODIFY THE PARTICIPANT'S SECURING ORDER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE HEARING'S

 relating to issuance of securing orders shall apply to such  proceedings
 under  this  subdivision.  THERE IS A PRESUMPTION THAT A BENCH WARRANT
 SHALL NOT BE ISSUED FOR PARTICIPANTS IN JUDICIAL DIVERSION.
  (b) In determining whether a [defendant] PARTICIPANT violated a condi-
 tion of [his or her release under] the  judicial  diversion  program  OR
 WILLFULLY  FAILED  TO  APPEAR  IN COURT, the court [may] SHALL conduct a
 [summary] hearing consistent with due process [and sufficient] to satis-
 fy the court that the [defendant] PARTICIPANT has, in fact, violated the
 condition OR WILLFULLY FAILED TO APPEAR.

 THE  PARTICIPANT'S COUNSEL, BUT IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE LESS THAN FORTY-EIGHT
 HOURS NOTICE, UNLESS NOTICE IS WAIVED BY THE PARTICIPANT.
  (II) THE PEOPLE SHALL BEAR THE BURDEN OF PROVING BY CLEAR AND CONVINC-
 ING EVIDENCE THAT THE PARTICIPANT HAS VIOLATED A CONDITION OF THE  JUDI-
 CIAL  DIVERSION  PROGRAM  IN  AN  IMPORTANT RESPECT. THE PARTICIPANT MAY
 CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES AND MAY PRESENT RELEVANT, ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE ON
 THEIR OWN BEHALF. THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER ALL FACTORS RELATING  TO  THE
 PARTICIPANT'S  CURRENT  MENTAL HEALTH OR COGNITIVE STATUS, THEIR ENGAGE-
 MENT WITH JUDICIAL DIVERSION PRIOR TO THIS TIME, AS WELL  AS  ANY  OTHER
 FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE IMPACTED THEIR PARTICIPATION OR ALLEGED VIOLATION.
  (III)  A  BENCH  WARRANT  SHALL  NOT BE ISSUED ABSENT A FINDING BY THE
 COURT THAT THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OR FAILURE TO APPEAR  WAS  WILLFUL.  IN
 DETERMINING WILLFULNESS, THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER: THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE
 PARTICIPANT'S  VIOLATION  OR  FAILURE  TO  APPEAR  AND  THEIR FUNCTIONAL
 IMPAIRMENT; WHETHER AN APPROPRIATE TREATMENT PLAN IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE;
 THE PARTICIPANT'S HISTORY OF MAKING COURT  APPEARANCES  IN  THE  INSTANT
 MATTER; AND A HISTORY OF POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH TREATMENT STAFF OR THE
 COURT.
  (IV) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL A PARTICIPANT WHO REQUIRES TREATMENT
 FOR  A FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT BE DEEMED TO HAVE VIOLATED A PROGRAM CONDI-
 TION ON THE PARTICIPATION IN MEDICALLY PRESCRIBED DRUG TREATMENTS  UNDER
 THE CARE OF A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL LICENSED OR CERTIFIED UNDER TITLE
 EIGHT  OF  THE  EDUCATION  LAW, ACTING WITHIN HIS OR HER LAWFUL SCOPE OF
 PRACTICE.
  (V) IF THE COURT FINDS A REASONABLE EXPLANATION OR MITIGATION FOR  ANY
 ALLEGED  VIOLATION  OR  ALLEGED  WILLFUL FAILURE TO APPEAR, THE SECURING
 ORDER SHALL NOT BE MODIFIED.
  (VI) THE COURT MAY SEAL PORTIONS OF THE PROCEEDING RELATED TO  COLLAT-
 ERAL  CONSEQUENCES  AT  THE REQUEST OF THE PARTICIPANT AND PARTICIPANT'S
 COUNSEL.
