 AN ACT to authorize the city of New  York  to  establish  an  electronic
  voter registration transmittal system for New York city residents; and
  providing for the repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  law,  rule,  regu-
 lation  or policy to the contrary, any municipal agency so authorized by
 local law of the city of New York may establish and  maintain  an  elec-
 tronic personal voter registration transmittal system for applicants who
 are  New  York city residents. Such system may be established before the
 establishment of any system otherwise authorized by law, and the  exist-
 ence  of  the  system  authorized by this section shall not be deemed to
 preclude New York city residents from  utilizing  any  system  otherwise
 authorized  by  law.  Completed  applications  that  are filed using the
 system authorized by this section, when  transmitted  to  the  board  of
 elections  in  the  city  of  New  York not later than the twentieth day
 before the next ensuing primary,  general  or  special  election,  shall
 entitle the applicant to vote in such election provided the board deter-
 mines  that  the applicant is otherwise qualified. Applications shall be
 processed by such board in the manner prescribed in by section 5-210  of
 the election law or, if the applicant is already registered to vote from
 another  address  in New York state, in the manner prescribed by section
 5-208 of the election law. Such board shall send the appropriate  notice
 of  approval or rejection as required by either subdivision 9 of section
 5-210 of the election law or subdivision  5  of  section  5-208  of  the
 election  law. Such system may utilize an electronic or manual signature
 that is in the custody of the department of motor  vehicles,  the  state
 board  of  elections,  any  other  agency designated by section 5-211 or

 5-212 of the election law, or any agency designated as  a  participating
 agency  or authorized to collect such signatures under section 1057-a or
 1057-f of the New York city charter, with the consent of the  individual
 that  produced  the signature. The online voter registration application
 utilized by such  electronic  personal  voter  registration  transmittal
 system  may  contain  such  minor,  non-substantive  variations  of  the
 requirements of section 5-210 of the election law with  respect  to  the
 format  and content of the application as may be reasonably necessary to
 facilitate the electronic collection, transmission, and storage of data,
 provided that the application shall include all of the  voter  registra-
 tion information required by such section.
  §  2.  This  act  shall  take  effect  immediately and shall be deemed
 repealed 90 days after the date that a statewide electronic voter regis-
 tration transmittal system, to be established  by  the  state  board  of
 elections pursuant to title 8 of article 5 of the election law, as added
 by part CCC of chapter 55 of the laws of 2019, is operational and acces-
 sible to residents of the city of New York. The state board of elections
 shall notify the legislative bill drafting commission upon the date that
 such  system  is operational and accessible in order that the commission
 may maintain an accurate and timely effective data base of the  official
 text of the laws of the state of New York in furtherance of effectuating
 the  provisions of section 44 of the legislative law and section 70-b of
 the public officers law.
