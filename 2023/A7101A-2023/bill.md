 AN  ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing the "New
  York individuals with dyslexia education act" and implementing a  plan
  to identify and support students with characteristics of dyslexia
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known as the "New York  individuals  with
 dyslexia education act".
  §  2. The education law is amended by adding a new section 926 to read
 as follows:
  § 926. DYSLEXIA EDUCATION ACT. 1. AS USED IN THIS SECTION:  A. "DYSLE-
 XIA" MEANS A SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY  THAT  IS  NEUROBIOLOGICAL  IN
 ORIGIN.  DYSLEXIA  IS CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFICULTIES WITH ACCURATE AND/OR
 FLUENT WORD RECOGNITION AND BY POOR  SPELLING  AND  DECODING  ABILITIES.
 THESE  DIFFICULTIES  TYPICALLY RESULT FROM A DEFICIT IN THE PHONOLOGICAL
 COMPONENT OF LANGUAGE THAT IS OFTEN  UNEXPECTED  IN  RELATION  TO  OTHER
 COGNITIVE  ABILITIES  AND  THE PROVISION OF EFFECTIVE CLASSROOM INSTRUC-
 TION. SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES MAY INCLUDE PROBLEMS IN READING  COMPREHEN-
 SION AND REDUCED READING EXPERIENCE THAT CAN IMPEDE GROWTH OF VOCABULARY
 AND  BACKGROUND  KNOWLEDGE.  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, DYSLEXIA
 SHALL ALSO INCLUDE DYSGRAPHIA, A NEUROLOGICAL AND LEARNING DIFFERENCE IN
 WHICH SOMEONE HAS DIFFICULTY WRITING FOR THEIR AGE LEVEL.
  B. "DYSLEXIA SCREENING" MEANS A PROCESS, AS DETERMINED BY  THE  SCHOOL
 DISTRICT, FOR GATHERING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO DETERMINE IF THE CHAR-
 ACTERISTICS OF DYSLEXIA ARE PRESENT.
  C.  "MULTI-TIERED  SYSTEM  OF  SUPPORT  (MTSS)"  MEANS A FRAMEWORK FOR
 SUPPORTING AND INCREASING ACADEMIC,  BEHAVIORAL,  AND  SOCIAL  EMOTIONAL
 OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
  LBD10911-04-3
 A. 7101--A  2
 
  D. "UNIVERSAL SCREENER" MEANS AN ASSESSMENT THAT IS ADMINISTERED THREE
 TIMES  PER  YEAR  (BEGINNING,  MIDDLE,  AND  END) TO IDENTIFY OR PREDICT
 STUDENTS WHO MAY BE AT RISK FOR POOR READING OUTCOMES AND  IS  TYPICALLY
 BRIEF AND CONDUCTED WITH ALL STUDENTS AT A PARTICULAR GRADE LEVEL.
  E.  "STRUCTURED LITERACY" MEANS AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH TO TEACHING
 ORAL AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE ALIGNED TO THE SCIENCE OF READING. IT IS BASED
 ON THE SCIENCE OF HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO READ  AND  IS  CHARACTERIZED  BY
 EXPLICIT, SYSTEMATIC, CUMULATIVE, AND DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUCTION IN PHONOLO-
 GY,  SOUND-SYMBOL ASSOCIATION, SYLLABLE INSTRUCTION, MORPHOLOGY, SYNTAX,
 AND SEMANTICS.
  F. "SCIENCE OF READING" MEANS THE LARGE BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT  INFORMS
 HOW  PROFICIENT  READING  AND WRITING DEVELOP; WHY SOME HAVE DIFFICULTY;
 AND HOW WE CAN MOST EFFECTIVELY ASSESS AND TEACH AND, THEREFORE, IMPROVE
 STUDENT OUTCOMES THROUGH PREVENTION  OF  AND  INTERVENTION  FOR  READING
 DIFFICULTIES.
  G. "DYSLEXIA-SPECIFIC INTERVENTION" MEANS EVIDENCED-BASED, SPECIALIZED
 READING,  WRITING,  AND  SPELLING  INSTRUCTION  THAT  IS MULTISENSORY IN
 NATURE  AND  EQUIPS  STUDENTS  TO  SIMULTANEOUSLY  USE  MULTIPLE  SENSES
 (VISION,  HEARING,  TOUCH, AND MOVEMENT). DYSLEXIA-SPECIFIC INTERVENTION
 EMPLOYS DIRECT INSTRUCTION OF SYSTEMATIC  AND  CUMULATIVE  CONTENT.  THE
 SEQUENCE  SHALL  BEGIN  WITH  THE  EASIEST  AND  MOST BASIC ELEMENTS AND
 PROGRESS METHODICALLY TO MORE DIFFICULT MATERIAL. EACH STEP  SHALL  ALSO
 BE  BASED  ON  THOSE  ALREADY  LEARNED. CONCEPTS SHALL BE SYSTEMATICALLY
 REVIEWED TO STRENGTHEN MEMORY. COMPONENTS  OF  DYSLEXIA-SPECIFIC  INTER-
 VENTION INCLUDE INSTRUCTION TARGETING PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS, SOUND-SYM-
 BOL  ASSOCIATION, SYLLABLE STRUCTURE, MORPHOLOGY, SYNTAX, AND SEMANTICS.
 DYSLEXIA-SPECIFIC INTERVENTION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE THREE-CUEING SYSTEMS
 MODEL OF INSTRUCTION.
  H. "DYSLEXIA INTERVENTIONIST" MEANS  THE  TEACHER  OR  INDIVIDUAL  WHO
 PROVIDES  DYSLEXIA-SPECIFIC  INTERVENTION.  THE DYSLEXIA INTERVENTIONIST
 SHALL HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A  CERTIFICATION  TRAINING  COURSE  OR
 SHALL  HAVE  COMPLETED TRAINING IN THE APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
 EVIDENCE-BASED, DYSLEXIA-SPECIFIC INTERVENTION BEING PROVIDED, INCLUDING
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO AN ORTON-GILLINGHAM BASED APPROACH OR ANOTHER  MULTI-
 SENSORY  STRUCTURED  LITERACY  APPROACH  ACCREDITED BY THE INTERNATIONAL
 MULTISENSORY STRUCTURED LANGUAGE EDUCATION COUNCIL (IMSLEC).
  I. "DYSLEXIA THERAPIST" OR "DYSLEXIA SPECIALIST"  MEANS  THE  EDUCATOR
 WHO  IS  ENROLLED IN OR HAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A TRAINING PROGRAM IN
 AN ORTON-GILLINGHAM BASED APPROACH OR ANOTHER  MULTI-SENSORY  STRUCTURED
 LITERACY  APPROACH  ACCREDITED  BY THE INTERNATIONAL MULTISENSORY STRUC-
 TURED LANGUAGE EDUCATION COUNCIL (IMSLEC).
  2. EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL ADOPT A POLICY TO REQUIRE  SCREENING  OF
 STUDENTS IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FIFTH GRADE FOR THE RISK FACTORS
 OF  DYSLEXIA  USING  A DYSLEXIA SCREENER APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THE
 DYSLEXIA SCREENING SHALL BE ADMINISTERED ANNUALLY DURING THE  SPRING  OF
 KINDERGARTEN  AND  AT  THE  BEGINNING OF FIRST THROUGH FIFTH GRADES. THE
 SCREENING OF STUDENTS USING AN APPROVED DYSLEXIA SCREENER MUST  INCLUDE,
 AS DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE, ALL OF THE FOLLOWING:
  A. PHONOLOGICAL AND PHONEMIC AWARENESS;
  B. SOUND-SYMBOL RECOGNITION;
  C. ALPHABET KNOWLEDGE;
  D. DECODING SKILLS;
