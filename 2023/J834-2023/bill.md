  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize  that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York

  WHEREAS,  The  North  Shore  Leader  has  been  a  vitally important
institution on the North Shore for over 27 years and  is  known  in  the
communities  that  it  serves  for  its quality journalism and effective
involvement in the issues that touch the lives  of  so  many  residents;
each  week,  the  newspaper  reaches  thousands  of  Gold Coast readers,
covering and reaching all the communities from Manhasset in the West  to
Northport in the East and everything in between; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Angela  Susan  Anton  is a dynamic and innovative business

  WHEREAS,  Owned  by  Richner Communications, which is led by CEO and
publisher Stuart Richner, the Oyster  Bay  Herald  Guardian,  now  known

124  years,  it has stayed true to its mission of serving Oyster Bay and
the surrounding villages, providing important information for those  who
live  and  work  in  the  communities  often  overlooked  by other media
outlets; and
 
  WHEREAS, Located at 20 West  Main  Street  in  Oyster  Bay  on  Long
Island, the Raynham Hall Museum was the home of the Townsend family, who
helped  settle  the  town,  and  who were members of George Washington's
Culper Ring of Spies; the house  was  renamed  Raynham  Hall  after  the
Townsend seat in Norfolk, England, in 1850 by a grandson of the original

enhance  the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown a
long and sustained commitment to excellence certainly  have  earned  the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Friends and Trustees  Inc.  of  Raynham  Hall  Museum  upon  the
