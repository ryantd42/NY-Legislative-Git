  2. IT SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE OR IMMUNITY TO ANY ACTION THAT AN ELECTED
 PUBLIC  OFFICER  WAS  ACTING  IN GOOD FAITH, OR THAT SUCH PUBLIC OFFICER
 BELIEVED, REASONABLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THEIR CONDUCT WAS LAWFUL AT  THE
 TIME  WHEN  IT WAS COMMITTED. NOR SHALL IT BE A DEFENSE OR IMMUNITY THAT
 THE  RIGHTS,  PRIVILEGES,  OR IMMUNITIES SECURED BY THE FEDERAL OR STATE
 CONSTITUTION OR LAWS WERE NOT CLEARLY ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME  OF  THEIR
 DEPRIVATION  OR INTERFERENCE OR ATTEMPTED INTERFERENCE BY THE DEFENDANT,
 OR THAT THE STATE OF THE LAW WAS OTHERWISE SUCH THAT THE PUBLIC  OFFICER
