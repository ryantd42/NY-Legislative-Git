 Introduced  by  Sen.  ORTT  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the penal law, in relation  to  reciprocity  for  pistol
  permit applications for military personnel
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 4-b of section 400.00  of  the  penal  law,  as
 added by chapter 371 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  4-b.  Processing  of  license  applications. Applications for licenses
 shall be accepted for processing by the licensing officer at the time of
 presentment. Except upon written notice to  the  applicant  specifically
 stating  the  reasons  for any delay, in each case the licensing officer
 shall act upon any application for a license pursuant  to  this  section
 within  six  months of the date of presentment of such an application to
 the appropriate authority. Such delay may only be  for  good  cause  and
 with  respect  to  the  applicant.  In  acting  upon an application, the
 licensing officer shall either deny the application for reasons  specif-
 ically  and  concisely  stated  in  writing or grant the application and
 issue the license applied for. AN APPLICATION FOR A LICENSE PURSUANT  TO
 THIS  SECTION  FOR  ANY  ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED
 STATES SHALL BE ACTED UPON BY THE LICENSING OFFICER WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF
 THE DATE OF SUBMISSION OF SUCH AN APPLICATION TO THE APPROPRIATE AUTHOR-
 ITY PROVIDED SUCH ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES IS DULY LICENSED  TO
 CARRY  A  PISTOL  OR  FIREARM  BY ANOTHER JURISDICTION WITHIN THE UNITED
 STATES. NOTHING SHALL PROSCRIBE THE ISSUING OF  A  LICENSE  PURSUANT  TO
 THIS  SECTION  SO  LONG  AS THE APPLICANT WHO IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE
 ARMED FORCES, SUBMITS THE  APPROPRIATE  DOCUMENTATION  ACCOMPANYING  THE
 APPLICATION AND SUBMITS PROOF OF A PREVIOUSLY OBTAINED LICENSE ISSUED BY
 ANOTHER STATE.
  §  2.  The penal law is amended by adding a new section 400.15 to read
 as follows:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 4470  2
 
 § 400.15 RECIPROCITY FOR QUALIFIED MILITARY PERSONNEL.
  1.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  OTHER  PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY
 ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES OF  THE  UNITED  STATES  WHO  IS  DULY
 LICENSED TO CARRY A PISTOL OR FIREARM BY ANOTHER JURISDICTION WITHIN THE
 UNITED  STATES  SHALL  BE ALLOWED TO CARRY SUCH PISTOL OR FIREARM WITHIN
 NEW YORK STATE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME NOT TO EXCEED NINETY DAYS,  AND  FOR
 THE  PERIOD  OF  TIME  AN APPLICATION IS PENDING UNDER SECTION 400.00 OF
 THIS ARTICLE.
  2. PERSONS CARRYING A FIREARM UNDER THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THIS  SECTION
 SHALL  BE  REQUIRED  TO: (A) CARRY THE OUT-OF-STATE PERMIT TOGETHER WITH
 VALID MILITARY IDENTIFICATION WHENEVER THE PERSON IS CARRYING THE PISTOL
 OR FIREARM AND (B) DISCLOSE TO ANY  LAW  ENFORCEMENT  OFFICER  THAT  THE
 PERSON  HOLDS  A  VALID  PERMIT AND IS CARRYING A PISTOL OR FIREARM WHEN
 APPROACHED OR ADDRESSED BY THE  OFFICER,  AND  SHALL  DISPLAY  BOTH  THE
 PERMIT  AND THE PROPER MILITARY IDENTIFICATION UPON THE REQUEST OF A LAW
 ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law; provided, however, that section one of this act shall
 take  effect  on  the same date and in the same manner as chapter 371 of
 the laws of 2022, takes effect.
