  LEGISLATIVE  RESOLUTION  celebrating Mother's Day on
  May 14, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, From time to time  this  Legislative  Body  takes  note  of
certain  extraordinary  individuals  it  wishes  to  recognize for their
valued contributions to the success and progress of society and publicly
acknowledge their endeavors which have enhanced the basic humanity among
us all; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to join
with the special women in their  lives  to  celebrate  Mother's  Day  on
Sunday, May 14, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the  early 1900s, Anna Jarvis started a massive letter
writing campaign to newspapers  and  prominent  politicians  urging  the
adoption of a special day honoring motherhood; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Within  six  years  of  its  inception,  Mother's  Day was
declared an official holiday by President Woodrow Wilson on May 9, 1914,
asking Americans to give a public expression of  reverence  to  mothers,
thanking them for the many sacrifices they make for their children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  over a century later, Mother's Day remains the one
day out of the year to praise and pay tribute to mothers, and all  other
women  who  have  taken on that role and acted as a mother figure in the
children's lives, including those being raised in a single parent  home,
whether  it  be  an aunt, stepmother, grandmother, friend or big sister;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  outstanding  women  show  great  strength  and
selflessness,  as  well  as  spend  countless hours offering their love,
support and guidance to the children in  their  lives,  acting  as  role
models and inspiring them to develop to their fullest potential; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is proud to pay tribute and commend
all mothers and mother figures who are worthy of  full  recognition  for
their  valued  contributions  and  who  should  be celebrated by all the
citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
celebrate Mother's Day on May 14, 2023.
