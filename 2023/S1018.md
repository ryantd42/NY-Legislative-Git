  Section  1. Clause (A) of subparagraph (iv) of paragraph (a) of subdi-

 that  information  has not been disclosed under a particular subdivision

 FELONY DEFINED UNDER ARTICLE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE OF THE PENAL LAW OR
 an  offense  defined under article one hundred thirty or sections 230.34

 graph  shall  require  the  disclosure  of physical addresses; provided,
 however, upon a motion and good cause shown the  court  may  direct  the
 disclosure  of  a  physical  address. Information under this subdivision
 relating to the identity of a 911 caller, the victim or witness  of  ANY
 FELONY DEFINED UNDER ARTICLE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE OF THE PENAL LAW OR
 an offense defined under article one hundred thirty or section 230.34 or
 230.34-a  of the penal law, any other victim or witness of a crime where
 the defendant has substantiated affiliation with a  criminal  enterprise
 as defined in subdivision three of section 460.10 of the penal law, or a
 confidential  informant  may  be  withheld,  and redacted from discovery
 materials, without need for a motion pursuant to section 245.70 of  this
 article;  but the prosecution shall notify the defendant in writing that
 such information has not been disclosed, unless the court  rules  other-
 wise for good cause shown.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
