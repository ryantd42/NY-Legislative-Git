  WHEREAS,  The  New  York  State Senate and Assembly have long valued
athletic excellence at the professional, collegiate, and school  levels,
recognizing  exceptional  achievements, outstanding accomplishments, and
national championships; and
 
  WHEREAS, The storied tradition of intercollegiate  athletic  success
at  Hobart and William Smith Colleges has now risen to a new level, with
the Hobart Men's Ice Hockey Team's victory  in  the  NCAA  Division  III
National  Championship  game  in  a  dramatic  3-2 overtime victory over
defending champion Adrian College on Sunday,  March  26,  2023,  at  the
Raymond  J. Bourque Arena, in Beverly, Massachusetts, to secure Hobart's
first National Championship in the history of the program; and
 
  WHEREAS, The achievement follows the building of  one  of  the  most
solid and consistent Division III programs in the country, finishing the
season  with  a 29-2 record, ranked number 1 or 2 in the nation for most
of the 2022-23 season, led by skilled scoring with skaters able to score
goals in close games against challenging  opponents,  and  noted  for  a
stingy defense only allowing 37 goals in their championship run; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Hobart Statesman program has been built by Head Coach
Mark Taylor, who for the past 23 years,  has  brought  together  skilled
collegiate  hockey  players  to  create  a  team balanced by outstanding

get the job done one shift at a time; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hobart Hockey  took  advantage  of  home  ice  in  downtown
Geneva's  fabled  "Cooler"  with  an undefeated 19-0-0 record, the first
undefeated home rink record in the program's history; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fans in  Geneva  and  at  visiting  rinks  were  first-hand
witnesses  to collegiate hockey at its best, and recognized this special
team at every game:  Defensemen:  Lonan  Bulger,  Kevin  Lassman,  Gagik
Malakyan,  Austin  Mourar,  Matthew  Perryman,  Cooper  Swift,  Jared

in the NCAA tournament; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Celebration  and  recognition is shared by the current and
past parents, alumni players, college leadership, and boosters who  have
supported  Hobart  Ice  Hockey  for  decades,  and  we  offer  special
recognition to  former  Athletic  Director  Bill  Stiles  who  made  the
decision  in  1977 to elevate the decades-old Hobart Club Hockey Team to
the NCAA Division III program we honor today; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body  recognizes  and  honors  the  Hobart
Men's  Ice  Hockey  Team  for  this  national  title  and  how they have
represented Hobart and William Smith Colleges, collegiate ice hockey  in
the  Northeast,  and our great State of New York, and for the excitement
and inspiration they have provided hockey players and fans of  all  ages
throughout this exciting and impressive season; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend the Hobart Men's Ice Hockey Team upon the  occasion  of  winning
the NCAA Division III National Championship; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
