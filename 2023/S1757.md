 ENTERPRISE  LISTED ON THE UTILIZATION PLAN. THE MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED
 BUSINESS ENTERPRISE LISTED ON THE ORIGINAL UTILIZATION PLAN AT THE  TIME
 OF  SUBMISSION  SHALL  NOT BE AMENDED OR CHANGED BY THE CONTRACTOR AFTER
 SUBMISSION TO THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR APPROVAL. THE contracting agen-
 cy SHALL BE REQUIRED to notify the PRIME contractor in writing within [a
 period  of  time specified by the director] TEN DAYS as to any deficien-
 cies contained in the contractor's utilization plan[;] AND shall require
 remedy thereof within [a period of time specified by the director; shall
 require the contractor to submit periodic compliance reports relating to
 the operation and implementation of any utilization plan;] SEVEN DAYS OF
 SUCH NOTIFICATION. THE CONTRACTING AGENCY shall not allow any  automatic
 waivers  but  shall  allow  a contractor to apply for a partial or total
 waiver of the minority and women-owned business enterprise participation
 requirements pursuant to subdivisions six and  seven  of  this  section;
 shall  allow a contractor to file a complaint with the director pursuant
 to subdivision eight of this section in the event a  contracting  agency

 in good faith, to utilize such enterprise [at least to the extent  indi-
 cated], UNLESS SUCH ENTERPRISE CANNOT PERFORM UNDER THE CONTRACT OR SUCH

 require  a contractor to indicate, within a utilization plan, what meas-
 ures and procedures he or  she  intends  to  take  to  comply  with  the

  (B-2)  AFTER  RECEIVING  THE  FIRST PAYMENT ON THE CONTRACT, THE PRIME

 ENTERPRISE  FOR  WORK PERFORMED UNDER THE CONTRACT WITHIN TWENTY DAYS OF

 AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE MAY NOTIFY THE CONTRACTING AGENCY OF
 ANY VIOLATION  OF  THIS  PARAGRAPH  BY  THE  PRIME  CONTRACTOR  AND  THE
 CONTRACTING  AGENCY  SHALL  THEN  NOTIFY THE PRIME CONTRACTOR TO CORRECT
 SUCH DEFICIENCY WITHIN TEN DAYS OF  NOTIFICATION.  THE  FAILURE  OF  THE
 CONTRACTOR  TO  MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS TO THE MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSI-
 NESS ENTERPRISE SHALL RESULT IN  DISQUALIFICATION  AND  THE  CONTRACTING
 AGENCY  SHALL RE-AWARD SUCH CONTRACT TO THE NEXT LOWEST BIDDER OR ELIGI-
 BLE BIDDER.

 MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE GOALS.

 PUBLIC  AGENCY  ISSUES  A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, NOTWITHSTANDING WHETHER

 ARY CONTRACT AWARD PROCESS  OR  THE  NON-EXISTENCE  OF  A  DISCRETIONARY
 CONTRACT AWARD PROCESS WITHIN THE PUBLIC AGENCY.

 and shall be deemed repealed therewith.
