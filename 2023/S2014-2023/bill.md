  § 2. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 2 of article 7 of
 the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  §  2. [Annually] BIENNIALLY, on or before the first day of February in

 other ODD NUMBERED years, the governor shall submit to the legislature a
 budget  containing  a  complete plan of expenditures proposed to be made
