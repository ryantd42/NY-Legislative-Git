 Introduced by M. of A. McDONALD -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Governmental Operations
 
 AN  ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to enacting the New York
  State Citizen Experience Act of 2023
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "New York State Citizen Experience Act of 2023"
  § 2. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that the New York state
 government serves the people of the state of New York and should seek to
 continually improve the provision of services based on citizen feedback.
 While many state  agencies,  offices,  and  programs  provide  excellent
 service  to  New  Yorkers,  there  are  many areas ripe for improvement,
 particularly  within  agencies  that  provide  extensive  citizen-facing
 services. Providing quality services to citizens improves the confidence
 of  New  Yorkers  in their government and helps agencies achieve greater
 impact  and  fulfill  their  missions.  Improving  service  to  citizens
 requires agencies to leverage technology, collect and share standardized
 data,  and develop customer-centered mindsets and service strategies. It
 is the legislature's belief that all agencies should strive  to  provide
 high-quality,  courteous, effective, and efficient services to New York-
 ers and seek to measure, collect, report, and utilize  metrics  relating
 to  the  experience of citizens interacting with agencies to continually
 improve provision of services to the people of the state of New York.
  § 3. The executive law is amended by adding a  new  section  171-a  to
 read as follows:
  §  171-A.  COLLECTION OF VOLUNTARY CITIZEN EXPERIENCE FEEDBACK. 1. FOR
