 AND SHALL RETIRE UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF  THE  MANDATORY  RETIREMENT  AGE
 PRESCRIBED  BY  THIS  SECTION,  BY  FILING  AN APPLICATION THEREFOR IN A
 MANNER SIMILAR TO THAT PROVIDED IN SECTION THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY OF THIS

 MENT,  EACH  SUCH MEMBER SHALL RECEIVE A PENSION WHICH, TOGETHER WITH AN

 ALLOWANCE OF ONE-HALF OF HIS OR HER FINAL AVERAGE SALARY.
  2.  UPON COMPLETION OF MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF SUCH SERVICE AND UPON

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  allow  any non-seasonally appointed sworn member or
 officer of the division of law enforcement, a police officer, or  forest
 ranger in the department of environmental conservation, a regional state
 park police officer, or a university police officer to become covered by
 the  provisions of a special 20-year retirement plan, which will provide
 a benefit of one-half of final average salary  upon  retirement  and  an
 additional benefit of one-sixtieth of final average salary for each year
 of creditable service in excess of 20 years, not to exceed 12 years.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $6.0 million in
 the annual contributions of the State of New York for  the  fiscal  year
 ending March 31, 2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the bill-
 ing rates and salary of the affected members change.
 A. 4018  4
 
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $66.7 million which will
 be  borne  by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024. If the State of  New
 York  elects  to  amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for
 the first year including interest would be $8.51 million.
  These estimated costs are based on 1,167 affected members employed  by
 the  State of New York, with annual salary of approximately $133 million
 as of March 31, 2022.
  Summary of relevant resources:
  Membership data as of March 31, 2022 was used in measuring the  impact
 of the proposed change, the same data used in the April 1, 2022 actuari-
 al  valuation.  Distributions  and  other statistics can be found in the
 2022 Report of the Actuary and the 2022 Annual  Comprehensive  Financial

 tions,  and  the  Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York:
