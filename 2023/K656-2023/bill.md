  WHEREAS, June 6, 2023, will mark the 79th Anniversary of the  Allied
assault  at Normandy, France, by troops of the United States, the United
Kingdom and Canada, known as Operation Overlord; and
 
  WHEREAS, The naval phase of  the  Allied  assault  at  Normandy  was
coded,  Operation  Neptune, and the date June 6, 1944, is referred to as
D-Day to denote the day on which the combat attack was initiated; and
 
  WHEREAS, The D-Day landing was the largest combined armed amphibious
assault in history including approximately 132,600 members of the Allied
Expeditionary Force, including 57,500 members of the United States Armed
Forces,  more  than  23,000  airborne  troops  supporting  the  seaborne
landings and more than 14,000 sorties by Allied aircraft; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It consisted of five infantry divisions, two American, two
British, and one Canadian, assigned to beaches code named, from west  to
east Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Americans constituted the United States 1st Army, under
Major  General  Omar  Bradley,  and  the British 2nd Army, under General
Miles Dempsey; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Supreme Commander of  the  Allied  Forces  was  General
Douglas D. Eisenhower; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Of  the approximately 10,000 Allied casualties incurred on

States Armed Forces; and

by  ships, aircraft, and troops from Australia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia,
Free Norway, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the Polish  Armed

  WHEREAS,  The  Normandy  campaign  was  a stunning success; by early

significant event; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body that  when  events
of  such  historical  consequences  are  brought  to our attention, they
should be celebrated and recognized by all its  citizens  of  the  great
State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 79th Anniversary of the D-Day Invasion on June 6,  2023;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
