  It is the purpose of this subtitle to  encourage  [the]  employees  of
 plants that are about to be permanently closed, or relocated, to acquire
 such  plants AND BUSINESSES and to continue to operate them as employee-
 owned enterprises, thereby retaining the jobs that  would  otherwise  be
 lost, and strengthening the economic base of this state.
  §  2.  Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of section 1836-c of the public
 authorities law, as added by chapter 788 of the laws of 1983, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (b) the history and circumstances of  the  plant  OR  BUSINESS  to  be
 acquired;
  § 3. Section 1836-d of the public authorities law, as added by chapter
 788 of the laws of 1983, is amended to read as follows:
  §  1836-d. Loan preferences. In approving applications for loans under
 this subtitle, the authority shall give preference to projects which:
