  §  3.  Administration.  The program shall be administered by the local

 description of the methods for the provision of notice and assistance to
 families  who are eligible for enrollment in the program, and such other
 information as may be required by the office. The office  shall  provide

  § 4. Division of responsibilities. (a) Each eligible family who elects

 supervision of such childcare provider.
  (b) An immediate family member or designated representative may not be

 such relative are consistent with the program requirements.
  (c)  A  childcare  provider  shall  not  be  liable for fulfillment of
 responsibilities agreed to be undertaken by the eligible family.
  § 5. Participating providers. Any agency or individual that meets  the
 qualifications  required  to provide childcare services and who elect to

 fying the authorizing entity of any circumstance  that  may  affect  the
