  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY:  This proposed legislation would allow Tier 3 members of FIRE

 date as a cadet to determine the initial date  of  FIRE  membership  for
 plan  or  tier eligibility purposes provided such purchase of service is
 made within five years of the effective date of this legislation.

  CENSUS DATA: The number of members who will benefit in the future from
 this fiscal note is unknown. The estimates presented herein are based on
 preliminary  census  data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census data
 for the potentially impacted population  used  to  develop  the  average
 costs is summarized below.
  To Tier 2 Within Tier 3
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  3,144  3,913
  - Average Age:  35.9  34.3
  - Average Service:  6.8  5.8
  - Average Salary:  125,500  117,100
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: Currently, the purchase
 of prior NYPD cadet service performed while not a member of the New York
 City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) does not provide  a  retroac-
 tive date of membership in FIRE, nor would it provide additional service
 retirement benefits for Tier 3 members.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  purchased NYPD cadet service would
 entitle members with cadet service before July 1, 2009 to  be  deemed  a
 Tier  2  member, and would be included in the calculation of benefits as
 non-qualifying service credit.
 S. 7128--B  4
 
  Also, purchased NYPD cadet service would entitle  members  with  cadet
 service  between July 1, 2009 and April 1, 2012 to be deemed an original
 Tier 3 member.
  For  cadets  who  did  not  join  NYCERS, the member would have to pay
 member contributions that would have been payable  to  NYCERS  had  they
 joined  on their initial cadet appointment date, plus 5.0% annual inter-
 est.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. Additionally,  1.2  years  of  cadet
 service  was  assumed  based  on  the amount of cadet service previously
 purchased by members of the New York City Police Pension Fund.
  The number of members who will benefit in the future from this  Fiscal
 Note is unknown. The cost of this proposed legislation could vary great-
 ly  depending  on  the number of future members who benefit and on their
 length of service, age, and salary history.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 sky are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy  of
 Actuaries.  We  are  members of NYCERS but do not believe it impairs our
 objectivity and we meet the  Qualification  Standards  of  the  American
 Academy  of  Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
 To the best of our knowledge, the results  contained  herein  have  been
 prepared  in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and
 procedures and with the Actuarial Standards of Practice  issued  by  the

 was  prepared  by  the  Chief  Actuary  for the New York City Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
