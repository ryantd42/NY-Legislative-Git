  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of  this  subdivi-

 of the governing board or body of the city or county, as  the  case  may

  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately; provided,  however,  that

 have taken effect on or before such date then section one  of  this  act
 shall  take effect on the same date and in the same manner as such chap-
 ter of the laws of 2022, takes effect.
