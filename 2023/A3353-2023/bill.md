 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  real  property  actions and proceedings law, in
  relation to establishing the tenant opportunity to purchase act
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "tenant opportunity to purchase act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The  legislature  finds  that  there  is  a
 significant  unmet need for affordable housing for low-income people and
 families. Almost half of all New York State tenants -- in both urban and
 suburban areas -- are rent-burdened. In the Hudson Valley and the South-
 ern Tier, and in non-municipal Green and Suffolk counties, more than 60%
 of New Yorkers are paying over 30% of their income  toward  rent.  More-
 over,  between  2012  and  2017,  New  York State lost more than 160,000
 affordable rental homes, almost 55,000 of them outside of New York City,
 Westchester and Long Island. This has led to an increase in  an  already
 escalating  homelessness  crisis.  According to HUD's 2019 Point in Time
 Estimate, approximately 79,000 people were homeless in New York State.
  The legislature recognizes that New York's rental housing  market  has
 become  even  more  threatened  by  the  outbreak  of novel coronavirus,
 COVID-19, which, as of the date of this  legislation,  created  destabi-
 lized  housing,  loss  of employment and income, closure of business and
 schools and financial insecurity in the state of New York. The  legisla-
 ture finds that the loss of employment, illness and deaths caused by the
 COVID-19  outbreak have rendered many individuals and families unable to
 pay for the costs of housing and other life necessities. U.S.  Census'
 Household  Pulse  survey shows that in the last week of May 2020, 29% of

 all NYS tenants showed little to no confidence in  being  able  to  make
 their June rent payment. The share was higher among Black tenants (41%),
 Latinx tenants (41%) and tenants earning less than $50K (34%).
  The  legislature  finds  that the sudden decline in rent payments as a
 result of COVID-19--particularly on properties overloaded with  debt  --
 coupled  with  the ensuing economic recession will lead to evictions and
 speculation, resulting in the loss of vital and irreplaceable affordable
 housing as well as the decline  in  affordable  community-ownership  and
 home-ownership  opportunities  for  New Yorkers. This was evident in the
 Great Recession of 2008. Before and in the immediate aftermath  of  that
 crisis,  multinational  private  equity  firms had access to capital and
 low-interest rates at a time when many New Yorkers were  losing  employ-
 ment  and  income.  With that uneven access, they were able to enter a
 modest and localized  multi-family  rental  market,  purchasing  100,000
 units in New York City alone, which represented 10% of all rent-regulat-
 ed  housing.  Only  a few years after the crisis, between 2014 and 2017,
 rents for vacant units increased 29.9% above inflation, exacerbating  an
 existing housing and homelessness crisis and displacing tenants in crit-
 ical need of affordable housing.
  The  legislature  further  finds  that  in  order to prevent increased
 displacement of lower-income tenants and preserve New York's  affordable
 housing  market, it is necessary and appropriate to require that, in the
 cases defined herein, owners of rental properties  in  the  State  offer
 tenants  the  first opportunity to purchase and qualified purchasers the
 second opportunity to purchase the property before it may be sold on the
 market to a third-party purchaser.
  The legislature further finds that such action is necessary  in  order
 to  prevent  exactions  of  unjust,  unreasonable  and oppressive rental
 agreements and evictions, and to forestall profiteering, speculation and
 other disruptive practices tending to produce further threats to  public
 health;  that  the normal market of free bargaining between landlord and
 tenant, while still the objective of state policy, must be  administered
 with  due regard for the uncertainty, hardship and dislocation caused by
 the current health, housing and unemployment crises.
  The legislature therefore declares that the provisions of this act are
 necessary and designed to protect the public health, safety and  general
 welfare  of New Yorkers, as well as the economic stability and viability
 of neighborhoods.
