 AN  ACT to acknowledge the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and
  inhumanity of slavery in the City of New York and  the  State  of  New
  York;  to establish the New York State community commission on repara-
  tions remedies, to examine the institution of slavery, subsequently de
  jure and de facto racial and economic discrimination against people of
  African descent, and the impact of these forces on  living  people  of
  African descent and to make determinations regarding compensation; and
  providing for the repeal of such provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "New  York
 State community commission on reparations remedies".
  §  2.  Legislative intent.  Contrary to what many believe, slavery was
 not just a Southern institution. Prior to the American Revolution, there
 were more enslaved Africans in New York City  than  in  any  other  city
 except Charleston, South Carolina. During this period, enslaved Africans
 accounted for 20% of the population of New York and approximately 40% of
 colonial  New  York's households owned enslaved Africans. These enslaved
 Africans were an integral part  of  the  population  which  settled  and
 developed what we now know as the State of New York.
  The  first enslaved Africans arrived in New Amsterdam, a Dutch settle-
 ment established at the southern tip of Manhattan Island,  around  1627.
 These  enslaved  Africans  did not belong to individuals, but worked for
 the Dutch West India Company. The Dutch West India  Company  had  estab-
 lished  Fort  Amsterdam,  a fortification located on the southern tip of
 the Island of Manhattan, for the purpose of defending the company's  fur
 trade  operations  on the North River, now known as the Hudson River. In

 1624, New Amsterdam became a provincial extension of the Dutch  Republic
 and it was designated the capital of the province in 1625.
  These first enslaved Africans cleared forests, prepared land for agri-
 culture  and  built  an  infrastructure of roads, buildings and walls of
 timber and earthwork, including the wall  that  gives  Wall  Street  its
 name. During the following years, more enslaved Africans were brought to
 the New World for the purpose of expanding the settlement.
  New  Amsterdam  came under English control in 1664 and was renamed New
 York in honor of the then Duke of York, in whose name  the  English  had
 captured  it.  Three  years  later, the Dutch gave up their claim of the
 city and the rest of the colony, in  exchange  for  control  of  certain
 trade routes and areas.
  The  change  of control of the city did not hinder the system of slav-
 ery; it was an enormously profitable enterprise and it  continued  under
 English  control.  In fact, the English enacted new slave codes aimed at
 keeping this population repressed. Further, a new class  of  pro-slavery
 business  owners also emerged seeking to, directly and indirectly, bene-
 fit from the slave trade. They supplied food, tools and grain  to  slave
 plantations  in North America and in the West Indies.  Slave labor built
 and maintained ships used for trade between North America,  Europe,  the
 Caribbean  and  Africa.  Enslaved  Africans  produced goods for sale and
 worked in private homes. Even newspapers benefited from slavery:  adver-
 tisements of enslaved Africans for  purchase  were  a  major  source  of
 revenue for the papers during the eighteenth century. With these econom-
 ic  relationships in place, the pro-slavery forces in New York jealously
 guarded what they viewed as their financial interests.
  Life was repressive for enslaved Africans in New York.  The  New  York
 City  Common  Council  passed  a  number of restrictive laws designed at
 curtailing the rights and freedoms of enslaved Africans.  Enslaved Afri-
 cans were barred from owning significant property and  from  bequeathing
 what  they  did  own  to their children. The number of people of African
 descent who could gather in one place was limited. Restrictions on move-
 ment included requiring enslaved Africans to carry lanterns  after  dark
 and to remain in certain geographic areas.
  Penalties  for  breaking  these  and other laws were severe. Beatings,
 mutilations and executions were common.
  Enslaved Africans refused to submit to the slave existence. The condi-
 tions of their lives gave rise to rebellions and the  development  of  a
 network known as the Underground Railroad.
  Moreover, a powerful abolitionist movement developed. Nonetheless, the
 end  of  slavery  in  New York did not come easily or quickly. Those who
 profited from the slave economy fought to maintain the system.
  In 1799, the New York  State  Legislature,  at  a  time  when  sixteen
 sitting  New  York  State  Senators  personally owned dozens of enslaved
 Africans, passed "An Act for the Gradual  Abolition  of  Slavery."  This
 legislation  was  a  first step in the direction of emancipation, but it
 provided little relief in the short-term. Rather, it provided for only a
 gradual manumission. All children born to enslaved women after  July  4,
 1799  would be freed, but only after their most productive years: age 28
 for men and age 25 for women. Enslaved  Africans  already  in  servitude
 before  July  4, 1799 were reclassified as "indentured servants," but in
 reality, remained enslaved Africans for the duration of their lives.
  In 1817, the New York State Legislature enacted a  statute  that  gave
 freedom  to  New York enslaved Africans who had been born before July 4,
 1799. However, this statute did not become effective until July 4, 1827.
 S. 2416  3

  Despite these laws, there were exceptions under which certain  persons
 could  still  own  enslaved Africans. Non-residents could enter New York
 with enslaved Africans for up to nine months, and the law allowed  part-
 time residents to bring their enslaved Africans into the state temporar-
 ily.  The  nine-month  exception  remained law until its repeal in 1841,
 when the North was redefining itself as the "free" region in advance  of
 the Civil War.
  Nevertheless,  many  formerly  enslaved  Africans  fleeing slavery and
 arriving in New York were forced back into slavery following  the  Fugi-
 tive  Slave  Law  of  1850. Moreover, even as the laws regarding slavery
 were loosened, both public and private discrimination continued to main-
 tain similar social relationships and racial hierarchies.
  During the Civil War, sentiments in New York regarding  the  war  were
 divided  and tense. New York's finance and local institutions were still
 deeply entangled in the slave trade in the South and the Caribbean,  and
 New  York  profited  tremendously  from the trade in Southern cotton. By
 some estimates, New York received 40% of U.S. cotton revenue through its
 financial firms, shipping businesses, and insurance companies.
  Near the start of the war,  in  January  1861,  New  York  City  Mayor
 Fernando  Wood  actually suggested to the New York City Council that New
 York secede and declare itself a "free city" in order  to  continue  its
 profitable  cotton  trade  with  the Confederacy. These same pro-slavery
 forces erupted into violence when  the  national  Conscription  Act  was
 enacted on July 11, 1863. Pro-slavery forces engaged in "draft riots" in
 New  York  City,  violently  targeting Black Americans. Before the riots
 were finally stopped by federal troops four days  later,  over  119  New
 Yorkers,  mostly  Black Americans, had been killed. After the end of the
 Civil War, Congress passed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to  offi-
 cially  end slavery, make Black people citizens, and enable Black men to
 enjoy all rights of citizenship including the right  to  vote.  Although
 New  York  had  given  Black  men the right to vote in 1827, it retained
 property requirements, and included new restrictions  on  the  right  to
 vote  for those accused of committing crimes, to continuously maintain a
 system of disenfranchisement. On April 14, 1869, New York  ratified  the
 15th  Amendment  in  a party-line vote. In 1870, however, control of the
 Senate changed to those who were sympathetic to  the  recently  defeated
 South,  with State Senator William "Boss" Tweed leading a charge for New
 York to rescind its ratification of the 15th amendment (i.e., the  right
 to  vote).  New York legislators at the time claimed that allowing Black
 New Yorkers to vote "would introduce ignorance to the ballot box and the
 suffrage would be cheapened  and  degraded".  Along  another  party-line
 vote,  New  York  rescinded its ratification. Fortunately, however, this
 rescission did not prevent the 15th Amendment from being ratified.
  Following the Civil War, conditions for Black Americans  in  New  York
 remained  poor.  Newly  emancipated  enslaved  people and their families
 needed to contend with both public and  private  discrimination  in  the
 State  of New York.  Although civil rights legislation was passed in the
 years following the Civil War, in an attempt to guard  against  acts  of
 discrimination,  Associate Justice Joseph P. Bradley, of New York State,
 wrote a majority (8-1) decision for the  United  States  Supreme  Court,
 striking down these civil rights laws. The case related to an 1879 inci-
 dent, where a Black New Yorker had been turned away from the Grand Opera
 House  located  on West 23rd Street and 8th Avenue; even though this man
 had paid for a ticket, he was turned away, and a local policeman  forci-
 bly  removed  him  from the premises. Although the following lawsuit was
 brought under the civil rights act, Justice Bradley rejected the claims,
 S. 2416  4
 
 stating: "Can the act of a mere individual, the owner of  the  inn,  the
 public  conveyance or place of amusement, refusing the accommodation, be
 justly regarded as imposing any badge of slavery or servitude  upon  the
 applicant...?  After  giving  to  these  questions all the consideration
 which their importance demands, we are forced  to  the  conclusion  that
 such  an  act  of  refusal has nothing to do with slavery or involuntary
 servitude." With this ruling, private citizens were once again permitted
 to lawfully discriminate against their fellow New Yorkers, with no legal
 recourse. A subsequent New York Times editorial, however, stated that it
 did not foresee any substantial changes in daily life because the  civil
 rights  legislation  to  protect  Black  New  Yorkers  "has  never  been
 enforced" in any meaningful way.
  With this legal precedent, expanding even more broadly when  the  1896
 case of Plessy v. Ferguson explicitly permitted segregated railroads and
 street cars, Jim Crow laws, along with various forms of private discrim-
 ination,  spread  across  the  country  and  New York State. Segregation
 became particularly common in both education and housing. In 1883,  when
 a  Black  resident  of  Kings  County sought to enroll her daughter in a
 school for white children, her child was denied admission. In the subse-
 quent lawsuit of People, ex. Rel King v. Gallagher, the Court ruled in a
 4-2 decision that "[t]he system of authorizing the education of the  two
 races  separately  has  been  for  many  years the settled policy of all
 departments of the State government, and it  is  believed  obtains  very
 generally  in  the  States  of the Union." The New York Court of Appeals
 upheld the segregation of schools in Kings  County.  Although  the  laws
 have  changed  in the years since this decision, research has shown that
 up to the present day of this writing, New York still is the most segre-
 gated state for Black students.
  Discrimination in housing has also  been  a  persistent  and  constant
 issue  in  New  York  since  the  Civil  War. In addition to the housing
 inequality that came with wealth inequality, landlords have  engaged  in
 discriminatory  housing  practices.  Black  Americans of all backgrounds
 typically paid disproportionately higher rents,  and  were  forced  into
 dilapidated  tenement  conditions, with the support of public officials.
 This pattern of geographic isolation  would  continue  to  impact  Black
 Americans  in  New  York  continuously  throughout  the years, including
 through the state-sanctioned discriminatory "redlining" practices in the
 1930s, and in the segregationist urban planning implemented by  individ-
 uals  like Robert Moses in later decades. Importantly, the Federal Hous-
 ing Administration (FHA), an institution that refused  to  insure  mort-
 gages in or near African American neighborhoods, subsidized builders who
 were  creating  subdivisions  and  developments in the suburbs, with the
 proviso that none of the homes be sold to African Americans.  For  exam-
 ple,  in  Levittown,  New  York,  the  FHA  guaranteed  bank  loans  for
 construction and development to Levittown on the condition that no homes
 be sold to African-Americans, and that every home have a clause  in  its
 deed prohibiting resale to African-Americans.
  The  consequences  of these past practices are still with us today. In
 1991, a massive African burial ground was discovered in the heart of New
 York's financial district during the construction of a  skyscraper.  The
 excavations  that  followed  the termination of the construction project
 yielded the skeletal remains of 419 Africans, many of  whom  were  women
 and children.
  The  consequences  of  slavery in New York State is not an echo of the
 past, but can still be observed  in  daily  life.  Systemic  racism  has
 cemented  a  legacy  of  generational  poverty,  and  we still see today

 instances of voter suppression, housing discrimination, biased policing,
 food apartheid, and disproportionate rates of incarceration.  Currently,
 in  the United States, the imprisonment rate of Black Americans for drug
 charges is almost six times that of white Americans, despite the rate of
 drug  usage  being  similar  among both groups. Likewise, the use of the
 "Stop and Frisk" tactic by the New York City Police Department  has  had
 disparate  impacts:  at the policy's peak in 2011, an estimated 685,724
 people were stopped, with fifty-three percent of those being Black, even
 though only twenty-six percent of New York City's population was  Black.
 These  policies  have  also  led to the tragic deaths of Black Americans
 here in New York, such as Daniel Prude, who was  unarmed  and  facing  a
 mental  health  crisis  when  he  was  forcibly  restrained by Rochester
 police, and ultimately died due to complications of  asphyxia  resulting
 from his restraint.
  New  York  State's status as an economic and cultural hub of the world
 has been built and shaped by  slavery.  The  contributions  of  enslaved
 Africans has provided the resources upon which trade and commerce in New
 York  was  built.  Some of our most prestigious institutions and infras-
 tructure were built with these contributions. However,  New  York  State
 also  has  the  largest  income disparity in the country, and that large
 disparity is in large part the legacy of our slave system.
  This legislation is necessary because the slavery that  flourished  in
 New  York State constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Afri-
 cans' life, liberty, citizenship rights, cultural heritage,  and  denied
 them  the  fruits  of their own labor. A sufficient inquiry has not been
 made into the effects of the institution of slavery on present day soci-
 ety in New York.
