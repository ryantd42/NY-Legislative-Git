State,  if  the  ingredients  of  shared concern and responsive endeavor

distinguished  citizens  of  the State of New York certain organizations
which warrant special recognition; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to commend  those
illustrious  organizations  of  the  State  of  New York whose focus and
intent have made a substantial impact on the quality of  life  in  their
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Center for Justice Innovation to
be celebrated at an event on Wednesday, May 17, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  this  auspicious  occasion,  25  changemakers, the
connectors, thinkers, and doers at the Center for Court Innovation, will
be honored for their tireless efforts  in  transforming  justice;  their
valuable  work  involves  collaboration  among their three main focuses,
research and evaluation, direct-service programming,  and  training  and
expert assistance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded  in  1998,  the  Center  for  Justice  Innovation,
formerly Center for Court Innovation, remains true  to  its  mission  of
creating  a  more  effective  and  humane  criminal  justice  system  by
performing original research  and  helping  launch  reforms  around  the
world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  vital nonprofit touches on all stages of the justice
system, from  arrest  through  reintegration  into  the  community,  and
strives  to  reduce the need for justice system involvement in the first
place; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Center's primary long-term  goal  is  to  identify  and
resolve  as  early as possible the challenges that bring people into the
criminal and civil legal systems, by investing resources in  underserved
communities,  problem-solving  side-by-side with populations affected by
crime, and building programs that  respond  to  offending  and  increase
safety without imposing lasting harm on individuals or communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Center  for  Justice Innovation is truly committed to
treating each and every individual as a unique person who is  worthy  of
dignity  and  respect, and is actively working with tens of thousands of
community members, leaders, and systems actors across the United  States
to co-create new approaches that reduce reliance on the legal system and
build thriving neighborhoods; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success of Center for Justice Innovation is in direct
correlation to the efforts of its dedicated staff, whose involvement is,
 
and always has been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
