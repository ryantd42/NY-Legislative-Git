Assembly Resolution No. 441
 
BY: M. of A. Miller
 
  RECOGNIZING August 16, 2023, as Brook Trout Day in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to celebrate and
recognize the official fresh-water fish of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
recognize August 16, 2023, as Brook Trout Day in the State of New  York;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  brook trout was initially adopted as New York's state
fish in 1975; the fish was re-adopted as the official state  fresh-water
fish  when  Governor George Pataki signed Senate Bill No. 8153 on August
16, 2006; and
 
  WHEREAS, The beautiful fish with pink or reddish spots are known  to
symbolize  pure,  cold water; hatched in cold water streams, brook trout
move downstream as they mature and in late summer and fall, adults  move
upstream  to spawn in areas where waters flow through gravel and rubble;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Native to a wide area of Eastern North America, brook trout
generally live in small to moderate sized streams, lakes, and ponds  and
are  increasingly  confined  to  higher  elevations  southward  in  the
Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and northwest South  Carolina,
Canada  from  the  Hudson Bay basin east, the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence
system, the Canadian maritime provinces, and the upper Mississippi River
drainage as far west as eastern Iowa; and
 
  WHEREAS, Due to habitat loss and introductions of brown and  rainbow
trout,  brook  trout  are  being  restricted  to  high elevation, remote
streams; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Brook  trout  were  eventually  introduced  to  habitats
throughout the western United States in the late 19th and 20th centuries
by  the  American  Acclimatization  Society  and  by private, state, and
federal fisheries authorities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Acclimatization movements in  Europe,  South  America,  and
Oceania  resulted  in  brook  trout  introductions throughout Europe, in
Argentina, and New Zealand; a significant amount  of  these  established
wild, self-sustaining populations of brook trout in non-native waters to
aid in protecting the species; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Brook  Trout  Day  in  New York State is meant to call for
awareness of and recognition of the importance of the  brook  trout  and
its  preservation  to  New  York's  heritage  and  rich  history;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
recognize  August 16, 2023, as Brook Trout Day in the State of New York;
and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted  to  the  New  York  State  Department  of  Environmental
Conservation (DEC).
