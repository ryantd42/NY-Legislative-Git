 place of business within the state. If the person depositing such  secu-
 rity  money  in a banking organization shall deposit same in an interest
 bearing  account,  he  shall  be  entitled to receive, as administration
 expenses, a sum equivalent to one per cent per annum upon  the  security
 money  so  deposited, which shall be in lieu of all other administrative

 property containing six  or  more  family  dwelling  units,  the  person

 deposit it in an interest bearing  account  in  a  banking  organization
 within the state which account shall earn interest at a rate which shall
 be  the  prevailing rate earned by other such deposits made with banking
 organizations in such area.
  2-b. In the event that a lease terminates other than at the time  that
 a  banking organization in such area regularly pays interest, the person
 depositing such security money shall pay over to his tenant such  inter-
 est  as  he  is  able to collect at the date of such lease termination.]
