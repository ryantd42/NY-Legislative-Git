  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision d of section 504 of the retirement and social

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:

 City  Department  of  Correction (Correction) who are members of the New
 York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) and are subject  to  the
 Early  Service  Retirement  Benefit Plan for General Members pursuant to
 RSSL  Section  504  (CO-25  Plan).  The  CO-25 Plan is limited to Tier 3
 Correction members who joined NYCERS prior to December 19,  1990  (CO-25
 Plan Members).
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: Currently, upon reaching 25 or more years of cred-
 ited  service,  CO-25  Plan Members are entitled to a service retirement
 pension benefit equal to:
  * 50% of Final Average Salary (FAS).
  Under the proposed legislation, if  enacted,  the  service  retirement
 benefit for CO-25 Plan Members who retire for service under RSSL Section
 504(d)  after  the effective date of the proposed legislation with 25 or
 more years of credited service would be equal to:
  * 50% of FAS for the first 25 years of credited service, plus
  * 1/60th of FAS for each additional year of credited service, or frac-
 tion thereof, exceeding 25 years (if any).
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census data and  actu-
 arial  assumptions  and  methods  herein, the enactment of this proposed
 legislation would increase the present value of future employer contrib-
 utions by approximately $4.0 million.
  Under the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the  employer
 contributions  to  NYCERS,  there  would  be an increase in the Unfunded
 Accrued Liability (UAL) of approximately $3.9 million and an increase in
 the Present Value of Future Employer Normal Cost of $0.1 million.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - ANNUAL EMPLOYER  CONTRIBUTIONS:  The  enactment  of
 this  proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in annual
 employer contributions of approximately $4.3 million which is the result
 of an increase in the Normal Cost in addition to the UAL payment.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The remaining working lifetime for this group is approximately two years
 and  the  increase in UAL was therefore amortized over a two-year period
 (one payments under the One-Year Lag  Methodology)  using  level  dollar
 payments.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The  21  NYCERS  CO-25 Plan Members as of June 30, 2022 had an average
 age of approximately 59.9 years, average service of  approximately  33.3
 years, and an average salary of approximately $158,500.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods in effect
 for the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population, and other factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
 A. 6865  3
 
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The initial additional administrative costs of NYCERS and other New
 York City agencies to implement the proposed legislation.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit (OPEB) costs.
