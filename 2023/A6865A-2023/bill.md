  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  19
  - Average Age:  60.6
  - Average Service:  35.0
  - Average Salary:  164,900
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, upon reaching 25 or more years
 of credited service, CO-25  Plan  Members  are  entitled  to  a  service
 retirement pension benefit equal to 50% of Final Average Salary (FAS).
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  CO-25  Plan Members who retire for
 service under RSSL Section  504(d)  after  the  effective  date  of  the
 proposed  legislation with 25 or more years of credited service would be
 equal to 50% of FAS for the first 25 years  of  credited  service,  plus
 1/60th  of FAS for each additional year of credited service, or fraction
 thereof, exceeding 25 years (if any).
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
