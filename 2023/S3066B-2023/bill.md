 § 530.15 TEMPORARY ORDER OF PROTECTION HEARING.
  WHERE  A  COURT HAS ISSUED A TEMPORARY ORDER OF PROTECTION PURSUANT TO
 SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 530.12 OF THIS ARTICLE OR SUBDIVISION ONE  OF
 SECTION  530.13  OF  THIS  ARTICLE, UPON APPLICATION OF A DEFENDANT, THE

 OF  REQUESTING  SUCH  HEARING. NOTICE MUST BE GIVEN BY THE COURT TO BOTH

 PROTECTING  A  DESIGNATED  WITNESS  OR  COMPLAINANT FROM INTIMIDATION OR
 INJURY.
  § 2. Section 530.30 of the criminal procedure law, the section heading
 and subdivisions 1 and 2 as amended by section 17 of part JJJ of chapter
 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
 § 530.30 Order of recognizance, release under non-monetary conditions or
  bail OR ISSUANCE OF A TEMPORARY ORDER OF PROTECTION; by supe-
  rior  court  judge  when  action is pending in local criminal
  court.
  1. When a criminal action is pending in a local criminal court,  other
 than  one  consisting of a superior court judge sitting as such, a judge
 of a superior court holding a term thereof in the county, upon  applica-
 tion  of a defendant, may order recognizance, release under non-monetary
 conditions or, where authorized, bail when such local criminal court:
  (a) Lacks authority to issue such an order, pursuant to  the  relevant
 provisions of section 530.20 of this article; or
  (b) Has denied an application for recognizance, release under non-mon-
 etary conditions or bail; or
  (c) Has fixed bail, where authorized, which is excessive; or
  (d)  Has set a securing order of release under non-monetary conditions
 which are more restrictive  than  necessary  to  reasonably  assure  the
 defendant's return to court.
  In  such  case, such superior court judge may vacate the order of such
 local criminal court and release the defendant on recognizance or  under
 non-monetary  conditions,  or  where  authorized,  fix  bail in a lesser
 amount or in a less burdensome form, whichever are the least restrictive
 alternative and conditions that will reasonably assure  the  defendant's
 return  to  court. The court shall explain its choice of alternative and
 conditions on the record or in writing.
  2. WHEN A CRIMINAL ACTION IS PENDING IN A LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT,  OTHER
 THAN  ONE  CONSISTING OF A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE SITTING AS SUCH, AND THE
 LOCAL CRIMINAL COURT HAS DENIED A REQUEST TO MODIFY OR LIMIT A TEMPORARY
 ORDER OF PROTECTION ISSUED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 530.12
 OF THIS ARTICLE OR SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 530.13  OF  THIS  ARTICLE,
 UPON APPLICATION OF A DEFENDANT, A JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT HOLDING A
 TERM  THEREOF  IN THE COUNTY SHALL REVIEW THE DETERMINATION OF THE LOCAL
 CRIMINAL COURT DE NOVO AND MAY VACATE OR MODIFY THE ORDER OF  THE  LOCAL
 CRIMINAL  COURT.  A  COURT'S  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF
 SECTION 530.15 OF THIS ARTICLE IS REVIEWABLE UNDER THIS SECTION.
  3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one OR  TWO  of  this
 section, when the defendant is charged with a felony in a local criminal
 court,  a superior court judge may not order recognizance, release under
 non-monetary conditions or, where authorized, bail, OR VACATE OR  MODIFY
 A  TEMPORARY  ORDER OF PROTECTION unless and until the district attorney
 has had an opportunity to be heard in the  matter  and  such  judge  and
 counsel for the defendant have been furnished with a report as described
 in  subparagraph  (ii)  of  paragraph  (b) of subdivision two of section
 530.20 of this article.
  [3.] 4. Not more than one application may be  made  pursuant  to  EACH
 SUBDIVISION OF this section.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
