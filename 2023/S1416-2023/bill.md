  Section 1. The opening paragraph of paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of
 subdivision 1 of section 1902 of the public authorities law, as added by
 section  6 of part JJJ of chapter 58 of the laws of 2020, are amended to

 able  for  the development of build-ready sites with a priority given to
 previously developed sites, PROVIDED THAT VIABLE AGRICULTURAL LAND SHALL
 NOT BE DEEMED SUITABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BUILD-READY  SITE.  Such
 assessment  may include but need not be limited to the following consid-
 erations:
  (b) In making such assessment the authority  shall  give  priority  to
 previously  developed  sites,  existing  or  abandoned commercial sites,
 including without limitation brownfields, landfills,  former  commercial
 or  industrial  sites,  dormant  electric generating sites, or otherwise
 underutilized sites, PROVIDED THAT THE  AUTHORITY  SHALL  NOT  DEEM  ANY
 VIABLE  AGRICULTURAL  LAND TO BE AN OTHERWISE UNDERUTILIZED SITE FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION;
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  be  deemed  to
 have been in full force and effect on and after April 3, 2020; provided,
 however,  that  the amendments to section 1902 of the public authorities
 law, made by section one of this act, shall not  affect  the  repeal  of
 such section and shall be deemed to be repealed therewith.
