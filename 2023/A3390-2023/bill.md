  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. New York  State  is  at  a
 very  critical  moment  in  its history. Many recent articles have cited
 information provided by the United States Census Bureau that shows  over
 one  million people have left the New York area since 2010, and this can
 be  attributed  to  the high cost of living forced on New York taxpayers
 through high taxes and a lack of  job  opportunities.  Our  high  taxes,
 particularly  our  high  property  taxes,  have  contributed to New York
 consistently being ranked near the bottom when compared to other  states
 for  business tax climate and total combined tax burden. By doing little
 to reform the structural reasons behind the high cost of living  in  New
 York,  the  state government has failed to make life better for families
 and businesses in every region.
  To compound this problem, New York spends  a  high  amount  on  public
 assistance  programs  that are meant to help citizens escape poverty and
 become self-sufficient, but include income thresholds that  create  what
 are known as "benefit cliffs".  These benefit cliffs occur when an indi-
 vidual  or  family  receiving  public  benefits  hits a specified dollar
 amount in income and immediately loses eligibility to receive a  certain
 public  assistance  benefit.  When this happens, the state is creating a
 situation where New Yorkers would actually see a reduction in real take-
 home pay because the value of the public assistance  benefit  they  will
 lose  is worth more than the increased income they would receive through
 working. This means that low-income New Yorkers,  through  no  fault  of
 their  own,  will  find  it difficult to accept a job, more hours, or an
 increase in pay as the financial well-being of their family  is  threat-
 ened  by  working  more.  Work should be incentivized, and no New Yorker
 should ever be faced with a situation where working hard and  earning  a
 larger salary can actually lead to a decrease in real take-home pay.
  These  problems require state government officials to make hard choic-
 es, and make long-term structural changes in order to see real  systemic
 changes to our economy in the long run. Therefore, the legislature finds
 it  necessary  to implement a ten-year state takeover of the local share
 of Medicaid outside of New York City, create the  Commission  to  Reform
 Public  Assistance  Benefits to implement a new payment method to eradi-
 cate the benefit cliffs, expand the state earned income tax credit  from
 thirty percent to forty-five percent of the federal credit amount, offer
 the option for individuals to receive the state earned income tax credit
 in monthly installments, expand the child and dependent care tax credit,
 assume  the  growth  in  property  taxes  for school districts and local
 governments that remain under the real property  tax  cap  to  take  the
 burden  off of homeowners, create a property tax redesign team that will
 produce recurring savings and subject New York City to the real property
 tax cap.  These structural changes will help make New York more  compet-
 itive, and a more attractive place to build a business and raise a fami-
 ly. They will also provide low-income New Yorkers with additional oppor-
 tunities to better their situation and rise out of poverty.
  §  2. This act enacts into law major components of legislation provid-
 ing for a ten-year state takeover of the local share of Medicaid outside
 of New York City, providing for a twenty-year state  takeover  of  fifty
 percent  of  the  local share of Medicaid in New York City, creating the
 Commission to Reform Public Assistance  Benefits,  expanding  the  state
 earned  income  tax  credit from thirty percent to forty-five percent of
 the federal credit  amount,  offering  the  option  for  individuals  to
 receive  the  state  earned  income  tax credit in monthly installments,
 expanding the child and dependent care tax credit, assuming  the  growth
 in property taxes for school districts and local governments that remain
 A. 3390  3
 
 under  the  real  property tax cap to take the burden off of homeowners,
 creating a property tax redesign  team  required  to  produce  recurring
 savings  and subjecting New York City to the real property tax cap. Each
 component  is  wholly  contained  within  a  Part  identified as Parts A
 through I. The effective date for each  particular  provision  contained
 within  such  Part  is  set  forth in the last section of such Part. Any
 provision in any section contained within a Part, including  the  effec-
 tive date of the Part, which makes reference to a section "of this act",
 when  used in connection with that particular component, shall be deemed

 A. 3390  12
 
 regard to whether the taxpayer in fact claimed  the  credit  under  such
 section  twenty-one  for  such  taxable year). The applicable percentage
 shall be the sum of (i) [twenty] SIXTY-TWO percent and (ii) a multiplier
 multiplied  by  a  fraction.  For  taxable  years  beginning in nineteen
 hundred ninety-six and nineteen hundred ninety-seven, the  numerator  of
 such  fraction  shall be the lesser of (i) four thousand dollars or (ii)
 fourteen thousand dollars less the New York adjusted  gross  income  for

 teen thousand dollars or (ii) thirty thousand dollars less the New  York

 than zero. The denominator of  such  fraction  shall  be  four  thousand
 dollars  for  taxable years beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-six and
 nineteen hundred ninety-seven, thirteen thousand dollars for the taxable
 year beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-eight,  and  fifteen  thousand
 dollars for taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-eight.
 The multiplier shall be ten percent for taxable years beginning in nine-
 teen  hundred  ninety-six,  forty percent for taxable years beginning in
 nineteen hundred ninety-seven, [and] eighty percent  for  taxable  years
 beginning  [after  nineteen  hundred  ninety-seven]  IN NINETEEN HUNDRED
 NINETY-EIGHT, AND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT  PERCENT  FOR  TAXABLE  YEARS
 BEGINNING  AFTER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE. Provided, however, for taxa-
 ble years beginning after nineteen hundred  ninety-nine,  for  a  person
 whose  New  York  adjusted  gross  income  is  less  than forty thousand
 dollars, such applicable percentage shall be equal to  (i)  one  hundred
 percent,  plus (ii) ten percent multiplied by a fraction whose numerator
 shall be the lesser of (i) fifteen thousand dollars or (ii) forty  thou-
 sand  dollars  less  the  New York adjusted gross income for the taxable
 year, provided such numerator shall not be less  than  zero,  and  whose
 denominator  shall  be fifteen thousand dollars.  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, FOR
 TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE,  FOR  A  PERSON
 WHOSE  NEW  YORK  ADJUSTED  GROSS  INCOME  IS  LESS  THAN FORTY THOUSAND
 DOLLARS, SUCH APPLICABLE PERCENTAGE SHALL BE EQUAL TO  (I)  TWO  HUNDRED

 DENOMINATOR  SHALL  BE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. Provided, further, that
 if the reversion event, as defined in this paragraph, occurs, the appli-
 cable percentage shall, for taxable years ending on or after the date on
 which the reversion event occurred, be determined using the rules speci-
 fied in this paragraph applicable to taxable years beginning in nineteen
 hundred ninety-nine.  The  reversion  event  shall  be  deemed  to  have
 occurred  on the date on which federal action, including but not limited
 to, administrative, statutory or regulatory changes, materially  reduces
 or  eliminates  New  York  state's  allocation  of the federal temporary
 A. 3390  13
 
 assistance for needy families block grant,  or  materially  reduces  the
 ability  of  the  state  to spend federal temporary assistance for needy
 families block grant funds for the  credit  for  certain  household  and
 dependent  care  services  necessary  for gainful employment or to apply
 state general fund spending on the  credit  for  certain  household  and
 dependent  care  services  necessary  for  gainful employment toward the
 temporary assistance for  needy  families  block  grant  maintenance  of
 effort  requirement, and the commissioner of the office of temporary and
 disability assistance shall certify  the  date  of  such  event  to  the
