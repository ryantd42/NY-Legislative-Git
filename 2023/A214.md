 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  MAGNARELLI  -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Governmental Operations
 
 AN ACT to amend the state administrative procedure act, in  relation  to
  detailing  the  benefits  and  costs  of  proposed rules in regulatory
  impact statements

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  legislature  finds that many rules of state agencies
 have a substantial impact on the lives  of  the  public,  and  therefore
 should be adopted through a process which provides for open and reasoned
 consideration  of the potential costs and benefits of regulatory action.
 To this end, the statutes governing the  rulemaking  process  should  be
 improved to ensure that agency assessments of the costs and the benefits
 of proposed rules are reasonably accurate and comprehensive.
  §  2.  Paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision 4-a of section 202 of the state
 administrative procedure act, as added by chapter 335  of  the  laws  of
 1992, is amended to read as follows:
  (b)  Each  agency  shall  publish  and make available to the public an
 assessment of public comment for a rule revised pursuant to this  subdi-
 vision. Such assessment shall be based upon any written comments submit-
 ted  to the agency and any comments presented at any public hearing held
 on the proposed rule by the agency. The assessment shall contain: (i)  a
 summary  and  an  analysis of the issues raised and significant alterna-
 tives suggested by any such comments; (ii) a statement  of  the  reasons
 why  any  significant  alternatives were not incorporated into the rule;
 and (iii) a description of any changes made in the rule as a  result  of
 such  comments. IF ANY COMMENTS INCLUDED ESTIMATES OF PROJECTED COSTS OR
 BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RULE TO THE STATE, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS  OR  REGU-
 LATED  OR OTHERWISE AFFECTED PERSONS OR ENTITIES, WHICH DIFFERED SIGNIF-
 ICANTLY FROM THOSE PRESENTED BY THE  AGENCY  IN  ITS  REGULATORY  IMPACT

 STATEMENT,  REGULATORY  FLEXIBILITY  ANALYSIS, OR RURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY
 ANALYSIS, THE ASSESSMENT SHALL ALSO SUMMARIZE THE AGENCY'S ASSESSMENT OF
 SUCH ESTIMATES. COPIES OF COMMENTS WHICH INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF  PROJECTED
 COSTS OR BENEFITS WHICH DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE AGENCY'S ESTIMATES
 SHALL  ACCOMPANY  THE  ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC COMMENT DISTRIBUTED WITH THE
 RULE MAKING NOTICE PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (A)  OF  SUBDIVISION  SIX-A  OF
 THIS  SECTION.  If no comments have been received, the notice of revised
 rule making shall state that no comments were received  by  the  agency.
 Any  subsequent assessment published pursuant to this paragraph or para-
 graph (b) of subdivision five of this section need only include comments
 not addressed in any previously published assessment of  public  comment
 for  the rule; provided, however, that the notice of revised rule making
 or adoption shall contain the date any previous notice of  revised  rule
 making  containing  an assessment of public comment was published in the
 state register.
  § 3. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 5 of section 202 of the state admin-
 istrative procedure act, as amended by chapter 171 of the laws of  1994,
 is amended to read as follows:
  (b)  Except  with  respect to any rule defined in subparagraph (ii) of
 paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section  one  hundred  two  of  this
 chapter,  each  agency shall publish and make available to the public an
 assessment of public comment for a rule adopted pursuant to this  subdi-
 vision or paragraph (e) of subdivision six of this section. Such assess-
 ment  shall  be  based upon any written comments submitted to the agency
 and any comments presented at any public hearing held  on  the  proposed
 rule  by  the agency. The assessment shall contain: (i) a summary and an
 analysis of the issues raised and significant alternatives suggested  by
 any  such  comments, (ii) a statement of the reasons why any significant
 alternatives were not incorporated into the rule and (iii) a description
 of any changes made in the rule as a result of  such  comments.  If  any
 comments  included  estimates  of  projected  costs  OR  BENEFITS of the
 proposed rule to the state, local governments or regulated OR  OTHERWISE
 AFFECTED  persons  OR  ENTITIES, which differed significantly from those
 presented by the agency in its regulatory impact  statement,  regulatory
 flexibility analysis, or rural area flexibility analysis, the assessment
 shall  also summarize the agency's assessment of such estimates.  COPIES
 OF COMMENTS WHICH INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF PROJECTED COSTS OR BENEFITS WHICH
 DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE AGENCY'S  ESTIMATES  SHALL  ACCOMPANY  THE
 ASSESSMENT  OF  PUBLIC  COMMENT  DISTRIBUTED WITH THE RULE MAKING NOTICE
 PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION SIX-A OF THIS  SECTION.  If  no
 comments  have been received, the notice of adoption shall state that no
 comments were received by the agency. Comments submitted or presented to
 the agency by a legislative committee or commission or by  a  member  or
 members of the senate or assembly shall be considered public comment and
 shall be summarized and analyzed in the assessment.
  §  4. Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of subdivision 3 of section 202-a of
 the state administrative procedure act,  paragraph  (b)  as  amended  by
 chapter 229 of the laws of 2000 and paragraphs (c) and (d) as amended by
 chapter 520 of the laws of 1992, are amended to read as follows:
