  Section  1.  Subdivisions  3, 4 and 5 of section 167 of the labor law,

 provider  shall,  before requiring an on-duty employee to remain, make a
 good faith effort to have overtime covered on a voluntary basis, includ-

 floats, or requesting an additional day of work from off-duty employees,

  5. The provisions of this section are intended as a  remedial  measure

 not be construed to diminish or waive any rights of any  nurse  pursuant
 to any other law, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement.

 employer has violated this section, the commissioner shall issue to  the
 employer  an  order directing compliance therewith, which shall describe
 particularly the alleged violation.  A  copy  of  such  order  shall  be
