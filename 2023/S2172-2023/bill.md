 of section 1225-d of the vehicle and traffic law, paragraphs (a) and (b)
 of subdivision 2 as amended by section 8 and subdivision 4 as amended by
 section  10  of part C of chapter 58 of the laws of 2013, are amended to
 read as follows:

 tronic  game,  [or]  portable  computing device, or any other electronic

  (b) "Using" shall mean holding OR WEARING a portable electronic device

 conspicuous manner while operating a motor vehicle or while operating  a
 commercial motor vehicle on a public highway including while temporarily

 such  vehicle  is  not  otherwise prohibited from stopping by law, rule,
 regulation or any lawful order or  direction  of  a  police  officer  is
 presumed  to  be  using  such  device,  except that a person operating a
 commercial  motor  vehicle while using a portable electronic device when
 such vehicle is stopped at the side of, or off, a public  highway  in  a
 location where such vehicle is not otherwise prohibited from stopping by
 law, rule, regulation or any lawful order or direction of a police offi-
 cer  shall  not  be  presumed  to  be using such device. The presumption
 established by this subdivision is rebuttable  by  evidence  tending  to
 show  that  the  operator was not using the device within the meaning of
 this section.
  § 2. Subdivision 2 of section 1225-d of the vehicle and traffic law is
 amended by adding a new paragraph (e) to read as follows:
  (E) "HEAD-MOUNTED" SHALL MEAN WEARING A PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICE  ON

 PORTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, GOOGLE
