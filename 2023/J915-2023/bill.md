  National Caribbean Heritage Month
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize  June  17,  2023,  as  One  Love  Little  Caribbean  Day,  in
conjunction with the observance of National  Caribbean  Heritage  Month;
and
 
  WHEREAS, National Caribbean American Month was formed to honor these
talented  individuals  and  the positive relations the country has built
with the Caribbean; while immigration increased before the 20th century,
it  has  since  declined  gradually;  most  immigrants  are  from  five
countries:  Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad
and Tobago; and
 
  WHEREAS, Brooklyn's Little Caribbean is home to the largest and most
diverse Caribbean-American LatinX community outside of the West  Indies,
and makes up 20 percent of New York City's overall population; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2004,  Claire  A.  Nelson, Ph.D. launched the official
campaign for June as National Caribbean American Heritage Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2005, the House of Representatives passed the  bill  for
recognizing  the  significance  of  Caribbean Americans; a year later, a
proclamation making the Resolution official was signed by the  President
in June 2006; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  June  17, 2023, elected officials, local organizations
and businesses will gather in the section of Brooklyn  known  as  Little
Caribbean  to  designate it as "One Love Little Caribbean Day," complete
with a ribbon cutting ceremony and a tour of the local businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS, In  2017,  caribBEING  spearheaded  the  naming  of  Little
Caribbean  to  recognize,  celebrate,  and  foster  the contributions of
Caribbean-Americans in New York City and the neighborhood  of  Flatbush,
Brooklyn,  as  a  center  for  culture, community and commerce; Brooklyn
Flatbush, Prospect Lefferts Garden, and East  Flatbush  were  officially
dubbed Little Caribbean in 2017; and
 
  WHEREAS,  caribBEING  is  an  inclusive hub for creativity featuring
artists and  makers  from  Cuba,  Guyana,  Haiti,  Guadeloupe,  Grenada,
Jamaica,  Trinidad, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Martinique, France,
Canada, and others; and
 
  WHEREAS, caribBEING is  a  multidisciplinary  venture  dedicated  to
showcasing Caribbean culture, art, and film in Greater New York City and
 
around the world, where art, culture and lifestyle meet global Caribbean
and LatinX heritage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  this  vital  organization  celebrates  and
amplifies  Caribbean  culture  and  lifestyle,  supporting  businesses,
creating community, and documenting as well as creating culture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
recognize  June  17,  2023,  as  One  Love  Little  Caribbean  Day,  in
conjunction with the observance of National  Caribbean  Heritage  Month;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
