 S. 7482  2
 
 OF  AN  ORDER  CONCERNING  WAIVER,  THE DISCLOSURE DOES NOT OPERATE AS A
 WAIVER IN AN ACTION GOVERNED BY THIS CHAPTER IF THE DISCLOSURE:
  1.  WOULD  NOT BE A WAIVER UNDER THIS SECTION IF IT HAD BEEN MADE IN A
 JUDICIAL ACTION GOVERNED BY THIS CHAPTER; OR
  2. IS NOT A WAIVER UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW OF  WHERE  THE  DISCLOSURE
 OCCURRED.
  (D) CONTROLLING EFFECT OF A COURT ORDER. IN AN ACTION GOVERNED BY THIS
 CHAPTER,  A  COURT  MAY  ORDER  THAT  THE PRIVILEGE OR PROTECTION IS NOT
 WAIVED BY DISCLOSURE CONNECTED WITH THE LITIGATION  PENDING  BEFORE  THE
 COURT,  IN  WHICH EVENT THE DISCLOSURE IS ALSO NOT A WAIVER IN ANY OTHER
 ACTION.
  (E) CONTROLLING EFFECT OF A  PARTY  AGREEMENT.  AN  AGREEMENT  ON  THE
 EFFECT  OF  DISCLOSURE  IN  AN ACTION SUBJECT TO THIS CHAPTER IS BINDING
 ONLY ON THE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT, UNLESS IT IS INCORPORATED  INTO  A
 COURT ORDER.
  (F) NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL AFFECT OR ALTER THE LAW WITH RESPECT
 TO  WAIVER  OF  ANY  PRIVILEGE  NOT DESCRIBED IN SUBDIVISION (A) OF THIS
 SECTION OR WAIVER BY MEANS OTHER THAN DISCLOSURE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
