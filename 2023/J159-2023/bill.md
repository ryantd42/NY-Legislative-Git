  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Pan  American  Day  is  a  holiday,  observed  by  several
countries in North and  South  America,  which  commemorates  the  First
International Conference of American States which concluded on April 14,
1890,  creating  the  International  Union  of  American  Republics, the
forerunner to the Organization of American States (OAS); and
 
  WHEREAS, OAS was founded on  April  30,  1948,  with  the  goals  to
strengthen  peace and security, prevent possible causes of difficulties,
seek solution to any political, judicial and  economic  problems,  limit
conventional weapons, promote economic, cultural and social development;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pan  American Day, originally proposed by the organization
in 1930, was  first  observed  on  April  14,  1931;  the  holiday  also
commemorates the diplomatic ties and relations of the United States with
the  other countries of the Western Hemisphere, including Latin America;
and
 
  WHEREAS, In the years since,  these  nations  have  collaborated  to
address  regional  challenges and improve the lives of people across the
Americas; in observance of Pan American  Day  and  during  Pan  American
Week,  the United States reaffirms its hemisphere's enduring friendship,
and recommits to working as  equal  partners  to  support  robust  civil
societies and expand opportunity; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April  14,  2023,  as  Pan
American Day in the State of New York; and be it further
