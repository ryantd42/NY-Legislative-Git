  HONORING  ex-Chief  John  J.  Gayson, Jr. upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  50  years of dedicated service to the Mineola
  Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly  proud  to  honor  ex-Chief
John  J.  Gayson,  Jr.  upon the occasion of his designation for special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated  service  to  the  Mineola  Fire
Department  to  be  celebrated at a party held in his honor on Saturday,
July 8, 2023, at the Stewart Manor Country Club; and
 
  WHEREAS, John J. Gayson, Jr. joined the Engine Company No. 1 of  the
Mineola  Fire Department in 1973; throughout his 50 years of service, he
held several positions within the  Department  including:  Captain  from
1983-1985,  Chief  from  1991-2001, and Chief once again from 2005-2007;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
John  J.  Gayson,  Jr. is one such firefighter; throughout 50 years of
devoted service, this volunteer heroically performed, above  and  beyond
the  call  of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  ex-Chief John J. Gayson, Jr. upon the occasion of his designation
for special recognition after 50  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
Mineola Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to ex-Chief John J. Gayson, Jr.
