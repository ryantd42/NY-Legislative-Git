 Introduced  by Sen. KAVANAGH -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Consumer Protection
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in  relation  to  establishing
  the online consumer protection act
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "online consumer protection act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings.  The  state  has  the authority to enact
 consumer regulations to protect the people of the state.  Recently,  the
 state  has enacted a series of laws to address problems arising from the
 ubiquity of the internet.  From  protecting  consumers  from  electronic
 breaches  of  security  to  enacting  laws  prohibiting  the practice of
 "phishing" -- an electronic form of identity theft -- the state  has  an
 obligation to enact sensible protections for the people.
  The  internet  age  has  changed, often for the better, the way people
 work, enjoy entertainment and interact with one another.  However,  with
 the  internet age new problems have arisen that must be addressed, chief
 among them, the loss of personal privacy. Recent examples, including one
 where search engine results were tracked to an individual,  have  illus-
 trated  that  a  person's  privacy can be breached easily and with grave
 consequences. There is a fundamental rift  between  tracking  technology
 and  consumers'  right  to  control  what data is collected and where it
 goes. Action must be taken in order to prevent more egregious violations
 of  privacy  occurring  including  price  discrimination,  exposure  of
 personal information to subpoenas and warrantless government access.
  This  act  establishes  provisions  to  allow consumers the ability to
 simply opt-out of being monitored on  the  internet.  Such  protections,
 akin  to the do not call registry, are a fair, sensible and common sense
 way to give consumers a clear choice with respect to being monitored.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
