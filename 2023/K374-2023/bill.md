  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Stroke Awareness Month in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, Every 40 seconds someone in the United States experiences a
stroke; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Stroke,  or  brain  attack,  is the fifth leading cause of
death in the United States, killing 147,000 people annually; stroke  can
happen to anyone at anytime, regardless of race, gender, or age; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, about 40 percent of stroke deaths occur in males
and 60 percent in females; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Almost  795,000 people will experience a stroke this year;
about 610,000 are new attacks and 185,000 are recurrent attacks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Stroke is a medical emergency; prompt treatment of a stroke
could mean the difference between life and death, complete recovery  and
disability; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Stroke  is  a leading cause of adult disability; there are
more than seven million stroke survivors  in  the  United  States,  with
two-thirds living with moderate to severe disabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than one-third of Americans cannot identify a single
symptom of stroke, such as sudden trouble talking,  walking  or  seeing;
paralysis,  usually  on one side of the body; and sudden severe headache
with no known cause, even though there  is  now  an  easy  and  F.A.S.T.
(Face, Arms, Speech and Time) stroke recognition system; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Understanding  the  warning  signs and obtaining emergency
treatment can save lives, reduce disability, and possibly  even  reverse
all impacts of the stroke; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  chance  of having a stroke more than doubles for each
decade of life after age 55; while stroke is common among  the  elderly,
many people under 65 also have strokes; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Each year for the past seven years, nearly 42,000 patients
have been treated for strokes  at  hospitals  in  New  York  State;  the
estimated  direct and indirect cost of stroke for 2010 is $73.7 billion;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023, as Stroke
Awareness Month in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance  of National Stroke Awareness Month, and to encourage all New
Yorkers to ask their doctors about stroke  prevention  and  the  warning
signs of stroke; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
