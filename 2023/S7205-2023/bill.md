 AN ACT to amend the penal law, in relation to  the  misappropriation  of
  payroll funds
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. The penal law is amended by adding a new section 165.80  to
 read as follows:
 § 165.80 MISAPPROPRIATION OF PAYROLL FUNDS.
  A PERSON IS GUILTY OF MISAPPROPRIATION OF PAYROLL FUNDS WHEN HE OR SHE
 KNOWS  THAT FUNDS ARE DESIGNATED FOR USE AS EMPLOYEE PAYROLL FUNDS OR AS
 PAYMENT OF PAYROLL TAXES, AND  INTENTIONALLY  PREVENTS  THE  FUNDS  FROM
 BEING  USED  FOR THEIR DESIGNATED PURPOSE.  A DELAYED TRANSFER OF FUNDS,
 IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN A PAYROLL PROCESSING COMPANY AND
 AN EMPLOYER FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING POTENTIALLY  FRAUDULENT  OR
 INCORRECT TRANSACTIONS, SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE MISAPPROPRIATION OF PAYROLL
 FUNDS.  A  PAYROLL  PROCESSING  COMPANY  SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN
 EMPLOYER'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDS.
  MISAPPROPRIATION OF PAYROLL FUNDS IS A CLASS E FELONY.
  § 2. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 2 of section 20.20 of the penal law,
 as amended by chapter 746 of the laws of 2022, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:

 the corporation while acting within the scope of his OR  HER  employment
 and  in  behalf of the corporation, and the offense is (i) a misdemeanor
 or a violation, (ii) one defined by a statute which clearly indicates  a
 legislative  intent  to impose such criminal liability on a corporation,
 (iii) any offense set forth in title twenty-seven of article seventy-one
 of the environmental conservation law, [or] (iv) is  in  relation  to  a
 crime involving the death or injury of a worker, OR (V) MISAPPROPRIATION
 OF PAYROLL FUNDS AS DEFINED IN SECTION 165.80 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
