 OTHER  FUNDS  OR PROPERTY ACTUALLY AVAILABLE TO THE AUTHORITY ARE SUFFI-
 CIENT TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATIONS OF THE AUTHORITY ON  A  SELF-SUSTAINING
 BASIS.  THE OPERATIONS OF THE AUTHORITY SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE ON A SELF-
 SUSTAINING BASIS AS REQUIRED BY THIS TITLE WHEN THE AUTHORITY IS ABLE TO

 subsidiary corporation of the authority or at the time that operation of
 such  transportation  facility  is  commenced  by  the  authority  or is
 commenced under contract, lease or other  arrangement,  including  joint
 service  arrangements,  with  the  authority  may be continued in effect
 without such a hearing. [Such fares, tolls, rentals, rates, charges  and
 other  fees shall be established as may in the judgment of the authority
 be necessary to maintain the combined operations of  the  authority  and
 its  subsidiary  corporations on a self-sustaining basis. The said oper-
 ations shall be deemed to be on a self-sustaining basis as  required  by

 title which the authority shall determine to include in its  certificate
 of incorporation except the power to contract indebtedness.

 construction,  the  authority  is authorized to design, construct, main-
 tain, operate, improve and reconstruct a highway  bridge  crossing  Long
 Island sound, as follows:
  (a)  Upon (i) the enactment by the state of Connecticut of legislation
 having like effect as the provisions of this paragraph and the  granting
 of  the  consent  of the congress of the United States of America to the
 interstate compact thereby created, and (ii) in conformity  with  recom-
 mendations of the New York-Connecticut bi-state bridge study commission,
 the  authority  is  authorized,  in cooperation with any duly designated
 agency or agencies of the state of Connecticut,  to  design,  construct,
 maintain,  operate,  improve  and  reconstruct a highway bridge crossing
 Long Island sound from a point in the vicinity of the city of Bridgeport
 in the state of Connecticut to a point in the vicinity of the village of
 Port Jefferson in the state of New York,  together  with  approaches  to
 such bridge; and to contract from time to time with such agency or agen-
 cies  of  the state of Connecticut with respect to all matters affecting
 these authorizations, including, without limitation, the sharing of  all
 capital,  operational  and  maintenance expense (except that the capital
 expense of the original construction of  such  bridge,  other  than  the
 expense  of acquiring the needed real property, shall be in the ratio of
 fifty per-centum for the authority and fifty per-centum for such  agency
 or  agencies  of  the  state of Connecticut), the manner and by whom the
 work of design, construction, reconstruction,  improvement,  maintenance
 and  operation  is  to be performed or contracted to others for perform-
 ance, the tolls, fees and other charges to be imposed from time to  time
 for the use of such bridge, and the sharing of revenues derived from the
 imposition  of  such  tolls,  fees and charges (except that net revenues
 remaining after deduction of operational and maintenance expense of such
 bridge shall be in the ratio of fifty per-centum for the  authority  and
 fifty  per-centum  for  the  state  of Connecticut or for such agency or
 agencies of the state of Connecticut. Subject to the limitations imposed
 upon the authority by the provisions of the said contracts, that portion
 of the said bridge and its  approaches  situate  and  lying  within  the
 territorial  boundaries  of  the  state  of  New  York shall be deemed a
 "transportation facility" of the authority for all the purposes of  this
 title,  but  tolls,  fees  and other charges imposed for the use of such
 bridge shall not be deemed to have been imposed "for the  transportation
 of  passengers"  within  the  intendment  of  subdivision  three of this
 section.
  (b) If funds are made available by the authority for  the  payment  of
 the  cost  and  expense  of the acquisition thereof, the commissioner of
 transportation of the state of New York, when requested by the  authori-
 ty, may acquire in the name of the state such real property lying within
 the  territorial  boundaries of the state as may be determined from time
 to time by the authority to be necessary,  convenient  or  desirable  to
 carry out the authorizations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
 subdivision,  may  remove  the owner or occupant thereof where necessary
 and obtain possession and, when requested by the authority, may  dispose

 provided in section thirty of the highway law. The authority shall  have
 A. 2196  13

 the  right  to  possess and use for its corporate purposes all such real
 property so acquired, all according to the procedure provided in section
 thirty of the highway law. The authority shall have the right to possess
 and  use  for its corporate purposes all such real property so acquired.
 Claims for the value of the property appropriated and for legal  damages
 caused by any such appropriation shall be adjusted and determined by the
 commissioner  of transportation with the approval of the authority or by
 the court of claims as provided in section thirty of  the  highway  law.
 When a claim has been filed with the court of claims, the claimant shall
 cause  a  copy  of  such  claim  to be served upon the authority and the
 authority shall have the right to be represented and heard  before  such
 court.  All  awards and judgments arising from such claims shall be paid
 out of moneys of the authority.
  (c) The authority, acting independently or jointly or  in  cooperation
 with such agency or agencies of the state of Connecticut, may also apply
 for  and  accept,  upon condition or otherwise, from the duly authorized
 agencies of the federal government, and of the governments of the states
 of Connecticut and New York, such underwater  and  overwater  grants  of
 real  property, licenses or permits as shall be necessary, convenient or
 desirable to carry out the authorizations set forth  in  paragraphs  (a)
 and (b) of this subdivision.
  (d)  The  provisions  of chapter four hundred forty-two of the laws of
 nineteen hundred sixty-five  (and  of  any  agreement  entered  into  in
 pursuance thereof) relating to the repayment of a loan made by the state
 to  the  authority for the purchase of the Long Island railroad shall be
 inapplicable  to  (i)  the  construction  of  such  bridges  and  their
 approaches,  (ii)  bonds,  notes  or  other obligations of the authority
 issued for or in connection with the financing of the  cost  of  design,
 construction and reconstruction of such bridges and their approaches, or
 the  proceeds  realized  upon  such issuance; and (iii) revenues derived
 from the investment of such proceeds or of any part  thereof,  and  from
 the  imposition  of  tolls,  fees  or  other charges for the use of such
 bridges.
  10.] 5. Notwithstanding the provisions  of  any  other  law,  general,
 special or local, or of any agreement entered into in pursuance thereof,
 relating  to  the  repayment of any loan or advance made by the state to
 the authority or to the New York city  transit  authority,  neither  the
 authority  nor  the New York city transit authority shall be required to
 repay any such loan or advance heretofore made from or by reason of  the
 issuance  of bonds or notes of either of them or from the proceeds real-
 ized upon such issuance or from any other funds received  by  either  of
 them  from  any  source  whatever in aid or assistance of the project or
 projects for the financing of which such bonds or notes are issued.
  [11. No project to be constructed upon real property theretofore  used
 for  a  transportation  purpose, or on an insubstantial addition to such
 property contiguous thereto, which will not change in a material respect
 the general character of such prior transportation use, nor any acts  or
 activities  in  connection  with  such  project, shall be subject to the
 provisions of article eight, nineteen, twenty-four or twenty-five of the
 environmental conservation law, or to any local law or ordinance adopted
 pursuant to any such article. Nor shall any acts or activities taken  or
 proposed  to be taken by the authority or by any other person or entity,
 public or private, in connection with the planning, design, acquisition,
 improvement, construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation of a  trans-

 mental impact thereof.
  12. The authority may, upon suitable notice to and an offer to consult
 with  an  officer designated by the city of New York, occupy the streets
 of the city of New York for the purpose of doing any work over or  under
 the  same  in  connection  with  the  improvement,  construction, recon-
 struction or rehabilitation of a  transportation  facility  without  the
 consent of or payment to such city.
  12-a.]  6.  (a) Whenever the authority determines in consultation with
 the city of New York that it is necessary to  obtain  the  temporary  or
 permanent use, occupancy, control or possession of vacant or undeveloped
 or underutilized but replaceable real property, or any interest therein,
 or  subsurface  real  property or any interest therein then owned by the
 city of New York for a project in the two thousand fifteen to two  thou-
 sand  nineteen  or  the  two thousand twenty to two thousand twenty-four
 approved capital programs to (i) install one or more elevators  to  make
 one  or  more  subway stations more accessible, (ii) construct or recon-
 struct an electrical substation  to  increase  available  power  to  the
 subway  system  to expand passenger capacity or reliability, or (iii) in
 connection with the capital project to construct four commuter  railroad
 passengers  stations  in  the borough of the Bronx known as Penn Station
 access, the authority upon approval by the  board  of  the  metropolitan
 transportation  authority  and upon suitable notice and with the consent
 of the city of New York may cause the title to such  real  property,  or
 any interest therein, to be transferred to the authority by adding it to
 the  agreement  of lease dated June first, nineteen hundred fifty-three,
 as amended, renewed  and  supplemented,  authorized  by  section  twelve
 hundred three of this article, or may itself acquire title to such prop-
 erty  from the city of New York, and any such transfer or acquisition of
 real property shall be subject to the provisions of subdivision five  of
 FORMER section twelve hundred sixty-six-c of this title. Nothing in this
 subdivision  shall  be  deemed  to  authorize any temporary or permanent
 transfer or acquisition of real property, or interest therein,  that  is
 dedicated  parkland without separate legislative approval of such alien-
 ation.
  (b) (i) Upon the execution of any transfer or acquisition pursuant  to
 this subdivision, which shall be final upon the approval by the board of
 the metropolitan transportation authority and consent of the city of New
 York,  the  fair market value shall be determined pursuant to this para-
 graph. The authority shall make a written offer to pay to  the  city  of
 New  York  the  fair  market  value  of  the authority's use, occupancy,
 control, possession or acquisition of such property. The  offer  by  the
 authority  shall  be based on an appraisal of the value of such property
 and a copy of such appraisal shall be  included  with  the  offer.  Such
 appraisal  shall  be  done  by an independent New York state licensed or
 certified appraiser, who may not be employed by the authority,  selected
 at  random from a panel of appraisers maintained by it for such purpose.
 Such appraisal and a second appraisal, if required pursuant to  subpara-
 graph  (ii) of this paragraph, shall consider only the reasonably antic-
 ipated lawful use of the property and its zoning designation  under  the
 zoning  resolution  of  the  city  of New York at the time the authority
 notified the city of New York  of  its  determination  to  use,  occupy,
 control, possess or acquire such property.
 A. 2196  15
 
  (ii)  Within thirty days of receipt of the offer by the authority, the
 city of New York may accept it, agree  with  the  authority  on  another
 amount,  or  request a second appraisal by an independent New York state
 licensed or certified appraiser, who may not be employed by the city  of
 New  York,  selected  at  random by the city of New York from a panel of
 appraisers maintained by it for  such  purpose.  Such  second  appraisal
 shall  be completed within thirty days. If the second appraisal produces
 an estimate of the fair market value of the  property  that  is  greater
 than  that  of the first appraisal, the authority shall have ten days to
 increase its offer to such higher amount, otherwise the  two  appraisers
 shall  reconcile  their valuations and agree on a final valuation within
 ten days, which shall be an amount not less than the first appraisal nor
 greater than the second appraisal.
  [(c) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to affect or limit
 the authority's power under subdivision twelve of this section.
  13. The authority and each of its subsidiary corporations shall  place
 on each transformer and substation which contains polychlorinated biphe-
 nyls  (PCBs)  a  symbol so indicating the presence of PCBs. Use of a PCB
 mark illustrated in the rules and regulations  promulgated  pursuant  to
 the  federal  Toxic  Substances  Control Act shall constitute compliance
 with the provisions of this subdivision.
  14. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law or the  terms  of  any
 contract, the authority, in consultation with the Long Island Rail Road,
 shall  establish  and  implement a no fare program for transportation on

 Suffolk,  Suffolk  county  villages  and  towns,  the  division of state
 police, the port authority of New York and New Jersey,  the  Metro-North
 Commuter  Railroad  Company, the New York city housing authority and the
 New York city transit authority. In establishing such program, which has
 as its goal increased protection and improved safety for its  commuters,
 the  authority  and the Long Island Rail Road shall, among other things,
 consider: (a) requiring police officers who ride without cost to  regis-
 ter  with  the  Long  Island  Rail Road as a condition of riding without
 cost; (b) requiring such officers to indicate during  such  registration
 process their regular working hours and the Long Island Rail Road trains
 that  such  officers expect to ride; and (c) periodically re-registering
 and re-validating such officers. The authority and the Long Island  Rail
 Road  shall  also  have the power to consider other matters necessary to
 carry out the goals and objectives of this section.
  15. (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law or  the  terms  of
 any  contract,  the  authority,  in  consultation with the New York city
 transit authority, the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North  Commu-
 ter  Railroad  Company,  shall establish and implement a no fare program
 for transportation on New York city transit authority systems, the  Long
 Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company for indi-
 viduals  serving  as  personal care attendants accompanying an Americans

  (b) In order to be eligible for such no fare program the personal care
 attendant must show his or her community based personal  care  attendant
 agency issued identification card.

 nine of the social services law.
  17.  Notwithstanding any conflicting provisions of general, special or
 local law, and pursuant to the  authority's  2000-2004  capital  program
 plans  approved  by  the  metropolitan  transportation authority capital
 program review board, the authority or any of its subsidiaries, the  New
 York  city  transit  authority or any of its subsidiaries, or Triborough

 provided to such applicant regarding the fact that  state  and  national
 criminal  history  record  checks may be conducted. This provision shall
 not preclude or alter the process by which  a  municipal  civil  service
 commission  obtains  and  provides  background  information  pursuant to

 this [title]  CHAPTER.

 authority: (i) without appropriation pursuant to subdivision one of this
 section,  or (ii) pursuant to the provisions of section ninety-two-ff of

  §  36.  Subdivision 3 of section 1270-c of the public authorities law,
 as amended by section 30 of part O of chapter 61 of the laws of 2000, is
 amended to read as follows:
  3. Moneys in the fund may be [(a) pledged by the authority  to  secure
 and  be  applied to the payment of its bonds, notes or other obligations
 specified by the authority and issued to finance  (i)  transit  projects
 undertaken  for the New York city transit authority and its subsidiaries
 and (ii) transportation facilities undertaken for the authority and  its
 subsidiaries  and (b)] used for payment of operating costs, [and capital
 costs,] including  debt  service,  reserve  requirements,  if  any,  the
 payment of amounts required under bond and note facilities or agreements
 A. 2196  24
 
 related  thereto,  the  payment of federal government loans, security or
 credit arrangements or other agreements related thereto, and the payment
 of all costs related to such obligations, of or for the authority[,  the
 New  York city transit authority and their subsidiaries as the authority
 shall determine]. To the extent moneys in the  fund  have  ALREADY  been
 pledged  by  the  authority PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-
 FOUR to secure and pay its bonds, notes or other obligations [as  herein
 provided],  moneys deposited into the fund shall first be deposited into
 the pledged amounts account to  the  extent  necessary  to  satisfy  the
 requirements of any debt service or reserve requirements, if any, of the
 resolution  authorizing  such  bonds,  notes or other obligations. After
 satisfaction of such requirements of the resolution, or if the authority
 has not so pledged the moneys in the fund, moneys deposited in the  fund
 shall be directly deposited into the operating and capital costs account
 and,  subject  to the provisions of any resolutions of the authority not
 secured by the pledged amounts account, transferred forthwith to or  for
 the benefit of the [New York city transit authority and its subsidiaries
 and the Staten Island rapid transit operating authority] BIG APPLE TRAN-
 SIT  AUTHORITY  (the "[TA] BAT") and to and for the benefit of the [Long
 Island Rail Road company and the Metro-North commuter rail road company]
 COMMUTER TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY (the "[CRR] CTA") as provided in  this
 section.
  Moneys in the operating and capital costs account which were deposited
 in the fund pursuant to appropriation from moneys deposited in the dedi-
 cated  mass  transportation  trust  fund for payment to the metropolitan
 transportation authority dedicated tax fund pursuant to subdivision  (d)
 of  section  three  hundred  one-j  of  the  tax law (the "remaining PBT
 amount") shall be distributed by the authority  as  follows:  an  amount
 equal  to the debt service incurred in such calendar year as a result of
 obligations issued and secured by moneys in the fund, to the extent such
 debt service is to be paid from money deposited in the fund pursuant  to
 appropriation from moneys deposited in the dedicated mass transportation
 trust  fund  for  payment  to  the metropolitan transportation authority
 dedicated tax fund pursuant to subdivision (d) of section three  hundred
 one-j of the tax law ("PBT debt service"), shall be added to the remain-
 ing  PBT  amount.  The  sum  of these figures shall then be allocated as
 follows: eighty-five per centum of such sum shall be  allocated  to  the
 [TA]  BAT  and  fifteen per centum of such sum shall be allocated to the
 [CRR] CTA. The amounts so allocated shall then be  reduced  respectively
 by  the  proportional  amount  of  PBT  debt service attributable to the
 payments for transit projects undertaken for the [TA] BAT and  transpor-
 tation  facility  projects  undertaken  for the [CRR] CTA. The remaining
 amounts shall constitute the  respective  distributable  shares  of  the
 remaining  PBT  amount and shall be distributed to or for the benefit of
 the [TA] BAT and the [CRR] CTA.
  Moneys in the operating and capital costs account which were deposited
 in the fund pursuant to section eighty-eight-a of the state finance  law
 (the  "remaining MMTOA amount") shall be distributed by the authority as
 follows: an amount equal to the debt service incurred in  such  calendar
 year as a result of obligations issued and secured by money in the fund,
 to  the  extent  such debt service is to be paid from money deposited in
 the fund pursuant to section eighty-eight-a of  the  state  finance  law
 ("MMTOA  debt  service"),  shall be added to the remaining MMTOA amount.
 The sum of these figures shall then be allocated as follows: there shall
 be allocated (i) to the [TA] BAT an amount of such sum which  bears  the
 same  proportion  to such sum as the amount appropriated and paid during
 A. 2196  25
 
 such calendar year from the metropolitan mass  transportation  operating
 assistance  account  to  the authority for the operating expenses of the
 [TA] BAT bears to the total amounts so appropriated and paid  from  such
 operating  assistance  account during such calendar year to the [TA] BAT
 and [CRR] CTA combined and (ii) to the [CRR] CTA an amount of  such  sum
 which  bears  the same proportion to such sum as the amount appropriated
 and paid during such calendar year from the metropolitan mass  transpor-
 tation  operating assistance account to the [CRR] CTA bears to the total
 amounts so appropriated and paid from such operating assistance  account
 during  such  calendar  year to the [TA] BAT and [CRR] CTA combined. The
 amounts so allocated shall then be reduced respectively by  the  propor-
 tional  amount  of  MMTOA  debt service attributable to the payments for
 transit projects undertaken for the [TA] BAT and transportation facility
 projects undertaken for the  [CRR]  CTA.  The  remaining  amounts  shall
 constitute  the  respective  distributable shares of the remaining MMTOA
 amount and shall be distributed to or for the benefit of  the  [TA]  BAT
 and  the  [CRR] CTA. In no event shall the authority utilize any measure
 or calculation for determining such distributable shares other than  the
 formula  prescribed herein nor shall the authority take any action which
 would result in the use of such money which is different from or  incon-
 sistent with the use prescribed in this section.
  To  the  extent that amounts described in the preceding two paragraphs
 are distributed more frequently than annually,  each  such  distribution
 shall  be  made  as  nearly as may be practicable in accordance with the
 allocations described above to the [TA] BAT and the  [CRR]  CTA.  Within
 thirty  days  after  the  end of each calendar year, the authority shall
 certify to the director of the budget, the  chairperson  of  the  senate
 finance  committee  and  the  chairperson of the assembly ways and means
 committee, the amount of money deposited in the fund pursuant to  appro-
 priation  from  moneys  deposited  in  the dedicated mass transportation
 trust fund for payment  to  the  metropolitan  transportation  authority
 dedicated  tax fund pursuant to subdivision (d) of section three hundred
 one-j of the tax law and section eighty-eight-a  of  the  state  finance
 law, the amounts expended from the pledged amounts account for the bene-
 fit  of the [TA] BAT and the [CRR] CTA, and the amounts of the remaining
 PBT amount and the remaining MMTOA amount distributed during  the  prior
 calendar  year  to the [TA] BAT and the [CRR] CTA and specifying in each
 case the appropriation or appropriations which was the  source  of  such
 amounts.

  §  1202.  Purposes of the authority.  1. The purposes of the authority
 shall be the acquisition of the transit facilities operated by the board
 of transportation of the city, the operation of  transit  facilities  in
 accordance  with  the  provisions  of this title for the convenience and
 safety of the public on a basis which will enable the operations  there-
 of,  exclusive  of capital costs, to be self-sustaining, and, in coordi-
 nation with the [metropolitan transportation] BIG APPLE TRANSIT authori-
 ty and the Triborough bridge  and  tunnel  authority,  the  continuance,
 further development and improvement of commuter transportation and other
 services  related  thereto within the [metropolitan commuter transporta-
 tion district] CITY OF NEW YORK and the development  and  implementation
 of a unified mass transportation policy for such [district] CITY.
  2.  It  is  hereby  found  and  declared that such purposes are in all
 respects for the benefit of the people of the [state] CITY of  New  York
 A. 2196  34
 
 and  the  authority shall be regarded as performing a governmental func-
 tion in carrying out its corporate purpose and in exercising the  powers
 granted by this title.
  § 4. Subparagraph (ii) of paragraph b of subdivision 1 of section 1203
 of  the public authorities law, as amended by chapter 717 of the laws of
 1967, is amended to read as follows:
  (ii) From and after March first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight,  the
 authority  shall  also  have  the  right  to incur capital costs of such
 nature in its own name to the extent that capital funds are available to
 it for expenditures of such nature pursuant to the provisions of section
 twelve hundred nineteen-a of  this  [chapter]  TITLE  or  of  any  other
 provision  of law, which capital costs shall not be payable by the city;
 provided, however, that no project to be financed by  the  use  of  such
 capital funds which is estimated by the authority to involve an expendi-
 ture  in  excess  of  one  million dollars shall be commenced unless the
 mayor and the [board of estimate] CITY  COUNCIL  shall  each  have  been
 notified  in  writing by the authority of the intent of the authority to
 undertake such project and of the nature thereof. No such project  shall
 be commenced if and to the extent that either the mayor or a majority in
 voting  power  of  the  members  of the [board of estimate] CITY COUNCIL
 shall find that it is incompatible with sound planning for the  develop-
 ment  or redevelopment of the city, provided such finding, together with
 the reasons therefor, is set forth in a writing delivered to the author-
 ity within thirty days of the receipt by the  mayor  or  the  [board  of
 estimate]  CITY  COUNCIL, as the case may be, of the notification of the
 authority relating to such project. If any such project is not so disap-
 proved, it may nevertheless not be commenced unless and until  the  city
 shall  have been given an opportunity to include the same in the capital
 budget of the city for the first fiscal year of the city commencing  not
 less  than six months after receipt of such notification.  If and to the
 extent that such project is included in such capital budget, the author-
 ity may not thereafter incur capital costs for the same in its own name.
 If or to the extent such project is not included in such capital budget,
 the authority may incur capital costs for the same in its own name.  The
 operation  of  sections  twenty,  twenty-one and twenty-two of the rapid
 transit law shall be suspended with respect to any project financed with
 the capital funds referred to in this subparagraph.
  § 5. Paragraph (f) of subdivision 3, paragraph (c)  of  subdivision  5
 and subdivision 8 of section 1203-a of the public authorities law, para-
 graph (f) of subdivision 3 as amended by chapter 791 of the laws of 1962
 and paragraph (c) of subdivision 5 as amended and subdivision 8 as added
 by chapter 717 of the laws of 1967, are amended to read as follows:
  (f)  to  operate omnibus lines on those routes in the city of New York
 where on February twenty-eighth,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-two,  omnibus
 lines  were  operated  under  franchises  or  temporary  certificates of
 convenience and necessity which have been revoked, terminated, rescinded
 or condemned, or acquired by any other means, and to extend such  routes
 so  as  to  provide  the  complete  service operated on February twenty-
 eighth, nineteen hundred sixty-two; and such  operation,  together  with
 the  necessary  extensions, shall be deemed to constitute operation over
 approved routes with the same force and effect as if the said routes had
 been duly approved by the [board of estimate] CITY COUNCIL of the  city,
 as  provided  by law; and to operate on such other routes as the [board]
 COUNCIL may authorize by resolution adopted only after a public  hearing
 held  after  notice thereof, and of the proposed route, and the proposed
 resolutions authorizing the same, have been published  in  full  for  at
 A. 2196  35
 
 least fifteen days, except Sundays and legal holidays, immediately prior
 thereto  in  the  City  Record,  and  at  least  twice in two newspapers
 published in the borough or boroughs affected, to be designated  by  the
 board.
  (c)  capital costs not now charged by the transit authority as operat-
 ing expenses shall be paid by the city; provided, however, that from and
 after March first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, the  subsidiary  corpo-
 ration  shall also have the right to incur capital costs in its own name
 to the extent that capital funds are available to  it  pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of  sections  twelve  hundred  nineteen-a and twelve hundred
 three-b of this [chapter] TITLE or of any other law, which capital costs
 shall not be payable by the city; and provided, further, that no project
 to be financed by the use of such capital funds which  is  estimated  by
 the  subsidiary  corporation  to involve an expenditure in excess of one
 million dollars shall be commenced unless the mayor and  the  [board  of
 estimate]  CITY  COUNCIL shall each have been notified in writing by the
 subsidiary corporation of the intent of the  subsidiary  corporation  to
 undertake  such project and of the nature thereof. No such project shall
 be commenced if and to the extent that either the mayor or a majority in
 voting power of the members of the  [board  of  estimate]  CITY  COUNCIL
 shall  find that it is incompatible with sound planning for the develop-
 ment or redevelopment of the city, provided such finding, together  with
 the reasons therefor, is set forth in a writing delivered to the subsid-
 iary  corporation  within thirty days of the receipt by the mayor or the
 [board of estimate] CITY COUNCIL, as the case may be, of  the  notifica-
 tion  of  the subsidiary corporation relating to such project. Where the
 city is required to pay the capital costs of the subsidiary  corporation
 pursuant  to such agreement, serial bonds or capital notes may be issued
 by the city, pursuant to the local finance  law,  to  finance  any  such
 costs.  The  subsidiary corporation shall submit timely requests for the
 necessary capital funds to the city planning commission and the mayor of
 the city;
  8. From and  after  March  first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight,  no
 substantial  or  general  change in the levels of service furnished upon

 [board of estimate] CITY COUNCIL.

 ties so transferred will be reimbursed, repaid or otherwise provided for
 by  the  end  of  the  next succeeding calendar year if reimbursement or
 repayment is required by law or by any agreement to  which  any  of  the
 affected  affiliated  entities is subject. Any revenues of an affiliated
 entity that are transferred to another affiliated entity, which transfer
 was not authorized by a provision of law other than this section,  shall

 dar year following such transfer.

 tion] BIG APPLE TRANSIT authority or any lessor; and
  (vi) consenting to the extending or assignment  by  the  [metropolitan
 transportation]  BIG  APPLE  TRANSIT  authority  or by any lessor to the
 holders of any of its bonds, notes or lease obligations of  all  of  the
 benefits and rights of the [metropolitan transportation] BIG APPLE TRAN-
 SIT  authority or of such lessor provided by any such agreement or other
 instrument.
  (c) The term "revenues" as used in this subdivision shall include  all
 those  moneys  referred  to  in section twelve hundred of this [article]
 A. 2196  42
 
 TITLE, as well as all operating subsidies provided by any public benefit
 corporation or by any governmental entity, federal, state or local.
  (d)  The  term  "capitalized  value" as used in this subdivision shall
 mean the present value of all future payments required  under  a  lease,
 sublease  and  other such contractual obligation discounted at a rate of
 interest determined on the basis of the net interest cost  of  the  last
 [metropolitan  transportation]  BIG  APPLE  TRANSIT  authority's special
 obligation bonds issued prior  to  the  execution  of  any  such  lease,
 sublease  or other contractual obligation or, if no such bonds have been
 issued, on the basis of the net interest cost of the last  bonds  issued
 by the Triborough bridge and tunnel authority, issued in payment for the
 transfer, lease or sublease of any such transit projects.
  5.  It  is  the intention hereof that, subject to such agreements with
 bondholders or noteholders as may then exist, any pledge of revenues  or
 other  moneys  made  by the authority or its subsidiaries shall be valid
 and binding from the time when the pledge is made; that the revenues  or
 other  moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the authority or its
 subsidiaries shall immediately be subject to the  lien  of  such  pledge
 without  any physical delivery thereof or further act, and that the lien
 of any such pledge shall be valid and binding  as  against  all  parties
 having  claims  of  any  kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the
 authority or its subsidiaries irrespective of whether such parties  have
 notice  thereof. Neither the agreement nor any other instrument by which
 a pledge is created need be recorded.
  6. So long as the authority or any of its subsidiaries shall have  any
 outstanding  and unpaid obligation in connection with a transit project,
 the authority and such subsidiaries shall have the power at all times to
 fix or adjust the rate or rates of fares, fees, rentals or other charges
 to be charged for the use of their transit facilities as  may,  together
 with all other lawfully available moneys, be necessary in their judgment
 to  produce  sufficient  revenues  to  pay  such obligations as the same
 become due, in addition to paying as the same shall become due  expenses
 of  operation  of  the transit facilities and satisfying all other obli-
 gations of the authority and such subsidiaries. No  acts  or  activities
 taken or proposed to be taken by the authority pursuant to this subdivi-
 sion  shall  be  deemed  to  be "actions" for the purposes or within the
 meaning of article eight of the environmental conservation law.
  7. (a) In connection with (i) the  lease  between  the  city  and  the
 authority  dated  June first, nineteen hundred fifty-three, and (ii) the
 lease between the city and the Manhattan and Bronx surface transit oper-
 ating authority dated March twentieth, nineteen hundred sixty-two  (such
 leases,  as  heretofore supplemented, amended or renewed, and the tenan-
 cies originally created thereby, being referred to in  this  section  as
 "the existing leases"), the city, acting either by the mayor alone or by
 resolution  of  the  [board of estimate] CITY COUNCIL, or by instruments
 authorized by such resolution, and the authority are authorized to enter
 into agreements for renewal or extension of the existing leases, or  for
 new leases, for such terms of years and upon such other terms and condi-
 tions as the parties thereto shall agree and the [metropolitan transpor-
 tation]  BIG  APPLE TRANSIT authority shall approve, provided that under
 the terms thereof, the rights, privileges and obligations of the parties
 are not inconsistent with the provisions of, or  in  derogation  of  the
 powers  of  the authority all as provided in THIS title [nine of article
 five of this chapter], and provided further that such  agreements  shall
 in  no way impair the rights or powers of the authority or the Manhattan
 and Bronx surface transit operating authority to fulfill  the  terms  of
 A. 2196  43
 
 any  contract  made  by  either of them with the holders of any of their
 then outstanding bonds or notes, and such agreements shall provide  that
 such  leases  may not be terminated or permitted to expire or be amended
 in  any  way  inconsistent  with  the provisions of any agreement, bond,
 note, lease, sublease or other contractual obligation given or  made  by
 either  of  them  in  connection  with  a  transit  project. Neither the
 provisions of section one hundred ninety-seven-c of the  New  York  city
 charter,  relating  to  a  uniform  land  use  review procedure, nor the
 provisions of any other local law of like or similar import shall  apply
 to  the  renewal or extension of the existing leases or to the making of
 new leases as herein provided.
  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, general,  special
 or  local,  or  the  provisions of the existing leases, if either of the
 agreements authorized by paragraph (a) [above] OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  is
 not entered into, but a note, bond, lease, sublease or other contractual
 obligation  for  a transit project has been issued or entered into, then
 (i) no party to an existing lease may  terminate  the  same,  serve  any
 notice of termination pursuant thereto, exercise any option to terminate
 reserved  therein  or permit the expiration thereof, (ii) the city shall
 not in any way limit or disturb any right of the tenant to use,  occupy,
 control  and possess any of the properties, facilities or revenues which
 are the subject of such existing lease, and (iii)  the  city  shall  not
 seek  to  enforce  such  existing  lease in any way inconsistent with or
 contrary to the manner in which such existing lease  had  been  adminis-
 tered  prior  to  the  enactment of this section or inconsistent with or
 contrary to the interests of the [metropolitan transportation] BIG APPLE
 TRANSIT authority or any  lessor  under  any  agreement,  notes,  bonds,
 lease, sublease or other contractual obligations of the authority or any
 of  its subsidiaries issued or entered into in connection with a transit
 project (and to the extent the provisions of such leases conflict at any
 time or in any manner with the provisions of any such note, bond, lease,
 sublease or other contractual obligation, the provisions of  such  note,
 bond,  lease, sublease or other contractual obligation shall be control-
 ling and conflicting provisions of the leases with  the  city  shall  be
 disregarded),  unless  prior  thereto the city has satisfied all of such
 outstanding notes, bonds or other contractual obligations  and  provided
 for the termination of all such agreements, leases and subleases, all in
 accordance  with  their terms.  If and to the extent moneys are paid by
 the city to the authority or its subsidiaries  to  satisfy  their  obli-
 gations to the [metropolitan transportation] BIG APPLE TRANSIT authority
 under  such instruments, the authority and such subsidiaries shall remit
 such moneys to  the  [metropolitan  transportation]  BIG  APPLE  TRANSIT
 authority,  which shall, in turn, apply the same to the satisfaction and
 termination of its own notes, bonds and leases issued or entered into in
 connection with a transit project in accordance with their terms.
  (c) Upon termination or expiration of a new lease or of a  renewed  or
 extended  existing  lease as permitted in paragraph (a) of this subdivi-
 sion, or upon satisfaction of the requirements of paragraph (b) of  this
 subdivision,  title  to  any  real or personal property (or any interest
 therein) constituting all or any part of a transit project  then  vested
 in  the authority or any of its subsidiaries or the [metropolitan trans-
 portation] BIG APPLE TRANSIT authority pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
 this  chapter  shall  be  transferred  without  further consideration or
 payment to the city.
  8. The state of New York does hereby pledge  to  and  agree  with  the
 authority  and its subsidiaries, THE BIG APPLE TRANSIT AUTHORITY AND ITS
 A. 2196  44
 
 SUBSIDIARIES, and the  metropolitan  transportation  authority  and  the
 holders  of bonds or notes or lease, sublease or other contractual obli-
 gations issued by any of them in connection with a transit project or in
 connection  with  the transfer of the interest of any of them in and the
 lease from the transferee of any property furnished to  it  pursuant  to
 chapter  twelve  of the laws of nineteen hundred seventy-nine or section
 fifteen of chapter three  hundred  fourteen  of  the  laws  of  nineteen
 hundred  eighty-one,  or in connection with any transaction entered into
 pursuant to the authorization of paragraph (b)  of  subdivision  two  of
 this  section,  that  the  state  will  not limit or alter the denial of
 authority under subdivision eleven of this section, or  the  rights  and
 powers  vested  in  the  authority and its subsidiaries by this title to
 fulfill the terms of any agreement made by any  of  them  with  THE  BIG
 APPLE  TRANSIT AUTHORITY OR the metropolitan transportation authority or
 with such holders, or in any way impair their rights and remedies  until
 such agreements, bonds, notes, and obligations, together with the inter-
 est  thereon and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or
 proceedings by or on behalf of THE BIG APPLE TRANSIT  AUTHORITY  OR  the
 metropolitan transportation authority or such holders, are fully met and
 discharged.  The  authority  and its subsidiaries are each authorized to
 include this pledge and the agreement of the state in any agreement with
 the holders of such bonds or notes or lease,  sublease  or  other  obli-
 gations and in any agreement with THE BIG APPLE TRANSIT AUTHORITY OR the
 metropolitan  transportation  authority  relating  to  a transit project
 which may extend the same to the holders of its bonds, notes  and  lease
 obligations.
  9.  The provisions of this section and of all agreements undertaken by
 the authority or any of its subsidiaries in accordance  therewith  shall
 in all respects be subject to the rights of the holders of any outstand-
 ing bonds or notes of the authority and its subsidiaries.
  10.  In  connection  with the negotiation, award and implementation of
 contracts of the authority relating to transit projects, the  provisions
 of  [paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of subdivision] SUBDIVISIONS thir-
 teen AND FOURTEEN  of  section  [twelve  hundred  sixty-six-c]  THIRTEEN
 HUNDRED  FORTY-NINE-J of this article shall apply to the authority as if
 it were the "authority" referred to therein, and the [officer designated
 by the metropolitan transportation authority pursuant to  paragraph  (e)

 MENT, ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE FIFTEEN-A OF  THE  EXECUTIVE  LAW,

 contracts of the authority.
  11. So long as the authority or any of its subsidiaries, THE BIG APPLE
 TRANSIT AUTHORITY, or THE metropolitan transportation  authority,  shall
 have  outstanding any notes, bonds, lease, sublease or other contractual
 obligations authorized  by  this  section  or  section  [twelve  hundred
 sixty-six-c]  THIRTEEN  HUNDRED  FORTY-NINE-J  or [twelve hundred sixty-
 nine] THIRTEEN HUNDRED FORTY-NINE-U of this article, or which have  been
 issued  or  incurred  in connection with the transfer of the interest of
 any of them in and  the  lease  from  the  transferee  of  any  property
 furnished  pursuant  to  chapter  twelve of the laws of nineteen hundred
 seventy-nine or section fifteen of chapter three hundred fourteen of the
 laws of nineteen hundred eighty-one, neither the authority  nor  any  of
 its  subsidiaries  shall have the authority to file a voluntary petition
 under chapter nine of the federal bankruptcy code, or such corresponding
 chapter, chapters, or sections as may, from time to time, be in  effect,
 and  neither  any  public  officer nor any organization, entity or other
 A. 2196  45
 
 person shall authorize the authority or any of its subsidiaries to be or
 become a debtor under said chapter nine or said  corresponding  chapter,
 chapters or sections during any such period.
  12. A project financed by the authority's issuance of its bonds, notes
 or  other  obligations,  pursuant  to subdivision [one-a] TWO of section
 [twelve hundred seven-b] THIRTEEN HUNDRED  FORTY-NINE-U  of  this  title
 shall be deemed to constitute a transit project for the purposes of this
 section and any notes, bonds, lease, sublease or other contractual obli-
 gations  with  respect  to  such  project  shall,  for  purposes of this
 section, be deemed to have been authorized by  this  section;  provided,
 however, that such project shall not be deemed to constitute part of any
 capital  program plan for the purposes of section [twelve hundred sixty-
 nine-b] THIRTEEN HUNDRED FORTY-NINE-V of  this  article  nor  shall  the

  3.  Jurisdiction. The bureau shall have, with respect to acts or inci-
 dents in or on the transit facilities of the authority committed  by  or
 involving  persons who are sixteen years of age or over, or with respect

 [metropolitan  transportation]  BIG APPLE TRANSIT authority or a subsid-
 iary thereof, and with respect to violation  of  toll  collection  regu-
 lations  of  the  [triborough] TRIBOROUGH bridge and tunnel authority as
 A. 2196  46
 
 described in section twenty-nine hundred eighty-five  of  this  chapter,
 non-exclusive  jurisdiction  over violations of: (a) the rules which may
 from time to time be established  by  the  authority  under  subdivision
 five-a of section twelve hundred four of this [chapter] TITLE; (b) arti-
 cle  one hundred thirty-nine of the health code of the city of New York,
 as it may be amended from time to time, relating to  public  transporta-
 tion  facilities; (c) article four of the noise control code of the city
 of New York, as it may be amended from  time  to  time,  insofar  as  it

 CLE.  Matters within the jurisdiction of the bureau except violations of
 the rules and regulations of  the  [triborough]  TRIBOROUGH  bridge  and
 tunnel  authority shall be known for purposes of this section as transit

 from any court now having jurisdiction over any criminal charge or traf-
 fic infraction relating to any act committed in a transit or toll facil-
 ity,  or  to  impair the ability of a police officer to conduct a lawful
 search of a person in a transit facility. The criminal court of the city

 jurisdiction with the environmental control board and the administrative
 tribunal of the department of health over the  aforesaid  provisions  of

 iary thereof, as applicable, except that penalties for violations of the
 health  code  of  the  city  of New York shall be in accordance with the
 penalties established for such violations by the board of health of  the
 city  of New York, and penalties for violations of the noise code of the
 city of New York shall be in accordance with the  penalties  established
 for  such  violations  by law, and civil penalties for violations of the
 rules and regulations of the [triborough] TRIBOROUGH bridge  and  tunnel
 authority shall be in accordance with the penalties established for such
 violations by section twenty-nine hundred eighty-five of this chapter;
  i.  To  accept payment of penalties and to remit same to the authority
 or the [metropolitan transportation] BIG APPLE TRANSIT  authority  or  a
 subsidiary thereof, as applicable; and

 ter 838 of the laws of 1983, is amended to read as follows:

 CITY COUNCIL.
  §  17.  Section  1219-a  of  the public authorities law, as amended by
 section 19 of part O of chapter 61 of the laws of 2000,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  §  1219-a.  Transfer  and receipt of surplus funds. 1. Notwithstanding
 any provision of this title or any  other  provision  of  law,  general,
 special  or  local, the authority may from time to time transfer and pay
 over to THE metropolitan transportation authority, THE BIG APPLE TRANSIT
 AUTHORITY or [triborough] THE TRIBOROUGH bridge and tunnel authority all
 or any part of its surplus funds; and may  accept  and  use  any  moneys
 transferred  and  paid  over  to  it  by THE metropolitan transportation
 authority, THE BIG APPLE TRANSIT AUTHORITY or [triborough]  THE  TRIBOR-
 OUGH bridge and tunnel authority.
  2.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of [the preceding] subdivision ONE
 of this section:
  (a) If the city shall have provided in  its  capital  budget  for  its
 fiscal  year  beginning  July  first,  nineteen  hundred sixty-eight the
 amount of one hundred million dollars, or such lesser  amount  as  shall
 have  been  requested by the authority for inclusion in such budget, for
 the payment of the capital cost of projects requested by  the  authority
 pursuant  to  section  twelve hundred three of this title, then upon the
 written request of the mayor made within thirty days after the commence-
 ment of such fiscal year, [triborough] THE TRIBOROUGH bridge and  tunnel
 authority  shall  transfer  to  the  authority,  by  lump sum payment or
 installments at such time or times and in  such  amounts  as  the  mayor
 shall  elect,  all or such part of the surplus funds of [triborough] THE
 TRIBOROUGH bridge and tunnel authority on hand as of the last day of its
 last fiscal year ending prior to such request as the mayor shall  speci-
 fy,  which funds shall be applied by the authority solely to the payment
 of its expenses of operation. If the city shall  have  provided  in  its
 capital  budget  for  any of its next four fiscal years, commencing with
 the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred  sixty-nine,  the
 amount  of  one  hundred million dollars, or such lesser amount as shall
 have been requested by the authority for inclusion in such  budget,  for
 the  payment  of the capital cost of projects requested by the authority
 pursuant to section twelve hundred three of this title,  then  upon  the
 written request of the mayor made within thirty days after the commence-
 ment  of such fiscal year, [triborough] THE TRIBOROUGH bridge and tunnel
 authority shall transfer to the authority solely for application to  the
 payment  of expenses of operation of the authority the operating surplus
 of [triborough] THE TRIBOROUGH bridge and tunnel authority for its  last
 fiscal  year  ending prior to such request, which transfer shall also be
 by lump sum payment or installments at such time or times  and  in  such
 amounts  as the mayor shall elect. Projects shall be eligible for inclu-
 sion in a computation made hereunder only if included in a capital budg-
 et on the first day of the fiscal  year  for  which  it  is  adopted.  A
 carry-over  project  shall  not  be eligible for inclusion unless it was
 first included in a capital budget by way of an  amendment  thereto,  in
 which  event  it  shall  be eligible for inclusion in a computation made
 hereunder with respect to the first fiscal year of the  city  commencing
 after the adoption of the amendment.
  (b)  Promptly  upon  the  making of the certification of its operating
 surplus, if any, for its fiscal year ending December thirty-first, nine-
 teen hundred seventy-two and for each of its  subsequent  fiscal  years,
 [triborough]  THE  TRIBOROUGH bridge and tunnel authority, at the direc-
 A. 2196  48
 
 tion of [metropolitan transportation] THE BIG APPLE  TRANSIT  authority,
 shall transfer such operating surplus (1) to the [metropolitan transpor-
 tation]  BIG  APPLE TRANSIT authority for deposit into one or more funds
 or accounts to be used as contemplated by section [twelve hundred seven-
 ty-d]  THIRTEEN  HUNDRED  FORTY-NINE-DD  of  this article, or (2) to the
 authority  and  the  [metropolitan  transportation]  BIG  APPLE  TRANSIT
 authority solely for application to the payment of the expenses of oper-
 ation.  [For  purposes of determining the proportional allocation of the
 operating surplus as between the authority and the  metropolitan  trans-
 portation  authority, the following formula shall apply: (i) twenty-four
 million dollars plus fifty percentum of the balance  of  such  operating
 surplus  shall  be  allocable  to  the authority, and (ii) the remainder
 shall be allocable to metropolitan transportation authority on behalf of
 the commuter railroads operated by it, by its subsidiary corporations or
 by others under joint arrangements.]
  (c) THE Triborough bridge and tunnel authority is authorized,  at  the
 direction of the [metropolitan transportation] BIG APPLE TRANSIT author-
 ity,  from time to time to make advances from available funds on account
 of the operating surplus it anticipates will or  may  be  certified  and
 transferred  as  provided  in  this subdivision to (1) the [metropolitan
 transportation] BIG APPLE TRANSIT authority for deposit into one or more
 funds or accounts to be used as contemplated by section [twelve  hundred
 seventy-d]  THIRTEEN  HUNDRED  FORTY-NINE-DD of this article, or (2) the
 authority  and  the  [metropolitan  transportation]  BIG  APPLE  TRANSIT
 authority solely for application to the payment of the expenses of oper-
 ation.  In the event that advances so made in respect of any fiscal year
 including the year in which the surpluses are being  earned  exceed  the
 amounts  required  to  be transferred to the authority and [metropolitan
 transportation]  THE  BIG  APPLE  TRANSIT  authority  pursuant  to  the
 provisions of this subdivision, then the amount of any such excess shall
 be  refunded  to [triborough] THE TRIBOROUGH bridge and tunnel authority
 by the authority or [metropolitan transportation] THE BIG APPLE  TRANSIT
 authority,  as  the  case  may  be,  within thirty days of the making by
 [triborough] THE TRIBOROUGH bridge and tunnel authority of  its  certif-
 ication of operating surplus for such fiscal year.
  (d) For the purposes of this subdivision, the existence and the amount
 of  surplus  funds  and operating surplus of [triborough] THE TRIBOROUGH
 bridge and tunnel authority shall be determined in accordance  with  the
 provisions  of subdivision twelve of section five hundred fifty-three of
 this chapter.
  (e) THE Triborough bridge and tunnel authority shall  certify  to  the
 mayor and to the chairman of [metropolitan transportation] THE BIG APPLE
 TRANSIT  authority  within  ninety days after the end of its fiscal year
 ending December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven,  and  within
 forty-five  days  after  the end of each of its subsequent fiscal years,
 the amount of its operating surplus for that year and, in  the  case  of
 the  fiscal  year  ending December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-
 seven, the amount of all of its surplus funds on hand as of the last day
 of such fiscal year.
  (f) No transfer of funds shall be made to the  authority  pursuant  to
 any  provision  of  this  section at any time when there shall have been
 pending and not acted upon by the mayor for ninety days any  request  of
 the authority for permission to expend or contract to expend funds for a
 project  included  in  a  capital  budget for transit facility purposes.
 There shall be excluded from such  ninety-day  period  any  time  during
 A. 2196  49
 
 which  the mayor is prevented from acting by order of court or by opera-
 tion of law.
  [3.  Notwithstanding  the  preceding subdivisions of this section, for
 purposes of determining the proportional  allocation  of  the  operating
 surplus  of  the  Triborough  bridge  and  tunnel  authority between the
 authority and the metropolitan transportation  authority  the  following
 formula  shall  be used: An amount equal to the debt service incurred in
 such year as a result of the bonds issued to provide facilities pursuant
 to paragraphs (m), (n), (o), (p) and (r) of subdivision nine of  section
 five hundred fifty-three of this chapter shall be added to the operating
 surplus  of  the Triborough bridge and tunnel authority, as certified by
 that authority. The sum of these figures shall then be allocated to  the
 authority  and the commuter railroads operated by metropolitan transpor-
 tation authority or by its  subsidiary  corporations,  pursuant  to  the
 formula contained in paragraph (b) of subdivision two of this section as
 if  this  amount were the operating surplus of the Triborough bridge and
 tunnel authority. The amounts so allocated  to  the  authority  and  the
 commuter  railroads operated by metropolitan transportation authority or
 by its subsidiary corporations, shall then be  reduced  respectively  by
 the  proportional  amount  of the debt service, incurred in such year by
 the Triborough bridge and tunnel authority pursuant to  paragraphs  (m),
 (n),  (o),  (p)  and  (r)  of  subdivision  nine of section five hundred
 fifty-three of this chapter, reasonably attributable to the payments for
 transit projects undertaken for the authority and its  subsidiaries  and
 transportation  facility  projects undertaken for the commuter railroads
 operated by the metropolitan transportation authority or by its  subsid-
 iary corporations. The remaining amounts shall constitute the respective
 allocation of operating surplus for the authority and the commuter rail-
 roads  operated  by  the metropolitan transportation authority or by its
 subsidiary corporations.]

 official duties.
  2.  A majority of the whole number of members of the authority then in

 transportation] BIG APPLE TRANSIT  authority  adopted  pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of  such  subdivision shall be applicable hereto. Such board
 and its corporate existence shall continue only for  a  period  of  five
 years  and  thereafter  until  all its liabilities have been met and its

 liabilities  or  bonds,  notes  or other obligations have otherwise been
 discharged, including bonds, notes or other obligations  issued  by  the
 metropolitan  transportation  authority  that are payable in whole or in
 part by revenues of the authority. When all liabilities incurred by  the

 notes and other obligations have been paid  in  full,  including  bonds,
 notes  or  other  obligations  issued by the metropolitan transportation
 authority that are payable in whole  or  in  part  by  revenues  of  the
 authority, or such liabilities or bonds, notes or other obligations have
 otherwise  been  discharged,  all rights and properties of the authority
 shall pass to and be vested in the city, except those rights and proper-
 ties held by it relating to the convention center which  shall  pass  to
 and be vested in the state. The authority shall retain full jurisdiction
 and  control  over all its projects, with the right and duty, subject to
 the limitations of subdivision nine of section five hundred  fifty-two-a
 of  this  title, to charge tolls and collect revenues therefrom, for the
 benefit of the holders of any of its bonds, notes or  other  obligations
 or  other liabilities, even if not issued or incurred in connection with
 the project. Upon the authority's ceasing to  exist  all  its  remaining
 rights  and  properties  shall pass to the city, except those rights and
 properties held by it relating to the convention center which shall pass
 to the state.

 either the Triborough or Whitestone bridge project shall, however, never
 be  less  than the toll rates charged for the use of the other, and this
 clause shall be deemed an obligation to the holders of any and all bonds
 at any time issued secured by the revenues of said projects. Subject  to
 contracts  with  bondholders,  all tolls and other revenues derived from
 any project shall be applied to the payment of operating, administration
 and other necessary expenses of the  authority  properly  chargeable  to
 such  project  and thereafter to the payment of interest or principal of
 bonds or for making sinking  fund  payments  for  bonds,  not  otherwise
 adequately  provided for, whether issued in connection with such project
 or any other project. It is the intention hereof that surplus funds from
 any project remaining after providing for the payment of all  operating,
 administration  and  other  necessary  expenses of the authority and all
 contract provisions with respect to any bonds, may be used to meet obli-

 such  use  shall, at the discretion of [metropolitan transportation] THE
 BIG APPLE TRANSIT authority, be transferred to [metropolitan transporta-

 the right to construct and/or use the same on such terms  and  for  such
 considerations  as  it shall determine, provided, however, that no lease
 shall be made except with the approval of the [board of estimate of the]
 city COUNCIL, or for a period of more than twenty years  from  the  date
 when it is made;
  14.  To  construct  and maintain facilities for the public, not incon-
 sistent with the use of the project, to contract for such  construction,
 and  to  lease the right to construct and/or use such facilities on such
 terms and for such  considerations  as  it  shall  determine,  provided,
 however,  that  no  lease  shall  be made for a period of more than five
 years from the date when it is made except  with  the  approval  of  the
 [board of estimate of the] city COUNCIL;
  17.  To  do all things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers
 expressly given in this title and  to  assist  and  cooperate  with  the

 ution or resolutions, and prior to the adoption of any  amendment  to  a
 general resolution, whenever adopted, pursuant to which it is authorized
 to  issue  any  general  or  special  obligation bonds or notes for such
 purpose, not including a series resolution or resolutions, the authority
 shall submit a copy of such proposed  resolution  to  the  [metropolitan
 transportation  authority  capital  program  review]  BIG  APPLE TRANSIT

 fifteen  days  of such submission, the board may notify the authority of
 its unanimous approval of the same by the members entitled to vote ther-
 eon, or if the resolution is not approved and no  individual  member  of
 the  board  who  is entitled to vote on such resolution has notified the
 authority in writing of his disapproval, the resolution shall be  deemed

 member  of  the  board  who is entitled to vote thereon has notified the
 authority in writing of his disapproval within such period, the reformu-
 lated resolution shall have been deemed to  have  been  approved.  Any
 individual  member  of  the  board  who  votes against a resolution or a
 reformulated resolution or who notifies the authority of his disapproval
 shall state his reasons therefor. The member appointed on the  recommen-
 dation  of  the  mayor  of the city of New York shall participate in the
 action of the board with respect to  any  resolution  of  the  authority
 submitted  pursuant to this subdivision. The authority shall not adopt a
 resolution or any amendment to a resolution disapproved by the board  as
 herein provided.
  21.  To  invest  any  funds, accounts or other monies not required for
 immediate use or disbursement, at the discretion of  the  authority,  in

 service  on  bonds  and  notes  issued by the authority pursuant to this
 section which is paid or reimbursed from moneys received by the authori-
 ty from the metropolitan  transportation  authority  special  assistance

 nineteen-a  of this chapter.  Such bonds or notes shall be issued in the
 manner provided in section five hundred sixty-one of this title.

 notwithstanding the fact that title to any real or personal property (or
 any interest therein) which is the subject of  or  is  a  part  of  such
 project  is  held by, or upon completion of such project is to be trans-
 ferred to, any such entity, and the provisions of section  five  hundred

 hundred nine of this chapter shall apply to the authority as if it  were
 the "authority" referred to therein.
  (b)  Neither  the  provisions of section one hundred ninety-seven-c of

 then being utilized for a transit or transportation purpose or is not an
 insubstantial addition to such  property  contiguous  thereto;  (a)  the

 community district in which such property is located, data with  respect
 to  the  proposed use of such property and to the design of any facility
 proposed to be constructed  thereon;  (b)  such  community  board  shall
 A. 2196  57
 
 inform  the  [board  of  estimate of the] city COUNCIL of New York, with

 proposing authority, of its views and recommendations with respect ther-
 eto  within  forty-five  days  of  such submission, and if the community

 FORTY-NINE-Q of this chapter, any real  or  personal  property  (or  any
 interest  therein),  which is needed or useful for or in connection with
 such project, the provisions of any lease or other  agreement  with  the
 city to the contrary notwithstanding, and to surrender the use, occupan-
 cy,  control  or  possession of or to transfer the same, or of any other

 authority to pay all or any part of the costs thereof (such undertaking,
 in the case of the New York city transit authority and  its  subsidiary,
 the  Manhattan and Bronx surface transit operating authority, being free
 of any restriction set forth in subparagraph  (ii)  of  paragraph  b  of
 subdivision  one  of section twelve hundred three or in paragraph (c) of
 subdivision five of section twelve hundred three-a of this chapter); and

 AUTHORITY,  ITS  AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN
 NO EVENT SHALL THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS OF BONDS AND NOTES ISSUED PURSUANT
 TO THE AUTHORITY UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION EXCEED ONE BILLION  TWO  HUNDRED
 MILLION  DOLLARS  OR SIXTY PERCENT OF SUCH UNFUNDED PENSION FUND LIABIL-
 ITIES, WHICHEVER IS LESS, AND PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT NO BONDS SHALL  BE

 AUTHORITY MAY NOT ISSUE BONDS OR NOTES IN ANY TWELVE MONTH PERIOD  IN  A
 CUMULATIVE  PRINCIPAL  AMOUNT  IN  EXCESS  OF FORTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL
 AMOUNT PERMITTED TO BE ISSUED UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION. PRIOR TO THE ISSU-
 ANCE OF ANY BONDS OR NOTES, THE AUTHORITY SHALL MAKE A FINDING THAT SUCH
 ISSUE IS EXPECTED TO RESULT, ON A PRESENT VALUE BASIS, IN A LOWER EFFEC-
 TIVE COST TO THE  AUTHORITY  THAN  FUNDING  THE  UNFUNDED  PENSION  FUND
 LIABILITY  SOLELY  THROUGH  THE PAYMENT OF ANNUAL AMOUNTS TO THE PENSION
 FUND, ASSUMING THAT THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF  THE  UNFUNDED  LIABILITY
 WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE SAME NUMBER OF YEARS AS THE TERM OF THE BONDS
 OR  NOTES AND THAT THE INTEREST PAYABLE THEREON IS THE ACTUARIAL RATE OF
 INTEREST DETERMINED BY THE ACTUARY FOR THE PENSION FUND AT THE  TIME  OF
 THE  ISSUANCE  OF SUCH BONDS OR NOTES. THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF
 BONDS AND NOTES ISSUED FOR SUCH PURPOSES MAY BE INCREASED TO FUND  COSTS
 OF ISSUANCE AND REASONABLY REQUIRED DEBT SERVICE OR OTHER RESERVE FUNDS.

 NOTES THERETOFORE ISSUED FOR SUCH PURPOSES; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT UPON
 ANY SUCH REFUNDING OR REPAYMENT, INCLUDING FOR PURPOSE  OF  SUCH  CALCU-
 LATION  THE  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE REFUNDING BONDS OR NOTES THEN TO BE
 ISSUED AND EXCLUDING THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE BONDS OR NOTES SO TO BE
 REFUNDED OR REPAID AND ALSO EXCLUDING ANY AMOUNTS USED TO PAY  COSTS  OF
 ISSUANCE  AND  REASONABLY  REQUIRED DEBT SERVICE OR OTHER RESERVE FUNDS,
 THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE AGGREGATE DEBT  SERVICE  OF  THE  REFUNDING  OR
 REPAYMENT BONDS OR NOTES TO BE ISSUED SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PRESENT VALUE
 OF THE AGGREGATE DEBT SERVICE OF THE BONDS OR NOTES SO TO BE REFUNDED OR
 REPAID.  FOR  PURPOSES  OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, THE PRESENT VALUES OF
 THE AGGREGATE DEBT SERVICE OF THE REFUNDING OR REPAYMENT BONDS OR  NOTES
 AND  OF  THE  AGGREGATE  DEBT  SERVICE  OF  THE  BONDS OR NOTES SO TO BE
 REFUNDED OR REPAID SHALL BE CALCULATED BY UTILIZING THE EFFECTIVE INTER-
 EST RATE OF THE REFUNDING OR REPAYMENT BONDS OR NOTES,  WHICH  SHALL  BE
 THAT  RATE  ARRIVED  AT  BY  DOUBLING  THE  SEMI-ANNUAL  INTEREST  RATE,
 COMPOUNDED  SEMI-ANNUALLY,  NECESSARY  TO  DISCOUNT  THE  DEBT  SERVICE
 PAYMENTS  ON  THE REFUNDING OR REPAYMENT BONDS OR NOTES FROM THE PAYMENT
 DATES THEREOF TO THE DATE OF ISSUE OF THE REFUNDING OR  REPAYMENT  BONDS
 OR  NOTES  AND  TO THE PRICE BID INCLUDING ESTIMATED ACCRUED INTEREST OR
 PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY THE AUTHORITY INCLUDING ESTIMATED ACCRUED  INTEREST
 FROM  THE  SALE  THEREOF.  DEBT  SERVICE  ON THE BONDS OR NOTES SHALL BE
 STRUCTURED SO THAT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS  THEREOF  SHALL  BE  RELATIVELY
 UNIFORM  FOR  EACH  FULL YEAR THROUGHOUT THE TERM OF THE BONDS OR NOTES.
 BEGINNING WITH THE DATE OF FIRST ISSUANCE OF BONDS UNDER  THIS  SECTION,
 THE  AUTHORITY  AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES SHALL MAKE ANNUAL PAYMENTS INTO THE
 PENSION FUND IN AMOUNTS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE CURRENT  PENSION  CONTRIB-
 UTION  LIABILITY  APPLICABLE TO SUCH YEAR. THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE BONDS
 OR NOTES INTENDED TO BE INVESTED IN NON-DEBT SECURITIES MAY BE  INVESTED
 BY THE RECIPIENT PENSION FUND IN A FISCALLY PRUDENT MANNER IN SECURITIES
 CONSISTENT WITH ANY TRUST INDENTURES AND ALL APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDER-
 AL  LAW  OVER  A  REASONABLE  PERIOD  OF  TIME NOT LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS
 FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF THE  BONDS  OR  NOTES.  THE  OPERATING  BUDGET
 SAVINGS  ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUANCE OF PENSION OBLIGATION BONDS PURSU-
 ANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE DEDICATED TO  REDUCING  SERVICE  ELIMI-
 NATIONS PROJECTED TO OCCUR WITHIN THAT PERIOD.

  (F)  THE  AUTHORITY  DETERMINES  THAT  IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO
 AWARD CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO  A  PROCESS  FOR  COMPETITIVE  REQUESTS  FOR

  § 1349-ZZZZZ. RIGHT TO SHARE EMPLOYEES. 1.  IT  IS  HEREBY  FOUND  AND
 DECLARED  TO  BE  NECESSARY  AND  PROPER TO AUTHORIZE THE AUTHORITY, ITS
 SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND  SUBSIDIARIES  OF  AFFILIATES,  POWERS  TO
 EFFECTUATE AND ENSURE SUCH ENTITIES CONTINUED FINANCIAL VIABILITY, WHICH
 IS  AT  ISSUE  GIVEN  SIZABLE OPERATING DEFICITS AND SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL
 NEEDS.  ALLOWING  WHOLESALE  INTERNAL  MANAGEMENT  REFORMS  WILL  CREATE
 SAVINGS,  COMBAT  ENTRENCHED BUREAUCRACIES, CREATE STREAMLINED, UNIFORM,
 AND EFFICIENT SERVICES, ENSURE  PUBLIC  ACCOUNTABILITY  AND  REESTABLISH
 PUBLIC  TRUST.  IN  ORDER TO FACILITATE THESE NECESSARY GOALS IT IS BOTH
 REASONABLE AND A LEGITIMATE PUBLIC PURPOSE TO PROVIDE SYSTEMATIC AUTHOR-
 ITY FOR THE SHARING OF EMPLOYEES WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE ENTI-
 TIES.
  2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, THE  AUTHORI-
 TY,  ITS  SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND SUBSIDIARIES OF AFFILIATES SHALL
 EACH HAVE THE RIGHT TO SHARE EMPLOYEES WITHIN AND BETWEEN SUCH  ENTITIES
 AND  TO  ASSIGN  SUCH  EMPLOYEES  TO  PERFORM  ANY OPERATION OR FUNCTION
 SUBJECT ONLY TO A DETERMINATION THAT THEY ARE SUBSTANTIALLY  SIMILAR  TO
 ANY  OPERATION  OR  FUNCTION  CURRENTLY PERFORMED. SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR
 OPERATION OR FUNCTION SHALL BE DETERMINED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE AUTHORITY.
  3. NOTHING SET FORTH IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO IMPEDE,
 INFRINGE OR DIMINISH THE RIGHTS AND BENEFITS THAT  ACCRUE  TO  EMPLOYEES
 AND  EMPLOYERS  THROUGH  COLLECTIVE  BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, OR IMPACT OR
 CHANGE AN EMPLOYEE'S MEMBERSHIP IN A BARGAINING UNIT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect January 1, 2024.
  § 2. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivi-
 sion, section or part of this act shall be  adjudged  by  any  court  of
 competent  jurisdiction  to  be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,
 impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall  be  confined  in
 its  operation  to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the legislature that this act would  have  been  enacted  even  if  such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect immediately provided, however, that
 the applicable effective date of Parts A through E of this act shall  be
 as specifically set forth in the last section of such Parts.
