 Introduced  by  Sen.  STEWART-COUSINS -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Rules
 
 AN ACT to amend a chapter of the laws of 2022 amending the environmental
  conservation law relating to the location of environmental facilities,
  as proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 8830  and  A.  2103-D,  in
  relation to the legislative intent of such chapter, and in relation to
  the effectiveness thereof; and to amend the environmental conservation
  law, in relation to disproportionate impacts of environmental facility
  siting  on  disadvantaged  communities;  and  relating to the scope of
  certain provisions of  the  environmental  conservation  law  and  the
  authority of the commissioner of environmental conservation thereunder
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 1 of a chapter of the laws  of  2022  amending  the
 environmental conservation law relating to the location of environmental
 facilities,  as  proposed  in  legislative  bills numbers S. 8830 and A.
 2103-D, is amended to read as follows:
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds and declares that
 each community in the state should equitably share the responsibilities,
 burdens, and benefits  of  managing  and  solving  ENVIRONMENTAL  HEALTH
 ISSUES  AND the state's environmental problems and the facilities neces-
 sary to accomplish such ends.  The  legislature  further  declares  that
 there  has  been  an  inequitable pattern in the siting of environmental
 facilities in minority and economically  distressed  communities,  which
 have  borne a disproportionate and inequitable share of such facilities.
 AS A RESULT OF THE INEQUITABLE PATTERN IN THE  SITING  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL
 FACILITIES,  MINORITY  AND  ECONOMICALLY  DISTRESSED  COMMUNITIES BEAR A
 GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH BURDEN  DUE  TO  THE  CUMULATIVE  POLLUTION
 EXPOSURE  FROM  MULTIPLE  FACILITIES.  Consistent with its commitment to
 providing equal justice for its citizens, the state has a responsibility
 to establish requirements for the consideration  of  such  decisions  by
 state  and  local governments in order to [insure equality of treatment]
 ENSURE NO COMMUNITY BEARS A DISPROPORTIONATE POLLUTION  BURDEN,  AND  TO
 ACTIVELY REDUCE ANY SUCH BURDEN for all communities.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 DEPARTMENT.
  5.  THE  DEPARTMENT,  IN  CONSULTATION  WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH,
