  WHEREAS,  It  is  the intent of this Legislative Body to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 14-20, 2023, as Police Week in the
State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National Police
Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, This observance is to recognize National Police  Week  2023
and to honor the service and sacrifice of those law enforcement officers
killed  in  the  line  of  duty  while  protecting  our  communities and
safe-guarding our democracy; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1962, President Kennedy proclaimed May 15th as  National
Peace  Officers  Memorial  Day  and  the calendar week in which May 15th
falls, as National Police Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Established by a joint  resolution  of  Congress  in  1962,
National  Police  Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement
officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty  for  the  safety
and protection of others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There are roughly 900,000 law enforcement officers serving
in communities across the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Nearly 60,000 assaults against law enforcement officers are
reported each year, resulting in approximately 16,000 injuries; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since the first recorded death in 1791,  more  than  20,000
law  enforcement  officers  in  the United States have made the ultimate
sacrifice and been killed in the line of duty; and
 
  WHEREAS, The names of these dedicated public servants  are  engraved
on  the  walls  of  the  National  Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial in
Washington, D.C.; and
 
  WHEREAS, New names of fallen heroes are continuously  added  to  the
National  Law  Enforcement  Officers  Memorial  each year, including 135
officers killed in 2016; this is a 10 percent increase over the 123  who
died  in  the line of duty in 2015, and is the highest total since 2011,
when 177 officers made the ultimate sacrifice; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, in 2017, 186 officers were killed in the  line
of  duty,  with  187  officers  killed in the line of duty the following
year; 155 officers were killed in the line of duty in 2019, 385 officers
were killed in the line of duty in 2020,  an  astonishing  479  officers
were killed in the line of duty in 2021, and 226 officers were killed in
the line of duty in 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  service  and  sacrifice of all officers killed in the
line of duty  will  be  honored  during  the  National  Law  Enforcement
Officers  Memorial  Fund's  35th  Annual  Candlelight Vigil, and May 15,
 
2023, is designated as Peace Officers Memorial  Day,  in  honor  of  all
fallen officers and their families; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense of this Legislative Body to commend the
long-standing efforts of law enforcement in the State of  New  York  who
diligently contribute to the efficient operation of our criminal justice
system; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be  done  to  eradicate  the  assault,
injury  and  death of our valued police officers at the local, State and
national levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 14-20, 2023, as Police
Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund; the Concerns
of Police Survivors; and the Fraternal Order of Police.
