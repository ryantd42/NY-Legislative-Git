 Introduced  by  M. of A. COLTON -- Multi-Sponsored by -- M. of A. RIVERA
  -- read once and referred to the Committee on Environmental  Conserva-
  tion
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to the
  reduction and recycling of packaging
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "environmentally sound packaging act".
  § 2. Legislative findings  and  declaration.  The  legislature  hereby
 finds  and  declares that a solid waste crisis exists in New York state,
 and that the amount of solid waste requiring disposal has  continued  to
 increase.  The  legislature  further  finds  that over thirty percent of
 municipal solid waste is comprised of packaging, that the production  of
 packaging  has more than doubled in the last twenty years, and that this
 portion of the municipal  solid  waste  stream  could  be  significantly
 reduced  through  source  reduction and material changes to increase the
 reusability, recycled content, and recyclability of such packaging.  The
 legislature  further finds that the reduction of packaging waste and the
 success of municipal recycling is dependent on greatly increasing demand
 for post-consumer materials  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  that  this
 demand  is very limited at present, and attributable to a lack of incen-
 tives for manufacturers to increase the reusability, recycled content or
 recyclability of their packaging, with no  federal  or  state  standards
 applied  to  packaging  based  on  such  attributes or the lack of same.
 Therefore, the legislature finds and determines that there is a need  to
 reduce  packaging in the solid waste stream, by requiring that all pack-
 aging sold in New York state meet certain standards for reduction, reus-
 ability, recycled content, or recyclability.
  § 3. The environmental conservation law is amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 27-0721 to read as follows:

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
