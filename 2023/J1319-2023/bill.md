  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  November 6-10, 2023, as National  School  Psychology
  Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness  of  issues  that
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim November 6-10, 2023, as
National School Psychology Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, This National School Psychology Week comes  as  New  York's
youth grapple with mental health conditions at unprecedented rates; with
students needing more support than ever, school psychologists are at the
front line of this crisis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
(CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System,  feelings  of  persistent
sadness  and  hopelessness-as  well  as  suicidal  thoughts  and
behaviors-increased by about 40 percent among young  people  in  the  10
years leading up to the pandemic; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  CDC also reports that during the pandemic, 29 percent
of U.S. high school students had a parent or caregiver  who  lost  their
job, 55 percent were emotionally abused by a parent or caregiver, and 11
percent were physically abused; and
 
  WHEREAS,  School  psychologists  provide  direct  consultations  and
training to improve mental wellness among our youth; and
 
  WHEREAS, This body is committed to  improving  youth  mental  health
outcomes for families across the state; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  objective  of  National School Psychology Week in the
State of New York is to raise awareness of the important work of  school
psychologists  in  our communities; the week provides an opportunity for
professionals and families to engage in discussions about what needs  to
be done to improve youth mental health outcomes; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim November  6-10,  2023,  as
National  School  Psychology  Week  in  the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
