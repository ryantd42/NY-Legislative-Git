Indios"  landed  on  the  shores of what is now Morro Bay, California on
October 18th, 1587, on  board  the  Manila-built  galleon  ship  Nuestra
Senora de Esperanza; and

passing the resolution (H. Res 780) to officially commemorate October as
Filipino American History Month in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, The recent census reports that  there  are  nearly  150,000

Heights, Elmhurst, Jamaica, Jamaica Estates, Hollis, and Queens Village;

  WHEREAS, The oldest record of Filipinos in New York was in 1888 when

Western United States in search of employment; and
 
  WHEREAS, After World War II, a smaller wave of immigrants came  from
the  Philippines,  later  followed by the largest wave of immigration in
the 1960s, after the Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  of  1965,  when
hospitals  began  recruiting  Filipino doctors and nurses; nursing later
became one of the most common professions amongst both Filipino men  and
