  Section 1. Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  law,  George  A.
 Amendola, who was first eligible to join the public retirement system as
 of  September  20, 1974 and who was employed by the Niagara Falls school
 district from September 20, 1974 to June 2, 1978 and who for reasons not
 ascribable to his own negligence was not  afforded  the  opportunity  to
 join the New York state and local employees' retirement system with Tier
 II status, shall be deemed to have become a member of the New York state
 and  local  employees'  retirement  system as of September 20, 1974; and
 shall have Tier II status, if, no later than one year after  the  effec-
 tive  date  of  this  act he shall file a written request with the state
 comptroller; and upon receipt of such application, the comptroller shall
 recalculate George Amendola's retirement  benefits  and  thereafter  pay
 such benefits accordingly as if he shall have been deemed to have joined
 such retirement system on September 20, 1974.
  §  2. No contributions made to the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system shall be returned or refunded to  George  A.  Amendola
 pursuant to this act.
  § 3. All past service costs associated with the implementation of this
 act shall be borne by the Niagara Falls school district.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would grant Tier 2 status to George A. Amendola, a retired
 Tier 4 member of the New York  State  and  Local  Employees'  Retirement
 System,  by  changing  their  date  of membership to September 20, 1974,

 their first date of  employment  with  the  Niagara  Falls  City  School
 District.  There will be no refund of member contributions.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of  approximately  $33,600  which
 will  be  borne  by the Niagara Falls City School District as a one-time
 payment.  This estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1,
 2024.
