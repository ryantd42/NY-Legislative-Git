  § 2533. DISCLOSURE OF  INFORMATION  CONCERNING  NON-INVASIVE  PRENATAL
 SCREENING  FOR  CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES.  1. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS
 SECTION, THE TERM "NON-INVASIVE PRENATAL SCREENING" SHALL MEAN ANY  NON-

 ANY POSITIVE RESULT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY CONFIRMATORY DIAGNOSTIC  TEST-
 ING,  AND  THAT  ADDITIONAL  FOLLOW  UP IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL HIGH RISK
 SCREENING.  SUCH WRITTEN NOTICE SHALL BE PROVIDED  TO  A  PATIENT  OR  A
 POTENTIAL  PARENT:  (A)  PRIOR  TO ANY PRENATAL TEST; (B) WITH SUCH TEST
 RESULTS; AND (C) WITH ANY MATERIALS PROVIDED BY THE  ENTITY  PROVIDING
 OR  FACILITATING  THE  PRENATAL  TESTING.  SUCH  WRITTEN NOTICE SHALL BE
 REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT. SUCH WRITTEN  NOTICE  SHALL  BE
 PLAINLY  WORDED AND PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED IN ANY MATERIAL PRESENTED TO A
 PATIENT OR A POTENTIAL PARENT ABOUT PRENATAL TESTING SERVICES.
  C. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE  CONSTRUED  TO  LIMIT  A
 HEALTH  CARE PRACTITIONER LICENSED, CERTIFIED, OR AUTHORIZED UNDER TITLE
 EIGHT OF THE EDUCATION LAW FROM RECOMMENDING  CERTAIN  PRENATAL  TESTING
 SERVICES  ACCORDING  TO  THE  PRACTITIONER'S  REASONABLE  AND GOOD FAITH
 PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE FACTS OF A PATIENT'S CASE.
  § 2. Section 266 of the public health law is amended by adding  a  new
 subdivision 7 to read as follows:
