  MAY,  SEPULVEDA -- read twice and ordered printed, and when printed to
  be committed to the Committee on Consumer Protection
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law,  in  relation  to  actions  or
  practices  that  establish  or  maintain  a  monopoly,  monopsony  or
  restraint of trade, and in relation  to  authorizing  a  class  action
  lawsuit in the state anti-trust law
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "Twenty-
 First Century Anti-Trust Act".
  §  2.  Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds and declares
 that there is great concern for the growing accumulation of power in the
 hands of  dominant  corporations.  These  companies  possess  great  and
 increasing  power  over  all aspects of our lives. More than one hundred
 years ago, the state and federal governments identified these same prob-
 lems after corporate combinations and trusts came to dominate the econo-
 my.  Seeing those problems, the state and  federal  governments  enacted
 transformative  legislation  to  combat  cartels,  monopolies, and other
 anti-competitive business practices. It is time to  update,  expand  and
 clarify our laws to ensure that these dominant corporations cannot abuse
 their power in ways that undermine competition to the detriment of work-
 ers,  small  businesses  and  communities  in  New York. The legislature
 further finds and declares that unilateral actions which seek to  create
 a  monopoly  or  monopsony  are as harmful as contracts or agreements of
 multiple parties to do the same and should be  treated  similarly  under
 the  law.  Firms  with  monopoly  or monopsony power are contrary to the
 public interest. Accordingly, attempts to create monopolies or  monopso-
 nies  through anti-competitive conduct should also be treated as actions
 contrary to the interests of the people of the state  of  New  York  and
 should  be  penalized  accordingly.  The legislature further finds and

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 6748  2
 
 declares that effective enforcement against unilateral  anti-competitive
 conduct  has  been impeded by courts, for example, applying narrow defi-
 nitions of monopolies and monopolization, limiting the scope of  unilat-
 eral  conduct  covered  by the federal anti-trust laws, and unreasonably
 heightening the legal standards that plaintiffs and government enforcers
 must overcome to establish violations of  those  laws.  The  legislature
 further finds and declares that one of the purposes of the state's anti-
 trust  laws  is  to ensure that our labor markets are open and fair. The
 legislature further finds and declares that  anti-competitive  practices
 harm  great  numbers  of  citizens  and therefore must ensure that those
 harmed by monopolies or  monopsonies  may  seek  redress  through  class
 actions.
  § 3. Section 340 of the general business law, as amended by chapter 12
 of the laws of 1935, subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 893 of the laws
 of  1957,  subdivision  2 as amended by chapter 805 of the laws of 1984,
 subdivisions 3 and 4 as renumbered by chapter 502 of the laws  of  1948,
 subdivision 5 as amended by chapter 333 of the laws of 1975 and subdivi-
 sion  6 as amended by chapter 31 of the laws of 1999, is amended to read
 as follows:
  §  340.  Contracts  or  agreements  for  monopoly,  MONOPSONY,  or  in
 restraint  of  trade  illegal  and  void.  1. Every contract, agreement,
 arrangement or combination whereby
  A monopoly OR MONOPSONY in the  conduct  of  any  business,  trade  or
 commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state, is or may be
 established or maintained, or whereby
  Competition or the free exercise of any activity in the conduct of any
 business,  trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this
 state is or may be restrained or whereby
  For the purpose of establishing  or  maintaining  any  such  monopoly,
 MONOPSONY,  or  unlawfully  interfering  with  the  free exercise of any
 activity in the conduct of any business, trade or  commerce  or  in  the
 furnishing  of any service in this state any business, trade or commerce
 or the furnishing of any service is or  may  be  restrained,  is  hereby
 declared to be against public policy, illegal and void.
  2. (A) IT SHALL BE UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON OR PERSONS TO MONOPOLIZE OR
 MONOPSONIZE,  OR  ATTEMPT  TO  MONOPOLIZE  OR MONOPSONIZE, OR COMBINE OR
 CONSPIRE WITH ANY OTHER PERSON OR PERSONS TO MONOPOLIZE  OR  MONOPSONIZE
 ANY BUSINESS, TRADE OR COMMERCE OR THE FURNISHING OF ANY SERVICE IN THIS
 STATE.
  (B)  IT  SHALL  BE  UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WITH A DOMINANT
 POSITION IN THE CONDUCT OF ANY BUSINESS, TRADE OR COMMERCE, IN ANY LABOR
 MARKET, OR IN THE FURNISHING OF ANY SERVICE IN THIS STATE TO ABUSE  THAT
 DOMINANT  POSITION.  THIS  PARAGRAPH  SHALL  NOT  APPLY TO A PERSON OR
 PERSONS MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A SMALL  BUSINESS  UNDER  SECTION  ONE
 HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LAW.
  (I)  IN  ANY  ACTION BROUGHT UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH, A PERSON'S DOMINANT
 POSITION MAY BE ESTABLISHED BY DIRECT EVIDENCE, INDIRECT EVIDENCE, OR  A
 COMBINATION OF THE TWO.
  (1)  EXAMPLES  OF DIRECT EVIDENCE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 UNILATERAL POWER TO SET PRICES, TERMS,  CONDITIONS,  OR  STANDARDS;  THE
 UNILATERAL  POWER TO DICTATE NON-PRICE CONTRACTUAL TERMS WITHOUT COMPEN-
 SATION; OR OTHER EVIDENCE THAT A PERSON IS NOT CONSTRAINED BY MEANINGFUL
 COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO DEGRADE QUALITY OR  REDUCE
 OUTPUT  WITHOUT  SUFFERING REDUCTION IN PROFITABILITY. IN LABOR MARKETS,
 EXAMPLES OF DIRECT EVIDENCE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE USE  OF
 S. 6748  3
 
 NON-COMPETE  CLAUSES  OR NO-POACH AGREEMENTS, OR THE UNILATERAL POWER TO
 SET WAGES.
  (2)  A  PERSON'S DOMINANT POSITION MAY ALSO BE ESTABLISHED BY INDIRECT
 EVIDENCE SUCH AS THE PERSON'S SHARE OF A RELEVANT MARKET. A  PERSON  WHO
 HAS A SHARE OF FORTY PERCENT OR GREATER OF A RELEVANT MARKET AS A SELLER
 SHALL  BE PRESUMED TO HAVE A DOMINANT POSITION IN THAT MARKET UNDER THIS
 PARAGRAPH. A PERSON WHO HAS A SHARE OF THIRTY PERCENT OR  GREATER  OF  A
 RELEVANT MARKET AS A BUYER SHALL BE PRESUMED TO HAVE A DOMINANT POSITION
 IN THAT MARKET UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH.
  (3)  IF DIRECT EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A PERSON HAS
 A DOMINANT POSITION OR HAS ABUSED SUCH A  DOMINANT  POSITION,  NO  COURT
 SHALL  REQUIRE  DEFINITION OF A RELEVANT MARKET IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE
 EVIDENCE, FIND LIABILITY, OR FIND THAT A CLAIM  HAS  BEEN  STATED  UNDER
 THIS PARAGRAPH.
  (II)  IN  ANY ACTION BROUGHT UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH, ABUSE OF A DOMINANT
 POSITION MAY INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, CONDUCT THAT TENDS TO FORE-
 CLOSE OR LIMIT THE ABILITY OR INCENTIVE OF ONE OR MORE ACTUAL OR  POTEN-
 TIAL  COMPETITORS  TO COMPETE, SUCH AS LEVERAGING A DOMINANT POSITION IN
 ONE MARKET TO LIMIT COMPETITION IN A SEPARATE  MARKET,  OR  REFUSING  TO
 DEAL  WITH  ANOTHER PERSON WITH THE EFFECT OF UNNECESSARILY EXCLUDING OR
 HANDICAPPING ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL COMPETITORS. IN  LABOR  MARKETS,  ABUSE
 MAY  INCLUDE,  BUT  IS  NOT  LIMITED TO, IMPOSING CONTRACTS BY WHICH ANY
 PERSON IS RESTRAINED FROM ENGAGING IN A  LAWFUL  PROFESSION,  TRADE,  OR
 BUSINESS OF ANY KIND, OR BY RESTRICTING THE FREEDOM OF WORKERS AND INDE-
 PENDENT CONTRACTORS TO DISCLOSE WAGE AND BENEFIT INFORMATION.
  (III)  EVIDENCE  OF  PRO-COMPETITIVE EFFECTS SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE TO
 ABUSE OF DOMINANCE AND SHALL NOT OFFSET OR CURE COMPETITIVE HARM.
  (C) (I) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS HEREBY EMPOWERED TO ADOPT, PROMULGATE,
 AMEND, AND REPEAL RULES, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED  IN  PARAGRAPH  (A)  OF

 criminal proceeding barred by prior limitation shall be revived by  this

 EXPERT  WITNESSES  AND  CONSULTANTS  IF  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR PRIVATE
 LITIGANTS PREVAIL IN SUCH ACTION.
  § 8. Non-compete clauses.
 S. 6748  7
 
  1. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
  (a)  (1)  "Non-compete  clause"  means  a  contractual term between an
 employer and a worker that prevents the worker from seeking or accepting
 employment with a person, or operating a business, after the  conclusion
 of the worker's employment with the employer.
  (2)  The term "non-compete clause" includes a contractual term that is
 a de facto non-compete clause because it has the effect  of  prohibiting
 the worker from seeking or accepting employment with a person or operat-
 ing  a business after the conclusion of the worker's employment with the
 employer. The following types of contractual terms, among others, may be
 de facto non-compete clauses:
  i. A non-disclosure agreement between an employer and a worker that is
 written so broadly that it effectively precludes the worker from working
 in the same field after the conclusion of the worker's  employment  with
 the employer.
  ii.  A contractual term between an employer and a worker that requires
 the worker to pay the employer or  a  third-party  entity  for  training
 costs  if  the  worker's  employment  terminates within a specified time
 period, where the required payment is  not  reasonably  related  to  the
 costs the employer incurred for training the worker.
  (b)  "Employer"  means  a person, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 57b-1(a)(6),
 that hires or contracts with a worker to work for the person.
  (c) "Employment" means work for an employer, as the term  employer  is
 defined in paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
  (d)  "Substantial  owner, substantial member, and substantial partner"
 mean an owner, member, or partner holding at least a 25  percent  owner-
 ship interest in a business entity.
  (e) "Worker" means a natural person who works, whether paid or unpaid,
 for  an  employer.  The  term includes, without limitation, an employee,
 individual classified as  an  independent  contractor,  extern,  intern,
 volunteer,  apprentice,  or  sole proprietor who provides a service to a
 client or customer. The term worker does not include a franchisee in the
 context of a franchisee-franchisor relationship; however, the term work-
 er includes a natural person who works for the franchisee or franchisor.
 Non-compete clauses between franchisors  and  franchisees  would  remain
 subject to federal antitrust law as well as all other applicable law.
  2. Unfair method of competition. It is an unfair method of competition
 for  an  employer  to  enter into or attempt to enter into a non-compete
 clause with a worker; maintain with a worker a  non-compete  clause;  or
 represent to a worker that the worker is subject to a non-compete clause
 where the employer has no good faith basis to believe that the worker is
 subject to an enforceable non-compete clause.
  3.  Existing  non-compete clauses. (a) To comply with subdivision 2 of
 this section, which states that it is an unfair  method  of  competition
 for  an  employer  to  maintain  with  a worker a non-compete clause, an
 employer that entered into a non-compete clause with a worker  prior  to
 the  compliance  date  must rescind the non-compete clause no later than
 the compliance date.
  (b) (1) An employer that rescinds a  non-compete  clause  pursuant  to
 paragraph (a) of this subdivision must provide notice to the worker that
 the  worker's  non-compete  clause is no longer in effect and may not be
 enforced against the worker.  The employer must provide  the  notice  to
 the worker in an individualized communication. The employer must provide
 the  notice  on  paper  or  in a digital format such as, for example, an
 email or text message. The employer must provide the notice to the work-
 er within 45 days of rescinding the non-compete clause.
 S. 6748  8
 
  (2) The employer must provide the notice to  a  worker  who  currently
 works  for  the employer. The employer must also provide the notice to a
 worker who formerly worked for the employer, provided that the  employer
 has the worker's contact information readily available.
  (3) The following model language constitutes notice to the worker that
 the  worker's  non-compete  clause is no longer in effect and may not be
 enforced against the worker, for purposes of subparagraph  one  of  this
 paragraph.  An  employer  may also use different language, provided that
 the notice communicates to the  worker  that  the  worker's  non-compete
 clause  is no longer in effect and may not be enforced against the work-
 er.  "A new state law makes it unlawful for us to maintain a non-compete
 clause in your employment contract. As of {DATE 180 DAYS AFTER ENACTMENT
 OF THIS LAW}, the non-compete clause in your contract is  no  longer  in
 effect. This means that once you stop working for {EMPLOYER NAME}:
  You  may  seek  or accept a job with any company or any person-even if
 they compete with {EMPLOYER NAME}.
  You may run your own  business-even  if  it  competes  with  {EMPLOYER
 NAME}.
  You  may  compete  with  {EMPLOYER  NAME}  at  any time following your
 employment with {EMPLOYER NAME}.
  This law does not affect any other terms of your employment contract."
  (c) An employer complies with the rescission requirement in  paragraph
 (a) of this subdivision where it provides notice to a worker pursuant to
 paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
  4.  Applicability. The requirements of this section shall not apply to
 a non-compete clause that is entered into by a person who is  selling  a
 business  entity or otherwise disposing of all of the person's ownership
 interest in the business entity, or by a person who is  selling  all  or
 substantially  all  of  a  business  entity's operating assets, when the
 person restricted by the non-compete clause is a substantial  owner  of,
 or  substantial member or substantial partner in, the business entity at
 the time the person enters  into  the  non-compete  clause.  Non-compete
 clauses  covered by this exception would remain subject to federal anti-
 trust law as well as all other applicable law.
  § 9. Severability. If any provision of this act,  or  the  application
 thereof  to  any person or circumstances, is held invalid or unconstitu-
 tional, that invalidity or unconstitutionality shall  not  affect  other
 provisions  or applications of this act that can be given effect without
 the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application,  and  to  this
 end the provisions of this act are severable.
  § 10. This act shall take effect immediately.
