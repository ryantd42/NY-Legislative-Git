 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  general business law, in relation to actions or
  practices  that  establish  or  maintain  a  monopoly,  monopsony  or
  restraint  of  trade,  and  in  relation to authorizing a class action
  lawsuit in the state anti-trust law
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as the "Twenty-
 First Century Anti-Trust Act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds  and  declares
 New  York's  great concern with the growing accumulation of power in the
 hands of dominant corporations that harms our marketplace, our  democra-
 cy, and that undermines the power of workers, consumers, and small busi-
 nesses.  It  is time to update, expand, and clarify our laws, consistent
 with the purposes of the  anti-trust  reforms  of  the  early  Twentieth
 Century,  to  police abuses of power by dominant firms.  The legislature
 further finds and declares that unilateral actions which seek to  create
 a  monopoly  or  monopsony  are as harmful as contracts or agreements of
 multiple parties to do the same and should be  treated  similarly  under
 the  law.  Firms  with  monopoly  or monopsony power are contrary to the
 public interest. The legislature further finds and  declares  that  laws
 governing  multi-firm  conduct  should  be  updated, consistent with the
 purposes of anti-trust law, to adequately address  abuses  of  power  by
 dominant  firms  embodied in coercive vertical restraints on small busi-
 nesses, workers,  and  consumers.  The  legislature  further  finds  and
 declares  that  effective  enforcement against unfair competition, espe-

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 cially on the part of dominant firms, has been impeded  by  courts,  for
 example,  applying  narrow definitions of monopolies and monopolization,
 limiting the scope of unilateral conduct, making it  excessively  diffi-
 cult  to  challenge  unfair competition and unreasonably heightening the
 legal standards that plaintiffs and government enforcers  must  overcome
 to establish violations of those laws. The legislature further finds and
 declares  that  one of the purposes of the state's anti-trust laws is to
 ensure that our labor markets are open and fair. The legislature further
 finds and declares that anti-competitive practices harm great numbers of
 citizens and therefore must ensure that those harmed  by  monopolies  or
 monopsonies may seek redress through private enforcement.
  § 3. Section 340 of the general business law, as amended by chapter 12
 of the laws of 1935, subdivision 1 as amended by chapter 893 of the laws
 of  1957,  subdivision  2 as amended by chapter 805 of the laws of 1984,
 subdivisions 3 and 4 as renumbered by chapter 502 of the laws  of  1948,

  §  340.  Contracts  or  agreements  for  monopoly,  MONOPSONY,  or  in
 restraint  of  trade  illegal  and  void.  1. Every contract, agreement,
 arrangement or combination whereby
  A monopoly OR MONOPSONY in the  conduct  of  any  business,  trade  or
 commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state, is or may be
 established or maintained, or whereby
  Competition or the free exercise of any activity in the conduct of any
 business,  trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this
 state is or may be restrained or whereby
  For the purpose of establishing  or  maintaining  any  such  monopoly,
 MONOPSONY,  or  unlawfully  interfering  with  the  free exercise of any
 activity in the conduct of any business, trade or  commerce  or  in  the
 furnishing  of any service in this state any business, trade or commerce
 or the furnishing of any service is or  may  be  restrained,  is  hereby
 declared to be against public policy, illegal and void.
  2. (A) IT SHALL BE UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON OR PERSONS TO MONOPOLIZE OR
 MONOPSONIZE,  OR  ATTEMPT  TO  MONOPOLIZE  OR MONOPSONIZE, OR COMBINE OR

 PERSONS THAT ARE INDEPENDENTLY OWNED AND OPERATED AND EMPLOY ONE HUNDRED

  (I) IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH,  A  PERSON'S  DOMINANT
 POSITION  MAY BE ESTABLISHED BY DIRECT EVIDENCE, INDIRECT EVIDENCE, OR A
 COMBINATION OF THE TWO.
  (1) EXAMPLES OF DIRECT EVIDENCE  INCLUDE,  BUT  ARE  NOT  LIMITED  TO,
 REDUCTION  IN  OUTPUT OR IN QUALITY OF GOODS OR SERVICES, THE IMPOSITION
 OF SUPRACOMPETITIVE PRICES, OR THE ABILITY TO FORCE, INDUCE,  OR  OTHER-
 WISE  COERCE  A  SUPPLIER  TO OFFER A LOWER PRICE, DISCOUNT, ADVERTISING

 EVIDENCE, FIND LIABILITY, OR FIND THAT A CLAIM  HAS  BEEN  STATED  UNDER
 THIS PARAGRAPH.
  (II)  IN  ANY ACTION BROUGHT UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH, ABUSE OF A DOMINANT
 POSITION MAY INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, CONDUCT THAT TENDS TO FORE-
 CLOSE OR LIMIT THE ABILITY OR INCENTIVE OF ONE OR MORE ACTUAL OR  POTEN-
 TIAL  COMPETITORS  TO COMPETE, SUCH AS LEVERAGING A DOMINANT POSITION IN
 ONE MARKET TO LIMIT COMPETITION IN A SEPARATE MARKET; REFUSING  TO  DEAL
 WITH ANOTHER PERSON WITH THE EFFECT OF UNNECESSARILY EXCLUDING OR HANDI-
 CAPPING  ACTUAL  OR POTENTIAL COMPETITORS; COERCING THE PURCHASER OF ONE
 PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR CONTRACT INTO PURCHASING OR  OBTAINING  A  SEPARATE

 A THIRD PARTY INTO, AN EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT OR CONTRACT  THAT  SERVES  TO
 FORECLOSE  OR  INCREASE  COSTS FOR A COMPETITOR. IN LABOR MARKETS, ABUSE
 MAY INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, IMPOSING RESTRAINTS, DIRECT OR INDI-
 RECT, ON THE MOBILITY OF WORKERS BETWEEN EMPLOYERS, THE ABILITY OF WORK-
 ERS TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT FROM MULTIPLE EMPLOYERS BY RESTRICTING THE  FREE-
 DOM  OF WORKERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO DISCLOSE WAGE AND BENEFIT
 INFORMATION, OR WAGE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON ANY UNDISCLOSED  OR  HIDDEN
 CONSIDERATIONS.
  (C) (I) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF THIS PARAGRAPH, THE
 FOLLOWING RESTRAINTS ARE PRESUMED TO BE ILLEGAL WHEN ENGAGED IN BY DOMI-
 NANT FIRMS:
  (1)  ANY RESTRAINT THAT REQUIRES ANOTHER PERSON TO DEAL EXCLUSIVELY OR
 PRIMARILY WITH THE FIRM IMPOSING THE RESTRAINT OR ANOTHER PERSON  SPECI-

 REQUIRING ANOTHER PERSON TO DEAL EXCLUSIVELY OR PRIMARILY WITH THE  FIRM

  (2)  ANY RESTRAINT THAT CONDITIONS THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF ANY PRODUCT
 OR SERVICES ON AN AGREEMENT TO  SELL  OR  PURCHASE  ANOTHER  PRODUCT  OR

 WHETHER TO RECOGNIZE A UNION OF ITS EMPLOYEES OR TO OTHERWISE  AGREE  TO
 NEGOTIATE  WITH  ITS EMPLOYEES COLLECTIVELY OVER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
 EMPLOYMENT;
  (6) ANY RESTRAINT  THAT  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL,  THROUGH  RULEMAKING,
 DETERMINES  POSES  A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF HARMING COMPETITION THAT IS NOT
 ALREADY PRESUMED ILLEGAL;
  (7) ANY ADDITIONAL RESTRAINT THAT  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL  DETERMINES,
 THROUGH RULEMAKING, GENERALLY SERVES NO LEGITIMATE BUSINESS PURPOSE THAT
 CANNOT BE ACHIEVED IN SOME LESS RESTRICTIVE WAY.

 ANT ESTABLISHES, BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE, THAT THE PRO-COMPETI-
 TIVE  BENEFITS OF THE CHALLENGED CONDUCT (1) ARE ACHIEVABLE ONLY THROUGH
 THAT CONDUCT AND (2) OUTWEIGH THAT CONDUCT'S HARM  TO  COMPETITION.  THE
 HARM TO COMPETITION IN ONE MARKET FROM THE CHALLENGED CONDUCT MAY NOT BE

 any person who has sustained damages by  reason  of  violation  of  this
 section  has  not  dealt  directly  with  the defendant shall not bar or
 otherwise limit recovery; provided, however, that in any action in which

 of  all  related  actions.  In  actions  where  both direct and indirect
 purchasers are involved, a defendant shall be entitled  to  prove  as  a
 partial  or  complete  defense  to  a claim for damages that the illegal

 recover so as to avoid duplication of recovery of damages.
  8.  ANY  PERSON  HARMED  BY THIS SECTION, WHETHER HARMED DIRECTLY OR
 INDIRECTLY BY THE PURPORTED VIOLATION, SHALL BE ENTITLED TO BRING SUIT.

  § 8. Non-compete clauses.
  1. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
  (a)  (1)  "Non-compete  clause"  means  a  contractual term between an
 employer and a worker that prevents the worker from seeking or accepting
 employment with a person, or operating a business, after the  conclusion
 of the worker's employment with the employer.
  (2)  The term "non-compete clause" includes a contractual term that is
 a de facto non-compete clause because it has the effect  of  prohibiting
 the worker from seeking or accepting employment with a person or operat-
 ing  a business after the conclusion of the worker's employment with the
 employer. The following types of contractual terms, among others, may be
 de facto non-compete clauses:
  i. A non-disclosure agreement between an employer and a worker that is
 written so broadly that it effectively precludes the worker from working
 in the same field after the conclusion of the worker's  employment  with
 the employer.
  ii.  A contractual term between an employer and a worker that requires
 the worker to pay the employer or  a  third-party  entity  for  training
 costs  if  the  worker's  employment  terminates within a specified time
 period, where the required payment is  not  reasonably  related  to  the
 costs the employer incurred for training the worker.
  (b)  "Employer"  means  a person, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 57b-1(a)(6),
 that hires or contracts with a worker to work for the person.
  (c) "Employment" means work for an employer, as the term  employer  is
 defined in paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
  (d)  "Substantial  owner, substantial member, and substantial partner"
 mean an owner, member, or partner holding at least a 25  percent  owner-
 ship interest in a business entity.
  (e) "Worker" means a natural person who works, whether paid or unpaid,
 for  an  employer.  The  term includes, without limitation, an employee,
 individual classified as  an  independent  contractor,  extern,  intern,
 volunteer,  apprentice,  or  sole proprietor who provides a service to a
 client or customer. The term worker does not include a franchisee in the
 context of a franchisee-franchisor relationship; however, the term work-
 er includes a natural person who works for the franchisee or franchisor.
 Non-compete clauses between franchisors  and  franchisees  would  remain
 subject to federal antitrust law as well as all other applicable law.
  2. Unfair method of competition. It is an unfair method of competition
 for  an  employer  to  enter into or attempt to enter into a non-compete
 clause with a worker; maintain with a worker a  non-compete  clause;  or
 represent to a worker that the worker is subject to a non-compete clause
 where the employer has no good faith basis to believe that the worker is
 subject to an enforceable non-compete clause.
  3.  Existing  non-compete clauses. (a) To comply with subdivision 2 of
 this section, which states that it is an unfair  method  of  competition
 for  an  employer  to  maintain  with  a worker a non-compete clause, an
 employer that entered into a non-compete clause with a worker  prior  to
 the  compliance  date  must rescind the non-compete clause no later than
 the compliance date.
 S. 6748--A  9
 
  (b) (1) An employer that rescinds a  non-compete  clause  pursuant  to
 paragraph (a) of this subdivision must provide notice to the worker that
 the  worker's  non-compete  clause is no longer in effect and may not be
 enforced against the worker.  The employer must provide  the  notice  to
 the worker in an individualized communication. The employer must provide
 the  notice  on  paper  or  in a digital format such as, for example, an
 email or text message. The employer must provide the notice to the work-
 er within 45 days of rescinding the non-compete clause.
  (2) The employer must provide the notice to  a  worker  who  currently
 works  for  the employer. The employer must also provide the notice to a
 worker who formerly worked for the employer, provided that the  employer
 has the worker's contact information readily available.
  (3) The following model language constitutes notice to the worker that
 the  worker's  non-compete  clause is no longer in effect and may not be
 enforced against the worker, for purposes of subparagraph  one  of  this
 paragraph.  An  employer  may also use different language, provided that
 the notice communicates to the  worker  that  the  worker's  non-compete
 clause  is no longer in effect and may not be enforced against the work-
 er.  "A new state law makes it unlawful for us to maintain a non-compete
 clause in your employment contract. As of {DATE 180 DAYS AFTER ENACTMENT
 OF THIS LAW}, the non-compete clause in your contract is  no  longer  in
 effect. This means that once you stop working for {EMPLOYER NAME}:
  You  may  seek  or accept a job with any company or any person-even if
 they compete with {EMPLOYER NAME}.
  You may run your own  business-even  if  it  competes  with  {EMPLOYER
 NAME}.
  You  may  compete  with  {EMPLOYER  NAME}  at  any time following your
 employment with {EMPLOYER NAME}.
  This law does not affect any other terms of your employment contract."
  (c) An employer complies with the rescission requirement in  paragraph
 (a) of this subdivision where it provides notice to a worker pursuant to
 paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
  4.  Applicability. The requirements of this section shall not apply to
 a non-compete clause that is entered into by a person who is  selling  a
 business  entity or otherwise disposing of all of the person's ownership
 interest in the business entity, or by a person who is  selling  all  or
 substantially  all  of  a  business  entity's operating assets, when the
 person restricted by the non-compete clause is a substantial  owner  of,
 or  substantial member or substantial partner in, the business entity at
 the time the person enters  into  the  non-compete  clause.  Non-compete
 clauses  covered by this exception would remain subject to federal anti-
 trust law as well as all other applicable law.
  § 9. The general business law is amended by adding a new  section  348
 to read as follows:
  § 348. PROHIBITION ON UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION. 1. UNFAIR METHODS
 OF  COMPETITION  ARE  HEREBY DECLARED UNLAWFUL. AS USED IN THIS SECTION,
 "UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION" SHALL MEAN AND INCLUDE ANY ACT OR  PRAC-
 TICE  THAT  THREATENS  AN  INCIPIENT  VIOLATION OF AN ANTI-TRUST LAW, OR
 VIOLATES THE POLICY OR SPIRIT OF AN ANTI-TRUST LAW BECAUSE  ITS  EFFECTS
 ARE  COMPARABLE  TO  OR THE SAME AS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW, OR OTHERWISE
 SIGNIFICANTLY THREATENS OR HARMS COMPETITION.
  2. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY THROUGH RULEMAKING TO
 DECLARE CERTAIN CONDUCT OR PRACTICES AS UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION.
  § 10. Severability. If any provision of this act, or  the  application
 thereof  to  any person or circumstances, is held invalid or unconstitu-
 tional, that invalidity or unconstitutionality shall  not  affect  other
 S. 6748--A  10
 
 provisions  or applications of this act that can be given effect without
 the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application,  and  to  this
 end the provisions of this act are severable.
  § 11. This act shall take effect immediately.
