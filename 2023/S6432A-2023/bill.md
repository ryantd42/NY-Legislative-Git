 AN ACT in relation to authorizing  the  county  of  Nassau  assessor  to
  accept an application for a real property tax exemption from Torah Ohr
  Hebrew Academy
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Torah Ohr Hebrew Academy an application for exemption from real property
 taxes pursuant to section 420-a and 462 of the  real  property  tax  law
 with  respect  to  the  2020-2021  and  2021-2022 assessment rolls for a
 portion of the 2021-2022 school taxes, a portion  of  the  2021  general
 taxes  and  all  of  the 2022 general taxes for the parcel owned by such
 organization located at 5 Fairview Avenue, village of Great  Neck,  town
 of  North  Hempstead, county of Nassau, otherwise known as Nassau county
 tax map section 1, block 088, lot  466.  If  accepted,  the  application
 shall  be  reviewed  as if it had been received on or before the taxable
 status date established for such assessment rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
