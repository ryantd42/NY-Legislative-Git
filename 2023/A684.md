  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

  in  relation  to  the  disposition  of  barge canal lands, barge canal
  terminals or barge canal terminal lands
 
  Section 1. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That section 1 of  article
 15 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  Section  1.  The  legislature  shall  not  sell,  abandon or otherwise
 dispose of the now existing or future improved barge  canal,  the  divi-
 sions  of  which  are  the  Erie  canal, the Oswego canal, the Champlain
 canal, and the Cayuga and Seneca canals, or of the terminals constructed
 as part of the barge canal system; nor shall it sell, abandon or  other-
 wise  dispose  of  any portion of the canal system existing prior to the
 barge canal improvement which portion forms a part of, or functions as a
 part of, the present barge canal system; but such canals  and  terminals
 shall  remain  the  property  of  the state and under its management and
 control forever. LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL SHALL BE OBTAINED FOR  ANY  CHANGE
 IN  THE  STATE  AGENCY  OR  AGENCY  SUBDIVISION WHICH HAS MANAGEMENT AND
 CONTROL, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MANAGEMENT AND  CONTROL  OVER  ITS
 MAINTENANCE  AND  OVERSIGHT,  OF  ANY  PORTION  OF THE BARGE CANAL. This
 prohibition shall not prevent the legislature, by appropriate laws, from
 authorizing the granting of revocable permits or leases for  periods  of
 time  as  authorized by the legislature for the occupancy or use of such
 lands or structures.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing amendment  be
 referred  to  the  first regular legislative session convening after the
 next succeeding general election of members of  the  assembly,  and,  in
 conformity  with  section  1  of  article  19  of  the  constitution, be
 published for 3 months previous to the time of such election.
