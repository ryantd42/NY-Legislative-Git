  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  October 2023, as Bullying Prevention  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 2023, as Bullying
Prevention Month in the State of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Bullying Prevention Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Bullying is comprised of direct behaviors such as teasing,
taunting, threatening, hitting, and stealing that are initiated  by  one
or more students against a target, as well as indirect behaviors such as
spreading  rumors and acting in other ways to cause another person to be
socially  isolated  through  intentional  exclusion,  with  all  such
behaviors,  direct  or  indirect, amounting to physical or psychological
intimidation occurring repeatedly over time to create an ongoing pattern
of harassment and abuse; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Race,  age,  religion,  physical  disability,  physical
appearance,  socioeconomic  status  and various other factors can be the
basis of bullying and anyone can be a target; and
 
  WHEREAS, People who bully others are at increased risk for substance
abuse,  academic  problems,  and  violence  later  in  adolescence  and
adulthood;  in  addition,  those  individuals  who  stand  by  passively
watching or actively encouraging bullying are  also  affected  by  these
hostile  acts; they encourage bullying by creating an audience, they may
become desensitized to cruelty,  they  may  learn  to  imitate  bullying
behavior  and  become bullies themselves, and/or they may be fearful for
their own safety, adding to their own insecurity; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, nearly 30% of all students  are  either  bullies  or
victims  of  bullying,  and  160,000  young people stay home from school
every day because of their fear of bullying; and
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout the past year, approximately 20% of high  school
students in the United States reported being bullied at their school, as
well as about 15% who claimed they were bullied online; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals who choose to practice unselfish generosity and
who  lead by example tend to leave a trail of positive feelings in their
wake; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be continued  public  awareness
of  this  serious  issue,  and  to encourage all New Yorkers to practice
kindness toward all people; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim October 2023, as Bullying
Prevention Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of New York.
