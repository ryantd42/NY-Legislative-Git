 AN ACT to amend the parks, recreation and historic preservation law,  in
  relation  to  prohibiting  the  possession  of  concealed  firearms in
  national parks and national wildlife refuge systems
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature hereby finds that the
 national  parks  and  national  wildlife refuge systems in the state are
 attractive places for citizens of all ages to safely enjoy the  benefits
 of healthy and safe outdoor activity. The legislature further finds that
 the  presence of concealed firearms in national parks and national wild-
 life refuge systems represents an  unnecessary  threat,  whether  inten-
 tional or unintentional, to the health and safety of citizens invited to
 enjoy  these  public  recreational opportunities as well as the wildlife
 preserved within such recreation areas. Therefore, it is the purpose  of
 the  legislature to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public
 and prohibit the possession of a concealed firearm in all national parks
 and national wildlife refuge systems, except as specifically provided by
 law.
  § 2. The parks, recreation and historic preservation law is amended by
 adding a new section 13.32 to read as follows:
  § 13.32 PROHIBITION  OF  CONCEALED  FIREARMS  IN  NATIONAL  PARKS  AND
 NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEMS.  1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION
 AND  OTHERWISE  SPECIFICALLY  PERMITTED  IN LAW, NO PERSON, OTHER THAN A
 MEMBER OF A FEDERAL, STATE OR MUNICIPAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENCY  AUTHOR-
 IZED  TO  CARRY  A CONCEALED FIREARM, SHALL INTRODUCE OR POSSESS, EITHER
 UPON HIS OR HER PERSON OR WITHIN A VEHICLE OR OTHER  PLACE  OF  STORAGE,
 ANY  CONCEALED  FIREARM IN ANY NATIONAL PARK OR NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
 SYSTEM.
