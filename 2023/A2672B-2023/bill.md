 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to requiring sell-
  ers to clearly post the price of a credit card surcharge
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 518 of the general business law, as added by  chap-
 ter 160 of the laws of 1984, is amended to read as follows:
  §  518.  1.  Credit  card surcharge prohibited. No seller in any sales
 transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a cred-
 it card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means UNLESS  SUCH
 SELLER CLEARLY POSTS THE CREDIT CARD PRICE, INCLUSIVE OF SUCH SURCHARGE,
 SO  CUSTOMERS  ARE  EXPOSED  TO  THE HIGHEST TAGGED OR POSTED PRICE. THE
 FINAL SALES PRICE OF ANY  SUCH  SALES  TRANSACTION,  INCLUSIVE  OF  SUCH
 SURCHARGE, SHALL NOT AMOUNT TO A PRICE GREATER THAN THE POSTED PRICE FOR
 SUCH  SALES TRANSACTION.  NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE DEEMED TO
 PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM OFFERING A  TWO-TIER  PRICING  SYSTEM.  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION,  "TWO-TIER  PRICING  SYSTEM" SHALL MEAN THE
 TAGGING OR POSTING OF TWO DIFFERENT PRICES  IN  WHICH  THE  CREDIT  CARD
 PRICE, INCLUSIVE OF ANY SURCHARGE, IS POSTED ALONGSIDE THE CASH PRICE.
  2.  Any  seller  who  violates the provisions of this section shall be
 guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed five  hundred
 dollars  or  a  term  of  imprisonment  up  to  one year, or both.  THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION  MAY  BE  ENFORCED  CONCURRENTLY  BY  THE
 DIRECTOR  OR  COMMISSIONER OF A MUNICIPAL CONSUMER AFFAIRS OFFICE, OR BY
 THE TOWN ATTORNEY, CITY CORPORATION COUNSEL, OR OTHER LAWFUL DESIGNEE OF
 A MUNICIPALITY OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AND ALL MONEYS COLLECTED  THEREUNDER
 SHALL BE RETAINED BY SUCH MUNICIPALITY OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
