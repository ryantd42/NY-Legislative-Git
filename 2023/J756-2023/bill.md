  the occasion of hosting its Annual Gala  on  May  9,
  2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to commend those
illustrious organizations of the State of New York who have made stellar
efforts on behalf of young people and their futures; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Cristo Rey Brooklyn High School upon the occasion of hosting its
Annual Gala, to be celebrated on Tuesday, May 9, 2023, in Brooklyn,  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Cristo  Rey  Brooklyn  High  School carries the mission to
provide high quality, independent college preparation  to  young  people
from  Brooklyn  and surrounding communities who would not otherwise have
access to such resources; and
 
  WHEREAS, With humble beginnings in September  of  2008,  Cristo  Rey
Brooklyn  High  School,  formerly  known as Lourdes Academy High School,
opened with only 43 students; in 2011, the School  was  renamed  to  its
current  designation and in 2012, achieved full membership in the Cristo
Rey Network; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2013, Cristo Rey Brooklyn High School moved locations to
the former Catherine McAuley High  School  in  East  Flatbush;  the  new
facility made it possible to grow enrollment and offer numerous programs
and resources; and
 
  WHEREAS,  After a two-year accreditation review period, in May 2018,
Cristo Rey Brooklyn High School achieved full accreditation from the New
York State Association of Independent Schools (NYSAIS); then,  in  2020,
the  NYSAIS  Board of Trustees voted to extend the accreditation term by
four years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Cristo Rey Brooklyn High School serves 300  students
and  claims  close  to  600  graduates;  the  School  offers  a rigorous
curriculum, a unique  work-study  experience,  and  the  support  of  an
inclusive school community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This vital organization is truly committed to igniting the
potential of its youth,  positioning  them  for  long  term  success  as
leaders in the community; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Cristo Rey Brooklyn High School is in direct
correlation to the efforts of its dedicated staff, whose involvement is,
and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an impressive commitment, an
unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising standard  of  excellence  in
all endeavors on behalf of the organization and the community it serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  auspicious occasion presents an opportunity for this
Legislative Body to recognize and pay tribute  to  Cristo  Rey  Brooklyn
High School; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought to our attention, they should be celebrated  and  recognized  by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Cristo Rey Brooklyn High School upon the occasion of hosting its
Annual Gala on May 9, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Cristo Rey Brooklyn High School.
