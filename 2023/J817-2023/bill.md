  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to commend past Chief
David  Vredenburgh  upon  the  occasion  of  his designation for special
recognition after more  than  50  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the
Cazenovia Fire Department, which was celebrated at its Annual Meeting on
Tuesday, April 4, 2023, at the firehouse at 121 Albany Street; and
 
  WHEREAS, After moving to Cazenovia in 1967, David Vredenburgh joined
the  Volunteer Fire Department in Madison County in 1972; throughout his
more than 50 years of service, he  held  several  positions  within  the
Department  including  rescue  captain,  second  lieutenant,  first
lieutenant, captain, second assistant chief, first assistant chief,  and
served as chief from 1995-1997; and
 
  WHEREAS,  David  Vredenburgh  has  always  been  eager  to learn and
successfully completed numerous  fire  and  emergency  medical  services
(EMS) training courses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  his  steadfast  and  unremitting  commitment  to  the
Cazenovia Fire Department and to his community,  David  Vredenburgh  has
been  the  recipient  of  several  awards  and  accolades  including  a
Certificate of Appreciation from the New York  State  Police,  the  1998

  WHEREAS, David Vredenburgh was an EMT for 30 years,  and  a  charter
member  of the Cazenovia Area Volunteer Ambulance Corps (CAVAC), holding
the positions of director of operations for nine years and president for
four years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
David Vredenburgh is one such firefighter; throughout more than 50 years
of devoted service,  this  volunteer  heroically  performed,  above  and
beyond the call of duty, those responsibilities which define the task of
fire protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor past Chief David Vredenburgh upon the occasion of his  designation
for special recognition after more than 50 years of dedicated service to
the Cazenovia Fire Department; and be it further
