 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation  to  establishment
  of  the  water-based  fire protection licensure act, and providing for

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This  act  shall be known and may be cited as the "water-
 based fire protection licensure act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. It is declared that there exists and  may  in
 the  future  exist  within  the state of New York locations where water-
 based fire protection systems are installed  and  improper  installation
 and  improper  inspection,  testing,  and  maintenance  of existing fire
 protection systems may adversely affect the public  health,  safety  and
 general welfare. It is further acknowledged that fire protection systems
 are  critical  life  and  property safety systems and such systems whose
 layout,  installing,  repairing,  inspecting,  testing,  or  maintenance
 require  specialized  knowledge and experience. Therefore the purpose of
 this act is to protect, promote and preserve the public  health,  safety
 and general welfare by providing for the establishment of minimum stand-
 ards  for  licensure  of water-based fire protection system installation
 and inspecting contractors as well as  designating  and  utilization  of
 responsible managing employees as qualifiers of said license with estab-
 lishment  of  penalties  for  improper  layout,  installing,  repairing,
 inspecting, testing,  or  maintaining  of  water-based  fire  protection
 systems  and  prohibit  unlicensed activities. Furnishing and installing
 underground  water-supply  and  one-family  and  two-family  residential
 systems,  unless  a residential system in a "group home" are exempt from
 this act.
