 lature  shall  be  subject to approval of the governor AND ACTION BY THE

 mental appropriation bill shall be subject to  the  governor's  approval
 AND ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE as provided in section 7 of article IV.

 ation.
  ANY  NEW  LEGISLATION,  AMENDMENT TO LEGISLATION, OR LIMITATION ON THE
