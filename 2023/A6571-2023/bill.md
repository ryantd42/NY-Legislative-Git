 consisting of such unpaid amounts, together with interest thereon at the
 rate of five percent per annum, compounded annually; and
  (B)  such  interest  on  each amount of undeducted contributions shall
 accrue from the end of the payroll period for which  such  amount  would
 have been deducted from compensation if he or she had been a participant
 at  the  beginning  of that payroll period, until such amount is paid to
 the retirement system.
  (ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (iii) of  this  paragraph,  no
 interest  shall be due on any such unpaid additional contributions which
 are not attributable to the period prior to the first full payroll peri-
 od referred to in paragraph two of this subdivision.

 [twenty-year/age fifty] TWENTY-YEAR retirement program in its membership
 may,  consistent  with  the  provisions  of this subdivision, promulgate

 such  contributions,  and  any  interest thereon, from the participant's
 compensation).

 ant  to  paragraph  three  of this subdivision has not been paid in full
 before the effective date of retirement, that participant shall  not  be
 eligible to retire pursuant to subdivision c of this section.
  6.  Where a contribution deficiency chargeable to a participant pursu-
 ant to paragraph three of this subdivision has not  been  paid  in  full
 before the date of discontinuance of service, that participant shall not
 be  entitled  to  a deferred vested benefit pursuant to subdivision d of
 this section.
  7. Where a participant has not paid in full any contribution deficien-
 cy chargeable to him or her pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivi-
 sion, and a benefit, other than a refund of member contributions  pursu-
 ant  to  section  six  hundred  thirteen  of this article or a refund of
 additional member contributions pursuant  to  paragraph  eight  of  this
 subdivision, becomes payable under this article to the participant or to
 his or her designated beneficiary or estate, the actuarial equivalent of
 any  such  unpaid  amount  shall  be deducted from the benefit otherwise
 payable.
  7-a. Notwithstanding paragraph six or seven of this subdivision, where
 a deficiency chargeable to a participant pursuant to paragraph three  of
 this  subdivision  has  not been paid in full while the participant is a
 Triborough bridge and tunnel member and such participant  retires  prior
 to  July  first,  two  thousand eleven, such participant may elect to be
 covered by this paragraph. Such participant shall  be  entitled  to  the
 benefits provided in subdivision c of this section provided that partic-
 ipant  authorizes  the retirement system to deduct from such benefits an
 amount which will result in the deficiency, plus associated interest  to
 date  of final payment, being paid in full no later than July first, two
 thousand eleven or such earlier date as agreed to  by  the  participant.
 Such  amount  will be deducted in equal installments on a monthly basis.
 Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the participant  from  making  a
 partial  payment  of the amount of the deficiency at the time of retire-
 ment so as to reduce the monthly payment nor to make a lump sum  payment
 equal  to  the amount of the total unpaid balance at any time during the
 period of repayment.
  8. (i) Such additional member contributions (and any interest thereon)
 shall be paid into the contingent reserve fund of the retirement  system
 of  which  the  participant is a member and shall not for any purpose be
 deemed to be member contributions  or  accumulated  contributions  of  a
 member  under  section six hundred thirteen of this article or otherwise
 while he or she is a participant in the [twenty-year/age fifty]  TWENTY-
 YEAR  retirement  program  or  otherwise, except that, a surplus of such
 A. 6571  6

 additional member  contributions  that  are  paid  into  the  retirement
 system's  contingent  reserve  fund  may be used for the sole purpose of
 offsetting a deficit of basic member contributions.
  (ii)  Should  a participant in the [twenty-year/age fifty] TWENTY-YEAR
 retirement program who has rendered less than fifteen years of allowable
 service as a Triborough bridge and tunnel member cease to hold  a  posi-
 tion as a Triborough bridge and tunnel member for any reason whatsoever,
 his  or her accumulated additional member contributions made pursuant to
 this subdivision (together with any interest thereon paid to the retire-
 ment system) may be withdrawn by  him  or  her  pursuant  to  procedures
 promulgated  in  regulations  of the board of trustees of the retirement
 system, together with interest thereon at the rate of five  percent  per
 annum, compounded annually.
  (iii)  Except  as  provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, no
 member, while he or she is a participant  or  otherwise,  shall  have  a
 right  to  withdraw such additional member contributions or any interest
 thereon from the retirement system.
  9. A member who has made the  additional  contributions  specified  by
 this subdivision may borrow a portion of such contributions, pursuant to
 the provisions of section six hundred thirteen-b of this article.

  20.  Bridge  and  tunnel  officers,  sergeants  [and],  lieutenants,
 CAPTAINS, INSPECTORS, DEPUTY CHIEFS, ASSISTANT CHIEFS, AND CHIEFS of the
 Triborough bridge and tunnel authority.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that:
  (a) section one of this act shall take effect on the one hundred twen-
 tieth day after it shall have become a law, provided that the Triborough
 bridge  and tunnel authority has elected prior to such effective date to
 provide its employees the retirement incentive authorized by this act by
 resolution of its governing body specifying which  titles  and/or  ranks
 are  covered  by  such  election  as  amongst  those titles and/or ranks
 already covered by section 604-c of the retirement and  social  security
 law;  provided,  however,  if the Triborough bridge and tunnel authority
 shall not elect by resolution to provide its  employees  the  retirement
 incentive authorized by this act during the time period required by this
 subdivision, section one of this act shall be deemed repealed; and
  (b) the Triborough bridge and tunnel authority shall notify the legis-
 lative  bill drafting commission on whether it has elected by resolution
 to provide its employees the retirement incentive authorized by this act
 within the time period required by subdivision (a) of  this  section  in
 order  that the commission may maintain an accurate and timely effective
 data base of the official text of the laws of the state of New  York  in
 furtherance of effectuating the provisions of section 44 of the legisla-
 tive law and section 70-b of the public officers law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL:  This proposed legislation, as it relates to Tier 4
 and Tier 6 members of the New York  City  Employees'  Retirement  System
 (NYCERS) who are members of the respective TBTA 20/50 Plans, would amend
 Section 604-c of the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to remove
 age 50 as an eligibility requirement for service retirement.
  Effective  Date:  Upon  enactment,  provided,  however,  that it shall
 become effective on the 120th day after enactment in the event the  TBTA
 elects  by  resolution to provide to its employees the retirement incen-
 tive authorized by the bill within such 120-day period.
 A. 6571  7
 
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS: Currently, members of the Tier 4 and Tier  6  TBTA
 20/50  Plans  are  eligible to receive a service retirement benefit upon
 attaining 20 or more years of  credited  service  and  age  50.  Tier  4
 members  who leave employment with at least five, but less than 20 years
 of  service, are eligible to receive a vested retirement benefit payable
 on the date they would have attained 20 years of  credited  service  and
 age 50. Tier 6 members who leave employment with at least five, but less
 than  20  years  of  credited  service  are eligible to receive a vested
 retirement benefit payable at age 63.
  Under the proposed legislation, if enacted, affected  members  of  the
 TBTA 20/50 Plans would be eligible to receive a service retirement bene-
 fit  upon attaining 20 years of credited service, without regard to age.
 Tier 4 members who leave employment with at least five, but less than 20
 years of credited service, would be eligible to receive a vested retire-
 ment benefit payable on the date the  member  would  have  completed  20
 years  of  credited  service,  without regard to age. Tier 6 members who
 leave employment with at least five, but less than 20 years of  credited
 service  would  continue  to  be eligible to receive a vested retirement
 benefit payable at age 63.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - PRESENT VALUES: Based on the anticipated  group  of
 members  benefiting  from  the change in the eligibility requirement and
 the actuarial assumptions and methods described herein, the enactment of
 this proposed legislation would increase the  Present  Value  of  Future
 Benefits (PVFB) by approximately $5.6 million for TBTA.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to NYCERS, there would be  an  increase  in  the  Unfunded
 Accrued  Liability  (UAL)  of  approximately  $7.0  million  offset by a
 decrease in the Present Value of future employer  Normal  Cost  of  $1.4
 million.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL  EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: The enactment of
 this proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in  annual
 employer  contributions  for TBTA of approximately $1.7 million which is
 the result of an increase in the Normal Cost  in  addition  to  the  UAL
 payment.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The 92 NYCERS Tier 4 members as of June 30, 2022 who could potentially
 benefit  from  the  change in the eligibility requirement for retirement
 had an average age of  approximately  42.5  years,  average  service  of
 approximately  16.8  years,  and  an  average  salary  of  approximately
 $115,400. As of June 30, 2022, there are no active members in the Tier 6
 TBTA 20/50 Plan.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods in effect
 for the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions  of  NYCERS.
 For  the  purposes  of  this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 valuation  of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
 A. 6571  8
 
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The initial additional administrative costs of NYCERS and other New
 York City agencies to implement the proposed legislation.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit (OPEB) costs.
  *  The  amendment  to include enumerated titles in the Criminal Proce-
 dural law.

 Actuary  for,  and  independent of, the New York City Retirement Systems
 and Pension Funds. I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries  and  a
 Member of the American Academy of Actuaries. I am a member of NYCERS but
