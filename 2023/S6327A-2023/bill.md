 AN ACT to amend the executive law  and  the  environmental  conservation
  law,  in  relation to establishing new targets for offshore wind elec-
  tricity generation
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 94-c of the exec-

  (b) "CLCPA targets" shall mean the public policies established in  the
 climate  leadership  and community protection act enacted in chapter one
 hundred six of the laws of two thousand nineteen, including the require-
 ment that a minimum of seventy percent of the statewide electric  gener-
 ation  be  produced  by renewable energy systems by two thousand thirty,
 that by the year two thousand  forty  the  statewide  electrical  demand
 system  will  generate  zero  emissions  and the procurement of at least
 [nine gigawatts] NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS of  offshore  wind
 electricity  generation  by  two  thousand thirty-five, AT LEAST FIFTEEN
 THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND ELECTRICITY GENERATION
 BY TWO THOUSAND FORTY, AT LEAST EIGHTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF  OFFSHORE
 WIND  ELECTRICITY  GENERATION  BY  TWO  THOUSAND FORTY-FIVE AND AT LEAST
 TWENTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND ELECTRICITY GENERATION BY TWO
 THOUSAND FIFTY, six gigawatts of photovoltaic solar  generation  by  two
 thousand  twenty-five and to support three gigawatts of statewide energy
 storage capacity by two thousand thirty.

 ronmental conservation law, as added by chapter 106 of the laws of 2019,

  e.  Measures  to  achieve  six  gigawatts  of distributed solar energy
 capacity installed in the state by two thousand twenty-five, nine [giga-
 watts]  THOUSAND  NINE  HUNDRED  MEGAWATTS  of  offshore  wind  capacity
 installed  by  two thousand thirty-five, AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT
 HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND ELECTRICITY GENERATION BY  TWO  THOU-
 SAND  FORTY,  AT  LEAST  EIGHTEEN  THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF  OFFSHORE WIND
 ELECTRICITY  GENERATION  BY  TWO  THOUSAND FORTY-FIVE AND AT LEAST TWEN-
 TY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND  ELECTRICITY  GENERATION  BY  TWO
 THOUSAND FIFTY, a statewide energy efficiency goal of one hundred eight-
 y-five  trillion  British  thermal  units  energy reduction from the two
 thousand twenty-five forecast; and three gigawatts of  statewide  energy
 storage capacity by two thousand thirty.
  §  3.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that
 the amendments to section 94-c of the executive law, made by section one
