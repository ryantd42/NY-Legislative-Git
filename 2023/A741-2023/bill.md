 ness and commercial purposes. Whenever the authority deems it to  be  in
 the  public  interest,  the  authority may lease any such project or any
 part or parts thereof or contract for the management and operation ther-
 eof  or  of any part or parts thereof. Any such lease or contract may be
 for a period of not exceeding ten years, or,  if  any  of  the  revenues
 therefrom  are  or  are to be pledged to secure bonds then such lease or
 contract may be for a period extending not later by more than  one  year
 than the last maturity of such bonds.
  §  2.  Subdivision  3 of section 563 of the public authorities law, as
 amended by chapter 558 of the laws  of  2010,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  3.  The state of New York does pledge to and agree with the holders of
 any bonds that no tunnel, bridge, parkway, causeway, street, road, high-
 way or other connection for vehicular traffic, which will be competitive
 with the [Queens Midtown] JANE MATILDA BOLIN tunnel or the Hugh L. Carey
 tunnel or the Brooklyn Richmond tunnel or the  Narrows  bridge  will  be
 constructed;  provided that a tunnel, bridge, parkway, causeway, street,
 road, highway or other connection for vehicular traffic shall be consid-
 ered as competitive if it shall form a connection for vehicular  traffic
 over,  under or across the East river south of Queensboro bridge, or, if
 it shall form a connection for vehicular traffic between the boroughs of
 Manhattan, Brooklyn or Richmond over, under or across New York bay.  The
 covenant  herein  contained  restricting competitive traffic connections
 with any project or projects shall be only for the benefit of the  hold-
 ers  of  bonds secured in whole or in part by the pledge of the revenues
 of such project or projects and subject to and in  accordance  with  all
 contract  provisions  with  respect  to any bonds outstanding on January
 first, nineteen hundred fifty-five and the rights of the holders of such
