 Introduced  by  Sen. HINCHEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Agriculture
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets  law,  in  relation  to  the
  licensing of home kitchen operations
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Short title. This act shall be known and may be  cited  as
 the "home kitchen enterprise and economic opportunity act".
  §  2.  Legislative  intent.  Every  day, New Yorkers are using their
 skills, talents and creativity to build home kitchen-based businesses to
 provide unique, quality food products, increasingly sourced using  local
 ingredients  for  direct  sale  to  consumers, farmers markets and other
 retail outlets. By practicing and perfecting  their  products,  many  of
 these  craft culinary enterprises have succeeded and grown into thriving
 and vibrant small businesses, creating jobs and supporting local  econo-
 mies  and local farmers. It is the legislature's intent that home kitch-
 en-based food entrepreneurs should be supported and encouraged in  their
 efforts. Homemade food businesses can create significant economic oppor-
 tunities  for  New  Yorkers  that need them most--including women, immi-
 grants, and people of color, who have  historically  faced  barriers  to
 labor  force  participation  and  entrepreneurship and many of whom have
 lost employment in the food industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandem-
 ic. The home kitchen enterprise and economic opportunity act  modernizes
 regulations  impacting these enterprises and reduces artificial barriers
 to business growth, while preserving food safety and public health.
  § 3.  The agriculture and markets law is amended by adding a new arti-
 cle 22-A to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 22-A
  HOME KITCHEN OPERATIONS
 SECTION 265. DEFINITIONS.
  266. LICENSES; FEES.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
