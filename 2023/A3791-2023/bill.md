  § 11-108. LIABILITY  OF  PAYROLL  PROCESSING  COMPANY.  1.  FOR  THE
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "PAYROLL PROCESSING COMPANY" MEANS A PERSON OR
 BUSINESS ENTITY UNDER CONTRACT TO  AN  EMPLOYER  THAT:  (A)  CALCULATES,
 PROCESSES  AND  PRODUCES WAGE PAYMENTS TO THE EMPLOYER'S EMPLOYEES UNDER

 FEDERAL EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER; AND (D) CONDITIONS WAGE PAYMENTS
 TO THE EMPLOYER'S EMPLOYEES ON THE ADVANCE RECEIPT OF  FUNDS  FROM  SUCH
 EMPLOYER  TO  FULLY  COVER  SUCH  WAGE  PAYMENTS.  A PERSON ACTING AS AN
 EMPLOYER UNDER 26 U.S.C. 3401(D)(1) THAT OTHERWISE MEETS THE  DEFINITION
 OF  A PAYROLL PROCESSING COMPANY SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED A PAYROLL PROC-

 SUBJECT  TO  A  COLLECTIVE  BARGAINING  AGREEMENT  AND  SUCH  COLLECTIVE
 BARGAINING AGREEMENT EXPRESSLY PROVIDES FOR THE RECOVERY OF UNPAID, LOST
 OR STOLEN WAGES.
  2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION  OF  LAW  TO  THE  CONTRARY,  A
 PAYROLL  PROCESSING  COMPANY  THAT  INTENTIONALLY AND WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE
 PREVENTS THE REMITTANCE OF TAXES OR PAYMENT OF  WAGES  PURSUANT  TO  THE
 CONTRACT WITH THE EMPLOYER SHALL BE LIABLE TO AN EMPLOYEE OF THE EMPLOY-
 ER THAT FAILED TO RECEIVE AN OWED PAYMENT WITHIN ONE BUSINESS DAY OF THE
