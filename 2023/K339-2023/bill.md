  HONORING  Firefighter  John  C.  Fowlston upon the
  occasion of his  designation  as  recipient  of  the

  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted to our noble firefighters who exhibit courage and bravery every
day in the course of their duties; and

the strength of the American spirit through actions of the  most  heroic

and recognition by all citizens of this great country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
John  C.  Fowlston  upon the occasion of his designation as recipient of
the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Norwich  Fire  Department,  to  be
celebrated  at  the  Norwich  Fire  Department Award Dinner on Saturday,
April 29, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighter John C. Fowlston has consistently  demonstrated
a  level of commitment, dedication, integrity, and professionalism which

and a 3rd Assistant Chief, and has great knowledge and useful experience
with maintenance on the trucks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected men and women are often the first
to  respond  to  an  emergency,  whether  the  emergency  is  a  fire,
transportation  accident,  natural  disaster,  act of terrorism, medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and

service,  he  heroically  performed,  above and beyond the call of duty,
those responsibilities which define the task of  fire  protection;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Firefighter John C. Fowlston upon the occasion of his  designation
as  recipient  of  the  Lifetime  Achievement  Award by the Norwich Fire
Department; and be it further
