 Introduced  by  Sen.  CLEARE -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Housing, Construction  and
  Community Development
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seven-
  ty-four, the administrative code of the city of New York and the  real
  property tax law, in relation to reporting rent concessions
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent and findings.  The legislature finds and
 declares that the use of rental concessions in  rent  stabilized  apart-
 ments  to charge one rent to tenants while reporting another rent to the
 division of housing and community renewal undermines the purposes of the
 rent stabilization laws. The rent stabilization laws, as currently writ-
 ten, should be interpreted to find the use of rental concessions  equiv-
 alent  to  the creation of a preferential rent.  It is the intent of the
 legislature to clarify that, for the purposes of  the  emergency  tenant
 protection  act  of  nineteen seventy-four or any successor legislation,
 the amount of rent charged to and paid by  the  tenant  or  any  initial
 adjusted monthly rent charged and paid refers to the net effective rent,
 which  sum shall reflect the value of any rental concession. In order to
 effectuate the meaning and intent of the rent stabilization laws,  rents
 reported  to  the division should equal the net effective rent paid by a
 tenant based upon the value of any and  all  concessions,  and  in  this
 respect  the  application  of  the  law will be facilitated by including
 rental concessions and their value in annual  rent  registration  state-
 ments.
  §  2. Subdivision f of section 12-a of section 4 of chapter 576 of the
 laws of 1974, constituting the emergency tenant protection act of  1974,
 as  added  by  chapter  403  of  the laws of 1983, is amended to read as
 follows:

  f. An annual statement shall be filed containing the current rent  for
 each  unit and such other information contained in subdivision a of this

 each tenant then in occupancy with a copy of that portion of such annual
 statement as pertains to the tenant's unit.  SUCH ANNUAL STATEMENT SHALL
 ALSO CONTAIN INFORMATION RELATING TO ANY AND ALL CONCESSIONS GRANTED FOR
 A  UNIT  AND, IN ANY CASE WHERE A CONCESSION INCLUDES A DISCOUNT ON RENT
 PAID FOR A UNIT BY THE TENANT, THE CURRENT RENT FOR EACH  UNIT  REPORTED
 BY THE OWNER TO THE DIVISION SHALL EQUAL THE NET EFFECTIVE RENT FOR SUCH
 UNIT BASED UPON THE VALUE OF SUCH CONCESSION.
  (1)  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SUBDIVISION, THE TERM "CONCESSION" SHALL
 MEAN ANY TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT TO A LEASE INTENDED TO INDUCE A TENANT  TO

 AN UNEXPIRED LEASE AND ANY RELATED RIDER OR AGREEMENT.
  § 3.  Subdivision f of section 26-517 of the  administrative  code  of
 the city of New York is amended to read as follows:

 UNIT BASED UPON THE VALUE OF SUCH CONCESSION.

 MEAN  ANY TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT TO A LEASE INTENDED TO INDUCE A TENANT TO

 DISCOUNT,  WAIVER, LICENSE AGREEMENT, PRORATION, MONEY PAYMENT, OR PHYS-
 ICAL GOOD OR SERVICE OR ACCESS THERETO.
  (2) FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS  SUBDIVISION,  THE  TERM  "NET  EFFECTIVE
 RENT"  SHALL  MEAN  THE  AVERAGE  MONTHLY  RENT CHARGED TO AND PAID BY A
 TENANT OVER THE DURATION OF A TENANT'S OCCUPANCY OF A UNIT  PURSUANT  TO
 AN UNEXPIRED LEASE AND ANY RELATED RIDER OR AGREEMENT.
  §  4. Every owner of housing accommodations subject to section 12-a of
 the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four or  section
 26-517  of  the  administrative code of the city of New York shall amend
 the annual statement filed pursuant to subdivision f of such  applicable
 section  for  the  year  2021  and,  if applicable, for the year 2022 to
 include information required to be reported pursuant to section  two  or
 three of this act relating to concessions granted on a rental unit on or
 after  March  1,  2021.  Such amended statement shall be filed with the
 filing of the next annual statement or January  1,  2024,  whichever  is
 sooner.  If  an annual statement was not filed for the year 2021 or 2022
 prior to the effective date of this act, then the provisions of sections
 two and three of this act shall apply to the next filing,  and  informa-
 tion  relating  to concessions granted on rental units on or after March
 1, 2021 shall be included in such annual statement.
