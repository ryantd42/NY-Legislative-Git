 AN ACT to amend the general obligations law, in relation to the  liabil-
  ity of electronic marketplaces for compensation for damages for defec-
  tive goods

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The general obligations law is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 11-108 to read as follows:
  §  11-108.  LIABILITY  OF ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACES FOR COMPENSATION FOR
 DAMAGES FOR DEFECTIVE GOODS. 1. AS USED IN THIS SECTION:
  (A) "ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE PROVIDER" MEANS A PERSON WHO, PURSUANT  TO
 AN  AGREEMENT  WITH  A MARKETPLACE SELLER, SELLS OR FACILITATES SALES OF
 TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY BY SUCH MARKETPLACE SELLER OR SELLERS VIA  AN
 INTERNET  WEBSITE, ONLINE CATALOG, MOBILE APPLICATION, OR SIMILAR FORUM.
 "ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE PROVIDER" INCLUDES ANY SUBSIDIARIES  OR  RELATED
 PARTY  COMPANIES. A PERSON "FACILITATES SALES OF TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROP-
 ERTY" FOR PURPOSES OF THIS PARAGRAPH WHEN  THE  PERSON  MEETS  BOTH  THE
 FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:
  (I) SUCH PERSON PROVIDES THE FORUM IN WHICH, OR BY MEANS OF WHICH, THE
 SALE TAKES PLACE OR THE OFFER OF SALE IS ACCEPTED, INCLUDING AN INTERNET
 SHOP, STORE, BOOTH, APPLICATION, WEBSITE, CATALOG, OR SIMILAR FORUM; AND
  (II)  SUCH PERSON OR AN AFFILIATE OF SUCH PERSON COLLECTS THE RECEIPTS
 PAID BY A CUSTOMER TO A  MARKETPLACE  SELLER  FOR  A  SALE  OF  TANGIBLE
 PERSONAL  PROPERTY,  OR  CONTRACTS  WITH  A  THIRD PARTY TO COLLECT SUCH
 RECEIPTS.
  (B) "HANDMADE" MEANS A PRODUCT THAT CONFORMS TO ALL  APPLICABLE  STATE
 AND  FEDERAL  CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND IS MADE BY THE MARKET-
 PLACE SELLER IN THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF THE MARKETPLACE SELLER, SO LONG
 AS THE MARKETPLACE SELLER'S SALES OF  HANDMADE  PRODUCTS  GENERATE  LESS
 THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR IN REVENUES.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 6437  2
 
  (C) "MARKETPLACE SELLER" MEANS ANY PERSON WHO HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH AN
 ELECTRONIC  MARKETPLACE  PROVIDER UNDER WHICH THE ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE
 PROVIDER WILL FACILITATE SALES OF TANGIBLE  PERSONAL  PROPERTY  BY  SUCH
 PERSON WITHIN THE MEANING OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (D)  "PRODUCT" MEANS A TANGIBLE GOOD THAT IS SUBJECT TO STRICT PRODUCT
 LIABILITY LAW.
  2. AN ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE PROVIDER SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A RETAILER
 FOR PURPOSES OF NEW YORK STRICT LIABILITY  LAW  AND  SHALL  BE  STRICTLY
 LIABLE  FOR  ALL  DAMAGES  CAUSED  BY DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS PLACED INTO THE
 STREAM OF COMMERCE TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT A RETAILER OF THAT  DEFECTIVE
 PRODUCT  WOULD  BE  LIABLE.  THE  LIABILITY OF AN ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE
 PROVIDER SHALL BE EQUAL TO, BUT NOT GREATER THAN,  THE  LIABILITY  OF  A
 RETAILER,  AND ALL DEFENSES TO STRICT LIABILITY THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER
 NEW YORK LAW, EXCEPT AS MODIFIED BY THIS SECTION, SHALL BE PRESERVED FOR
 ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE PROVIDERS.
  3. THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY:
  (A) WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT;
  (B) REGARDLESS OF  WHETHER  THE  ELECTRONIC  MARKETPLACE  PROVIDER  OR
 MARKETPLACE SELLER HAS A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE; AND
  (C)  REGARDLESS  OF  WHETHER  THE ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE PROVIDER EVER
 TOOK PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF, OR TITLE TO, THE PRODUCT.
  4. AN ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE PROVIDER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE AS DESCRIBED
 IN SUBDIVISION TWO OF THIS SECTION IF ANY OF  THE  FOLLOWING  CONDITIONS
 ARE MET:
  (A) THE PRODUCT THAT CAUSED THE DAMAGE WAS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
  (I)  PREOWNED  OR USED AND PROMINENTLY DESCRIBED OR PROMINENTLY ADVER-
 TISED IN THE ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE PROVIDER AS PREOWNED OR USED AT  THE
 TIME IT WAS PURCHASED BY THE CONSUMER; OR
  (II) HANDMADE; OR
  (III) CUSTOM-MADE.
  (B)  THE  ELECTRONIC  MARKETPLACE PROVIDER DID NOT RECEIVE A DIRECT OR
 INDIRECT FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM THE SALE OF THE DEFECTIVE  PRODUCT  THAT
 CAUSED THE INJURY. A FEE THAT IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR AN ADVERTISEMENT IS NOT
 A "FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM THE SALE OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT."
  5. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION,
 AN ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE PROVIDER SHALL BE STRICTLY LIABLE FOR THE SALE
 OF  PREOWNED,  USED,  HANDMADE, OR CUSTOM-MADE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS IF THE
 APPLICATION OF STRICT LIABILITY TO THE ELECTRONIC  MARKETPLACE  PROVIDER
 IS  CONSISTENT  WITH THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS UNDERLYING STRICT PRODUCT
 LIABILITY.
  6. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO LIMIT OR IMPAIR  ANY  CAUSE  OF
 ACTION  AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW AVAILABLE TO A
 PERSON INJURED AS A RESULT OF A PRODUCT. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS  SECTION
 SHALL  BE IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER RIGHT OF ACTION OR RECOVERY OTHERWISE
 AVAILABLE UNDER THE LAW.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
