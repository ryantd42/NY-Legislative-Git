  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Be Kind to Animals Month in  the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Millions  of  animals  across  New York and throughout the
United States are abused, abandoned and neglected; and
 
  WHEREAS, Animal abuse and neglect result  in  unnecessary  pain  and
suffering; it is imperative that we encourage empathy and compassion for
animals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Our efforts to promote environmental conservation, protect
endangered species, prevent habitat destruction and global warming  must
be achieved; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Encouraging  kindness  to  animals  will  promote  humane
treatment, respect for the role of animals in nature, and  the  need  to
control  the  overpopulation  of  animals,  which  leads  to  needless
euthanasia and the suffering of animals; and
 
  WHEREAS, A designated time period for the awareness of  animal  care
and  broader  societal goals will serve as an educational tool to impart
relevant knowledge in students and adults alike; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Be Kind to
Animals Month in the State of New York, and to  encourage  students  and
educational  organizations  statewide  to  participate  in  trainings,
activities and other programming; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
