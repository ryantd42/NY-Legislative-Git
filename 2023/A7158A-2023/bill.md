 AN ACT to establish a moratorium on the installation of  synthetic  turf
  pending  a  comprehensive  environmental  and public health study; and
  providing for the repeal of certain provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative findings. The legislature finds that increas-
 ingly, synthetic turf is being installed in many locations in  New  York
 state, including parks, athletic fields and other settings where natural
 grass  was previously grown. In recent years, crumb rubber fill is being
 used as a component of synthetic turf and mulch.  Crumb  rubber  is  the
 result  of  processing  waste  tires, which contain numerous components,
 some of which are known to be hazardous to people and  the  environment.
 The hazardous components include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, vana-
 dium, zinc and acetone. Health effects associated with these components,
 at  dangerous  levels,  include  birth  defects,  cancer, nervous system
 damage and immune system suppression. While various  options  for  waste
 tire  use  are essential to reducing the significant stockpiles of waste
 tires, such uses should not threaten or compromise public health.
  The legislature finds that more information is necessary  to  make  an
 informed  decision  on the appropriate uses of synthetic turf containing
 crumb rubber. In the interest of preventing adverse health  impacts  and
 contamination to natural resources, the legislature finds that a compre-
 hensive  environmental  and public health study on the potential threats
 associated with the use of synthetic turf is warranted.
  Therefore, the legislature finds that it  is  consistent  with  public
 policy  to  require  such  comprehensive environmental and public health
 study to be undertaken immediately; and, in the meantime, to temporarily

 suspend the installation of synthetic turf products that  contain  crumb
 rubber.
  §  2.  Moratorium  on  the installation of synthetic turf. 1.  Defi-
 nitions. For the purposes of this act, the following  terms  shall  have
 the following definitions:
  a.  "Crumb rubber" means ground rubber derived from waste tires, which
 contain one or more of  the  following  ingredients:  arsenic,  cadmium,
 chromium, lead, vanadium, zinc, and acetone;
  b.  "Synthetic  turf" means any materials or compositions that include
 crumb rubber as a component used in place of  grass  to  surface  parks,
 outdoor  playing or athletic fields, indoor athletic facilities or other
 venues.
  2. Moratorium. A moratorium is hereby established on the  installation
 of  synthetic turf on public property located within a city with a popu-
 lation of one million or more that is also located  within  a  disadvan-
 taged  community  established  under  the  criteria set forth in section
 75-0111 of the environmental conservation law for a period of  6  months
 from  the effective date of this act or until the department of environ-
 mental conservation reports to the governor and the legislature  on  its
 findings and recommendations as required in section three of this act.
  § 3. Study of the use of synthetic turf. 1. The department of environ-
 mental conservation, in cooperation with the department of health, shall
 immediately  undertake  a  review  of all available data relating to the
 potential environmental and health risks and effects of synthetic  turf,
 with  particular attention to the crumb rubber content of such synthetic
 turf.
  2. The commissioner of  environmental  conservation,  or  his  or  her
 designee, shall:
  a. Solicit input from environmental and public health specialists, and
 other stakeholders in an open, public process;
  b. Examine various routes of exposure and the health and environmental
 impact  of  these  pathways  including,  but  not limited to, small fill
 particle inhalation, volatility, leaching to groundwater, dermal absorp-
 tion, and persistence in the environment  of  original  and  degradation
 by-products;
  c. Prepare a report to the governor and the legislature which includes
 research  and  studies conducted on synthetic turf which were the source
 of the report findings and recommendations for appropriate and  inappro-
 priate  use of synthetic turf, crumb rubber and waste tires. Such report
 shall be filed within six months of the  effective  date  of  this  act,
 unless  the commissioner of environmental conservation requests in writ-
 ing, an extension of time; and
  d. Conduct an outreach program to inform  local  governments,  private
 organizations,  schools  and  the  public regarding the findings of such
 report. If necessary, information on safe alternatives to synthetic turf
 in settings where this material is a potential  or  actual  health  risk
 should be disseminated to the public.
  3.  All  other  departments  or  agencies of the state or subdivisions
 thereof, and local governments shall, at the request of the commissioner
 of environmental conservation, provide expertise, assistance,  and  data
 that  will  enable  such commissioner to carry out his or her powers and
 duties.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately;  (a)  provided,  however,
 that sections two and three of this act shall continue in full force and
 effect  for six months from such effective date, or until the department
 of environmental conservation reports to the governor and  the  legisla-

 ture  as required by section three of this act, whichever date is later,
 when upon such date the provisions of sections two and three of this act
 shall be deemed repealed; and
  (b) provided that the commissioner of environmental conservation shall
 notify  the  legislative bill drafting commission upon filing the report
 required in section three of this act in order that the  commission  may
 maintain an accurate and timely effective data base of the official text
 of  the laws of the state of New York in furtherance of effectuating the
 provisions of section 44 of the legislative law and section 70-b of  the
 public officers law.
