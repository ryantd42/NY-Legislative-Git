  4. THE COMMISSION MAY AWARD A PRIZE FOR  A  TREATMENT  OR  THERAPEUTIC
 PROTOCOL  THAT  YIELDS  A SURVIVAL RATE THAT IS LESS THAN WHAT IS ESTAB-

 DEVASTATING DISEASES, THE COMPACT WILL RESPECT THE LAWS OF EACH  OF  THE
 UNITED  STATES  BY  ADOPTING  RULES THAT ESTABLISH ETHICAL STANDARDS FOR
 RESEARCH THAT SHALL BE FOLLOWED IN ORDER FOR A PRIZE TO BE CLAIMED.  THE
 COMPACT, IN THE RULES, SHALL ESTABLISH A COMMON SET OF ETHICAL STANDARDS
 THAT EMBODIES THE LAWS AND RESTRICTIONS IN EACH OF THE STATES SO THAT TO
 BE  ELIGIBLE  FOR CLAIMING A PRIZE THE ENTITY SUBMITTING A CURE MUST NOT
 HAVE VIOLATED ANY OF THE ETHICAL STANDARDS  IN  ANY  ONE  OF  THE  FIFTY
 STATES,  WHETHER  THE STATES HAVE JOINED THE COMPACT OR NOT. THE COMPACT
 WILL PUBLISH THESE COMMON ETHICAL  STANDARDS  ALONG  WITH  THE  SPECIFIC
 CRITERIA  FOR  A CURE FOR EACH OF THE DISEASES THE COMPACT HAS TARGETED.
 SO LONG AS A RESEARCHER FOLLOWS THE COMMON ETHICAL STANDARDS  IN  EFFECT
 AT  THE  TIME  THE RESEARCH IS DONE, AN ENTITY PRESENTING A CURE WILL BE
 DEEMED TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE STANDARDS. ON OR  BEFORE  JANUARY  FIRST  OF
 EACH YEAR, THE COMPACT SHALL REVIEW ALL STATE LAWS TO DETERMINE IF ADDI-
 TIONAL  ETHICAL  STANDARDS  HAVE BEEN ENACTED BY ANY OF THE FIFTY STATES
 AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ANY CHANGES TO THE COMMON ETHICAL  STANDARDS
 RULES  BASED  ON  NEW  STATE  LAWS SHALL BE ADOPTED AND PUBLISHED BY THE
 COMPACT, BUT SHALL NOT TAKE EFFECT IN CURE  CRITERIA  FOR  A  PERIOD  OF
 THREE YEARS TO ALLOW FOR SUFFICIENT NOTICE TO RESEARCHERS.
  7. ALL RULES MAY BE AMENDED AS THE COMMISSION SEES NECESSARY.

 CONFORMS TO THE MODEL STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT OF 1981 BY  THE
 UNIFORM  LAW  COMMISSIONERS,  AS  AMENDED,  AS MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO THE
 OPERATIONS OF THE COMMISSION.
  9. IN THE EVENT THE COMMISSION EXERCISES ITS RULEMAKING AUTHORITY IN A

 POWERS  GRANTED  HEREUNDER,  THEN SUCH RULE SHALL BE INVALID AND HAVE NO
 FORCE AND EFFECT.
