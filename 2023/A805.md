  Section 1. Public health study  of  the  use  of  glyphosate  and  its
 by-product  aminomethylphosphonic  acid.  1.  Definitions.  a.  For  the
 purpose of this section, "glyphosate" shall mean  a  synthetic  compound

 phonic  acid, a synthetic compound that is a metabolite of the herbicide
 glyphosate with a chemical formula of CH6NO3P.
  2. The department of health, in cooperation  with  the  department  of
 environmental  conservation,  shall  conduct  a  study  of the potential
 health risks and effects of glyphosate and AMPA. Such study shall:
  a. review all available data relating to the  potential  health  risks
 and effects of glyphosate and AMPA;
  b. identify safe alternatives to glyphosate and AMPA;
  c.  determine whether the use of glyphosate and AMPA should be permit-
 ted in the state; and

  b. examine various routes of exposure and the health and environmental
 impact of glyphosate and AMPA including, but not limited to, small  fill
 particle inhalation, volatility, leaching to groundwater, dermal absorp-
 tion,  and  persistence  in  the environment of original and degradation
 by-products;
  c. prepare a report to the governor and the legislature which includes
 research  and  studies  conducted  on glyphosate and AMPA which were the
 source of the report findings and recommendations  for  appropriate  and
 inappropriate  use  of  glyphosate  and AMPA. Such report shall be filed
 within one year of the effective date of this act,  unless  the  commis-
 sioner of health requests in writing, an extension of time; and
  d.  conduct  an  outreach program to inform local governments, private
 organizations, schools and the public regarding  the  findings  of  such
 report. If necessary, information on safe alternatives to glyphosate and
 AMPA  in settings where these compounds are a potential or actual health
 risk should be disseminated to the public.
  e. All other departments or agencies  of  the  state  or  subdivisions
 thereof, and local governments shall, at the request of the commissioner
 of health, provide expertise, assistance, and data that will enable such
 commissioner to carry out his or her powers and duties.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect immediately; (a) provided, however,
 that this act shall continue in full force and effect for one year  from
 such  effective  date,  or until the department of health reports to the
 governor and the legislature as required by section  one  of  this  act,
 whichever  date is later, when upon such date the provisions of this act
 shall be deemed repealed; and
  (b) provided that the commissioner of health shall notify the legisla-
 tive bill drafting commission upon filing the report required in section
 one of this act in order that the commission may  maintain  an  accurate
 and  timely  effective data base of the official text of the laws of the
 state of New York in  furtherance  of  effectuating  the  provisions  of
 section  44  of the legislative law and section 70-b of the public offi-
 cers law.
