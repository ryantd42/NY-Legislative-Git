place-based  historical  and  personal  narratives  which  empowered
communities to share their stories of home; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  extraordinary  young  woman  has  demonstrated  how
absolutely critical it is that those whose voices are  often  decentered
and  silenced  have  a  platform  to  share  their  own  stories; she is
steadfastly committed to  ensuring  marginalized  communities  have  the
space  and tools to share their own experiences and narratives, creating
a greater potential for cross cultural connections and for public policy
to be equitable; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  the  Engaged  Humanities  Network  (EHN),  Maggie

connections across these types of initiatives; and

2022 Digital Humanities Summer Institute, a  gathering  of  hundreds  of
scholars,  faculty  and  staff  from  the  arts, humanities, library and
archives communities to share cutting-edge digital humanities work; and
 
  WHEREAS, Maggie Sardino may stand with pride  in  her  achievements,
