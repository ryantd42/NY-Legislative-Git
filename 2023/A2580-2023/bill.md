 AN ACT creating the cellulosic ethanol task force; and providing for the
  repeal of such provisions upon the expiration thereof

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares it necessary to prevent and reduce the production and emanation
 of greenhouse gases and in doing so, finds it necessary to create a task
 force  to  be  known as the "cellulosic ethanol task force" to study and
 advance the production of cellulosic  ethanol  in  furtherance  of  such
 goal.
  As our nation continues to focus on various forms of renewable energy,
 one of the future sources is cellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol is a
 type  of  ethanol  that  is  derived  from cellulose instead of standard
 sugars and starches. The  benefit  of  cellulosic  ethanol  is  that  it
 substantially  reduces  the emission of greenhouse gases even in compar-
 ison to other types of ethanol. This ethanol type can be harvested  from
 crops  grown  within  our  state. It is therefore essential that experts
 provide our state, and our nation, with information  and  recommendation
 of  what  type  of crops can produce such ethanol and where in our state
 such crops are best grown.
  § 2. The commissioner of the department of agriculture and markets  is
 hereby  directed to develop a task force within such department to study
 the feasibility of growing crops for cellulosic ethanol production. This
 task force shall be comprised of no more than nine members. The  members
 shall  be  selected  by the commissioner of agriculture and markets. The
 task force shall, however, include at least one member selected  by  the
 state  soil  and water conservation board and one member selected by the
 commissioner of the department of  environmental  conservation.  There

 shall be no compensation for the members of the task force. The cost for
 attending meetings and additional needs shall be covered by the state.
  A  report of the findings of such study, recommendations of the super-
 intendent of insurance and any proposed legislation necessary to  imple-
 ment such findings shall be filed with the governor, the temporary pres-
 ident of the senate, the speaker of the assembly, the minority leader of
 the  senate,  and  the  minority  leader of the assembly within one year
 after the effective date of this act.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed one year after such date.
