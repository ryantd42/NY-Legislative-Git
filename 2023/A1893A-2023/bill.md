 Introduced by M. of A. JOYNER -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Labor
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the labor law, in relation to enacting the "Empowering
  People in Rights Enforcement (EMPIRE) Worker Protection Act"
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "Empowering People in Rights Enforcement (EMPIRE) Worker  Protection
 Act".
  §  2. Legislative findings. 1. The legislature finds and declares that
 violations of the labor law are often systemic, affecting many workers.
  2. The legislature further finds and declares that despite  the  labor
 law's  strong  protections  for  workers,  limits on the availability of
 public enforcement resources have deleterious effects on the marketplace
 by allowing abuses targeting workers to persist unprosecuted. To  ensure
 the  robust enforcement of the labor law, while minimizing the outlay of
 scarce state funds, this act allows private individuals to bring  public
 enforcement actions in certain contexts in which the state does not have
 the means to fully enforce labor law protections.
  3.  The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of the
 EMPIRE Worker Protection Act is to create a means of empowering citizens
 as private attorneys general to enforce the New York labor law.
  4. The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of  the
 EMPIRE  Worker  Protection  Act  is  to  incentivize  private parties to
 recover civil penalties for the government that otherwise may  not  have
 been  assessed and collected by overburdened state enforcement agencies.
 Such public enforcement actions are  an  efficient  mechanism  to  limit
 systemic  violations,  will  enforce the rights of more workers, and can
 benefit the department of labor with enhanced resources.
  5. The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of  the
 EMPIRE Worker Protection Act is to benefit those employers who are oper-

 ating  within  the labor law, and who, as a result, face unfair competi-
 tion from individuals and entities shirking the labor law.
  6.  The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of the
 EMPIRE Worker Protection Act is to incentivize  labor  organizations  to
 aid working people to report violations of the New York labor law.
  7.  The legislature further finds and declares that the purpose of the
 EMPIRE Worker Protection Act is to facilitate  whistleblowers  suffering
 from  violations of the New York labor law to report abuses without fear
 of retaliation and intimidation.
  8. The legislature further finds and declares that the  EMPIRE  Worker
 Protection  Act  is  part of a history both in New York state and in the
 United States of  laws  enabling  private  citizens  to  aid  in  public
 enforcement in the whistleblower and more recently in the labor context.
 In  similar  qui  tam  legislation  enabling  private citizens to aid in
 public enforcement, the resulting action is in reality a public enforce-
 ment action.

 TIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF THAT THE STATE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO SEEK.
