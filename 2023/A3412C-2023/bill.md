  § 20. ABOLITION OF SLAVERY FOR PERSONS CONVICTED  OF  CRIMES.  NEITHER
 SLAVERY  NOR  INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE SHALL EXIST IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK
 FOR PERSONS CONVICTED OF CRIMES.  NO  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL  IN  ANY
 STATE  OR  LOCAL  PRISON,  PENITENTIARY,  JAIL  OR  REFORMATORY SHALL BE
 COMPELLED OR INDUCED TO PROVIDE LABOR AGAINST HIS OR HER WILL BY  ACTUAL
 OR  THREATENED  FORCE, PUNISHMENT, SEXUAL ASSAULT, OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS
 REASONABLY LIKELY TO CAUSE THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL TO  BELIEVE  THAT
 IF  THEY  DO  NOT  PROVIDE  SUCH LABOR THAT THEY OR ANOTHER PERSON WOULD
 SUFFER PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL OR  MENTAL  HARM,  OR  OTHER  ADVERSE  CONSE-
 QUENCES.
  ANY  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL  WHO VOLUNTARILY PROVIDES LABOR SHALL BE
 ENTITLED TO  COMPENSATION  AND  ALL  LABOR  PROTECTIONS  THAT  WOULD  BE
 PROVIDED  FOR WORK OF A SIMILAR NATURE, BUT FOR SUCH INDIVIDUAL'S CONDI-
 TION OF INCARCERATION. THIS SECTION SHALL BE SELF-EXECUTING.
  § 2. Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing  be  referred
 to  the  first  regular  legislative  session  convening  after the next
 succeeding general election of members of the assembly, and, in conform-
 ity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3
 months previous to the time of such election.
