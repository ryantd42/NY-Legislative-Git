  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision (e) of section 1163 of the vehicle and  traffic
 law,  as added by chapter 388 of the laws of 1970, is amended to read as
 follows:
  (e) The driver of a  vehicle  equipped  with  simultaneously  flashing
 signals  as  provided  for  in  subdivision  eighteen-a of section three
 hundred seventy-five OF THIS CHAPTER shall use such signals when (I) the
 vehicle is stopped or disabled on a public  highway,  except  when  such
 vehicle  is  stopped in compliance with a traffic-control device or when
 legally parked; OR (II) WHEN THE DRIVER IS OPERATING THE  VEHICLE  AT  A

 MAXIMUM SPEED LIMIT.  The driver of a vehicle so equipped may  use  such
 signals  whenever  necessary to warn the operators of following vehicles
 of the presence of a traffic hazard ahead of the signaling  vehicle,  or
 to  warn  the operators of other vehicles that the signaling vehicle may
 itself constitute a traffic hazard,  taking  into  account  traffic  and
 highway  conditions.  No  person  shall  use  such signals for any other
 purpose.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
