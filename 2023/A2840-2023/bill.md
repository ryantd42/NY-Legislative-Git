 MUM TERM OF IMPRISONMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THIRTEEN YEARS.
  § 2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 3 and subdivision 4 of section 70.00

  (b)  For  any  other  felony, the minimum period shall be fixed by the
 court and specified in the sentence and shall be not less than one  year
 nor  more than one-third of the maximum term imposed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
 THE COURT SHALL FIX A MINIMUM PERIOD OF AT  LEAST  TEN  YEARS  WHEN  THE
 SENTENCE  IS  FOR A CONVICTION OF SECTION 195.20 (DEFRAUDING THE GOVERN-

 THE  SECOND  DEGREE);  SECTION  496.05 (CORRUPTING THE GOVERNMENT IN THE
 FIRST DEGREE) OR SECTION 496.06 (PUBLIC CORRUPTION).
  4.  Alternative  definite  sentence for class D and E felonies. When a
 person, other than a second or persistent felony offender  OR  A  PERSON
 SENTENCED  FOR  ANY OF THE CRIMES LISTED IN PARAGRAPH (B) OF SUBDIVISION
 THREE OF THIS SECTION, is sentenced for a class D or class E felony, and
 the court, having regard to the nature and circumstances  of  the  crime
 and  to  the  history  and character of the defendant, is of the opinion
 that a sentence of imprisonment is necessary but that it would be unduly
 harsh to impose an indeterminate or determinate sentence, the court  may
 impose a definite sentence of imprisonment and fix a term of one year or
 less.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
