  4. UPON A SHOWING BY AN EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION,  THE  COMMISSIONER  MAY
 INVESTIGATE  BY  EXAMINING  PAYROLL RECORDS WHETHER AN EMPLOYER WITHHELD
 HOURS OF WORK TO EMPLOYEES FOR THE PURPOSE OF  REDUCING  THE  EMPLOYER'S
 OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS ARTICLE. IF, AFTER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING,
 THE  COMMISSIONER  DETERMINES THAT AN EMPLOYER WITHHELD HOURS OF WORK TO
 EMPLOYEES FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING THE EMPLOYER'S  OBLIGATIONS  UNDER
 THIS  ARTICLE,  THE  COMMISSIONER  MAY, IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER PENALTY
 AVAILABLE, ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE  EMPLOYER  PAY  THE  STANDARD  BENEFITS
 SUPPLEMENT  RATE  TO  ALL OF THE EMPLOYER'S EMPLOYEES, REGARDLESS OF THE

 ARTICLE,  THE COMMISSIONER MAY BRING ANY LEGAL ACTION NECESSARY, INCLUD-
 ING ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION, TO COLLECT SUCH CLAIM, AND THE EMPLOYER SHALL
 BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE UNDERPAYMENT, PLUS COSTS,  AND
 UNLESS THE EMPLOYER PROVES A GOOD FAITH BASIS TO BELIEVE THAT ITS UNDER-
 PAYMENT  WAS  IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW, AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT AS LIQUI-
 DATED DAMAGES. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES SHALL BE CALCULATED BY THE COMMISSION-
 ER AS  NO  MORE  THAN  ONE  HUNDRED  PERCENT  OF  THE  TOTAL  AMOUNT  OF

 EMPLOYEE FILES A COMPLAINT WITH THE  COMMISSIONER  OR  THE  COMMISSIONER
 COMMENCES  AN  INVESTIGATION,  WHICHEVER  IS  EARLIER, UNTIL AN ORDER TO
 COMPLY ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER BECOMES FINAL, OR  WHERE  THE  COMMIS-
 SIONER DOES NOT ISSUE AN ORDER, UNTIL THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMMISSIONER
 NOTIFIES THE COMPLAINANT THAT THE INVESTIGATION HAS CONCLUDED.
  3.  IN  ANY  CIVIL  ACTION BY THE COMMISSIONER, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL
 HAVE THE RIGHT TO COLLECT ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS INCURRED IN  ENFORC-
 ING  ANY  COURT  JUDGMENT. ANY JUDGMENT OR COURT ORDER AWARDING REMEDIES
 UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL PROVIDE THAT IF ANY AMOUNTS REMAIN UNPAID  UPON
 THE  EXPIRATION OF NINETY DAYS FOLLOWING ISSUANCE OF JUDGMENT, OR NINETY
 DAYS AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE TIME TO APPEAL AND NO APPEAL  THEREFROM  IS
 THEN  PENDING,  WHICHEVER  IS  LATER, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT SHALL
 AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE BY FIFTEEN PERCENT.
