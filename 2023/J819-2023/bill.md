  COMMEMORATING the 50th Anniversary of the New York
  State Tug Hill Commission
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those organizations which  are  dedicated  to  increasing
public  awareness of, and appreciation for, the natural resources of New
York,  recognizing  the  role  all  citizens  have  in  protecting  the
environment and the quality of life in this Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the  New  York  State  Tug Hill
Commission; and
 
  WHEREAS, For 50 years, the New York State Tug  Hill  Commission  has
diligently  worked  to  enable local governments, private organizations,
and individuals to shape the future of  the  Tug  Hill  region,  and  to
demonstrate  and  communicate  ways that this can be done by other rural
areas; and
 
  WHEREAS, This small, non-regulatory state  agency  is  charged  with
helping  local governments and citizens shape the future of the Tug Hill
region which includes 41 towns and 18 villages in portions of Jefferson,
Lewis, Oneida and Oswego counties; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Tug Hill Commission was created in 1972,  by  New  York
State  to  recognize  the  importance  of the natural resources that the
regions provide; the New York State  Legislature  passed  the  Tug  Hill
Reserve  Act  in  1992, to further recognize the statewide importance of
the region's natural resources,  and  in  1998,  it  passed  legislation
encouraging  the use of state-held conservation easements on key working
forestlands; and
 
  WHEREAS, Clean water,  healthy  forests,  productive  farms,  stable
communities,  and opportunities for hunting, fishing, and recreation are
important to the residents of  the  Tug  Hill  Region  as  well  as  the
Commission; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The programs and services provided by the Commission offer
technical  assistance  to  local  governments,  economic  development
organizations,  and  other  local groups in land use planning, community
development, and natural resource management; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, the commission provides skill development  and
information  for  local  officials through workshops and issue papers on
various topics; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Tug Hill Commission uses a grassroots approach to  help
create a sound environment and economy for this special, rural region of
New  York State; forestry, farming and recreation are important segments
of the  Tug  Hill  economy  and  are  viable  because  of  the  region's
environment; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of the New York State Tug Hill Commission is in
direct  correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its  Executive Director Katie
Malinowski, her staff, and the Board of Directors whose involvement  is,
and  always  has  been,  characterized  by  an impressive commitment, an
unbridled  enthusiasm,  and  an uncompromising standard of excellence in
all endeavors on behalf of the institution and the community it  serves;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is incumbent upon all citizens to recognize and applaud
the efforts of organizations  such  as  the  New  York  State  Tug  Hill
Commission  which  are  dedicated  to  educating  the  public  about our
special, rural regions of the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the  New  York  State  Tug Hill
Commission; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to Katie Malinowski, Executive Director, New York State Tug
Hill Commission.
