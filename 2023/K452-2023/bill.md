  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  June 2023, as Dairy Month in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Dairy Month in the State
of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National Dairy Month;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Dairy Month began as National Milk Month in 1937,
as a way to promote drinking milk and to  help  stabilize  dairy  demand
when production was at a surplus; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Dairy Month has developed into an annual tradition
celebrating the worldwide contributions of the dairy industry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Dairy  Month  celebrates the safe, healthy, high
quality, and most importantly,  delicious  dairy  products  we  have  in
abundance  in  the United States, thanks to the hard work and commitment
of our dairy farmers; and
 
  WHEREAS, In New York State, agriculture continues to rank as one  of
the top industries, and with dairy farms extending across the State, New
York ranks fifth among states in total milk production; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York has more than 3,500 dairy farms with approximately
625,000  dairy  cows  which  produce more than 15 billion pounds of milk
annually; New York leads the nation in the production of cottage cheese,
yogurt and sour cream; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the New York State Department  of  Agriculture
and  Markets,  the  state saw the loss of almost 300 dairy farms between
2019 and 2020, a statewide cause for concern as  dairy  is  an  integral
part of New York State's agricultural sector and economy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Nearly  half  of  the sales of New York State agricultural
products comes from the direct  sale  of  dairy  products  by  New  York
farmers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  dairy  industry  is  an  integral segment of New York
State's economy and a  major  employer  of  labor  from  all  phases  of
production, through marketing of milk and dairy products; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York's  dairy  farmers  have  historically  been  the
stewards of the land, contributing to the State's  diverse  agricultural
landscapes through responsible conservation practices and investments in
technology; and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York's  milk  and  dairy  products  are  packed  with
important nutrients like calcium, phosphorous, B vitamins, potassium and
Vitamin D, and is an excellent source of protein; consuming  dairy  milk
and  other  dairy  products  may  even  reduce  the  risk for high blood
pressure, osteoporosis and certain cancers, as well as  help  build  and
 
repair  muscle  tissue,  maintain  healthy  skin  and  provide  natural
nutrients; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim June 2023, as Dairy  Month
in  the  State  of New York, and to acknowledge the contributions of the
dairy industry and New York's dairy farmers; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
