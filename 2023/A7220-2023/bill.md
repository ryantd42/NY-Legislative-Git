 EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM PLAN.
  3.  IF THE MEMBER SUBSEQUENTLY RETIRES ON AN AGE-BASED RETIREMENT PLAN

  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would expand the  definition  of  service  creditable  under
 20-year  and  25-year  plans  in the New York State and Local Police and
 Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS) to include service transferred by  any
 police  officer  employed  or  formerly  employed by the Division of Law
 Enforcement in the Department of Environmental Protection in the City of
 New York, provided that such police officer has at least  two  years  of
 such  employment.  The  member  must  elect to obtain the service credit
 within one year of the date on which they first became a member  of  the
 NYSLPFRS or within one year of the effective date of this bill, whichev-
 er  occurs  later. The amount of service credit received in the NYSLPFRS
 shall not exceed the minimum of the amount of service  credited  to  the
 member  in  the New York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) plan
 or 10 years.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023  legislative  session,  it  is
 estimated  that  the past service cost will average approximately 25% of
 an affected member's salary for each year of additional service that  is
 credited  on a 20-year or 25- year plan. This cost will be offset by any
 reserves transferred from the NYCERS. The remaining cost will be  shared
 by  the  State  of  New  York  and  the  participating  employers in the
 NYSLPFRS.
  The exact number of current members as  well  as  future  members  who
 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.

  This  fiscal note does not constitute a legal opinion on the viability
 of the proposed change nor is it intended to serve as a  substitute  for
 the professional judgment of an attorney.
  This  estimate,  dated  February  28,  2023, and intended for use only
 during the  2023  Legislative  Session,  is  Fiscal  Note  No.  2023-87,
 prepared  by  the  Actuary  for  the New York State and Local Retirement
 System.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Section 343  of
 the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) to allow current or former
 New  York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) members employed as
 New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) police  offi-
 cers to transfer, within specified timeframes, to the New York State and
 Local  Police  and  Fire  Retirement  System (PFRS) and receive up to 10
 years of credit in the 20-year and 25-year  Plans  for  such  equal  DEP
 service,  or  full  credit exceeding 10 years in an underlying age-based
 State retirement plan. Employer paid  pension  reserves  would  also  be
 transferred from NYCERS to PFRS for each such transfer.
  Effective Date: Sixty days after enactment.
  BACKGROUND:  Currently, NYCERS members employed as DEP police officers
 who subsequently become employed by the State are eligible  to  transfer
 their  NYCERS  membership  to  PFRS but generally do not receive service
 credit in the 20-year and 25-year PFRS Plans.  Upon successful  applica-
 tion  for transfers between NYCERS and PFRS, member accumulated contrib-
 utions (with accrued interest) are generally transferred but  additional
 employer paid reserves are not.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation, if enacted, DEP police officers who
 served in such title for a minimum of two years and then transfer  their
 NYCERS  membership to PFRS within one year of becoming a PFRS member (or
 one year of the effective date, if later) would receive up to  10  years
 of  credit  in  the  20-year  and  25-year PFRS Plans for such equal DEP
 service, or full credit exceeding 10 years in  an  underlying  age-based
 State  retirement  plan.  This  service would be included in the benefit
 calculation payable by PFRS.
  Additionally, NYCERS would be  required  to  calculate  and  pay  such
 member's  pension  reserve,  net  of  any  accumulated salary deductions
 otherwise transferred, to PFRS.  It should be noted  that  the  proposed
 legislation  does not provide a reciprocal transfer of reserves should a
 member transfer from PFRS to NYCERS.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - OVERVIEW: There is no data  available  to  estimate
 the  number  of  NYCERS  members who would potentially take advantage of
 this proposed legislation.  Therefore, the estimated  financial  impact
 has  been  calculated  on  a  per  event  basis equal to the increase in
 Unfunded Accrued Liability (UAL) for an average  NYCERS  member  who  is
 employed as a DEP police officer and transfers to PFRS. This increase in
 UAL  consists  of  the  required  amount to be transferred to PFRS, plus
 Additional Member Contributions (AMC) to be refunded to the  member,  if
 any,  offset  by  the  reduction  in Accrued Liability since the member,
 assuming all service credit is transferred, would no longer be  entitled
 to future NYCERS benefits.
 A. 7220  4
 
  With  respect  to  an  individual  member, the additional cost of this
 proposed legislation could vary greatly depending on the member's length
 of service, age, and salary history.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census data and the
 actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of
 this  proposed  legislation  would  increase  the  UAL  by approximately
 $43,100, on average, for each eligible member who transfers to PFRS.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - ANNUAL EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS:  Enactment  of  this
 proposed  legislation  would increase employer contributions, where such
 amount would depend on the number of members affected as well  as  other
 characteristics  including the age, years of service, and salary history
 of the member.
  Based on the actuarial assumptions and methods  described  below,  the
 enactment  of  this proposed legislation is estimated to increase annual
 employer contributions by approximately $5,100,  on  average,  for  each
 eligible member who transfers to PFRS.
  As  there  is  no  data  currently available to estimate the number of
 members who may transfer to PFRS, the financial impact would  be  recog-
 nized  at  the  time  of  the event.  Consequently, changes in employer
 contributions have been estimated assuming that the increase in the  UAL
 will  be  recognized  as  an  actuarial  loss and financed over a closed
 15-year period (14 payments under the One-Year  Lag  Methodology)  using
 level dollar payments.
  With  respect to the timing, increases in employer contributions would
 depend upon when eligible members file  their  application  to  transfer
 their  NYCERS  membership  to  PFRS  but,  generally, increased employer
 contributions will first occur the  second  fiscal  year  following  the
 transfer of reserves to PFRS.
  CENSUS  DATA:  The  estimates presented herein are based on the census
 data used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS  to  deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  There are 190 active DEP police officers who participate in NYCERS and
 have  at  least  two  years of service as of June 30, 2022. Of these, 96
 active members have 15 or fewer  years  of  service  and  are  therefore
 assumed  to  potentially benefit from the proposed legislation. These 96
 active members have an average age of approximately 34.7 years,  average
 service  of  approximately  7.8 years, and an average salary of approxi-
 mately $74,700. There are also 56 former DEP police  officers  who  have
 separated from service with between two and 15 years of service.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  For purposes of this  Fiscal  Note,  it  has  been  assumed  that  the
 impacted  NYCERS  members  would  generally  not  have transferred their
 membership to PFRS absent this proposed legislation. It has been further
 assumed that members with more than 15 years of service would not trans-
 fer their membership even under the proposed legislation.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used, demograph-
 ics of the impacted population and other  factors  such  as  investment,
 contribution,  and other risks. If actual experience deviates from actu-
 arial assumptions, the actual costs could differ  from  those  presented
 herein.
  Costs  are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
