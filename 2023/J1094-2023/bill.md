  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body, in  keeping  with
its  time-honored  traditions,  to  recognize  and  pay tribute to those
organizations that embrace the historical significance and contributions
of their localities which strengthens the fabric of the  communities  of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to commend the
Charlton Historical Society upon the  occasion  of  hosting  its  Annual
Charlton Founders Day Weekend and Parade on Sunday, June 4, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year  marks  the  53rd  Anniversary  of the Charlton
Founders Day Weekend and Parade; the centerpiece of the weekend  is  the
extraordinary  colorful  Parade  which  serves  as  the  staple  of  the
weekend's various celebrations in  addition  to  enjoying  the  exciting
activities;  food  vendors  offer  their  specialty treats, tempting the
palettes of visitors from the surrounding communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Charlton Historical Society is a community organization
dedicated to promoting, developing,  and  paying  homage  to  the  Town,
always  adding  new  members  and providing a mock tour on their website
along with a guide to historic markers and other  resources  to  educate
the public at large on the rich history of the Town of Charlton; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1792,  the year after Saratoga County was founded, the
New York State Legislature divided "Balls Town" into four parts  forming
three  new  towns:  Galway,  Milton  and, in the southwest corner of the
county Charlton, which was  previously  called  "New  Freehold"  by  its
settlers who were mostly immigrants from Freehold, New Jersey; and
 
  WHEREAS, Why the name Charlton was chosen, or where it came from, is
not  known,  though  speculation  suggests  it  may  have  been for John
Charlton, a squatter already living in  the  area  when  early  settlers
arrived; today, Charlton is a vibrant, rural community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Within the town lines of Charlton, one can find the hamlets
of Blue Corners, Charlton Harmony Corners, Holbrook Corners, Komar Park,
Tucker Heights and West Charlton; and

in the United States House of Representatives for 20 years, from 1813 to
1833, and was twice elected as Speaker of the House in 1820 and in 1825;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Over  the  years,  the  Charlton  Founders Day Weekend and
Parade  has  grown  tremendously,  with  attendees  enjoying  multiple
festivities  which  includes  a  5K  race,  a  spectacular  display  of
fireworks, a two-day local farmers market, and an artisan's fair; and
 
  WHEREAS, Staying  true  to  tradition  and  to  honor  the  Town  of
Charlton's  local  businesses,  the  theme  of  this year's Founders Day
Weekend is "Charlton  Historic  Main  Street",  to  celebrate  the  rich
history and historic buildings and storefronts in their community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  year,  Mike  Maloney  has  been selected as the 2023
Charlton Founders Day Parade  Grand  Marshal  for  his  active  role  in
preserving  and  restoring  Charlton's  historic  buildings  and history
within Charlton's business district; and

cultural development of this great State and embody the  spirit  of  the
principles upon which this Nation was founded; now, therefore, be it
