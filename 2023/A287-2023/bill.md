  (d) The commission shall begin to act 45 days  after  this  act  shall
 have  become  a law. A quorum shall consist of a majority of the members
 of the commission entitled to vote on the  matter  under  consideration.
 Approval  of any matter shall require the affirmative vote of a majority
 of the members voting thereon.
  (e)  The members of the commission shall adopt by-laws for the manage-
 ment and regulation of its affairs.
  § 2. Appointments to commission. The legislative leaders,  the  gover-

 to  the  board  of regents, and the board of regents shall make appoint-
 ments, no later than 45 days after this act becomes a law. If  any  such
 appointment  is  not  made by such date, the person or board responsible
 for making the appointment pursuant to subdivision (b) of section one of
 this act may make the  appointment  after  that  date,  but  the  vacant
 appointment  shall  not  count  for  calculation of a quorum until it is
 filled. Vacancies in the commission shall be filled in the  same  manner

 education shall designate such employees of the department of  education

 provide  such  assistance as may be reasonably requested by the chair of
 the commission.
  (d) The commission, acting by the chair of the commission, may  employ
 additional  staff and consultants, who shall be paid from amounts avail-
 able to the commission for that purpose.
  § 4. Factors and information for consideration. The chancellor of  the

 other proceedings of the commission and any committee thereof  shall  be
 governed  by  article  7  of  the  public  officers law. Any one or more
 members of a committee may participate in a meeting of such committee by
 means of a conference telephone, conference video  or  similar  communi-
 cations  equipment  allowing all persons participating in the meeting to
 hear each other at the same time.  Participation by  such  means  shall
 constitute  presence  in  person  at  a  meeting. At any meetings of the
 commission conducted by means  of  a  conference  telephone,  conference
 video  or  similar  communications  equipment,  other  than  executive
 sessions, the public shall be given an opportunity to listen. If a meet-

 ation  of  demographic,  geographic,  educational  and fiscal indicators
 shall develop recommendations for improving diversity in the City of New
 York's specialized  senior  high  schools.  Such  recommendations  shall
 include,  but not be limited to, changes in the schools' admission proc-
 esses. In carrying out its functions, the commission  shall  collaborate
 with the city school district of the City of New York insofar as practi-
 cable  to  foster  discussions among, and conduct formal public hearings

 stakeholder  interests  including  but  not  limited  to school district

 the governor and the legislature the commission shall be dissolved.

 sion,  section  or  part  of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of
 competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment  shall  not  affect,

 its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,  subdivision,  section
 or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judg-
 ment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of
 the  legislature  that  this  act  would  have been enacted even if such
 invalid provisions had not been included herein.

 deemed repealed June 30, 2025.
