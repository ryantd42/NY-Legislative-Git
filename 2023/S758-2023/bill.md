  § 171-k. Electronic signature. (1) If any return or report relating to
 a  tax,  fee  or  other  imposition  administered by the commissioner is
 authorized by the commissioner to be  filed  electronically,  then  such
 return  or  report  shall  be  signed electronically consistent with the
 provisions of article three  of  the  state  technology  law;  provided,
 however,  that if the commissioner determines that electronic signatures
 that are used by the federal internal revenue service  in  tax  adminis-
 tration  are  not consistent with the provisions of article three of the
 state technology law, then the commissioner, after conferring  with  the
 office  of information technology services, may prescribe the manner and
 form of electronic signature on any such return or report.  Such  elec-
 tronic  signature  shall  conform, to the extent practicable, with elec-
 tronic signatures that are used by the federal internal revenue service.
 The use of such an electronic signature shall have the same validity and
 effect as the use of a signature affixed by hand.

 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
