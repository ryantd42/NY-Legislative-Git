 Introduced  by Sen. KAVANAGH -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Internet and Technology
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law, the executive law,  the  state
  finance  law  and  the  education  law,  in  relation  to enacting the
  "digital fairness act"

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "digital fairness act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature  finds  that  privacy
 violations  and  misuse  of  personal information in the digital age can
 lead to a  range  of  harms,  including  discrimination  in  employment,
 healthcare,  housing,  access  to  credit, and other areas; unfair price
 discrimination; and financial, emotional, or reputational harms.  Misuse
 of  personal  information  can limit awareness of and access to opportu-
 nities, exacerbate information disparities, erode public trust and  free
 expression,  disincentivize  individuals  from  participating  fully  in
 digital life and utilizing online services, and  increase  the  risk  of
 future harms.
  The legislature additionally finds that individuals in New York state,
 like individuals across the nation, do not know or consent to the manner
 in  which  entities  collect,  use,  retain,  share,  and monetize their
 personal information. This misunderstanding is, at least in part, due to
 obfuscation on the part of the entities leveraging individuals' personal
 information. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon found  that  it  would  take
 seventy-six  work  days for individuals to read all of the privacy poli-
 cies they encounter in a year. Although the advertising industry  devel-
 oped  a  common logo and slogan to notify individuals of the opportunity
 to opt-out of  targeted  advertising,  following  market  research,  the
 industry  selected  the slogan and logo that few individuals understood,
 seemingly to discourage opt-out.

  The legislature further finds that entities that collect, use, retain,
 share, and monetize  personal  information  have  specialized  knowledge
 about  the  algorithms  and  data security measures they use, as well as
 about how they collect, use, retain, share, and monetize personal infor-
 mation,  that the average individual is unlikely to understand.  Just as
 banks, lawyers, and medical providers,  given  their  specialized  know-
 ledge,  have  special  obligations  to  individuals, entities collecting
 intimate personal information in the digital  age  and  benefiting  from
 similarly specialized knowledge should have similar obligations.
  The  legislature  also  finds that individuals in New York state, like
 individuals across the country, value privacy and wish  to  control  who
 has  access  to their personal information.  Ninety-two percent of Face-
 book users alter the social network's default privacy  settings,  demon-
 strating that they wish to choose with whom they share personal informa-
 tion.  Similarly,  ninety-two  percent  of Americans believe companies
 should obtain individuals' permission before sharing  or  selling  their
 personal information.
  The  legislature  additionally  finds  that  biometric  information is
 unlike  other  unique  identifiers,  because  biometric  information  is
 biologically  unique  to  an individual and cannot be changed if compro-
 mised. As a result, biometric information merits special protections.
  The legislature also finds that it has had a decades long interest  in
 protecting  New  Yorkers' privacy. For example, since 1996, section 79-l
 of the New York civil rights law has protected the  privacy  of  genetic
 information,  requiring  an individual's informed, written consent prior
 to genetic testing and  restricting  the  disclosure  and  retention  of
 genetic information.
  The  legislature  further  finds  that  the  use of automated decision
 systems to make core government and business decisions  raises  concerns
 around  due process, fairness, accountability, and transparency, as well
 as other civil rights and liberties.  Reliance  on  automated  decision
 systems  without  adequate  transparency,  oversight,  or safeguards can
 undermine market predictability, harm consumers, and  deny  historically
 disadvantaged  or  vulnerable  groups  the  full  measure of their civil
 rights and liberties.
  The legislature finally finds that New York has the  longest  standing
 human  rights law in the nation and that the state has prioritized root-
 ing out discrimination in employment, housing, credit,  public  accommo-
 dations,  and  educational  institutions  based  on  age, race, national
 origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, and  other
 protected classes. Ensuring that sophisticated algorithms cannot be used
 to  circumvent  the  state's civil and human rights laws is an important
 exercise of the legislature's authority.
