 AN ACT in relation to permitting the Church of Jesus Christ (Apostolic),
  Inc.  to file an application for a real property tax exemption
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the asses-
 sor  of the city of Mount Vernon is hereby authorized to accept from the
 Church of Jesus Christ (Apostolic), Inc.  an application  for  exemption
 from  real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real property
 tax law for the assessment rolls 1996-1998, for the  parcel  located  at
 332-340 South Columbus Avenue in the city of Mount Vernon.  If accepted,
 the  applications  shall  be reviewed as if they had been received on or
 before the taxable status date established for such rolls. If  satisfied
 that  the Church of Jesus Christ (Apostolic), Inc. (i) acquired title to
 the property for which it seeks exemption in March 1996 and  (ii)  would
 otherwise  be  entitled  to  such exemption if such corporation filed an
 application for the exemption  on  or  before  the  appropriate  taxable
 status  dates,  the  assessor,  upon approval by the city council of the
 city of Mount Vernon, whichever the case may  be,  may  grant  exemption
 from  taxation  on  such  assessment  rolls  and  make  the  appropriate
 corrections of the subject rolls. If exemptions  are  granted  and  such
 corporation,  therefore,  shall  have  paid  any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing  body  or  tax  departments,  in
 their  sole  discretion,  shall provide for the refund of the taxes paid
 and cancel taxes remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
