 proposing an amendment to section 1 of article 4 of the constitution, in
  relation to decreasing the length of the term of office for the gover-
  nor and lieutenant-governor to two years; and proposing  an  amendment

  Section  1.  The  executive power shall be vested in the governor, who
 shall hold office for [four] TWO years; the lieutenant-governor shall be
 chosen at the same time, and for the same term. The governor  and  lieu-
 tenant-governor shall be chosen at the general election held in the year
 [nineteen  hundred  thirty-eight]  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-SIX,  and  each
 [fourth] SECOND year thereafter.  They shall be chosen jointly,  by  the
 casting  by  each voter of a single vote applicable to both offices, and
 the legislature by law shall provide for  making  such  choice  in  such
 manner.  The  respective persons having the highest number of votes cast
 jointly for them for governor and lieutenant-governor respectively shall
 be elected.

 to prescribe such  methods  of  accounting  as  are  necessary  for  the
 performance  of  the  foregoing  duties. The payment of any money of the
 state, or of any money under its control, or the  refund  of  any  money
 paid  to the state, except upon audit by the comptroller, shall be void,
 and may be restrained upon the suit of any taxpayer with the consent  of
 the supreme court in appellate division on notice to the attorney-gener-
 al.  In  such respect the legislature shall define the powers and duties
 and may also assign to him or her: (1) supervision of  the  accounts  of
 any  political  subdivision  of  the  state;  and  (2) powers and duties
 pertaining to or connected with the  assessment  and  taxation  of  real
 estate,  including  determination of ratios which the assessed valuation
 of taxable real property bears to the full valuation  thereof,  but  not
 including any of those powers and duties reserved to officers of a coun-
 ty,  city,  town  or  village  by  virtue  of [sections seven and eight]
 SECTION ONE of article nine AND SECTION THIRTEEN OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN  of
 this  constitution. The legislature shall assign to him or her no admin-
 istrative duties, excepting such as may be incidental to the performance
 of these functions, any other provision  of  this  constitution  to  the
 contrary notwithstanding.
  §  3.  Resolved (if the Senate concur), That the foregoing be referred
 to the first  regular  legislative  session  convening  after  the  next
 succeeding general election of members of the assembly, and, in conform-
 ity with section 1 of article 19 of the constitution, be published for 3
 months previous to the time of such election.
