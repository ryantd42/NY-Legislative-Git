 AN  ACT authorizing United Church of God Seventh Day to receive retroac-
  tive real property tax exempt status
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 the  United Church of God Seventh Day, an application for exemption from
 real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real  property  tax
 law  with  respect  to  a  portion  of  the 2021-2022 school taxes and a
 portion of the 2021 general taxes for the parcel conveyed to such organ-
 ization, with such parcel being located at 180 Denton Ave, in  Lynbrook,
 otherwise  known  as Nassau county tax map section 38, block 93, lot 30.
 If accepted, the application  shall  be  reviewed  as  if  it  had  been
 received  on  or  before  the  taxable status dates established for such
 rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such organization had acquired the subject property
 and filed an application for exemption by the appropriate taxable status
 date, the assessor, upon approval by the Nassau county legislature,  may
 grant  exemption  from  all taxation and make appropriate corrections to
 the subject rolls.  If such exemption is granted and  such  organization
 therefore  shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject roll, the
 governing body or tax department may, in its  sole  discretion,  provide
 for  the  refund of those taxes paid and cancel any taxes, fines, penal-
 ties, interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
