  (B)  Such  [review]  REVIEWS shall be performed at least annually, and
 shall focus on whether such [policy or practice is]  POLICIES  OR  PRAC-
 TICES  ARE consistent with current, generally accepted medical standards
 and procedures used to prevent the transmission of and  to  treat  those
 infections  and  diseases  among  the general public. In performing such
 reviews, in order to determine the quality  and  adequacy  of  care  and
 treatment provided, department personnel are authorized to enter correc-
 tional  facilities  and inspect policy and procedure manuals and medical
 protocols, interview health services providers and incarcerated  indivi-
 dual-patients,  review  medical grievances, and inspect a representative
 sample of medical  records  of  incarcerated  individuals  known  to  be
 infected  with  any  such  infections or diseases. Prior to initiating a
 review of a correctional  system,  the  commissioner  shall  inform  the
 public, including patients, their families and patient advocates, of the
 scheduled  review and invite them to provide the commissioner with rele-
 vant information.
  (C) Upon the completion of such review, the department shall, in writ-
 ing, approve such policy or practice as instituted in  facilities  oper-
 ated  by the department of corrections and community supervision, and in
 any local correctional facility, or, based on specific,  written  recom-
 mendations,  direct  the  department of corrections and community super-
 vision, or the authority responsible for the provision of  medical  care
 to  incarcerated individuals in local correctional facilities to prepare
 and implement a corrective plan to address deficiencies in  areas  where
 such  policy or practice fails to conform to current, generally accepted
 medical standards and procedures.  The commissioner shall  monitor  the
 implementation  of  such corrective plans and shall conduct such further
 reviews as the commissioner deems necessary to  ensure  that  identified
 deficiencies  in those policies and practices are corrected. All written
 reports pertaining to reviews provided for in this subdivision SHALL NOT
 CONTAIN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AND shall  be  [main-
 tained,  under  such conditions as the commissioner shall prescribe, as]
 public information [available for public inspection] AND SHALL BE POSTED
