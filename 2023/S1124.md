 different  sources  of  support  museums receive publicly and those they
 must find privately.

 legislature of the adequacy of public and private sources of the funding
 for  museums in the state and to serve current and future funding needs,
 recommend systems of support to best ensure  equitable  distribution  of
 such  funds, regardless of discipline, budget size, or location, and the

 interest  in  cultural  and  historical  topics, fine arts, physical and
 natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics, and to deter-
 mine the feasibility of a single reporting system that  includes  active
 oversight.
