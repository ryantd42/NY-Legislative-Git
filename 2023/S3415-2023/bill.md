  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The correction law is amended by adding a new article  23-B

  COLLEGE ADMISSIONS FOR PERSONS PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED
  OF ONE OR MORE CRIMINAL OFFENSES
 SECTION 770. DEFINITIONS.

 S. 3415  2
 
  3. "DIRECT RELATIONSHIP" MEANS THAT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL  CONNECTION
 BETWEEN  THE  NATURE  OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH THE ACCEPTED INDIVIDUAL WAS
 CONVICTED AND THE ACTIVITY OR ASPECT OF CAMPUS LIFE AT  ISSUE  AND  SUCH
 CONNECTION  WOULD  CREATE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO THE PROPERTY OR TO THE
 SAFETY  OR  WELFARE  OF SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS OR THE CAMPUS AS A WHOLE IF
 THE ACCEPTED STUDENT IS PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE WITH OR WITHOUT  CONDI-
 TIONS.
  §  771. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. COLLEGE EDUCATION PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN
 DEVELOPING GOOD CITIZENSHIP, CREATING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES,
 AND ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY BY REDUCING THE  RECIDIVISM  OF  INDIVIDUALS
 WITH  A  CRIMINAL  HISTORY RECORD. THEREFORE, IT IS THE PUBLIC POLICY OF
 THIS STATE TO PROMOTE THE ADMISSION TO COLLEGE OF INDIVIDUALS PREVIOUSLY
 CONVICTED OF ONE OR MORE CRIMINAL OFFENSES AND TO ALLOW SUCH INDIVIDUALS
 TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF COLLEGE LIFE.
  § 772. PROHIBITION AGAINST INQUIRIES ABOUT ARRESTS THAT DID NOT RESULT
 IN A CRIMINAL CONVICTION AND CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SEALED.
 AT NO TIME DURING THE  ADMISSION  DECISION-MAKING  PROCESS  OR  WHILE  A
 STUDENT IS ENROLLED SHALL COLLEGES MAKE ANY INQUIRY OR CONSIDER INFORMA-
 TION  ABOUT  ANY  ARREST  OR CRIMINAL ACCUSATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS
 APPLYING FOR ADMISSION OR HAS BEEN  ADMITTED  THAT  WAS  FOLLOWED  BY  A
 TERMINATION OF THAT CRIMINAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN FAVOR OF SUCH INDI-
 VIDUAL  AS  DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION 160.50 OF THE CRIMINAL
 PROCEDURE LAW AND SECTION 375.1 OF THE FAMILY COURT ACT, OR BY A  YOUTH-
 FUL  OFFENDER  ADJUDICATION  AS  DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION
 720.35 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, OR BY A JUVENILE DELINQUENCY ADJU-
 DICATION AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 380.1  OF  THE  FAMILY
 COURT  ACT, OR BY A CONVICTION FOR A VIOLATION SEALED OR SEALABLE PURSU-
 ANT TO SECTION 160.55 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, OR BY A  CONVICTION
 WHICH  IS  SEALED  PURSUANT  TO SECTION 160.58 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
 LAW.
  § 773. PRE-ACCEPTANCE PROHIBITION AGAINST INQUIRY INTO CRIMINAL HISTO-
 RY.  COLLEGES MAY NOT MAKE ANY INQUIRY OR CONSIDER INFORMATION ABOUT  AN
 INDIVIDUAL'S  PAST CRIMINAL CONVICTION OR CONVICTIONS AT ANY TIME DURING
 THE APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.
  § 774. POST-ACCEPTANCE INQUIRY ABOUT CRIMINAL  HISTORY  PERMITTED.  1.
 AFTER  AN  INDIVIDUAL  HAS BEEN ADMITTED AS A STUDENT, COLLEGES MAY MAKE
 INQUIRIES ABOUT AND CONSIDER INFORMATION  ABOUT  THE  INDIVIDUAL'S  PAST
 CRIMINAL CONVICTION HISTORY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OFFERING SUPPORTIVE COUN-
 SELING AND SERVICES.
  2.  COLLEGES  MAY  ALSO  MAKE INQUIRIES ABOUT AND CONSIDER INFORMATION
 ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S PAST CRIMINAL CONVICTION HISTORY FOR THE  PURPOSE
 OF  MAKING  DECISIONS  ABOUT  PARTICIPATION IN ACTIVITIES AND ASPECTS OF
 CAMPUS LIFE ASSOCIATED  WITH  THE  INDIVIDUAL'S  STATUS  AS  A  STUDENT,
 INCLUDING  BUT  NOT  LIMITED  TO  HOUSING.  IN MAKING SUCH INQUIRIES AND
 CONSIDERING SUCH INFORMATION:
  (A) COLLEGES SHALL NOT USE INFORMATION ABOUT AN ADMITTED  INDIVIDUAL'S
 CRIMINAL CONVICTION HISTORY TO RESCIND AN OFFER OF ADMISSION.
  (B)  COLLEGES  SHALL  NOT ESTABLISH OUTRIGHT BARS TO ANY ACTIVITIES OR
 PARTICIPATION IN ASPECTS OF CAMPUS LIFE BASED ON  AN  ADMITTED  INDIVID-
 UAL'S  CRIMINAL  CONVICTION  HISTORY.  INSTEAD, COLLEGES MUST DEVELOP AN
 INDIVIDUALIZED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A  DIRECT
 RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  THE  ACCEPTED  INDIVIDUAL'S  CRIMINAL  CONVICTION
 HISTORY AND THE ACTIVITY OR ASPECT OF CAMPUS LIFE AT ISSUE.  THIS  INDI-
 VIDUALIZED PROCESS MUST BE SET FORTH IN WRITING AND MUST INCLUDE CONSID-
 ERATION OF:
 S. 3415  3
 
  (I)  THE  AGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE TIME OF THE BEHAVIOR UNDERLYING
 THE CRIMINAL CONVICTION OR CONVICTIONS;
  (II) THE TIME THAT HAS ELAPSED SINCE THE BEHAVIOR UNDERLYING THE CRIM-
 INAL CONVICTION OR CONVICTIONS;
  (III) THE NATURE OF THE CONVICTION OR CONVICTIONS AND WHETHER IT BEARS
 A  DIRECT  RELATIONSHIP  TO  THE ACTIVITY OR PARTICIPATION IN ASPECTS OF
 CAMPUS LIFE AT ISSUE; AND
  (IV) ANY EVIDENCE OF REHABILITATION OR GOOD CONDUCT  PRODUCED  BY  THE
 ACCEPTED INDIVIDUAL.
  (C) THIS INDIVIDUALIZED PROCESS MUST FURTHER PROVIDE AN ACCEPTED INDI-
 VIDUAL  AN  OPPORTUNITY  TO APPEAL ANY DENIAL OR LIMITATION OF ACCESS TO
 ANY ACTIVITY OR ASPECT OF CAMPUS LIFE.  COLLEGES  MUST  FURTHER  INFORM
 ACCEPTED  INDIVIDUALS  OF THIS PROCESS IN WRITING, INCLUDING THEIR RIGHT
 TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF REHABILITATION AND GOOD CONDUCT AND  THEIR  RIGHT
 TO APPEAL.
  § 775. INQUIRIES INTO CRIMINAL HISTORY NOT REQUIRED. THIS ARTICLE DOES
 NOT  REQUIRE COLLEGES TO MAKE INQUIRIES INTO OR CONSIDER AN INDIVIDUAL'S
 CRIMINAL CONVICTION HISTORY FOR ANY REASON. IF COLLEGES ELECT TO  DO  SO
 FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING IF THERE IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
 THE  ACCEPTED  INDIVIDUAL'S  CONVICTION OR CONVICTIONS AND ACTIVITIES OR
 PARTICIPATION IN ASPECTS OF CAMPUS  LIFE,  COLLEGES  MUST  CONSIDER  THE
 STATE'S POLICY TO PROMOTE THE ADMISSION TO COLLEGE OF INDIVIDUALS PREVI-
 OUSLY  CONVICTED  OF  ONE OR MORE CRIMINAL OFFENSES AND OF ALLOWING SUCH
 INDIVIDUALS FULL ACCESS TO ALL ASPECTS OF COLLEGE LIFE.
  § 776. ENFORCEMENT. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS SECTION  SHALL  BE  AN
 UNLAWFUL  DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICE AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION TWENTY-THREE
 OF SECTION TWO HUNDRED NINETY-SIX OF THE EXECUTIVE LAW.
  § 2. Section 296 of the executive law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 subdivision 23 to read as follows:
  23.  IT  SHALL BE AN UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICE FOR ANY COLLEGE,
 AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED  SEVENTY  OF  THE
 CORRECTION  LAW,  TO MAKE ANY INQUIRY INTO OR CONSIDER INFORMATION ABOUT
 AN INDIVIDUAL'S PAST ARREST OR CONVICTION HISTORY AT ANY TIME DURING THE
 APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS DECISION-MAKING  PROCESS  OR  TO  RESCIND  AN
 OFFER  OF  ADMISSION BASED UPON INFORMATION ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S ARREST
 OR CONVICTION THAT OCCURRED PRIOR TO ADMISSION.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
