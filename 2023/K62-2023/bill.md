  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January  29  -  February  4,  2023,  as  Physician
  Anesthesiologists Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize an
official week that is set aside to inform key audiences about  the  role
and  value  of Physician Anesthesiologists in delivering anesthesia care
in today and tomorrow's United States healthcare system; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 29 -  February  4,
2023,  as  Physician Anesthesiologists Week in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance of National Physician  Anesthesiologists
Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Physician anesthesiologists are guardians of patient safety
in  healthcare:  in  the  operating  room,  in the delivery room, in the
intensive care unit,  in  pain  management  clinics,  and  at  the  U.S.
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs (VA) protecting our nation's Veterans;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Physician Anesthesiologists Week is a  seven-day  event  of
advocacy  and  public  outreach  to  educate  key  audiences  that
anesthesiologists are uniquely qualified to lead  patient  care  and  to
highlight  key  issues  including  the  importance  of patient-centered,
physician-led anesthesia care; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 12 to 14 years of education and 12,000 to 16,000  hours
of  training combine to make the physician anesthesiologists prepared to
navigate life-and-death moments and help  ensure  patients  receive  the
highest quality care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Physician  anesthesiologists  are  made  for  this moment,
playing a critical role in keeping  patients  safe  in  this  State  and
community,  whether  managing  a  crisis  during  surgery  or  labor and
delivery, providing pain management, or caring for our Veterans who  are
among  the  most  vulnerable  patients  often  suffering  from  medical
conditions associated with their military service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Anesthesia  Team  model,  led  by  physician
anesthesiologists,  is  widely  recognized  as the gold standard of care
used in all of the Nation's top hospitals  and  in  the  VA  to  protect
patients  and  the  millions of Veterans who have served our country and
deserve the same high standard of care available for 95%  of  Americans;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  person  in  New York is entitled to and should have
universal access to the highest level of anesthesia care, every  patient
regardless of socioeconomic status deserves a physician anesthesiologist
leading their care, advocating for them, and safeguarding them when they
are under anesthesia and unable to advocate for themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Physician anesthesiologists are recognized leaders who are
committed to providing universal access to high quality and safe patient
care, educating patients on anesthesia safety,  and  reducing  risks  of
complications before, during, and after surgery; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 29 -  February  4,
2023,  as  Physician Anesthesiologists Week in the State of New York, in
recognition of our appreciation of Physician  Anesthesiologists  and  to
celebrate their dedication and professionalism; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  and  Board  Members  of  the  New  York  State  Society  of
Anesthesiologists.
