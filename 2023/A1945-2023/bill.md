 FOR EVERY PRINCIPAL BROUGHT BEFORE THE  COURT.  IF,  AFTER  A  HEARING
 PURSUANT  TO  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION, THE
 DISTRICT OR SUPREME COURT JUDGE FINDS BY CLEAR AND  CONVINCING  EVIDENCE
 THAT  NO  CONDITIONS OF RELEASE WILL REASONABLY ASSURE THE SAFETY OF ANY
 OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY, SAID JUDGE SHALL ORDER THE  DETENTION  OF
 THE  PRINCIPAL  PRIOR TO TRIAL. A PRINCIPAL DETAINED UNDER THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION SHALL BE BROUGHT TO A TRIAL AS SOON AS REASONABLY POSSIBLE, BUT  IN
 ABSENCE  OF  EXTRAORDINARY  CIRCUMSTANCES,  SUCH  PRINCIPAL SHALL NOT BE
 DETAINED FOR A PERIOD EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS BY THE  DISTRICT
 COURT  OR  FOR A PERIOD EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS BY THE SUPREME
 COURT.
  4. (A) WHEN A PRINCIPAL IS HELD UNDER ARREST FOR AN OFFENSE LISTED  IN

 APPEARANCE BEFORE THE COURT UNLESS SUCH PRINCIPAL OR THE PEOPLE  SEEK  A
 CONTINUANCE. EXCEPT FOR GOOD CAUSE, A CONTINUANCE ON MOTION OF THE PRIN-
 CIPAL  SHALL  NOT  EXCEED  SEVEN DAYS AND A CONTINUANCE ON MOTION OF THE
 PEOPLE SHALL NOT EXCEED THREE BUSINESS DAYS. DURING A  CONTINUANCE,  THE
 PRINCIPAL  SHALL  BE DETAINED UPON A SHOWING THAT THERE EXISTED PROBABLE
 CAUSE TO ARREST THE PRINCIPAL. AT THE HEARING, SUCH PRINCIPAL SHALL HAVE
 THE RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL, AND, IF  FINANCIALLY  UNABLE  TO
 RETAIN ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION, TO HAVE COUNSEL APPOINTED. THE PRINCIPAL
 SHALL  BE  AFFORDED  AN OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY, TO PRESENT WITNESSES, TO
 CROSS-EXAMINE WITNESSES WHO APPEAR AT THE HEARING, AND TO PRESENT INFOR-
 MATION. PRIOR TO THE SUMMONS OF AN ALLEGED VICTIM, OR A  MEMBER  OF  THE
 ALLEGED  VICTIM'S  FAMILY,  TO  APPEAR  AS A WITNESS AT THE HEARING, THE
 PRINCIPAL SHALL DEMONSTRATE TO THE COURT A  GOOD  FAITH  BASIS  FOR  THE
 PRINCIPAL'S  REASONABLE  BELIEF THAT THE TESTIMONY FROM THE WITNESS WILL
 BE MATERIAL AND RELEVANT TO SUPPORT A CONCLUSION THAT THERE  ARE  CONDI-
 TIONS  OF  RELEASE  THAT  WILL REASONABLY ASSURE THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER
 PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY. THE RULES CONCERNING ADMISSIBILITY OF  EVIDENCE
 IN CRIMINAL TRIALS SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE PRESENTATION AND CONSIDERATION
 A. 1945  4
 
 OF  INFORMATION  AT  THE  HEARING  AND  THE JUDGE SHALL CONSIDER HEARSAY
 CONTAINED IN A POLICE REPORT OR THE STATEMENT OF AN  ALLEGED  VICTIM  OR
 WITNESS. THE FACTS THE JUDGE USES TO SUPPORT FINDINGS PURSUANT TO SUBDI-
 VISION  THREE OF THIS SECTION, THAT NO CONDITIONS WILL REASONABLY ASSURE
 THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY, SHALL BE  SUPPORTED  BY
 CLEAR  AND  CONVINCING EVIDENCE. IN A DETENTION ORDER ISSUED PURSUANT TO
 THE PROVISIONS OF SAID SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF  THIS  SECTION  THE  JUDGE
 SHALL:  (I)  INCLUDE WRITTEN FINDINGS OF FACT AND A WRITTEN STATEMENT OF
 THE REASONS FOR THE DETENTION; (II) DIRECT THAT THE PRINCIPAL BE COMMIT-
 TED TO CUSTODY OR CONFINEMENT IN A CORRECTIONS FACILITY SEPARATE, TO THE
 EXTENT PRACTICABLE, FROM PRINCIPALS  AWAITING  OR  SERVING  SENTENCE  OR
 BEING  HELD IN CUSTODY PENDING APPEAL; AND (III) DIRECT THAT THE PRINCI-
 PAL BE AFFORDED REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR PRIVATE CONSULTATION WITH HIS
 OR HER COUNSEL. THE PRINCIPAL MAY BE DETAINED PENDING COMPLETION OF  THE
 HEARING.  THE  HEARING  MAY BE REOPENED BY THE JUDGE, AT ANY TIME BEFORE
 TRIAL, OR UPON A MOTION OF THE PEOPLE OR THE PRINCIPAL DETAINED  IF  THE
 JUDGE  FINDS THAT: (A) INFORMATION EXISTS THAT WAS NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME
 OF THE HEARING OR THAT THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES; AND (B)
 THAT SUCH INFORMATION OR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES HAS A MATERIAL  BEARING
 ON  THE  ISSUE  OF  WHETHER  THERE  ARE  CONDITIONS OF RELEASE THAT WILL
 REASONABLY ASSURE THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY.
  5. IN HIS DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THERE ARE CONDITIONS OF  RELEASE
 THAT WILL REASONABLY ASSURE THE SAFETY OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMU-
 NITY,  SAID JUDGE SHALL, ON THE BASIS OF ANY INFORMATION WHICH HE OR SHE
 CAN REASONABLY OBTAIN, TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NATURE AND  SERIOUSNESS  OF
 THE  DANGER POSED TO ANY OTHER PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY THAT WOULD RESULT
 BY THE PRINCIPAL'S RELEASE, THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE  OFFENSE
 CHARGED,  THE  POTENTIAL  PENALTY  THE  PRINCIPAL FACES, THE PRINCIPAL'S
 FAMILY TIES, EMPLOYMENT RECORD AND HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS, THE  PRIN-
 CIPAL'S REPUTATION, THE RISK THAT THE PRINCIPAL WILL OBSTRUCT OR ATTEMPT
 TO  OBSTRUCT  THE  JUDGE OR THREATEN, INJURE OR INTIMIDATE OR ATTEMPT TO
 THREATEN, INJURE OR INTIMIDATE A PROSPECTIVE WITNESS OR  JUROR,  HIS  OR
 HER  RECORD  OF  CONVICTIONS,  IF  ANY, ANY ILLEGAL DRUG DISTRIBUTION OR
 PRESENT DRUG DEPENDENCY, AND WHETHER THE PRINCIPAL IS  RELEASED  PENDING
 ADJUDICATION OF A PRIOR CHARGE.
  6. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS MODIFYING OR LIMITING
 THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.
  7.  (A)  A PRINCIPAL AGGRIEVED BY THE DENIAL OF A DISTRICT COURT JUDGE

 SURETY  OR  CONDITION MAY PETITION THE SUPREME COURT FOR A REVIEW OF THE
 ORDER OF THE RECOGNIZANCE AND THE JUDGE  OF  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  SHALL
