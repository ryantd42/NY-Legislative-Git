 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to allowing  retirees  of
  the  New  York  state  teachers'  retirement  system who suspend their
  retirement the option of a benefit recalculation after  two  years  of
  service
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 11 of section 503  of  the  education  law,  as
 added  by  chapter  507 of the laws of 1972 and as renumbered by chapter
 512 of the laws of 1976, is amended to read as follows:
  11. a. If a retired member, receiving a retirement allowance for other
 than disability, returns to active public service, except  as  otherwise
 provided  in  [sections]  SECTION  two  hundred  eleven or two [hyndred]
 HUNDRED twelve of the retirement and social security law, and is  eligi-
 ble for membership in the retirement system, he [thereupon] OR SHE shall
 become  a  member and his OR HER retirement allowance shall be suspended
 in the same manner as provided in subdivision five of THIS section [five
 hundred three of this article. In such event, he shall contribute to the
 retirement system as if he were a new  member].  Upon  [his]  subsequent
 retirement [after at least two years of service he] THEY shall:
  1. Be credited with all member service earned [by him] since he OR SHE
 last became a member of the retirement system, and
  2. Receive a retirement allowance which shall consist of[:
  (a) An annuity as provided in subdivision five of section five hundred
 three  of this article plus an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent
 of any contributions made by him since he last became a member, and
  (b) The] THE pension which he OR SHE was receiving  immediately  prior
 to  his OR HER last restoration to membership as provided in subdivision
 five of THIS section [five  hundred  three  of  this  article],  plus  a
 pension  based upon the [member] service credit earned [by him] since he

 OR SHE last became a member. Such latter pension shall be computed as if
 [he] THEY were a new member when he OR SHE rejoined the system  pursuant
 to the provisions of this subdivision.
  b.  Where  such  member shall have earned at least [five] TWO years of
 [member] service credit after restoration to active service,  the  total
 service  credit to which he OR SHE was entitled at the time of [his] THE
 earlier retirement may, at his OR HER option, again be credited  to  him
 OR  HER and upon [his] subsequent retirement he OR SHE shall be credited
 in addition for purposes of computation of the pension  portion  of  the
 retirement  allowance  with all [member] service CREDIT earned by him OR
 HER subsequent to [his] THE last restoration to membership.  Such  total
 service  credit to which he OR SHE was entitled at the time of [his] THE
 earlier retirement shall be so credited only  in  the  event  that  such
 member  returns to the retirement system with regular interest the actu-
 arial equivalent of the amount of the pension [he] received, or  in  the
 event that such amount is not so repaid the actuarial equivalent thereof
 shall be deducted from his OR HER subsequent retirement allowance.
  c.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions of this subdivision, a
 retired member who is receiving a retirement allowance  for  other  than
 physical disability, and who returns to active public service, may elect
 not  to  be  restored to membership in the retirement system until he OR
 SHE has rendered one year of service following  his  OR  HER  return  to
 public  service.  In such event his OR HER retirement allowance shall be
 suspended during such year of service in the same manner as provided  in
 subdivision  five  of THIS section [five hundred three of this article].
 Upon restoration to membership following  completion  of  such  year  of
 service,  his  OR HER service in such year shall be deemed to be service
 while a member for purposes of subdivision b  of  section  five  hundred
 twelve  of  this article. He OR SHE may purchase [member] service credit
 for such year, which shall be deemed earned [member] service credit.  IF
 A RETIRED MEMBER RECEIVING A RETIREMENT BENEFIT ALLOWANCE FOR OTHER THAN
 PHYSICAL DISABILITY, RETURNS TO ACTIVE PUBLIC SERVICE, AND IS THEN INEL-
 IGIBLE  FOR  MEMBERSHIP  IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM, HIS OR HER RETIREMENT
 ALLOWANCE SHALL BE SUSPENDED IN THE SAME  MANNER  AS  PROVIDED  IN  THIS
 SECTION.
  d.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of this article, a retired
 member who rejoins the system under the provisions of [paragraphs a or c
 of] this subdivision shall only be entitled to a death benefit according
 to the provisions of paragraph two of  subdivision  b  of  section  five
 hundred  twelve  of this article and of no other subdivision thereof and
 for the purposes of said paragraph two of subdivision b of section  five
 hundred  twelve  the credited service as a teacher shall be service as a
 teacher credited since last joining the system.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the sixtieth  day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would amend subdivision 11 of Section 503 of the Education
 Law to allow a retired member of the New York State Teachers' Retirement
 System (NYSTRS), who  returns  to  active  service  and  suspends  their
 pension  benefit,  to elect to combine their service credit earned prior
 to their retirement with the service credit earned after their  restora-
 tion  to active service, provided they have earned at least two years of
 service credit since restoration and they pay back their  prior  pension
 received or have the new benefit reduced for life based upon the actuar-
 ial  equivalent of the prior pension received. Current law requires five
 years of service credit since restoration to combine all service  credit
 S. 7462  3

 into  one  pension benefit. State employees and other members of the New
 York State and Local Retirement System (NYS&LRS) are eligible to combine
 their service credit after earning two years  of  service  credit  after
 restoration. This bill would make this eligibility the same for teachers
 as  it is for state employees. This bill would take effect on the sixti-
 eth day after it shall become a law.
  The annual cost to the employers of members  of  the  New  York  State
 Teachers' Retirement System would be negligible if this bill is enacted.
