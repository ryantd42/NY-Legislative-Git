 S. 7462--A  2

  (a) An annuity as provided in subdivision five of section five hundred
 three of this article plus an annuity which is the actuarial  equivalent
 of any contributions made by him since he last became a member, and
  (b)  The] THE pension which [he] SUCH MEMBER was receiving immediately
 prior to [his] SUCH MEMBER'S last restoration to membership as  provided
 in  subdivision  five  of THIS section [five hundred three of this arti-
 cle], plus a pension based upon the [member] service credit  earned  [by
 him]  since  [he]  SUCH MEMBER last became a member. Such latter pension
 shall be computed as if [he] THEY were  a  new  member  when  [he]  SUCH
 MEMBER  rejoined  the system pursuant to the provisions of this subdivi-
 sion.
  b. Where such member shall have earned at least [five]  TWO  years  of
 [member]  service  credit after restoration to active service, the total
 service credit to which [he] SUCH MEMBER was entitled  at  the  time  of
 [his]  THE  earlier retirement may, at [his] SUCH MEMBER'S option, again
 be credited to [him] SUCH MEMBER and upon  [his]  subsequent  retirement
 [he]  SUCH MEMBER shall be credited in addition for purposes of computa-
 tion of the  pension  portion  of  the  retirement  allowance  with  all
 [member]  service CREDIT earned by [him] SUCH MEMBER subsequent to [his]
 THE last restoration to membership.  Such total service credit to  which
 [he]  SUCH  MEMBER was entitled at the time of [his] THE earlier retire-
 ment shall be so credited only in the event that such member returns  to
 the  retirement system with regular interest the actuarial equivalent of
 the amount of the pension [he] received,  or  in  the  event  that  such
 amount  is  not  so  repaid  the  actuarial  equivalent thereof shall be
 deducted from [his] SUCH MEMBER'S subsequent retirement allowance.
  c. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions  of  this  subdivision,  a
 retired  member  who  is receiving a retirement allowance for other than
 physical disability, and who returns to active public service, may elect
 not to be restored to membership in the  retirement  system  until  [he]
 SUCH  RETIRED  MEMBER  has  rendered one year of service following [his]
 SUCH MEMBER'S return  to  public  service.  In  such  event  [his]  SUCH
 MEMBER'S  retirement  allowance  shall  be suspended during such year of
 service in the same manner as  provided  in  subdivision  five  of  THIS
 section  [five  hundred  three  of  this article].  Upon restoration to
 membership following completion of such  year  of  service,  [his]  SUCH
 MEMBER'S  service  in  such  year  shall be deemed to be service while a
 member for purposes of subdivision b of section five hundred  twelve  of
 this  article. [He] SUCH MEMBER may purchase [member] service credit for
 such year, which shall be deemed earned [member] service  credit.  IF  A
 RETIRED  MEMBER  RECEIVING A RETIREMENT BENEFIT ALLOWANCE FOR OTHER THAN
 PHYSICAL DISABILITY, RETURNS TO ACTIVE PUBLIC SERVICE, AND IS THEN INEL-
 IGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM,  SUCH  RETIRED  MEMBER'S
 RETIREMENT  ALLOWANCE  SHALL BE SUSPENDED IN THE SAME MANNER AS PROVIDED
 IN THIS SECTION.
  d. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  article,  a  retired
 member who rejoins the system under the provisions of [paragraphs a or c
 of] this subdivision shall only be entitled to a death benefit according
 to  the  provisions  of  paragraph  two of subdivision b of section five
 hundred twelve of this article and of no other subdivision  thereof  and
 for  the purposes of said paragraph two of subdivision b of section five
 hundred twelve the credited service as a teacher shall be service  as  a
 teacher credited since last joining the system.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 S. 7462--A  3
 
  This bill would amend subdivision 11 of Section 503 of  the  Education
 Law to allow a retired member of the New York State Teachers' Retirement
 System  (NYSTRS),  who  returns  to  active  service  and suspends their
 pension benefit, to elect to combine their service credit  earned  prior
 to  their retirement with the service credit earned after their restora-
 tion to active service, provided they have earned at least two years  of
 service  credit  since restoration and they pay back their prior pension
 received or have the new benefit reduced for life based upon the actuar-
 ial equivalent of the prior pension received. Current law requires  five
 years  of service credit since restoration to combine all service credit
 into one pension benefit. State employees and other members of  the  New
 York State and Local Retirement System (NYS&LRS) are eligible to combine
 their  service  credit  after  earning two years of service credit after
 restoration. This bill would make this eligibility the same for teachers
 as it is for state employees. This bill would take effect on the  sixti-
 eth day after it shall become a law.
  The  annual  cost  to  the  employers of members of the New York State
 Teachers' Retirement System would be negligible if this bill is enacted.
  Member data is from  the  System's  most  recent  actuarial  valuation
 files,  consisting  of  data provided by the employers to the Retirement
 System.  Data distributions and statistics can be found in the  System's
 Annual  Report.  System assets are as reported in the System's financial
 statements and can also be found in the System's Annual Report. Actuari-
 al assumptions and methods are provided in the System's Actuarial  Valu-
 ation Report.

 System and is intended for use only during the 2024 Legislative Session.
