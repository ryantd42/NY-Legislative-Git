  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision 1 of section 2879-a of the public authorities
 law, as added by chapter 506 of the laws of 2009, is amended to read  as
 follows:
  1. Except as set forth in subdivision three of this section, where the
 comptroller determines pursuant to his or her authority to supervise the
 accounts  of  public  corporations,  that  contracts  or  categories  of
 contracts in excess of one million dollars [(a)]  to  be  awarded  by  a
 state  authority  [to  a single source, a sole source or pursuant to any
 other method of procurement that is not competitive, or (b) which are to
 be paid in whole or in part from monies appropriated by the state  to  a
 state  authority  for such contractual expenditure], require supervision
 in the form of prior review and approval  of  such  contracts,  and  the
 comptroller  so  notifies such authority of such determination, then any
 such contract entered into subsequent  to  such  notification  shall  be
 submitted  to the comptroller for his or her approval and shall not be a
 valid enforceable contract unless it shall first have been  approved  by
 the  comptroller.  Such  notification  shall  identify  the  process for
 submission, the categories of contracts at issue and the time period for
 which such submission is to take place. The comptroller shall promulgate
 such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out his  or  her
 responsibilities  under  this  section, including but not limited to the
 standards for determining which contracts will be subject to his or  her
 review and for approving such contracts.
  §  2.  This  act  shall take effect on the sixtieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
