 AN ACT to amend the executive law, in relation  to  the  designation  of
  "Srebrenica Genocide Remembrance Day" as a day of commemoration
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. This act arises from a sense  of  human
 decency  and  respect for the Srebrenica people and their history. It is
 the intent of this legislative body to designate July 11 of each  calen-
 dar  year  as  "Srebrenica Genocide Remembrance Day" in the state of New
 York.  Fifty years after the world said "Never Again" to the horrors  of
 the Holocaust, genocide took place on European soil. The name Srebrenica
 has  become  synonymous  with  those dark days in July 1995 when, in the
 first ever United Nations (UN) declared safe area, thousands of men  and
 boys  were  systematically  murdered  and  buried  in  mass  graves. The
 victims, who were Muslim, were selected for death on the basis of  their
 identity;  this was the worst atrocity on European soil since the Second
 World War.  During the Srebrenica massacre,  more  than  7,000  Bosniak
 (Bosnian  Muslim)  boys  and  men  were  slain by Bosnian Serb forces in
 Srebrenica, a town in eastern Bosnia and  Herzegovina;  in  addition  to
 these  killings,  more than 20,000 civilians were expelled from the area
 in a process known as ethnic cleansing. The  massacre  helped  galvanize
 the  West to press for a cease-fire that ended three years of warfare on
 Bosnia's territory, however, it left deep emotional scars  on  survivors
 and  created  enduring  obstacles  to  political  reconciliation  among
 Bosnia's ethnic groups.  Beginning in 1992, Bosnian Serb forces targeted
 Srebrenica in a campaign to seize control of a  block  of  territory  in
 eastern  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina; their eventual goal was to annex this
 territory to the adjacent  republic  of  Serbia,  and  to  do  so,  they
 believed, required the expulsion of the territory's Bosniak inhabitants,
 who  opposed annexation.  In March of 1995, Radovan Karadzic, president

 of the self-declared autonomous Republika Srpska  (Bosnian  Serb  Repub-
 lic), directed his military forces to "create an unbearable situation of
 total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhab-
 itants  of  Srebrenica".  By  May, a cordon of Bosnian Serb soldiers had
 imposed an embargo on food and other supplies that provoked most of  the
 town's  Bosniak  fighters  to  flee  the  area; in late June, after some
 skirmishes with the few remaining Bosniak  fighters,  the  Bosnian  Serb
 military  command formally ordered the operation, code-named Krivaja 95,
 that culminated in the massacre. The  offensive  commenced  on  July  6,
 1995,  with  Bosnian  Serb  forces  advancing from the south and burning
 Bosniak homes along the way; amid chaos and terror, thousands of  civil-
 ians fled Srebrenica for the nearby village of Potocari, where a contin-
 gent  of  about  200 Dutch peacekeepers was stationed; some of the Dutch
 surrendered, while others withdrew; none fired on the advancing  Bosnian
 Serb forces. On July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic
 strolled  through  Srebrenica  and, in a statement recorded on film by a
 Serb journalist, said, "We give this town to the Serb nation.  The  time
 has come to take revenge on the Muslims". On the night of July 11, 1995,
 a column of more than 10,000 Bosniak men set off from Srebrenica through
 dense  forest  in  an  attempt  to reach safety; beginning the following
 morning, Bosnian Serb officers used UN equipment and made false promises
 of security to encourage the men to surrender; thousands gave themselves
 up or were captured, and many were subsequently executed. Other Bosniaks
 were forced out of Potocari that day through  the  use  of  terror;  the
 women,  children,  and  elderly  were  placed aboard buses and driven to
 Bosniak-held territory, while the men and boys  were  taken  to  various
 holding  sites, mostly in Bratunac. The total number of men and boys who
 were slaughtered was initially a matter  of  some  debate;  under  heavy
 international pressure, the government of the Republika Srpska issued an
 apology in 2004 for the "enormous crimes" in Srebrenica and acknowledged
 that an estimated 7,800 had perished. The process of locating the graves
 and  identifying  the victims was complicated by a well-organized effort
 undertaken by Bosnian Serb forces in September and October 1995 to  hide
 traces  of the Srebrenica crimes; soldiers used heavy tractors and back-
 hoes to dig up mass graves and moved the disinterred remains to  distant
 sites,  many  of  which  were later located by U.S. intelligence experts
 using satellite photographs. Furthermore, it required years of  analysis
 by  Western  scientists to piece together exactly where the killings had
 occurred and how the bodies had been moved among an  estimated  80  mass
 grave  sites;  by  early  2010,  the International Commission on Missing
 Persons, a nongovernmental organization established in  1996,  had  used
 DNA  samples to identify more than 6,400 individual victims. By consist-
 ently remembering and forcefully  condemning  the  atrocities  committed
 against  these  people,  and  honoring  the  survivors  as well as other
 victims of similar heinous conduct, we guard against repetition of  such
 acts  of  genocide and provide the American public with a greater under-
 standing of history.  This  act  declares  that  this  legislative  body
 deplores  the persistent, ongoing efforts by any person, in this country
 or abroad, to deny the historical fact of the Srebrenica  Genocide;  the
 failure  of  the  international  community  to  hold responsible nations
 accountable for crimes against humanity results in travesty of  justice,
 and  sets  a  negative  precedent.  The  state  of New York endeavors to
 encourage and promote a curriculum relating to human rights and genocide
 in order to empower future generations  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of
 genocide.
