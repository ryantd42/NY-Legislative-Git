 S. 970  2
 
 CONVICTION  RECORDS  FOR  NO  MORE  THAN  THREE OF THE DEFENDANT'S PRIOR
 ELIGIBLE MISDEMEANORS BE CONDITIONALLY SEALED.  THE COURT MAY ONLY  SEAL
 THE  RECORDS  OF  THE  DEFENDANT'S ARRESTS, PROSECUTIONS AND CONVICTIONS
 WHEN:
  (A)  THE SENTENCING COURT HAS REQUESTED AND RECEIVED FROM THE DIVISION
 OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OR THE FEDERAL BUREAU  OF  INVESTIGATION  A
 FINGERPRINT  BASED  CRIMINAL  HISTORY RECORD OF THE DEFENDANT, INCLUDING
 ANY SEALED OR SUPPRESSED INFORMATION. THE DIVISION OF  CRIMINAL  JUSTICE
 SERVICES  SHALL ALSO INCLUDE A CRIMINAL HISTORY REPORT, IF ANY, FROM THE
 FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION REGARDING ANY CRIMINAL HISTORY  INFORMA-
 TION  THAT  OCCURRED  IN  OTHER  JURISDICTIONS.  THE  DIVISION IS HEREBY
 AUTHORIZED TO RECEIVE SUCH INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVES-
 TIGATION FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE PARTIES SHALL  BE  PERMITTED  TO  EXAMINE
 THESE RECORDS;
  (B)  THE  DEFENDANT OR COURT HAS IDENTIFIED THE MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION
 OR CONVICTIONS FOR WHICH RELIEF MAY BE GRANTED;
  (C) THE COURT HAS RECEIVED DOCUMENTATION THAT THE SENTENCES IMPOSED ON
 THE ELIGIBLE MISDEMEANOR CONVICTIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, OR IF NO  SUCH
 DOCUMENTATION  IS  REASONABLY  AVAILABLE,  A  SWORN  AFFIDAVIT  THAT THE
 SENTENCES IMPOSED ON THE PRIOR MISDEMEANORS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED; AND
  (D) THE COURT HAS NOTIFIED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF EACH  JURISDICTION
 IN  WHICH THE DEFENDANT HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF AN OFFENSE WITH RESPECT TO
 WHICH SEALING IS SOUGHT, AND THE COURT OR  COURTS  OF  RECORD  FOR  SUCH
 OFFENSES,  THAT  THE  COURT  IS  CONSIDERING  SEALING THE RECORDS OF THE
 DEFENDANT'S ELIGIBLE MISDEMEANOR CONVICTIONS. BOTH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
 AND THE COURT SHALL BE GIVEN A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY, WHICH  SHALL  NOT
 BE  LESS  THAN  THIRTY DAYS, IN WHICH TO COMMENT AND SUBMIT MATERIALS TO
 AID THE COURT IN MAKING SUCH A DETERMINATION. WHEN THE COURT NOTIFIES  A
 DISTRICT  ATTORNEY OF A SEALING APPLICATION, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SHALL
 PROVIDE NOTICE TO THE VICTIM, IF ANY,  OF  THE  SEALING  APPLICATION  BY
 MAILING  WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE VICTIM'S LAST-KNOWN ADDRESS. FOR PURPOSES
 OF THIS SECTION "VICTIM" MEANS ANY PERSON WHO HAS SUSTAINED PHYSICAL  OR
 FINANCIAL  INJURY  TO  PERSON  OR  TO PROPERTY AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE
 MISDEMEANOR CRIME OR MISDEMEANOR CRIMES FOR WHICH SEALING IS APPLIED.
  4. AT THE REQUEST OF THE DEFENDANT OR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF A COUN-
 TY IN WHICH THE DEFENDANT COMMITTED A CRIME THAT IS THE SUBJECT  OF  THE
 SEALING  APPLICATION,  THE  COURT  MAY CONDUCT A HEARING TO CONSIDER AND
 REVIEW ANY RELEVANT EVIDENCE OFFERED BY EITHER PARTY THAT WOULD AID  THE
 COURT  IN  ITS  DECISION  WHETHER TO SEAL THE RECORDS OF THE DEFENDANT'S
 ARRESTS, PROSECUTIONS AND CONVICTIONS.  IN MAKING SUCH A  DETERMINATION,
 THE COURT SHALL CONSIDER ANY RELEVANT FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO:
  (A)  THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE OR OFFENSES THAT
 RESULTED IN THE CONVICTION OR CONVICTIONS;
  (B) THE CHARACTER OF THE DEFENDANT, INCLUDING WHAT STEPS THE PETITION-
 ER HAS TAKEN SINCE THE TIME OF THE  OFFENSE  TOWARD  PERSONAL  REHABILI-
 TATION,  INCLUDING  TREATMENT,  WORK,  SCHOOL, OR OTHER PERSONAL HISTORY
 THAT DEMONSTRATES REHABILITATION;
  (C) THE DEFENDANT'S CRIMINAL HISTORY;
  (D) THE IMPACT OF SEALING THE DEFENDANT'S  RECORDS  UPON  HIS  OR  HER
 REHABILITATION  AND  HIS  OR  HER  SUCCESSFUL AND PRODUCTIVE REENTRY AND
 REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY, AND ON PUBLIC SAFETY; AND
  (E) ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY THE VICTIM OF THE OFFENSE WHERE THERE IS IN
 FACT A VICTIM OF THE CRIME.
  5. AFTER A COURT DECLARES ITS WILLINGNESS  TO  GRANT  THE  DEFENDANT'S
 REQUEST FOR CONDITIONAL SEALING PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, BUT BEFORE THE
 S. 970  3
 
 COURT ORDERS SEALING PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, THE DEFENDANT SHALL PAY A
 MANDATORY CONDITIONAL SEALING FEE. THE MANDATORY CONDITIONAL SEALING FEE
 WILL  BE  A  FEE  OF  EIGHTY  DOLLARS, HOWEVER, SUCH FILING FEE SHALL BE
 WAIVED  IN CASES OF INDIGENCE. THE MANDATORY FILING FEE SHALL BE PAID TO
 THE CLERK OF THE COURT OR  ADMINISTRATIVE  TRIBUNAL  THAT  RENDERED  THE
 CONVICTION.  WITHIN THE FIRST TEN DAYS OF THE MONTH FOLLOWING COLLECTION
 OF THE MANDATORY FILING FEE, THE COLLECTING AUTHORITY IF IT IS AN ADMIN-
 ISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL, OR A TOWN OR VILLAGE JUSTICE COURT, SHALL  THEN  PAY
 SUCH  MONEY TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER WHO SHALL DEPOSIT SUCH MONEY IN THE
 STATE TREASURY PURSUANT TO SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE OF  THE  STATE
 FINANCE  LAW  TO THE CREDIT OF THE INDIGENT LEGAL SERVICES FUND. IF SUCH
 COLLECTING AUTHORITY IS ANY OTHER COURT OF THE UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM,  IT
 SHALL,  WITHIN SUCH PERIOD, PAY SUCH MONEY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MANDATORY
 FILING FEE TO THE STATE COMMISSIONER OF  TAXATION  AND  FINANCE  TO  THE
 CREDIT  OF THE INDIGENT LEGAL SERVICES FUND ESTABLISHED BY SECTION NINE-
 TY-EIGHT-B OF THE STATE FINANCE LAW.
  6. WHEN A COURT ORDERS SEALING PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, ALL  OFFICIAL
 RECORDS  AND  PAPERS  RELATING  TO  THE  ARRESTS,  PROSECUTIONS,  AND
 CONVICTIONS, INCLUDING ALL DUPLICATES AND COPIES THEREOF, ON  FILE  WITH
 THE  DIVISION  OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OR ANY COURT SHALL BE SEALED
 AND NOT MADE AVAILABLE TO  ANY  PERSON  OR  PUBLIC  OR  PRIVATE  AGENCY;
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THE  DIVISION  SHALL RETAIN ANY FINGERPRINTS, PALM-
 PRINTS, PHOTOGRAPHS, OR DIGITAL IMAGES OF THE SAME.
  7. WHEN THE COURT ORDERS SEALING PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION,  THE  CLERK
 OF  SUCH COURT SHALL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE COMMISSIONER OF THE DIVISION

 FORMALLY  CHARGED  WITH  ANY MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY OFFENSE, SUCH RECORDS
 SHALL BE UNSEALED IMMEDIATELY AND REMAIN  UNSEALED;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
 THAT  IF  SUCH NEW MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY ARREST RESULTS IN A TERMINATION
 IN FAVOR OF THE ACCUSED AS  DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION  THREE  OF  SECTION
