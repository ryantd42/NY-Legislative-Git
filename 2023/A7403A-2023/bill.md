 subdivision,  whether  or not insured or guaranteed by the United States
 of America or any agency thereof, provided, however,  that  such  second

 at the same time as a new housing loan purchased by the agency  pursuant
 to  section twenty-four hundred five-c of this part. The term "mortgage"

 to  a bank by an individual borrower incurred for the purpose of financ-
 ing the purchase of certificates of stock or other evidence of ownership
 of an interest in, and a proprietary lease from, a  cooperative  housing
 corporation formed for the purpose of the cooperative ownership of resi-
 dential  real  estate in the state, secured by an assignment or transfer

 ance shall be conditioned on removal of such violations to the satisfac-
 tion of the local code enforcement agency; and (e)  satisfy  such  addi-
