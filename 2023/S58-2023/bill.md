 Lawrence,  Steuben,  Sullivan, Tioga, Tompkins, Ulster, Warren, Washing-
 ton, Wayne, Wyoming, [or] Yates, OR ANY AREA IN THE COUNTIES OF ROCKLAND
 OR WESTCHESTER WHICH IS NOT LOCATED IN THE FILM ZONE AS DEFINED IN PARA-
 GRAPH  NINE  OF SUBDIVISION (B) OF THIS SECTION. The aggregate amount of
 tax credits allowed pursuant to the authority of this paragraph shall be
 five million dollars each year during the period  two  thousand  fifteen
 through two thousand twenty-nine of the annual allocation made available
 to  the  program  pursuant  to paragraph four of subdivision (e) of this
 section. Such aggregate amount of credits  shall  be  allocated  by  the
 governor's  office  for  motion picture and television development among
 taxpayers in order of priority based upon the date of filing an applica-
 tion for allocation of film production credit with such office.  If  the
 total  amount  of  allocated credits applied for under this paragraph in
 any year exceeds the aggregate amount of tax credits  allowed  for  such
 year  under  this paragraph, such excess shall be treated as having been
 applied for on the first day of the next year. If the  total  amount  of
 allocated tax credits applied for under this paragraph at the conclusion
 of  any  year  is less than five million dollars, the remainder shall be
 treated as part of the annual allocation made available to  the  program
 pursuant  to paragraph four of subdivision (e) of this section. However,
 in no event may the total of the credits allocated under this  paragraph
 and  the  credits  allocated  under paragraph five of subdivision (a) of
 section thirty-one of this article exceed five million  dollars  in  any
 year  during  the period two thousand fifteen through two thousand twen-
 ty-nine.
  § 2. Subdivision (b) of section 24 of the tax law is amended by adding
 a new paragraph 9 to read as follows:
  (9) "FILM ZONE" SHALL MEAN AN AREA WITHIN A TWENTY-FIVE MILE RADIUS OF
 COLUMBUS CIRCLE IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
