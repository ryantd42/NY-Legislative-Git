  COMMEMORATING the 25th Anniversary of the Old Town
  of Eaton Museum
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body that the quality
of life of the citizens of the State of New York is greatly enriched  by
its exceptional cultural, educational and recreational institutions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern  and  in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Old Town of Eaton Museum; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1995,  the Old Town of Eaton Museum was established in
the Wood House on Brooklyn Street, and three years later, it  was  moved
to the ancient stone building on River Road, one of the few early rubble
buildings built just after the 1790s; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  stone building was used as an early tannery before it
became the home of the town's shoemakers, the Sprague family who  served
their community for numerous years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today,  the  Old  Town  of Eaton Museum features a special
display for William Sprague, a second-generation shoemaker who lived  in
the house; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  success  of the Old Town of Eaton Museum is in direct
correlation to the efforts of  its  dedicated  staff  and  board,  whose
involvement  is,  and  always  has  been, characterized by an impressive
commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising  standard  of
excellence  in  all  endeavors  on  behalf  of  the organization and the
community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
institutions  of  such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be recognized and applauded by all  the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Old Town of Eaton Museum; and be
it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Old Town of Eaton Museum.
