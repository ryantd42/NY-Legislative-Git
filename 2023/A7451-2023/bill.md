 without the written informed consent of the person to whom such  genetic
 test  relates.  This  information shall not be released to any person or
 organization not specifically authorized by the  individual  subject  of
 the  test.  Unauthorized  solicitation or possession of such information

 administration,  provided, however, that further distribution within the
 insurer or to other recipients  shall  require  the  subject's  informed
 consent in each case.]
  (b) No person who lawfully possesses information derived from a genet-
 ic test on a biological sample from an individual shall incorporate such

 NECESSARY RECORDS TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO CONFIRM SUCH GENETIC  TEST
 WAS  COMPLETED  AND  THE RECORDS, FINDINGS, OR RESULTS OF SUCH TEST WERE
 RECEIVED BY SUCH PROVIDER.
