  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Part  JJJ  of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019 amending the
 criminal procedure law relating  to  the  issuance  of  securing  orders
 relating to making conforming changes is REPEALED.
  §  2.  Part UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2020 amending the criminal
 procedure law, the judiciary law  and  the  executive  law  relating  to
 securing orders and pretrial proceedings relations thereto is REPEALED.

 amended  by  chapter  681  of  the  laws  of 1990, is amended to read as
 follows:
  2. If a felony complaint against the defendant was pending in a  local
 criminal court or if the defendant was previously held by a local crimi-
 nal  court  for the action of the grand jury, and if the defendant is at
 liberty on his or her own recognizance or on bail pursuant to a previous
 court order issued in the same criminal action, the superior court must,

 in subdivision one, direct the defendant to appear before  the  superior
 court  for  arraignment  on a specified date.  If the defendant fails to
 appear on such date, the court may issue a bench warrant and,  in  addi-
 tion,  may  forfeit  the  bail,  if  any. Upon taking the defendant into
 custody pursuant to such bench warrant,  the  executing  police  officer
 must  without unnecessary delay bring the defendant before such superior
 court for arraignment. If such superior  court  is  not  available,  the
 executing  police  officer  may bring the defendant to the local correc-
 tional facility of the county in which such superior court sits,  to  be
 detained there until not later than the commencement of the next session
 of such court occurring on the next business day.
  §  4. Paragraph (e) of subdivision 1 of section 420.10 of the criminal
 procedure law, as amended by chapter 618 of the laws of 1992, is amended
 to read as follows:
  (e) Where [cash] bail has been posted by the defendant as the  princi-
 pal  and  is  not forfeited or assigned, the court at its discretion may
 order that bail be applied toward payment of any order of restitution or
 reparation or fine. If the court so orders, the bail proceeds  shall  be
 applied  to  payment  first of the restitution or reparation and then of
 the fine.
  § 5. Subdivision 9 of section 500.10 of the criminal procedure law, as
 amended by section 1-e of part JJJ of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is
 amended to read as follows:
  9. "Bail" means [cash bail,] a bail bond or money paid with  a  credit
 card.
  § 6. Subdivision 10 of section 500.10 of the criminal procedure law is
 REPEALED.
  §  7. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 520.10 of the criminal
 procedure law is REPEALED.
  § 8. Section 520.15 of the criminal procedure law is REPEALED.
  § 9. The opening paragraph of subdivision 1 of section 520.30  of  the
 criminal  procedure  law, as amended by chapter 384 of the laws of 1984,
 is amended to read as follows:
  Following the posting of a bail bond and the justifying  affidavit  or
 affidavits  [or  the  posting  of  cash  bail], the court may conduct an
 inquiry for the purpose of determining the reliability of  the  obligors
 or person posting [cash] bail, the value and sufficiency of any security
 offered,  and  whether any feature of the undertaking contravenes public
 policy; provided that before undertaking an inquiry, of a person posting
 [cash] bail the court, after application of the district attorney,  must
 have had reasonable cause to believe that the person posting [cash] bail
 is  not  in  rightful  possession of money posted as [cash] bail or that
 such money constitutes the fruits of criminal or unlawful  conduct.  The
 court may inquire into any matter stated or required to be stated in the
 justifying affidavits, and may also inquire into other matters appropri-
 ate  to  the  determination,  which  include  but are not limited to the
 following:
  § 10. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of subdivision 1 of section 520.30 of the
 criminal procedure law are REPEALED.
  § 11. Section 520.40 of the criminal procedure law is REPEALED.
  § 12. Subdivisions 2 and 3 of section 530.80 of the criminal procedure
 law, as amended by chapter 384 of the laws of 1984, are amended to  read
 as follows:
  2.  For the purpose of surrendering the defendant, an obligor or the
 person who posted [cash] bail for the defendant may take him into custo-
 dy at any place within the state, or he  may,  by  a  written  authority
 S. 2521  3
 
 indorsed  on  a certified copy of the bail bond, empower any person over
 twenty years of age to do so.
  3.  At  any time before the forfeiture of [cash] bail, the defendant
 may surrender himself or the person who posted bail  for  the  defendant
 may  surrender the defendant in the manner prescribed in subdivision one
 OF THIS SECTION. In such case, the court must  order  a  return  of  the
 money to the person who posted it, upon producing the certificate of the
 sheriff  showing  the  surrender,  and upon a notice of five days to the
 district attorney.
  § 13. Section 540.10 of the criminal procedure law, subdivision  2  as
 amended  by chapter 427 of the laws of 1998 and subdivision 3 as amended
 by chapter 384 of the laws of 1984, is amended to read as follows:
 § 540.10  Forfeiture of bail; generally.
  1.  If, without sufficient excuse, a principal does  not  appear  when
 required or does not render himself amenable to the orders and processes
 of the criminal court wherein bail has been posted, the court must enter
 such facts upon its minutes and the bail bond or the [cash] bail, as the
 case may be, is thereupon forfeited.
  2.  If the principal appears at any time before the final adjournment
 of the court, and satisfactorily excuses  his  neglect,  the  court  may
 direct  the forfeiture to be discharged upon such terms as are just.  If
 the forfeiture is not so discharged and the forfeited bail consisted  of
 a bail bond, the district attorney, within one hundred twenty days after
 the  adjournment  of  the  court  at  which such bond was directed to be
 forfeited, must proceed against the obligor  or  obligors  who  executed
 such  bond,  in  the  manner  prescribed in subdivision three.  [If the
 forfeited bail consisted of cash bail, the county treasurer with whom it
 is deposited shall give written notice of the forfeiture to  the  person
 who  posted  cash bail for the defendant may at any time after the final
 adjournment of the court or forty-five days after notice  of  forfeiture
 required  herein  has been given, whichever comes later, apply the money
 deposited to the use of the county.]
  3.  A bail bond [or cash bail], upon being forfeited, together with  a
 certified  copy  of  the order of the court forfeiting the same, must be
 filed by the district attorney in the office of the clerk of the  county
 wherein  such  order was issued.  Such clerk must docket the same in the
 book kept by him for docketing of judgments and enter therein a judgment
 against the obligor or obligors who executed  such  bail  bond  for  the
 amount  of the penalty of said bond or against the person who posted the
 [cash] bail for the amount of the [cash] bail,  and  the  bond  and  the
 certified  copy  of  the  order  of the court forfeiting the bond or the
 [cash] bail constitutes the judgment roll. Such judgment  constitutes  a
 lien  on  the  real  estate of the obligor or obligors who executed such
 bail bond from the time of the entry of the judgment.  An execution  may
 be  issued  to collect the amount of said bail bond in the same form and
 with the same effect as upon a judgment recovered in an action  in  said
 county  upon  a  debt  in  favor  of the people of the state of New York
 against such obligor or obligors.
  § 14. Subdivision 2 of section 540.20 of the criminal procedure law is
 REPEALED.
  § 15. The opening paragraph of subdivision 1 of section 540.30 of  the
 criminal procedure law is amended to read as follows:
  After  the  forfeiture  of  a bail bond or [cash] bail, as provided in
 section 540.10, an application for remission of such forfeiture  may  be
 made to a court as follows:

 rior  officers,  may,  in  such  place,  take [cash] bail for his or her
 appearance before the appropriate court the next morning from any person
 arrested pursuant to a warrant issued by the family court; provided that
 such arrest occurs between eleven  o'clock  in  the  morning  and  eight
 o'clock the next morning, except that in the city of New York bail shall
 be taken between two o'clock in the afternoon and eight o'clock the next
 morning. The amount of such [cash] bail shall be the amount fixed in the
 warrant of arrest.
  §  17.  The  section  heading and subdivision 1 of section 99-m of the
 general municipal law, as amended by chapter 166 of the  laws  of  1991,
 are amended to read as follows:
  [Cash  bail]  BAIL and partially secured bail bond; fee for deposit of
 money. 1. When, pursuant to the provisions of title P  of  the  criminal
 procedure  law or the provisions of the family court act, a sum of money
 deposited in connection with [a cash] bail or a partially  secured  bail
 bond  is received by a court or other authorized public servant or agen-
 cy, such money shall be deposited in the same manner as may  be  by  law
 provided  for  the  deposit  of  money generally received by such court,
 public servant or agency. Except as otherwise provided herein, the coun-
 ty treasurer, or, in the city of New York, the commissioner of  finance,
 shall  be  entitled to a fee of two per centum of the amount of money so
 deposited and an additional fee of one per centum as provided in  subdi-
 vision  three  of this section. Where the money received by a state-paid
 court hereunder is not deposited with any other officer or agency but is
 retained by the court, the clerk of such court shall be  entitled  to  a
 fee  of  two per centum of the amount of money so retained, and an addi-
 tional fee of one per centum to be disbursed as provided in  subdivision
 three  of  this  section. All fees collected hereunder by the clerk of a
 state-paid court shall be paid to the state commissioner of taxation and
 finance on a monthly basis not later than ten days after the last day of
 each month. Except as otherwise provided by an order issued pursuant  to
 section  420.10  of  the criminal procedure law, upon the exoneration or
 remission of the bail, the money so deposited, less such fee, shall,  by
 order of the appropriate court, be refunded to the person who originally
 deposited  such  money.  Upon  a  termination  of the criminal action or
 proceeding in favor of the accused, as defined  in  subdivision  two  of
 section  160.50 of the criminal procedure law, the two per centum fee so
 retained shall, by order of the appropriate court, be  refunded  to  the
 person who originally deposited such money.
  §  18.  Subsection (o) of section 6802 of the insurance law is amended
 to read as follows:

 state to execute and issue policies of motor vehicle and aircraft insur-
 ance  as  specified  in  paragraphs  thirteen,  fourteen and nineteen of
 subsection (a) of section one thousand  one  hundred  thirteen  of  this
 chapter  or  to  any  agent  of such insurer or to any broker who, as an
 incident to the execution and issuance of any  such  policy  or  to  the
 solicitation,  negotiation  or procurement thereof undertakes to pay, in
 addition to the applicable limits of liability, the cost of  bail  bonds
 required  of  the  insured  because  of accident or asserted traffic law
 violations arising out of the use of a vehicle insured under  the  terms
 of  the policy, provided the cost of each such bail bond does not exceed
 S. 2521  5

 one hundred dollars, or who otherwise arranges for the  execution  of  a
 bail  bond or deposit in lieu of [cash] bail on behalf of the insured in
 the event of the insured's arrest or detention by reason of an  asserted
 violation of any law relating to the use of a motor vehicle.
  §  19.  Section 798 of the judiciary law, as amended by chapter 708 of

 the term of the court was held, where  the  fine  was  imposed,  or  the
 recognizance taken, may, except as otherwise prescribed in section seven
 hundred  and  ninety-nine; upon good cause shown, and upon such terms as
 it deems just, make an order, remitting the fine, wholly or  partly,  or
 the  forfeiture  of the recognizance, or part of the penalty thereof; or
 it may discharge the recognizance. If a fine so remitted has been  paid,
