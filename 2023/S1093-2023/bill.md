 read as follows:
  1. Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature
 or  by  a  local  law adopted prior to September first, nineteen hundred
 fifty-three, all contracts for public work involving an  expenditure  of
 more  than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  WHICH  ARE  SUBJECT  TO  THE
 PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE EIGHT OF THE LABOR LAW, and all purchase contracts
 involving an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall  be
 awarded  by  the  appropriate  officer,  board  or agency of a political
 subdivision or of any district therein including but not  limited  to  a
 soil  conservation  district to the lowest responsible bidder furnishing
 the required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the  manner
 provided  by  this  section,  provided, however, that purchase contracts
 (including contracts  for  service  work,  but  excluding  any  purchase
 contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursu-
 ant  to  article  eight of the labor law) may be awarded on the basis of
 best value, as defined in section one hundred sixty-three of  the  state
 finance  law,  to  a responsive and responsible bidder or offerer in the
 manner provided by this section except that in a  political  subdivision
 other  than  a city with a population of one million inhabitants or more
 or any district, board or agency with jurisdiction  exclusively  therein
 the  use  of  best  value  for  awarding a purchase contract or purchase
 contracts must be authorized by local law or, in the case of a  district
 corporation,  school  district  or  board  of  cooperative  educational
 services, by rule, regulation or resolution adopted at a public meeting.
 SUCH OFFICER, BOARD, OR AGENCY MAY REQUIRE RESPONSIBLE BIDDERS AND THEIR
 SUBCONTRACTORS  TO  PARTICIPATE  IN  APPRENTICESHIP  TRAINING  PROGRAMS
 APPROVED  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF LABOR. In any case where a responsible
 bidder's or responsible offerer's gross price is reducible by an  allow-
 ance  for  the value of used machinery, equipment, apparatus or tools to
 be traded in by a  political  subdivision,  the  gross  price  shall  be
 reduced  by the amount of such allowance, for the purpose of determining
 the best value.  In cases where two or more responsible bidders furnish-
 ing the required security submit identical bids as to price, such  offi-
 cer, board or agency may award the contract to any of such bidders. Such
 officer,  board  or  agency may, in his or her or its discretion, reject
 all bids or offers and readvertise for new bids or offers in the  manner
 provided  by  this  section.  In  determining  whether  a purchase is an
 expenditure within the discretionary threshold  amounts  established  by
 this  subdivision,  the officer, board or agency of a political subdivi-
 sion or of any district therein shall consider the  reasonably  expected
 aggregate  amount  of all purchases of the same commodities, services or
 technology to be made within the twelve-month period commencing  on  the
 date  of  purchase.  Purchases  of commodities, services or technology
 shall not be artificially divided for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  the
 discretionary  buying  thresholds  established  by  this  subdivision. A
 change to or a renewal of a discretionary purchase shall not be  permit-
 ted  if the change or renewal would bring the reasonably expected aggre-
 gate amount of all purchases of the same commodities, services or  tech-
 nology  from the same provider within the twelve-month period commencing
 on the date of the first purchase to an amount greater than the  discre-
 S. 1093  5
 
 tionary  buying  threshold amount. For purposes of this section, "sealed
 bids" and "sealed offers", as that term applies to  purchase  contracts,
 (including  contracts  for  service  work,  but  excluding  any purchase
 contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursu-
 ant  to  article  eight  of the labor law) shall include bids and offers
 submitted in an electronic format including submission of the  statement
 of  non-collusion  required by section one hundred three-d of this arti-
 cle, provided that the governing board of the political  subdivision  or
 district,  by  resolution, has authorized the receipt of bids and offers
 in such format. Submission in  electronic  format  may,  for  technology
 contracts  only,  be  required  as the sole method for the submission of
 bids and offers. Bids and offers submitted in an electronic format shall
 be transmitted by bidders and offerers to the  receiving  device  desig-
 nated  by  the  political  subdivision  or  district. Any method used to
 receive electronic bids and offers shall comply with  article  three  of
 the  state technology law, and any rules and regulations promulgated and
 guidelines developed thereunder and, at a minimum, must (a) document the
 time and date of receipt of each bid and offer received  electronically;
 (b)  authenticate the identity of the sender; (c) ensure the security of
 the information transmitted; and (d) ensure the confidentiality  of  the
 bid or offer until the time and date established for the opening of bids
 or  offers.  The  timely  submission  of  an  electronic bid or offer in
 compliance with instructions provided for such submission in the  adver-
 tisement  for  bids  or  offers  and/or  the specifications shall be the
 responsibility solely of each bidder or offerer or prospective bidder or
 offerer. No political subdivision or district therein  shall  incur  any
 liability from delays of or interruptions in the receiving device desig-
 nated for the submission and receipt of electronic bids and offers.
  §  8.  Subdivision  1  of section 103 of the general municipal law, as
 amended by section 2 of chapter 2 of the laws of  2012,  is  amended  to
 read as follows:
  1. Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature
 or  by  a  local  law adopted prior to September first, nineteen hundred
 fifty-three, all contracts for public work involving an  expenditure  of
 more  than  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  WHICH  ARE  SUBJECT  TO  THE
 PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE EIGHT OF THE LABOR LAW, and all purchase contracts
 involving an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall  be
 awarded  by  the  appropriate  officer,  board  or agency of a political
 subdivision or of any district therein including but not  limited  to  a
 soil  conservation  district to the lowest responsible bidder furnishing
 the required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the  manner
 provided  by  this  section,  provided, however, that purchase contracts
 (including contracts  for  service  work,  but  excluding  any  purchase
 contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursu-
 ant  to  article  eight of the labor law) may be awarded on the basis of
 best value, as defined in section one hundred sixty-three of  the  state
 finance  law,  to  a responsive and responsible bidder or offerer in the
 manner provided by this section except that in a  political  subdivision
 other  than  a city with a population of one million inhabitants or more
 or any district, board or agency with jurisdiction  exclusively  therein
 the  use  of  best  value  of  awarding  a purchase contract or purchase
 contracts must be authorized by local law or, in the case of a  district
 corporation,  school  district  or  board  of  cooperative  educational
 services, by rule, regulation or resolution adopted at a public meeting.
 SUCH OFFICER, BOARD, OR AGENCY MAY REQUIRE RESPONSIBLE BIDDERS AND THEIR
 SUBCONTRACTORS  TO  PARTICIPATE  IN  APPRENTICESHIP  TRAINING  PROGRAMS
 S. 1093  6
 
 APPROVED  BY  THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. In determining whether a purchase
 is an expenditure within the discretionary threshold amounts established
 by this subdivision, the officer, board or agency of a political  subdi-
 vision or of any district therein shall consider the reasonably expected
 aggregate  amount  of all purchases of the same commodities, services or
 technology to be made within the twelve-month period commencing  on  the
 date of purchase. Purchases of commodities, services or technology shall
 not  be  artificially  divided for the purpose of satisfying the discre-
 tionary buying thresholds established by this subdivision. A  change  to
 or  a  renewal of a discretionary purchase shall not be permitted if the
 change or renewal would bring the reasonably expected  aggregate  amount
 of  all  purchases  of the same commodities, services or technology from
 the same provider within the twelve-month period commencing on the  date
 of the first purchase to an amount greater than the discretionary buying
 threshold  amount. In any case where a responsible bidder's or responsi-
 ble offerer's gross price is reducible by an allowance for the value  of
 used machinery, equipment, apparatus or tools to be traded in by a poli-
 tical  subdivision,  the  gross  price shall be reduced by the amount of
 such allowance, for the purpose of  determining  the  low  bid  or  best
 value.  In  cases  where  two or more responsible bidders furnishing the
 required security submit identical bids as to price, such officer, board
 or agency may award the contract to any of such bidders.  Such  officer,
 board  or  agency may, in his, her or its discretion, reject all bids or
 offers and readvertise for new bids or offers in the manner provided  by
 this section.
