  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 16-22, 2023,  as  Abusive  Head  Trauma/Shaken
  Baby  Syndrome  Awareness  Week  in the State of New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  most  recent  statistics  compiled  by  the  federal
government  estimate  that  600,000  children  were victims of abuse and
neglect in the United States in 2021, of whom 27.3  percent  were  under
three years of age; and
 
  WHEREAS,  That  statistic includes 56,750 in New York State, of whom
11,686 or 20 percent were under three years of age; and
 
  WHEREAS, On an average day in  the  United  States,  at  least  five
children  will  die  as a consequence of abuse or neglect by a parent or
other person entrusted with their care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Children younger than one year of age  accounted  for  25.3
percent  of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2021, and children
four years of age or younger accounted for  nearly  two-thirds  or  63.5
percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2021; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  leading  cause  of death of abused children under age
five is Abusive Head Trauma, including  the  inflicted  trauma  commonly
known as Shaken Baby Syndrome; and
 
  WHEREAS, On average 1,200 to 1,400 children in the United States are
diagnosed  with  AHT/SBS  every  year,  and medical experts believe many
additional cases are likely misdiagnosed or undetected; and
 
  WHEREAS, Shaken Baby Syndrome and other inflicted head trauma occurs
when a caregiver loses control and shakes a baby or  young  child,  most
frequently  less  than  one year of age but in some cases as old as five
years of age, resulting in loss  of  vision,  brain  damage,  paralysis,
seizures, or death; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Shaken  Baby  Syndrome often causes permanent, irreparable
brain damage or death  to  an  infant,  and  may  result  in  more  than
$1,000,000  in medical and rehabilitation costs for the care of a single
disabled child during the first years of life; and
 
  WHEREAS, A growing body of medical evidence indicates that even mild
trauma to the brain caused by AHT/SBS is likely to  result  in  learning
disabilities  in  children  and  substantially  increase  the  risk  of
substance abuse; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in
2011 that the average cost of child maltreatment is  $210,012  over  the
course  of  a  victim's  lifetime, including the costs of child welfare,
special education, criminal justice  expenses,  medical  care  and  lost
productivity as an adult; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is estimated that the taxpayers of the State of New York
may,  through  the  State Medicaid program, pay as much as 41 percent of
the medical and rehabilitation costs of inflicted head injuries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Centers for Disease Control projects that child abuse
costs the Nation more than $124 billion a year, and the  cost  of  child
abuse in New York State would exceed $13 billion a year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  most  effective  way  to  end AHT/SBS is by educating
parents  and  caregivers  about  the  danger  of  shaking  children  and
providing  the skills needed to cope with frustration and anger, and the
minimal  costs  of  educational  and  preventative  programs  may  avert
enormous  medical  and  disability  costs  and  untold  grief  for  many
families; and
 
  WHEREAS, Evidence-based education and awareness  programs,  such  as
the  nationally recognized New York SBS Prevention Project, developed by
Dr.  Mark Dias with the support of the NYS Children and  Families  Trust
Fund,  and  implemented  in  collaboration  with  Kalieda  Health Women,
Children's Hospital of Buffalo, and the Maria Fareri Children's Hospital
of Westchester, are shown to  raise  awareness  and  provide  critically
important information about SBS to parents, caregivers, daycare workers,
and health care professionals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  NYS  Office  of  Children and Family Services used to
support the  work  of  hospital-based  education  programs  through  the
efforts  of  the  Safe  Babies New York program, bringing this and other
important safety information to the families of 160,000 babies born last
year in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Home visiting programs, such as Healthy Families New  York,
the  Nurse  Family  Partnership, and other programs for new parents show
great promise for preventing maltreatment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These prevention efforts are supported by national  groups
such  as the American Academy of Pediatrics, Prevent Child Abuse America
and the National Center for Shaken Baby Syndrome, as well as individuals
and organizations in New York State, such as  Prevent  Child  Abuse  New
York, the Cynthia Gibbs Foundation, and the SKIPPER Initiative, who work
to  educate  new  parents  and  caregivers, increase awareness among the
general public and professionals, and encourage  increased  support  for
victims  and  their  families  in  the  health care and criminal justice
systems; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The New York State Legislature has enacted legislation  to
help  increase  awareness  of AHT/SBS by requiring that: hospitals offer
written information about Shaken Baby Syndrome (2001);  new  child  care
providers  be  educated about the causes, consequences and prevention of
SBS before they are licensed to care for children (2003);  hospitals  to
offer  new  parents  the  opportunity to watch a video about the causes,
consequences and prevention of SBS so that they can help  protect  their
child  from  shaking injuries (2004); the Health Department coordinate a
statewide campaign to educate the public about the causes,  consequences
and  prevention  of  SBS  (2006);  the  Education  Department  provide a
curriculum on SBS to schools so that  students,  who  not  only  may  be
parents  someday, but who may be babysitting for young children now, are
educated about the importance of coping skills (2006); and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body wishes to  commend  those  advocates,
organizations  and agencies of State, county and local governments which
work continuously and tirelessly to educate parents and caregivers about
the causes, consequences, and prevention  of  SBS  and  other  inflicted
injuries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This Legislative Body particularly wishes to recognize the
nurse educators who provide education  to  new  parents  at  New  York's
maternity  hospitals  so  that  every  new parent has the opportunity to
learn how they can help protect their child from shaking injuries;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  16-22,  2023,  as
Abusive  Head Trauma/Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week in the State of
New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
