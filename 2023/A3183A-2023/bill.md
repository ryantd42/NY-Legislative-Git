 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The opening paragraph of subdivision 1 and subdivision 3 of
 section 510.10 of the criminal procedure law, subdivision 1  as  amended

 laws of 2019, are amended to read as follows:
  When a principal, whose future court attendance at a  criminal  action
 or proceeding is or may be required, comes under the control of a court,
 such  court  shall,  in  accordance with this title, by a securing order
 release the principal on the principal's own recognizance,  release  the
 principal  under non-monetary conditions, or, where authorized, fix bail
 or commit the principal to the custody  of  the  sheriff.  In  all  such
 cases,  except  where  another  type  of  securing  order is shown to be
 required by law, the court shall release the principal pending trial  on
 the  principal's  own  recognizance,  unless  it is demonstrated and the
 court makes an individualized determination that the principal  poses  a
 risk of flight to avoid prosecution OR THAT THE PRINCIPAL POSES A DANGER
 TO A PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY.  If such a finding is made, the court must
 select  the  least  restrictive  alternative and condition or conditions
 that will reasonably assure the principal's return to court.  The  court
 shall  explain  its  choice of release, release with conditions, bail or
 remand on the record [or] AND in writing. In making  its  determination,

 shall release the principal under non-monetary conditions, selecting the
 least restrictive alternative and conditions that will reasonably assure
 the  principal's  return to court. The court shall explain its choice of
 alternative and conditions on the record [or] AND in writing; OR

 reasonably assure the principal's return to court.  In  such  instances,
 the  court  shall  release  the principal under non-monetary conditions,
 selecting the least restrictive alternative  and  conditions  that  will
 reasonably  assure  the  principal's  return  to  court. The court shall
