 TO A PERSON OR THE COMMUNITY AND MAKE AN INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION AS
 TO  WHETHER  THE  PRINCIPAL poses a risk of flight to avoid prosecution,
 consider the kind and degree of  control  or  restriction  necessary  to
 reasonably assure the principal's return to court, and select a securing
 order  consistent  with  its  determination  under this subdivision. The
 court shall explain the basis for its determination and  its  choice  of

 inal prosecution;

 section,  the  court  shall  release  the principal pending trial on the
 principal's own recognizance, unless the court finds on the record  [or]
 AND in writing that:
  (A)  release  on  the principal's own recognizance will not reasonably

 for in subdivision three-a of section 500.10 of  this  title  that  will
 reasonably  assure  the  principal's  return  to  court. The court shall
 explain its choice of securing order on the record or in writing; OR

 IMPOSED PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH, WHERE SUCH EXTENSION IS  APPROPRIATE
 IN  THE  INTERESTS  OF  JUSTICE.  THE  COURT SHALL EXPLAIN ITS CHOICE OF
 ALTERNATIVE AND CONDITIONS ON THE RECORD AND IN WRITING.

 SHERIFF,  the  determination  for which shall be made in accordance with
 subdivision one of section 510.10 of this title. The court shall explain
 the basis for its determination and choice  of  securing  order  on  the

 section the court shall release the principal pending trial on the prin-
 cipal's own recognizance [or], release the principal pending trial under
