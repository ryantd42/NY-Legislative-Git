 PERSON  INCARCERATED THERE. THE COMMISSION SHALL NOT NEED TO APPLY FOR A
 COURT ORDER PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION BEFORE DECIDING

 RESULT  OF  ITS  INSPECTION  AND  ANALYSIS PUBLIC ONLINE BEFORE ITS NEXT
 STATED MEETING. SUCH ANALYSIS SHALL, AT A MINIMUM, INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION
 OF THE FACTORS CONTAINED IN SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION  FORTY-FIVE  OF
 THIS  ARTICLE.  AT SUCH MEETING, THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE WHETHER,
 BASED ON ITS INSPECTION AND ANALYSIS, THE  CORRECTIONAL  FACILITY  LACKS
 COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW OR REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE COMMISSION, AND
 WHETHER  SUCH  NON-COMPLIANCE POSES AN IMMINENT HARM TO ANY INCARCERATED

 SERIOUS  INJURY  SUFFERED  BY AN INCARCERATED PERSON IN THE CUSTODY OF A
 CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, THE COMMISSION SHALL PUBLISH  ON  ITS  WEBSITE  A
 REPORT  CONTAINING  THE  RESULT OF SUCH INVESTIGATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT
 LIMITATION THE COMPLETE RESULT OF THE COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATION OF SUCH
 INCIDENT, TRUE AND CORRECT COPIES OF RECORDS  THAT  THE  COMMISSION  HAS

 AL  FACILITIES,  AND INFORMATION ON UNCURED VIOLATIONS OF LAWS AND REGU-
 LATIONS AT ANY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN A SEARCHABLE DATABASE FORMAT  ON
 ITS WEBSITE IF THE COMMISSION DETERMINES THAT SUCH A FORMAT WILL FACILI-
 TATE GREATER PUBLIC ACCESS TO SUCH INFORMATION.
  (D)  IF,  IN  THE  COURSE  OF  THE  COMMISSION'S  INVESTIGATIONS  OR
 INSPECTIONS, THE COMMISSION FINDS EVIDENCE OF A PATTERN OF  MALFEASANCE,
 NONFEASANCE,  ABUSE, OR NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF STAFF OR MANAGEMENT AT
 ANY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, THE COMMISSION SHALL IMMEDIATELY REPORT  SUCH
 EVIDENCE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE COUN-
 TY  IN  WHICH  SUCH  CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IS LOCATED, AND SUCH EVIDENCE
