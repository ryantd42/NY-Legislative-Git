  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The vehicle and traffic law is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 404-ff to read as follows:
  §  404-FF.  DISTINCTIVE PLATES FOR FIRE POLICE. 1. ANY PERSON WHO IS A
 MEMBER OF THE FIRE POLICE OR THE SPOUSE OF ANY SUCH PERSON  SHALL,  UPON
 REQUEST,  BE ISSUED A LICENSE PLATE BEARING THE WORDS "FIRE POLICE".  IF
 A DISTINCTIVE PLATE IS ISSUED TO A PERSON PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, SUCH
 A DISTINCTIVE PLATE SHALL NOT BE ISSUED TO THE SPOUSE  OF  SUCH  PERSON.
 APPLICATION  FOR SAID LICENSE PLATE SHALL BE FILED WITH THE COMMISSIONER
 IN SUCH FORM AND DETAIL AS THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PRESCRIBE.
  2. THE DISTINCTIVE PLATE AUTHORIZED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL BE ISSUED UPON PROOF, SATISFACTORY TO THE COMMISSIONER,  THAT  THE
 APPLICANT OR THE SPOUSE OF THE APPLICANT IS A MEMBER OF THE FIRE POLICE.
  3. A DISTINCTIVE PLATE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION SHALL BE ISSUED
 IN  THE  SAME  MANNER AS OTHER NUMBER PLATES UPON PAYMENT OF THE REGULAR
 REGISTRATION FEE PRESCRIBED BY SECTION FOUR HUNDRED ONE OF THIS  ARTICLE
 PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  AN  ADDITIONAL ONE TIME SERVICE CHARGE OF TEN
 DOLLARS SHALL BE CHARGED FOR SUCH PLATE.
  4. NOTHING CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE  OF  A  SPECIAL
 NUMBER  PLATE  UNDER  THIS  SECTION UNLESS THE COMMISSIONER IS SATISFIED
 THAT THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL SERVICE CHARGES  COLLECTED  PURSUANT
 TO  SUBDIVISION  THREE OF THIS SECTION WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE
 COSTS OF THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF SUCH SPECIAL PLATES.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first of April next  succeeding
 the date on which it shall have become a law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
