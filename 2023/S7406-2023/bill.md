 Introduced  by  Sens.  PARKER, HOYLMAN-SIGAL, SEPULVEDA, SERRANO -- read
  twice and ordered printed, and when printed to  be  committed  to  the
  Committee on Health
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the public health law, the real property law, the tax
  law, the state finance law, the multiple dwelling  law,  the  multiple
  residence  law,  the  social  services  law  and the insurance law, in
  relation to enacting the "childhood lead poisoning prevention and safe
  housing act"; and to repeal certain provisions of  the  public  health
  law relating thereto
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "childhood
 lead poisoning prevention and safe housing act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings  and purposes.  1. (a) Lead poisoning of
 children persists as one of the most prevalent and preventable  environ-
 mental  diseases in New York.  At least 10,000 children were newly iden-
 tified with levels of lead in their blood at 10 micrograms per deciliter
 (ug/dl) in New York state in 2001. Moreover,  only  about  one-third  of
 children  are receiving the lead screenings that are required by law and
 therefore, the actual number of children affected by  the  ingestion  of
 lead  is  undoubtedly significantly greater than reported. Prevention is
 the only effective way to protect  children  from  irreversible  damage.
 Unless  lead  poisoning  is  prevented,  elevated blood lead levels will
 result in impairment of the ability to think, concentrate, and learn.
  (b) Medical research indicates that  children  can  suffer  permanent,
 irreparable  damage  at  blood levels even lower than 10 ug/dl, and that
 there is no level of lead ingestion which  is  without  adverse  impact.
 Medical  research also indicates that fetal injuries from lead paint can
 occur if women have elevated blood levels during pregnancy.  Because  of
 this,  intervention  measures that wait until children have been exposed
 have limited benefits, and the  pursuit  of  primary  prevention,  which

  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 means  eliminating  lead  hazards  before children are exposed, has been
 recommended by  the  United  States  centers  for  disease  control  and
 prevention  and  promoted  by leading experts in the field as a critical
 course of action to protect the health of young children.
  (c)  The predominant cause of lead poisoning in children is the inges-
 tion of lead particles from deteriorating or  abraded  lead-based  paint
 from older and poorly maintained residences.
  (d) Deteriorating lead-based paint or excessive amounts of lead-conta-
 minated dust in these poorly maintained homes endangers the intellectual
 and  emotional development and physical well being of affected children.
 In addition, unsafe work practices that inadequately control  lead  dust
 in  the  repair  or renovation of older homes can cause substantial lead
 hazards.
  (e) Although New York state banned the sale of lead paint in 1970, (l.
 1970, ch. 338) seventy-four percent of  New  York's  housing  stock  was
 constructed  prior  to 1970. At least ninety percent of lead-based paint
 still remaining in occupied housing exists in units built  before  1960.
 New  York state has both the largest percentage and the largest absolute
 number of older housing units with lead paint in the nation.
  (f) The  dangers  posed  by  lead-based  paint  can  be  substantially
 reduced,  although  not  eliminated, by taking measures to prevent paint
 deterioration and limiting children's exposure to paint chips  and  lead
 dust.
  (g)  The deterioration of lead-based paint in older residences results
 in increased expenses each year for the state of New York in the form of
 special education and other education expenses, medical care  for  lead-
 poisoned  children,  and  expenditures  for  delinquent youth and others
 needing special supervision.
  (h) Older housing units remain an important part of New York's housing
 stock, particularly for those of modest or limited incomes. The  problem
 of  lead-based  paint in housing affects urban, suburban and rural areas
 of the state.
  (i) The existing housing codes and enforcement systems in most  juris-
 dictions do not include primary prevention measures for lead hazards and
 have  proven  ineffective  in  encouraging  widespread  lead-based paint
 hazard abatement, mitigation, and control.
  (j) The financial incentives currently in place have not proven suffi-
 cient to motivate landlords and other property owners to undertake wide-
 spread and effective lead-based paint hazard abatement, mitigation,  and
 control;  moreover  low and moderate income property owners may not have
 access to the  resources  to  eliminate  or  reduce  substantially  lead
 hazards.
  (k)  Insurance companies are reluctant to provide coverage to property
 owners in the absence of evidence that lead hazards have been  appropri-
 ately addressed.
  (l)  Knowledge of lead-based paint hazards, their control, mitigation,
 abatement, and risk avoidance is not sufficiently widespread, especially
 outside urban areas.
  2. The purposes of this act are: (a) to increase the supply of afford-
 able rental housing in the state of New York in which measures have been
 taken to eliminate or substantially reduce the risk  of  childhood  lead
 poisoning;
  (b)  to  ensure  that  New York's response to lead-based paint hazards
 focuses on primary prevention as the essential tool to combat  childhood
 lead  poisoning, and thus to substantially reduce, and eventually elimi-
 S. 7406  3
 
 nate, the incidence of childhood lead poisoning  in  the  state  of  New
 York;
  (c) to establish and make enforcement of lead hazard control standards
 in the state of New York more certain and more effective;
  (d)  to  improve public awareness of lead safety issues and to educate
 both property owners and tenants about practices  that  can  reduce  the
 incidence of lead poisoning;
  (e)  to  provide access to the resources for property owners and land-
 lords who commit to undertake specified lead hazard reduction  measures;
 and
  (f)  to  facilitate  the  availability  and affordability of liability
 insurance protection to those landlords and other owners  who  undertake
 specified lead hazard reduction measures.

 section 1370 is added to read as follows:

 BY THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER THAT A PROPERTY HAS BEEN DETERMINED  TO  HAVE
 ACHIEVED EITHER "LEAD-FREE" PROPERTY STATUS OR "LEAD-CONTAINED" PROPERTY

 POISONING,  OR WHEN AN OCCUPANT SPECIFICALLY REQUESTS THAT AN INSPECTION
 OR INVESTIGATION BE MADE BASED UPON HIS OR HER  REASONABLE  BELIEF  THAT
 SUCH  A  CONDITION  EXISTS, OR WHEN AN OCCUPANT MAKES A COMPLAINT TO THE
 OWNER CONCERNING A CONDITION THAT THE OWNER  KNOWS  OR  SHOULD  KNOW  IS

 NOT FEASIBLE TO POST SUCH REPORTS IN A COMMON AREA, THE OWNER  OR  AGENT
 SHALL  DELIVER  INDIVIDUAL COPIES OF SUCH SUMMARY TO EACH AFFECTED UNIT.
 SAID SUMMARY SHALL INDICATE THAT THE FULL REPORT OF  SUCH  INVESTIGATION
 OR INSPECTION IS AVAILABLE TO TENANTS UPON REQUEST.

 S. 7406  19
 
 PAINT HAZARDS IN ORDER THAT INSPECTIONS MAY  BE  CONDUCTED  WITHOUT  THE
 RECEIPT OF A COMPLAINT OR OTHER SUCH EVENT TRIGGERING AN INSPECTION, AND
 REQUIRE  FOR EACH SUCH AREA OF HIGH RISK THAT THE COUNTY COMMISSIONER OF
 HEALTH  OR  HIS  OR  HER  OTHER LOCAL DESIGNEE, AND SUCH LOCAL MUNICIPAL
 BUILDING OR  PROPERTY  MAINTENANCE  CODE  ENFORCEMENT  OFFICIALS  HAVING
