Assembly Resolution No. 444
 
BY: M. of A. Bronson
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  90th  Anniversary  of the Nazi
  book burning campaign on May 10, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, The people of the State of New York must never  forget  the
terrible crimes committed against humanity during the Nazi book burnings
of 1933; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to commemorate the
90th Anniversary of the Nazi book burning campaign on May 10, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Central  Library  of  Rochester  and Monroe County is
committed to documenting, archiving and preserving the  history  of  the
LGBTQ+  community through the Shoulders to Stand On History and Archives
Project  and  is  marking  this  anniversary  by  preserving  historical
archives involving the silencing of LGBTQ+ speech; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Nazi  book  burnings were a campaign conducted by the
German Student Union to ceremonially burn  books  in  Nazi  Germany  and
Austria  in  the 1930s; the books targeted for burning were those viewed
as being subversive or as representing  ideologies  opposed  to  Nazism,
including  those  written  by Jewish, half-Jewish, communist, socialist,
anarchist, liberal, pacifist, and sexologist authors, among others; and
 
  WHEREAS, The initial books burned were those of Karl Marx  and  Karl
Kautsky,  but  came  to include many authors, including Albert Einstein,
Helen Keller, writers in French and English, and  effectively  any  book
incompatible  with  Nazi  ideology;  in a campaign of cultural genocide,
books were also burned in masse by the Nazis  in  occupied  territories,
such as in Poland; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On April 8, 1933, the Main Office for Press and Propaganda
of the German Student Union proclaimed a nationwide "Action against  the
Un-German  Spirit," which was to climax in a literary purge or cleansing
by fire; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first large burning came  on  May  6,  1933,  when  the
German  Student  Union  made  an organized attack on Magnus Hirschfeld's
"Institut fur Sexualwissenschaft"; its library and  archives  of  around
20,000  books  and  journals  were publicly hauled out and burned in the
street;  the  collection  included  unique  works  on  intersexuality,
homosexuality,  and  transgender  topics;  it  is also assumed that Dora
Richter, the  first  transgender  woman  known  to  have  undergone  sex
reassignment  surgery by doctors at the institute, was killed during the
attack; and
 
  WHEREAS, On May 10, 1933, the  students  burned  upwards  of  25,000
volumes  of  "un-German" books in the square at the State Opera, Berlin,
thereby presaging an era of uncompromising  state  censorship;  in  many
other  university  towns,  nationalist  students  marched  in  torch lit
parades against the "un-German" spirit; and
 
  WHEREAS, The scripted rituals of this night  called  for  high  Nazi
officials,  professors,  rectors,  and  student  leaders  to address the
 
participants and spectators; at the meeting places, students  threw  the
pillaged,  banned  books into the bonfires with a ceremony that included
live music, singing, "fire oaths," and incantations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  people of New York must educate future generations to
promote understanding of the dangers of intolerance  or  suppression  of
free speech in order to prevent similar injustices from happening again;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 90th Anniversary of the Nazi book burnings  on  May  10,
2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Shoulders to  Stand  On  history  and  Archives  Project,
Central Library of Rochester and Monroe.
