  Section 1. The commissioner of the department of labor,  in  consulta-
 tion  with  the  commissioners of the office of temporary and disability

 Such study shall include an analysis of any effect on the eligibility of
 working individuals for all programs with an income eligibility require-
 ment  and/or  the  potential  reduction in benefits under such programs,
