 retained  by a treasurer for a period of five years from the date of the
 filing of the final statement with  respect  to  the  election,  primary
 election  or  convention  to  which  they pertain. No officer, member or
 agent  of any political committee shall receive any receipt, transfer or
 contribution, or make any expenditure or incur any liability  until  the
 committee  shall  have chosen a treasurer and depository and filed their
 names in accordance with this subdivision. There shall be filed  in  the
 office  in  which the committee is required to file its statements under
 section 14-110 of this article, within five days after the choice  of  a
 treasurer and depository, a statement giving the name and address of the
 treasurer  chosen, the name and address of any person authorized to sign
 checks by such treasurer, the name and address of the depository  chosen
 and  the  candidate  or  candidates  or ballot proposal or proposals the
 success or defeat of which  the  committee  is  to  aid  or  take  part;
 provided,  however,  that  such  statement  shall  not  be required of a
 constituted committee and  provided  further  that  a  political  action
 committee  which  makes  no  expenditures,  to  aid  or take part in the
 election or defeat of a candidate, other than in the  form  of  contrib-
 utions,  shall not be required to list the candidates being supported or
 opposed by such committee and shall also disclose the name and  employer
 for  any  individual  who  exerts operational control over the political
 action committee as well as  any  salaried  employee  of  the  political
 action  committee.  SUCH  A  STATEMENT FROM ANY COMMITTEE OTHER THAN A
 PARTY OR AUTHORIZED COMMITTEE ALSO SHALL CLEARLY IDENTIFY  THE  ECONOMIC
 OR  OTHER  SPECIAL  INTEREST,  IF  IDENTIFIABLE,  OF  A  MAJORITY OF ITS
 CONTRIBUTORS, AND IF A MAJORITY  OF  ITS  CONTRIBUTORS  SHARE  A  COMMON
 EMPLOYER,  SHALL IDENTIFY THE EMPLOYER. IF THE ECONOMIC OR OTHER SPECIAL
 INTEREST OR COMMON EMPLOYER ARE NOT IDENTIFIABLE, SUCH  STATEMENT  OF  A
 MULTI-CANDIDATE  COMMITTEE  SHALL CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE ECONOMIC OR OTHER
 SPECIAL INTEREST, IF IDENTIFIABLE, OF A MAJORITY OF ITS ORGANIZERS,  AND
 IF  A MAJORITY OF ITS ORGANIZERS SHARE A COMMON EMPLOYER, SHALL IDENTIFY
 THE EMPLOYER, AND IF ORGANIZED, CONTROLLED OR MAINTAINED BY AN  INDIVID-
 UAL,  SHALL  IDENTIFY THAT INDIVIDUAL. Such statement shall be signed by
 the treasurer and all other  persons  authorized  to  sign  checks.  Any
 change  in  the information required in any statement shall be reported,
 in an amended statement filed in the same manner and in the same  office
 as an original statement filed under this section, within two days after
 it  occurs,  except  that  any change to the mailing address on any such
 statement filed at the state board may also be made in any manner deemed
 acceptable by the state board. Only a banking organization authorized to
 do business in this state may be designated a depository hereunder.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
