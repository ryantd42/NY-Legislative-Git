  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the
  Carpenter House on May 13, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  to  support  the
preservation and commemoration of historical landmarks which express and
preserve  the  social  and  cultural  origins of this great State of New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate 100th Anniversary of the Carpenter House, to  be  celebrated
at  the Grace's Tea event on Saturday, May 13, 2023, at the Rome Art and
Community Center; and
 
  WHEREAS, Built in 1923, the Carpenter House was the home  of  Arthur
F.  and  Grace  Carpenter,  prominent  citizens  and  one  of  the  most
successful industrialists of Rome, New York; today, visitors  from  both
far  and  near  marvel  at  the  English Tudor styled home's beauty, its
attention to detail, and its extensive grounds full of  expansive  lawns
and home to exquisitely designed gardens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  main  building  achieves its singularity through many
carefully  designed  architectural  innovations;  the  carefully  placed
chimneys  were  purposefully made crooked, and every single brick in its
exterior was a "reject", and their imperfection, when  massed,  provides
the building with its color and texture; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  leaded  diamond-paned windows are in style of English
manor  houses  of  the  Elizabethan  Era,  and  the  relief  fireplaces,
ceilings,  and  carvings  over the oak stairs are richly ornamented with
symbols that represent English crests and coats of  arms,  such  as  the
greyhound,  which can be spotted secretly throughout the home in special
details; and
 
  WHEREAS, After the construction of the house was  completed,  Arthur
F.  and  Grace  Carpenter  hired  the world-famous art collector, Joseph
Duveen, to appropriately furnish its interior which  included  priceless
court cupboards, 17th Century chairs, wall hangings, floor coverings and
other antique furnishings and art treasures from New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Surrounding  the  Carpenter home were well-planned gardens
and lawns where Grace Carpenter loved to throw  parties  for  the  local
children;  she  was  also  a  talented artist and wrote two small books,
Friends of the Road and The Besieging Spirit; and
 
  WHEREAS, After the deaths of Arthur F. and Grace Carpenter, the City
of Rome bought the property at a reasonable sum, which was requested  by
Grace,  in  1966,  for the purpose of housing the Rome Art and Community
Center (RACC); and
 
  WHEREAS, RACC is Rome's  only  multi-arts  facility,  offering  both
cultural  and  community programming at little or no cost to the public;
 
this exceptional art center welcomes  almost  5,000  visitors  annually,
including visitors from all over the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Highly  committed to making programming accessible to all,
regardless of age, race,  economic  status  or  physical  ability,  this
center continues to be a true asset to its community and in addition, is
also  a  home  away from home for hundreds of artists each year, whether
they exhibit their engaging works  in  the  galleries  or  are  featured
performers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition  of the Carpenter House's rich history and
enduring contribution to the heritage of the State of New  York,  it  is
the  intent  of  this Legislative Body to join in the celebration of its
100th Anniversary so that present and future  generations  may  come  to
appreciate  the  unique  significance  which  its  history  plays in the
progression of our State and Nation's evolution; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate  the  100th  Anniversary  of  the Carpenter House on May 13,
2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to Jason Tockey, Executive Director, Rome Art and Community
Center.
