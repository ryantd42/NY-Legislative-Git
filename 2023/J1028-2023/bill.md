BY: Senator BAILEY
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  August 11, 2023, as Hip-Hop Celebration Day  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to  those  who
seek  to  preserve  and  celebrate the musical heritage of our State and
Nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  11,  2023,  as  Hip-Hop
Celebration Day in the State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Hip Hop Celebration Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  honor  of  the anniversary of the birth of Hip-Hop, on
Thursday, July 29, 2021, the United States  passed  a  resolution  which
designates  a  "Hip Hop Celebration Day," a "Hip-Hop Recognition Month,"
and a "Hip Hop History Month"; and
 
  WHEREAS, August 11th was chosen as the birth of Hip-Hop  due  to  DJ
Kool  Herc's  now-legendary  spinning at the "Back To School Jam" in the
Bronx in 1973; and
 
  WHEREAS, On August 11, 1973, at a Back To School  Jam  organized  by
his  sister  Cindy  Campbell  and  held  at  the recreation room of 1520
Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx, New York,  Clive  DJ  Kool  Herc  Campbell
introduced his innovative style of disk jockeying and, together with the
master of ceremonies engaging the crowd with rap on the microphone while
party- goers known as B-boys and B-girls danced, introduced a new style,
later  known  as  Hip-Hop,  which combined the elements of a disk jockey
(commonly known as a DJ), a master of ceremonies (commonly known  as  an
MC), music, art, fashion, and dance; and
 
  WHEREAS,  From  its  humble  beginnings in New York City, the music,
lyricism, dance, fashion, and art of Hip Hop has become a  culture,  now
found  in  communities  across  the  United  States, and has long been a
worldwide phenomenon; and
 
  WHEREAS, The art and culture of  Hip-Hop  is  an  original  American
creation;  the  Hip-Hop  genre  has been reinvented often over the years
since 1973, reflecting the State, city, and region of  the  music,  from
G-funk  and  Hyphy  on  the West Coast to Bass and Trap in the South, to
Drill in the Midwest, to many other sounds from coast to coast and  from
abroad, including the New School, which continues that trend; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hip-Hop  artists  and  supporters,  originally  of African
heritage, now transcend many  different  ages,  ethnicities,  religions,
locations,  political  affiliations,  and  socioeconomic statuses, which
demonstrates the melting-pot quality of Hip-Hop art and culture; and
 
  WHEREAS, Events which provide a means of preserving a  part  of  our
rich  American  past and which contribute to the community in such noble
 
endeavors as aforementioned, are held in  the  highest  regard  by  this
Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  11,  2023,  as
Hip-Hop Celebration Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
