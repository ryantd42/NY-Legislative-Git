 every elementary school under state control or supported wholly or part-
 ly  by public money of the state, in the humane treatment and protection
 of animals and the importance of the part they play in  the  economy  of
 nature  as  well  as  the  necessity of controlling the proliferation of
 animals which are subsequently abandoned and caused  to  suffer  extreme
 cruelty.  Such  instruction shall be for such period of time during each

 work in literature, reading, language, nature study or  ethnology.  Such
 weekly instruction may be divided into two or more periods.
  B.  THE  OFFICER,  BOARD,  OR  COMMISSION  AUTHORIZED  OR  REQUIRED TO

 ANIMALS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PART  THEY  PLAY  IN  THE  ECONOMY  OF
 NATURE  AS  WELL  AS  THE  NECESSITY OF CONTROLLING THE PROLIFERATION OF
 ANIMALS WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ABANDONED AND CAUSED  TO  SUFFER  EXTREME
 CRUELTY.  SUCH INSTRUCTION SHALL INCLUDE EDUCATING STUDENTS ON THE PRIN-
 CIPLES OF KINDNESS TO AND RESPECT FOR ANIMALS AND OBSERVANCE OF LAWS AND
 RULES  PERTAINING  TO  THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. THE COMMISSIONER
