 promote the sound growth and development of our  municipalities  through
 the  correction of such substandard, insanitary[,] OR blighted[, deteri-

 accessible thereto the undertaking of  public  and  private  improvement
 programs related thereto, including the provision of educational, recre-
 ational  and cultural facilities, and the encouragement of participation

  § 8. Paragraph (d) of subdivision 6 of section 16-n of  section  1  of
 chapter  174  of the laws of 1968, constituting the New York state urban
 development corporation act, as amended by section  3  of  part  HHH  of
 chapter 58 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  (d)  A  municipality  that  is  granted  an award or awards under this
 section shall provide a  matching  contribution  of  no  less  than  ten
 percent of the aggregated award or awards amount. Such matching contrib-
 ution  may  be  in  the form of a financial and/or in kind contribution.

 under this section shall make best efforts to ensure that minority-owned
 and  women-owned  business  enterprises  certified  pursuant  to article

  § 9. Section 501 of the general municipal law, as added by chapter 402
 of the laws of 1961, is amended to read as follows:
  §  501.  Policy  and  purposes of article. There exist in many munici-
 palities within this  state  residential,  non-residential,  commercial,
 industrial  or  vacant  areas, and combinations thereof, which are [slum
 or] blighted, or which are becoming [slum or] blighted areas because  of
 substandard[,]  OR  insanitary[,  deteriorated  or deteriorating] condi-
 tions, factors, and characteristics, with or without  tangible  physical
 blight.  The  existence  of such areas constitutes a serious and growing
 menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals  and  welfare,
 contributes  increasingly  to  the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency
 and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of
 public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a  negative
 influence  on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and
 stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues.
  In order to protect and promote the safety, health, morals and welfare
 of the people of the state and to promote the sound growth and  develop-
 ment of our municipalities, it is necessary to correct such substandard,
 insanitary,  OR  blighted[,  deteriorated  or deteriorating] conditions,
 factors  and  characteristics  by  the  clearance,  replanning,  recon-
 struction, redevelopment, rehabilitation, restoration or conservation of
 such  areas,  the undertaking of public and private improvement programs
 related thereto and the encouragement of participation in these programs
 by private enterprise.
  It is necessary for the accomplishment of such purposes to grant muni-
 cipalities of this state the rights and powers provided in this article.
 The use of such rights and powers to correct  such  conditions,  factors
 S. 2384  6
 
 and  characteristics  and  to  eliminate  or prevent the development and
 spread of [deterioration and] blight through the clearance,  replanning,
 reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  conservation or renewal of such areas,
 for  residential,  commercial,  industrial,  community, public and other
 uses is a public use and public purpose essential to the  public  inter-
 est, and for which public funds may be expended.
  §  10.  Subdivision  4 of section 502 of the general municipal law, as
 amended by chapter 748 of the laws  of  1967,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  4.  "Substandard or insanitary area." The term "substandard or insani-
 tary area" shall mean and be interchangeable with a  [slum,]  blighted[,
 deteriorated  or  deteriorating]  area, or an area which has a blighting
 influence on the surrounding area, whether residential, non-residential,
 commercial, industrial, vacant, or land in highways, railway and  subway
 tracks,  bridge  and  tunnel  approaches and entrances, or other similar
 facilities, over which air rights and easements or other rights of  user
 necessary  for  the use and development of such air rights, to be devel-
 oped as air rights sites for the elimination of the blighting influence,
 or any combination thereof and may include land, buildings  or  improve-
 ments,  or  air rights and concomitant easements or other rights of user
 necessary for the use and development of such air rights, not  in  them-
 selves  substandard  or  insanitary,  the  inclusion  of which is deemed
 necessary for the effective undertaking of one  or  more  urban  renewal
 programs.
  §  11.  Paragraph  (a)  of subdivision 5 of section 510 of the general
 municipal law, as amended by chapter 829 of the laws of 1968, is amended

 carrying out one or more local urban renewal programs, make or  contract
 to  make  state  capital grants to municipalities to assist in financing
 the cost of the preparation and completion  of  one  or  more  community
 renewal programs.
  A  community renewal program may include, without being limited to (1)
 the identification of [slum areas or] blighted[, deteriorated, or  dete-
 riorating] areas in the community, (2) the measurement of the nature and
 degree  of  blight and blighting factors within such areas, (3) determi-
 nation of the financial, relocation,  and  other  resources  needed  and
 available  to  renew  such  areas,  (4)  the identification of potential
 project areas and, where feasible, types of urban renewal action contem-
 plated within such areas, and (5) scheduling  or  programming  of  urban
 renewal activities.
  §  12.  Section  520 of the general municipal law, as added by chapter
 402 of the laws of 1961, is amended to read as follows:
  § 520. Construction. This article  shall  be  construed  liberally  to
 effect  the  purposes  hereof  and the enumeration of specific powers in
 this act shall not operate to restrict the meaning of any general  grant
 of  power  contained  in this chapter or to exclude other powers compre-
 hended in such general grant. In construing this  chapter  consideration
 shall  be given to its purposes and intent, among others, of consolidat-
 ing, clarifying and simplifying the respective provisions of  the  chap-
 ters  repealed  as hereinafter specified in section five hundred twenty-
 five hereof and of authorizing municipalities to undertake one  or  more
 programs  of  urban  renewal  with respect to the clearance, replanning,
 reconstruction, rehabilitation, redevelopment, conservation, restoration

 other  physical  conditions which tend to impede the development of such
 areas, for residential, commercial, industrial,  community,  public  and
 other uses and to apply for and accept federal or state loans, subsidies
 or  grants  in  connection  therewith. Insofar as the provisions of this
 article are inconsistent with  the  provisions  of  any  other  general,
 special  or  local law, the provisions of this article shall be control-
 ling.
  § 13. The third undesignated paragraph of section 2 of  section  1  of
 chapter  173  of the laws of 1968, constituting the New York state urban
 development and research corporation act, is amended to read as follows:
  The legislature hereby declares it to be the policy of this  state  to

 to  increase job opportunities and protect against involuntary unemploy-
 ment and underemployment by promoting, attracting, stimulating and revi-
 talizing business, commerce, industry and  manufacturing  in  the  urban

 blight and promote the economic and physical development of  such  areas
 through the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation and improvement
 of  residential,  commercial  and  industrial  structures and facilities
 therein.
  § 14. This act shall take effect immediately.
