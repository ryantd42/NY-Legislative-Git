 For  purposes  of  this  paragraph, the term "member" shall include each
 person who during the qualifying period  was  in  the  employment  of  a
 public  employer  which then participated for such employees in a public
 retirement system in this state, irrespective of whether the person  was
 a  participant in such system at that time, provided that the person has
 become a participant in such retirement system and has purchased service
 credit for a period of time that includes some or all of the  qualifying
 period  in accordance with provisions of law applicable to such purchase
 of service credit.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  be  deemed  to
 have been in full force and effect on and after September 11, 2001.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would expand the definition of a member who participated in
 World Trade Center rescue, recovery or  cleanup  operations  to  include
 those who worked at the Verrazano Bridge Toll Facility.
  Insofar  as  this bill affects the New York State and Local Employees'
 Retirement System (NYSLERS) and the New York State and Local Police  and
 Fire  Retirement  System  (NYSLPFRS), if this bill is enacted during the
 2023 legislative session, it would reclassify certain current and future
 retirement benefits. The cost of the revised benefit  will  depend  upon
 the  applicant's  age, service, salary, plan, and benefit type otherwise
 payable.
 
 Benefit prior  None  Ordinary  In Performance of  Service
 to enactment:  Disability  Duty Disability
 Cost for  10 times  5.5 times  3 times  2 times
 WTC benefit:  salary  salary  salary  salary
 
  This bill would also lead to more deaths being  classified  as  "acci-
 dental".  For  each death classified as accidental due to this bill, the
 cost would depend on the age, service, salary, plan, and status at  time
 of death. It is estimated that the cost for each NYSLERS member affected
 would  average  approximately  4.5 times final average salary. The esti-
 mated cost for each NYSLPFRS member would average approximately 13 times
 final average salary.
  NYSLERS Costs: Pursuant to Section 25 of  the  Retirement  and  Social
 Security  Law,  these  costs would be borne entirely by the State of New
 York and would require an itemized appropriation sufficient to  pay  the
 cost of the provision.
  NYSLPFRS  Costs:  These costs would be shared by the State of New York
 and the participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.

 could be affected by this legislation cannot be readily determined.
