  HONORING the Beta Lambda Chapter upon the occasion
  of  its  75th  Anniversary  of  dedicated service to
  Brooklyn College and the surrounding community
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  tribute to those fraternal organizations of high purpose and worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
the  Beta  Lambda  Chapter  upon the occasion of its 75th Anniversary of
dedicated service to Brooklyn College and the surrounding community,  to
be celebrated on Saturday, April 29, 2023, in Brooklyn, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The KBS Foundation Limited serves as the philanthropic arm
of the Kappa Beta Sigma Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.;  the
mission  is  to  engage  young  men of color, particularly Black men, in
conversations and activities critical to their  understanding  of  self,
their  role  in  building their communities, leadership development, and
economic self-sufficiency; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 2007, years before My Brother's Keeper, several brothers
from the Kappa Beta Sigma Chapter asked themselves and the  brothers  in
the  chapter,  if  there  was  more they could do to impact the lives of
young men and boys of color;  with  the  answer  being  "yes,"  the  KBS
Foundation  Limited  was  formed  at  the  City  University  of New York
Brooklyn College on February 14, 1948; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, KBS Foundation Limited continues to impact the lives
of young men of color  through  scholarships,  educational  programming,
community involvement and strategic partnerships; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to honor and commend
the members of the Beta Lambda Chapter of the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity,
Inc.,  past  and  present, who have labored so conscientiously to secure
and improve the quality of  life  for  the  community  it  serves;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor the Beta Lambda Chapter upon the occasion of its 75th  Anniversary
of  dedicated service to Brooklyn College and the surrounding community;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Beta Lambda Chapter and KBS Foundation Limited.
