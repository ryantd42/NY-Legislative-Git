 HAVE BEEN STOLEN OR APPROPRIATED, OBTAINED, OR CONVERTED WITHOUT AUTHOR-
 IZATION;  OR  (4) DISCLOSURE OR USE OF A TRADE SECRET OF ANOTHER WITHOUT
 EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONSENT BY A PERSON WHO:
  (I) USED IMPROPER MEANS TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRADE SECRET; OR
  (II) AT THE TIME OF DISCLOSURE OR USE, KNEW OR HAD REASON TO KNOW THAT
 HIS OR HER KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRADE SECRET WAS:
  (A) DERIVED FROM OR THROUGH A PERSON WHO HAD UTILIZED  IMPROPER  MEANS
 TO ACQUIRE IT;
  (B) ACQUIRED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO A DUTY TO MAINTAIN ITS
 SECRECY OR LIMIT ITS USE; OR
  (C)  DERIVED  FROM  OR  THROUGH A PERSON WHO OWED A DUTY TO THE PERSON
 SEEKING RELIEF TO MAINTAIN ITS SECRECY OR LIMIT ITS USE; OR
  (III) BEFORE A MATERIAL CHANGE OF HIS OR HER  POSITION,  KNEW  OR  HAD
 REASON  TO  KNOW THAT IT WAS A TRADE SECRET AND THAT KNOWLEDGE OF IT HAD
 BEEN ACQUIRED BY ACCIDENT OR MISTAKE;
  (C) "PERSON" MEANS A NATURAL PERSON,  CORPORATION,  LIMITED  LIABILITY
 COMPANY,  BUSINESS TRUST, ESTATE, TRUST, PARTNERSHIP, ASSOCIATION, JOINT
 VENTURE, GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENTAL SUBDIVISION OR AGENCY,  OR  ANY  OTHER
 LEGAL OR COMMERCIAL ENTITY; AND
  (D)  "TRADE  SECRET"  MEANS  ANY FORM AND TYPE OF FINANCIAL, BUSINESS,
 SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL, ECONOMIC, OR ENGINEERING INFORMATION, INCLUDING A
 PATTERN, PLAN, COMPILATION, PROGRAM DEVICE, FORMULA, DESIGN,  PROTOTYPE,
 METHOD,  TECHNIQUE, PROCESS, PROCEDURE, PROGRAM, OR CODE, WHETHER TANGI-
 BLE OR INTANGIBLE, AND WHETHER OR HOW STORED, COMPILED, OR  MEMORIALIZED
 PHYSICALLY, ELECTRONICALLY, GRAPHICALLY, PHOTOGRAPHICALLY OR IN WRITING,
 THAT:
  (1)  DERIVES INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC VALUE, ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL, FROM NOT
 BEING GENERALLY KNOWN TO, AND NOT BEING READILY ASCERTAINABLE BY  PROPER
 MEANS  BY,  OTHER PERSONS WHO CAN OBTAIN ECONOMIC VALUE FROM ITS DISCLO-
 SURE OR USE; AND
  (2) IS THE SUBJECT OF EFFORTS THAT ARE REASONABLE  UNDER  THE  CIRCUM-
 STANCES TO MAINTAIN ITS SECRECY.
  §  279-O. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. (A) ACTUAL OR THREATENED MISAPPROPRIATION
 MAY BE TEMPORARILY, PRELIMINARILY, OR PERMANENTLY ENJOINED. UPON  APPLI-
 CATION  TO  THE  COURT,  AN  INJUNCTION  SHALL BE VACATED WHEN THE TRADE
 SECRET HAS CEASED TO EXIST, BUT THE INJUNCTION MAY BE CONTINUED  FOR  AN
 ADDITIONAL  REASONABLE  PERIOD  OF TIME IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE COMMERCIAL
 ADVANTAGE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE DERIVED FROM THE MISAPPROPRIATION.
  (B) IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AN INJUNCTION MAY  CONDITION  FUTURE
 USE  UPON  PAYMENT OF A REASONABLE ROYALTY FOR NO LONGER THAN THE PERIOD
 OF TIME FOR WHICH USE COULD HAVE BEEN  PROHIBITED.  EXCEPTIONAL  CIRCUM-
 STANCES  INCLUDE,  BUT  ARE  NOT  LIMITED TO, A MATERIAL AND PREJUDICIAL
 CHANGE OF POSITION PRIOR TO ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE OR  REASON  TO  KNOW  OF
 MISAPPROPRIATION THAT RENDERS A PROHIBITIVE INJUNCTION INEQUITABLE.
  (C) IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COURT MAY ORDER AFFIRMATIVE ACTS
 TO PROTECT A TRADE SECRET.
  §  279-P. DAMAGES. (A) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT A MATERIAL AND PREJU-
 DICIAL CHANGE OF POSITION PRIOR TO ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE OR REASON TO KNOW
 OF MISAPPROPRIATION RENDERS A MONETARY RECOVERY INEQUITABLE, A COMPLAIN-
 ANT IS ENTITLED TO RECOVER DAMAGES  FOR  MISAPPROPRIATION.  DAMAGES  CAN
 INCLUDE  BOTH  THE ACTUAL LOSS CAUSED BY MISAPPROPRIATION AND THE UNJUST
 ENRICHMENT CAUSED BY MISAPPROPRIATION THAT IS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT  IN
 COMPUTING ACTUAL LOSS. IN LIEU OF DAMAGES MEASURED BY ANY OTHER METHODS,
 A. 2701  3
 
 THE  DAMAGES CAUSED BY MISAPPROPRIATION MAY BE MEASURED BY IMPOSITION OF
 LIABILITY FOR A REASONABLE ROYALTY FOR A MISAPPROPRIATOR'S  UNAUTHORIZED
 DISCLOSURE OR USE OF A TRADE SECRET.
  (B)  IF  WILLFUL  OR  MALICIOUS MISAPPROPRIATION EXISTS, THE COURT MAY
 AWARD EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT NOT EXCEEDING TWICE ANY AWARD  MADE
 UNDER SUBDIVISION (A) OF THIS SECTION.
  §  279-Q.  ATTORNEY'S FEES. IF (A) A CLAIM OF MISAPPROPRIATION IS MADE
 OR CONTINUED IN BAD FAITH, (B) A MOTION TO TERMINATE  AN  INJUNCTION  IS
 MADE  OR  RESISTED  OR CONTINUED IN BAD FAITH, OR (C) A WILLFUL OR MALI-
 CIOUS MISAPPROPRIATION EXISTS, THE COURT MAY AWARD REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S
 FEES TO THE PREVAILING PARTY. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, A  CLAIM  OF
 MISAPPROPRIATION IS MADE OR CONTINUED IN BAD FAITH OR A MOTION TO TERMI-
 NATE  AN  INJUNCTION IS MADE OR RESISTED OR CONTINUED IN BAD FAITH IF IT
 IS UNDERTAKEN OR CONTINUED SOLELY TO HARASS OR MALICIOUSLY INJURE ANOTH-
 ER OR TO DELAY OR PROLONG THE RESOLUTION OF THE  LITIGATION;  OR  IT  IS
 UNDERTAKEN  OR CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY REASONABLE BASIS IN FACT OR LAW AND
 COULD NOT BE SUPPORTED BY  A  GOOD  FAITH  ARGUMENT  FOR  AN  EXTENSION,
 MODIFICATION OR REVERSAL OF EXISTING LAW.
  §  279-R.  PRESERVATION OF SECRECY. IN AN ACTION UNDER THIS ARTICLE, A
 COURT SHALL PRESERVE THE SECRECY OF AN ALLEGED TRADE SECRET  BY  REASON-
 ABLE  MEANS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GRANTING PROTECTIVE ORDERS IN
 CONNECTION WITH DISCOVERY DEVICES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF  SECTION
 THIRTY-ONE  HUNDRED  THREE  OF THE CIVIL PRACTICE LAW AND RULES, HOLDING
 IN-CAMERA HEARINGS, SEALING THE RECORDS OF THE ACTION, AND ORDERING  ANY
 PERSON  INVOLVED  IN  THE  LITIGATION  NOT  TO DISCLOSE AN ALLEGED TRADE
 SECRET WITHOUT PRIOR COURT APPROVAL.
  § 279-S. STATUTE  OF  LIMITATIONS.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  INCONSISTENT
 PROVISION  OF LAW, AN ACTION FOR MISAPPROPRIATION MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN
 THREE YEARS AFTER THE MISAPPROPRIATION IS DISCOVERED OR BY THE  EXERCISE
 OF REASONABLE DILIGENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED. FOR THE PURPOSES OF
 THIS SECTION, A CONTINUING MISAPPROPRIATION CONSTITUTES A SINGLE CLAIM.
  §  279-T.  EFFECT  ON OTHER LAW. (A) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION
 (B) OF THIS SECTION, THIS ARTICLE DISPLACES CONFLICTING  TORT,  RESTITU-
 TIONARY, AND OTHER LAW OF THIS STATE PROVIDING CIVIL REMEDIES FOR MISAP-
 PROPRIATION OF A TRADE SECRET.
  (B) THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT AFFECT:
  (1)  CONTRACTUAL  REMEDIES, WHETHER OR NOT BASED UPON MISAPPROPRIATION
 OF A TRADE SECRET;
  (2) OTHER CIVIL REMEDIES THAT ARE NOT BASED UPON MISAPPROPRIATION OF A
 TRADE SECRET; OR
  (3) CRIMINAL REMEDIES, WHETHER OR NOT BASED UPON MISAPPROPRIATION OF A
 TRADE SECRET.
  § 279-U. UNIFORMITY OF  APPLICATION  AND  CONSTRUCTION.  THIS  ARTICLE
 SHALL BE APPLIED AND CONSTRUED TO EFFECTUATE ITS GENERAL PURPOSE TO MAKE
 UNIFORM THE LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT OF THIS ARTICLE AMONG STATES
 ENACTING IT.
  §  279-V. SEVERABILITY. IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS ARTICLE OR ITS APPLI-
 CATION TO ANY PERSON OR CIRCUMSTANCES IS HELD  INVALID,  THE  INVALIDITY
 DOES  NOT  AFFECT OTHER PROVISIONS OR APPLICATIONS OF THIS ARTICLE WHICH
 CAN BE GIVEN EFFECT WITHOUT THE INVALID PROVISION OR APPLICATION, AND TO
 THIS END THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ARTICLE ARE SEVERABLE.
  § 2. Section 8303-a of the civil practice law and rules is amended  by
 adding a new subdivision (d) to read as follows:
  (D) THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO ACTIONS GOVERNED
 BY ARTICLE SEVENTEEN-B OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS LAW.
 A. 2701  4
 
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall  have become a law, except that the provisions of article 17-B
 of the general business law, as added by section one of this act,  shall
 not  apply to a misappropriation occurring prior to such effective date.
 With  respect  to a continuing misappropriation that began prior to such
 effective date, this act shall not apply to the continuing  misappropri-
 ation that occurs after such effective date.
