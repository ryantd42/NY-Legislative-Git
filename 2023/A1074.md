  (a) Where a real property assessment challenge  commenced  under  this
 article  has  been  pending  for at least two years from the date of the

 other party's failure to prosecute the proceeding and file the appraisal

 failing to file the appraisal, the court may in  its  discretion  either
 dismiss  or  grant  the petition and such order shall constitute a final

 demand  made  under paragraph (a) of this subdivision OR BY ORDER OF THE

 tioner fail to file a note of issue within thirty days of the service of
 demand, the proceeding shall be deemed to have been abandoned, an  order
 dismissing  the  petition shall be entered without notice and such order
 shall constitute a final  adjudication  of  all  issues  raised  in  the
 proceeding,  unless  the  court  or judge otherwise orders on good cause
 shown.
  [(d)] (F) Should the respondent fail to  demand  that  the  petitioner
 file a note of issue pursuant to paragraph [(c)] (E) of this subdivision
 within  four  years from the date of the commencement of the proceeding,
 and a note of issue has not otherwise been filed, the  proceeding  shall
 be  deemed  to  have been abandoned and an order dismissing the petition
 shall be entered without notice and such order shall constitute a  final
 adjudication  of  all  issues raised in the proceeding, except where the
 parties otherwise stipulate or a court or judge otherwise orders on good
 cause shown within such four-year period.
