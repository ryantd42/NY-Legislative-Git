  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1. Section 54-m of the state finance law, as added by section
 104 of part WWW of chapter 59 of the laws of 2017, is amended to read as

 juvenile jurisdiction above fifteen years of  age.  Notwithstanding  any
 other  provision  of  law  to the contrary, counties and the city of New
 York shall not be required to  contribute  a  local  share  of  eligible
 expenditures  that would not have been incurred absent the provisions of
 [a] chapter FIFTY-NINE of the laws of two thousand seventeen that  added
 this  section [unless the most recent budget adopted by a county that is
 subject to the provisions of section three-c of  the  general  municipal
 law  exceeded the tax levy limit prescribed in such section or the local
 government is not subject to the provisions of section  three-c  of  the
 general municipal law; provided, however, that the state budget director
 shall  be authorized to waive any local share of expenditures associated
 with a chapter of the laws of two thousand seventeen that increased  the
 age  of juvenile jurisdiction above fifteen years of age, upon a showing
 of financial hardship by a county or the city of New York upon  applica-
 tion in the form and manner prescribed by the division of the budget. In
 evaluating  an  application  for a financial hardship waiver, the budget
 director shall consider the incremental cost to the locality related  to
 increasing the age of juvenile jurisdiction, changes in state or federal
 aid payments, and other extraordinary costs, including the occurrence of
 a disaster as defined in paragraph a of subdivision two of section twen-

 factors that the director may determine].
