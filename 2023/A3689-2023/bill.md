 § 1501. Declaration of policy.
  The  people  of this state have a vital interest in the establishment,
 maintenance and preservation of [public] burial grounds and  the  proper
 operation of the corporations which own and manage the same.  This arti-
 cle  is  determined  an  exercise  of the police powers of this state to
 protect the well-being of our citizens, to promote  the  public  welfare

 and becoming a burden upon the community,  and  in  furtherance  of  the
 public  policy  of  this  state  that cemeteries shall be conducted on a
 non-profit basis for the mutual benefit of plot owners  therein.  THIS
 VITAL  INTEREST  SHALL BE PROTECTED AND THE UNIQUENESS OF THESE ENTITIES
 SHALL BE AFFIRMED BY PROVIDING THE STATE  WITH  THE  RESPONSIBILITY  FOR
 SOLE  JURISDICTION  OF THE REGULATION OF CEMETERIES AS SET FORTH IN THIS
 ARTICLE.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
