 Introduced  by  M.  of  A.  WEINSTEIN  --  read once and referred to the
  Committee on Consumer Affairs and Protection
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation  to  enacting  the
  "Consumer and Small business Protection Act"
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as  the  "Consumer
 and Small business Protection Act (CSPA)".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings and intent. The Legislature declares that
 the State has a responsibility to  protect  individuals  and  businesses
 within  the  State  from unfair and abusive business acts and practices.
 The Legislature further declares that the  State's  law,  which  guarded
 only  against  deceptive  business acts and practices, has been insuffi-
 cient to meet this responsibility and has become out of  date  as  other
 states'  laws provide far greater protections. Consumers and small busi-
 nesses have long been vulnerable to unscrupulous business practices that
 are unfair and abusive without being expressly deceptive. The State must
 not allow bad actors to peddle predatory products and services  as  long
 as  they  are clever enough not to get caught in a lie. To that end, and
 to better level the playing field for  the  State's  many  honest  busi-
 nesses,  this  legislation defines unfair and abusive acts and practices
 expansively.
  The State must also ensure that this  protection  covers  small  busi-
 nesses, which are frequent targets of predatory loans and other forms of
 exploitation,  along  with  all  consumer transactions. This legislation
 therefore rejects the limitation, imposed  by  courts,  that  prohibited
 conduct  be  "consumer oriented," have an impact on the public at large,
 or be part of a broader pattern.  Consumers  and  small  businesses  are
 entitled  to  redress  whenever they are harmed by deceptive, unfair, or
 abusive conduct.

  Finally, for any of these protections to be meaningful, the State must
 ensure that the remedies for prohibited  conduct  provide  an  effective
 deterrent.  This legislation therefore updates the statutory damages for
 violations for the first time in decades, from $50 to $1,000, and allows
 meaningful  punitive  damages  for  particularly egregious behavior. The
 Legislature recognizes that unfair,  deceptive,  and  abusive  practices
 have a particular impact on poor individuals, people of color, and those
 affected  by  natural  disasters  and  health emergencies, including the
 COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, the State must ensure  that  limited
 resources  not  prevent  individuals  and  small businesses from seeking
 remedies. This legislation therefore opens access to justice  by  making
 recovery  of  attorney's  fees  mandatory for a prevailing plaintiff and
 authorizing class actions.
  § 3. Section 349 of the general business law, as added by  chapter  43
 of  the  laws  of 1970, subdivision (h) as amended by chapter 157 of the
 laws of 1984, and subdivision (j) as added by section 6 of  part  HH  of
 chapter 55 of the laws of 2014, is amended to read as follows:
  §  349.  [Deceptive  acts] PROHIBITED ACTS and practices unlawful. (a)
 [Deceptive] THIS SECTION PROHIBITS ANY UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE acts
 or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the
 furnishing of any service [in this state are hereby declared unlawful].
  (1) FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, AN ACT  OR  PRACTICE  IS  UNFAIR
 WHEN  IT  CAUSES OR IS LIKELY TO CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL INJURY, THE INJURY IS
 NOT REASONABLY AVOIDABLE, AND THE INJURY IS NOT OUTWEIGHED  BY  COUNTER-
 VAILING BENEFITS.
  (2)  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, AN ACT OR PRACTICE IS DECEPTIVE
 WHEN THE ACT OR PRACTICE MISLEADS OR IS LIKELY TO MISLEAD A  PERSON  AND
 THE PERSON'S INTERPRETATION IS REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
  (3)  FOR  THE  PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, AN ACT OR PRACTICE IS ABUSIVE
 WHEN:
  (I) IT MATERIALLY INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY OF A  PERSON  TO  UNDER-
 STAND A TERM OR CONDITION OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE; OR
  (II) TAKES UNREASONABLE ADVANTAGE OF:
  (A)  A PERSON'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE MATERIAL RISKS, COSTS, OR
 CONDITIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE;
  (B) A PERSON'S INABILITY TO PROTECT HIS OR HER INTERESTS IN  SELECTING
 OR USING A PRODUCT OR SERVICE; OR
  (C) A PERSON'S REASONABLE RELIANCE ON A PERSON COVERED BY THIS SECTION
 TO ACT IN HIS OR HER INTERESTS.
  (b)  Whenever  the attorney general shall believe from evidence satis-
 factory to him OR HER that any person, firm, corporation or  association
 or agent or employee thereof has engaged in or is about to engage in any
 of  the  acts  or  practices stated to be UNFAIR, unlawful, DECEPTIVE OR
 ABUSIVE, he OR SHE may bring an action in the name and on behalf of  the
 people  of  the  state of New York to enjoin such unlawful acts or prac-
 tices and to obtain restitution  of  any  moneys  or  property  obtained
 directly  or  indirectly by any such unlawful acts or practices. In such
 action preliminary relief may be granted under  article  sixty-three  of
 the  civil  practice law and rules.  SUCH ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT REGARD-
 LESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE UNDERLYING VIOLATION IS DIRECTED AT  INDIVID-
 UALS  OR  BUSINESSES,  IS CONSUMER-ORIENTED, OR INVOLVES THE OFFERING OF
 GOODS, SERVICES, OR PROPERTY FOR PERSONAL, FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES.
  (c) Before any violation of this section is sought to be enjoined, the
 attorney general shall be required to give the person against whom  such
 proceeding  is  contemplated notice by certified mail and an opportunity
 to show in writing within five business days after receipt of notice why
 A. 7138  3
 
 proceedings should not be instituted against  him  OR  HER,  unless  the
 attorney  general  shall  find,  in  any  case  in which he OR SHE seeks
 preliminary relief, that to give such notice and opportunity is  not  in
 the public interest.
  (d)  In any such action it shall be a complete defense that the act or
 practice is, or if in interstate  commerce  would  be,  subject  to  and
 complies  with  the  rules and regulations of, and the statutes adminis-
 tered by, the federal trade commission or any official department, divi-
 sion, commission or agency of the United States  as  such  rules,  regu-
 lations  or  statutes are interpreted by the federal trade commission or

 to take any action or conduct any inquiry.

 general  pursuant  to  this  section, any person who has been injured by
 reason of any violation of this section may bring an action  in  his  OR

 recover [his actual damages or fifty dollars, whichever is  greater,  or
 both  such  actions] ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HIS OR HER ACTUAL DAMAGES,
 IF ANY, OR BOTH SUCH ACTIONS. SUCH ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT REGARDLESS  OF
 WHETHER  OR  NOT  THE  UNDERLYING  VIOLATION IS CONSUMER-ORIENTED, HAS A
 PUBLIC IMPACT OR INVOLVES THE OFFERING OF GOODS,  SERVICES  OR  PROPERTY
 FOR  PERSONAL,  FAMILY  OR  HOUSEHOLD  PURPOSES.  The court may, in its
 discretion, increase the award of damages [to an amount  not  to  exceed
 three times the actual damages up to one thousand dollars,] if the court
 finds  the  defendant  willfully or knowingly violated this section. The
 court [may] SHALL award  reasonable  attorney's  fees  AND  COSTS  to  a
 prevailing plaintiff.
