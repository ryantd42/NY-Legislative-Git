 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 11-a of section 2168 of the public health  law,
 as  added  by  a chapter of the laws of 2022, amending the public health
 law relating to protecting the confidentiality of  vaccine  information,
 as  proposed  in  legislative  bills numbers S. 6541-A and A. 7326-A, is
 amended to read as follows:

 information MAINTAINED BY THE DEPARTMENT, OR IN THE CASE OF THE CITYWIDE
 IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY, THE CITY OF NEW YORK UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
 SECTION with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  or
 successor  agency,  for  public health purposes in summary, statistical,
 aggregate, or other form such that no individual person can  be  identi-
 fied,  except  that  either  such commissioner may disclose identifiable
 registrant information to the federal Centers for  Disease  Control  and
 Prevention,  or  its  successor agency, when the commissioner has deter-
 mined that the disclosure is in the best interests of the registrant  or
 will  contribute  to  the  protection  of  public health[,] AND that the
 objective of the disclosure cannot be served by  disclosure  limited  to
 de-identified  information,  [and]  OR the federal health officials have
 committed in writing not to redisclose to or share  registrant  informa-
 tion  with  any  other  federal agency, including but not limited to the
 department of homeland security, immigration  and  customs  enforcement,
 customs  and  border  protection,  or  any  successor agency, or any law

 written commitment if requiring written commitment would result  in  the
 actual withholding of federal funds.
  §  2.  Paragraph  (d)  of  subdivision 4 of section 2168 of the public
 health law, as amended by a chapter of the laws of  2022,  amending  the
 public  health law relating to protecting the confidentiality of vaccine
 information, as proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 6541-A  and  A.
 7326-A, is amended to read as follows:
  (d)  [(i)  Identifiable  registrant  information is not (1) subject to
 discovery, subpoena, warrant, or other means  of  legal  compulsion  for
 release  to  any  person or (2) admissible in any civil, administrative,
 criminal, or family court proceeding, except for the purposes of  inves-
 tigations and prosecutions of allegations of computer tampering or bill-
 ing  fraud related to vaccination records, fraudulent statements related
 to an individual's vaccination status, an act of violence  or  attempted
 violence  occurring  at  the site of a vaccination provider's or vaccine
 navigator's business, or medical  malpractice.  Disclosure  for  these
 purposes  shall be subject to in camera review and approval by the court
 and, if the use is initiated by a party other than the individual  whose
 registry  information is sought, the information must be highly material
 and relevant for the purpose.
  (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit commissioners
 of local social services districts or the commissioner of the office  of
 children  and  family  services  from  accessing identifiable registrant
 information under paragraph (d) of subdivision eight of this section.] A
 PERSON, INSTITUTION OR AGENCY TO WHOM SUCH IMMUNIZATION  INFORMATION  IS
 FURNISHED  OR  TO WHOM, ACCESS TO RECORDS OR INFORMATION HAS BEEN GIVEN,
 SHALL NOT DIVULGE ANY PART THEREOF SO AS TO  DISCLOSE  THE  IDENTITY  OF
 SUCH  PERSON  TO WHOM SUCH INFORMATION OR RECORD RELATES, EXCEPT INSOFAR
 AS SUCH DISCLOSURE IS NECESSARY FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PERSON  OR
 OTHER PERSONS, CONSISTENT WITH THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.
  §  3. Paragraphs (f), (g) and (i) of subdivision 1, subparagraph (iii)
 of paragraph (c), subparagraphs (ii) and (iv) of paragraph (d) and para-
 graph (e) of subdivision 2 and subdivision 3  of  section  2169  of  the
 public  health  law, as added by a chapter of the laws of 2022, amending
 the public health law relating  to  protecting  the  confidentiality  of
 vaccine  information, as proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 6541-A
 and A.  7326-A, are amended to read as follows:
  (f) The term "personal information" shall  mean  information  obtained
 from  or  about  an individual, in connection with their registering for
 [or receiving] a vaccination, that directly  or  indirectly  identifies,
 relates  to,  describes,  is  capable of being associated with, or could
 reasonably be linked to a particular individual, household, or  personal
 device.  Information is reasonably linkable to an individual, household,
 or  personal  device if it can be used on its own or in combination with
 other reasonably available  information,  [regardless  of  whether  such
 other  information is held by the vaccine navigator or vaccine provider]
 WHEN SUCH INFORMATION IS HELD BY THE VACCINE NAVIGATOR, to  identify  an
 individual, household, or a personal device.
  (g) The term "service attendant to the delivery of immunization" shall
 mean  [scheduling and billing for] FACILITATING an immunization appoint-
 ment, sending reminders about immunization, arranging transportation  to
 or from a vaccine provider, or reporting to the department, the New York
 City  department  of  health  and  mental hygiene, or other local health
 agency on  whose  behalf  such  vaccine  navigator  is  performing  such
 services.
 A. 4132  3
 
  (i)  The  term "vaccine navigator" shall mean any person that collects
 personal information from an individual in order to register that  indi-
 vidual  for immunization or to help that individual register for immuni-
 zation, provided the department, a local  public  health  agency,  or  a
 person  that  administers  vaccines  OR  THEIR DESIGNEES are not vaccine
 navigators [if they only store vaccine recipient personal information in
 medical records protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability
 and Accountability Act of 1996, its implementing regulations, or section
 eighteen of this chapter].
  (iii) Without consent under this subdivision, personal information and
 any evidence derived therefrom shall not be subject to  or  provided  in
 response  to  any  legal process or be admissible for any purpose in any
 judicial or administrative  action  or  proceeding  UNLESS  PROVIDED  IN
 RESPONSE  PURSUANT  TO WARRANTS, COURT-ORDERED SUBPOENAS, ADMINISTRATIVE
 SUBPOENAS, OR GRAND JURY SUBPOENAS.
  (ii) A [person] VACCINE NAVIGATOR may only possess or  use  de-identi-
 fied  information  pertaining  to  services attendant to the delivery of
 immunization if the [person] VACCINE NAVIGATOR maintains technical safe-
 guards and  policies  and  procedures  that  prevent  re-identification,
 whether  intentional  or  unintentional,  of  any  individual, as may be
 required by the commissioner (or  the  New  York  city  commissioner  of
 health  and  mental  hygiene, in the case of information collected by or
 under authority of the New York city department  of  health  and  mental
 hygiene. The commissioner (or the New York city commissioner as the case
 may  be)  shall  require  safeguards, policies and procedures under this
 paragraph as the commissioner deems practicable.
  [(iv) This section does not prevent disclosure of personal information
 sought for the purposes of  investigations and prosecutions  of  allega-
 tions  of  computer  tampering  or  billing fraud related to vaccination
 records, fraudulent statements related to  an  individual's  vaccination
 status,  an  act of violence or attempted violence occurring at the site
 of a vaccination provider's or vaccine navigator's business, or  medical
 malpractice,  professional  discipline,  or defense of any claim brought
 against a vaccine navigator or provider.  Disclosure for these  purposes
 shall  be  subject to in camera review and approval by the court and, if
 the use is initiated by a party other than the individual whose registry
 information is sought, the information must be highly material and rele-
 vant for the purpose.]
  (e) A vaccine navigator  that  maintains  personal  information  shall
 establish  appropriate  administrative,  technical,  and  physical safe-
 guards, policies, and  procedures  that  ensure  the  security  of  that
 personal  information.  The safeguards, policies, and procedures must be
 appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal  information  main-
 tained  and the size, revenue, and sophistication of the vaccine naviga-
 tor and must ensure that personal information is encrypted and protected
 at least as much as or more than other confidential information  in  the
 vaccine  navigator's possession. The commissioner or, in the city of New
 York, the commissioner of the department of health  and  mental  hygiene
 [shall]  MAY  make  regulations  as reasonably necessary to require that
 personal information possessed, used, or under the control of a  vaccine
 navigator shall be subject to technical safeguards, policies, and proce-
 dures for storage, transmission, use, and protection of the information.
 The regulations must take into account the different sizes, revenues and
 sophistications  of  different vaccine navigators, as well as the volume
 and nature of the personal information they maintain.

  3. Vaccine providers. A vaccine provider shall not delay or  condition
 the  provision  of any service attendant to the delivery of immunization
 by inviting or requiring an individual seeking vaccination  to  complete
 an application for a customer discount card or account or share personal
 information  that will be stored outside of a [medical] record protected
 under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
 1996, its implementing regulations, or section eighteen of this  chapter
 for  purposes other than services attendant to the delivery of immuniza-
 tion, or by engaging in any other activity unrelated to the provision of
 such a service that the commissioner designates by regulation.

 public health law, as added by a chapter of the laws of  2022,  amending
 the  public  health  law  relating  to protecting the confidentiality of
 vaccine information, as proposed in legislative bills numbers S.  6541-A
 and A. 7326-A, are REPEALED and subdivision 19 is renumbered subdivision
 13.
  §  5.  Section 2183 of the public health law, as added by a chapter of
 the laws of 2022, amending the public health law relating to  protecting
 the  confidentiality  of vaccine information, as proposed in legislative
 bills numbers S. 6541-A and A. 7326-A, is amended to read as follows:
  § 2183. Immunity passports. 1. Any covered entity that requires  proof
 of COVID-19 immunization shall permit the use of physical immunity pass-
 ports.  No  covered  entity may require digital, electronic, or smart-
 phone-based proof of immunity.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THIS  SECTION,  ANYONE
 REQUIRING  AN IMMUNIZATION PASSPORT SHALL ACCEPT A VALID COVID-19 VACCI-
 NATION RECORD CARD  ALLOCATED  TO  COVID-19  VACCINE  PROVIDERS  BY  THE
 CENTERS  FOR  DISEASE  CONTROL  AND  PREVENTION  FOR  THAT  PURPOSE. THE
 PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY  TO  VALID  COVID-19  VACCINATION
 RECORD  CARDS ALLOCATED TO COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDERS BY THE CENTERS FOR
 DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION.
  2. [Any covered entity that requires the use of an  immunity  passport
 shall delete any personal information derived from the immunity passport
 about the individual to whom the immunity passport pertains within twen-
 ty-four hours of receiving it, except that where a covered entity has an
 ongoing  relationship  with  an individual, the covered entity may store
 the fact that the individual has received a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as
 a copy of the individual's immunity passport, provided that:
  (a) the covered entity first obtains the individual's informed, affir-
 mative, and voluntary consent to store such information, and
  (b) the covered entity stores any copy  of  an  individual's  immunity
 passport and any personal information derived from the immunity passport
 as  if  they were subject to the confidentiality requirements of title I
 of the Americans with Disabilities Act 42 U.S.C. 12112(d) and its imple-
 menting regulations, 29 CFR 1630.14.
  3. An immunity passport provider shall not use  or  disclose  personal
 information  derived  from an immunity passport beyond what is adequate,
 relevant, and necessary to identify an individual as having  received  a
 COVID-19  vaccine  or  a  COVID-19  test  result  and shall not collect,
 access, receive, capture, store, maintain,  use,  or  disclose  personal
 information  pertaining  to where or when an individual uses an immunity
 passport.
  4. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, no  covered  entity  or
 immunity passport provider may:
  (i)  provide personal information derived from an immunity passport or
 otherwise make such personal information accessible, directly  or  indi-
 rectly, to a law enforcement agent or entity or immigration authority;
 A. 4132  5

  (ii) provide such personal information or otherwise make such personal
 information  accessible, directly or indirectly, to any other individual
 or entity except as explicitly authorized by this section.
  (b)  Except  as  provided  in  this  subdivision, personal information
 derived from an immunity passport, and any evidence  derived  therefrom,
 shall  not be subject to or provided in response to any legal process or
 be admissible for any purpose in any judicial or  administrative  action
 or proceeding.
  (c)  Personal information derived from an immunity passport, and any
 evidence derived therefrom, may be disclosed for the purposes of  inves-
 tigations and prosecutions of allegations of computer tampering or frau-
 dulent  statements  related  to  an  individual's  vaccination  status.
 Disclosure for these purposes shall be subject to in camera  review  and
 approval by the court and, if the use is initiated by a party other than
 the  individual  whose  personal  information is sought, the information
 must be highly material and relevant for the purpose.
  5. The commissioner shall make regulations as reasonably necessary  to
 ensure that individuals who are medically contraindicated from receiving
 the  COVID-19 vaccine are nonetheless able to obtain reasonable accommo-
 dations to enable them to access the services of a covered entity, in  a
 manner  that  does not impose an undue hardship on the covered entity or
 present a direct threat that cannot be addressed by a reasonable  accom-
 modation.
  6.] Nothing in this section requires a covered entity to require proof
 of  COVID-19  immunity  or  to  independently  verify  the  information
 contained in an immunity passport.
  [7.] 3. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit a  covered
 entity's  obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, article
 fifteen of the executive law, the civil rights law, or any other  feder-
 al, state, or local anti-discrimination law.
  [8.] 4. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the prac-
 tices  of a health care provider, as defined in section eighteen of this
 chapter, a hospital or nursing home as defined in  article  twenty-eight
 of  this chapter, a health practitioner as defined in section twenty-one
 hundred sixty-four of this chapter, a facility, as  defined  in  section
 33.13  of  the  mental  hygiene  law,  or  a correctional health service
 governed by the department of corrections and community supervision, the
 rules of the board of correction in the city of New York,  or  a  county
 board  of correction, with respect to records concerning their patients'
 vaccinations.
  § 6. This act shall take effect on the  same  date  and  in  the  same
 manner  as a chapter of the laws of 2022, amending the public health law
 relating to protecting the confidentiality of  vaccine  information,  as
 proposed  in  legislative  bills  numbers S. 6541-A and A. 7326-A, takes
 effect.
