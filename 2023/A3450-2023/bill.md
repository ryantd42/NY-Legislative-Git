 AN ACT to amend the civil practice law and rules, in relation  to  arbi-
  tration awards in consumer and employment disputes
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 7507 of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  as
 amended  by  chapter  952  of  the  laws  of 1981, is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 7507. Award; form; time; delivery. (A) Except as provided in section
 7508, the award shall be in writing, signed and affirmed by the arbitra-
 tor making it within the time fixed by the agreement, or, if the time is
 not fixed, within such time as the court orders.
  (B) IN A MATTER INVOLVING A  CONSUMER  DISPUTE,  PURSUANT  TO  SECTION
 THREE  HUNDRED  NINETY-NINE-C OF THE GENERAL BUSINESS LAW, OR AN EMPLOY-
 MENT DISPUTE BETWEEN AN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE,  AS  DEFINED  IN  SECTION
 THREE  OF  THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938 (29 U.S.C. § 203), WHERE
 ARBITRATION WAS HELD PURSUANT TO A CONTRACT, THE AWARD SHALL  STATE  THE
 ISSUES  IN  DISPUTE  AND SHALL CONTAIN THE ARBITRATOR'S FINDINGS OF FACT
 AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW. SUCH AWARD  SHALL  CONTAIN  A  DECISION  ON  ALL
 ISSUES  SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION
 SHALL NOT APPLY TO AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED WITH ANY  LABOR  UNION  THROUGH
 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.
  (C)  The parties may in writing extend the time either before or after
 its expiration. A party waives the objection that an award was not  made
 within  the  time  required  unless he OR SHE notifies the arbitrator in
 writing of his OR HER objection prior to the delivery of  the  award  to
 him OR HER.
  (D)  The arbitrator shall deliver a copy of the award to each party in
 the manner provided in the agreement, or, if no provision  is  so  made,
 personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
