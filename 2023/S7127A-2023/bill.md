  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census data for the fire
 protection inspectors assumed to elect an FPI 25-Year Plan is summarized
 below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  82
  - Average Age:  41.6
  - Average Service:  13.6
  - Average Salary:  88,200

  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: The proposed  legislation
 would  provide  fire  protection inspectors a service retirement benefit
 under the FPI 25-Year Plans equal to 50% of Final Average  Salary  (FAS)
 for  the  first  25  years of Allowable Service, plus 2% of FAS for each
 additional year of Allowable Service exceeding 25 years up to a  maximum
 of 30 years. The FAS is based on a three-year average for Tier 4 members
 and a five-year average for Tier 6 members. The vested benefit under the
 FPI 25-Year Plans would be 2% of FAS for each year of Allowable Service.
  Members of the FPI 25-Year Plans would be required to pay Basic Member
 Contributions (BMC), which vary by tier, plus Additional Member Contrib-
 utions  (AMC)  equal  to 6.25% of compensation for all service as a Plan
 participant on and after the starting date of the Plan until  the  later
 of  the  one-year  anniversary  of the effective date of the Plans or 30
 years of Allowable Service. In no event shall BMC plus AMC exceed  9.25%
 of compensation.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems. In addition:
 S. 7127--A  11
 
  *  The  rates  of  retirement  for the FPI 25-Year Plans were assigned
 based on members' eligibility to elect or opt out of the plan.  The  FPI
 25-year  plan  will  be optional for current fire protection inspectors.
 Future members will be mandated into the FPI 25-year  plan  unless  they
 are over age 25 when hired as a fire protection inspector.
  *  New  entrants were assumed to replace exiting members so that total
 payroll for fire protection inspectors increases by 3%  each  year.  New
 entrant  demographics  were developed based on data for recent new hires
 and actuarial judgement. Future members, who are not over  age  25  when
 hired  as  a  fire  protection inspector, would be mandated into the FPI
 25-year plan.
  To determine the impact of the elective nature of the proposed  legis-
 lation,  a  subgroup  of NYCERS Fire Protection Inspectors was developed
 based on who is assumed to benefit  actuarially  by  comparing  the  net
 present  value  of  future employer costs of each member's benefit under
 their current plan and under the applicable FPI 25-Year Plan.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
