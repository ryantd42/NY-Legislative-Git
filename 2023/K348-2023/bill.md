  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 30 through May 6, 2023, Professional Municipal
  Clerks Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  weeks  that  are  set  aside  to  recognize  the  valuable
contributions of public servants whose work enhances the  lives  of  the
citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim April 30 through May 6,
2023, as Professional Municipal Clerks Week in the State of New York, in
conjunction with the observance of National Municipal Clerks Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Office  of  the  Professional  Municipal  Clerk,  a
time-honored  and  vital part of local government, exists throughout the
world and is the oldest position among public servants; it provides  the
professional  link  between the citizens, the local governing bodies and
agencies of government at other levels; and
 
  WHEREAS, Professional Municipal  Clerks  have  pledged  to  be  ever
mindful of their neutrality and impartiality, rendering equal service to
all; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The Professional Municipal Clerk serves as the information
center on functions of local government and community; and
 
  WHEREAS, Initiated in 1969 by  IIMC  and  endorsed  by  all  of  its
members  throughout  the  United  States, Canada and 15 other countries,
Professional  Municipal  Clerks  Week  is  a  time  of  celebration  and
reflection on the importance of the Clerk's office; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed a proclamation that
officially declared Municipal Clerks Week the first full week of May; in
1994  and  1996,  President  Bill  Clinton  also  signed  proclamations
confirming Municipal Clerks Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, This year, the 54th Annual  Professional  Municipal  Clerks
Week  will  feature a week-long series of activities aimed at increasing
the public's awareness of Municipal Clerks and  the  essential  services
they provide for local government and the community-at-large; and
 
  WHEREAS, Professional Municipal Clerks continually strive to improve
the  administration  of  the  affairs  of the Office of the Professional
Municipal Clerk through participation in education  programs,  seminars,
workshops and the annual meetings of their state, provincial, county and
international professional organizations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  most  appropriate  that  we  recognize  the
accomplishments of the Office of the Professional Municipal  Clerk,  and
further extend appreciation to all Professional Municipal Clerks for the
 
vital  services  they  perform  and  their  exemplary  dedication to the
communities they represent; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 30  through  May  6,
2023,  as  Professional  Municipal Clerks Week in the State of New York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
