  MOURNING  the  death  of  The  Reverend  Franklin
  Florence, renowned  religious  leader,  local  civil
  rights icon, and devoted member of his community
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of this Legislative Body to bring full
recognition and just  tribute  to  those  men  and  women  of  religious
commitment  who accept the responsibility of moral leadership and render
the wisdom of human understanding; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is with profound intent that this  Legislative  Body  is
moved  to  pay homage to a man of indomitable faith and dedication whose
purposeful life and accomplishments will forever stand as a paradigm and
inspiration for others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Minister Franklin Florence,  a  true  freedom  fighter  and
trailblazer for civil rights and social justice in his beloved community
of  Rochester, New York, died on Wednesday, February 1, 2023, at the age
of 89; and
 
  WHEREAS, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Florence was born August 9, 1933,
in the black Overtown neighborhood of Miami; his mother was  a  domestic
worker  and his father, a railroad worker and ice salesman, died when he
was just three years old; his mother went on to remarry and  the  family
read the Bible together every evening; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Minister  Franklin  Florence spent five years preaching in
Florida before taking a job in 1959, at the age of 25, as pastor at  the
Reynolds  Street  Church  of Christ in Rochester; he was paid $65 a week
with lodging upstairs from the sanctuary for him, his wife Mary, and his
children; and
 
  WHEREAS, Upon his arrival to Rochester, Minister  Franklin  Florence
graced  his  community  and the national stage with a dynamic voice that
championed the concerns of Black Americans and the universal  causes  of
social justice; he first gained local prominence as an advocate during a
series  of  police  brutality  cases  involving  the  Rochester  Police
Department; and
 
  WHEREAS, Minister Franklin Florence was visiting his family in Miami
in July of 1964 when the Rochester  uprising  took  place,  but  quickly
returned  to  the  city  and  stood at the forefront of the newly urgent
demand for racial justice; his role in this  vital  movement  was  later
depicted in a 2006 documentary, "July '64"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Authentic  and  unwavering  in  his  principals,  Minister
Franklin Florence was never afraid  to  get  into  "good  and  necessary
trouble"  to expose racial and systemic injustice across a wide range of
issues, including quality housing,  criminal  justice  and  corrections,
fair  labor  practices,  equitable  education,  child  welfare  and
generational poverty; and
 
  WHEREAS, Among his many accomplishments  was  his  founding  of  the
F.I.G.H.T.  (Freedom,  Independence,  God, Honor, Today) organization in
 
1964;  the  organization  advocated  first  for  desegregation  in  the
Rochester City School District, then for the improvement of mostly-black
schools; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Under  the  able leadership of Minister Franklin Florence,
F.I.G.H.T. also took  on  Xerox  and  the  Eastman  Kodak  Company  over
discriminatory  hiring  practices,  creating  the  foundation for a more
diverse corporate workforce today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through F.I.G.H.T. Square and F.I.G.H.T. Village,  Minister
Franklin  Florence  provided  housing  to  thousands;  additionally, his
creation of Eltrex  Industries  was  instrumental  in  the  creation  of
countless jobs in the Rochester community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  he  tirelessly  advocated  for greater black
representation  in  community  agencies,  investigation  into  police
brutality and the patronage of black-owned businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  role  model  and  mentor  to  many young Black leaders,
Minister Franklin Florence could always be  counted  on  to  stand  with
people  who  were  fighting  for rights, whether it was supporting Black
students at SUNY Brockport, the University  of  Rochester,  and  Colgate
Divinity  School, or protesting the Public Defender selection process in
2009; and
 
  WHEREAS, Minister Franklin Florence was  a  giant  among  giants  in
Rochester's  proud legacy of social justice and civil rights; fittingly,
his name and image are now embedded into the city landscape on  a  mural
on  the  outer  wall  of East High School alongside Malcolm X and Connie
Mitchell, and as the namesake of the Minister Franklin D. Florence Civil
Rights Heritage Site at Baden Park; and
 
  WHEREAS, Minister Franklin Florence's  life  was  dedicated  to  the
preservation and enhancement of human dignity; this resolute gentleman's
finest  legacy  of greater social justice for all was truly reflected in
his devotion to serve and respect others, and in his steadfast love  for
all humanity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  extraordinary  man  selflessly  fought  the evils of
racism during the most terrible days of apartheid; he inspired an entire
nation with his words and his courage, truly reviving the people's  hope
during the darkest of times; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  apostle  of  peace,  Minister Franklin Florence fought
unrelentingly for the civil rights of all people,  and  taught  us  that
through  non-violence,  courage  displaces  fear,  love transforms hate,
acceptance dissipates prejudice and mutual regard cancels enmity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Minister  Franklin  Florence's  monumental  legacy  will
continue  to shine forth as a beacon of hope for all those who aspire to
create a just and peaceful world; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
mourn  the  death  of The Reverend Franklin Florence, and to express its
deepest condolences to his family; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the family of The Reverend Franklin Florence.
