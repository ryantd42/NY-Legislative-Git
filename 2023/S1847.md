  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1.  Subdivision (c) of section 1283 of the tax law is amended

 PROCESSING FEES RESULTING FROM A CREDIT CARD OR OTHER  NON-CASH  PAYMENT
 OPTION  SELECTED  BY SUCH PASSENGER. THE PASSING ALONG OF SUCH SURCHARGE

 SITION  OF  THE SURCHARGE ON THE PERSON OR ENTITY THAT PAYS FOR THE FOR-
 HIRE TRANSPORTATION TRIP.  ALL REGULATORY AGENCIES MUST ADJUST ANY FARES
 THAT ARE AUTHORIZED BY THEM TO INCLUDE THE  SURCHARGE  IMPOSED  BY  THIS
 ARTICLE,  AND  MAY ADJUST SUCH AUTHORIZED FARE TO INCLUDE ANY PROCESSING
 FEES IMPOSED ON THE PAYMENT OF SUCH SURCHARGE, AND MUST REQUIRE THAT ANY
 METER OR OTHER INSTRUMENT USED IN ANY FOR-HIRE VEHICLE REGULATED  BY  IT

 ANT FEES WHERE AUTHORIZED. ANY PROCESSING  FEES  CHARGED  TO  PASSENGERS
 SHALL ALSO BE SEPARATELY STATED ON ANY RECEIPT PROVIDED TO PASSENGERS.

 S. 1847  2
 
 PROCESSING  FEES  RESULTING FROM A CREDIT CARD OR OTHER NON-CASH PAYMENT
 OPTION SELECTED BY SUCH PASSENGER. The passing along of  such  surcharge
 shall  not be construed by any court or administrative body as the impo-
 sition  of  the surcharge on the person or entity that pays for the for-
 hire transportation trip. All regulatory agencies must adjust any  fares
 that  are  authorized  by  them to include the surcharge imposed by this
 article, AND MAY ADJUST SUCH AUTHORIZED FARE TO INCLUDE  ANY  PROCESSING
 FEES IMPOSED ON THE PAYMENT OF SUCH SURCHARGE, and must require that any
 meter  or  other instrument used in any for-hire vehicle regulated by it
 to calculate fares be adjusted to include the surcharge AND ANY  ATTEND-
 ANT  FEES  WHERE  AUTHORIZED.  ANY PROCESSING FEES CHARGED TO PASSENGERS
 SHALL ALSO BE SEPARATELY STATED ON ANY RECEIPT PROVIDED TO PASSENGERS.
  § 3. (a) For purposes of this  section,  the  term  "surcharge"  shall
 mean:
  (i) the taxicab improvement surcharge, the rush hour surcharge and the
 nighttime  surcharge  imposed on taxicab fares pursuant to section 58-26
 of the rules of the city of New York; and
  (ii) any other surcharge imposed on taxicab or other  for-hire  trans-
 portation  fares  which is not specifically set forth in section 1283 or
 1299-b of the tax law, or in paragraph (i) of this subdivision.
  (b) Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the  contrary,  any
 surcharge imposed upon a taxicab or for-hire transportation fare must be
 passed  along to passengers and separately stated on any receipt that is
 provided to such passengers,  and  may  include,  if  permitted  by  the
 authorizing  regulatory  agency,  any  processing  fees resulting from a
 credit card or other non-cash payment option selected by such passenger.
 The passing along of any such surcharge shall not be  construed  by  any
 court  or administrative body as the imposition of any such surcharge on
 the person or entity that pays for the taxicab or  for-hire  transporta-
 tion  trip.  All  regulatory  agencies  must  adjust  any fares that are
 authorized by them to include any surcharges imposed by the state or any
 other governmental body, and may adjust such authorized fare to  include
 any  processing  fees  imposed  on  the  payment  of  such  surcharge or
 surcharges, and must require that any meter or other instrument used  in
 any  taxicab  or  for-hire vehicle regulated by it to calculate fares be
 adjusted to include such surcharge or surcharges and any attendant  fees
 where  authorized.  Any processing fees charged to passengers shall also
 be separately stated on any receipt provided to passengers.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
