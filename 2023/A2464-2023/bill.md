  Section  1.  Paragraph 1 of subsection (c-1) of section 606 of the tax
 law, as amended by section 1 of part P of chapter  59  of  the  laws  of
 2018, is amended to read as follows:
  (1) A resident taxpayer WITH A NEW YORK STATE ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME OF

 in equal to the greater of [one]: (A) FIVE  hundred  dollars  times  the
 number  of qualifying children of the taxpayer WHO ARE FOUR YEARS OF AGE
 OR OLDER AND ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TIMES THE NUMBER OF  QUALIFYING  CHIL-
 DREN  OF  THE  TAXPAYER  WHO ARE LESS THAN FOUR YEARS OF AGE; or (B) the

 subsection, a qualifying child shall be a child who meets the definition
 of qualified child under section 24(c) (1) of the internal revenue  code
 [and  is at least four years of age]. The applicable percentage shall be
 thirty-three percent. For purposes of this subsection, any reference  to
