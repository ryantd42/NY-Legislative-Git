  May 8-14, 2023, as Lung Cancer Action  Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official weeks that are set  aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
health issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 8-14, 2023, as Lung
Cancer Action Week in  the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with
National Lung Cancer Action Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, Each year, the second week in May is designated Lung Cancer
Action Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  About  every  two  and  a quarter minutes, a person in the
United States is diagnosed with lung cancer, which is the leading  cause
of cancer deaths; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lung  cancer  screening  saves  lives,  and  advocacy  and
increased awareness will result in more  high-risk  individuals  getting
screened; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Public  support  for  research  funding will result in new
treatments and better methods of early detection; and
 
  WHEREAS, LUNG FORCE is a national initiative  led  by  the  American
Lung Association to defeat lung cancer; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative  that there be greater public awareness
about the risk of lung cancer to New Yorkers and the importance for  New
York citizens to take action and talk to their healthcare provider about
risk  factors and recommended lung cancer screenings; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 8-14, 2023, as Lung
Cancer Action Week in the State of New York; and be it further
