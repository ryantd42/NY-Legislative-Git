  May 30, 2023, as 10th  Mountain  Division  and  Fort
  Drum Day in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Fort  Drum is located in Jefferson County, in Northern New
York, and is the  largest  military  installation  in  the  Northeastern
United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fort  Drum,  previously known as Pine Camp, was renamed in
honor of Lieutenant General Hugh Drum, a decorated national hero, former
commander of First  Army,  and  an  early  leader  of  the  State's  own
volunteer militia, the New York Guard; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than three decades, Fort Drum has been the home of
the United States Army's storied 10th Mountain Division, one of the most
deployed divisions in the United States Army; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Members  of  the  10th  Mountain  Division have served our
nation with honor,  distinction,  and  great  sacrifice  as  a  part  of
Operation  Enduring  Freedom  and  other actions central to our nation's
response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; and
 
  WHEREAS, Elements of the 10th Mountain Division, based on Fort Drum,
were the first to be deployed in the aftermath of those attacks and  the
last units to return from combat duty; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  addition  to  Operation  Enduring  Freedom,  the  10th
Mountain Division deployments have included Hurricane Andrew  Relief  in
Florida,  Operation  Restore Hope in Somalia, Operation Uphold Democracy
in Haiti, Task Force Eagle in Kosovo, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation
Freedom Sentinel  in  Afghanistan,  and  advise  and  assist  operations
throughout the World; and
 
  WHEREAS,  More  than  300  brave  men and women of the 10th Mountain
Division have given  their  lives  to  the  cause  of  defeating  global
terrorism; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Distinguished  service of units assigned to Fort Drum have
been celebrated by Presidents, members of Congress, and members  of  the

Monti,  Captain  William D. Swenson, and Staff Sergeant Travis W. Atkins
have received our military's highest honor, the Medal of Honor; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to its vital role in our nation's defense, Fort
Drum is also the largest employer in  Northern  New  York,  the  State's
largest  single-site  employer, and an economic engine for the State and
region; the Fort has a total impact of $1.9 billion; and
 
  WHEREAS, A special bond exists between Fort Drum  and  the  civilian
communities  surrounding  it;  the 33,000 soldiers and family members of
 
the installation are an integral part of the North Country who not  only
are  considered  defenders  of  our  freedom,  but  also  our neighbors,
co-workers, classmates, friends, and fellow New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of this Legislative Body to salute the
soldiers and officers of the 10th  Mountain  Division,  to  honor  their
dedication  to  preserving  our freedom and our nation, and to recognize
their individual and collective contributions to our communities and  to
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  the  past  nine years, the 10th Mountain Division and
Fort Drum Day has served to educate members  of  this  Legislative  Body
about  the  sacrifices  made every day by the brave men and women of our
Armed Forces, as well as the importance of Fort  Drum  to  our  nation's
defense and New York's economy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fort Drum has and will continue to play a critical role in
ensuring our nation's military readiness to defend our state and  nation
against  hostility and threats to our safety and national security; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim May 30, 2023, as 10th
Mountain Division and Fort Drum Day in the State of New York; and be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be

Mountain Division, and Fort Drum.
