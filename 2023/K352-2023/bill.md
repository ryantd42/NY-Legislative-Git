  State's Korean War Veterans and recognizing the  men
  and  women  who served with dignity and honor during
  this historic time period at the Senate's  Inaugural

  WHEREAS,  Members  of  the United States Armed Forces, who served so
faithfully and courageously in wars in which our Nation's freedom was at
stake, as well as in the preservation of peace during peacetime, deserve
the highest commendation of this Legislative Body; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, this Legislative Body  is  proud
to  welcome  veterans  of  the  Korean  War  to  the  Senate  Chamber on
Wednesday, April 26, 2023, for its inaugural celebration in  recognition
of  the  brave  men  and  women  who served our country with dignity and
honor; and
 
  WHEREAS, On  June  25,  1950,  communist  North  Korea  invaded  the
Republic  of Korea with approximately 135,000 troops, thereby initiating
the Korean War; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 27, 1950, President Harry Truman ordered the United
States Armed Forces to help the Republic of Korea defend itself  against
the North Korean invasion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hostilities ended in a cease-fire marked by the signing of
the armistice at Panmunjom on July  27,  1953,  although  the  peninsula
still technically remains in a state of war; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  the Korean War, approximately 1,789,000 members of
the United States Armed Forces served in theater along with  the  forces
of  the  Republic of Korea and 20 other members of the United Nations to
defend freedom and democracy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Casualties in the United States  Armed  Forces  during  the
Korean  War  included  54,246  dead (of whom 33,739 were battle deaths),
more than 103,284 wounded, and approximately 8,055 listed as missing  in
action or prisoners of war;
 
  WHEREAS, The Korean War Veterans Recognition Act was enacted on July
27,  2009,  so that the honorable service and noble sacrifice by members
of the United States Armed Forces  in  the  Korean  War  will  never  be
forgotten; and
 
  WHEREAS,  President  Barack Obama issued a proclamation to designate
July 27, 2009, as the National Korean War  Veterans  Armistice  Day  and
called  upon  Americans  to display flags at half-staff in memory of the
Korean War veterans; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since 1975, the Republic of Korea has invited thousands  of
American  Korean  War  veterans,  including  members  of  the Korean War
Veterans  Association,  to  revisit  Korea  in  appreciation  for  their
sacrifices; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  In  the 73 years since the outbreak of the Korean War, the
Republic of Korea has emerged from a war-torn economy into  one  of  the
major  economies in the world and one of the largest trading partners of
the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, the Republic of Korea is among the closest allies of
the United States, having contributed troops in support of United States
operations during the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and operations in Iraq  and
Afghanistan,  while also supporting numerous United Nations peacekeeping
missions throughout the world; and
 
  WHEREAS, From the ashes of war and the sharing of spilled  blood  on
the  battlefield,  the  United  States  and  the  Republic of Korea have
continuously  stood  shoulder-to-shoulder  to  promote  and  defend
international peace and security, economic prosperity, human rights, and
the rule of law both on the Korean Peninsula and beyond; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
recognize and celebrate Korean War Veterans in the State of New York  on
April 26, 2023.
