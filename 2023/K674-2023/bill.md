  COMMEMORATING  the  1st  Anniversary  of  Latina
  History Day on May 4, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, New York State is home to nearly four million Latinos,  and
Latinas are increasingly a driving force behind the community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Latinas  have roots in various cultures and regions of the
world, including South America,  Central  America,  the  Caribbean,  and
across the globe; and
 
  WHEREAS, Latinas play an important and critical part in our society;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Latinas  in  New  York  are of all ages and walks of life,
including students, teachers, labor  leaders,  entrepreneurs,  community
leaders  and  elected  officials,  we take this opportunity to honor the
contributions that Latina women have made to our state's history; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Latinas  still  experience  employment  and  wage
discrimination,  healthcare disparities, and inequities in the education
system; and
 
  WHEREAS, Latinas  are  fighting  for  a  world  with  political  and
economic parity through leadership, education, and advocacy; and
 
  WHEREAS, Latinas are breaking glass ceilings and pioneering in areas
our mothers and grandmothers would dream for us; and
 
  WHEREAS, Latinas are increasingly becoming more politically engaged,
contributing  to  rising rates in voter turnout, being elected to public
office and appointed to powerful positions; and
 
  WHEREAS, Latinas in New York stand on the shoulders of  giants  like
Sylvia  Rivera,  Supreme  Court  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Representative
Nydia Velazquez, Jennifer Lopez, and many more; and
 
  WHEREAS, Latina History Day presents an opportunity  to  commemorate
the historic and current achievements of Latinas; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  We  justly celebrate contemporary Latinas who continue to
build upon the foundation of  their  ancestors  for  the  betterment  of
future generations; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Latina leaders in New York State.
