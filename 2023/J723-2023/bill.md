  HONORING  Firefighter  Richard  Bush  upon  the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  65 years of dedicated service to the Lowville
  Volunteer Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  Firefighter
Richard  Bush  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation  for  special
recognition  after  65  years  of  dedicated  service  to  the  Lowville
Volunteer  Fire  Department  to  be  celebrated  at an Annual Banquet on
Saturday, April 22, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Richard "Rick" Bush  joined  the  Lowville  Volunteer  Fire
Department  in  May of 1957; throughout his 65 years of service, he held
several positions within the Department including the role of  President
from 1971-1972, and currently serves as the head of the Truck Committee,
being  actively  involved in the purchases of nearly all apparatuses the
Department operates; and
 
  WHEREAS, Having received the esteemed designation of Firefighter  of
the  Year  three  times,  Firefighter  Richard Bush has always been, and
continues to be, a shining example of excellence in his service; he  was
given the award in 1987 and 2005 for his dedicated time and service, and
again  in 2011 for his effort in battling a major block fire in downtown
Lowville; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighter  Richard  Bush  participated  in  many  parades
throughout  his  time  with the Department, including field day parades,
convention parades, and The Lewis County Parades; and
 
  WHEREAS, Volunteer firefighters unwaveringly serve our  great  State
with  pride,  valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often
the first to respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is  a  fire,
transportation  accident,  natural  disaster,  act of terrorism, medical
crisis, or spill of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Richard  Bush  is  one  such firefighter; throughout 65 years of devoted
service, this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the  call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
honor  Firefighter Richard Bush upon the occasion of his designation for
special recognition after 65 years of dedicated service to the  Lowville
Volunteer Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter Richard Bush.
