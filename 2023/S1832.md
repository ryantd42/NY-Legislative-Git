 TION FOR SAID LICENSE PLATE SHALL BE FILED WITH THE COMMISSIONER IN SUCH
 FORM AND DETAIL AS THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PRESCRIBE.
  2. THE DISTINCTIVE PLATE AUTHORIZED HEREIN SHALL BE ISSUED UPON PROOF,
 SATISFACTORY TO THE COMMISSIONER, THAT THE APPLICANT IS AN ARMY MEDAL OF

 REGISTRATION FEE OR SERVICE CHARGE SHALL BE CHARGED FOR SUCH PLATE.
  § 2. 1. A distinctive plate established pursuant to section 404-ff  of
 the  vehicle  and  traffic law as added by section one of this act shall
 only be designed, produced and issued upon the delivery to  the  depart-

 be  executed  by a surety company authorized by the department of finan-
 cial services to transact business in  this  state.  Provided,  however,

 that  if the commissioner of motor vehicles shall have received prior to
 plate design, production and issuance at least two  hundred  orders  for
 such  distinctive  plate  together  with  the  additional annual service
 charge  applicable to each such order, which shall be non-refundable, no
 such surety bond shall be required.  All such service charges  shall  be
 deposited  pursuant  to  the provisions of section 404-oo of the vehicle
 and traffic law to the  credit  of  the  department  of  motor  vehicles

 distinctive plates in the  series  are  first  available  for  sale  two
 hundred  or more sets of such plates are sold, a bond delivered pursuant
 to this section shall be discontinued. If fewer than two hundred sets of
 such plates are sold by such time, such department shall be entitled  to
 recover against the bond in an amount proportionate to such shortfall.

 tion, amendment and/or repeal of any rule or  regulation  necessary  for
 the  implementation  of this act on its effective date are authorized to
 be made and completed on or before such effective date.
