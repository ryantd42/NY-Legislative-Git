 AN ACT to establish the New York state democracy commission; and provid-

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings. The legislature finds and declares
 that the American democracy was under attack on January 6, 2021  in  the
 United  States  Capitol  by  insurrectionists attempting to overturn the
 legal election of Joseph Biden for the United States presidency  through
 violence,  intimidation  and by other means. There is legitimate concern
 that this attempt to overthrow our democracy will  occur  again  at  the
 federal, state and local levels.
  §  2.  1.  A  temporary  state commission, to be known as the New York
 state democracy commission, hereinafter referred to as  the  commission,
 is  hereby  created  to  make recommendations and create a report of its
 findings relating to issues involving:
  a. the state of democracy in New York state;
  b. how to protect, strengthen and expand democracy in New  York  state
 on the state and local levels;
  c. how to expand voter registration and voter turnout;
  d. how to strengthen the integrity of the voting process;
  e. ways to improve civics education in schools; and
  f.  how  to  prevent  attempts  to  illegitimately  overturn  a lawful
 election on a local, state and federal level  taking  into  account  the
 events  that  led  up  to the January 6, 2021 insurrection in the United
 States Capitol and events thereafter to undermine American democracy.
  2. a.  The  commission  shall  consist  of  thirteen  members,  to  be
 appointed  as  follows:  six members shall be appointed by the governor;
 two members shall be appointed by the temporary president of the senate;
 two members shall be appointed by  the  speaker  of  the  assembly;  one

 member  shall  be  appointed  by  the minority leader of the senate; one
 member shall be appointed by the minority leader of  the  assembly;  and
 one  member shall be the attorney general of New York state. The commis-
 sion shall be chaired by a member appointed by the governor.
  b.  The  members  of  the commission shall receive no compensation for
 their services but shall be allowed their actual and necessary  expenses
 incurred  in the performance of their duties under this act. The commis-
 sion may employ and at pleasure remove such personnel  as  it  may  deem
 necessary  for  the  performance  of its functions and fix their compen-
 sation within the amounts made available by appropriation therefor.
  3. The commission may request and shall receive from any agency in the
 state and from any subdivision, department, board,  bureau,  commission,
 office, agency or other instrumentality of the state or of any political
 subdivision  thereof  such  facilities,  assistance and data as it deems
 necessary or desirable for the proper execution of its powers and duties
 and to effectuate the purposes set forth in this act.
  4. The report shall include any recommendations for legislative action
 as it may deem necessary and appropriate and shall be delivered  to  the
 governor,  the  temporary  president  of  the senate, the speaker of the
 assembly, and posted on the website of the Secretary of State  no  later
 than  one  year  after  the effective date of this act. The report shall
 also be posted on the website of the governor.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately and shall  expire  and  be
 deemed repealed 2 years after such date.
