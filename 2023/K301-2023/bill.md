BY: M. of A. Solages
 
  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 19, 2023, as Human Milk Day in the State of  New
  York,  in  conjunction  with the observance of World
  Human Milk Day
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body, in keeping  with
its  time-honored traditions, to recognize and pay tribute to the unique
contributions which donor-breastfeeding mothers make  to  other  mothers
and their babies in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 19, 2023, as Human
Milk Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
World Human Milk Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Human breast milk contains antibodies that help  fight  off
viruses  and bacteria; newborn babies who are fed breast milk within the
first six months have fewer infections  and  respiratory  illnesses;  in
addition,  breast  milk  reduces the risk of a baby developing asthma or
allergies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Milk banks in New York,  with  a  milk  bank  from  another
country, hold in tandem an event at the same time, 10:00 a.m. for coffee
and  cake  in Eastern North America, and 3:00 p.m. for tea and scones in
England; and
 
  WHEREAS, May 19th was originally designated in Brazil as World Human
Milk Donation Day because on this date, the first agreement to create  a
network  of  milk  banks in Latin America was signed by 13 countries and
international organizations in South and Central America; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the World Health Organization, over  1,000,000
babies  die  every  year from complications associated with prematurity,
and it is the leading cause of death for infants  under  four  weeks  of
age; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  World Health Organization and the American Academy of
Pediatrics, among many other health care organizations and associations,
agree that when a mother's own milk is not available for fragile babies,
the next best alternative is banked donor human milk; and
 
  WHEREAS, For every 28 children who receive exclusive milk diets, one
case of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), requiring surgery is  prevented
at a cost of approximately $398,000; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the practice of this Legislative Body to recognize
those important days which remind  us  of  the  mothers  who  selflessly
donate  their  human  breast  milk for babies and preemies in this great
State and Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to proclaim May 19, 2023, as Human
 
Milk Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
World Human Milk Day,  in  honor  of  the  donation  that  breastfeeding
mothers  make to other mothers and their babies in the State of New York
who have enriched our Nation; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
