  granting certain county fire marshals, supervising fire marshals, fire

  chief fire marshals pension benefits for service rendered beyond twen-

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Subdivision t of section 604 of the retirement and social
 security law, as amended by section 7 of part II of chapter  55  of  the
 laws of 2023, is amended to read as follows:
  t.  The  early service retirement benefit for a member who is employed
 in the county of Nassau as  a  county  fire  marshal,  supervising  fire
 marshal,  fire  marshal,  assistant  fire  marshal, assistant chief fire
 marshal, chief fire marshal or  division  supervising  fire  marshal  as
 defined  in  section  eighty-nine-w  of  this chapter shall be a pension
 equal to one-fiftieth of final average salary times  years  of  credited
 service at the completion of twenty-five years of service as such county
 fire  marshal,  supervising  fire  marshal, fire marshal, assistant fire
 marshal, assistant chief fire marshal, chief fire  marshal  or  division
 supervising fire marshal, but not exceeding one-half of his or her final
 average  salary,  FOR  SERVICE BEYOND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AND FOR NON-FIRE
 MARSHAL COUNTY SERVICE THE BENEFIT IS INCREASED BY ONE-SIXTIETH OF FINAL
 AVERAGE SALARY FOR EACH YEAR OF ADDITIONAL SERVICE CREDIT.
  §  2.  All  past  service  costs  associated  with  implementing  the

  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would modify the service retirement benefit for members of
 the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement  System  employed  by
 Nassau  County  in certain fire marshal job titles. The modified service
 retirement benefit will be one-half of final average salary  (FAS)  upon
 completion  of  twenty-five  years of creditable service with additional
 sixtieths for  each  year  of  creditable  service,  including  non-fire
 marshal  service,  in  excess  of twenty-five years. The current service
 retirement benefit is one-half of FAS  upon  completion  of  twenty-five
 years of creditable service.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $44,000 in the
 annual contributions of Nassau County for the fiscal year  ending  March
 31,  2024. In future years, this cost will vary as the billing rates and
 salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $744,000 which  will  be
 borne by Nassau County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes that
 payment  will  be  made  on February 1, 2024. If Nassau County elects to
 amortize this cost over a 10-year period, the cost for  the  first  year
 including interest would be $95,000.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based on 44 affected members employed by
 Nassau County, with annual salary of approximately $5.0  million  as  of
 March 31, 2022.
