 AN ACT to require annual reports and create a regents  review  board  to
  audit  assessments  used  to  determine grade promotion, graduation or
  adequate yearly progress for validity, reliability, alignment to stan-
  dards and appropriateness of use

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Reporting requirements. 1. (a) Not later than September
 fifteenth of each year, the commissioner of education  shall  submit  to
 the  state  board  of regents, the temporary president of the senate and
 the speaker of the assembly:
  (i) A written report  that  conclusively  demonstrates  the  validity,
 reliability,  alignment  to  the state learning standards established by
 the department of education (learning standards) and appropriateness  of
 use  for  its intended purposes for each assessment (noting each instru-
 ment and the dates of usage) used by  the  department  of  education  to
 determine  a  student's eligibility for a high school diploma, promotion
 to grade, or measurement of adequate yearly  progress  (AYP)  under  the
 federal  No Child Left Behind Act of a school or district in the preced-
 ing school year.  Demonstration of  assessment  validity,  reliability,
 alignment  to learning standards and appropriateness of use must be made
 in accordance with applicable  professional  assessment  guidelines  and
 standards  of  the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the
 American Psychological Association (APA) and  the  National  Council  on
 Measurement  in  Education  (NCME)  (collectively and as may be modified
 from time to time, the joint standards), including pedagogic and curric-
 ular, as well as psychometric, standards.
  (ii) A technical manual for each assessment used by the department  of
 education  and  used  to  determine  a  student's eligibility for a high
 school diploma, promotion to grade, or measurement of AYP of a school or

 district in the preceding school year. The technical manual must  comply
 with  the professional requirements of the assessment industry as recog-
 nized by the AERA, APA and NCME.
  (b)  The annual report and technical manual shall be made available to
 the public upon submission to the state board  of  regents  and  to  the
 temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assembly.
  2.  Failure of the commissioner of education to produce a report under
 subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a) of subdivision one of this section  or
 a  technical  manual  under  subparagraph (ii) of such paragraph for any
 given assessment shall be deemed a failure to demonstrate the  validity,
 reliability,  alignment to learning standards and appropriateness of use
 of such assessment, and the results from such assessment  shall  not  be
 used  to  determine  a  student's eligibility for a high school diploma,
 promotion to grade, or measurement of AYP of a school or district in the
 preceding school year. The commissioner of education shall substitute an
 alternate measure for the decision taken on the basis  of  the  adminis-
 tered  assessment.  Where  a  decision  to graduate or promote a student
 cannot be based on a demonstrably  valid  standardized  assessment,  the
 decision  will  be based on a combination of final grade in the relevant
 academic courses and faculty recommendations in place of the results  of
 such examination. Any part of an assessment not demonstrated to be valid
 shall not be used for any subsequent determination.
  §  2.  Audit requirements. The state board of regents shall appoint an
 independent panel of experts  on  curricular  assessments  qualified  to
 determine  whether  or not an assessment meets professional standards of
 the measurement industry and scholarly associations for validity,  reli-
 ability, alignment to learning standards and appropriateness of use. The
 panel  shall be known as the regents review board, hereafter referred to
 as the board.  The board shall consist of five members. The  members  of
 the  board  will  be  members of the AERA or the APA. Each member of the
 board will be a recognized expert in the field of testing  psychometrics
 or  curriculum evaluation and will have at least ten years experience in
 evaluating validity, reliability, alignment with learning standards  and
 appropriateness  of  use  of  tests  at the primary and secondary school
 levels.
  1. The board shall review each assessment used by  the  department  of
 education  to determine a student's eligibility for a high school diplo-
 ma, promotion to grade, or measurement of AYP of a school or district to
 determine whether the assessment meets the joint standards  for  assess-
 ment  validity,  reliability, alignment to learning standards and appro-
 priateness of use. The board  shall  also  review  the  commissioner  of
 education's annual report and supporting materials concerning the valid-
 ity, reliability, alignment to learning standards and appropriateness of
 use of the assessments, and the technical manual of each assessment. The
 board  shall  have complete access to all documents of the department of
 education relating to the assessments reviewed by the  board,  including
 pilot  and/or field test results for such assessments and any changes to
 materials or practices relating to such  assessments  implemented  as  a
 result  of  such  pilot and/or field tests. The board shall maintain the
 confidentiality of all documents deemed to contain proprietary  informa-
 tion.
  2.  The  board  shall determine whether or not each assessment used by
 the department of education for graduation, promotion  or  determination
 of AYP is valid, reliable, aligned to the learning standards, and appro-
 priate for use. The board shall submit, not later than October fifteenth
 of  each  year,  a  written report of its findings to the state board of
 A. 1282  3
 
 regents, the temporary president of the senate and the  speaker  of  the
 assembly.  The  report  shall  be  made available to the public upon its
 submission as provided in this subdivision.
  3.  If the board determines that any part of an assessment used by the
 department of education does not meet the standards for validity,  reli-
 ability, alignment to learning standards or appropriateness of use under
 the  joint  standards,  such part or parts of those assessments shall be
 considered invalid, and the results from such assessment  shall  not  be
 used  to  determine  a  student's eligibility for a high school diploma,
 promotion to grade, or measurement of AYP of a school or district in any
 school year. The commissioner of education shall substitute an alternate
 measure for the decision taken on the basis of the administered  assess-
 ment.  Where  a decision to graduate or promote a student is based on an
 assessment not demonstrably valid, the  decision  will  be  based  on  a
 combination  of final grade in the relevant academic courses and faculty
 recommendations in place of the results of such examination. The  deter-
 mination of the board shall be final as to the use of those assessments.
  4.  If  any  part of an assessment used by the department of education
 has been determined by the board to fail to meet the joint standards and
 related research for  assessment  validity,  reliability,  alignment  to
 learning standards or appropriateness of use, the commissioner of educa-
 tion  shall  not  use such part or parts of the assessment in any subse-
 quent test administrations.
  § 3. Pilot testing. 1. No later than sixty days prior to  the  depart-
 ment of education's scheduled administration of any assessment to deter-
 mine  a  student's  eligibility  for a high school diploma, promotion to
 grade, or measurement of AYP of a school or district  in  the  preceding
 school  year,  the  commissioner of education shall submit to the board,
 the state board of regents and the temporary president of the senate and
 the speaker of the assembly the results of all pilot and/or field  tests
 conducted  for  that  assessment  and  make  available  to the board all
 records relating to such pilot and/or field  tests  and  results.  Pilot
 and/or  field  tests  are  assessments administered by the department of
 education that are not being used for decisions of graduation, promotion
 to grade, or measurement of AYP but contain  individual  questions  that
 are to be used on assessments to determine a student's eligibility for a
 high  school  diploma,  promotion  to  grade, or measurement of AYP. For
 purposes of this section, results of  pilot  and/or  field  tests  shall
 include,  but not be limited to, analysis of answers to questions on the
 administered pilot  and/or  field  test  based  on  percentage  answered
 correctly,  breakdown of results according to race and gender, an expla-
 nation of how the pilot and/or  field  test  was  administered,  and  an
 explanation  of  the learning standard a question purports to test.  The
 failure to submit and identify pilot and/or field  test  results  or  to
 provide  access  to  records  as  required  under this subdivision shall
 preclude the department of education from  using  or  administering  the
 assessment.
  2. Where the board has received from the commissioner of education the
 results  of  the  pilot  and/or field test for an assessment as required
 under subdivision one of this section, the board shall, not  later  than
 thirty  days  prior  to the department of education's scheduled adminis-
 tration of such assessment, deliver to the state board  of  regents  and
 the  temporary president of the senate and the speaker of the assembly a
 written report evaluating the pilot and/or field tests and  the  results
 of the pilot and/or field tests provided by the department of education.
 The written report of the board shall be made available to the public.

  3.  In its evaluation, the board will identify any recognizable short-
 comings of the pilot and/or field tests. If the  board  determines  that
 any  part  of the pilot and/or field tests were not conducted in accord-
 ance with the joint standards, that they fall short of  needed  prepara-
 tion,  or  if  it appears to the board that the assessment for which the
 pilot and/or field tests were conducted is likely to fail  to  meet  the
 criteria  for validity, reliability, alignment to learning standards, or
 appropriateness of use under the joint standards, the board shall recom-
 mend to the state board of regents  that  the  department  of  education
 shall  not  use  or administer the assessment for which the pilot and/or
 field tests were conducted. The state board  of  regents  shall,  within
 fourteen  days  of  receipt of the board's report, provide to the board,
 the temporary president of the senate and the speaker  of  the  assembly
 written notice of the actions proposed to be taken by the state board of
 regents  with  respect  to the recommendations of the board contained in
 such report.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal  of  any  rule  or regulation necessary for the implementation of
 this act on its effective date are authorized to be made  and  completed
 on or before such effective date.
