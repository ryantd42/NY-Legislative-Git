 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  workers'  compensation  law, in relation to the
  requirement for policyholders to provide 30-days  notice  to  withdraw
  from the state insurance fund

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision a of section 94 of  the  workers'  compensation
 law,  as  amended by chapter 635 of the laws of 1996, is amended to read
 as follows:
  a.  Any employer may, upon complying with subdivision two or three  of
 section  fifty of this chapter, withdraw from the fund by turning in his
 insurance contract for  cancellation,  provided  he  has  given  written
 notice  to  the  fund  of his intention to withdraw not less than thirty
 days before the effective date of such cancellation.  Upon  receipt  of
 such  notice  the  fund  shall, at least ten days prior to the effective
 date file in the office of the chairman a notice  of  such  cancellation
 date.
  In  no event shall the insurance contract be deemed cancelled until at
 least ten days after the date of such filing, any earlier date mentioned
 in the notice to the contrary notwithstanding.
  If an employer withdraws from the fund upon complying with subdivision
 two of section fifty of this chapter, the new  insurance  contract  with
 the stock corporation, mutual corporation or reciprocal insurer shall be
 deemed  not  to  take  effect  until the cancellation of such employer's
 contract with the state insurance fund has become effective.
  THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL NOT APPLY WHEN AN  EMPLOYER
 HAS GIVEN WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE FUND OF HIS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW, WHICH
 SHALL INCLUDE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH CANCELLATION AND PROOF THAT THE
 EMPLOYER  HAS  COMPLIED  WITH  SUBDIVISION  TWO OF SECTION FIFTY OF THIS

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 INSURER TAKES EFFECT.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
