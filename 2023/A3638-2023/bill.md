  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Subdivision 23 of section  265.00  of  the  penal  law,  as

 attached tubular device designed to accept,  and  capable  of  operating
 only  with, .22 caliber rimfire ammunition or a feeding device that is a

 possessed by an individual who is not prohibited by state or federal law
 from  possessing  a  firearm and (iv) is registered with the division of
 state police pursuant to subdivision sixteen-a of section 400.00 of this
 chapter, except such feeding devices transferred into the state  may  be
 registered  at any time, provided they are registered within thirty days
 of their transfer into the state.  PROVIDED, FURTHER,  THAT  SUCH  TERM

 AND CAPABLE OF OPERATING ONLY WITH .44 CALIBER RIMFIRE OR .44-40 CALIBER
 AMMUNITION IF SUCH TUBULAR DEVICE IS ATTACHED TO A RIFLE THAT WAS  MANU-
