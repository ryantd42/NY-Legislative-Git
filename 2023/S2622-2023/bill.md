  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 1 of a chapter of the laws of 2022 authorizing  the
 Bellmore  Fire  District  to file an application for exemption from real
 property taxes, as proposed in legislative bills numbers S.  6035-A  and
 A.  6950-A, is amended to read as follows:

 the  assessor  of the [town of Hempstead,] county of Nassau[,] is hereby
 authorized to accept from the Bellmore Fire District, an application for
 exemption from real property taxes pursuant to section [464] 410 of  the
 real  property  tax  law  with  respect  to  the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022
 assessment rolls, for a portion of the 2020 general taxes and a  portion
 of the 2020-2021 school taxes, all of the 2021 general taxes, all of the
 2021-2022  school  taxes  and  all  of  the  2022 general taxes, for the
 parcels owned by such organization, with such parcels being  located  at

 department may, in its sole discretion, provide for the  refund  of  the
 taxes  paid,  along  with  any  fines  or penalties paid, and cancel any
 taxes, fines, penalties, interest, or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the  same  date  and  in  the  same
 manner  as  a  chapter of the laws of 2022 authorizing the Bellmore Fire
 District to file an application for exemption from real property  taxes,
 as  proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 6035-A and A. 6950-A, takes
 effect.
