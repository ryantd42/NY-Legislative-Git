 Introduced  by  Sen. JACKSON -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the general municipal law, in relation  to  disabilities
  of deputy sheriffs in certain cities
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The general municipal  law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 207-r to read as follows:
  § 207-R. DISABILITIES OF DEPUTY SHERIFF MEMBERS OF A RETIREMENT SYSTEM
 IN  CERTAIN  CITIES.  1.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF ANY GENERAL,
 SPECIAL OR LOCAL LAW OR ADMINISTRATIVE CODE TO THE CONTRARY, BUT  EXCEPT
 FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION LAW AND THE LABOR LAW, ANY
 CONDITION  OF  IMPAIRMENT  OF  HEALTH  CAUSED  BY DISEASES OF THE HEART,
 RESULTING IN TOTAL OR PARTIAL DISABILITY OR DEATH  TO  A  PAID  EMPLOYEE
 PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF A DEPUTY SHERIFF IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OF
 A CITY OF ONE MILLION OR MORE, WHERE SUCH EMPLOYEE IS DRAWN FROM COMPET-
 ITIVE  CIVIL  SERVICE LISTS, WHO SUCCESSFULLY PASSED A PHYSICAL EXAMINA-
 TION ON ENTRY INTO THE SERVICE OF  SUCH  DEPARTMENT,  WHICH  EXAMINATION
 FAILED  TO  REVEAL  ANY EVIDENCE OF SUCH CONDITION, SHALL BE PRESUMPTIVE
 EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS INCURRED IN THE PERFORMANCE AND DISCHARGE OF  DUTY,
 UNLESS THE CONTRARY BE PROVED BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE.
  2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, A DEPUTY SHERIFF MEMBER
 RETIRING  PURSUANT  TO THE PROVISIONS OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION
 SHALL RECEIVE A PENSION EQUAL TO THREE-FOURTHS OF  SUCH  MEMBER'S  FINAL
 AVERAGE SALARY.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF  BILL: This proposed legislation, as it relates to the New
 York City Retirement Systems and Pension Funds (NYCRS), would add a  new
 General  Municipal  Law  (GML)  Section  207-r to provide certain Deputy
 Sheriff members of  the  New  York  City  Employees'  Retirement  System

 (NYCERS) a rebuttable statutory presumption that a qualifying partial or
 total disability or death related to a heart disease was incurred in the
 performance of duty.
  The  presumption  of causation could be rebutted by competent evidence
 to the contrary.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  IMPACT ON BENEFITS PAYABLE: Currently, a New York City Deputy  Sheriff
 who  becomes disabled or dies due to heart disease would be eligible for
 an applicable  ordinary  disability  retirement,  generally  a  lifetime
 payment  of 1/3 of salary, or a lump sum ordinary death benefit, respec-
 tively.
  Those eligible to receive the performance of duty  disability  retire-
 ment  under  the proposed legislation would receive a benefit similar to
 the current accidental disability retirement afforded  to  Deputy  Sher-
 iffs.
  The current accidental disability benefit for Tier 4 and Tier 6 NYCERS
 Deputy Sheriff members is equal to:
  * 75% of final average compensation, where
  * the average compensation is computed using five consecutive years of
 wages, less
  * any applicable Workers' Compensation benefit.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  the performance of duty disability
 benefit for NYCERS Deputy Sheriff members who are  disabled  from  heart
 disease would be equal to:
  * 75% of Final Average Salary (FAS), where
  *  FAS  is defined as 3-Year FAS for Tier 4 and 5-Year FAS for Tier 6,
 without
  * an explicit Workers' Compensation offset.
  The ordinary death benefit for Tier 4 and Tier 6 NYCERS Deputy Sheriff
 members is a lump sum payment equal to three times the  member's  salary
 multiplied  by  the  member's years of service, up to a maximum of three
 years. The performance of duty death benefit is  generally  equal  to  a
 lifetime  benefit of 50% of a member's wages earned during the last year
 of service, payable to certain beneficiaries.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - OVERVIEW: There is no data  available  to  estimate
 the  number  of members who might develop and become disabled or die due
 to heart disease and potentially benefit from this proposed legislation.
 Therefore, the estimated financial impact has been calculated on  a  per
 event basis equal to the increase in the present value of future employ-
 er  contributions  for  an average member who could potentially be diag-
 nosed with disabling heart  disease  and  who  would  benefit  from  the
 proposed legislation.
  In determining the increase in the present value for members who could
 benefit  from  the presumption provided by the proposed legislation upon
 disability, it has been assumed that  50%  of  the  members  would  have
 retired  under  an Ordinary Disability Retirement (ODR) benefit, and the
 remaining 50% of members would have  continued  working  and  eventually
 retired for service if the proposed legislation were not passed.
  In determining the increase in the present value for beneficiaries who
 could  benefit from the presumption provided by the proposed legislation
 upon death, it has been assumed that  100%  of  such  members  would  be
 eligible  for an Ordinary Death Benefit if the proposed legislation were
 not passed.
  With respect to an individual member,  the  additional  cost  of  this
 proposed legislation could vary greatly depending on the member's length
 of  service, age, and salary history. In particular, the increase due to
 S. 6254  3
 
 the proposed legislation would be greater for a member who  is  not  yet
 eligible  for  an  ODR benefit when the disabling heart disease is diag-
 nosed.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  PRESENT VALUES: Based on the census data and the
 actuarial assumptions and methods described  herein,  the  enactment  of
 this  proposed  legislation  would  increase the present value of future
 employer contributions by approximately $426,700, on average,  for  each
 occurrence  of  Performance  of  Duty Disability Retirement due to heart
 disease and $349,000, on average, for each occurrence of Performance  of
 Duty Death due to heart disease.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  -  ANNUAL EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS: Enactment of this
 proposed legislation would increase employer contributions,  where  such
 amount  would  depend on the number of members affected as well as other
 characteristics including the age, years of service, and salary  history
 of each member.
  Based  on  the actuarial assumptions and methods described herein, the
 enactment of this proposed legislation is estimated to  increase  annual
 employer  contributions by approximately $50,500 for each Performance of
 Duty Disability Retirement due to heart  disease  and  by  approximately
 $41,300 for each Performance of Duty Death due to heart disease.
  As  there  is  no  data  currently available to estimate the number of
 members who might be diagnosed with heart disease, the financial  impact
 would  be  recognized  at  the  time  of event. Consequently, changes in
 employer contributions have been estimated assuming that the increase in
 the present value of future employer contributions will be financed over
 a closed 15-year period (14 payments under the One-Year Lag Methodology)
 using level dollar payments.
  With respect to the timing, increases in employer contributions  would
 depend  upon  when members would retire or die due to heart disease but,
 generally, increased employer contributions will first occur the  second
 fiscal  year following approval of the performance of duty disability or
 death benefit.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  used  in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS to deter-
 mine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The 146 NYCERS Deputy Sheriffs as of June 30, 2022 had an average  age
 of  approximately  42.0  years,  average  service  of approximately 11.6
 years, and an average salary of approximately $85,700.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used  for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions of NYCERS.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted population, and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
  * The impact of this  proposed  legislation  on  Other  Postemployment
 Benefit costs.
