 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. SANTABARBARA -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Agriculture
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to  author-
  izing the delivery of liquefied petroleum gas in times of emergency
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraph b of subdivision 6-a  of  section  192-e  of  the
 agriculture  and  markets law, as added by a chapter of the laws of 2022
 amending the agriculture and markets law  relating  to  authorizing  the
 delivery  of  liquefied petroleum gas in times of emergency, as proposed
 in legislative bills numbers S. 8426 and A. 1451-A, is amended and a new
 paragraph f is added to read as follows:
  b. Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the  contrary,
 when a qualifying emergency is in effect, a residential customer who has
 a  contract  with  a  regular supplier to fill a liquefied petroleum gas
 tank reasonably believes the amount of liquefied petroleum gas in  their
 tank  will  be  insufficient  to  meet the customer's heating needs, the
 customer shall make a good faith effort to procure delivery of liquefied
 petroleum gas from such regular supplier. If  the  regular  supplier  is
 unable to make a scheduled delivery or fulfill the customer's good faith
 request, directly or through another supplier, for delivery within twen-
 ty-four  hours,  the  customer may arrange to have a temporary emergency
 supplier fill, refill or otherwise deliver liquefied petroleum gas  into
 such liquefied petroleum gas tank, provided that the temporary emergency
 supplier  ensures that such tank, and the devices and pipelines operated
 in connection with such tank,  have  been  inspected  and  certified  as
 required  by law and all applicable regulations. THE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY
 SUPPLIER SHALL ASSUME ALL LIABILITY THAT MAY RESULT  FROM  THE  IMPROPER
 FILLING,  INSPECTION,  OR TESTING OF SUCH TANK.  THE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY
 SUPPLIER THAT FILLS, REFILLS, OR OTHERWISE DELIVERS LIQUIFIED  PETROLEUM
 GAS  UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION MUST NOTIFY THE REGULAR SUPPLIER, IN WRITTEN
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  F.  IN  ALL  OTHER  CIRCUMSTANCES  OTHER  THAN THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS
 SECTION, IT SHALL NOT BE  PERMISSIBLE  FOR  ANY  PERSON,  FIRM,  LIMITED
 LIABILITY  COMPANY OR CORPORATION TO REMOVE OR FILL ANY LIQUIFIED PETRO-
 LEUM GAS FROM A LIQUIFIED PETROLEUM GAS  TANK,  CYLINDER,  CONTAINER  OR
 RECEPTACLE  WITHOUT  THE  CONSENT  OF  THE OWNER OF SUCH TANK, CYLINDER,
 CONTAINER OR RECEPTACLE.
  § 2.  This act shall take effect on the same  date  and  in  the  same
 manner  as  a  chapter  of the laws of 2022 amending the agriculture and
 markets law relating to authorizing the delivery of liquefied  petroleum
 gas  in  times of emergency, as proposed in legislative bills numbers S.
 8426 and A.  1451-A, takes effect.
