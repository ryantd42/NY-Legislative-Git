 Introduced  by  M.  of A. LAVINE, SEAWRIGHT -- read once and referred to
  the Committee on Governmental Operations
 
 AN ACT to amend the executive law and the  penal  law,  in  relation  to
  protections against anti-Semitism in the human rights law
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and  determinations.  The  legislature
 finds  and determines that discrimination and attacks have been unfairly
 and wrongfully levied and directed against the Jewish people  and  their
 faith for generations, from ancient times to the present. Such discrimi-
 nation  and  attacks,  manifesting themselves through acts of anti-Semi-
 tism, have proven to be among the most despicable acts of mankind, call-
 ing witness to countless  acts  of  death,  deprivation,  injustice  and
 holocaust.
  The  legislature further finds and determines that anti-Semitism sadly
 remains  today,  still  a  persistent,  disturbing  problem  in  certain
 segments  of  society,  political movements, on college campuses, and by
 select disturbed and/or seriously misguided or hateful individuals.
  The legislature also finds and determines that acts  of  anti-Semitism
 have  even  very  recently  resulted in homicidal attacks against Jewish
 places of worship in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in the defacement  and
 mutilation of publicly displayed photographs in New York City of a prom-
 inent and respected Jewish member of the United States Supreme Court.
  The legislature additionally finds and determines that both the feder-
 al  Department of Justice, and the federal Department of Education, have
 properly concluded that both state and federal law  prohibits  discrimi-
 nation  against persons of the Jewish faith, as well as members of other
 religious groups, when such discrimination is based  on  the  actual  or
 perceived religious faith, shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, or
 when  the  discrimination is based on actual or perceived citizenship or

 residence in a country whose residents share a dominant  religion  or  a
 distinct religious identity.
  The  legislature  further  finds  and  determines  that persons of the
 Jewish faith, and/or of Jewish heritage, are continuing  to  be  threat-
 ened,  harassed  or intimidated in their daily lives, work and education
 (including on their college campuses) and in the practice of their reli-
 gion, by acts of anti-Semitism, due to  the  basis  of  their  religious
 belief,  shared  ancestry  or  ethnic characteristics, including but not
 limited to harassing conduct  that  creates  a  hostile  environment  so
 severe,  pervasive,  or  persistent  as to interfere with or limit their
 ability to participate in or benefit from the services,  activities,  or
 opportunities  offered by their daily life, work, schools or practice of
 their faith and/or religious principles.
  The legislature finally  finds  and  determines  that  legislation  is
 therefore  necessary  to  place a definition of anti-Semitism within the
 state human rights law, to specifically provide that acts of  anti-Semi-
 tism  shall constitute a violation of the state human rights law, and to
 further provide that anti-Semitism that incites, causes  or  results  in
 any  act  of  violence,  or  injury  to  a  person,  or the damage to or
 destruction of real or personal property, shall be deemed to  constitute
 a hate crime.
