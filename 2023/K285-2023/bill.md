  WHEREAS, Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and its members  are  dedicated

and
 
  WHEREAS, The Boy Scouts of America have so manifestly contributed to
the  preservation  of  those  treasured  ideals  of  compassion,  honor,

American Heritage; this auspicious event will celebrate  the  leadership
the  Troop  33 Scouting program has provided to the youth of the Village
of Walden and its surrounding communities for 100 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, Troop 33 started as Troop 3 in May 1923, chartered  by  the
First Reformed Church of Walden through the efforts of Reverend Theodore
F.  Bayles;  the  church  formed  a  Troop Committee headed by prominent

Marcus  Millspaugh  Sr.  as the first Scoutmaster; since then, the Troop
has had 11 Scoutmasters, the most recent being Gabe Gonzalez; and

the  Troop  as  well,  winning  many  trophies and awards at local Scout
rallies and camporees; Troop leaders have also received  various  awards
recognizing their contributions to Scouting, including multiple District
Awards  of  Merit,  Silver  Beaver  awards and inductions into the Eagle
Scout Hall of Fame; and
 
  WHEREAS, Scouts from the Troop  have  gone  on  to  become  valuable
members  of  the  community,  becoming  doctors,  judges,  ministers,
businessmen, soldiers, and even Scoutmasters of the Troop; not only have
former Scouts become esteemed members of the  community  but  many  have
served  the  community  through  volunteer organizations from local fire
departments to Rotary, Masons and Knights of Columbus among others; and
 
  WHEREAS, A true asset to its  community,  Boy  Scout  Troop  33  has
engaged  in  countless  service  projects  through  the years, including
