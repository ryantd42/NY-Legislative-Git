  COMMENDING  Western Star Lodge No. 15, Bridgewater
  Masonic Temple upon the occasion of celebrating  its
  225th Anniversary
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay  tribute  to  those  organizations  of  high  purpose  and  worthy
accomplishment whose endeavors have faithfully served the welfare of the
citizens of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commend  Western  Star Lodge No. 15, Bridgewater Masonic Temple upon the
occasion of its 225th Anniversary which was  celebrated  at  a  Luncheon
with  members  of the Mount Markham High School Cheerleading Squad and a
Rededication Ceremony on Saturday, December 17, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Masonry  is  the  world's  first  and  largest  fraternal
organization,  and  is  based  on  the  belief  that  each  man  has  a
responsibility to help make the world  a  better  place;  through  their
culture  of philanthropy, these men make a profound difference for their
brothers, their families, their communities, and their future; and
 
  WHEREAS, For the last 225 years, the members of Western  Star  Lodge
No.  15  have  stayed  true to the Masons' mission of fostering personal
growth and improving the lives of  others  through  its  principles  and
tradition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Shortly  after  the  Hamlet  of Bridgewater, New York, was
formed, two early settlers, Joseph Farwell and Ephriam Waldo, and  other
like-minded  men  of  faith  joined  together to form an organization in
which they could practice charity and care, not only for their own,  but
also  for  the  community  as  a  whole  through  charitable  giving and
volunteer efforts; and
 
  WHEREAS, The original petition to form a lodge was  filed  on  April
21,  1796,  and  the charter was granted on January 18, 1797; originally
known as Western Star  Lodge  No.  59  F&AM,  the  Lodge  first  met  on
Farwell's Hill; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1815, it was decided to build at the intersection of the
new  Cherry  Valley  Turnpike  and the Utica to New Berlin road, and one
year later, a new building was erected with the Warren  Chapter  No.  22
R.A.M.  on  South  Street  on the site of the Cottage Hotel barn; it was
moved to its present location in 1864, and major repairs  were  made  in
1872  and  1892,  making the dimensions of the building and its interior
Lodge meeting room specific to the Masonic ritual; and
 
  WHEREAS, Western Star Lodge No. 15 is the  oldest  lodge  in  Oneida
County  that  has met continuously for over 223 years, and is one of the
oldest lodges in New York State; due to its storied history,  the  Lodge
was  featured  in  a  magazine  article  and  in a book on early Masonic
Symbols in Upstate New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of Western Star  Lodge  No.  15  is  in  direct
correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its Master, Earl G. Wilkinson; Senior
Warden, David D. Holbert; Junior Warden, Robert  G.  Dauchy;  Treasurer,
Charles  L.  Corbin;  Secretary, Brian F. Twitchell; Senior Deacon, Bill
Friedel;  Junior  Deacon,  Richard  E. Foster; Chaplain, John P. Murray;
Tiler, John J. Seiselmyer; Trustees, Charles S. Newell, Donald Bradbury,

has  been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is proudly moved to honor and commend
the  members  of  Western Star Lodge No. 15, Bridgewater Masonic Temple,
past and present, who have labored  so  conscientiously  to  secure  and
improve the quality of life for the community it serves; now, therefore,

occasion of celebrating its 225th Anniversary; and be it further
