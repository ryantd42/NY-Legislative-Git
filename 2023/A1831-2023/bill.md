  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "reputa-

  § 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds, (a) in the aftermath
 of  the  January  6th storming of the United States Capitol, that groups
 who had supported lawmakers in  overturning  the  presidential  election
 results  had  financial backing from private equity firms and big corpo-
 rations, and (b) that public pension investments through  the  New  York
 State  Common  Retirement  Fund  and analogous pension funds in New York
 state municipalities must account for reputational risk for the  welfare
 of New York state public employees.
  § 3. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding a new
 section 177-f to read as follows:
  §  177-F.  RESTRICTION  OF  CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN FIRMS. 1.  FIRMS IN

 527  OF  THE  INTERNAL  REVENUE CODE OR TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS DEFINED

  2. SENIOR EXECUTIVES AT SUCH FIRMS ARE PROHIBITED FROM MAKING INDIVID-
 UAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN EXCESS OF TEN  THOUSAND  DOLLARS  TO  THE  ENTITIES
 LISTED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION.
  3.  SENIOR  EXECUTIVES AT SUCH FIRMS WHO MAKE INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
 TO THE ENTITIES LISTED IN SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION  AT  OR  BELOW
 TEN  THOUSAND  DOLLARS  SHALL  DISCLOSE SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS TO EITHER THE
 DEPARTMENT OF AUDIT AND CONTROL, THE OFFICE OF THE NEW YORK STATE  COMP-
 TROLLER  OR  THE  OFFICE  OF  THE  NEW  YORK CITY COMPTROLLER, WHICHEVER
 DEPARTMENT OR OFFICE OVERSEES THE FUND.
