 chapter  12  of  the  laws  of  1996, and paragraphs (B), (C) and (D) as
 amended by chapter 677 of the laws of  1985,  are  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  After a child, other than a child in residential care, who is reported
 to  the  central  register  of  abuse or maltreatment reaches the age of
 eighteen years, access to a child's record under subparagraphs  (a)  and
 (b) of this paragraph shall be permitted only if a sibling or off-spring
 of  such  child is before such person and is a suspected victim of child
 abuse or maltreatment. In addition, a person  or  official  required  to
 make  a  report  of  suspected  child  abuse or maltreatment pursuant to
 section four hundred thirteen of this  [chapter]  TITLE  shall  receive,
 upon  request,  the  findings  of an investigation made pursuant to this
 title.  However, no information may be released  unless  the  person  or
 official's  identity is confirmed by the office. If the request for such
 information is made prior to the completion of  an  investigation  of  a
 report,  the released information shall be limited to whether the report
 is "indicated", "unfounded" or "under investigation", whichever the case
 may be. If the request for such information is made after the completion
 of an investigation of a  report,  the  released  information  shall  be
 limited  to  whether the report is "indicated" or "unfounded", whichever
 the case may be. A person given access to the names or other information
 identifying the subjects of the report, or other persons  named  in  the
 report,  except  the subject of the report or other persons named in the
 report, shall not divulge or make public  such  identifying  information
 unless  he  or she is a district attorney or other law enforcement offi-
 cial and the purpose is to initiate court action or  the  disclosure  is
 necessary  in  connection  with  the investigation or prosecution of the
 subject of the report for a crime alleged to have been committed by  the
 subject  against  another  person  named  in the report. Nothing in this
 section shall be construed to permit any release,  disclosure  or  iden-
 tification  of the names or identifying descriptions of persons who have
 reported suspected child abuse or maltreatment to the statewide  central
 register  or  the  agency,  institution,  organization, program or other
 entity where such persons  are  employed  or  the  agency,  institution,
 organization  or  program  with  which  they are associated without such
 persons' written permission except to persons, officials,  and  agencies
 enumerated  in  subparagraphs  (e), (f), (h), (j)[, (l), (m)] and (v) of
 this paragraph.
  To the extent that persons or agencies are given access AND to  infor-
 mation  pursuant  to  subparagraphs  (a), (b), (c), (j), (k)[, (l),] AND
 (m)[, (o) and (q)] of this paragraph, such persons or agencies may  give
 and  receive  such  information  to each other in order to facilitate an
 investigation conducted by such persons or agencies.
  (B) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law to the contrary,
 a city or county social services commissioner may withhold, in whole  or
 in part, the release of any information which he or she is authorized to
 make  available  to persons or agencies identified in subparagraphs (a),
 (k), [(l),] (m), (n)[,] AND (o)[, (p) and (q)] of paragraph (A) of  this
 subdivision if such commissioner determines that such information is not
 related  to the purposes for which such information is requested or when
 such disclosure will be detrimental to the child named in the report.
  (C) A city or county social services commissioner who denies access by
 persons or agencies identified in subparagraphs (a),  (k),  [(l),]  (m),
 (n)[,]  AND  (o)[,  (p) and (q)] of paragraph (A) of this subdivision to
 records, reports or other information or  parts  thereof  maintained  by
 such  commissioner  in accordance with this title shall, within ten days
 S. 3247  3
 
 from the date of receipt of the request fully explain in writing to  the
 person  requesting the records, reports or other information the reasons
 for the denial.
  (D)  A  person  or agency identified in subparagraphs (a), (k), [(l),]
 (m), (n)[,] AND (o)[, (p) and (q)] of paragraph (A) of this  subdivision
 who  is  denied access to records, reports or other information or parts
 thereof maintained by a local department  pursuant  to  this  title  may
 bring  a proceeding for review of such denial pursuant to article seven-
 ty-eight of the civil practice law and rules.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day  after  it  shall
 have  become a law. Effective immediately the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal of any rule or regulation necessary  for  the  implementation  of
 this  act  on its effective date are authorized to be made and completed
