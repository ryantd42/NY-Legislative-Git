  CENSUS  DATA:  The estimates presented herein are based on preliminary
 census data collected as of June 30,  2023.  The  census  data  for  the
 impacted population is summarized below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  54
  - Average Age:  46.3
  - Average Service:  13.1
  - Average Salary:  79,400
 
  BACKGROUND:  Currently, Tier 4 or Tier 6 NYCERS members who exceed age
 30 upon being mandated into a Dispatcher 25-Year Plan, have  the  option
 to  irrevocably opt out of the plan within 180 days. Members who opt out
 of the plan are generally placed into one of the Tier 4 or Tier 6 under-
 lying plans.
  Under the proposed legislation, such members who failed to opt out  of
 the  Dispatcher 25-Year Plan in the original 180 days would have another
 180-day period in which to opt out of the Plan.
  For the purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that  members  who
 opt  out  of  the Dispatcher 25-Year Plan under the proposed legislation
 would be entitled to an immediate refund  of  excess  Additional  Member
 Contributions (AMC), with interest.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and methods to be used for
 the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2025 employer contributions of the  impacted
 retirement systems.
  To  determine the impact of the elective nature of the proposed legis-
 lation, a subgroup of members was developed based on who is  assumed  to
 benefit actuarially by comparing the net present value of future employ-
 er  costs  of  each  memberÆs benefit under their current plan and under
 their applicable underlying plan.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 Actuaries.  We  are  members of NYCERS but do not believe it impairs our
 objectivity and we meet the  Qualification  Standards  of  the  American

  FISCAL NOTE IDENTIFICATION: This Fiscal Note 2024-09 dated January 25,
 2024  was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
