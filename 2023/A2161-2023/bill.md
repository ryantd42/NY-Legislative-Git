 amount  which  may be so contributed or accepted, in the aggregate, from
 any candidate's child, parent, grandparent, brother and sister, and  the
 spouse  of  any  such persons, shall not exceed in the case of any nomi-

  e.  (1)  At  the  beginning  of  each  [fourth]  SECOND calendar year,

 the state board shall determine the percentage of the difference between
 the  most  recent  available  monthly consumer price index for all urban

 sion shall be adjusted by the amount of such  percentage  difference  to
 the closest one hundred dollars by the state board which, not later than
 the  first  day  of February in each such year, shall issue a regulation
 publishing the amount of each such contribution limit. Each contribution
 limit as so adjusted shall be the contribution limit in effect  for  any
 election held before the next such adjustment.
  (2)  Provided,  however,  that  such  adjustments  shall not occur for
 candidates seeking statewide office, or the position of state senator or
 member of the assembly, whether such candidate does or does not  partic-
 ipate in the public finance program established pursuant to title two of
 this article.
  f.  Notwithstanding  any  other  contribution  limit  in this section,
 participating candidates as defined in subdivision fourteen  of  section
 14-200-a  of  this article may contribute, out of their own money, three
 times the applicable contribution limit to their own authorized  commit-
 tee.
  § 2. Subdivision 10 of section 14-114 of the election law, as added by
 chapter 79 of the laws of 1992, is amended to read as follows:
  10.  a.  No  contributor may make a contribution to a party or consti-
 tuted committee and no such committee may accept a contribution from any
 contributor which, in the aggregate, is greater than  [sixty-two]  TWEN-
 TY-FIVE thousand [five hundred] dollars per annum.
  b.  At the beginning of each [fourth] SECOND calendar year, commencing
 in [nineteen hundred ninety-five] TWO THOUSAND  TWENTY-FOUR,  the  state
 board  shall determine the percentage of the difference between the most
 recent available monthly consumer price index for  all  urban  consumers
 published  by  the  United  States  bureau  of labor statistics and such
 consumer price index published for  the  same  month  [four]  TWO  years
 previously.  The  amount of such contribution limit fixed in paragraph a
 of this subdivision shall be adjusted by the amount of  such  percentage
 difference  to the closest one hundred dollars by the state board which,
 not later than the first day of February in each such year, shall  issue
 a  regulation  publishing  the  amount  of such contribution limit. Such
 A. 2161  4
 
 contribution limit as so adjusted shall be  the  contribution  limit  in
 effect for any election held before the next such adjustment.
  §  3.  Subdivision 3 of section 14-124 of the election law, as amended
 by section 1 of part B of chapter 286 of the laws of 2016, is amended to
 read as follows:

 to monies received and expenditures made by a party committee or consti-
 tuted committee to maintain a permanent headquarters and staff and carry
 on ordinary activities which are not for the express purpose of  promot-
 ing  the  candidacy  of  specific  candidates; provided that such monies
 described in  this  subdivision  shall  be  deposited  in  a  segregated
 account.  CONTRIBUTIONS MADE FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES TO A PARTY COMMITTEE OR
 CONSTITUTED COMMITTEE SHALL BE LIMITED TO TWENTY-FIVE  THOUSAND  DOLLARS

  § 4. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law; provided, however, that contributions legal-
 ly  received prior to the effective date of this act may be retained and
 expended for lawful purposes and shall  not  provide  the  basis  for  a
 violation of article 14 of the election law, as amended by this act; and
 provided,  further,  that  the state board of elections shall notify all
 candidates and political committees of the applicable provisions of this
 act within thirty days after this act shall have become a law.
