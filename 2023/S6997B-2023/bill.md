 SUBMIT AN ANNUAL APPLICATION WHICH SHALL INCLUDE ALL  QUALIFIED  DIGITAL
 GAMING  MEDIA PRODUCTIONS FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR ALONG WITH AN ESTIMATE OF
 THE DIGITAL GAMING MEDIA PRODUCTION  COSTS.  THE  APPLICATION  SHALL  BE
 SUBMITTED  NO  LATER THAN THE END OF THE APPLICABLE TAXABLE YEAR. If the
 total amount of allocated credits applied for  in  any  particular  year
 exceeds  the aggregate amount of tax credits allowed for such year under
 this section, such excess shall be treated as having been applied for on
 the first day of the subsequent taxable year.

 interactive games produced primarily for distribution over the internet,
 wireless network or successors thereto; and (iii) animation,  simulation

 subparagraphs  (i)  through  (iii)  of  this paragraph must have digital

 thousand  dollars  per  production.  A  qualified  digital  gaming media
 production does not include a website, video, interactive game or  soft-
 ware  that  is  used  predominately  for: electronic commerce (retail or
 wholesale purposes other than the  sale  of  video  interactive  games),
 gambling  (including  activities regulated by a New York gaming agency),
 or political advocacy purposes.
  (2) "Digital gaming media production costs" means any costs for  wages
 or  salaries paid to individuals, other than actors or writers, directly
 employed for  services  performed  by  those  individuals  directly  and
 predominantly  in  the  creation of a digital gaming media production or
 productions. Up to one hundred thousand dollars in  wages  and  salaries
 paid to such employees, other than actors and writers, directly employed
 shall  be  used  in the calculation of this credit. Digital gaming media
 production costs include but  shall  not  be  limited  to  payments  for
 services  performed  directly  and  predominantly  in  the  development
 (including concept  creation),  design,  production  (including  concept
 creation),  design,  production  (including testing), editing (including

 distribution,  marketing, promotion, or advertising content generated by
 end users, other costs not directly and  predominantly  related  to  the

 sixty months of the date the  digital  gaming  media  production  entity
 applied  for  the tax credit certificate described in subdivision (d) of
 this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a  related  person
 shall have the same meaning as the term "related person" in section four
 hundred sixty-five of the internal revenue code. Furthermore, any income
 or  other  distribution to any individual including, but not limited to,
 licensing or royalty fees, who holds an ownership interest in a  digital
 gaming  media production entity, whether or not such individual is serv-
 ing in the role of chief executive  officer,  chief  financial  officer,
 president,  treasurer  or similar position for such an entity, shall not
