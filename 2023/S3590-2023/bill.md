 fits and additional first party benefits shall be made as  the  loss  is
 incurred.  Such  benefits  are  overdue if not paid within thirty days
 after the claimant supplies  proof  of  the  fact  and  amount  of  loss
 sustained.  If  proof is not supplied as to the entire claim, the amount
 which is supported by proof is overdue if not paid  within  thirty  days
 after  such  proof is supplied. All overdue payments shall bear interest
 at the rate of two percent per month. If a valid claim  or  portion  was
 overdue,  the  claimant shall also be entitled to recover his attorney's
 reasonable fee, for services necessarily performed  in  connection  with
 securing payment of the overdue claim, subject to limitations promulgat-
 ed by the superintendent in regulations.
  (2)  THE FAILURE TO ISSUE A DENIAL OF A CLAIM WITHIN THIRTY DAYS SHALL
 NOT PRECLUDE THE INSURER OR SELF-INSURER  FROM  PRESENTING  EVIDENCE  TO
 ESTABLISH  THAT (A) THE SERVICES OR ITEMS BILLED FOR IN A CLAIM WERE NOT
 PROVIDED; (B) CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE CHARGES FOR SERVICES  IN  A  CLAIM

 SECTION  FIVE  THOUSAND  ONE  HUNDRED  EIGHT OF THIS ARTICLE; OR (C) THE
 EVENT FROM WHICH THE CLAIM AROSE WAS BASED UPON AN INTENT TO DEFRAUD  AN

 REVIEW. COPIES OF ALL REPORTS PREPARED BY A  HEALTH  CARE  PROVIDER  WHO

 subsection (a) of this section to  arbitration  pursuant  to  simplified
 procedures  to  be  promulgated  or approved by the superintendent. Such
 simplified procedures shall include  an  expedited  eligibility  hearing
 option, when required, to designate the insurer for first party benefits

 bility hearing option shall be a forum for  eligibility  disputes  only,
 and  shall not include the submission of any particular bill, payment or
 claim for any specific benefit for adjudication, nor shall  it  consider
 any other defense to payment.
  [(c)]  (2) THE COMMENCEMENT OF A COURT PROCEEDING OR THE SUBMISSION OF
 A DISPUTE TO ARBITRATION SHALL NOT PRECLUDE A CLAIMANT FROM ELECTING  TO
 SUBMIT OTHER DISPUTES ARISING FROM THE SAME INSTANCE OF USE OR OPERATION
 OF  A  MOTOR VEHICLE TO THE ALTERNATE FORUM. HOWEVER, WITH THE EXCEPTION
 OF A PROCEEDING BROUGHT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE SEVENTY-FIVE  OF  THE  CIVIL
 PRACTICE  LAW  AND  RULES, A CLAIMANT MAY NOT SUBMIT A DISPUTE REGARDING
 THE SAME DENIAL TO MULTIPLE FORUMS.

 promulgated or approved by the superintendent,  WHICH  SHALL  OFFER  THE
 PARTIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT WRITTEN BRIEFS. The grounds for vacat-
 ing  or modifying an arbitrator's award by a master arbitrator shall not
 be limited to those grounds for review set forth in article seventy-five

 OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AND QUESTION THE WITNESS AT THE DEPOSITION.
  (F)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph two of this subsection, where
 there is reasonable belief more than one insurer would be the source  of
 first  party benefits, the insurers may agree among themselves, if there
 is a valid basis therefor, that one of them  will  accept  and  pay  the
 claim  initially.  If there is no such agreement, then the first insurer
 to whom notice of claim is given shall be responsible for  payment.  Any
 such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the arbitration proce-
 dures  established pursuant to section five thousand one hundred five of
 this article and regulations as promulgated by the  superintendent,  and
 any  insurer  paying  first-party  benefits shall be reimbursed by other
 insurers for their proportionate share of the costs of the claim and the
 allocated expenses of processing  the  claim,  in  accordance  with  the
 S. 3590  4
 
 provisions  entitled  "other  coverage"  contained in regulation and the
 provisions entitled "other sources of first-party benefits" contained in

 occurs  in  this  state,  then an applicant who is a qualified person as
 defined in article fifty-two of this chapter shall institute  the  claim
 against the motor vehicle accident indemnification corporation.
  (2)  A  group  policy  issued  pursuant to section three thousand four
 hundred fifty-five  or  three  thousand  four  hundred  fifty-eight,  AS
 AMENDED  BY  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE OF THE LAWS OF TWO THOUSAND

 dispute  exists  as  to  whether a driver was using or operating a motor
 vehicle in connection with a transportation network company or  peer-to-
 peer  car  sharing program when loss, damage, injury, or death occurs. A
 transportation network  company  or  peer-to-peer  car  sharing  program
 administrator shall notify the insurer that issued the owner's policy of
 liability  insurance of the dispute within ten business days of becoming
 aware that the dispute exists. When there is a dispute, the group insur-
 er liable for the payment of first party benefits under a  group  policy
 shall have the right to recover the amount paid from the driver's insur-
 er  or  in  the  case  of a peer-to-peer car sharing program, the shared
 vehicle owner's insurer to the extent that the driver  would  have  been
 liable to pay damages in an action at law.
