  COMMENDING  Firefighter Roy Boos upon the occasion
  of his designation for special recognition after  50
  years  of  dedicated  service  to the Williston Park
  Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  commend
Firefighter  Roy  Boos  upon the occasion of his designation for special
recognition after 50 years of dedicated service as a member  of  Company
No.  3  with  the Williston Park Fire Department to be celebrated at its
Annual Inspection Dinner on Saturday, April 29, 2023, at the  Milleridge
Inn in Jericho, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Roy  Boos  joined  the  Williston  Park Fire Department on
February 6, 1973; throughout his 50 years of service,  he  held  several
positions  within  the  Department including: President of Company No. 3
(1974-1979), Vice President  (1990),  FASNY  Delegate  (1978-1979),  and
Warden of Company No. 3 (2008-present); and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Roy Boos is  one  such  firefighter;  throughout  50  years  of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Firefighter Roy Boos upon the occasion of  his  designation  for
special recognition after 50 years of dedicated service to the Williston
Park Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Firefighter Roy Boos.
