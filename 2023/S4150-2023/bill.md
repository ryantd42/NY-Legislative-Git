 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation  to  limiting  the

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  and
 declares  that  although  many  illegal guns are obtained outside of New
 York state, existing laws governing gun sellers should  be  strengthened
 to  prevent the diversion of guns to the illegal marketplace. The legis-
 lature finds that it is imperative that additional protections be imple-
 mented to ensure that New York  state  continues  to  lead  the  way  in
 preventing gun violence.
  §  2.  Subdivision  6  of  section 898 of the general business law, as
 added by chapter 1 of the laws of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
  6. A. NO DEALER IN RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS SHALL: (I) SELL MORE  THAN  ONE
 RIFLE  OR  SHOTGUN  TO  ANY  INDIVIDUAL AS PART OF THE SAME SALES TRANS-
 ACTION; OR (II) SELL A RIFLE OR SHOTGUN TO ANY INDIVIDUAL IF THE  DEALER
 KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW THAT SUCH INDIVIDUAL HAS PURCHASED A FIREARM, RIFLE
 OR SHOTGUN WITHIN THE PRIOR NINETY DAYS.
  B.  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE SALE OF
 FIREARMS, RIFLES OR SHOTGUNS TO  A  POLICE  OFFICER,  AS  SUCH  TERM  IS
 DEFINED  IN  SECTION 1.20 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, OR TO A FEDERAL
 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN SECTION 2.15 OF  THE
 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, OR TO A PUBLIC AGENCY IN FURTHERANCE OF OFFICIAL
 BUSINESS.
  7.  Any  person  who knowingly violates the provisions of this article
 shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor punishable as provided  for  in
 the penal law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it  shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation of this act on its effective date are authorized to be  made  and
 completed on or before such effective date.
