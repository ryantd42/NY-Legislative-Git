 AN ACT to amend the penal law, in relation to consent
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 2 of  section  130.05  of  the  penal  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  1 of the laws of 2000, paragraph (c) as amended by
 chapter 264 of the laws of 2003 and paragraph (d) as amended by  chapter
 40 of the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  2.  (A)  CONSENT TO SEXUAL CONTACT IS A KNOWING, VOLUNTARY, AND MUTUAL
 DECISION AMONG ALL PARTICIPANTS.  CONSENT  CAN  BE  GIVEN  BY  WORDS  OR
 ACTIONS,  AS LONG AS THOSE WORDS OR ACTIONS CREATE CLEAR ONGOING PERMIS-
 SION REGARDING WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN THE SEXUAL ACTIVITY.
  (B) Lack of consent results from:
  [(a)] (I) Forcible compulsion, DURESS, COERCION, OR VERBAL  WITHDRAWAL
 OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED CONSENT; or
  [(b)]  (II)  Incapacity to consent, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE VICTIM'S
 OWN ACTIONS RENDERED HIM OR HER INCAPABLE OF CONSENT; or
  [(c)] (III) Where the offense charged  is  sexual  abuse  or  forcible
 touching, any circumstances, in addition to forcible compulsion or inca-
 pacity  to  consent, in which the victim does not expressly or impliedly
 acquiesce in the actor's conduct; or
  [(d)] (IV) Where the offense charged is rape in the  third  degree  as
 defined  in  subdivision three of section 130.25, or criminal sexual act
 in the third degree as defined in subdivision three of  section  130.40,
 in  addition  to  forcible compulsion, circumstances under which, at the
 time of the act of intercourse,  oral  sexual  conduct  or  anal  sexual
 conduct,  the victim clearly expressed that he or she did not consent to
 engage in such act, and a reasonable person  in  the  actor's  situation
 would  have  understood such person's words and acts as an expression of
 lack of consent to such act under all the circumstances.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
