 tutes a crime.

 to a chemical test in the manner set forth in subdivision five  of  this
 section.
  5.  Chemical  tests; when authorized. A police officer may request any
 person who operates a bicycle or bicycle with electric  assist  in  this
 state  to  consent  to  a chemical test of one or more of the following:
 breath, blood, urine, or saliva, for  the  purpose  of  determining  the
 alcoholic and/or drug content of such person's blood, provided that such
 test  is  administered at the direction of a police officer with respect
 to a chemical test of breath, urine or saliva  or,  with  respect  to  a
 chemical test of blood, at the direction of a police officer: (a) having
 reasonable  grounds  to  believe  such  person to have been operating in
 violation of paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of subdivision  one  of
 this  section  and  within  two  hours after such person has been placed
 under arrest for any such violation; or (b) within  two  hours  after  a
 breath  test,  as  provided in paragraph (b) of subdivision four of this
 section, indicates that alcohol has been consumed by such person and  in
 accordance  with  the  rules  and  regulations established by the police
 force of which the officer is a member.
  6. Testing procedures. (a) Persons authorized to withdraw blood; immu-
 nity; testimony. (i) At the request of a police officer,  the  following
 persons  may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic
 or drug content therein: (A)  a  physician,  a  registered  professional
 nurse, a registered physician assistant, a certified nurse practitioner,
 or  an advanced emergency medical technician as certified by the depart-
 ment of health; or (B) under the supervision and at the direction  of  a
 physician, registered physician assistant or certified nurse practition-
 er  acting  within  his  or  her  lawful  scope of practice, or upon the
 express consent of the person eighteen years of age or older  from  whom
 such blood is to be withdrawn: a clinical laboratory technician or clin-
 ical  laboratory  technologist  licensed pursuant to article one hundred
 S. 1374  4
 
 sixty-five of the education law; a phlebotomist; or a medical laboratory
 technician or medical technologist employed  by  a  clinical  laboratory
 approved under title five of article five of the public health law. This
 limitation  shall  not  apply to the taking of a urine, saliva or breath
 specimen.
  (ii) No person entitled to withdraw blood pursuant to subparagraph (i)
 of this paragraph or  hospital  employing  such  person,  and  no  other
 employer of such person shall be sued or held liable for any act done or
 omitted  in  the  course of withdrawing blood at the request of a police
 officer pursuant to this section.
  (iii) Any person who may have a cause of action arising from the with-
 drawal of blood as aforesaid, for which  no  personal  liability  exists
 under  subparagraph  (ii)  of  this  paragraph, may maintain such action
 against the state if any person entitled to withdraw blood  pursuant  to
 this  paragraph acted at the request of a police officer employed by the
 state, or against the appropriate political subdivision of the state  if
 such person acted at the request of a police officer employed by a poli-
 tical  subdivision  of the state. No action shall be maintained pursuant
 to this subparagraph unless notice of claim is duly filed or  served  in
 compliance with law.
  (iv)  Notwithstanding  subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of this para-
 graph, an action may be maintained by the state or a political  subdivi-
 sion  thereof  against  a  person entitled to withdraw blood pursuant to
 subparagraph (i) of this paragraph or hospital employing such person for
 whose act or omission the state or the political  subdivision  has  been
 held  liable  under this paragraph to recover damages, not exceeding the
 amount awarded to the claimant, that may  have  been  sustained  by  the
 state  or the political subdivision by reason of gross negligence or bad
 faith on the part of such person.
  (v) The testimony of any person other than a  physician,  entitled  to
 withdraw  blood  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (i)  of  this paragraph, in
 respect to any such withdrawal of blood  made  by  such  person  may  be
 received  in  evidence with the same weight, force and effect as if such
 withdrawal of blood were made by a physician.
  (vi) The provisions of subparagraphs (ii),  (iii)  and  (iv)  of  this
 paragraph  shall  also  apply  with  regard  to any person employed by a
 hospital as security personnel for any act done or omitted in the course
 of withdrawing blood at the request of a police officer pursuant to this
 section.
  (b) Right to additional test. The person tested shall be permitted  to
 choose  a physician to administer a chemical test in addition to the one
 administered at the direction of the police officer.
  (c) Rules and regulations. The department of health  shall  issue  and
 file  rules and regulations approving satisfactory techniques or methods
 of conducting chemical analyses of a person's blood,  urine,  breath  or
 saliva and to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals
 to  conduct  and supervise chemical analyses of a person's blood, urine,
 breath or saliva. If the analyses were made by an individual  possessing
 a  permit  issued by the department of health, this shall be presumptive
 evidence that the examination was properly given. The provisions of this
 paragraph do not prohibit the introduction as evidence  of  an  analysis
 made  by an individual other than a person possessing a permit issued by
 the department of health.
  7. Chemical test evidence. (a) Admissibility. Upon the  trial  of  any
 such  action  or  proceeding arising out of actions alleged to have been
 committed by any person arrested for a violation  of  any  paragraph  of
 S. 1374  5
 
 subdivision  one  of this section, the court shall admit evidence of the
 amount of alcohol or drugs in the defendant's blood as shown by  a  test
 administered  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of subdivision five of this
 section.
  (b)  Probative  value. The following effect shall be given to evidence
 of blood-alcohol content, as determined  by  such  tests,  of  a  person
 arrested for a violation of subdivision one of this section:
  (i) evidence that there was .05 of one per centum or less by weight of
 alcohol  in  such  person's blood shall be prima facie evidence that the
 ability of such person to operate a BICYCLE  OR  bicycle  with  electric
 assist  was  not  impaired  by the consumption of alcohol, and that such
 person was not in an intoxicated condition;
  (ii) evidence that there was more than .05 of one per centum but  less
 than  .07  of one per centum by weight of alcohol in such person's blood
 shall be prima facie evidence that such person was not in an intoxicated
 condition, but such evidence shall be relevant evidence, but  shall  not
 be  given prima facie effect, in determining whether the ability of such
 person to operate a BICYCLE OR bicycle with electric assist was impaired
 by the consumption of alcohol; and
  (iii) evidence that there was .07 of one per centum or more  but  less
 than  .08  of one per centum by weight of alcohol in such person's blood
 shall be prima facie evidence that such person was not in an intoxicated
 condition, but such evidence shall be given prima facie effect in deter-
 mining whether the ability of such person to operate BICYCLE OR  bicycle
 with electric assist was impaired by the consumption of alcohol.
  8.  Where  applicable. The provisions of this section shall apply upon
 public highways, private roads open to motor vehicle traffic, any  other
 parking  lot,  and  sidewalks. For the purposes of this section "parking
 lot" shall mean any area or  areas  of  private  property,  including  a

 motor  vehicles.  The  provisions of this section shall not apply to any
 area or areas of private property comprising all or part of property  on
 which is situated a one or two-family residence.

 section, no part of this section may be enforced unless  in  conjunction
 with a crash involving an operator of a BICYCLE OR bicycle with electric
 assist.  For  the  purposes  of  this  subdivision, "crash" shall mean
