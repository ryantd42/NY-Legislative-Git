 AN  ACT  to authorize the county of Steuben to offer an optional twenty-
  five year retirement plan to Erica M. McCoy, a deputy sheriff employed
  by such county
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  county  of  Steuben, a participating employer in the New York state
 employees' retirement system, which has elected to  offer  the  optional
 twenty-five  year  retirement plan, established pursuant to article 14-B
 of the retirement and social security law, to deputy  sheriffs  employed
 by  such county, is hereby authorized to make participation in such plan
 available to Erica M. McCoy, a deputy sheriff employed by the county  of
 Steuben  with  a  start  date of September 6, 2016, who, for reasons not
 ascribable to her own negligence, failed to make a timely application to
 participate in such optional twenty-five year plan contained in  article
 14-B  of  the  retirement and social security law. The county of Steuben
 may so elect by filing with the state comptroller, on or before 180 days
 after this act shall have become a law, a resolution  of  its  governing
 body  together  with  certification that such deputy sheriff did not bar
 themself from participation in the retirement plan as a result of  their
 own  negligence.  Thereafter, such deputy sheriff may individually elect
 to be covered by the provisions of section 551  of  the  retirement  and
 social  security law, and shall be entitled to the full rights and bene-
 fits associated with coverage under such section, by  filing  a  request
 with the state within one year of the effective date of this act.

 S. 7071--A  2
 
  §  2. All employer past service costs associated with implementing the
 provisions of this act shall be borne by the county of Steuben  and  may
 be amortized over a five-year period.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  allow  the County of Steuben to elect to reopen the
 provisions of Section 551 of Article 14-B of the Retirement  and  Social
 Security Law for deputy sheriff Erica M. McCoy.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be  an increase of approximately $4,700 in the
 annual contributions of the County of Steuben for the fiscal year ending
 March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the billing rates
 and salary of Erica M. McCoy change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $28,600  which  will  be
 borne  by  the  County  of  Steuben as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2025. If the County  of
 Steuben  elects  to amortize this cost over a five-year period, the cost
 for each year including interest would be $6,390.
