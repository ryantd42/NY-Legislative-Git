the success and progress of society in the course of their life's  work;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its

observance of National Chucks-N-Pearls Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Founded  by  LaTanga Raney in 2021, Chucks-N-Pearls Day is
celebrated on October 28 every year  to  honor  the  simple  but  unique
dressing  style of Kamala Harris, the first female Vice President of the
United States, who is known for wearing converse sneakers  and  a  pearl
necklace to numerous notable events; including her first appearance with
President Joe Biden on a high school stage in Delaware; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Vice  President  Kamala  Harris'  trademark  pearls are an

college-educated women; and
 
  WHEREAS,  AKA  founders  and  incorporators  are  referred to as the
Twenty Pearls, pearls have long been the symbol  of  the  sorority,  and
every new member is given a badge with 20 pearls; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kamala  Harris  has dedicated her career to public service
and is the epitome of the mission of the  AKA,  particularly  to  be  of
service to all mankind; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kamala Harris has become a symbol in her own right, as the
nation's first Black woman and first South  Asian  Vice  president,  she
inspires  women  of  all ages to see themselves in her converse sneakers
and pearls, an inspiration that they  can  overcome  the  challenges  of
sexism and racism when striving for their goals; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Kamala  Harris was born on October 20, 1964, to a Jamaican
father, Donald J. Harris, and an Indian  mother,  Shyamala  Gopalan;  in
2014,  she  married  Doug  Emhoff who today, is proud to be known as the
Second Gentleman of the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Prior to her historic role as Vice President of the  United
States,  Kamala  Harris  served  as the first female Attorney General of
California from 2011-2017, followed by a term  as  Senator  representing
California from 2017-2021; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge and

sensitivity, understanding and inspiration to the diversity  and  values
of  the  people of this great Empire State and to the United States as a
