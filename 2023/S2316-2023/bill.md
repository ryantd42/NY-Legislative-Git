  2. Any municipality may, by local law, provide for  the  exemption  of
 real  property  from  taxation  as  provided  in  this section. Upon the
 adoption of such a local law, the county in which such  municipality  is
 located may, by local law, and any school district, all or part of which
 is located in such municipality, may, by resolution, exempt such proper-
 ty  from  its taxation in the same manner and to the same extent as such
 municipality has done.
  3. Upon the adoption of such a local law, non-residential real proper-
 ty, upon conversion to mixed-use property, shall be exempt from taxation
 and special ad valorem levies as provided for  in  subdivision  four  of
 this  section. LAND WHICH WAS VACANT PRIOR TO THE RESIDENTIAL OR COMMER-
 CIAL CONSTRUCTION WORK FOR WHICH A TAX EXEMPTION IS SOUGHT, SHALL NOT BE
 ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE BENEFITS PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION.
  4. (a) (i) For a period of twelve years from the approval of an appli-
 cation, the increase in assessed value of such property attributable  to
 such conversion shall be exempt as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this
 paragraph.  Such  exemption  shall  be  computed  with  respect  to  the
 "exemption base". The exemption base shall be determined for  each  year
 in  which  there  is  an increase in assessed value so attributable from
 that of the previous year's assessed value.
  (ii) The following table shall illustrate the computation of  the  tax
 exemption:
 
  Year of exemption  Percentage of exemption
 
  1 through 8  100% of exemption base

  11  40% of exemption base
  12  20% of exemption base
 S. 2316  3
 
  (b) No such exemption shall be granted unless:
  (i)  such conversion was commenced subsequent to the date on which the
 municipality's local law took effect; [and]
  (ii) the cost of such conversion  exceeds  the  sum  of  ten  thousand
 dollars or such greater amount as may be specified by local law[.];
  (III) AT LEAST SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE FLOOR AREA OF THE MIXED-USE
 PROPERTY CONSISTS OF THE PRE-EXISTING BUILDING OR STRUCTURE; AND
  (IV)  THE  PORTION  OF  THE  BUILDING  USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES IS
 CURRENTLY, AS DEMONSTRATED BY DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED BY THE  APPLICANT,
 USED AS SUCH OR IS IN GOOD FAITH CONTEMPLATED.
  (c) For purposes of this section the term conversion shall not include
 ordinary maintenance and repairs.
  (d)  No  such exemption shall be granted concurrent with or subsequent
 to any other real property tax exemption granted to  the  same  improve-
 ments to real property, except, where during the period of such previous
 exemption,  payments in lieu of taxes or other payments were made to the
 local government in an amount that would have been equal to  or  greater
 than the amount of real property taxes that would have been paid on such
 improvements  had  such  property  been granted an exemption pursuant to
 this section. In such case, an exemption shall be granted for  a  number
 of  years  equal  to  the twelve year exemption granted pursuant to this
 section less the number of years the property would have been previously
 exempt from real property taxes.
  5. Such exemption shall be granted only upon application by the  owner
 of  such  real  property  on a form prescribed by the commissioner. Such
 application shall be filed with the  assessor  of  the  municipality  or
 county having the power to assess property for taxation on or before the
 appropriate taxable status date of such municipality or county.
  6.  If  the assessor is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to an
 exemption pursuant to this section, he or she shall approve the applica-
 tion and such real property shall be exempt from taxation and special ad
 valorem levies as in this section provided. The assessed  value  of  any
 exemption  granted  pursuant  to  this  section  shall be entered by the
 assessor on the assessment roll with  the  taxable  property,  with  the
 amount of the exemption shown in a separate column.
  7.  (a)  During  the period of exemption pursuant to this section, the
 owner shall submit an annual certification  to  the  assessor  attesting
 that  the  property complies with the provisions or requirements of this
 section and any additional provisions or requirements as may be provided
 by local law. Failure to submit such certification shall result in revo-
 cation of benefits. Such certification shall include at  a  minimum  the
 following:
  (i)  the  types  of  residential  use and the total above-grade square
 footage [and below-grade square footage] of such use;
  (ii) the types of commercial use  and  the  total  above-grade  square
 footage [and below-grade square footage] of such use;
  (iii) attestation that the portion of the building used for commercial
 purposes is currently, as demonstrated by documentation submitted by the
 applicant,  used as such or is in good faith contemplated [to be used as
 such]; AND
  (iv) [the specific address of the entrance through  which  the  public
 enters the portion of the building used for commercial purposes;
  (v)  if the portion of the building intended to be used for commercial
 purposes is not currently in active use for such purposes  and  open  to
 the  public,  the reasons why it is not currently being used for commer-
 cial purposes and open to the public; and
 S. 2316  4

  (vi)] all such other information required by the municipality.
  (b)  If  the  assessor is satisfied that the applicant continues to be
 entitled to the exemption pursuant to this section, the  assessor  shall
 approve the certification and the real property shall remain exempt from
 taxation  and  special ad valorem levies for another year as provided in
 this section.
  8. (a) The benefits of this section shall be revoked upon a finding by
 the assessor that:
  (i) the application for benefits hereunder or the annual certification
 required hereunder contains a false statement or false information as to
 a material matter or omits a material matter; OR
  (ii) the eligible real property fails to comply with one  or  more  of
 the  provisions  or  requirements  of  this section or any provisions or
 requirements provided by local law[; or
  (iii) the portion of the property devoted to commercial  purposes  has
 not  been  in  active use for commercial purposes and open to the public
 for three consecutive years].
  (b) Such revocation shall require the repayment of any benefits previ-
 ously granted pursuant to this section [for any year  during  which  the
 property  was  non-compliant  or the application or annual certification
 contained a false statement or false information as to a material matter
 or omitted a material matter.
  (c) No benefits may be revoked unless the  applicant  has  been  given
 thirty  days'  notice  of  such revocation and has been given reasonable
 notice to cure any failure to comply with the provisions of requirements
 of this section].
  9. If the assessor determines that there was a  material  misstatement
 in  an  application filed by or on behalf of the owners for an exemption
 pursuant to this section and that such misstatement provided  the  basis
 for  the  granting  of such exemption, the municipality shall proceed to
 impose a penalty on the applicant of one thousand dollars in addition to
 recovering the amount of any prior exemption granted.
  § 2. This act shall take effect January 1, 2024  and  shall  apply  to
 properties  for which the initial application for exemption are received
 on and after such date.
