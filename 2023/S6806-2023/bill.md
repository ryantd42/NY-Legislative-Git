 GROUNDS OR ELSEWHERE; OR
  (I) AUTHORIZE OR PERMIT ANY EMPLOYEE OR TRUSTEE OR DIRECTOR THEREOF TO
 ADVERTISE OR MAKE KNOWN HIS OR HER RELATIONSHIP TO SUCH RELIGIOUS CORPO-

 the [previous] FOURTH UNDESIGNATED paragraph OF THIS SECTION shall apply
 to religious corporations with thirty acres or  less  of  real  property
 dedicated to cemetery purposes, and only to the extent the sale or lease
 is  of real property dedicated to cemetery purposes, and such cemeteries
 shall not engage in the sale of funeral home goods or  services,  except
 if  such  goods and services are otherwise permitted to be sold by ceme-
 teries.  No  religious  corporation  shall  approve  or  authorize  the
 construction  of  a  mausoleum  or  columbarium on property owned by the
 religious corporation where such mausoleum or columbarium shall  be  the
 only form of interment offered for cemetery purposes unless a management
 contract  has  been  entered  into with an existing cemetery corporation
 regulated under article fifteen of the not-for-profit  corporation  law,
 that  will provide operational management of the mausoleum or columbari-
 um, and the owner of the mausoleum or columbarium has reserved interment
 space and secured interment services in a cemetery regulated under  this
 article,  in  order  to  assure  continued perpetual care of the remains
 contained in the mausoleum  or  columbarium  should  such  mausoleum  or
 columbarium become abandoned or choose to cease operations.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect on the thirtieth day after it shall
