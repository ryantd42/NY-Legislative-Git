 EXPIRATION  OF  THE  RELEVANT PATENT EXCLUSIVITY OR THAT THE AGREEMENT'S
 PROVISION FOR ENTRY OF THE NONREFERENCE DRUG PRODUCT BEFORE THE  EXPIRA-

  (D)  THAT THE AGREEMENT CAUSED NO HARM OR DELAY DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY
 THAT THE NONREFERENCE DRUG FILER'S  DRUG  PRODUCT  MIGHT  INFRINGE  SOME
 PATENT THAT HAS NOT BEEN ASSERTED AGAINST THE NONREFERENCE DRUG FILER OR
 THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO A FINAL AND BINDING ADJUDICATION ON THAT FILER AS
 TO THE PATENT'S SCOPE, ENFORCEABILITY, AND INFRINGEMENT.
  3.  IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT HAVE MET THEIR
 BURDEN UNDER PARAGRAPH (C) OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION,  A  COURT
 OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION SHALL PRESUME THAT THE RELEVANT PRODUCT MARKET

 PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND THE DRUG PRODUCT OF THE NONREFERENCE DRUG  FILER

 LICENSED AS BIOSIMILAR OR IS AN AB-RATED GENERIC TO THE REFERENCE  PROD-
 UCT.
