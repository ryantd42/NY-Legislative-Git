  c.  [Upon demonstration of compliance, no trustee or member of a board
 of education or a board of cooperative  educational  services  shall  be

 shall be deemed to require trustees or voting  members  of  a  board  of
 education  of  a  school  district or a board of cooperative educational

 if such trustee or member is seated or appointed on or before the effec-
 tive date of the chapter of the laws of two thousand  ten  that  amended
 this subdivision.]
