  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The public service law is amended by adding a  new  section
 66-u to read as follows:
  §  66-U.  ESTABLISHMENT  OF REQUIREMENTS AND PENALTIES FOR COMBINATION
 UTILITY COMPANIES DURING SERVICE OUTAGES. 1. (A)  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL
 HAVE  THE  POWER  TO  ESTABLISH  STANDARDS OF ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE FOR
 COMBINATION UTILITY COMPANIES IN THE EVENT OF A POWER OUTAGE AND  SUBSE-
 QUENT POWER RESTORATION.
  (B)  THE COMMISSION SHALL ALSO PROVIDE FOR A PENALTY IN THE EVENT THAT
 A COMBINATION UTILITY COMPANY IS DETERMINED BY THE  COMMISSION  TO  HAVE
 FAILED  TO REASONABLY COMPLY BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE WITH ANY
 PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER, OR AN ORDER OR REGULATION ADOPTED  UNDER  THE
 AUTHORITY  OF  THIS  CHAPTER, WHICH PROTECTS THE OVERALL RELIABILITY AND
 CONTINUITY OF COMBINATION UTILITY COMPANY SERVICES,  INCLUDING  BUT  NOT
 LIMITED TO RESTORING SERVICE OR OTHERWISE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN
 EMERGENCY SERVICE PLAN FOLLOWING A MAJOR OUTAGE EVENT OR EMERGENCY. SUCH
 PENALTY SHALL BE UP TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VIOLATION OF THIS SECTION
 OR,  FOR A PATTERN OR PRACTICE OF SUCH VIOLATIONS, OF UP TO ONE THOUSAND
 DOLLARS PER VIOLATION.  A  VIOLATION  SHALL  BE  JUDGED  PER  INDIVIDUAL
 ACCOUNT AND SHALL INCLUDE BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS.
  (C)  FOR  THE  PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "COMBINATION UTILITY COMPANY"
 SHALL MEAN A UTILITY COMPANY  THAT  PROVIDES  ELECTRIC,  GAS,  OR  STEAM
 SERVICE IN A CITY WITH A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR MORE.

  2.  THE  COMMISSION  SHALL ESTABLISH A SCHEDULE OF CUSTOMER CREDITS OR
 REBATES, WHICH SHALL BE AWARDED TO  CUSTOMERS  THAT  EXPERIENCE  SERVICE
 OUTAGE CONDITIONS AND FOR MISSED INSTALLATION APPOINTMENTS.
  3. THE COMMISSION IS AUTHORIZED TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION TO REVIEW THE
 PERFORMANCE  OF  ANY COMBINATION UTILITY COMPANY IN RESTORING SERVICE OR
 OTHERWISE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN  DURING
 AN EMERGENCY EVENT. IF, AFTER EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS OR OTHER INVESTIGATO-
 RY PROCEEDINGS, THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THE COMBINATION UTILITY COMPA-
 NY  FAILED  TO  REASONABLY  IMPLEMENT ITS EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN OR THE
 LENGTH OF SUCH COMBINATION UTILITY  COMPANY'S  OUTAGES  WERE  MATERIALLY
 LONGER  THAN  THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN, BECAUSE OF SUCH COMBINATION UTILITY
 COMPANY'S FAILURE TO REASONABLY IMPLEMENT ITS EMERGENCY  RESPONSE  PLAN,
 THE COMMISSION MAY DENY THE RECOVERY OF ANY PART OF THE SERVICE RESTORA-
 TION  COSTS  CAUSED  BY  SUCH  FAILURE, COMMENSURATE WITH THE DEGREE AND
 IMPACT OF THE SERVICE OUTAGE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT  NOTHING  IN  THIS
 SECTION  LIMITS  THE  COMMISSION'S  AUTHORITY  TO  OTHERWISE  COMMENCE A
 PROCEEDING PURSUANT TO SECTIONS  TWENTY-FOUR,  TWENTY-FIVE  AND  TWENTY-
 FIVE-A  OF  THIS CHAPTER, PROVIDED SUCH ACTION OR PENALTY SOLELY RELATES
 TO THE COMBINATION UTILITY COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE UNDER THE  REQUIREMENTS
 OF THE COMBINATION UTILITY COMPANY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN.
  4.  THE  FISCAL  IMPACT  OF  ANY PAYMENT MADE BY A COMBINATION UTILITY
 COMPANY OR THE OFFICERS THEREOF AS A RESULT OF A PENALTY ASSESSED PURSU-
 ANT TO THIS SECTION,  AND  THE  COST  OF  LITIGATION  AND  INVESTIGATION
 RELATED TO ANY SUCH ASSESSMENT SHALL NOT BE BORNE BY CUSTOMERS AND SHALL
 NOT  BE  ADDED  TO  BILLS RENDERED BY THE COMBINATION UTILITY COMPANY TO
 CUSTOMERS.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
