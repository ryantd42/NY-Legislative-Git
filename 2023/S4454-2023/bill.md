 Introduced  by  Sen.  ORTT  --  read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Higher Education
 
 AN ACT to amend the education law, in  relation  to  expedited  teaching
  licensing by certain military spouses
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 3001 of the education law is amended  by  adding  a
 new subdivision 4 to read as follows:
  4. A. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY APPLI-
 CANT  SEEKING TO QUALIFY FOR A LICENSE PURSUANT TO THIS TITLE WHO IS THE
 SPOUSE OF AN ACTIVE DUTY MEMBER  OF  THE  ARMED  FORCES  OF  THE  UNITED
 STATES, NATIONAL GUARD OR RESERVES AS DEFINED IN 10 U.S.C. SECTIONS 1209
 AND  1211,  AND SUCH SPOUSE IS TRANSFERRED BY THE MILITARY TO THIS STATE
 SHALL BE AFFORDED AN EXPEDITED REVIEW OF  HIS  OR  HER  APPLICATION  FOR
 LICENSURE. SUCH APPLICATION SHALL BE ON A FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE DEPART-
 MENT  AND  SHALL INCLUDE AN ATTESTATION BY THE APPLICANT OF THE MILITARY
 STATUS OF HIS OR HER SPOUSE AND ANY OTHER SUCH SUPPORTING  DOCUMENTATION
 THAT  THE  DEPARTMENT  MAY REQUIRE. UPON REVIEW OF SUCH APPLICATION, THE
 DEPARTMENT SHALL ISSUE A LICENSE TO THE APPLICANT IF THE APPLICANT HOLDS
 A LICENSE IN GOOD STANDING IN ANOTHER STATE AND IN THE  OPINION  OF  THE
 DEPARTMENT,  THE  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  LICENSURE  OF  SUCH OTHER STATE ARE
 SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO  THE  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  LICENSURE  IN  THIS
 STATE.
  B.  IN ADDITION TO THE EXPEDITED REVIEW GRANTED IN PARAGRAPH A OF THIS
 SUBDIVISION, AN APPLICANT WHO PROVIDES SATISFACTORY  DOCUMENTATION  THAT
 HE  OR  SHE  HOLDS  A  LICENSE  IN GOOD STANDING FROM ANOTHER STATE, MAY
 REQUEST THE ISSUANCE OF A TEMPORARY PRACTICE PERMIT, WHICH,  IF  GRANTED
 WILL  PERMIT  THE  APPLICANT TO WORK UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A NEW YORK
 STATE LICENSEE IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS OF THE  COMMISSIONER.  THE
 DEPARTMENT  MAY  GRANT  SUCH  TEMPORARY  TEACHING PERMIT WHEN IT APPEARS
 BASED ON THE APPLICATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION RECEIVED THAT  THE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 4454  2
 
 APPLICANT WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSURE IN THIS STATE BECAUSE
 HE  OR  SHE  HOLDS  A  LICENSE  IN GOOD STANDING FROM ANOTHER STATE WITH
 SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARABLE LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE OF THIS  STATE,
 EXCEPT  THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE DIRECT SOURCE VERIFI-
 CATION OF THE  APPLICANT'S  UNDERLYING  CREDENTIALS  (E.G.,  RECEIPT  OF
 ORIGINAL  TRANSCRIPT,  EXPERIENCE  VERIFICATION).  SUCH  PERMIT SHALL BE
 VALID FOR SIX MONTHS OR UNTIL  TEN  DAYS  AFTER  NOTIFICATION  THAT  THE
 APPLICANT  DOES NOT MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR LICENSURE. AN ADDITIONAL
 SIX MONTHS MAY BE GRANTED UPON A DETERMINATION BY  THE  DEPARTMENT  THAT
 THE  APPLICANT  IS EXPECTED TO QUALIFY FOR THE FULL LICENSE UPON RECEIPT
 OF THE REMAINING DIRECT SOURCE VERIFICATION DOCUMENTS REQUESTED  BY  THE
 DEPARTMENT  IN  SUCH  TIME  PERIOD  AND  THAT THE DELAY IN PROVIDING THE
 NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION  FOR  FULL  LICENSURE  WAS  DUE  TO  EXTENUATING
 CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE MILITARY SPOUSE COULD NOT AVOID.
  C. A TEMPORARY TEACHING PERMIT ISSUED UNDER PARAGRAPH B OF THIS SUBDI-
 VISION SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE FULL DISCIPLINARY AND REGULATORY AUTHORI-
 TY  OF  THE BOARD OF REGENTS AND THE DEPARTMENT, PURSUANT TO THIS TITLE,
 AS IF SUCH AUTHORIZATION WERE A PROFESSIONAL LICENSE ISSUED  UNDER  THIS
 ARTICLE.
  D.  THE  DEPARTMENT SHALL REDUCE THE INITIAL LICENSURE APPLICATION FEE
 BY ONE-HALF FOR ANY APPLICATION SUBMITTED BY  A  MILITARY  SPOUSE  UNDER
 THIS SUBDIVISION.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
