gained  the opportunity to come to the United States with a youth group;

  WHEREAS, A truly inspiring individual, Esther  Geizhals  shared  her
story of resilience in the book, We Lived On Miracles, and educated many
in  her  life  about  the tragedies the Jewish people endured during the

  WHEREAS,  Esther  Geizhals  is  survived  by  her  three  children,
Benjamin,  Michael,  and  Jacqueline,  all  of  whom  cherish her loving
