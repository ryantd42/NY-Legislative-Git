 Introduced  by  Sen. SALAZAR -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the  penal  law  and  the  criminal  procedure  law,  in
  relation  to convictions under felony murder provisions; and to repeal
  certain provisions of the penal law relating thereto

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  findings  and intent. The Legislature hereby
 finds and declares the following:
  a. The current provisions of New York's penal law pertaining to felony
 murder eliminate the distinction between intentional  and  unintentional
 homicide  and are therefore not consistent with the principle of propor-
 tionality in charging and sentencing. Felony murder  doctrine  allows  a
 defendant  to be charged and sentenced for murder in circumstances where
 they were committing or attempting to commit a felony but did not  actu-
 ally commit a homicidal act. Under current state law, an accomplice to a
 crime,  for  example  someone driving a getaway car, may be charged with
 murder as if they had actually shot someone in the  course  of  a  crime
 such as robbery even in a circumstance where they were unarmed and phys-
 ically  removed  from the site of the murder. Evidence from other states
 indicates that as  many  as  one  in  five  individuals  serving  prison
 sentences  for  murder  have  been  convicted based on the felony murder
 doctrine.  Studies have also found that prosecutors use  the  threat  of
 felony murder charges to obtain plea deals for lengthy sentences, demon-
 strating  felony  murder  doctrine's role in extreme sentencing and mass
 incarceration.
  b. Felony murder doctrine originated in England but was  banned  there
 in 1957 and subsequently in other Commonwealth countries including Cana-
 da, which banned it in 1990. The United States is an outlier globally in
 its application of felony murder doctrine, although some states, notably
 California  and Colorado, have in the last five years introduced signif-

 icant reforms with California reintroducing the intention to kill  as  a
 requirement  for  the  application  of  felony murder charges. New York,
 however, remains one of just thirteen states including Texas and  Flori-
 da, where the felony murder doctrine is applied by prosecutors to pursue
 murder charges when the individual committing a homicidal act is a third
 party  such as a victim holding their ground, a law enforcement officer,
 or a bystander.  The case of Jagger Freeman  illustrates  how  this  is
 applied.  In  2019,  Freeman, then a 25 year old Queens resident, was an
 accomplice in an attempted robbery  of  a  mobile  phone  store.  Police
 opened  fire in the store on Freeman's associate, who was holding a fake
 gun, killing  one  police  officer  and  wounding  another.  During  the
 episode,  Freeman  had  stood  across the street unarmed, however he was
 sentenced to thirty years to life for the murder of the police officer.
  c. Evidence from across the country reveals that  felony  murder  laws
 have  disproportionately  negative  consequences  for  non-white people,
 young people, and victims of domestic violence. For example, in Pennsyl-
 vania eighty percent of those imprisoned with a felony murder conviction
 were people of color, while in California sixty-eight percent  of  those
 serving  time for felony murder are black or Latinx.  Since 2002, eight-
 y-six percent of all defendants convicted of felony murder in  New  York
 state  have  been black or Latinx. According to the California Coalition
 for Women Prisoners, the majority of their members convicted  of  felony
 murder were victims of domestic violence.
  §  2. Subdivision 3 of section 125.25 of the penal law is REPEALED and
 a new subdivision 3 is added to read as follows:
  3. ACTING EITHER ALONE OR WITH ONE OR MORE OTHER PERSONS,  HE  OR  SHE
 COMMITS OR ATTEMPTS TO COMMIT ROBBERY, BURGLARY, KIDNAPPING, ARSON, RAPE
 IN  THE  FIRST  DEGREE,  CRIMINAL SEXUAL ACT IN THE FIRST DEGREE, SEXUAL
 ABUSE IN THE FIRST DEGREE, AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ABUSE, ESCAPE IN THE  FIRST
 DEGREE,  OR  ESCAPE  IN  THE SECOND DEGREE, AND, IN THE COURSE OF AND IN
 FURTHERANCE OF SUCH CRIME OR OF IMMEDIATE FLIGHT THEREFROM, SUCH PERSON,
 OR ANOTHER PARTICIPANT IN THE UNDERLYING FELONY PERSONALLY AND  DIRECTLY
 CAUSES THE DEATH OF A PERSON OTHER THAN ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS, AND THE
 DEFENDANT  HAS  ONE  OF THE FOLLOWING MENTAL STATES DEPENDENT UPON THEIR
 ROLE IN THE COMMISSION OF THE KILLING: (A) THE DEFENDANT PERSONALLY  AND
 DIRECTLY CAUSED THE DEATH RECKLESSLY; OR (B) THE DEFENDANT WAS AN ACCOM-
 PLICE,  DEFINED  AS ONE WHO SOLICITED, REQUESTED, COMMANDED, IMPORTUNED,
 CAUSED, OR AIDED AND ABETTED THE ACTUAL KILLER IN THE COMMISSION OF  THE
 UNDERLYING FELONY, AND ACTED WITH INTENT TO CAUSE DEATH. LIABILITY UNDER
 THIS  SUBDIVISION SHALL ONLY APPLY TO DEATH CAUSED BY AGENTS AND CO-FEL-
 ONS OF THE DEFENDANT. A DEFENDANT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A DEATH  CAUSED
 BY A THIRD PARTY WHO WAS NOT A PARTICIPANT IN THE UNDERLYING FELONY; OR
  §  3. Subdivision 2 of section 40.00 of the penal law, such section as
 renumbered by chapter 73 of the laws of 1968,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  2. The defense of duress as defined in subdivision one of this section
 is  not  available  when  a  person  intentionally  or recklessly places
 himself OR HERSELF in a situation in which it is probable that he OR SHE
 will be subjected to duress; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,  THAT  THIS  SUBDIVISION
 SHALL  NOT  APPLY  TO  PROSECUTIONS  BROUGHT  UNDER SUBDIVISION THREE OF
 SECTION 125.25 OF THIS CHAPTER WHEN THE  DEFENDANT  HAS  BEEN  OR  IS  A
 VICTIM  OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE
 UNDERLYING FELONY.
  § 4. The criminal procedure law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 440.48 to read as follows:
