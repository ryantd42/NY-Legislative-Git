 Introduced  by  Sen.  PARKER -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Mental Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the mental hygiene law, in relation to establishing  the
  division of minority mental health within the office of mental health,
  and providing for its powers and duties

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative  intent.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  that
 racial  and  ethnic  minorities  in  America  comprise a substantial and
 vibrant segment of the United States population. According to  the  2000
 United  States Census, minorities comprised the majority of the New York
 City population. Further, the legislature finds that nearly half of  all
 New  York  City  households speak a language other than English at home,
 and that the "enormous shortage  of  trained  bilingual  and  bicultural
 counselors, therapists, psychiatrists and social workers, make it impos-
 sible,  for many limited-English-proficient New Yorkers to obtain refer-
 rals and timely, appropriate mental health  services"  (New  York  State
 Assembly  Standing  Committee  on Mental Health report, AN EVALUATION OF
 THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HYGIENE SERVICES  IN  NEW  YORK  STATE,  February
 2005).  Moreover, the legislature finds that the President's New Freedom
 Commission on Mental Health also found that the mental health system  in
 the  United  States  "has not kept pace with the diverse needs of racial
 and ethnic minorities.  Misunderstanding and  misinterpreting  behaviors
 have  led  to  tragic  consequences,  including  inappropriately placing
 minorities in the criminal and juvenile justice systems."  Consequently,
 the  legislature  finds that a division of minority mental health should
 be created to address the unique mental health needs of the  racial  and
 ethnic minority citizens of the state.
