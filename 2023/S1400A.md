 AN ACT to amend the environmental conservation law, in relation to false
  claims about recyclability and plastic container labelling
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  Legislature finds and declares that it is the public
 policy of the state that environmental marketing claims, whether explic-
 it or  implied,  should  be  substantiated  by  competent  and  reliable
 evidence to prevent deceiving or misleading consumers about the environ-
 mental  impact  of  plastic products. For consumers to have accurate and
 useful information about the environmental impact of  plastic  products,
 environmental  marketing  claims should adhere to uniform and recognized
 standards.
  The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the public poli-
 cy of the state that claims related to the recyclability  of  a  plastic
 product be truthful in practice and accurate. Consumers deserve accurate
 and useful information related to how to properly handle the end of life
 of a plastic product.
  §  2.  The environmental conservation law is amended by adding two new
 sections 27-0111 and 27-0113 to read as follows:
 § 27-0111. RECYCLING TRUTH IN LABELING.
  1. IT IS DECEPTIVE TO MISREPRESENT, DIRECTLY OR BY IMPLICATION, THAT A
 PRODUCT OR PACKAGE IS RECYCLABLE UNLESS IT CAN BE COLLECTED,  SEPARATED,
 OR  OTHERWISE  RECOVERED  FROM  THE  WASTE STREAM THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED
 MECHANICAL OR MANUAL RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR REUSE OR USE IN MANUFACTURING
 OR ASSEMBLING ANOTHER ITEM.  FOR SUCH PURPOSES, THE  USE  OF  A  CHASING
