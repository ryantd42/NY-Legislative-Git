 § 27-1417. [Citizen] COMMUNITY participation.
  1. [Citizen] COMMUNITY participation handbook. The commissioner  shall
 prepare  a [citizen] COMMUNITY participation handbook for the purpose of
 providing guidance to applicants in the  design  and  implementation  of
 meaningful  [citizen]  COMMUNITY participation plans consistent with the
 requirements of this section for the remediation of brownfield sites  as
 provided in this title. Such handbook shall encourage [citizen] COMMUNI-
 TY  involvement  by  outlining opportunities and recommended methods for
 effective [citizen] COMMUNITY participation, INCLUDING THE  AVAILABILITY
 OF  TECHNICAL  ASSISTANCE GRANTS. The commissioner shall make such hand-
 book available to all applicants and other  interested  members  of  the
 public  upon  request  and  shall  make it available on the department's
 website.
  2. [Citizen] COMMUNITY participation plans.  (a)  The  design  of  any
 [citizen] COMMUNITY participation plan, including the level of [citizen]
 COMMUNITY  involvement  and  the tools utilized, shall take into account
 the scope and scale of the proposed remedial program, local interest and
 history, and other relevant factors. While retaining flexibility, [citi-
 zen] COMMUNITY participation plans shall embody the following principles
 of meaningful [citizen] COMMUNITY participation:
  (1)  opportunities  for  [citizen]  COMMUNITY  involvement  should  be
 provided  as  early  as possible in the decision making process prior to
 A. 7396--B  3
 
 the selection of a preferred course of action by the  department  and/or
 the applicant.
  (2)  activities  proposed  in such plan should be as reflective of the
 diversity of interests and perspective found  within  the  community  as
 possible,  allowing the public the opportunity to have their views heard
 and considered, which may include opportunities for two-way dialogue.
  (3) full, timely, and accessible disclosure and sharing of information
 by the department shall be provided, including the provision of  techni-
 cal data and the assumptions upon which the analyses are based.
  (b)  All  [citizen]  COMMUNITY  participation  plans shall include the
 following minimum elements:
  (1) identification of the  interested  public  and  preparation  of  a
 brownfield site contact list;
  (2)  identification  of  major issues of public concern related to the
 brownfield site;
  (3) a description and  schedule  of  public  participation  activities
 required pursuant to this section; and
  (4)  a description and schedule of any additional public participation
 activities needed to address public concerns.
  3. [Citizen] COMMUNITY participation requirements. (a) In addition  to
 the  formal  milestones listed below, the public may provide comments at
 any time during the remedial program.
  (b) The person submitting a request for participation, in  cooperation
 with  the  department,  shall provide a newspaper notice of the person's
 request to participate in the program. The person, in  cooperation  with
 the department, shall also provide notice thereof to the brownfield site
 contact  list. Such notice shall provide for a thirty day public comment
 period following publication.
  (c) Before the department finalizes the remedial  investigation  work-
 plan,  the  applicant,  in  cooperation with the department, must notify
 individuals on the brownfield  site  contact  list.  Such  notice  shall
 include  a  fact sheet describing such plan and provide for a thirty day
 public comment period.
  (d) Before the department approves a proposed  remedial  investigation
 report, the department, in consultation with the applicant, shall notify
 individuals  on  the  brownfield  site  contact  list. Such notice shall
 include a fact sheet describing such report.
  (e) Upon the department's determination of significant threat pursuant
 to section 27-1411 of this title, the department must provide notice  to
 individuals  on  the  brownfield  site  contact  list. Such notice shall
 include a fact sheet describing the basis of the  department's  determi-
 nation.
  (f)  Before  the department finalizes a proposed remedial work plan or
 makes a determination that site conditions meet the requirements of this
 title without the necessity for remediation pursuant to section  27-1411
 of  this title, the department, in consultation with the applicant, must
 notify individuals on the brownfield  site  contact  list.  Such  notice
 shall  include  a  fact  sheet  describing  such  plan and provide for a
 forty-five day public comment period.  The  commissioner  shall  hold  a
 public  meeting  if  requested by the affected community and the commis-
 sioner has found that the site constitutes a significant threat  to  the
 public  health  or  the environment. Further, the affected community may
 request a public meeting at sites that do not constitute  a  significant
 threat.  (1)  To the extent that the department has determined that site
 conditions do not pose a  significant  threat  and  the  site  is  being
 addressed by a volunteer, the notice shall state that the department has
 A. 7396--B  4
 
 determined  that  no  remediation is required for the off-site areas and
 that the department's determination of a significant threat  is  subject
 to  this  forty-five  day  comment period. (2) If the remedial work plan
 includes  a  Track  2,  Track  3  or Track 4 remedy at a non-significant
 threat site, such comment period shall apply both to the approval of the
 alternatives analysis by the department and the proposed remedy selected
 by the applicant.
  (g) Before the applicant  commences  construction  at  the  brownfield
 site,  the  applicant, in cooperation with the department, shall provide
 notice to the individuals on the brownfield site contact list.
  (h) Before  the  department  approves  a  proposed  final  engineering
 report,  the department, in consultation with the applicant, must notify
 individuals on such contact list. Such notice shall include a fact sheet
 describing the brownfield site report, including any  proposed  institu-
 tional or engineering controls.
  (i)  Within ten days of the issuance of a certificate of completion at
 a site which will utilize institutional  or  engineering  controls,  the
 applicant,  in  cooperation with the department, shall provide notice to
 the brownfield site contact list. Such notice shall include a fact sheet
 describing such controls.
  4. Technical assistance grants.  (a) Within the  limits  of  appropri-
 ations made available pursuant to paragraph [j] (J) of subdivision three
 of  section ninety-seven-b of the state finance law, the commissioner is
 authorized to provide grants to THE NEW YORK CITY COMMUNITY BOARD, WHICH
 SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS SET FORTH IN SECTION TWENTY-EIGHT HUNDRED
 OF THE NEW YORK CITY CHARTER, IN WHICH THE SITE IS  LOCATED  OR  TO  any
 not-for-profit  corporation exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3)
 of the internal revenue code at any site determined to  pose  a  signif-
 icant threat by the department and which may be affected by a brownfield
 site remedial program. To qualify to receive such assistance, a communi-
 ty  group  must demonstrate that its membership represents the interests
 of the community affected by such site. Furthermore, the commissioner is
 authorized to direct any  applicant  who  is  a  responsible  party,  as
 defined in section 27-1313 of this article, to provide such grants. Such
 grants  shall be known as technical assistance grants and may be used to
 obtain technical assistance in interpreting information with  regard  to
 the  nature of the hazard posed by contamination located AT or emanating
 from a brownfield site or sites and the development  and  implementation
 of  a brownfield site remedial program or programs. Such grants may also
 be used to hire health and safety experts to advise  affected  residents
 on  any  health assessments and for the education of interested affected
 community members to enable them to more effectively participate in  the
 remedy  selection  process. Grants awarded under this section may not be
 used for the purposes  of  collecting  field  sampling  data,  political
 activity or lobbying legislative bodies.
  (b)  The amount of any grant awarded under this section may not exceed
 fifty thousand dollars at any one site.
  (c) No  matching  contribution  from  the  grant  recipient  shall  be
 required  for  a  technical assistance grant. Following a grant award, a
 portion of the grant shall be made available to the grant recipient,  in
 advance of the expenditures to be covered by the grant, in five thousand
 dollar installments.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the first of February next succeed-
 ing  the  date  upon which it shall have become a law and shall apply to
 any applications received on or after such date.
