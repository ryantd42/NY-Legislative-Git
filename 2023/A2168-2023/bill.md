 assigned  to  represent  the  sex  offender upon the ground that the sex
 offender is financially unable to retain counsel, that assignment  shall
 be  continued  throughout the pendency of the appeal, and the person may
 appeal as a poor person pursuant to article  eighteen-B  of  the  county
 law.
