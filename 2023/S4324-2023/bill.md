 and probation as provided for in paragraph (d)  of  subdivision  two  of
 this  section.  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  WHERE A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN

 tive of whether such fact is specified as a condition of  the  sentence.
 CONVICTION  OF A SUBSEQUENT FELONY OR OF AN OFFENSE IN ANOTHER JURISDIC-
 TION WHICH IF COMMITTED IN THIS STATE WOULD CONSTITUTE A  FELONY,  WHILE

 tion  of  the sentence OR (B) THE DEFENDANT WHILE UNDER PROBATION SUPER-
 VISION IMPOSED UPON CONVICTION OF A  FELONY  HAS  BEEN  CONVICTED  OF  A
 SUBSEQUENT FELONY, OR IS CONVICTED OF AN OFFENSE IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION
 WHICH  IF  COMMITTED  IN THIS STATE WOULD CONSTITUTE A FELONY, and [(b)]
 (C) the defendant has had an opportunity to be heard  pursuant  to  this
 section.  The defendant is entitled to a hearing in accordance with this
 section promptly after the court has filed a declaration of  delinquency
 or has committed him OR HER or has fixed bail pursuant to this article.

 a period of conditional discharge for an offense, EXCEPT THAT CONVICTION

 TION  WHICH  IF COMMITTED IN THIS STATE WOULD CONSTITUTE A FELONY, WHICH
 SUBSEQUENT FELONY IS COMMITTED WHILE UNDER HIS OR HER PRESENT  PROBATION
 SUPERVISION  FOR  A  FELONY  OFFENSE,  SHALL  RESULT  IN  REVOCATION  OF
 PROBATION UPON IMPOSITION OF AN INDETERMINATE  OR  DETERMINATE  SENTENCE
