 Introduced  by M. of A. GUNTHER -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Banks
 
 AN ACT to amend the banking law and the civil practice law and rules, in
  relation to licensed consumer debt collectors
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature hereby finds the
 presence  of consumer-related problems with respect to the practices  of
 debt  collection  agencies.  Federal  and  state  laws regulate how debt
 collectors may communicate with debtors and prohibit the use of  certain
 threatening,  deceptive  and  unfair collection  practices.  Despite
 these  legal  protections,  there  continue  to  be  frequent  consumer
 complaints regarding debt collection practices.  Due  to  the  sensitive
 nature  of  the  information used in the course of debt collection agen-
 cies' work, and the vulnerable position consumers may find themselves in
 when dealing with these agencies, it is incumbent upon this  legislature
 to ensure that agencies that engage in unscrupulous or abusive practices
 shall  not  continue to operate in this state. To protect the interests,
 reputations, and financial wellbeing of residents  of  this  state  from
 unwarranted  harm, the legislature hereby declares that the state should
 not permit debt collection agencies to operate without  a  license  from
 the state.
  §  2.  The banking law is amended by adding a new article 7 to read as
 follows:
  ARTICLE 7
  LICENSED CONSUMER DEBT COLLECTORS
 SECTION 295. DEFINITIONS.
  296. DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES.
  297. SURETY BONDING REQUIREMENT.
  298. PENALTIES.
  299. EXAMINATIONS.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
