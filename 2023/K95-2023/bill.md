  WHEREAS, Timothy L. Barnett, as the first Executive Director of  the

tenure; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Timothy  Lincoln  Barnett  was born in 1940, to Hildegarde

Stockbridge School, followed by Middlebury College; and

1972, the couple moved to the Adirondacks where he was invited to  serve
as  the  founding  Executive  Director  of the Adirondack Chapter of The
Nature  Conservancy,  an  entity  recommended  by  the  Temporary  Study
Commission  on  the  Future  of  the  Adirondacks  appointed by New York
Governor Nelson Rockefeller; and
 
  WHEREAS, In his wonderfully engaging and congenial way,  Timothy  L.

incredible, six-million-acre Adirondack Park; and
 
  WHEREAS, After a 1997 horseback accident left him paralyzed, Timothy
L.  Barnett  continued  undaunted,  to  help  develop  Tim's  Trail,  a

Conservancy's  Willsboro  preserve,  which  further increased our public
land's accessibility, use and visitation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Timothy L. Barnett, who never took no for an answer,  found
the  good  in  everyone  and  always gave credit to others, successfully
conserving hundreds of thousands of acres, not to keep people  out,  but
 
to  ensure  the continued protection of the Adirondack Park's recreation
and biodiverse wildlife species; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Timothy  L.  Barnett  is  survived  by his wife, Elizabeth
Claire  Lillis;  two  sons,  Ian  Kinnear  and  Edward  MacInnes;  six
