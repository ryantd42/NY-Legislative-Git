 For  purposes  of  this  paragraph, the term "member" shall include each
 person who during the qualifying period  was  in  the  employment  of  a
 public  employer  which then participated for such employees in a public
 retirement system in this state, irrespective of whether the person  was
 a  participant in such system at that time, provided that the person has
 become a participant in such retirement system and has purchased service
 credit for a period of time that includes some or all of the  qualifying
 period  in accordance with provisions of law applicable to such purchase
 of service credit.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  be  deemed  to
 have been in full force and effect on and after September 11, 2001.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would expand the definition of a member who participated in
 World Trade Center (WTC)  rescue,  recovery  or  cleanup  operations  to
 include those who worked at the Verrazano Bridge Toll Facility.
  Insofar as this bill would affect the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees' Retirement System (NYSLERS) and the New York State and Local Police
 and  Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), if this bill is enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, it would (a)  reclassify  certain  retiree
 benefits  as  accidental  disability, (b) lead to an increased number of
 accidental disability benefits for future retirees, and (c) also lead to
 more deaths being classified as "accidental". The cost  of  the  revised
 benefit  will depend upon the applicant's age, service, salary, plan and
 benefit type otherwise payable.

 NYSLERS cost for  10 times  5.5 times  3 times
 proposed benefit:  salary  salary  salary
 
 NYSLPFRS cost for  10 times  5.5 times  3 times

 Benefit prior  Service  Ordinary
 to enactment:  Retirement  Death
 
 NYSLERS cost for  2 times  4.5 times
 proposed benefit:  salary  salary
 
 NYSLPFRS cost for  2 times  13 times
 proposed benefit:  salary  salary
 
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this  legislation  cannot  be  readily  determined.
 Pursuant  to  Section  25 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, the
 costs arising in the NYSLERS will be borne entirely by the State of  New
 York  and  will  require an itemized appropriation sufficient to pay the
 cost of the provision. The costs arising in the NYSLPFRS will be  shared
 by  the  State  of New York and the local participating employers of the
 NYSLPFRS.
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.

  CENSUS DATA: The number of members and eligible retirees who worked at
 the  Verrazano bridge during the applicable period is unknown. The esti-
 mates presented herein are based on preliminary census data collected as
 of June 30, 2023. The census data for  the  potentially  impacted  popu-
 lation used to develop the average costs in this Fiscal Note is based on
 TBTA  members  active  during  the  applicable  period and is summarized
 below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members
  - Number Count:  220
  - Average Age:  56.0
  - Average Service:  25.1
  - Average Salary:  119,300

  - Number Count:  31
  - Average Age:  58.0

  Receiving Members
  - Number Count:  902
  - Average Age:  68.2
 
  IMPACT  ON  MEMBER  BENEFITS: Currently, a member who becomes disabled
 would be eligible for  an  applicable  ordinary  disability  retirement,
 generally  a  lifetime  payment  of  1/3 of salary or service benefit if
 greater. The ordinary death benefit is  a  lump  sum  payment  generally
 equal  to  three times the member's salary for active members or a frac-
 tion of the retirement benefit for retirees.
  Under the proposed legislation, the  accidental  death  benefit  would
 generally  be  equal  to  a  lifetime  benefit of 50%, or 100% for those
 eligible for Special Accidental Death  Benefits,  of  a  member's  wages
 earned during the last year of service.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of NYCERS.
  The  cost of this proposed legislation could vary greatly depending on
 the number of future members who benefit and on their length of service,
 age, and salary history.
  The estimated financial impact for disabled members  has  been  calcu-
 lated assuming 50% would have retired under an Ordinary Disability bene-
 fit,  and  50%  would have continued working if the proposed legislation
 were not passed.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population and other factors  such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
  STATEMENT OF ACTUARIAL OPINION: Marek Tyszkiewicz and Gregory Zelikov-
 sky are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy  of
 Actuaries.  We  are  members of NYCERS but do not believe it impairs our
 objectivity and we meet the  Qualification  Standards  of  the  American
 Academy  of  Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
 To the best of our knowledge, the results  contained  herein  have  been
 prepared  in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and
 procedures and with the Actuarial Standards of Practice  issued  by  the
 Actuarial Standards Board.

 2024 was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City  Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
 the 2024 Legislative Session.
