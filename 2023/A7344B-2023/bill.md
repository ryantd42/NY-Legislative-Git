 For  purposes  of  this  paragraph, the term "member" shall include each
 person who during the qualifying period  was  in  the  employment  of  a
 public  employer  which then participated for such employees in a public
 retirement system in this state, irrespective of whether the person  was
 a  participant in such system at that time, provided that the person has
 become a participant in such retirement system and has purchased service
 credit for a period of time that includes some or all of the  qualifying
 period  in accordance with provisions of law applicable to such purchase
 of service credit.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  be  deemed  to
 have been in full force and effect on and after September 11, 2001.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would expand the definition of a member who participated in
 World Trade Center (WTC)  rescue,  recovery  or  cleanup  operations  to
 include those who worked at the Verrazano Bridge Toll Facility.
  Insofar as this bill would affect the New York State and Local Employ-
 ees' Retirement System (NYSLERS) and the New York State and Local Police
 and  Fire  Retirement  System (NYSLPFRS), if this bill is enacted during
 the 2024 Legislative Session, it would (a)  reclassify  certain  retiree
 benefits  as  accidental  disability, (b) lead to an increased number of
 accidental disability benefits for future retirees, and (c) also lead to
 more deaths being classified as "accidental". The cost  of  the  revised
 benefit  will depend upon the applicant's age, service, salary, plan and
 benefit type otherwise payable.

 NYSLERS cost for  2 times  4.5 times
 proposed benefit:  salary  salary
 
 NYSLPFRS cost for  2 times  13 times
 proposed benefit:  salary  salary
 
  The  exact  number  of  current  members as well as future members who
 could be affected by this  legislation  cannot  be  readily  determined.
 Pursuant  to  Section  25 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, the
 costs arising in the NYSLERS will be borne entirely by the State of  New
 York  and  will  require an itemized appropriation sufficient to pay the
 cost of the provision. The costs arising in the NYSLPFRS will be  shared
 by  the  State  of New York and the local participating employers of the
 NYSLPFRS.
  Further, we anticipate additional administrative  costs  to  implement
 the provisions of this legislation.
