  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Hochul to proclaim August
  6, 2023, as Jamaican Flag Day in the  State  of  New
  York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body, in keeping with
its time-honored traditions, to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  those
organizations  which  foster  ethnic  pride  and  enhance the profile of
cultural diversity which strengthens the fabric of  the  communities  of
New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  6,  2023, as
Jamaican Flag Day in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Jamaican Flag Day celebrates the rich  culture  of  Jamaica
and  its people, including the history, language, arts, food, music, and
traditions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  purpose  of  the  day  is  to  raise  awareness  and
understanding  about  Jamaican  culture,  celebrate  the independence of
Jamaica, and to strengthen the pride of Jamaicans  and  Jamaican  youth;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  August  6,  1962,  marks  the  date  Jamaica  received its
independence; 2023 marks the 61st year of independence; and
 
  WHEREAS, Between 1881 and the beginning of World War I,  the  United
States  recruited  over  90,000  Jamaicans  to work on the Panama Canal;
during both World Wars, the United States again recruited  Jamaican  men
for service; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over 500,000 Jamaicans reside in New York, making Jamaicans
one of the largest Caribbean groups residing in the State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Jamaicans  in  New York have contributed enormously to the
vitalization and growth of the State, with  small  businesses,  cultural
parades,  careers  in  the fields of healthcare, law, government, sports
and education, with icons such as Harry Belafonte, Vice President Kamala
Harris, General Colin Powell, former NY Assembly Member and Current U.S.
Ambassador to Jamaica, Nick  Perry,  Former  Basketball  Player  Patrick
Ewing,  Boxer  Mike  Tyson,  Singer  Bob  Marley,  and  many  more; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  August  6,  2023, as
Jamaican Flag Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to the Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and various Jamaican organizations across the State.
