  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Section  15-130 of the election law is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 15-130. Election of trustees by wards.  The  board  of  trustees  of
 [any]  EVERY  village  [may,  by  resolution, and subject to a mandatory
 referendum,] SHALL provide for the election of  trustees  by  wards,  OR
 alter  [existing]  ward boundaries [or abolish wards and the election of
 trustees by wards]. [If a village elects  trustees  by  wards  separate]
 SEPARATE  ballot  boxes  or  voting  machines shall be provided for each
 ward.
  § 2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 2 of section 81 of the town  law  is
 REPEALED.
  § 3. Section 85 of the town law, as amended by chapter 513 of the laws
 of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  §  85.  Ward  system  for  election of council members. [1. Whenever a

 council member from each ward, the] THE board of elections of the county
 in  which [such] A town is situate shall divide the town into four wards
 and fix the boundaries thereof, unless a  proposition  shall  have  been
 adopted  to  increase the number of council members from four to six, in
 which instance, the board of elections shall divide the  town  into  six
 wards  and  fix  the  boundaries  thereof.  In so dividing the town into
 wards, no town election  district  shall  be  divided  and  no  election
 district  thereafter  created under the election law shall contain parts
 of two or more wards. So far as possible the division shall be  so  made
 that  the  number  of  voters in each ward shall be approximately equal.
 When the board of elections shall have finally determined the boundaries
 of the wards, they shall cause a map of the town to be prepared  showing
 in  detail  the  location  of  each ward and the boundaries thereof. The
 original map so made shall be filed in the office of the town clerk  and
 copies thereof shall be filed in the offices of the county clerk and the
 board of elections of the county. The ward system shall be deemed estab-
 lished  after  such  filing  is complete. After a ward system shall have
 been so established, the term of office of  every  town  council  member
 shall  terminate on the thirty-first day of December next succeeding the
 first biennial town election held not less than one hundred twenty  days
 after  the  establishment of such ward system, and at such biennial town
 election, and every biennial  town  election  thereafter,  one  resident
 elector  of each ward shall be elected as council member therefrom for a
 term of two years beginning on the first day of January next  succeeding
 such election.
  [2.  The  ward system may be abolished upon the adoption of a proposi-
 tion therefor at any special or biennial town  election.  At  the  first
 biennial  town  election held at least one hundred twenty days after the
 adoption of a proposition to abolish the ward  system  for  election  of
 council  members,  the  electors of the town shall elect one-half of the
 total number of town council members for the term of two years each  and
 one-half  of  the  total  number of town council members for the term of
 four years each. At each biennial town election  held  thereafter  there
 shall  be  elected  one-half of the total number of town council members
 for the term of four years each. The terms of all such  council  members
 shall  begin  on  the  first  day of January next succeeding the date of
 their election.]
  § 4. Section 87 of the town law, as amended by chapter 513 of the laws
 of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  § 87. Increase [or decrease] of number of council members. [1.]  When-
 ever a proposition shall have been adopted in a town [of the first class
 which  shall  not  have  established  the  ward system,] to increase the
 number of council members from four to six, party nominations  for  town
 council  members  may  be  made and designating petitions filed and four
 town council members  shall  be  elected  at  the  first  biennial  town
 election  held  at  least one hundred fifty days thereafter, three for a
 term of four years each and one for a term of two years  and  thereafter
 at each biennial town election in such town there shall be elected three
 town council members for the term of four years each, in the same manner
 as other elective town officers in such town. The term of office of each
 such  council  member  shall  begin  on  the  first  day of January next
 succeeding the election at which they were elected.
  [2. Whenever a proposition shall have been adopted in a  town  of  the
 first  class  which  shall  not  have  established  the  ward system, to
 increase the number of council members from two  to  four,  party  nomi-
 nations  for  town council members may be made and designating petitions
 A. 532  3

 filed and three town council members shall be elected at the first bien-
 nial town election held at least one hundred fifty days thereafter,  two
 for terms of four years each and one for a term of two years, and there-
 after  at  each  biennial  town  election  in  such town, there shall be
 elected two town council members for terms of four years  each,  in  the
 same  manner  as  other elective town officers in such town. The term of
 office of each such town council member shall begin on the first day  of
 January next succeeding the election at which they were elected.
  3.  Whenever  a  proposition  shall have been adopted in a town of the
 first class to reduce the number of council members from four to two, no
 town council members  shall  be  elected  at  the  first  biennial  town
 election held at least one hundred fifty days after the adoption of such
 proposition.  Party nominations for town council members may be made and
 designating petitions filed  and  two  town  council  members  shall  be
 elected  at the biennial town election next succeeding the biennial town
 election at which no town council members are elected, one for a term of
 two years and one for a term of four years and thereafter at each  bien-
 nial  town election in such town there shall be elected one town council
 member for a term of four years, in the same manner  as  other  elective
 town  officers  in  such  town.  The term of office of each such council
 member shall begin on the first  day  of  January  next  succeeding  the
 election at which they were elected.]
