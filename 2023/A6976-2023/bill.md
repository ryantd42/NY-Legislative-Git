 Introduced  by  M.  of A. PHEFFER AMATO -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the penal law, in relation to the  crime  of  aggravated
  harassment of an employee by an inmate
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 4 of section 70.00 of the penal law, as amended
 by chapter 738 of the laws of 2004, is amended to read as follows:
  4. Alternative definite sentence for class D and E  felonies.  When  a
 person,  other than a second or persistent felony offender, is sentenced
 for a class D or class E felony, EXCEPT FOR THE CLASS E FELONY OF AGGRA-
 VATED HARASSMENT OF AN EMPLOYEE BY AN  INMATE,  AS  DEFINED  IN  SECTION
 240.32  OF  THIS CHAPTER, and the court, having regard to the nature and
 circumstances of the crime and to  the  history  and  character  of  the
 defendant,  is  of the opinion that a sentence of imprisonment is neces-
 sary but that it would be unduly harsh to  impose  an  indeterminate  or
 determinate sentence, the court may impose a definite sentence of impri-
 sonment and fix a term of one year or less.
  §  2.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision 5 of section 70.25 of the
 penal law, as amended by chapter 3 of the laws of 1995, are  amended  to
 read as follows:
  (a)  Except  as  provided in paragraph (c) of this subdivision, when a
 person is convicted of assault in  the  second  degree,  as  defined  in
 subdivision  seven  of  section  120.05  of  this chapter, OR AGGRAVATED
 HARASSMENT OF AN EMPLOYEE BY AN INMATE AS DEFINED IN SECTION  240.32  OF
 THIS  CHAPTER, any definite, indeterminate or determinate term of impri-
 sonment which may be imposed as a sentence upon  such  conviction  shall
 run  consecutively to any undischarged term of imprisonment to which the
 defendant was subject and for which he was confined at the time  of  the
 assault.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 detention facility at the time of the assault upon a charge which culmi-

 date the provisions of section three of this act shall take effect.
