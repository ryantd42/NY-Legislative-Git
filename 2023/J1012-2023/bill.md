  of  the  Honorable  Medgar  Evers,  Civil  Rights
  Advocate, on June 12, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize and
pay tribute to those individuals who selflessly devoted themselves to  a
higher  purpose  of  promoting  positive  change  in  society,  who
distinguished themselves through professional excellence, and  who  made
significant  contributions  to  the  quality  of life of citizens in the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the passing of the Honorable  Medgar
Evers on Monday, June 12, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1925, Medgar Evers was born in Decatur, Mississippi to
James and Jessie Evers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Serving valiantly overseas,  Medgar  Evers  fought  in  the
Battle  of  Normandy  and faced racism upon returning home from the war;
this experience sparked his journey as a Civil Rights Advocate; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Throughout  his  illustrious  life,  Medgar  Evers  became
president of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL); as head of
the organization, he mounted a boycott of gas stations that barred Black
people from using their restrooms, distributing bumper stickers with the
slogan "Don't Buy Gas Where You Can't Use the Restroom"; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Annual  conferences  between 1952 and 1954 for the RCNL in
Mound Bayou, Mississippi attracted tens of thousands of  supporters  for
Medgar Evers and his message; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  a  leader, Medgar Evers became the NAACP's first field
officer in Mississippi and established  new  local  chapters,  organized
voter  registration  drives,  and  helped  lead  protests to desegregate
public primary schools, parks, and Mississippi Gold Coast beaches; and
 
  WHEREAS, Dedicated to serving those without a  voice,  Medgar  Evers
became  involved  in  two  high-profile Mississippi cases, including the
1955 murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till and the 1960 conviction of  Clyde
Kennard,  a  Black  Civil  Rights  Advocate framed for crimes he did not
commit; and
 
  WHEREAS, On June 12,  1963,  Medgar  Evers  was  assassinated  after
pulling  into  his  driveway  and  getting out of his car carrying NAACP
T-shirts reading "Jim Crow Must Go"; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals  of  such  noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the passing of the Honorable  Medgar
Evers, Civil Rights Advocate, on June 12, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of the Honorable Medgar Evers.
