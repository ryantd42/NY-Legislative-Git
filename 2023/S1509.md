 AN ACT to establish a commission on post-secondary  correctional  educa-
  tion;  and providing for the repeal of such provisions upon expiration
  thereof

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature finds that
 the availability of post-secondary correctional education has the poten-
 tial  to reduce recidivism, increase employment opportunities for incar-
 cerated individual upon release and have a  positive  impact  on  prison
 safety  and  security.  The  legislature  further  finds  that  there is
 currently a lack of available post-secondary  educational  opportunities
 for incarcerated individuals in the New York state prison system.
  Studies have consistently found that the higher the level of education
 attained,  the  more  likely a former incarcerated individual will be to
 obtain gainful and stable employment, and the less likely he or she will
 be to engage in future criminal  activity.  However,  in  1994,  federal
 tuition  assistance,  in the form of Pell Grants, for individuals incar-
 cerated in federal and state correctional facilities was terminated with
 the enactment of the Violent Crime  Control  and  Law  Enforcement  Act.
 Then, in 1995, New York prohibited incarcerated individuals from access-
 ing  state  funds through the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) for post-
 secondary correctional education.  According to a  report  published  by
 the  Correctional  Association  of  New  York in January, 2009, entitled
 "Education From the  Inside,  Out:  The  Multiple  Benefits  of  College
 Programs in Prison," only four out of seventy post-secondary correction-
 al  education  programs  continued  to operate in New York following the
 termination of TAP availability for incarcerated individuals.
  According to the Correctional Association of New York report,  statis-
 tical  evidence  from  several highly regarded studies demonstrates that

 college programming in prison is a highly  effective  tool  in  reducing
 recidivism.  For  example, the report cites a 1991 study released by New
 York's department of correctional services that found incarcerated indi-
 viduals  who earned a degree while incarcerated had a 26.4 percent reci-
 divism rate whereas 44.6 percent of participants  who  did  not  earn  a
 degree  were  returned  to custody. The report cites another influential
 study, published in 2004,  "Post-Secondary  Correctional  Education  and
 Recidivism: A Meta-Analysis of Research Conducted 1990-1999," that found
 incarcerated individuals who participated in post-secondary correctional
 education  programs recidivated 22 percent of the time and those who did
 not participate had a recidivism rate of 41 percent.  Further,  the  New
 York  state commission on sentencing reform recently reported that post-
 secondary correctional education programs  have  been  shown  to  reduce
 recidivism  by  up to 40% and the commission recommended that more post-
 secondary educational opportunities be made  available  to  incarcerated
 individuals.
  The  Correctional  Association  of  New  York report also asserts that
 in-prison college programs are  a  cost-effective  method  of  improving
 public safety. The report states that "the cost differences in education
 versus incarceration in New York, plus the short- and long-term benefits
 of  a  better  educated population, makes investment in higher education
 for incarcerated individuals and people in the  community  smart  fiscal
 policy."  The report cites one cost-benefit analysis that found the cost
 to a state per crime prevented by  offering  education  to  incarcerated
 individuals  is  about  $1,600  while  the  cost  per crime prevented by
 extending prison sentences is $2,800. In other words, according  to  the
 study,  a  $1 million investment in incarceration will prevent about 350
 crimes, while that same investment in education will prevent  more  than
 600  crimes  meaning  that correctional education may be almost twice as
 cost-effective as incarceration.
  In addition, research suggests that post-secondary programs in  prison
 can provide incarcerated individuals with an incentive for good behavior
 and  greatly enhance an incarcerated individual's problem-solving skills
 thereby reducing tension and violent interactions  between  incarcerated
 individuals  and  staff and among incarcerated individuals.  Reportedly,
 incarcerated individuals who attend post-secondary  educational  classes
 are  among  the  best-behaved  of the incarcerated individual population
 because there is a strong incentive to avoid conduct that  could  result
 in discipline and a loss of credit for the college program.
  Despite  the  potential benefits of post-secondary correctional educa-
 tion programs, only a relatively  small  number  of  programs  currently
 operate  in  the  New  York  state prisons funded mostly through private
 sources, federal grants for youth offenders or through small legislative
 initiative grants.
  § 2. A temporary state commission, to be known as the New  York  state
 commission  on  post-secondary  correctional  education,  hereinafter
 referred to as the commission, is hereby created to  examine,  evaluate,
 and  make recommendations concerning the availability, effectiveness and
 need for expansion of post-secondary education in  the  New  York  state
 prison  system.  The  issues  to  be  considered by the commission shall
 include, but not be limited to, the following:
  a. the benefits of post-secondary correctional education in  improving
 public safety by reducing recidivism;
  b. the impact of post-secondary correctional education on an incarcer-
 ated individual's employment opportunities upon release from prison;
 S. 1509  3
 
  c. the impact of post-secondary correctional education on an incarcer-
 ated individuals reintegration into society upon release from prison;
  d.  the  cost  savings, if any, associated with reduced recidivism and
 the successful reintegration of  released  incarcerated  individual  who
 have participated in post-secondary correctional education;
  e. the impact of post-secondary correctional education on prison safe-
 ty and security;
  f. the need, if any, to expand post-secondary correctional educational
 programs  in  the  New York state prison system and the costs associated
 with such an expansion; and
  g. recommendations for funding options, including but not  limited  to
 the  Tuition  Assistance  Program, to increase the availability of post-
 secondary correctional education in the New York state prison system.
