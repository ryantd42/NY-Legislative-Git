 justice and [seventy-five] ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FOUR dollars per  hour  for
 time  reasonably  expended out of court, and shall receive reimbursement

 in providing representation:
  (a) pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision one of this section shall
 not exceed two thousand four hundred dollars; and
  (b) pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision one of this section shall
 not exceed four thousand four hundred dollars] HOURLY COMPENSATION TO BE

 AN ANNUAL COST OF LIVING INCREASE AS GOVERNED BY THE UNITED STATES CRIM-
 INAL  JUSTICE  ACT AND ALL HOURLY RATES SHALL BE INCREASED AUTOMATICALLY
 EACH YEAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY FEDERAL PAY  COMPARABILITY  ADJUSTMENT.
 SUCH  ADJUSTMENT SHALL BE EFFECTIVE ON APRIL FIRST IN THE SAME YEAR THAT
 THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT GOES INTO EFFECT FOR FEDERAL DEFENDERS.
  3. [For representation on an appeal,  compensation  and  reimbursement
 shall  be  fixed  by  the appellate court. For all other representation,
 compensation and reimbursement shall be fixed by the trial court  judge.
 In  extraordinary  circumstances  a trial or appellate court may provide
 for compensation in excess of the foregoing limits and  for  payment  of
 compensation and reimbursement for expenses before the completion of the
 representation.]  IN  EXTRAORDINARY  CIRCUMSTANCES  A TRIAL OR APPELLATE
 COURT MAY PROVIDE FOR COMPENSATION IN EXCESS  OF  THE  FOREGOING  LIMITS
 PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION AND FOR PAYMENT OF COMPEN-
 SATION AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR  EXPENSES  BEFORE  THE  COMPLETION  OF  THE

 expenses incurred and  reimbursement  or  compensation  applied  for  or
 received  in  the  same  case from any other source. No counsel assigned
 hereunder shall seek or accept any fee for representing  the  party  for

 tional  expenses incurred for the provision of counsel and services as a
 result of the implementation of a plan established pursuant to  subdivi-
 sion  four  of  section  eight  hundred thirty-two of the executive law,
 including any interim steps taken to implement such plan, shall be reim-
 bursed by the state to the county or city providing such services.  Such
 plans shall be submitted by the office of indigent legal services to the
 director of the division of budget for review and  approval.  However,
 the  director's approval shall be limited solely to the plan's projected
 fiscal impact of the required appropriation for  the  implementation  of
 such  plan,  and his or her approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 The  state  shall  appropriate  funds  sufficient  to  provide  for  the
 reimbursement  required  by this section; PROVIDED FURTHER THAT COUNTIES
 HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD PAYMENTS APPROVED BY THE  APPELLATE  COURT
 OR TRIAL COURT JUDGE.
  2.  ALL EXPENSES FOR PROVIDING COUNSEL AND SERVICES PURSUANT TO SUBDI-

 read as follows:

 any fee for representing the person for whom he or she is assigned with-
 out approval of the court as herein provided. Whenever it  appears  that
 such  person  is  financially  able  to  obtain  counsel or make partial
 payment for the representation, counsel may  report  this  fact  to  the
 court  and  the court may terminate the assignment or authorize payment,
 as the interests of  justice  may  dictate,  to  such  counsel.  Counsel
 assigned hereunder shall at the conclusion of the representation receive
 compensation  at a rate of [seventy-five] ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FOUR dollars
 per hour for time expended in  court,  and  [seventy-five]  ONE  HUNDRED
 SIXTY-FOUR  dollars  per hour for time reasonably expended out of court,
 and shall receive reimbursement for expenses reasonably  incurred.  [For
 representation  upon  a hearing, compensation and reimbursement shall be
 fixed by the court wherein the hearing was held  and  such  compensation
 shall  not exceed four thousand four hundred dollars. For representation
 in an appellate court, compensation and reimbursement shall be fixed  by
 such  court  and  such  compensation shall not exceed four thousand four
 hundred dollars.]In extraordinary circumstances the  court  may  provide
 for compensation in excess of the foregoing limits.
