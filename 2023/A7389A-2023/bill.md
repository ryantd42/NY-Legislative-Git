  CENSUS DATA: The number of members who will benefit in the future from
 this fiscal note is unknown. The estimates presented herein are based on
 preliminary  census  data collected as of June 30, 2023. The census data
 for members who have been approved for WTC benefits and the  potentially
 impacted  population  used  to  develop  the average costs is summarized
 below.
 
  NYCERS
  Active Members (Potentially Eligible)
  - Number Count:  7,919
  - Average Age:  57.4
  - Average Service:  24.4
  - Average Salary:  103,300
  Receiving Members (Current WTC)
  - Number Count:  52
  - Average Age:  65.4
 
  IMPACT ON MEMBER BENEFITS: Currently, a NYCTA member who incurs a  WTC
 Qualifying  Condition,  is eligible for a performance of duty disability
 retirement, generally a lifetime payment  of  1/60th  of  Final  Average
 Salary (FAS) times service not less than 1/3 of FAS.
  Under  the  proposed  legislation,  the performance of duty disability
 benefit for a NYCTA member who incur a World Trade Center (WTC) Qualify-
 ing Condition would be equal to:
  * 75% of FAS, where
  * FAS is defined as 3-Year FAS for Tier 4 and 5-Year FAS for  Tier  6,
 less
  * any applicable Workers' Compensation benefit.
  ASSUMPTIONS  AND  METHODS:  The  estimates  presented herein have been
 calculated based on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions  and  Methods
 of NYCERS.
  There  are  currently  52 members who have been approved for WTC bene-
 fits.  The cost for these members is recognized in the first-year  cost.
 The  number of additional members and eligible retirees who will benefit
 in the future from this fiscal note is unknown and included as per inci-
 dent WTC disability costs. The cost of this proposed  legislation  could
 vary  greatly  depending on the number of future members who benefit and
 on their length of service, age, and salary history.
  The estimated per incident financial impact for disabled  members  has
 been calculated assuming 50% would retire under an Accidental Disability
 benefit, and 50% would continue working if the proposed legislation were
 not passed.
  The  bill  appears  to  grant  eligible NYCTA members and retirees the
 ability to utilize the presumptions for infectious diseases pursuant  to
 subsection b of RSSL Section 607-b. Costs associated with granting these
 presumptions have not been included in this Fiscal Note.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the actuarial assumptions, methods,  and  models  used,  demo-
 graphics  of  the impacted population, and other factors such as invest-
 ment, contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates  from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those

 presented herein. Quantifying these risks is beyond the  scope  of  this
 Fiscal Note.
  This  Fiscal  Note  is intended to measure pension-related impacts and
 does not include other potential costs (e.g., administrative  and  Other
 Postemployment Benefits).
