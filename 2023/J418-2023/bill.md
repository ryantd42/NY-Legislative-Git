  HONORING  African  American  Clergy  and  Elected
  Officials, Inc. upon the occasion of its designation
  as recipient of the Community Service Award by  Stuy
  Park Lions Club, Inc. on February 17, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York
State are reflective of the concerned and  dedicated  efforts  of  those
businesses and individuals who would devote themselves to the welfare of
the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
African American Clergy and Elected Officials, Inc. upon the occasion of
its designation as recipient of the Community Service Award by Stuy Park
Lions Club, Inc., to be celebrated at its  30th  Annual  Pearl  Red  and
White Gala on Friday, February 17, 2023, at Antun's, Queens Village, New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Stuy  Park  Lions  Club  is  part  of  Lions  Clubs
International, one of the largest service organizations  in  the  world,
and is deeply committed to meeting the challenges of public service; and
 
  WHEREAS,  African  American Clergy and Elected Officials (AACEO) was
established in 1984 to assist in the election of Mayor David Dinkins and
established a connection between faith and politics;  today,  under  the
luminous  leadership  of  Reverend  Dr.  Robert  M. Waterman, this vital
organization continues to lead and  assist  in  all  components  of  the
community,  which  include caring for our youth, seniors, unemployed and
many more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Located  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  AACEO  is  the  only
organization in the state of New York where pastors, priests, ministers'
community-based organizations, educators, New York Police Department and
elected  officials meet monthly to exchange information on all levels of
government; and
 
  WHEREAS, The success of  AACEO  is  in  direct  correlation  to  the
efforts  of its partners and staff, whose involvement is, and always has
been,  characterized  by  an  impressive  commitment,  an  unbridled
enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising  standard  of  excellence  in  all
endeavors on behalf of the institution and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  those  who
enhance  the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown a
long and sustained commitment to excellence certainly  have  earned  the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor African American Clergy  and  Elected  Officials,  Inc.  upon  the
occasion  of  their  designation  as  recipient of the Community Service
Award by Stuy Park Lions Club, Inc.; and be it further
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Reverend Dr. Robert M. Waterman,  President,  African
American Clergy and Elected Officials, Inc.
