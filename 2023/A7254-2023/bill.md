 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1.  Subdivision  1 of section 1803-a of the real property tax
 law is amended by adding a new paragraph (ll) to read as follows:
  (LL) NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS  SUBDIVI-
 SION TO THE CONTRARY, IN A SPECIAL ASSESSING UNIT THAT IS NOT A CITY AND

 CURRENT  BASE PROPORTION OF ANY CLASS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ADJUSTED BASE
 PROPORTION OR ADJUSTED PROPORTION,  WHICHEVER  IS  APPROPRIATE,  OF  THE
 IMMEDIATELY  PRECEDING YEAR BY MORE THAN ONE PERCENT. WHERE THE COMPUTA-
 TION PERFORMED PURSUANT TO  PARAGRAPH  (B)  OF  THIS  SUBDIVISION  WOULD
 OTHERWISE PRODUCE SUCH RESULT, THE CURRENT BASE PROPORTION OF SUCH CLASS
 OR  CLASSES SHALL BE LIMITED TO SUCH ONE PERCENT INCREASE AND THE LEGIS-
 LATIVE BODY OF SUCH SPECIAL ASSESSING UNIT SHALL ALTER THE CURRENT  BASE
 PROPORTION  OF  ANY  OR  ALL  REMAINING  CLASSES  SO THAT THE SUM OF THE

 thousand  three  -  two  thousand four, two thousand four - two thousand
 five and two thousand five - two  thousand  six  assessment  rolls,  the

 the computation of current base proportions would otherwise produce such
 result, the current base proportion of such class or  classes  shall  be
 limited  to such two percent or one percent increase whichever is appli-
 cable, and the legislative body of such approved  assessing  unit  shall
 alter the current base proportion of either class so that the sum of the
 current base proportions equals one.
  §  3. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 of section 1903 of the real prop-
 erty tax law is amended by adding a new subparagraph (xxv)  to  read  as

 ANY  CLASS  SHALL  NOT  EXCEED  THE ADJUSTED BASE PROPORTION OR ADJUSTED
 PROPORTION, WHICHEVER IS APPROPRIATE, OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING YEAR,
 BY MORE THAN ONE PERCENT, PROVIDED THAT SUCH APPROVED ASSESSING UNIT HAS
 PASSED A LOCAL LAW, ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION  PROVIDING  THEREFOR.  WHERE
 THE COMPUTATION OF CURRENT BASE PROPORTIONS WOULD OTHERWISE PRODUCE SUCH
 RESULT,  THE  CURRENT  BASE PROPORTION OF SUCH CLASS OR CLASSES SHALL BE
 LIMITED TO SUCH ONE PERCENT INCREASE AND THE LEGISLATIVE  BODY  OF  SUCH
 APPROVED  ASSESSING  UNIT  SHALL  ALTER  THE  CURRENT BASE PROPORTION OF
 EITHER CLASS SO THAT THE SUM OF THE CURRENT BASE PROPORTIONS EQUALS ONE.

 the  2023  assessment  roll in approved assessing units in the county of
