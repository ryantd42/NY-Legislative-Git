 Introduced by Sen. FERNANDEZ -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Finance
 
 AN  ACT  to  amend the public health law, in relation to establishing an
  epinephrine auto-injector affordability program  to  provide  low-cost
  epinephrine auto-injectors; to amend the insurance law, in relation to
  requiring  coverage  for  epinephrine  auto-injectors  and capping the
  co-pay or deductible for such at  sixty  dollars;  and  to  amend  the
  general business law, in relation to making failure to comply with the
  epinephrine  auto-injectors affordability program a deceptive business
  practice; and making an appropriation therefor
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative  intent.  The  legislature finds and declares
 that:
  Individuals who have moderate to severe allergies, severe  asthma,  or
 genetic  conditions such as angioedema are at risk of reactions that can
 occur within seconds or minutes and that  can  lead  to  anaphylaxis,  a
 potentially fatal reaction.
  Epinephrine  works  quickly to improve breathing, stimulate the heart,
 raise dropping blood pressure, prevent airways from closing, prevent  or
 decrease  shock,  reverse  hives, and reduce swelling of the face, lips,
 and throat.
  A delay in appropriate  treatment  for  anaphylaxis  almost  certainly
 contributes  to death in individuals, so it is critical that all anaphy-
 laxis reactions are treated as a medical emergency.
  Epinephrine auto-injectors are essential because they are the  easiest
 and  most  efficient  way  to potentially save the life of an individual
 exhibiting symptoms of or experiencing anaphylactic shock.
  Rising costs of epinephrine auto-injectors make this life-saving medi-
 cation difficult or impossible to obtain for  many  people,  even  those
 with  private  health  insurance  or who are enrolled in a public health

 benefit program. Many individuals are unable to  afford  an  epinephrine
 auto-injector  because  they  cannot  pay  the copayment amount required
 under their insurance plan or, if they are uninsured,  the  cost  of  an
 epinephrine  auto-injector; these individuals risk their lives every day
 by not having access to this  life-saving  medicine  if  faced  with  an
 allergic reaction.
  Therefore,  it  is  the intent of the general assembly to establish an
 epinephrine auto-injector affordability program to ensure that New  York
 state residents have greater access to epinephrine.
