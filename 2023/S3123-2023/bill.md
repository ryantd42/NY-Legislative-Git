 THE TITLE OF CORRECTION LIEUTENANT, CORRECTION CAPTAIN, DEPUTY ASSISTANT
 SUPERINTENDENT OR SUPERINTENDENT; OR
  (IV)  A  PERSON  WHO  SERVES  IN  THE  TITLE OF CORRECTION LIEUTENANT,
 CORRECTION CAPTAIN, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OR SUPERINTENDENT ON

 ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE
 DATE  OF  THIS  CLAUSE. SUCH ELECTION SHALL BE IN WRITING, SHALL BE DULY
 EXECUTED AND FILED WITH THE COMPTROLLER AND SHALL BE IRREVOCABLE AS LONG
 AS SUCH PERSON IS IN THE  TITLE  OF  CORRECTION  LIEUTENANT,  CORRECTION
 CAPTAIN, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OR SUPERINTENDENT.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.-- Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would allow certain Tier 3, 5 and 6 correction lieutenants,
 correction captains, deputy assistant superintendents,  and  superinten-
 dents under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections and commu-
 nity  supervision  of New York State to become eligible to receive bene-
 fits under the provisions of Article 15 of  the  Retirement  and  Social
 Security  Law  instead  of  the special plan giving 50% of final average
 salary at 25 years of service.  Current  law  requires  seven  years  of
 service in the superintendent title to elect coverage under Article 15.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of approximately  $36.1  million,
 which will be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment. This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on March 31, 2024.
  This  bill  will  not  increase the future annual contributions of the
 State of New York.
  These estimated costs are based on 512 affected  members  employed  by
 the  State  of New York, with annual salary of approximately $63 million
 as of March 31, 2022.
  Affected members would have 90 days from the later  of  the  effective
 date of this bill and their date of being appointed to one of the titles
 to file for this benefit.  The election will be irrevocable.
