 AN ACT to amend the vehicle and traffic law, in relation to school speed
  limits
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision (a) of section 1620 of the vehicle and  traffic
 law,  as  amended by chapter 563 of the laws of 2002, is amended to read
 as follows:
  (a) The department of transportation with respect  to  state  highways
 maintained  by the state outside of cities having a population in excess
 of one million, and highways on Indian reservations, may by order,  rule
 or  regulation  establish  higher or lower maximum speed limits at which
 vehicles may proceed on or along such highways than the fifty-five miles
 per hour statutory maximum speed limit.  No  such  maximum  speed  limit
 shall  be  established  at  less than twenty-five miles per hour, except
 that school speed limits may be established at  not  less  than  fifteen
 miles per hour BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OR BY THE LEGISLATIVE
 BODY  OF ANY COUNTY OR, IF SO DELEGATED BY SUCH COUNTY LEGISLATIVE BODY,
 BY THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF ANY MUNICIPALITY OR SCHOOL  DISTRICT  LOCATED
 WITHIN  SAID  COUNTY,  for  a  distance not to exceed one thousand three
 hundred twenty feet, on a highway passing a school building, entrance or
 exit of a school abutting on the highway.  Absence  of  signs  installed
 pursuant  to this section shall be presumptive evidence that the depart-
 ment of transportation has not established a higher maximum speed  limit
 than the fifty-five miles per hour statutory limit.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the first of November next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
