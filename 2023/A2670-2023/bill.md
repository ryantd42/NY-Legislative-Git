 AN ACT in relation to a study to document  the  fiscal  implications  of
  repealing section 2 of chapter 851 of the laws of 1948
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature recognizes the need  to
 examine  Nassau County's real property tax assessment process in accord-
 ance with current law. Annually, Nassau County  handles  the  assessment
 process  and  are  therefore  liable for grievances. This has led to the
 County owing a significant amount of funding from those grievances. This
 is commonly referred to  as  the  County  Guaranty  and  was  originally
 authorized  by the state in a time when rising property values and taxes
 were not an issue. This bill is designed to call on  the  department  of
 taxation  and  finance  to study the current real property tax system in
 Nassau County. The intent would be to determine whether  or  not  giving
 the  assessing  authority  and  grievance responsibility to local taxing
 jurisdictions within the County is more feasible.
  § 2. The New York state department of taxation and finance  is  hereby
 authorized and directed to conduct a comprehensive study documenting the
 fiscal  implications of shifting assessment responsibilities from Nassau
 County, as authorized by chapter 879 of the laws of 1936  and  repealing
 section  2 of chapter 851 of the laws of 1948.  Such fiscal implications
 shall include, but not be limited to, the direct financial  impact  such
 shift  and  repeal will have on towns in such county. The results of the
 study shall be published no later than one year following the  effective
 date of this act. A copy of the results of such study shall be submitted
 to  the governor, the temporary president of the senate, and the speaker
 of the assembly.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
