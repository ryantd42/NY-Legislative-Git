  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official weeks that are set aside to recognize certain professionals who
affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim November 5-11, 2023, as
Radiologic Technologist Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, This week-long celebration calls attention to the important
role medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals play in patient
care and health care safety in communities large  and  small  throughout
New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Radiologic Technologist Week takes place each year
during the week that includes November 8th, to commemorate the discovery
of the x-ray by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen on that day in 1895; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 1953, the Radiological Society of the State of New York
was founded in order to better strengthen their professional and ethical
status; currently, this  valuable  society  boasts  over  1,200  members
statewide;  as of January 1, 2019, there were 21,161 active licenses for
Radiologic Technologists in New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Professionals in the radiologic sciences are  dedicated  to
the  highest  standard of professionalism and continually maintain those
standards  through  education,  lifelong  learning,  credentialing  and
personal commitment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  due  to  the  hard  work  and  care  of radiologic
technologists that our citizens in this great Empire State  receive  the
highest possible care needed, and it is imperative that there be greater
awareness  and  appreciation of these hard-working professionals for the
work they  do  to  better  the  well-being  of  all  New  Yorkers;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to

York, and the New York Radiological Society.
