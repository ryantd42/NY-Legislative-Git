  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 7-13, 2023, as Fibromyalgia  Awareness  Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
official months established to  increase  awareness  of  serious  health
issues that affect the lives of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  May  7-13,  2023,  as  Fibromyalgia
Awareness  Week  in  the  State  of  New  York,  in conjunction with the
observance of National Fibromyalgia Awareness Week; and
 
  WHEREAS, An estimated 10 million people in the United States, and an
estimated 3-6 percent of the world's population, generally between  ages
20-50, have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia; in the United States, this
number  increases to approximately 8 percent by age 80, according to the
National Fibromyalgia Association; and
 
  WHEREAS, A chronic syndrome with no known prevention or  cure,  that
is  increasing  at  alarming  rates,  fibromyalgia  causes  debilitating
widespread  chronic  pain  and  fatigue;  has  a  demonstrated  genetic
component;  occurs  in  women,  men,  and  children  of  all  ages  and
ethnicities;  and  demonstrates  some  similarities  with  Long  Covid,
signaling an increased need for more research funding; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Patients  with  fibromyalgia  often  have  to  live  with
widespread  pain  throughout  their  bodies,  extreme  fatigue,  sleep
disorders,  digestive  difficulties,  stiffness  and  weakness, migraine
headaches,  numbness  and  tingling,  and  impairment  of  memory  and
concentration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  average  gap  between  medical  research and clinical
practice is 17 years, and it often takes an average  of  five  years  to
receive a diagnosis of fibromyalgia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fibromyalgia  patients  are  often  misunderstood  by  the
medical, business, and education communities, primarily due to the  lack
of  teaching  in medical schools about what is currently known regarding
this potentially disabling illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Chronic pain is a risk factor for suicide,  as  individuals
with  chronic  pain  are  at  least  twice  as likely to report suicidal
behaviors or to complete suicide; as part of  their  global  initiative,
the  World  Health Organization recommends that a comprehensive clinical
assessment  of  suicidal  behaviors  be  routinely  performed  on  all
individuals 10 years of age or older who report having chronic pain; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  a  fact  sheet  provided  by  the  National
Fibromyalgia Association, 90% of physicians agree there is  a  need  for
more  physician-oriented  information,  and 82% of physicians agree that
fibromyalgia is difficult to treat with currently available  tools;  use
 
of  complementary  and  alternative  medicine  is  2 1/2 times higher in
fibromyalgia patients; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The NIH reports that average direct costs above insurance,
over a three-month period, added up to $951, which could  be  translated
in a mean annual cost of $3,804 per patient; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fibromyalgia  patients  often  lose jobs, career promotion
opportunities, homes, and spouses or significant others due to  lack  of
awareness  and understanding about the potentially devastating impact of
this illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Patients report  that  the  optimal  approach  to  treating
fibromyalgia is a team of physicians, with traditional and complementary
therapists,  tailoring  the  treatment for each individual patient; this
can  be  accomplished  best  in  an  arrangement  that  facilitates
communication between the patient and the team; and
 
  WHEREAS,  International  Institute  For  Human  Empowerment, Inc., a
nonprofit charitable organization in the Capital District of  New  York,
is  dedicated  to  empowering all who face discrimination as a result of
race, gender, socioeconomic status,  age,  disabilities,  and  lifestyle
choices; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  International  Institute For Human Empowerment, Inc.,
under the leadership of Sue Shipe, PhD, developed the Fibromyalgia  Task
Force  of  New  York  State  to  address inequities in the diagnosis and
treatment of fibromyalgia patients due to lack of education  in  medical
schools  and  continuing education for physicians, lack of understanding
by society at large, lack of understanding and  adequate  accommodations
by  employers,  and lack of legal protections due to the general lack of
recognition of the devastating impact of this illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Fibromyalgia  Task  Force  of  New  York  State  serves
patients  across  the State, provides education and advocacy nationally,
and shares information internationally; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Fibromyalgia Task Force of New York State is announcing
the  immediate  release  of  their  new  website  for  physicians,
www.nyfibro.org,  that  provides  an  overview  of  current fibromyalgia
research with implications for new treatments, as well as a  section  of
resources that patients have found helpful for dealing with the symptoms
of fibromyalgia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Fibromyalgia  Task Force of New York State recommends
the  formation  of  a  statewide  committee  comprised  of  patients,
researchers,  physicians,  and  legislators;  business,  education,  and
public health leaders; attorneys; complementary therapists;  and  others
to address issues relevant to fibromyalgia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  recognizes  the  needs  of  those
chronically ill people who suffer from fibromyalgia, and  urges  all  of
our citizens to support the search for prevention and a cure, and assist
those families who deal with this devastating syndrome on a daily basis;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  7-13,  2023,  as
Fibromyalgia Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York,  International  Institute  For Human Empowerment, Inc., Integrated
Tissue Dynamics, Albany Medical Center, New  York  State  Department  of
Health,  Medical  Society  of  the State of New York, and SUNY at Albany
Department of Public Health.
