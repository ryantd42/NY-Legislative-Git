BY: Senator BORRELLO
 
  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of The Reg
  Lenna Center for the Arts of Jamestown, New York, on
  February 5, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor  and  pay
tribute  to  those  cultural  institutions  and  organizations  whose
commitment to promoting the richness  and  diversity  of  the  arts  and
entertainment  world  has  contributed  to  the  strength, vitality, and
cultural enrichment of their communities and  the  great  State  of  New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the 100th Anniversary of The Reg Lenna Center for the Arts,
to be celebrated on Sunday, February 5, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Reg Lenna Center for the Arts of Jamestown,  New  York,
first  opened its doors to the public on February 5, 1923, as The Palace
Theatre; in its first three years,  the  theater  would  typically  show
short  comedy  and  feature  films both before and after its twice-daily
vaudevillian performances; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1926, The Palace Theatre and its facility was  purchased
by  businessman  Nikitas  Dipson, who continued its usual programming of
film and vaudeville shows until he secured a 20-year  lease  making  The
Palace a Warner Brothers theater; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Once the lease with Warner Brothers was concluded in 1950,
Nikitas Dipson, now doing business as Dipson Theatres, once  again  took
over  management  of The Palace; soon after, an extensive remodel to the
facility took place, which saw  the  installation  of  new  heating  and
cooling systems, carpeting, wall coverings, and new seats; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  of  The Palace's finest moments came in 1956, when it
hosted the world premiere of "Forever, Darling," starring Desi Arnaz and
Lucille Ball; the comedy couple visited Jamestown, Lucille's birthplace,
to attend the screening, drawing thousands of adoring fans downtown  and
to  the theater to welcome the Hollywood stars in their Western New York
visit; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the following decades, the theater experienced a decline
in attendance and deterioration to its equipment and building itself; by
the dawn of the 1980s, The Palace was in a state of dilapidation and  in
dire need of repairs; and
 
  WHEREAS, A special concert was arranged by Phillip Morris, executive
director of the Chautauqua County Arts Council, who contacted his friend
Harry  Chapin  about doing a performance in Jamestown to raise awareness
about the current condition of The Palace; and
 
  WHEREAS, In June of  1981,  The  Palace  featured  Harry  Chapin  in
concert, the first live performance show to be held in the theater in 25
years;  sparked  by the singer's interest, a group of citizens, with the
 
help of the Jamestown Urban Renewal Agency and  the  Gebbie  Foundation,
banded  together  to  repair  and clean up the theater; after a positive
response, the theater was ready to re-open by October of 1982; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In February of 1987, the $3.35 million Palace Civic Center
capital campaign was started to completely renovate the old Palace;  The
Reginald  and  Elizabeth  Lenna  Foundation made an early donation of $1
million and by fall the campaign had exceeded its goal by  raising  $3.5
million;  in  the  following year, The Palace was officially renamed The
Reg Lenna Civic Center; and
 
  WHEREAS, The beautifully restored, 1,269-seat Reg Lenna Civic Center
held its grand reopening on October 12, 1990, and soon after, received a
League  of  Historic  American  Theatres  award  for  the  quality  and
workmanship of its restoration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For several years, The Reg operated side by side with Arts
Council for Chautauqua County, spearheaded by Executive Director Phillip
Morris;  both  organizations  saw  significant  growth  with  property
acquisitions  and  management, Arts In Education programs with Jamestown
Public Schools, the Wright Gallery and  Palace  Gallery,  the  start  of
Infinity  Performing Arts and The Lucy-Desi Museum and Center for Comedy
(and the Lucille Ball Comedy Festival) and  mainstage  productions  from
several  area  art  groups;  during  this  period,  film enthusiast Paul
Schmidt programmed a film series featuring current, critically-acclaimed
movies; and
 
  WHEREAS, Through the early 2000s, The Arts Council and The Reg Lenna
Civic  Center  continued  their  partnership,  while  Infinity  and  the
Lucy-Desi  Center branched off into their own separate endeavors; during
this time The Reg welcomed David Schein as its new  Executive  Director,
and  under his luminous leadership The Reg became more involved with the
community and engaged new prospective collaborators in the way  of  arts
education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2004, Dennis Drew, a founding member of 10,000 Maniacs
and Jamestown native, founded community radio station WRFA-LP 107.9  FM,
which  was  followed  by the public opening of the 3rd on 3rd Gallery in
2011, which featured the first "All Decks on Hand" skateboard art  show;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  In 2013, The Reg Lenna Center for the Arts was formed, and
was led by Executive Director Kathleen Eads; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Reg's first  season  was  highlighted  by  a  September
performance  of 10,000 Maniacs in recognition of the 10th anniversary of
WRFA, and the following month, Harry Chapin's brothers, along  with  his
bandmates,  nephews,  and nieces, performed a live concert titled "Harry
Chapin: A Family Celebration", fulfilling the late singer's  promise  to
return to the restored Palace Theatre; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  2015,  staff and board of The Reg, along with regional
foundation representatives,  Jamestown  city  officials,  and  community
members,  joined  with an architectural firm to conceptualize a complete
overhaul of The Reg's lobby, box office, and  surrounding  buildings  to
fully  realize  the potential of the block as a focus for community arts
involvement; The Reg  was  awarded  Downtown  Revitalization  Initiative
 
funding  matched  by  support  from  the local Gebbie, Sheldon and Lenna
foundations to realize the plans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In December 2017, construction began on the master plan to
move 3rd on 3rd Gallery to street level, create new offices, remodel and
update WRFA studios and offices,  and  create  a  community  media  arts
studio, and a new digital marquee was installed, taking the place of the
existing  milk  glass;  however,  the  classic  profile  of the marquee,
including neon and running lights remains; and
 
  WHEREAS, In August of 2018, the new lobby,  box  office,  concession
stand,  and a street level 3rd on 3rd Gallery, were opened to the public
along with new sidewalks embedded with a snow melt system;  construction
on the master plan to renovate all of The Reg's facilities was completed
in December of 2018; and
 
  WHEREAS, A vibrant arts community encourages collaboration, instills
local  pride,  draws  people together, and is essential to a community's
vitality; since its inception, The Reg Lenna Center  for  the  Arts  has
greatly  contributed  to the richness of New York's cultural palette and
remains steadfastly dedicated to ensuring this gem remains  in  all  its
glory for decades to come; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The arts are the building blocks of civilization; they are
central  to  human  expression;  they  enlighten  us  and  inspire  the
imagination;  educational  institutions,  individuals, and organizations
which further such worthy purposes  richly  merit  the  recognition  and
appreciation of this Legislative Body and the people of the State of New
York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Under the luminous leadership of Executive Director Hillary
Meyer,  The Reg Lenna Center for the Arts looks back with great pride to
its  beginnings,  viewing,  with  just  satisfaction,  its  successful
evolution,  it  renews  both  its  dedication  to  supporting  artistic
excellence, and its commitment to the community it has been built within
beginning in 1923, expressing its appreciation to  all  those  who  have
helped to sustain and enhance it over the years; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of The Reg Lenna Center for  the  Arts
in the City of Jamestown, New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Hillary Meyer, Executive Director, The Reg  Lenna  Center
for the Arts.
