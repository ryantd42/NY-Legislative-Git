 Introduced  by Sen. HOYLMAN-SIGAL -- read twice and ordered printed, and
  when printed to be committed to the Committee on Consumer Protection
 
 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to restricting the
  disclosure of personal information by businesses
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "right to
 know act".
  § 2. The legislature hereby finds  and  declares  that  the  right  to
 privacy  is  a  personal  and  fundamental right protected by the United
 States Constitution. All individuals have a right of privacy in informa-
 tion pertaining to them.
  This state recognizes the importance of providing consumers with tran-
 sparency about how their personal information has been shared  by  busi-
 nesses.  For  free  market  forces to have a role in shaping the privacy
 practices and for "opt-in"  and  "opt-out"  remedies  to  be  effective,
 consumers must be more than vaguely informed that a business might share
 personal  information  with  third  parties.  Consumers  must  be better
 informed about what kinds of personal information are purchased by busi-
 nesses for direct marketing purposes. With  these  specifics,  consumers
 can knowledgeably choose to opt-in or opt-out or choose among businesses
 that disclose information to third parties for direct marketing purposes
 on the basis of how protective the business is of consumers' privacy.
  Businesses  are  now  collecting  personal information and sharing and
 selling it in ways not contemplated or properly covered by  the  current
 law. Some web sites are installing up to one hundred tracking tools when
 consumers  visit web pages and sending very personal information such as
 age, gender, race, income, health  concerns,  and  recent  purchases  to
 third-party advertising and marketing companies. Third-party data broker
 companies are buying, selling, and trading personal information obtained

 from  mobile  phones,  financial  institutions,  social media sites, and
 other online and brick and mortar companies.
  Some  mobile  applications  are  sharing personal information, such as
 location information, unique  phone  identification  numbers,  and  age,
 gender, and other personal details with third-party companies.
  Consumers  need  to  know  the ways that their personal information is
 being collected by companies and then shared or sold to third parties in
 order to properly protect their privacy, personal safety, and  financial
 security.
  §  3. The article heading of article 39-F of the general business law,
 as amended by chapter 117 of the laws of 2019, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  [NOTIFICATION OF UNAUTHORIZED] ACQUISITION AND USE
  OF PRIVATE
  INFORMATION; DATA SECURITY PROTECTIONS
  §  4. The general business law is amended by adding a new section 899-
 cc to read as follows:
