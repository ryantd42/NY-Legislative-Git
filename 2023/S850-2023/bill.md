 employer has violated this section, the commissioner shall issue to  the
 employer  an  order directing compliance therewith, which shall describe
 particularly the alleged violation.  A  copy  of  such  order  shall  be
 provided  to  any  employee  who has filed a complaint and to his or her
 authorized representative.  The  commissioner  [shall]  MAY  assess  the
 employer a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars
 for  a  first  violation, two thousand dollars for a second violation IF
 WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS, or three thousand dollars for a  third  or  subse-
 quent  violation  OF  THIS  SECTION  IF  WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS; PROVIDED,

 SUBDIVISION FIVE OF THIS SECTION.  [The employee shall receive an  addi-
 tional  fifteen  percent  of  the overtime payment from the employer for
