 of this section, the market value of the reconstruction,  alteration  or
 improvement,  or  new construction as authorized by subdivision one-a of

 in which case the increase in assessed value attributable to such recon-

 the  purposes  of  this section, the market value of the reconstruction,
 alteration or improvement shall be equal to the increased assessed value
 attributable to such reconstruction, alteration or  improvement  divided
 by  the  class  I ratio in a special assessing unit or the most recently
 established state equalization rate or special equalization rate in  the
 remainder  of  the  state,  except  where the state equalization rate or
 special equalization rate equals  or  exceeds  ninety-five  percent,  in
