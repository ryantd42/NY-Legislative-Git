 AN ACT granting retroactive tier IV membership in the New York state and
  local employees' retirement system to Maureen Sullivan Nasca
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 Maureen Sullivan Nasca, an employee of the Erie  County  Medical  Center
 and  a  member  of  the  New  York state and local employees' retirement
 system, who was a full-time employee at the Roswell  Park  Comprehensive
 Cancer  Center  from December 7, 1995 to December 22, 2013, and who, for
 reasons not ascribable to her own negligence, failed to become a  member
 of  such  retirement system during such employment with the Roswell Park
 Comprehensive Cancer Center in 1995, shall be deemed to have joined  the
 New  York  state  and  local employees' retirement system on the date of
 December 7, 1995 and shall be granted Tier IV status in such  retirement
 system  if, within one year of the effective date of this act, she shall
 file a written request with the state comptroller.
  § 2. No contributions made to the New York state and local  employees'
 retirement  system  by  Maureen  Sullivan  Nasca  shall  be  refunded or
 returned to her pursuant to this act.
  § 3. All past service costs of implementing the provisions of this act
 shall be borne by the state of New York.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
  LBD11185-03-4
 S. 7292--B  2
 
  This bill would provide Maureen Sullivan Nasca with a date of  member-
 ship of December 7, 1995, their date of first eligible employment in the
 New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System, resulting in Tier
 4  status.  Maureen  Sullivan  Nasca is currently a Tier 6 member. There
 will be no refund of member contributions.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will  be an increase of approximately $57,000 in the
 annual contributions of the Erie County Medical Center  for  the  fiscal
 year  ending  March 31, 2025. In future years this cost will vary as the
 billing rates and salary of Maureen Sullivan Nasca change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $1.59 million which will
 be borne by the State of New York as a one-time payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
