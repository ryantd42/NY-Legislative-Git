 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law,  in  relation  to  requiring
  town  attorneys to institute proceedings to collect fines, restitution
  or reparation in towns contained within Nassau county

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 420.20 of the criminal procedure law, as amended by
 chapter 290 of the laws of 1980, is amended to read as follows:
 §  420.20  Collection  of  fines, restitution or reparation imposed upon
  corporations.
  Where a corporation is sentenced to pay a fine, restitution or repara-
 tion, the fine, restitution or reparation  must  be  paid  at  the  time
 sentence  is imposed.  If the fine, restitution or reparation is not so
 paid, it may be collected in the same manner as a judgment  in  a  civil
 action,  and if execution issued upon such judgment be returned unsatis-
 fied an action may be brought in the name of the people of the state  of
 New  York  to procure a judgment sequestering the property of the corpo-
 ration, as provided by the business corporation law.  It is the duty  of
 the attorney general in all criminal proceedings prosecuted by him, and,
 in  all  other proceedings, the county attorney for counties outside the
 city of New York, OR THE TOWN ATTORNEY FOR ALL PROCEEDINGS PROSECUTED BY
 SUCH TOWN ATTORNEY FOR TOWNS CONTAINED WITHIN NASSAU COUNTY, and, in the
 city of New York the corporation counsel of the city  of  New  York,  to
 institute proceedings to collect such fine, restitution or reparation.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
