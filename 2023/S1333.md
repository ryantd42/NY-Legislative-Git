  (3) The facility shall have a written plan to assure  that  the  iden-
 tification  established by the natural organic reduction permit accompa-
 nies the remains of the deceased human being through the natural organic
 reduction process and until the identity of the deceased  is  accurately
 and  legibly inscribed on the container in which the remains are [tempo-
 rarily] placed.
  (e) Ceremonial casket natural organic reduction disclosure.  In  those
 instances in which the remains of deceased human beings are to be deliv-
 ered  to  a  natural  organic  reduction  facility in a casket  OR OTHER
 CONTAINER that is not to  be  naturally  organically  reduced  with  the
 deceased,  timely  disclosure  thereof must be made by the person making
 the funeral arrangements to the natural organic reduction facility  that
 prior  to  natural  organic  reduction the remains of the deceased human
 being shall be  transferred  to  [an  alternative]  A  container  OR  IN
 EXTERNAL  WRAPPINGS  SUFFICIENT TO CONTAIN THE REMAINS AND ALSO DESIGNED
 TO FULLY  DECOMPOSE  IN  THE  NATURAL  REDUCTION  PROCESS.  Such  signed
 acknowledgement  of  the  authorizing person, that the timely disclosure
 has been made, shall be retained by the natural organic reduction facil-
 ity in its permanent records.
  (f) Transferring remains. (1) The remains of a  deceased  human  being

 her]  THEIR statutory duty, which signed authorization shall be retained
 by the natural organic reduction facility in its permanent records.
  (2) When the remains of a deceased human being are to  be  transferred
 to  an alternative container, the transfer shall be conducted in privacy
 with dignity and respect and by the licensed funeral director or  regis-
 tered  resident  who delivered those remains. The transferring operation
 shall comply with all rules and  regulations  intended  to  protect  the
 health and safety of facility personnel.
  (i) Disposition of remains. The authorizing agent shall be responsible
 for the final disposition of the remains. Disposition of remains result-
 ing  from the natural organic reduction process are not recoverable once
 scattered or interred. Remains shall be disposed of by  scattering  them
 in  a  designated  scattering  garden or area in a cemetery, or by prior
 authorization by the cemetery corporation, by placing them in  a  grave,
 crypt,  or niche, or retrieval of the remains pursuant to prior authori-
 zation by the authorizing agent or a person specifically  designated  by
 the  authorizing agent. Upon completion of the natural organic reduction
 process, the cemetery corporation shall notify the authorizing agent and

 REMAINS  TO  THE  AUTHORIZING AGENT OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENUMERATED UNDER
 PARAGRAPH (A) OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION FORTY-TWO HUNDRED ONE OF THE
 PUBLIC HEALTH LAW concerning the remains. If,  after  a  period  of  one
 hundred  twenty days from the date of the natural organic reduction, the
 authorizing agent has not instructed the cemetery corporation to arrange
 for the final disposition of the remains or  claimed  the  remains,  the
 cemetery  corporation may dispose of the remains in any manner permitted
 by this section. The cemetery corporation, however, shall keep a  perma-
 nent  record  identifying the site of final disposition. The authorizing
 agent shall be responsible for reimbursing the cemetery corporation  for
 all  reasonable  expenses  incurred  in  disposing  of the remains. Upon
 disposing of the remains, the cemetery corporation shall  be  discharged
 from  any  legal  obligation  or liability TO DELIVER THE REMAINS TO THE
 AUTHORIZING AGENT OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENUMERATED UNDER PARAGRAPH (A)  OF
 SUBDIVISION  TWO  OF  SECTION FORTY-TWO HUNDRED ONE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH
 LAW concerning the remains.  Except with the express written  permission
 of the authorizing agent, no person shall place remains of more than one
 person in the same temporary container or urn.
  (j)  Natural  organic  reduction facility operation certification. Any
 employee of a natural organic reduction FACILITY whose  function  is  to
 conduct  the  daily  operations  of  the  cremation  or  natural organic
 reduction process shall be certified by an organization approved by  the
 division  of  cemeteries. Proof of such certification shall be posted in
 the natural organic reduction facility and available for  inspection  at
 any  time.  Any  new  employees  of a natural organic reduction facility
 required to be certified under this section shall  be  certified  within
 one  year  of  their  employment.  Any  employees  of  a natural organic
 reduction facility required to  be  certified  under  this  section  and
 retained  prior  to the effective date of this paragraph shall be certi-
 fied within one year of such effective date.  Renewal  of  such  certif-
 ication  shall  be  completed  every five years from the date of certif-
 ication.
