 Introduced by M. of A. ARDILA -- read once and referred to the Committee

 AN  ACT  to  amend  the public health law, in relation to the program of
  all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE); and to amend a  chapter  of
  the  laws  of  2022  amending  the  public  health law relating to the
  program of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE), as  proposed  in
  legislative bills numbers S. 8903 and A. 9542, in relation to legisla-
  tive intent
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Section 1 of a chapter of the laws  of  2022  amending  the
 public  health law relating to the program of all-inclusive care for the
 elderly (PACE), as proposed in legislative bills numbers S. 8903 and  A.
 9542, is amended to read as follows:
  Section  1.  Legislative intent. The Program of All-Inclusive Care for
 the Elderly ("PACE") is a federally recognized  model  of  comprehensive
 care  for  persons 55 years of age or older who qualify for nursing home
 levels of care, who wish to remain  in  their  community,  and  who  are
 eligible for Medicaid (see, Sections 1894 and 1934 to Title XVIII of the
 Social  Security  Act;  42  CFR  460).  Uniformity of regulation of PACE
 organizations will promote efficiency for the organizations and for  the
 state. It is the intent of the legislature through this act to provide a
 more  efficient and uniform structure to promote the prudent development
 of PACE organizations, to promote better health outcomes for New Yorkers
 enrolled in PACE organizations, and to realize administrative  efficien-
 cies.  It  is  the intent of the legislature to recognize PACE organiza-
 tions as integrated providers of care.  PACE organizations shall not  be
 construed  to  be  managed  care  organizations  under article 44 of the
 public health law, PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT THIS  SHALL  NOT  PROHIBIT  THE
 APPLICATION OF REQUIREMENTS UNDER SUCH ARTICLE OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS,
 OR  SIMILAR  REQUIREMENTS, AS DETERMINED APPROPRIATE BY THE COMMISSIONER
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
