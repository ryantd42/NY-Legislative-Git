 AN ACT authorizing Maimonides Educational Center to receive  retroactive
  real property tax exempt status
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of the county of Nassau is hereby authorized to accept from
 Maimonides Educational Center an application  for  exemption  from  real
 property taxes pursuant to section 462 of the real property tax law with
 respect  to  the  2020-2021  assessment  rolls  for all of the 2020-2021
 school taxes, a portion of the 2020 general taxes and all  of  the  2021
 general  taxes  for  the parcel conveyed to such organization located at
 2083 Seneca Gate, hamlet  of  Merrick,  town  of  Hempstead,  county  of
 Nassau,  otherwise known as Nassau county parcel ID section 56 block 447
 lot 13. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it had been
 received on or before the taxable status date established for such roll.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such  organization  had  filed  an  application for
 exemption by the appropriate taxable status  date,  the  assessor,  upon
 approval  by  the  Nassau  county  legislature,  may  make  appropriate
 correction to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted  and  such
 organization,  therefore,  shall  have  paid any tax with respect to the
 subject rolls, the applicable governing body or tax department  may,  in
 its  sole  discretion,  provide  for  the refund of those taxes paid and
 cancel those  taxes,  fines,  penalties,  liens  or  interest  remaining
 unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
