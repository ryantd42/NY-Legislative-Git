 Introduced  by  Sen. HINCHEY -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Environmental Conservation
 
 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  establishing  the  position  of  Catskill  park coordinator within the
  department of environmental conservation

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  The  New York City Watershed Agreement, the Public Access
 Plan, the Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act and other department  of  envi-
 ronmental  conservation  programs  in  the  Catskills  all have a common
 interest in community development,  land  acquisition  and  recreational
 access,  concern for the abundance and purity of water, and coordination
 with other department of environmental  conservation  activities  within
 the  watershed.  The  department of environmental conservation watershed
 coordinator is responsible for the monumental  task  of  overseeing  the
 implementation  of  all  state partnership programs embodied in the 1997
 New York City Watershed Agreement. The  new  Catskill  park  coordinator
 position would complement the role of the watershed coordinator by inte-
 grating  those  activities  directly  related to the watershed agreement
 with all other department of environmental conservation  program  inter-
 ests  and by advocating for the best interests of the Catskill park. The
 benefit of a Catskill  Park  Preserve  Advocate  has  been  successfully
 demonstrated  in the Hudson River estuary, Adirondacks, and Salmon River
 corridor; a similar position will ensure integration and balance in  the
 department  of  environmental  conservation's  current and future initi-
 atives affecting the natural, social and economic resources in the Cats-
 kill Region.
  § 2. The environmental conservation law is amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 9-0115 to read as follows:
 § 9-0115. CATSKILL PARK COORDINATOR.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
