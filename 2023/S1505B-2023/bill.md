 shall  be allowed to reapply for ordinary disability retirement benefits
 from the New York state and local employees' retirement system  covering

 S. 1505  2
 
 of  March  1, 2003, to apply for a temporary ordinary disability retire-
 ment benefit for the period from June 19, 1992 through March 1, 2003.
  If  this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, and Lois
 J. Reid is granted a temporary disability  benefit,  there  will  be  an
 immediate  past  service  cost  of  approximately $127,000 which will be
 borne by the State of New York as  a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2024.
