  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Lois  J.  Reid,
 who  was  employed  by the Erie County Youth Board on March 6, 1970, and
 who was employed by the New York state department of social services  on
 May  16,  1985,  was a member of the New York state and local employees'
 retirement system for  approximately  17.5  years,  was  diagnosed  with
 chronic  fatigue  syndrome  in 1990, which is a symptom of mitochondrial
 disease, of which was diagnosed on March 1, 2011,  and  which  was  only
 recently identified by the medical community, was declared to be totally
 and  permanently  disabled  by  the  New York state department of social
 services in 1990, and who was declared to  be  totally  and  permanently
 disabled  by  the  United  States  social security administration in the
 early 1990s, and who was denied ordinary disability retirement benefits,
 shall be allowed to reapply for ordinary disability retirement  benefits
 from  the New York state and local employees' retirement system covering
 the period from June 19, 1992 through March 1, 2003 if, within one  year
 of  the  effective date of this act, she shall file a written request to
 that effect with the state comptroller.

  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill would allow Lois J. Reid, a service retiree of the New York
 State and Local Employees' Retirement System with a date  of  retirement
 of  March  1, 2003, to apply for a temporary ordinary disability retire-
 ment benefit for the period from June 19, 1992 through March 1, 2003.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024 Legislative Session  and  Lois
 J.  Reid  is  granted a temporary disability benefit, there will be an
 immediate past service cost of  approximately  $127,000  which  will  be
 borne  by  the  State  of  New York as a one-time payment. This estimate
 assumes that payment will be made on March 1, 2025.
