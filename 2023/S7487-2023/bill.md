 terms of any award including, without limitation, awards  made  pursuant
 to  [subdivision five of] section thirteen-g, subdivision two of section
 thirteen-f, subdivision five of section thirteen-k, subdivision five  of
 section  thirteen-l  and  subdivision  six of section thirteen-m of this
 article, payment of the award shall  be  promptly  made  from  the  fund
 created  under this section in accordance with the terms thereof and the
 provisions of subdivision three of this section. The employer  shall  be
 liable  with  the fund for payment of the award. Where the employer is a
 corporation, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP OR
 PARTNERSHIP, the president, secretary [and], treasurer, MEMBER AND PART-
 NER thereof shall also be personally, jointly and severally liable  with
 the  corporation,  LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNER-
 SHIP OR PARTNERSHIP for payment of the award. The employer shall pay the
 award into the fund, in accordance with the time  limitations  contained
 in section twenty-five of this article.
  (b)  No  such award, however, for any service specified in subdivision
 five of section thirteen-a of this article  requiring  advance  authori-
 zation  of the employer in accordance with the provisions of such subdi-
 vision, shall be payable from  the  fund  unless  advance  authorization
 therefor  was  secured  from the representative of the fund or is deter-
 mined by the board to be necessary. Notwithstanding any other  provision
 under  this  section, awards made pursuant to section fourteen-a of this
 article shall not be the liability of the fund and shall not be  payable
 therefrom nor shall payment of the present value of benefits be required
 to be paid into the aggregate trust fund pursuant to section twenty-sev-
 en of this article in any case in which the uninsured employers' fund is
 liable.
  2.  Uninsured  employers'  fund.  (a) There is hereby created a fund
 which shall be known as the "uninsured employers' fund" to  provide  for
 the payment of awards against uninsured employers in accordance with the
 provisions  of this section and shall be available only for the purposes
 stated in this subdivision, and the assets thereof shall not at any time
 be appropriated or directed to any other use or purpose, except  as  set
 forth in section fifty-a of this chapter.
  (b)  For  the  purpose  of establishing and maintaining this fund, the
 board, upon rendering a decision with respect to any claim  for  compen-
 sation  under  this chapter that the employer liable therefor has failed
 to secure the payment of compensation with respect thereto in accordance
 with section fifty of this chapter, shall impose an  assessment  in  the
 sum of one thousand dollars for each ten day period of non-compliance or
 a  sum not in excess of two times the amount of the cost of compensation
 for its payroll for the period of such failure against the employer  and
 direct  its  payment  into  the  fund in connection with each such claim
 wherein injury shall have occurred on or after the first of  May,  nine-
 teen  hundred fifty-nine, or in death cases where death as the result of
 injury shall have occurred on or after said date.
  (c) If the employer shall fail to pay these assessments into the  fund
 within  ten days after date of mailing of notice thereof to [him or her]
 THEM, such default shall constitute a default in payment of compensation
 due pursuant to the provisions of section twenty-six of this article and
 judgment therefor shall be entered in accordance  therewith,  all  other
 provisions of said section to be deemed applicable with respect thereto,
 except  to  the  extent that said provisions may be clearly inconsistent
 with the provisions of this section. All sums collected  from  an  unin-
 sured employer with respect to any claim for compensation referred to in
 this  section but not payable from the fund, except fines collected from
 S. 7487  3
 
 such employer pursuant to section fifty-two of this chapter whether such
 collection is made prior or subsequent to entry of judgment against such
 employer, shall be deemed in payment of an applicable first in satisfac-
 tion  of  any  compensation  and  benefits  due  from such employer with
 respect to such claim and security demand, if any, in connection  there-
 with  and  only  when  such  obligations are satisfied in full shall the
 balance of said sums collected, if any, be deemed payment  in  satisfac-
 tion  of  and  applicable  to  the  assessments above prescribed in this
 section.
  (d) All sums recovered from uninsured employers on  judgments  entered
 for  failure to pay assessments as hereinbefore provided and for failure
 to pay compensation and benefits which were paid from  the  fund  herein
 created, shall upon such recovery be paid into said fund.
  (e)  All  awards  made on or after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-
 nine for every case of injury causing  death  for  which  there  are  no
 persons  entitled  to compensation, and where there are persons entitled
 to compensation but the total amount of such compensation is  less  than
 two  or  five  thousand  dollars as the case may be exclusive of funeral
 benefits, pursuant to the provisions of  subdivision  three  of  section
 twenty-five-a  of  this article shall be paid into the uninsured employ-
 ers' fund.
  (f) As promptly as practicable  after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
 ninety-one  and annually thereafter as soon as practicable after January
 first in each succeeding year, the chair shall ascertain  the  condition
 of  the  uninsured employers' fund. The chair shall transfer to the fund
 out of the moneys collected pursuant to subdivision two of  section  one
 hundred  fifty-one  of  this  chapter an amount which will raise the net
 cash assets of the fund to the level of either the amount spent  by  the
 fund  in  the  prior year, or the amount estimated to be expended by the
 fund in the succeeding year, whichever  is  greater,  except  that  such
 requirement shall not apply between August first, two thousand eight and
 August first, two thousand fifteen to the extent that section fifty-a of
 this chapter permits the fund to be at a different level.
  3.  The commissioner of taxation and finance shall be the custodian of
 the uninsured employers' fund and shall invest any surplus moneys there-
 of in securities which constitute legal investments  for  savings  banks
 under  the  laws  of  this state and in interest bearing certificates of
 deposit of a bank or trust company located and authorized to do business
 in this state or of a national bank located in this state secured  by  a
 pledge of direct obligations of the United States or of the state of New
 York,  or in accordance with the provisions of section ninety-eight-a of
 the state finance law, in an amount equal to the amount of such  certif-
 icates of deposit, and may sell any of the securities or certificates of
 deposit  in  which  such  fund  is invested, if necessary for the proper
 administration or in the best interest of such fund. Disbursements  from
 such  fund as provided by this section shall be paid by the commissioner
 of taxation and finance upon vouchers signed by the [chairman] CHAIR.
  The commissioner of taxation and finance, as custodian of  such  fund,
 as  soon  as  practicable after August first, nineteen hundred sixty-two
 and annually thereafter, shall furnish to the [chairman]  CHAIR  of  the
 board  a  statement  of the fund, setting forth the balance of moneys in
 the said fund as of the time of the preceding statement, the  income  of
 the  fund,  a  summary of payments out of the fund on account of compen-
 sation ordered to be paid therefrom by  the  board,  medical  and  other
 expenses,  and  all  other  charges  against the fund in the interim and
 setting forth the balance of the fund remaining to its credit as of  the
 S. 7487  4

 end of the period being reported. Such statement shall be open to public
 inspection  in  the  office  of the [chairman] CHAIR, and a copy thereof
 shall be transmitted by the [chairman] CHAIR to  the  superintendent  of
 financial services. The superintendent of financial services may examine
 into  the  condition  of such fund at any time on [his] THEIR own initi-
 ative or on request of the [chairman] CHAIR. [He] THEY shall verify  the
 receipts  and disbursements of the fund, and shall ascertain the liabil-
 ity of the fund upon all cases in which awards of compensation have been
 made and charged against said fund and shall render  a  report  of  such
 facts  to the [chairman] CHAIR. Such report shall also be open to public
 inspection in the office of the [chairman] CHAIR.
  4. Upon notice to the representative of the fund, the board, if in its
 discretion it deems the interests of the fund will be best served there-
 by, may compromise the  amount  for  which  judgment  has  been  entered
 against  an  employer  pursuant to this section and the judgment entered
 may be modified accordingly. Such compromise shall be effective  without
 the  necessity  of  obtaining  the  approval of any other state official
 thereto, but shall not reduce the amount of benefits payable  to  or  on
 behalf of any claimant under this section.
  5. The [chairman] CHAIR of the [workmen's] WORKERS' compensation board
 shall  appoint  an  employee of the board who is an attorney at law duly
 admitted to practice in the state of New York to serve as the  represen-
 tative of the fund created under this section and shall assign to assist
 [him]  SUCH  ATTORNEY  in  the  discharge  of [his] THEIR duties as such
 representative under the provisions of this section, such other  employ-
 ees  of  the  board  as  the  [chairman]  CHAIR deems necessary for this
 purpose. Such representative may  apply  to  the  [chairman]  CHAIR  for
 authority  to  hire  such  medical  and  other experts and to defray the
 expense thereof and of such witnesses  as  are  necessary  to  a  proper
 defense  of  the claim within an amount in the discretion of the [chair-
 man] CHAIR and, if authorized, such amount shall  be  a  charge  against
 said  fund.  The representative of the fund may appear for and represent
 the interest of the fund in any case in court involving  the  rights  of
 the  fund  against  another  not  in the same employ as the employee who
 received benefits under this chapter  and  whose  injury  or  death  was
 caused by the negligence or wrong of such other.
  6.  Whenever  it  appears, in a claim for benefits under this chapter,
 that the employer may have failed to secure the payment of  compensation
 in  accordance  with  section  fifty  of this chapter, the fund shall be
 given notice of all  proceedings  in  the  claim.  In  such  event,  the
 provisions  of  this  chapter with respect to procedure, the right to be
 heard and the right to apply to the board  for  review  of  a  referee's
 decision  and to appeal to the courts shall be reserved to the claimant,
 to the uninsured employer, and to the fund. Upon the application of  the
 representative of the fund for a modification or rescission or review of
 an award, the board may review any award, decision or order and, on such
 review,  may affirm, reverse, or modify any decision or award as the law
 and the facts may require, or take such other action as may  be  in  the
 interest  of justice. An appeal to the appellate division of the supreme
 court, third department, or to the court of appeals shall not operate as
 a stay of the payments by the uninsured employer or by the fund  of  the
 compensation required by the terms of the award or of the payment of the
 doctor's  bills  found  to  be  fair and reasonable. Where such award is
 reduced or rescinded upon appeal, the uninsured employer  or  the  fund,
 whichever  made  payment,  shall  be  entitled to reimbursement in a sum
 equal to the compensation in dispute paid by such party to the  respond-
 S. 7487  5
 
 ent  pending  adjudication of the appeal, and, if the claim for workers'
 compensation is disallowed, to a sum equal to the amount of the doctor's
 bills paid by such party pending  adjudication  of  the  appeal.  Such
 reimbursement  shall be paid from administration expenses as provided in
 section one hundred fifty-one of this chapter upon vouchers approved  by
 the chair. To the extent of any reimbursement to the fund, the uninsured
 employer  shall  be entitled to reimbursement from the fund for payments
 made into the fund in accordance with subdivision one of this section.
  6-a. In the event that the board is unable to determine  the  identity
 of the responsible insurance carrier for the employer within thirty days
 of the filing of a new claim, the board shall:
  (a)  appoint  the  uninsured  employers' fund as the responsible party
 until such time as the identity of the responsible insurance carrier for
 the employer is determined. Upon such appointment, the uninsured employ-
 ers' fund shall immediately commence payments and provide  medical  care
 in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;
  (b)  schedule  a  hearing to determine the identity of the responsible
 insurance carrier for the employer  and  to  determine  such  claim  for
 compensation  in  accordance  with  the provisions of subdivision one of
 this section; and
  (c) provide notice of such claim and hearing to the employer by certi-
 fied mail, return receipt requested, with a direction that the  employer
 provide  proof  of having insurance in effect as provided by section ten
 of this article.
  7. All the rights, powers, and benefits of the employer under  section
 twenty-nine  of  this  [chapter] ARTICLE shall become the rights, powers
 and benefits of the fund in any case in which the fund has  paid  or  is
 paying  compensation  to  an  injured employee or [his] THEIR dependents
 under this section. If the employer has also paid compensation to or  on
 behalf  of  the  injured employee or [his] THEIR dependents in such case
 any recovery by the fund pursuant to subdivision one of section  twenty-
 nine  OF  THIS ARTICLE shall first be applied to repayment of any awards
 paid by the fund to or on behalf of the injured employee or [his]  THEIR
 dependents  in  such  case,  the balance then applied to any outstanding
 unsatisfied demand for security in said  case  and  assessments  imposed
 against  the  employer  pursuant  to the provisions of this section, the
 remainder, if any, to be returned to the employer.  If the employer  has
 also  paid compensation to or on behalf of the injured employee or [his]
 THEIR dependents in such case, that portion, if any, of  a  recovery  by
 the  fund  pursuant  to  subdivision  two of section twenty-nine OF THIS
 ARTICLE which is in excess of the total amount of  compensation  awarded
 to  or  on behalf of such injured employee or [his] THEIR dependents and
 the reasonable and necessary expenditures  incurred  in  effecting  such
 recovery  shall  be  apportioned  between  the injured employee or [his]
 THEIR dependents and the fund in the manner provided in said subdivision
 two.  The balance of said recovery shall first be applied  to  reimburse
 the fund for its reasonable and necessary expenditures in effecting such
 recovery  and  the  remainder shall be applied to repayment of any award
 paid by the fund to or on behalf of the injured employee or [his]  THEIR
 dependents in such case. If there still remains a balance it shall first
 be  applied  to the outstanding unsatisfied demand for security, if any,
 in said case and assessments,  if  any,  imposed  against  the  employer
 pursuant to the provisions of this section; the remainder, if any, to be
 returned to the employer.
  7-a.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of section twenty-nine of
 this article to the contrary, a compromise by the claimant  of  [his  or
 S. 7487  6

 her]  THEIR  cause of action as set forth in said section twenty-nine of
 this article, in an amount less than the sum paid to or on behalf of the
 claimant from the uninsured employers' fund, shall be made only with the
 written consent of the chair.
  8. The provisions of this section with respect to the liability of the
 uninsured  employers'  fund  to  pay awards against uninsured defaulting
 employers shall apply only to claims wherein the injury shall  occur  on
 or after the first day of October, nineteen hundred sixty-two, or where-
 in  death  shall  occur as the result of an injury sustained on or after
 the aforesaid first day of October.
  9. The [chairman] CHAIR may make reasonable regulations for the  proc-
 essing and payment of compensation out of the uninsured employers' fund.
  10.  The  liability of the [chairman] CHAIR, the commissioner of taxa-
 tion and finance, the fund and the state of New  York  with  respect  to
 payment  of  any compensation, benefits, expenses, fees or disbursements
 properly chargeable against  the  uninsured  employers'  fund  shall  be
 limited  to  the assets in said fund and they shall not otherwise in any
 way or manner be liable for the making of any such payment.
  11. All assessments payable pursuant to the provisions of this section
 shall be liens against the assets of the employer liable therefor  with-
 out  limit  of  amount, subordinate, however, to claims for unpaid wages
 and prior recorded liens.
  12. Whenever the term employer is used in this  section  it  shall  be
 deemed to include without limitation a contractor liable for the payment
 of  compensation pursuant to section fifty-six of [the workmen's compen-
 sation law] THIS CHAPTER.
  13. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in  any  case
 of  injury  or death to the president, secretary, treasurer or any other
 officer charged with the obligation of obtaining  workers'  compensation
 insurance,  of  a  corporation,  any  awards  of compensation or medical
 expenses payable to or on behalf of  such  officer  or  to  [his]  THEIR
 surviving  spouse, children and dependents as defined by section sixteen
 of this article made against the corporation as  an  uninsured  employer
 solely because of the injury or death of such officer, shall in no event
 be the liability of the uninsured employers' fund and shall not be paya-
 ble therefrom.
  14.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this chapter, in any case
 of injury or death to a self-employed person or to a partner of a  part-
 nership  as defined in section ten of the partnership law, any awards of
 compensation or medical expenses payable to or on behalf of  such  self-
 employed  person or partner of a partnership or to [his] THEIR surviving
 spouse, children and dependents as defined by section  sixteen  of  this
 article made against the self-employed person or partnership as an unin-
 sured  employer  solely  because of the injury or death of such self-em-
 ployed person or partner, shall in no event  be  the  liability  of  the
 uninsured employers' fund and shall not be payable therefrom.
  15.  NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS CHAPTER, IN ANY CASE
 OF INJURY OR DEATH TO A SELF-EMPLOYED PERSON OR TO A MEMBER OF A LIMITED
 LIABILITY COMPANY AS DEFINED IN SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWO OF  THE  LIMITED
 LIABILITY  COMPANY  LAW,  ANY AWARDS OF COMPENSATION OR MEDICAL EXPENSES
 PAYABLE TO OR ON BEHALF OF SUCH SELF-EMPLOYED  PERSON  OR  MEMBER  OF  A
 LIMITED  LIABILITY  COMPANY  OR  TO THEIR SURVIVING SPOUSE, CHILDREN AND
 DEPENDENTS AS DEFINED BY SECTION SIXTEEN OF THIS  ARTICLE  MADE  AGAINST
 THE  SELF-EMPLOYED  PERSON  OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AS AN UNINSURED
 EMPLOYER SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE INJURY OR  DEATH  OF  SUCH  SELF-EMPLOYED
 S. 7487  7
 
 PERSON  OR  MEMBER,  SHALL IN NO EVENT BE THE LIABILITY OF THE UNINSURED
 EMPLOYERS' FUND AND SHALL NOT BE PAYABLE THEREFROM.
  §  2. Section 52 of the workers' compensation law, as amended by chap-
 ter 6 of the laws of 2007, subdivision 5 as amended  by  section  19  of
 part  GG  of  chapter  57  of  the  laws  of 2013, is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 52. Effect of failure to secure  compensation.  1.  (a)  Failure  to
 secure  the  payment of compensation for five or less employees within a
 twelve month period shall constitute a misdemeanor, and is punishable by
 a fine of not less  than  one  thousand  nor  more  than  five  thousand
 dollars.  Failure  to secure the payment of compensation for more than
 five employees within a twelve month period shall constitute a  class  E
 felony,  and  is  punishable  by  a  fine of not less than five thousand
 dollars nor more than fifty thousand dollars in addition  to  any  other
 penalties  otherwise provided by law. It shall be an affirmative defense
 to any criminal prosecution under this section that  the  employer  took
 reasonable steps to secure compensation.
  (b)  Where  any  person  has previously been convicted of a failure to
 secure the payment of compensation within the preceding five years, upon
 conviction for a subsequent violation such person shall be guilty  of  a
 class D felony, and fined not less than ten thousand nor more than fifty
 thousand  dollars  in  addition  to  any other penalties including fines
 otherwise provided by law.
  (c) Where the employer is a corporation,  LIMITED  LIABILITY  COMPANY,
 LIMITED  LIABILITY  PARTNERSHIP OR PARTNERSHIP, the president, secretary
 [and], treasurer, MEMBER OR MEMBERS  AND  PARTNER  OR  PARTNERS  thereof
 shall  be liable for failure to secure the payment of compensation under
 this section. It shall be an affirmative defense to any  action  against
 any  officer  of a corporation, MEMBER OF A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR
 PARTNER OF A LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP  OR  PARTNERSHIP  under  this
 section  that  the  officer,  MEMBER OR PARTNER took reasonable steps to
 ensure that the corporation, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, LIMITED  LIABIL-
 ITY  PARTNERSHIP OR PARTNERSHIP secured compensation, that proper inter-
 nal procedures were in  effect  to  do  so,  and  that  proper  internal
 controls existed to monitor compliance with said procedures.
  (d)  If  at  any  time an employer intentionally and materially under-
 states or conceals payroll, or intentionally  and  materially  misrepre-
 sents  or  conceals employee duties so as to avoid proper classification
 for calculation of premium paid to secure compensation, or intentionally
 and materially misrepresents or conceals information  pertinent  to  the
 calculation  of premium paid to secure compensation, such employer shall
 be deemed to have failed to secure compensation and shall be subject  to
 the sanctions applicable to this section.
  (e)  A  stop-work  order  issued because an employer is deemed to have
 failed to secure compensation under section one hundred  forty-one-a  of
 this  chapter  shall have no effect upon an employer's or carrier's duty
 to provide benefits under this chapter or upon any of the employer's  or
 carrier's rights and defenses.
  2.  All  fines  imposed under this chapter, except as herein otherwise
 provided, shall be paid directly  and  immediately  by  the  officer  OR
 MEMBER collecting the same to the [chairman] CHAIR, and shall be paid by
 [him]  THEM  into  the  uninsured  employers' fund created under section
 twenty-six-a of this chapter, provided, however,  that  all  such  fines
 collected  by  justices of towns and villages shall be paid to the state
 comptroller in accordance with the provisions of section twenty-seven of
 the town law and section 4-410 of the village law respectively.
 S. 7487  8
 
  3. In any prosecution hereunder the failure of the  employer  to  file
 with  the  [chairman]  CHAIR,  within ten days after demand, a statement
 subscribed by the employer and affirmed by [him] THEM as true under  the
 penalties  of  perjury  showing  specifically  (a) the name of the stock
 company, mutual corporation or reciprocal insurer in which such employer
 is  insured  and  the  number  and the date of issuance and term of such
 policy of insurance, or (b) that the said employer is insured  with  the
 state  fund in which case [he] THEY shall give the number of such policy
 of insurance, the date of issuance and term thereof,  or  (c)  that  the
 said  employer  has  been  authorized  to  do business as a self-insurer
 pursuant to section fifty of this  article,  giving  the  date  of  said
 authorization,  or  (d) a legal reason, if any, why said employer is not
 required to secure compensation, shall constitute prima  facie  evidence
 that  the employer has failed to secure compensation as herein required.
 The statement to be filed herein shall be subscribed by the employer  or
 if  the  employer  is  a corporation, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, LIMITED
 LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP OR PARTNERSHIP by one of the officers, MEMBERS  OR
 PARTNERS  herein named in which [he] THEY shall state that [he has] THEY
 HAVE read such statement subscribed by [him] THEM and knows the contents
 thereof and that same is true of [his] THEIR own knowledge.
  4. If, however, there has been an accident and the  board  shall  have
 made an award against the employer as a non-insured employer, the making
 of  such  award, except in a case where the employer had secured compen-
 sation insurance which was in effect at the time of the accident but the
 carrier later became insolvent, shall constitute prima facie evidence of
 an employment by the employer of an employee in an occupation  in  which
 the  said employer was required to carry compensation and of the failure
 of the employer to secure the payment of workers'  compensation  on  the
 date  of  the  accident involved in said award. A certified copy of such
 award shall be received as competent evidence of the making  thereof  in
 any criminal prosecution hereunder.
  5. The chair, upon finding that an employer has failed for a period of
 not  less than ten consecutive days to make the provision for payment of
 compensation required by section fifty of this article, may impose  upon
 such  employer, in addition to all other penalties, fines or assessments
 provided for in this chapter, a penalty of up to  two  thousand  dollars
 for  each ten day period of non-compliance or a sum not in excess of two
 times the cost of compensation for its payroll for the  period  of  such
 failure,  which  sum  shall  be  paid into the uninsured employers' fund
 created under section twenty-six-a of this  chapter.  When  an  employer
 fails  to  provide  business  records  sufficient to enable the chair to
 determine the employer's payroll for the period requested for the calcu-
 lation of the penalty provided  in  this  section,  the  imputed  weekly
 payroll  for each employee, corporate officer, sole proprietor, or part-
 ner shall be the New York state average weekly wage, multiplied by  1.5.
 Where  the employer is a corporation, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, LIMITED
 LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP OR PARTNERSHIP, the  president,  secretary  [and],
 treasurer,  MEMBER  AND PARTNER thereof shall be liable for the penalty.
 If the employer shall within thirty days after notice of the  imposition
 of  a penalty by the chair pursuant to this subdivision make an applica-
 tion in affidavit form for a redetermination review of such penalty  the
 chair  shall  make  a  decision  in writing on the issues raised on such
 application.
  § 3.  Subdivision 3 of section 131 of the workers'  compensation  law,
 as  added  by  chapter  6  of  the  laws  of 2007, is amended to read as
 follows:
 S. 7487  9
 
  (3) The chair, upon finding that an employer has failed to  keep  true
 and  accurate  records as required by this section, may impose upon such
 employer, in addition to  all  other  penalties,  fines  or  assessments
 provided  for  in  this  chapter,  one thousand dollars for each ten day
 period of non-compliance or a sum not in excess of two times the cost of
 compensation for its payroll for the period of such violation, which sum
 shall  be  paid into the uninsured employers' fund created under section
 twenty-six-a of this chapter. When an employer fails to provide business
 records sufficient to enable  the  chair  to  determine  the  employer's
 payroll  for  the  period  requested  for the calculation of the penalty
 provided in this section, the imputed weekly payroll for each  employee,
 corporate  officer, sole proprietor, MEMBER, or partner shall be the New
 York state average weekly wage, multiplied by 1.5. Where the employer is
 a corporation, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, LIMITED LIABILITY  PARTNERSHIP
 OR  PARTNERSHIP  the  corporation,  LIMITED  LIABILITY  COMPANY, LIMITED
 LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP OR PARTNERSHIP, and any of the following shall  be
 liable  for  the  penalty  provided  in this subdivision: the president,
