Sam's family, and where they continues to reside today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Both from  the  City  of  Schenectady,  Salvatore  Nicastro

  WHEREAS, Angeline Nicastro began working at  Ellis  Hospital  as  an
administrative  secretary  in 1962, and remained for 22 years; Salvatore

grandparents of nine grandchildren, three step-grandchildren,  and  four
great-grandchildren; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Their  devotion, caring, sensitivity and responsiveness to
their family, friends and all who  know  them  are  their  hallmark  and
tradition; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Mr. and Mrs. Salvatore Nicastro have lived and continue to
live  their  lives  with  great  dignity  and  genuine  grace,  always
demonstrating a deep and continuing concern for human values and ideals,
and in doing so, have inspired others to do the same; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  meaningful  occasion is the result of the love, hard
work and spirit this couple has invested in their marriage; and
 
  WHEREAS,  These  same  values  they have passed to their loved ones,
producing a family that is close-knit and supportive of  its  individual
members,  public-minded  in its relations to the community and committed
to the ideals of citizenship upon which this Nation was founded; and

marriage, which is a testament to the devotion and admiration which they
possess for one another; and
 
  WHEREAS, The longevity of  this  enduring  marriage  truly  marks  a
milestone in life's journey, an event of personal triumph and joy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the practice of this Legislative Body that when an
occasion of such importance is brought to our attention, the same should
be memorialized by us for the edification and emulation of others;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
congratulate Mr. and  Mrs.  Salvatore  Nicastro  upon  the  occasion  of
