  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  February 1-7, 2023, as Gun Violence  Survivors  Week
  in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Every  year,  more  than  36,000 Americans are killed as a
result of gun violence and 73,000 more are shot and wounded; and
 
  WHEREAS, More than 700 New Yorkers are killed and many more  injured
as a result of gun violence each year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  gun  violence  survivor  is  anyone  who has personally
experienced gun violence,  whether  as  a  witness  of  an  act  of  gun
violence,  someone  who  was  threatened  or  wounded with a gun or as a
family member or friend of someone who was wounded or killed as a result
of gun violence; and
 
  WHEREAS, Forms of gun violence can include, but are not limited  to,
gun  suicides,  gun  homicides,  domestic  violence  involving  a  gun,
shootings  by  law  enforcement,  mass  shootings  and  unintentional
shootings; and
 
  WHEREAS, Fifty-eight percent of American adults or someone they care
for  has  experienced  gun violence in their lifetime, demonstrating the
reach and impact gun violence has in all communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to the devastating human cost, every  year  gun
violence costs the American economy $229 billion; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  week  of  February  1  through February 7, 2023, is a
symbolic choice for Gun Violence Survivors Week for the reason  that  it
represents  the  time  by  early February when more Americans are killed
with guns than are killed in other high-income countries  in  an  entire
year; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Moms Demand Action started as a community of moms and dads
working together to address gun violence in response to the  Sandy  Hook
tragedy that occurred in Connecticut on December 14, 2012; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, Moms Demand Action is a national network of parents,
families,  students and concerned citizens dedicated to keeping families
safe,  encouraging  responsible  gun  ownership  and  advocating  for
common-sense gun safety legislation; and
 
  WHEREAS, Moms Demand Action, along with Mayors Against Illegal Guns,
Students  Demand  Action  and the Everytown Survivor Network, is part of
Everytown  for  Gun  Safety,  the  largest  gun  violence  prevention
organization  in  the  country,  with  nearly  6  million supporters and
350,000 donors; and
 
  WHEREAS, Everytown  for  Gun  Safety  is  joined  by  several  other
national  nonprofit  organizations,  including  the  Brady  Campaign and
Gifford's Law Center, in the pursuit to end gun violence in America; and
 
  WHEREAS, By recognizing Gun Violence Survivors Week, New York  State
joins  communities  across America to raise awareness about gun violence
and honor the lives lost; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim February 1-7, 2023, as Gun
Violence Survivors Week in the State of New York,  in  conjunction  with
the  observance  of  National  Gun  Violence  Survivors  Week; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
