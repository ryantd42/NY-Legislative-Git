women who suffered from tuberculosis; and
 
  WHEREAS, Located on the banks of the  Hudson  River  just  65  miles

meritorious veterans of the Hudson Valley; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The success of Castle Point VA Medical Center is in direct
correlation to the efforts of its leadership,  board  of  directors  and
staff,  whose  involvement  is, and always has been, characterized by an
impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and  an  uncompromising
standard of excellence in all endeavors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Venerable  and  trustworthy  institutions,  tending to the
needs of the community and its citizenry,  represent  the  threads  from
which the fabric of society is woven; and

good works of health care institutions, sharing the pride of its history
and accomplishments, and anticipating its future of continued growth  in
quality and personalized care; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
