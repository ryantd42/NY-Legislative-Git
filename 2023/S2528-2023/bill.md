 AN ACT to amend the criminal procedure law, in relation to  the  removal
  of a criminal action to a veterans treatment court
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature  finds  and  declares
 that New York, along with the rest of the country, owes an enduring debt
 to the brave men and women who have served in our nation's armed forces.
 Their  service  in  defense  of our country and its ideals must never be
 forgotten. We also must not fail to recognize that when veterans  return
 from  foreign  conflicts their transition to civilian life is not always
 an easy one and can be marked  by  depression,  other  forms  of  mental
 illness  and  substance  abuse.  Studies  have  shown  that the trauma a
 soldier suffers while deployed is a major  contributing  factor  to  low
 level, but often persistent, criminal activity.
  New  York  stands in the vanguard for treating veterans whose criminal
 conduct is linked to their military service. In 2008, the nation's first
 veterans treatment court was started  in  the  Buffalo  city  court.  By
 recognizing the root causes of many veterans' contacts with the criminal
 justice  system  and  applying  proven  resources, including counseling,
 treatment for drug or alcohol addiction, hands-on assistance with  hous-
 ing  needs and job training and placement, we have led the way in reduc-
 ing recidivism among returning veterans. Starting with that single court
 in Buffalo, the veterans treatment court has become the model  for  many
 other  states.  While  New York now has twenty veterans treatment courts
 and at least two additional courts in the planning stage, not all of New
 York's veterans live in a jurisdiction that currently has such a  court.
 We can do better.
  In  order  to broaden the availability of veterans treatment courts to
 qualified veterans, this act would authorize the transfer of a  criminal

 case  against  a  qualified veteran whose charges are pending in a local
 criminal court that is not a veterans treatment court to  another  local
 criminal  court  within  the  same  county  that is a veterans treatment
 court.  Following  the successful "drug hub court" model, the case could
 only be transferred on the application of the defendant,  and  with  the
 consent  of  the  court and district attorney. Recognizing that resource
 constraints and the need for extensive planning and  coordination  among
 the  judiciary  and  local,  state and federal agencies have limited the
 availability of veterans treatment courts in  certain  jurisdictions  in
 the  state,  this measure also would permit a qualified veteran to apply
 to have his or her criminal case transferred  to  a  veterans  treatment
 court  located  in  an  adjoining  county. This will ensure the broadest
 possible reach of every existing veterans treatment court,  and  send  a
 signal  that  New York and its courts are committed to acknowledging and
 serving the special needs of the greatest number of qualified  veterans.
 In  practical  terms,  the  act  would  immediately more than double the
 number of counties where veterans charged with criminal  offenses  would
 have access to the proven benefits of a veterans treatment court.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 180.20 of the criminal procedure law, as
 amended  by  chapter  67  of  the  laws  of  2000, is amended to read as
 follows:
  3. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the  contrary,  in
 any  county  outside  a city having a population of one million or more,
 upon or after arraignment of a defendant on a felony  complaint  pending
 in  a local criminal court having preliminary jurisdiction thereof, such
 court may, upon motion of the defendant and  with  the  consent  of  the
 district  attorney,  order  that the action be removed from the court in
 which the matter is pending to another local criminal court in the  same
 county which has been designated a drug court by the chief administrator
 of  the  courts,  OR TO ANOTHER COURT IN THE SAME COUNTY OR AN ADJOINING
 COUNTY THAT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED A VETERANS TREATMENT COURT BY THE  CHIEF
 ADMINISTRATOR  OF  THE COURTS, and such drug court OR VETERANS TREATMENT
 COURT may then dispose of such felony complaint pursuant to  this  arti-
 cle;  provided,  however,  that  an  order  of removal issued under this
 subdivision shall not take effect until five days  after  the  date  the
 order  is issued unless, prior to such effective date, the drug court OR
 VETERANS TREATMENT COURT notifies the court that issued the order that:
  (a) it will not accept the action, in which event the order shall  not
 take effect, or
  (b)  it will accept the action on a date prior to such effective date,
 in which event the order shall take effect upon such prior date.
  Upon providing notification pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b)  of  this
 subdivision,  the  drug court OR VETERANS TREATMENT COURT shall promptly
 give notice to the defendant, his or her counsel and the district attor-
 ney.
  § 3. To the extent practicable, the chief administrator of the  courts
 shall  establish  such  number  of  veterans  treatment courts as may be
 necessary to fulfill the purposes of this act.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
