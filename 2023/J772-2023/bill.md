  COMMEMORATING  the  61st  Anniversary  of  the
  Independence of Trinidad and Tobago
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and
pay  just  tribute  to  the cultural heritage of the ethnic groups which
comprise and contribute to the richness and diversity of  the  community
of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and  in  keeping  with  its
time-honored traditions, it is the intent of this  Legislative  Body  to
commemorate  the  61st  Anniversary  of the Independence of Trinidad and
Tobago; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  celebration  of  Trinidad  and  Tobago's  independence
affirms  the  culture, identity and self-esteem of a people; it honors a
rich  heritage  and  illuminates  Trinidad  and  Tobago's  history  and
tradition, as well as the spirit of an indomitable people; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The people of this great State and nation and Trinidad and
Tobago enjoy a deep and  abiding  relationship  rooted  in  kinship  and
culture,  and many New Yorkers proudly trace their own roots to Trinidad
and Tobago; and
 
  WHEREAS, Trinidad and Tobago were one  of  those  countries  in  the
British  colony  that  became  a  part  of  the post war, decolonization
process; the country was granted their independence on August 31,  1962;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Christopher  Columbus discovered Trinidad in 1498, and the
country became a colony of Spain; Tobago was first invaded by the  Dutch
and later saw the French invasion with Spain as its ally; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Later,  British colonists settled in Trinidad in 1802, and
in Tobago in 1814; it was in 1888 that both  Trinidad  and  Tobago  were
made  a single entity; this country was prone to colonization because of
its rich minerals and crude oil; and
 
  WHEREAS, However, this country, with a history of  so  many  nations
trying  to  colonize  its  inhabitants,  had  taken a toll on the common
people; the independence of Trinidad and Tobago brought a sigh of relief
to its native people; and
 
  WHEREAS, The 61st Anniversary of Trinidad and Tobago's  Independence
provides  an  opportunity  to  recognize  the  significance  of  their
contributions to the quality and character of life, and, through  events
and  activities,  for  all  people  to  gain  a  greater appreciation of
Trinidad  and  Tobago's  history  and  traditions,  and  of  the  role
Trinidadians have played, and will continue to play, in our society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative Body is pleased to have this opportunity
to recognize such events of significance which foster ethnic  pride  and
exemplify  the  cultural  diversity  that represents and strengthens the
fabric of the people and the State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 61st Anniversary of the  Independence  of  Trinidad  and
Tobago.
