 AN  ACT to amend the general city law, in relation to requiring contrac-
  tors in certain cities to recycle  construction  and  demolition  site
  waste
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative intent. The purpose of this act is to  signif-
 icantly  reduce the amount of waste produced by construction and demoli-
 tion activities in cities having populations of  one  million  or  more.
 There  are  many  opportunities  to  reduce  or  recycle  materials from
 construction  and  demolition,  including  metals,  cardboard,  drywall,
 glass,  wood and asphalt. This act is consistent with the goals of large
 cities' solid waste management plans, complementing other recycling  and
 recovery programs currently in effect.
  §  2.  The general city law is amended by adding a new section 23-a to
 read as follows:
  § 23-A.  CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION SITE  WASTE  RECYCLING;  CERTAIN
 CITIES. 1. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN THIS SECTION:

 WHICH A PERMIT IS REQUIRED.
  B.  "CONSTRUCTION  AND  DEMOLITION  DEBRIS"  SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE
 LIMITED TO, METALS, CARDBOARD, DRYWALL, GLASS, WOOD, CONCRETE, BRICK AND

 LEAD, ASBESTOS OR ANY OTHER HAZARDOUS MATERIAL SUCH THAT RECYCLING THER-
 EOF WOULD BE ILLEGAL OR UNFEASIBLE.
