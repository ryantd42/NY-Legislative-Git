  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
those established organizations within our communities that, year  after

and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate  the  1st  Anniversary  of  Superstars  on  the  Spectrum,
celebrated at an event on Friday, May 5, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  LaShawna  Brown  is  a  passionate educator and founder of
Superstars on  the  Spectrum,  a  groundbreaking  online  magazine  that
provides resources and highlights children and young adults with special
needs on their capabilities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  an educator for over 10 years within the New York City
school system, LaShawna Brown has been devoted to  the  empowerment  and
enrichment  of  youth,  and  as  a  mother of three, she has always been
dedicated to providing the best possible support and resources  for  her
children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When  her  son  was  diagnosed with autism, LaShawna Brown
realized there  was  a  major  gap  in  the  information  and  resources
available for families of children with special needs, especially in the
Black and Brown community; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  inspired  LaShawna Brown to launch Superstars on the
Spectrum and create a space that regardless of their  disabilities,  her
son  and  others  like him could feel seen and celebrated; additionally,
she wanted to offer a sense of community and support for caregivers  and
parents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through her tireless efforts, LaShawna Brown has developed
Superstars on the Spectrum into a platform that provides information and
support, while highlighting the capabilities of young  individuals  with
special needs; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Drawing from LaShawna Brown's own personal experiences and
leveraging the knowledge of experts in the field, the online magazine is
a resource for parents, caregivers, and educators; through her magazine,
she is able to share her son's  story  with  the  world,  highlight  the
advocates  that  fight for disability justice, and raise awareness about
the challenges and triumphs of living with autism; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition to her work with the magazine,  LaShawna  Brown
is  active  with  numerous  organizations  and supports her community in
various capacities; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
organizations  of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to our
 
attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by all the  citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 1st Anniversary of Superstars on the Spectrum; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
