  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to  commemorate
and  increase  awareness  of  issues  that  are  of  significance to the
citizens of this great nation and Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  2023,  as  Sexual
Assault  Awareness  Month  in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of National Sexual Assault Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sexual assault and sexual harassment harm our  communities,
with  statistics  showing  that every 68 seconds an American is sexually
assaulted, and every nine minutes that victim is a child; and
 
  WHEREAS, Only 25 out of every 1,000 perpetrators will serve time  in
prison for their criminal act; and
 
  WHEREAS,  1  out  of  every  6  American women and 1 out of every 33
American men have experienced an attempted or completed  rape  in  their
life; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  majority  of  child  victims are aged 12-17; of victims
under the age of 18, 34% of victims of sexual assault and rape are under
the age of 12, and 66% of victims of sexual assault and rape are  12-17;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  13%  of all undergraduate and graduate students experience
rape  or  sexual  assault  through  physical  force,  violence,  or
incapacitation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  We  must  work  together  to educate our communities about
sexual  violence  prevention,  supporting  survivors  and  speaking  out
against harmful attitudes and actions which condone sexual assault; and
 
  WHEREAS,  When  we  actively  get  involved  we  can  prevent sexual
violence by increasing education, awareness and  community  involvement;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is time to create a safer environment in the workplace,
the community and the world for all; and
 
  WHEREAS, April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month and each day of the
year is an opportunity to create change for the future; and
 
  WHEREAS, Sexual assault is a horrific criminal  act  which  deserves
the attention of this Legislative Body; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to  proclaim  April  2023,  as  Sexual
Assault Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
