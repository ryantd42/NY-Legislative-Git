 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  environmental  conservation law, in relation to
  establishing the "pollution justice act" and implementing  a  plan  to
  replace peaker plants with renewable energy systems
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "pollution
 justice act".
  §  2.  Article  19 of the environmental conservation law is amended by
 adding a new title 13 to read as follows:
  TITLE 13
  PEAKER PLANTS
 SECTION 19-1301. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
  19-1303. DEFINITIONS.
  19-1305. MANDATORY REPLACEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PLAN.
  19-1307. EXTENSIONS FOR CAUSE.
  19-1309. PROHIBITIONS.
  19-1311. EXEMPTIONS.
 § 19-1301. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
  1. ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS THAT GENERALLY OPERATE DURING PERIODS  OF
 PEAK  ELECTRICITY  DEMAND ARE KNOWN AS PEAKER PLANTS. MANY PEAKER PLANTS
 IN THE STATE ARE OLDER FOSSIL  FUEL-FIRED  UNITS  THAT  EMIT  GREENHOUSE
 GASES  AND  A  VARIETY  OF OTHER HARMFUL AIR POLLUTANTS INCLUDING SULFUR
 OXIDES, NITROGEN OXIDES, PARTICULATES AND MERCURY.
  2. A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEAKER PLANTS ARE LOCATED IN OR ADJACENT TO
 DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND LONG  ISLAND  THAT
 ALREADY  BEAR  DISPROPORTIONATE  POLLUTION  BURDENS  DUE TO A HISTORY OF
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 SITING POLLUTION SOURCES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. MORE THAN ONE MILLION NEW
 YORKERS LIVE WITHIN ONE MILE OF A PEAKER PLANT.
  3.  POLLUTANTS  FROM  PEAKER  PLANTS  CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC
 HEALTH PROBLEMS. ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND
 MENTAL HYGIENE'S AIR POLLUTION AND THE HEALTH  OF  NEW  YORKERS  REPORT:
 "EACH  YEAR,  PM2.5  POLLUTION IN (NEW YORK CITY) CAUSES MORE THAN 3,000
 DEATHS, 2,000 HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR LUNG  AND  HEART  CONDITIONS,  AND
 APPROXIMATELY  6,000  EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS FOR ASTHMA IN CHILDREN
 AND ADULTS."  ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, EACH  YEAR  EXPOSURES  TO  OZONE
 CONCENTRATIONS ABOVE BACKGROUND LEVELS CAUSE AN ESTIMATED "400 PREMATURE
 DEATHS,  850  HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR ASTHMA AND 4,500 EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
 VISITS FOR ASTHMA."
  4. PEAKER PLANTS OFTEN OPERATE DURING SUMMER MONTHS WHEN AIR POLLUTION
 LEVELS ARE HIGHEST AND THEIR EMISSIONS ADD TO EXISTING POLLUTION BURDENS
 IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN
 THOSE COMMUNITIES FROM AIR POLLUTION.
  5. THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF PEAKER PLANTS HAVE RECEIVED BILLIONS OF
 DOLLARS IN CAPACITY PAYMENTS FROM RATEPAYERS OVER  THE  LAST  DECADE  TO
 SUBSIDIZE  OPERATION  OF  THEIR PLANTS, EVEN THOUGH THE PLANTS PRIMARILY
 OPERATE DURING PEAK LOAD PERIODS.
  6. FOSSIL FUEL-BURNING PEAKER PLANTS CAN BE  REPLACED  WITH  RENEWABLE
 ENERGY SYSTEMS THAT WILL ELIMINATE OR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE AIR POLLUTION
 IMPACTS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FROM PEAKER PLANT OPERATIONS.
  7.  REPLACEMENT  OF  FOSSIL  FUEL-BURNING PEAKER PLANTS WITH RENEWABLE
 ENERGY SYSTEMS IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, WILL SAVE MILLIONS OF  DOLLARS
 IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH-RELATED DAMAGES, WILL PROMOTE ENVIRON-
 MENTAL  JUSTICE  AND  WILL ASSIST IN MEETING THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION
 REDUCTION AND ENERGY STORAGE GOALS OF THE CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND  COMMU-
 NITY PROTECTION ACT.
 § 19-1303. DEFINITIONS.
  1. "ADJACENT TO" SHALL MEAN WITHIN A RADIUS OF ONE MILE FROM THE PLANT
 PROPERTY BOUNDARY.
  2.  "DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY" SHALL HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS IN SUBDI-
 VISION FIVE OF SECTION 75-0101 OF THIS CHAPTER.
  3. "OPERATING PERMIT" SHALL HAVE THE MEANING SET FORTH IN  SUBDIVISION
 EIGHTEEN OF SECTION 19-0107 OF THIS ARTICLE.
  4.  "RENEWABLE  ENERGY  SYSTEMS"  SHALL  HAVE THE MEANING SET FORTH IN
 SECTION SIXTY-SIX-P OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE LAW AND MAY ALSO INCLUDE  FIRM
 ZERO EMISSION RESOURCES SUCH AS LONG-DURATION ENERGY STORAGE.
  5.  "REPLACE" OR "REPLACEMENT" MEANS THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF
 A RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM, BATTERY OR ENERGY  STORAGE,  OR  TRANSMISSION
 AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENABLES THE PROVISION OF THE EQUIV-
 ALENT  MAXIMUM  ANNUAL  POWER  OUTPUT ACHIEVED BY THE REPLACEABLE PEAKER
 PLANT DURING  ANY  SINGLE  YEAR  DURING  THE  TEN  YEARS  PRECEDING  THE
 SUBMISSION OF AN APPLICATION TO RENEW AN OPERATING PERMIT.
  6. "REPLACEABLE PEAKER PLANT" MEANS A MAJOR ELECTRIC GENERATING FACIL-
 ITY  AS  DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH B OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION 19-0312 OF
 THIS ARTICLE THAT BURNS COAL, OIL, DIESEL OR NATURAL GAS AND WAS  OPERA-
 TIONAL  AND  GENERATED ELECTRICITY LESS THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE YEAR
 DURING AT LEAST TWO YEARS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THROUGH TWO  THOU-
 SAND TWENTY AND THAT IS LOCATED IN OR ADJACENT TO A DISADVANTAGED COMMU-
 NITY.
 § 19-1305. MANDATORY REPLACEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PLAN.

 INFORM THE OWNER OR OPERATOR OF THE REPLACEABLE PEAKER PLANT IN  WRITING
 OF  THE  REASONS FOR SUCH DISAPPROVAL AND SHALL IDENTIFY THE PORTIONS OF
 THE DISAPPROVED PLAN THAT NEED TO BE MODIFIED.  THE  OWNER  OR  OPERATOR
 SHALL  SUBMIT A MODIFIED PLAN WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF RECEIVING THE DEPART-
