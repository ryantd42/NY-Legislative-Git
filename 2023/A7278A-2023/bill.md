 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the application for disability retirement  benefits  of  Andrew  Reilly,
 Jr.,  who  was  employed as a clerk for the town of Hempstead Sanitation
 District 1 and a member of the  New  York  state  and  local  employees'
 retirement  system  from  March  1995 until October 15, 2020, suffered a
 stroke on February 20, 2020 and who, for reasons not ascribable  to  his
 own negligence, did not apply to the New York state and local employees'
 retirement  system  for  disability  retirement  benefits because of the
 COVID-19, novel coronavirus state of emergency, shall be deemed to  have
 applied to the New York state and local employees' retirement system for
 disability  retirement  benefits  within  30  days  of his disability on
 February 20, 2020.
  § 2. All costs associated with the implementation of this act shall be
 borne by the employers of the members of the New York  state  and  local
 employees' retirement system.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would deem Andrew Reilly Jr. to have applied to the New York
 State  and  Local  Employees' Retirement System (NYSLERS) for disability
 benefits within thirty days of their disability on February 20, 2020.
  If this bill is enacted  during  the  2023  legislative  session,  and
 Andrew  Reilly  Jr.  is  subsequently  approved  for disability benefits
 pursuant to section 605 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of approximately  $222,000  which
