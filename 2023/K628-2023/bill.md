  WHEREAS, The history of the First United Methodist  Church  of  East
Greenbush  is long and varied in service to the community and the world;
and

church; and
 
  WHEREAS, The First United Methodist Church continued to grow, and on
February  9,  1969,  Fellowship  Hall  and  additional  classrooms  were
dedicated;  on  June 1, 1970, a beautiful pipe organ was dedicated; from

congregation's worship experience; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, its Memorial Courtyard  provides  a  place  of
beauty and serenity for peaceful meditation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its inception, the First United Methodist Church of
