 GATION, COMPUTER DATABASES, AND RECORDS OF DETENTION  PURSUANT  TO  THAT

 RELEASES INFORMATION ORDERED EXPUNGED, IS GUILTY OF A CLASS B  MISDEMEA-
 NOR.  A PERSON, WHO, KNOWING THE RECORDS ARE EXPUNGED, USES THE INFORMA-
 TION  FOR FINANCIAL GAIN, OR WILLFUL DESTRUCTION OF A PERSON'S CHARACTER
 IS GUILTY OF A CLASS D FELONY.
