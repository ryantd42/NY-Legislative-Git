  COMMEMORATING the 230th Anniversary of the Town of
  Cazenovia, New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate  the  distinguished  histories  of  the  communities  which
comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate  the  230th  Anniversary of the Town of Cazenovia, New York;
this milestone was recognized on Saturday, January 21, 2023, during  the
kickoff  event to Cazenovia Heritage's "Caz230," a year-long celebration
of 230 years of Cazenovia's industry and  innovation,  highlighting  the
community's rich inventory of historic architectural styles; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Established  in  2021,  Cazenovia  Heritage is a community
organization which seeks to  conserve  the  area's  cultural  resources,
including  the  historic architecture, neighborhoods, sites, and objects
that contribute to the town's unique sense of place and character; and
 
  WHEREAS, The schedule of events also includes walking tours  focused
on  the  architecture  of Cazenovia churches, Albany Street, porches and
porticos; self-guided tours of Cazenovia homes and schoolhouses; on-site
programs at a local barn and the historic Farnham  Cemetery;  children's
programs;  an  art  exhibit  and  architectural  gallery;  and  special
presentations by noted speakers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Additionally, in May, a Founding Day  celebration  will  be
held  near John Lincklean's original campsite, which was located between
the Brewster Inn and Gypsy Bay; the observance will  be  followed  by  a
birthday  cake  at  the  Cazenovia Club and an architectural tour of the
1890s Owahgena Clubhouse; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Town of  Cazenovia,  located  in  Madison  County,  was
founded  in  May  of 1793 by John Lincklaen, a field agent for Theophile
Cazenove, a land speculator with the Holland Land Company in  New  York;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  slightly northeast of the center of town and
beautifully situated on the east shore of Cazenovia Lake, the Village of
Cazenovia was incorporated on February 7, 1810; and
 
  WHEREAS, Cazenovia  is  renowned  for  the  immense  beauty  of  its
historic  architectural styles, most notably the center-chimney house; a
center-chimney house is generally a  one,  one  and  a  half,  or  squat
two-story timber frame house which has a single masonry chimney close to
its center with two or three fireplaces on the home's first story; and
 
  WHEREAS, The first home of this kind was built in 1793, and finished
by  Samuel  Forman  at  the present Lakeland Park property in Cazenovia;
furthermore, one of the most intact examples of this architectural  type
is the Roswell Beckwith House, more commonly known as the Ladd House, on
Syracuse Road; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Town  of  Cazenovia  has  always  been optimistic and
vibrant with hope and excitement; a truly charming community, there is a
special comfort in the safety of a small  town  where  the  streets  are
named after familiar people and landmarks; and
 
  WHEREAS, Of historic origin, and remaining fruitful over the ebb and
flow of decades of growth and change, the Town of Cazenovia continues to
provide the quintessential quality of life for its residents; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  residents  of Cazenovia have a bright outlook for the
future of their community, which remains a beautiful place in  which  to
live, work and raise a family; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  recognition  of  Cazenovia's rich history and enduring
contribution to the State of New York, this Legislative Body is proud to
pay tribute to this spirited village upon  the  occasion  of  its  230th
Anniversary; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 230th Anniversary of the Town of  Cazenovia,  New  York,
recognizing  the  significance  of  the role it continues to play in the
life of the community of the State of New York; and be it further
