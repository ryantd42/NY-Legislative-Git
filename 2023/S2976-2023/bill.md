  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  Section  1. Subdivision 1 of section 597 of the labor law, as added by
 chapter 705 of the laws of 1944 and renumbered by  chapter  663  of  the
 laws of 1946, is amended to read as follows:
  1.  Issuance.  The  validity  of  the claim and the amount of benefits
 payable to the claimant shall be determined in accordance with the regu-
 lations and procedure established by the  commissioner  and,  when  such
 determination  is  issued  by  the  commissioner, it shall be deemed the
 initial determination of the claim. NOTWITHSTANDING  ANY  LAW,  RULE  OR
 REGULATION  TO  THE  CONTRARY,  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PROVIDE NOTICE TO
 EACH CLAIMANT OF SUCH INITIAL DETERMINATION OF APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF THE
 CLAIM NO LATER THAN THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE  CLAIMANT  HAS  FURNISHED  ALL

 SUCH  PRESCRIBED  TIME  FRAME  DUE TO EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH NOTICE
 SHALL INFORM THE CLAIMANT OF THE NEW ESTIMATED TIME FRAME FOR THE  ISSU-
 ANCE  OF  A  DETERMINATION,  THE RETROACTIVE EFFECTIVE DATE THE CLAIMANT
 WOULD RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM  IF  APPROVED,  AND  HOW  THE  CLAIMANT  MAY
 CONFIRM THE STATUS OF THE DETERMINATION IF IT IS NOT RECEIVED BY THE NEW
 ESTIMATED TIME FRAME.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
