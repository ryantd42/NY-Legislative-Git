 Introduced  by  Sen. SANDERS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Health
 
 AN ACT to amend the public health law, in relation to creating the lupus
  research enhancement program; and to amend the state finance  law,  in
  relation to creating the lupus research enhancement fund

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Article 2 of the public health law is amended by  adding  a
 new title 4-A to read as follows:
  TITLE IV-A
  LUPUS RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT
 SECTION 256.  SHORT TITLE.
  256-A. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
  256-B. DEFINITION.
  256-C. LUPUS RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM.
  256-D. LUPUS RESEARCH ADVISORY COUNCIL.
  256-E. LUPUS RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT FUND.
  § 256. SHORT TITLE.  THIS TITLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS THE
 "LUPUS RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT".
  §  256-A.  LEGISLATIVE  INTENT.  1.  THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY FINDS THE
 FOLLOWING:
  (A) LUPUS IS A SERIOUS, COMPLEX, DEBILITATING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE  THAT
 CAN  CAUSE  INFLAMMATION AND TISSUE DAMAGE TO VIRTUALLY ANY ORGAN SYSTEM
 IN THE BODY, INCLUDING THE SKIN, JOINTS, OTHER CONNECTIVE TISSUE,  BLOOD
 AND BLOOD VESSELS, HEART, LUNGS, KIDNEY, AND BRAIN.
  (B) THE LUPUS FOUNDATION OF AMERICA, INC. ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY
 1.5 TO TWO MILLION AMERICANS LIVE WITH SOME FORM OF LUPUS; LUPUS AFFECTS
 WOMEN  NINE  TIMES MORE OFTEN THAN MEN AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF NEWLY DIAG-
 NOSED CASES OF LUPUS DEVELOP AMONG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE.
  (C) LUPUS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS WOMEN OF COLOR -  IT  IS  TWO  TO
 THREE  TIMES  MORE COMMON AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, ASIANS AND
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 4626  2
 
 NATIVE AMERICANS AND IS GENERALLY MORE PREVALENT IN MINORITY POPULATIONS
 - A HEALTH DISPARITY THAT REMAINS UNEXPLAINED. ACCORDING TO THE  CENTERS
 FOR  DISEASE  CONTROL  AND  PREVENTION  THE  RATE OF LUPUS MORTALITY HAS
 INCREASED  SINCE  THE  LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND IS HIGHER AMONG OLDER
 AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN.
  (D) NO NEW DRUGS HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINIS-
 TRATION SPECIFICALLY FOR LUPUS IN NEARLY FORTY YEARS, AND WHILE  CURRENT
 TREATMENTS  FOR  THE DISEASE CAN BE EFFECTIVE, THEY CAN LEAD TO DAMAGING
 SIDE EFFECTS.
  (E) THE PAIN AND FATIGUE ASSOCIATED WITH LUPUS CAN  THREATEN  PEOPLE'S
 ABILITY  TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY, MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT
 AND LEAD NORMAL LIVES, AND ONE IN FIVE  PEOPLE WITH LUPUS IS DISABLED BY
 THE DISEASE, AND CONSEQUENTLY RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS,
 INCLUDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID, SOCIAL  SECURITY  DISABILITY,  AND  SOCIAL
 SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME.
  (F)  THE  ESTIMATED  AVERAGE  ANNUAL  COST OF MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR AN
 INDIVIDUAL WITH LUPUS CAN RANGE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND  THIRTY
 THOUSAND  DOLLARS;  FOR  PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE MOST SERIOUS FORM OF LUPUS,
 MEDICAL COSTS CAN GREATLY EXCEED  THIS  AMOUNT,  CAUSING  A  SIGNIFICANT
 ECONOMIC, EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL BURDEN TO THE ENTIRE FAMILY AND SOCIETY.
  (G)  MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE WITH LUPUS SUFFER FOUR OR MORE YEARS
 AND VISIT THREE OR MORE  PHYSICIANS  BEFORE  OBTAINING  A  DIAGNOSIS  OF
 LUPUS;  EARLY  DIAGNOSIS  OF AND COMMENCEMENT OF TREATMENT FOR LUPUS CAN
 PREVENT OR REDUCE SERIOUS ORGAN DAMAGE, DISABILITY, AND DEATH.
  (H) DESPITE THE MAGNITUDE OF LUPUS AND ITS IMPACT ON  INDIVIDUALS  AND
 FAMILIES,  HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF LUPUS REMAINS
 LOW; ONLY ONE OF FIVE AMERICANS CAN PROVIDE EVEN BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT
 LUPUS, AND AWARENESS OF LUPUS IS LOWEST AMONG ADULTS  AGES  EIGHTEEN  TO
 THIRTY-FOUR - THE AGE GROUP MOST LIKELY TO DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF LUPUS.
  (I)  LUPUS  IS  A  SIGNIFICANT  NATIONAL  HEALTH ISSUE THAT DESERVES A
 COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED RESPONSE BY STATE AND FEDERAL  GOVERNMENTS
 WITH INVOLVEMENT OF THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, PATIENT, AND PUBLIC HEALTH
 COMMUNITIES.
  2. THE PURPOSES OF THIS TITLE ARE:
  (A) TO PROMOTE BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO REDUCE
 OR  PREVENT  SUFFERING  FROM  LUPUS,  BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO
 STATE ACADEMIC MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE STATE CURRENTLY  CONDUCT-
 ING  OR  HAVING  AN  INTEREST  IN CONDUCTING BASIC AND CLINICAL, SOCIAL,
 TRANSLATIONAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, AND  BEHAVIORAL  RESEARCH
 ON LUPUS. SUCH ACTIVITIES MAY INCLUDE:
  (I) INVESTIGATING THE PATHOGENESIS AND PHYSIOLOGY OF LUPUS;
  (II) IDENTIFYING AND VALIDATING LUPUS BIOMARKERS;
  (III)  ENHANCING  THE  STATEWIDE  INFRASTRUCTURE  TO  CONDUCT CLINICAL
 TRIALS OF POTENTIAL NEW LUPUS THERAPIES;
  (IV) DEVELOPING OR IMPROVING DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR EARLY  DETECTION  OF
 LUPUS; AND
  (V) DEVELOPING NOVEL THERAPIES TO TREAT LUPUS.
  (B)  TO  ESTABLISH A MULTIDISCIPLINARY LUPUS RESEARCH ADVISORY COUNCIL
 TO MONITOR PROGRESS AND MAKE GRANTING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT.
