  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Arab American  Heritage
Month  in  the  State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of
National Arab American Heritage Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, For  over  a  century,  Arab  Americans  have  been  making
valuable contributions to every aspect of American society in: medicine,
law,  business,  technology,  civic engagement, government, and culture;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Since migrating to America, people  of  Arab  descent  have
shared  their  rich  culture  and traditions with neighbors and friends,
while also setting fine examples of model citizens and public  servants;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Arab  Americans  have  brought  with them to America their
resilient family values, strong work ethic, dedication to education, and
diversity in faith and creed that have added strength to our  democracy;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Writer Ameen Rihani's 1911 masterpiece, The Book of Khalid,
the  first  Arab  American  novel,  is  an  important  record  of  Arab
immigration to the Little Syria community of Lower Manhattan, and  today
is  a  powerful  example  of  the  potential  of  the  United  States to
strengthen ties with the Arab world; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Arab  American  poet  Kahlil  Gibran's  masterpiece,  The
Prophet,  was  a  transformative  piece  of  literature,  with  over 100
translations, making it one of the most translated books in history  and
discusses  topics of the human condition in the most eloquent of ways by
highlighting inclusion and understanding of all peoples; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  first  Arabic  speaker  to  come  to  North  America,
Zammouri, arrived as an enslaved person from Morocco in 1528, and was an
important explorer of the present-day American Southwest; and
 
  WHEREAS,  World  fairs  were one of many ways some Americans of Arab
descent came to visit the United States from the Arab world  and  helped
grow  this State by establishing businesses in the United States and the
State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Arab American Institute  estimates  there  are  roughly
3,700,000  Arab  Americans  living  in the United States, including over
200,000 in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to Census Bureau  data,  Arabic  is  one  of  the
fastest growing languages in the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  is  a  need  for  public  education, awareness, and
policies that are culturally competent when describing,  discussing,  or
addressing the impacts of being Arab American in all aspects of American
society, including discourse and policy; and
 
  WHEREAS, The incredible contributions and heritage of Arab Americans
have helped us build a better Nation; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  April  2022,  as  Arab
American Heritage Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  and  the  student  body,  faculty, and staff of the Kahlil Gibran
