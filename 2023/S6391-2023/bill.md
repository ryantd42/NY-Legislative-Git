  h.  Upon  issuance  of  an  order  of protection or temporary order of
 protection or upon a violation of such order, the  court  shall  make  a
 determination  regarding  the  suspension and revocation of a license to
 carry, possess, repair or dispose of a firearm or firearms,  ineligibil-

 pursuant  to  this section or upon a finding of a violation thereof, the
 court also may direct payment of restitution in an amount not to  exceed
 ten thousand dollars in accordance with subdivision (e) of section eight
 hundred  forty-one of such act; provided, however, that in no case shall
 an order of restitution be issued where the court  determines  that  the

 follows:
  9.  Upon  issuance  of  an  order  of protection or temporary order of

 before the court for failure to obey any lawful order issued under  this
 article  or  an  order  of  protection  or temporary order of protection
 issued pursuant to this act or issued by a court of competent  jurisdic-
 tion  of another state, territorial or tribal jurisdiction and if, after
 hearing, the court is satisfied by competent proof that  the  respondent
 has  willfully  failed  to  obey any such order, the court may modify an
 existing order or temporary order of protection to add reasonable condi-
 tions of behavior to the existing order, make a new order of  protection
 in  accordance  with  section  eight hundred forty-two of this part, may
 order the forfeiture of bail in a manner consistent  with  article  five
 hundred  forty  of  the  criminal procedure law if bail has been ordered
 pursuant to this act, may order the respondent to pay  the  petitioner's
 reasonable  and  necessary counsel fees in connection with the violation
 petition where the court finds that the violation of its order was will-
 ful, and may commit the respondent to jail for a term not to exceed  six
 months.  IF  THE  RESPONDENT HAS BEEN FOUND BY COMPETENT PROOF TO HAVE
 WILLFULLY FAILED TO OBEY SUCH ORDER OF PROTECTION ON MORE THAN ONE OCCA-
 SION, AND THIS WILLFUL FAILURE CONSISTED OF COMMITTING A FAMILY  OFFENSE
 AS  DEFINED  IN  SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED TWELVE OF THIS

 fied  days  or parts of days as the court may direct, and the court may,
 at any time within the term of such sentence, revoke such suspension and
 commit the respondent for the remainder of  the  original  sentence,  or
 suspend the remainder of such sentence. If the court determines that the

 subdivision a of section 265.20 and subdivision six of section 400.05 of
 the  penal  law,  and  disposal  of  any firearm such respondent owns or
 possesses. If the willful  failure  to  obey  such  order  involves  the
 infliction  of physical injury as defined in subdivision nine of section
 10.00 of the penal law or the use or threatened use of a  deadly  weapon
 or  dangerous  instrument,  as  those  terms are defined in subdivisions
 twelve and thirteen of section 10.00 of the penal law,  such  revocation
 and immediate surrender pursuant to subparagraph (f) of paragraph one of
 subdivision a of section 265.20 and subdivision six of section 400.05 of
