**Bill ID:** A3351BA
**Session:** 2023
**Sponsor:** Jeffrey Dinowitz
**Status:** Assembly Floor Calendar

## Summary

Establishes the climate change adaptation cost recovery program to require companies that have contributed significantly to the buildup of climate-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to bear a share of the costs of needed infrastructure investments to adapt to climate change; mandates that projects funded by the program require compliance with prevailing wage requirements; requires that contracts for funded projects contain a provision that the structural iron and structural steel used or supplied in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereto shall be produced or made in whole or substantial part in the United States, its territories or possessions; makes additional provisions; establishes the climate change adaptation fund.

 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  establishing  the climate change adaptation cost recovery program; and
  to amend the state  finance  law,  in  relation  to  establishing  the
  climate change adaptation fund
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "climate
 change superfund act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature finds and declares the
 following:
  1. Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion  of  fossil
 fuels,  is  an immediate, grave threat to the state's communities, envi-
 ronment, and economy. In addition to mitigating the further  buildup  of
 greenhouse  gases, the state must take action to adapt to certain conse-
 quences of climate change that are irreversible,  including  rising  sea
 levels,  increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, heat
 waves, toxic  algal  blooms  and  other  climate-change-driven  threats.
 Maintaining New York's quality of life into the future, particularly for
 young  people,  who  will experience greater impacts from climate change
 over their lifetimes, will be one of  the  state's  greatest  challenges
 over  the  next  three  decades.  Meeting  that challenge will require a
 shared commitment of  purpose,  huge  investments  in  new  or  upgraded
 infrastructure, and new revenue sources to pay for those investments.

  2.  New  York has previously adopted programs now in place - the inac-
 tive hazardous waste disposal site (state superfund) program and the oil
 spill fund - to remediate environmental damage to lands and waters based
 on the principle that, where  possible,  the  entities  responsible  for
 environmental  damage  should  pay  for  its cleanup. No similar program
 exists yet for the pollution of the atmosphere by greenhouse gas buildup
 as a result of burning fossil fuels.
  3. Based on decades of research it is now possible to  determine  with
 great  accuracy  the  share of greenhouse gases released into the atmos-
 phere by specific fossil fuel companies over the last 70 years or  more,
 making  it possible to assign liability to and require compensation from
 companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time period.
  4. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a  climate  change
 adaptation  cost  recovery program that will require companies that have
 contributed significantly  to  the  buildup  of  climate  change-driving
 greenhouse  gases in the atmosphere to bear a proportionate share of the
 cost of infrastructure investments  and  other  expenses  necessary  for
 comprehensive  adaptation  to  the impacts of climate change in New York
 state.
  5. a. The obligation to pay under the program is based on  the  fossil
 fuel companies' historic contribution to the buildup of greenhouse gases
 that  is  largely  responsible  for climate change. The program operates
 under a standard of strict liability; companies are required to pay into
 the fund because the use of their  products  caused  the  pollution.  No
 finding of wrongdoing is required.
  b. Nonetheless, the legislature recognizes that the actions of many of
 the  biggest  fossil  fuel  companies  have been unconscionable, closely
 reflecting the strategy of denial, deflection, and  delay  used  by  the
 tobacco  industry.  In  spite  of  the information provided by their own
 scientists that  the  continued  burning  of  fossil  fuels  would  have
 catastrophic  results, these companies hid the truth from the public and
 actively spread false information that the science of climate change was
 uncertain when in fact it was beyond controversy.  This  breach  of  the
 public  trust  was  breathtaking  in  its scope and consequences, and it
 continues to this day.
  c. Since 2022, the fossil fuel industry has taken advantage of several
 overlapping global crises to earn immense profits, charging record  high
 prices  while aggressively rejecting any responsibility for the costs of
 its business activities. While all the profits accrue to the  companies,
 all  of  the  costs of climate change are paid by taxpayers and individ-
 uals. This is a market failure that needs to be addressed through policy
 change.
  6. Payments by historical polluters into the climate change adaptation
 cost recovery program would be used for new or  upgraded  infrastructure
 needs  such as coastal wetlands restoration, storm water drainage system
 upgrades, energy efficient cooling systems in public and private  build-
 ings,  including  schools  and  public  housing,  support  for  programs
 addressing climate-driven public health  challenges,  and  responses  to
 extreme weather events, all of which are necessary to protect the public
 safety and welfare in the face of the growing impacts of climate change.
 The  cost  to  the  state of climate adaptation investments through 2050
 will easily exceed $150 billion, far more than  the  $75  billion  being
 assessed  on  the fossil fuel industry. At least 35%, with a goal of 40%
 or more of the overall benefits of program spending would go to  climate
 change  adaptive infrastructure projects that directly benefit disadvan-
 taged communities.

  7. This act is not intended to intrude on the authority of the federal
 government in areas where it has preempted the right of  the  states  to
 legislate.  This  act  is  remedial  in nature, seeking compensation for
 damages resulting from the past actions of polluters.
