 AN ACT to amend the  environmental  conservation  law,  in  relation  to
  establishing  the climate change adaptation cost recovery program; and
  to amend the state  finance  law,  in  relation  to  establishing  the
  climate change adaptation fund
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "climate
 change superfund act".
  §  2.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature finds and declares the
 following:
  1. Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion  of  fossil
 fuels,  is  an immediate, grave threat to the state's communities, envi-
 ronment, and economy. In addition to mitigating the further  buildup  of
 greenhouse  gases, the state must take action to adapt to certain conse-

 quences of climate change that are irreversible,  including  rising  sea
 levels,  increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, heat
 waves, toxic  algal  blooms  and  other  climate-change-driven  threats.
 Maintaining New York's quality of life into the future, particularly for
 young  people,  who  will experience greater impacts from climate change
 over their lifetimes, will be one of  the  state's  greatest  challenges
 over  the  next  three  decades.  Meeting  that challenge will require a
 shared commitment of  purpose,  huge  investments  in  new  or  upgraded
 infrastructure, and new revenue sources to pay for those investments.
  2.  New  York has previously adopted programs now in place - the inac-
 tive hazardous waste disposal site (state superfund) program and the oil
 spill fund - to remediate environmental damage to lands and waters based
 on the principle that, where  possible,  the  entities  responsible  for
 environmental  damage  should  pay  for  its cleanup. No similar program
 exists yet for the pollution of the atmosphere by greenhouse gas buildup
 as a result of burning fossil fuels.
  3. Based on decades of research it is now possible to  determine  with
 great  accuracy  the  share of greenhouse gases released into the atmos-
 phere by specific fossil fuel companies over the last 70 years or  more,
 making  it possible to assign liability to and require compensation from
 companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time period.
  4. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a  climate  change
 adaptation  cost  recovery program that will require companies that have
 contributed significantly  to  the  buildup  of  climate  change-driving
 greenhouse  gases in the atmosphere to bear a proportionate share of the
 cost of infrastructure investments  and  other  expenses  necessary  for
 comprehensive  adaptation  to  the impacts of climate change in New York
 state.
  5. The obligation to pay under the program is based on the fossil fuel
 companies' historic contribution to the buildup of greenhouse gases that
 is largely responsible for climate change. The program operates under  a
 standard  of  strict  liability;  companies are required to pay into the
 fund because the use of their products caused the pollution. No  finding
 of wrongdoing is required.
  6.  a.  Payments by historical polluters into the climate change adap-
 tation cost recovery program would be used for new or  upgraded  infras-
 tructure  needs such as coastal wetlands restoration, storm water drain-
 age system upgrades, energy efficient  cooling  systems  in  public  and
 private  buildings,  including  schools  and public housing, support for
 programs  addressing  climate-driven  public  health  challenges,  and
 responses  to  extreme  weather  events,  all  of which are necessary to
 protect the public safety and welfare in the face of the growing impacts
 of climate change.
  b. The cost to the state of  climate  adaptation  investments  through
 2050  will  easily  reach  several  hundred billion dollars, based on an
 array of estimates for projects impacting different regions  across  the
 state,  far  more than the $75 billion being assessed on the fossil fuel
 industry.  For example, upgrading New York City's sewer system  to  deal
 with  regularly-occurring  large rain events is estimated to cost around
 $100 billion; a single project proposed by the Army Corps  of  Engineers
 to protect New York City from storm-driven flooding is estimated to cost
 $52 billion; protecting Long Island from extreme weather is estimated to
 cost  at  least  $75-$100  billion;  a recent study from the State Comp-
 troller found that from 2018 to 2028,  55  percent  of  New  York  State
 localities'  municipal  spending outside of New York City was or will be
 related to climate change and that in fiscal year 2023-2024  alone,  New
 A. 3351--B  3
 
 York City planned to spend $829 million on projects dedicated exclusive-
 ly  to  adaptation  and  resilience,  with an additional $1.3 billion on
 projects that are partially for these purposes. These  are  only  a  few
 examples  of  the  numerous projects that are now or will soon be needed
 across the state.
  c. The total assessment rate of $3 billion dollars per year represents
 a small percentage of the extraordinary  cost  to  New  York  State  for
 repairing  from  and  preparing for climate change-driven extreme events
 over the next 25 years, and is designed to have a meaningful  impact  on
 the  burden  borne  by  New  York State taxpayers for climate adaptation
 while being sufficiently limited so as to not impose a punitive negative
 impact on an industry in which just the three largest domestic  oil  and
 gas  producers  made a combined $85.6 billion in profits in 2023. Recent
 science has determined that the largest one hundred fossil fuel  produc-
 ing companies are responsible for more than 70% of global greenhouse gas
 emissions  since 1988, and therefore bear a much higher share of respon-
 sibility for climate damage to New York State than is represented by the
 $75 billion being assessed them.
  d. At least 35 percent, with a goal of 40 percent or more of the over-
 all benefits of program spending would go  to  climate  change  adaptive
 infrastructure projects that directly benefit disadvantaged communities.
  7.  A covered period of 2000-2018 has been selected. Over 70 percent
 of the total increase in greenhouse gas concentrations since the  Indus-
 trial  Revolution has occurred since 1950, with a marked increase in the
 rate of emissions after the year 2000. By 2000 the  science  of  climate
 change  was  well  established,  and no reasonable corporate actor could
 have failed to anticipate regulatory action to address its  impacts.  In
 addition, the data necessary to attribute proportional responsibility is
 very robust in the covered period.
  8.  This act is not intended to intrude on the authority of the feder-
 al government in areas where it has preempted the right of the states to
 legislate.  This  act  is  remedial  in nature, seeking compensation for
 damages resulting from the past actions of polluters.

 article 76 to read as follows:
