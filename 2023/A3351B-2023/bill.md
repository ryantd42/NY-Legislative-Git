 AN  ACT  to  amend  the  environmental  conservation law, in relation to
  establishing the climate change adaptation cost recovery program;  and
  to  amend  the  state  finance  law,  in  relation to establishing the
  climate change adaptation fund
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This  act shall be known and may be cited as the "climate
 change superfund act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. The  legislature  finds  and  declares  the
 following:
  1.  Climate  change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil
 fuels, is an immediate, grave threat to the state's  communities,  envi-
 ronment,  and  economy. In addition to mitigating the further buildup of
 greenhouse gases, the state must take action to adapt to certain  conse-
 quences  of  climate  change that are irreversible, including rising sea
 levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding,  heat
 waves,  toxic  algal  blooms  and  other  climate-change-driven threats.
 Maintaining New York's quality of life into the future, particularly for
 young people, who will experience greater impacts  from  climate  change
 over  their  lifetimes,  will  be one of the state's greatest challenges
 over the next three decades.  Meeting  that  challenge  will  require  a
 shared  commitment  of  purpose  and huge investments in new or upgraded
 infrastructure.
  2. New York has previously adopted programs now in place -  the  inac-
 tive hazardous waste disposal site (state superfund) program and the oil
 spill fund - to remediate environmental damage to lands and waters based
 on  the  principle  that,  where  possible, the entities responsible for

 environmental damage should pay for  its  cleanup.  No  similar  program
 exists yet for the pollution of the atmosphere by greenhouse gas buildup
 as a result of burning fossil fuels.
  3.  Based  on decades of research it is now possible to determine with
 great accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released  into  the  atmos-
 phere  by specific fossil fuel companies over the last 70 years or more,
 making it possible to assign liability to and require compensation  from
 companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time period.
  4.  It  is the intent of the legislature to establish a climate change
 adaptation cost recovery program that will require companies  that  have
 contributed  significantly  to  the  buildup  of  climate change-driving
 greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to bear a proportionate share of  the
 cost  of  infrastructure investments required to adapt to the impacts of
 climate change in New York state.
  5. a. The obligation to pay under the program is based on  the  fossil
 fuel companies' historic contribution to the buildup of greenhouse gases
 that  is  largely  responsible  for climate change. The program operates
 under a standard of strict liability; companies are required to pay into
 the fund because the use of their  products  caused  the  pollution.  No
 finding of wrongdoing is required.
  b. Nonetheless, the legislature recognizes that the actions of many of
 the  biggest  fossil  fuel  companies  have been unconscionable, closely
 reflecting the strategy of denial, deflection, and  delay  used  by  the
 tobacco  industry.  In  spite  of  the information provided by their own
 scientists that  the  continued  burning  of  fossil  fuels  would  have
 catastrophic  results, these companies hid the truth from the public and
 actively spread false information that the science of climate change was
 uncertain when in fact it was beyond controversy.  This  breach  of  the
 public  trust  was  breathtaking  in  its scope and consequences, and it
 continues to this day.
  c. Since 2022, the fossil fuel industry has taken advantage of several
 overlapping global crises to earn immense profits, charging record  high
 prices  while aggressively rejecting any responsibility for the costs of
 its business activities. While all the profits accrue to the  companies,
 all  of  the  costs of climate change are paid by taxpayers and individ-
 uals. This is a market failure that needs to be addressed through policy
 change.
  6. Payments by historical polluters into the climate change adaptation
 cost recovery program would be used for new or  upgraded  infrastructure
 needs  such as coastal wetlands restoration, storm water drainage system
 upgrades, and energy efficient cooling systems  in  public  and  private
 buildings, including schools and public housing, all of which are neces-
 sary to protect the public safety and welfare in the face of the growing
 impacts  of climate change. At least 35%, with a goal of at least 40% of
 the overall benefits of program spending  would  go  to  climate  change
 adaptive  infrastructure  projects  that  directly benefit disadvantaged
 communities.
  7. This act is not intended to intrude on the authority of the federal
 government in areas where it has preempted the right of  the  states  to
 legislate.  This  act  is  remedial  in nature, seeking compensation for
 damages resulting from the past actions of polluters.
  § 3. The environmental conservation law is amended  by  adding  a  new
 article 76 to read as follows:

 SONABLE COSTS, OR THAT OBTAINING SUCH STEEL OR IRON IN THE UNITED STATES
 WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF THE CONTRACT BY AN  UNREASONABLE  AMOUNT,  OR
 SUCH  IRON  OR  STEEL,  INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION STRUCTURAL IRON AND
 STRUCTURAL STEEL, CANNOT BE PRODUCED OR MADE IN  THE  UNITED  STATES  IN
 SUFFICIENT AND REASONABLY AVAILABLE QUANTITIES AND OF SATISFACTORY QUAL-
 ITY.

  § 97-M. CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION FUND. 1. THERE IS HEREBY ESTABLISHED
 IN THE CUSTODY OF THE COMPTROLLER AND THE COMMISSIONER OF  TAXATION  AND
 FINANCE  A  SPECIAL  REVOLVING  FUND  TO BE KNOWN AS THE "CLIMATE CHANGE
 ADAPTATION FUND" FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING MONEYS THROUGH COST RECOV-
 ERY DEMANDS AND ISSUING FUNDS FOR QUALIFYING  EXPENDITURES  PURSUANT  TO
 THE CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION COST RECOVERY PROGRAM ESTABLISHED IN ARTI-
 CLE SEVENTY-SIX OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW.
  2.  NO  MONIES  SHALL BE EXPENDED FROM THE FUND FOR ANY PROJECT EXCEPT

 TION  AND  MAINTENANCE,  AS  WELL  AS  REASONABLE  COSTS INCURRED BY THE
 DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION FOR ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM.
  3. REVENUES IN THE FUND SHALL  BE  KEPT  SEPARATE  AND  SHALL  NOT  BE
 COMMINGLED  WITH  ANY  OTHER MONEYS IN THE CUSTODY OF THE COMPTROLLER OR
 THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION AND FINANCE. ALL DEPOSITS OF SUCH  REVENUES
 SHALL,  IF REQUIRED BY THE COMPTROLLER, BE SECURED BY OBLIGATIONS OF THE
 UNITED STATES OR OF THE STATE HAVING A MARKET VALUE EQUAL AT  ALL  TIMES
 TO  THE  AMOUNT  OF  SUCH DEPOSITS AND ALL BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES ARE
