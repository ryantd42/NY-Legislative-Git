  Section  1.  Paragraph 3 of subdivision d of section 6 of section 4 of
 chapter 576 of the laws  of  1974,  constituting  the  emergency  tenant

 fewer housing accommodations, or a twelve  and  one-half  period  for  a
 building  with more than thirty-five housing accommodations and shall be
 removed from the legal regulated rent thirty years  from  the  date  the

 division  of  housing  and community renewal after the effective date of
 [the] chapter THIRTY-NINE of the laws of  two  thousand  nineteen  [that
 amended this paragraph]; PROVIDED THAT THE COLLECTION OF ANY INCREASE IN
 THE  LEGAL REGULATED RENT FOR ANY HOUSING ACCOMMODATION PURSUANT TO THIS

 DATE OF THE ORDER GRANTING THE INCREASE OVER THE  LEGAL  REGULATED  RENT
 REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION TWELVE-A OF THIS ACT, WITH COLLECTIBILITY
 OF  ANY  DOLLAR  EXCESS  ABOVE  SAID SUM TO BE SPREAD FORWARD IN SIMILAR
 INCREMENTS  AND  ADDED TO THE LEGAL REGULATED RENT AS ESTABLISHED OR SET
 IN FUTURE YEARS. IN NO EVENT SHALL MORE THAN ONE SIX PERCENT INCREASE IN
 THE LEGAL REGULATED RENT PURSUANT TO THIS SUBPARAGRAPH BE  COLLECTED  IN
 THE SAME YEAR.
  (B) Temporary major capital improvement increases shall be collectable
 prospectively  on  the first day of the first month beginning sixty days
 from the date of mailing notice of approval to the tenant.  Such  notice
 shall disclose the total monthly increase in rent and the first month in
 which  the  tenant  would  be required to pay the temporary increase. An
 approval for a temporary major capital improvement  increase  shall  not
 include  retroactive  payments. The collection of any increase shall not
 exceed two percent in any year from the  effective  date  of  the  order
 granting  the  increase over the rent set forth in the schedule of gross
 rents, with collectability of any dollar excess above  said  sum  to  be
 spread  forward  in  similar  increments and added to the rent as estab-
 lished or set in future years. Upon vacancy, the landlord  may  add  any
 remaining balance of the temporary major capital improvement increase to
 the  legal  regulated  rent.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the
 law, the collection of any rent increases for any renewal lease commenc-
 ing on or after June 14, 2019, due to  any  major  capital  improvements
 approved  on  or  after June 16, 2012 and before June 16, 2019 shall not
 exceed two percent in any year for any tenant in occupancy on  the  date
