 systems,  association  libraries,  and  with  the state librarian of the
 division of library development, shall study the frequency of  residents
 who are being assessed library taxes for more than one public library or

 library or association library that is wholly contained  within  another

 dations  to  address  the double taxation of residents. Such study shall
 include, but not be limited to, the following:

 taxes  for  more  than one public library or association library and the

 libraries that  would  result  from  prohibiting  residents  from  being
 assessed  library  taxes for more than one public library or association
 library; and
  (c) minimizing the economic impact on public libraries and association
