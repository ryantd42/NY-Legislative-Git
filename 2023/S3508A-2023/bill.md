 AN ACT in relation to requiring the commissioner of taxation and finance
  to study the frequency of residents who  are  being  assessed  library
  taxes for more than one library and to make recommendations to prevent
  the double taxation of residents; and providing for the repeal of such
  provisions upon expiration thereof
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The commissioner of taxation and finance,  in  consultation
 with  the  commissioner  of  education, public libraries, public library
 systems, and association libraries, shall study the frequency  of  resi-
 dents  who  are  being  assessed  library taxes for more than one public
 library or association library, provided that such study  shall  exclude
 any public library or association library that is wholly contained with-
 in  another  public  library  or association library district, and shall
 make recommendations to address the double taxation of  residents.  Such
 study shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
  (a)  the  estimated number of residents who are being assessed library
 taxes for more than one public library or association  library  and  the
 amount  of  money  such  residents  are  paying in library taxes to each
 public library and association library;
  (b) the estimated economic impact on public libraries and  association
 libraries  that  would  result  from  prohibiting  residents  from being
 assessed library taxes for more than one public library  or  association
 library; and
  (c) minimizing the economic impact on public libraries and association
 libraries of reduced revenue resulting from the prohibition of residents
 from  being  assessed  library taxes for more than one public library or
 association library.
