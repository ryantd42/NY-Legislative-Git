  COMMEMORATING  the  125th  Anniversary  of  the
  formation of the Rough Riders, Teddy Roosevelt's 1st
  United States Volunteer Calvary on June 3, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, Members of the Armed Services from the State of  New  York,
who  have  served  so  faithfully  and courageously in wars in which our
Nation's freedom was at stake, as well as in the preservation  of  peace
during  peacetime,  deserve a special salute from this Legislative Body;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud  to  commemorate  the
125th  Anniversary  of  the  formation  of  the  Rough  Riders,  Teddy
Roosevelt's 1st United States Volunteer Calvary, and to pay  tribute  to
these soldiers for their courage, bravery, service and dedication to the
United States Army; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During this auspicious occasion on Saturday, June 3, 2023,
residents and visitors will learn about the Rough Riders through various
events such as  demonstrations,  saber  performances  by  United  States
Calvary  Soldiers, interpretive performances, live music, mounted cowboy
shooting, and a historical encampment; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Rough Riders was a nickname given  to  the  1st  United
States  Volunteer  Cavalry,  one  of  three  such  regiments  for  the
Spanish-American War and the only one to see combat; and
 
  WHEREAS, The United States had gone to war in opposition to  Spanish
colonial  policies  in  Cuba,  which  was  then torn by a rebellion; 1st
United States Volunteer Cavalry Colonel  Theodore  Roosevelt,  a  strong
advocate  for  the  Cuban  War  of  Independence, helped attract skilled
horsemen eager to see combat to the regiment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Known  as  "Roosevelt's  Rough  Riders,"  they  are  best
remembered for their conduct during the Battle of San Juan Hill; several
days after the Battle, the Spanish fleet sailed from Cuba, and in only a
few weeks an armistice ending the fighting was signed; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Despite  the  brevity  of  their service, the Rough Riders
became legendary thanks to Colonel Theodore Roosevelt's writing his  own
history  of  the  regiment  and  the silent film reenactments made years
later; and
 
  WHEREAS, Later, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt became the 26th President
of the United  States  of  America;  during  his  time  in  office,  his
residence  at  Sagamore  Hill  in Oyster Bay became known as the "Summer
White House" and the focus of international attention; and
 
  WHEREAS, Our Nation's veterans deserve to be  recognized,  commended
and thanked by the people of the State of New York for their service and
for their dedication to their communities, their State and their Nation;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 125th Anniversary of the formation of the Rough  Riders,
Teddy  Roosevelt's  1st United States Volunteer Calvary on June 3, 2023;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Joseph Saladino, Supervisor, Town of Oyster Bay.
