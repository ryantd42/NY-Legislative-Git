 Introduced by M. of A. KELLES -- read once and referred to the Committee
  on Energy
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to estab-
  lishing the natural carbon sequestration research program
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section  1. The agriculture and markets law is amended by adding a new
 section 151-j to read as follows:
  § 151-J. NATURAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION RESEARCH PROGRAM.  1.  THERE  IS
 HEREBY  ESTABLISHED  THE  NATURAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION RESEARCH PROGRAM.
 THE PURPOSE OF  THE  PROGRAM  IS  TO  DEVELOP  INNOVATIVE  SCIENCE-BASED
 SOLUTIONS  TO  FACILITATE  SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON IN NEW YORK'S NATURAL
 AND WORKING LANDS IN WAYS THAT DECREASE TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS  EMISSIONS.
 IN DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM, THE NEW YORK STATE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND
 LIFE SCIENCES AS NAMED PURSUANT TO SECTION FIFTY-SEVEN HUNDRED TWELVE OF
 THE  EDUCATION  LAW SHALL CONDUCT, SUPPORT, AND DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES AND
 MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, ALONG WITH VERIFICATION SYSTEMS TO FACILITATE THE
 NATURAL DRAWDOWN OF CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND STORAGE UNDERGROUND.
  2. SUBJECT TO AVAILABLE APPROPRIATIONS, THE  PROGRAM  SHALL  CONSIDER,
 BUT  NOT  BE  LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING:  STABILIZING EXISTING CARBON IN
 THE SOIL, INCREASING CARBON  SEQUESTRATION  THROUGH  NEW  PRACTICES  AND
 CROPPING  SYSTEMS,  PURPOSEFULLY  AMENDING  THE  SOIL  WITH  BIOCHAR AND
 COMPOST TO BOOST TOTAL SOIL CARBON AND PROMOTE GREENHOUSE GAS LIFE CYCLE
 BENEFITS, ADVANCING DIRECT AIR CAPTURE OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN FARMLAND AND
 LANDSCAPES THROUGH ENHANCED WEATHERING, UTILIZING OTHER INNOVATIVE TECH-
 NOLOGIES, AND THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN SUCH APPROACHES, INCLUDING  AGROFOR-
 ESTRY  AND  REFORESTATION  TO  STORE CARBON IN BOTH TREES AND SOIL WHILE
 PRODUCING ANCILLARY BENEFITS FOR WORKING LANDS.  THE  RESEARCH  PROGRAM
 SHALL  ALSO  DEMONSTRATE  SUCCESSFUL  TECHNOLOGIES  IN  PILOT  LOCATIONS
 THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UTILIZE THE CORNELL COOPERATIVE EXTEN-
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 SION SYSTEM FOR KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER, AND  PREPARE  ANNUAL  REPORTS  WHICH
 SHALL BE PUBLICLY DISSEMINATED.
  3.  THE  PROGRAM SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, RESEARCH ON THE
 FOLLOWING TOPICS, CONSISTENT WITH NEW YORK STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS:
  (A)  METHODS  TO  SEQUESTER  CARBON  IN  SOILS  THROUGH  NATURE-BASED
 SOLUTIONS;
  (B)  IMPROVEMENT  OR  ENHANCEMENT  OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN PLANT LIFE AND
 DELIVERY TO SOIL TO FACILITATE CARBON SEQUESTRATION;
  (C) DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO MEASURE,  MODEL  AND
 VERIFY CARBON STORAGE IN NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS;
  (D)  RESEARCH  THAT FACILITATES PRODUCTIVE AGROFORESTRY, AFFORESTATION
 AND  REFORESTATION,  INCLUDING  RESEARCH  THAT  FACILITATES  INCREASED
 NATURE-BASED CARBON STORAGE IN PEATLANDS AND WETLANDS; AND
  (E)  RESEARCH THAT QUANTIFIES TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS, INCLUDING
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO NITROUS OXIDE, METHANE AND  CARBON,  TO  ASSURE  THAT
 THERE ARE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION BENEFITS.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
