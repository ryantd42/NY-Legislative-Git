 amended by chapter 32 of the  laws  of  2021,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  3.  a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the
 correctional association shall be permitted, AT ITS PLEASURE ON ANY  DAY
 AT  ANY  TIME  OF  DAY  AND  WITHOUT  ADVANCE  NOTICE, to access, visit,
 inspect, and examine all state correctional facilities [with seventy-two
 hours advance notice to the department]  AND  ALL  FACILITIES  IN  WHICH
 PEOPLE UNDER THE CUSTODY OR SUPERVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT ARE BEING HELD
 OR  USED  FOR  OPERATIONAL  PURPOSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 CENTRAL NEW YORK PSYCHIATRIC CENTER.  Up to twelve people  may  comprise
 the  visiting  party[; provided, however, that only four people from the
 party may enter a special housing facility or unit at  the  same  time].
 THE  CORRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION SHALL HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO EVERY AREA
 OF THE  FACILITIES  WITHOUT  DEPARTMENT  ESCORT.  THE  DEPARTMENT  SHALL
 PROVIDE ESCORT WHENEVER REQUESTED BY THE CORRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION. Prior
 to  the  visitation authorized pursuant to this subdivision, the correc-
 tional association shall provide to the  department  on,  at  least,  an
 annual  basis  a  list  of  people  who will be visiting the facility or
 facilities, including names, dates of birth,  driver's  license  numbers
 and their designation as an employee, board member, or designee in order
 for  the department to perform prompt background checks, WHICH SHALL NOT
 BE UNREASONABLY DISAPPROVED AND ANY OBJECTIONS MUST  BE  PROVIDED  IN  A
 TIMELY  MANNER.  THE  CORRECTIONAL  ASSOCIATION  MAY  FROM  TIME TO TIME
 SUPPLEMENT THE LIST OF VISITORS BY PROVIDING THE SAME  INFORMATION  WITH
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
