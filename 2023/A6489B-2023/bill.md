 AN ACT to amend the correction law, in relation to correctional facility
  visits by the correctional association
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  Legislative findings. Founded in 1844 by  concerned  citi-
 zens  of  the  state  and  deputized by the state to provide independent
 monitoring and oversight of the state's prisons in 1846, the Correction-
 al Association of New York is one of  the  first  organizations  in  the
 country  created  to  administer civilian oversight of prisons to ensure
 greater transparency of correctional  institutions  in  the  state.  The
 Correctional  Association  of  New  York's on-site access to the state's
 prisons and to information on state prisons is critical for  the  organ-
 ization  to  provide  insight  into  the  policies and procedures of the
 state's prisons through its monitoring and reporting  on  prison  condi-
 tions,  policies,  and  procedures  for  the executive, legislature, and
 public, playing an important role in informing debates  on  correctional
 reform and incarcerated individuals' rights.
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 146 of the correction law, as amended by
 chapter  32 of the laws of 2021, paragraph b of subdivision 3 as amended
 by chapter 486 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  3. a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  the
 correctional  association  shall be permitted to access, visit, inspect,

 and examine all state correctional facilities  [with  seventy-two  hours
 advance notice to the department].  Up to twelve people may comprise the
 visiting party[; provided, however, that only four people from the party
 may  enter  a special housing facility or unit at the same time].  Prior
 to the visitation authorized pursuant to this subdivision,  the  correc-
 tional  association  shall  provide  to  the department on, at least, an
 annual basis a list of people who  will  be  visiting  the  facility  or
 facilities,  including  names,  dates of birth, driver's license numbers
 and their designation as an employee, board member, or designee in order
 for the department to perform prompt background checks.  The  department
 may  NOT  place  restrictions  on such visits and inspections, INCLUDING
 DURING PERIODS when a facility is locked down or experiencing a facility
 wide emergency.  [In addition] HOWEVER,  the  department  may  restrict
 access  to  a  portion  of  a facility in an emergency situation for the
 duration of the emergency. For the purpose of this subdivision, an emer-
 gency shall be determined by the commissioner or his or her designee and
 defined as a significant risk to the safety or security of the facility,
 or the health, safety or security of staff or incarcerated  individuals,
 or an event that significantly compromises the operations of the facili-
 ty.
  b.  Upon  twenty-four  hours  advance  notice, at the commencement AND
 CONCLUSION of any visits to, or inspections and examinations  of,  state
 correctional  facilities, the superintendent and executive team, [to the
 extent practicable] UPON REQUEST BY THE CORRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION,  shall
 meet  with  the correctional association. Upon twenty-four hours advance
 notice, [the] PRIVATELY WITHOUT REPRESENTATIVES OF  THE  CENTRAL  OFFICE
 PRESENT,  REPRESENTATIVES  OF  THE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ANY OTHER
 ENTITIES OR AGENCIES PROVIDING SERVICES IN A FACILITY  SHALL  MEET  WITH
 THE  CORRECTIONAL  ASSOCIATION  UPON  REQUEST  DURING  THE COURSE OF ANY
 VISIT. THE correctional association may meet privately with  the  incar-
 cerated  individual  liaison committee and representatives of the incar-
 cerated individual grievance resolution committee or any other organiza-
 tion of incarcerated individuals recognized by the department.
  c. [During the course of any such visit,  inspection  or  examination,
 upon  consent  of  the  person  being interviewed, the] THE correctional
 association shall have the power to interview and converse  publicly  or
 confidentially  with  any  correctional  employee  or ADMINISTRATOR, any
 incarcerated individual, AND ANY OTHER PERSON PROVIDING, SUPERVISING, OR
 MONITORING SERVICES IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, WHETHER OR NOT  EMPLOYED
 BY SUCH FACILITY. Such interviews shall not be restricted by the depart-
 ment  OR  THE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH OR ANY OTHER AGENCY or attended by
 anyone on behalf of the department OR THE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH OR ANY
 OTHER AGENCY, nor shall there be any retaliation or adverse action taken
 by the department or other state agency against [any incarcerated  indi-
 vidual]  ANYONE who [agrees to speak] SPEAKS with the correctional asso-
 ciation. The department may not limit  the  number  of  individuals  the
 correctional  association  may  interview  or the duration of the inter-
 views[, in any  manner  unreasonable  under  the  circumstances].  The
 correctional association shall have the power to conduct private, confi-
 dential meetings [reasonable in number under the circumstances] AT THEIR
 PLEASURE  AND  WITHOUT NOTICE TO THE DEPARTMENT with incarcerated people
 in housing units and in attorney visiting rooms or other  rooms  in  the
 facility  in  which  their  conversations  will  remain confidential. No
 department employee may attend or listen to any such meeting without the
 consent of the correctional association.
