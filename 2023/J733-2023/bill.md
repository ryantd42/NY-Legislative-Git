  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy Hochul to recognize
  April 20, 2023, in honor of the 246th Anniversary of
  the  adoption  of  the  first  New  York  State
  Constitution
 
  WHEREAS,  A  Convention  of Representatives of the State of New York
first gathered on Sunday evening, July 10, 1776, in  White  Plains,  New
York,  to draft a new State Constitution declaring independence from the
Kingdom of England and creating constitutional laws  and  to  have  this
Constitution  replace  the  Colonial  Charter, which was under authority
from the Monarch of the Kingdom of England; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Convention was forced into  repeated  adjournments  and
changes  of  location  throughout  the  winter caused by the threat of a
British occupation and the British Army invasion of Staten Island; and
 
  WHEREAS, On April 20, 1777, the Convention  successfully  terminated
its  labors  and  adopted  the  first  New York Constitution, creating a
democratic and free independent State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Constitution, as  the  State's  foundational  document,
defines  the rights and privilege afforded to the citizens of the State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Over 246 years, the State has  adopted  five  Constitutions
and  many  additional  Amendments  to  reflect  the  evolving  societal
standards of  decency,  thus  redefining  the  role  of  government  and
creating  a more expansive and inclusive understanding of the rights and
privileges protected by the Constitution, and to whom  such  rights  and
privileges are afforded; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is recognized that the Constitution is vitally important
to the functioning of our State government and protection of our State's
citizens; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  further  recognized  that  educating  our  State's
citizens  and  residents  about  the  Constitution  is  equally  vitally
important; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to recognize April 20, 2023, in  honor
of  the  246th  Anniversary  of the adoption of the first New York State
Constitution; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
