  Section 1. Section 6341 of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules,  as
 amended  by  chapter  208  of  the  laws  of 2022, is amended to read as
 follows:
  § 6341. Application for an extreme risk protection order.  In  accord-
 ance  with  this  article,  a  petitioner may file an application, which
 shall be sworn, and accompanying supporting documentation, setting forth
 the facts and circumstances justifying the issuance of an  extreme  risk
 protection  order.  Provided, however, that a petitioner who is a police
 officer or district attorney [shall] MAY file such application upon  the
 receipt  of  credible information that an individual is likely to engage
 in conduct that would result in serious  harm  to  himself,  herself  or
 others, as defined in paragraph one or two of subdivision (a) of section
 9.39  of  the mental hygiene law, unless such petitioner determines that
 there is no  probable  cause  for  such  filing.  Such  application  and
 supporting  documentation  shall  be  filed  in the supreme court in the
 county in which the respondent resides. The chief administrator  of  the
 courts  shall adopt forms that may be used for purposes of such applica-
 tions and the court's consideration of such applications. Such  applica-
 tion  form  shall include inquiry as to whether the petitioner knows, or
 has reason to believe, that the respondent owns, possesses or has access
 to a firearm, rifle or shotgun and if so, a request that the  petitioner
 list  or describe such firearms, rifles and shotguns, and the respective
 locations thereof, with as much specificity as possible.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.

  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
