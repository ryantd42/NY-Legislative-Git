  COMMENDING  Firefighter  Thomas O'Donnell upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after 30 years of dedicated service to the Williston
  Park Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS,  Citizens  across  our State and Nation are inspired by and
indebted to our noble volunteer firefighters  who  exhibit  courage  and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion and the strength of the American spirit  through  actions  of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication merit tribute and recognition by all citizens of  this  great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  commend
Firefighter Thomas O'Donnell upon the occasion of  his  designation  for
special  recognition  after 30 years of dedicated service as a member of
Company No. 3 with the Williston Park Fire Department to  be  celebrated
at  its  Annual  Inspection  Dinner  on Saturday, April 29, 2023, at the
Milleridge Inn in Jericho, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Thomas O'Donnell joined the Williston Park Fire  Department
on  August  4, 1992; throughout his 30 years of service, he has held the
position of Secretary within the Department from 1993 to 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor, and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first  to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident,  natural  disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis, or spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS, It takes a special dedication,  a  strong  desire  to  help
others  and  a tireless sense of community to forsake precious time with
family and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in  need;
Thomas O'Donnell is one such firefighter; throughout 30 years of devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend  Firefighter  Thomas  O'Donnell  upon  the  occasion  of  his
designation  for special recognition after 30 years of dedicated service
to the Williston Park Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to Firefighter Thomas O'Donnell.
