 ing  broadband  speeds; (iii) comparative state policies that have aided
 the increase in broadband speeds in other states, and whether such meas-
 ures would be similarly effective in this state; (iv) whether the use of
 public-private partnerships would aid in the goal of  increasing  broad-
 band speeds, and whether relevant businesses would be open to such part-
 nerships;  and (v) best practices recommended within the National Broad-
 band Plan issued by the Federal Communications  Commission  and  whether
 the  public  service commission can readily adopt and put into place any
 such recommendations.
  § 2. The public service commission may conduct any  hearings  or  take
 any  written testimony as it deems necessary in order to aid such study,
 and shall take all other steps necessary to provide a thorough  analysis
 of  all  issues  related to the provisions listed in section one of this
 act.
