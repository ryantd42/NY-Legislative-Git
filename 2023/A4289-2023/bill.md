 YEAR  PERIOD  BEGINNING  ON THE DATE THAT THE RECIPIENT FAILED TO COMPLY
 WITH THIS SERVICE CONDITION. NOTHING  IN  THE  WRITTEN  AGREEMENT  SHALL
 AFFECT  THE  TERMS  OF EMPLOYMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO SHALL NEGOTIATE,
 SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE PROGRAM, HIS OR HER SALARY AND  OTHER  FORMS
 OF  EMPLOYMENT  WITH AN AGENCY, INSTITUTION, OR A PROGRAM IN WHICH HE OR
 SHE SHALL BE EMPLOYED.
  ANY OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH SUCH  PROVISIONS  AS  OUTLINED  IN  THIS
 SECTION  SHALL BE CANCELLED UPON THE DEATH OF THE RECIPIENT. THE COMMIS-
 SIONER SHALL MAKE REGULATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE WAIVER OR SUSPENSION OF
 ANY FINANCIAL OBLIGATION WHICH WOULD INVOLVE EXTREME HARDSHIP.
