  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-

  (H) SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF ASSOCIATIONS OF EMPLOYEE-OWNED COMPANIES.
  2. THE CENTER SHALL ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ACCESS IN GOVERN-
 MENT  RELATIONS,  INCLUDING  PROVIDING  ACCESS  TO INFORMATION REGARDING
 RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT RELATE  TO  EMPLOYEE  OWNERSHIP  AND  DEVELOP
 PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES IN POLICIES TO PROMOTE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP.
  § 2. Section 1836-a of the public authorities law, as added by chapter
 788 of the laws of 1983, is amended to read as follows:
  §  1836-a.  Legislative  findings.  The  legislature  hereby finds and
 declares that [the health, safety and general welfare of the  people  of
 this  state  are directly dependent upon the state economy, and that one
 of the principal problems of our present economy is the permanent  clos-
 ing  of industrial and manufacturing plants, and their relocation out of
 state, which results in the loss of jobs and increasing unemployment.
  It is the purpose of this  subtitle  to  encourage  the  employees  of
 plants that are about to be permanently closed, or relocated, to acquire
 such  plants  and  to  continue to operate them as employee-owned enter-
 prises, thereby retaining the jobs that would  otherwise  be  lost,  and
 strengthening  the  economic  base  of  this  state]  EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP
 PROGRAM IS A MAINSTREAM ASPECT OF THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY WITH APPROX-
 IMATELY THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILLION WORKERS PARTICIPATING IN  SOME  FORM
 OF EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP PROGRAM AT OVER SEVEN THOUSAND COMPANIES. THE VAST
 MAJORITY OF SUCH PROGRAMS ARE THE RESULT OF A TRANSFER FROM THE BUSINESS
 OWNERS TO THE EMPLOYEES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW THAT SEEKS TO
 FACILITATE  SUCH  TRANSFERS.  EMPLOYEE  OWNERSHIP  TRANSFERS  ARE IN THE
 INTEREST OF BUSINESS OWNERS,  WHO  SEEK  TO  LIQUIDATE  THEIR  OWNERSHIP
 INTEREST  AND  RETIRE.  SUCH  TRANSFERS  ARE ALSO IN THE INTEREST OF THE
 EMPLOYEES, WHO GAIN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE FUTURE SURVIVAL OF THE
 FIRM AND THEIR JOBS.
  THE LEGISLATURE ALSO FINDS AND DECLARES  THAT  EMPLOYEE-OWNED  BUSI-
 NESSES  ARE  MORE PRODUCTIVE, ENJOY INCREASED SALES, LOWER TURNOVER RATE
 AND GREATER LONGEVITY, OFFER BETTER EMPLOYMENT  OPPORTUNITIES,  AND  ARE
 MORE  LIKELY TO RETAIN JOBS IN-STATE AND LESS LIKELY TO RELOCATE OUT-OF-
 STATE.  EMPLOYEE-OWNED BUSINESSES  ALSO  SUSTAIN  THE  STATE  TAX  BASE
 THROUGH  EMPLOYEE  AND CORPORATE INCOME TAX, WHILE SAVING COSTS ON UNEM-
 PLOYMENT INSURANCE AND OTHER STATE BENEFIT PROGRAMS. IT IS  THE  PURPOSE
 OF  THIS  SUBTITLE  TO  AMPLIFY  FEDERAL PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF EMPLOYEE
 OWNERSHIP AT THE STATE LEVEL THROUGH  LOANS  AND  LOAN  GUARANTEES  THAT
 PROVIDE  FINANCING FOR THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES TO EMPLOYEE
 OWNERSHIP.
