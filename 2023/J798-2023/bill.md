  HONORING  ex-Chairman  Michael  Tedeschi  upon the
  occasion of his designation for special  recognition
  after  many  years  of dedicated service to the Port
  Washington Fire Department
 
  WHEREAS, Citizens across our State and Nation are  inspired  by  and
indebted  to  our  noble  volunteer firefighters who exhibit courage and
bravery every day in the course of their duties; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Volunteer  firefighters  exemplify  the  power  of  human
compassion  and  the  strength of the American spirit through actions of
the  most  heroic  magnitude;  their  sacrifices  and  their  selfless
dedication  merit  tribute and recognition by all citizens of this great
country; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body is justly proud to honor  ex-Chairman
Michael  Tedeschi  upon  the  occasion  of  his  designation for special
recognition after many years of dedicated service to the Port Washington
Fire Department, to be celebrated  at  its  Bi-Annual  Installation  and
Inspection Dinner on Saturday, June 10, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Michael  Tedeschi has consistently demonstrated a level of
commitment,  dedication,  integrity,  and  professionalism  which  truly
exemplifies excellence in the volunteer service; and
 
  WHEREAS, A member of the Port Washington Fire Department since 1997,
Michael  Tedeschi  has served in several capacities, including as a Port
Washington Fire Department Board of Directors,  Board  Secretary,  Board
Treasurer, Board Vice Chair, and Chairman of the Board; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, he was a member of the Engineering staff from
1999 to 2002 and 2005 to 2006, as well as Advisor to Juniors  from  2000
to 2014; and
 
  WHEREAS, Firefighters unwaveringly serve our great State with pride,
valor,  and integrity; these respected volunteers are often the first to
respond to an emergency, whether the emergency is a fire, transportation
accident, natural disaster, act of terrorism, medical crisis,  or  spill
of hazardous materials; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  takes  a  special  dedication, a strong desire to help
others and a tireless sense of community to forsake precious  time  with
family  and friends to respond to the signal that a neighbor is in need;
Michael Tedeschi is such a firefighter; throughout his years of  devoted
service,  this volunteer heroically performed, above and beyond the call
of  duty,  those  responsibilities  which  define  the  task  of  fire
protection; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor ex-Chairman Michael Tedeschi upon the occasion of his  designation
for  special  recognition  after  many years of dedicated service to the
Port Washington Fire Department; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to ex-Chairman Michael Tedeschi.
