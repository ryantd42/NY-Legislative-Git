  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The real property law is amended by adding  a  new  section
 223-c to read as follows:
  § 223-C. RIGHTS OF TENANTS TO DISPLAY THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES IN
 CERTAIN  AREAS.  1. NO LANDLORD SHALL PROHIBIT A TENANT FROM ENGAGING IN
 THE DISPLAY OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES IF THE FLAG IS DISPLAYED IN
 ACCORDANCE WITH:
  A. THE PATRIOTIC CUSTOMS SET FORTH IN 4  U.S.C.  5-10,  GOVERNING  THE
 DISPLAY AND USE OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES;
  B. FEDERAL LAW, STATE LAW, OR ANY LOCAL ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION; AND
  C. DOES NOT INFRINGE UPON THE SPACE RENTED BY ANY OTHER TENANT.
  2. AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "DISPLAY OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES"
 MEANS A FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES THAT IS:
  A. MADE OF CLOTH, FABRIC OR PAPER;
  B. DISPLAYED FROM A POLE OR STAFF OR IN A WINDOW; AND
  C. DISPLAYED IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH 4 U.S.C. CHAPTER 1.
  3.  A  TENANT WHO REQUESTS TO DISPLAY THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AT

 LEASE AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRES A TENANT, AT THE TERMINATION OF  A  LEASE,
 TO  RETURN  THE  PREMISES IN THE SAME CONDITION AS THEY WERE IN WHEN THE
 TENANT TOOK POSSESSION.
  5. THE TENANT IS LIABLE FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY  A  UNITED  STATES  FLAG
