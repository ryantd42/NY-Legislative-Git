  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  December  2,  2023,  as  Special  Education  Teacher
  Awareness Day, in conjunction with the observance of
  National Special Education Day
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body that teachers of
special education students  deserve  our  recognition  as  they  support
students  to reach their goals of integration, independence and equality
in our communities and society at large; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  December  2,  2023,  as
Special  Education  Teacher  Awareness  Day,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Special Education Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Special  education  teachers  play  a  critical  role  in
assessing  student's skills and determining their educational needs, and
they develop Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to ensure students
are working at the pace that best suits them; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to an education department report,  in  New  York
State  alone  there  are  about  500,000  school-aged students receiving
special education programs and services; it is crucial  that  the  state
comes  together  to  acknowledge this important population of our state,
and the educators that continue to support them; and
 
  WHEREAS, Students with  disabilities  deserve  access  to  equitable
education,  and  this is achieved heavily through the support of special
education teachers;  there  has  been  an  uphill  battle  in  providing
education to children with special needs, and special education teachers
have served as advocates for the rights of these students; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Special  education  teachers  deal  with  many  different
situations that may arise on a day-to-day basis; they  are  required  to
stay  calm,  and help students navigate challenges that may be presented
to them, and need to be creative and engaging for the different types of
students in the class; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Special  education  teachers  balance  the  relationships
between  students,  their families, and their educational goals; special
education teachers often do not receive the appreciation  they  deserve;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  New  York  State  has contributed many of its resources to
special education  programs,  therefore,  it  is  only  right  that  the
teachers  who operate them are also acknowledged for their steadfast and
unremitting commitment  to  their  students  and  their  families;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul  to  proclaim  December  2,  2023,  as
 
Special  Education  Teacher  Awareness  Day,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Special Education Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York, and to special education teachers.
