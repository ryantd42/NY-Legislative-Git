 Introduced by M. of A. LUPARDO, PEOPLES-STOKES -- read once and referred

 AN ACT to amend the cannabis law, in relation to authorizing conditional
  adult-use cultivator licensees to sell their own cannabis products and
  authorizing  the  office  of  cannabis  management to create a loan or
  grant program to help such adult-use cultivator licensees  to  process
  cannabis into distillate
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as  the  "cannabis
 crop rescue act".
  §  2. Legislative findings. Chapter 18 of the laws of 2022 created the
 conditional adult-use cultivator license. Due to a  variety  of  circum-
 stances  beyond  the control of New York's cannabis farmers, many licen-
 sees cannot afford to process their  cannabis  or  sell  their  finished
 products.  As a result, their 2022 crops are losing value while in stor-
 age due to diminished potency, color and aroma.  Without sales, many are
 unable to plant a crop for the  upcoming  growing  season,  and  are  in
 severe financial stress.
  §  3.  Section  68-c  of the cannabis law is amended by adding two new
 subdivisions 16 and 17 to read as follows:
  16. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS SECTION, A CONDITIONAL
 ADULT-USE CULTIVATOR LICENSEE SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO SELL THEIR  OWN  OR
 ANOTHER  CONDITIONAL  ADULT-USE  CULTIVATOR  LICENSEE  HOLDER'S CANNABIS
 PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS UNTIL NO LATER THAN SEPTEMBER  THIRTIETH,
 TWO  THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE. SUCH AUTHORITY SHALL ALLOW FOR ON-FARM SALES
 OF TESTED, PACKAGED AND SEALED PRODUCTS.  THE OFFICE IS  AUTHORIZED  TO
 ISSUE  EMERGENCY  REGULATIONS,  IF NECESSARY, TO IMPLEMENT THIS SUBDIVI-
 SION.
  17. THE OFFICE IS AUTHORIZED TO CREATE A LOAN OR GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE
 PURPOSE OF HAVING ANY  CANNABIS  GROWN  UNDER  A  CONDITIONAL  ADULT-USE
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 A. 6593  2
 
 CULTIVATOR  LICENSE  PRIOR  TO SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-
 THREE PROCESSED INTO DISTILLATE.  THE  END-PRODUCT  OF  SUCH  PROCESSING
 SHALL BE RETURNED TO THE LICENSEE FOR FUTURE USE.
  § 4. A conditional adult-use cultivator licensee may select to operate
 under  subdivisions  16 and 17 of section 68-c of the cannabis law until
 September 30, 2023.
  § 5.  This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however,  that
 the amendments to section 68-c of the cannabis law made by section three
 of  this  act  shall  not affect the repeal of such section and shall be
 deemed repealed therewith.
