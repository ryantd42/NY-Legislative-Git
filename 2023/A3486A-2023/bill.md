 AN ACT in relation to authorizing the assessor of the town of Brookhaven
  to  accept  an application for exemption from real property taxes from
  Al-Muneer Foundation, Inc.
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor  of  the  town of Brookhaven, county of Suffolk, is hereby
 authorized to accept from Al-Muneer Foundation,  Inc.  a  not-for-profit
 corporation,  an  application  for  exemption  from  real property taxes
 pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax law with  respect  to
 the 2020-2021 assessment rolls for the parcel owned by such organization
 located  in  the  town of Brookhaven, located at 72 Neighborhood Road in
 Mastic Beach, also known as district 0200, section 979.10, block  09.00,
 lot 017.000. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it had
 been  received on or before the taxable status date established for such
 assessment rolls.
  If satisfied that such corporation would otherwise be entitled to such
 exemption if such corporation had filed an application for exemption  by
 the  appropriate taxable status date, the assessor, upon approval of the
 town of Brookhaven town board, may grant exemption from taxation on such
 assessment rolls and make the appropriate  corrections  of  the  subject
 rolls.  If exemptions are granted and such corporation, therefore, shall
 have paid any tax with respect to  the  subject  rolls,  the  applicable
 governing  body  or  tax  departments,  in  their sole discretion, shall
 provide for the refund of the taxes paid, along with any fines or penal-
 ties paid, and cancel taxes remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
