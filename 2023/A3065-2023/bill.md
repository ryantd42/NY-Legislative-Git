 correction in the notice, that prompt action to  correct  the  violation
 has  been  taken but that full correction cannot be completed within the
 time provided because of serious technical  difficulties,  inability  to
 obtain  necessary materials, funds or labor, inability to gain access to
 the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of
 the building as may be necessary to make the required repair,  provided,
 however, that where such immediately hazardous violation has been issued

 tions  as  are deemed necessary to correct the violation within the time
 set for the postponement.
