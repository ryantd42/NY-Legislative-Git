 Introduced  by  M.  of  A. J. M. GIGLIO -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Codes
 
 AN ACT to amend the penal  law,  the  criminal  procedure  law  and  the
  correction law, in relation to criminalizing the reckless transmission
  of  HIV/AIDS  and  to  require  testing  for  AIDS and HIV for certain
  persons

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Legislative intent.  The legislature finds that HIV/AIDS
 infection poses a serious threat to the public health of all New Yorkers
 whenever HIV/AIDS infected persons act in a manner which  is  likely  to
 spread  this  horrible disease to other persons.  When HIV/AIDS infected
 persons commit such actions as having unprotected sex or sharing needles
 without the consent of their partners, they endanger the  public  health
 and frustrate the efforts of health officials to contain and, hopefully,
 reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS.
  The  legislature  further  finds that in order to allow the victims of
 alleged sex crimes or crimes which endanger their health to  obtain  the
 most  effective health care treatment, the HIV status of their offenders
 must be determined.
  The legislature further finds that the increasing reports of  acquired
 immune  deficiency  syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis
 and hepatitis in state correctional facilities have reached an  alarming
 level.  These incarcerated individuals and others who may have an undi-
 agnosed case of any of these syndromes, diseases or viruses are extreme-
 ly detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the correction offi-
 cers and other staff who work in such facilities as well as incarcerated
 individuals who are incarcerated therein.  In order to  maintain  proper
 security  and  working  conditions, the legislature hereby declares that
 all incarcerated individuals presently under confinement and all  incar-
 cerated  individuals  to  be  newly  admitted  to  the  department  of

 corrections and community supervision must be expeditiously  tested  for

 community supervision shall take immediate action to care for  afflicted
 incarcerated individuals including separation from the general incarcer-
 ated individual population in a special medical facility.
