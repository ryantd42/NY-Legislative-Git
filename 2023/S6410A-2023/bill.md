 compensation for which the said employers are liable under this chapter,
 except that in the case of [municipal corporations] PUBLIC  GROUP  SELF-
 INSURERS  as [herein] defined IN SUBPARAGRAPH (A-1) OF THIS PARAGRAPH no

 subdivision  shall  be  known  as a group self-insurer and the employers

 OBLIGATIONS  ARE  GUARANTEED  BY  ANOTHER  MEMBER WHICH IS SUCH A PUBLIC
 CORPORATION. A PUBLIC GROUP SELF-INSURER SHALL COMPLY WITH  ALL  OF  THE

  § 3. Subdivision 3-a of section 50 of the workers' compensation law is
 amended by adding a new paragraph 3-a to read as follows:

 YEAR  FROM  THE  ASSUMPTION  OF  THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CLAIMS OF THE
 PUBLIC GROUP SELF-INSURER, EACH MEMBER OF  THE  INSOLVENT  PUBLIC  GROUP
 SELF-INSURER SHALL RESUME ADMINISTRATION OF ITS OWN CLAIMS AND THE CHAIR
 SHALL  RETURN TO EACH MEMBER WHATEVER PRO RATA SHARE OF THE PUBLIC GROUP
 SELF-INSURER'S ASSETS REMAIN AFTER THE PERIOD OF  CHAIR  ADMINISTRATION.

 BY THE PUBLIC GROUP SELF-INSURER ITSELF AND, IF THE PUBLIC  GROUP  SELF-
 INSURER  IS UNABLE TO REIMBURSE THE CHAIR FULLY FOR PAYMENTS MADE BY THE
 CHAIR, THEN BY THE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC GROUP SELF-INSURER AGAINST WHICH

 FROM  DIRECTING  THAT  AN  UNDERFUNDED PUBLIC GROUP SELF-INSURER LEVY AN
 ASSESSMENT ON ITS MEMBERS AS PART OF A PLAN FOR ACHIEVING  FULLY  FUNDED
 STATUS  WHICH  MAY INCLUDE A DEFICIT ASSESSMENT ON MEMBERS OF SUCH GROUP
