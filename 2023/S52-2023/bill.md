  Section 1. Paragraph (a) of subdivision 6 of section 502 of the  vehi-
 cle  and  traffic  law, as amended by chapter 37 of the laws of 2019, is
 amended to read as follows:
  (a) A license issued pursuant to  subdivision  five  of  this  section
 shall  be valid until the expiration date contained thereon, unless such
 license is suspended, revoked or cancelled. Such license may be  renewed
 by  submission of an application for renewal, the fee prescribed by law,
 proofs of prior licensing, fitness and acceptable vision  prescribed  by
 the  commissioner,  the  applicant's  social security number or, in lieu
 thereof, with respect to an application for  a  non-commercial  driver's
 license  or  learner's  permit which does not meet federal standards for
 identification, an affidavit signed by such applicant that they have not
 been issued a social security number, and if required by the commission-
 er, a photo image of the applicant in  such  numbers  and  form  as  the
 commissioner  shall  prescribe.  IN  ADDITION,  THE COMMISSIONER SHALL
 REQUIRE AN APPLICANT FOR RENEWAL TO  PASS  A  WRITTEN  EXAMINATION  WITH
 RESPECT TO THE LAWS RELATING TO TRAFFIC AND OTHER MATTERS AS THE COMMIS-
 SIONER  MAY  PRESCRIBE  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SUBJECTS SET
 FORTH IN SUBDIVISION FOUR OF THIS SECTION. THE COMMISSIONER MAY  PROVIDE

 materials endorsement, comply with the requirements imposed upon  states
 by sections 383.141 and 1572.13 of title 49 of the code of federal regu-
 lations.  A  renewal of such license shall be issued by the commissioner
 upon  approval of such application, except that no such license shall be
 issued if its issuance would be  inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of
 section  five hundred sixteen of this title, and except that the commis-
 sioner may refuse to renew such license if the applicant is  the  holder
 of  a  currently  valid  or renewable license to drive issued by another
 state or foreign country unless the applicant surrenders such license.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition,  amend-
 ment and/or repeal of any rule or regulation necessary for the implemen-
 tation  of  this act on its effective date are authorized to be made and
 completed on or before such effective date.
