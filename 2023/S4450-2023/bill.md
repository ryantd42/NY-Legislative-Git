 AN ACT to amend the correction law, in relation to requiring legislative
  approval for the closure of correctional facilities and institutions

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The correction law is amended by adding a new section 30 to
 read as follows:
  § 30. CLOSURE OF CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL  SUBMIT
 A  WRITTEN  REPORT  TO THE LEGISLATURE AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE
 DAYS PRIOR TO THE DATE THE DEPARTMENT IS SEEKING CLOSURE OF ANY  CORREC-
 TIONAL  FACILITY OR INSTITUTION. SUCH REPORT SHALL INCLUDE JUSTIFICATION
 FOR THE PROPOSED CLOSURE. THE LEGISLATURE  MAY  REQUIRE  ANY  ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION  OR  DATA  THAT  IT  DEEMS NECESSARY IN SUCH REPORT.  IF THE
 LEGISLATURE, OR THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES THEREOF, UPON REVIEW  OF  THE
 REPORT  SUBMITTED  TO  IT  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT,  FINDS THAT THE PROPOSED
 CLOSURE IS NOT JUSTIFIED THEN CLOSURE SHALL NOT OCCUR UNTIL APPROVED  BY
 A MAJORITY VOTE OF EACH HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE.
  § 2. Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part
 of  this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to
 be invalid, such judgment shall not affect,  impair  or  invalidate  the
 remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause,
 sentence,  paragraph,  section  or part thereof directly involved in the
 controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.
  § 3. This act shall take effect on the thirtieth day  after  it  shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or
 repeal  of  any  rule  or regulation necessary for the implementation of
 this act on its effective date are authorized to be made  and  completed
 on or before such effective date.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
