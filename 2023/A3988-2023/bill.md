 AN ACT to amend the state finance law and the environmental conservation
  law, in relation to  establishing  the  municipal  asbestos  abatement
  grant program; and making an appropriation therefor
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. Many  of  our  local  communities  have
 buildings  that  are vacant and left abandoned by their original owners.
 Those buildings containing asbestos are especially difficult and  costly
 to  clean  up.  For  decades  asbestos  was  commonly  used  in building
 construction as a fire proofing material, as  well  as  an  additive  to
 concrete,  asphalt,  pipes,  siding  and  floor  tiles. Asbestos becomes
 hazardous when damaged and its fibers are known to cause  certain  types
 of  cancer.  These  asbestos filled buildings pose significant financial
 challenges to our local governments that cannot afford to  renovate  and
 reuse them.
  The  Legislature seeks to support local government efforts to revital-
 ize economies by helping return these abandoned and vacant buildings  to
 productive use.  Therefore, the Legislature hereby creates The Municipal
 Asbestos  Abatement Grant Program with the intention of providing finan-
 cial assistance to municipalities  for  the  demolition,  renovation  or
 restoration  of  abandoned  or  vacant  asbestos laden buildings for the
 purpose of returning them to productive use.
  § 2. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 6  of  section  92-s  of  the  state
 finance law, as amended by section 3 of part U of chapter 58 of the laws
 of 2016, is amended to read as follows:
  (b)  Moneys  from the solid waste account shall be available, pursuant
 to appropriation and upon certificate of approval of availability by the
 director of the budget, for any non-hazardous municipal landfill closure
