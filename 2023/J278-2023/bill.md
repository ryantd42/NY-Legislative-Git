  COMMEMORATING  the  100th  Anniversary  of the New
  Rochelle NAACP on January 29, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  enduring  organizations  which  devote  their
purposeful energies to improving the quality  and  dignity  of  life  of
those  they  serve, to preserving their heritage, and to fostering pride
among them; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary  of  the  New  Rochelle  NAACP  to  be
celebrated  at  its Platinum Jubilee on Sunday, January 29, 2023, at the
Bethesda Baptist Church of New Rochelle; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this momentous occasion, Keynote Speaker and  Senior
Pastor  of  the Bethesda Baptist Church, Reverend Dr. Allen Paul Weaver,
Jr. will speak about this year's theme, "Resilience Anchored by  Faith";
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  oldest  and  largest  civil  rights organization, the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  (NAACP)  was
founded  in  1909,  in New York City by a group of citizens committed to
ensuring a society in which all individuals have  equal  rights  without
discrimination based on race; and
 
  WHEREAS, The New Rochelle Branch of the NAACP was organized in 1923,
in  the  Bethesda  Baptist  Church, largely through the efforts of Annie
Lucille Alleyne and Walter  White  just  14  years  after  the  National
Association  was  founded;  Annie  proudly  served  as the newly founded
organization's temporary chairperson; and
 
  WHEREAS, As it was in the beginning  and  today,  the  New  Rochelle
NAACP  and  its members focus their efforts on specific community needs,
education, political leadership, membership,  technology,  and  housing;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  its  due  diligence,  several  members of the New
Rochelle  NAACP  represented  by  attorney  Paul  Zuber,  successfully
challenged  the  Lincoln  School boundaries; this landmark desegregation
case has truly paved a path for all children to  receive  a  proper  and
well-rounded education in a safe and healthy environment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Today under the luminous leadership of President, Minister
Mark McLean; 1st Vice President, Aisha Cook; 2nd Vice President,  Judith
Henry; 3rd Vice President, Dr. Jonathan Williams M.D.; Secretary, Denise
Ford; Assistant Secretary, Carol Bracey; Treasurer, Gayla Marsh; and its
executive  committee,  the New Rochelle NAACP continues to work with the
State and National Office of the NAACP to support its mission to realize
justice for all people with a focus on the historically  disenfranchised
and underrepresented; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore,  the  organization continues to fight against
injustices in the local community, targeting its programming on economic
development and empowerment, engagement with  local  youth,  educational
policy,  civic  engagement  and participation, while maintaining a large
membership with the national office; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  that when
organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are brought to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of the great State of New York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the New Rochelle NAACP, recognizing
its  steadfast  and  unwavering commitment to Westchester County, and to
the advancement of the mission  of  the  National  Association  for  the
Advancement of Colored People; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to Minister Mark McLean, President, New Rochelle NAACP.
