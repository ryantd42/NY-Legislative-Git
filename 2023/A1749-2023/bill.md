 AN  ACT  to amend the public health law, in relation to expanding health

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 5-d of section 4406-c of the public health law,
 as added by chapter 451 of the laws of 2007, and as relettered by  chap-
 ter 237 of the laws of 2009, is amended to read as follows:
  5-d.  If  a  contract  between a plan and [a hospital] ANY HEALTH CARE
 PROVIDER is not renewed or is terminated by either  party,  the  parties
 shall  continue  to  abide  by  the  terms  of  such contract, including
 reimbursement terms, for a period of [two  months]  ONE  HUNDRED  TWENTY
 DAYS from the effective date of termination or, in the case of a non-re-
 newal,  from the end of the contract period. Notice shall be provided to
 all enrollees potentially affected by such  termination  or  non-renewal
 within  fifteen  days after commencement of the [two-months] ONE HUNDRED
 TWENTY DAY period. The commissioner shall have the  authority  to  waive
 the  [two-months]  ONE  HUNDRED  TWENTY  DAY  period upon the request of
 either party to a contract that is  being  terminated  for  cause.  This
 subdivision shall not apply where both parties mutually agree in writing
 to  the  termination  or non-renewal and the plan provides notice to the
 enrollee at least thirty days in advance of the date of contract  termi-
 nation.
  §  2.  This  act shall take effect immediately; provided, however that
 the amendments  to  subdivision 5-d of section  4406-c  of  the  public
 health  law made by section one of this act shall  not affect the repeal
 of such subdivision and shall be deemed repealed therewith.
