  [(B)] (2) the superintendent shall not impose or collect  any  penalty
 under  this  section in addition to any penalty or fine for the same act
 or omission that is imposed under the insurance law or banking law; and
  [(C)]  (3)  nothing  in  this section shall affect the construction or

  [(b)  Civil  penalties received by the superintendent pursuant to this
 section shall be applied on an annual basis as follows: funds  shall  be
 applied  first  to  reduce  the assessments charged on persons regulated
 under the insurance law and the banking  law  pursuant  to  section  two
 hundred  six of this chapter up to the full amount paid by persons regu-
 lated under the insurance law and banking law for the operating expenses
 of the financial frauds and consumer protection unit not attributable to
 regulation under the insurance or banking law for  the  fiscal  year  in
 which  such  penalties are received, such amount shall be applied to any
 assessment in the following year, and any remaining funds shall be  paid
 to  the general fund. The superintendent shall have discretion to deter-
 mine how operating expenses which are not solely attributable  to  regu-
 lating  persons  under either the insurance law or the banking law shall
 be allocated.]

 regulated  under  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  a  federal agency or
 authority, (ii) regulated  for  the  purpose  of  consumer  or  investor

 ing,  when  offered  or  provided  by  a  provider  of consumer goods or
 services:  (i) the extension of credit directly to a consumer exclusive-
 ly for the purpose of enabling that consumer to purchase  such  consumer

 arising from such credit, or (iii) the sale or conveyance of  such  debt
