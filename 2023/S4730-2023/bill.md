 Introduced  by  Sen. SANDERS -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Housing, Construction  and
  Community Development
 
 AN ACT to amend the private housing finance law, in relation to enacting
  the "home mortgage bridge loan assistance act"; and to amend the state
  finance law, in relation to establishing the home mortgage bridge loan
  assistance fund
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  The private housing finance law is amended by adding a new
 article 28 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE 28
  HOME MORTGAGE BRIDGE LOAN
  ASSISTANCE
 SECTION 1250. SHORT TITLE.
  1251. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
  1252. DEFINITIONS.
  1253. HOME MORTGAGE BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE.
  1254. NOTICE, TIMING AND STAY OF PROCEEDING REQUIREMENTS.
  1255. ELIGIBILITY.
  1256. TEMPORARY PAYMENTS OF ASSISTANCE.
  § 1250.  SHORT TITLE. THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED  AS
 THE "HOME MORTGAGE BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE ACT".
  §  1251.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. (1) FINDINGS. THE LEGISLA-
 TURE HEREBY FINDS AND DECLARES THAT:
  (A) THIS STATE AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE EXPERIENCED THE COLLAPSE  OF
 A  SIZEABLE  PRIMARY  AND  SECONDARY REAL ESTATE MARKET BUBBLE WHICH FEW
 FORESAW AND MANY NOW SUFFER THE WEALTH DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF;
  (B) THIS STATE AND THE UNITED STATES ARE IN CONSEQUENCE NOW  SUFFERING
 AN  ECONOMIC  SLOWDOWN  AS  CONSUMERS TRIM SPENDING AND CONCENTRATE UPON
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 4730  2
 
 PAYING DOWN DEBT, WHILE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER BUSINESS  FIRMS
 TRIM INVESTMENT EXPENDITURES PENDING A RETURN OF CONSUMER SPENDING;
  (C)  THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AFFLICTING THIS STATE AND THE UNITED STATES
 HAS DRIVEN LARGE NUMBERS OF RESIDENTS INTO TEMPORARY  INVOLUNTARY  UNEM-
 PLOYMENT  OR  UNDEREMPLOYMENT,  THEREBY  LOWERING  INCOMES, SPENDING AND
 INVESTMENT YET FURTHER, WHILE  RENDERING  DEBT  PAYMENT  CORRESPONDINGLY
 MORE DIFFICULT FOR MANY;
  (D) THERE IS IN CONSEQUENCE A DANGER THAT MANY OTHERWISE CREDIT WORTHY
 HOMEOWNERS' CAPACITY TO REMAIN CURRENT ON MORTGAGE PAYMENTS WILL DETERI-
 ORATE  YET  FURTHER,  RESULTING  IN  WIDESPREAD DEFAULT, MULTIPLE COSTLY
 FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS, DISTRESS SALES  OF  HOMES,  CONSEQUENT  FURTHER
 DISTRESS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS' BALANCE SHEETS AND SOLVENCY, GROWING
 RATES  OF AVOIDABLE HOMELESSNESS, AND SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION OF ABAN-
 DONED HOUSING STOCK AND NEIGHBORHOODS;
  (E) FORECLOSED HOMES, ABANDONED HOUSING STOCK AND CONSEQUENTLY DETERI-
 ORATING BUILDINGS AND NEIGHBORHOODS NOT ONLY DETRIMENTALLY AFFECT  THOSE
 WHO  NEEDLESSLY  LOSE  THEIR  HOMES  AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHICH THEY
 RESIDE, BUT ALSO DRAIN WEALTH  FROM  OTHERWISE  HEALTHY  LENDING  INSTI-
 TUTIONS  AND NON-DISTRESSED HOME MORTGAGE BORROWERS, THEREBY HARMING THE
 HEALTH OF THE BROADER ECONOMY YET FURTHER;
  (F) WHILE THE CURRENT ECONOMIC  CRISIS  DEMANDS  IMMEDIATE  ACTION  TO
 AVOID UNNECESSARY FORECLOSURES, HELP REVITALIZE AND STABILIZE OUR COMMU-
 NITIES  AND  REINVIGORATE  MORTGAGE LENDING, BUSINESS CYCLES ARE PART OF
 THE ECONOMIC FABRIC OF THE STATE AND THE NATION AND THEREFORE, A  TEMPO-
 RARY  BRIDGE LOAN MORTGAGE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WOULD BENEFIT HOME
 MORTGAGE BORROWERS, LENDERS AND NEIGHBORHOODS NOT ONLY  IN  THE  CURRENT
 DOWNTURN, BUT ALSO IN FUTURE CONVENTIONAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS;
  (G) EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE REVEALS THAT MANY TEMPORARILY TROUBLED MORTGAGE
 BORROWERS  PROVE  ABLE TO RETAIN THEIR HOMES AND PAY OFF THEIR MORTGAGES
 WITHOUT MODIFICATION WHEN OFFERED BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE  UNTIL  BROADER
 ECONOMIC  CONDITIONS IMPROVE, THEREBY STAVING OFF GROWING DEFAULT, FORE-
 CLOSURE, HOMELESSNESS AND NEIGHBORHOOD DETERIORATION RATES, AS  WELL  AS
 YET FURTHER WORSENING OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS;
  (H) TEMPORARY BRIDGE LOAN MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS HAVE ACCORDING-
 LY  PROVED  HIGHLY  SUCCESSFUL  IN COST EFFECTIVELY LIMITING FORECLOSURE
 RATES AND ATTENDANT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ILLS  IN  SEVERAL  STATES,  MOST
 NOTABLY IN PENNSYLVANIA, CONNECTICUT, MARYLAND AND NEVADA; AND
  (I)  A  TEMPORARY  BRIDGE  LOAN MORTGAGE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS
 HIGHLY LIKELY TO REDOUND IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER TO  THE  BENEFIT  OF
 HOME  MORTGAGE BORROWERS, LENDERS, NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THE BROADER PUBLIC
 OF THIS STATE.
  2. PURPOSE. THE LEGISLATURE DECLARES THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS  ARTICLE
 SHALL BE TO ESTABLISH A PROGRAM TO AFFORD BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE TO HOME
 MORTGAGE  DEBTORS  FACING TEMPORARY DIFFICULTIES IN REMAINING CURRENT ON
 MORTGAGE LOAN PAYMENTS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN SO AS TO AVOID MANY
 AVOIDABLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ILLS.

 BY  WHICH  THE  SUM OF ANY HOME MORTGAGE BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS
 MADE BY THE DIVISION TO MORTGAGEES EXCEEDS THE SUM OF PAYMENTS  MADE  BY
 THE  MORTGAGOR TO THE DIVISION, PLUS ANY AMOUNTS PAID BY THE DIVISION TO
 THE MORTGAGEE UNDER SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION, SHALL CONSTITUTE  A

 OBTAINED BY THE DIVISION PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE DETERMINED IN
 THE SAME MANNER AS THE LIEN OF A GENERAL SECURED CREDITOR OF THE MORTGA-
 GOR.  NEITHER  THIS  LIEN NOR ANY OTHER SECURITY INTEREST TAKEN BY THE
 DIVISION SHALL BE DEEMED TO TAKE PRIORITY OVER ANY OTHER SECURED LIEN OR
 SECURED INTEREST IN EFFECT AGAINST THE MORTGAGOR'S PROPERTY ON THE  DATE
 THAT HOME MORTGAGE BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS COMMENCE. THE COMMIS-

 ANCE LIEN IF NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE MORTGAGOR TO OBTAIN A HOME IMPROVE-
 MENT LOAN NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY.

  (I) IF FORTY PERCENT OF THE MORTGAGOR'S NET EFFECTIVE INCOME EQUALS AN
 AMOUNT  THAT IS GREATER THAN TOTAL HOUSING EXPENSE, THAT AMOUNT SHALL BE
 PAID TO THE DIVISION, UNLESS OTHERWISE DETERMINED  BY  THE  COMMISSIONER
 AFTER EXAMINATION OF THE MORTGAGOR'S FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND ABILITY
 TO CONTRIBUTE TO REPAYMENT OF THE ASSISTANCE;
  (II)  IF  FORTY PERCENT OF THE MORTGAGOR'S NET EFFECTIVE INCOME EQUALS
 AN AMOUNT THAT IS LESS THAN TOTAL HOUSING  EXPENSE,  REPAYMENT  OF  HOME
 MORTGAGE BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE SHALL BE DEFERRED UNTIL FORTY PERCENT OF
 THE  MORTGAGOR'S  NET  EFFECTIVE INCOME EQUALS AN AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER
 THAN TOTAL HOUSING EXPENSE;
  (III) THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR PERIODIC  REVIEW
 OF  A  MORTGAGOR'S TOTAL HOUSING EXPENSE AND NET EFFECTIVE INCOME WITH A
 VIEW TO DETERMINING PAYMENT AMOUNTS THAT ARE DUE TO THE DIVISION  PURSU-

  (IV) IF REPAYMENT OF HOME MORTGAGE BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE HAS NOT BEEN

 LESS THAN THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS UNTIL THE ASSISTANCE IS REPAID;
  (V)  INTEREST  SHALL ACCRUE UPON ALL HOME MORTGAGE BRIDGE LOAN ASSIST-
 ANCE PAYMENTS MADE BY THE DIVISION ON BEHALF OF THE MORTGAGOR AT A  RATE
 PER  ANNUM THAT IS EQUAL TO THE STATE'S COST OF FUNDING OR AT SOME OTHER

 COSTS, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSIONER. INTEREST SHALL ACCRUE FROM THE
 TIME  THE  MORTGAGOR  COMMENCES  REPAYMENT UNDER THIS SECTION, AND SHALL
 ACCRUE ONLY DURING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE MORTGAGOR  IS  REQUIRED  TO
 MAKE  SUCH  REPAYMENT.  WHEN ANY MORTGAGE FOR WHICH HOME MORTGAGE BRIDGE

 ALL SUCH ASSISTANCE DUE AND OWING AT THE SAME RATE AND ON THE SAME BASIS
 AS THE MORTGAGE FOR WHICH THE ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS WERE MADE; AND
  (VI) ALL MONEYS RECEIVED FROM MORTGAGORS FOR REPAYMENT OF  HOME  MORT-
 GAGE  BRIDGE  LOAN  ASSISTANCE  SHALL  BE DEPOSITED IN THE HOME MORTGAGE
 BRIDGE LOAN ASSISTANCE FUND ESTABLISHED IN SECTION EIGHTY-NINE-K OF  THE

 FIFTEEN  DAYS  OF  THE  DUE  DATE,  THE  COMMISSIONER  SHALL  REVIEW THE
 MORTGAGOR'S FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN ORDER TO  DETERMINE  WHETHER  THE
 DELINQUENCY IS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE MORTGAGOR'S FINANCIAL CIRCUM-
 STANCES.  IF  SUCH  A DETERMINATION IS MADE, THE COMMISSIONER MAY MODIFY
 THE MORTGAGOR'S REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IF FAILURE TO PAY IS  NOT  DETERMINED
 TO  BE  DUE  TO  A  MATERIAL  DETERIORATION IN THE MORTGAGOR'S FINANCIAL
 CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL TERMINATE  ASSISTANCE  AND  NOTIFY
 THE  MORTGAGEE  THAT  ASSISTANCE  HAS BEEN TERMINATED. THE MORTGAGEE MAY
 THEREAFTER TAKE ANY LEGAL ACTION NECESSARY TO ENFORCE ITS MORTGAGE WITH-
