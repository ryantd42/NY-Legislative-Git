 AN ACT to amend the real property actions and proceedings  law  and  the
  real  property  law,  in relation to prohibiting residential evictions
  during the winter months

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  Title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "winter moratorium on evictions act of 2023".
  § 2. Legislative findings and declaration of emergency.  The  legisla-
 ture hereby finds and declares all of the following:
  The  serious  public  emergency  regarding  the scarcity of affordable
 housing across New York State continues to  exist,  and  such  emergency
 puts  families  and  individuals  at  a  heightened  risk  of  eviction,
 displacement, and homelessness.
  The legislature recognizes that  evictions  trigger  long-lasting  and
 irreparable  harm  to  public health and safety. Evictions are linked to
 all-cause mortality and lead to an array of negative mental and physical
 health outcomes including higher rates of  emergency  room  utilization,
 mental health hospitalizations, suicide, children's hospitalization, and
 depression.  Evictions  directly  result in job loss and disruption to a
 child's education. Those who have experienced an eviction are more like-
 ly to live in substandard housing and have greater residential precarity
 and are less likely to secure safe and affordable housing  in  the  long
 term. These consequences are disproportionately felt by Black and Latinx
 households, who face the highest rates of eviction.
  Evictions  are  a significant cause of homelessness, both directly and
 indirectly. In New York City, 25 percent of  shelter  residents  and  12
 percent  of unsheltered individuals are homeless due to an eviction. The
 Department of Housing and Urban Development identified at  least  91,271
 homeless  individuals  throughout  New  York  State  as of January 2020,

 including 77,943 individuals in New York  City  and  13,328  individuals
 throughout the rest of the State.
  The  well-documented  and devastating consequences of homelessness are
 exacerbated by cold weather. Unsheltered individuals have  an  increased
 risk  of  developing  exposure-related  health problems, particularly in
 cold weather. NYC Department of  Homeless  Services  reported  that  613
 homeless  individuals  died  between July 2019 and June 2020 in New York
 City. Individuals experiencing homelessness accounted for  at  least  25
 percent of all cold-related hospitalizations between 2003 and 2015.
  The legislature further recognizes that the statewide stock of shelter
 accommodations fails to ameliorate the threat to public health and safe-
 ty  posed  by  eviction  and  homelessness. A 2020 audit by the New York
 State Comptroller found unsafe conditions, including structural  damage,
 vermin  infestations,  and mold, in 60 percent of shelters. In 2020, the
 New York City Comptroller found widespread hazardous conditions jeopard-
 izing  infants'  health  and  safety  in  City  shelters.  Incidents  of
 violence,  theft, and police presence are pervasive in City shelters; 38
 percent of New York  City  residents  experiencing  street  homelessness
 choose  not  to  return to the shelter system and become street-homeless
 because of personal safety concerns. Convoluted and punitive  rules  and
 procedures,  loss  of  personal  agency,  inadequate resources and staff
 training, and a systemic failure to accommodate disabilities are further
 deterrents.
  The legislature further recognizes that, pursuant to Article  XVII  of
 the  New  York  State  Constitution,  the "aid, care, and support of the
 needy are public concerns and shall be  provided  by  the  state."  Such
 obligation  extends  to the State's homeless population, whose needs are
 heightened during winter months. The Executive Department has found that
 inclement winter weather presents a threat  to  the  life,  health,  and
 safety  of  the  State's  homeless  citizens  in particular, and defines
 "inclement winter weather" as air temperatures at or  below  32  degrees
 Fahrenheit,  including  National  Weather  Service calculations for wind
 chill. According to National  Weather  Service  data,  inclement  winter
 weather  falls  within  the normal temperature ranges in all or parts of
 New York State from November through April.
  The legislature therefore finds and declares that in order to  prevent
 death,  hardship,  and  other negative health outcomes to New York State
 residents, the provisions of this act are necessary  to  protect  public
 health,  safety, and general welfare. The necessity in the public inter-
 est for the provisions hereinafter  enacted  is  hereby  declared  as  a
 matter of legislative determination.
  §  3.  Subdivision  2  of section 711 of the real property actions and
 proceedings law, as amended by section 12 of part M of chapter 36 of the
 laws 2019, is amended to read as follows:

 in the alternative, the payment of the rent, or the  possession  of  the
 premises,  has  been  served  upon  him  as  prescribed in section seven
 hundred thirty-five of this article. Any person succeeding to the  land-
 lord's  interest  in the premises may proceed under this subdivision for
 rent due his predecessor in interest if he has a right thereto. Where  a

 UNLESS SUCH JUDGMENT HAS BEEN VACATED PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  SIX  OF

 and commanding the officer to remove all persons named in  the  proceed-

 time.  PURSUANT  TO SECTION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE-A OF THIS ARTICLE,
 THE EARLIEST DATE UPON WHICH EXECUTION  MAY  OCCUR  SHALL  FALL  BETWEEN
