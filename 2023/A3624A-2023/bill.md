  Section 1. The public authorities law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new
 section 390 to read as follows:
  §  390.  THRUWAY  TOLL HOLIDAY. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF
 LAW TO THE CONTRARY, FOR THE PERIOD BEGINNING JUNE FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND

 general  fund  to  the  thruway  authority an amount no greater than the
 amount that would have otherwise been collected by the thruway authority
 if the toll holiday established by section 390 of the public authorities
 law had not been authorized; provided,  however,  that  the  comptroller
 shall  make  such  transfer  only  after  the director of the budget has
 determined in his or her discretion that the transfer  is  necessary  to
 ensure  the  thruway authority meets its expenses and obligations at the
 end of the toll collection holiday established by  section  390  of  the
 public authorities law.
  §  3.  The  thruway  authority shall on an emergency basis, promulgate

 provisions of this act.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
