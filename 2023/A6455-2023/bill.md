 Introduced  by  M.  of A. CHANDLER-WATERMAN -- read once and referred to
  the Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions
 
 AN ACT to amend the public authorities law, in relation to requiring the
  New York city transit authority to have  at  least  one  conductor  on
  board

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1.  The legislature finds and declares that, the New York city
 transit authority, through its operation of the  New  York  city  subway
 system,  the  largest  public  transit system in the world, provides the
 primary means of commuting for many millions of New York  residents  and
 visitors every day of the week. With an estimated average of over 10,000
 passengers  loaded  onto  each  train during rush hours, the presence of
 trained New York city transit authority personnel, other than the  engi-
 neer, on each train is necessary and should always be required to ensure
 improved safety for passengers during emergencies, which may occur while
 in subway tunnels or traveling over bridges.
  The  legislature  further finds and declares that the tragic events of
 September 11, 2001, which launched the war of  terror  against  America,
 has  tremendously heightened the need to significantly increase security
 and safety for commuters on New  York  city  subway  trains.  Also,  the
 recent  conviction  of Zarein Ahmedzay, who was caught buying explosives
 and admitted to having planned an attack on the  New  York  city  subway
 system  makes it imperative that we recognize the role of conductors and
 other authority personnel assigned on passenger trains as first  respon-
 ders,  and  the  front  line defense to potentially save lives and limit
 casualties in the event of a terrorist attack.
  § 2. The public authorities law is amended by  adding  a  new  section
 1205-b to read as follows:
  §  1205-B.  CONDUCTOR  REQUIRED.  ANY  SUBWAY OR TRAIN OPERATED BY THE
 AUTHORITY FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSPORTING PASSENGERS SHALL HAVE AT LEAST
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 ONE CONDUCTOR ON BOARD. FOR THE  PURPOSES  OF  THIS  SECTION,  THE  TERM
 "CONDUCTOR"  SHALL  MEAN  THE  PERSON OTHER THAN THE DRIVER, ENGINEER OR
 MOTORMAN PRIMARILY CHARGED WITH ALL ASPECTS  OF  THE  OPERATION  OF  THE
 RAILROAD  LOCOMOTIVE, SUBWAY OR TRAIN, WHO SHALL ASSIST IN THE OPERATION
 OF THE TRAIN AND BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF
 THE DOORS AND OTHER SAFETY ASPECTS OF THE TRAIN.  A CONDUCTOR  SHALL  BE
 REQUIRED  ON  ANY SUBWAY OR TRAIN OPERATED BY THE AUTHORITY WHENEVER THE
 SUBWAY OR TRAIN HAS MORE THAN TWO CARS ATTACHED TO THE ENGINE THEREOF.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
