  (iii)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of this paragraph or any
 provision of paragraph (bb) of subdivision two of section  four  hundred

 certificate of registration [that was issued] to a franchisor,  manufac-
 turer,  distributor, distributor branch or factory branch, as such terms

 subsidiary,  affiliate  or  controlled  entity  thereof[, prior to March

 chisor, manufacturer, distributor, distributor branch or factory branch,
 or any subsidiary, affiliate or controlled  entity  thereof,  (1)  is  a
 manufacturer  that  manufactures or assembles exclusively zero emissions
 vehicles, or is a subsidiary, affiliate, or controlled entity of such  a
 manufacturer; AND (2) HAS NO FRANCHISED MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER OF THE SAME
 LINE-MAKE  IN  THIS STATE; and provided further, IN THE CASE OF RENEWAL,
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 that a controlling interest in such original  franchisor,  manufacturer,
 distributor,  distributor  branch  or  factory branch or any subsidiary,
 affiliate or controlled entity was not transferred, sold or conveyed  to
 another  person  or  entity,  other  than  to a subsidiary, affiliate or
 controlled  entity  of  such  franchisor,  manufacturer,  distributor,
 distributor  branch  or  factory branch. For purposes of this paragraph,
 zero emission vehicles shall have the same meaning  as  under  part  two
 hundred  eighteen  of  title six of the New York code of rules and regu-
 lations.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
