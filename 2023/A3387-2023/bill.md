 programs  and other interested parties, and to aid in the implementation
 of the policy required by this subdivision. Such governing body or advi-
 sory committee may request and shall receive technical  assistance  from

 or  the provision of services by residential or non-residential domestic
 violence programs, as such terms are defined  in  section  four  hundred
 fifty-nine-a  of  the  social services law, or establish a grant program
 directly or indirectly affecting such victims  of  domestic  OR  GENDER-
 BASED  violence  or  providers  of service, without first consulting the
 office, which shall provide all comments  in  response  to  such  rules,
 guidelines  or  procedures  in  writing  directly to the chief executive
 officer of such agency, to the administrative regulations review commit-
 tee and to the appropriate committees of the legislature  having  juris-
 diction  of  the  subject  matter  addressed within two weeks of receipt
 thereof, provided that failure of the  office  to  respond  as  required
 herein  shall  not  otherwise impair the ability of such state agency to
 promulgate a rule. This paragraph shall not apply  to  an  appropriation
 which  finances  a contract with a not-for-profit organization which has
 been identified for a state agency without the  use  of  a  request  for
 proposals.

 safe  and  helpful working environment for employees currently or poten-
 tially experiencing the effects of domestic  violence.  The  model  plan

 nizing domestic violence as a workplace issue as well as  promoting  the
 need  to maintain job security for those employees currently involved in

 said  policies  and  service  availability  pamphlets in break rooms, on

 managers in how to recognize, approach and assist employees experiencing
 domestic violence, including both victims and batterers; and
  (vi)  other  issues  as shall be appropriate and relevant for the task
 force in developing such model policy.
  (c) Such model policy shall be reviewed by the task  force  to  assure
 consistency  with  existing  law and shall be made the subject of public
 hearings convened by the office throughout the state at  places  and  at
 times which are convenient for attendance by the public, after which the
 policy  shall  be reviewed by the task force and amended as necessary to
 reflect concerns raised at the hearings. If approved by the task  force,
 such  model policy shall be provided as approved with explanation of its
 provisions to the governor and the legislature not later than  one  year
 after  the  effective  date  of  this subdivision. The office shall make
 every effort to notify businesses of  the  availability  of  such  model
 domestic violence employee awareness and assistance policy.
  (d)  The  office  in  consultation  with  the task force, providers of
 services, the advisory council, the  department  of  labor,  the  empire
 state development corporation, and representatives of statewide advocacy
 organizations  for  the  prevention  of domestic violence, shall provide
 technical support,  information,  and  encouragement  to  businesses  to
 implement  the provisions of the model domestic violence employee aware-
 ness and assistance policy.
  (e) Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be deemed  to  prevent
 businesses  from adopting their own domestic violence employee awareness
 and assistance policy.
  (f) The office shall survey businesses within four years of the effec-
 tive date of this  section  to  determine  the  level  of  model  policy
 adoption  amongst  businesses  and shall take steps necessary to promote
 the further adoption of such policy.

  § 3. Subdivision 6 of section 530.11 of the criminal procedure law, as
 amended  by  chapter  663  of  the  laws  of 2019, is amended to read as
 follows:
  6. Notice. Every police officer, peace officer  or  district  attorney
 investigating  a  family  offense  under  this  article shall advise the
 victim of the availability of a shelter or other services in the  commu-
 nity,  and shall immediately give the victim written notice of the legal
 rights and remedies available to a victim of a family offense under  the
 relevant  provisions  of  this  chapter  and the family court act.  Such
 notice shall be prepared, at minimum, in plain English, Spanish, Chinese
 and Russian and if necessary,  shall  be  delivered  orally,  and  shall
 include but not be limited to the information contained in the following
 statement:
  "Are  you  the  victim of domestic violence? If you need help now, you
 can call 911 for the police to come to you. You can also call a domestic
 violence hotline. You can have a confidential talk with an  advocate  at
 the  hotline  about  help you can get in your community including: where
 you can get treatment for injuries, where you can get shelter, where you
 can get support, and what you can do to be  safe.  The  New  York  State
 24-hour  Domestic & Sexual Violence Hotline number is (insert the state-
 wide multilingual 800 number). They can give  you  information  in  many
 languages. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call 711.
  This is what the police can do:
  They can help you and your children find a safe place such as a family
 or friend's house or a shelter in your community.
  You  can ask the officer to take you or help you and your children get
 to a safe place in your community.
  They can help connect you to a local domestic violence program.
  They can help you get to a hospital or clinic for medical care.
  They can help you get your personal belongings.
  They must complete a report discussing the incident.  They  will  give
 you  a  copy  of  this  police report before they leave the scene. It is
 free.
 A. 3387  11
 
  They may, and sometimes must, arrest the person who harmed you if  you
 are  the victim of a crime. The person arrested could be released at any
 time, so it is important to plan for your safety.
  If  you  have  been abused or threatened, this is what you can ask the
 police or district attorney to do:
  File a criminal complaint against the person who harmed you.
  Ask the criminal court to issue an order of  protection  for  you  and
 your  child  if  the  district  attorney  files a criminal case with the
 court.
  Give you information about filing a family offense  petition  in  your
 local family court.
  You  also  have  the  right  to  ask  the family court for an order of
 protection for you and your children.
  This is what you can ask the family court to do:
  To have your family offense petition filed the  same  day  you  go  to
 court.
  To  have your request heard in court the same day you file or the next
 day court is open.
  Only a judge can issue an order of protection. The judge does that  as
 part  of  a  criminal or family court case against the person who harmed
 you. An order of protection in family court or  in  criminal  court  can
 say:
  That  the  other  person  have no contact or communication with you by
 mail, phone, computer or through other people.
  That the other person stay away from you and your children, your home,
 job or school.
  That the other person not  assault,  harass,  threaten,  strangle,  or
 commit another family offense against you or your children.
  That  the  other  person turn in their firearms and firearms licenses,
 and not get any more firearms.
  That you have temporary custody of your children.
  That the other person pay temporary child support.
  That the other person not harm your pets or service animals.
  If the family court is closed because it is night,  a  weekend,  or  a
 holiday,  you  can  go  to  a  criminal  court  to  ask  for an order of
 protection.
  If you do not speak English or cannot speak it well, you can  ask  the
 police,  the  district  attorney, or the criminal or family court to get
 you an interpreter who speaks your language. The  interpreter  can  help
 you explain what happened.
  You  can  get  the forms you need to ask for an order of protection at
 your local family court (insert addresses and  contact  information  for
 courts). You can also get them online: www.NYCourts.gov/forms.
  You do not need a lawyer to ask for an order of protection.
  You  have  a  right to get a lawyer in the family court. If the family
 court finds that you cannot afford to pay for a lawyer, it must get  you
 one for free.
  If you file a complaint or family court petition, you will be asked to
 swear to its truthfulness because it is a crime to file a legal document
 that you know is false."
  The  division  of  criminal  justice services in consultation with the
 state office [for the prevention of] TO END  domestic  AND  GENDER-BASED
 violence  shall  prepare the form of such written notice consistent with

 offenses  through  the criminal court at such time as such persons first
 come before the court and to the state department of health for distrib-
 ution  to all hospitals defined under article twenty-eight of the public
 health law. No cause of action for damages shall arise in favor  of  any
 person  by  reason  of any failure to comply with the provisions of this
 subdivision except upon a showing of gross negligence or willful miscon-
 duct.

 defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (h)  of  this
 section,  a  request  to designate an alternative mailing address, tele-

 number or other method of contact pursuant to this subsection  to:  make

 sure of all or part of  the  claim  related  information  to  which  the

 graph (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this section, a  request

 for  the  duration  of  the  order,  or until the request designating an
 alternative mailing address, telephone number or other method of contact
 is cancelled by the requesting person in writing, from disclosing to the
 person  against whom a valid order of protection was issued the address,
 telephone number or other method  of  contact  for  the  insured  person
 covered by the order of protection or for any person or entity providing

 method  of  contact  pursuant to this subsection to: make the request in
 writing; include in the request a statement that disclosure  of  all  or
 part  of  the  claim  related  information to which the request pertains
 could endanger the person or child; and specify an  alternative  mailing
 address,  telephone  number, or other method of contact. For the purpose
 of this subsection, "claim related information" means all claim or bill-
 ing information relating specifically to an insured or person covered by
 an insurance policy issued by an insurer other than a health insurer  as
 defined  in  subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this
 section. The superintendent, in consultation with  the  commissioner  of
 health,  the  office of children and family services and the office [for
 the prevention of] TO END  domestic  AND  GENDER-BASED  violence,  shall
 promulgate  rules  to  guide  and  enable  insurers to guard against the
