  ment practices

  Section 1. The insurance law is amended by adding a new section 2601-a
 to read as follows:
  § 2601-A. UNFAIR CLAIM SETTLEMENT PRACTICES;  CIVIL  REMEDY.  (A)  THE

 AGAINST ANY INSURER DOING BUSINESS IN THIS STATE FOR DAMAGES AS PROVIDED

 INSURER'S REFUSAL TO PAY OR UNREASONABLY DELAY PAYMENT  TO  THE  POLICY-
 HOLDER  OR INJURED PERSON OF AMOUNTS CLAIMED TO BE DUE UNDER A POLICY IS
 NOT REASONABLY JUSTIFIED. AN INSURER  IS  NOT  REASONABLY  JUSTIFIED  IN

  (1)  FAILS  TO  PROVIDE  THE  POLICYHOLDER  WITH  ACCURATE INFORMATION
 CONCERNING POLICY PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE COVERAGE AT ISSUE;
  (2) FAILS TO EFFECTUATE A PROMPT AND FAIR SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM OR ANY
 PORTION THEREOF, IN THAT THE INSURER (I) FAILS TO REASONABLY  ACCORD  AT
 LEAST  EQUAL  OR MORE FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION TO ITS INSURED'S INTERESTS
 AS IT DID TO ITS OWN INTERESTS, AND THEREBY EXPOSES  THE  INSURED  TO  A
 JUDGMENT  IN  EXCESS  OF THE POLICY LIMITS, OR (II) REFUSES TO SETTLE IN
 RESPONSE TO A FAIR AND REASONABLE SETTLEMENT  OFFER  WITHIN  THE  POLICY
 LIMITS FROM AN INJURED PARTY;
  (3) FAILS TO PROVIDE A TIMELY WRITTEN DENIAL OF A POLICYHOLDER'S CLAIM
 WITH  A  FULL  AND COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF SUCH DENIAL, INCLUDING REFER-
 ENCES TO SPECIFIC POLICY PROVISIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE;
  (4) FAILS TO MAKE A FINAL DETERMINATION AND NOTIFY THE POLICYHOLDER IN
 WRITING OF ITS POSITION ON BOTH LIABILITY FOR AND  THE  INSURER'S  VALU-

 ARTICLE OR ANY REGULATION PROMULGATED PURSUANT THERETO.
  (B)  ANY POLICYHOLDER WHO ESTABLISHES LIABILITY PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION
 (A) OF THIS SECTION SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER, IN ADDITION TO AMOUNTS

 REPRESENTATIVE AGAINST AN INSURER TO RECOVER DAMAGES INCLUDING COSTS AND
 DISBURSEMENTS, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES, INTER-
 EST FROM THE TIME OF FAILURE TO OFFER A FAIR AND  REASONABLE  SETTLEMENT
 IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THIS SECTION, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES AS DETERMINED BY
 THE FINDER OF FACT OR COURT, NOT LIMITED TO THE POLICY LIMITS,  WHERE  A
 PREPONDERANCE  OF  THE  EVIDENCE  ESTABLISHES  THAT THE INSURER FAILS TO
 EFFECTUATE A PROMPT AND FAIR SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM OR ANY PORTION THERE-

 FINDS  FOR  THE  CLAIMANT,  RECOVERY  SHALL  BE  IN THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL

 FINDER  OF  FACT  FINDS THAT THE UNFAIR CLAIM SETTLEMENT ACT OR PRACTICE
 WAS A WILLFUL OR KNOWING VIOLATION OF SUBSECTION  (A)  OR  (F)  OF  THIS
 SECTION  OR THAT THE REFUSAL TO GRANT RELIEF UPON DEMAND WAS NOT REASON-
 ABLY JUSTIFIED WITH KNOWLEDGE OR REASON TO KNOW THAT THE ACT OR PRACTICE

 PURPOSES  OF THIS CHAPTER, THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL DAMAGES TO BE MULTIPLIED
 BY THE FINDER OF FACT SHALL BE THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGES  AS  DETERMINED
 BY THE FINDER OF FACT ON ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE SAME AND UNDERLY-
 ING  TRANSACTION OR OCCURRENCE, REGARDLESS OF THE EXISTENCE OR NONEXIST-
 ENCE OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AVAILABLE IN PAYMENT OF THE CLAIM.  IN  ADDI-
 TION,  THE  COURT  SHALL AWARD SUCH OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF, INCLUDING AN

 MENTS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL NOT APPLY IF THE CLAIM IS ASSERTED BY WAY
 OF COUNTERCLAIM OR CROSS-CLAIM.
  (H) THE RIGHTS ENUMERATED IN THIS SECTION ARE NOT THE EXCLUSIVE  REME-
 DIES  AVAILABLE  TO THE POLICYHOLDER OR INJURED PERSON OR REPRESENTATIVE
 THEREOF INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A GUARDIAN, ADMINISTRATOR, EXECU-

 BY  JURY. NO MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN OR PART OF ANY WRIT-
 TEN CONTRACT FOR INSURANCE SHALL PROHIBIT AN  ACTION  PURSUANT  TO  THIS
 SECTION.
  §  2.  Section  3425  of  the insurance law is amended by adding a new
 subsection (t) to read as follows:
 A. 7139  4
 
  (T) NO INSURER SHALL REFUSE TO ISSUE OR RENEW A COVERED POLICY  SOLELY
 ON  THE  GROUNDS THAT THE POLICYHOLDER HAS BROUGHT AN ACTION PURSUANT TO
 SECTION TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED ONE-A OF THIS CHAPTER.
  §  3.  Paragraph  4 of subsection (a) of section 2601 of the insurance
 law, as amended by chapter 547 of the laws of 1997, is amended  to  read
 as follows:

 CLAIM  OR  ANY  PORTION THEREOF, IN THAT THE INSURER FAILS TO REASONABLY
 ACCORD AT LEAST EQUAL OR MORE FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION TO  ITS  INSURED'S
 INTERESTS  AS  IT  DID  TO  ITS  OWN  INTERESTS, AND THEREBY EXPOSES THE
 INSURED TO A JUDGMENT IN EXCESS OF THE POLICY LIMITS, except where there
 is a reasonable basis supported by specific  information  available  for
 review  by the department that the claimant has caused the loss to occur
 by arson. After receiving a properly executed proof of loss, the insurer
 shall advise the claimant of acceptance or denial of  the  claim  within
 thirty working days;
  §  4. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law and shall apply to  all
 acts  and  omissions  by  insurers  occurring on or after such effective
 date.
