  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  preliminary
 census  data  collected  as  of  June  30, 2023. The census data for the
 impacted population is summarized below.

  Active Members
 
  - Number Count:  1
  - Average Age:  36.0
  - Average Service:  7.0
  - Average Salary:  92,200
 
  BACKGROUND:  Mr. DeTiberiis is currently employed by the New York City
 Department of Education. He joined TRS in September 2016  as  a  Tier  6
 member.  Previously he was employed by the City of Yonkers Parks Depart-
 ment from September 18, 2009 through February 28, 2014.
  The proposed legislation would allow Mr. DeTiberiis to receive service
 credit  in  TRS for his employment with the Yonkers Parks Department and
 apply for a Tier 4 membership with a refund of past Tier 6 contributions
 that exceed the applicable Tier 4 contribution rate. A change from  Tier
 6  to  Tier 4 would result in an earlier date of retirement eligibility,
 lower overall prospective employee contribution rates, a larger benefit,
 and a three-year (as opposed to a five-year) final average salary.
  ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The  estimates  presented  herein  have  been
 calculated  based  on the Revised 2021 Actuarial Assumptions and Methods
 of the impacted retirement systems.
  RISK AND UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal  Note  depend
 highly  on  the  actuarial  assumptions, methods, and models used, demo-
 graphics of the impacted population, and other factors such  as  invest-
 ment,  contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from
 actuarial  assumptions,  the  actual  costs  could  differ  from  those
 presented  herein.  Quantifying  these risks is beyond the scope of this
 Fiscal Note.
  This Fiscal Note is intended to measure  pension-related  impacts  and
 does  not  include other potential costs (e.g., administrative and Other
 Postemployment Benefits).

 sky are members of the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy  of
 Actuaries.  We  are  members of NYCERS but do not believe it impairs our
 objectivity and we meet the  Qualification  Standards  of  the  American
 Academy  of  Actuaries to render the actuarial opinion contained herein.
 To the best of our knowledge, the results  contained  herein  have  been
 prepared  in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and

 2024 was prepared by the Chief Actuary for the New York City  Retirement
 Systems and Pension Funds. This estimate is intended for use only during
