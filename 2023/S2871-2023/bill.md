 be written or printed the ballot scanner or ballot marking device serial

 machine custodian. The envelope containing the keys shall not be  opened
 until at least one inspector from each of the two parties shall be pres-

 that it has not been opened. Before opening the envelope, such  election
 inspectors  present  shall examine the serial number on the machine, and
 shall see if they are the same as the numbers written  on  the  envelope
 containing  the  keys.  If  found not to agree, the envelope must not be
 opened until the voting machine custodian, or other  authorized  person,

 examine the printed record produced by the  machine  to  see  that  each
 counter  registers zero, and shall allow watchers to examine the printed
 record.  The inspectors shall then sign a certificate showing the deliv-
 ery of the keys in a sealed envelope, the serial number on the  machine,
 the  number  registered on the protective counter, that all the counters
 are set at zero and that the public counter is set at zero. The  machine
 shall  remain secured against voting until the polls are formally opened
 and shall not be operated except by voters when voting  or  by  election
 officials upon the instructions of the board of elections. If any count-
 er is found not to register zero, the inspectors of election shall imme-
 diately notify the board of elections.
  §  2. This act shall take effect on the first of January next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become a law.
