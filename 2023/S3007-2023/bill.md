 Introduced  by  Sen.  CLEARE -- read twice and ordered printed, and when

 AN ACT to amend the executive  law,  in  relation  to  establishing  the
  office for an age-friendly New York
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and intent. Because aging is a process
 we all experience, New Yorkers of all ages do better when we  make  sure
 everyone  can  age  successfully. New York state was named the first Age
 Friendly State in the country in 2017 by AARP and remains  committed  to
 being  age-friendly  so  that  all  New Yorkers can age with dignity and
 independence.  New York's older adult population is 3.5 million  strong.
 Older New Yorkers make our state a healthier, stronger, and more vibrant
 place  to live, through multiple ways including paid and volunteer work,
 raising and mentoring younger New Yorkers,  supporting  their  families,
 sharing their wisdom, and starting new businesses.
  Nearly  1  in 6 New Yorkers is over the age of 65, and that population
 will continue to grow. Between 2015 and 2040, the number of New  Yorkers
 aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 50 percent, while the popu-
 lation  aged  85 and older is projected to double. Shifts in the state's
 aging population will present new  demands  and  opportunities  for  the
 state,  local  governments,  families,  and older New Yorkers. All older
 adults must have the option to remain in their communities as they  age,
 and  that  must  be  a meaningful choice with access to a broad range of
 programs, resources and supports, including safe and affordable housing,
 healthcare, home care, food and nutrition, human services, and transpor-
 tation. An inclusive state for New Yorkers of all ages remains our goal.
  Older adults' health and well-being improves  when  they  have  varied
 opportunities  to stay socially engaged. The state must do everything it
 can to reduce isolation and ensure that all  communities  have  opportu-
 nities  for seniors to interact.  Reliable and safe ways to access these

 opportunities allows older adults to be thriving contributors  in  their
 communities.
  As  New York's older adult population grows, it will continue becoming
 more diverse and may be more likely to be childless,  live  alone,  work
 longer,  have lower incomes, or have less retirement savings, presenting
 new challenges for the state and local  governments.  These  demographic
 shifts necessitate strategic and adaptive policy changes.
  Actively  engaging older adults as contributors to the social, econom-
 ic, and civic  fabric  of  our  communities,  encouraging  physical  and
 psychological  health  and well-being in older adults and their caregiv-
 ers, and supporting direct care workers and family  caregivers  as  they
 provide essential care for older adults makes New York better. Only when
 we  acknowledge  the  talents  and  contributions of all New Yorkers, no
 matter their age, can we adapt to future demands.  To be a  truly  age-
 friendly  state,  it is vital that the state have a member of the gover-
 nor's staff whose role is coordinating age-friendly services  and  poli-
 cies across agencies.
