  § 447-b. Services for exploited [children]  INDIVIDUALS.  1.  Notwith-
 standing  any  inconsistent provision of law, pursuant to regulations of
 the office of children and family services, every local social  services
 district  shall as a component of the district's multi-year consolidated
 services  child  welfare  services  plan  address  the  [child]  welfare
 services  needs  of sexually exploited [children] INDIVIDUALS and to the
 extent that funds are available  specifically  therefor  ensure  that  a
 short-term  safe  house  or another short-term safe placement such as an
 approved runaway and homeless youth program, approved respite or  crisis
 program  providing crisis intervention or respite services or community-
 A. 3386  12
 
 based program to serve  sexually  exploited  [children]  INDIVIDUALS  is
 available  to  [children] INDIVIDUALS residing in such district. Nothing
 in this section shall prohibit a local  social  services  district  from
 utilizing existing respite or crisis intervention services already oper-
 ated  by  such  social  services  district or homeless youth programs or
 services for victims of human trafficking pursuant to article  ten-D  of
 this  chapter  so  long  as  the staff members have received appropriate
 training approved by the office of children and family services  regard-
 ing  sexually exploited [children] INDIVIDUALS and the existing programs
 and facilities provide a safe, secure and  appropriate  environment  for
 sexually  exploited  [children]  INDIVIDUALS.  Crisis  intervention
 services, short-term safe house  care  and  community-based  programming
 may,  where  appropriate, be provided by the same not-for-profit agency.
 Local social services districts may work cooperatively to  provide  such
 short-term  safe  house or other short-term safe placement, services and
 programming and access to such placement, services and  programming  may
 be  provided  on  a  regional basis, provided, however, that every local
 social services district shall to the extent that  funds  are  available
 ensure  that  such  placement,  services  and  programs shall be readily
 accessible to sexually exploited [children] INDIVIDUALS residing  within
 the district.
  2.  All  of  the  services created under this title may, to the extent
 possible provided by law, be available to all sexually exploited  [chil-
 dren]  INDIVIDUALS whether they are accessed voluntarily, as a condition
 of an adjournment in  contemplation  of  dismissal  issued  in  criminal
 court,  through  the  diversion  services  created  under  section seven
 hundred thirty-five of the family court act, through a proceeding  under
 article three of the family court act, a proceeding under article ten of
 the  family court act or through a referral from a local social services
 agency.
  3. The capacity of the crisis  intervention  services  and  community-
 based  programs in subdivision one of this section shall be based on the
 number of sexually exploited [children] INDIVIDUALS in each district who
 are in need of such services. A determination of such need shall be made
 in two thousand ten and every five  years  thereafter  in  every  social
 services  district  by  the local commissioner of social services and be
 included in the integrated county plan. Such determination shall be made
 in consultation with local law enforcement, runaway and  homeless  youth
 program  providers,  local  probation departments, local social services
 commissioners, the runaway and homeless youth coordinator for the  local
 social  services  district,  local  law guardians, presentment agencies,
 public defenders and district attorney's offices and child advocates and
 services providers who work directly with sexually exploited youth.
  4. In determining the need for and capacity of  the  services  created
 under  this section, each local social services district shall recognize
 that sexually exploited youth have separate and distinct  service  needs
 according  to  gender and, where a local social services district deter-
 mines that the need exists, to the  extent  that  funds  are  available,
 appropriate programming shall be made available.
  5.  To  the  extent  funds are specifically appropriated therefor, the
 office of children and family services shall contract with an  appropri-
 ate  not-for-profit  agency  with  experience  working  with  sexually
 exploited [children] INDIVIDUALS to operate at least one long-term  safe
 house  in  a  geographically  appropriate  area of the state which shall
 provide safe and secure long term housing and specialized  services  for
 sexually  exploited  [children]  INDIVIDUALS  throughout  the state. The
 A. 3386  13
 
 appropriateness of the geographic location shall  be  determined  taking
 into  account  the  areas  of  the  state  with high numbers of sexually
 exploited [children] INDIVIDUALS and the  need  for  sexually  exploited
 [children]  INDIVIDUALS  to  find  shelter  and long term placement in a
 region that cannot be readily accessed by  the  perpetrators  of  sexual
 exploitation.  The  need for more than one long-term safe house shall be
 determined by the office of children and family services  based  on  the
 numbers and geographical location of sexually exploited [children] INDI-
 VIDUALS  within the state. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude
 an agency from applying for and accepting grants, gifts and bequests  of
 funds  from  private individuals, foundations and the federal government
 for the purpose of creating or carrying out the duties  of  a  long-term
 safe house.
  6.  The  local  social  services  commissioner may, to the extent that
 funds are available,  in  conjunction  with  the  division  of  criminal
 justice  services  and local law enforcement officials, contract with an
 appropriate not-for-profit agency with experience working with  sexually
 exploited  [children] INDIVIDUALS to train law enforcement officials who
 are likely to encounter sexually exploited [children] INDIVIDUALS in the
 course of their law enforcement duties on the provisions of this section
 and how  to  identify  and  obtain  appropriate  services  for  sexually
 exploited  [children]  INDIVIDUALS.  Local social services districts may
 work cooperatively to provide such training and  such  training  may  be
 provided  on a regional basis. The division of criminal justice services
 shall assist local social services districts in obtaining any  available
 funds  for  the purposes of conducting law enforcement training from the
 federal justice department and the office of juvenile justice and delin-
 quency prevention.
