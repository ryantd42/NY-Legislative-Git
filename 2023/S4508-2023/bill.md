 ted by the Ixodes dammini tick and is  commonly  referred  to  as  "Lyme
 disease".  In any case where a hospital or other health care institution
 or provider has custody or control of the medical records for a  patient
 so  diagnosed,  upon  request such physician shall be entitled to review

 basis to believe that  the  order  provided  for  herein  has  not  been
 complied  with,  shall  be entitled to apply to a justice of the supreme
 court for an order requiring  any  such  physician  to  submit  for  the

 cian  shall, consistent with customary and acceptable medical standards,
 take such action he OR SHE deems necessary to inform such patient or  in
