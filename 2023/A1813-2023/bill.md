  3.  THE  PARTICIPATION  BY  ANY  INDIVIDUAL  IN ANY PROGRAM UNDER THIS
 SECTION SHALL BE WHOLLY VOLUNTARY AND SHALL NOT  BE  A  PREREQUISITE  TO
 ELIGIBILITY FOR, OR RECEIPT OF, ANY OTHER SERVICE OR ASSISTANCE FROM, OR
 TO  PARTICIPATION  IN,  ANY  OTHER  PROGRAM.  ALL  TEST RESULTS, MEDICAL
 RECORDS  AND  ANY  OTHER  INFORMATION  REGARDING  FAMILIAL DYSAUTONOMIA,
