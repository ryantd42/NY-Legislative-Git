  Section 1. Paragraph 21 of subsection  (i)  of  section  3216  of  the

  (21)  Every policy that provides coverage for prescription drugs shall
 include coverage for the cost of enteral, INFANT AND BABY  formulas  for
 home  use,  whether administered orally or via tube feeding, for which a
 physician or other licensed health care provider legally  authorized  to
 prescribe  under  title  eight of the education law has issued a written
 order. Such written order shall state that the enteral, INFANT AND  BABY

 for  which  enteral, INFANT AND BABY formulas have been proven effective
 shall include, but are not limited to, inherited diseases of amino  acid
 or  organic  acid  metabolism; Crohn's Disease; gastroesophageal reflux;
 disorders of gastrointestinal motility such as chronic intestinal  pseu-
 do-obstruction;  and  multiple, severe food allergies including, but not
 limited to immunoglobulin E and nonimmunoglobulin  E-mediated  allergies
 to  multiple  food  proteins;  severe food protein induced enterocolitis
 syndrome; eosinophilic disorders; and impaired absorption  of  nutrients
 caused  by disorders affecting the absorptive surface, function, length,
 and motility of the gastrointestinal tract.  Enteral,  INFANT  AND  BABY

 to multiple food proteins; severe  food  protein  induced  enterocolitis
 syndrome;  eosinophilic  disorders; and impaired absorption of nutrients
 caused by disorders affecting the absorptive surface, function,  length,
 and  motility  of  the  gastrointestinal tract. Enteral, INFANT AND BABY
 formulas that are medically necessary and taken under written order from

  § 4. The opening paragraph  of  paragraph  25  of  subsection  (b)  of
 section 4322 of the insurance law, as amended by chapter 388 of the laws
 of 2013, is amended to read as follows:
  Prescription  drugs,  OBTAINED  AT  A  PARTICIPATING  PHARMACY UNDER A
 PRESCRIPTION WRITTEN BY AN IN-PLAN OR  OUT-OF-PLAN  PROVIDER,  including
 contraceptive  drugs  or  devices  approved by the federal food and drug
 administration or generic equivalents approved as  substitutes  by  such
 food  and drug administration [and], nutritional supplements (formulas),
 whether administered orally or via a feeding tube  for  the  therapeutic
 treatment of phenylketonuria, branched-chain ketonuria, galactosemia and
 homocystinuria[,  obtained  at  a  participating  pharmacy  under  a
 prescription written by an in-plan or out-of-plan provider]  AND  INFANT
 AND  BABY  FORMULAS FOR HOME USE FOR WHICH A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER LICENSED
 HEALTH CARE PROVIDER LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO PRESCRIBE UNDER  TITLE  EIGHT
 OF  THE  EDUCATION  LAW  HAS  ISSUED A WRITTEN ORDER. SUCH WRITTEN ORDER
 SHALL STATE THAT THE INFANT OR BABY FORMULA IS CLEARLY MEDICALLY  NECES-
 SARY AND HAS BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE AS A DISEASE-SPECIFIC TREATMENT REGI-
 MEN  FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OR WILL BECOME MALNOURISHED OR SUFFER
 FROM DISORDERS, WHICH IF LEFT UNTREATED, CAUSE CHRONIC PHYSICAL DISABIL-
 ITY, MENTAL RETARDATION OR DEATH. SPECIFIC DISEASES FOR WHICH INFANT AND
 BABY FORMULAS HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE  SHALL  INCLUDE,  BUT  ARE  NOT
 LIMITED TO, INHERITED DISEASES OF AMINO ACID OR ORGANIC ACID METABOLISM;
 CROHN'S  DISEASE; GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX WITH FAILURE TO THRIVE; DISOR-
 DERS OF GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY SUCH AS CHRONIC INTESTINAL  PSEUDO-OB-
 STRUCTION;  AND  MULTIPLE, SEVERE FOOD ALLERGIES WHICH IF LEFT UNTREATED
 WILL CAUSE MALNOURISHMENT, CHRONIC PHYSICAL DISABILITY, MENTAL  RETARDA-
 TION  OR  DEATH.  INFANT AND BABY FORMULAS WHICH ARE MEDICALLY NECESSARY
 AND TAKEN UNDER WRITTEN ORDER FROM A  PHYSICIAN  FOR  THE  TREATMENT  OF
 SPECIFIC  DISEASES  SHALL  BE DISTINGUISHED FROM NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS
 TAKEN ELECTIVELY. COVERAGE FOR INFANT AND BABY FORMULAS FOR ANY CALENDAR
 YEAR OR ANY CONTINUOUS PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS FOR ANY INSURED  INDIVID-
 UAL  SHALL  BE  NO LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS.  Health maintenance
 organizations, in addition to providing coverage for prescription  drugs
 at  a participating pharmacy, may utilize a mail order prescription drug
 program. Health maintenance organizations may provide prescription drugs
 pursuant to a drug formulary; however, health maintenance  organizations
 must  implement  an  appeals  process  so  that the use of non-formulary
 prescription drugs may be requested by a physician or other provider.
  § 5. This act shall take effect on the first of January next  succeed-
 ing  the date on which it shall have become a law and shall apply to all
 policies and contracts issued, renewed, modified, altered, or amended on
 or after such date.
