  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of serious issues
that affect the lives of the residents of the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern  and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  17,  2023,  as
Telecommunication  and Information Society Day in the State of New York,
in conjunction  with  the  observance  of  World  Telecommunication  and
Information Society Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  ongoing  COVID-19 crisis has not only highlighted the
critical role of information and communication technologies  (ICTs)  for
continued  functioning of societies but has also brought to the fore the
startling digital inequalities between and within countries; and
 
  WHEREAS, International Telecommunication Union  (ITU)  members  have
stepped  up  and  engaged  in  activities  that have proven essential in
saving lives and sustaining  economies;  they  have  demonstrated  their
remarkable resilience in the face of challenging times; and
 
  WHEREAS, At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the
urgency  of  accelerating digital transformation and advancing the goals
and targets of the Connect 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind; and
 
  WHEREAS, World Telecommunication and Information Society Day (WTISD)
2023 is an opportunity for  ITU  membership  to  continue  to  push  for
digital  transformation  by  promoting  national  strategies  on  ICT
development, smart policies to encourage investments,  cooperation,  and
partnership; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be done to increase  activity  at  the
local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  17,  2023,  as
Telecommunication  and Information Society Day in the State of New York;
and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
