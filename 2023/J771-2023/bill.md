who work every day  to  make  New  York  more  productive  and  fiscally
healthier and stronger; and
 
  WHEREAS, This Legislative Body also remembers the Haymarket rally in
Chicago  in  1886, generally considered significant as the origin of May
Day, observing workers' rightful demands for an eight-hour workday; and
 
  WHEREAS, During this month, the strong union traditions in New  York
State  as  well as the belief in hard work and work ethics for union and
non-union workers are proudly recognized and observed as  are  New  York
workers'  freedom  to  organize in unions and for collective bargaining;
and
 
  WHEREAS, May 1st is recognized and celebrated across  the  world  as
May Day; now, therefore, be it
