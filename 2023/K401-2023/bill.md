  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Huntington's Disease Awareness Month in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
illnesses that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as  Huntington's
Disease  Awareness  Month  in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observance of National Huntington's Disease Awareness Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Huntington's  disease  is  a  devastating,  hereditary,
degenerative  brain  disorder  for which there is presently no effective
treatment or cure; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Huntington's  disease  slowly  diminishes  the  affected
individual's  ability to walk, think, talk and reason, eventually making
the person totally dependent upon others for his or her care; and
 
  WHEREAS, Huntington's disease profoundly affects the lives of entire
families emotionally, socially and economically; and
 
  WHEREAS, Currently, more than a quarter of a million Americans  have
been  diagnosed with Huntington's disease or are "at risk" of inheriting
the illness from an affected parent; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Albany affiliate of the Huntington's Disease Society of
America, now known as the Albany Chapter  of  the  Huntington's  Disease
Society  of  America,  was  formed  in  2011, with a mission of bringing
awareness to the general public regarding Huntington's  disease  and  to
raise funds to be used for research, care and education; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
Huntington's Disease, and more must be done to increase activity at  the
local,  state  and national levels to support those afflicted as well as
their families and caregivers; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Huntington's
Disease Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York; and the Albany Chapter of  the  Huntington's  Disease  Society  of
America.
