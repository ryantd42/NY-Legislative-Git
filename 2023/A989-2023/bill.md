 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

 mum feasible participation by minority and women owned  business  enter-
 prises  adopted  pursuant  to  this  article  and the regulations of the

 pursuant to subdivision six of  this  section  on  the  website  of  the
 contracting  agency;  shall require the contracting agency to notify the
 contractor in writing within a period of time specified by the  director
 as  to  any deficiencies contained in the contractor's utilization plan;
 shall require remedy thereof within a period of time  specified  by  the
 director;  shall  require the contractor to submit [periodic] compliance
 reports relating to the operation and implementation of any  utilization
 plan; shall not allow any automatic waivers but shall allow a contractor
 to  apply  for a partial or total waiver of the minority and women-owned
 business enterprise participation requirements pursuant to  subdivisions
 six  and  seven  of  this  section;  shall  allow a contractor to file a
 complaint with the  director  pursuant  to  subdivision  eight  of  this
 section in the event a contracting agency has failed or refused to issue
 a  waiver  of  the  minority and women-owned business enterprise partic-
 ipation requirements or has denied such request for a waiver; and  shall
 allow  a contracting agency to file a complaint with the director pursu-
 ant to subdivision nine of this section in the  event  a  contractor  is
 failing  or has failed to comply with the minority and women-owned busi-
 ness enterprise  participation  requirements  set  forth  in  the  state
 contract where no waiver has been granted.
  (b) The rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this subdivision
 regarding  a  utilization plan shall provide that where enterprises have
 been identified within a utilization plan, a contractor  shall  attempt,
 in  good  faith, to utilize such enterprise at least to the extent indi-
 cated. A contracting agency may require a contractor to indicate, within
 a utilization plan, what measures and procedures he or  she  intends  to
 take to comply with the provisions of this article, but may not require,
 as  a  condition  of  award  of,  or  compliance with, a contract that a
 contractor  utilize  a  particular  enterprise  in  performance  of  the
 contract.
  (c) THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION
 REGARDING  COMPLIANCE  REPORTS  SHALL  PROVIDE  THAT  SUCH REPORTS SHALL
 INCLUDE A STANDARDIZED PREPAYMENT DECLARATION, TO  BE  COMPLETED  BEFORE
 EACH  PAYMENT  TO  A  CONTRACTOR,  IN WHICH: (I) A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
 CONTRACTOR LISTS ANY BUSINESS THAT WAS OR SHALL BE RELIED UPON FOR CRED-
 IT TOWARD MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION AND
 STATES UNDER  PENALTY  OF  PERJURY  THAT  SUCH  BUSINESS  OR  BUSINESSES
 APPEARED  ON  THE  DIVISION'S DIRECTORY OF CERTIFIED MINORITY AND WOMEN-
 OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AT THE TIME  OF  CONTRACTING  AND  THAT  EACH
 BUSINESS  PERFORMED  OR  SHALL PERFORM A COMMERCIALLY USEFUL FUNCTION ON
 THE CONTRACT; AND (II) A REPRESENTATIVE OF  ANY  BUSINESS  THAT  WAS  OR
 SHALL BE RELIED UPON FOR CREDIT TOWARD MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS
 ENTERPRISE  PARTICIPATION  STATES  UNDER  PENALTY  OF  PERJURY  THAT  IT
 APPEARED ON THE DIVISION'S DIRECTORY OF CERTIFIED  MINORITY  AND  WOMEN-
 OWNED  BUSINESS  ENTERPRISES AT THE TIME OF CONTRACTING AND PERFORMED OR
 SHALL PERFORM A COMMERCIALLY  USEFUL  FUNCTION  ON  THE  CONTRACT.  SUCH
 STANDARDIZED  PREPAYMENT  DECLARATIONS SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY
 ON A CENTRALIZED STATE REGISTRY DESIGNATED BY THE DIVISION PRIOR TO  ANY
 PAYMENT  TO A CONTRACTOR. THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT
 TO THIS SUBDIVISION MAY ALSO REQUIRE THE CONTRACTOR OR SUBCONTRACTOR  TO
 SUBMIT  DOCUMENTATION, AS NEEDED, TO SUPPORT ANY STATEMENTS MADE IN SUCH
 STANDARDIZED PREPAYMENT DECLARATIONS.
  (D) Without limiting other grounds for the disqualification of bids or
 proposals on the basis of non-responsibility, a contracting  agency  may
 disqualify  the bid or proposal of a contractor as being non-responsible
 for failure to remedy notified deficiencies contained  in  the  contrac-
 A. 989  3
 
 tor's  utilization plan within a period of time specified in regulations
 promulgated by the director after receiving notification of  such  defi-
 ciencies  from the contracting agency. Where failure to remedy any noti-
 fied  deficiency  in  the utilization plan is a ground for disqualifica-
 tion, that issue and all other grounds  for  disqualification  shall  be
 stated in writing by the contracting agency. Where the contracting agen-
 cy states that a failure to remedy any notified deficiency in the utili-
 zation  plan  is  a  ground for disqualification the contractor shall be
 entitled to an  administrative  hearing,  on  a  record,  involving  all
 grounds  stated  by  the  contracting  agency.  Such  hearing  shall  be
 conducted by the appropriate authority  of  the  contracting  agency  to
 review  the  determination  of  disqualification. A final administrative
 determination made following such  hearing  shall  be  reviewable  in  a
 proceeding  commenced  under article seventy-eight of the civil practice
 law and rules, provided that such proceeding is commenced within  thirty
 days  of  the  notice  given  by certified mail return receipt requested
 rendering such final administrative determination. Such proceeding shall
 be commenced in the supreme court, appellate division, third  department
 and  such  proceeding  shall  be  preferred  over all other civil causes
 except election causes, and shall be heard and determined in  preference
 to  all  other  civil business pending therein, except election matters,
 irrespective of position on the calendar. Appeals taken to the court  of
 appeals  of  the  state of New York shall be subject to the same prefer-
 ence.
