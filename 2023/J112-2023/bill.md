  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January  8-14,  2023,  as  Home  Office  Safety  and
  Security Week in the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of  New  York takes great pride in recognizing
official weeks established to increase awareness of serious issues  that
affect the lives of all New Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 8-14,  2023,  as  Home  Office
Safety  and  Security Week in the State of New York, in conjunction with
the observation of National Home Office Safety and Security Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Having  a  home  office  is  the  dream  of  thousands  of
Americans,  and  it  is a goal that is becoming more and more achievable
every  day  due  to  technological  breakthroughs  constantly  being
discovered;  while the excitement of setting up a home office is a happy
feeling, many fail to recognize common dangers  within  their  new  work
environment; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Home Office Safety and Security Week is a time to focus on
these potential hazards  and  encourage  business  owners  to  evaluate,
assess  and  implement proper security and safety measures in their home
offices; and
 
  WHEREAS, Some of the essential components of  a  safe  home  working
environment  include  privacy  and  data  security,  physical  security,
physical safety for adults and children, and proper information storage;
and
 
  WHEREAS, There are a number of ways to increase home  office  safety
and security: implement a regular cleaning schedule to avoid a number of
hazards, avoid risks of fire by installing both smoke detectors and fire
extinguishers  and prepare an exit strategy in case a fire should occur,
and arrange for children to be supervised at all times; and
 
  WHEREAS, It  is  also  important  to  stress  that  all  information
pertaining  to  the  business  and  its  clients  is stored properly and
securely; and
 
  WHEREAS, Continued improvement in home office safety and security is
the responsibility of all business owners; by  recognizing  Home  Office
Safety  and Security Week, it is hoped that more New Yorkers will become
vigilant in ensuring that their home office is a  safe  place  to  work;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  January  8-14,  2023,  as
Home Office Safety and Security Week in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
