worked making handmade pasta; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1963,  at the age of 21, Romolo Pede Sr. immigrated to
the United States and settled  in  Schenectady,  New  York;  soon  after

products; and

socializing with friends and playing cards; and
 
  WHEREAS, In the  fall  months,  Romolo  Pede  Sr.  found  great  joy
bringing  his Italian heritage of winemaking to the community by selling
wine grapes; he took pride in making wine and especially loved  teaching
others  the art of winemaking while sharing a glass of his award-winning
wine; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  a  steadfast  and  unwavering  commitment  to  his
community,  Romolo  Pede  Sr.  was  a  proud  member  of  the  Grabriele
D'Annunzio Lodge No.  321 Order of the Sons and Daughters  of  Italy  in
America; and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  he  was passionate about many things, above all his

moment of the wonderful life he and Rose created with their family; and
