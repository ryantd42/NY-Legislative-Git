  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
 proposing  an  amendment to section 14 of article 3 of the constitution,
  in relation to limiting the use of messages of necessity

  Section 1. Resolved (if the Assembly concur), That section 14 of arti-
 cle 3 of the constitution be amended to read as follows:
  § 14. No bill shall be passed or become a law  unless  it  shall  have
 been  printed  and  upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at
 least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage, unless
 the governor, or the acting governor, shall have certified, under his or
 her hand and the seal of the state, the facts which in his or her  opin-
 ion necessitate an immediate vote thereon TO RESPOND TO A STATE DISASTER
 EMERGENCY, AS DEFINED BY PARAGRAPH B OF SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION TWEN-
 TY  OF  THE EXECUTIVE LAW in which case it must nevertheless be upon the
 desks of the members in final form, not necessarily printed, before  its
 final  passage;  nor shall any bill be passed or become a law, except by
 the assent of a majority of the members elected to each  branch  of  the
 legislature;  and  upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereof
 shall be allowed, and the question upon its final passage shall be taken
 immediately thereafter, and the ayes and nays entered on the journal.
  For purposes of this section, a bill shall be deemed to be printed and
 upon the desks of the members if: it is set forth in a legible electron-
 ic format by electronic means, and it is available for  review  in  such
 format  at the desks of the members. For purposes of this section "elec-
 tronic means" means any method of transmission  of  information  between
 computers  or  other  machines  designed  for the purpose of sending and
 receiving  such  transmissions  and  which:  allows  the  recipient  to
 reproduce  the  information  transmitted  in  a  tangible  medium  of
 expression; and does not permit additions, deletions or other changes to
 be made without leaving an adequate record thereof.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
