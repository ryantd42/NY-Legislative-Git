 AN ACT to amend the private housing finance  law,  in  relation  to  the
  supervision of certain limited profit housing companies

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision 7 of section 32 of the private housing  finance
 law,  as  amended by chapter 550 of the laws of 1968, is amended to read
 as follows:
  7. Whenever the commissioner, in the case of a company undertaking  or
 otherwise operating a state-aided project, or the supervising agency, in
 the  case of a company undertaking or otherwise operating a municipally-
 aided project, shall be of the opinion that such company is  failing  or
 omitting,  or  is about to fail or omit to do anything required of it by
 law or by order of the commissioner or  is  doing  or  is  about  to  do
 anything,  or  permitting anything, or is about to permit anything to be
 done, contrary to and in violation of law or of any order, regulation or
 directive of the commissioner or the supervising agency, as the case may
 be, or which is improvident  or  prejudicial  to  the  interest  of  the
 public,  the  lienholders, the stockholders, or the tenants, the commis-
 sioner or the supervising agency, as the case may be, [may, in  addition
 to  such  other  remedies as may be available, commence] SHALL TAKE SUCH
 STEPS, AS MAY BE NECESSARY AND PROPER TO EFFECT SUCH REMEDIES AS MAY  BE
 AVAILABLE. SUCH REMEDY MAY INCLUDE COMMENCING an action or proceeding in
 the  supreme  court  of the state of New York in the name of the commis-
 sioner or the supervising agency, as the case may be, for the purpose of
 having such violations or threatened violations stopped  and  prevented,
 and  in  such  action or proceeding the court may appoint a temporary or
 permanent receiver or both. Such action or proceeding shall be commenced
 by a petition to the supreme court, alleging the violation complained of

 and praying for appropriate relief. It shall thereupon be  the  duty  of
 the  court  to specify the time, not exceeding twenty days after service
 of a copy of the petition, within which the company complained  of  must
 answer  the  petition.  In case of any default or after answer the court
 shall immediately inquire into  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  such
 manner  as the court shall direct without other or formal pleadings, and
 without respect to any technical requirements.  Such  other  persons  or
 corporations  as  it shall seem to the court necessary or proper to join
 as parties in order to make its order  or  judgment  effective,  may  be
 joined  as  parties. The final judgment in any such action or proceeding
 shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that an order or
 an injunction, or both, issue, or  provide  for  the  appointment  of  a
 receiver  as  prayed for in the petition, and grant such other relief as
 the court may deem appropriate.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
