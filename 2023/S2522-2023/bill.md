 tary conditions; [or]

 able  person  or  property,  or  any  charge of criminal possession of a
 firearm as defined in section 265.01-b  of  the  penal  law  where  such
 charge  arose from conduct occurring while the defendant was released on
 his or her own recognizance, released under conditions, or had yet to be
 arraigned after the issuance of a desk appearance ticket for a  separate
 felony  or  class A misdemeanor involving harm to an identifiable person
 or property, provided, however, that the prosecutor must show reasonable
 cause to believe that the defendant committed the instant crime and  any

 underlying crimes need not be a qualifying offense as  defined  in  this
 subdivision.  For  the purposes of this paragraph, "harm to an identifi-
 able person or property" shall include but not be limited to theft of or
 damage to property. However, based upon a review of the facts alleged in
