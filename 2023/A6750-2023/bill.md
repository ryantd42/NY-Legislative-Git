  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  SUMMARY  OF BILL: This proposed legislation would amend Retirement and
 Social Security Law (RSSL) and Administrative Code of the  City  of  New
 York  (ACCNY)  to  permit  certain correction officer members of the New
 York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS), who are participants in
 the Tier 2 and Tier 3 20-Year Improved Benefit  Program  for  correction
 officers  (CO-20  Plans) and such Plans for ranks of correction captains
 and above (CC-20 Plans), to take loans against their  accumulated  Addi-
 tional Member Contributions (AMC) with interest.
  Effective Date: Upon enactment.
  BACKGROUND:  NYCERS  members  who participate in the Tier 2 and Tier 3
 CO-20 and CC-20  Plans  are  generally  permitted,  subject  to  certain
 restrictions,  to  borrow  up  to  75% of the value of their accumulated
 Basic  Member  Contributions  (BMC)  with  interest.  However,  these
 correction  members  are  currently not permitted to take loans on their
 AMC.
  The proposed legislation would permit NYCERS members who  are  partic-
 ipants  in the Tier 2 CO-20 and CC-20 Plans to borrow 100% of their AMC,
 and permit Tier 3 CO-20 and CC-20 Plan participants to borrow up to  75%
 of their AMC. The loans on the AMC would be in addition to the currently
 permissible loans of BMC for such Plans.
  FINANCIAL  IMPACT - RELATED TO OUTSTANDING LOANS AT RETIREMENT: In the
 event an outstanding loan balance exists at retirement, the  balance  of
 A. 6750  3

 the unpaid loan is converted to an annuity based on the yield on 30-year
 U.S.  Treasury securities and deducted from the annual retirement allow-
 ance otherwise payable. This conversion is made on  an  actuarial  basis
 that is different than the basis used to determine the employer contrib-
 ution  to  NYCERS. As a result of this difference in actuarial bases and
 based on the census data and actuarial assumptions and methods described
 herein, the enactment of this proposed legislation  would  increase  the
 Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) by approximately $7.4 million.
  Under  the Entry Age Normal cost method used to determine the employer
 contributions to NYCERS, there would be  an  increase  in  the  Unfunded
 Accrued Liability (UAL) of approximately $6.5 million and an increase in
 the  Present  Value of Future Employer Normal Cost of approximately $0.9
 million.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - RELATED TO  LOST  INVESTMENT  EARNINGS:  Currently,
 member  contributions  are  invested  with other NYCERS assets which are
 expected to earn 7.0% per annum.
  When an active member borrows member contributions  from  NYCERS,  the
 loan  is repaid with interest at 6.0% per annum prior to retirement. The
 difference in these rates would lead to smaller asset returns due to the
 decrease in assets attributable to the amount of loans outstanding.
  Assuming loan repayment within  one  year,  the  member  contributions
 borrowed  while  in  active service is expected to reduce overall NYCERS
 investment earnings by approximately $472 for every $100,000 borrowed.
  As of June 30, 2022, members eligible to borrow  member  contributions
 under  this  proposed  legislation  had  contribution  balances totaling
 approximately $70.3 million, $52.7 million of which  would  be  eligible
 for a loan.
  Based  on  the assumptions described below, the result of this differ-
 ence between the loan repayment rate of 6.0% and the expected investment
 earnings rate of 7.0% is a decrease in the Market Value of Assets (MVA),
 or asset loss, of approximately $0.1 million per year.
  FINANCIAL IMPACT - ANNUAL EMPLOYER  CONTRIBUTIONS:  The  enactment  of
 this  proposed legislation would result in an initial increase in annual
 employer contributions of  approximately  $4.0  million.  This  increase
 consists  of  an  increase  in  the  Normal  Cost in addition to the UAL
 payment.
  New UAL attributable to benefit changes are generally  amortized  over
 the remaining working lifetime of those impacted by the benefit changes.
 The  remaining  working  lifetime  for this group is approximately three
 years and the increase in UAL was therefore amortized over a  three-year
 period  (two  payments  under  the One-Year Lag Methodology) using level
 dollar payments.
  CENSUS DATA: The estimates presented herein are based  on  the  census
 data  to  be  used in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation of NYCERS to
 determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year 2024 employer contributions.
  The 591 Tier 3 CO-20 and CC-20 Plan members who participate in  NYCERS
 as  of  June  30,  2022  had an average age of approximately 52.0 years,
 average service of approximately 21.8 years, and an  average  salary  of
 approximately $144,800.
  ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS: The estimates presented herein have
 been  calculated  based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used to
 determine the Preliminary Fiscal Year  2024  employer  contributions  of
 NYCERS.
  For  the  purposes of this Fiscal Note, it is assumed that the changes
 would be reflected for the first time in the  June  30,  2022  actuarial
 A. 6750  4
 
 valuation  of NYCERS used to determine employer contributions for Fiscal
 Year 2024.
  It  has  been  further assumed that the yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury
 securities, on a long-term basis would equal 3.5% per year and that  50%
 of member balances available for borrowing would be taken as loans.
  RISK  AND  UNCERTAINTY: The costs presented in this Fiscal Note depend
 highly on the realization of the actuarial assumptions used,  demograph-
 ics  of  the  impacted population, and other factors such as investment,
 contribution, and other risks. If actual experience deviates from  actu-
 arial  assumptions,  the  actual costs could differ from those presented
 herein.
  Costs are also dependent on the actuarial methods used, and  therefore
 different actuarial methods could produce different results. Quantifying
 these risks is beyond the scope of this Fiscal Note.
  Not measured in this Fiscal Note are the following:
  *  The  initial  additional  administrative  costs  to  implement  the
 proposed legislation.
