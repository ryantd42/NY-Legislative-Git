  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Lower East Side History  Month  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  intent  of this Legislative Body to honor and
commemorate the proud and distinguished histories of  the  neighborhoods
which comprise the noble body of this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
recognize May 2023, as Lower East Side History Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Lower  East  Side  History Month emphasizes the diversity,
small businesses and artistic achievements of the  Lower  East  Side,  a
neighborhood  in  the  southeastern part of the New York City borough of
Manhattan which includes the East Village, Chinatown,  Two  Bridges  and
Loisaida; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Lower East Side of Manhattan is home to a vibrant and
diverse community of New Yorkers who represent different backgrounds and
cultures; and
 
  WHEREAS, Public housing was first  established  in  the  Lower  East
Side, pioneering the effort to provide affordable housing for low-income
New  Yorkers,  which can be seen in the Lower East Side Tenement Museum;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The Lower East Side  has  always  welcomed  immigrants  and
helped  set  them  on  a  path  to  becoming  independent and strong New
Yorkers; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals who identify as part of  the  LGBTQ+  community
have  historically  found  acceptance  in the Lower East Side in centers
such  as  the  Henry  Street  Settlement  at  a  time  when  they  faced
discrimination and bigotry in almost all other parts of the country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Lower  East Side is the traditional home to musicians
and artists and the birthplace of punk rock, contributing to the culture
of the neighborhood, of New York City, and of the country; and
 
  WHEREAS, Community gardens are a persistent  feature  of  the  Lower
East  Side, created while New York City was suffering from financial and
physical despair, and signify the preservation of community-owned public
spaces despite constant gentrification and displacement; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Lower East Side has a unique and rich history which  is
symbolic  of  the resiliency of New York City and of its residents; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Lower East
Side History Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
