 Introduced  by M. of A. PRETLOW -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Real Property Taxation
 
 AN ACT in relation  to  permitting  the  Immanuel  Evangelical  Lutheran
  Church to file an application for a real property tax exemption
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the asses-
 sor of the city of Mount Vernon is hereby authorized to accept from  the
 Immanuel  Evangelical  Lutheran Church an application for exemption from
 real property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real  property  tax
 law  for  the 2009 city assessment roll and the 2010-2011 school assess-
 ment roll, for the parcel located at 17 East Grand Street in the city of
 Mount Vernon. If accepted, the applications shall be reviewed as if they
 had been received on or before the taxable status date  established  for
 such  rolls.  If satisfied that the Immanuel Evangelical Lutheran Church
 (i) acquired title to the property for which it seeks exemption in March
 2009 and (ii) would otherwise be entitled  to  such  exemption  if  such
 corporation  filed  an  application  for  the exemption on or before the
 appropriate taxable status dates, the assessor,  upon  approval  by  the
 city  council of the city of Mount Vernon may grant exemption from taxa-
 tion on such assessment rolls and make the  appropriate  corrections  of
 the  subject  rolls.  If  exemptions  are  granted and such corporation,
 therefore, shall have paid any tax with respect to  the  subject  rolls,
 the  applicable  governing  body  or  tax  departments,  in  their  sole
 discretion, shall provide for the refund of the taxes  paid  and  cancel
 taxes remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
