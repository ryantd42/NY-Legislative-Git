  the workers' compensation law relating thereto
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The opening paragraph of section 11 of the workers' compen-
 sation law, as amended by section 8 of part SS of chapter 59 of the laws
 of 2017, is amended to read as follows:
  The liability of an employer prescribed by the last preceding  section
 shall  be  exclusive  and in place of any other liability whatsoever, to
 such employee, his or her  personal  representatives,  spouse,  parents,
 dependents,  distributees,  or  any person otherwise entitled to recover
 damages, contribution or indemnity,  at  common  law  or  otherwise,  on
 account  of  such injury or death or liability arising therefrom, except
 [that if an] IN THE FOLLOWING EVENTS: (I) THE EMPLOYER'S VIOLATION OF AN
 APPLICABLE STATUTE OR REGULATION INVOLVING WORKPLACE SAFETY WAS A PROXI-
 MATE CAUSE OF THE EMPLOYEE'S INJURY OR DEATH; (II) THE EMPLOYEE'S  BENE-
 FITS  HAVE  BEEN TERMINATED PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH W OF SUBDIVISION THREE
 OF SECTION FIFTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE;  OR  (III)  THE  employer  fails  to
 secure  the payment of compensation for his or her injured employees and
 their dependents as provided in section fifty of this article.  IN  SUCH
 EVENTS,  an injured employee, or his or her legal representative in case
 of death results from the injury, may, at his or her  option,  elect  to
 claim  compensation  under this chapter, or to maintain an action in the
 courts for damages on account of such injury[; and in such an action  it
 shall  not  be  necessary  to  plead  or prove freedom from contributory
 negligence nor may the defendant plead as a defense that the injury  was

 caused  by  the  negligence  of  a  fellow servant nor that the employee
 assumed the risk of his or her employment, nor that the injury  was  due
 to  the  contributory  negligence  of  the employee.] WHERE AN ACTION IS
 BROUGHT PURSUANT TO THE EMPLOYEE'S BENEFITS BEING TERMINATED PURSUANT TO
 PARAGRAPH W OF SUBDIVISION THREE OF SECTION FIFTEEN OF THIS ARTICLE, ANY
 APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS SHALL BE TOLLED FROM THE DATE OF INJU-
 RY  UNTIL  THE DATE THE EMPLOYEE'S BENEFITS ARE TERMINATED. THE EMPLOYER
 SHALL BE ENTITLED TO TAKE CREDIT FOR COMPENSATION PAID UNDER THIS  CHAP-
 TER  AGAINST  ANY DAMAGES AWARDED IN AN ACTION BROUGHT IN THE COURTS FOR
 DAMAGES. The liability under this chapter of The New York Jockey  Injury
 Compensation  Fund, Inc. created under section two hundred twenty-one of
 the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law shall  be  limited  to
 the  provision  of workers' compensation coverage to jockeys, apprentice
 jockeys, exercise persons, and at the election of the  New  York  Jockey
 Injury  Compensation Fund, Inc., with the approval of the New York state
 gaming commission, employees of licensed  trainers  or  owners  licensed
 under article two or four of the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breed-
 ing  law  and  any  statutory  penalties  resulting  from the failure to
 provide such coverage.
  § 2. Section 12 of the workers' compensation law is REPEALED.
  § 3. Subdivisions (a), (b) and (g)  of  section  13  of  the  workers'
 compensation law, subdivision (a) as amended by chapter 6 of the laws of
 2007,  the opening paragraph of subdivision (a) as amended by chapter 23
 of the laws of 2016, subdivision (b) as amended by chapter  113  of  the
 laws  of  1946 and subdivision (g) as separately amended by chapters 834
 and 922 of the laws of 1990, are amended to read as follows:
  (a) The employer shall promptly provide for an injured  employee  such
 medical,  dental, surgical, optometric or other attendance or treatment,
 nurse and hospital service,  medicine,  optometric  services,  crutches,
 eye-glasses,  false  teeth,  artificial  eyes,  orthotics,  prosthetic
 devices, functional assistive and adaptive  devices  and  apparatus  for
 such  period  as the nature of the injury or the process of recovery may
 require. The employer shall be liable for the payment of the expenses of
 medical, dental, surgical, optometric or other attendance or  treatment,
 nurse  and  hospital  service,  medicine, optometric services, crutches,
 eye-glasses,  false  teeth,  artificial  eyes,  orthotics,  prosthetic
 devices,  functional  assistive  and  adaptive devices and apparatus, as
 well as artificial members of the body or other  devices  or  appliances
 necessary in the first instance to replace, support or relieve a portion
 or  part of the body resulting from and necessitated by the injury of an
 employee, for such period as the nature of the injury or the process  of
 recovery may require, and the employer shall also be liable for replace-
 ments  or  repairs  of such artificial members of the body or such other
 devices, eye-glasses, false teeth, artificial eyes, orthotics, prosthet-
 ic devices, functional assistive  and  adaptive  devices  or  appliances
 necessitated by ordinary wear or loss or damage to a prosthesis, with or
 without bodily injury to the employee. Damage to or loss of a prosthetic
 device  shall  be  deemed  an  injury except that no disability benefits
 shall be payable with respect to such injury under  section  fifteen  of
 this  article. Such a replacement or repair of artificial members of the
 body or such other devices, eye-glasses, false teeth,  artificial  eyes,
 orthotics, prosthetic devices, functional assistive and adaptive devices
 or  appliances or the providing of medical treatment and care as defined
 herein shall not constitute the payment of  compensation  under  section
 twenty-five-a  of  this  article.  All  fees  and other charges for such
 treatment and services shall be limited to such charges  as  prevail  in
 A. 337  3
 
 the  same  community  for similar treatment of injured persons of a like
 standard of living.
  The  chair  shall [prepare and] establish a COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE THE
 schedule for the state, or schedules limited to defined  localities,  of
 charges  and fees for such medical treatment and care, and including all
 medical, dental, surgical, optometric or other attendance or  treatment,
 nurse  and  hospital  service,  medicine, optometric services, crutches,
 eye-glasses,  false  teeth,  artificial  eyes,  orthotics,  prosthetic
 devices,  functional  assistive  and  adaptive devices and apparatus [in
 accordance with and to be subject to change pursuant to rules promulgat-
 ed by the chair. Before preparing such schedule for the state or  sched-
 ules for limited localities the chair shall request]. THE MEMBERS OF THE
 COMMITTEE  SHALL BE the president of the medical society of the state of
 New York [and], the president of the New York state osteopathic  medical
 society  [to submit to him or her a report on], THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEW
 YORK STATE SOCIETY OF ORTHOPEDISTS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK  STATE
 AFL/CIO, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BUSINESS COUNCIL OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
 AN  INDIVIDUAL  DESIGNATED  BY THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, AN INDIVIDUAL
 DESIGNATED BY THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE CHAIR OF  THE  BOARD.
 THE  COMMITTEE  SHALL  MEET ANNUALLY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE the amount of
 remuneration deemed [by such society] to be fair and  adequate  for  the
 types  of  medical care to be rendered under this chapter, but consider-
 ation shall be given to the view of other  interested  parties.  In  the
 case  of  physical  therapy  fees  schedules the chair shall request the
 president of a recognized professional association representing physical
 therapists in the state of New York  to  submit  to  [him  or  her]  THE
 COMMITTEE  a report on the amount of remuneration deemed by such associ-
 ation to be fair  and  reasonable  for  the  type  of  physical  therapy
 services  rendered  under this chapter, but consideration shall be given
 to the views of other interested parties.  The chair shall also  prepare
 and  establish a schedule for the state, or schedules limited to defined
 localities, of charges and fees for  outpatient  hospital  services  not
 covered  under  the  medical fee schedule previously referred to in this
 subdivision, to be determined in accordance with and to  be  subject  to
 change pursuant to rules promulgated by the chair. Before preparing such
 schedule  for  the  state  or schedules for limited localities the chair
 shall request the president of the  hospital  association  of  New  York
 state  to submit to [him or her] THE COMMITTEE a report on the amount of
 remuneration deemed by such association to be fair and adequate for  the
 types of hospital outpatient care to be rendered under this chapter, but
 consideration  shall  be given to the views of other interested parties.
 In the case of occupational  therapy  fees  schedules  the  chair  shall
 request  the  president of a recognized professional association repres-
 enting occupational therapists in the state of New  York  to  submit  to
 [him or her] THE COMMITTEE a report on the amount of remuneration deemed
 by  such  association  to be fair and reasonable for the type of occupa-
 tional therapy services rendered under this chapter,  but  consideration
 shall  be  given  to  the views of other interested parties. The amounts
 payable by the employer for such treatment and  services  shall  be  the
 fees  and  charges established by such schedule.  Nothing in this sched-
 ule, however, shall prevent voluntary payment of amounts higher or lower
 than the fees and charges fixed  therein,  but  no  physician  rendering
 medical  treatment  or  care,  and no physical or occupational therapist
 rendering their respective physical or occupational therapy services may
 receive payment in any higher amount unless such  increased  amount  has
 been  authorized  by the employer, or by decision as provided in section
 A. 337  4
 
 thirteen-g of this article. Nothing in this section shall  be  construed
 as  preventing the employment of a duly authorized physician on a salary
 basis by an authorized compensation medical bureau or laboratory.
  (b)  In the case of persons, injured OR RESIDING AND RECEIVING MEDICAL
 TREATMENT outside of this state, but entitled to compensation  or  bene-
 fits  under  this  chapter, the provisions as to selection of authorized
 physicians AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE BOARD GOVERNING  MEDICAL
 TREATMENT  WITHIN  THE  STATE  shall  be inapplicable. In such cases the
 employer shall promptly provide all necessary medical treatment and care
 but if the employer fail to provide  the  same,  after  request  by  the
 injured  employee  such injured employee may do so at the expense of the
 employer. The employee shall not  be  entitled  to  recover  any  amount
 expended  by  him  for  such  treatment or services unless he shall have
 requested the employer to furnish the same and the employer  shall  have
 refused  or  neglected  to  do  so,  or  unless the nature of the injury
 required such treatment and services and the employer or his superinten-
 dent or foreman having knowledge of such injury shall have neglected  to
 provide  the same; nor shall any claim for medical or surgical treatment
 be valid and enforceable, as against such employer, unless within twenty
 days following the first treatment, the physician giving such treatment,
 furnish to the employer and the chairman a report  of  such  injury  and
 treatment, on a form prescribed by the chairman. The board may, however,
 by  the  unanimous vote of a panel of not less than three members quali-
 fied to act, excuse the failure to give such notice within  twenty  days
 when  it  finds  it  to be in the interest of justice to do so, and may,
 subject to the limitations contained in  section  twenty-eight  of  this
 [chapter]  ARTICLE,  make  an  award  for  the  reasonable value of such
 medical or surgical treatment. All  fees  and  other  charges  for  such
 treatment  and services, whether furnished by the employer or otherwise,
 shall be subject to regulation by the board as provided in section twen-
 ty-four of this [chapter] ARTICLE, and shall be limited to such  charges
 as  prevail  in  the  same  community  for  similar treatment of injured
 persons of a like standard of living.
  (g) Every hospital operating in the state shall, within twenty days of
 receiving a written request by a  claimant,  claimant's  representative,
 employer, carrier or special fund created under this chapter, provide to
 such  claimant,  claimant's representative, employer, carrier or special
 fund for use in board proceedings the medical records of an employee who
 has received treatment in such hospital and  who  is  claiming  benefits
 under  this  chapter. Each hospital shall designate at least one officer
 or employee who shall be responsible for provision of  such  records  on
 written  request, and to whom the board, claimant, claimant's, employer,
 carrier representative or special fund may  address  informal  inquiries
 regarding provision of such records.
  No  hospital  shall be required to produce the records of any claimant
 pursuant to this section without receiving  the  cost  of  copying  such
 records  as  determined  by  the  chair.  Such cost shall be paid by the
 requesting party except that the employer or  carrier  or  special  fund
 shall  reimburse  a claimant or claimant's representative the cost of an
 initial set of such records where the request is made by a  claimant  or
 claimant's  representative.  Should  the hospital not be able to provide
 the requested records within twenty days, they shall notify  in  writing
 the  party requesting the records of the reason why the records were not
 provided and the date on which they will be provided. Such date shall be
 within a reasonable period of time, but shall not  exceed  thirty  days.
 Failure to either provide the records within twenty days or to provide a
 A. 337  5
 
 reason why the records have not been provided shall subject the hospital
 to  a  fine  of  two hundred dollars which shall be imposed by the chair
 payable to the board upon finding that this  subdivision  has  not  been
 complied  with.  No hospital shall be required to produce the records of
 any claimant without receiving its customary fees or charges for reprod-
 uction of such records.  THE EMPLOYER OR CARRIER  SHALL  FILE  WITH  THE
 BOARD  ANY HOSPITAL OR MEDICAL RECORDS CONCERNING AN INJURED WORKER THAT
 COME INTO ITS POSSESSION AND HAVE NOT BEEN  PREVIOUSLY  FILED  WITH  THE
 BOARD.
  §  4.  Paragraphs  (d), (e) and the closing paragraph of subdivision 4
 and subdivision 5 of section 13-a  of  the  workers'  compensation  law,
 paragraphs  (d),  (e)  and  the  closing  paragraph  of subdivision 4 as
 amended by chapter 473 of the laws of 2000 and subdivision 5 as  amended
 by  section  8 of part CC of chapter 55 of the laws of 2019, are amended
 to read as follows:
  (d) The independent medical examiner ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  EMPLOYER  OR
 CARRIER  shall provide such reports and shall submit to investigation as
 required by the chair.
  (e) In order to qualify as admissible medical evidence,  for  purposes
 of  adjudicating  any  claim under this chapter, any report submitted to
 the board by an independent medical examiner ON BEHALF OF  THE  EMPLOYER
 OR  CARRIER  licensed by the state of New York shall include the follow-
 ing:
  (i) a signed statement certifying that the report is a full and truth-
 ful representation of the independent  medical  examiner's  professional
 opinion with respect to the claimant's condition[:];
  (ii) such examiner's board issued authorization number;
  (iii) the name of the individual or entity requesting the examination;
  (iv)  if  applicable,  the  registration number as required by section
 thirteen-n of this article; and
  (v) such other information as the chair may require by regulation.
  Any report by an independent medical examiner ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOY-
 ER OR CARRIER who is not authorized, and  who  performs  an  independent
 medical  examination  in  accordance with paragraph (c) of this subdivi-
 sion, which is to be used as medical evidence under this chapter,  shall
 include in the report such information as the chair may require by regu-
 lation.
  (5)  No  claim  for  specialist  consultations,  surgical  operations,
 physiotherapeutic or occupational therapy procedures, x-ray examinations
 or special diagnostic laboratory tests costing more  than  one  thousand
 dollars shall be valid and enforceable, as against such employer, unless
 such  special  services shall have been authorized by the employer or by
 the board, or unless such authorization has been unreasonably  withheld,
 or  withheld for a period of more than thirty calendar days from receipt
 of a request for authorization, or  unless  such  special  services  are
 required in an emergency, provided, however, that the basis for a denial
 of  such  authorization  by  the employer must be based on a conflicting
 second opinion rendered by a physician  authorized  by  the  board.  The
 board,  with  the  approval of the superintendent of financial services,
 shall issue and maintain a list of pre-authorized procedures under  this
 section,  WHICH  SHALL NOT BE USED TO DENY MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT VARIES
 FROM SUCH LIST OR WHICH OCCURS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE.  Such list of  pre-
 authorized  procedures shall be issued and maintained for the purpose of
 expediting authorization of treatment of injured workers. Such  list  of
 pre-authorized  procedures  shall not prohibit varied treatment when the
 A. 337  6
 
 treating provider demonstrates the appropriateness and medical necessity
 of such treatment.
  §  5.  Subdivision 1 of section 13-f of the workers' compensation law,
 as amended by chapter 353 of the laws of 1990, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (1)  Fees for medical services shall be payable only to a physician or
 other qualified person permitted  by  sections  thirteen-b,  thirteen-k,
 thirteen-l  and thirteen-m of this [chapter] ARTICLE or other authorized
 provider of health care under the education law or the public health law
 permitted to render medical care or treatment under this chapter, or  to
 the  agent, executor or administrator of the estate of such physician or
 such other qualified person.  Except as provided in  section  thirteen-d
 of  this [chapter] ARTICLE, no provider of health care rendering medical
 care or treatment to a compensation claimant, shall collect or receive a
 fee from such claimant within this state, but shall  have  recourse  for
 payment  of  services rendered only to the employer under the provisions
 of this chapter.  WHERE AN ISSUE ARISES  REGARDING  A  MEDICAL  FEE,  A
 PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHTS PROVIDED BY SECTIONS TWEN-
 TY  AND TWENTY-THREE OF THIS ARTICLE. Any compensation claimant who pays
 a fee to a provider of health care for medical care or  treatment  under
 this  chapter  shall  have  a  cause  of action against such provider of
 health care for the recovery of the money paid, which  cause  of  action
 may  be  assigned  to the chair in trust for the assigning claimant. All
 such assignments shall run to the chair. The chair may  sue  the  physi-
 cian, or other authorized provider of health care as herein described on
 the  assigned  cause  of  action  with  the  benefits and subject to the
 provisions of existing law applying to  such  actions  by  the  claimant
 himself  or  herself.  Hospitals  shall  not  be entitled to receive the
 remuneration paid to physicians on their staff for medical and  surgical
 services.
  §  6.  Subdivisions  1,  2, paragraphs s, t, v and w of subdivision 3,

 added to read as follows:
  1. Permanent total disability. In case of total disability adjudged to
 be  permanent  sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly
 wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance of such total
 disability. Loss of both hands, or both arms,  or  both  feet,  or  both
 legs,  or  both eyes, or of any two thereof, OR INABILITY TO PERFORM THE
 FULL RANGE OF SEDENTARY WORK, OR APPROVAL FOR  FEDERAL  SOCIAL  SECURITY
 DISABILITY  BENEFITS  AS A RESULT OF THE COMPENSABLE ACCIDENT OR OCCUPA-
 TIONAL DISEASE shall, in the absence of conclusive proof to the  contra-
 ry, constitute permanent total disability.  In all other cases permanent
 total  disability  shall  be  determined  in  accordance with the facts.
 A. 337  7
 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an injured employee
 disabled due to the loss or total loss of use  of  both  eyes,  or  both
 hands,  or  both arms, or both feet, or both legs, or of any two thereof
 shall not suffer any diminution of his compensation by engaging in busi-
 ness  or  employment  provided his earnings or wages, when combined with
 his compensation, shall not be in excess of the wage base on  which  the
 maximum  weekly compensation benefit is computed under the law in effect
 at time of such earning;  further  provided,  that  if  the  combination
 exceeds  such  wage  base,  the  compensation  shall be diminished to an
 amount which, together with his earnings or wages, shall equal the  wage
 base;  and  further  provided  that  the application of this subdivision
 shall not result in reduction of compensation which an injured  employee
 who  is  disabled  due to the loss or total loss of use of both eyes, or
 both hands, or both arms, or both feet, or both legs or of any two ther-
 eof, would otherwise be entitled to under any other  provision  of  this
 section.
  2.  Temporary total disability. In case of temporary total disability,
 WHICH SHALL CONSIST OF THE INJURED EMPLOYEE'S INABILITY TO  PERFORM  HIS
 OR  HER  AT-INJURY  EMPLOYMENT OR ANY MODIFIED EMPLOYMENT OFFERED BY THE
 EMPLOYER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE  EMPLOYEE'S  DISABILITY,  sixty-six
 and  two-thirds  per centum of the average weekly wages shall be paid to
 the  employee  during  the  continuance  thereof,  except  as  otherwise
 provided in this chapter.
  s.  Partial  loss  or  partial loss of use. Compensation for permanent
 partial loss or loss of use of a member [may] SHALL be for proportionate
 loss or loss of use of the member. Compensation  for  permanent  partial
 loss  or  loss  of use of an eye shall be awarded on the basis of uncor-
 rected loss of vision or corrected loss  of  vision  resulting  from  an
 injury whichever is the greater.
  t.  Disfigurement. 1. The board may award proper and equitable compen-
 sation for serious facial or head disfigurement, not to exceed  [twenty]
 THIRTY  thousand dollars, including a disfigurement continuous in length
 which is partially in the facial area and also  extends  into  the  neck
 region  as  described  in  [paragraph] SUBPARAGRAPH two [hereof] OF THIS
 PARAGRAPH.
  2. The board, if in its opinion the earning capacity  of  an  employee
 has  been  or  may in the future be impaired, may award compensation for
 any serious disfigurement in the  region  above  the  sterno  clavicular
 articulations  anterior to and including the region of the sterno cleido
 mastoid muscles on either side, but no award under subdivisions one  and
 two  OF  THIS  SECTION  shall,  in the aggregate, exceed [twenty] THIRTY
 thousand dollars.
  3. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,  two  or  more  serious
 disfigurements,  not continuous in length, resulting from the same inju-
 ry, if partially in the facial area and partially in the neck region  as
 described  in  [paragraph]  SUBPARAGRAPH two [hereof] OF THIS PARAGRAPH,
 shall be deemed to be a facial disfigurement.
  v. Additional compensation for impairment of wage earning capacity  in
 certain  permanent  partial  disabilities.  Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision of this subdivision, additional compensation shall be  payable
 for  impairment of wage earning capacity for any period after the termi-
 nation of an award under paragraphs a, b, c, or d, of  this  subdivision
 for  the  loss  or  loss of use of [fifty] FORTY per centum or more of a
 member, provided such impairment of earning capacity shall be due solely
 thereto. Such additional compensation shall be determined in  accordance
 with paragraph w of this subdivision, BUT SHALL NOT CEASE UNTIL THE DATE
 A. 337  8
 
 THE  DISABLED EMPLOYEE RECEIVES OR IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE OLD-AGE INSUR-
 ANCE BENEFITS UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT. The additional compensation
 shall be reduced by fifty per centum of any amount of  disability  bene-
 fits which the disabled employee is receiving or entitled to receive for
 the  same  period under the social security act, [and shall cease on the
 date the disabled employee receives or is entitled  to  receive  old-age
 insurance  benefits under the social security act]. As soon as practica-
 ble after the injury, the worker shall be required to participate  in  a
 board  approved rehabilitation program; or shall have demonstrated coop-
 eration with efforts to institute such  a  board  approved  program  and
 shall  have  been determined by the board not to be a feasible candidate
 for rehabilitation; such rehabilitation shall constitute  treatment  and
 care as provided in this chapter.
  w.  Other  cases.  In all other cases of permanent partial disability,
 the compensation shall  be  sixty-six  and  two-thirds  percent  of  the
 difference  between  the injured employee's average weekly wages and his
 or her wage-earning capacity thereafter in the same employment or other-
 wise.  NOTHING IN THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL PRECLUDE THE PAYMENT  OF  COMPEN-
 SATION  UNDER  PARAGRAPHS  A THROUGH T OF THIS SUBDIVISION, HOWEVER, THE
 EMPLOYER OR CARRIER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO TAKE CREDIT FOR ANY PAYMENT  OF
 COMPENSATION  UNDER  SUCH  PARAGRAPHS  A  THROUGH T AGAINST A PAYMENT OF
 COMPENSATION UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH.  Compensation  under  this  paragraph
 shall  be payable during the continuance of such permanent partial disa-
 bility, without the necessity for the claimant who is entitled to  bene-
 fits  at the time of classification to demonstrate ongoing attachment to
 the labor market, but subject to reconsideration of the degree  of  such
 impairment  by  the  board  on its own motion or upon application of any
 party in interest however, all compensation payable under this paragraph
 shall not exceed (i) five hundred twenty-five weeks in  cases  in  which
 the  loss  of wage-earning capacity is greater than ninety-five percent;
 (ii) five hundred weeks in cases  in  which  the  loss  of  wage-earning
 capacity  is  greater  than ninety percent but not more than ninety-five
 percent; (iii) four hundred seventy-five weeks in  cases  in  which  the
 loss  of  wage-earning  capacity is greater than eighty-five percent but
 not more than ninety percent; (iv) four hundred fifty weeks in cases  in
 which  the  loss of wage-earning capacity is greater than eighty percent
 but not more than eighty-five  percent;  (v)  four  hundred  twenty-five
 weeks  in  cases  in  which the loss of wage-earning capacity is greater
 than seventy-five percent but not more than eighty  percent;  (vi)  four
 hundred  weeks  in  cases  in which the loss of wage-earning capacity is
 greater than seventy percent but not  more  than  seventy-five  percent;
 (vii)  three  hundred  seventy-five  weeks in cases in which the loss of
 wage-earning capacity is greater than sixty percent but  not  more  than
 seventy  percent; (viii) three hundred fifty weeks in cases in which the
 loss of wage-earning capacity is greater than fifty percent but not more
 than sixty percent; (ix) three hundred weeks in cases in which the  loss
 of wage-earning capacity is greater than forty percent but not more than
 fifty  percent; (x) two hundred seventy-five weeks in cases in which the
 loss of wage-earning capacity is greater than  thirty  percent  but  not
 more  than forty percent; (xi) two hundred fifty weeks in cases in which
 the loss of wage-earning capacity is greater than  fifteen  percent  but
 not more than thirty percent; and (xii) two hundred twenty-five weeks in
 cases  in  which the loss of wage-earning capacity is fifteen percent or
 less. For a claimant with a date of accident or  disablement  after  the
 effective  date of [the] SECTION ONE OF SUBPART A OF PART NNN OF chapter
 59 of the laws of two thousand seventeen  [that  amended  this  subdivi-
 A. 337  9

 sion],  where the carrier or employer has provided compensation pursuant
 to subdivision five of this section beyond one hundred thirty weeks from
 the date of accident or  disablement,  all  subsequent  weeks  in  which
 compensation  was  paid  shall  be  considered  to  be benefit weeks for
 purposes of this section, with the carrier or employer receiving  credit
 for  all  such  subsequent  weeks  against the amount of maximum benefit
 weeks when permanent partial disability under  this  section  is  deter-
 mined.  In the event of payment for intermittent temporary partial disa-
 bility paid after one hundred thirty weeks from the date of accident  or
 disablement,  such time shall be reduced to a number of weeks, for which
 the carrier will receive a credit against the maximum benefit weeks. For
 a claimant with a date of accident or disablement  after  the  effective
 date  of [the] SECTION ONE OF SUBPART A OF PART NNN OF chapter 59 of the
 laws of two thousand seventeen [that  amended  this  subdivision],  when
 permanency  is  at  issue, and a claimant has submitted medical evidence
 that he or she is not at maximum medical improvement,  and  the  carrier
 has produced or has had a reasonable opportunity to produce an independ-
 ent  medical examination concerning maximum medical improvement, and the
 board has determined that the claimant is not  yet  at  maximum  medical
 improvement,  the  carrier  shall not receive a credit for benefit weeks
 prior to a  finding  that  the  claimant  has  reached  maximum  medical
 improvement,  at  which  time  the  carrier shall receive credit for any
 weeks of temporary  disability  paid  to  claimant  after  such  finding
 against  the  maximum  benefit weeks awarded under this subdivision. For
 those claimants classified as  permanently  partially  disabled  who  no
 longer  receive  indemnity  payments  because  they have surpassed their
 number of maximum benefit weeks, the following provisions will apply:
  (1) There will be a presumption that medical services  shall  continue
 notwithstanding  the  completion of the time period for compensation set
 forth in this section and the burden of going forward and the burden  of
 proof  will  lie with the carrier, self-insured employer or state insur-
 ance fund in any application before the board to discontinue or  suspend
 such services. Medical services will continue during the pendency of any
 such application and any appeals thereto.
  (2)  The board is directed to promulgate regulations that establish an
 independent review and appeal by an  outside  agent  or  entity  of  the
 board's  choosing  of  any  administrative  law judge's determination to
 discontinue or suspend medical services before a final determination  of
 the board.
  4. Effect of award. An award made to a claimant under ANY PARAGRAPH OF
 subdivision  three  OF  THIS SECTION shall in case of death arising from
 causes other than the injury be payable to and for the  benefit  of  the
 persons following:
  a.  If  there be a surviving spouse and no child of the deceased under
 the age of eighteen years, to such spouse.
  b. If there be a surviving spouse and surviving child or  children  of
 the  deceased under the age of eighteen years, one-half shall be payable
 to the surviving spouse and the other half to  the  surviving  child  or
 children.
  The  board may in its discretion require the appointment of a guardian
 for the purpose of receiving the compensation of the minor child. In the
 absence of such a requirement by the board the appointment  for  such  a
 purpose shall not be necessary.
  c. If there be a surviving child or children of the deceased under the
 age  of  eighteen  years,  but no surviving spouse then to such child or
 children.
 A. 337  10
 
  d. If there be no surviving spouse and no surviving child or  children
 of  the deceased under the age of eighteen years, then to such dependent
 or dependents as defined in section sixteen of this  [chapter]  ARTICLE,
 as  directed  by  the board; and if there be no such dependents, then to
 the  estate  of  such  deceased  [in  an amount not exceeding reasonable
 funeral expenses] as provided in subdivision one of section  sixteen  of
 this  [chapter]  ARTICLE,  or,  if  there be no estate, to the person or
 persons paying the funeral expenses of such deceased in  an  amount  not
 exceeding  reasonable funeral expenses as provided in subdivision one of
 section sixteen of this [chapter] ARTICLE.
  An award for disability may be made after the  death  of  the  injured
 employee.
  4-a.  Protracted  temporary total disability in connection with perma-
 nent partial disability. In  case  of  temporary  total  disability  and
 permanent partial disability both resulting from the same injury, if the
 temporary total disability continues for a longer period than the number
 of  weeks  set  forth in the following schedule, the period of temporary
 total disability in excess of such number of weeks shall be added to the
 compensation period provided in subdivision three of this section:  Arm,
 [thirty-two]  SIXTEEN  weeks;  leg, [forty] TWENTY weeks; hand, [thirty-
 two] SIXTEEN weeks; foot, [thirty-two] SIXTEEN weeks; ear, [twenty-five]
 TWELVE weeks; eye,  [twenty]  TEN  weeks;  thumb,  [twenty-four]  TWELVE
 weeks;  first  finger,  [eighteen]  NINE  weeks; great toe, [twelve] SIX
 weeks; second finger, [twelve] SIX weeks;  third  finger,  [eight]  FOUR
 weeks;  fourth  finger,  [eight]  FOUR  weeks; toe other than great toe,
 [eight] FOUR weeks.
  In any case resulting in loss or partial loss  of  use  of  arm,  leg,
 hand,  foot,  ear,  eye, thumb, finger or toe, where the temporary total
 disability does not extend beyond the periods above mentioned  for  such
 injury,  compensation  shall  be  limited  to  the schedule contained in
 subdivision three.
  5. Temporary partial disability. In case of temporary partial disabil-
 ity resulting in decrease of earning capacity, the compensation shall be
 two-thirds of the difference  between  the  injured  employee's  average
 weekly wages before the accident and his wage earning capacity after the
 accident  in the same or other employment, WHICH DIFFERENCE SHALL BE THE
 INJURED EMPLOYEE'S LOSS OF  WAGE-EARNING  CAPACITY.  COMPENSATION  UNDER
 THIS  SUBDIVISION SHALL BE PAYABLE DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF SUCH TEMPO-
 RARY PARTIAL DISABILITY, WITHOUT  THE  NECESSITY  FOR  THE  CLAIMANT  TO
 DEMONSTRATE  ONGOING  ATTACHMENT  TO  THE LABOR MARKET, UNLESS THE BOARD
 FINDS THAT THE INJURED EMPLOYEE'S LOSS OF WAGES IS WHOLLY  UNRELATED  TO
 HIS OR HER PARTIAL DISABILITY.

 hundred fifty dollars per week; (2) on or  after  July  first,  nineteen

 and thirty-five per centum of such wages to such child under the age  of
 eighteen  years,  or under the age of twenty-three years if enrolled and
 attending as a full-time student in an accredited  educational  institu-
 tion  and  such enrollment and full-time attendance is certified by such
 institution, or a surviving child of any age dependent  blind  or  phys-
 ically  disabled;  in the case of the subsequent death of such surviving
 spouse the surviving child shall have his or her compensation  increased
 to  seventy-five  per centum of such wages and the same shall be payable
 so long as he or she is under the age of eighteen years,  or  under  the
 age  of  twenty-three  years  if  enrolled  and attending as a full-time
 student in an accredited educational institution and such enrollment and
 full-time attendance is certified by such institution,  or  a  surviving
 child  of any age dependent blind or physically disabled; upon statutory
 termination of compensation payable to such child, the  compensation  of
 the  surviving  spouse  shall be increased to seventy-five per centum of
 such wages [with two years' compensation, at such rate, in one sum, upon
 remarriage]. [Upon remarriage of such surviving  spouse,  the  surviving
 child  shall  continue  to receive thirty-five per centum of such wages.
 Where such death occurs, and the spouse is receiving survivors insurance
 benefits under the social security act, the death benefit payable  under
 this  section  shall be reduced by five per centum of the spouse's share
 of the survivors insurance benefits under the social  security  act  for
 each  ten  dollars  of  deceased's  average weekly wage in excess of one
 hundred dollars; provided that in no case shall  such  reduction  exceed
 fifty per centum of such spouse's share of the survivors insurance bene-
 fits under the social security act as set forth in table No. I in subdi-
 vision  one-c  of  this  section.]  If there be a surviving spouse of an
 employee of a private voluntary hospital killed in a World Trade  Center
 rescue,  who  passed  a physical examination upon employment as a rescue
 worker that failed to reveal evidence of a condition that was the proxi-
 mate cause of death, and two or more surviving children under the age of
 eighteen years, or under the age of twenty-three years if  enrolled  and
 attending  as  a full-time student in an accredited educational institu-
 tion and such enrollment and full-time attendance is certified  by  such

 or  physically  disabled  and a death occurs on or after September elev-
 enth, two thousand one, to such spouse forty per centum of  the  average
 wage  of  the  deceased during widowhood or widowerhood [with two years'
 compensation in one sum upon remarriage]; and thirty-five per centum  of
 such  wages  to  such children under the age of eighteen years, or under
 the age of twenty-three years if enrolled and attending as  a  full-time
 student in an accredited educational institution and such enrollment and
 full-time  attendance  is  certified by such institution, or a surviving
 A. 337  18
 
 child or children of any age dependent  blind  or  physically  disabled,
 share and share alike; in case of the subsequent death of such surviving
 spouse the surviving children shall have their compensation increased to
 seventy-five  per  centum  of  such wages and the aggregate sum shall be
 payable, share and share alike, so long as they are  under  the  age  of
 eighteen  years,  or under the age of twenty-three years if enrolled and
 attending as a full-time student in an accredited  educational  institu-
 tion  and  such enrollment and full-time attendance is certified by such
 institution, or a surviving child or children of any age dependent blind
 or physically disabled. [Upon remarriage of such  surviving  spouse,  if
 there  be  two  surviving  children  each shall receive thirty-seven and
 one-half per centum of such wages, and if there are surviving more  than
 two  children under the age of eighteen years, or under the age of twen-
 ty-three if enrolled and attending as a full-time student in an  accred-
 ited  educational  institution and such enrollment and full-time attend-
 ance is certified by such institution, or a surviving child or  children
 of  any  age  dependant  blind  or physically disabled, seventy-five per
 centum of such wages share and share alike.] Upon statutory  termination
 of  compensation  payable  to  such  children,  the  compensation of the
 surviving spouse shall be increased to seventy-five per centum  of  such
 wages  [with  two  years'  compensation,  at such rate, in one sum, upon
 remarriage]. Where the death occurs on or after September eleventh,  two
 thousand  one,  and the spouse is receiving survivors insurance benefits
 under the social security act, the death  benefits  payable  under  this
 section shall be reduced by five per centum of the spouse's share of the
 survivors  insurance benefits under the social security act for each ten
 dollars of deceased's average weekly wage in excess of one hundred fifty
 dollars; provided that in no case shall such reduction exceed fifty  per
 centum  of said spouse's share of the survivors insurance benefits under
 the social security act as set forth in  table  No.  II  in  subdivision
 two-a of this section.

  § 17-B. LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. 1. THE BOARD SHALL PROVIDE TRANS-
 LATION OF ALL DOCUMENTS AND FORMS USED BY OR ISSUED TO  INJURED  EMPLOY-

  §  9. Section 18 of the workers' compensation law, as amended by chap-
 ter 747 of the laws of 1947, is amended to read as follows:
  § 18. Notice of injury or death. Notice of  an  injury  or  death  for
 which  compensation  is payable under this chapter shall be given to the
 employer within thirty days after the accident causing such injury,  and
 also  in  case  of the death of the employee resulting from such injury,
 within thirty days after such death. Such notice may  be  given  by  any
 person  claiming  to  be entitled to compensation, or by some one in his
 behalf. The notice shall be in writing, and contain the name and address
 of the employee, and state in ordinary language the time, place,  nature
 and  cause  of  the  injury,  and be signed by him or by a person on his
 behalf or, in case of death, by any one or more of his dependents, or by
 a person, on their behalf. It shall be given to the employer by deliver-
 ing it to him or sending it by mail, by registered letter, addressed  to
 the  employer at his or its last known place of business; provided that,
 if the employer be a partnership then such notice may be so given to any
 one of the partners, and if the employer be  a  corporation,  then  such
 notice  may  be  given  to  any agent or officer thereof upon whom legal
 process may be served, or any agent in charge of  his  business  in  the
 place where the injury occurred. The failure to give notice of injury or
 notice  of  death  unless excused by the board either on the ground that
 notice for some sufficient reason could not have been given, or  on  the
 ground that the employer, or his or its agents in charge of the business
 in the place where the accident occurred or having immediate supervision
 of  the  employee  to  whom  the accident happened, had knowledge of the
 accident or death, or on the ground that the employer has not been prej-
 udiced thereby, shall be a bar to any claim under this chapter, but  the
 employer  and  the insurance carrier shall be deemed to have waived such
 notice unless the objection to the failure to give such  notice  or  the
 insufficiency  thereof,  is raised before the board on the first hearing
 of the claim field by such injured employee, or his or her dependents at
 which all parties in interest are present, or represented, and at  which
 the  claimant,  or principal beneficiary, testifies. THE BURDEN OF PROOF
 ON THE ISSUE OF PREJUDICE SHALL REST WITH THE EMPLOYER.
  § 10. Subdivision 1 of section 20 of the workers' compensation law, as
 amended by chapter 635 of the laws  of  1996,  is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  1.  At any time after [the expiration of the first seven days of disa-
 bility  on  the  part of] an INJURY THE injured employee, or at any time
 A. 337  21
 
 after the employee's death, a claim for compensation may be presented to
 the employer or to the chair.  The board shall HOLD AN  INITIAL  HEARING
 IN  EACH  CLAIM AND SHALL have full power and authority to determine all
 questions  in  relation  to  the  payment  of claims presented to it for
 compensation under the provisions of this chapter.  The chair  or  board
 shall make or cause to be made such investigation as it deems necessary,
 and  upon application of either party, shall order a hearing, and within
 thirty days after a claim  for  compensation  is  submitted  under  this
 section,  or such hearing closed, shall make or deny an award, determin-
 ing such claim for compensation, and file the same in the office of  the
 chair. Immediately after such filing the chair shall send to the parties
 a  copy of the decision.  Upon a hearing pursuant to this section either
 party may present evidence and be represented by counsel.  The  decision
 of  the board shall be final as to all questions of fact, and, except as
 provided in section twenty-three of this article, as to all questions of
 law.  Except as provided in section twenty-seven of  this  article,  all
 awards  of  the  board shall draw simple interest from thirty days after
 the making thereof at the rate provided in section five thousand four of
 the civil practice law and rules.  Whenever a hearing or proceeding  for
 the determination of a claim for compensation is begun before a referee,
 pursuant  to  the provisions of this chapter, such hearing or proceeding
 or any adjourned hearing thereon shall continue before the same  referee
 until  a final determination awarding or denying compensation, except in
 the absence, inability or disqualification to act of  such  referee,  or
 for  other  good cause, in which event such hearing or proceeding may be
 continued before another referee by order of the chair or board.
  § 11. Section 24 of the workers' compensation law, as amended by chap-
 ter 27 of the laws of 2022, is amended by adding a new subdivision 5  to
 read as follows:
  5.  WHERE  THE  CLAIM IS SOLELY FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND NO AWARD OF
 COMPENSATION IS MADE, ATTORNEYS AND COUNSELORS-AT-LAW MAY SUBMIT A CLAIM
 FOR LEGAL SERVICES RENDERED IN CONNECTION WITH  OBTAINING  AUTHORIZATION
 OR  APPROVAL  FOR  SUCH  MEDICAL  TREATMENT,  INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF
 ADVICE AND REPRESENTATION FOR THE INJURED WORKER. THE BOARD SHALL REVIEW
 AND APPROVE SUCH CLAIMS, HAVING DUE REGARD FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED AND
 WHETHER AUTHORIZATION OR APPROVAL WAS OBTAINED. THE FEES AWARDED  TO  AN
 ATTORNEY  PURSUANT  TO THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE PAID BY THE EMPLOYER OR
 CARRIER. ANY ATTORNEY FEE AWARDED PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SUBDIVISION  SHALL
 BECOME  A CREDIT AGAINST A SUBSEQUENT ATTORNEY FEE REQUESTED PURSUANT TO
 SUBDIVISION (B) OF THIS SECTION.
  § 12. Subdivision 2-b of section 25 of the workers'  compensation  law
 is REPEALED and subdivision 2-c is renumbered subdivision 2-b.
  §  13.  Paragraphs  (b)  and (c) of subdivision 3 of section 25 of the
 workers' compensation law, as amended by chapter 61 of the laws of 1986,
 are amended to read as follows:
  (b) Nothing herein shall limit the right of the board in a  particular
 case  to  hold  a  hearing  and  make  an award in accordance with other
 provisions of this chapter. No case shall  be  closed  AND  NO  DECISION
 SHALL  BE ISSUED without A HEARING UPON notice to all parties interested
 and without giving to all such parties an opportunity to be heard.
  (c) The board shall keep an accurate STENOGRAPHIC record of all  hear-
 ings  held.  Whenever a hearing must be continued or adjourned because
 the carrier or employer has engaged in  dilatory  tactics  or  exhibited
 unjustified  lack  of  preparedness, the board shall impose a penalty of
 twenty-five dollars to be paid to the fund created by subdivision two of
 section one hundred fifty-one of this chapter and shall in addition make
 A. 337  22

 an award of seventy-five dollars payable to the injured worker or his or
 her dependants. Dilatory tactics may include but shall  not  be  limited
 to:  failing to subpoena medical witnesses or to secure an order to show
 cause as directed by the referee, failing to bring proper files, failing
 to  appear,  failing  to  produce witnesses or documents after they have
 been requested by the referee or examiner or as directed by the  hearing
 notice,  unnecessarily protracting the production of evidence, or engag-
 ing in a pattern of delay which unduly delays resolution, except that no
 penalty shall be imposed nor award made under this  subdivision  if  the
 carrier  or  employer produces evidence sufficient to excuse its conduct
 to the satisfaction of the referee.
  § 14. Subdivision 1, the fifth undesignated paragraph of subdivision 5
 and subdivision 6 of section 29 of the workers' compensation law, subdi-
 vision 1 as amended by chapter 805 of the laws of 1984  and  as  further
 amended  by section 104 of part A of chapter 62 of the laws of 2011, the
 fifth undesignated paragraph of subdivision 5 as amended by chapter  246
 of  the laws of 1967, and subdivision 6 as amended by chapter 635 of the
 laws of 1996, are amended to read as follows:
  1. If an employee entitled  to  compensation  under  this  chapter  be
 injured  or killed by the negligence or wrong of another not in the same
 employ, such injured employee, or in case of death, his dependents, need
 not elect whether to take compensation and medical benefits  under  this
 chapter  or  to  pursue  his remedy against such other but may take such
 compensation and medical benefits and at any time either  prior  thereto
 or  within  six months after the awarding of compensation or within nine
 months after the enactment of a law or laws  creating,  establishing  or
 affording  a  new  or  additional  remedy or remedies, pursue his remedy
 against such other subject to the provisions of this  chapter.  If  such
 injured employee, or in case of death, his dependents, take or intend to
 take  compensation,  and  medical  benefits  in the case of an employee,
 under this chapter and desire to bring action against such  other,  such
 action must be commenced not later than six months after the awarding of
 compensation  or  not later than nine months after the enactment of such
 law or laws creating, establishing or  affording  a  new  or  additional
 remedy  or  remedies  and in any event before the expiration of one year
 from the date such action accrues. In such  case,  the  state  insurance
 fund,  if  compensation  be payable therefrom, and otherwise the person,
 association, corporation or insurance carrier liable for the payment  of
 such compensation, as the case may be, shall have a lien on the proceeds
 of  any recovery from such other TO THE EXTENT SUCH RECOVERY IS FOR LOST
 WAGES OR MEDICAL EXPENSES, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise,
 after the  deduction  of  the  reasonable  and  necessary  expenditures,
 including  attorney's  fees, incurred in effecting such recovery, to the
 extent of the total amount of compensation awarded under or provided  or
 estimated  by  this  chapter  for such case and the expenses for medical
 treatment paid or to be paid by it and  to  such  extent  such  recovery
 shall  be  deemed  for  the  benefit  of such fund, person, association,
 corporation or carrier. Should the employee or his dependents  secure  a
 recovery  from such other, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise,
 such employee or dependents may apply on notice to such  lienor  to  the
 court  in  which the third party action was instituted, or to a court of
 competent jurisdiction if no action was instituted, for an order  appor-
 tioning  the reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys'
 fees, incurred in effecting such recovery. Such  expenditures  shall  be
 equitably  apportioned  by  the court between the employee or his depen-
 dents and the lienor. Notice of the commencement of such action shall be
 A. 337  23
 
 given within thirty days thereafter to the chairman,  the  employer  and
 the insurance carrier upon a form prescribed by the chairman. Any of the
 foregoing  providers  of  compensation and/or medical benefits which has
 recovered  a lien pursuant to the provisions hereof against the recovery
 of a person injured on or after February first, nineteen hundred  seven-
 ty-four  and  before July first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, through
 the use or operation of a motor vehicle in this state, shall notify such
 person by certified mail in a manner to be approved by the chairman  and
 the  superintendent  of  financial  services of the responsibility of an
 "insurer" (as defined in subsection (g) of  section  five  thousand  one
 hundred  two  of the insurance law), to reimburse such person under such
 circumstances to the extent that  the  recovered  lien  represent  first
 party benefits as defined in article fifty-one of the insurance law.
  A  copy  of the papers to be used on the application to compromise and
 settle the claim must be served as directed by the court or in the  same
 manner  as  provided in the civil practice law and rules for a notice of
 motion upon the commissioners of the state insurance fund or such  offi-
 cer  thereof  designated by them or upon the person, association, corpo-
 ration, or insurance carrier, whose written  approval  would  have  been
 required  to  compromise  such  cause  of  action by the employee or his
 dependents. This notice shall afford  them  the  opportunity  to  submit
 affidavits  and  to be heard by the court on the application. A PETITION
 MAY ALSO BE FILED PURSUANT TO THIS SUBDIVISION ALLOCATING A  PORTION  OF
 THE THIRD-PARTY RECOVERY TO LOST WAGES AND/OR MEDICAL TREATMENT.
  6.  [The]  EXCEPT  AS SET FORTH IN SECTION ELEVEN OF THIS ARTICLE, THE
 right to compensation or benefits  under  this  chapter,  shall  be  the
 exclusive  remedy  to an employee, or in case of death his or her depen-
 dents, when such employee is injured or  killed  by  the  negligence  or
 wrong  of  another  in  the  same  employ, the employer's insurer or any
 collective bargaining agent of the employer's employees or any employee,
 of such insurer or such collective bargaining agent (while acting within
 the scope of his or her employment). The limitation of liability  of  an
 employer  set  forth in section eleven of this article for the injury or
 death of an employee shall be applicable to another in the same  employ,
 the  employer's  insurer, any collective bargaining agent of the employ-
 er's employees or any employee of the employer's insurer or such collec-
 tive bargaining agent (while acting within  the  scope  of  his  or  her
 employment).  The option to maintain an action in the courts for damages
 [based on the employer's failure  to  secure  compensation  for  injured
 employees  and  their  dependents as set forth in section eleven of this
 article] shall not be construed to include  the  right  to  maintain  an
 action against another in the same employ, [the employer's insurer,] any
 collective  bargaining agent of the employer's employees or any employee
 [of the employer's insurer] or such collective bargaining  agent  (while
 acting within the scope of his or her employment).
  § 15. Subdivision 3 of section 35 of the workers' compensation law, as
 amended  by section 2 of subpart A of part NNN of chapter 59 of the laws
 of 2017, is amended and a new subdivision 5 is added to read as follows:
  3. Extreme hardship redetermination. In cases where the loss of  wage-
 earning  capacity is greater than [seventy-five] FIFTY percent, a claim-
 ant may request[, within the year prior to the scheduled  exhaustion  of
 indemnity  benefits  under  paragraph  w of subdivision three of section
 fifteen of this article], that the  board  reclassify  the  claimant  to
 permanent total disability or total industrial disability due to factors
 reflecting  extreme  hardship.  EXTREME HARDSHIP IS DEFINED AS:  (A) THE
 INJURED WORKER'S INCOME FROM SOCIAL  SECURITY  DISABILITY  BENEFITS  AND
 A. 337  24
 
 DISABILITY  PENSION  (IF APPLICABLE) WOULD BE LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF
 HIS OR HER AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE UPON TERMINATION OF PPD BENEFITS; OR  (B)
 THE  INJURED  WORKER  WILL  BE  UNABLE  TO  MEET EXPENSES FOR HIMSELF OR
 HERSELF  AND  ANY  DEPENDENTS  UPON  TERMINATION OF PPD BENEFITS; OR (C)
 ADDITIONAL MEDICAL, FUNCTIONAL OR VOCATIONAL FACTORS ARISING  SUBSEQUENT
 TO  THE  CLASSIFICATION  OF  PERMANENT  PARTIAL  DISABILITY HAVE FURTHER
 ERODED THE INJURED WORKER'S WAGE EARNING CAPACITY; OR  (D)  THE  INJURED
 WORKER'S  INCOME  WOULD  BE  BELOW  THE  FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES UPON
 TERMINATION OF PPD BENEFITS.
  5. RETURN TO WORK PROGRAMS. THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMS SHALL BE  DEVELOPED
 AND IMPLEMENTED BY JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR:

 HOW  TO  BUILD  A RETURN TO WORK CULTURE WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION, PARTIC-
 ULARLY TO SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED EMPLOYERS. THESE TOOLS  SHALL  INCLUDE
 TEMPLATES  OF  SAMPLE  POLICIES  AND PROCEDURAL FRAMEWORKS FOR RETURN TO
 WORK PROGRAMS, AND ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF  EFFECTIVE
 RETURN  TO  WORK PROTOCOLS. IN ADDITION, THE BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF
 LABOR SHALL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT,  WITH  INPUT  FROM  STAKEHOLDERS,  AN
 EDUCATION  PROGRAM  FOR  ALL  PARTICIPANTS  IN THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION
 SYSTEM, INCLUDING EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES, CARRIERS,  CLAIMANTS'  ATTOR-
 NEYS  AND  CLAIMS EXAMINERS, ON THE VALUE AND COMPONENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE
 RETURN TO WORK PROGRAM AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES IN  ASSURING  POSITIVE
 RETURN TO WORK OUTCOMES.
  (B)  EMPLOYER  RETURN  TO  WORK  POLICIES.  THE  BOARD SHALL REQUIRE A
 FORMAL, CONSISTENT RETURN TO WORK POLICY OF ALL NEW YORK  EMPLOYERS  WHO
 EMPLOY  MORE  THAN  TWENTY-FIVE  INDIVIDUALS, AND CARRIERS SHALL PROVIDE
 MODEL POLICIES FOR EMPLOYERS OF FEWER THAN TWENTY-FIVE. THE POLICY SHALL
 BE WRITTEN AND TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE EMPLOYER.
  (C) RETURN TO WORK COMMUNICATION. THE BOARD SHALL REDESIGN  THE  FORMS
 IT  USES  TO  ENCOURAGE AND IMPROVE EARLY AND FREQUENT OUTREACH FROM THE
 EMPLOYER TO THE INJURED WORKER, FROM THE PHYSICIAN TO THE  EMPLOYER  AND
 FROM THE PHYSICIAN TO THE INJURED WORKER. THESE FORMS SHALL SEEK CLEARER
 INFORMATION ON JOB DUTIES AND PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF A GIVEN JOB; ASCERTAIN
 THE EXTENT TO WHICH PHYSICIANS ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THE INJURED WORKER
 ABOUT  RETURN TO WORK; AND CONTAIN INFORMATION THAT WILL ALLOW REVIEW BY
 BOARD STAFF TO ENSURE THAT INJURED WORKERS ARE  NOT  NEEDLESSLY  DELAYED
 TREATMENT OR SERVICES THAT COULD FACILITATE RETURN TO WORK.
  (D)  IMPROVEMENTS  IN  THE  PHYSICIAN'S  ROLE. THE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH
 CLINICS, ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, SHALL DEVELOP CONTENT
 AND CURRICULUM FOR A CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION COURSE  ON  RETURN  TO
 WORK.  THE  BOARD  SHALL IMPROVE TRAINING OF PHYSICIANS AROUND RETURN TO
 WORK PRINCIPLES. THE BOARD SHALL ASSURE THAT PHYSICIANS ARE  COMPENSATED
 FOR  THE  TIME  IT  TAKES  TO EVALUATE TRUE RETURN TO WORK OPPORTUNITIES
 WITHIN THE INJURED WORKER'S FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES.
  (E) VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION EVALUATIONS. THE BOARD SHALL ASSURE THAT
 A NEUTRAL, NON-MEDICAL VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION EVALUATION IS  PROVIDED
 TO  ALL  CLAIMANTS  WHO  HAVE NOT RETURNED TO WORK AT THE TIME THEY HAVE
 REACHED MAXIMUM MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR RETURN TO
 WORK WOULD BE FACILITATED BY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OR TRAINING. THE EVAL-
 UATION SHALL BE DONE UNDER A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL  ESTABLISHED  BY  THE
 BOARD  AND  SHALL  BE BINDING ON ALL PARTIES.  THE VOCATIONAL ASSESSMENT
 SHALL BE PAID FOR BY THE CARRIER, SELF-INSURED  EMPLOYER  OR  THE  STATE

 INJURED  WORKERS AND ARE APPROPRIATELY FUNDED. THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE AND
 THE COSTS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE BOARD. IF THE EVALUATION
 RECOMMENDS  VOCATIONAL  EDUCATION  OR  RETRAINING,  THE  COSTS  SHALL BE
 COVERED FIRST BY APPROPRIATE SOURCES OF STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING. CARRI-
 ERS SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO SEEK A CHANGE IN AN INJURED WORKER'S CLAS-
 SIFICATION STATUS WHILE THAT INDIVIDUAL  IS  ACTIVELY  PARTICIPATING  IN

 UALIZED REEMPLOYMENT PLAN DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF THE VOCATIONAL  REHA-
 BILITATION EVALUATION.
  (G)  INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THE BOARD, THE DEPARTMENT, AND THE DEPARTMENT
 OF FINANCIAL SERVICES  SHALL  DEVELOP  INCENTIVE  PROGRAMS  TARGETED  TO
 HIRING  WORKERS  WHO  HAVE  PERMANENT  WORK RESTRICTIONS. THESE PROGRAMS

 SHALL  INCLUDE  THOSE WHICH OFFER EMPLOYERS WAGE SUBSIDIES FOR EMPLOYING
 AND RETRAINING INJURED WORKERS,  REIMBURSEMENT  FOR  WORKPLACE  ACCOMMO-
 DATIONS TO ENABLE INJURED WORKERS TO ADJUST THE JOB TO THEIR CAPACITIES,

 IMPROVEMENT TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF RETURN  TO  WORK.  PARTIC-
 IPANTS IN THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE
 LAW  JUDGES,  SHALL BE EDUCATED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RETURN TO WORK. THE
 BOARD SHALL ESTABLISH A PROCEDURE TO ENSURE THAT ALL CLAIMANTS  WHO  ARE
 ELIGIBLE FOR A REDUCED EARNING AWARD RECEIVE SUCH AWARD.
  (J)  RETURN  TO  WORK  FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. A "PAY WITHOUT PREJUDICE"
 PILOT PROGRAM SHALL BE  UNDERTAKEN  WITH  STATE  AGENCIES  AND  SELECTED
 PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SPEED UP APPROPRIATE MEDICAL
 TREATMENT  TO WORKERS THAT SUSTAIN WORKPLACE INJURIES. THE PROGRAM SHALL
 BE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER IMPROVEMENTS IN TIMELINESS  OF  MEDICAL
 AUTHORIZATION  RESULTS IMPROVE RETURN TO WORK OUTCOMES OF PUBLIC EMPLOY-
 EES.

  2.  THIS  SECTION  SHALL  NOT  APPLY  TO EMPLOYERS THAT SELF-INSURE OR
 EMPLOYERS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF A WORKERS' COMPENSATION GROUP SELF-INSURED
 TRUST.
  3. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, "CONSTRUCTION  CLASS"  MEANS  THE
 WORK  OR OCCUPATION DESCRIBED IN "GROUP 3" OF SUBDIVISION ONE OF SECTION
 THREE OF THIS CHAPTER.
  § 18. Subdivision 1 of section 117 of the workers'  compensation  law,
 as  amended  by  chapter  17  of the laws of 1984, is amended to read as
 follows:
  1. The board may adopt reasonable rules consistent  with  and  supple-
 mental to the provisions of this chapter and the labor law. The chairman
 may  make  reasonable regulations consistent with the provisions of this
 chapter and the labor law. THE BOARD MAY NOT UTILIZE "SUBJECT  NUMBERS",
 FORMS OR OTHER INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS OUTSIDE OF ITS RULES, REGULATIONS

  §  19.  The  opening  paragraph  and  second undesignated paragraph of
 section 120 of the workers' compensation law, the opening  paragraph  as
 amended  by chapter 105 of the laws of 2019, and the second undesignated
 paragraph as amended by chapter 61 of the laws of 1989, are  amended  to
 read as follows:
  It  shall  be  unlawful for any employer or his or her duly authorized
 agent to discharge, THREATEN, PENALIZE, or fail to reinstate pursuant to
 section two hundred three-b of this chapter,  or  in  any  other  manner
 discriminate  OR  RETALIATE against an employee as to his or her employ-
 ment (I) because such employee has claimed or attempted to claim compen-
 sation from such employer, requested a claim form for injuries  received
 in  the course of employment, or claimed or attempted to claim any bene-
 fits provided under  this  chapter  [or],  (II)  BECAUSE  SUCH  EMPLOYER
 BELIEVES  THAT  SUCH  EMPLOYEE  HAS  CLAIMED OR WILL CLAIM COMPENSATION;
 (III) BECAUSE SUCH EMPLOYEE HAS CAUSED TO BE INSTITUTED OR IS  ABOUT  TO
 INSTITUTE  A CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION OR OTHER BENEFIT UNDER THIS CHAPTER;
 (IV) because he or she has  testified  or  is  about  to  testify  in  a
 proceeding  under  this  chapter  [and no other valid reason is shown to
 exist for such action by the employer]; OR (V) BECAUSE SUCH EMPLOYEE HAS
 OTHERWISE EXERCISED RIGHTS PROTECTED UNDER THIS CHAPTER. FOR PURPOSES OF
 THIS PROVISION, "BECAUSE" SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE THAT THE LIST-
 ED ACTIVITY WAS AT LEAST A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE EMPLOYER'S ACTION.
 A. 337  29
 
  Any complaint alleging such an unlawful discriminatory  practice  must
 be filed within two years of the commission of such practice. Upon find-
 ing  that an employer has violated this section, the board shall make an
 order that any employee so discriminated against shall  be  restored  to
 employment or otherwise restored to the position or privileges he or she
 would  have  had  but for the discrimination and shall be compensated by
 his or her employer for any loss of compensation  arising  out  of  such
 discrimination  together  with  such  fees  or  allowances  for services
 rendered by an attorney or  licensed  representative  as  fixed  by  the
 board.  Any  employer  who  violates  this  section shall be liable to a
 penalty of not less than one [hundred] THOUSAND  dollars  or  more  than
 [five  hundred] TEN THOUSAND dollars, as may be determined by the board.
 All such penalties shall be  paid  [into  the  state  treasury]  TO  THE
 EMPLOYEE SO DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.  All penalties, compensation and fees
 or  allowances  shall be paid solely by the employer. The employer alone
 and not his or her carrier  shall  be  liable  for  such  penalties  and
 payments.  Any provision in an insurance policy undertaking to relieve
 the employer from liability for such penalties  and  payments  shall  be
 void.
  §  20.  Paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  of subdivision 1, subdivision 7 and
 subdivision 11 of section 137 of the workers' compensation law, as added
 by chapter 473 of the laws of 2000, are amended to read as follows:
  (a) A copy of each report of independent medical examination ON BEHALF
 OF AN EMPLOYER OR CARRIER shall be submitted by the practitioner on  the
 same day and in the same manner to the board, the insurance carrier, the
 claimant's  attending  physician  or  other  attending practitioner, the
 claimant's representative and the claimant.
  (b) If a practitioner who has performed or will be performing an inde-
 pendent medical examination of a claimant ON BEHALF OF  AN  EMPLOYER  OR
 CARRIER  receives  a  request  for  information  regarding the claimant,
 including faxed or electronically transmitted requests, the practitioner
 shall submit a copy of the request for information to the  board  within
 ten days of receipt of the request. Nothing in this subdivision shall be
 construed to abrogate the attorney-client privilege.
  7.  The  claimant  shall receive notice by mail of the scheduled inde-
 pendent medical examination ON BEHALF OF AN EMPLOYER OR CARRIER at least
 seven business days prior to such examination. Such notice shall  advise
 the  claimant  if  the  practitioner intends to record or video tape the
 examination, and shall advise the claimant of their right to video  tape
 or otherwise record the examination. Claimants shall be advised of their
 right  to be accompanied during the exam by an individual or individuals
 of their choosing.
  11. At the time of the independent medical examination ON BEHALF OF AN
 EMPLOYER OR CARRIER the claimant shall receive a notice from the  entity
 performing the independent medical examination, on a form which shall be
 approved  and  promulgated  by  the  chair, stating the rights and obli-
 gations of the claimant and the practitioner with respect to such  exam,
 and such notice shall include but not be limited to a statement that the
 claimant's  receipt  of benefits could be denied, terminated, or reduced
 as a result of a determination which may be based upon the medical eval-
 uation made after such independent medical examination, and  the  claim-
 ant's rights to challenge or appeal such a determination.
  § 21. The workers' compensation law is amended by adding a new section
 208-a to read as follows:
  §  208-A. COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS OF DISABILITY BENEFITS IN CERTAIN
 CASES. 1. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION  OF  LAW,  EFFECTIVE  JULY
 A. 337  30

 FIRST,  TWO  THOUSAND  TWENTY-FOUR,  IN  ADDITION  TO  ANY  OTHER AMOUNT
 RECEIVED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE AS DISABILITY  BENEFITS,  AN  EMPLOYEE
 WITH  A  PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY OR THE BENEFICIARY-DEPENDENT OF SUCH
 EMPLOYEE  SHALL BE ENTITLED TO AN ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE, TO BE KNOWN AS A
 COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ALLOWANCE, PAYABLE ANNUALLY.
  2. THE COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ALLOWANCE SHALL BE COMPUTED BY APPLY-
 ING AN ADJUSTMENT FOR REGIONAL COSTS OF LIVING AND  SHALL  BE  BASED  ON
 FIFTY  PERCENT  OF  THE  ANNUAL  INCREASE IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AS
 PROMULGATED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.
  § 22. This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however,  that
 if  chapter  27 of the laws of 2022 has not taken effect then the amend-
 ments made to section 24  of  the  workers'  compensation  law  made  by
 section  11  of  this  act shall take effect on the same date and in the
 same manner as chapter 27 of the laws of 2022, takes effect.
