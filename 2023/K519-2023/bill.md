  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Spondyloarthritis  Awareness  Month  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months and days that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of
serious issues that affect the lives of residents of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as
Spondyloarthritis Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Spondyloarthritis is the name given to a family of  closely
related, chronic rheumatic diseases impacting 1 in 100 Americans; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Spondyloarthritis  affects  3.2 million adults in the U.S.
and is a condition for which there is no known cure; and
 
  WHEREAS, There are many impacted by the disease  that  unfortunately
remain undiagnosed due to inadequate awareness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Spondyloarthritis  includes  ankylosing  spondylitis,
psoriatic  arthritis,  reactive  arthritis,  enteropathic  arthritis,
juvenile  spondyloarthritis,  undifferentiated  spondyloarthritis,
peripheral  spondyloarthritis,  axial  spondyloarthritis,  and
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis; and
 
  WHEREAS, A portion of people with spondyloarthritis will progress to
spinal  fusion  and  will  be  prone to fractures, thoracic kyphosis, or
eroded peripheral  joints  occurring  especially  within  the  hips  and
shoulders; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, complications from spondyloarthritis may cause
serious  inflammation  in other organs including the heart, lungs, skin,
gastrointestinal tract, nerves, and eyes; and
 
  WHEREAS, Early diagnosis is critical  in  effectively  treating  the
disease,  preventing certain complications, reducing medical disability,
and improving quality of life  and  function  for  those  impacted  with
spondyloarthritis; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, an increase in awareness of spondyloarthritis
and its symptoms - with  both  medical  professionals  and  the  general
public  -  can  increase the likelihood of earlier diagnosis with all of
its benefits to patients and society; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,
Spondyloarthritis Awareness Month in the State of New York,  and  be  it
further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
