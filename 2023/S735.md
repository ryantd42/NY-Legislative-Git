 TION INDEX PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE. THIS SUBDIVISION DOES NOT REQUIRE A
 FORENSIC DNA LABORATORY TO TEST ALL ITEMS OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE  OBTAINED
 IN  A  SEXUAL  OFFENSE FORENSIC EVIDENCE EXAMINATION OR A SEXUAL OFFENSE
 INVESTIGATION.  FOR  THE  PURPOSE OF TIMELY PROCESSING OF SEXUAL OFFENSE
 FORENSIC EVIDENCE, THIS SUBDIVISION INTENDS  TO  ENSURE  THAT  THE  BEST
 EVIDENCE  IS  SELECTED  AND  ANALYZED  AS  SOON AS PRACTICABLE AMONG THE
 REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE, BASED ON THE  MEDICAL  EXAM-
 INATION  OR THE SEXUAL OFFENSE INVESTIGATION, THE COLLECTION AND PRESER-

 FORENSIC EVIDENCE TESTING AND ANALYSIS FOR INCLUSION IN  THE  STATE  DNA
 IDENTIFICATION INDEX.
  (II)  SUCH LABORATORY SHALL PERFORM THE REQUISITE TESTING AND ANALYSIS
 WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF  ITS  RECEIPT  OF  THE  SEXUAL  OFFENSE  FORENSIC
 EVIDENCE IF SUFFICIENT STAFFING AND RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. AN ANALYSIS
 SHALL INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF DNA EVIDENCE, DEVELOPMENT OF A POTENTIAL
 SUSPECT  PROFILE,  AND THE FORWARDING OF THE RESULTING DNA RECORD TO THE
 STATE DNA IDENTIFICATION INDEX IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS OF THE
 DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES.
  (D) THE FAILURE OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO SUBMIT  SEXUAL  OFFENSE
 FORENSIC  EVIDENCE  WITHIN THE PERIOD REQUIRED BY THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL
 NOT AFFECT THE AUTHORITY OF (I) THE AGENCY TO SUBMIT THE EVIDENCE  TO  A
 FORENSIC DNA LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS OR (II) OF A FORENSIC DNA LABORATO-
 RY TO ANALYZE THE EVIDENCE OR PROVIDE THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS TO THE
 APPROPRIATE AGENCIES AND THE STATE DNA IDENTIFICATION INDEX.
  (E)  A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN POSSESSION OF SEXUAL OFFENSE FORENSIC
 EVIDENCE THAT HAS NOT BEEN FORWARDED TO A FORENSIC DNA LABORATORY WITHIN
 THE TIME FRAME REQUIRED BY THIS  SUBDIVISION  SHALL:  (I)  BY  SEPTEMBER
 FIRST OF EACH YEAR SUBMIT TO THE DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES A
 LIST  OF  THE  AGENCY'S  ACTIVE  CRIMINAL CASES FOR WHICH SEXUAL OFFENSE
 FORENSIC EVIDENCE HAS NOT YET BEEN FORWARDED TO A FORENSIC DNA LABORATO-
 RY; AND (II) SUBMIT TO THE DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE  SERVICES  OR  A
 FORENSIC  DNA LABORATORY, AS APPROPRIATE AND SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY
 OF STORAGE SPACE, ALL SEXUAL OFFENSE  FORENSIC  EVIDENCE  PERTAINING  TO

 GOVERNOR AND THE APPROPRIATE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES OF  THE  SENATE  AND
 THE  ASSEMBLY A REQUEST FOR ANY NECESSARY FUNDING TO ACCOMPLISH ANALYSES
 OF SEXUAL OFFENSE FORENSIC EVIDENCE REQUIRED BY THIS SUBDIVISION.
  (G) THE DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES MAY SOLICIT  APPROPRIATE
 GRANTS  AND  FUNDING  OPPORTUNITIES  IN  FURTHERANCE  OF  THE ACTIVITIES
 REQUIRED BY THIS SUBDIVISION FROM FOUNDATIONS, OTHER GOVERNMENTAL  AGEN-
 CIES  AND  INDIVIDUALS,  UNDER SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THE DIVISION
 SHALL DEEM APPROPRIATE.
