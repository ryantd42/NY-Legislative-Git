 AN ACT making an appropriation to reimburse St. John's Episcopal  Hospi-
  tal  in  Far Rockaway for costs incurred as a result of remaining open
  and providing services to the community  during  and  after  Hurricane
  Sandy

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that St. John's
 Episcopal Hospital, located in Far Rockaway, in the  county  of  Queens,
 remained  open  and  provided services to the community during and after
 the storms, rains, or floods which occurred during the period  beginning
 on  October  29,  2012  and  ending November 3, 2012 known as "Hurricane
 Sandy." As a result of remaining open  and  providing  services  to  the
 community during Hurricane Sandy, St. John's Episcopal Hospital incurred
 many additional expenses and losses, including, but not limited to:
  a.  uncompensated  care  that does not meet DMS/HHS criteria for acute
 care reimbursement, including  providing  care  for  patients  requiring
 dialysis  or  a ventilator who do not have a residence, nursing home, or
 adult home to return to;
  b. providing shelter, clothing, and meals to residents and  staff  who
 lost homes or were temporarily unable to return to their residences. St.
 John's  Episcopal  Hospital provided more than 2,000 meals a day between
 October 28, 2012 and November 12, 2012;
  c. lost revenue due to cancelled surgery and ambulatory services;
  d. lost revenue due to the detoxification unit being closed  in  order
 to provide shelter services;
  e. additional staffing and overtime expenditures;
  f.  electrical  technician  services, the operation of back-up genera-
 tors, and fuel costs for the generators.
