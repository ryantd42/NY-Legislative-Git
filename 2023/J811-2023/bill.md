  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Pediatric Stroke Awareness Month in the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside to increase awareness of serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it  is the sense of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  May  2023,  as  Pediatric
Stroke Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Stroke  occurs  at a rate of one in 3,500 live births each
year, and five in 100,000 children per year; currently, stroke is one of
the top 10 causes of death for children between the ages of one and  19;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Of children surviving stroke, about 60% will have permanent
neurological deficits, most commonly hemiparesis or hemiplegia, learning
and  behavioral  difficulties,  and may require ongoing physical therapy
and surgeries; and
 
  WHEREAS, The life-long health concerns and treatments resulting from
Pediatric Stroke result in a heavy financial and emotional toll  on  the
child, the family, and society; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Very  little  is  known  about  the  cause,  treatment and
prevention of Pediatric Stroke; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Pediatric  Stroke  risk  factors,  symptoms,  prevention
efforts,  and  treatment are often different in children than in adults;
and
 
  WHEREAS, Only through medical research can effective  treatment  and
prevention  strategies for Pediatric Stroke be identified and developed;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  early  diagnosis  and  commencement  of  treatment  of
Pediatric  Stroke greatly improves chances of recovery and prevention of
recurrence; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater public awareness  of
Pediatric  Stroke,  and  more  must  be done to increase activity at the
State, local and national levels to support those afflicted as  well  as
their families; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim  May  2023,  as  Pediatric
Stroke Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
