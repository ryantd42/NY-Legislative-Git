  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  March 26-April 1, 2023,  as  Cleaning  Week  in  the
  State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize that
the  quality  and  character  of life in the communities across New York
State are reflective of the concerned and dedicated efforts of  cleaning
organizations  and  front-line  cleaning  professionals  who  devote
themselves to the welfare of the community and its citizenry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Service to community and country is the foundation  of  our
society, and the contributions and future efforts of those in service to
them  are  a  vital  part  of,  and valuable asset to, the fabric of our
communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  it is the intent of this Legislative Body to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 26-April 1, 2023, as
Cleaning Week in the State of New York,  in  conjunction  with  National
Cleaning Week; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Held  on  the  fourth  Sunday  in  March,  Cleaning  Week
celebrates the importance, value, and positive impact that cleaning  has
on public health, the environment, and the economy; this week also calls
to  raise  public  awareness  for  the value of clean spaces, appreciate
front-line professionals, promote cleaning organizations,  and  advocate
for the cleaning industry; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Maintaining  a clean environment helps to lower the spread
of viruses, bacteria,  and  other  pathogens  that  cause  diseases  and
trigger allergic reactions; furthermore, a clean space has been found to
be  closely associated with improved moods, decreased stress levels, and
enhanced productivity; and
 
  WHEREAS, The International Sanitary Supply Association  (ISSA),  the
worldwide  cleaning industry association, uses National Cleaning Week to
promote the importance of cleanliness, provide education  and  training,
raise  the  profile of the cleaning industry, feature ways to engage and
explore educational opportunities, support  charitable  causes  for  the
benefit of the industry, and more; and
 
  WHEREAS,  To  welcome  a  fresh  start  with  spring,  Cleaning Week
encourages people to discard winter essentials, declutter, and  tidy  up
our  homes;  the week also aims to celebrate the heroes who toil hard to
give us clean homes and offices so people can live  and  work  in  clean
environments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  light  of their commitment, dedication, and successful
efforts, it is the sense of this Legislative Body to extend its  highest
commendation  to  the  many  citizens  that  work tirelessly to preserve
cleanliness and promote public health in the State  of  New  York;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim March 26-April 1, 2023, as
Cleaning Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
