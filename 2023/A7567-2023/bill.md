  § 3. Paragraph (d) of subdivision 5 of section 70.45 of the penal law,
 as amended by chapter 427 of the laws of 2021, is  amended  to  read  as
 follows:
  (d)  When a person is alleged to have violated a condition of post-re-
 lease supervision by absconding, OR BY COMMITTING A NEW CRIME DURING THE
 PERIOD OF POST-RELEASE SUPERVISION THAT CULMINATES IN A  NEW  INDETERMI-
 NATE  OR  DETERMINATE  SENTENCE,  and  the department of corrections and
 community supervision has declared such person to be delinquent: (i) the
 declaration of delinquency shall interrupt the  period  of  post-release
 supervision;  (ii)  such interruption shall continue until the person is
 restored to post-release supervision; (iii) if the person is restored to
 post-release supervision without being returned  to  the  department  of
 corrections  and  community  supervision, any time spent in custody from
 the date of delinquency until restoration  to  post-release  supervision
 shall  first be credited to the maximum or aggregate maximum term of the
 sentence or sentences of imprisonment, but only to the extent authorized
 by subdivision three of section 70.40 of this article.  Any time  spent
 in  custody  solely pursuant to such delinquency after completion of the
 maximum or aggregate maximum term of the sentence or sentences of impri-
 sonment shall be credited to the period of post-release supervision,  if
 any;  and  (iv)  if  the person is ordered returned to the department of
 corrections and community supervision, the person shall be  required  to
 serve  the  time  assessment  before  being  re-released to post-release
 supervision. If the person is detained  pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of
 subdivision  three  of section two hundred fifty-nine-i of the executive
 law pending a preliminary or final revocation hearing, the time  assess-
 ment imposed following such hearing shall commence upon the execution of
 the  warrant.  If  a  warrant  was executed pursuant to paragraph (a) of
 subdivision three of section two hundred fifty-nine-i of  the  executive
 law but a court released the person pending a preliminary or final revo-
 cation  hearing, the time assessment shall commence upon the issuance of
 a determination after a final hearing that the person has  violated  one
 or more conditions of community supervision in an important respect, and
 shall  include  the  time  period  between  execution of the warrant and
 release of the person pending a preliminary or final revocation hearing.
 If a [releasee] PERSON is committed to the custody of the sheriff pursu-

 ant to article five hundred thirty of the criminal  procedure  law,  the
 time  assessment,  if  any, shall include any time the [releasee] PERSON
 spent in such custody. If a notice of violation was issued  pursuant  to
 subdivision  three  of section two hundred fifty-nine-i of the executive
 law, the time assessment shall commence upon the issuance of a  determi-
 nation  after  a  final hearing that the person has violated one or more
 conditions of supervision. While serving  such  assessment,  the  person
 shall  not receive any good behavior allowance pursuant to section eight
 hundred three of the correction law.  Any time spent in custody from the
 date of delinquency until return to the department  of  corrections  and
 community  supervision  shall first be credited to the maximum or aggre-
 gate maximum term of the sentence or sentences of imprisonment, but only
 to the extent authorized by subdivision three of section 70.40  of  this
 article.  The  maximum  or  aggregate  maximum  term  of the sentence or
 sentences of imprisonment shall run while the  person  is  serving  such
 time  assessment  in  the  custody  of the department of corrections and
 community supervision. Any time spent in custody solely pursuant to such
 delinquency after completion of the maximum or aggregate maximum term of
 the sentence or sentences of imprisonment shall be credited to the peri-
 od of post-release supervision, if any.
  § 4. This act  shall  take  effect  immediately  and  shall  apply  to
 sentences imposed before, on and after such date.
