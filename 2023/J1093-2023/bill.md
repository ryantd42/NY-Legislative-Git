  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to declare
  June 2023, as  North  American  Hurricane  Awareness
  Month  in the State of New York, at the start of the
  Atlantic hurricane season
 
  WHEREAS, It is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy Hochul to declare June 2023, as North American Hurricane
Awareness Month in the State of New York, at the start of  the  Atlantic
hurricane season; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Atlantic  hurricane  season  runs  from  June  1st to
November 30th; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Weather Service defines a hurricane as an  intense
tropical  weather  system  with  well-defined  circulation and sustained
winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher; and
 
  WHEREAS, The category scale  of  1-5  estimates  potential  property
damage, where a category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane; as
the  wind  speed and intensity of a storm increases, the category number
increases; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hurricanes  can  pose  a  significant  threat  to  many
communities;  the  damage  and trauma sustained from Hurricane Sandy was
the deadliest and  most  destructive  hurricane  of  the  2012  Atlantic
hurricane season in New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  four stages of hurricane development: tropical
disturbance,  tropical  depression,  tropical  storm,  tropical  cyclone
(hurricane); and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tropical disturbance is defined when cloud columns develop
into  a  cluster  of  thunderstorms;  tropical  depression  is  when
thunderstorms  intensify,  with  maximum  sustained winds of 38 mph; and
tropical storm is when maximum sustained winds are  between  39-73  mph;
during  this  time, the storm becomes more circular in shape, with winds
swirling around a calm center, known as the eye; this is when the  storm
is named; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Tropical  cyclone, or hurricane, is when wind speeds reach
74 mph and the storm is at least 50,000 feet high and 125 miles  across,
rotating around an eye that spans 5-30 miles wide; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Hurricane Center strongly advises hurricane
preparedness and that it begins at home; and
 
  WHEREAS, For many people, hurricane preparedness is not at  the  top
of  their  to-do  list; most families have to juggle multiple, competing
priorities; the Red Cross believes preparedness matters because it saves
lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Hurricanes are  life-threatening  storms;  they  can  bring
heavy rains that cause major flooding, destructive winds that down power
 
lines,  uproot  trees  and  damage  homes,  and storm surges that travel
several miles inland destroying everything in its path; and
 
  WHEREAS, Preparation is the best protection against the dangers of a
hurricane;  families  and  individuals should build an emergency kit and
create an evacuation plan for their household; and
 
  WHEREAS, A vital emergency kit should be equipped  with  the  proper
supplies  you  may  need  in the event of an emergency or disaster; at a
minimum, you should have the basic  supplies,  including:  water,  food,
flashlight,  battery-powered or hand-crank radio, extra batteries, first
aid kit, medications and medical items, multi-purpose  tool,  sanitation
and  personal  hygiene  items,  copies of personal documents, cell phone
with chargers, family and emergency  contact  information,  extra  cash,
emergency blanket, and map(s) of the area; and
 
  WHEREAS,  An  effective  evacuation  plan has three steps and begins
with a family discussion on how to prepare and respond to all  types  of
emergencies  that  are  most  likely to happen where you live, work, and
play; and
 
  WHEREAS, Step two is to identify responsibilities for each member of
your household and how you will work together  as  a  team  if  disaster
strikes; and the final step includes practicing as many elements of your
plan as possible; and
 
  WHEREAS,  As  hurricane  season  approaches, it is also important to
know the  difference  between  the  threat  levels;  a  hurricane  watch
indicates  the  possibility  that  a  region  could experience hurricane
conditions within 48 hours;  and  a  hurricane  warning  indicates  that
sustained  winds  of  at  least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours; get
ready to act if a warning is issued and stay informed;  now,  therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  declare  June  2023,  as  North
American  Hurricane  Awareness  Month  in  the State of New York, at the
start of the Atlantic hurricane season; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
