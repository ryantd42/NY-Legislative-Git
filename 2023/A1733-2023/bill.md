 Introduced  by M. of A. GOODELL -- read once and referred to the Commit-
  tee on Energy
 
 AN ACT to amend the  public  service  law  and  the  executive  law,  in
  relation to requiring financial security for reclamation for solar and
  wind electric generating systems
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The public service law is amended by adding a  new  section
 66-u to read as follows:
  § 66-U. FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR RECLAMATION FOR SOLAR AND WIND ELECTRIC
 GENERATING  SYSTEMS. 1. BEFORE THE COMMISSION MAY ISSUE A PERMIT OR FIND
 A SOLAR OR WIND ELECTRIC GENERATING SYSTEM IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY  TERMS
 AND  CONDITIONS  SET  FORTH  IN ANY PERMIT ALREADY ISSUED, THE APPLICANT
 SHALL FURNISH FINANCIAL SECURITY TO ENSURE THE PERFORMANCE  OF  RECLAMA-
 TION  AS  PROVIDED  IN  THE  APPROVED  PLAN FOR A SOLAR OR WIND ELECTRIC
 GENERATING SYSTEM AND NAMING THE STATE AS BENEFICIARY. FINANCIAL SECURI-
 TY SHALL BE IN THE FORM OF A BOND FROM A CORPORATE SURETY LICENSED TO DO
 BUSINESS AS SUCH IN THE STATE OR ANY OTHER  FORM  THE  COMMISSION  DEEMS
 ACCEPTABLE.  ANY INTEREST ACCRUING AS A RESULT OF SUCH SECURITY SHALL BE
 THE EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OF THE PERMITTEE.
  2. THE COMMISSION SHALL DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, CONDITION, AND TERMS  OF
 THE  FINANCIAL  SECURITY.  THE  AMOUNT SHALL BE BASED UPON THE ESTIMATED
 COST OF RECLAIMING THE AFFECTED LAND, WHICH SHALL BE BASED  ON  INFORMA-
 TION CONTAINED IN THE PERMIT APPLICATION AND UPON SUCH INFORMATION AS AN
 INVESTIGATION BY THE COMMISSION MAY DISCLOSE.
  3.  THE FINANCIAL SECURITY SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT UNTIL
 THE COMMISSION HAS APPROVED THE RECLAMATION. AT THE  DISCRETION  OF  THE
 COMMISSION,  THE PERMITTEE MAY SECURE THE RELEASE OF THAT PORTION OF THE
 FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR AFFECTED  LAND  ON  WHICH  RECLAMATION  HAS  BEEN
 COMPLETED AND APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

  4. IF THE FINANCIAL SECURITY SHALL FOR ANY REASON BE CANCELLED, WITHIN
 THIRTY  DAYS AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE THEREOF, THE PERMITTEE SHALL PROVIDE
 A VALID REPLACEMENT UNDER THE  SAME  CONDITIONS  AS  DESCRIBED  IN  THIS
 SECTION.  FAILURE TO PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT BOND WITHIN SUCH PERIOD MAY,
 AT  THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMISSION, RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION
 OF THE PERMIT.
  5. IF A PERMIT IS SUSPENDED OR REVOKED, THE COMMISSION MAY REQUIRE THE
 PERMITTEE TO COMMENCE RECLAMATION UPON THIRTY DAYS NOTICE.
  6. IF THE PERMITTEE FAILS TO COMMENCE OR TO COMPLETE  THE  RECLAMATION
 AS  REQUIRED, THE COMMISSION MAY ATTACH THE FINANCIAL SECURITY FURNISHED
 BY THE PERMITTEE. IN ANY EVENT, THE FULL COST OF COMPLETING  RECLAMATION
 SHALL  BE  THE  PERSONAL  LIABILITY  OF  THE PERMITTEE AND/OR THE PERSON
 OWNING OR OPERATING THE SOLAR OR WIND ELECTRIC GENERATING SYSTEM AND THE
 COMMISSION, ACTING BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, MAY BRING  SUIT  TO  RECOVER
 ALL COSTS TO SECURE THE RECLAMATION NOT COVERED BY THE FINANCIAL SECURI-
 TY.  THE MATERIALS, MACHINERY, IMPLEMENTS AND TOOLS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
 WHICH MAY BE FOUND AT THE SOLAR OR WIND ELECTRIC GENERATING SYSTEM SITE,
 OR  OTHER  ASSETS OF THE PERMITTEE AND/OR THE PERSON OWNING OR OPERATING
 THE SOLAR OR WIND ELECTRIC GENERATING SYSTEM SHALL BE SUBJECT TO A  LIEN
 OF  THE  COMMISSION  FOR THE AMOUNT EXPENDED FOR RECLAMATION OF AFFECTED
 LANDS AND SHALL NOT BE  REMOVED  WITHOUT  THE  WRITTEN  CONSENT  OF  THE
 COMMISSION.  SUCH LIEN MAY BE FORECLOSED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE
 SAME MANNER AS A MECHANIC'S LIEN.
  7. POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS, MUNICIPALITIES, THE UNITED STATES  AND  ANY
 OF  ITS  AGENCIES  AND  AGENCIES  OF  THE STATE SHALL BE EXEMPT FROM THE
 REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION.
  § 2. Section 94-c of the executive law is  amended  by  adding  a  new

 RATE SURETY LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS AS SUCH IN THE STATE  OR  ANY  OTHER
 FORM  THE  OFFICE DEEMS ACCEPTABLE. ANY INTEREST ACCRUING AS A RESULT OF
 SUCH SECURITY SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OF THE PERMITTEE.
  (B) THE OFFICE SHALL DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, CONDITION, AND TERMS OF THE

 RECLAIMING THE AFFECTED  LAND,  WHICH  SHALL  BE  BASED  ON  INFORMATION
 CONTAINED  IN THE SITING PERMIT APPLICATION AND UPON SUCH INFORMATION AS
 AN INVESTIGATION BY THE OFFICE MAY DISCLOSE.
  (C) THE FINANCIAL SECURITY SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT UNTIL
 THE OFFICE HAS APPROVED  THE  RECLAMATION.  AT  THE  DISCRETION  OF  THE

 COMPLETED AND APPROVED BY THE OFFICE.
