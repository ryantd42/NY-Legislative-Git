 supplies the court with proof that between the date of violation and the
 appearance  date  for  such  violation such person purchased or rented a
 seat which meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of subdivision two of
 this  section.  The  court [may] SHALL waive any fine for which a person
 who violates the provisions of subdivision two of this section would  be
 liable  if the court finds that due to reasons of economic hardship such
 person was unable to purchase a helmet or  seat.  Such  waiver  of  fine
 shall not apply to a second or subsequent conviction under paragraph (a)
 or (b) of subdivision two of this section.
  (a)  No  person  operating a bicycle shall allow a person five or more

 TEEN years of age, shall operate a bicycle unless such person is wearing
 a helmet meeting standards established by the commissioner.
  5-a. No person, one or more years of  age  and  less  than  [fourteen]
 EIGHTEEN years of age, shall skate or glide on in-line skates or a skate

 lished by the commissioner. For the purposes of this subdivision,  wear-
 ing  a helmet means having a helmet of good fit fastened securely on the
 head of such wearer with the helmet straps securely fastened.
  5-b. No person less than [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age  shall  ride
 upon,  propel or otherwise operate a two-wheeled vehicle commonly called
 a scooter unless such person  is  wearing  a  helmet  meeting  standards
 established  by the commissioner. As used in this subdivision, wearing a
 helmet means having a properly fitting helmet fixed securely on the head
 of such wearer with the helmet straps securely fastened.

 violates the provisions of subdivision five, five-a, five-b,  or  five-c

 to such economic hardship such person was unable to obtain a helmet from
 the  statewide in-line skate and bicycle helmet distribution program, as
 established in section two hundred six of the public health  law,  or  a
 local  distribution  program. Such waiver of a fine shall not apply to a
 second or subsequent violation of subdivision five-c of this section.

 person's parent or guardian and where such parent or guardian  is  eigh-
 teen  years  of  age  or more. Such summons shall only be issued to such
 parent or guardian, and shall not be issued  to  the  person  less  than
 [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age.
  9.  Subdivisions  five,  five-a, five-b, and six of this section shall
 not be applicable to any county, city, town or village that has  enacted

 S. 2785--A  3
 
 that  prohibits  a  person who is one or more years of age and less than
 [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age from operating a bicycle or skating  or
 gliding  on  in-line  skates  or a skate board without wearing a bicycle
 helmet  meeting  the standards of the American National Standards Insti-
 tute (Ansi Z 90.4 bicycle helmet standards), the Snell Memorial  Founda-
 tion's  Standards  for  Protective Headgear for use in Bicycling, or the
 American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) bike helmet  standards,
 or  that  prohibits  a person operating a bicycle from allowing a person
 five or more years of age and less than [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age
 to ride as a passenger on a bicycle unless such passenger is  wearing  a
 bicycle  helmet  that meets such standards. The failure of any person to
 comply with any such local law or ordinance shall not constitute contri-
 butory negligence or assumption of risk, and shall not in any  way  bar,
 preclude or foreclose an action for personal injury or wrongful death by
 or  on  behalf  of  such  person,  nor in any way diminish or reduce the
 damages recoverable in any such action. The legislative body of a  coun-
 ty,  city,  town  or  village  may  enact  a local law or ordinance that
 prohibits a person who is [fourteen] EIGHTEEN or more years of age  from
 skating  or gliding on in-line skates, operating a skate board, or oper-
 ating or riding as a passenger on a bicycle without  wearing  a  bicycle
 helmet.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
