 this  section.  The  court [may] SHALL waive any fine for which a person
 who violates the provisions of subdivision two of this section would  be
 liable  if the court finds that due to reasons of economic hardship such
 person  was  unable  to  purchase  a helmet or seat. Such waiver of fine
 shall not apply to a second or subsequent conviction under paragraph (a)
 or (b) of subdivision two of this section.
  (a) No person operating a bicycle shall allow a person  five  or  more
 years of age and less than [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age to ride as a
 passenger on a bicycle unless such passenger is wearing a helmet meeting
 standards established by the commissioner.
  (b) No person, one or more years of age and less than [fourteen] EIGH-
 TEEN years of age, shall operate a bicycle unless such person is wearing
 a helmet meeting standards established by the commissioner.
  5-a.  No  person,  one  or  more years of age and less than [fourteen]
 EIGHTEEN years of age, shall skate or glide on in-line skates or a skate
 board unless such person is wearing a helmet  meeting  standards  estab-
 lished  by the commissioner. For the purposes of this subdivision, wear-
 ing a helmet means having a helmet of good fit fastened securely on  the
 head of such wearer with the helmet straps securely fastened.
  5-b.  No  person less than [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age shall ride
 upon, propel or otherwise operate a two-wheeled vehicle commonly  called
 a  scooter  unless  such  person  is  wearing a helmet meeting standards
 established by the commissioner. As used in this subdivision, wearing  a
 helmet means having a properly fitting helmet fixed securely on the head
 of such wearer with the helmet straps securely fastened.
  8.  (a) A police officer shall only issue a summons for a violation of
 subdivision two, five, or five-a of this section by a person  less  than
 [fourteen]  EIGHTEEN  years  of  age  to  the parent or guardian of such
 person if the violation by such person occurs in the  presence  of  such
 person's  parent  or guardian and where such parent or guardian is eigh-
 teen years of age or more. Such summons shall only  be  issued  to  such
 parent  or  guardian,  and  shall  not be issued to the person less than
 [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age.
  (b) A police officer shall only issue a summons  for  a  violation  of
 subdivision five-c of this section by a person less than [sixteen] EIGH-
 TEEN  years  of  age  to  the  parent  or guardian of such person if the
 violation by such person occurs in the presence of such person's  parent
 or  guardian  and where such parent or guardian is eighteen years of age
 or more. Such summons shall only be issued to such parent  or  guardian,
 and shall not be issued to the person less than [sixteen] EIGHTEEN years
 of age.
  9.  Subdivisions  five,  five-a, five-b, and six of this section shall
 not be applicable to any county, city, town or village that has  enacted
 a local law or ordinance prior to the effective date of this subdivision
 that  prohibits  a  person who is one or more years of age and less than
 [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age from operating a bicycle or skating  or
 gliding  on  in-line  skates  or a skate board without wearing a bicycle
 helmet meeting the standards of the American National  Standards  Insti-
 tute  (Ansi Z 90.4 bicycle helmet standards), the Snell Memorial Founda-
 tion's Standards for Protective Headgear for use in  Bicycling,  or  the
 American  Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) bike helmet standards,
 or that prohibits a person operating a bicycle from  allowing  a  person
 five or more years of age and less than [fourteen] EIGHTEEN years of age
 to  ride  as a passenger on a bicycle unless such passenger is wearing a
 bicycle helmet that meets such standards. The failure of any  person  to
 comply with any such local law or ordinance shall not constitute contri-
 S. 2785  3
 
 butory  negligence  or assumption of risk, and shall not in any way bar,
 preclude or foreclose an action for personal injury or wrongful death by
 or on behalf of such person, nor in  any  way  diminish  or  reduce  the
 damages  recoverable in any such action. The legislative body of a coun-
 ty, city, town or village may  enact  a  local  law  or  ordinance  that
 prohibits  a person who is [fourteen] EIGHTEEN or more years of age from
 skating or gliding on in-line skates, operating a skate board, or  oper-
 ating  or  riding  as a passenger on a bicycle without wearing a bicycle
 helmet.
  § 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
