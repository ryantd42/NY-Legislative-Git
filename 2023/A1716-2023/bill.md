 AN ACT to amend the education law, in relation  to  redefining  science,
  technology, engineering, and math education (STEM)
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative findings and  intent.  The  legislature  hereby
 finds that the state requires a comprehensive approach to science, tech-
 nology,  engineering,  and  math  education  (STEM).  Under current law,
 little to no incentives or programmatic  funding  exists  to  push  STEM
 education  forward.  The legislature further finds it essential to bring
 back business and industry in STEM education programs  by  getting  them
 involved  for  career development. Furthermore, the legislature finds it
 questionable whether current curriculum focuses on the adequate areas to
 provide children with the standards needed to fulfill a math or  science
 job opportunity in the future.
  Therefore  be  it  resolved that the legislature intends to mirror the
 federal efforts underway to promote STEM and enable New York students to
 compete internationally in educational  fields  that  drive  the  global
 economy and to provide the appropriate funding for STEM programs.
  §  2.  Section  669-e of the education law, as amended by section 1 of
 part BB of chapter 56 of the laws of 2018, subdivision 1 as  amended  by
 chapter 329 of the laws of 2018, is amended to read as follows:
  § 669-e. New York state science, technology, engineering and mathemat-
 ics incentive program. 1. Undergraduate students who are matriculated in
 an  approved  undergraduate  program  leading  to  a  career in science,
 COMPUTER SCIENCE, technology, engineering, INCLUDING DESIGN  SKILLS  AND
 PRACTICE, or mathematics at a New York state public institution of high-
 er  education  for  the purpose of subdivision two of this section, or a
 New York state private degree granting institution of  higher  education
 for  the purpose of subdivision two-a of this section, shall be eligible

 from  a  high  school  located in New York state during or after the two
 thousand thirteen--fourteen school year; and (b)  graduates  within  the
 top  ten  percent  of  his  or her high school class; and (c) enrolls in
 full-time study each term beginning in the fall term after  his  or  her
 high  school graduation in an approved undergraduate program in science,
 COMPUTER SCIENCE, technology, engineering, INCLUDING DESIGN  SKILLS  AND
 PRACTICE,  or  mathematics, as defined by the corporation, at a New York
 state institution of higher education; and (d) signs a contract with the
 corporation agreeing that his or  her  award  will  be  converted  to  a
 student  loan in the event the student fails to comply with the terms of
 this program as set forth in subdivision four of this section;  and  (e)
 complies with the applicable provisions of this article and all require-
 ments  promulgated  by  the  corporation  for  the administration of the
 program.
  2. Awards shall be granted beginning with the two thousand  fourteen--
 two  thousand  fifteen academic year and thereafter to applicants at New

 ate tuition for residents of New York state charged by the state univer-
 sity of New York or actual tuition charged, whichever is less; provided,
 however,  (i)  a student who receives educational grants and/or scholar-
 ships that cover the student's full cost  of  attendance  shall  not  be
 eligible  for  an  award  under  this  program;  (ii)  for a student who
 receives educational grants and/or scholarships that cover less than the
 student's full cost of attendance, such grants and/or scholarships shall
 not be deemed duplicative of this program and may be  held  concurrently
 with an award under this program, provided that the combined benefits do
 not  exceed  the  student's  full cost of attendance; and (iii) an award
 under this program shall be applied to tuition after the application  of
 all  other  educational  grants  and scholarships limited to tuition and
 shall be reduced in an amount equal to such  educational  grants  and/or
 scholarships.  Upon  notification  of  an  award under this program, the
 institution shall defer the amount of tuition equal  to  the  award.  No
 award  shall  be  final until the recipient's successful completion of a
 term has been certified by the institution.
  2-a. Within amounts appropriated therefor and based on availability of
 funds, beginning with the two thousand eighteen--two  thousand  nineteen
 academic  year  and thereafter, awards shall be granted to applicants at
 New York state private degree granting institutions of higher  education
 that the corporation has determined are eligible to receive such awards.
 The corporation shall grant such awards in an amount equal to the amount
 of  undergraduate tuition for residents of New York state charged by the
 state university of New York or actual  tuition  charged,  whichever  is
 less;  provided,  however, (i) a student who receives educational grants
 and/or scholarships that cover the student's  full  cost  of  attendance
 shall  not  be  eligible  for  an  award  under this program; (ii) for a
 student who receives educational grants and/or scholarships  that  cover
 less  than  the  student's  full  cost of attendance, such grants and/or
 scholarships shall not be deemed duplicative of this program and may  be
 held  concurrently  with  an award under this program, provided that the
 combined benefits do not exceed the student's full cost  of  attendance;
 and  (iii) an award under this program shall be applied to tuition after
 the application of all other educational grants and scholarships limited
 to tuition and shall be reduced in an amount equal to  such  educational

 grants  and/or  scholarships.  Upon  notification of an award under this
 program, the institution shall defer the amount of tuition equal to  the
 award.  No  award  shall  be  final  until  the  recipient's  successful
 completion of a term has been certified by the institution.
  3. An eligible recipient shall not receive an award for more than four
 academic  years  of full-time undergraduate study or five academic years
 if the program of study normally  requires  five  years,  excluding  any
 allowable interruption of study.
  4.  The corporation shall convert to a student loan the full amount of
 the award given pursuant to this section, plus interest, according to  a
 schedule  to  be determined by the corporation if: (a) a recipient fails

 other  than  in  science,  COMPUTER  SCIENCE,  technology,  engineering,
 INCLUDING DESIGN SKILLS  AND  PRACTICE,  or  mathematics;  or  (b)  upon
 completion  of  such  undergraduate  degree program a recipient fails to

 approved undergraduate program in science, COMPUTER SCIENCE, technology,
 engineering, INCLUDING DESIGN SKILLS AND PRACTICE,  or  mathematics  and
 enroll  on  at  least  a  half-time basis in a graduate or higher degree
 program or other professional licensure degree program  until  they  are
 conferred  a  degree, and shall also be deferred for any interruption in
 undergraduate study or employment as established by the rules and  regu-
 lations of the corporation. The terms and conditions of this subdivision
 may also be deferred for a grace period, to be established by the corpo-
 ration, following the completion of an approved undergraduate program in
 science,  COMPUTER  SCIENCE,  technology,  engineering, INCLUDING DESIGN
 SKILLS AND PRACTICE, or mathematics a graduate or higher degree  program
 or other professional licensure degree program. Any obligation to comply
