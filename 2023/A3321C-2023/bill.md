 AN ACT to amend the labor law, in relation to regulating the temperature
  of all indoor and outdoor worksites
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited  as  the  "temper-
 ature extreme mitigation program (TEMP) act".
  § 2. Legislative findings and intent. The legislature hereby finds and
 declares that New Yorkers, working both in outdoor and indoor sites, are
 exposed  to  extreme  temperatures  due to climate change. This involves
 both skyrocketing heat in the summer and freezing cold  in  the  winter.
 Every  year,  New  York  city has high numbers of heat-related emergency
 department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths. According to the New
 York City Office of the Mayor, each year  there  are  an  estimated  450
 heat-related  ED  visits, 150 heat-related hospital admissions, 10 heat-
 stroke deaths, and 350 heat-exacerbated deaths, caused by heat worsening
 existing chronic conditions.
  Further, cold stress injuries have proven to  be  a  concern  for  New
 York's  workers. In 2018 in the United States, there were 2,890 cases of
 ice, sleet, and snow injuries; 14% of those were in  the  state  of  New
 York (BLS). In 2018 in New York state, 50 injuries were related to expo-
 sure  to environmental cold. All 50 of those injuries were cases involv-
 ing 31 or more days of missed work (BLS).
  The legislature hereby finds and declares that the government is obli-
 gated to ensure that employers provide safe conditions for their employ-
 ees.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
