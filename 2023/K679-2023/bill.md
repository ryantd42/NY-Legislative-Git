  Yankees staff
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to acknowledge the
significant  milestones  in  the  distinguished  careers  of  esteemed
residents of this noble Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
congratulate Ray Negron upon the occasion of celebrating 50 years  as  a
member of the New York Yankees staff; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ray Negron's extraordinary story began when he was 17 years
old  and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner offered him a job as
a batboy after he was caught spray painting a wall  at  Yankee  Stadium;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This second chance gave Ray Negron the opportunity to spend
the  next  five  decades  as  a part of the famed baseball franchise and
share his story with others; and
 
  WHEREAS, Committed to  his  community,  Ray  Negron  has  worked  to
facilitate  hospital visits by Yankee players to terminally ill children
and co-founded "Hank's Yanks" with Hank Steinbrenner, a not  for  profit
youth travel baseball team for underprivileged children; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Through  his  writing,  Ray  Negron  has continued to be a
positive influence on children, publishing several children's books that
have been featured on best seller lists and  in  the  National  Baseball
Hall  of  Fame,  including the 2006 International Children's Book of the
Year "The Boy of Steel," "The Greatest Story Never Told:  The  Babe  and
Jackie,"  "One  Last  Time:  Goodbye  to  Yankee  Stadium,"  and "Yankee
Miracles: Life with the Boss and the Bronx Bombers"; and
 
  WHEREAS, In recognition of  his  impact  on  his  community  and  on
baseball,  Ray Negron has been included as a member of the International
Latino Hall of Fame, the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Hall  of  Fame,  the
Ted Williams Hall of Fame, the New York State Baseball Hall of Fame, and
has been honored by the Department of Homeland Security; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body that when
individuals of such noble aims and accomplishments are  brought  to  our
attention,  they should be celebrated and recognized by all the citizens
of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  Ray  Negron upon the occasion of celebrating 50 years as a
member of the New York Yankees staff; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
