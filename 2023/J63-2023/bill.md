  memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim
  January 2023, as Motivation and Inspiration Month in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, Throughout history motivation and inspiration  have  played
important  roles  in  the greatest achievements of civilized society and
are characteristics common to all great leaders; and
 
  WHEREAS, People of all ages require motivation  and  inspiration  in
their daily lives and to help them achieve success and happiness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The inspiration to define goals at school, home, and work,
and the motivation to achieve those  goals,  is  critical  to  achieving
success and happiness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Children  and  young  adults  particularly need mentors to
inspire them to achieve their goals and to motivate them to direct their
energies toward positive and constructive activities and goals; and
 
  WHEREAS, Adults who mentor children and young adults become inspired
and motivated themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  renewed  focus  on  motivation  and  inspiration  was
particularly  important  during  the  aftermath  of  the  September 11th
Terrorist attacks, and today more then ever; and
 
  WHEREAS, H.R. 308, passed on December 18, 2001, expressed the  sense
of the United States House of Representatives that a National Motivation
and  Inspiration  Day  should be established and observed each year with
appropriate programs and activities; and
 
  WHEREAS, In keeping with the intent and recognition of the  benefits
of  such  observance,  the establishment of a Motivation and Inspiration
Month in the State of New York would  provide  an  opportunity  for  the
citizens  and  leaders  of our great State to focus on the importance of
maintaining motivation and inspiration in their lives and in  the  lives
of others; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  the  beginning  of  the  year  is often a period of
reflection, planning, and goal setting, January is the appropriate  time
to celebrate Motivation and Inspiration Month; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  January  2023,  as
Motivation  and  Inspiration  Month  in the State of New York; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
