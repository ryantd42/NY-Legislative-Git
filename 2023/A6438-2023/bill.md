 OCCURS  ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CHAPTER OF THE LAWS OF TWO
 THOUSAND TWENTY-THREE THAT ADDED THIS SECTION, THE BENEFICIARY OR  BENE-
 FICIARIES  MAY  ELECT TO RECEIVE, IN A LUMP SUM, AN AMOUNT PAYABLE WHICH
 SHALL  BE  EQUAL TO THE PENSION RESERVE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED

  §  3.  All  past  service  costs  associated  with  implementing  the

  § 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,  none
 of  the  provisions  of  this  act shall be subject to the appropriation
 requirement of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.

  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would modify the in-service death  benefit  for  Westchester
 County  correction  officers  in Tiers 2 through 6. The in-service death
 benefit will be the value of the pension reserve as if  the  member  had
 retired on their date of death.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $110,000 in the
 annual contributions of Westchester County for the  fiscal  year  ending
 March  31,  2024.  In  future  years, this cost will vary as the billing
 rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $812,000 which  will  be
 borne by Westchester County as a one-time payment. This estimate assumes
 that  payment  will  be  made on February 1, 2024. If Westchester County
 elects to amortize this cost over a 10-year period,  the  cost  for  the
 first year including interest would be $104,000.
  These  estimated  costs  are based on 821 affected members employed by
 Westchester County, with annual salary of approximately $103 million  as
 of March 31, 2022.
