  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 22-28, 2023, as Period Poverty Awareness Week in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  call  for
awareness to Period Poverty, which affects women and girl's daily lives,
because  they  are  unable to afford the material basic necessities they
require to thrive; and
 
  WHEREAS, Approximately half of the population  will  have  a  period
every  month  for decades of their lives, and therefore, period supplies
are a necessary product, each month, for millions of people  across  the
country; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the intent of this Legislative  Body  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 22-28, 2023, as Period
Poverty Awareness Week in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS,  One  in  four  women  and  girls struggle to secure enough
period supplies to meet their needs each month due to a lack of  income;
this  lack  of  period  supplies, known as period poverty, can adversely
affect the health and well-being of menstruators; and
 
  WHEREAS, In addition, one in five  women  and  girls  miss  work  or
school  due  to a lack of a sufficient amount of period supplies; period
poverty exacerbates the vicious cycle of poverty by forcing menstruators
to  withdraw  from  daily  life,  losing  pay,  or  missing  educational
opportunities; and
 
  WHEREAS, New York State recognizes the importance of period products
to  ensure  a  healthy  life and that period poverty is a serious public
health issue; and
 
  WHEREAS, Addressing period poverty can lead to economic  opportunity
for  the  State's  people and communities, and improved health for women
and all menstruators; thus ensuring all people have access to the  basic
necessities  required  to  thrive  and  reach their full potential; now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 22-28, 2023, as Period
Poverty Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
