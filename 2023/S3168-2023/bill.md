 Introduced  by  Sen.  CLEARE -- read twice and ordered printed, and when
  printed to be committed to the Committee on Agriculture
 
 AN ACT to amend the agriculture and markets law, in relation to  requir-
  ing the department of agriculture and markets to facilitate and expand
  an  initiative  to promote opportunities for farm ownership to farmers
  who are black, indigenous and people of color
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent and findings. The legislature finds that
 black, indigenous and people of color farmers make up approximately 2.1%
 of  all farmers in New York state. Using data from the 2017 census, that
 means that only 1,228 out of 57,865 farmers were black, indigenous,  and
 people  of  color.  It is the intent of the legislature to diversify the
 profession of farming within the state and to encourage  black,  indige-
 nous, and people of color to pursue farm ownership.
  §  2.  Section  16  of  the  agriculture and markets law is amended by
 adding a new subdivision 53 to read as follows:
  53. FACILITATE AND EXPAND, WITH FINANCIAL AND  TECHNICAL  SUPPORT,  AN
 INITIATIVE  TO  PROMOTE  OPPORTUNITIES FOR FARM OWNERSHIP TO FARMERS WHO
 ARE BLACK, INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE DEPARTMENT SHALL  PROMOTE
 A CONSISTENT DEMAND OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM FARMERS WHO ARE BLACK,
 INDIGENOUS,  AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND RE-ESTABLISH OPPORTUNITIES FOR FARM
 OWNERSHIP FOR SUCH FARMERS. A REPORT SHALL BE PROVIDED ANNUALLY  TO  THE
 GOVERNOR  AND  THE  LEGISLATURE DETAILING INFORMATION INCLUDING, BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF INITIATIVES UNDERTAKEN, THE FUNDING  DISTRIBUTED
 BY  REGION,  THE  PERCENTAGE  OF  FARMS  OWNED BY FARMERS WHO ARE BLACK,
 INDIGENOUS, AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BY  REGION,  AND  THE  VARIOUS  PRODUCTS
 DISTRIBUTED TO AND FROM EACH REGION.
  §  3.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law.
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.
