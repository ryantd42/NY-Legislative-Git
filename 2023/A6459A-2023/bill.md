  1. Upon the request of a victim of a crime, or in  any  event  in  all
 cases  in which the final disposition includes a conviction of a violent
 felony offense as defined in section 70.02 of the penal  law,  a  felony
 defined  in  article  one  hundred  twenty-five of such law, or a felony
 defined in article one hundred thirty of such law, the district attorney
 shall,  within  sixty  days of the final disposition of the case, inform
 the victim by letter of such final disposition. If such  final  disposi-
 tion  results  in  the commitment of the defendant to the custody of the
 department of corrections and community supervision for an indeterminate
 OR COMBINED sentence, the notice provided to the crime victim shall also
 inform the victim of his or her right to submit a  written,  audiotaped,
 or [videotaped] VIDEO RECORDED victim impact statement to the department
 of  corrections  and  community  supervision  or to meet [personally] IN
 PERSON OR BY VIDEO CONFERENCE with a member of the state board of parole
 at a time and place separate  from  the  personal  interview  between  a
 member  or members of the board and the incarcerated individual and make
 such a statement, subject to procedures  and  limitations  contained  in
 rules  of  the  board,  both  pursuant to subdivision two of section two
 hundred fifty-nine-i of the executive law. A  copy  of  such  letter  OR
 STATEMENT  shall  be  provided  to the board of parole AND ALL PRESIDING
 COMMISSIONERS FOR SUCH HEARING. The  right  of  the  victim  under  this
 subdivision  to submit a [written] victim impact statement IN ANY FORMAT
 or to meet [personally] IN PERSON OR BY VIDEO CONFERENCE with  a  member
 of  the state board of parole applies to each personal interview between
 a member or members of the board and the incarcerated individual.

 adding a new paragraph (f) to read as follows:
  (F) PRIOR TO THE CONDUCT OF ANY PAROLE HEARING  AS  PROVIDED  IN  THIS
 ARTICLE,  THE  MEMBERS  OF THE BOARD AND ALL PRESIDING COMMISSIONERS FOR
 SUCH HEARING SHALL REVIEW ALL VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS RELATING  TO  THE
 OFFENSE  OR  OFFENSES  OF  WHICH  THE  INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN
 CONVICTED, INCLUDING VICTIM IMPACT  STATEMENTS  PROVIDED  IN  CONNECTION
 WITH  THE  PRE-SENTENCING  REPORT  AND VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS PROVIDED
 DIRECTLY TO THE PAROLE BOARD.  FAILURE TO REVIEW STATEMENTS AS  PROVIDED
 IN THIS SECTION SHALL RENDER SUCH HEARING INVALID.
  §  4.  This  act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall
 have become a law. Effective immediately the addition, amendment  and/or
 repeal  of  any  rule  or regulation necessary for the implementation of
 this act on its effective date are authorized to be made  and  completed
