 the state;
  c. the effect of airport improvement and  revitalization  projects  on
 investment in general aviation operations within the state;

 within the state as opposed to other states and its impact on investment
 in general aviation services; and
  e. measures other  states  or  countries  have  taken  to  incentivize
 investment in general aviation services.
