  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
pay  tribute  to  those  enduring  organizations  which  devote  their
purposeful energies to improving the quality  and  dignity  of  life  of
those  they  serve, to preserving their heritage, and to fostering pride
among them; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the  New  Rochelle  Branch  of  the
NAACP; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  National  Association  for the Advancement of Colored
People  (NAACP)  remains  an  important  and  vital  progressive  voice,
focusing  on  major  civil  and  human  rights  priorities  including
strengthening  access  to  quality  education,  improving  health  and
environmental  justice  outcomes,  building  economic  opportunity  and
security, advancing criminal justice  reform,  and  promoting  political
representation and civic participation; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  mission  of the NAACP is to ensure a society in which
all individuals have equal rights without discrimination based on  race;
and
 
  WHEREAS, The New Rochelle Branch of the NAACP was organized in 1923,
largely  through  the  efforts  of  Annie  Lucille Alleyne, wife of Rev.
Cameron C. Allenyne, pastor  of  St.  Catherine  AME  Zion  Church,  and
assisted  by  her  good  friend,  Walter  White, just 14 years after the
National Association was created; as with so many  NAACP  branches,  the
New Rochelle Branch was organized in a church - Bethesda Baptist Church,
and Annie Lucille Alleyne became the temporary chairperson; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Branch  of the NAACP focuses on education, political
leadership, membership, technology, and housing; and
 
  WHEREAS, One of the  notable  events  in  the  history  of  the  New
Rochelle Branch of the NAACP includes continuing the fight to retain the
only minority city council district in New Rochelle; and

Mark McLean; 1st Vice President, Aisha Cook; 2nd Vice President,  Judith
Henry;  3rd  Vice  President,  Dr.  Jonathan Williams; Secretary, Denise

have  made the New Rochelle Branch of the NAACP one of the leading civil
rights groups in New York State; and

Esq.;  Jennifer  Minto-Hinton; Stephine Bartee; Sonya Spady; Mary Smith;
Patricia Gilmore; Luetwinder Savage; Dorothy Oliver;  Valerie  Williams;
 
and  Dr. Carla H. Woolbright, whose involvement is, and always has been,
characterized by an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm,  and
an  uncompromising  standard of excellence in all endeavors on behalf of
the organization and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  New  Rochelle  Branch  of  the  NAACP is committed to
helping find durable solutions to the  multiple  challenges  facing  its
communities;  the history of the NAACP has shown that freedom comes with
a price, a price they are willing to  pay,  serving  as  a  vanguard  to
ensure justice and equality for all; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the  New  Rochelle  Branch  of  the
NAACP; and be it further
