  Section  1. Section 457 of the family court act, as amended by chapter

  § 457. Order of sequestration on failure to obey support order. If  an
 order  of  support  is  made  under  this article and the respondent has
 failed to obey it [and either leaves or threatens to leave  the  state],
 the  court  on application may issue an order of sequestration of his OR
 HER property within the state,  providing  that  such  property  may  be
 taken,  sequestered and applied in like manner as is provided in section

  § 2. Section 429 of the family court act, as amended by chapter 281 of
 the laws of 1980, is amended to read as follows:
  § 429. Sequestration of respondent's property. [Where in a  proceeding
 under  this  article  it appears to the court that the respondent is not

 or herself therein, so that process cannot be personally served upon the
 respondent,  the]  THE  court may at any time and from time to time make
 any order or orders without notice directing the sequestration  of  [his

 tangible or intangible, within the state, and  may  appoint  a  receiver
 thereof, or by injunction or otherwise take the same into its possession
 and  control. The property thus sequestered and the income therefrom may
 be applied in whole or in part and from time to time, under  the  direc-
 tion of the court and as justice may require, to the payment of such sum
 or  sums  as the court may deem it proper to award, by order, and during
 the pendency of the proceeding or at the termination  thereof,  for  the

 SUPPORT,  education  or  maintenance of any of the RESPONDENT'S children
 [of a marriage], or for the support of a  spouse,  or  for  his  or  her
 expenses  in  bringing and carrying on said proceeding; and if the rents
 and  profits  of  the  real  estate, together with the other property so
 sequestered, be insufficient to pay the  sums  of  money  required,  the
 court,  upon  such  terms and conditions as it may prescribe, may direct
 the mortgage or sale of sufficient of said real estate to pay such sums.
 The court may appoint the petitioning [spouse] PARTY receiver or seques-
 trator in such cases. [The court may authorize such spouse  to  use  and
 occupy,  free  of any liability for rent or use and occupation or other-
 wise, any house or other suitable property of the respondent spouse as a
 dwelling for himself or herself with or  without  the  children  of  the
 marriage,  and  may likewise turn over to the petitioning spouse for the
 use of such spouse with or without the  children  of  the  marriage  any
 chattel  or  chattels  of  the  respondent  spouse.]  The  relief herein
 provided for is in addition to any and every other  remedy  to  which  a
 spouse may be entitled under the law.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
