  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would amend the Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) as
 follows:
 A. 7689  3
 
  1) Add the titles of investigator and sworn officer  employed  by  the
 commission  created  by  Section six of Chapter 882 of the Laws of 1953,
 constituting the Waterfront Commission Act, to the definition of member-
 ship in Section 381-b,
  2)  Allow service rendered as an investigator, investigator-trainee or
 sworn officer of the Waterfront Commission of  New  York  Harbor  to  be
 creditable under Section 381-b, and
  3)  Add the titles of investigator and sworn officer of the Waterfront
 Commission of New York Harbor to  the  definition  of  "police  or  fire
 service" as defined in Section 302.
  Additionally,  this  bill  would  amend  the Criminal Procedure Law by
 adding the titles of investigator and sworn officer  of  the  Waterfront
 Commission  of  New  York  Harbor  to the definition of "police officer"
 under Section 1.20.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate that there will be an increase of  approximately  $29,000  in  the
 annual  contributions  of  the  State of New York. This estimate assumes
 that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $979,000 which  will  be
 borne  by the State of New York and all local participating employers in
 the NYSLPFRS. This estimate assumes that payment will be made on  Febru-
 ary 1, 2024.
  These  estimated costs are based on eight affected members employed by
 the Waterfront Commission of New York  Harbor,  with  annual  salary  of
 approximately $950,000 as of March 31, 2022.
  Along  with  the  direct  costs quoted above, insofar as this proposal
 allows certain previous service rendered as an investigator,  investiga-
 tor-trainee  or  sworn  officer of the Waterfront Commission of New York
 Harbor to be newly creditable under Section 381-b  of  the  RSSL,  addi-
 tional  past  service  costs  could arise for the current New York State
 Troopers covered by that section. It is estimated that such past service
 cost will be 25% of an affected member's compensation for each  year  of
 service that is newly credited pursuant to this legislation.
