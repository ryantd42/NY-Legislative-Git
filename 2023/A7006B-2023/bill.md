 AN  ACT  in  relation to authorizing Congregation Khal Bais Usher/RSK to
  receive retroactive real property tax exempt status
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  assessor  of  the county of Rockland is hereby authorized to accept
 from Congregation Khal Bais Usher/RSK an application for exemption  from
 real  property  taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real property tax
 law with respect to the 2021-2022  assessment  rolls  with  such  parcel
 being  located  at  68  Highview  Road, in the hamlet of Monsey, town of
 Ramapo otherwise known as Rockland county tax map section  56.06,  block
 1,  lot  15. If accepted, the application shall be reviewed as if it had
 been received on or before the taxable status dates established for such
 rolls.
  If satisfied that such organization would  otherwise  be  entitled  to
 such  exemption  if  such organization had acquired the subject property
 and filed an application for exemption by the appropriate taxable status
 date, the assessor, upon approval by the  Rockland  county  legislature,
 may  grant  exemption from all taxation and make appropriate corrections
 to the subject rolls. If such exemption is granted and such organization
 therefore shall have paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the
 governing body or tax department may, in its  sole  discretion,  provide
 for  the  refund of those taxes paid and cancel any taxes, fines, penal-
 ties, interest or tax liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
