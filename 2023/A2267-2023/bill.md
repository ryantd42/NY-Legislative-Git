  §  202-L-1.  RIGHT OF VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS TO BE ABSENT FROM EMPLOY-
 MENT FOR TRAINING. 1. ANY EMPLOYEE WHO IS A  VOLUNTEER  FIREFIGHTER  AND
 WHO NOTIFIES HIS OR HER EMPLOYER TO THAT EFFECT AT LEAST TWO WEEKS PRIOR
 TO  TAKING  A  LEAVE  FOR  FIREFIGHTER TRAINING SHALL NOT, ON ACCOUNT OF
 ABSENCE FROM EMPLOYMENT BY  REASON  OF  SUCH  TRAINING,  BE  SUBJECT  TO
 DISCHARGE  OR  PENALTY. AN EMPLOYER SHALL NOT WITHHOLD WAGES OF ANY SUCH
 EMPLOYEE DURING THE PERIOD OF SUCH TRAINING.
  2. SUBDIVISION ONE OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY ONLY WHEN:
  (A) THE EMPLOYER HAS PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED  WRITTEN  DOCUMENTATION  FROM
 THE  HEAD  OF  THE  EMPLOYEE'S  VOLUNTEER  FIRE DEPARTMENT NOTIFYING THE
 EMPLOYER OF THE EMPLOYEE'S STATUS AS A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER; AND
  (B) THE EMPLOYEE'S TRAINING IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO BEING  A  VOLUNTEER
 FIREFIGHTER AND IS REQUIRED UNDER 19 NYCRR 426.
  3. THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF THE AUTHORIZED LEAVE OF ABSENCE GRANTED PURSU-
 ANT  TO  THIS SECTION, UP TO THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF TRAINING HOURS SHALL
 BE PAID LEAVE FOR EMPLOYEES AND SHALL NOT BE CHARGED AGAINST  ANY  LEAVE

 INCLUDE MORE HOURS OF TRAINING THAN BASIC VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER TRAINING

 TRAINING.

 ty within the several fire districts the amounts to be raised by tax for
 the  purposes  of  the  respective districts as specified in such annual
 fire district budget and shall cause the amount so assessed  and  levied
 to be collected, in the same manner and at the same time and by the same
 officers  as  town  taxes  are assessed, levied and collected. When such
 taxes are collected, the amount thereof shall be paid to the  supervisor
 of  the town and by him immediately paid to the treasurer of the respec-
 tive fire districts.  If  a  fire  district  includes  taxable  property

 tioned in accordance with section eight hundred six of the real property
