 Introduced by Sens. MANNION, GALLIVAN -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and when printed to be committed to the Committee on Civil Service and
  Pensions
 
 AN  ACT  to amend the retirement and social security law, in relation to
  enacting the "police and fire employees retention act"

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as
 the "police and fire employees retention act".
  § 2. Legislative findings. Over  the  past  several  years,  increased
 workloads  on  our  police  and  fire employees throughout the state has
 resulted in a large reduction in personnel resources due  to  retirement
 and  separation  from  service.  The  loss  of  talented and experienced
 personnel in these important job titles further results in a  structural
 deficit  of  experienced  trainers  for our next generation of dedicated
 police and fire personnel actively entering their public service  lives.
 This  legislation  seeks to induce talented and experienced personnel to
 remain in service to the public while allowing their pension payments to
 be deferred during a specific period of time while they continue employ-
 ment.
  § 3. The retirement and social security law is amended by adding a new
 section 381-c to read as follows:
  § 381-C.  DEFERRED  RETIREMENT  OPTION  PLAN  PAYABLE  TO  MEMBERS  OF
 OPTIONAL TWENTY-YEAR RETIREMENT PLAN. A PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER WHICH HAS
 ELECTED OR WHICH ELECTS, PURSUANT TO SECTION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-ONE OR
 ANY  SECTIONS  UNDER  THIS  ARTICLE,  WHO  PARTICIPATES IN A TWENTY-YEAR
 RETIREMENT PLAN MAY PROVIDE FOR A DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN.
  A. DEFERRED  RETIREMENT  OPTION  PLAN,  (HEREINAFTER  REFERRED  TO  AS
 "DROP"),  IS  A  RETIREMENT  PLAN  UNDER  WHICH  AN ELIGIBLE MEMBER OF A
 PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER MAY ELECT TO PARTICIPATE,  DEFERRING  RECEIPT  OF
 RETIREMENT  BENEFITS  WHILE  CONTINUING  EMPLOYMENT. FOR THE PURPOSES OF
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 S. 6484  2
 
 THIS SECTION, AN "ELIGIBLE MEMBER" IS ANY MEMBER OR OFFICER EMPLOYED  BY
 THE  STATE,  LOCAL,  MUNICIPAL,  COUNTY,  VILLAGE, AUTHORITY OR DIVISION
 WITHIN THE STATE ELECTING TO PROVIDE THIS OPTION. DURING THE  PERIOD  OF
 CONTINUED  EMPLOYMENT,  THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER'S MONTHLY RETIREMENT BENEFIT
 SHALL BE DEFERRED AND HELD BY THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM  ON  BEHALF  OF  THE
 MEMBER  PLUS  INTEREST  AT AN EFFECTIVE RATE OF ONE AND ONE-HALF PERCENT
 FOR THE SPECIFIC PERIOD OF PARTICIPATION IN DROP AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVI-
 SION C OF THIS SECTION. UPON COMPLETION OF THE DROP PERIOD, THE ELIGIBLE
 MEMBER SHALL RECEIVE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF  RETIREMENT  BENEFITS  DEFERRED
 UNDER  DROP WITHOUT OPTIONAL MODIFICATION AS PERMITTED BY SUBDIVISIONS D
 AND E OF THIS SECTION AND SHALL BEGIN TO RECEIVE THE  PREVIOUSLY  DETER-
 MINED  NORMAL  SERVICE  RETIREMENT BENEFIT WITH OPTIONAL MODIFICATION AS
 FURTHER PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION D OF THIS SECTION.
  B. ANY ELIGIBLE MEMBER WHO IS CURRENTLY EMPLOYED  BY  A  PARTICIPATING
 EMPLOYER ELECTING TO PARTICIPATE UNDER THIS ARTICLE AND WHO QUALIFIES TO
 RETIRE  PURSUANT  TO  THIS TITLE BY REASON OF COMPLETING TWENTY YEARS OF
 CREDITABLE SERVICE MAY ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN DROP.
  C. SUCH ELECTION MUST BE ON A FORM SUPPLIED BY THE  RETIREMENT  SYSTEM
 AND  MAY  BE  FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME NOT LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS OR MORE
 THAN SIXTY MONTHS DURATION. ANY ELIGIBLE MEMBER WHO  ELECTS  TO  PARTIC-
 IPATE  IN DROP IS CONSIDERED RETIRED ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION
 OF THE DROP  PERIOD.  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  THAT  ALL  LOANS  AND  EXCESS
 CONTRIBUTIONS  MUST  BE  RESOLVED  BY THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO DROP AND NO
 ADDITIONAL LOANS OR EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE  PERMITTED  AFTER  THE
 DATE  OF ENTRY INTO DROP. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE TIME PERIOD SELECTED BY
 THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER, SUCH MEMBER'S PARTICIPATION IN  DROP  SHALL  TERMI-
 NATE.
  D.  (1) EFFECTIVE WITH THE DATE OF PARTICIPATION IN DROP, THE ELIGIBLE
 MEMBER'S NORMAL SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT SHALL  BE  CALCULATED,  USING
 CREDITABLE  SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE SALARY AS IF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
 RETIREMENT WAS THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO DROP. THE AMOUNT DEFERRED PURSUANT
 TO DROP SHALL BE CALCULATED BASED UPON THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER'S ZERO OPTION
 RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE UNTIL SUCH MEMBER HAS OBTAINED THE APPLICABLE MAXI-
 MUM SERVICE RETIREMENT LIMIT BASED UPON YEARS OF SERVICE. ANY ADDITIONAL
 PARTICIPATION IN DROP AFTER A MEMBER HAS OBTAINED  THE  MAXIMUM  SERVICE
 RETIREMENT  LIMIT  BASED UPON YEARS OF SERVICE SHALL BE CALCULATED BASED
 UPON SIXTY PERCENT OF THE MEMBER'S FULL ANNUAL RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE.  IN
 ADDITION, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE ANNUAL RETIREMENT ALLOW-
 ANCE FOR ANY MEMBER ELECTING DROP SHALL BE CALCULATED USING A THREE-YEAR
 FINAL  AVERAGE SALARY AS DEFINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ARTICLE. THE ELIGIBLE
 MEMBER SHALL, HOWEVER, ELECT HIS OR HER OPTIONAL RETIREMENT  BENEFIT  AT
 THE COMPLETION OF THE DROP PERIOD.
  (2)  IF  THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER DIES PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE PERIOD OF
 PARTICIPATION IN DROP, THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER SHALL BE TREATED AS  IF  SUCH
 DROP  ELECTION DID NOT EXIST. IN LIEU OF THE DROP PAYMENT, A DEATH BENE-
 FIT SHALL BE PAYABLE CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS OF THIS CHAPTER  AND  ALL
 SALARY  AND  SERVICE  REPORTED  FOR SUCH ELIGIBLE MEMBER DURING THE DROP
 PERIOD SHALL BE CONSIDERED IN CALCULATING THE  ELIGIBLE  MEMBER'S  DEATH
 BENEFIT.
  (3)  IF  THE  ELIGIBLE  MEMBER  IS  APPROVED  FOR  DISABILITY BENEFITS
 PROVIDED IN THIS CHAPTER DURING THE DROP  PERIOD,  THE  ELIGIBLE  MEMBER
 SHALL  BE  TREATED AS IF THE DROP ELECTION DID NOT EXIST. IN LIEU OF THE
 DROP PAYMENT, A DISABILITY RETIREMENT BENEFIT SHALL BE PAYABLE  CONSIST-
 ENT  WITH  THE TERMS OF THIS CHAPTER AND ALL SALARY AND SERVICE REPORTED
 FOR SUCH ELIGIBLE MEMBER DURING THE DROP PERIOD SHALL BE  CONSIDERED  IN
 CALCULATING THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER'S DISABILITY RETIREMENT BENEFIT.
 S. 6484  3
 
  (4) IF AN ELIGIBLE MEMBER OTHERWISE FAILS TO COMPLETE HIS OR HER PERI-
 OD  OF SERVICE AS ELECTED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION C OF THIS SECTION, THE
 ELIGIBLE MEMBER SHALL BE TREATED AS IF SUCH DROP ELECTION DID NOT EXIST.
 IN LIEU OF THE DROP PAYMENT, THE NORMAL SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFIT SHALL
 BE  PAYABLE CONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS OF THIS CHAPTER AND ALL SALARY AND
 SERVICE REPORTED FOR SUCH ELIGIBLE MEMBER DURING THE DROP  PERIOD  SHALL
 BE  CONSIDERED  IN  CALCULATING THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER'S SERVICE RETIREMENT
 BENEFIT.
  (5) IF AN ELIGIBLE MEMBER REMAINS EMPLOYED AFTER HIS  OR  HER  PARTIC-
 IPATION  IN DROP IS TERMINATED, SUCH MEMBER SHALL FORFEIT ALL DROP BENE-
 FITS AND CONTINUE EMPLOYMENT AS IF SUCH DROP  ELECTION  DID  NOT  EXIST.
 SUCH  MEMBER  SHALL  THEN  BE ELIGIBLE TO ELECT DROP CONSISTENT WITH THE
 TERMS OF THIS SECTION.
  (6) IF AN ELIGIBLE MEMBER IS APPROVED FOR  DISABILITY  BENEFITS  AFTER
 BENEFITS  PAYABLE  PURSUANT  TO DROP HAVE BEEN PAID, THE ELIGIBLE MEMBER
 MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE THE DISABILITY BENEFITS IN LIEU OF  DROP  BENEFITS,
 BUT  SUCH DISABILITY BENEFITS MUST BE ACTUARIALLY ADJUSTED FOR ANY BENE-
 FITS PAID UNDER DROP.
  E. AT THE CONCLUSION  OF  THE  MEMBER'S  PARTICIPATION  IN  DROP,  THE
 RETIREMENT  SYSTEM SHALL PAY THE DEFERRED SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS IN
 ONE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS AS ELECTED BY THE MEMBER:
  (1) ALL ACCRUED DROP BENEFITS,  PLUS  INTEREST,  LESS  WITHHOLDING  AS
 REQUIRED  BY  THE  INTERNAL  REVENUE  SERVICE, SHALL BE PAID TO THE DROP
 PARTICIPANT OR ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY OR AS OTHERWISE DETERMINED BY OPERA-
 TION OF LAW;
  (2) ALL ACCRUED DROP BENEFITS, PLUS INTEREST, SHALL BE PAID  FROM  THE
 RETIREMENT  SYSTEM  TO  A  CUSTODIAN  OF THE ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN OR
 OTHER ELIGIBLE PLAN OR ACCOUNT AS  PROVIDED  PURSUANT  TO  THE  INTERNAL
 REVENUE CODE AS DIRECTED BY THE MEMBER OR ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY;
  (3)  A  PORTION OF THE DROP BENEFITS SHALL BE PAID TO THE DROP PARTIC-
 IPANT OR ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY, LESS WITHHOLDING REQUIRED BY THE INTERNAL
 REVENUE SERVICE AND THE REMAINING DROP BENEFITS MAY BE  ROLLED  OVER  AS
 OTHERWISE  PERMITTED  BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS
 SUBDIVISION, THE TERM "ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARY" IS  ONE  WHO  QUALIFIES  TO
 ROLLOVER  BENEFITS  FROM A QUALIFIED BENEFIT PLAN OR ACCOUNT AS PROVIDED
 BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
  THE DROP BENEFIT COST CONTAINED IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE  PAID  BY
 ANY  PARTICIPATING  EMPLOYER,  FOR ALL ELIGIBLE MEMBERS SPECIFIC TO SUCH
 EMPLOYER, THAT HAS ELECTED TO PROVIDE THIS BENEFIT.
  THE FORMS OF PAYMENT PROVIDED BY THIS SUBDIVISION MUST COMPLY WITH THE
 MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.
  F. THE COMPTROLLER SHALL PRESCRIBE SUCH REGULATIONS AS MAY BE REQUIRED
 FOR THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF
 THIS SECTION.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would allow employers in the New York State and Local Police
 and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS)  who  participate  in  twenty-year
 retirement  plans  to  provide their members with the option to elect to
 participate in a  Deferred  Retirement  Option  Plan  (DROP),  deferring
 receipt  of  retirement  benefits while continuing their current employ-
 ment.  The features of this DROP are:
  1. Members may elect to participate in the DROP upon the attainment of
 retirement eligibility.
  2. The service retirement benefit shall be the single  life  allowance
 determined  based  on  the  service  and  final  average  salary  at the
 S. 6484  4

 commencement of DROP  participation.  However,  once  a  member's  total
 service  credit  (including  service  during the DROP period) exceeds 32
 years, the monthly payment into the DROP account will be limited to  60%
 of the single life allowance.
  3.  The  NYSLPFRS shall consider DROP participants active members, and
 annual employer contributions shall continue to be made by  the  partic-
 ipating employers on behalf of such members.
  4.  The  length  of participation in the DROP must be specified at the
 time of election and may not be less than 1 year  nor  exceed  5  years.
 However,  if the affected member should leave employment before or after
 the scheduled DROP termination date, such member shall forfeit all  DROP
 benefits, and shall be treated as though there were no DROP election.
  5.  During  the  DROP  period,  the  monthly pensions of such affected
 members will be deferred and held by the NYSLPFRS on  their  behalf  and
 shall accrue interest at 1.5%. Such account, with interest accumulation,
 must be distributed in full at the end of the specified DROP period.
  6. If an affected member should die or become disabled during the DROP
 period,  such  member  shall  be  treated  as  though there were no DROP
 election.
  7. Upon termination from the DROP, such affected members shall receive
 their deferred payments, and shall also begin to receive their previous-
 ly determined pensions.
  Section 212 of  the  Retirement  and  Social  Security  Law  generally
 prevents  service  retirees from receiving salaries of more than $35,000
 for public employment before attaining age 65. This proposal would allow
 members to receive a full salary and retirement benefits  SIMULTANEOUSLY
 for up to 5 years.
  The  Partial  Lump  Sum  program  currently allows NYSLPFRS members to
 receive lump sums up to 25% of the present value of their  pensions.  In
 combination  with  this  proposal,  an affected member could potentially
 receive a lump sum exceeding 65% of the present value of their  pension.
 This  significantly  reduces  the value of ongoing pension payments over
 the member's remaining lifetime.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023  legislative  session,  it  is
 estimated  there  would be an increase in the annual contributions of an
 electing employer in the NYSLPFRS for the fiscal year ending  March  31,
 2024 of approximately:
  Retirement Plan  Increase in Annual
  Contributions
  20-year  5.0% of salary
 20-year with additional 60ths, non-State  2.5% of salary
 20-year with additional 60ths, State Police  1.4% of salary
  In  addition  to the annual contributions discussed above, there would
 be past service costs which would depend on the current salary, age, and
 length of service of the affected members. It is estimated that the past
 service cost per member of an electing employer  in  the  NYSLPFRS  that
 would  be  due  on February 1, 2024 for local employers or March 1, 2024
 for the State, would average approximately:
  Retirement Plan  Increase in Annual
  Contributions
  20-year  100% of salary
 20-year with additional 60ths, non-State  85% of salary
 20-year with additional 60ths, State Police  75% of salary
  If the anticipated retirement experience of members who  are  eligible
 for  this  benefit  changes  significantly in the future, there would be
 additional increases in employer costs.
