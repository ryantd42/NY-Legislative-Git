  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Section 2164 of the public health law, as amended by  chap-
 ter  401  of the laws of 2015, subdivision 6 as amended by chapter 35 of
 the laws of 2019, is amended to read as follows:
  §  2164.  Definitions;  immunization  against  poliomyelitis,  mumps,
 measles,  diphtheria,  rubella, varicella, Haemophilus influenzae type b
 (Hib), pertussis, tetanus, pneumococcal disease, meningococcal  disease,
 INFLUENZA VIRUS, and hepatitis B. 1. As used in this section, unless the
 context requires otherwise:
  a.  The  term "school" means and includes any public, private or paro-
 chial child caring center, day nursery, day care agency, nursery school,
 kindergarten, elementary, intermediate or secondary school.

 include  his  father  or  mother,  by  birth  or  adoption,  his legally
 appointed guardian, or his custodian. A person shall be regarded as  the
 custodian  of a child if he has assumed the charge and care of the child
 because the parents or legally appointed  guardian  of  the  minor  have
 died,  are  imprisoned,  are  mentally ill, or have been committed to an
 institution, or because they have abandoned or deserted  such  child  or
 are  living  outside the state or their whereabouts are unknown, or have
 designated the person pursuant to title fifteen-A of article five of the
 general obligations law as a person in parental relation to the child.
  d. The term "health practitioner" shall mean any person authorized  by
 law to administer an immunization.

 biological  products, and which is approved by the department under such
 conditions as may be specified by the public health council.

 or having entered seventh grade and twelfth grade or  a  comparable  age
 level  special  education  program  with an unassigned grade on or after
 September first, two thousand sixteen, shall have administered  to  such
 child an adequate dose or doses of immunizing agents against meningococ-
 cal  disease  as  recommended  by the advisory committee on immunization
 practices of the centers for disease control and prevention, which meets
 the standards approved by the United States public  health  service  for
 such  biological products, and which is approved by the department under
 such conditions as may be specified by the public  health  and  planning
 council.
  D. EVERY PERSON IN PARENTAL RELATION TO A CHILD IN THIS STATE ENTERING
 OR  HAVING ENTERED A LICENSED AND REGISTERED CHILD DAYCARE HOME, PROGRAM

 A. 1811  3

  6. In the event that a person in parental relation to  a  child  makes
 application  for  admission  of  such  child  to a school or has a child
 attending school and there exists no  certificate  or  other  acceptable
 evidence  of  the  child's  immunization  against  poliomyelitis, mumps,
 measles,  diphtheria,  rubella, varicella, hepatitis B, pertussis, teta-
 nus, and, where applicable, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib),  menin-
 gococcal disease, INFLUENZA VIRUS, and pneumococcal disease, the princi-
 pal,  teacher, owner or person in charge of the school shall inform such
 person of the necessity to have the child immunized, that such immuniza-
 tion may be administered by any health practitioner, or that  the  child
 may  be  immunized  without  charge  by the health officer in the county
 where the child resides, if such person executes a consent therefor.  In
 the event that such person does not wish to select a health practitioner
 to  administer the immunization, he or she shall be provided with a form
 which shall give notice that as a prerequisite to processing the  appli-
 cation for admission to, or for continued attendance at, the school such
 person  shall  state  a  valid reason for withholding consent or consent
 shall be given for immunization to be administered by a  health  officer
 in  the public employ, or by a school physician or nurse. The form shall
 provide for the execution of a consent by such person and it shall  also
 state  that  such  person  need  not execute such consent if subdivision
 eight of this section applies to such child.
  7. (a) No principal, teacher, owner or person in charge  of  a  school
 shall  permit any child to be admitted to such school, or to attend such
 school, in excess of fourteen days, without the certificate provided for

 the child's immunization against poliomyelitis, mumps, measles, diphthe-
 ria, rubella, varicella, hepatitis B,  pertussis,  tetanus,  and,  where
 applicable,  Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), meningococcal disease,
 INFLUENZA VIRUS, and pneumococcal disease; provided, however, such four-
 teen day period may be extended to not more  than  thirty  days  for  an
 individual student by the appropriate principal, teacher, owner or other
 person in charge where such student is transferring from out-of-state or
 from  another country and can show a good faith effort to get the neces-
 sary certification or other evidence of immunization.
  (b) A parent, a guardian or any other person in parental  relationship
 to  a  child denied school entrance or attendance may appeal by petition
 to the commissioner of education in accordance with  the  provisions  of
 section three hundred ten of the education law.
  8. If any physician licensed to practice medicine in this state certi-
 fies  that such immunization may be detrimental to a child's health, the
 requirements of this section shall be inapplicable until such  immuniza-
 tion is found no longer to be detrimental to the child's health.
  8-a.  Whenever  a  child  has  been refused admission to, or continued
 attendance at, a school as provided for in  subdivision  seven  of  this
 section  because there exists no certificate provided for in subdivision
 five of this section or other acceptable evidence of the child's immuni-
 zation against poliomyelitis, mumps, measles, diphtheria, rubella, vari-
 cella, hepatitis B, pertussis, tetanus, and, where applicable, Haemophi-
 lus influenzae type b (Hib), meningococcal disease, INFLUENZA VIRUS, and
 pneumococcal disease, the principal, teacher, owner or person in  charge
 of the school shall:
  a. forward a report of such exclusion and the name and address of such
 child  to  the  local  health  authority  and  to the person in parental
 relation to the child together with a notification of the responsibility
 A. 1811  4
 
 of such person under subdivision two of  this  section  and  a  form  of
 consent as prescribed by regulation of the commissioner, and
  b.  provide,  with  the  cooperation  of  the appropriate local health
 authority, for a time and place at which an immunizing agent  or  agents
 shall  be  administered, as required by subdivision two of this section,
 to a child for whom a consent has been obtained. Upon failure of a local
 health authority to cooperate in arranging for a time and place at which
 an immunizing agent or agents  shall  be  administered  as  required  by
 subdivision two of this section, the commissioner shall arrange for such
 administration and may recover the cost thereof from the amount of state
 aid to which the local health authority would otherwise be entitled.
  10.  The  commissioner  may  adopt  and amend rules and regulations to
 effectuate the provisions and purposes of this section.
  11. Every school shall annually provide  the  commissioner,  on  forms
 provided  by  the  commissioner, a summary regarding compliance with the
 provisions of this section.
  § 2. This act shall take effect one year after it shall have become  a
 law.
