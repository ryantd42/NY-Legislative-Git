  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  January 1, 2023, as Ellis Island Day in the State of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  days  that  are  set aside to increase awareness of moments in
history which affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim January 1, 2023, as Ellis Island Day
in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance of National
Ellis Island Day; and
 
  WHEREAS, Ellis Island Day is observed annually  on  January  1st  to
celebrate  an  island  which  served  as a gateway to America during the
immigration wave of 1892 through 1954, when an average of  1,900  people
passed through the station daily; and
 
  WHEREAS,  During  this  time,  approximately  17  million  people
immigrated to America through the immigration station at  Ellis  Island;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  Long  before  it  became  the  site  of  the  immigration
processing stations, Ellis  Island  was  a  public  execution  site  for
pirates during the 1760s; years later, the island was sold to a colonial
New  York  merchant,  Samuel  Ellis,  who  tried  to  resell  it but was
unsuccessful; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1808, the United States government  fully  acquired  the
island  for  the  sum  of $10,000, and Ellis Island was converted into a
military fort to protect the New York Harbor from possible  British  and
French armed attacks; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  military  upgraded  the  island  to  include a 14-gun
battery,  mortar  battery,  magazine,  and  barracks;  after  its
fortification, Ellis Island was renamed Crown Fort but was later changed
to Fort Gibson after the War of 1812; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Upon  the completion of the war, Fort Gibson changed hands
and went through various states of  disuse;  by  1881,  almost  all  its
firepower  was  removed,  and  its  administration  passed to the Navy's
Bureau of Ordnance; and
 
  WHEREAS, In 1890, the United States government ordered the remaining
firepower  to  be  removed  and  the  island  converted  to  a  federal
immigration  station,  with  its  administration  handed  over  to  the
Department of the Treasury; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  immigration  station  began  receiving  immigrants  on
January 1, 1892, and by June 15, 1897, before its wooden structures were
razed in a fire accident, it had processed about 1.5 million immigrants;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  After  its  reconstruction  and expansion, the immigration
station was again opened on December 17, 1900, but closed for the  final
time on November 12, 1954; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1965,  Ellis Island was added to the Statue of Liberty
National  Monument  and  President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  approved  its
redevelopment; in 1990, the island's main building, a museum, was opened
to the public; the American Family Immigration History followed in 2001,
and the ferry building in 2007; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  imperative  that there be greater awareness of the
history of our State and Nation, and  more  must  be  done  to  increase
awareness at the local, State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim January 1, 2023, as  Ellis
Island Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
