  COMMENDING  Alex  Haley  upon  the occasion of his
  posthumous induction into the Rome Arts Hall of Fame
  on May 7, 2023
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to honor  and  pay
tribute  to those individuals whose commitment to promoting the richness
and  diversity  of  the  performing,  visual,  and  literary  arts,  has
contributed  to the strength, vitality, and cultural enrichment of their
communities and the great State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commend Alex Haley upon the occasion of his  posthumous  induction  into
the  Rome  Arts  Hall  of  Fame  on  Sunday, May 7, 2023, at the Capitol
Theatre in Rome, New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Individuals devoted to improving the quality  of  life  for
others,  enabling  them  to  build  lives  of dignity and self-worth are
deserving of the highest praise and recognition; Alex Haley was one such
individual; and
 
  WHEREAS, Alex Haley lived in Rome, New York for several years during
the period in which he wrote Roots: The  Saga  of  an  American  Family,
which was published in 1976, and the 1977 miniseries of the same name is
estimated  to have attracted over 130 million viewers, greatly expanding
the reach of his literary arts to many beyond New York State  to  enjoy;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  The arts are the building blocks of civilization; they are
central  to  human  expression;  they  enlighten  us  and  inspire  the
imagination;  educational  institutions,  individuals, and organizations
which further such worthy purposes  richly  merit  the  recognition  and
appreciation of this Legislative Body and the people of the State of New
York; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commend Alex Haley upon the occasion of his  posthumous  induction  into
the Rome Arts Hall of Fame on May 7, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to the family of Alex Haley.
