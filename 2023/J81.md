  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Asthma Awareness Month in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months and days that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of
serious  conditions that affect the lives of citizens of New York State;
and
 
  WHEREAS, This  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to  memorialize
Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 2023, as Asthma Awareness Month in
the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction with the observance of World
Asthma Day on Tuesday, May 2, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS, Asthma affects nearly 15 million Americans; more than  five
percent  of the United States population with the overwhelming burden of
this disease being felt predominantly by children, the poor and minority
communities across the nation; and
 
  WHEREAS, According to the Centers for  Disease  Control,  there  are
over  a  million  New  Yorkers suffering from asthma, a rate higher than
those of states like California, Florida and  Texas  which  have  larger
populations; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The United States Environmental Protection Agency released
information classifying New York as the state with the dirtiest  air  in
the  nation;  yet  school districts and municipal transportation systems
continue  to  use  diesel-fuel  burning  vehicles  that  exacerbate  the
situation by increasing pollution levels; and
 
  WHEREAS,  With  over 50,000 school buses transporting over 2 million
school-age children daily throughout the State, it is easy  to  see  how
such  decisions in aggregate are part of the negligence and neglect that
negatively impacts all our lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, Given that children often ride the school bus every day for
many years, this type  of  exposure  accumulates,  translating  into  an
unacceptably  high  risk  of  developing cancer and respiratory diseases
later in life; and
 
  WHEREAS, Asthma is the leading cause of school  absenteeism  due  to
chronic illness and is the second most significant respiratory condition
as a cause of home confinement for adults; each year, asthma causes more
than  18  million days of restricted activity, and millions of visits to
physicians' offices and emergency rooms; and
 
  WHEREAS, The documented increases in air pollution in New York  City
combined  with  the proximity of school buildings to diesel-fuel burning
bus depots, major highways, waste transfer stations and industrial parks
are increasing the levels of asthma to epidemic proportions; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is understood that we cannot immediately remove all  the
causes  of air pollution from around our schools and communities, but we
 
can still reduce the impact of this  disease  on  children  by  lowering
their exposure to illness causes and disease aggravating pollutants such
as diesel-fuel burning buses and their toxic emissions; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  asthma  epidemic  facing  our communities in New York
State is a health care issue that  can  no  longer  be  ignored;  it  is
imperative  that  we  focus  on  this  matter,  especially  with  its
disproportionate impact on minorities, children, and  the  impoverished;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Asthma
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  a  copy  of this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York.
