  (v)  require,  in consultation and cooperation with the superintendent
 of financial services, that every individual applying  for  health  care

 iation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152), be provided space so that such appli-
 cant may register in the "donate  life  registry"  for  organ,  eye  and

  "Would you like to be added to the Donate Life Registry? Check box for
 'yes' or 'skip this question'."
  The commissioner shall not maintain records of any person  who  checks
 "skip  this question". Except where the application is made in person or
 electronically, failure to check a box shall not impair the validity  of
 an  application, and failure to check "yes" or checking "skip this ques-
 tion" shall not be construed to imply a wish not to donate. In the  case
 of  an  applicant  under eighteen years of age, checking "yes" shall not
 constitute consent to make an anatomical gift  or  registration  in  the
 donate  life  registry,  EXCEPT  AS  OTHERWISE  PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THE
 PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF SUBDIVISION ONE  OF  SECTION  FORTY-THREE
 HUNDRED ONE OF THIS CHAPTER. Where an applicant has previously consented
