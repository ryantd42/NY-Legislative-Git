  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative Body to  recognize  and

quality of education in the State of New  York,  and  which  enable  our
schools  to  offer  excellent educational programs in the most efficient
manner; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate  the  75th  Anniversary  of  the  Boards  of  Cooperative
Educational Services (BOCES) to be celebrated in March 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Boards  of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) are an
integral  component  of  New  York  State's  public  education  system,
providing  special  education  services  to  more  than  16,000 students
annually, as well as career and technical education; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception in 1948, the BOCES system  has  offered
programs  and  services  unparalleled in meeting the unique needs of New
York's students, school districts, business and industry; and
 
  WHEREAS, Leaders of innovation, BOCES fund  efforts  in  equity  and
inclusion,  supporting  professional  learning  for  educators,  and
developing new programs and services to meet the changing needs  of  the
state's students and businesses; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, this vital organization provides professional
development to more than 200,000 educators each year; and
 
  WHEREAS, A partner to both  industry  and  higher  education,  BOCES
collaborates  with  more  than  2,000  colleges and universities, giving
students  the  opportunity  to  further  their  education  at  the
post-secondary level; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In addition, each year, over 20,000 New Yorkers earn their
high school equivalency and study English  as  a  second  language  with
BOCES services and programs; and
 
  WHEREAS, The collaboration and efficiency exemplified by BOCES saves
school  districts  more  than  $20  million annually through cooperative
purchasing agreements and shared services to stimulate  economic  growth
in communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Steeped  in  a  proud and distinguished history, BOCES may
look back with pride upon its humble beginnings, find just  satisfaction
in  its purposeful growth, and hold true of purpose in its commitment to
serving the educational needs of the citizens of the State of New  York;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate  the  75th  Anniversary  of  the  Boards  of  Cooperative
 
Educational  Services,  noting the propriety of its goals, the constancy
of its  commitment  and  the  significance  of  its  accomplishments  in
