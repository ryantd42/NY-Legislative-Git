  Section  1.  Subdivision 7 of section 730.20 of the criminal procedure

 as follows:
  7.  A  psychiatric  examiner is entitled to his reasonable traveling
 expenses, a fee of fifty dollars for each examination of a defendant and
 a fee of fifty dollars for each appearance at a court hearing  or  trial
 but not exceeding two hundred dollars in fees for examination and testi-
 mony  in  any  one  case; except that if such psychiatric examiner be an
 employee of the state of New York he shall be entitled only  to  reason-
 able  traveling  expenses,  unless  such  psychiatric examiner makes the
 examination or appears at a court hearing or trial outside his hours  of
 state  employment  in a county in which the director of community mental
 health services certifies to the fiscal officer thereof that there is  a
 shortage  of  qualified  psychiatrists available to conduct examinations
 under the criminal procedure law in such county, in which event he shall
 be entitled to the foregoing fees  and  reasonable  traveling  expenses.
 Such fees and traveling expenses and the costs of sending a defendant to
 another  place  of  detention  or  to a hospital for examination, of his
 maintenance therein and of returning him shall,  when  approved  by  the
 court, be a charge of the [county in which the defendant is being tried]
 STATE.
