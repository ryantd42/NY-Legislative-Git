Assembly Resolution No. 549
 
BY: M. of A. Rosenthal L
 
  Memorializing Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim
  May 28, 2023, as Menstrual Hygiene Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  Menstrual  Hygiene Day is a global initiative that aims to
bring together individuals from different cultures  and  professions  to
promote Menstrual Hygiene Management; and
 
  WHEREAS, Menstrual Hygiene Day educates individuals around the world
about the challenges that women, girls, and all menstruating individuals
face  as a result of this biological function; this day puts a spotlight
on solutions to address these challenges and spread  awareness  of  this
international health movement; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  date  of  May  28  was chosen because of its symbolic
meaning; May, the 5th month of the year,  represents  the  average  five
days each month in a menstrual cycle and the 28 represents the length of
the average menstrual cycle; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  movement  was  initiated  in  2014 by WASH United, a
Germany-based organization; since the beginning of the annual  Menstrual
Hygiene  Day,  the  organization has forged an alliance of 910 partners,
and in 2022 the largest Menstrual Hygiene Day reached a  record-breaking
687  million  people  worldwide  and  inspired  225,000  social  media
contributions; and
 
  WHEREAS, The spirit of Menstrual Hygiene  Day  encompasses  breaking
the  silence, shame and stigma that surrounds menstruation; women, girls
and all menstruating individuals have  been  taught  to  be  ashamed  or
embarrassed  of their periods rather than being educated on this natural
bodily function; and
 
  WHEREAS, Menstrual Hygiene Day also addresses the lack of access  to
menstrual hygiene products as an issue of human rights and dignity; many
menstruating  individuals  around  the  world lack adequate and reliable
access to menstrual hygiene products; and
 
  WHEREAS, Far too  many  students  have  their  access  to  education
interrupted  because they do not have access to these essential products
and frequently must miss school; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Menstrual  Hygiene  Day  focuses  on  the  theme  "We  Are
Committed"  which  sends a signal that all participants are committed to
creating a world where no one is held back because  they  menstruate  by
2030; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Menstrual Hygiene Day spreads awareness of the fundamental
role that good menstrual hygiene  management  plays  in  helping  women,
girls  and  menstruating  individuals  reach their full potential in all
aspects of their lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, The  citizens  of  the  State  of  New  York  stand  firmly
committed  to  promoting good menstrual hygiene management as a catalyst
 
for the success and health of our  women,  girls  and  all  menstruating
individuals; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 28, 2023, as Menstrual
Hygiene Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of the Annual International Menstrual Hygiene Day; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
