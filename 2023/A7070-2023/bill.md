  3. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW TO THE CONTRARY, JUDGES PRESIDING  IN
 THE  YOUTH PART SHALL HAVE ACCESS TO ALL FAMILY COURT RECORDS, INCLUDING

 AGAINST THE DEFENDANT. ANY SUCH RELEVANT RECORDS SHALL BE MADE AVAILABLE

  (d) The court shall deny the motion to prevent removal of  the  action
 in youth part unless the court makes a determination upon such motion by
 the district attorney that extraordinary circumstances exist that should
 prevent  the transfer of the action to family court. FOR THE PURPOSES OF
 THIS PARAGRAPH, THE COURT MAY FIND EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE
 DEFENDANT IS ACCUSED OF AN OFFENSE INVOLVING  THE  USE,  POSSESSION,  OR
 DISPLAY  OF A FIREARM, SHOTGUN, RIFLE OR OTHER DEADLY WEAPON. NOTHING IN
 THIS SECTION SHALL PREVENT THE COURT FROM FINDING EXTRAORDINARY  CIRCUM-
 STANCES  EXIST  BASED  UPON  A FINDING THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS PREVIOUSLY
 BEEN CONVICTED OF AN OFFENSE INVOLVING THE ILLEGAL USE,  POSSESSION,  OR
 DISPLAY  OF A FIREARM, SHOTGUN, RIFLE OR OTHER DEADLY WEAPON OR THAT THE
 DEFENDANT WAS PREVIOUSLY ADJUDICATED AS A  YOUTHFUL  OFFENDER,  JUVENILE
