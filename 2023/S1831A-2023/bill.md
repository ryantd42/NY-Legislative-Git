 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Paragraph (a) of subdivision 1 of section 58 of the civil

 first, two thousand five and June thirtieth, two thousand five  and  who
 takes  the  next  written  exam offered after the effective date of this
 subparagraph by the city of Buffalo civil service commission for employ-
 ment  as  a  police officer in the city of Buffalo police department, or
 June thirtieth, two thousand six, whichever is later; and
  (iii) such maximum age requirement of [thirty-five] FORTY years  shall
 not  apply  to  any  police officer of any county, town, city or village
 police force not otherwise provided for in this section if the  eligible
 list  has  been  exhausted  and  there are no other eligible candidates;
 provided, however, the police officer themselves  are  on  the  eligible
 list  of  such county, town, city or village and meet all other require-
 ments of merit and fitness set forth by this chapter and do  not  exceed
 the maximum age of [thirty-nine] FORTY-FOUR;
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This  bill  would  amend the Civil Service Law to increase the maximum
 age for appointment in the competitive class of the civil service  as  a
 police officer of the department of environmental conservation or of any
 police  force  or  police department of any county, city, town, village,
 housing authority or police district to forty years of  age.  Currently,
 the  maximum  age  for  appointment  into these positions is thirty-five
 years of age.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2024  Legislative  Session,  it  is
 anticipated that there would be a broader group of eligible police offi-
 cers  to  become covered in the New York State and Local Police and Fire
 Retirement System (NYSLPFRS). These members would accrue  benefits  that
 would  be  funded  by  the  normal employer contributions, and we do not
 anticipate any increases in the annual contribution rates for any of the
 participating employers in the NYSLPFRS.
