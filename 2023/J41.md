  COMMEMORATING  the  50th  Anniversary  of  the
  Marr-Logg House of Utica, New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense  of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
illustrious  culinary  establishments which have positively impacted and
substantially contributed to the vitality of their communities; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Marr-Logg House  of  Utica,  New
York on October 17, 2022; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  1972,  a  22-year-old Utica entrepreneur John Marraffa
fulfilled his dream of opening a  restaurant  when  he  established  the
Marr-Logg  House,  now located at 1130 Culver Avenue, on Kellogg Road in
New Hartford; and
 
  WHEREAS, A true landmark within its community, the diner has  served
breakfast and lunch to generations of customers for five decades; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Since  its  inception,  John  Marraffa  has  steadfastly
dedicated his life to the success of Marr-Logg House,  serving  in  many
capacities, including owner, manager, operator and cook; at the original
Kellogg Road location, his wife Annette Belmont and another staff member
waited tables while he was in the kitchen or behind the counter; and
 
  WHEREAS, When the restaurant moved to Culver Avenue in 1987, morning
coffee took over the counter and eventually shortened its hours to offer
breakfast  and  brunch;  John and his wife ran the business hand in hand
until her death in 2005; and
 
  WHEREAS, Despite going through challenges and closing for  100  days
during  the  pandemic,  the Marr-Logg House has remained busy throughout
its distinguished history; its staff, who consider one  another  family,
have tirelessly served the community together for 50 years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Furthermore, the restaurant has served as the starting off
point for many people in the community, including  John  Marraffa's  own
children, who are now professionals in toxicology and pharmacy; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  remarkable  success  of the Marr-Logg House is due in
large  part  to  its  owners  and  dedicated  staff  whose  warmth  and
hospitality  are  easily recognized by their loyal patrons; this dynamic
team is well-versed in customer service and  truly  makes  everyone  who
walks through their door feel like family; and
 
  WHEREAS,  For  five  decades,  the  Marr-Logg  House  has stood as a
beloved establishment which has provided a  friendly,  open  environment
for  patrons  to collectively gather and share their thoughts, ideas and
life experiences; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  with  great  pleasure  that  this  Legislative  Body
acknowledges  this  exceptional  business  and  its contributions to the
 
local and State economies, fully confident  that  it  will  continue  to
enjoy  the  sparkling  successes  it  has  experienced  thus  far;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Marr-Logg House  of  Utica,  New
York,  and to offer its best wishes to owner John Marraffa for continued
success in all his future endeavors; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Marr-Logg House of Utica, New York.
