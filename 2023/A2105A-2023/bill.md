 the  death of the victim, provided, however, that upon good cause shown,
 the office may extend the time for filing. The office shall  extend  the
 time  for  filing  where  the  claimant  received  no notice pursuant to
 section  six  hundred twenty-five-a of this article and had no knowledge
 of eligibility pursuant to section six hundred twenty-four of this arti-
 cle.
  § 3. Paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of section 627  of  the  executive
 law,  as  added  by  section 18 of part A-1 of chapter 56 of the laws of
 2010, is amended to read as follows:
  (c) the investigation and determination of claims regardless of wheth-
 er the alleged criminal has been ARRESTED, CHARGED, apprehended or pros-
 ecuted for or convicted of any crime based upon the  same  incident,  or
 has  been  acquitted, or found not guilty of the crime in question owing
 to criminal irresponsibility or other legal exemption;
  § 4. Subdivision 1 of section 631 of the executive law, as  separately
 amended  by chapters 189 and 295 of the laws of 2018, is amended to read
 as follows:

 injury to or the exacerbation of a preexisting disability, or condition,
 or death of, the victim[,]; and (c) EITHER: (I) criminal justice  agency
 records  show  that  such  crime  was  [promptly] reported to the proper
 authorities[; and in no case may an award be  made  where  the  criminal

 made]  within  a  reasonable  time  considering  all  the circumstances,
 including the victim's physical,  emotional  and  mental  condition  and
 family  situation[.];  OR (II) SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE IS PROVIDED TO SHOW

 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO SUCH PHYSICAL INJURY;
  (D) A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT RESTRAINING  ORDER  OR  PROTECTIVE  ORDER

 CLE, FROM THE PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE QUALIFYING CRIME;
