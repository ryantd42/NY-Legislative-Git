  §  2. Subdivision 2 of section 625 of the executive law, as amended by
 section 10 of part A-1 of chapter 56 of the laws of 2010, is amended  to
 read as follows:
  2.  A  claim  must  be filed by the claimant not later than [one year]
 THREE YEARS after the occurrence or discovery of the  crime  upon  which
 such  claim  is  based,  [one  year]  THREE  YEARS after a court finds a
 lawsuit to be frivolous, or not later than [one year] THREE YEARS  after
 the  death of the victim, provided, however, that upon good cause shown,
 the office may extend the time for filing. The office shall  extend  the
 time  for  filing  where  the  claimant  received  no notice pursuant to
 section six hundred twenty-five-a of this article and had  no  knowledge
 of eligibility pursuant to section six hundred twenty-four of this arti-
 cle.
  §  3.  Paragraph  (c) of subdivision 1 of section 627 of the executive
 law, as added by section 18 of part A-1 of chapter 56  of  the  laws  of

  (c) the investigation and determination of claims regardless of wheth-
 er the alleged criminal has been ARRESTED, CHARGED, apprehended or pros-
 ecuted  for  or  convicted of any crime based upon the same incident, or

 to criminal irresponsibility or other legal exemption;

 amended by chapters 189 and 295 of the laws of 2018, is amended to  read

 physical injury to or the exacerbation of a preexisting  disability,  or
 condition,  or  death  of,  the  victim[,]; and (c) EITHER: (I) criminal
 justice agency records show that such crime was [promptly]  reported  to
 the  proper  authorities[; and in no case may an award be made where the
