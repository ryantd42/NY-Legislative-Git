  COMMEMORATING  the  13th  Annual  Walk-N-Roll  for
  Spina  Bifida  at  Central  Park  in  the  City  of
  Schenectady on May 21, 2023
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is the sense of this Legislative Body to recognize and
commend events which raise awareness  and  provide  support  for  people
living  with  Spina Bifida to thrive in a barrier-free world that offers
ready access to an array of effective treatment  options  and  uniformly
excellent medical care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
commemorate the 13th Annual Walk-N-Roll for Spina Bifida at Central Park
in the City of Schenectady on Sunday, May 21, 2023; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Spina  bifida  is  a  condition that affects the spine, is
usually apparent at birth, and is a type of neural  tube  defect,  which
can  happen  anywhere  along the spine if the neural tube does not close
all the way; and
 
  WHEREAS, When the  neural  tube  doesn't  close  all  the  way,  the
backbone  that  protects  the  spinal  cord doesn't form and close as it
should, which often results in damage to the spinal cord and nerves; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Spina Bifida Association of Northeastern New  York  was
formed  in  1993  by  a  small  group  of Capital District parents whose
children were born with Spina Bifida; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since then, the organization has grown, now serving all  of
New  York  State, including adults with Spina Bifida, young children and
their parents, spouses, and grandparents; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Spina  Bifida  Association  of  Northeastern  New  York
remains steadfast in their mission to build a better and brighter future
for all those impacted by Spina Bifida; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Walk-n-Roll,  which is sponsored by The Daily Gazette
and organized by the Spina Bifida Association of Northeastern New  York,
is  a  three-mile  walking  event to raise awareness of Spina Bifida and
celebrate the accomplishments of those living with the  condition;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 13th Annual Walk-N-Roll for Spina Bifida at Central Park
in the City of Schenectady on May 21, 2023; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That copies of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to  members  of  the Board of Directors at the Spina Bifida
Association of Northeastern New York.
