 CANT  SHALL  FURNISH  PROOF  TO THE COMMISSIONER, IN THE APPLICATION FOR
 REGISTRATION, OR OTHERWISE, OF THE MAKE, MODEL AND MODEL  YEAR  OF  SUCH
 APPLICANT'S MOTOR VEHICLE. IF SUCH PROOF HAS BEEN SUBMITTED, SUCH APPLI-
 CANT'S  CERTIFICATE  OF REGISTRATION SHALL CONTAIN A DISTINGUISHING MARK
 WHICH SHALL DESIGNATE SUCH APPLICANT'S MOTOR  VEHICLE  AS  A  "QUALIFIED
 HYBRID  VEHICLE,"  AND  SHALL  ALSO  DISPLAY SUCH MOTOR VEHICLE'S UNITED
 STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HIGHWAY FUEL  ECONOMY  RATING  OF
 FORTY-FIVE  MILES PER GALLON OR MORE. THE COMMISSIONER IS HEREBY AUTHOR-
 IZED TO PROMULGATE ANY RULES AND REGULATIONS NECESSARY FOR THE IMPLEMEN-
 TATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH; AND (G)  such  additional
 facts or evidence as the commissioner may require in connection with the
 application for registration.
  §  3.  Paragraph  a of subdivision 3 of section 401 of the vehicle and
 traffic law, as amended by section 1 of part H of chapter 59 of the laws
 of 2009, is amended to read as follows:
  a. Upon filing of such application and the payment of the fee  herein-
 after  provided,  the  commissioner shall assign to such motor vehicle a
 distinctive number and, without expense  to  the  applicant,  issue  and
 deliver  in  such  manner  as the commissioner may select to the owner a
 certificate of registration, in such  form  as  the  commissioner  shall
 prescribe[,].  SUCH  CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION SHALL CONTAIN A DISTIN-
 GUISHING MARK WHICH SHALL DESIGNATE SUCH MOTOR VEHICLE AS  A  "QUALIFIED
 HYBRID  VEHICLE" AS DEFINED IN SECTION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE-B OF THIS
 CHAPTER, PURSUANT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (F) OF PARAGRAPH B OF SUBDIVISION  ONE
 OF  THIS SECTION, AND SHALL CONTAIN ADEQUATE SPACE UPON WHICH SUCH MOTOR
 VEHICLE'S UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION  AGENCY  HIGHWAY  FUEL
 ECONOMY  RATING  OF  FORTY-FIVE  MILES  PER  GALLON  OR  MORE  SHALL  BE
 DISPLAYED. THE COMMISSIONER SHALL ALSO  ISSUE  and  DELIVER  two  number
 plates at a place within the state of New York named by the applicant in
 his or her application. A number plate, within the meaning of this chap-
 ter,  may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be a plate of a perma-
 nent nature, treated with reflectorized material according to specifica-
 tions prescribed by the commissioner, and with a date  tag  attached  to
 such plate or to the vehicle as prescribed by regulations of the commis-
 sioner  indicating the validity of the plate during a certain period and
 the issuance of such a number plate with  such  date  tag  to  a  person
 possessing  such a number plate shall be deemed the issuance of a number
 plate. An additional fee, not to exceed twenty-five  dollars,  shall  be
 paid  to  the commissioner whenever a set of reflectorized number plates
 is issued for any vehicle for  which  a  registration  fee  is  normally
 charged  except  that, with respect to any number plate which is specif-
 ically requested by the applicant, such fee shall be paid to the commis-
 sioner upon approval of such request. In the event of the loss,  mutila-
 tion or destruction of any certificate of registration, any number plate
 or  set  of number plates whether with or without a date tag or tags, or
 any date tag or set of date tags provided for in this article, the owner
 of a registered motor vehicle may file such statement and proof  of  the
 facts as the commissioner shall require, with a fee of three dollars, in
 the  office  of  the commissioner, or, unless and until the commissioner
 shall otherwise direct, in the  office  of  the  agent  who  issued  the
 certificate,  plate,  plates, tag or tags and the commissioner or his or
 her agent, as the case may be, shall issue a duplicate or substitute. It
 shall be the duty of every owner holding a certificate  of  registration
 to notify the commissioner in writing of any change of residence of such
 person within ten days after such change occurs, and to inscribe on such
 A. 2651  3
 
 certificate, in the place provided by the commissioner, a record of such
 change of residence.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after
 it shall have become a law.
