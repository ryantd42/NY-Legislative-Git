 Introduced  by  M.  of A. PHEFFER AMATO -- read once and referred to the
  Committee on Governmental Employees
 
 AN ACT to amend the retirement and social security law, in  relation  to
  the overtime ceiling for correction officers of the Westchester county
  correction department

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Subdivision l of section 601 of the retirement  and  social
 security  law  is  amended  by  adding  a  new  paragraph (e) to read as
 follows:
  (E) NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (C)  AND  SUBPARAGRAPH
 ONE  OF  PARAGRAPH (D) OF THIS SUBDIVISION, COMMENCING ON JANUARY FIRST,
 TWO THOUSAND TWENTY-FOUR "OVERTIME CEILING" FOR ANY  CORRECTION  OFFICER
 OF  THE  WESTCHESTER  COUNTY CORRECTION DEPARTMENT AS DEFINED IN SECTION
 EIGHTY-NINE-E OF THIS CHAPTER SHALL MEAN THE GREATER OF: (I)  THE  OVER-
 TIME  CEILING  AS DEFINED IN THIS SUBDIVISION; OR (II) THIRTY PERCENT OF
 THE REGULAR COMPENSATION EARNED BY AND PAID TO SUCH MEMBER BY  WESTCHES-
 TER COUNTY FOR SUCH MEMBER'S SERVICE AS A CORRECTION OFFICER.
  § 2. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, none of the
 provisions of this act shall be subject to the appropriation requirement
 of section 25 of the retirement and social security law.
  §  3.  All  past  service  costs  associated  with  implementing  the
 provisions of this act shall be borne by the county of  Westchester  and
 may be amortized over a period of ten years.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would change the allowable overtime compensation included in
 the final average salary calculation beginning January 1, 2024 to thirty
 percent  of a member's annual wages if greater than the limits currently
 defined in Section 601 of the Retirement and  Social  Security  Law  for
 Tier 5 and Tier 6 Westchester County correction officers. Current limits

 were set at $15,000 at the inception of each tier, with the Tier 5 limit
 increasing  3%  annually  and  the Tier 6 limit increasing annually with
 inflation.
  If this bill is enacted during the 2023 legislative session, we antic-
 ipate  that  there  will be an increase of approximately $430,000 in the
 annual contributions of Westchester County for the  fiscal  year  ending
 March  31,  2024.  In  future  years, this cost will vary as the billing
 rates and salary of the affected members change.
  In addition to the annual contributions discussed above, there will be
 an immediate past service cost of approximately $2.63 million which will
 be borne by Westchester County as  a  one-time  payment.  This  estimate
 assumes  that  payment  will be made on February 1, 2024. If Westchester
 County elects to amortize this cost over a 10 year period, the cost  for
 the first year including interest would be $336,000.
  These  estimated  costs  are  based  on 474 affected Tier 5 and Tier 6
 correction officers employed by Westchester County, with  annual  salary
 of approximately $48.3 million as of March 31, 2022.
