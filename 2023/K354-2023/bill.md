  CONGRATULATING  the  State  of  Israel on the 75th
  Anniversary of its establishment and reaffirming the
  bonds of friendship, cooperation, and shared  values
  between  the  people  of  the  State of New York and
  Israel
 
  WHEREAS, 2023 marks the 75th Anniversary of the establishment of the
modern State of Israel in the ancestral home of the Jewish people; and
 
  WHEREAS, On November 29, 1947, the United Nations  General  Assembly
voted  to  partition  the British Mandate of Palestine, and through that
vote, to create the State of Israel; and
 
  WHEREAS, Israel was officially declared an independent nation on May
14, 1948, in fulfillment of the eternal desire of the Jewish  people  to
return  to  the land of the historic Kingdom of Israel established 3,000
years ago and to the holy city of Jerusalem; and
 
  WHEREAS, On the same day in 1948, only 11 minutes later, the  United
States  recognized  the  new  State  of  Israel  and  established  full
diplomatic relations with Israel; and
 
  WHEREAS, For more than 2,000 years, there has been continuous Jewish
presence and residence in  the  land  comprising  the  modern  State  of
Israel; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  century  ago  at  the First Zionist Congress, in Basel,
Switzerland,  participants  under  the  leadership  of  Theodore  Herzl
affirmed  the  desire  to  reestablish a Jewish homeland in the historic
land of Israel; and
 
  WHEREAS, The modern State of Israel was created  just  a  few  years
after  the  Holocaust  and  World War II, where the death of six million
Jews did not eliminate the will of the Jewish People to seek dignity  in
life  and  a  place  of  respect and recognition among the people of the
world; and
 
  WHEREAS, Israel, since its inception, when the  combined  forces  of
five  Arab  nations  invaded  to destroy the dream of the Jewish people,
continues to face the hostility, and frequently through the years of its
statehood, the armed aggression, of its neighbors; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Despite  these  conflicts,  in  the  75  years  since  its
establishment, the modern State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a
new  and  dynamic  society,  and  created  a  unique and vital economic,
political, cultural and intellectual life despite the heavy cost of  six
wars, terrorism, international ostracism and economic boycotts; and
 
  WHEREAS,  In  its  75  years  of statehood, Israel has established a
modern parliamentary  democracy  and  has  become  the  most  successful
democracy  in  the  Middle  East, and has provided its citizens with the
highest standards of living and human equality  in  a  region  otherwise
beset with poverty and human rights abuses; and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Israel  has  made  significant global contributions in the
fields of science, medicine, and technology; and
 
  WHEREAS, Israel is home to many religions, primarily Judaism, Islam,
Christianity, and Druze, as well  as  many  religious  sites  sacred  to
Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Druze; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  State  of Israel has become a source of agricultural,
industrial,  technological,  academic,  and  cultural  achievement  and
creativity; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The State of Israel has formed many strategic partnerships
with the United States and  developed  a  relationship  valued  by  both
countries; and
 
  WHEREAS,  On  March  26,  1979, Israel signed a groundbreaking peace
treaty with Egypt, the first of its kind with an Arab State, followed by
the Israel-Jordan peace treaty on October 26, 1994; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Abraham Accords, signed by the United  States,  Israel,
United  Arab  Emirates,  and  Bahrain  on  September 15, 2020, the joint
declaration with Morocco on December 22, 2020, and the  Abraham  Accords
Declaration  by  Sudan  on January 6, 2021, marked the first instance of
new normalized relations between Israel and Arab countries in more  than
two  decades  and  have ushered in a new era of peace in the Middle East
and North Africa; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Abraham  Accords  has  advanced  understanding  and
interfaith dialogue and has led to growth in tourism, trade, investment,
and defense cooperation between member countries showcasing the untapped
potential  of  building  a  better  future for all in the region to work
together towards a two-state solution; and
 
  WHEREAS, Since its inception, the State of Israel has and  continues
to face challenges to its safety and security; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Israel  continues  to  strive  for peace with security and
dignity for itself, its neighbors and throughout the world in  order  to
fulfill the prophecy of becoming a light unto the nations; and
 
  WHEREAS, The people of New York share an affinity with the people of
Israel  and view Israel as a strong and trusted ally; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
congratulate  the  State  of  Israel  upon  the  occasion  of  the  75th
Anniversary of its independence;  applauds  Israel  for  its  incredible
growth  since  its founding and the Israeli people for their significant
contributions to the international community; and reaffirms the bonds of
friendship and cooperation between the State of New York and Israel; and
be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted to the Consul General of Israel for New York.
