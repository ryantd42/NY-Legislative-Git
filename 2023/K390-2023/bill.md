  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 31, 2023, as Save Your Hearing Day in the  State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official days that are set aside to increase awareness of health  issues
that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this  Legislative  Body  is  justly  proud  to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 31, 2023, as Save Your
Hearing Day in the State of New York, in conjunction with the observance
of National Save Your Hearing Day; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National Save Your Hearing Day is observed annually on May
31, the culmination of Better  Hearing  and  Speech  Month,  and  raises
awareness  about  hearing  loss  and  the  importance  of preserving our
hearing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Records of hearing loss  have  been  around  since  ancient
times; an Egyptian mummy showed evidence of having a perforated eardrum,
which signals hearing loss; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Sign  language  began to be used early on, as evidenced by
the writings of the Athenian philosopher Plato; the earliest mention  of
a  hearing  device  comes  from  the  writings of an Italian scholar who
described an instrument which could amplify sounds; and
 
  WHEREAS, In later years, education on hearing protection was spurred
on by military needs; both World Wars saw the  development  of  multiple
new  inventions  in  hearing aid, from earplugs and ear flaps to protect
hearing, to earmuffs; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, as with most inventions, these  earmuffs  also
underwent  a  series  of  transformations  to  become  the  fluffy  ear
protectors they are today; and
 
  WHEREAS, Today, National Save Your Hearing  Day  normalizes  hearing
problems, protects ear health and raises awareness about care; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Hearing  loss  can  be  prevented  or,  at the very least,
treated; learning more about our hearing teaches us how easy  it  is  to
abuse our ears and how quickly we can ruin our hearing capacity; it also
makes us more sympathetic towards those with hearing loss; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  simple  and small tweaks to our lifestyle provided on
National Save Your Hearing Day can drastically improve  hearing  health;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Save Your Hearing Day, and the subsequent events
around it, bring attention to an often neglected and abused part of  our
well-being, our hearing; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this health issue and more must be done to improve  hearing  health  for
all  New  Yorkers and those affected by hearing loss; now, therefore, be
it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim May 31, 2023, as Save Your
Hearing Day in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
