  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  Section 1. Subdivision 3 of section 168-f of the  correction  law,  as
 amended  by  chapter  364  of  the  laws  of 2012, is amended to read as
 follows:
  3. (A) The provisions of subdivision two  of  this  section  shall  be
 applied to a sex offender required to register under this article except
 that  such  sex  offender designated as a sexual predator or having been
 given a level three  designation  must  personally  verify  his  or  her
 address with the local law enforcement agency every ninety calendar days
 after  the  date  of  release  or commencement of parole or post-release
 supervision, or probation, or release on payment of a fine,  conditional
 discharge  or  unconditional discharge. At such time the law enforcement
 agency having jurisdiction may take a new photograph of such sex  offen-
 der if it appears that the offender has had a change in appearance since
 the most recent photograph taken pursuant to paragraph (b-2) of subdivi-
 sion  two of this section. If such photograph is taken, the law enforce-
 ment agency shall promptly forward a copy  of  such  photograph  to  the
 division.  The  duty to personally verify shall be temporarily suspended
 during any period in which the sex offender is confined to any state  or
 local  correctional  facility,  hospital  or institution and shall imme-
 diately recommence on the date of the sex offender's release.
  (B) NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (A) OF  THIS  SUBDIVI-
 SION,  ANY PERSON WHO IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER UNDER THIS ARTICLE AND WHO
 IS LIVING AS A TRANSIENT SHALL REGISTER AS FOLLOWS:
  (I) A TRANSIENT SHALL REGISTER WITHIN FIVE  DAYS  AFTER  RELEASE  FROM
