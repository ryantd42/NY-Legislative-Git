  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  September 2023, as Recovery Month in  the  State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
conditions that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2023,  as
Recovery Month in the  State  of  New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Recovery Month; and
 
  WHEREAS,  National  Recovery Month, sponsored by the Substance Abuse
and Mental  Health  Services  Administration  (SAMHSA),  is  a  national
observance held every September to educate Americans about substance use
treatment  and mental health services which can enable those with mental
and substance use disorders to live healthy and rewarding lives; and
 
  WHEREAS, National Recovery Month works to encourage and support  new
evidence-based  treatment  and  recovery  practices,  the emergence of a
strong and proud recovery  community,  and  the  dedication  of  service
providers  and  community members across the nation who make recovery in
all its forms possible; and
 
  WHEREAS, This vital observance began in 1989,  as  Treatment  Works!
Month,  which  honored the work of substance use treatment professionals
in the field; the observance evolved  into  National  Alcohol  and  Drug
Addiction  Recovery  Month  in  1998,  when  it  expanded  to  include
celebrating  the  accomplishments  of  individuals  in  recovery  from
substance  use  disorders; the observance evolved once again in 2011, to
National Recovery Month which includes mental illness; and
 
  WHEREAS, Now in its 34th year, Recovery Month celebrates  the  gains
made by those in recovery; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recovery  Month highlights the achievements of individuals
who have reclaimed their lives in  long-term  recovery  and  honors  the
treatment and recovery service providers who make recovery possible; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recovery  Month also promotes the message that recovery in
all its forms is possible and encourages citizens to take action to help
expand and improve the availability of effective prevention,  treatment,
and recovery services for those in need; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The observance of Recovery Month emphasizes that while the
road to recovery may  be  difficult,  the  benefits  of  preventing  and
overcoming  behavioral health conditions are significant and valuable to
individuals, families, and communities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Recovery  Month  promotes  the  societal  benefits  of
prevention,  treatment,  and  recovery  for  substance  use  and  mental
 
disorders, celebrates people in recovery,  lauds  the  contributions  of
treatment  and service providers, and promotes the message that recovery
in all its forms is possible  and  spreads  the  positive  message  that
behavioral health is essential to overall health, that prevention works,
treatment  is  effective, and people can and do recover; now, therefore,
be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  September  2023,  as
Recovery Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
