 AN ACT to direct the education department to study, review and report on
  the geographic cost variation of counties in the Hudson  Valley  labor
  force region to determine the appropriateness of the region cost index
  values for purposes of the public school foundation aid formula
 
  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature hereby finds  that  the
 introduction of the regional cost index into the state public school aid
 formula  provided  a  regional approach to recognizing the difference in
 labor market costs. In a June 7, 2006 report to  the  board  of  regents
 subcommittee on state aid, state education department staff noted in the
 combination  of  the  city  of  New  York and Long Island that there was
 "evidence that these two areas  actually  function  as  a  single  labor
 market  region.  With  professionals,  especially those in the education
 professions, moving to jobs across the lines between New York  city  and
 Long  Island, it is necessary to consider this entire region as a single
 area, with similar wage costs". At this same time, the education depart-
 ment decided to keep the county of Westchester within the Hudson  Valley
 for  the  regional cost index calculation. In 2016, this state enacted a
 new law to increase the minimum wage across the state. This  legislation
 included the county of Westchester along with the counties of Nassau and
 Suffolk, in phasing in such wage increases, setting a new precedent that
 should  be  considered  by the education department with regard to which
 labor market the county of Westchester should be included in.
  § 2. The education department shall, in consultation with the  depart-
 ment  of  labor,  study and review the geographic cost variations of the
 counties located in the Hudson Valley labor force  region  to  determine
 the  appropriateness  of  the regional cost index values used within the
 public school foundation aid formula, as well as county placement in the

 Hudson Valley  region.  Specifically,  the  education  department  shall
 consider  the movement of the county of Westchester currently within the
 Hudson Valley region into the Long Island/New  York  city  region.  Such
 department  shall  consult  with the department of labor to review labor
 costs for the Hudson Valley region and the  Long  Island/New  York  city
 region.
  The  education department shall also review the regional costs associ-
 ated with construction and study the impact on applying an  up  to  date
 cost index on public school building aid reimbursement.
  §  3.  The  education  department  shall,  on or before April 1, 2025,
 report the findings, conclusions and recommendations of  such  study  to
 the  governor,  temporary  president  of  the  senate and speaker of the
 assembly.
  § 4. This act shall take effect immediately.
