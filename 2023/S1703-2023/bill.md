 S. 1703  5
 
 after the date of issuance. In the counties of Nassau, Suffolk and West-
 chester,  any  license  to  carry [or] AND possess a pistol or revolver,
 issued at any time pursuant to this section or prior to the first day of
 July,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-three  and  not  limited to expire on an
 earlier date fixed in the license, shall expire not more than five years
 after the date of issuance; however, in the county of  Westchester,  any
 such  license  shall  be  certified prior to the first day of April, two
 thousand, in accordance with a schedule to be contained  in  regulations
 promulgated  by  the  commissioner  of  the division of criminal justice

 eafter.  For  purposes of this section certification shall mean that the
 licensee shall provide to the licensing officer the  following  informa-
 tion  only:  current name, date of birth, current address, and the make,
 model, caliber and serial number of all  firearms  currently  possessed.

 carry [or] AND possess a pistol or revolver, issued at any time pursuant
 to  this  section  or  prior  to the first day of July, nineteen hundred
 sixty-three and not previously revoked or cancelled, shall be  in  force
 and  effect until revoked as herein provided. Any license not previously
 cancelled or revoked shall remain in full force and  effect  for  thirty
 days  beyond the stated expiration date on such license. Any application
 to renew a license that has not  previously  expired,  been  revoked  or
 cancelled shall thereby extend the term of the license until disposition
 of  the  application  by the licensing officer. In the case of a license
 for gunsmith or dealer in firearms, in counties having a  population  of
 less than two hundred thousand inhabitants, photographs and fingerprints
 shall  be submitted on original applications and upon renewal thereafter
 at three year intervals. Upon satisfactory proof that a currently  valid
 original  license has been despoiled, lost or otherwise removed from the
 possession of the licensee and upon application containing an additional
 photograph of the licensee, the licensing officer shall issue  a  dupli-
 cate license.
  §  7. Subdivision 12 of section 400.00 of the penal law, as amended by
 chapter 207 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  12. Records required of gunsmiths and dealers in firearms. In addition
 to the requirements set forth in article thirty-nine-BB of  the  general
 business  law,  any  person  licensed  as gunsmith or dealer in firearms
 shall keep a record book approved as to form, except in the city of  New
 York, by the superintendent of state police. In the record book shall be
 entered  at  the time of every transaction involving a firearm the date,
 name, age, occupation and residence of any person from whom a firearm is
 received or to whom a firearm  is  delivered,  and  the  calibre,  make,
 model,  manufacturer's  name  and  serial  number, or if none, any other
 distinguishing number or identification mark  on  such  firearm.  Before
 delivering  a  firearm  to any person, the licensee shall require him to
 produce either a license valid under this  section  to  carry  [or]  AND
 possess  the  same,  or  proof  of  lawful authority as an exempt person
 pursuant to section 265.20 of this chapter and either (a)  the  National
 Instant  Criminal  Background  Check  System (NICS) or its successor has
 issued a "proceed" response to the licensee, or (b) thirty calendar days
 have elapsed since the date the licensee contacted NICS  to  initiate  a
 national instant criminal background check and NICS has not notified the
 licensee  that  the  transfer  of  the  firearm to such person should be
 S. 1703  6

 denied. In addition, before delivering a firearm to a peace officer, the
 licensee shall verify that person's status as a peace officer  with  the
 division  of  state police. After completing the foregoing, the licensee
 shall remove and retain the attached coupon and enter in the record book
 the  date  of  such  license,  number, if any, and name of the licensing
 officer, in the case of the holder  of  a  license  to  carry  [or]  AND
 possess,  or  the shield or other number, if any, assignment and depart-
 ment, unit or agency, in the case of  an  exempt  person.  The  original
 transaction  report  shall  be forwarded to the division of state police
 within ten days of delivering a firearm to any person, and  a  duplicate
 copy  shall  be kept by the licensee. The superintendent of state police
 may designate that such record shall be  completed  and  transmitted  in
 electronic form. A dealer may be granted a waiver from transmitting such
 records  in  electronic  form if the superintendent determines that such
 dealer is incapable of such transmission due  to  technological  limita-
 tions that are not reasonably within the control of the dealer, or other
 exceptional  circumstances  demonstrated  by  the  dealer, pursuant to a
 process established in regulation, and at the discretion of  the  super-
 intendent.  Records assembled or collected for purposes of inclusion in
 the database created pursuant to section 400.02 of  this  article  shall
 not be subject to disclosure pursuant to article six of the public offi-
 cers  law. The record book shall be maintained on the premises mentioned
 and described in the license and shall be open at all  reasonable  hours
 for  inspection  by  any  peace  officer, acting pursuant to his special
 duties, or police officer. In the event of cancellation or revocation of
 the license for gunsmith or dealer in  firearms,  or  discontinuance  of
 business  by  a  licensee, such record book shall be immediately surren-
 dered to the licensing officer in the city of New York, and in the coun-
 ties of Nassau and Suffolk, and elsewhere in the state to the  executive
 department, division of state police.
  §  8. Subdivision 14 of section 400.00 of the penal law, as amended by
 chapter 212 of the laws of 2022, is amended to read as follows:
  14. Fees. In the city of New York and the county of Nassau, the annual
 license fee shall be twenty-five dollars for gunsmiths and fifty dollars
 for dealers in firearms. In such city, the city council and in the coun-
 ty of Nassau the Board of Supervisors shall fix the fee  to  be  charged
 for  a  license  to  carry  [or]  AND possess a pistol or revolver or to
 purchase or take possession of a semiautomatic rifle and provide for the
 disposition of such fees. Elsewhere in the state, the licensing  officer
 shall  collect  and pay into the county treasury the following fees: for
 each license to carry [or] AND  possess  a  pistol  or  revolver  or  to
 purchase  or  take  possession  of  a semiautomatic rifle, not less than
 three dollars nor more than ten dollars as  may  be  determined  by  the
 legislative  body  of  the  county;  for  each  amendment thereto, three
 dollars, and five dollars in the county of Suffolk; and for each license
 issued to a gunsmith or dealer in firearms, ten dollars. The fee  for  a
 duplicate  license  shall  be  five  dollars.  The  fee for processing a
 license transfer between counties shall be five  dollars.  The  fee  for
 processing  a  license or renewal thereof for a qualified retired police
 officer as defined under subdivision thirty-four of section 1.20 of  the
 criminal procedure law, or a qualified retired sheriff, undersheriff, or
 deputy  sheriff of the city of New York as defined under subdivision two
 of section 2.10 of the criminal procedure law, or  a  qualified  retired

 retired  court clerk in the unified court system in the first and second
 judicial departments, as defined in paragraphs a and  b  of  subdivision
 twenty-one  of  section  2.10 of the criminal procedure law or a retired
 correction officer as defined in subdivision twenty-five of section 2.10
 of the criminal procedure law shall be waived in all counties throughout
 the state.
  § 9. This act shall take effect immediately and  shall  apply  to  all
 licenses held and issued on and after such date.
