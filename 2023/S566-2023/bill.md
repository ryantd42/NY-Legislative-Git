 Introduced by Sens. KAVANAGH, MANNION -- read twice and ordered printed,
  and  when  printed  to  be  committed  to  the  Committee  on Housing,
  Construction and Community Development
 
 AN ACT to amend the private housing finance law, in relation  to  estab-
  lishing the sustainable affordable housing incentive program

  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. The private housing finance law is amended by adding a  new
 article 32 to read as follows:
  ARTICLE XXXII
  SUSTAINABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVE PROGRAM
 SECTION 1290. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
  1291. DEFINITIONS.
  1292. SUSTAINABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INCENTIVE PROGRAM.
  § 1290. STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. THE LEGISLATURE
 FINDS  AND  DECLARES  THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT
 UPON OUR ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, AND SAFETY AND IT IS NECESSARY  TO  IMPLE-
 MENT  PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT IMMEDIATELY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMIS-
 SIONS. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER  FINDS  THAT  RESIDENTIAL  HOUSING  IS  A
 SOURCE  FOR  SUCH  EMISSIONS AND WE CAN ONLY ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IN A
 MEANINGFUL MANNER IF WE CHANGE  OUR  PRACTICES  AND  BEHAVIORS  AS  THEY
 RELATE  TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF AND IMPROVEMENTS TO SUCH HOUSING, SUCH AS
 THE USE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY-SENSITIVE DESIGN AND THE  CONSTRUCTION  PRAC-
 TICES  AND MATERIALS; THE INSTALLATION OF ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS; AND
 ACCESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES.  ESTABLISHING  A  NEW  PROGRAM  TO
 ENCOURAGE AND PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY PRACTICES
 AND MATERIALS WILL REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM MULTI-UNIT HOUS-
 ING THROUGHOUT NEW YORK STATE AND HELP ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE FOR FUTURE
 GENERATIONS.
  §  1291.  DEFINITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE, THE FOLLOWING
 TERMS SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANINGS:
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
