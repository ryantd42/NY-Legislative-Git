  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 7-13, 2023, as Fibromyalgia  Awareness  Week  in
  the State of New York
 
  WHEREAS, An estimated 10-12 million people in the United States, and
an  estimated 3-6 percent of the world's population, have been diagnosed
with Fibromyalgia, an illness for which there is yet no known  cause  or
cure; and
 
  WHEREAS,  A  chronic  syndrome that is increasing at alarming rates,
Fibromyalgia  causes  debilitating  widespread  pain  and  fatigue,  has
demonstrated a genetic component, and occurs in women, men, and children
of all ages and ethnicities; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Patients  with  Fibromyalgia  often  have  to  live  with
widespread  pain  throughout  their  bodies,  extreme  fatigue,  sleep
disorders,  digestive  difficulties,  stiffness  and  weakness, migraine
headaches,  numbness  and  tingling,  and  impairment  of  memory  and
concentration; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  average  gap  between  medical  research and clinical
practice is 17 years; and
 
  WHEREAS, It often takes an  average  of  five  years  to  receive  a
diagnosis of Fibromyalgia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  is  currently  no  database that maintains accurate
information regarding the prevalence of Fibromyalgia in New York  State,
or the United States; and
 
  WHEREAS, Many physicians refuse to treat Fibromyalgia patients whose
symptoms tend to increase with lack of appropriate treatments; and
 
  WHEREAS,  According  to  a  fact  sheet  provided  by  the  National
Fibromyalgia Association, 90% of physicians agree there is  a  need  for
more  physician-oriented  information,  and 82% of physicians agree that
Fibromyalgia is difficult to treat with the  tools  that  are  currently
available;  and  use  of  complementary  and alternative medicine is 2.5
times higher in Fibromyalgia patients; and
 
  WHEREAS, The NIH reports that average direct costs above  insurance,
over  a three-month period, added up to $951 per patient, which could be
translated in a mean annual cost of $3,804; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fibromyalgia  patients  are  often  misunderstood  by  the
medical,  business, and education communities, primarily due to the lack
of teaching in medical schools about what is currently  known  regarding
this potentially disabling illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Fibromyalgia  patients  often lose jobs, insurance, homes,
and  spouses  or  significant  others  due  to  lack  of  awareness  and
understanding  about the potentially devastating impact of Fibromyalgia;
and
 
 
  WHEREAS,  Patients  report  that  the  optimal  approach to treating
Fibromyalgia is a Team of Physicians, with traditional and complementary
therapists, tailoring the treatment for each  individual  patient;  this
can  be  accomplished  best  in  an  arrangement  that  facilitates
communication between the patient and the Team; and
 
  WHEREAS, The International Institute For Human Empowerment, Inc.,  a
nonprofit  charitable  organization in the Capital District of New York,
is dedicated to empowering all who face discrimination as  a  result  of
race,  gender,  socioeconomic  status,  age, disabilities, and lifestyle
choices; and
 
  WHEREAS, The International Institute For  Human  Empowerment,  Inc.,
under  the leadership of Sue Shipe, PhD, developed the Fibromyalgia Task
Force of New York State to  address  inequities  in  the  diagnosis  and
treatment  of  Fibromyalgia patients due to lack of education in medical
schools and continuing education for Physicians; lack  of  understanding
by  society  at large; lack of understanding and adequate accommodations
by employers; and lack of legal protections due to the general  lack  of
recognition of the devastating impact of this illness; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Fibromyalgia  Task  Force  of  New  York State serves
patients across the State of New York, provides education  and  advocacy
nationally, and shares information internationally; and
 
  WHEREAS, The Fibromyalgia Task Force of New York State is developing
a  website  for Physicians that will provide a comprehensive overview of
Fibromyalgia research with implications for new treatments,  information
on Social Security Disability, and use of complementary therapies; and
 
  WHEREAS,  The  Fibromyalgia  Task Force of New York State recommends
the  formation  of  a  statewide  committee  comprised  of  patients,
researchers, physicians, legislators, business, education, complementary
therapists, and others to address issues relevant to Fibromyalgia; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  Legislative  Body  recognizes  the  needs  of  those
chronically ill people who suffer from Fibromyalgia, and  urges  all  of
our  citizens to support the search for a cure and assist those families
who  deal  with  this  devastating  syndrome  on  a  daily  basis;  now,
therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
memorialize Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  7-13,  2023,  as
Fibromyalgia Awareness Week in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED,  That  copies  of  this Resolution, suitably engrossed, be
transmitted to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of  New
York;  International  Institute  For  Human  Empowerment, Inc.; Intidyn;
Albany Medical Center; New York  State  Department  of  Health;  Medical
Society  of  the  State  of  New  York; and SUNY at Albany Department of
Public Health.
