 equipment  and  electricity  exemption,  such  commercial  solar  energy
 systems  equipment and electricity exemption, commercial fuel cell elec-
 tricity generating systems equipment and electricity generated  by  such

 THE HOUSEKEEPING SUPPLIES EXEMPTION PROVIDED FOR IN PARAGRAPH FORTY-NINE
 OF  SUBDIVISION  (A)  OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF THIS CHAPTER,

 THE RESOLUTION DESCRIBED IN SUBDIVISION (S) OF THIS SECTION  OR  REPEALS
 SUCH RESOLUTION, SUCH RESOLUTION OR REPEAL SHALL ALSO BE DEEMED TO AMEND
 ANY  LOCAL  LAW, ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION ENACTED BY SUCH A CITY IMPOSING
 SUCH TAXES PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THIS SUBDIVISION, WHETHER OR NOT
 SUCH TAXES ARE SUSPENDED AT THE TIME SUCH  CITY  ENACTS  ITS  RESOLUTION
 PURSUANT  TO  SUBDIVISION  (S)  OF  THIS  SECTION OR AT THE TIME OF SUCH
 REPEAL; PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT ANY SUCH LOCAL LAW, ORDINANCE OR  RESOL-
 UTION  AND SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN OF THIS CHAPTER, AS DEEMED TO BE
 AMENDED IN THE EVENT A CITY OF ONE MILLION OR MORE ENACTS  A  RESOLUTION
 PURSUANT  TO  THE AUTHORITY OF SUBDIVISION (S) OF THIS SECTION, SHALL BE
 FURTHER AMENDED, AS PROVIDED IN SECTION TWELVE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN OF  THIS
 S. 3124  10
 
 SUBPART,  SO  THAT THE HOUSEKEEPING SUPPLIES EXEMPTION IN ANY SUCH LOCAL
 LAW, ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION OR IN SUCH SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN  OF
 THIS CHAPTER IS THE SAME AS THE HOUSEKEEPING SUPPLIES EXEMPTION IN PARA-
 GRAPH FORTY-NINE OF SUBDIVISION (A) OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN OF

 (kk) of section eleven hundred fifteen of  this  article  must  go  into
 effect  only  on  one  of  the following dates: March first, June first,
 September first or December first; provided, that a local law, ordinance
 or resolution providing for the exemption described in paragraph  thirty
 of  subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred fifteen of this chapter or
 repealing any such exemption or a local  law,  ordinance  or  resolution
 providing for a refund or credit described in subdivision (d) of section
 eleven  hundred  nineteen of this chapter or repealing such provision so
 provided must go into effect only on  March  first;  PROVIDED,  FURTHER,

 PROVIDED AND A RESOLUTION ENACTED PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY OF  SUBDIVI-
 SION  (S)  OF  THIS  SECTION  PROVIDING SUCH EXEMPTION OR REPEALING SUCH
 EXEMPTION SO PROVIDED MAY GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. No such local law,
 ordinance or resolution shall be effective unless a  certified  copy  of
 such  law,  ordinance or resolution is mailed by registered or certified
 mail to the commissioner at the commissioner's office in Albany at least
 ninety days prior to the date it is to become  effective.  However,  the
 commissioner  may  waive  and  reduce  such  ninety-day  minimum  notice
 requirement to a mailing of such certified copy by registered or  certi-
 fied  mail  within  a  period of not less than thirty days prior to such
 effective date if the commissioner deems such action  to  be  consistent
 with  the  commissioner's  duties  under section twelve hundred fifty of
 this  article  and  the  commissioner  acts  by  resolution.  Where  the
 restriction  provided for in section twelve hundred twenty-three of this
 article as to the effective date of a tax  and  the  notice  requirement
 provided  for  therein  are  applicable  and  have  not been waived, the
 restriction and notice requirement in  section  twelve  hundred  twenty-
 three of this article shall also apply.
