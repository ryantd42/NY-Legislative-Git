intent have made a substantial impact on the quality of  life  in  their
communities; and

commemorate the 10th Anniversary of Latino U College Access; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Latino U College Access (LUCA) is a nonprofit organization
that transforms lives by making college dreams a reality for low-income,
first-generation, Latino youth; and
 
  WHEREAS, Remaining true to its  mission,  Latino  U  College  Access
empowers  students  on their journeys to and through college so they can
fulfill their remarkable potential; and
 
  WHEREAS, Furthermore, this vital organization guides  students,  who

culturally  relevant  programming  to ensure they enroll in schools that
meet their financial and academic needs; and

  WHEREAS,  LUCA  was  founded in 2012 by Shirley Acevedo Buontempo to
address  the  inequity  first-generation  Latino  students  face  while
pursuing  their  college  dreams; Shirley experienced the transformative
power of education firsthand; born in Puerto  Rico,  she  moved  to  the
Bronx when she was ten years old; after navigating the school system and
learning  English,  she  was  the  first  in her family to graduate from
college; and
 
  WHEREAS, Over its distinguished 10-year history,  Latino  U  College
Access  has  demonstrated  continuous  service  to  the  residents  and
communities which it serves; and

correlation  to  the  efforts  of  its  dedicated  staff  and  Board  of
Directors, whose involvement is, and always has been,  characterized  by
an impressive commitment, an unbridled enthusiasm, and an uncompromising
standard  of  excellence  in all endeavors on behalf of the organization
and the community it serves; and
 
  WHEREAS, This auspicious occasion presents an opportunity  for  this
Legislative  Body  to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to Latino U College
Access; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is  the  custom  of  this  Legislative  Body  that  when
individuals and organizations of such noble aims and accomplishments are
brought  to  our  attention, they should be celebrated and recognized by
all the citizens of this great Empire State; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
commemorate the 10th Anniversary of Latino U College Access; and  be  it
further
