 president of the senate, and one member each appointed by  the  minority
 leader  of  the senate and the minority leader of the assembly. In addi-

 shall  provide  the governor and the legislature with recommendations on
 any changes that should be made in the definitions of income used in the
 various property tax relief programs authorized by the laws of the state

 such  laws and of such laws in other states. In preparing such recommen-
 dations, the tax reform study commission shall review the distributional
 impact of the items of income included in the  definition  of  household
 income for purposes of the circuit breaker and other property tax relief
 programs established by state law and make recommendations to the gover-
 nor and the legislature for any changes in any of these definitions that
 the  tax  reform study commission deems appropriate. The commissioner of
 taxation and finance and the director of the  office  of  real  property
 services  shall  provide  the tax reform study commission with such data
 and analysis as it may require.
