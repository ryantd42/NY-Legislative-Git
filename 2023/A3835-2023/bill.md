 AN ACT to amend the arts  and  cultural  affairs  law,  in  relation  to
  providing  financial  assistance  to museums, zoos, botanical gardens,
  aquariums and other cultural institutions located in low-income urban,
  suburban or rural communities, or that provide educational services to

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1. Statement of legislative findings and intent. The legisla-
 ture finds and declares that the state of  New  York  is  home  to  vast
 educational  resources in museums, historical societies, zoos, botanical
 gardens, aquaria and cultural arts institutions that offer a  wealth  of
 ways to engage children and adults and instill in them a lasting love of
 learning.
  The  legislature  finds that over 1,500 museums, historical societies,
 zoos, botanical gardens, aquaria and cultural arts institutions in  this
 state  now  provide  instruction  to over six million children, and that
 children in grades pre-kindergarten through twelve and  adults  enrolled
 in  continuing  education programs should have broad and equal access to
 such services.
  The legislature further finds  that  community  cultural  arts  insti-
 tutions, in collaboration with teachers and schools, must design new and
 innovative  programs  to  engage  learners  in  such  pressing issues as
 science, anthropology, history and arts literacy.
  It is the intent of the legislature that the state  provide  financial
 assistance  to cultural arts institutions serving under-resourced urban,
 suburban or rural communities to  expand  educational  services  through
 access  to  museum  collections,  scholarship  and  virtual learning and
