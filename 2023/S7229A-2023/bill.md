 to the provisions of this chapter and who has previously applied for  an
 absentee ballot shall be entitled to receive subsequent absentee ballots
 pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  section without making separate
 application for such absentee  ballot,  and  the  clerk  of  the  school
 district  or  a  designee  of the trustees or school board shall send an
 absentee ballot to such voter at [his] SUCH VOTER'S last  known  address

 return same in five days in the event that it cannot be delivered to the
 addressee. The clerk of the school district or a designee of  the  trus-
 tees  or  school board shall determine whether such ballot shall be sent
 by first class or by certified mail. All such ballots shall be mailed in
 the same manner as determined by the trustees or the board of education.
