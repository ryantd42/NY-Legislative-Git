 CAL DEPENDENCY DETOXIFICATION SERVICES SHALL HAVE A  MECHANISM  TO  LINK
 ALL  CLIENTS  RECEIVING DETOXIFICATION SERVICES TO ONGOING TREATMENT FOR
 CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY IMMEDIATELY UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR DETOXIFICA-
 TION; AND
  3. OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS THAT REQUIRE  THE  MAINTENANCE  OF  EXISTING
 CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY SERVICES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CHEMICAL DEPEND-
 ENCY SERVICES.

  (C)  FUNDS  SHALL  BE  DISTRIBUTED  PURSUANT  TO THIS SECTION TO LOCAL
 GOVERNMENTAL UNITS IN PROPORTION TO EACH UNIT'S UNMET NEED FOR  CHEMICAL
 DEPENDENCY TREATMENT SERVICES, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE OFFICE, EXCEPT THAT
 IN  DISTRIBUTING  SUCH FUNDS, THE COMMISSIONER SHALL CONSIDER THE EXTENT
 TO WHICH EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL UNIT HAS MAINTAINED LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS
 FOR EXPENDITURES OF CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY SERVICES MADE PURSUANT  TO  THIS
 SECTION  IN  ANY  FISCAL  YEAR  AT  A LEVEL EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE
 AMOUNT EXPENDED FOR SUCH  SERVICES BY SUCH LOCAL  GOVERNMENTAL  UNIT  IN
 THE LAST COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR PRECEDING THAT FISCAL YEAR.
  (D)  THE  COMMISSIONER IS AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED TO MAKE INSPECTIONS
 AND EXAMINE RECORDS OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL  UNIT  RECEIVING  STATE  AID

 FUNDS  FOR THE OFFICE SHALL BE DETERMINED IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET AND SHALL
 INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION REDUCTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE
 TO REDUCTIONS IN MEDICAL ASSISTANCE EXPENDITURES FOR  MEDICALLY  MANAGED
 CHEMICAL  DEPENDENCY DETOXIFICATION. SUCH REDUCTIONS SHALL BE CALCULATED
 BY COMPARING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE EXPENDITURES FOR MEDICALLY MANAGED CHEM-
 ICAL DEPENDENCY DETOXIFICATION IN THE BASE YEAR WITH THE  SAME  EXPENDI-
 TURES  IN THE STATE FISCAL YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE BASE YEAR. FOR
 PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE BASE YEAR SHALL BE THE STATE  FISCAL  YEAR
 IN  WHICH THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET IS ISSUED. IN COMPUTING SUCH GENERAL FUND
 EXPENDITURES, AND IN COMPUTING THE STATE  SHARE  OF  MEDICAL  ASSISTANCE
 PURSUANT  TO  THIS  SECTION,  THE  STATE  SHARE OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN
 EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST, TWO THOUSAND FIVE SHALL BE USED.
  (F) FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, THE DEFINITIONS CONTAINED IN SECTION

 INDIVIDUALS, LOCALITIES, PROVIDERS OR OTHERS,  INDIVIDUALLY  OR  COLLEC-
 TIVELY.
