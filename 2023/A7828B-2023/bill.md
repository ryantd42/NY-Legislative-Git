  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the  "New  York
 State American Freedmen Task Force on Reparations Remedies Act".
  §  2. Legislative intent. The Legislature makes the following findings
 and declarations:
  (a) Approximately 450,000+ Africans were trafficked  and  enslaved  in
 the  United  States  and the colonies that became the United States from
 1619 to 1865, inclusive.  At  the  peak  of  slavery  their  descendants
 numbered 4,000,000.
  (b)  The  institution  of slavery was constitutionally and statutorily
 sanctioned by the United States from 1776 through 1865, inclusive.
  (c) The chattel slavery that flourished in the United  States  consti-
 tuted  an  immoral  and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty,
 citizenship rights, and cultural heritage and denied them the fruits  of
 their own labor.

 A. 7828--A  2
 
  (d)  A  preponderance  of  scholarly, legal, and community evidentiary
 documentation, as well as popular culture markers, constitute the  basis
 for  inquiry  into the ongoing effects of the institution of slavery and
 its legacy embodied in persistent systemic structures of  discrimination
 on living descendants of persons enslaved in the United States, American
 Freedmen.
  (e)  Contrary  to  what  many  people  believe, slavery was not just a
 southern institution. Prior to the American Revolution, there were  more
 enslaved Africans in New York City than in any other city except Charle-
 ston,  South  Carolina.  During this period, slaves accounted for 20% of
 the population of New York and approximately 40% of  colonial  New  York
 households  owned  slaves. In 1799 the New York State Legislature passed
 "An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery". This  legislation  was  a
 first  step in the direction of emancipation but did not have an immedi-
 ate effect on or affect all enslaved people.  Rather,  it  provided  for
 gradual  manumission.  All children born to enslaved women after July 4,
 1799, would be freed, but only after their most productive years: age 28
 for men and age 25 for women.  Enslaved  persons  already  in  servitude
 before  July 4, 1799, were reclassified as "indentured servants", but in
 reality, remained enslaved for the duration of their lives. In 1817, the
 Legislature enacted a statute that gave freedom  to  New  York  enslaved
 people  who  had  been  born  before  July 4, 1799. This statute did not
 become effective until July 4, 1827, however, despite these laws,  there
 were  exceptions  under  which  certain  persons could still own slaves;
 non-residents could enter New York with slaves for up  to  nine  months,
 and  part-time  residents  were  allowed  to bring their slaves into the
 state temporarily. The  nine-month  exception  remained  law  until  its
 repeal in 1841 when the North was redefining itself as the "free" region
 in advance of the Civil War.
  (f)  Following  the abolition of slavery, the United States government
 at the  federal,  state,  and  local  levels  continued  to  perpetuate,
 condone,  and  often profit from practices that maintained brutalization
 and disadvantage for descendants  of  persons  enslaved  in  the  United
 States,  American  Freedmen,  including  but not limited to Black Codes,
 sharecropping, convict leasing,  Jim  Crow  laws,  lynching,  redlining,
 unequal education, etc.
  (g)  As a result of the badges and incidents of slavery, Jim Crow, and
 continued targeted discriminatory policy,  the  descendants  of  persons
 enslaved  in  the  United  States, American Freedmen, continue to suffer
 debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships.
  § 3. Definition. For the purposes  of  this  act,  the  term  American
 Freedmen  shall  mean  those persons who have at least one ancestor that
 was enslaved in the United States of America,  who  was  emancipated  in
 1863  by  way  of the Emancipation Proclamation or in 1865 by way of the
 13th Amendment to the Constitution, and have been despoiled their rights
 as citizens due to the badges, incidents and vestiges of slavery.
  § 4. Establishment, purpose, and duties of the task force. (a)  Estab-
 lishment. There is hereby established the New York State American Freed-
 men Task Force on Reparations Remedies, which may be referred to in this
 act as the "task force".
  (b) Duties. The task force shall perform the following duties:
  (i)  Study  the  current  condition  of  individuals  who descend from
 persons enslaved in the United States, American  Freedmen,  both  across
 the  nation, generally, and in the state of New York, specifically, as a
 result of:
 A. 7828--A  3
 
  (A) The de jure and de facto discrimination against American  Freedmen
 and  their  descendants  from  the  end of the Civil War to the present,
 including economic, political, educational, and social discrimination.
  (B)  The  lingering negative effects of the institution of slavery and
 discrimination on living descendants of persons enslaved in  the  United
 States, American Freedmen.
  (C)  The  manner in which instructional resources and technologies are
 being used to deny the inhumanity  of  slavery  and  the  crime  against
 humanity committed against descendants of persons enslaved in the United
 States, American Freedmen, in New York state and the United States.
  (D)  The  larger role of northern complicity in the disproportionately
 southern-based institution of slavery:
  1. The state of New York mercantile merchants profited immensely  from
 the  sale  of raw cotton to European mills transported from the southern
 states.
  2. New York businessmen  assisted  planters  in  purchasing  the  land
 slaves worked, and the tools they used to labor.
  3.  New York's textile industry specialized in the clothes slaves wore
 called "negro-cloth".
  4. New York manufactured whips that overseers wielded, the books  that
 planters read, and the finery plantation mistresses prized.
  5. New York lenders loaned money to allow planters to purchase slaves,
 and insurance to protect their investments.
  6.  New  York  invested  in  transatlantic, international, and coastal
 shipping lines that shipped between southern ports and New York.
  (E) The direct benefits of  slavery  and  discrimination  to  societal
 institutions, public and private, including higher education, corporate,
 religious, and associational.
  (ii)  Develop  reparations  remedies  from which New York ratified the
 U.S.  Constitution and entered the Union as the eleventh State in 1788.
  (iii) Recommend appropriate ways to educate the New York and  American
 public of the task force's findings.
  (iv)  Recommend  appropriate  remedies  in  consideration  of the task
 force's findings on the matters described in  this  section,  including,
 but not limited to:
  (A) Determine how the state of New York will offer a formal apology on
 behalf  of  the  people  of New York for the perpetration of gross human
 rights violations and crimes against humanity on individuals who descend
 from persons enslaved in the United States.
  (B) Document the injuries resulting from  matters  described  in  this
 subdivision  can  be  reversed  and how to provide appropriate policies,
 programs, projects, and recommendations for the purpose of  reversal  of
 the injuries.
  (C)  Propose the form and scope that measures should be taken from the
 task force's findings in consideration of the task force's findings, any
 other forms of recompense to descendants  of  persons  enslaved  in  the
 United  States,  American Freedmen are warranted and what form and scope
 those measures should take.
  (D) Draft a resolution on how the state of New York can  advocate  the
 adoption  of  a national plan for reparations for descendants of persons
 enslaved in the United States.
  (v) Submit a preliminary report of its findings to the legislature  no
 later  than  sixteen  months  after the date of the first meeting of the
 task force. The final report of its recommendations shall  be  submitted
 to  the  legislature no later than fourteen months after the preliminary
 report is submitted.
