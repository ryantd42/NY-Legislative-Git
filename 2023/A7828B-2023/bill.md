  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "New York
 State American Freedmen Equity Task Force on Reparations Remedies Act".
  § 2. Legislative intent. The Legislature makes the following  findings
 and declarations:
  (a)  Approximately  450,000+  Africans were trafficked and enslaved in
 the United States and the colonies that became the  United  States  from
 1619  to  1865,  inclusive.  At  the  peak  of slavery their descendants
 numbered 4,000,000.
  (b) The institution of slavery was  constitutionally  and  statutorily
 sanctioned by the United States from 1776 through 1865, inclusive.
  (c)  The  chattel slavery that flourished in the United States consti-
 tuted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of  Africans'  life,  liberty,
 citizenship  rights, and cultural heritage and denied them the fruits of
 their own labor.
  (d) A preponderance of scholarly,  legal,  and  community  evidentiary
 documentation,  as well as popular culture markers, constitute the basis
 for inquiry into the ongoing effects of the institution of  slavery  and

 its  legacy embodied in persistent systemic structures of discrimination
 on living descendants of persons enslaved in the United States, American
 freedmen, and society in the United States.
  (e)  Contrary  to  what  many  people  believe, slavery was not just a
 southern institution. Prior to the American Revolution, there were  more
 enslaved Africans in New York City than in any other city except Charle-
 ston,  South  Carolina.  During this period, slaves accounted for 20% of
 the population of New York and approximately 40% of  colonial  New  York
 households  owned  slaves. In 1799 the New York State Legislature passed
 "An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery". This  legislation  was  a
 first  step in the direction of emancipation but did not have an immedi-
 ate effect or affect all enslaved people. Rather, it provided for gradu-
 al manumission. All children born to enslaved women after July 4,  1799,
 would  be  freed, but only after their most productive years: age 28 for
 men and age 25 for women. Enslaved persons already in  servitude  before
 July  4, 1799, were reclassified as "indentured servants", but in reali-
 ty, remained enslaved for the duration of  their  lives.  In  1817,  the
 Legislature  enacted  a  statute  that gave freedom to New York enslaved
 people who had been born before July  4,  1799.  This  statute  did  not
 become  effective until July 4, 1827, however, despite these laws, there
 were exceptions under which certain  persons  could  still  own  slaves.
 Non-residents  could  enter  New York with slaves for up to nine months,
 and allowed part-time residents to bring their  slaves  into  the  state
 temporarily.  The  nine-month exception remained law until its repeal in
 1841 when the North was  redefining  itself  as  the  "free"  region  in
 advance of the Civil War.
  (f)  Following  the abolition of slavery, the United States government
 at the  federal,  state,  and  local  levels  continued  to  perpetuate,
 condone,  and  often profit from practices that maintained brutalization
 and disadvantage for African-American descendants of persons enslaved in
 the United States, American freedmen including, but not limited to Black
 Codes, sharecropping, convict leasing, Jim Crow laws, lynching,  redlin-
 ing, unequal education, etc.
  (g)  As a result of the badges and incidents of slavery, Jim Crow, and
 continued targeted discriminatory  policy,  African  Americans  who  are
 descendants  of persons enslaved in the United States, American freedmen
 continue to suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health  hard-
 ships, including, but not limited to, the following:
  (i) In New York state, more than half the prison population identifies
 as Black/African American. According to the 2020 census, the total Black
 population is only 12.4 percent.
  (ii)  An unemployment rate more than twice the current white unemploy-
 ment rate.
  (iii) An average of less than one-sixteenth of  the  wealth  of  white
 families, a disparity that has worsened, not improved, over time.
  (iv)  Covid-19  highlighted  existing  racial  health disparities with
 individuals who identify as Black/African American dying at a dispropor-
 tionately higher rate due to underlying conditions.
  § 3. Establishment, purpose, and duties of the task force. (a)  Estab-
 lishment. There is hereby established the New York State American Freed-
 men  Equity Task Force on Reparations Remedies, which may be referred to
 in this act as the "task force".
  (b) Duties. The task force shall perform the following duties:
  (i) Study the current condition of African Americans who descend  from
 persons enslaved in the United States, American freedmen both across the
 A. 7828  3
 
 nation,  generally,  and  in  the  state of New York, specifically, as a
 result of:
  (A)  The  de jure and de facto discrimination against freed slaves and
 their descendants from the end of the Civil War to the present,  includ-
 ing economic, political, educational, and social discrimination.
  (B)  The  lingering negative effects of the institution of slavery and
 discrimination  on  living  African-American  descendants  of  persons
 enslaved  in  the United States, American freedmen and on society in New
 York state and the United States.
  (C) The manner in which instructional resources and  technologies  are
 being  used  to  deny  the  inhumanity  of slavery and the crime against
 humanity  committed  against  African-American  descendants  of  persons
 enslaved  in  the United States, American freedmen in New York state and
 the United States.
  (D) The larger role of northern complicity in  the  disproportionately
 southern-based institution of slavery:
  1.  The state of New York mercantile merchants profited immensely from
 the sale of raw cotton to European mills transported from  the  southern
 states.
  2.  New  York  businessmen  assisted  planters  in purchasing the land
 slaves worked, and the tools they used to labor.
  3. New York's textile industry specialized in the clothes slaves  wore
 called "negro-cloth".
  4.  New York manufactured whips that overseers wielded, the books that
 planters read, and the finery plantation mistresses prized.
  5. New York lenders loaned money to allow planters to purchase slaves,
 and insurance to protect their investments.
  6. New York invested  in  transatlantic,  international,  and  coastal
 shipping lines that shipped between southern ports and New York.
  (E)  The  direct  benefits  of  slavery and discrimination to societal
 institutions, public and private, including higher education, corporate,
 religious, and associational.
  (ii) Develop reparations remedies from which  New  York  ratified  the
 U.S.  Constitution and entered the Union as the eleventh State in 1788.
  (iii)  Recommend appropriate ways to educate the New York and American
 public of the task force's findings.
  (iv) Recommend appropriate  remedies  in  consideration  of  the  task
 force's  findings  on  the matters described in this section, including,
 but not limited to:
  (A) How the state of New York will offer a formal apology on behalf of
 the people of New York  for  the  perpetration  of  gross  human  rights
 violations  and crimes against humanity on African Americans who descend
 from persons enslaved in the United States.
  (B) How to change New York laws and policies that continue to  dispro-
 portionately  and  negatively  affect  African-American  descendants  of
 persons enslaved in the United States, American freedmen as a group, and
 perpetuate the lingering material and psychosocial effects of slavery.
  (C) How the injuries resulting from matters described in this subdivi-
 sion can be reversed and how to provide appropriate policies,  programs,
 projects,  and  recommendations for the purpose of reversal of the inju-
 ries.
  (D) How in consideration of the task force's findings, any other forms
 of recompense to African American descendants of persons enslaved in the
 United States, American freedmen are warranted and what form  and  scope
 those measures should take.
 A. 7828  4
 
  (E)  How the state of New York can advocate the adoption of a national
 plan  for  reparations  for  African-American  descendants  of  persons
 enslaved in the United States, at the federal level of the United States
 government.
  (v)  Submit a preliminary report of its findings to the legislature no
 later than sixteen months after the date of the  first  meeting  of  the
 task  force.  The final report of its recommendations shall be submitted
 to the legislature no later than fourteen months after  the  preliminary
 report is submitted.
  (vi)  Designate  individuals who are African American descendants of a
