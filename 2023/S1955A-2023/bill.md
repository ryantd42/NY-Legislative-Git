 AN ACT to authorize Paul O'Brien to receive certain credit under section
  384-d of the retirement and social security law
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section  1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Paul O'Brien,
 currently a village of East Aurora police officer and member of the  New
 York  state  and  local  police  and  fire  retirement system covered by
 section 384-d of the retirement and social  security  law,  who  between
 September 18, 1995 and September 1, 2006 was employed by the Erie county
 sheriff's  department  where  he  was a member of the New York state and
 local employees' retirement system, and who, for reasons not  ascribable
 to  his  own  negligence,  was  not granted service credit under section
 384-d of the retirement and  social  security  law  for  his  period  of
 employment  with  the Erie county sheriff's department, shall be granted
 such service credit under section 384-d of  the  retirement  and  social
 security law and shall be entitled to the full rights and benefits asso-
 ciated  with  coverage  under  such  section, provided a request to that
 effect is filed with the state comptroller  within  one  year  from  the
 effective date of this act.
  § 2. All past service costs incurred in implementing the provisions of
 this act shall be borne by the village of East Aurora.
  § 3. This act shall take effect immediately.
  FISCAL NOTE.--Pursuant to Legislative Law, Section 50:
  This bill would grant service credit under section 384-d together with
 384-e  of  the  Retirement  and  Social  Security Law to Paul O'Brien, a
 current member of the New York State and Local Police and  Fire  Retire-
 ment  System  (NYSLPFRS) employed by the Village of East Aurora, for the
 period of September 18, 1995 through September  1,  2006,  during  which
 time  they  were employed as a deputy sheriff in Erie County. Currently,

 deputy sheriff service is  not  creditable  in  a  NYSLPFRS  twenty-year
 police retirement plan.
  If  this  bill  is  enacted during the 2023 legislative session, there
 will be an immediate past service cost of approximately  $429,000  which
 will  be borne by the Village of East Aurora as a one-time payment. This
 estimate assumes that payment will be made on February 1, 2024.
  This bill will not increase the future  annual  contributions  of  the
 Village of East Aurora.
  Paul  O'Brien must transfer their deputy sheriff service credit to the
 NYSLPFRS for service credit to be granted.
