 at  a  farm site which qualifies for the exemption under subdivision (g)
 of section three hundred one-b of this chapter); or (ii) a sale  to  the
 consumer consisting of not more than twenty gallons of water-white kero-
 sene  to be used and consumed exclusively for heating purposes; or (iii)
 the sale to or delivery at a filling station or other retail  vendor  of
 water-white  kerosene  provided  such  filling  station  or other retail
 vendor only sells such  water-white  kerosene  exclusively  for  heating
 purposes in containers of no more than twenty gallons; or (iv) a sale of
 kero-jet  fuel  to an airline for use in its airplanes or a use of kero-
