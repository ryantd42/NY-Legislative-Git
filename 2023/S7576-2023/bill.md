 ry and shall not be pensionable.
  § 3. Compensation for certain state officers and employees in  collec-
 tive  negotiating  units. 1.  The provisions of this section shall apply
 to annual-salaried officers and employees in the collective  negotiating
 unit  designated  as the professional, scientific and technical services
 unit established pursuant to article 14 of the civil service law.
  2. Effective March 30, 2023 for officers and employees on the adminis-
 trative payroll and effective April 6, 2023 for officers  and  employees

 period shall be increased by three percent adjusted to the nearest whole
 dollar amount.
  3. Effective March 28, 2024 for officers and employees on the adminis-
 trative  payroll  and effective April 4, 2024 for officers and employees

 S. 7576  5
 
 employees  in full-time employment status on the day before such payroll
 period shall be increased by three percent adjusted to the nearest whole
 dollar amount.
  4. Effective March 27, 2025 for officers and employees on the adminis-
 trative  payroll  and effective April 3, 2025 for officers and employees

 period shall be increased by three percent adjusted to the nearest whole
 dollar amount.
  5. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions two, three and  four
 of this section, if the basic annual salary of an officer or employee to
 whom  the  provisions of this section apply is identical with the hiring
 rate or the job rate of the salary grade of his or her position  on  the
 effective  dates  of  the increases provided in these subdivisions, such
 basic annual salary shall be increased to the hiring rate or  job  rate,
 respectively, of such salary grade as contained in the appropriate sala-
 ry schedules in subparagraphs 1, 2 and 3 of paragraph c of subdivision 1
 of section 130 of the civil service law, as added by section one of this
 act,  to take effect on the dates provided in such subparagraphs. Except
 as herein provided to the contrary, the increases in basic annual salary
 provided by this subdivision shall be in lieu of any increase  in  basic
 annual  salary  provided for in subdivisions two, three and four of this
 section.
  6. Payments pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 6 of section 131
 of the civil service law for  annual  salaried  officers  and  employees
 entitled  to  such payments to whom the provisions of this section apply
 shall be payable in accordance with the terms of  an  agreement  reached
 pursuant to article 14 of the civil service law between the state and an
 employee  organization  representing employees subject to the provisions
 of this section.
  7. If an unencumbered position is one which if  encumbered,  would  be
 subject  to  the provisions of this section, the salary of such position
 shall be increased by the salary  increase  amounts  specified  in  this
 section.  If  a position is created, and filled by the appointment of an
 officer or employee who is subject to the provisions  of  this  section,
 the  salary  otherwise  provided for such position shall be increased in
 the same manner as though such position had been in existence but  unen-
 cumbered.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the director
 of the budget may reduce the salary of any such  position  which  is  or
 becomes vacant.
  8.  The  increases  in  salary provided in subdivisions two, three and
 four of this section shall apply on a pro-rated basis  to  officers  and
 employees,  otherwise eligible to receive an increase in salary, who are
 paid on an hourly or per diem basis, employees serving on a part-time or
 seasonal basis, and employees paid on any basis other than at an  annual
 salary  rate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of subdivi-
 sions five, six and thirteen of this section shall not apply to  employ-
 ees serving on a per diem or seasonal basis, except as determined by the
 director of the budget.
  9.  In  order  to  provide for the officers and employees to whom this
 section applies but are not allocated to salary grades, but are paid  on
 an annual basis, increases and payments pursuant to subdivisions six and
 thirteen  of  this section in proportion to those provided to persons to
 whom this section applies who are allocated to salary grades, the direc-
 tor of the budget is authorized to add  appropriate  adjustments  and/or
 payments  to  the  compensation  which  such  officers and employees are
 S. 7576  6
 
 otherwise entitled to receive. The director of the  budget  shall  issue
 certificates which shall contain schedules of positions and the salaries
 and/or  payments  thereof for which adjustments and/or payments are made
 pursuant  to the provisions of this subdivision, and a copy of each such
 certificate shall be filed with the state comptroller, the department of
 civil service, the chair of the senate finance committee and  the  chair
 of the assembly ways and means committee.
  10.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  section,  the
 provisions of this section shall not apply to officers or employees paid
 on a fee schedule basis, provided however, that the increases  in  basic
 annual  salary  provided for in subdivisions two, three and four of this
 section shall apply to fire instructors paid on  a  fee  schedule  basis
 employed by the division of homeland security and emergency services.
  11. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, except subdi-
 vision one of this section, any increase in compensation for any officer
 or  employee  appointed  to  a lower graded position from a redeployment
 list pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 79 of the  civil  service  law
 who  continues  to  receive  his  or  her former salary pursuant to such
 subdivision shall be determined on the basis of such lower graded  posi-
 tion  provided,  however,  that  the increase in salary provided in this
 section shall not cause such officer's or employee's  salary  to  exceed
 the job rate of such lower graded position.
  12.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or any law to
 the contrary, any increase in compensation may be withheld in  whole  or
 in  part  from  any  employee to whom the provisions of this section are
 applicable when, in the opinion of the director of the  budget  and  the
 director of employee relations, such increase is not warranted or is not
 appropriate for any reason.
  13. Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, offi-
 cers  and  employees  to whom the provisions of this section apply shall
 receive performance awards in accordance with the terms of a collective-
 ly negotiated agreement between the state and the employee  organization
 representing  such  employees entered into pursuant to article 14 of the
 civil service law, effective for the period commencing April 2, 2023, in
 accordance with the rules and regulations issued by the director of  the
 budget to implement payment of such negotiated performance awards.
  §  4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when, in the profes-
 sional, scientific and technical services unit, a determination has been
 implemented to increase the hiring rate of a position in accordance with
 subdivision 4 of section 130 of the civil  service  law,  incumbents  of
 such  positions who are employed in any state department, state institu-
 tion or other state agency, in the particular area or areas or  location
 or locations affected, who did not receive the benefit of the new hiring
 salary  or  have their salaries brought up to such new hiring salary may
 receive increased compensation as determined by an agreement between the
 office of employee relations and the employee organization  representing
 such unit.
  §  5.  For  employees  in  the  professional, scientific and technical
 services unit, a one-time $3,000 signing  bonus  will  be  paid  to  all
 eligible  members  of  the unit. This signing bonus is not part of basic
 annual salary. Similarly, the signing bonus is not subject to any salary
 increases and is not pensionable. The signing bonus shall  be  pro-rated
 for  those  employees  paid  on  any  basis  other than an annual basis.
 Employees paid on a part-time, hourly or per diem basis shall receive  a
 signing  bonus  pro-rated  on a basis reflecting the actual hours worked
 between June 6, 2023 and October 12, 2023 for officers and employees  on
 S. 7576  7
 
 the  administrative payroll or October 19, 2023 for officers and employ-
 ees on the institutional payroll.  To  qualify,  employees  must  be  in
 continuous service in the PS&T Unit between June 6, 2023 and October 12,
 2023 for officers and employees on the administrative payroll or October
 19,  2023  for  officers  and  employees on the institutional payroll as
 defined by paragraph c of subdivision 3 of  section  130  of  the  civil
 service  law.  Employees who separate from state service between June 6,
 2023 and October 12 or October 19, 2023, respectively, are not  eligible
 for  this  signing  bonus  unless they retire directly from active state
 employment. This bonus shall be effective October 12, 2023 for  officers
 and  employees  on  the administrative payroll and effective October 19,
 2023 for officers and employees on the institutional payroll.
  § 6. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, where an agreement
 between the state and the employee organization that represents  employ-
 ees  in  the  professional,  scientific  and  technical services unit so
 provides, there shall be paid a higher education differential consistent
 with the terms of such agreement.
  § 7. Location compensation for certain state officers  and  employees.
 Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of law, officers and employ-
 ees,  including  seasonal  officers  and employees who shall continue to
 receive the compensation provided for pursuant  to  this  section  on  a
 pro-rated  basis except part-time officers and employees, in the collec-
 tive negotiating unit designated as  the  professional,  scientific  and
 technical  services unit established pursuant to article 14 of the civil
 service law, whose principal place of employment or, in the  case  of  a
 field  employee, whose official station as determined in accordance with
 the regulations of the state comptroller, is located: in the  county  of
 Monroe  and who were eligible to receive location pay on March 31, 1985,
 shall receive location pay at the rate of $200 per  year  provided  they
 continue to be otherwise eligible; or in the city of New York, or in the
 county  of  Rockland,  Westchester,  Nassau or Suffolk shall continue to

 April  2,  2023,  where  and to the extent that an agreement between the
 state and an employee organization entered into pursuant to  article  14
 of  the  civil service law so provides on behalf of certain employees in

 a uniform or receives a regular uniform service.  Such uniform allowance
 will cease to exist on April 1, 2026, unless an extension is  negotiated
 S. 7576  10
 
 by  the parties. Such lump sum shall be considered salary only for final
 average salary purposes.

 implemented  until  the director of employee relations shall have deliv-
 ered to the director of the budget and the state  comptroller  a  letter
 certifying that there is in effect with respect to such negotiating unit
 a  collectively  negotiated agreement, ratified by the membership, which
 provides for such  increases  and  modifications  and  which  are  fully
 executed  in  writing with the state pursuant to article 14 of the civil
 service law.
  § 19. Date of entitlement to  salary  increases.  Notwithstanding  the
 provisions of this act or of any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the  increases  in  salary or compensation to employees provided by this
 act shall be added to the salary of such employee at  the  beginning  of
 that  payroll period, the first day of which is nearest to the effective
 dates of such increases as provided in this act, or at the beginning  of
 the  earlier of two payroll periods, the first days of which are nearest
 but equally near to the effective dates of such increases as provided in
 this act; provided, however, that, for the purposes of  determining  the
 salary  of  such  unit  members  upon  reclassification,  reallocation,
 appointment, promotion,  transfer,  demotion,  reinstatement,  or  other
 change  of status, such salary increases shall be deemed to be effective
 on the dates thereof as prescribed by this  act,  with  payment  thereof
 pursuant  to  this  section  on a date prior thereto, instead of on such
 effective dates, and shall not operate to confer any  additional  salary
 rights  or  benefits  on  such  unit  members.  Payment of such salary
 increases may be deferred pursuant to section twenty of this act.
  §  20.  Deferred  payment  of  salary  increase.  Notwithstanding  the
 provisions  of  any  other section of this act or any other provision of
 law to the contrary, pending payment pursuant to this act of  the  basic
 annual  salaries  of  incumbents  of positions subject to this act, such
 incumbents shall receive, as partial compensation for services rendered,
 the rate of salary and other compensation  otherwise  payable  in  their
 respective  positions.  An  incumbent holding a position subject to this
 act at any time during the period from April 1,  2023,  until  the  time
 when  basic  annual  salaries  and other compensation due are first paid
 pursuant to this act for such services in excess of the salary and other
 compensation actually received therefor, shall be entitled to a lump sum
 payment for the difference between the salary and other compensation  to
 which  such  incumbent  is entitled for such services and the salary and
 other compensation actually received pursuant to the terms of an  agree-
 ment  between  the  state and the employee organization representing the
 employees covered by this act.

 any state department or agency from any  appropriation  or  other  funds
 S. 7576  11
 
 available to such state department or agency for personal service or for
 other  related  employee benefits during such fiscal year. To the extent
 that such appropriations are insufficient in any fund to accomplish  the
 purposes  herein  set forth, the director of the budget is authorized to
 allocate to the various departments and  agencies,  from  any  appropri-
 ations available in any fund, the amounts necessary to pay such amounts.
 The  aforementioned appropriations shall be available for payment of any
 liabilities or obligations incurred prior to April 1, 2023  in  addition
 to current liabilities.
  §  22.  Effect of participation in special annuity program. No officer
 or employee participating in a special annuity program pursuant  to  the
 provisions  of  article  8-C of the education law shall, by reason of an
 increase in compensation pursuant to this act, suffer any  reduction  of
 the  salary adjustment to which he or she would otherwise be entitled by
 reason of participation in such  program,  and  such  salary  adjustment
 shall  be  based  upon  the  salary  of such officer or employee without
 regard to the reduction authorized by such article.
  § 23. Notwithstanding any provision of the state finance  law  or  any
 other provision of law to the contrary, the sum of $414,000,000 is here-
 by  appropriated  in  the general fund/state purposes account (10050) in
 miscellaneous-all  state  departments  and  agencies  solely  for
 apportionment/transfer  by  the  director  of  the budget for use by any

 provided in this act, provided, however, that for the purposes of deter-
 mining the salary of such officer  or  employee  upon  reclassification,
 reallocation,  appointment, promotion, transfer, demotion, reinstatement
 or other change of status, such salary increase shall be  deemed  to  be
 effective on the date thereof as prescribed in this act, and the payment

 rights  or benefits on such officer or employee.  Payment of such salary
 increase may be deferred pursuant to section fifteen of this act.

 provisions  of  any  other section of this act or any other provision of

 ations available in any fund, the amounts necessary to pay such amounts.
 The  aforementioned appropriations shall be available for payment of any
 liabilities or obligations incurred prior to April 1, 2023  in  addition
 to current liabilities.
