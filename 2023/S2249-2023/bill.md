  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (e) of subdivision 6 of section 202

 chapter  17 of the laws of 1984 and paragraphs (b) and (e) as amended by
 chapter 483 of the laws of 1988, are amended to read as follows:
  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law,  if  an  agency  finds
 that  the immediate adoption of a rule is necessary for the preservation
 of the public health, safety or general welfare and that compliance with
 the requirements of subdivision one of this section would be contrary to
 the public interest, the agency may dispense with all or  part  of  such
 requirements  and  adopt  the rule on an emergency basis EXCEPT WHEN THE
 RULE TO BE ADOPTED IS AN EXISTING ADOPTED EMERGENCY REGULATION, IN WHICH
 CASE THE AGENCY  MAY  NOT  DISPENSE  WITH  THE  REQUIREMENTS  THAT  SUCH
 READOPTION BE APPROVED BY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY.
  (b)  Unless  otherwise  provided by law, such emergency rule shall not
 remain in effect for longer than ninety days after being filed with  the
 secretary  of state unless within such time the agency complies with the
 requirements of subdivision one of this  section  and  adopts  the  rule
 pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  subdivision  five  of  this  section,
 provided, however, if AN AGENCY DETERMINES THE READOPTION OF  SUCH  RULE
 IS  NECESSARY  ON  AN EMERGENCY BASIS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PUBLIC
 HEALTH, SAFETY AND GENERAL WELFARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE  REQUIREMENTS
 OF  SUBDIVISION  ONE  OF  THIS  SECTION  WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE PUBLIC
 INTEREST, THEN THE READOPTION OF SUCH RULE SHALL REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF
 
  EXPLANATION--Matter in ITALICS (underscored) is new; matter in brackets
  [ ] is old law to be omitted.

 rule is readopted prior to the expiration of such ninety day period such
 readoption  and any subsequent readoptions shall remain in effect for no
 longer than [sixty] THIRTY days.
  (e)  If,  prior  to the expiration of a rule adopted pursuant to para-
 graph (a) of this subdivision, the agency finds that the  readoption  of
 such rule on an emergency basis is necessary for the preservation of the
 public  health,  safety  or  general welfare, the agency may readopt the
 rule on an emergency basis UPON APPROVAL BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY.  No
 readoption  shall be filed with the secretary of state unless the agency

 one  of this section AND SUCH READOPTION HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE SENATE

 subdivision five of this section AND SUCH SUBSEQUENT READOPTION HAS BEEN
 APPROVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY.
  § 2.  This act shall take effect immediately.
