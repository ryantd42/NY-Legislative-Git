  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  April 2023, as Cesarean Awareness Month in the State
  of New York
 
  WHEREAS, It is the custom of  this  Legislative  Body  to  recognize
official  months  that  are  set  aside  to increase awareness of health
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS, Attendant to such concern, and  in  full  accord  with  its
long-standing  traditions,  this  Legislative  Body  is  justly proud to
memorialize Governor Kathy Hochul to proclaim April  2023,  as  Cesarean
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and
 
  WHEREAS, Women who undergo cesarean surgery may have a long recovery
time,  and  are  subject  to  complications  such  as increased rates of
unexplained stillbirth, placental abnormalities,  and  uterine  rupture;
and
 
  WHEREAS,  While  a  cesarean  can be lifesaving for a mother and her
baby in certain circumstances, maternal and child health are improved by
preventing unnecessary cesareans; and
 
  WHEREAS, Women from the State of New York should have access to full
and complete information on the risks and benefits of vaginal birth  and
cesarean  section  in  order to make informed choices about their health
care; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is imperative that there be greater  awareness  of  this
health  issue,  and more must be done to increase activity at the local,
State and National levels; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim April 2023, as Cesarean
Awareness Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
