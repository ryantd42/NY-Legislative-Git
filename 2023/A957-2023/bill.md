  THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-

  Section 1. Section 2855 of the public authorities  law,  as  added  by
 section  1  of  part KK of chapter 59 of the laws of 2006, is amended to
 read as follows:
  § 2855. Electronic method of payment[; periodic charges]. 1.  Notwith-
 standing  the  provisions  of  any law to the contrary, if any authority
 shall offer any electronic method of payment  for  tolls,  fares,  fees,
 rentals,  or other charges, including but not limited to a system called
 E-ZPass, such authority shall not impose any periodic administrative  or
 other  charge  for  the  privilege  of  using  such electronic method of
 payment for such charges. Nothing in this section shall be construed  to
 prohibit  any  authority  from  making  any  charge  for  extra services
 requested by a holder of such electronic method of payment,  any  charge
 for  lost  or  damaged  equipment,  or for defaults, such as charges for
 dishonored checks. The authority shall  not  enter  any  agreement  with
 bondholders that would require the imposition of administrative or other
 periodic charges relating to electronic methods of payment prohibited by
 this section.
  2.  NOTWITHSTANDING  THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LAW TO THE CONTRARY, IF ANY
 AUTHORITY SHALL OFFER SUCH  ELECTRONIC  METHOD  OF  PAYMENT  FOR  TOLLS,
 FARES,  FEES,  RENTALS, OR OTHER CHARGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A
 SYSTEM CALLED E-ZPASS, SUCH AUTHORITY SHALL TRANSMIT ELECTRONIC  NOTIFI-
 CATION  PURSUANT  TO  THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION TO A CUSTOMER THAT
 PASSES THROUGH A TOLL PLAZA OPERATED BY THE AUTHORITY, PROVIDED THAT THE
 CUSTOMER HAS AN ACCOUNT FOR THE ELECTRONIC TOLL COLLECTION  SYSTEM  THAT
