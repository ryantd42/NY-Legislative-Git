 such person, firm or corporation obtain any other or additional authori-
 ty, approval, permit or certificate from such municipality  in  relation

 enforcement thereof; nor shall any municipality have  power  to  require

 successor in interest thereto, to obtain any other or additional author-
 ity, approval, permit, certificate or certificate of occupancy from such
 municipality as a condition of owning, using, maintaining, operating  or
 occupying  any  project  acquired, constructed, reconstructed, rehabili-
 tated, altered or improved by the corporation or by any subsidiary ther-
 eof. The foregoing provisions shall not preclude any  municipality  from
 exercising  the right of inspection for the purpose of requiring compli-
 ance by any such project with local requirements for operation and main-
 tenance, affecting the health, safety and welfare of the occupants ther-
 eof, provided, however, that such compliance does not  require  changes,
 modifications or additions to the original construction of such project.

 limited to a county, city, town,  village  or  district,  in  which  any
 project  of  the  corporation  or  of any subsidiary thereof is located,

 any  subsidiary  thereof  or  any successor in interest thereto, police,
 fire, sanitation, health protection and other municipal services of  the

 dents of such municipality or political subdivision.

 upon by such municipality or such  public  corporation  and  the  corpo-
 ration.  No agreement for such purchase or lease shall be deemed to be a
 contract  for  public work or purchase within the meaning of the general
 municipal law. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be deemed  to
 amend  or  supersede  any other provision of law requiring a vote of the
 qualified voters of any school district upon a proposed  expenditure  of
 funds or incurring of indebtedness by such school district.
  (6)  In carrying out any project, the corporation and its subsidiaries
 shall be empowered to enter into  contractual  agreements  with  munici-
 palities  and  public corporations with respect to the furnishing of any
 community, municipal or  public  facilities  or  services  necessary  or
 desirable  for  such project, and any municipality or public corporation
 is hereby authorized and empowered, notwithstanding any  other  law,  to
 enter  into  such  contractual  agreements  with the corporation and its
 subsidiaries and to do all things necessary to carry out its obligations
 under the same.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
