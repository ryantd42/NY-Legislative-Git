 depreciation costs of such construction. The rates  shall  also  reflect
 the  efficient  provision  of  a  quality  and  quantity  of services to
 patients in such residential health care facilities, with needs compara-
 ble to the needs of residents served in such assisted  living  programs.
 Such  rates  of  payment  shall be equal to fifty percent of the amounts
 which otherwise would have been expended, based upon the  [mean  prices]

 to  provide the appropriate level of care for such residents in residen-
 tial health care facilities in the applicable wage  equalization  factor
 regions  plus  an  amount equal to capital construction costs associated

 gency regulations, to provide for reimbursement of the cost of preadmis-
 sion assessments conducted directly by assisted living programs.
