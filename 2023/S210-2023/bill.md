 S. 210  3
 
  § 2. Subdivision 3 of section 70.30 of the penal law,  as  amended  by
 chapter 3 of the laws of 1995, the opening paragraph as amended by chap-
 ter 1 of the laws of 1998, is amended to read as follows:
  3. Jail time. The term of a definite sentence, a determinate sentence,
 or  the  maximum  term  of an indeterminate sentence imposed on a person
 shall be credited with and diminished by the amount of time  the  person
 spent  in custody prior to the commencement of such sentence as a result
 of the charge that culminated in the sentence. In the case of  an  inde-
 terminate sentence, if the minimum period of imprisonment has been fixed
 by the court or by the board of parole, the credit shall also be applied
 against  the  minimum period. The credit herein provided shall be calcu-
 lated from the date custody under the charge commenced to the  date  the
 sentence  commences  and  shall  not  include  any time that is credited
 against the term or maximum term of any previously imposed  sentence  or
 period  of  post-release supervision to which the person is subject. THE
 CREDIT HEREIN PROVIDED SHALL ALSO  INCLUDE  ANY  ADDITIONAL  MERIT  TIME
 ALLOWANCE  CREDIT  ACCRUED  IN A LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY PURSUANT TO
 ARTICLE TWENTY-FOUR-A OF THE CORRECTION LAW. Where the charge or charges
 culminate in more than one sentence, the  credit  shall  be  applied  as
 follows:
  (a)  If  the  sentences  run concurrently, the credit shall be applied
 against each such sentence;
  (b) If the sentences run consecutively, the credit  shall  be  applied
 against  the  aggregate  term or aggregate maximum term of the sentences
 and against the aggregate minimum period of imprisonment.
  In any case where a person has been in custody due to  a  charge  that
 culminated in a dismissal or an acquittal, the amount of time that would
 have  been  credited  against  a  sentence for such charge, had one been
 imposed, shall be credited against any  sentence  that  is  based  on  a
 charge  for which a warrant or commitment was lodged during the pendency
 of such custody.
  § 3. Subdivision 3 of section 70.30 of the penal law,  as  amended  by
 chapter  648  of  the  laws of 1979, the opening paragraph as separately
 amended by chapter 1 of the laws of 1998, is amended to read as follows:
  3. Jail time. The term of a definite sentence or the maximum  term  of
 an indeterminate sentence imposed on a person shall be credited with and
 diminished  by  the  amount of time the person spent in custody prior to
 the commencement of such sentence as a result of the charge that  culmi-
 nated  in the sentence. In the case of an indeterminate sentence, if the
 minimum period of imprisonment has been fixed by the  court  or  by  the
 board  of  parole,  the credit shall also be applied against the minimum
 period. The credit herein provided shall be  calculated  from  the  date
 custody  under  the  charge commenced to the date the sentence commences
 and shall not include any time that is  credited  against  the  term  or
 maximum  term  of  any previously imposed sentence or period of post-re-
 lease supervision to which the person is subject.  THE  CREDIT  HEREIN
 PROVIDED  SHALL  ALSO INCLUDE ANY ADDITIONAL MERIT TIME ALLOWANCE CREDIT
 ACCRUED IN A LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY  PURSUANT  TO  ARTICLE  TWENTY-
 FOUR-A  OF  THE CORRECTION LAW. Where the charge or charges culminate in
 more than one sentence, the credit shall be applied as follows:
  (a) If the sentences run concurrently, the  credit  shall  be  applied
 against each such sentence;
  (b)  If  the  sentences run consecutively, the credit shall be applied
 against the aggregate term or aggregate maximum term  of  the  sentences
 and against the aggregate minimum period of imprisonment.
 S. 210  4
 
  In  any  case  where a person has been in custody due to a charge that
 culminated in a dismissal or an acquittal, the amount of time that would
 have been credited against a sentence for  such  charge,  had  one  been
 imposed,  shall  be  credited  against  any  sentence that is based on a
 charge  for which a warrant or commitment was lodged during the pendency
 of such custody.
  § 4. This act shall take effect on the first of November next succeed-
 ing the date on which it shall have become  a  law;  provided  that  the
 amendments  to  subdivision  3 of section 70.30 of the penal law made by
 section two of this act shall be subject to the expiration and reversion
 of such subdivision pursuant to subdivision d of section 74 of chapter 3
 of the laws of 1995, as amended, when upon such date the  provisions  of
