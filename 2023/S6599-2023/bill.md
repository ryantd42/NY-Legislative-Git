  in the town of Mount Pleasant
 
  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
 the assessor of Mount Pleasant is hereby authorized to accept from Spec-
 trum  Designs  Foundation  Ltd.  an  application for exemption from real
 property taxes pursuant to section 420-a of the real  property  tax  law
 for  a  portion of the 2021-2022 school tax, all of the 2022-2023 school
 tax, and all of the 2021-2022 general tax roll, for the  parcel  located
 at  199  Tompkins Avenue, Village of Pleasantville, town of Mount Pleas-
 ant, County of Westchester otherwise known as Westchester County  parcel
 ID  section  106.10 Block 3 Lot 1. If accepted, the application shall be
 reviewed as if it had been received on  or  before  the  taxable  status
 dates  established  for  such  assessment  rolls. If satisfied that such
 organization would otherwise be  entitled  to  such  exemption  if  such
 organization  had  filed an application for exemption by the appropriate
 taxable status dates, the assessor, upon approval by the town  board  of
 Mount  Pleasant,  may make appropriate corrections to the subject rolls.
 If such exemption is granted and such organization therefore, shall have
 paid any tax with respect to the subject rolls, the  governing  body  or
 tax  department  may,  in its sole discretion, provide for the refund of
 those taxes paid and cancel any taxes, fines, penalties, interest or tax
 liens remaining unpaid.
  § 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
