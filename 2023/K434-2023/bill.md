  MEMORIALIZING  Governor  Kathy  Hochul to proclaim
  May 2023, as Teen Self-Esteem Month in the State  of
  New York
 
  WHEREAS,  It  is  the  custom  of this Legislative Body to recognize
official months that are set aside  to  increase  awareness  of  serious
issues that affect the lives of citizens of New York State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, it is the sense of this  Legislative  Body  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Teen
Self-Esteem Month in the State of New  York,  in  conjunction  with  the
observance of National Teen Self-Esteem Month; and
 
  WHEREAS, Low self-esteem can lead to serious problems in teens, such
as  depression  and eating disorders; it is imperative to help teenagers
voice their needs, share perspectives  and  build  healthy  outlooks  on
themselves; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Open  lines of communication between parents, teachers and
teens can significantly increase their self-esteem; listening and taking
interest  in  their  lives,  along  with  avoiding  negative  talk  will
encourage pride and respect within their formative years; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Additionally,  bullying  and  teasing are issues which can
lead to low self-esteem, furthering the importance  of  adults  praising
teens more than scolding them; and
 
  WHEREAS,  There  are  several tangible and profound ways in which we
can help our teens, such as encouraging them to  be  active,  persuading
them to try something new, helping them to nurture friendships, tackling
to do lists and helping them to identify things in which they excel; and
 
  WHEREAS,  It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of
this serious issue, and more must be  done  to  increase  knowledge  and
attentiveness  at both the state and local levels to support and protect
our youth, our most precious resource; now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED, That this Legislative Body pause in its  deliberations  to
memorialize  Governor  Kathy  Hochul  to  proclaim  May  2023,  as  Teen
Self-Esteem Month in the State of New York; and be it further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
transmitted  to The Honorable Kathy Hochul, Governor of the State of New
York.
