  Committee on Local Governments
 
 AN ACT to amend to the general municipal law, in relation to prohibiting
  the siting of battery energy storage system sites in assembly district

  THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND  ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
  Section 1. Legislative intent. It is the intent of this legislature to
 protect New York state from the adverse effects of the siting of battery
 energy storage systems and related facilities and infrastructure in most
 instances,  including  but  not limited to air pollution and the risk of
 explosions. The cumulative impact of spewing toxic fumes  into  the  air
 and  the  potential  for  explosions  in  such close proximity to homes,
 schools,  churches,  playgrounds,  and  small  businesses  would  prompt
 extremely  negative effects on the public health and safety of the local
 community.
  The legislature hereby determines that the public interest requires  a
 prohibition  on the siting of battery energy storage systems and related
 facilities  and  infrastructure  in  assembly  district  64,  in  most
 instances.
  §  2. The general municipal law is amended by adding a new section 137
 to read as follows:

 BATTERY  OR  AN  ELECTRIC MOTOR VEHICLE. A BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM
 SHALL BE CLASSIFIED AS A TIER ONE OR TIER  TWO  BATTERY  ENERGY  STORAGE

  2. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW, RULE, OR REGULATION TO THE CONTRARY,
 THE FUTURE SITING AND CONSTRUCTION OF BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS AND
 RELATED FACILITIES, SYSTEMS,  INFRASTRUCTURE,  AND  SUBSTATIONS  OF  ANY
 SCALE AND POSSESSING ANY STORAGE CAPACITY AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
