 BE DONE THROUGH A PROCESS WHEREBY A LIST OF RANDOMLY SELECTED, APPROPRI-
 ATE  MEDICAL  OR  PROFESSIONAL  HEALTH  SERVICE PROVIDERS IS COMPILED BY
 GEOGRAPHIC REGION THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND  PROVIDED  TO  THE  INSURANCE

 EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO REJECT NO MORE THAN TWO NAMES OFF SUCH LIST  BEFORE
 THE  NEXT  AVAILABLE UTILIZATION REVIEW AGENT ON THE LIST IS SELECTED TO
 CONDUCT THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION OR REVIEW OF MEDICAL  RECORDS.  WHERE  A
 PERSON  IS  REJECTED  BY EITHER PARTY SUCH NAME SHALL HOWEVER RETAIN ITS
 PLACE IN THE ROTATION FOR PURPOSES OF FUTURE ASSIGNMENTS.
  (B) WHEN A UTILIZATION REVIEW AGENT IS SELECTED FROM THE POOL OF QUAL-
 IFIED UTILIZATION  REVIEW  AGENTS  MAINTAINED  BY  THE  DEPARTMENT,  THE
 COMMISSIONER  SHALL  REMOVE SUCH ASSIGNEE FROM ITS THEN CURRENT PLACE IN
 THE ROTATION AND PLACE SUCH AGENT'S NAME AT THE END OF THE POOL SO  THAT

  §  8.  Subdivision 3 of section 13-b of the workers' compensation law,
 as amended by section 1 of part CC of chapter 55 of the laws of 2019, is
 amended to read as follows:
  3.  A  provider  properly  licensed or certified pursuant to the regu-
 lations of the commissioner of education and  the  requirements  of  the
 education  law desirous of being authorized to render medical care under
 this chapter and/or  to  conduct  independent  medical  examinations  in
 accordance  with paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section thirteen-a
 and section one hundred thirty-seven  of  this  chapter  shall  file  an
 application  for  authorization  under  this  chapter  with the chair or
 chair's designee.  Prior to receiving authorization, a  physician  must,
 together  with  submission  of  an application to the chair, submit such
 application to the medical society of the county  in  which  the  physi-
 cian's office is located or of a board designated by such county society
 or  of a board representing duly licensed physicians of any other school
 of medical practice in such  county,  and  such  medical  society  shall
 submit the recommendation to the board. In the event such county society
 or  board  fails  to take action upon a physician's completed and signed
 application within forty-five days, the chair may complete review of the
 application without such approval. Upon approval of the  application  by
 the  chair or the chair's designee, the applicant shall further agree to
 refrain from  subsequently  treating  for  remuneration,  as  a  private
 patient, any person seeking medical treatment, or submitting to an inde-
 pendent  medical examination, in connection with, or as a result of, any
 injury compensable under this chapter, if he or  she  has  been  removed
 from  the  list  of  providers  authorized  to render medical care or to
 conduct independent medical examinations under this chapter, or  if  the
 person  seeking  such treatment, or submitting to an independent medical
 examination, has been transferred from his or  her  care  in  accordance
 with  the  provisions of this chapter. THE APPLICANT SHALL ALSO AGREE TO
 CONDUCT ALL EXAMINATIONS IN AN  OBJECTIVE  AND  IMPARTIAL  MANNER.  This
 agreement  shall  run to the benefit of the injured person so treated or
 examined, and shall be available to him or  her  as  a  defense  in  any
 action by such provider for payment for treatment rendered by a provider
 after  he  or she has been removed from the list of providers authorized
 to render medical care or to conduct  independent  medical  examinations
 under this chapter, or after the injured person was transferred from his
 or her care in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
  § 9. Section 137 of the workers' compensation law is amended by adding
 two new subdivisions 13 and 14 to read as follows:
  13.  EXAMINERS  SHALL HAVE THEIR RECORDS RANDOMLY REVIEWED AND AUDITED
 PERIODICALLY BY THE CHAIR. THE CHAIR SHALL BE AUTHORIZED  TO  CONDUCT  A
 RANDOM  REVIEW  OF  NO  MORE  THAN  FIVE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION

 OPINION  OF  THE  CHAIR,  THREE  OR  MORE  OF THE EXAMINER'S RECORDS AND
 DOCUMENTATION OUT OF THE FIVE RECORDS THAT MAY BE AUDITED  ANNUALLY  ARE
 JUDGED  TO  BE  DEFICIENT,  THE CHAIR SHALL BE AUTHORIZED TO AUDIT ADDI-
 TIONAL RECORDS DURING SUCH REGISTRATION PERIOD AND SHALL  BE  AUTHORIZED

 TRANT'S CURRENT INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINER REGISTRATION  PERIOD.  IF

 REMEDIAL  ACTION DIRECTED ON THE PART OF THE CHAIR, THE CHAIR MAY REMOVE
 THE EXAMINER FROM THE POOL OF NAMES  AVAILABLE  TO  CONDUCT  INDEPENDENT
 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. ONCE A REGISTRANT'S NAME HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE
 POOL,  IN  ORDER TO RE-REGISTER AS AN EXAMINER THE REGISTRANT SHALL SEEK

 SPECIFIC PAGE AND REFERENCE TO THE RELEVANT PRACTICE GUIDELINE OR TO THE
 RELEVANT  PEER-REVIEWED  MEDICAL  LITERATURE,  SCIENTIFIC  STUDIES,
 ABSTRACTS,  AND/OR  STANDARD  REFERENCE  COMPENDIA,  THAT  THE  EXAMINER
 UTILIZED TO ASSIST HIM OR HER IN REACHING A DETERMINATION WHEN  COMMENT-
 ING  ON OR MAKING ANY DETERMINATION ADVERSE TO THE CLAIMANT'S ONGOING OR
 CONCURRENT CARE OR A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW  BASED  ON  A  REVIEW  OF  THE

 CHAIR  IS  HEREBY  DIRECTED  TO  ESTABLISH  AND PERIODICALLY UPDATE FROM

 THEIR NAME TO THE CHAIR, CERTIFY IN WRITING  THAT  THEY  WILL  MAKE  ALL
 DECISIONS ON CASES BEFORE THEM IN A FAIR AND UNBIASED MANNER, BASED UPON
 THE FACTS PRESENTED TO THEM, AND WITHOUT ANY PRECONCEIVED BIAS, PRESSURE
 OR  INFLUENCES  ASSERTED  FROM  OUTSIDE ELEMENTS OR PRIOR EXPERIENCES OR
 WORK. A LICENSED PHYSICIAN SHALL PRESUME TO BE  ELIGIBLE  TO  APPLY  FOR
 INCLUSION  IN THE POOL, UNLESS THE CHAIR FINDS EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
 DICTATE THEIR DISQUALIFICATION.
  2. (A) THE CHAIR SHALL ASSIGN PHYSICIANS OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL  HEALTH
 SERVICE  PROVIDERS  AUTHORIZED  TO EXAMINE OR EVALUATE INJURY OR ILLNESS

 ICAL EXAMINATIONS AND REVIEW MEDICAL RECORDS OF COVERED  PERSONS  EXCLU-
 SIVELY  ON  A  RANDOM, ROTATING BASIS TO ELIMINATE BIAS OR PREFERENCE IN
 THE SELECTION OF THE EXAMINERS, OR ALTERNATIVELY, THE CHAIR MAY SELECT A
 NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION TO ASSIGN PROVIDERS FROM  THE  POOL  ON  THE
 SAME BASIS. SUCH ASSIGNMENT MAY BE DONE THROUGH A PROCESS WHEREBY A LIST

 PROVIDERS  IS  COMPILED  BY  GEOGRAPHIC  REGION THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND
 PROVIDED TO THE INSURANCE CARRIER AND THE CLAIMANT FOR THE  PURPOSES  OF
 PROVIDING  BOTH  PARTIES  EQUAL  OPPORTUNITY  TO REJECT NO MORE THAN TWO

 ENT MEDICAL EXAMINERS MAINTAINED BY THE BOARD, THE CHAIRMAN SHALL REMOVE
 SUCH ASSIGNEE FROM ITS THEN CURRENT PLACE IN THE ROTATION AND PLACE SUCH
 AGENT'S  NAME AT THE END OF THE POOL SO THAT SUCH AGENT MAY BE AVAILABLE
 FOR ANOTHER REGIONAL UTILIZATION REVIEW AGENT ASSIGNMENT AS NEEDED.
  (C) A PRACTITIONER IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO PERFORM AN  INDEPENDENT  MEDICAL
 EXAMINATION  OF  A CLAIMANT WHEN THE APPEARANCE OF OR AN ACTUAL CONFLICT
 OF INTEREST EXISTS. A CONFLICT OF INTEREST SHALL  INCLUDE,  BUT  NOT  BE
 LIMITED  TO,  INSTANCES WHERE THE UTILIZATION REVIEW AGENT OR SOMEONE IN
 THEIR OFFICE OR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT OR PRACTICE HAS TREATED OR  EXAMINED
 THE  CLAIMANT.  A CONFLICT OF INTEREST MAY BE PRESUMED TO EXIST WHEN THE

 EXAMINER FOR A PARTICULAR CLAIMANT, REQUEST THAT THE  EXAMINER  DISCLOSE
 ALL POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST TO THE CHAIRMAN THAT MAY RESULT FROM
 ANY  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN THE EXAMINER AND THE INSURANCE CARRIER, SELF-
 INSURED EMPLOYER, OR THE CLAIMANT.  A  POTENTIAL  CONFLICT  OF  INTEREST
 EXISTS WHEN THE EXAMINER, OR SOMEONE IN THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY, RECEIVES
 SOMETHING  OF  MATERIAL  VALUE FROM THE INSURANCE CARRIER WHETHER IN THE
 FORM OF STOCK, ROYALTIES, CONSULTANTSHIP, FUNDING BY A  RESEARCH  GRANT,
 OR  OTHER  PAYMENT  BY  THE INSURANCE CARRIER FOR ANY ADDITIONAL SERVICE
