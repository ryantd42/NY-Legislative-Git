  WHEREAS, It is the custom of this Legislative Body to recognize  and
commend  those distinguished citizens who would devote their life's work
and purpose to community service, contributing to  the  welfare  of  the
citizens of their communities and this great Empire State; and
 
  WHEREAS,  Attendant  to  such  concern,  and in full accord with its
long-standing traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to honor
Lindsay Mangione upon the occasion of her designation  as  recipient  of

  WHEREAS,  Lindsay  Mangione  is receiving this prestigious award for
her steadfast and unremitting commitment to  her  beloved  community  of
Clarence; and
 
  WHEREAS,  This  devoted  individual,  with  a passion for all things
dance, opened her own studio, called Releve' Dance Company,  during  the
COVID-19  pandemic, facing unprecedented hurdles; with great courage and
perseverance, she rose to meet  the  challenge,  defying  the  odds  and
admiringly  has  taught  almost  200 dancers, produced two recitals, and
brought her students to their first ever national competition; and
 
  WHEREAS, Lindsay Mangione majored in dance and minored in theater in
college; she taught for over 25 years before  opening  her  studio,  and
pursued  dancing  professionally  for a brief period before returning to
teaching, realizing her true passions lay in instructing; and
 
  WHEREAS, Understanding the importance of investing in the  youth  of
today,  Lindsay  Mangione hopes to build self-confidence in every dancer
she has the pleasure of instructing; interpersonal relationships,  hope,
kindness,  generosity,  acceptance, and respect, are pillars she credits
to living a happy life; and
 
  WHEREAS, It is the sense of this Legislative  Body  that  those  who
enhance  the well-being and vitality of their community and have shown a
long and sustained commitment to excellence certainly  have  earned  the
recognition and applause of all the citizens of this great Empire State;
now, therefore, be it
 
  RESOLVED,  That  this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations to
honor Lindsay Mangione upon the occasion of her designation as recipient
of the Perseverance Award by the Clarence Chamber of Commerce; and be it
further
 
  RESOLVED, That a copy of this  Resolution,  suitably  engrossed,  be
